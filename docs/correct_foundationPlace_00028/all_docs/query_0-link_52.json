Long time no see! A lot has happened during that time. And of course, we have new projects, which we would be happy to show you. We’ve opened new offices with great interiors, held awesome events, made new user-friendly interfaces for our products and much more. Acronis is growing at a very fast pace and, of course, we believe that the design team is one of the main drivers of this success. Design and peace to all!\n\nThe fourth anniversary of the Acronis Sofia R&D Center\n\nThis summer, we are celebrating the fourth anniversary of the Acronis R&D Center in Sofia. Sofia’s office is rapidly growing: from 20 people in 2018 to its current headcount of nearly 600. By the way, we also have another reason to be proud of this anniversary: Acronis Sofia Office Space is an Iron Design Award winner in the 2021–2022 Interior Space and Exhibition Design Award category.\n\nNV Tower is a large and innovative project for a multifunctional building located in an attractive area in the southeast section of the city of Sofia. The project follows the most up-to-date urban and architectural trends: multifunctionality, extensive public spaces in different areas of the building, richly landscaped roofs and facades, and carefully constructed architectural silhouettes, taking into account the context of the environment.\n\nThe concept was developed in consideration of global company brand policies and the highest standards in finishes, security, hygiene and innovation. During the challenging time of the global pandemic, the development of the design was undertaken through the collaboration and coordination of multiple teams within the company, located in different countries and even continents.\n\nThe space was planned and decorated in such a manner that it will leave an indelible impression once visited. The impact of the brand DEEP BLUE COLOR is so striking that visitors cannot possibly help but be favorably impressed. Upon entry, you are immediately aware that you are at Acronis.\n\nReunite & Accelerate — Acronis Partner Day 2022 in Munich\n\nOn May 5, 2022, Acronis partners and service providers from across the DACH region gathered together for Reunite and Accelerate — Acronis Partner Day, 2022. Germany, Austria, Switzerland and the rest of the region comprise a tight-knit community of Acronis partners and IT leaders important to our success. This gathering offered great networking possibilities, exciting cyber protection demos, and inspiring sessions and business opportunities at the amazing MotorWorld facility in Munich.\n\nCyberFit Summit World Tour\n\nMiami, Schaffhausen, Dubai and Singapore — more than 150 innovative and inspiring speakers, thousands of partners in person, and tens of thousands of online participants who discovered and discussed trends that are shaping the cyber protection industry. Offline and online activities were in parallel, like two universes that were destined to become one.\n\nThe Hubilo Virtual Event Platform became our “mission control” center. We designed all the elements in the platform in keeping with Acronis style. It genuinely felt as if we had developed a separate, user-friendly platform for our big event.\n\nAcronis Events\n\nAcronis organizes and participates in hundreds of events, conferences and webinars every year. We needed to create new and more better Acronis events hub in which:\n\nVisitors would be able to quickly navigate and find events based on their type, location and language categories.\n\nEvent managers wouldbe able to publish, update and remove events easily.\n\nPublishing and updating events to Acronis.com would be automatic and seamless.\n\nWe had several major requirements in this undertaking:\n\nCreate an interface that provides information on all upcoming events relevant to the user location.\n\nDesign the interface in a way that navigation provides easy access to recorded webinars based on their category and product.\n\nCreate an archive of all past events with filters to find any event.\n\nDisplay only the events relevant to the user’s location — both online and offline.\n\nCyber Protect Cloud. Advanced Data Loss Prevention (DLP)\n\nAdvanced DLP empowers you, with unmatched provisioning and management simplicity, to prevent data leakage from clients’ workloads via peripheral devices and network communications. With automatic initial DLP policy creation, you can accurately and efficiently create business-specific policies for each client.\n\nCurrent DLP solutions require costly security expertise and deep knowledge of clients’ business processes, together with complex, error-prone, manual configuration to ensure client-specific policies. With Advanced DLP, you can prevent data leaks for clients with the provisioning speed and policy management ease you need.\n\nLearn more about Advanced Data Loss Prevention (DLP)\n\nAcronis Partner Express Signup\n\nA new flow and way to sign up new partners without involvement of the inside sales team. It replicates the process of qualification of new service provider prospects and enables Acronis to scale the partner acquisition. This is the first time partner acquisition and account creation are fully automated and new Acronis partners are forwarded directly to their success managers.\n\nPartnership with Sale Sharks\n\nUnder their agreement, Acronis provides Sale Sharks with access to state-of-the-art cyber protection solutions for critical data assets. In addition, Acronis aids the team in analyzing its collected data with the help of AI and machine learning (AI/ML) technology to enhance on-pitch performance.\n\nMark Cueto, Commercial Director at Sale Sharks, comments: “We are delighted to have linked up with Acronis and it’s a partnership that will work both ways with their solutions perfectly matching our cyber protection needs. Acronis has a well-deserved reputation for providing global sports teams with the protection they need to keep data safeguarded, so we’re looking forward to working with them. Their solutions cause minimal disruption to day-to-day operations which is important to us; but the cyber protection they also offer guarantees that data can’t be illegally tampered with, offering even greater peace of mind.”\n\nLearn more about the partnership with Sale Sharks\n\nLearn more about other partnerships\n\nAcronis Cyber Foundation. Hope and humanity — Dreams of children from Ukraine art exhibition\n\nWhen the first waves of refugees from Ukraine poured into the coastal city of Burgas in Bulgaria, Acronis employees started to think about how they could help. One of their ideas was to help children process their emotions through art. Evgeniy Susov, a senior designer with Acronis, teamed up with Yulia Krasovska, a professional artist who migrated to Bulgaria five years ago from Ukraine, to start art therapy classes for children.\n\nFrom May 23–25, the “Dreams of Children from Ukraine” exhibit displayed the children’s art. More than 50 children shared their experiences and showed their art to the local Burgas community. Acronis Cyber Foundation organized the event and provided gifts for the children.\n\nArt therapy involves using various creative techniques such as drawing, painting, collage, coloring or sculpting to help people express themselves artistically and examine their art’s psychological and emotional undertones. Art therapy can help children and youth confront their emotions, relieve stress, and reduce anxiety.\n\nThe project is being led by Evgeny Susov and Yulia Krasovska and is supported by the municipality of Burgas, Cultural Center “Sea Casino,” Association of Ukrainian Organizations in Bulgaria, “Mother Ukraine,” Mikhal Aprilskaya, Acronis Cyber Foundation, the online edition of Gramofona.com, advertising agency “Add an image”, BurgasVoices, Children’s Choir, Milka Stoeva, photographer Mikhail Kostadinov, Krasovska Art School, Alla Kostenko, Olesya Danilyuk, Karina Nenasheva, Valentina Shevchenko and others.\n\nLearn more about Acronis Cyber Foundation\n\nMeet the team.

And it’s great to see how one’s work positively affects people throughout the entire company, and how they effectively leverage templates, recordings, and guidelines.\n\nWe are hiring\n\nWant to join our highly-accomplished international design team?
