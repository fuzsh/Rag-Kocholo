        "text": "Technology innovations and strong customer demand for data protection solutions fuels need for expansion\n\nAcronis, a global leader in hybrid cloud data protection, today announced continued success and demand for its backup and disaster recovery products, based on its hybrid cloud architecture by service providers, hosters and customers. As a result, the company opened a new technology center in Arizona, adding to its other US offices in Massachusetts, Virginia and California.\n\nLocated at the recently opened Quad office project, owned and managed by Everwest Real Estate Partners, the new center in Scottsdale, Arizona will contain the inside sales organization for Acronis. The City of Scottsdale Economic Development team assisted Acronis in facilitating the lease at the new building. CBRE represented Everwest in the transaction.\n\n\"Acronis expanding its operation in Arizona is yet another example of how our state is the right place for a tech company to grow and scale its business,\" said Arizona Governor Doug Ducey. \"Arizona has been planning for the future for a long time and offers a thriving economic climate that continues to attract leading tech firms.\"\n\n\"Acronis is a perfect fit for Scottsdale and a great addition to a robust technology sector that continues to grow,\" said Mayor W.J. \"Jim\" Lane. \"We welcome the opportunity to work closely with the Acronis team as they ramp up their operation at the Quad.\"\n\nAcronis provides complete data protection needed by businesses of any size and individual users.

Acronis Backup Cloud, innovative Backup-as-a-Service for service providers also continues to grow at a rate of more than 100% a year, accompanied by a 350% growth in the number of protected devices and 400% growth of data stored in the Acronis Cloud.\n\n\"Our business growth enabled us to make a strategic decision to bring our inside sales organization back in-house, where we will be able to further grow and provide amazing service to our customers,\" said Pat Hurley, VP of Sales at Acronis. \"Arizona is a wonderful state, ripe with talented people and a favorable business environment. We are excited for the future.\"\n\nAcronis was founded in 2003 in Singapore with a primary focus on offering innovative data protection solutions to consumers, businesses and service providers. To meet the rapid growth demands, the company expanded overseas, opening its corporate headquarters in Schaffhausen, Switzerland and establishing presence in key markets, including U.S., Germany, Japan, Russia, and Australia.\n\n\"Cybersecurity is not only vitally important to our online future, it is a critical foundation that supports all our industries,\" said Sandra Watson, President & CEO of the Arizona Commerce Authority. \"We are pleased to welcome Acronis to Arizona. They are joining many other top tech companies who recognize Arizona's incredible pipeline of talent and highly competitive operating environment.\"\n\n\"Acronis's decision to expand their operations in Greater Phoenix allows them to join the already robust ecosystem of cybersecurity operations in our region,\" said Chris Camacho, President & CEO of the Greater Phoenix Economic Council. \"Working together with our partners to showcase our talented workforce, reliable infrastructure and connectivity of local innovators, we were able to demonstrate to Acronis why Greater Phoenix is an ideal place to scale.\"\n\nAbout the City of Scottsdale\n\nScottsdale is one of the state's leading job centers, with a diverse economy built on medical research, high-tech innovation, tourism and corporate headquarters.
