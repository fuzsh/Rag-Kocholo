        "text": "Acronis Global Cyber Summit 2020\n\nAcronis Global Cyber Summit 2020 is a completely virtual event, with hands-on interactive workshops, informative breakouts, inspiring keynotes, and the opportunity to meet some of the most successful MSP experts and cyber protection practitioners in the world.\n\nFor promoting the Acronis Global Cyber Summit 2020 and for reflecting the virtual soul of the event, we have created a stunning Singapore visualization in neon style with a lot of details and key places like Suntec City towers, Fountain of Wealth, Marina Bay, Downtown Core, and even magic trees from Gardens by the Bay.\n\nAcronis are thrilled to bring together the world’s largest community of cyber protection professionals for a two-and-a-half-day global conference committed to the improved protection of critical data assets and systems. During these unprecedented times, the demand for cyber protection has never been more critical. Join us from anywhere, on any device, and free of charge!\n\nJoin Acronis Global Cyber Summit 2020\n\nAntivirus & Antimalware protection\n\nAcronis Cyber Protect Cloud continues to earn the reputation of a top-notch, reliable security product. In August’s test by the Virus Bulletin, our product demonstrated exceptional detection performance, scoring 100% WildList detection, 0% false-positive rate, and 99.74% Diversity test results.\n\nThe Diversity test looks at products’ detection of another set of recent malware samples, to acknowledge the fact that products detect malware samples beyond a standard collection of samples, and provides a measure of that detection.\n\nSyntax Design System\n\nWe are evolving our design system starting in 2017. Past three years we have used Sketch + Zeplin, but at the beginning of 2020, we have transferred all libraries, assets, and documentation to Figma. To be honest, it was one of the best decisions that helped us not only rethink approaches and processes inside design teams but also focusing on deeper integration with development.\n\nRight now we are defining five top-level directions for the design system evolution. Foundation, automation, asset management, communication, and integration.\n\nThe foundation level helps to unify all Acronis products by using core style elements and build more flexible maintaining and contribution models in Figma on the Asset management level. The automation level by using Figma API, Jenkins, and Artifactory helps to integrate more deeply into development processes. The communication level helps to plan design and development sprints, to tell about the latest updates, to collect the feedback, and to involve designers in supporting and updating of the design system.\n\nSo, while we preparing a detailed story about the current state of the design system that will be published in October, you may look at the previous stories.\n\nPart 1. Single library of components\n\nPart 2. Icons, SVG fonts, Gulp\n\nPart 3. Self-made tools that we use in day-to-day work\n\nAcronis True Image 2021 release\n\nThe new version of Acronis True Image integrates best-of-breed personal backup solution with advanced antimalware technologies, including real-time protection, on-demand antivirus scans, web filtering, and videoconference protection.\n\nAcronis is selling Acronis True Image not only like the digital product with online purchasing but also, by a traditional business model with product distribution by physical stores. The main distribution regions are NAM (US and Canada), DACH (Austria, Germany, Switzerland), APAC (East Asia, South Asia, Southeast Asia, Oceania), Japan, and Northern Europe. We are in Acronis Design preparing a lot of additional things, starting from boxes design for each region and finishing by all kinds of supporting materials like postcards and flyers, guides and instructions, and even DVD discs with product copies.\n\nOne of the main reasons why physical copies still selling is psychological. A physical copy of a product (even if it’s just a box with a code inside) is a justification that you didn’t throw your money down the drain. You get the box, you unpack it, you read the brochures inside, it’s a nice feeling, that you bought something new. Also, most people purchase boxes when they buy a new computer. Having an additional physical product might make them feel they get a better value for their money. After that, buyers renew the license online. And of course, the boxes in the physical stores are mainly for brand awareness purposes — customer sees the product on the shelf, comes back home and purchases it online.\n\nTechnical illustrations\n\nWe are using technical illustrations to describe product functionality or show how specific modules or integrations work. Such illustrations in pair with the text help our users to understand not only the scheme of working but see all the key points of the described functionality.\n\nTo make illustrations more effective, interesting, and eye caught we are animating some of them and bringing a bit of interaction between objects on the screen.\n\nAcronis SCSVets Challenge coins\n\nAcronis SCSVets’ driving mission is to reduce veteran and military spouse under- and unemployment and to help eliminate America’s cyber workforce shortage by arming its participants with the certificates, skills, and resources they need to pursue self-sustaining cyber careers — at zero cost to them.\n\nIn order to commemorate this initiative, we developed Acronis SCSVets Challenge coins. Challenge coins are often used by the Military and Federal Agencies to represent particular organizations and accomplishments. Such coins will be given to all students as well as high ranking officials who support the initiative.\n\nTempe office state Arizona, US\n\nJuly 2019, Acronis has opened a new office in Tempe Arizona. Our new office is a hub to fuel advances in blockchain, machine learning, and artificial intelligence-based cyber protection as well as unique consulting services for customer development and deployment of security and AI solutions.\n\nWe are sure that the Tempe office will be a cutting-edge research and development office that will serve as the company’s largest and fastest-growing data center operations space.\n\nLatest articles in our blog\n\nWe are not only showing the coolest images but also sharing more about design, development, and research. We aim to share our knowledge and expertise and are trying to show how we are work and think.\n\nAcronis Design Highlights #2\n\nLivery design for an autonomous racing car, #CyberFit Score functionality for Acronis Cyber Protect, Acronis True Image Beta 2021 dark mode, the story about Acronis wine, Singapore office, and even more inside."
