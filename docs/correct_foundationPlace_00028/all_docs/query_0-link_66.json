If you are unhappy with our product for any reason we will do everything in our power to make it right. People over profit. Service and quality over speed. Efficient by design.\n\nLuke started working in carpentry in 1996. He has gone on to build approximately 400 homes and has run his own concrete and framing company since 2005. Heâ€™s always been a perfectionist with a high value for hard work, accuracy, honesty, and relationship. He treats his employees the way he would want to be treated. After a frustrating 2 years of trying to find a leather tool belt that understood the needs of the trades he ended up making his own. This quickly started to get attention on every job site for its efficiency, quality and proper tool placement. He started making them for his crew and others in the local area. The expansion of this into other trades and modular set ups has grown the product line to serve most trades and ship tool belts around the world. They are still and will remain hand made in Canada to ensure that quality will never be sacrificed and that innovation can continue to happen on the shop floor every day."
