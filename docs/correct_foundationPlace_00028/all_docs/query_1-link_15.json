        "text": "Cyber protection company brings computer literacy classes to 230 students at the Vergen de las Gracias School\n\nNuevo Chimbote, PERU - May 11, 2021 - The Acronis Cyber Foundation, Acronis' nonprofit organization that builds schools and develops IT programs in underprivileged regions, recently completed construction of a computer classroom in the Virgen de las Gracias School, in Peru's Nuevo Chimbote district. This new classroom will enable computer literacy and STEM classes for students in the region, and marks an important Phase 2 step in the Acronis Cyber Foundation's Schools Initiative, empowering children in underserved communities and building the skills they'll need to excel in the modern world.\n\nThe Acronis Cyber Foundation first opened the Virgen de las Gracias School in June 2019, bringing an improved scholastic environment to the coastal region. Construction efforts were aided by local community members, many of whom had previously attended the school's old facilities before going on to become accomplished tradespeople. The school was constructed with sustainability in mind, with durable materials that could withstand local seismic activity. Thanks to all involved, Acronis was able to provide about 230 children - representing some of the community's most in-need members - with access to a free education, learning materials, uniforms, and school lunches.\n\nAs part of its Schools Initiative, the Acronis Cyber Foundation aims to develop computer classrooms in each school that it builds, in order to help students develop the STEM and IT skills they'll need to further self-educate and to thrive in our modern world. Given the rapidly evolving cyberthreat landscape, these classrooms will have access to top-notch cyber protection with free premium licenses for Acronis True Image 2021. Acronis will also be developing and donating additional educational resources on topics including computer literacy and cybersecurity.\n\nThe importance of digital literacy and tools for these students is now more apparent than ever. In the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic, the Peruvian government has developed an online learning platform and curriculum, but many families in Nuevo Chimbote lack cell phones and home computers and are thus unable to participate in classwork. Hopefully, based on the active vaccination statistics in Peru, the situation will stabilize over the next several months, and children will soon be able to attend the new computer facility and gain these much-needed skills.\n\nDevelopment of this computer classroom was a joint sponsorship effort between the Acronis Cyber Foundation and its project partner, Climb Channel Solutions.\n\n\"We are proud to support the Acronis Cyber Foundation with a new classroom in Peru. Learning is at the center of our culture, and educational infrastructure helps communities thrive by improving the lives of individuals and families now and in the future,\" says Charles Bass, Chief Marketing Officer at Climb Channel Solutions. \"We are delighted to contribute our share to empowering youth in Peru with the knowledge and educational opportunities they deserve, as they will be the ones to one day make the changes this world needs.\"\n\nThe Acronis Cyber Foundation has completed construction on 11 schools, with two more in-progress and five planned for the near future. The Foundation continues to seek partners for collaboration on future projects. Interested parties are encouraged to contact foundation@acronis.org for more information.\n\nAbout the Acronis Cyber Foundation\n\nThe Acronis Cyber Foundation was established by Acronis in 2018 in honor of Acronis' 15-year anniversary and the company's founding principle that all evils are caused by insufficient knowledge. The foundation supports multiple initiatives around the world designed to stimulate education in order to gain and protect knowledge. The Acronis Cyber Foundation has been creating and sharing knowledge by funding schools and computer classrooms in underserved communities, publishing educational children's books, and developing IT training programs for groups including military veterans, ex-offenders, and immigrants.\n\nAbout Climb Channel Solutions\n\nClimb Channel Solutions is an international value-added distributor for emerging technology vendors with solutions in Security, Data Management, Connectivity, Storage & HCI, Virtualization & Cloud and Software & ALM.
