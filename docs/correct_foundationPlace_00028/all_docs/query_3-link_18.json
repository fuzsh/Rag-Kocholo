        "text": "Mulberri, an AI-driven insurance platform, and Acronis, a provider of cyber security and data protection solutions, have partnered to provide cyber insurance to US-based small & medium-sized businesses customers.\n\nThrough this partnership, Acronis customers can opt-in for Mulberri’s embedded Cyber Insurance directly through the Acronis platform.\n\nIt also enables Acronis and Mulberri to provide end-to-end solutions to Acronis customers.\n\nThe added Cyber Insurance inserts a layer of protection to Acronis’ services which already integrated cybersecurity, data protection, and endpoint management for managed service providers (MSPs) and small and medium businesses (SMBs).\n\nWith this new embedded insurance, Mulberri seeks to improve the low percentage of SMBs purchasing cyber insurance, which at 5% is a low figure mainly due to extensive and complex underwriting questions paired with cumbersome enrollment steps.\n\nMulberri Cyber Insurance is a unique product – a standalone policy, with $250,000 and $500,000 policy limits and fixed premiums – that is approved and regulated by state insurance authorities, the firm explains.\n\nThe low premium and policy limit provide important base coverage while being affordable to any SMB.\n\n“Our embedded partners are used to having to think twice about selling cyber insurance to SMBs as it slows down the sales process with questions and due diligence,” said Hamesh Chawla, co-founder and CEO, at Mulberri.\n\nHe continues: “We have removed these barriers and lowered the policy limit, creating an entry level program meant to provide cyber insurance coverage to businesses that have not had it in the past.\n\n“We are thrilled to contribute to SMBs having peace of mind that they are covered against increasingly common cyber-attacks that can have catastrophic consequences on their businesses.”"
