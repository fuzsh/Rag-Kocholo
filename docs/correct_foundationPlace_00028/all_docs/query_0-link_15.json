        "text": "In 2011, Mexico’s Ministry of Higher Education launched the “Digital High Schools” program to provide upper secondary education in rural and indigenous communities. However, inadequate infrastructure has prevented the program from achieving its goal.\n\nIn Tepetzintan, Puebla, high school students faced difficulties as they had to attend classes in the afternoons at a secondary school. This caused problems and discontent among the student community and parents. As a result, the community started a self-managed project called Rural Skills School. The students proposed that the Digital High School of Tepetzintan should become a Rural Skills School that teaches practical skills and ancestral agricultural knowledge to preserve indigenous language and culture.\n\nThe community now has two almost completed classrooms for high school students. Acronis and its partner Virtual Tech came on board to complete two existing classrooms, build the third one and sanitary facilities. If you’d like to join this project and support the community, contact us at foundation@acronis.org.\n\nTemplo del Sol, which translates to “Temple of the Sun,” refers to several ancient Mesoamerican temples dedicated to the worship of the sun god, located throughout Mexico and Central America. The most famous example is the Templo Mayor in Mexico City, which was the main temple of the Aztec capital of Tenochtitlan and served as the center of religious and political life in the city. The ruins of the Templo Mayor can be visited today as part of the archaeological zone in the historic center of Mexico City.\n\nPhoto: ShutterStock\n\nPlaya Delfines is one of the most popular beaches in Cancun, Mexico, known for its soft white sand, turquoise waters, and stunning views. Other famous beaches in Cancun include Playa Norte, which is located on the nearby island of Isla Mujeres and is known for its calm waters and vibrant beach scene, and Playa Tortugas, which is popular for water sports such as jet skiing and parasailing. Playa del Carmen, a coastal town south of Cancun, also boasts beautiful beaches, such as Playa Mamitas and Playa Paraíso.\n\nPhoto: ShutterStock"
