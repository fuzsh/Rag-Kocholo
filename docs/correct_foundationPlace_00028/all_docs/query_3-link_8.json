        "text": "Business model of Acronis\n\nCustomer Segments\n\nAcronis has a segmented market business model, with customer groups that have slightly different needs. The company targets its offerings at consumers and businesses.\n\nValue Proposition\n\nAcronis offers three primary value propositions: accessibility, cost reduction, and brand/status.\n\nThe company creates accessibility by providing a wide variety of options. It offers solutions for data in remote, local, mobile, and cloud devices. Also, its products have been certified to work with Ubuntu Software, Red Hat Software, Mandriva Linux, and SuSE Certified Linux Software. It has been able to expand its capabilities due to numerous acquisitions. Its purchases include BackupAgent, nScaled, and GroupLogic. These acquisitions have enabled it to greatly expand its portfolio.\n\nThe company reduces costs in a variety of ways. It regularly provides special offers, such as “buy one license, get one free” and “protect five computers for the price of three.” It also offers free trials.\n\nThe company has established a strong brand due to its success. It protects the data of over 500,000 businesses in various industries and over 5.5 million consumers in more than 145 countries. It employs over 900 people. Lastly, it has won over 45 awards. Its many honors include the following:\n\nRecognition as a Gold Winner in the the Server Backup Software category by Top 10 Reviews\n\nRecognition as one of CRN Magazine‘s 25 Coolest Mobile Software & Service Vendors\n\nThe Channel Pro Reader’s Choice Award for Best Backup and Disaster Recovery\n\nRecognition as a Major Player in the IDC MarketScape: North America Disaster Recovery-as-a-Service Provider 2015 Vendor Assessment\n\nPC Magazine’s Editor’s Choice Award for the Acronis True Image Product\n\nChannels\n\nAcronis’ main channel is its direct sales team. It also sells its products through a network of distributors, resellers, and service providers. The company promotes its offerings through its website, social media pages, sponsorships, and participation in conferences.\n\nCustomer Relationships\n\nAcronis’ customer relationship is primarily of a self-service nature. Customers utilize its products while having limited interaction with employees. The company’s website features a “Resources” section with useful tools such as articles, white papers, data sheets, case studies, solution briefs, executive summaries, evaluation guides, infographics, and videos. The site also provides analyst reports and product documentation.\n\nDespite this orientation, there is a personal assistance component in the form of 24/7 phone, e-mail, and live chat assistance. There is also a community element in the form of a peer forum.\n\nKey Activities\n\nAcronis’ business model entails designing and developing its software for customers.\n\nKey Partners\n\nAcronis has over 50,000 partners globally. It maintains the following types of partnerships:\n\nService Providers Program – The company works with firms that provide services to its customers to assist with the use of its products.\n\nResellers Program – The company works with firms that sell its products and offer related services in order to extend its reach.\n\nOEM Program – The company works with firms that bundle its products into their software and hardware offerings in order to create enhanced solutions for customers.\n\nAffiliates Program – The company works with firms that promote its offerings on their websites and other platforms, offering them a commission of up to 50% for completed sales.\n\nAcronis provides partners with training programs, sales/marketing resources, 24/7 support, and access to a Partner Portal. Specific partners include ADN, CDW, Cloud Distribution, Comparex, HEG, Ingram Micro, Silvereye, and TechData.\n\nBeyond these partners, Acronis also maintains technology alliances with ConnectWise, cPanel, Kaseya, LabTech, Microsoft, Odin, VMware, and Virtuozzo.\n\nKey Resources\n\nAcronis’ main resources are its human resources, who include the engineers that design and develop its products, the sales employees that sell them, and the customer service employees that provide support.\n\nIt maintains important physical resources in the form of research and development centers in the United States, Russia, and Singapore, and cloud data centers in the U.S., Germany, France, Russia, Japan, and Singapore. It places a high priority on intellectual property, with over 100 patents. Lastly, it has relied on funding from outside parties, raising $11 million from three investors as of January 2004.\n\nCost Structure\n\nAcronis has a cost-driven structure, aiming to minimize expenses through significant automation. Its biggest cost driver is likely sales/marketing, a fixed cost. Other major drivers are in the areas of customer support/operations and administration, both fixed costs.\n\nRevenue Streams\n\nAcronis has one revenue stream: revenues it generates from the sale of its products to customers."
