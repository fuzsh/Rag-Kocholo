        "text": "Given the evolving threats to today’s digital world, Acronis has been leading the charge to develop a new approach to safeguarding it – one that combines the safety of data protection with the threat counter-measures of cybersecurity. Acronis calls this next generation of digital defense “cyber protection.”\n\nNow Acronis is bringing together the world’s largest community of cyber protection professionals at a two-and-a-half-day conference committed to improving the protection of critical digital assets and systems.\n\nThe Acronis Global Cyber Summit 2019 will be held at the Fontainebleau Miami Beach Resort on October 13–16, 2019, and it promises to be the must-attend event for IT infrastructure managers, CIOs, service providers, value-added resellers, ISVs, and developers.\n\nExploring Cyber Protection\n\nIn promoting the next generation of cyber protection solutions, Acronis argues that effective digital defenses must address the Five Vectors of Cyber Protection — ensuring the safety, accessibility, privacy, authenticity, and security of data (nicknamed SAPAS).\n\nThe Acronis Global Cyber Summit 2019 will explore this new reality in depth. World-class speakers and front-line practitioners will share the insights, solutions and partnership opportunities that can protect modern tech infrastructures safe from a world of proliferating and increasingly complex cyber threats.\n\nThroughout the event, attendees will learn how cutting-edge technologies such as artificial intelligence, blockchain, and cloud services are being deployed to protect against the kinds of data loss and security breaches that can devastate modern organizations and infrastructure.\n\nThought Leaders Team Up with Acronis\n\nIn crafting the Acronis Global Cyber Summit 2019 agenda, Acronis has drawn from numerous business and thought leaders whose experience and expertise will highlight the importance of cyber protection.\n\nSeveral high-profile speakers have already committed to sharing their insights at the conference, including:\n\nRobert Herjavec may be recognized from his work on ABC Television’s Emmy Award-winning Shark Tank, but he is first-and-foremost a dynamic entrepreneur who has built and sold several IT companies. In 2003 he founded Herjavec Group, a global leader in information security, operating across the US, UK, and Canada: specializing in managed security services, advisory services, identity and incident response for enterprise-level organizations.\n\nHis ability to interpret industry trends and understand the security demands of enterprises earned him his reputation as a global cybersecurity expert. He has served as a Cybersecurity Advisor for the Government of Canada, participated in the White House Summit on Cybersecurity, and is a member of the US Chamber of Commerce Task Force for Cybersecurity.\n\nSB (Serguei Beloussov) is an entrepreneur and business executive with a 24-year track record of building, growing, and leading high-performing, multi-national high-tech companies in North America, Europe, and Asia. Recognized as an innovator and thought leader in the fields of virtualization, data center automation, and cloud computing, he is a frequent speaker at industry events around the world.\n\nSB is currently focused full-time on Acronis, a global leader in cyber protection, which he founded and returned to as a CEO. SB also continues as a Senior Partner at Runa Capital venture fund. He is co-founder and former CEO of Parallels. He is also a founder, main investor and Chairman of the Board of Acumatica – a leading company in the cloud ERP space, as well as founder and investor in a string of other high-tech companies.\n\nEric O’Neill is an author, attorney, security consultant and professional public speaker. As an undercover field operative for the FBI, O’Neill helped capture the most notorious spy in United States history: Robert Hanssen, a 25-year veteran of the FBI and the first Russian cyber spy.\n\nO’Neill currently runs The Georgetown Group, a premier investigative and security consultancy out of Washington, DC, and is the National Security Strategist for Carbon Black, a leader in next-generation endpoint protection. He is the author of Gray Day, the thrilling story of how he helped take down Hanssen. A motivational speaker who weaves real-life experiences into a presentation that is both entertaining and rewarding, O’Neill provides practical insights into work situations relevant to many industries.\n\nLance Crosby founded StackPath in 2015 and currently serves as CEO and Chairman. His vision to change cloud technology manifested in a multi-product platform that is now leading businesses to a secure and scalable internet. He earned the Ernst & Young Entrepreneur of the Year 2018 Southwest Award.\n\nIn 2005, Crosby founded SoftLayer Technologies, which he grew into a $400 million business with more than 20,000 customers worldwide. He served as General Manager of Cloud Innovation at IBM after SoftLayer was acquired by IBM.\n\nCrosby holds an Honorary Doctorate, a Master of Businesses Administration, a Master of Science in Finance, and a Bachelor’s in Finance and Management from Tarleton State University—part of the Texas A&M University system. He also holds a Juris Doctor from Texas Wesleyan School of Law.\n\nLinda Babcock is the James M. Walton Professor of Economics and Chair of the Department of Social and Decision Sciences at Carnegie Mellon University. She is the founder and faculty director of the Program for Research and Outreach on Gender Equity in Society (PROGRESS) and the CMU Leadership and Negotiation Academy for Women. She is a member of the Russell Sage Foundation’s Behavioral Economics Roundtable and has served on the economics review panel for the National Science Foundation. Babcock’s research is conducted at the interface between economics and psychology.\n\nHer 2003 book, Women Don’t Ask: Negotiation and the Gender Divide was named by Fortune Magazine as one of the 75 smartest business books of all time, and Biz Journal’s top 20 most important business books ever written.\n\nGraeme Hackland is CIO for the Williams Group, one of the world’s leading Formula One teams. Williams brought him on board in 2014 to drive the team’s digital and information technology transformation program. With more than 22 years’ experience in Formula One, he serves on the company’s Executive Committee and leads the IT Risk Committee.\n\nAn acknowledgment of the work of the men and women of Williams and the team’s dedicated sponsors and technical partners, Hackland was listed in the Hottopics.hl Global Top 100 CIOs in 2017, as well as Computing UK Top 100 CIOs in 2016, 2017 and 2018, and the CIO 100 in 2017 and 2018. He is a Fellow of BCS, a member of the IEEE and IEEE Computer, Society and holds a National Diploma in Electronic Engineering (LC) from Natal Technikon, South Africa.\n\nRegistering for Acronis Global Cyber Summit 2019\n\nRegistration for the Acronis Global Cyber Summit 2019 is now open – and a deeply discounted “Early-Early Bird” price of $375 is available until the end of the month (April 30, 2019)."
