We engaged in school construction (implemented in partnership\n\nwith the Groundbreaker), IT skills training (in collaboration with Yellow Ribbon Fund, IMDA and Integres) and other\n\neducational and humanitarian aid initiatives for children and adults.\n\nTo mark our fifth anniversary in 2023, we are expanding our focus also to include environmental projects."
