Acronis, a global leader in cloud data protection and storage have launched the Acronis Foundation to mark their 15-year anniversary. The foundation will be supporting multiple initiatives designed to stimulate education to gain and protect knowledge.

The first project is Acronis Schools Initiative, an international endowment that will fund the construction of 15 new schools in underserved communities around the globe during the next three years.

John Zanni, Acronis’ President, explained, “Acronis believes that all evils are caused by insufficient knowledge. Knowledge is always good and has the power to bring real change in the world. That belief is a core component of what drives Acronis. The company was built to protect knowledge by protecting all data, applications and system in the modern digital world.”

UNESCO estimates that more than 50 per cent of the world’s children (over 617 million) are unable to reach the minimum proficiency levels of reading and mathematics. Acronis believes that every child has the potential to learn, giving them the skills needed to gain knowledge and create opportunities for themselves and their community.

“School is where the path to knowledge and opportunity begins,” said Jochen Berger, Managing Director of the Acronis Foundation. “Technology is the modern language of opportunity, but without a basic education, no one can learn that language. Schools built by the Acronis Foundation will provide the infrastructure where students can acquire the educational skills to learn the language of technology needed to claim those opportunities, regardless of their social, economic or cultural background.”

The Acronis Schools Initiative will work with local leaders and non-profit organizations to build schools that meet the community’s unique needs. School projects are currently planned in Latin America, the Middle East, South East Asia and sub-Saharan Africa.
