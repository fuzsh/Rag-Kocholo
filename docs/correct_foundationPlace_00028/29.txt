SCOTTSDALE, Ariz., April 2, 2019 /PRNewswire/ -- Acronis SCS today announced its official launch as an independent American company dedicated to providing secure backup, data protection, and cyber protection services to the U.S. public sector. Acronis SCS brings to market a trusted suite of products that allow agencies to protect sensitive data while supporting legacy systems during the modernization journey. All Acronis SCS products are built and supported in the United States by U.S. citizens, and validated by US-based third-party agencies.

As agencies across the public sector become more reliant on data to achieve mission outcomes, securing and protecting data in transport and at rest has become a top priority. Acronis SCS addresses these concerns by empowering agencies with the autonomy and ease-of-use needed to protect their data locally and at the edge. Acronis SCS has taken major strides to build innovative technologies that work alongside legacy systems during the modernization journey, and securely manage its supply chain to mitigate additional risk.

"Our trusted solutions do just that for federal agencies â€“ improve cybersecurity posture, ensure data availability, and narrow the gaps that hinder operational assurance."

Acronis SCS is working diligently to achieve the necessary government certifications for its products. Acronis SCS has partnered with Corsec, a consulting firm, to assure its code and processes are auditable and traceable.
