        "text": "Background\n\nOn March 13, 2019, Gary Barber and Lantern Entertainment relaunched Spyglass Entertainment as Spyglass Media Group, a successor to The Weinstein Company with Cineworld, Eagle Pictures USA, and later Warner Bros. and Lionsgate coming in as minority investors.\n\nLogo (July 26, 2019-)\n\nVisuals: It's basically an enhanced and more realistic version of the Spyglass Entertainment logo. Like its predecessor, the ocean is reflected in the telescope lens, with the mountains being further back this time around. The \"SPYGLASS\" text (in the Hoefler Text font) is now glassier/silvery, and appears behind the man's telescope as opposed to the background. The water in the ocean is more realistic and becomes blue-toned as soon as the box starts zooming out. Finally, the words \"MEDIA GROUP\" fade in with a wiping effect (also in silvery 3D), replacing \"ENTERTAINMENT\" from the Spyglass Entertainment logo.\n\nVariants:\n\nAn early television variant exists that debuted on season 17 of Project Runway with a different ocean backdrop. As the box zooms out on a black background, the camera inside the box zooms out of a 2D silhouette of the man and his telescope. The company name wipes in between the box.\n\nA still version of the aforementioned variant also appears as a closing logo starting with Scream (2022).\n\nThe later television variant has a short version of the theatrical logo that starts when the box zooms out, and the first second is sped-up.\n\nAt the end of Thanksgiving, the print logo is seen.\n\nTechnique: CGI.\n\nAudio: A new orchestration that mixes the power of the 1999 and 2010 Spyglass Entertainment themes together, with the same key as the former, as well as a bell sound at the end.\n\nAudio Variants:\n\nSometimes, it is seen with the film's opening theme or silence.\n\nOn the TV variant, the first 6 notes of the 1999 theme are heard, only faster.\n\nAvailability: It first debuted on international prints of The Current War, and also appeared on the film's US re-release. It was also seen on the trailer for Scream (2022), with its first complete appearance with the theme showing up on said film, as well as on Hellraiser (2022), Scream VI, Thanksgiving, and Reunion. The television version appears on Project Runway starting with season 17 and Waco: The Aftermath."
