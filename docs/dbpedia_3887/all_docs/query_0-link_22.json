        "text": "DVD Rentals - Body Wins, and That's the Truth\n\nMarch 3rd, 2009\n\nThere were seven new releases to chart this week, and a few others that just missed that mark. The winner was Body of Lies with roughly 20% more revenue than second place Changeling. More...\n\nDVD Releases for February 17, 2009 - Part I\n\nFebruary 17th, 2009\n\nThis felt like a slow week to me, but looking at the list there were 15 spotlight reviews, which is a huge amount for one week. There are a large number of DVDs worth checking out, but looking at the top of the list, I think Christopher Titus - Love is Evol is the best DVD coming out this week, and the winner of the DVD Pick of the Week. As has happened pretty much every week this year, there are so many DVDs on this week's list that is had to be split into two. The second part can be found here. More...\n\nMost New Releases Turn Out to be Dogs\n\nOctober 13th, 2008\n\nWith four wide releases this past weekend, I knew not all of them would be hits, but I also didn't expect all of them to be misses. Perhaps that's not entirely fair, and given the production budgets involved, not all films flopped at the box office, but enough did that overall box office receipts dropped 10% to $102 million. Compared to the same week last year, that still represents an increase, albeit by less than 3%, which is more or less in line with ticket price inflation. Year-to-date, 2008 and 2007 have both brought in $7.38 billion, but 2008 has had the edge the past few weeks and could retake the lead this upcoming weekend. More...\n\nMovie Website Reviews for Weekend of October 3, 2008\n\nOctober 5th, 2008\n\nA busy week for new releases with more than a dozen sites here, but most were just average. The best of this week's selection was the Official Site for Nick and Norah's Infinite Playlist, which has enough of the basics, extras, and style to stand out. More...\n\nWeekend Estimates: Beverly Hills Chihuahua Scores Healthy Win\n\nOctober 5th, 2008\n\nBeverly Hills Chihuahua rose above a very crowded field of openers to claim the box office crown, according to studio estimates released on Sunday. The movie scored Disney's biggest opening weekend in October with an estimated $29 million. Nick and Norah's Infinite Playlist also performed well with a $12 million debut in 2,421 theaters. That's a great return for a movie with a budget reported at $13 million. The other strong performer was Appaloosa, which expanded to 1,045 theaters and pulled in $5.015 million for an impressive 5th place. The rest of the wide openers didn't fare so well, although a couple of limited releases impressed... More...\n\nTight Competition Likely to Squeeze out Most Films\n\nOctober 3rd, 2008\n\nIf you thought last weekend was too busy, this weekend is worse with eight films opening or expanding wide, or at least wide-ish. However, only one film is opening at saturation level (3,000 or more theaters) and one other is opening truly wide (2,000 or more theaters). After those two films, the rest of the new releases will be forced to fight over the table scraps. More...\n\nCast Updates - October 2, 2008\n\nOctober 2nd, 2008\n\nThis week's round of new casting information contains updates for Paper Man, Sherlock Holmes, Kung Fu Panda 2, and more! More...\n\n2008 Preview: October\n\nOctober 1st, 2008\n\nSeptember ends, and for that we are all very grateful. However, while we are entering the final push for 2008 at the box office, things don't look too rosy for the upcoming month. First of all, there are way too many films opening, including eight that are opening or expanding on the first weekend. Of those two, maybe three will thrive. Most will sink without being noticed, which could negatively affect the overall box office going forward. On the other hand, there are a few films opening this month that could be players come Awards Season, which is just around the corner. Perhaps this will help a few mid-level hits rise above the crowd. More...\n\nCast Updates - August 28, 2008\n\nAugust 28th, 2008\n\nThis week's round of new casting information contains updates for City of Ember, Flash of Genius, Toy Story 3, and more! More...\n\nNew Movie US Release Dates - August 24, 2008\n\nAugust 24th, 2008\n\nThis week's round of new movie release information contains release dates for The International, Youth in Revolt, Fame and more! More...\n\nNew Movie US Release Dates - April 6, 2008\n\nApril 6th, 2008"
