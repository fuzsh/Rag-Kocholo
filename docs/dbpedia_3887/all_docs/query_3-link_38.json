        "text": "Background\n\nSpyglass Entertainment was an American film production company founded by Roger Birnbaum and Gary Barber in 1998, after the former left Disney's Caravan Pictures. In 2010, Barber and Birnbaum became co-Chairs and co-CEOs of Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer, just as the company was recovering from bankruptcy, and due to that Spyglass's releases became heavily scaled back before bowing out entirely in early 2012.\n\nIn 2019, the company was revived as Spyglass Media Group under Lantern Entertainment.\n\nLogo (June 4, 1999-February 10, 2012)\n\nVisuals: There is an ocean environment with mountains in the background on a portable telescope. The ocean then disappears, revealing that a man is looking through the telescope to the right on the background. \"SPYGLASS\", in the Spectrum MT font and with a transparent 3D glass texture, appears from behind the mountains and moves above the man. Then a box zooms out, surrounding him on a black screen with \"ENTERTAINMENT\" wiping in at the bottom.\n\nVariants:\n\nOn Instinct (the first movie to use this logo), \"SPYGLASS\" appears in plain 2D (sans glass texture) from behind the mountains.\n\nStarting in 2010, coinciding with the music change, the glass texture on the \"SPYGLASS\" text is replaced with a shiny blue/white 3D lettering with a golden outline, and the water ripples on the ocean are more realistic.\n\nOn movies shot in 2.39:1 scope, the logo zooms out towards the end to fit the aspect ratio. Some movies, like Eight Below, Stay Alive, Underdog, Evan Almighty and The Love Guru use the 16:9 version cropped to 2.39:1.\n\nA fullscreen open-matte version exists and was seen on 4:3 prints of Dinner for Schmucks.\n\nOn 4:3 fullscreen prints of films shot in 2.39:1 scope starting with Reign of Fire, the logo zooms out to a much farther distance than usual.\n\nOn widescreen 16:9 movies with the above variant, the mountains appear further away.\n\nOn No Strings Attached, the logo cuts, rather than fades, to black.\n\nOn the TV show Miracles, the logo is shortened to the final few seconds.\n\nAt the end of The Lookout, the print logo is seen.\n\nTechnique: Live action and CGI by Picturemill.\n\nAudio: Either a dramatic, yet peaceful piano/string tune (composed by Randy Edelman, who also composed the fanfare for Spyglass's predecessor, Caravan Pictures), silence, or the opening theme of the movie.\n\nAudio Variants:\n\nOn The Sixth Sense, the sounds of the water waving and water splashes are added.\n\nOn The Count of Monte Cristo and Welcome Home Roscoe Jenkins, the last note is trimmed to fit the logo's duration.\n\nOn The Invisible, the string portion of the theme plays about a second early.\n\nOn 27 Dresses, the theme is re-orchestrated and in a different key, segueing into the opening theme of the movie.\n\nIn 2010, starting with Leap Year, the theme is re-orchestrated again; it sounds more powerful and in a higher key than the above one.\n\nOn AMC's print of Shanghai Noon, the theme is low-pitched.\n\nOn the TV show Miracles, 4 piano notes from the theme are heard.\n\nAvailability: It's seen on films produced by Spyglass from 1999 to 2012. It also appeared on the company's website."
