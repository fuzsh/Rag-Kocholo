        "text": "Rachael Tilly Wins All-Southern California Clash In Finals\n\nAn incredible Finals Day run for winner Rachael Tilly (USA) began with an all-star clash of WSL Longboard Champions. Tilly took on three-time WSL Longboard Champion Honolua Blomfield (HAW) in the Quarterfinals and delivered a near-perfect 9.00, along with a 16.10 heat total before facing fellow Tour veteran Natsumi Taoka (JPN) in the Semifinals. Tilly, the 2015 WSL Longboard Champion, went back and forth with Taoka and emerged victorious for her first Longboard Tour Final round since her World Title runner-up in 2018.\n\nNow, Tilly adds her name to the list of major victors in Huntington Beach’s surfing history with her first major win in Surf City USA over fellow Southern Californian and reigning WSL Longboard Champion, Soleil Errico (USA). The win pushes Tilly to No. 2 on the rankings.\n\n“I’m feeling so many emotions, so much happiness and elation,” said Tilly. “It’s been a long day, a long week, and I can’t believe we made it to this point. I have to dedicate this to Gretchen Harris, we just lost her and she’s such a big influence on our Southern California longboard community and touched so many people. I was thinking about her while I was out there and this means so much.”\n\nPictured: Southern California’s own Rachael Tilly (USA) posted a 9.00 to start her Finals Day surge.

Errico slid straight to the nose before showing her footwork and carving back to the source for a 5.00 (out of a possible 10). Tilly’s response showed she was ready to take on the reigning WSL Longboard Champion with poise on the nose and a powerful down carve that earned her a 7.67 and the lead. Tilly wasted no time backing herself up with a mid-ranged score of a 6.33 and control of the heat with 12 minutes remaining.\n\nErrico showed her patience, waiting for the wave that could deliver her the opportunity to claim the 9.27 requirement. The ocean didn’t provide for Errico and Tilly claimed her first WSL Longboard Tour victory since 2015.\n\n“Congratulations to Soleil [Errico], she is the toughest competitor, so it’s always an honor and you push me so hard,” said Tilly. “My whole family is here. My brother flew in this morning and came straight to the beach. To have this moment here at my home with my family, my heart is exploding.”\n\nTaylor Jensen Completes SoCal Sweep, Second Huntington Beach Win In Three Years\n\nThree-time WSL Longboard Champion and current World No. 1, Taylor Jensen (USA) was right at home in Southern California waters and thrived throughout Finals Day. Jensen’s form was undeniable from his first heat of the day, a Quarterfinal bout with Taka Inoue (JPN), where he posted an excellent 8.60. Jensen then faced event standout Chase Lieder (USA) in a wave-for-wave semifinal duel. Lieder pushed Jensen to his best and the Oceanside native rose to the occasion for his second Huntington Beach Longboard Classic Final in three years.\n\nJensen’s win pushes the WSL Longboard Tour veteran out to a commanding lead on the rankings as he hunts a historic fourth World Title with 10,000 points in his campaign.\n\n“Huntington’s just a special place for me, it’s close to home. It’s kind of the closest place for me to have an event. So, that’s special,” said Jensen. “I’m just having fun. Honestly, I’m just in a different head space this year and I’m just enjoying my time on Tour. Getting in, surfing good waves, and having fun with all my friends, it seems to kind of be working out.”\n\nPictured: Taylor Jensen (USA) rose to the occasion in home waters once more for a major win. Credit: © WSL / Pat Nolan\n\nAnother highly-anticipated Final, featuring Jensen and standout Rogelio JR Esquievel (PHL), unfolded with a set of incredible performances. A quick 6.67 start from Jensen was answered with an impressive 6.53 from Esquievel on his opening attempt. Esquievel then went on to find a pair of 7-point rides courtesy of his signature noserides and stylish down carves. Jensen responded with an 8.40 from a long noseride before taking two turns and finishing the wave with fans cheering on the beach.\n\nThere was one last opportunity for Esquievel to answer, but he fell short posting a 6.90, and Jensen claimed Huntington Beach victory once again.\n\nPictured: World No. 1 Soleil Errico (USA) earned back-to-back Finals appearance to start her World Title defense. Credit: © WSL / Pat Nolan\n\nSoleil Errico and Rogelio JR Esquievel Claim Runner-up Finishes Toward World Title Race\n\nSoleil Errico’s (USA) resume speaks for itself, but Malibu’s hometown favorite hasn’t yet added her name to the list of US Open of Surfing victors. Errico’s surge through Finals Day included an elite showing in her Quarterfinal heat with perennial World Title contender Alice Lemoigne (FRA), before she faced off against 2023 World No. 3 Sophia Culhane (HAW) in a nail-biting semifinal round.\n\nNow, Errico moves forward still ranked No. 1 with the Final 8 World Title race in her sights. She boasts a near-1,700 point lead.\n\n“Huntington Beach has always been a tricky wave for me to figure out and I’m really stoked with my result,” said Errico. “Making the Final, it’s better than how I did last year and I’m so happy for Rachael and her family. It’s been a good contest and I’m excited to keep competing this year.”\n\nPictured: Rogelio JR Esquievel (PHL) continues to show he belongs among the world’s best with his first Finals appearance. Credit: © WSL / Tommy Pierucki\n\nRising star Rogelio JR Esquievel (PHL) rode the wave of support on the beach from start to finish on Finals Day as the WSL Longboard Tour sophomore earned his first-ever finals appearance. Esquievel’s incredible form and poise against the world’s best, proves that his 2023 campaign wasn’t a fluke, besting 2022/2023 North America Longboard Regional winner and event wildcard Richie Cravey (USA) in the Quarterfinals. Esquievel then surfed in a semifinal showdown with Longboard Tour veteran Ben Skinner (GBR) – who posted the event’s best performance in the Quarterfinals with a 17.76 heat total.\n\n“First of all, I would like to thank everyone who got me here to support and also to Manong for flying here to just support me. And to the WSL, thank you so much for the great event and congrats to the winners. Thank you so much everyone.”\n\nThe Philippines competitor entered the event ranked No. 5, and with his runner-up finish, rose to No. 2."
