        "text": "“We call on Spyglass Media Company CEO Gary Barber and Lantern Asset Management Capital Leadership Andy Mitchell and Milos Brajovic to do right by the Weinstein victims,” the group said in a statement after the protest.\n\n“Actions speak louder than words and the Weinstein victims have been patiently waiting for Gary Barber, Andy Mitchell and Milos Brajovic to uphold their promises.\n\n“Nothing can take away the immeasurable pain of the past situations, but the good faith offer now seems to have been only empty rhetoric not followed up with the financial contributions.\n\nHe cites “institutional racism” as part of the reason he was cut out of a deal he said he brokered for the purchase of The Weinstein Company.\n\nPeart claims he was promised a seat on the board of the new company and more than $10million for bringing Lantern in as an investor.\n\nPeart slammed Latern for cutting him out of the deal, claiming, “Not only has it repudiated its contractual obligation to compensate Peart for his exceptional services and give him a seat on the reconstituted TWC The Weinstein Company Board of Directors, Latern is attempting to write him completely out of the story of how a Hollywood outsider landed the biggest entertainment deal of the year.\n\nThe lawsuit continued. “Omitting any reference to Plaintiff’s indispensable role in arranging its landmark acquisition, Lantern’s public announcements are a triumph of historic revisionism,” Peart claimed.\n\n“What happened to Plaintiff is not just a matter of damages for breach of contract. It is far more insidious. Peart is the latest striving African American who has been cheated out of his hard won right to occupy the winner circle because of his race. Lantern’s callous marginalization of plaintiff is otherwise inexplicable,” the lawsuit stated."
