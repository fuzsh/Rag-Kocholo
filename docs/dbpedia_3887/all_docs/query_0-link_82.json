        "text": "Katherine Heigl, who earlier this year got Knocked Up in the hit motion picture\n\ncomedy from Judd Apatow, and nabbed an Emmy® for her starring role as a surgical\n\nresident in Greys Anatomy, is always a bridesmaid but never a bride in the romantic\n\ncomedy 27 DRESSES. From the screenwriter of The Devil Wears Prada, 27\n\nDRESSES centers on Jane (Heigl), an idealistic, romantic and completely selfless\n\nwoman a perennial bridal attendant whose own happy ending is nowhere in sight. But\n\nwhen younger sister Tess captures the heart of Janes boss  with whom she is secretly in\n\nlove  Jane begins to reexamine her always-a-bridesmaid . lifestyle.\n\nJane has always been good at taking care of others, but not so much in looking\n\nafter herself. Her entire life has been about making people happy  and she has a closet\n\nfull of 27 bridesmaid dresses to prove it. One memorable evening, Jane manages to\n\nshuttle between wedding receptions in Manhattan and Brooklyn, a feat witnessed by\n\nKevin (James Marsden), a newspaper reporter who realizes that a story about this\n\nwedding junkie is his ticket off the newspapers bridal beat.\n\nJane finds Kevins cynicism counter to everything she holds dear  namely\n\nweddings, and the two lock horns. Further complicating Janes once perfectly-ordered\n\nlife is the arrival of younger sister Tess (Malin Akerman). Tess immediately captures the\n\nheart of Janes boss, George (Edward Burns). Tess enlists her always-accommodating\n\nsister to plan yet another wedding  Tess and Georges  but Janes feelings for him lead\n\nto shocking revelations and maybe the beginning of a new life.\n\n27 DRESSES caps a remarkable year for Katherine Heigl, whose ascension to\n\nsuperstardom began with her award-winning role in the top-rated series Greys\n\n1\n\nAnatomy and continued with her knockout performance in Knocked Up. When 27\n\nDRESSES producer Jonathan Glickman saw early footage of Judd Apatows comedy, he\n\nfelt that Heigl was really spectacular  you could see that she had a great energy.\n\nGlickman and fellow producers Gary Barber and Roger Birnbaum, partners at Spyglass\n\nEntertainment, were thrilled when Heigl said I do to 27 DRESSES.\n\nHeigl found much to explore with the character. Like other people, Jane takes\n\npride doing the things shes really good at, notes Heigl. She clearly loves being a\n\nbridesmaid; Jane is just taking it too far because shes filling her life with other peoples\n\ndesires, forfeiting her own memories or the memories she might make for herself. Shes\n\nsort of a secondary character in her own life.\n\nI really enjoyed the opportunity to play a character that is funny and charming,\n\nyet flawed  its everything I want in a comedic character, Heigl continues. I love this\n\nkind of comedy and enjoyed seeing how far I could push the humor. Ive been waiting\n\nmy entire career to have this kind of role.\n\nAline Brosh McKenna, who wrote the original screenplay for 27 DRESSES and\n\nthe adaptation for the critical and commercial success The Devil Wears Prada,\n\ndescribes Janes saga as a delayed coming-of-age story about a woman who finds out\n\nwhat things she needs to change about herself in order to go from being a bridesmaid to\n\nbeing a bride.\n\nMcKenna says her screenplay was inspired by a friends myriad stints as a\n\nbridesmaid. She has been in about a dozen weddings, which I thought was fascinating,\n\nsays McKenna. I thought, what would make somebody the sort of person who would be\n\ninvited to be in that many weddings? Obviously she has a lot of connections and\n\nfriendships, but there was something that was disconnecting her from having a\n\nrelationship that belonged totally to her.\n\nMcKennas facility in creating sparkling dialogue and comedic yet heartfelt\n\ncharacters and situations, was critical in attracting Heigl and the behind-the-camera team\n\nto the project. Aline has a great way with fun, quick dialogue that really develops these\n\ncharacters as real people, says Anne Fletcher, the acclaimed choreographer (The 40\n\nYear Old Virgin, Walk Hard: The Dewey Cox Story) who directed 27 DRESSES.\n\n(Her helming debut was the hit dance film Step Up.) I loved her script and\n\n2\n\ncompletely identified with Jane because I, too, am a full-blown co-dependent! My\n\nnickname is Mama because I like to take care of everything and everyone. But when you\n\nalways want to do for everybody, you forget about yourself. Thats what has happened\n\nto Jane and, I think, to a lot of women.\n\nWith the late Bobby Newmyer, an executive producer on 27 DRESSES,\n\nMcKenna pitched her story to Spyglass Entertainment; the companys Barber, Birnbaum\n\nand Glickman immediately saw the films appeal. Here was this girl that everybody\n\nloved but who never had a boyfriend and never put herself out there to try to get what she\n\nwanted, Glickman notes. She is a fun, intriguing character.\n\nWork continued on the script, and the story evolved from a tale of two friends\n\ndueling over the same man to a story about two sisters with a complex family dynamic,\n\nwhich provided more character and story-based humor and emotion. We tried to keep\n\nthe story focused more on Janes emotional journey and character as opposed to the\n\nmechanical nature of how two people are going to find each other, says McKenna.\n\nAdds Glickman: 27 DRESSES is a naturalistic movie with the very big idea about a\n\nwoman whos been a bridesmaid twenty-seven times. It allows us to send up craziness\n\nthat can occur at weddings, but at the same time we have a character-driven romantic\n\ncomedy with some big surprises.\n\nOnce production began, Fletcher and McKenna quickly became fans of the films\n\nstar. Katie [Heigl] has such a great understanding of physical comedy, character\n\ndevelopment, and of what is naturally funny, says Fletcher. She is brilliant at playing\n\nboth the physical comedy and sensitivity of this character. Adds McKenna: Its\n\namazing that someone who is that beautiful and that poised can convey the humor and the\n\nloneliness of being a perpetual bridesmaid. Katie is amazingly funny, her timing is\n\nimpeccable, and she understands and has a lot of empathy for Jane.\n\nWhile Heigls Jane is the storys heart and soul, the other leading roles are critical\n\nto defining her journey. Janes beloved but duplicitous younger sister, Tess, is played by\n\nMalin Akerman, who recently starred as Ben Stillers bride-from-hell in The Heartbreak\n\nKid, and is now before the cameras for the long-anticipated Watchmen. Tess is\n\nJanes Achilles' heel, notes Heigl. She cant say no to Tess and she cant let Tess make\n\nher own mistakes. Jane is always cleaning up after her and fixing everything, which Tess\n\n3\n\nhas come to expect and take advantage of without considering the consequences. They\n\nlove each other immensely and theres a real bond there, but its gone a little awry as\n\ntheyve gotten older.\n\nTess is definitely the typical younger sister whos had the road paved for her by\n\nher older sister, says Akerman. She knows how to manipulate situations  and her\n\nsister. Its a fun character to play because Tess gets stuck in the Bridezilla zone and\n\ngoes a little bit nuts. But deep down shes a real woman who knows what's going on.\n\nThe filmmakers wanted each sister to have a distinctive look. Jane is attractive\n\nbut not too flashy, notes costume designer Catherine Marie Thomas, but Tess had to\n\npop. The first time she encounters George, the moment where Janes heart is broken, we\n\nwanted Tess to be radiant and glowing  with a look that would stop traffic. Amid\n\ncharacters wearing dark clothing, Tess is in yellow, a gorgeous woman in this short dress\n\nwith no back; she just beams. Poor Jane, her boss is just drooling.\n\nThe two actresses hit it off immediately, but Heigl wondered whether the\n\naudience would buy them as sisters. My first thought was that Malin and I look nothing\n\nalike, says Heigl, but we picked up some of the same mannerisms and started talking\n\nthe same way. When we went to dinner in Providence [where most of the film was shot],\n\nfour or five people asked if we were sisters!\n\nThe men in Janes life are a cynical newspaper reporter, Kevin, and a self-made\n\nentrepreneur, George. James Marsden plays Kevin, an ambitious reporter at the fictional\n\nNew York Journal, where he begrudgingly pens a Sunday Weddings column that,\n\ndespite his cynicism about the ritual, is beautifully and sensitively written.\n\nFletcher cast Marsden after working with him in Hairspray, on which Fletcher\n\nwas an associate choreographer and second unit director, and Marsden played the\n\nBaltimore television-dance-show host Corny Collins. She notes the volatile Jane-Kevin\n\nrelationship is a classic rom-com situation of opposites repelling then attracting one\n\nanother. You can understand why Jane resists Kevin, says Fletcher. Hes sarcastic\n\nand cranky, and he nags and constantly bugs her. His protection is his wit and sarcasm,\n\nbut hes charming, charismatic and funny.\n\n4\n\nAdds McKenna: There is, however, a trait both characters share, for Jane and\n\nKevin are observers  he by profession  and in their own ways both have chosen to sit\n\non the sidelines.\n\nMarsden, best known for his role as Cyclops in the X-Men film trilogy, was\n\neager to tackle a romantic leading man part. I usually play the guy who gets the short\n\nend of the stick in, so it is nice when I read 27 DRESSES and realized, They're\n\nconsidering me for the guy who may actually get the girl!\n\nEd Burns progressive-thinking, über-male George is in some ways the polar\n\nopposite of Marsdens cynical newspaperman. George is the founder and CEO of a\n\nmanufacturer of environmentally-aware clothing and outdoor equipment. George is\n\nsome kind of movie version of the ultimate urban male, says Burns. He is very P.C.,\n\ndoes a lot of good environmental work, is a self-made man, a Big Brother to a young boy\n\n and he has a great dog. Of course we all know that guys like George dont really\n\nexist.\n\nJudy Greer plays Casey, Janes best friend and colleague at Georges company,\n\nUrban Everest. Casey is kind of brassy and loud and doesnt have much of a censor\n\ninside of her; she just says whatever comes to mind, says Greer. Shes fun, tries to\n\nbring out the wild side in Jane, and is super-loyal, valuing their friendship over all else.\n\nAlso taking on a starring role is the titular, often outrageous wedding garb\n\ndesigned by Catherine Marie Thomas. Thomas credits Fletcher with encouraging her to\n\npush the fashion envelope. Anne was very eager to explore the crazier side of\n\nbridesmaid dresses, says Thomas. If you use 27 normal dresses, it doesnt look\n\ninteresting. We wanted to convey the kind of pain that accompanies the wearing of such\n\nunusual styles.\n\nFletchers background in dance influenced the designs. I wanted to turn the\n\ndresses into costumes with matching outfits that make everyone look as if theyre going\n\nto break into a dance number, she explains.\n\nThomas likens the dress selection process to that of solving a puzzle. Initially\n\nwe had fifty outfits, so wed lose one dress and push another into something that was a\n\nlittle funnier, maybe adding lace or a hat, she elaborates. After we arranged them to\n\n5\n\nthe point where we were happy with assortment, we realized to our chagrin that we were\n\nthree dresses over, and had to eliminate more.\n\nHeigls favorite outfit was what she calls the Gone with the Wind dress, an\n\noutfit that would have done Scarlett OHara proud. The dress, also known as Plantation\n\nWedding, was made of yellow silk with orange flowers and orange ribbon lacing. It was\n\naccessorized with a straw bonnet with orange trim and grosgrain ribbon tie, a white lace\n\nparasol with orange ties, and bright yellow heels. For the Gone with the Wind\n\nwedding, we built everything, including eight gigantic hoop dresses, all different colors,\n\nshe says.\n\nThen there was the Bahama Mama dress  hot pink with big sections of pink\n\nand yellow tulle all the way around the bottom of the skirt; the Cowgirl Dress (aka\n\nCowboy Wedding), featuring a white cowboy hat with hot pink flower; the\n\nUnderwater Dress, complete with hot pink flippers and goggles; and the Green Vomit\n\nDress, which probably requires no further explanation.\n\nThough set primarily in New York City, much of 27 DRESSES was shot in\n\nRhode Island. Providence [, Rhode Island] offered a great alternative because it offers\n\nlocations that double very well for Manhattan, says Jonathan Glickman. Also, much of\n\n27 DRESSES is set outside of the City  on a beach and in rural upstate New York  and\n\nRhode Island was a perfect fit for those locales.\n\nKey Rhode Island locations included the Rosecliff and Marble House Mansions in\n\nNewport, a diner in East Greenwich, a beach in Charlestown, the city of Providence\n\n(which provided some New York City and Weehawken, New Jersey exteriors), and a\n\ndive bar in Pawtucket, where Jane and Kevin lead the patrons in a stirring if tipsy\n\nrendition of the classic Elton John tune Benny and the Jets.\n\nIn Pawtuckets Hope Artiste Village, a mixed-use industrial/loft space, production\n\ndesigner Shepherd Frankel created interior sets for the Urban Everest offices and a Hindi-\n\nJewish wedding scene. Shepherds done a great job not only selling Rhode Island as\n\nNew York, but also creating interiors like Urban Everest, as well as the news bullpen for\n\nthe New York Journal; the Journal set feels like no other movie scene set in a newspaper\n\noffice, Glickman notes.\n\n6\n\nThe production did spend two critical weeks in the Big Apple, shooting locations\n\nunique to the City. We used some familiar locations, like Central Park, but also parts of\n\nNew York you dont see in movies, like the East Village, where Janes apartment is\n\nlocated, and the Meatpacking District where Georges company is based, Glickman\n\nadds.\n\nThroughout production and into the final stages of post-production, the key word\n\nfor Anne Fletcher was big and relatable. When I hear 27 DRESSES described as a\n\nmodest romantic comedy, I say, Stop! she exclaims. Its a gigantic movie! Every\n\nwedding scene is enormous, from the flowers to the dresses to the people to the dancing\n\nand every other component. But the challenge was to make the situations and characters\n\nbig and recognizable. I didnt want to play it over the top. We wanted audiences to fall\n\nin love with these characters from the second they meet them.\n\nAnd what of the woman whose many trips to the altar as a bridesmaid inspired\n\nscreenwriter Aline Brosh McKenna? My friend got engaged just a couple of months\n\nbefore the movie got its official greenlight, says the screenwriter. Shell be married by\n\nthe time the movie comes out!\n\nABOUT THE CAST\n\nKATHERINE HEIGL (Jane) was recently seen in the box office smash hit\n\nKnocked Up. The film, directed by Judd Apatow and co-staring Paul Rudd and Seth\n\nRogen, focuses on a young woman who finds out that she is pregnant after a one night\n\nstand.\n\nHeigl can be seen weekly on ABCs critically acclaimed drama Greys\n\nAnatomy. She portrays Dr. Isobel Izzie Stevens, the small-town girl who is constantly\n\nbattling for respect amongst her peers.

Akerman began modeling and acting in television commercials at age\n\nfive.\n\nAt seventeen, Akerman won the Ford Supermodel of Canada search.
