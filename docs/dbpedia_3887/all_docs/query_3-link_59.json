        "text": "Jonathan Glickman, a seasoned veteran of over 25 years in the entertainment business, is the founder and CEO of Panoramic Media, formerly known as Glickmania, an independent film and television production company, founded in February 2020. Panoramic is the natural evolution of Glickman’s continued focus on developing IP for established and emerging storytellers across all content platforms, including film, television, and podcasting. Backed by significant entertainment industry investors, including Gary Barber, Spyglass Media Group, UTA, Pinky Promise, Eagle Pictures, and Lantern IRA, Panoramic will expand upon Glickman’s upcoming slate of projects at Netflix, Amazon, MGM, Warner Media, Paramount and MRC, among others.\n\nPanoramic first two productions became global phenomenons. The company’s first tv production, the Golden Globe nominated tv series Wednesday, recently surpassed over one billion hours viewed to become the second most watched show in Netflix’s history. The Tim Burton helmed series, based on Charles Addams’ beloved misanthrope, was recently renewed for a second season. Additionally, Panoramic’s first feature film, actor/director Michael B. Jordan’s Creed 3, opened to over $100M in worldwide box office, securing the highest opening weekend ever for a sports film.\n\nUpcoming productions include The Underdoggs, a sports comedy starring Snoop Dogg due to be released October 20, 2023 as well as Robert Deniro’s first television series, Netflix’s political-thriller Zero Day.\n\nThe new venture marks a return to independent production for Glickman after a successful eight year run as President of the MGM Motion Picture Group, where he guided a bankrupt company into a thriving studio with a full slate, two labels and theatrical distribution. During his tenure, Glickman oversaw production on Eon’s Skyfall and Spectre, the two highest grossing installments of the James Bond franchise, as well as the forthcoming No Time to Die, Daniel Craig’s final outing in the series. Other notable highlights of his tenure include overseeing the production of the Rocky spinoff Creed, and the sequel Creed 2, starring Sylvester Stallone and Michael B Jordan, as well as the 2019 animated hit recreation of The Addams Family. Notably, during Glickman’s term at MGM, he was ahead of the industry’s diversity hiring initiatives, with 24% of his slate featuring female filmmakers and 27% featuring directors of color, far exceeding the industry average.\n\nGlickman began his career at Caravan Pictures, where he produced such hits as While You Were Sleeping, Grosse Pointe Blank and the global phenomenon Rush Hour franchise which brought Jackie Chan to the Western audience. He moved on to become the President of Spyglass Entertainment, producing such worldwide successes as Four Christmases, 27 Dresses, The Count of Monte Cristo and The Vow. Prior to founding Panoramic, Glickman produced Respect, the Aretha Franklin biopic starring Jennifer Hudson, and executive produced The Addams Family 2.\n\nOutside of the studio, Glickman serves on the the board of the National Archives Foundation as well as the National Board of the Story Pirates. In 2014, Glickman started the Visiting Producer Series Endowment Fund in the Department of Screen Arts & Cultures at the University of Michigan."
