        "text": "Directed by Lisa Downs (right), Life After Flash focuses on the making of the 1980 version of Flash Gordon and the impact it had on the life and the career of its lead actor, Sam J. Jones (left). The documentary chronicles the casting of the then-unknown Jones as the “Savior of the Universe,” the on-set conflicts between Jones and producer Dino De Laurentiis that led to the former’s departure prior to post-production, Jones’ struggles to land acting roles in the 2000s, and his marriage to Ramona Lynn Jones that’s led to stability in his life and a new career in security outside of Hollywood. Life After Flash also includes interviews with Flash Gordon cast members Topol, Melody Anderson, Brian Blessed, Peter Wyngarde, Richard O'Brien, and Deep Roy as well as Brian May of Queen, whose “Flash” theme song and soundtrack has contributed to expanding the film’s cult following. Life After Flash, which premiered locally during last year's Fantastic Fest, will be available on VOD on Feb. 26 and on DVD on March 26.\n\nAired: Feb. 11, 2019\n\nWeb sites:\n\nhttps://www.lifeafterflash.com\n\nhttps://www.facebook.com/lifeafterflash"
