        "text": "Introduce yourself…\n\nI work as Head of Brighton Film School, which was relaunched sixÂ years ago to offer a wideÂ range of film making courses delivered by industry professionals. I also make films – mostÂ recently Dreams are Free, which charts the life of acclaimed jazz musician Bobby Wellins.\n\nWhat inspires you to make film/ moving image?\n\nThe things that inspire me are stories.Â I’mÂ interested in telling real peopleâs stories – I feelÂ that real people are more interesting that fictional characters, and sometimes real peopleÂ have the most fantastic stories to tell, stories that youÂ wouldn’tÂ believe if you wrote themÂ down as fiction. But when they come from the mouths of real people, they sound prettyÂ incredible.\n\nHow has Brighton and Hove influenced your work?\n\nHaving lived in Brighton now for 20 years, Brighton feels like home. Also, the light isÂ fantastic, the sea, having creative people around… all of those things feed into me hopefullyÂ being a creative person.\n\nWhat advice would you give to creative people working/ looking to work in the city?\n\nBrightonâs a strange place really because itâs not the creative hub of the film and TVÂ industry – thatâs obviously London – but Brighton offers other things. It has its own creativeÂ community. Once you start to work in the local industry, you can make links with otherÂ people. Brighton is very creative – itâs a small place, and you find that everybody knowsÂ everybody. But itâs supportive, and itâs productive.\n\nWhat is the most interesting part of your job?\n\nAt Brighton Film School, the most interesting part of my job is being surprised and excitedÂ by some of the new work thatâs being produced by our students. Young people bring freshÂ ideas, and itâs interesting to see how they approach filmmaking, both fiction and factual.Â\n\nBeing at the film school also feeds into my work as a filmmaker. Iâm surrounded by creativeÂ students at the Film School, but also the fact that all my colleagues are working filmmakers.\n\nWe have writer/directors, producers, editors, art directors… My whole day is working andÂ liaising with creative people. It can only support and inspire my own ideas and creativeÂ approach.\n\nWhat is the most challenging aspect of your job?\n\nHelping my students achieve their goals and visions. My job is a management job essentiallyÂ – I manage students learning, and try to make sure that they can achieve what they set outÂ to make, so I have to sometimes say no, I have to sometimes help them achieve things thatÂ are on paper difficult to pull off. Shooting period costume dramas on farms, getting people toÂ locations, shooting in a boxing ring and making sure a whole 20-person crew is there… SoÂ itâs just helping them create and get their films together.\n\nThe challenging thing about my own filmmaking is finding time, as I work six days a weekÂ at the Film School. Plus, my own films tend to take longer to make nowadays. My lastÂ documentary took over two years, and although it has screened at festivals, there are stillÂ changes to be made, so that will make it three years… So the most challenging thing isÂ finding the time. But thereâs always time if you want to make stories.\n\nDead or alive, who are the top three people youâd most like to collaborate with?\n\nI suppose for me, the golden era of documentary filmmaking was during the 1960s inÂ America, Direct Cinema. There are some outstanding directors that inspire me, people likeÂ Fred Wiseman, D.A Pennebaker… And closer to home is Nick Broomfield, who has beenÂ making challenging, creative, original documentaries for the last 30 years, and is still aÂ working filmmaker, who inspires all documentary filmmakers.\n\nIf you could only take one film away with you on a desert island what would it be and why?\n\nI think itâs going to have to be Gimme Shelter by D.A Pennebaker.\n\nMore information about Brighton Film School can be found at brightonfilmschool.co.uk\n\nDreams Are Free has previously screened at Cinecity Brighton. You can see it this August at Chichester Film Festivals."
