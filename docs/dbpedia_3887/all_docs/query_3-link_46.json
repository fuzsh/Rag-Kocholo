        "text": "Active in the film industry for more than thirty years, Ned has been producer in one capacity or another, and previously an AD, on over fifty feature films. From ‘Apocalypto’ to’ Last of the Mohicans’, from ‘Wonderboys’ to ‘Shanghai Noon’, and from ‘GI Jane’ to ‘The 13th Warrior‘, Ned has worked with some of the best known directors of our generation.\n\nA former professional ice hockey player, he got into films by being hired as Technical Adviser on the Paul Newman picture ‘Slap Shot’ (dir. George Roy Hill, US, 1977), and after some acting roles, progressed to the 1st AD position. Working through the 1980s and early 90s on films with directors like Danny De Vito, Norman Jewison, Robert Altman, David Mamet and James L Brooks gave Ned the grounding that in turn led to a 5-year stint as Head of Production at Caravan Pictures in Los Angeles.\n\nNed is now resident in the UK and has continued to executive- and line produce feature films. With bases in both London and Dublin, he is available for work worldwide."
