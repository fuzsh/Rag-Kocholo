        "text": "Dedicate one of the decorative paver blocks that frame and define the entry from the Livermore Valley Plaza to the Bankhead Theater. Each size allows you to personalize your dedication and/or message. Once you’ve placed your order we’ll contact you to help you choose the exact message for the paver you’d like to donate.\n\nLOGO & BRICK ART\n\nPermanently commemorate a company or brand, feature your family crest or create your own custom design while supporting the arts with an engraved logo or artistic brick. The image will be etched in black on a sand-colored paver (6×12 or 12×12) or light gray granite tile (24×24). They are visible to thousands of people each year attending a variety of events and performances on the Livermore Valley Plaza and in the Bankhead Theater.\n\n24″ x 24″ – Madden Family Courtyard – $1,500\n\n12″ x 12″ – Livermore Valley Plaza $1,000\n\nLogo Art Brick – Livermore Valley Plaza $500\n\n6″ x 12″ – Livermore Valley Plaza $375\n\n6″ x 9″ – Livermore Valley Plaza $150\n\nPERSONALIZED SEATS\n\nSeat donations will be recognized by a commemorative medallion on your chosen chair in the Bankhead Theater as well as on the Donor Wall in the Lobby.\n\nGrand Tier Seats $5,000\n\nCentral Tier Seats $2,500\n\nUpper Tier Seats $1,000\n\nPlease note: donating a personalized seat does not guarantee the right to sit in that seat for a given performance.\n\nWith a legacy gift to Livermore Valley Arts, you can be sure your charitable intentions will be realized while achieving the most favorable income tax benefits available. We are happy to meet with you to talk about your intentions and situation. However, we strongly recommend you consult with your estate planning professional or tax advisor to fulfill your goals for your financial portfolio and tax needs.\n\nMaking a legacy gift to the Center also qualifies you to join the Legacy Society, a group of philanthropic and pioneering members who share a strong bond with LVPAC and a desire to ensure a meaningful, lasting home for the arts in Livermore Valley.\n\nIf you have already included LVA in your plans (or if you intend to), please let us know. Contact Chris Carter, Executive Director, at [email protected] or call (925) 583-2311.\n\nWe accept a range of planned giving options:\n\nIn Your Will\n\nThe simplest way to leave a planned gift is to make a bequest including specific language in your will or living trust naming LVA as the recipient. The following is an example of suggested language to include in your will/trust:\n\n“I give and bequeath to the Livermore Valley Performing Arts Center, a California non-profit corporation, located at 2400 First Street, Livermore, CA 94550, the sum of $____, or ______% of my estate, to be used for the accomplishment of its general purpose (or for a specific purpose as indicated).”\n\nCharitable Gift Annuities\n\nA charitable gift annuity (CGA) is the easiest way to create dependable income for life and help the Center. Please note that LVA does not administer CGAs but can recommend an administrator.\n\nCharitable Trusts\n\nA Charitable Remainder Trust or Charitable Lead Trust allows you to receive an estate or gift tax deduction and create a source of income for you or your loved ones while supporting the Center. Please note that LVA does not administer these trusts but can recommend an administrator.\n\nReal Estate/Appreciated Assets\n\nA variety of assets can be donated such as real estate, appreciated securities, and tangible personal property such as art or jewelry. Donating appreciated assets can help offset income and capital gains taxes. If you are contemplating gifting an investment property or a vacation home, a gift of real estate offers an excellent option for tax-wise giving. You can also include the Center as a beneficiary of real estate or appreciated assets in your will. Please be aware that as part of our gift acceptance policy, all gifts of real estate, appreciated assets and tangible personal property are examined on a case-by-case basis.\n\nRetirement Plan Donations or Life Insurance Policies\n\nYou can name Livermore Valley Arts as the beneficiary of your IRA, 401k or 403b retirement plan or life insurance policy. This is a simple, effective way to support the arts while reducing or eliminating significant, often unanticipated tax penalties."
