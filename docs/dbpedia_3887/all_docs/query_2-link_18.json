        "text": "Click here to read the full article.\n\nAn airy, light-filled penthouse atop a prestigious tower along L.A.’s ritzy Wilshire Corridor, owned by Spyglass Media Group co-founder Gary Barber, has come to market at nearly $6.5 million. The prolific film producer, whose dozens of credits include the money-minting thriller “The Sixth Sense” and the blockbuster cult classics “Ace Ventura: Pet Detective” and its sequel “Ace Ventura: When Nature Calls,” has owned the close-to-4,300-square-foot city-view aerie since 2003 when tax records show it traded at $3.5 million.\n\nNow co-listed with Stephen Apelian and Joyce Rey at Coldwell Banker Realty, the impressive, if somewhat dated, four-bedroom and 5.5-bathroom duplex penthouse carries homeowner fees that run more than $3,800 a month. Some of the more unique features of the generously terraced unit include a double-height living room with fireplace, automatic window shades and, in addition to a grand semicircular staircase, a private elevator between the penthouse’s two floors.\n\nMore from Variety\n\nSeth Rogen Expands His Hollywood Hills Hideaway\n\nImagine Dragons' Dan Reynolds Buys Goldie Hawn's Former Malibu Beach House\n\n'The Walking Dead' Producer David Alpert Walks Away From Hollywood Hills Home\n\nThe eat-in kitchen spills out to a large terrace though floor-to-ceiling glass sliders, and the owner’s retreat pampers with three closets and two travertine-tiled bathrooms with open views over the city. Building residents are provided with a variety of amenities, including a secured and attended lobby, a private library and separate entertaining lounge, private wine storage, tranquil gardens and a heated lap pool.\n\nAlmost two years ago, the “Seabiscuit” producer, an executive producer on the upcoming fifth installment of the sensationally successful “Scream” franchise, dropped $14 million on a city-view parcel of more than half-an-acre in Beverly Hills that, according to marketing materials from the time of the sale, transferred with plans and permits in place for an ultra-modern villa of almost 11,000 square feet. And, since 2009, when it was acquired for a mite more than $16.1 million, Barber has owned a lavish, oceanfront Mediterranean villa just north of San Diego, in the tony seaside town of La Jolla, that was briefly for sale in 2014 at not quite $27 million.\n\nLaunch Gallery: Inside Gary Barber's Los Angeles Penthouse"
