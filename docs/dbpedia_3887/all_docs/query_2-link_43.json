        "text": "Movie Review: G.I. Joe: Retaliation (2013)\n\nMovie Reviews\n\n20 responses\n\nLoud, confusing, pointless and plotless are not exactly words one likes to use in a film review, but in this case, these terms are more than an apt description of G.I. Joe: Retaliation, the second G.I. Joe movie (the Hasbro Studio generation, not the classic 1945 picture starring Robert Mitchum). And like the company’s last…\n\nMovie Review: The Vow (2012)\n\nMovie Reviews\n\nNo responses\n\nAlthough I got a review out of it (making the experience a humanitarian effort), I take great pride in knowing I’m one of the few men comfortable enough with my masculinity to see a movie like The Vow.

Enlisting the aid of Hollywood’s favorite girl-next-door…\n\nMovie Review: Evan Almighty (2007)\n\nMovie Reviews\n\n4 responses\n\nHot off the heels (if you call four years later a quick turnaround) of the successful “Bruce Almighty,” Hollywood brings to us Evan Almighty.This time however, instead of Jim Carrey carrying the load, the baton has been handed off to the new funny man of cinema — Steve Carell.
