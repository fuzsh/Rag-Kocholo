Academy Award® nominee Greg Kinnear stars in this inspiring true story about an ordinary man and his extraordinary fight against one of the most powerful corporations in the country. Dr. Robert Kearns (Kinnear) and his family are on their way to achieving the American Dream when he invents a device that can be used in every car in the world. But when an auto giant steals his idea, Robert does the unthinkable: He takes on the corporate titan in a battle nobody thinks he can win. Co-starring Alan Alda, Dermot Mulroney and Lauren Graham, it’s the remarkable, feel-good journey critics are calling “hugely entertaining!” (Pete Hammond, Hollywood.com)",

        "text": "Had the film itself come together as nicely as Kinnear's performance, there would simply be no doubt about the inevitability of an Oscar nomination for Kinnear.\n\nSeptember 7, 2020\n\nFlash of Genius is a sincere and moving work, although somewhat pedestrian.\n\nSeptember 2, 2020\n\n...many of Flash of Genius' problems stem from an overlong and padded-out running time...\n\nOctober 4, 2018\n\nKinnear is outstanding as Kearns, physically conveying the stubborn, scruffy sense of resolute ethics that drives him at the expense of almost everything else.\n\nJune 22, 2017\n\nKinnear inhabits the terrifically uncomfortable role of the rabbit staked out in a clearing to attract wolves.\n\nAugust 16, 2017\n\nAs in all films that make the questionable move of placing him front and center, Kinnear just blends in with the wallpaper.\n\nJune 21, 2017\n\nEthics is at the heart of this David and Goliath story based on fact; a powerful story with a resonant emotional punch, but the storytelling is long winded with an emphasis on detail for detail's sake\n\nJune 21, 2017"
