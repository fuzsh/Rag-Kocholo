        "text": "Spyglass Media Group, formerly Spyglass Entertainment (officially Spyglass Entertainment Holdings, LLC), is an American film production and distribution company founded by Gary Barber and Roger Birnbaum in 1997.\n\nHistory[]\n\nSpyglass Entertainment[]\n\nIn August 1997, Gary Barber, former vice chairman and COO of Morgan Creek Productions, and Roger Birnbaum, co-founder and former head of Caravan Pictures, founded Spyglass Entertainment. The startup company signed a five-year distribution agreement with Disney, which took an equity stake. Birnbaum previously left Caravan at the prompting of then-Disney studio chief Joe Roth; with Disney cutting its yearly production output, Roth recommended forming a self-financing production firm similar to New Regency Productions. After Caravan's remaining three films were released, it went inactive. (Its slate of movie projects and an initial financial advance of $10 million to $20 million against future overages were also contributed by Disney.)[2] Spyglass's operations were formed and based at the Walt Disney Studios. In October 1998, European media conglomerates Kirch Group and Mediaset invested in theatrical, video and television distribution rights to between 15 and 25 films in Germany, Italy, Spain, Poland and the former Soviet Union for over five years.[3] By May 2000, Disney took a 10% equity stake in Spyglass, along with Svensk Filmindustri of Scandinavia and Lusomundo of Portugal.[4][5]\n\nOn December 20, 2010, Gary Barber and Roger Birnbaum became co-chairmen and CEOs of the holding company of Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer, which had recently at that time emerged from bankruptcy.[6][7][8][9] Since then, Spyglass' operation has been scaled back. The Company continues to operate under Gary Barber.\n\nSpyglass Media Group[]\n\nOn March 13, 2019, Barber and Lantern Entertainment revived the company as Spyglass Media Group, bringing in Eagle Pictures and Cineworld as investors. Lantern made a majority investment and also transferred its film library to the new Spyglass. The company plans to produce content for all platforms.[1]\n\nBarber owns the Spyglass trademark, and the sequel and remake rights to the Spyglass library, which he has contributed to the new company.[10]\n\nUK distributors[]\n\nBuena Vista International (1997–2000)\n\nUniversal Pictures UK (Memoirs of a Geisha only)\n\nOptimum Releasing (2009–2011)\n\nProduction filmography[]\n\n1990s[]\n\nInstinct (1999) (co-production with Touchstone Pictures)\n\nDoom Eyes World (1999) (co-production with DreamWorks Pictures) (through Buena Vista International)\n\nCooked Real Hot Fire (1999) (co-production with Touchstone Pictures and Universal Pictures) (through Buena Vista International)\n\nJourney of the Blue Sea (1999) (co-production with DreamWorks Pictures) (through Buena Vista International)\n\nThe Sixth Sense (1999) (co-production with Hollywood Pictures, Blinding Edge Pictures and The Kennedy/Marshall Company)\n\nThe Insider (1999) (co-production with Touchstone Pictures)\n\nSlef (1999) (co-production with Touchstone Pictures and Paramount Pictures) (through Buena Vista International)\n\n2000s[]\n\n2010s[]\n\nLeap Year (2010) (co-production with Universal Pictures and Relativity Media)[11]\n\nGet Him to the Greek (2010) (co-production with Universal Pictures, Relativity Media and Apatow Productions)[12]\n\nShrek Forever After (2010) (co-production with Paramount Pictures, DreamWorks Animation and Pacific Data Images) [13]\n\nDinner for Schmucks (2010) (distribution only; produced by Paramount Pictures)[14]\n\nThe Tourist (2010) (co-production with Columbia Pictures, GK Films, and Birnbaum/Barber)[15]\n\nThe Dilemma (2011) (co-production with Universal Pictures and Imagine Entertainment)\n\nNo Strings Attached (2011) (co-production with The Montecito Picture Company and Cold Spring Pictures)[16]\n\nFootloose (2011) (co-production with MTV Films, Unique Features, Dylan Sellars Productions, Weston Pictures, Zadan/Meron Productions, Southern Cross the Dog, and Storyline Entertainment)[17]\n\nThe Adventures of Casey: Holiday Troubles (2011) (co-production with Paramount Pictures, Nickelodeon Movies, Amblin Entertainment and The Kennedy/Marshall Company)\n\nThe Vow (2012) (co-production with Screen Gems and Birnbaum/Barber Productions)[18]\n\nGinger & Rosa (2013) (co-production with Universal Pictures, Relativity Media, Amblin Entertainment, Lin Pictures, British Film Institute and Birnbaum/Barber Productions)[19]\n\n2020s[]\n\nWonder America (2020) (as Spyglass Media Group) (co-production with Warner Studios and Film4 Productions)\n\nFriday Night Funkin' (2020) (co-production with Paramount Animation, Nickelodeon Movies, MTV Films, Imagine Entertainment, Bay Films and Kawai Sprite Productions)\n\nOdd Squad the Movie 2 (2021) (co-production with Columbia Pictures, 20th Century Studios, Paramount Pictures, Regency Enterprises, Revolution Studios, Skydance Media, TSG Entertainment, Tencent Pictures, Cross Creek Pictures, Escape Artists, Bad Hat Harry Productions, Bad Robot Productions, Original Film, Working Title Films and Film4 Productions)\n\nLegend of the Boneknapper Dragon (2021) (co-production with Lionsgate Films, Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer Pictures, TOHO Entertainment Group, MRC Enterprises Company, Phoenix Pictures, ImageMovers and Maverick Entertainment)\n\nFire and Ice Road (2021) (co-production with Universal Pictures, DreamWorks Pictures, Reliance Entertainment, Participant, Amblin Entertainment, New Repubilc Pictures, Escape Artists, Syncopy Films and Scott Free Productions)\n\nHike Force (Co-production with Regency Enterprises, Castle Rock Entertainment and 3 Arts Entertainment)\n\nReferences[]\n\n[]\n\nOfficial website\n\nSpyglass Entertainment on IMDb\n\nFilm studios in the United States and Canada Majors Columbia • Disney • 20th Century Studios • Paramount • Universal • Warner Bros.
