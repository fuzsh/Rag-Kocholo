The film was released on August 1 in the United Kingdom, and has been rated 12A.\n\nDirected by Marco Schnabel. Written by Mike Myers.\n\nGuru Pitka\n\n[edit]\n\nIn my book, \"If you're happy and you know it, Think again\", I speak of the teachings of Intimacy, or Into-Me-I-See™. Intimacy is like putting your Wiener on a table and having someone say. 'Hey, That looks like a Penis, Only smaller!' [Laughs] Only Smaller...\n\nAlthough I was raised here in India, I was born in America, which is where our journey begins. It's the story of a hockey player, named Darren Roanoke. My most resistant student, who became my greatest teacher... Or some such bullshit, I don't know.\n\nDick Pants... send him in.\n\nGuru Pitka had a farm. EIEIO. And in that farm he did no harm. EIEIO.™\n\nMilk milk lemonade this is where the fudge is made\n\nBIBLE - Basic Instructions Before Leaving Earth™\n\nDon't peck my fucking eyes!\n\nBreak the pickle...tickle, tickle.\n\nMarishka Hargitay Jessica simpson.\n\nMarishka Hargitay Val Kilmer.\n\nMarishka Hargitay... Marishka Hargitay.\n\nTonight I want you to go from nowhere to NOW HERE.™\n\nIs it made out of dog? Is it a dog's tingy, am I being punk'd?\n\nIf you ever sucker punch me again, I'll kick your ass all the way back to the keebler factory.\n\nI have two tattoos. One of them is DRAMA tattoo and the other is a picture of daffy duck pushing a lawn mower through my pubes.\n\nLet's make like a baby and head out.\n\nI don't know what you're talking about. (coughs up feathers)\n\nRajneesh, I'd like an alligator soup, and make it snappy. Because alligators are snappy, and at the same time, I want it prompt.\n\nTHE ULTIMATE DISTRACTION!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!\n\nWell, it looks more like Gay Skin. (laughs)\n\nI lied. She is still with Le Coq, and he still has the biggest Weiner in history.\n\nI WANNA SING!\n\nGo Speedy. Ride like a cowboy.\n\nWhat is it you can't face? (use strong Indian accent on \"can't\")\n\nGuru Pitka's books\n\n[edit]\n\nStop hitting yourself. Stop hitting yourself. Why are you still hitting yourself?\n\nWhat's this? A dead one of these.\n\nIf you're happy and you know it think again.\n\nDoes it hurt when you do that? Don't do that.\n\nI know you are, but what am I?\n\nJacques Grande\n\n[edit]\n\nDing Dong. Did someone order the special Quebec pizza huh? You know, like in the porno.\n\nDon't look at me with that tone of voice or I will punch you in the shirt!\n\nDis is my day of lucky!\n\nRajneesh\n\n[edit]\n\n[answering cell phone] Dell Computers, this is Chip.\n\nGuru Tugginmypudha\n\n[edit]\n\nGood distraction frees us from emotional pain. Bad distraction gives you a mouth full of whizz.\n\nStudents, now I am going to teach you the \"D\" of drama. Distraction. Maurice, if Plato, Shakespeare and Einstein were talking about the meaning of life, and two elephants started humping outside, even they would rush to the window. It is the ultimate distraction.\n\nDialogue\n\n[edit]\n\nCoach Punch Cherkov: What's the capital of Thailand?\n\nGuru Pitka: Bangkok.\n\nCoach Punch Cherkov: Exactly. [punches Pitka in the crotch, chastity belt dings .\n\nPitka hunches down then doubles over covering his crotch]\n\nGuru Pitka: OH!\n\nOmar Sharif, my BALLS! OH-HOH! (drops to the ground) My balls! You prick! AUGH!!!!!!!!!!!!!! AHHH . . Ooh FUCK!\n\nCoach Punch Cherkov: Stay down, bitch.\n\nGuru Pitka: Okay.\n\nCast\n\n[edit]\n\nMike Myers - Guru Maurice Pitka / Young Pitka / Teenage Pitka / Himself\n\nJessica Alba - Jane Bullard\n\nJustin Timberlake - Jacques \"Le Coq\" Grandé\n\nRoomany Malco - Darren Roanoke\n\nMegan Good - Prudence Roanoke\n\nVerne Troyer - Coach Punch Cherkov\n\nOmid Djalili - Guru Satchabigknoba / Gagandeep Singh\n\nBen Kingsley - Guru Tugginmypudha\n\nTelma Hopkins - Lillian Roanoke\n\nManu Narayan - Rajneesh, Pitka's assistant\n\nJohn Oliver - Dick Pants\n\nStephen Colbert - Jay Kell\n\nJim Gaffigan - Trent Lueders\n\nRob Huebel - Bar Patron / Cameo\n\nDaniel Tosh - Cowboy Hat\n\nAs themselves\n\nMariska Hargitay\n\nJessica Simpson\n\nKanye West\n\nVal Kilmer (uncredited)\n\nMorgan Freeman (voice)\n\nRob Blake\n\nDeepak Chopra\n\nOprah Winfrey\n\nWikipedia has an article about:"
