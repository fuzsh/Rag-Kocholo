        "text": "Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Spyglass Media Group, LLC (“Spyglass,”) a premier entertainment company behind the successful relaunched horror franchise “Scream (2022)” and its next installment in 2023, the reinvention of “Hellraiser (2022),” the drama “The Upside,” the upcoming high school comedy “Incoming” and the iconic fashion competition series “Project Runway.”\n\nBarber’s career in entertainment spans more than three decades where he took over Metro Goldwyn Mayer Inc. in 2010 as Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, leading its impressive transformational turn-around out of bankruptcy, restoring the studio’s prominence by revitalizing its film and television businesses and posting successive years of profitability. Under Barber’s leadership, the 23rd and 24th installments of the long-running Bond franchise, “Spectre” and “Skyfall,” produced by Michael G. Wilson and Barbara Broccoli, became the two highest grossing films in franchise history. Additionally, the enduring Rocky franchise was revived with “Creed” and the studio’s impressive roster of releases and co-productions included: “The Hobbit” Trilogy, “The Magnificent Seven,” “Me Before You,” “21 Jump Street,” and “22 Jump Street.” On the television front, Barber greenlit the award-winning and critically acclaimed scripted drama series “The Handmaid’s Tale” (Hulu), “Fargo” (FX) and “Vikings” (HISTORY).\n\nIn 1998, Barber was a founding partner of Spyglass Entertainment, the globally recognized production, finance, and distribution company. Well-known for making commercial hits in a wide range of genres, Spyglass Entertainment grossed over $5 billion in worldwide box office to date and amassed more than 34 Oscar® nominations and four wins. Spyglass saw success with such films as “The Sixth Sense,” “Bruce Almighty,” “Wanted,” “Seabiscuit,” “The Vow,” “G.I. Joe: Rise of the Cobra,” “Star Trek,” “27 Dresses,” “Shanghai Noon,” and “Four Christmases,” to name a few.\n\nPrior to Spyglass, Barber served as Vice Chairman and Chief Operating Officer of Morgan Creek Productions and President of Vestron International Group."
