Witherspoon will next appear in New Line’s thriller Rendition, which is scheduled to open on Oct. 12. Vaughn’s upcoming projects include Fred Claus for Warner Bros. and the Vince Vaughn Wild West Comedy Show: Hollywood to the Heartland, from Picturehouse. (Hollywood Reporter)\n\nRitchie to direct Gamekeeper\n\nGuy Ritchie is set to direct a movie adaptation of his Virgin Comics mini-series The Gamekeeper for Warner Bros., with Joel Silver producing. Ritchie developed the concept, but Andy Diggle writes the comic, which launched a limited 10-issue run in March. The story centers on a reclusive caretaker of a Scottish estate who is supernaturally in-tune with the behavior of all animal species. When the alleged killer of his son surfaces, the caretaker finds that Europe’s urban jungle is not that different from the natural surroundings he’s accustomed to. Gamekeeper is part of Virgin’s Director’s Cut comic line, which also includes original comics from John Woo, Terry Gilliam, Shekhar Kapur, Jonathan Mostow, Ed Burns, and Nicolas Cage. Ritchie is currently shooting RocknRolla, starring Chris ”Ludacris” Bridges, Gerard Butler, Thandie Newton, and Tom Wilkinson.
