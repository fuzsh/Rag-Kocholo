He is also co-founder of Spyglass Entertainment.\n\nBarber was born in Johannesburg. He was educated at King David School, Linksfield in Johannesburg, South Africa. He then received an Accounting degree from the University of the Witwatersrand, Johannesburg. Afterwards he worked as a Chartered Accountant and Certified Public Accountant in South Africa and the United States, both with Price Waterhouse.\n\nIn 1982 the horse racing fan won a trip to the Arlington Million race in Illinois. In the same year he moved to the States, where his brother Cecil Barber was living since 1979. In the mid 1980s Barber became an US citizen.\n\nIn 1998 he and Roger Birnbaum founded Spyglass Entertainment in Los Angeles. His highest grossing film as producer was The Tourist, which grossed close to US$280 million at the worldwide box office.\n\nIn December 2010 Barber became Chief Executive Officer of Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer. Under his leadership MGM together with Eon Productions and Sony Pictures financed the successful James Bond film Skyfall, which grossed US$1,1 billion. MGM then also financed The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey, 21 Jump Street and Hansel & Gretel: Witch Hunters. MGM then finally moved forward with remakes of RoboCop and Poltergeist.\n\nBarber is also a Thoroughbred racehorse owner.
