        "text": "The 49th SOVEREIGN AWARDS, presented by The Jockey Club of Canada, were held April 18 in Woodbridge, ON at the Universal Eventspace and it was a big night for owner GARY BARBER, trainer MARK CASSE, and a litany of Casse-trained horses.\n\nThe awards were honouring the 2023 champions and outstanding horsepeople plus racing media and each attendee received a copy of a preview booklet for the upcoming “50 of the Finest” celebrating 50 of the top Canadian-bred racehorses in the last 50 years.\n\nBarber, who has been racing horses at Woodbine for almost 20 years, won his first-ever Outstanding Owner Sovereign Award Thursday night collecting 126 voting points. Barber’s Canadian totals saw him win 22 races and $1.8 million in purses and he had half a dozen horses owned solely or in partnership nominated for Sovereigns, all trained by Casse.\n\nThe South African collected the Champion 2-Year-Old Colt award for his CTHS auction purchase MY BOY PRINCE (Cairo Prince), the Sovereign for Champion 2-Year-Old Filly for WITWATERSRAND (Connect), PARAMOUNT PRINCE (Society’s Chairman), Champion 3-Year-Old Male, co-owned with Mike Langlois, ELYSIAN FIELD (Hard Spun), Champion 3-year-old filly co-owned with Team Valor, and Champion Male Turf Horse, LUCKY SCORE (Lookin at Lucky), co-owned by Eachtel and Pantofel Stable.\n\nThat was six Sovereign Award trophies for Barber and his horses.\n\nMeanwhile, Casse had a big year with his Woodbine stable and he took home his 13th straight Outstanding Trainer award and 16th overall, a remarkable. In addition to the six previously mentioned champions, Casse also trained Tracy Farmer’s FEV ROVER (Ire), named HORSE OF THE YEAR and Champion Turf Female.\n\nCasse was particularly pleased for Barber’s first Sovereign and assistant Kathryn Sullivan read a short speech from Casse for Barber:\n\n“I will never forget my first phone call with Gary in 2011, little did I know how much better he would make my and my family’s lives. Yes we have been lucky enough to win a Preakness, Breeders’ Cups, Queen’s Plates and even a King’s Plate but nothing compares to his bond with me and my family. Gary, I cannot express how much this award brings joy to me for you. If there is a person in this universe that loves horse racing more than you, I don’t know them.”\n\nFev Rover (Ire) was a work in progress after Casse got the mare in the summer of 2022. Farmer doled out $971,704 for the daughter of the Dark Angel stallion Gutaifan (Ire) at the 2021 December Mares Sale at Tattersalls. Fev Rover was a two-time winner at the time of purchase.\n\n“When Tracy was looking at buying her at the Tattersalls sale in Newmarket, he asked me, ‘how good could she be?'” said racing manager Lincoln Collins. “I said ‘maybe she could win a Grade 1’ but I wouldn’t have, in my wildest dreams, thought she would be a horse of the year.”\n\nCollins continued, “She comes from a very tough, ordinary family. She’s named after a rugby league team in a small town in northern England. She’s a scrapper, she’s a fighter, she’s not easy to train. The Casse team has done a marvelous job with her. Under sedation, when she was turned out for the first time, she jumped a fence and tried to kill herself.”\n\nFev Rover won three of six races in 2023 including the E.P. Taylor Stakes (G1) and Beverly D. Stakes (G1). She was bred by Manister House Stud. The now six-year-old mare has earnings of over $1.2 million and she collected 90 voting points for Horse of the Year, edging out Paramount Prince, 44 and Elysian Field, 32.\n\nThis year’s Sovereign Awards featured big stables and small stables, in particular on the breeding end.\n\nMy Boy Prince and Paramount Prince were both foaled in Ontario with small scale breeders. Murray Smith bred My Boy Prince and Ericka Rusnak bred the King’s Plate winner.\n\nDavid Anderson bred Woodbine Oaks winner and top three-year-old filly Elysian Field, a shining moment for Anderson who took over Anderson Farms from his late father just over a decade ago.\n\nSean and Dorothy Fitzhenry were emotional when accepting the Sovereign Award for their late broodmare Mendocino Beano, voted the Outstanding Broodmare, a lifetime award. The Fitzhenrys do not have a farm but have raised numerous top racehorses with a small broodmare band.\n\nJames Everatt, Arika Everatt-Meeuse and the late Janeane Everatt bred Lucky Score, the Male Turf Champion and the Kentucky division of Hill ‘n’ Dale Farms bred Champion Older Male, TYSON.\n\nAnd Frank Stronach was in attendance Thursday night, just about two weeks following the passing of his wife Frieda. Stronach accepted the Outstanding Breeder Award for his Adena Springs.\n\n“My wife Frieda would have enjoyed being here today but I know she is watching this from heaven. It is great to see so many people together who love horses.”\n\nJAIME ROTH accepted the Sovereign Award for LOYALTY, the Champion Female Sprinter who is now retired. Roth owns and operates LNJ Foxwoods with her parents and they co-own Loyalty with Gainesway Farm. Josie Carroll trained Loyalty for her championship season.\n\nCATHERINE DAY PHILLIPS is the trainer of the year’s Champion Older Mare Main Track, MILLIE GIRL, owned by Braconcrest, Kingfield and Apricot Valley Farms. The late-developing filly by Hard Spun from Mendocino Beano was bred by the Fitzhenrys.\n\nAnd while Frank DiGiulio and trainer Bob Tiller won five Male Sprinter Sovereign Awards with the mighty Pink Lloyd, they were back again for a new champion in their barn, PATCHES O’HOULIHAN (Reload), the 2023 Champion Male Sprinter.\n\nEarly awards\n\nSpecial Sovereign Award: ROBERT “RED” MCKENZIE\n\nAfter more than 80 years working in horse racing in Alberta, you might think that Robert ‘Red’ McKenzie has done it all. A former jockey, and then successful trainer, who has won some 1,600 races, Robert landed in the record books on the evening of June 23, 2023 when his mare Entitled Star won a claiming race at Century Mile. At the age of 96, he became the oldest trainer to saddle a winner in Canadian racing history when his mare circled the field as the longest shot on the board at 25-1.\n\nConsidering thoroughbred racing statistics are hard to come by before 1976, the official number of winners for Robert as a jockey, trainer, and owner, could be much higher than 1,600. But what is known is that the Alberta resident, who was born on January 1, 1927, was still bringing horses over to race in 2023. Robert loved horses and started riding at the age of 10 at a riding academy in Edmonton. He accompanied his father and sister to the racetrack and started riding races at bush tracks such as Ponoka, Rimbey, and Red Deer. When he turned 16 and was old enough to ride the ‘A’ tracks, he would travel throughout the Western Canada Association which included tracks in Calgary, Winnipeg, Edmonton, and Saskatoon.\n\nOutstanding Writing: JENNIFER MORRISON\n\nCat’s Long Way Home\n\nPublished December 31, 2023 on Canadian Thoroughbred.com\n\nOutstanding Photograph: JASON HALSTEAD\n\nA Kiss for Commando\n\nPublished: September 22, 2023 in The Inside Track Issue #98 and Canadian Thoroughbred\n\nOutstanding Audio Visual/Digital Broadcast: WOODBINE ENTERTAINMENT\n\nSecretariat: The Last Race\n\nAired on TSN on October 8, 2023\n\nOutstanding Groom: MICHELLE ARMATA\n\nBeing from one of the most successful racing families in Canada, horse racing is an integral part of Michelle Armata. Her father, Joe, was a trainer at Woodbine and Michelle would often visit the stable, despite being a bit scared of horses when she was\n\nyoung.\n\nMichelle studied Early Childhood Education in the latter part of her school years, working hours towards her diploma, until one day she decided her life was with horses. There was a litany of family members at Woodbine by then, including her brother Steve\n\nand sister Josie. She was in her 20s when she started working there, first for Joe, and then for Steve. “My brother and his wife Sharon taught me a lot about grooming horses,” said Michelle. “I was taught horsemanship the old school way.”\n\nAfter leaving the track to start a family – she has two children with her husband, trainer Ross Armata, Jr., – Michelle returned to work for her brother-in-law, Mike De Paulo and his wife and assistant, Josie, Michelle’s sister.\n\nOutstanding Off-track Worker: JENNIFER BUCK\n\nThe inaugural Outstanding Off-track Worker Award will be presented this evening to Jennifer Buck, who has been with Adrian Munro’s Highfield Stock Farm in Okotoks, Alberta since 2013. The Jockey Club of Canada introduced the Outstanding Off-track\n\nWorker Award as a way to honour the unsung heroes who make thoroughbred racing in Canada possible through their hard work and dedication at off-track thoroughbred racing, training, boarding, breeding, sales, and aftercare farms and facilities.\n\nJennifer, who was born in Ontario, learned to ride horses at a young age when living in Connecticut. Once settled in Alberta as a teenager, she worked for Glenview Stables and manager Brian Ferguson, a Windfields Farm alumni, learning the intricacies of farm management, from painting fences to barn care. She pursued performing arts in school at Mount Royal and worked as a fly-fishing guide on the famous Bow River, which she still does today. But the lure of horses was too strong. While raising her son Hunter, Jennifer went to work at the famed Bar None Ranches for Mike Vanin. She also had a love for working with polo horses and she played at the Calgary Polo Club before moving over to Highfield.\n\nChampion Two-year Old Female: WITWATERSRAND\n\nTrainer: Mark E.

But, it has been in the breeding shed where the Ontario-bred has really left her mark. From five foals, each of which have run and won, her progeny earnings stand at just over$1.2 million. Mendocino Beano’s highest earner is Tone Broke, who captured two-thirds of the 2019 Canadian Triple Crown and finished third in that year’s Queen’s Plate on his way to amassing over $500,000 in earnings. She also produced overnight stakes winner Stallion Heiress and the stakes-placed winner Conquest Fleetfeet.\n\nMendocino Beano (74), Sunday Affair (54), Game (FR) (31)\n\nOutstanding Breeder: ADENA SPRINGS\n\nIn Canada:\n\nStarters 42; Winners 19\n\nEarnings $1,934,913\n\nStarts 221; Wins 27; 2nd 33; 3rd 28\n\nFrank and Frieda Stronach’s legendary Adena Springs North, in Aurora, Ontario, was voted Outstanding Breeder for the 13th time in 2022, more than any other Canadian breeder in the history of the Sovereign Awards. The Adena Springs-bred star of 2023\n\nwas once again Moira, the 2022 Horse of the Year who came back at four and won the Grade 2 Canadian Stakes at Woodbine. Campaigned by Madaket Stables LLC, SF Racing LLC and X-Men Racing, Moira placed in four graded stakes at Woodbine before ending her season with an impressive third-place finish in the Grade 1 Breeders’ Cup Filly & Mare Turf at Santa Anita. Moira, by Adena’s star stallion Ghostzapper, is a finalist for Champion Female Turf Horse this evening.\n\nThe debut victory by their homebred filly Shamans Girl in the $150,000 Shady Well Stakes was a highlight. A daughter of Adena stallion Shaman Ghost, by Ghostzapper, Shamans Girl is out of the Stronachs’ Woodbine Oaks-winning mare, Ginger Brew. Adena Springs also saw Malibu Mambo finish third in the Grade 1 Pattison Canadian International.\n\nAdena Springs (85), Anderson Farms Ont. Inc.

Her impressive win total at Woodbine, 88, put her fourth in the rider standings behind reigning champion Kazushi Kimura, Sahin Civaci, and Rafael Hernandez, and ahead of champions Emma-Jayne Wilson and Patrick Husbands. Sofia also rode at Parx Racing in Bensalem, Pennsylvania. Born in Walterboro, South Carolina, and raised in horse country in Ocala, Florida, Sofia followed her father, former jockey Lazaro Vives, to the barns of dual Hall of Famer Mark Casse, who gave Sofia a leg up to start her riding career. The young rider galloped as many horses as she could each day and rode in her first race late in 2022 at Woodbine. She had just over a dozen mounts that year, winning four of them, and then embarked on a busy first year as a rookie rider.\n\nSofia Vives (162), Fraser Aebly (83), Amanda Vandermeersch (35)\n\nOutstanding Jockey: KAZUSHI KIMURA\n\nIn Canada:\n\nStarts 816; Wins 161; 2nd 158; 3rd 113\n\nEarnings $7,177,876 Stakes wins 15\n\nCanada’s riding sensation, Kazushi Kimura, won his third consecutive Sovereign Award for Outstanding Jockey only six years into his riding career. The Japanese-born jockey burst onto the scene in 2018 with 104 victories, won the Sovereign Award as Outstanding Apprentice that year and repeated in 2019. He was also the Eclipse Award Outstanding Apprentice Jockey in 2019. It has been a smooth transition for Kazushi as a journeyman and in 2023, he won more races at Woodbine than he ever has and set a personal best for purse money. He won 15 stakes races including the third jewel of Canada’s Triple Crown, the Breeders’ Stakes, aboard Chiefswood Stables Limited’s Touch’n Ride. Kazushi won graded stakes races aboard Loyalty, a contender for Champion Female Sprinter for 2023, and Wolfie’s Dynaghost and Treason, both finalists for Champion Older Main Track Male.\n\nKazushi Kimura (162), Sahin Civaci (75), Rafael Manuel Hernandez (28)\n\nChampion Female Turf Horse: FEV ROVER (IRE)\n\nTrainer: Mark E.
