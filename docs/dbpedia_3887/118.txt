GARY BARBER (Executive Producer) founded the production, finance and distribution company, Spyglass Entertainment, with partner Roger Birnbaum where he serves as Co-Chairman and CEO. The company's savvy production choices from the beginning led to the phenomenal box office success of The Sixth Sense, starring Bruce Willis, which went on to gross over $661 million and garnered six Academy Award nominations.

Another seven Academy Award nominations followed with the Russell Crowe, Al Pacino drama, The Insider, along with successes such as the M. Night Shyamalan thriller Unbreakable, The Count of Monte Cristo, with Jim Caviezel and Guy Pearce, Keeping the Faith, with Ben Stiller and Edward Norton, Shanghai Noon, with Jackie Chan and Owen Wilson, and its sequel Shanghai Knights, as well as the dynamic teaming of Al Pacino and Colin Farrell in The Recruit.

The summer of 2003 brought to theatres two co-financed movies from Spyglass, which will remain classics. Bruce Almighty, starring Jim Carrey and Jennifer Aniston, grossed over $485 million in worldwide box office and is one of the all-time blockbuster comedies. Seabiscuit, the tale of a legendary racehorse, starring Tobey Maguire, Chris Cooper, and Jeff Bridges, received seven Oscar nominations with its moving story of triumph over adversity.

Early 2005 provided back-to-back hits with the releases of The Pacifier and The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy. The Pacifier, a family comedy starring Vin Diesel, is approaching the $200 million mark in ongoing worldwide box office, while The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy, an adaptation to the Douglas Adams best-seller, was the number one picture in both U.S. and international markets opening weekend.

Spyglass recently co-financed and Barber executive-produced two tent pole pictures for 2005: The Legend of Zorro, the sequel to the 1998 smash hit, with Catherine Zeta-Jones, Antonio Banderas, and director Martin Campbell, and Memoirs of a Geisha, based on the best-selling novel, helmed by Rob Marshall (Chicago). Both were released in the fourth quarter of 2005.

2006 is shaping up to be a busy year for Spyglass with the release of The Invisible, a psychological thriller with acclaimed writer turned director David Goyer at the helm. Disney's Touchstone label will release while Spyglass will handle the international markets. This spring Spyglass will start production on the live-action feature of the beloved classic cartoon series, Underdog as well as the drama The Lookout with Oscar-nominated writer Scott Frank directing.
