If you have not been able to attend a visit day for offer holders, you can visit campus independently at any time.\n\nWe recommend downloading our app, Visit UoY, which allows you to take an outdoor, self-guided tour of our campus, narrated by our current students.\n\nDetails of how to travel to campus can be found on our transport and parking page.\n\nYou won't need to book a place at individual sessions and talks. Once you've booked a place on an Open Day, you will have access to all the talks and sessions taking place at that event. Some talks may be busy, in which case priority will be given to students before guests.\n\nYou're welcome to visit our campus at any time that suits you. Our app, Visit UoY, will allow you to take an outdoor, self-guided tour of our campus, narrated by our current students.\n\nDetails of how to travel to campus can be found on our transport and parking page.\n\nIf you would like to change your booking to the alternate date, please email us at openday@york.ac.uk and quote the reference number stated in your confirmation email.\n\nThis will allow us to cancel your current booking. You will then need to complete another booking form, selecting your preferred date.\n\nPlease note: the person who made the booking will need to be the one who emails us - we can't make booking amendment requests from a third party enquirer.\n\nIf you would like to change the subjects you have booked your Open Day for, please email us at openday@york.ac.uk and quote the reference number stated in your confirmation email.\n\nPlease note: the person who made the booking will need to be the one who emails us - we can't make booking amendment requests from a third party enquirer."
