        "text": "FAQs\n\nUnder the Act, travelers in the following categories are no longer eligible to travel or be admitted to the United States, without a waiver, under the VWP:\n\nNationals of VWP countries who have traveled to or been present in Iraq, North Korea, Syria, Iran, Sudan, Libya, Somalia, or Yemen at any time on or after March 1, 2011 (with limited exceptions); and\n\nNationals of VWP countries who are also nationals of Iraq, Syria, Iran, North Korea or Sudan.\n\nThese restrictions do not apply to VWP travelers whose presence in Iran, Iraq, North Korea, Syria, Sudan, Cuba, Libya, Somalia, or Yemen was to perform military service in the armed forces of a program country, or in order to carry out official duties as a full-time employee of the government of a program country. We recommend those individuals who have traveled to one or more of the seven countries listed above for military/official purposes bring with them appropriate documentation when traveling through a U.S. port of entry. However, these exceptions do not apply to the restriction for dual nationals of one of the subject countries (“dual national restriction”).\n\nThe vast majority of VWP-eligible travelers will not be affected by the new Act. New countries may be added to this list by designation of the Secretary of Homeland Security.\n\nThe additional/modified questions were:\n\nHave you traveled to, or been present in, Iraq, Syria, Iran, or Sudan on or after March 1, 2011?\n\nHave you ever been issued a passport (or national identity card for travel) by any other country?\n\nAre you now a citizen or national of any other country?\n\nHave you ever been a citizen or national of any other country?\n\nBased on responses to the above questions, ESTA applicants may be directed to answer additional questions concerning travel to Iraq, Syria, Iran, and Sudan and potential dual nationality.\n\nThe additional/modified questions were:\n\nHave you traveled to, or been present in, Iraq, Syria, Iran, Sudan, Libya, Somalia, or Yemen on or after March 1, 2011?\n\nCBP Global Entry program number, if applicable."
