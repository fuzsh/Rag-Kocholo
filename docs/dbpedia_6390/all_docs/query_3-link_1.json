        "text": "The name Benedict Arnold is synonymous with “traitor,” but before his betrayal of the patriots, he was an accomplished officer—although not always a happy one. At Saratoga, Arnold and his commander, Horatio Gates, had a difference of opinion about how aggressive to be in fighting off the British advance on September 19, 1777. Gates ordered his Northern Army to be patient and wait until the British got closer before launching a counterattack. Arnold argued that American troops must meet the column of British troops heading toward them. Arnold’s insistence, while perhaps not entirely welcomed by Gates, swayed his superior, and the patriots headed into battle. The Americans were able to inflict heavy casualties on the British that day, but the delay in the counterattack caused the Americans to fall back.\n\nAfter their argument at Saratoga, Gates did not give Arnold the proper credit for his actions in the battle in his report to Congress. Arnold, who performed heroically in that and other battles, felt slighted by his treatment. Gates was hailed as “the hero of Saratoga,” which infuriated Arnold. He claimed that he had unjustly been passed over for promotion by the Continental Congress and that others took credit for his accomplishments. Although Washington rectified Arnold's squabble over rank after the battles at Saratoga. Arnold's marriage to Peggy Shippen, a Loyalist, in 1779, may have pushed the already angry soldier to abandon the patriot cause. In 1780, he defected to the British side, offering to hand over the American-held fort at West Point to the Redcoats for £20,000. Had his plot worked, the British would have controlled the Hudson Valley in New York and the war would have taken a different turn. Though exposed as a traitor, Arnold avoided capture and trial by the Continental Army and served as a British officer. He and Peggy eventually left the United States to reside in London.\n\nThe Conway Cabal was a group of senior Continental Army officers who conspired to remove George Washington from command of the army and replace him with Horatio Gates. Gates had a leading role in the plot, but the leader of the movement was Brig. Gen. Thomas Conway.\n\nTrouble between Gates and Washington started after the Battle of Saratoga. Rather than inform his commander-in-chief of his victory, Gates notified Congress directly. Washington took offense and was further irritated when Gates did not promptly return troops sent to help Gates in his New York campaign. The relationship between the two men became more awkward when Gates became president of the Board of War in November 1777, effectively making him Washington’s boss. During this time, there was talk in Congress about replacing Washington with Gates.\n\nGates’s attempt to turn Congress against Washington was revealed in a letter from Thomas Conway, which was leaked by Gates’s adjutant, James Wilkinson, and relayed to Washington himself. The President of Congress, Henry Laurens, eventually saw the letter and exposed the Conway Cabal to his peers. Washington’s supporters rallied around him. Gates ended up apologizing to Washington and resigned from the Board of War. He then took command of the Southern Army, but was later removed for his role in the disastrous American defeat in the Battle of Camden."
