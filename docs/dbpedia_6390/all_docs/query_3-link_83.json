        "text": "\"Malta, where is that?\" You may have heard of the small archipelago in the Mediterranean Sea, between Sicily, Italy and North Africa, from the Netflix original, The Crown. Queen Elizabeth II lived there with her husband, Prince Philip, when they first got married while he was in the Royal Navy.\n\nWe had heard from friends that Malta is a great place to escape Ireland’s darkness for some sunshine, as they have sun 275 days out of the year. Plus, with its proximity to Italy and Mediterranean climate, we knew the food had to be great. So when Dan and I were looking for a last weekend trip of our European adventure, Malta ticked all the boxes: good food, sunshine, and a solid mix of culture and adventure.\n\nWhile I enjoyed my time in charming Malta, I just didn’t get that wow factor like I did in Italy and Greece. There truly is a reason why those countries have that “must-see” reputation while Malta isn’t on everyone’s radar. We visited in April and perhaps Malta is better suited as a summer destination when you can enjoy ocean activities. That being said, Malta has some of the most gorgeous water I’ve ever seen and the highlight by far was our day on Gozo, one of the larger islands.\n\nIn this post, I’m going to share the do’s and don’ts to help you plan your trip to Malta. Would I fly from the US or Asia just to visit Malta? Probably not, unless I've explored a lot of Europe already. Would I add Malta to my list of destinations on a European trip if I had some extra time? Yes. Would I recommend it for a great weekend getaway for my European friends? Absolutely!\n\nxx M"
