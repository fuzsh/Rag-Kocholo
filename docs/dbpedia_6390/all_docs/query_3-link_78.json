        "text": "Thinking about visiting Alaska in September, but not sure if it’s a good time to go or how to start planning?\n\nI want to preface this by saying it’s not too cold to visit Alaska in September! Vibrant fall colors, fewer crowds, unforgettable excursions, abundant wildlife, and (potentially) the Northern Lights await you in the 49th state during the shoulder season. A September trip can be an incredible experience if you know what to expect and prepare accordingly.\n\nIn this blog post, I’m sharing everything you need to know about visiting Alaska in September—from a long list of suggestions to keep you busy to what to expect weather-wise. (Keep your eyes peeled for a free packing list at the end of this post!)\n\nDisclaimer: This page may contain affiliate links where I earn a small commission at no extra cost to you.\n\nWhat You Need to Know About Visiting Alaska in September\n\nIs September the best time to visit Alaska? That depends! Many would argue that it’s hard to beat an Alaska summer (particularly June and July), and I can’t argue with that. Don’t write off a fall visit, though!\n\nAlaska puts on a spectacular show of fall colors across its dramatic landscapes. To me, experiencing fall in Alaska was worth the tradeoff for slightly less ideal weather than if I had visited during summertime. And not having to deal with bugs was a major perk!\n\nEven though we’re talking about just four weeks, weather and closures vary significantly from the beginning to the end of the month. Early September is an excellent time to visit if you want to miss the summer crowds and experience breathtaking fall foliage before businesses start to close for the season (9/15 is a common cutoff date for many businesses).\n\nIt’s only fair that I mention some cons to going during the shoulder season—namely, rain and potential closures of businesses, roads, etc. Closures will depend on when exactly you visit. Nonetheless, you can still plan an epic Alaska itinerary that highlights much of the state’s unparalleled and rugged beauty.\n\nWhy Should You Visit Alaska in September?\n\nIt’s less crowded: September is considered the shoulder season in Alaska, and it’s not as popular as June, July, and August. This is one of the primary reasons I love shoulder season/off-season travel so much! If you plan it just right, you can hit all the best spots without the crowds.\n\nIt’s cheaper: Fewer crowds AND it’s cheaper? That sounds like a win-win to me! By visiting in September, you’ll likely be able to score deals on things like lodging, rental cars, and excursions.\n\nIncredible fall colors: No matter when you visit in September, you should be able to find some beautiful fall foliage in Alaska. I was there in late September, and while it was a little late for foliage in Fairbanks and Denali (north of Anchorage), the colors in Anchorage and along the Seward and Sterling Highways were amazing.\n\nYou might see the Northern Lights: This is on everyone’s bucket list, right? It has to be dark in order for the Northern Lights to be visible, which means you won’t see them during peak season due to the long summer days. But September is a great time to see the Aurora Borealis in Alaska!\n\nThere’s still plenty to do: Just because it’s the shoulder season and most tourists have left doesn’t mean there aren’t things to do! Honestly, you can find stuff to do in Alaska during any season. Fall is a great time to hit the road, go on a wildlife cruise, hike, fish, and more!\n\nTips for Visiting Alaska in September\n\nFly into Anchorage: Anchorage is a great starting point for a fall trip to Alaska! You can pick up a rental car and start your epic adventure by heading north to areas like Talkeetna, Denali, and Fairbanks or south to destinations such as Cooper Landing, Homer, and Seward.\n\nStay for 1-2 weeks: There is so much to see/do in Alaska, so I recommend visiting for at least 1-2 weeks. Since 9/15 is a common date for more touristy-type businesses to close for the season, the first two weeks of September are an ideal time to visit. This is especially true if you’ve never been before and want to experience as much as possible!\n\nResearch/plan in advance: Alaska can be intimidating, which is why creating a plan is a good idea. Also, you may encounter closures, and it’s better to know those things in advance than find out at the last minute. Have a general idea of the route you want to take, make reservations for lodging (this is not necessary for camping in September), and plan out your excursions. This will save you from experiencing a lot of unnecessary stress!\n\nUtilize FB groups: Before my trip, I joined the Hiking in Alaska and Alaska Travel Tips Facebook Groups. Reading about other people’s experiences was extremely helpful! I also used these groups throughout my time in Alaska to get up-to-date information on hikes and road closures.\n\nPack your rain gear and layers: If you visit Alaska in September, it’s highly likely that you’re going to get rained on. There were a few sunny days throughout my September visit but lots of rain too! I expected this and embraced it. The weather may be all over the place, depending on what areas you plan to visit. Since I traveled down to Homer and up to Fairbanks, I was glad that I packed a wide variety of clothing. Check out my free Alaska packing list for a more in-depth checklist.\n\nBe flexible: I say this for a variety of reasons! If you run into an unexpected road closure or decide you would like to spend more time in a particular area, it’s nice to have some room for flexibility in your plans.\n\nDownload an Aurora forecast app: Visiting Alaska in September means you might see the Northern Lights! To increase your chances of seeing the Aurora, you need to be in the right place at the right time. TheMy Aurora Forecast & Alerts app provides helpful information such as weather conditions (clear skies improve your chances of seeing the Northern Lights) and the Kp index. The scale for the Kp index is 0-9, and the higher the better when it comes to seeing the Aurora.\n\nThings To Do in Alaska in September\n\nIf you have concerns about whether there will be things to do in Alaska during the shoulder season, don’t worry! I was impressed at just how many options there were in terms of activities—more than enough to keep me busy every day at each destination.\n\nGo on a road trip\n\nIf you’ve never been to Alaska, I think road-tripping is the way to go! Driving around is a great way to experience new places, admire the scenery, and spot wildlife. Find yourself a good road trip itinerary (or make your own), and you’ll be golden!\n\nWhether you rent a car and stay in hotels/Airbnbs or opt for a campervan rental, you really can’t go wrong. I went the campervan route and loved it, and I highly recommend River Wild Campervans.\n\nPSA: Keep your distance when traveling behind/around other vehicles in Alaska. Have you ever heard of an Alaskan windshield? That would be a cracked windshield! It’s common for vehicles to kick up rocks on roadways and cause damage to fellow drivers’ windshields.\n\nREAD MORE: Solo Female Road Trip Tips\n\nGo on a wildlife/glacier cruise in Kenai Fjords National Park\n\nJust two hours south of Anchorage, you’ll find Seward—a charming coastal town in southern AK. There is much to do in the area, but a wildlife cruise is one of the best things to do in Seward. And it’s a good rain-or-shine activity (September is the rainiest month of the year in Seward)!\n\nAs you cruise through Resurrection Bay and the Gulf of Alaska, keep your eyes peeled for whales, otters, puffins, bald eagles, and other wildlife! Resurrection Bay is a great place for whale watching, so you’re in for a treat if that’s on your bucket list.\n\nIn addition to seeing wildlife, you’ll stop by a tidewater glacier and may have the opportunity to see it calving. If you’re not familiar with glacial calving, look into it! It’s a fascinating phenomenon that occurs in nature.\n\nChase fall colors\n\nThe best place to see fall foliage in Alaska in September will depend on when exactly you visit, but you’ll be able to find signs of fall throughout the state regardless.\n\nIf you’re there in early September, you should be able to catch vibrant colors north of Anchorage in areas like Fairbanks, Denali, and Talkeetna. The Alaskan tundra turns bright red, which looks incredible against the evergreens and golden/orange trees, and stunning mountain ranges.\n\nA late September visit isn’t a bad time for fall foliage! Make your way down to Homer via the Sterling Highway or Seward via the Seward Highway, and you’ll see beautiful landscapes featuring snow-capped mountains and golden-yellow trees sprinkled amongst evergreens.\n\nLook for wildlife\n\nKeep your eyes peeled forAlaskan wildlife as you drive around and explore! Binoculars are a must for viewing wildlife. It’s Alaska, so there’s no telling what you might see. Alaska’s Big Five includes bears, moose, caribou, Dall sheep, and wolves.\n\nConsider stopping by the Alaska Wildlife Conservation Center— it’s the perfect way to see wildlife near Anchorage. This animal sanctuary takes in injured/orphaned animals and allows visitors to drive or walk through the property. You can see everything from bears and moose to smaller critters like porcupines! Click here to get your tickets online through GetYourGuide.\n\nI was bummed I didn’t see any bears while visiting in September, but the bear scat I saw while hiking tells me they were definitely around! I saw moose, otters, sea lions, and many birds (including bald eagles).\n\nWildlife in Alaska is no joke. Animals like bears and moose aren’t out to get you but will defend themselves if they feel threatened. Take safety measures, such as carrying bear spray while hiking, and familiarize yourself with what to do in case of an encounter (particularly with bears and moose). Most importantly, make sure to respect wildlife and give animals their space!\n\nVisit Denali National Park\n\nThere are a number of important things to know when planning a fall trip to Denali National Park, but I highly recommend spending some time there while visiting Alaska in September.\n\nThere’s one main road in Denali National Park. Before September 15th, you can only drive a personal vehicle to mile 15 (unless you win the Road Lottery, which you must apply for in May). Assuming you don’t win the Road Lottery, you’ll need to hop on a private bus to get past mile 15. After September 15th, however, you can drive a personal vehicle as far as the weather permits.\n\nIn late September, I was only able to get to mile 15 (the road was closed at that point due to a winter storm that had rolled in). If I’d been there just a day sooner or later in the week when they reopened the road, I would’ve been able to drive to mile 30. Check the NPS Current Conditions page for updates.\n\nIf you’re lucky, you might get to join the 30% club! Less than 30% of visitors see the tallest peak in North America (Denali) because it’s often hidden due to cloud cover. You become part of the 30% club if you’re fortunate enough to see the mountain. On my first day in the area, I saw the mountain at sunset with the thinnest cloud stretching across it. It was magical!\n\nHike in the Alaskan wilderness\n\nIf you’re an outdoor lover, you’ll be in heaven in Alaska! The hiking options in Alaska are out of this world. I’m going to highlight a few of my favorites from the areas I visited throughout my September trip.\n\nThis list is just the beginning when it comes to Alaska hiking in September! Use AllTrails to find even more recommendations.\n\nAnchorage: Flattop Mountain (one of the best things to do in Anchorage in September if you’re up for a challenge!)\n\nGirdwood: Winner Creek Trail // North Face Trail\n\nCooper Landing: Slaughter Ridge Trail\n\nHomer: Diamond Creek Trail // Homer Spit Trail\n\nSeward: Harding Icefield Trail // Tosina Creek Trail\n\nTalkeetna: Talkeetna Lake Trail\n\nDenali: Savage River Loop // Mount Healy Overlook\n\nConsider a guided hike if you’re not comfortable hiking alone or would prefer to go with someone familiar with the area! I did this the first time I visited Rocky Mountain National Park, and it was the highlight of my trip.\n\nREAD MORE: Hiking for Beginners on a Budget\n\nFly fishing on the Kenai River\n\nFly fishing in the Kenai River was one of my favorite experiences from visiting Alaska in September! I had never been fishing before this trip, but I picked up fly fishing in no time because of our knowledgeable guide.\n\nThe Kenai River is the crème de la crème when it comes to fly fishing, and I cannot recommend Cooper Landing Fishing Guide enough. They run trips for rainbow trout, king salmon, silver salmon, and sockeye salmon. What you’ll catch depends on the time of year. We booked a half-day fishing trip and caught some beautiful rainbow trout and Dolly Varden.\n\nGet an AK fishing license if you plan to go on a fishing trip. Other than that, the guides at Cooper Landing provide everything you need (rods, waders, wading boots, etc.).\n\nRide the Alaska Railroad\n\nThe Alaska Railroad is one of the best ways to experience Alaska. The railroad operates year-round, making it a great fall (or even winter) activity!\n\nYou can choose from various trains/routes (note that not all trains operate year-round), but I recommend the Coastal Classic Train from Anchorage to Seward for a fall trip. The train is the perfect way to take a day trip or a multi-day adventure to Seward.\n\nThroughout the train ride, expect to see breathtaking mountains and spectacular fall colors even into late September. Watch out for wildlife as you travel along the Turnagain Arm coast, and admire the Kenai Mountains as you continue on your southbound journey to Seward.\n\nAnother option: Fly into Anchorage > take the Coastal Classic Train to Seward > and go on an Alaska cruise out of Seward.\n\nTake a flightseeing tour\n\nThink Alaska is beautiful from the ground? An aerial view is even better! A flight tour is a pricier experience, but it’s worth splurging. I mean, when’s the next time you’re going to be in Alaska?\n\nWhat exactly you’ll see/do depends on which tour you book. Regardless, you’ll get a bird’s-eye view of Alaska’s jaw-dropping mountain ranges (and maybe some wildlife!).\n\nCheck out the Alaska State Fair\n\nThe Alaska State Fair is held yearly from August to early September in Palmer, AK, which is about an hour north of Anchorage.\n\nI wouldn’t go out of my way to go to the state fair because there’s so much more to see and do throughout the state—you have to pick and choose wisely when you’re on a tight timeline. However, it’s worth checking out if you’re looking for things to do in the Palmer area. The fair has great food, concerts, and fun exhibits.\n\nLook for the Northern Lights\n\nThe Aurora is yet another reason it’s good to be flexible throughout your trip. If the Aurora forecast is looking particularly favorable one evening, I suggest that you try to spend the night in Fairbanks.\n\nFor many reasons (low light pollution, weather conditions, etc.), Fairbanks is one of the best places to see the Northern Lights in Alaska. Click here for more information on viewing the Aurora in Fairbanks.\n\nI saw the Northern Lights in Fairbanks in December 2017 and there are really no words to describe the experience. The way the emerald/violet lights danced and put on a show was unreal!\n\nYou’re most likely to see the Northern Lights between 10 pm and 3 am. If you’re not a night owl, you may want to take an afternoon nap to make sure you can stay up late to watch for the lights.\n\nPro tip: Join the Aurora Borealis Facebook Group for reports on Aurora sightings and check the webcams on The Aurora Chasers’ website.\n\nIf you want to increase your chances of seeing the Northern Lights, consider booking a Northern Lights tour with an expert guide.\n\nBest Places to Stay in Alaska in the Shoulder Season\n\nThere’s no shortage of scenic towns to choose from—quite the opposite, which makes it hard to narrow things down. Keep scrolling for my thoughts and recommendations on the areas I’ve visited!\n\nSince September is technically the shoulder season in Alaska, you’ll likely be able to score discounted rates for your lodging! Already know where you’re going? Search for a hotel in a particular area:\n\nBooking.com\n\nAs for camping, it’s easy to find places to camp in AK during the fall if you can boondock (camp without hookups). A campervan from River Wild Campervans is the perfect way to experience Alaska during the fall because their vans are fully functional off-grid.\n\nOne thing to note: Make sure to check for campground closures. Some places allow camping in the off-season, and others are closed/gated. I like to look at the most recent Google reviews to see if there’s any helpful information. If the most recent review was four months ago, that’s probably a good indication it’s closed/inaccessible.\n\nMap of Alaska\n\nAnchorage\n\nI suggest that you fly into Anchorage to start your Alaskan adventure. This area is the most populated city in AK by far, so it has more of a city vibe than any other town on this list.\n\nWhile I wouldn’t stay in Anchorage for the duration of my trip (there’s so much more to see in AK!), it’s a great base or stopover point when traveling north to south or vice versa (such as Talkeetna to Seward). Also, the mountain views from Anchorage are 10/10.\n\nWhere to stay\n\nHotel: There are a lot of options when it comes to hotels in Anchorage, but Hotel Captain Cook is a classic hotel located downtown with clean, spacious rooms and lots of restaurants/shops within walking distance. [BOOK HERE]\n\nCampground: The Cabela’s parking lot is an option if you need a quick overnight stop. Alternatively, Eagle River Campground and Eklutna Lake Campground are both good options for camping in the Anchorage area, and they’re a bit more scenic than the Cabela’s parking lot 😉\n\nGirdwood\n\nJust 45 minutes south of Anchorage, you’ll find Girdwood. Because of Alyeska Resort, Girdwood is a popular year-round destination with a wide variety of things to do, making it the perfect destination for adventure lovers.\n\nWhere to stay\n\nHotel: The best hotel in Girdwood is a no-brainer: Alyeska Resort. At Alyeska, you’ll be surrounded by bike paths, hiking trails, a Nordic spa, and more! [BOOK HERE]\n\nCampground: Located in Chugach National Forest, Williwaw Campground offers nice campsites with beautiful views and plenty of nearby hikes.\n\nSeward\n\nSeptember is the rainiest month in this charming little coastal town, but that doesn’t mean you should skip it! Going on a wildlife cruise and stopping by Kenai Fjords National Park are musts while in the area and doable even if it’s raining.\n\nWhere to stay\n\nHotel: The Harbor 360 Hotel is a no-nonsense hotel in the heart of Seward with incredible views of Resurrection Bay and the Kenai Mountains. [BOOK HERE]\n\nCampground: It isn’t much and honestly looks more like a parking lot than a campground, but the views of Resurrection Bay from the Iditarod Campground are breathtaking.\n\nHomer\n\nHomer surprised me! I wasn’t sure what to expect, but I was floored by the beaches and mountain views. Even in September, there’s plenty to do in Homer, from exploring Kachemak Bay State Park (accessible via boat or flight from Homer) to spotting marine life while walking along the Homer Spit or Bishops Beach.\n\nYou can also get to Katmai National Park and Lake Clark National Park (both known for bear viewing tours), which are only accessible by boat or plane, from Homer.\n\nWhere to stay\n\nHotel: I don’t know about you, but I love a good bed and breakfast. The hosts always have the BEST recommendations. The Juneberry Lodge is in an excellent location (with amazing views!), and the hosts are incredibly kind. [BOOK HERE]\n\nCampground: Much like the Iditarod Campground in Seward, Mariner Park looks like a parking lot, but it is indeed a campground with epic views. If you go to the far side of the parking lot (by the water), you’ll see numbered sites with fire pits and picnic tables.\n\nTalkeetna\n\nTalkeetna is a picturesque mountain town about 2.5 hours south of Denali National Park. It’s a great halfway point between Anchorage and Denali National Park. This charming little town is a must if you plan to head north of Anchorage when visiting Alaska in September.\n\nWhere to stay\n\nHotel: Not quite a hotel, but the Talkeetna Fireweed Cabins are an excellent option in this area. The cozy cabins are tastefully furnished and include thoughtful amenities like a stocked kitchenette and outdoor furniture. [BOOK HERE]\n\nCampground: If you want to be within walking distance of Talkeetna, check out Talkeetna Camper Park (note that you’ll be next to train tracks). Alternatively, you could head north of Talkeetna and camp at Denali View South, which has pit toilets, fire pits, and picnic tables. It’s right off Parks Highway, so there is some road noise, but I didn’t find it overly bothersome.\n\nDenali National Park\n\nI contemplated whether a trip to Denali would be worth it when planning to visit Alaska in September. I decided to go for it, and I’m glad I did. Although I wish I’d been there in early/mid-September to catch more fall colors, I still had a great time in late September. It was fun to drive Denali Park Road as far as the weather permitted (mile 15) and visit the Denali sled dogs.\n\nWhere to stay\n\nHotel: Healy is the closest town to Denali National Park and where you’ll find lodging options a bit more removed from the touristy places to stay outside the park entrance. The Denali Tri-Valley Cabins are a little community of rustic, spacious cabins within 20 minutes of Denali National Park. [BOOK HERE]\n\nCampground: Shortly after entering Denali National Park, you’ll pass Riley Creek Campground on your left. It’s a nicely wooded campground in an unbeatable location on Denali Park Road. If you were visiting Alaska during summer, you’d want to make reservations to camp here; however, reservations aren’t necessary from mid-September through early May.\n\nFairbanks\n\nFairbanks is 6 hours north of Anchorage. After Anchorage, Fairbanks is the next largest city in terms of population. It’s a little out of the way but a great place for viewing the Northern Lights between August and April.\n\nWhere to stay\n\nHotel: There are plenty of hotel chains in Fairbanks, but if you want a more “Alaskan” experience, stay at Pike’s Waterfront Lodge. This rustic lodge will make you feel right at home! [BOOK HERE]\n\nCampground: Not far outside the city, you’ll find seclusion at Rosehip Campground. It’s a very peaceful place to camp along the Chena River!\n\nAlaska Weather in September\n\nWhile September certainly isn’t the worst time to visit Alaska, the weather might not be perfect. Make sure to pack your rain gear and lots of layers (more on what to pack in the next section!) as the weather can be unpredictable.\n\nNot surprisingly (since Alaska is massive), temperatures in Alaska in September vary quite a bit depending on your location. Temps in coastal towns like Seward and Homer hover around the 50s and 60s. On most days, I was comfortable in leggings and a long-sleeve shirt with a fleece or hoodie on top.\n\nAnchorage weather in September is pretty mild with lows in the 40s and highs in the 60s. If you plan to head north to places like Talkeetna, Denali National Park, and Fairbanks, expect clearer skies and slightly cooler weather (lows in the 30s). Early mornings/evenings will be chilly! Knowing what to pack when visiting Alaska in September is crucial.\n\nWhat to Pack for a Fall Trip to Alaska\n\nWondering what to wear in Alaska in September? On an average day throughout my trip, I wore waterproof boots, a beanie, leggings, waterproof hiking pants, a long-sleeve shirt, and a fleece with a rain jacket or windbreaker on top. I added/removed layers as necessary to stay comfortable.\n\nDownload my free Alaska fall packing list for my recommendations and a checklist!\n\nWhat to pack in your carry-on\n\nI keep my phone, ID, and wallet in a fanny pack for easy access while traveling. I carry the Lululemon Belt Bag, but I’m linking a dupe since that one is always sold out.\n\nTechnology: I always pack my camera gear and laptop in my carry-on, because I don’t want my technology to get damaged. I got this CALPAK backpack duffel a while back and it is the BEST carry-on bag I’ve ever owned (the fact that it’s made out of recycled materials makes it even better). It fits all my camera gear and my laptop perfectly!\n\nKindle: Traveling with my Kindle gives me something to do when I’m relaxing or don’t have service. It’s a lifesaver for long flights!\n\nHeadphones: I keep my AirPod Pros in my carry-on because they’re nice to have in airports/on flights.\n\nChargers: I tend to lose chargers, and I’ve found that keeping them in a specific pocket in my carry-on helps me keep up with them. Bring a portable charger for days when you’ll be on the go!\n\nSunglasses: These lightweight polarized sunglasses are reasonably priced and great for outdoor activities!\n\nReusable water bottle: I like to take a Nalgene with me when traveling. They’re lightweight and inexpensive. I love my Hydro Flask, but I don’t want to lose it when traveling.\n\nNeck pillow: I bought this memory foam travel pillow a few years ago and love it! It’s so comfortable and packs down pretty small.\n\nOne outfit: Having a comfy travel outfit in my carry-on makes life so much easier after a long travel day when all I want to do is go to sleep. It’s nice to be able to grab something cozy with ease rather than digging through a suitcase and trying to piece together an outfit.\n\nSmall toiletry bag: For the same reasons I like to keep a comfy outfit handy, it’s helpful to have some toiletry basics easily accessible in a small toiletry bag. Just remember these items need to comply with TSA regulations!\n\nWhat to check in your suitcase\n\nI highly recommend waterproof luggage for a fall trip to Alaska. And remember to leave a little extra room so you can bring home some goodies!\n\nShoes\n\nHiking boots: If you plan to do any hiking, take your hiking boots! Since it rains a lot during fall in Alaska, the trails can get pretty muddy so keep that in mind. I always travel with my Danner Mountain 600s.\n\nComfy shoes: Bringing a pair of comfortable slip-on shoes is a must when traveling. The Birkenstock Arizonas are my go-tos.\n\nWaterproof boots: I went on a last-minute REI run before my trip to grab these waterproof/insulated boots, and I’m so glad I did. They’re cute and super comfortable, but I recommend sizing up one size (especially if you want to be able to wear thick socks)!\n\nMake sure to pack shower shoes if you’re camping!\n\nClothing\n\nLayers: You need layers to keep you warm/dry when visiting Alaska in September. I recommend making sure that your outer shell covers your butt because rain will drip down the rain cover on your pack onto your backside. Also, size up your outer shell in case you need to stack mid-layers.\n\nBase layers – To keep your skin dry\n\nMid layer – To keep you warm\n\nOuter shell/rain jacket – To protect you from the elements\n\nLong-sleeve shirts: I recommend bringing at least three long-sleeve shirts for a one-week trip. I’ve been loving the Toad & Co Primo Long Sleeve Crew. The material is so comfortable!\n\nLeggings: I like to hike in leggings, but pack a few pairs of hiking pants (love these!) if that’s what you prefer. You won’t need anything extremely heavy-duty for a fall trip to Alaska, but you might want to bring at least one extra warm pair just in case.\n\nWaterproof pants: These waterproof pants are worth every penny for hiking in the rain. I’ve worn them through pouring rain/sleet, and they’ve kept me dry down to my base layers.\n\nWool socks: The Darn Tough Micro Crew Cushion socks will forever be my favorite socks for hiking and travel. They’re cushy and moisture-wicking!\n\nBeanie: You’ll definitely want to toss a beanie or two in your luggage for a fall trip to Alaska since it can get pretty chilly/windy.\n\nNeck gaiter: Whether you prefer a neck gaiter or scarf, pack something to keep your neck warm.\n\nGloves: I put my gloves on a few times after the sun went down. They’re 100% necessary for sitting outside and waiting on the Northern Lights. These are the best waterproof gloves that aren’t too bulky. My husband recommended them to me after using the men’s version while he lived in AK!\n\nHiking gear\n\nDay pack: A small day pack (I’d recommend something in the 24-40L range) will come in handy for hiking and exploring.\n\nRain cover: Make sure you have a rain cover for your pack (it’s basically a rain jacket for your backpack). You can buy them separately at REI if your pack didn’t come with one.\n\nHeadlamp: You may not plan on doing any hiking in the dark, but it’s still good to have a headlamp just in case.\n\nFirst aid kit: You should always carry a compact first aid kit with emergency items when hiking!\n\nQuick-drying towel: I highly recommend packing a quick-drying towel. I used mine for sitting on wet benches, drying off after rainy hikes, and showering (since I camped).\n\nOther items\n\nThis includes anything you don’t put in your small toiletry bag or stuff that’s just too big for a carry-on. Don’t forget to pack binoculars for wildlife viewing!\n\nAs I’ve mentioned several times (because I can’t emphasize this enough), layers and waterproof items are a must when visiting Alaska in September.\n\nSAVE & SHARE THIS GUIDE\n\nHave you ever been to Alaska? Let me know in the comments. I’m a big advocate for the shoulder season, but I don’t think you can go wrong no matter what time of year visit this incredible place!"
