        "text": "As social media has become a more integrated part of our lives, influencer marketing has exploded.\n\nPeople are turning to their favorite Instagram stars, Twitter personalities, and YouTubers for advice and recommendations on purchasing decisions. To get the most out of any influencer you may use, it’s crucial to build an influencer marketing strategy.\n\nSocial media has given normal people an opportunity to build their own brand through stimulating content and engagement.\n\nThese new influencers are more relatable than traditional celebrities. After all, countries across the globe are using social media platforms in one form or another. And, since more people are joining social media networks every day, companies have realized they can leverage these platforms for marketing.\n\nInfluencer marketing is a powerful brand-boosting force, and here we’re going to find out more about it with our guide on the latest insights.\n\nEssential Influencer Marketing Statistics\n\nThere are a wealth of insights to suggest that influencer marketing remains on the rise. With an ever-expanding pool of popular influencers to work with across niches, there’s never been a better time to invest in this wildly impactful branch of digital marketing. And, these stats prove it.\n\nLet's take a look at some of the most eye-popping results of these studies.\n\nHere are 20 influencer marketing stats that will surprise you.\n\n1. Gen Zers generally trust influencers more than celebrities\n\nIt's extremely difficult for brands to build the same level of trust that influencers possess, but thanks to influencer marketing that trust can be transmitted to your brand. So much so that 45% of European GenZers are more inclined to buy fashion items they’ve seen influencers wear over traditional celebrities or their peers.\n\nIn an age where there’s a huge upsurge of Gen Zers using TikTok as their primary search engine, tapping into influencer marketing to appeal to these content-hungry digital natives only seems natural. Another effect of influencer marketing is that brands don't have to waste resources promoting themselves, and instead use influencers to speak on their behalf and deliver the message they want people to hear and trust.\n\n2. More brands and marketers use AI for influencer marketing\n\nAs the adoption of autonomous technologies across sectors continues to rise, an increasing number of brands and marketers use AI for influencer marketing.\n\nAccording to Statista, 58% of marketers currently use AI technology for sourcing the right influencers for their campaigns, while 18.6% use it for sourcing and distributing relevant content. As AI adoption continues to rise, we expect to see it used more widely for influencer marketing purposes in the coming years.\n\n3. 75% of people use social media for purchasing advice\n\nThis LinkedIn statistic should be important to any brand wondering whether to invest more of their budgets in social media and influencer marketing.

If consumers feel confident about an influencer's recommendation, they are more likely to make a purchase, and even make repeat purchases. Brands are able to piggyback on the trust of influencers.\n\n5. TikTok’s Creativity platform for influencers\n\nTo encourage creators that dream of making a living from TikTok by using their unique voice and creativity, the platform launched the TikTok Creator Fund in 2020. Following controversy about its skewed payment model and low rates of remuneration, the platform has now launched the TikTok Creative Platform Beta across several nations, including the U.K, U.S, France, Brazil, Korea, Japan, and Germany.\n\nWhile in its infancy, the platform promises to offer fair rewards and a more flexible payment model to its top content creators—and this initiative is likely to attract droves of new influencers across niches.\n\n6. TikTok is the most popular Influencer Marketing Channel\n\nAs a highly influential social media channel among young digital natives, TikTok is now the most popular social media channel for branded marketing content. Now, around 66% of brands use TikTok for their influencer marketing efforts, compared to 47% on Instagram and 33% on YouTube according to The State of Influencer Marketing 2024: Benchmark Report.

The influencer marketing industry is expected to hit $24bn by 2022\n\nAs an industry, influencer marketing has expanded exponentially over the past two years. Worth just $1.7 billion in 2016, the industry is set to reach $24 billion according to Statista by the end of 2024 as the industry witnesses more growth and becomes a more effective marketplace.\n\nThis growth means more widespread use and will require marketers to evolve their approach to influencer marketing in the way campaigns are measured, create analytics to scale campaigns and look at how to manage relationships between brands and influencers.\n\n13. Most marketers with an influencer marketing program work with a pool of content creators\n\nAccording to Meltwater’s State of Social Media Report, most marketers like to work with a small pool of between one and 10 influencers within their industry or niche. This suggests that building water-tight, long-lasting relationships with influencers that offer genuine value (in terms of brand growth, increased conversions, and customer acquisition) offers the best return on marketing investment in today’s landscape.\n\n14.

In the US ad-blocking usage is 37% on laptops and 15% on mobile reported Backlinko, as consumers are tired of being hammered with pop-ups and banners. But influencers are now filling the gap. People aren't blocking videos from their favorite social media celebrities - in fact, they're eating up every word they say. Advertising power is shifting to real people and influencers.\n\n16. Marketers spend up to $100,000 - $500,000 on influencer marketing campaigns\n\nSpending on influencers has increased over the past few years, and it's only going to rise.

Visual posts appear to be the most effective forms of social media content for conversions, with Pew Research finding that 4 out of 10 consumers make a swift buying decision after engaging with an influencer marketing post.\n\n18. YouTube is catching up with Facebook\n\nWhile Facebook is still the alpha dog, YouTube is snapping at its heels particularly when it comes to making millionaires of its influencers. The platform has made celebrities and influencers of regular people (think PewDiePie and Ryan’s World), and fame is open to all age groups and demographics. There's something for everybody on YouTube, and marketers are taking notice by putting more money into influencer marketing on the platform.\n\n19. 60% of consumers are influenced by social media or a blog while shopping in-store\n\nThis changes the meaning of comparison shopping.
