Dates of National Cinema Day\n\n2025 Various\n\n2024 Various\n\n2023 Various\n\n2022 Various\n\nSummary A national holiday that aims to entice cinema-goers back to the theaters with discounted tickets. Where is National Cinema Day observed in 2024?\n\nCinema Foundation, a non-profit organization, initiated National Cinema Day in 2022.\n\nThe non-profit organization was created by the National Association of Theatre Owners. It says that the new national holiday seeks to encourage more people to go back to their movie theater-watching routine.\n\nComing to a theater near you, the Cinema Foundation welcomes moviegoers to celebrate a day at the movies with discounted admissions to kick-off National Cinema Day, September 3rd.\n\nThe one-day event, held at more than 3,000 participating locations with more than 30,000 screens, will bring together audiences of all ages to enjoy a day at the movies with exclusive previews and special in-theater promotions at a discounted admission of no more than $3. National Cinema Day celebrates a summer of record-breaking moviegoing with movies and a special sneak peek of upcoming titles from A24, Amazon Studios, Disney, Focus Features, Lionsgate, Neon, Paramount, Sony Pictures Classics, Sony, United Artists Releasing, Universal, and Warner Bros., only on September 3.\n\n“After this summer’s record-breaking return to cinemas, we wanted to do something to celebrate moviegoing,” said Cinema Foundation president Jackie Brenneman. “We’re doing it by offering a ‘thank you’ to the moviegoers that made this summer happen, and by offering an extra enticement for those who haven’t made it back yet.”\n\nBrenneman said that the idea for a national movie theater holiday was in the works well before 2020, but that the Covid-19 pandemic forced those plans to be postponed.\n\nFor more details go to National Cinema Day, and look for more announcements on Twitter at #NationalCinemaDay and your local movie theater’s website. Join millions of other moviegoers and head to a theater near you.\n\nAll events on September 7th 2024"
