        "text": "If you have plans to visit Banff in September, you are in for a real big treat. Many consider September one of the best times to visit the Canadian Rockies, including myself. While Banff is beautiful year-round, there is something majestic in the air come September. It’s honestly one of my favorite times to enjoy Banff.\n\nSummer crowds are dwindling, and hot coffee underneath the mammoth mountains surrounding you in Banff has never tasted so good. Here’s what you can expect in September, including the average weather, followed by a few great Banff itinerary ideas!\n\nThings to Know Before Visiting Banff in September\n\nWhat’s the Weather Like?\n\nSeptember in Banff is simply one word – amazing! Locals would argue it’s the best month to visit Banff and the Canadian Rockies. Why? Well, things begin to cool off slightly in September, but it’s still relatively warm… for Banff that is. Snow has yet to cover the ground, and there are still plenty of amazing things to do in Banff in the fall.\n\nThe average temperature for this month is around 18°C, but nights – as always – can feel quite cold. It’s also the start of fall. You know what that means: the town and the park change colors to a golden palette, making it a beautiful time of year to visit.\n\nThe last two weeks of September typically mean the larch trees are turning. A larch is a conifer tree native to much of the cooler temperate northern hemisphere. They are all over the park and lose their needles in autumn. Before they lose their needles, they turn a fantastic golden color that brings all the regional hikers to the trails.\n\nSeptember means kids are also back to school, meaning fewer tourists than in the summer. That doesn’t mean it’s dead; you will still have people visiting for September Long Weekend (Labor Day) and chasing the larches in late September.\n\nThings don’t truly die off until October. During larch season, some of the already popular hiking trails become even more popular, so you will still have to venture off the beaten path a bit to get some quiet time, but that’s not hard to do in Banff National Park.\n\nHiking is still in full swing in Banff in September, though you should be prepared for all sorts of weather and pay even more attention to the forecast than you would have to do in the summertime.\n\nWhat to Expect Out of a Banff September Day\n\nThe days are getting shorter in September, but there is still plenty of time to have a very long and fulfilling day in Banff. The sun rises around 7:15 a.m. in September and sets between 7:45 and 8:30 p.m., depending on the time of month. The average high is 17° C, while the low is 2° C. The earlier in the month it is, the more like summer it will still feel, while late September is very much fall weather.\n\nWhat are the Crowds Like?\n\nThe summer crowds die down slightly after Labor Day, but this is short-lived. You can expect the park to be relatively quiet after Labor Day (the first Monday in September) as kids return to school. However, once the first photos of the golden yellow larch trees start to pop up on social media around the third week of September, it’s time to brace for incoming again.\n\nWhat is a larch tree? Larches are conifers that are native to cooler temperatures. Although conifers, they are deciduous and lose their needles in the autumn. Right before they lose their needles, they turn a golden color for a few short weeks, creating a fantastic scenic landscape that people flock from around the world to see and photograph.\n\nWhen is the best time to see these larch trees? Every year is different, but typically between September 20th and October 5th is prime time – give or take a few days. Albertans are out in force on all the hiking trails enjoying the larches during these times. To escape the crowds, my best advice is to hike further and higher. See some of our favoritelarch hikes in Alberta here.\n\nCan You See the Northern Lights in Banff in September?\n\nThe northern lights are best seen in Banff between October and March. However, seeing the northern lights in September is still possible if lady luck is on your side.\n\nWhat to Pack for September\n\nA mix of summer gear and fall gear is what you should pack if you’re visiting in September. The first few weeks of September may still feel like summer. You could be wearing shorts and a T-shirt or bundled up in a down jacket and boots. This is the Rockies, after all, and the mountains promise nothing.\n\nSo pack for both instances. I’ve spent days in tank tops and days in my down jacket. The weather in September could be cold and snowy, chilly and rainy, or even sunny and warm. I know that may not help you pack light for your trip, but it’s the truth!\n\nAt the very least, we suggest you plan to visit Banff in September with a packable down jacket, hiking boots or shoes, long pants, a sweater, a rain jacket, a hat, and a buff. But also, don’t be afraid to pack lightweight shirts, shorts, and Birkenstocks.\n\nCan You Visit Lake Louise in September?\n\nYes, you can visit Lake Louise in September, and it’s a magical time to visit. Lake Louise herself is unfrozen and blue as can be. Summer tourism is slowly dwindling, but we still recommend taking the Parks Canada shuttle to Lake Louise.\n\nPlus, Lake Louise has plenty of larches in the area. Hike up high to the Big Beehive, followed by Devil’s Thumb, to get a glimpse of them. The best larch hikes around Lake Louise and Moraine Lake are around Saddleback Pass, Sheol Valley, Saddle Mountain, Sentinel Pass, and the Paradise Valley Trail.\n\nCan You Visit Moraine Lake in September?\n\nOh, can you ever visit Moraine Lake in September! Some would even say it’s the best time to visit Moraine Lake. While crowds are still there and getting to Moraine Lake is still a bit of a pain in the butt, Moraine Lake has tons of larches in the area. Particularly if you hike the path up to Larch Valley and Sentinel Pass. It’s here where thousands of larches turn golden yellow at the end of September.\n\nIf you feel energetic and are a fit and capable hiker, you can scramble up Eiffel Peak or Mount Temple. If it hasn’t snowed yet, these are some of the best Moraine Lake hikes to tackle. Enjoy Moraine Lake now, as it’s the last full month Moraine Lake Road is accessible. Come mid-October, Parks Canada shuts the road down for the season due to avalanche risk.\n\nThings To Do In Banff In September\n\nHave a Picnic at Cascade Ponds\n\nWhile there aren’t many larch trees around Cascade Ponds, plenty of Aspen turn yellow in the fall. Cascade Ponds is a fantastic place to head if you want to enjoy nature around beautiful surroundings. There are plenty of picnic benches and fire pits to enjoy with friends. We love grabbing a cooler with drinks and heading here for a day outside. You can even bring a paddleboard and paddle around the small ponds in between beverages.\n\nEnjoy Two Jack Lake\n\nJust past Cascade Ponds is Two Jack Lake, and it’s one of our favorite places to head when we want to sit by the lake and enjoy views of Mount Rundle. There are a few picnic tables here and the famous Parks Canada red chairs. It’s also possible to paddleboard or kayak out on Two Jack Lake in September.\n\nHike Healy Pass\n\nOne of the finest hikes in the Banff National Park is Healy Pass. The hike’s starting point is a short drive from the town of Banff at Sunshine Village, and it climbs a gradual pass until it unveils a pristine alpine meadow.\n\nThe meadow is resplendent for hiking and famed for wildflowers in the summer and larch trees in the fall. There are several storybook vistas in the park, but Healy Pass rivals the best of them. When the larches start to turn, hike up Healy Pass for the most spectacular views – and it’s far less crowded than Moraine Lake and Lake Louise. If you want a little extra, keep hiking to Egypt Lake.\n\nBanff Gondola\n\nA ride up the Banff Gondola to the top of Sulphur Mountain is a classic Banff experience. The eight-minute journey whisks visitors away to a panoramic ridge and boardwalk and gives them the luxury of standing atop a mountain in the Canadian Rockies without the work of hiking.\n\nWe love to recommend the scenic gondola as the views from the top of Cascade Mountain and the surrounding valley are incredible. It’s a hit with almost every visitor, and nearly everyone considers it a highlight on their trip to Banff.\n\nRead a Book at Vermilion Lakes\n\nVermilion Lakes is largely a marsh, so it doesn’t hold the brilliant blue waters like many other lakes around Banff, but it still makes for an incredible place to enjoy the park. The lakes are prime habitats for wildlife and well-known spots for birders.\n\nWe’ve seen beavers, bald eagles, owls, elk, muskrats, buffleheads, and herons. It’s also a relaxing spot to read with Mount Rundle Views ahead. The colors around Vermilion Lakes in September are what fall dreams are made of, making it my favorite time of year to head here.\n\nSunshine Gondola\n\nThe Sunshine Gondola operates the first three weeks of September before closing until the winter season. This gondola should be considered if you are looking for gondola-assisted hiking in an alpine valley with mountain views and maybe even some fall colors.\n\nThe Sunshine Gondola ride takes you to Sunshine Village, where you can access several restaurants and some beautiful hiking trails, including one to the stunning Rock Isle Lake (a highlight!). Heading up the gondola is the perfect way to spend a September day in the Rockies.\n\nStroll Through the Cascade Gardens\n\nThe Cascade Gardens at the end of Banff Ave are worth visiting while you’re in Banff. If you want an easy and relaxing thing to do in Banff in September, these gardens are for you. They are well cared for and enjoyable for all – especially if you are a flower lover. Enjoy them now – once the cold weather and snowfall, you won’t be able to enjoy them until next spring!\n\nCanoe Around the Canmore Reservoir\n\nOne of my favorite things to do in the Bow Valley is head to the Canmore Reservoir for a canoe or stand-up paddleboard. It’s one of the best places to take a device out on the water in the area as it’s incredibly wind-protected, making it smooth sailing on a kayak, paddleboard, or canoe. During September, the aspen trees turn a fantastic yellow color, providing an epic water experience under Ha Ling Peak.\n\nGo Hiking in Kananaskis Country\n\nWhile not technically in Banff, Kananaskis Country is a great place to head in September. The park is filled with larches that all turn – you guessed it – a golden yellow in the last few weeks of September. My favorite larch hikes in Kananaskis include Pocaterra Ridge, Arethusa Cirque, and Ptarmigan Cirque. See other great Kananaskis hikes here.\n\nWalk Policeman’s Creek Boardwalk in Canmore\n\nPolicemen’s Creek Boardwalk is a beautiful walk in Canmore, just off Main Street. Walk along this raised boardwalk, and you’ll see plenty of hints of color in September.\n\nPlay a Game of Disc Golf\n\nA fun thing to do in September is head to Canmore for a game of disc golf with friends. There are a few disc golf courses around the valley, but two of the best are the Three Sisters Disc Golf Course and at the Nordic Center.\n\nHike to Arnica Lake\n\nArnica Lake is a moderate hike in Banff that is less busy than other larch hikes in the area. It climbs 750 meters throughout 5km (10km round trip), with no scrambling involved. Your reward for the hike is a beautiful lake surrounded by larches in late September. For a bit more, keep going towards Twin Lakes.\n\nCycle the Bow Valley Parkway\n\nEvery year on September 1st, Parks Canada shuts a portion of the Bow Valley Parkway to vehicles. This closure is between the Fireside Day-use Area and Johnston Canyon, meaning you can cycle this part of the road without vehicles!\n\nCycling the Bow Valley Parkway is one of the best things to do in Banff in September. Avid cyclists or casual recreationalists and everyone in between can head out to the Bow Valley Parkway to enjoy the sounds of nature by bike, rollerblades, walking, etc!\n\nWe also recommend bringing a bike lock with you and stopping at Johnston Canyon for a beautiful hike. If you’d like to tackle this with a group, you can book an eBike and hike tour!\n\nStay up to date with Bow Valley Parkway closures and openings here.\n\nDrive the Icefields Parkway\n\nThe Icefields Parkway is one of the most beautiful road trips you can take in the entire world. The Icefields Parkway (Highway 93 North) connects Lake Louise with Jasper and can easily take all day (or three days) to drive! You’ll notice hints of fall along the parkway in September as you drive.\n\nThe drive is stunning, but there are many pull-offs along the way. Bow Lake, Peyto Lake, Herbert Lake, Hector Lake, Sunwapta Falls, and Athabasca Glacier are just a few (but here are ALL the amazing stops).\n\nTo make the most of driving the Icefields Parkway, I would start early before sunrise and allocate at least two days, with a stay overnight at the Glacier View Lodge – one of the best places to stay in the Rockies!\n\nGuided Glacier Walk on Athabasca Glacier\n\nThe “Ice Walk” tours across the Athabasca Glacier require advanced booking with the local tour company, and this is one of the best things to do in September before the whole operation shuts down for the season in October. We highly recommend booking an Ice Walk tour and not trying to walk on the glacier alone unless you’re experienced with glacier travel.\n\nThat being said, walking on the glacier with a guide is easy! You won’t need any technical experience; with the proper safety precautions and equipment, it’s a straightforward objective/experience for anyone of reasonable fitness. If you want to experience repelling into a crevasse, Rockaboo is the company that can do that for you.\n\nHorseback Ride Through the Valley\n\nHave you ever dreamed of horseback riding in the mountains after watching City Slickers, Yellowstone, Heartland, or pretty much any Western movie? Banff Trail Riders offers tours that offer some of the best riding in Banff.\n\nFrom one-hour to three-hour tours to multi-day tours, there are plenty of ways to enjoy the park the old-fashioned way. You can be a beginner or have ridden a horse all your life—it doesn’t matter here! September is the last month of the year that horseback tours run in the valley, and taking in the autumn scenes via horseback will leave you speechless.\n\nEnjoy a Banff Brewery\n\nThe Canadian Rockies have their fair share of good breweries. I love wearing my sweater and scarf and enjoying a cold beer by the fire at Grizzly Paw in Canmore or the new Three Bears restaurant on Bear Street.\n\nBanff Travel Tips\n\nDownload AllTrails\n\nIf you plan to do any hiking (including the hikes mentioned on this list), download AllTrails first. Alltrails gives you the latest review of a hike and all the logistical information you may need. If you pay for AllTrails Pro, you can also download offline trail maps to your phone. We use AllTrails for every hike as it gives us a good idea of what we are getting into. It’s not perfect by any means, so don’t rely on it 100%, but it’s great for getting recent trip reports.\n\nConsider Renting a Car\n\nBeing in North America, your options for transport are limited. Most visitors to Banff will rent a car in Calgary as this is the easiest way to get around. Renting a car in Banff ensures you can get to where you want to go on your schedule.\n\nDepending on your travel season, car rentals in Calgary can be affordable. We’ve rented with Enterprise for less than 35 CAD a day in the winter. However, expect prices to be higher in September. It’s best to compare car rental rates on Expedia, and book in advance and then cancel if plans change.\n\nIf you want your set of wheels, kitchen, and bed all in place, we recommend booking a campervan for your trip to the Rockies. Campervans are a popular form of travel in Banff come summertime! You can compare van rates here!\n\nOther Transport Options\n\nYou may not feel comfortable driving in Canada, and that’s okay! There are other options to get to and from Banff and around the town. However, they are limited, so keep that in mind. To get from YYC to Banff, the Banff Airporter is a good option and costs $160 (CAD) roundtrip. Once in Banff, there is the ROAM Transit system to get around town, which operates seasonal routes to Lake Louise, Johnston Canyon, and Lake Minnewanka.\n\nRutting Season\n\nSeptember is rutting season for the elk in the Canadian Rockies. This is breeding season, and the male elk can become very aggressive during this time. It’s essential to always keep your distance from bull and female elk. Never get close for a photo.\n\nPros and Cons of Visiting Banff in September\n\nWhere to Stay in Banff\n\nBudget-Friendly Places to Stay in Banff\n\nAlthough summer is winding down, rates stay fairly high on accommodation in Banff through September, especially on weekends. It’s best to book a hotel in Banff well in advance if you know you’ll be visiting. Nevertheless, there are still some great budget-friendly accommodations in the Rockies.\n\nThe Dorothy Motel\n\nBanff Rocky Mountain Resort\n\nCanmore: Pocaterra Inn\n\nIs September a Good Time to Visit Banff?\n\nI’m not sure you need much convincing to visit Banff in September! It’s my favorite time of year because you get a little of everything. Summer and fall bring maybe some rain, plenty of sunshine, and usually no wildfires.\n\nBiking is still in full swing, the hiking is simply sublime, and the crowds tend to die down just a little before October. Moraine Lake, Emerald Lake, Lake Louise, Tak Falls – everything is still accessible. I wouldn’t hesitate to book a trip to the Rockies in September!"
