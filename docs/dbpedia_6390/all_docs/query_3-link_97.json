        "text": "As this part of France is famed for its 300+ days of sun per year, it’s obvious why it’s become such an attractive place. Still, some periods of the year are better than others for visiting and some are best avoided outright.\n\nHigh season (summer)\n\nHigh season in the French Riviera officially runs from July thru August, but it’s really from June 1st to the middle of September. These 3-3.5 months (June through early September) are the most expensive time of year to visit and also the most crowded. Many towns and beaches become overrun and it’s not very relaxing to be here.\n\nAdd to this picture extreme heat, crowded beaches, long lines, and the real likelihood of getting turned away from full restaurants and you do not wind up with such a paradisiacal vacation.\n\nLow season (winter)\n\nI would also suggest avoiding winter - from mid November November to the middle of February the weather is not ideal. This is the coldest period of the year and although the Riviera is a mostly frost-free region, strong cold winds can make going out unpleasant.\n\nIf you’re up for a mid winter visit, know that there are seasonal festivals already starting in the middle of February, like the lemon festival in Menton. You can also enjoy the mimosa flowers which bloom along the coast then.\n\nShoulder season (spring/fall)\n\nThe French Riviera is so popular that there is not really a low season anymore, but you do have fewer crowds in the shoulder season periods of late winter/spring and fall.\n\nFor me, the best time to visit the Riviera is in these shoulder season periods of mid-spring and mid-fall. Even so, do not expect to find no crowds and no one else around. There will be plenty of other visitors.\n\nIn spring, from March the temperatures begin to become pleasant, the threat of rain has almost passed, and things start opening up.\n\nLikewise, the fall presents fewer crowds, more reasonable prices, and still good weather for swimming, sailing, hiking, and anything else you’d like to do.\n\nIn autumn, there is a sailing event in Saint-Tropez at the end of September where you can admire both old and modern boats while inland the vines and grapes take on their beautiful fall colors.\n\nSwimming season runs from May through September, there is always something to do, and the light is great from early spring through late fall, so there really is no bad time to visit.\n\nRenting a car\n\nThe ideal way to get around the French Riviera is by car. I would strongly suggest you rent one.\n\nThis is an area full of small roads and little villages, and buses and trains won’t take you to many places that you’ll want to visit. Also, driving the coastal route can be very enjoyable and the car will give you the flexibility to make stops all along your routes.\n\nThe easiest place to get your rental car is directly at the airport in Nice. You have 7 of the world’s main rental car company chains located on the airport grounds as well as many local and secondary options which may be a bit cheaper.\n\nTo rent a car you need an international driving license and a credit card. You may not be asked for the IDL, but you should have it just in case as it is legally required. If you don’t have a credit card, you may find a company that will let you rent with a debit card, but that is very unlikely.\n\nWhere to find a car rental\n\nYou have all the big international companies in France (and the Riviera) as well as lots of smaller, local companies.\n\nFor the most selection of cars and companies, renting your car in Nice is always a good idea. It’s the biggest city on the Riviera and has an international airport and busy train station. If you want to save some money, be sure to look at rentals in the city center in addition to the airport.\n\nYou also have rental agencies in Cannes, Antibes, Saint-Tropez (though very few), Sainte Maxime (also very few), and a few other towns.\n\nTo check prices and book, I recommend using DiscoverCars, a car rental website that includes offerings from all the major international rental companies as well as lots of smaller local agencies, which often have much better pricing. You can often find great deals.\n\nI use it myself and have always had good experiences.\n\nPublic transportation\n\nBuses\n\nThere is a good network of buses in the French Riviera connecting all the main towns and within cities like Nice, Menton, Antibes, Monaco, or Cannes. Locals use these buses all year, so the routes are fairly extensive and frequent.\n\nA couple of different companies operate the routes, but the main two are Lignes d’Azur and Zou.\n\nBus tickets can be purchased at bus stations, ticket kiosks/vending machines, directly aboard the bus, and on the Lignes d’Azur mobile app. Single use tickets cost 1.50 euro, but you can also buy unlimited use 1-day passes (5 euro) or an unlimited use 7-day pass (20 euro).\n\nRemember that you must validate bus tickets.\n\nTrain\n\nTraveling around the Riviera by train is a viable option as most of the coastal towns have a stop. That is not the case for inland towns, however.\n\nThe train is called the TER (Express Regional Train) and in high season it can be a much better option than buses as you won’t get stuck in heavy traffic.\n\nTrains are operated by the French national rail service, Société Nationale des Chemins de Fer Français (SNCF). You can purchase tickets directly on their website or in-person at any train station\n\nIf you plan on using the train, make sure you check to see where exactly the stop is for any given down. The geography of the Riviera doesn’t always allow railways to get close to the sea, where the towns are located, so sometimes your stop will actually be quite far from where you ultimately want to go, requiring a bus or taxi ride (or a very long walk).\n\nAs time is precious, especially in an area like the French Riviera, you need to consider whether the train and bus will eat up too much of your time. While either can be good options for a day trip or two to another town, trying to plan a week or more of moving around the Riviera by public transport will inevitably mean you lose quite a bit of time.\n\nIf you’re the type of traveler who likes to pack multiple places and stops into a single day, public transport is frankly not a good option.\n\nWhere to buy train & bus tickets\n\nIn general, I recommend booking your public transport tickets directly with the service provider. That said, when you have a lot of options or when you’re not familiar with the different companies, it can be a hassle to look them all up in order to compare routes and prices.\n\nOmio is an aggregator I like that shows options for public transport routes all over the world. When you do a search, you’ll be able to see all your options for trains, buses, flights, and even ferries along with a host of different companies that provide the services.\n\nUnfortunately, the reality is that the French Riviera is quite an expensive place to vacation, one of the most expensive in Europe. If you go to touristy or high-end places, you will invariably find yourself spending a small fortune, even for a simple meal or just a drink.\n\nTo avoid this, look for where locals go to eat and drink - we are not all rich and famous so if you see us somewhere you know two things are certain; the food is good and it’s affordable.\n\nFor accommodations, there’s not much you can do. They’re a bit pricey. Try to find local B&Bs, guesthouses, serviced flats, and small local hotels. These can all be relatively good deals compared to big hotel chains.\n\nSome travelers try to stay over the border in Italy to save money, and while you may find cheaper hotels, you’ll just spend more on gas and lose precious time.\n\nIn general, hotels in the towns along the coast are more expensive, while inland towns have better prices.\n\nHotel prices\n\nHere’s what you should expect to pay for standard (think 3-star) accommodation during the high season (1st June to 30th September):\n\nFrom 200€ for 2 adults / night, breakfast included, in a standard hotel.\n\nFrom 250€ for 2 adults / night in an aparthotel.\n\nFrom 300€ for 2 adults / night in a 35m2 holiday studio.\n\nFrom 300€ for 2 adults / night in a B&B.\n\nIn shoulder/low seasons hotel prices don’t drop very much, but prices for other types of accommodation do:\n\nFrom 115€ for 2 adults per night in a 35m2 studio\n\nFrom 140€ for 2 adults per night in an aparthotel.\n\nFrom 140€ for 2 adults per night in a B&B.\n\nPrices for meals and drinks\n\nUsually restaurants will offer a fixed price set menu, mainly at lunch time, where coffee and desert and/or a drink are included along with your meal. You can expect to pay from 25€ per person. Dishes on menus can change every day as they are mainly plat du jour (dish of the day).\n\nIf a restaurant has a speciality dish served all year round that you want to try, you will find it in “la carte” (the regular menu). Here prices may change a lot from one restaurant to another. And some are real tourist traps.\n\nSo, as I suggested already, look where locals eat. You’ll find more local restaurants usually in small streets, side streets, or a little ways outside of the touristic zone.\n\nOr, for lunch, if you want to really eat like a local, head to the local market and then to the bakery.\n\nAt the market, you can source cuts of cured meats, cheeses, and fruits/veggies.\n\nThen at the bakery, you can get the famous baguette, a slice of pissaladière (bread dough topped with melted onions, anchovies, and black olives - a typical dish of Nice) and also something sweet for dessert.\n\nSome markets have free tables outside where you can put together your little feast and grab a drink, but if not you can just head to a park for an impromptu picnic.\n\nSuch a picnic lunch is a cheap option to have a real taste of local food and will usually cost you around 20€ for the meal, for two.\n\nCar rental costs\n\nLike airplane tickets, car rental prices differ depending on the season and the duration of your visit. Expect for prices to be highest during the high season (June thru September), during French spring school holidays, and around all public holidays in the month of May.\n\nCar rentals can cost over 100€ a day in August, or around 600€ for a 7-day rental. It will cost you only around 250€ for the same car for 7 days in the last week of September and any other times outside of the summer high season (and potentially even less).\n\nPublic transport costs\n\nMost of the year the cost of a bus or train ticket will depend on the route, i.e. where you’re starting and where you’re going.\n\nHowever, during the high season (June thru September), you have the options of purchasing public transport packages for both bus and train. These are mostly daily passes that give you unlimited rides.\n\nFor the train, there is a pass that costs 16€ per day per person. You can ride as many times as you’d like.\n\nFo the bus, prices vary depending on the town and the bus company, but you can often find unlimited ride options for 5€ per day.\n\nTours and sites\n\nLots of activities on the Riviera have costs associated with them, such as museums, villas, gardens, and exhibitions. For most of them, entrance tickets cost under 10 euros and there are usually discounted prices for children under the age of 12.\n\nFor large groups, many places offer special prices. You can find the details on their websites.\n\nGuides tours are not usually exorbitantly expensive, especially if you opt for small group tours. I’ve listed a few tours below to give you an idea on what things might cost.\n\nSailing: A round trip boat ride from Nice to Saint-Tropez on a large shared boat costs 85€/person.\n\nHop-on, hop-off bus: In Nice this bus costs 23€/person.\n\nBoat trips: Ferry transfer from Nice to Sainte-Marguerite Island (part of the Lérins) costs from 49€/person. Boat tours to beaches with swimming stops cost anywhere from 60 euros to 200 euros per person depending on size and tour duration.\n\nPrivate guides: A half-day, private walking tour (3-4 hours) with a local guide will cost you somewhere in the realm of 250-350 euros. A full-day tour (8 hours) where the guide also drives you to different places usually starts at around 600 euros.\n\nBecause of the famed light here (and it really is wonderful), artists, painters mostly, and writers started to settle on the Riviera beginning in the late 1800s. Heavyweights like Picasso, Chagall, Matisse, and Renoir all came here to paint the idyllic coastal and country scenes and enjoy life.\n\nSculptors, filmmakers and movie stars, royals, and business tycoons also caught on and have been visiting and vacationing here for over 100 years. Many of them either built, renovated, or expanded, those lovely villas that you can now visit.\n\nThe presence of all these people from high society, but especially the artists, means that the French Riviera, which on first glance would appear to be just a beach destination, actually has a ton of things to do that don’t involve being on or near the water.\n\nThere are countless museums, cultural centers, exhibitions, galleries, fairs, events, and crafts studios to visit. And for more active pursuits, there is great walking, hiking, and cycling all over the region.\n\nWhen visiting the French Riviera, the best thing to do is alternate activities between beach time, culture, sport, and pure relaxing.\n\nExperience the culture\n\nThe French Riviera has so much to offer in many cultural fields. It is impossible to make a list of everything, but here is a sample I chose to share with you to give you a good understanding of what awaits.\n\nIf you like arts and crafts, then you will have to visit at least one of these little towns:\n\nPottery\n\nIn Vallauris, a town known for its pottery, you can visit the ceramic museum and the pottery museum. After that, there are also many historical places to see in town. Pablo Picasso worked here later in his life actually making pottery, so this is a great spot to see some of his work.\n\nBlown glass\n\nThe town of Biot is a center of glass blowing. Visitors can visit the glass factories and watch a master glassmaker work directly in front of them. For more to do, the Fernand Léger National Museum and lots of local art galleries and exhibitions can complete your visit to this pretty town.\n\nGardens\n\nIn the village of Eze, you can combine a wander in a great medieval village with a visit to a botanical garden from which you’ll be able to admire the whole French Riviera above, with views stretching to the Italian Riviera on the east and off to Saint-Tropez on the west.\n\nArchitecture, museums, & villas\n\nMost of the main towns, from Menton at the Italian border all the way to Cannes have interesting architecture to look at, charming streets to walk on, monuments from different eras, and intricate Catholic and Orthodox churches.\n\nMost of the larger cities have good museums, usually dedicated to a specific artist who lived there, or to local traditions, history, or a specific art movement.\n\nLarger towns will have beautiful villas and accompanying gardens which open their doors to visitors.\n\nMarkets\n\nMarkets are a feature of life everywhere in France and they are always a pleasure for visitors. Almost every town in France will have at least a weekly market and some towns will have multiple different markets that open on various days.\n\nThey’re great for eating, shopping, browsing, and buying souvenirs!\n\nRelax on the beaches and the sea\n\nNo visit to the French Riviera would be complete without some time at the beach.\n\nSome are private, which means you will have to pay a fee, while others are of course public. When you pay at a private beach, you’ll have an umbrella, beach chair, and some facilities included in the cost. For public beaches, you’ll need to bring anything you want on the beach.\n\nBefore coming, you should know that you won’t really find any fine sand beaches on the Riviera. Most beaches are a mix of gravely sand or pebbles.\n\nTo get out onto the water, you have plenty of options for boat trips/cruises that last from 2 hours to 9 hours. Tours do all different things - go deep out to see, take you beach hoping, transport you to different coastal towns, or take you out to islands like the Lérins.\n\nGet active and enjoy the outdoors\n\nBecause of its natural environment, the French Riviera is an excellent location for outdoor activities, both on land and sea.\n\nYou can find the typical beach/nautical sports like swimming, scuba diving, paddle boarding, skate surfing, jet skis, sailing, etc.\n\nOr on land you can go for a hike on any of the many marked routes and trails that start in towns all along the coast. They’ll take you to beautiful viewpoints, deep into forests, and to secluded beaches for amazing swims.\n\nIf you like golf, there are a host of golf courses, many of which are in stunning locations. It can be hard to focus on the golf at times!"
