        "text": "ALERT: The Department of Homeland Security has extended the validity of certain Employment Authorization Documents (EADs) issued to Temporary Protected Status (TPS) beneficiaries under the designations of El Salvador, Honduras, Nepal, Nicaragua, and Sudan through March 9, 2025. We will send a Form I-797, Notice of Action, notifying you if you are affected by this extension.\n\nIf you are currently a TPS beneficiary under the El Salvador designation, and you have not yet re-registered for TPS under the most recent extension for that designation, you must submit Form I-821, Application for Temporary Protected Status, during the current re-registration period to keep your TPS benefits.\n\nThe re-registration period under the TPS designation of El Salvador now runs through March 9, 2025. For more information, please see the Federal Register notice.\n\nAlert: Before sending your package to USCIS, make sure that all the forms you have completed are the current acceptable edition. USCIS published new editions for most forms on April 1, 2024. If you downloaded or printed your forms before April 1, you should verify the current edition date, because we will no longer accept a prior edition. The current acceptable edition can be found under the Edition Date section listed on each form’s webpage.\n\nYou can also find the edition date at the bottom of the page on the form and instructions. For each form that you are submitting, make sure that all pages are from the same form edition. If any of the form’s pages are from a different form edition, we may reject your form. Watch USCIS Forms: Download the most recent version! to see how to ensure your form is acceptable.\n\nFor additional guidance on filing paper-based forms at the Lockbox and how to avoid or correct common errors before you file, please visit the Five Steps to File at the USCIS Lockbox webpage.\n\nIf you are a TPS El Salvador beneficiary who applied for a new EAD but have not yet received it, you are also covered by this automatic extension as long as the EAD that you have contains 1 of the expiration dates noted in the chart above.. You may show your EAD with category A12 or C19 and 1 of the EAD expiration dates above, along with the NOTICE OF CONTINUED EVIDENCE OF WORK AUTHORIZATION, as proof of continued employment authorization through March 9, 2025, to U.S. employers and benefit and license granting agencies."
