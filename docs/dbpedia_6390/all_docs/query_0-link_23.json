        "text": "The 'Blitz' – from the German term Blitzkrieg ('lightning war') – was the sustained campaign of aerial bombing attacks on British towns and cities carried out by the Luftwaffe (German Air Force) from September 1940 until May 1941.\n\nThe Blitz began on 7 September, 'Black Saturday', when German bombers attacked London, leaving 430 dead and 1,600 injured. London was then bombed for 57 consecutive nights, and often during daytime too. London experienced regular attacks and on 10-11 May 1941 was hit by its biggest raid. German bombers dropped 711 tons of high explosive and 2,393 incendiaries. 1,436 civilians were killed. However, this proved to be the last major raid until January 1943.\n\nWhile London was bombed more heavily and more often than anywhere else in Britain, the Blitz was an attack on the whole country. Very few areas were left untouched by air raids. In relatively small compact cities, the impact of a severe air raid could be devastating.\n\nFrom mid-November 1940, major provincial cities and industrial centres were targeted. In early 1941 another wave of attacks began, primarily against ports. Respite finally came from June when much of the Luftwaffe was directed against Russia and targets in the Mediterranean.\n\nIn these nine months, over 43,500 civilians were killed. This is how the Blitz affected towns and cities across the United Kingdom.\n\nLiverpool\n\nDuring 1940, Liverpool and the rest of Merseyside was the most bombed area outside London. On 28-29 November it was hit by 350 tons of high explosive bombs. From 20-23 December, Merseyside was hit on consecutive nights. While the city’s docks were the main target, the surrounding streets of terraced houses, which housed the dock workers and their families, were also devastated. During the first eight days of May 1941, Merseyside was bombed almost every night. 1,900 people were killed, 1,450 seriously wounded and 70,000 made homeless. In Bootle, 8,000 out of 17,000 houses were destroyed or damaged during the Blitz. This photograph, taken in 1942, shows the extent of bomb damage in the city. The Liver Building can be seen just to the right of centre, and the River Mersey is just visible to the left of the photograph.\n\nThe North East of England was targeted during early 1941. The vital east coast port of Hull suffered two heavy raids in March and then was badly hit again on 8-9 May. The whole of the riverside quay was devastated by fire. 450 people were killed and 10% of the population made homeless. Hull was bombed again in June after the worst of the Blitz was thought to be over. For security reasons, news reports on air raids usually referred to Hull not by name but as a 'north east town'. This meant that many people were unaware how badly the town suffered in the Blitz."
