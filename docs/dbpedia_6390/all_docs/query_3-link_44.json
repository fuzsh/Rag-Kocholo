        "text": "Sadly, I am old enough to remember the day in October 1987 when global equity markets crashed. On that day, October 19, also known as Black Friday, the Dow Jones average fell 22.6%. By the end of that day, there was a widespread belief that the crash would precipitate a recession. Fear was in the air as investors worried that this was a repeat of 1929, when a crash did precipitate the Great Depression. It never happened. Instead, the market recovered while the economy continued to grow.\n\nThat experience is what comes to mind this time around. US and global equities fell sharply, oil prices fell, the dollar fell 2.7% against the yen, and the US 10-year Treasury bond yield fell to a one-year low. Should we be worried? Not necessarily.\n\nFirst, the jobs numbers showed a slowdown in job growth, not a catastrophe. Some analysts pointed to the fact that the so-called Sahm Rule had been triggered, due to a sharp rise in the unemployment rate. The Sahm Rule is very simply based on how fast the unemployment rate is rising. Economist Claudia Sahm found that, in the past when the three-month average of the unemployment rate exceeded the lowest rate of the last 12 months by more than 0.5 percentage points, it meant that a recession had begun. Yet the rule is not a law of physics. Rather, it is a consistent pattern. Yet Dr. Sahm herself said that, given the unusual economic trends of the post-pandemic period, a triggering of her rule might simply be a false positive.\n\nSecond, on a day when investors were evidently panicking about the state of the US economy, the Institute of Supply Management (ISM) reported that its purchasing manager’s index (PMI) for US services increased from 48.8 in June to 51.4 in July, indicating growing activity. PMIs are meant to be forward-looking indicators. Thus, the rise in the PMI is a sign of a likely rebound in services activity.\n\nThird, it was reported that, on August 5, investors were having difficulty gaining access to online trading platforms operated by brokerage firms. This suggests that fearful investors were struggling to unwind their positions. Selloffs beget selloffs. This has happened before. Generally, those who sat on their assets ultimately profited. This also reminds us that asset markets tend to overshoot before reverting to trend.\n\nFourth, there were reports that the market selloff was exacerbated by the continuing unwinding of the Japanese carry trade. This trade involves borrowing in yen to purchase higher-yielding assets outside of Japan, and then selling those assets and paying off the yen debt. Once the Bank of Japan (BOJ) signaled the start of a significant tightening of monetary policy, the yen started to rise in value, thereby reducing the incentive to engage in the carry trade. Moreover, some nervous investors have been unwinding their carry trade positions, thereby putting upward pressure on the yen and downward pressure on the value of non-Japanese assets. Plus, the sharp rise in the yen has spooked holders of Japanese equities. In fact, Japanese equities fell 12% on August 5, the biggest decline since 1987.\n\nFifth, the selloff involved a very sharp decline in the prices of several key technology company stocks, especially those heavily investing in gen AI. One could argue that the tech bubble has burst following an unusually strong rise in the values of these stock. Yet the bursting of a bubble does not necessarily imply an imminent recession.\n\nSixth, the selloff may reflect fear that the US Federal Reserve waited too long to start cutting interest rates, thereby boosting the likelihood of a recession. Yet the futures markets now tell us that investors are expecting aggressive action by the Fed. In fact, they are pricing in a 25% probability that the Fed will take emergency action before the September meeting. And they are pricing in 125 basis points of interest-rate cuts before the end of the year. Such an aggressive action would likely lead to a sharp rebound in asset prices. It would also set the stage for a sharp increase in transactions. In fact, it’s reported that leading private equity (PE) firms have significantly increased the amount of funds deployed. Plus, they are sitting on a vast pool of “dry powder” that they intend to deploy as interest rates start to come down. Thus, there’s reason to expect a surge in M&A activity following the recent hiatus. As the head of one large PE firm said, “The deal market is back.”\n\nNone of this is to say that a recession is impossible. Rather, the point is that the rout in asset prices in the week of August 5 was not necessarily a predictor of a downturn. It could simply be a correction involving an intensification of volatility.\n\nIndeed, US and Japanese equity prices rebounded sharply last Tuesday and markets were more stable for the remainder of the week. US traders were likely relieved that initial claims for unemployment insurance declined sharply in the week ending August 3. This suggests the possibility that the US job market is not so bad after all. Japanese traders were likely relieved that the BOJ signaled concern about the unwinding of the carry trade and appeared willing to take that into account in its deliberations about interest rates. Meanwhile, bond yields recovered, oil prices were up, and the US dollar recovered against the British pound and the Japanese yen.\n\nDoes this mean that the worst is behind us? Although market corrections happen periodically, they always seem to unnerve everyone, leading to concerns that something awful is about to happen. In this case, expectations for a US recession increased suddenly, even though underlying factors suggest otherwise.\n\nEven now, nearly a week after the volatility began, I am still asked by clients if a further downturn in equities should be expected. The answer is: No one knows. But there’s no fundamental economic reason to expect that. In fact, if investors expect a sharp reduction in interest rates by the Fed (which they do), then this should be good for the equity market. Indeed, the rebound in equities is likely related to such expectations.\n\nIn any event, measures of volatility have eased substantially, asset prices have mostly recovered, as least partly, and the economic fundamentals have not changed. Thus, it seems safe to say that the crisis is over, or at least the perception of a crisis. After all, there was not really a crisis.\n\nRegarding Japan, equities recovered while the currency depreciated after the Deputy Governor of the BOJ said that interest rates will not be increased while markets are unstable. He said, “As we're seeing sharp volatility in domestic and overseas financial markets, it’s necessary to maintain current levels of monetary easing for the time being. Personally, I see more factors popping up that require us being cautious about raising interest rates.” This evidently satisfied nervous traders and created an impression of calm. Does this mean that the BOJ will refrain from further rate hikes? It’s not clear. Still, uncertainty about this could mean further unwinding of the carry trade, thereby putting upward pressure on the yen. That, in turn, could hurt Japanese equity prices.\n\nInvestors revise expectations for Fed policy\n\nDid the Federal Reserve wait too long to start cutting interest rates? That could be what many investors were thinking following an especially weak jobs report last week. There was significant volatility in financial markets. On one day, the yield on the 10-year bond fell 18 basis points to the lowest level seen since December 2023. The S&P 500 index of equities was down 2.3%, with an especially sharp decline in the values of some tech stocks and sharp declines in overseas equity markets. The value of the dollar fell 1.6% against the Japanese yen and fell strongly against other currencies. Finally, the price of Brent crude fell by 3.4%.\n\nFutures markets tell us that, up until recently, many investors believed the Fed will cut the benchmark interest rate by 100 basis points before the end of the year, including a 72.5% chance of a 50-basis-point cut in September. All this was in response to a jobs report that showed the second smallest increase in employment since 2020 and the highest unemployment rate since October 2021. Still, job growth was not poor. Moreover, the rise in the unemployment rate was largely due to a rise in labor force participation, not mass layoffs.\n\nCould investors be overreacting? Possibly, but the reality is that, with inflation having receded, real (inflation-adjusted) interest rates have risen and could be having a negative impact on economic activity. In his comments earlier last week, Fed Chair Powell said, “I would not like to see material further cooling in the labor market. If we see something that looks like a more significant downturn, that would be something that we would have the intention of responding to.” Investors in recent days indicated that they expect Powell to respond.\n\nLet’s examine the details of the jobs report. The US government releases an employment report that has two components: One is based on a survey of establishments; the other on a survey of households. The establishment survey found that 114,000 new jobs were created in July, the second smallest number since early in the pandemic. There was a decline in employment in information, financial services, and professional and business services. The only industries that saw strong job growth were construction, health care, and leisure and hospitality.\n\nMeanwhile, the establishment survey reported on wage behavior. Specifically, it found that average hourly earnings of workers were up 3.6% in July versus a year earlier, the smallest increase since May 2021, and were up only 0.2% from the previous month. Although wages are still rising faster than inflation, the deceleration of wages is good news from an inflation perspective. It is consistent with a weakening of the job market.\n\nFinally, the separate survey of households found that the number of people participating in the labor force increased much more than the rise in the working-age population. Thus, with a modest increase in employment, the unemployment rate rose from 4.1% in June to 4.3% in July, a nearly three-year high. However, the sharp rise in participation suggests confidence in the availability of jobs.\n\nIn the business press, the word “recession” appeared last week with greater frequency. Could we face a US recession in the coming months? There are some negative indicators: The slowdown in the job market and the rise in the unemployment rate, a decline in new orders for manufacturing according to a survey by ISM, weak new orders for durable goods, and a rise in credit card delinquencies. On the other hand, consumer spending and business investment have both remained strong while job growth is still at a speed that is consistent with moderate economic growth. Thus, there remains uncertainty. My view is that, if the Fed acts strongly in September, investors will likely rejoice, boosting asset prices and engendering confidence. A recession could be avoided. However, predicting the timing of recessions and recoveries is not one of the strongest skills of economists.\n\nMeanwhile, before the release of the jobs report, the US Federal Reserve’s policy committee left the benchmark interest rate unchanged. Yet the wording of the Fed’s statement, as well as comments from Fed Chair Powell, reinforced the view that the Fed will indeed cut the rate in September.\n\nThe Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) said that there is “somewhat elevated” inflation, a more moderate description than in the previous meeting when it simply said “elevated” inflation. More importantly, the FOMC is evidently pivoting from a focus solely on inflation to a focus on both inflation and employment. Remember, the US Congress has mandated that the Fed target both. The recent statement said that “the committee is attentive to both sides of its dual mandate,” whereas over the past two years it has described policy as “highly attentive” to inflation. Also, Fed Chair Powell said, “We have made no decisions on future meetings,” adding that “the economy is moving closer to the point where it will be appropriate to reduce our policy rate.” Investors can reasonably interpret these statements as boosting the likelihood of a rate cut in September.\n\nThe newly stated focus on employment comes at a time when the unemployment rate is up and job growth has receded. Plus, there are reports of rising financial stress for households, consumers trading down, and consumer-oriented companies facing weaker revenue and earnings. On the other hand, economic growth was strong in the second quarter, consumer spending was strong in June, and business investment has been strong despite high interest rates. Regarding inflation, the numbers have been favorable, but service inflation remains far too high.\n\nProductivity growth offers hope for lower inflation\n\nIn the United States, the principal reason to worry about persistent inflation is that the labor market has been tight, which has been driving up wages. Yet if labor productivity (output per hour worked) rises, it can offset the impact of higher wages. That is, in an environment where productivity is rising, businesses can boost wages without necessarily raising their prices. That is because they are getting more output from workers, commensurate with the increase in wages. An important indicator is unit labor costs (ULCs), which is measured as the ratio of hourly compensation to labor productivity. If productivity grows commensurately with hourly compensation, then ULC doesn’t change. This implies no inflationary pressure from the labor market. Thus, for the Federal Reserve, the holy grail of monetary policy is an increase in productivity.\n\nRecall that, in 2023, there was a significant rise in labor productivity, even as wages were rising. This likely contributed to an easing of inflation. Then, in the first quarter of 2024, productivity barely grew. This raised fears that inflationary pressure will not abate. However, we have recently learned that productivity rose strongly in the second quarter, boding well for further progress on inflation. Here are the details.\n\nIn the second quarter, non-farm business output was up at an annualized rate of 3.2% from the previous quarter. The number of hours worked was up at a rate of 1.1%. Consequently, labor productivity was up 2.1%—a strong number. In the first quarter, productivity had been up at a rate of 0.5% from the previous quarter. Thus, productivity has accelerated significantly. Also, the second-quarter growth of productivity was largely due to services rather than manufacturing. Indeed, manufacturing productivity was up at a rate of only 1.1% from the previous quarter, implying even faster growth of productivity for services. This is very important given that the remaining inflation problem is in services.\n\nMeanwhile, the government reports that, in the second quarter, hourly compensation was up at a rate of 3.2% from the previous quarter. This means that ULCs were up at an annualized rate of only 1.1% from the previous quarter. Recall that ULC increased 3.7% in the first quarter. Also, manufacturing ULC was up at a rate of 3.2% in the second quarter, implying that services ULC was up even slower than 1.1%. This is very good news from an inflation perspective. The Federal Reserve has been explicit in saying that strong productivity growth could lead to an easing monetary policy sooner and faster than otherwise.\n\nSeparately, the government reported on employment costs, including both wages and benefits. The employment cost index (ECI) is published every three months and offers insight into the tightness of the job market. The latest ECI for June was up 4.1% from a year earlier. In March, the ECI had been up 4% and in June of last year it was up 4.5%. Thus, pressure on employment costs has eased. Still, employment costs are rising faster than inflation. The government estimates that real (inflation-adjusted) employment costs were up 1.1% in June versus a year earlier. However, given that productivity was rising in the second quarter, this doesn’t necessarily imply more inflationary pressure. In any event, the fact that real wages are rising implies that the labor market is relatively tight.\n\nHowever, one indication that the tightness in the US labor market is easing is that initial claims for unemployment insurance have been rising. It is reported that, two weeks ago, the number of initial claims hit 247,000, up 14,000 from the previous week and the highest level since August 2023. If this continues, it will likely remove pressure on wages."
