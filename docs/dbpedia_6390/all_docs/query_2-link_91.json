This is relayed via a headset.\n\nBSL Interpreted\n\nThere will be a trained British Signed Language (BSL) interpreter, usually standing to one side of the stage, interpreting the script used by the performers at the same time as it is being performed.\n\nCaptioned\n\nCaptioned performances have text on screens so that deaf and hard of hearing, or anyone that would like to read along, can also enjoy the performance.\n\nChilled performance\n\nThese performances allow for noise and movement in the auditorium and re-entry for patrons who may need time away from the performance.\n\nDementia-friendly\n\nDementia-friendly performances are tailored to suit the needs of people living with Dementia. There is a relaxed auditorium environment, and adjustments are made to the production in order to make a welcoming experience.\n\nIntegrated BSL\n\nAn integrated British Sign Language (BSL) performance has the interpreter directed as part of the action onstage. They interact with the actors onstage and are in costume.\n\nRelaxed performance\n\nTechnical changes are made to the production, such as adjustments to light and sound effects, for those with sensory sensitivities. These performances also allow for noise and movement in the auditorium, a chill-out space for patrons who may need time away from the performance, and re-entry when needed."
