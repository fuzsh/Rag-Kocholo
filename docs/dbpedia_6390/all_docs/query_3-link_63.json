        "text": "Health Insurance\n\nYou must maintain personal health insurance that is valid in your home country and abroad. You may be covered under a domestic health insurance plan with international coverage, or a supplemental international health insurance carrier. You are strongly encouraged to check with your current insurance carrier to see what kind of coverage is offered abroad.\n\nPrescription Medication\n\nPrior to your departure, discuss with your physician any prescription needs while studying in the Bay Area.\n\nMedical Facilities\n\nStudents will have access to The Student Health Center. This includes appointments for acute medical care, primary care, and referrals as appropriate.\n\nMental Health\n\nThe Northeastern University Oakland Counseling and Psychological Services provides short term and acute mental health care and referrals to off-campus providers.\n\nMedical Disclosure\n\nThe Global Scholars Program does not require you to get a physical prior to departure, though it does require you to submit medical information in the General Enrollment Form to alert our staff of any medical conditions or allergies. This form will be included in your enrollment paperwork.\n\nPlease be sure to register your travel by visiting the GardaWorld Travel Security portal and log in with your Northeastern email and credentials. Once registered, download the mobile app by the same name to stay up to date on important travel safety related information.\n\nNortheastern University requires all students to enter their travel itinerary and housing accommodations into “My Travel Plans” on the myNortheastern student portal also called the traveler registry. You should also enter any independent travel during the semester and make sure your contact information remains updated.\n\nMore information can be found on Northeastern University’s international travel website.\n\nHealth Insurance\n\nYou must maintain personal health insurance that is valid in your home country and abroad. You may be covered under a domestic health insurance plan with international coverage, or a supplemental international health insurance carrier. You are strongly encouraged to check with your current insurance carrier to see what kind of coverage is offered abroad.\n\nUniversity-Provided Urgent and Emergency Coverage\n\nNortheastern University maintains coverage to respond to costs associated with accidents and emergency/urgent illnesses. This is not health insurance. For more details on this policy, please visit the international travel insurance website.\n\nPrescription Medication\n\nPrior to your departure, discuss with your physician any prescription needs while studying abroad.\n\nPacking Prescription Medication\n\nPlease note that not all medications may be available in England; if possible, make arrangements for bringing an entire semester’s worth of medication. You should pack prescription medications in carry-on luggage in your original containers with doctor documentation.\n\nShipping Prescription Medication\n\nYou should check the requirements for shipping medications with both the courier service as well as with British customs. In some cases, the recipients may need to pay a fee to receive the package. It is not uncommon for packages to be held up in customs because more information is needed for delivery to be completed.\n\nMedical Disclosure\n\nThe Global Scholars Program does not require you to get a physical prior to departure, though it does require you to submit medical information in the General Enrollment Form to alert our staff of any medical conditions or allergies. This form will be included in your enrollment paperwork.\n\nVisa Resources\n\nOnce you have been notified of site sequencing, please check your Application Status Check to obtain any visa guides relevant to your student status and Global Scholars entry.\n\nCan I travel during weekends and/so school breaks in the UK or other countries? If not, why? If so, what is your recommendation for support?\n\nStudents who are studying the Global Scholars program in London are able to undertake tourist activities outside of class time. It is very important that students ensure their intended travel does not impact their studies. If a student wishes to travel outside of the UK, it is their responsibility to gain the necessary visas to enter the country that they are travelling to. Northeastern University London is not able to provide advice to students regarding visas for other countries. Many countries have visa information on their governmental websites and it is important that students access this information to understand the visa requirements for their destination country prior to travelling there.\n\nCan I travel to other European countries post program?\n\nOnce students have completed their Global Scholars programme in London they are free to travel to Europe. Students need to ensure that they have the correct visas to enter the European countries that they are travelling to. It is students’ responsibility to obtain visa(s) and adhere to the visa rules and requirements prior to and while travelling in European countries. Students should check visa requirements on the countries’ governmental websites, or the Schengen Visa website, if they are only travelling to EU countries that belong to the Schengen Area.\n\nGroup Flight Travelers\n\nThe Global Scholars Program offers a group flight option for students to travel with their peers to and from their Global Scholars location at the beginning and end of each semester.\n\nOn arrival at their Global Scholars Program location, students on the group flight will be picked up at the airport by buses and transported to the student residence. At the end of the program, students on the group flight will be shuttled from their student residence to their location’s airport.\n\nMore Group Flight information, including reservation forms and itineraries, once available will be provided through your Application Status Check.\n\nFall 2024 Group Flight\n\nGroup flight registration for the 2024 Global Scholars program first leg of the program (Fall 2024: from August/September to December) has been completed. All group flight registrants has been notified by our travel agency- Advantage Travel.\n\nAs a first leg group flight participant, you will not receive a group flight credit to your student account during Fall 2024 semester.\n\nIf you have flight or travel itinerary questions, please call Advantage Travel at +1.315.471.2222 or email our Advantage Travel Representative at [email protected].\n\nWe will communicate about the second leg of the program (Spring 2025: January to May) in mid-fall 2024. Please continue to check your email.\n\nBaggage Allowance\n\nPlease review the guidelines on the airline website for more specific details on the baggage allowance of the group flight airline. It is your responsibility to confirm the luggage policies of your airline(s).\n\nTravel Information Form\n\nTo ensure the safety of all participants, all students must provide Global Scholars with the details of their itinerary, whether they are flying on the group flight or independently.\n\nIndependent Travelers\n\nIf you do not take the group flight option, you are responsible for your travel arrangements to and from their Global Scholars Program location at the beginning and end of the program.\n\nGroup Flight Credit\n\nStudents who do not take any segment of the group flight will receive a flight credit. This credit will be posted to the student’s fall bill and will be equal to the cost of one group flight airline ticket. If a student flies any segment of the group flight, they will not receive a credit. Global Scholars students traveling separately must arrange their own transportation to their student residence and arrive on-location on the program start date (early check in will not be available).\n\nTravel Insurance\n\nYou are encouraged to research whether you would like additional insurance that covers the costs of trip interruption or cancellation, as well as loss of baggage and personal effects either while traveling or living in residence halls.\n\nSafety Resources while in Global Scholars\n\nAll Northeastern University students, faculty, and staff requiring medical, security, and travel assistance abroad can obtain assistance through the Northeastern Travel Support Network. Please contact the 24/7 international assistance hotline +1.857.214.5332 (international collect calls are accepted) to access support services provided by our partners, the Collinson Group and Crisis24, a GardaWorld company. They will also notify the International Safety Office of your call to provide an added layer of support.\n\nPlease be sure to register your travel by visiting the GardaWorld Travel Security portal and log in with your Northeastern email and credentials. Once registered, download the mobile app by the same name to stay up to date on important travel safety related information.\n\nNortheastern Travel Registry\n\nNortheastern University requires all students to enter their travel itinerary and housing accommodations into “My Travel Plans” on the myNortheastern student portal also called the traveler registry. You should also enter any independent travel during the semester and make sure your contact information remains updated.\n\nMore information can be found on Northeastern University’s international travel website.\n\nSmart Traveler Enrollment Program (STEP)\n\nU.S. citizens can register their travel plans with the U.S. Embassy through the State Department’s Smart Traveler Enrollment Program. We strongly encourage you to register, as this is a free service that will allow the U.S. State Department to better assist citizens abroad in the event of an emergency.\n\nAdditional Resources\n\nFor more resources, visit the U.S. State Department, which provides information on safety for travelers abroad, including tips on handling money, traveling on public transportation, and safety in a hotel.\n\nPassports\n\nAll Global Scholars students will need a passport. If you do not already have a passport, you should apply for one as soon as possible.\n\nU.S. citizens and permanent residents will need a passport to participate in the London portion of the program. All other students will need to obtain a passport in order to enter the U.S. Please plan accordingly for passport processing times.\n\nAs a student in the Global Scholars program, you have the opportunity to connect with other future Huskies, and together you will become global leaders as you are immersed in the rich culture and history of both Oakland, California, and London, England. By the time you transition to Boston in your second year you will have broadened your perspective, expanded your networks, and gained insights which will prepare you for future experiential learning opportunities during your remaining years at Northeastern and beyond.\n\nHow many students will participate in Global Scholars?\n\nEach Global Scholars location will welcome between 300-400 students.\n\nWhat will my academic experience be like studying in the Global Scholars Program?\n\nThe course offerings and academic experience in the Global Scholars Program will match the rigor of what is offered on Northeastern’s Boston campus. Each course has been reviewed and evaluated by Northeastern University academic deans to ensure Global Scholars students will be in lockstep with their first-year peers.\n\nHow many credits will I earn towards my degree?\n\nBeginning in Fall 2023, we have enabled our systems to award grades directly to student transcripts. Grades earned during the Global Scholars program will no longer appear as transfer credit. This enhancement means that students will have one transcript for their entire undergraduate Northeastern experience, and the grade point average earned during the Global Scholars program will count toward a student’s cumulative GPA. In addition, for students who wish to pursue medical school, classes taken in London will be part of their official transcript.\n\nCan I bring in credit from high school?\n\nYes. Results from your AP exams, IB exams, and other international examinations may enable you to receive advanced credits once you matriculate at Northeastern in your second year. Click here for more information on Northeastern’s advanced standing policies for first-year students.\n\nIs housing provided during my second year of study at Northeastern?\n\nYes, students who complete Global Scholars 2023-2024 will have the opportunity to apply for university housing during their second year in Boston, Fall 2023. This opportunity does not represent a mandatory requirement as students can still decide to live in off-campus housing in the local area if they choose.\n\nPlease note that university housing for all students—including students completing Global Scholars—can take the form of traditional campus residence halls, leased apartments, or leased hotel spaces in the area around campus. We will provide more information about specific housing options for Global Scholars later in the 2023-2024 academic year. Additionally, as it is quite typical for students to move off-campus in years three and beyond, university housing is not guaranteed beyond the second year.\n\nAm I required to live in university housing my second year of study at Northeastern?\n\nStudents in the Global Scholars 2023-2024 cohort are not required to live in university housing.\n\nWhere should I look for information on housing after completion of the program?\n\nStudents joining campus from a second-year specialized entry program such as Global Scholars should refer to housing information for transfer students for their first year in Boston and to the information for upperclassmen for future years. Housing information for future years is updated on the university’s Housing and Residential Life website in October/November each fall.\n\nCan I change my major?\n\nYes! All major change requests must be approved. Students are only eligible to submit a major change request that is compatible with their deposited site location. You can request a major change through your Application Status Check.\n\nPlease note that students who change their intended major after completing their first semester of coursework in Global Scholars may need to spend additional time completing coursework at Northeastern in order to complete their degree. We also cannot guarantee that courses for your new major will be available at your location.\n\nCan I still graduate on time if I enroll in Global Scholars?\n\nGlobal Scholars students may be able to graduate in four years if they wish to prioritize a four-year graduation timeline. Students who have advanced standing credit or students who take summer classes or heavier loads during a term or two are very likely to finish in four years in most majors. A student’s timeline to graduation may also be altered if they change their major. A student’s timeline to graduation will also depend on whether the students want to do one, two, or three co-ops, or if they choose another global experience later in their Northeastern career. As with students who begin in the undergraduate day program directly, a larger focus on experiential learning opportunities may lengthen a student’s overall timeline to graduation.\n\nFor answers to additional questions, check out our Global Scholars FAQs! Throughout the spring we also compile and answer the most commonly asked questions about the Global Scholars program.\n\nGlobal Scholars FAQ\n\nWe know that keeping in touch with family and friends back home can be challenging during your time away. Past students have found it helpful to set up a schedule for calling home, as having a set time can make time differences much easier to handle. You and your family might also consider a variety of technologies to keep in touch. For example, the instant messaging service WhatsApp also allows voice and video chat, and the voice-over-IP (VOIP) programs Skype, Zoom, and Facetime use an internet connection to talk for free.\n\nEmail\n\nEmail communications from Northeastern University and the Global Scholars Program will be sent to students via their Northeastern email addresses, which are created as soon as you activate your myNortheastern portal. Parents will receive some communications, but students are encouraged to initiate their own inquiries and problem-solve independently.\n\nCell Phones\n\nFor safety reasons and for ease of communication, Global Scholars students are required to have a working cell phone for use on-location during their time in the Global Scholars Program. Phones must be acquired and working (calls, texting, and data required) within a week of arriving on-location. You should research the mobile phone options available to you prior to arriving. You typically have a chance to learn more about phone plans and purchase a phone during on-location orientation."
