        "text": "Scotland's Highland games are usually one-day events taking place in outdoor spaces across the country. They feature traditional Highland sports such as the caber toss, tug o' war and the hammer throw, Highland dancing and music, and lots of family fun such as food and craft stalls and games.\n\nMany events will also involve livestock events, parades and even best-dressed pet competitions. Some Highland games may continue into the night with more music gigs, ceilidhs and discos.\n\nOur Highland games are so popular, that when Scots emigrated to other lands, they took the tradition across the world with them. Highland games have taken place in America since 1836, but also run in other countries such as Canada, Norway, New Zealand and Brazil. But there's no better way to experience them than in their original country!\n\nWhere are the Highland Games?\n\nThough they may have started in Highland Scotland, the games these days stretch right across Scotland from the far north coast of the Highlands, out west to the island of South Uist, east to Aberdeenshire and south to Peebles in the Scottish Borders.\n\nWhen are the Highland Games?\n\nThe Highland games events season begins in May with the Gourock Highland Games, it peaks in July and August with over 30 events each month, and comes to a close towards the end of September. Most Highland games events take place at the weekend, on either a Saturday or a Sunday.\n\nThere's plenty to do to fill the whole day, as you'll be watching the heavy events and Highland dancing, enjoying fun fairs and stalls and sampling delicious Scottish food and drink.\n\nHeavy Contests and Field Events\n\nSee competitors put their muscles to the test in the heavy contests, including the hammer throw and weight for height.\n\nCompetitors in the heavy events use a range of techniques to improve their chances of winning. One movement in the weight for height event goes by the somewhat surprising nickname of \"the handbag technique\", because the starting position is similar to where one would hold a handbag.\n\nThe games' most iconic event, the caber toss, is rumoured to have stemmed from the need to toss logs over chasms. Nowadays it is judged on style rather than distance - competitors aim to flip a log weighing up to 11 stone so that it falls away from them in the 12 o'clock position. The length it travels is entirely unimportant.\n\nLook out for the field events such as the hill race and cycling competition which test speed and stamina.\n\nHighland Games Training\n\nEver wondered how you would fare in a Highland games competition? Find out with Highland Games Academy Scotland and undertake training with a professional athlete in a stunning Highland setting. Whether you're a local or a visitor to Scotland, people of all ages are invited to toss the caber, attempt the stone throw and other iconic heavy events. You can even try your hand at curling!\n\nThey design a personally tailored training course which can be extended over multiple days to include driving tours, castle visits and more.\n\nStart your adventure with Highland Games Academy Scotland\n\nMusic\n\nFor many, one of the most memorable sights of the Highland games is the massed bands, when hundreds of pipers and drummers from different groups come together to play and march in unison. Look out for the solo piping competitions, where competitors play in a range of styles, including the Pibroch, which is considered the classical music of the bagpipe. Pibrochs tend to be slow, stately and complex.\n\nHighland Dancing\n\nDancers give dazzling displays of fancy footwork in Scottish dances, such as the sword dance and the famous Highland Fling. Competing for titles both individually and in groups, their colourful outfits and infectious energy will leave you in high spirits. The Cowal Highland Gathering is renowned for the quality of its Highland dancing, drawing in the best performers from around the globe as they compete in the Scottish and World Championships.\n\nHighland Clans\n\nHighland games once saw clan members go head-to-head in fierce competition - and you'll still see this enthusiasm when clans muster all their might in a tug o' war. These days, clan attendance at games is now more of a social and ceremonial affair. Some Highland games are part of a wider clan gathering - a celebratory get-together featuring parades, Scottish music and dancing, feasts, heritage events and much joviality.\n\nChieftains\n\nThe ceremonial role of chieftain is bestowed upon a member of the local community or clan chief, who then leads processions, opens the games and oversees the whole event with aplomb.\n\nDid you know that several games have boasted famous celebrity chieftains, including singer Susan Boyle and actors Ewan McGregor and Dougray Scott?\n\nSome believe the roots of the Highland games date as far back as the 11th century. King Malcolm III needed a personal courier, so he called a foot race to the summit of Creag Ch√≤innich, near Braemar, in the hopes of finding the fastest runner. Many games still include a hill race, although the winner is no longer destined for a life of servitude!\n\nThe games evolved into a test not only of strength and stamina, but also of creative dance and music skills to keep kings, queens and clan chiefs entertained.\n\nHighland games as we know them today have been celebrated around Scotland since the 1800s and regularly draw in enthusiastic crowds.\n\nAmongst the most historic is the Braemar Gathering, which was awarded Royal Patronage by Queen Victoria and is still regularly attended by the reigning monarch and other members of the Royal Family.\n\nDid you know?\n\nHighland dancing at the games was originally an all-male event, and it wasn't until the late 19th century that women started to enter.\n\nThe Highland games were so impressive, that the founder of the modern Olympics, Baron de Coubertin, introduced the hammer throw, shot put and the tug o' war after watching the Highland display at the 1889 Paris Exhibition. The hammer throw and shot put are still included to this day.\n\nHaggis hurling began as a practical joke in the 1970s, but is now a popular event at many Highland games - there's even a World Haggis Hurling Association dedicated to the sport! The current world record was set at the Milngavie Highland Games in 2011, when Lorne Coltart hurled a haggis at an impressive 217 ft."
