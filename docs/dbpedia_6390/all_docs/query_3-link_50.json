        "text": "When is the best time to visit the Eiffel Tower? The peak hours and waiting times are different each day at the Eiffel Tower and based on several factors. However, this page provides all of the general information that can help you to select the most appropriate moment to visit the Eiffel Tower, based on your schedule.\n\nAttendance per month / day ?\n\nAttendance throughout the year\n\nJanuary February March April May June Low Low Medium Medium Medium High\n\nJuly August September October November December Maximum Maximum Medium Low Low Medium\n\nAttendance throughout the day\n\n9 AM -11 AM 11 AM - 5 PM 5 PM - 8 PM 8 PM - 10:30 PM High\n\n(Maximum during peak season) High\n\n(Maximum during peak season) Medium\n\n(Maximum during peak season) Low\n\n(High during peak season)\n\nThe busiest period at the Eiffel Tower is between the end of June and the beginning of September. This is the so-called peak season, when the attendance peaks.\n\nIn certain periods, attendance may be higher due to school vacation in Europe. During these periods, the lines may be longer (at the garden entrances, cash registers and elevators). The main school vacation periods for 2023 are below.\n\nFrom April 6 to May 12, 2024\n\nFrom July 6 to September 1st, 2024\n\nFrom October 19 to November 3, 2024\n\nFrom December 21, 2024 to January 5, 2025\n\nOn some holidays that can turn into a long weekend, attendance may be higher:\n\nFrom May 1 to 5, 2024\n\nFrom May 8 to 12, 2024\n\nFrom May 18 to 20, 2024\n\nFrom August 15 to 18, 2024\n\nThanksgiving : November 28 to December 1st, 2024\n\nImmaculate Conception : From December 6 to 8, 2024\n\nAttendance over the course of the day depends on the period of the year, weather conditions, as well as the day of the week. In general, to feel more comfortable, it's best to visit at the end of the day after 5 PM, or even in the evening. More information is available on our FAQ.\n\nAttendance throughout the week\n\nSaturdays and Sundays are the busiest days of the week.\n\nWhen it is not peak season, school vacation or a public holiday, attendance is usually lowest on Tuesdays, Wednesdays and Thursdays.\n\nThe Eiffel Tower is open on Tuesdays, unlike museums in Paris.\n\nAvoid lines at the cash register: purchase online\n\nPurchase your tickets ahead of time on the official ticket office of the Eiffel Tower. With these tickets that indicate the time and date, you can avoid the lines at the cash registers of the monument. This is especially useful if you would like to go up to the top. Regardless of the attendance the day of your visit, this ticket guarantees access to the top of the Tower. For tickets purchased at the monument, sales of tickets to go up to the top may be suspended if the number of visitors for the top has reached the limit.\n\nElectronic tickets for the Eiffel Tower are on sale 60 days in advance. They may be available the day of your visit, up to 3 hours prior to your visiting time. Consider this option and check the availability frequently!\n\nWhat can you expect at the Eiffel Tower?\n\nThe entrances of the Eiffel Tower are located in the side gardensâ€”the east entrance and south entrance. The first security checkpoint is there. If you have purchased your ticket in advance, it is preferable to arrive at this entrance 15 to 20 minutes prior to the time indicated on your ticket.\n\nVisitors without tickets must pass by the cash registers on the square. This is where visitors may wait the longest. The cash registers are in the east and/or west pillars. You can purchase tickets to go up immediately. The waiting time is indicated on site. To avoid this line, consider purchasing online.\n\nIf you use the elevators, you may need to wait a bit, as this involves a 2nd security checkpoint."
