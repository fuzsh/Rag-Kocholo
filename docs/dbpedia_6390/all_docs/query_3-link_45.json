        "text": "Introduction\n\nSchools can use this guide to help them understand the inspection process, including timings, notice that we give, judgements that we make and what happens after the visit to the school.\n\nConduct during Ofsted inspections\n\nOfsted’s code of conduct sets out the expectations for both inspectors and schools. At the start of the inspection (usually during the preparatory conversations), the lead inspector will explain these expectations and will ask schools to read the code.\n\nInspectors will uphold the highest professional standards in their work. They will treat everyone they meet during inspections fairly and with the respect and sensitivity they deserve. Inspectors will work constructively with leaders and staff, demonstrating professionalism, courtesy, empathy and respect at all times.\n\nTimings of inspections\n\nInspections can take place at any point from 5 school days after the first day pupils attend in the autumn term. For example, if pupils return to school on a Wednesday, an inspection can take place as early as the following Wednesday.\n\nA school can request to defer or cancel an inspection, but only in exceptional circumstances. If pupils are receiving education in the school, an inspection will usually go ahead.\n\nHow often we inspect a school normally depends on the findings of its previous inspection, as outlined below. However, the situation is currently a bit more complicated, for several reasons, including:\n\nthe pause to inspections during the pandemic meant that we have extended the inspection window for many schools\n\nthe government lifted the inspection exemption for outstanding schools; this added 3,000 schools to our schedule, many of which have not been inspected for a decade or more\n\nthe government has also asked us to inspect every school at least once before August 2025\n\nThis means that the gaps between inspections may be different for your school.\n\nOur blogpost ‘When will my school be inspected?’ sets out further clarity on when schools can expect their next inspection. This is in addition to the information below.\n\nWe inspect schools under section 5 or section 8 of the Education Act 2005 (as amended).\n\nNew schools\n\nWe usually inspect all new schools, including academies, in the first 3 years after they open. This normally happens in the school’s third year. New schools that opened before September 2020 and that have not had their first inspection can expect to be inspected by their fifth year of operation. This is due to the suspension of routine inspection activity as a result of COVID-19.\n\nRead guidance on how we select new schools for inspection.\n\nSchools judged good or outstanding\n\nA school judged good or outstanding at its most recent inspection will normally receive an inspection approximately every 4 years, to confirm that the school remains good or outstanding. We call this an ungraded inspection, and it is carried out under section 8 of the Education Act 2005. We do not give graded judgements on an ungraded inspection. However, if we find some evidence that a school would now be better than it was, or that standards may be declining, we will carry out a full inspection with graded judgements. We call this a graded inspection, and it is carried out under section 5 of the Education Act. Usually this is within 1 to 2 years of the date of the ungraded inspection, but if we have serious concerns about a school, for example in relation to safeguarding, we will deem the ungraded inspection a graded inspection immediately.\n\nHowever, some good schools will automatically receive a graded inspection. We use a risk assessment process to ensure that our approach to inspection is proportionate, in order to focus our efforts on where we can have the greatest impact.\n\nOutstanding schools that were formerly exempt from routine inspections\n\nBetween 15 May 2012 and 13 November 2020, maintained primary and secondary schools and academies judged to be outstanding in their overall effectiveness at their most recent graded inspection were exempt from routine inspections. These schools are now once again subject to routine inspections. This also applies to academy converter schools that were formerly exempt because the overall effectiveness of the predecessor school was outstanding at its most recent graded inspection. (Academy converter schools are schools that have been approved by the Secretary of State to convert to become an academy.)\n\nAll formerly exempt schools will receive an initial graded or ungraded inspection before 1 August 2025. Those schools that received their last graded inspection before September 2015 will receive an initial graded inspection. Those that received their last graded inspection after this date will normally receive an initial ungraded inspection. If that ungraded inspection indicates that outstanding performance may not have been maintained, we will normally carry out a graded inspection within the next 12 months or as soon as possible thereafter and, in any event, before 1 August 2026. Beyond these initial inspections, future inspections for these schools will take place as set out in the section above.\n\nSchools judged requires improvement\n\nA school judged as requires improvement at its last inspection is a school that is not yet good but overall provides an acceptable standard of education. The school will receive a graded inspection again within a period of 2.5 years.\n\nIf a school has been judged as requires improvement at 2 successive inspections, it will be subject to monitoring from inspectors to check its progress. We will carry out a graded inspection again within a period of 2.5 years of the publication of the previous graded inspection report.\n\nSchools judged inadequate\n\nWhen we judge a school as inadequate, we place the school in a category of concern. This means that we judge the school either to have serious weaknesses or to require special measures.\n\nThe Secretary of State for Education will issue an academy order to a maintained school judged inadequate and placed in a category of concern. The school will then become a sponsored academy. We will not usually monitor the school unless there are safeguarding concerns or there is a delay in the school becoming a sponsored academy.\n\nIf an academy is judged inadequate and placed in a category of concern, we will monitor the school. If an academy is judged inadequate and is rebrokered to a new multi-academy trust to become a new sponsored academy, we will not usually carry out any monitoring inspections.\n\nIf an academy is judged as having serious weaknesses or requiring special measures, and if it is not rebrokered to a new multi-academy trust, we will monitor the school to check its progress. We will then carry out a graded inspection within 2.5 years of the publication of the academy’s previous graded inspection report.\n\nIf a maintained nursery school or a non-maintained special school is judged inadequate on a graded inspection, we will monitor it in the same way as an academy judged as inadequate that is not re-brokered to a new sponsor trust.\n\nWhere a school is judged to have serious weaknesses solely due to safeguarding, we will return within 3 months of the publication of the graded inspection report.\n\nWho inspects schools?\n\nSchool inspectors are:\n\nHis Majesty’s Inspectors (HMI) employed directly by Ofsted\n\ncontracted Ofsted Inspectors\n\nNotice of an inspection\n\nWe will normally notify the school of its inspection between 9.30am and 2pm on the school day before the start of the inspection.\n\nBy exception, we can inspect any school without notice, if this is judged appropriate. Where this is the case, the lead inspector will normally telephone the school about 15 minutes before arriving on site.\n\nOnce we have informed the school of the inspection, the lead inspector will contact the school and ask to speak to the headteacher. This conversation with the headteacher will have 2 elements:\n\na short inspection-planning conversation that focuses on practical and logistical arrangements\n\na longer, reflective, educationally focused conversation about the school’s progress since the last inspection, including how COVID-19 has affected this\n\nWe understand that there is a great deal of information to be discussed at this stage of the inspection. For this reason, it may be helpful to discuss these elements in 2 or more separate conversations with a break in between. The lead inspector will discuss what will work best for the headteacher.\n\nThe inspection-planning conversation will be short and focused on practical issues. This is an opportunity for the headteacher to provide a fuller context of the school that may not be expressed sufficiently through data alone. It is also an opportunity for the headteacher to discuss the particular circumstances of the school that have had a role in the decisions made by leaders.\n\nAs part of this conversation, the lead inspector will also ask the headteacher to inform inspectors about any requests for adaptations to the inspection process because of a protected characteristic, or any reasonable adjustments because of a disability. They will also make the school aware of the help and support for headteacher and staff well-being that is available through the charity Education Support.\n\nThe educationally focused conversation will normally last around 90 minutes but may be longer. It will help the lead inspector and headteacher to establish a constructive professional relationship for the inspection and give them a shared understanding of the starting point of the inspection.\n\nThe lead inspector will encourage the headteacher to have at least one other senior leader present during both calls, to assist and support them. This will usually be colleagues who typically deputise for them (or a member of trust staff) and who can understand and discuss the educational content of the calls. They may also wish to have someone present to take notes.\n\nBefore the inspection begins\n\nWe provide schools with a letter to tell all parents of pupils at the school about the inspection and options for providing their views. We also ask schools to notify other relevant bodies, including those providing alternative provision for pupils, of the inspection.\n\nInspectors will look at Ofsted Parent View to see the views of parents.\n\nInspectors will also take into account the results of any past parent surveys, or other surveys, carried out by the school. Parents can tell Ofsted about their child’s school at any time using Ofsted Parent View.\n\nDuring the inspection\n\nThe inspection will normally last 2 full days. Inspections of good primary schools and good or outstanding maintained nursery schools with less than 150 pupils will normally last for 1 day. The number of inspectors on the inspection team will vary according to the size and nature of the school.\n\nInspectors will spend most of their time observing lessons and gathering evidence to inform their judgements.\n\nInspectors will talk to a range of pupils and staff about important aspects of the school’s work. Staff (including leaders at all levels) may always be accompanied by another appropriate person when speaking to inspectors. However, it is important that staff are able to express their views freely to inspectors.\n\nInspectors should take careful account of the well-being of leaders and staff and adjust their approach or activity, as appropriate, as they go about their inspection work in the best interests of pupils. If inspectors see or suspect that a staff member (including leaders and the headteacher) is upset or distressed at any point during the inspection, inspectors should respond sensitively. Where appropriate, inspectors will consider suitable adjustments to enable the staff member to continue. Where there are serious concerns, inspectors will contact the duty desk, and will normally inform those responsible for the person’s well-being.\n\nThere may be exceptional occasions when we need to consider pausing an inspection. We will consider these on a case-by-case basis according to our published guidance on pausing school inspections.\n\nInspectors will make their final judgements when they have collected and considered all the evidence.\n\nAt the heart of our inspections is a professional dialogue between inspectors and leaders and so the lead inspector will agree a process for keeping leaders informed of progress throughout the inspection. This will normally mean regular meetings with the headteacher and/or any other previously agreed school leader(s) (at a minimum, at the start, middle and end of each day) to ensure that the headteacher and senior staff:\n\nare kept up to date about the inspection\n\nunderstand how the inspection team reaches its judgements\n\nhave opportunities to clarify how evidence is used to reach judgements\n\non day 1, have the opportunity to present evidence they want to draw inspectors’ attention to\n\nare able to provide clarification on any matters of fact\n\nat the end of day 1, can contribute to the construction of the day 2 timetable\n\ncan raise any issues or concerns, or to seek clarification, including related to the conduct of the inspection or of individual inspectors\n\nare alert to any serious concerns\n\nare informed if, by the end of day 1 or during day 2, there is evidence that the school might be judged as inadequate or requires improvement\n\nInspectors will invite the school’s headteacher, curriculum leaders and other leaders to take part in joint visits to lessons, as agreed with the lead inspector.\n\nInspectors will also invite the headteacher (and for an academy, the chief executive officer) to attend the final team meeting at the end of the inspection. The headteacher or chief executive officer may also bring colleagues to assist and support them during this meeting. If the feedback is likely to be challenging or is likely to raise difficult issues, the lead inspector will be sensitive to any implications arising from this feedback and will therefore discuss with the headteacher which other people may attend to ensure the necessary support for school leaders. Attendance at the feedback meeting is voluntary and any attendee may leave at any time, including leaving for a short time and then returning.\n\nInspectors will give oral feedback to teachers and other staff about the work that they see.\n\nInspection and the COVID-19 pandemic\n\nOur approach to inspection will take into account the COVID-19 pandemic and the disruption it has caused to schools. Inspectors will discuss the impact of the pandemic with the school, including how the school leadership responded to the situation, and will take that into account in their assessment of the school.\n\nFeedback\n\nAt the final feedback meeting, the lead inspector must make clear:\n\nthe grades awarded for each judgement\n\nthat these grades are provisional and may be subject to change following quality assurance procedures or moderation\n\nthat the written report will mention the main points in the feedback\n\nhow the report will be published\n\nif relevant, the implications of the school being judged as requires improvement\n\nif relevant, the implications of the school being placed in special measures or deemed to have serious weaknesses\n\nwhere a school is judged to have serious weaknesses solely due to safeguarding, that we will return within 3 months of the publication of the graded inspection report\n\nthat, in addition to being able to raise concerns at any stage during the inspection, the school has an opportunity to raise any issues or concerns, or to seek clarification about the inspection at this stage, and can contact Ofsted on the working day after the end of inspection, if needed\n\nthe complaints procedure\n\nThe inspection team will explain its judgements to the senior leadership team and those responsible for the governance of the school. Attendance at the feedback meeting is voluntary and any attendee may leave at any time, including leaving for a short time and then returning.\n\nWe expect leaders to share the inspection outcome and findings with whoever they deem appropriate. Leaders may share inspection outcomes, in confidence, with others who are not involved with the school. This may include leaders’ colleagues, family members, medical advisers, and/or their wider support group. However, the information should not be made public or shared with parents.\n\nAfter the inspection visit\n\nThe lead inspector will write a report setting out the inspection findings. Inspection reports are sent to the school following moderation and quality assurance. We aim to send reports to schools as quickly as reasonably possible. In most circumstances, we will send the draft report to the school within 18 working days of the end of the inspection.\n\nThe school will have 5 working days to comment on the draft report. It can highlight minor points relating to the clarity and/or factual accuracy of the report, or it can submit a formal complaint seeking a review of the inspection process, including the judgements made or concerns about inspector conduct. If it only submits minor points of clarity or factual accuracy, we will consider and respond to these when we share the final report with the school. This will normally be within 30 working days of the end of the inspection. As set out above, we expect leaders to share the inspection outcome and findings with governors/trustees and whoever they deem appropriate.\n\nIf the school wishes to make a formal complaint, we will follow the process set out in our published complaints procedure. We will respond to any complaint before we finalise and send the report to the school. If the school has previously chosen to highlight some minor points of clarity or factual accuracy on the draft inspection report, it will not normally be able to submit a formal complaint or challenge later. We will publish the final report on our reports website 5 working days after sending it to the school.\n\nIn most circumstances, we will publish the final report on the Ofsted reports website within 35 working days of the end of the inspection. If the school has submitted a complaint, the publication of the report may be delayed.\n\nWe send a copy of the report to:\n\nthe school’s headteacher\n\nthe local authority\n\nthe appropriate authority or proprietor (for example, the governing body or the academy trust where the local authority is not the appropriate authority)\n\nthe person or body responsible for appointing foundation governors if the school has them (including diocesan or other appropriate authorities in the case of schools with a religious character)\n\nother prescribed persons such as the Department for Education or the Education and Skills Funding Agency\n\nThe school must also supply a copy of the report to all parents of registered pupils at the school.\n\nGraded and ungraded inspections\n\nOfsted’s education inspection framework came into effect in September 2019.\n\nUnder the framework, for graded inspections, inspectors will make the following judgements about schools:\n\noverall effectiveness\n\nquality of education\n\nbehaviour and attitudes\n\npersonal development\n\nleadership and management\n\nIf the school offers early years provision and sixth-form provision, inspectors will also make judgements on these areas.\n\nWhen we have judged a school to be good or outstanding, we will then normally go into the school once every 4 years to confirm that the school remains good or outstanding and that safeguarding is effective. We call this an ungraded inspection of a good or outstanding school. We do not give graded judgements on an ungraded inspection.\n\nInformation to share with inspectors\n\nSchools are not expected to prepare anything extra for inspectors, but the lead inspector will ask the school to provide certain information as early as possible. This will include:\n\na copy of the school’s timetable(s), where relevant\n\ndetails of any relevant staff absence\n\nany requests to not visit any specific lesson or lessons (for example, if a teacher is subject to capability procedures)\n\nWe will request that the following information is available at the start of the inspection:\n\nstrategic documents about the school, including:\n\nanything that sets out school improvement planning or the longer-term vision for the school, such as the school or the trust’s strategy\n\nfor maintained schools, minutes of governors’ meetings and other relevant strategic documentation about governance that the school may have\n\nfor academies, minutes of board of trustees’ meetings and other relevant strategic documentation about the trust that the school may have\n\na summary of any school self-evaluation or equivalent\n\nany reports from any external evaluation of the school\n\nrecords and information about behaviour and attendance, including:\n\nup-to-date attendance analysis for all groups of pupils\n\nrecords and analysis of pupils taken off roll\n\nrecords and analysis of exclusions and suspensions, incidents of poor behaviour and any use of internal isolation\n\nrecords and analysis of bullying, discriminatory and prejudiced behaviour, either directly or indirectly, including racist, sexist, disability and homophobic/biphobic/transphobic bullying, use of derogatory language and racist incidents\n\nrecords and analysis of sexual harassment and/or sexual violence\n\nrecords and analysis of any restrictive physical intervention.\n\noperational documents, including:\n\naccess to wifi, if it exists, so that inspectors can connect to the internet\n\nmaps and other practical information\n\nthe school timetable, current staff list (indicating any early career teachers (ECTs), mentors and induction tutors) and times for the school day, including any planned interruptions to normal school routines during the inspection and whether any teachers cannot be observed for any reason\n\nSafeguarding information\n\nOn arrival at the school, inspectors must have secure access to safeguarding information, including:\n\nthe single central record for the school\n\na list of any referrals made to the designated person for safeguarding in the school and those that were subsequently referred to the local authority, along with brief details of the resolution\n\nany referrals made to the local authority designated officer regarding staff or other adults\n\na list of all pupils who have open cases with children’s services or social care and all pupils who have a multi-agency plan\n\nSchools and inspectors must ensure that all actions are compliant with legal requirements on information-handling.\n\nIf any of this information is available before the inspection begins, you can upload it onto the inspection portal. We provide instructions for using the portal in the notification of inspection letter.\n\nInspectors will use a range of technology to gather evidence electronically, including mobile devices, tablets and laptops. They may also request to take photographic evidence, for example of pupils’ work and displays. Inspectors will not take photographs of pupils.\n\nSeeking the views of parents, staff and pupils\n\nParents will give their views about their child’s school on Ofsted Parent View, which they can access at any time. This includes at the point of inspection, when we will provide them with a link to the Ofsted Parent View website.\n\nStaff and pupils will be encouraged to complete a voluntary online survey, available at the point of inspection.\n\nAny meetings with pupils or parents will take place without the presence of any leaders or staff unless there are exceptional circumstances.\n\nMore information about school inspections\n\nThe school inspection handbook explains how we carry out inspections and the judgements that inspectors make on graded inspections. It contains the grade descriptors that inspectors use when making their judgements. The handbook also explains how we carry out ungraded inspections and urgent inspections under section 8 of the Education Act 2005. The school monitoring handbook explains how we carry out monitoring inspections of schools that were judged at their most recent graded inspection as requires improvement or as inadequate (having serious weaknesses or requiring special measures).\n\nThe education inspection framework sets out the statutory basis for schools inspected under section 5 of the Education Act 2005 (as amended).\n\nYour views on the inspection\n\nFollowing your inspection, we will invite you to complete an online inspection survey. The online survey asks for your views on the inspection process, including the impact that the inspection is likely to have in bringing about improvement. We value all survey responses. We use the outcomes to help keep us informed about the quality and impact of inspections and to help guide us in reviewing and improving the inspection process.\n\nComplaints about an inspection\n\nAny concerns or complaints about the inspection should be raised immediately with the lead inspector during the inspection.\n\nIf there are any concerns that it is not possible to resolve with the lead inspector during the inspection, the headteacher, another senior leader, the local authority or a trust representative can contact a senior Ofsted leader using the number provided as part of the notification process. In exceptional circumstances, this might lead to the inspection being paused.\n\nIf an issue remains unresolved, the school or responsible body can contact Ofsted on the working day after the end of the inspection. This is an opportunity for the school to raise informal concerns about the inspection process or outcomes, ask about next steps or highlight information that they feel was not fully considered during the inspection. This will be directed to a senior inspector who is independent of the inspection, to discuss and to resolve, where appropriate, at the earliest opportunity.\n\nIf it is not possible to resolve concerns during the inspection, or through a telephone call the day after the inspection, the school may wish to lodge a formal complaint when it receives the draft report. The lead inspector will ensure that the school is informed that it is able to make a formal complaint and that information about how to complain is available on GOV.UK.\n\nFurther guidance\n\nYou can access our guidance for inspections of maintained schools and academies.\n\nGathering personal information on inspection\n\nInspectors will gather any personal information necessary to assist them in inspecting a school. Our privacy policy sets out what personal information we collect, what we do with it, how long we keep it and individuals’ rights under data protection legislation.\n\nHelpline: 0300 123 1231"
