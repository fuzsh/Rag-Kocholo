        "text": "Kevin Macdonald is an Oscar-winning feature and documentary film director.\n\nHis films include ‘One Day in September’, a documentary about the 1972 murder of 11 Israeli athletes, which won him the Academy Award for Best Documentary Feature, climbing documentary ‘Touching the Void’, historical drama ‘The Last King of Scotland’, which won Forest Whitaker the Academy Award for Best Actor, and acclaimed documentaries on artists Whitney Houston and Bob Marley.\n\nIn 2010, Kevin, with Executive Producer Ridley Scott, directed the crowd-sourced documentary feature ‘Life in a Day’. A partnership between YouTube, RSA Films, and LG electronics, ‘Life in a Day’ told the story of one single ordinary day and included scenes selected from over 80,000 submissions. Kevin and Ridley revisited the project for ‘Life in a Day 2020’ with the film premiering on YouTube in February 2021."
