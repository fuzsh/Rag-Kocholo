        "text": "2. Life expectancy at birth\n\nOver the last 40 years life expectancy in the UK has been increasing, albeit at a slower pace in the last decade. This increase has been primarily because of improvements in mortality at older ages driven by advances in health care, and improvements in living and working conditions. In the latest period, 2018 to 2020, life expectancy at birth in the UK was 79.0 years for males and 82.9 years for females.\n\nFigure 1: Life expectancy in the UK in 2018 to 2020 fell to the level of 2012 to 2014 for males and was similar to 2015 to 2017 for females\n\nLife expectancy at birth for males and females, UK, between 1980 to 1982 and 2018 to 2020\n\nSource: Office for National Statistics – National life tables – life expectancy in the UK: 2018 to 2020\n\nDownload this chart Figure 1: Life expectancy in the UK in 2018 to 2020 fell to the level of 2012 to 2014 for males and was similar to 2015 to 2017 for females\n\nImage .csv .xls\n\nIn the first decade of the 21st century, we saw improvements for males of between 42 weeks and 53 weeks, and improvements for females of between 29 weeks and 42 weeks, when comparing life expectancy at birth in one three-year period with the previous non-overlapping three-year period (Figure 2). However, in the last 10 years, improvements in life expectancy at birth have slowed. Since 2010 to 2012, the improvements for each period when compared with the previous non-overlapping period have been declining for both males and females, with the exception of 2017 to 2019 when improvements increased slightly.\n\nIn contrast, excess mortality because of winter flu led to particularly low improvements in 2015 to 2017. The changes observed in 2018 to 2020 when compared with 2015 to 2017 are the lowest we have seen, with a decline of 7.0 weeks for males, and almost no change (an increase of 0.5 weeks) for females, notwithstanding the relatively low improvements in 2015 to 2017 itself.\n\nFigure 2: The period 2018 to 2020 saw the smallest improvement in life expectancy for males and females since the series began in 1980 to 1982\n\nChange in life expectancy at birth for each period, in weeks, compared with previous non-overlapping time period, UK, 1997 to 1999, to 2018 to 2020\n\nSource: Office for National Statistics – National life tables – life expectancy in the UK: 2018 to 2020\n\nDownload this chart Figure 2: The period 2018 to 2020 saw the smallest improvement in life expectancy for males and females since the series began in 1980 to 1982\n\nImage .csv .xls\n\nAcross the UK, mortality increased in 2020, in a large part because of the impact of the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic. In England and Wales, there was a 14.5% increase in the number of deaths compared with 2019. Taking into account the population size and age structure, age-standardised mortality rates (ASMRs) in England and Wales increased significantly, by 14.6% for males and 11.9% for females. ASMRs for 2020 were significantly higher than every year back to 2010 in males and 2009 in females.\n\nSimilarly, in Scotland the number of deaths rose by 10% and the ASMR increased by 9% in 2020, taking the rate back to the 2009 level. Provisional estimates for Northern Ireland show that the total number of deaths in 2020 was 11.0% higher than the five-year average (2015 to 2019).\n\nThe national life tables provide estimates of \"period life expectancy\", which is the average number of additional years a person would expect to live if they experienced the age-specific mortality rates of a particular time and place throughout their lives. When producing the national life tables we average mortality observed over three years in order to smooth out the impact of exceptional events, such as a flu epidemic, on reported life expectancy.\n\nDespite this smoothing, the excess mortality observed in 2020 has led to estimates of life expectancy at birth for females in the UK for 2018 to 2020 which are virtually unchanged from 2015 to 2017, and estimates for males falling to levels reported for 2012 to 2014. The impact was slightly greater for males than for females, reflecting the larger increase in male mortality rates in 2020.\n\nThis does not mean that a baby born in 2018 to 2020 will go on to live a shorter life. The reported life expectancies assume that the higher-than-average mortality that we observed in 2018 to 2020 will continue. It is possible that life expectancy will return to an improving trend in the future, once the coronavirus pandemic has ended and its consequences for future mortality are known.\n\nWe have also published single-year life tables for the UK. These show that life expectancy at birth was 78.4 for males and 82.4 for females in 2020, a decline of 63 weeks and 45 weeks for males and females respectively compared with 2019, reflecting the higher mortality observed in 2020. Single-year life tables are volatile and a less robust indicator of mortality trends than three-year life tables. For more information see Strengths and limitations.\n\nOther measures of lifespan\n\nWe can also look to other measures of lifespan, such as the modal (or most common) age at death, or the median age at death (the age at which exactly half the deaths in a time period were below and half were above). These measures give values more closely associated with \"typical\" ages of death and are always values higher than life expectancy at birth, as they are less influenced by deaths at younger ages and are more sensitive to improvements in mortality at older ages.\n\nDownload this table Table 1: Average lifespan in years, Males\n\n.xls .csv\n\nDownload this table Table 2: Average lifespan in years, Females\n\n.xls .csv\n\nThe modal age at death in the UK in 2018 to 2020 was 86.7 years for males and 89.3 years for females, in comparison with 86.5 years and 89.0 years respectively in 2015 to 2017.\n\nThe median age at death was 82.3 years for males and 85.8 years for females, in comparison with 82.4 years and 85.8 years in 2015 to 2017.\n\nThese measures show that the age at which death typically occurred in 2018 to 2020 was very similar to 2015 to 2017, and in fact the modal age at death increased between the two periods.\n\nAnother measure of lifespan are cohort life expectancies which allow for projected improvement in mortality over time. Our Past and projected life tables include both period and cohort life expectancies and will be updated in December 2021, alongside the 2020-based interim national population projections.\n\nBack to table of contents\n\n4. Life expectancy at older ages\n\nImprovements in life expectancy at age 65 years have also slowed over the last decade. In 2018 to 2020, life expectancy at age 65 years in the UK is 18.5 years for males and 21.0 years for females. These estimates are very similar to those for 2015 to 2017 with a slight decline of 1.0 week for males and an increase of 3.1 weeks for females.\n\nUK life expectancy at age 90 years was 4.0 years for males and 4.6 years for females in 2018 to 2020. Life expectancy at age 90 years fluctuates slightly each year. While improvements in life expectancy at age 90 years have been low for several years, we are still seeing an increasing number of people aged 90 years and over in the UK. This is because previous improvements in mortality over many decades have resulted in an increasing proportion (and number) of people reaching age 90 years over time.\n\n2020 was a notable year for the number of centenarians living in the UK, which reached 15,120 people, an increase of nearly one-fifth (18%) compared with 2019. This increase in centenarians includes a 52% increase in the number of those aged 100 years, which in turn is driven by historical birth patterns; those people turning 100 last year were part of the spike in births following the end of World War One. Further analysis on this topic is available in Estimates of the very old, including centenarians, UK: 2002 to 2020.\n\nBack to table of contents"
