        "text": "The Drama International Short Film Festival (DISFF) will include 27 films from 21 countries including Greece and take place from September 2 to 8, its organizer and cinematographer Giorgos Zois said on Wednesday, ANA reports.\n\nGreek directors, established and emerging, will participate with a total of 62 films that will premiere both nationally and internationally in Greece's northeastern city of Drama.\n\nAt a press conference to present its program, Zois said that this year the international section of the festival is focusing on growing up stories for teenagers and young people and their integration into society, as well as on a rising economic class gap that condemns people of all ages to an endless struggle for survival.\n\nBesides Greece, the countries competing under the international section of DISFF include Belgium, Canada, China, Colombia, Estonia, Finland, France, Germany, Haiti, Iran, Italy, Kosovo, Lebanon, Netherlands, Peru, Philippines, Spain, Sweden, United Kingdom, and the United States.\n\nAs of last year, Greek and international films that receive awards will be automatically eligible to run in the annual Academy Awards, which will lead to an Oscar.\n\nRELATED TOPICS: Greece, Greek tourism news, Tourism in Greece, Greek islands, Hotels in Greece, Travel to Greece, Greek destinations, Greek travel market, Greek tourism statistics, Greek tourism report\n\nPhoto Source: Wikimedia Commons License: CC-BY-SA Copyright: Pitichinaccio"
