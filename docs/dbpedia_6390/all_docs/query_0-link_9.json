        "text": "The National Day is a designated date on which celebrations mark the nationhood of a nation or non-sovereign country. This nationhood can be symbolized by the date of independence, of becoming a republic or a significant date for a patron saint or a ruler (birthday, accession, removal, etc.). Often the day is not called \"National Day\" but serves and can be considered as one. The National Day will often be a national holiday. text from Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia\n\n1 January Cuba Revolution Day 26 January Australia Australia Day 26 January India Republic Day 4 February Sri Lanka Independence Day 11 February Iran Anniversary of the Islamic Revolution 15 February Serbia National Day 16 February Lithuania Independence Day 24 February Estonia Independence Day 3 March Bulgaria Liberation Day 6 March Ghana Independence Day 17 March Ireland Saint Patrick's Day 25 March Greece Independence Day 16 April Denmark Birthday of H.M.
