        "text": "Kevin Macdonald's documentary One Day in September is the bizarre story of great events repeating themselves, not as farce but as minor Olympic event. For all its occasional naivety and bias, Macdonald's film is a riveting and hallucinatory recapitulation of 20th-century history: in 1945, the horrifying crimes of Germany lead to the foundation of the state of Israel, which in turn lead to the mass dispossession of the Palestinian people, and 27 years later the Germans, the Jews and the Arabs meet in a bloody, slapstick collision at the 1972 Olympic Games in Munich.\n\nOn September 5, 1972, eight members of the Black September terrorist group attempted to draw attention to the Palestinian plight by disguising themselves as athletes at the Munich games and taking the Israeli athletes hostage. Within 24 hours all the hostages and all but three of the terrorists were dead in a bizarre tale of high drama, low cunning and bad faith, mainly on the part of the West German authorities - hapless, shrugging incompetents whom the film indicts as effectively complicit in the murder of the Israelis.\n\nThe social and political fabric of 70s continental Europe, as revived in Macdonald's film, has an unearthly strangeness: not larky retro naffness, but a weird mixture of paranoia and earnest liberalism. The idealism of the 60s was beginning to sour; anger and violence were becoming part of the currency of politics, but - yet to atone for the war - a faintly amnesiac social democracy and righteousness was being propagated in West Germany (and how ancient that partitionist term already sounds).\n\nThe atmosphere was a mixture of Frederick Forsyth and Heinrich BÃ¶ll. And it was into this sideburned world that Mary Peters, Olga Korbut and Mark Spitz made their entrance to compete for Olympic glory and, extraordinarily, were instructed by the International Olympic Committee to keep doing so even while the hostages were dead and dying.\n\nOne Day in September reminds us of the bizarre sight of the children of all nations of the globe in the Olympic village sunbathing and playing ping-pong live on TV as the horrible carnage proceeded - a hyperreal paradigm of an uncaring but fully media-connected world. And far from showing solidarity with the Israelis, Mark Spitz made an inglorious and panicky exit from West Germany on the grounds that as a Jew he was in \"danger\". The irony is almost hilarious: if ever there was a time when the Israelis needed the Germans to show their ruthless, efficient Nazi steel, it was now. But no. The postwar settlement meant they had no proper military, so a Dad's Army of border guards got beginners' training in machine pistols and then manoeuvred into position, wearing tracksuits. But this disguise was undermined by their wearing old-fashioned achtung- Englander! coal-scuttle helmets. A bit of a giveaway. Also, the terrorists could watch them live on TV.\n\nLater, when a crack troop of armed German police was supposed to overpower the terrorists at a nearby airfield, they took a vote and unilaterally called off the action because it was too dangerous. Not exactly the spirit of Rommel.\n\nMacdonald's footage, though seen before, remains jaw-dropping. Interviews with an old Mossad chief make it clear that Israeli rage at this is still fresh, and they are still bitter about the fact that Germans refused to let the Israelis mount a rescue mission on their soil. Their suspicion is unmistakeable: the Germans can be chillingly militaristic, but only when they feel like it. Macdonald's interviews with the German civilian and military personnel make uncomfortable viewing. One middle-aged general gigglingly admitted that it was an uproarious foul-up and smirkingly confessed that the West German government did indeed conspire to stage a phoney kidnap drama so that the three remaining Black September terrorists could be shipped out to Libya without the necessity of a trial.\n\nIf Macdonald's film is tough on the Germans, it is lax and naive about the Palestinian cause. There are plenty of gung-ho and faintly redundant computer reconstructions of the abortive police ambush strategy on the night; the families of murdered Israeli athletes are extensively and sympathetically interviewed, and gruesome police pictures of the corpses are shown, but there is no balancing attempt to make sense of the Arab and Palestinian experience of oppression. The sole surviving Black September gang member - Jamal Al-Hashey - is interviewed in shadow, and the film passes very lightly over the fact that he was kept at the Chatila refugee camp, without dwelling on the resonance of that.\n\nBut getting him to speak on camera at all is something. Israeli assassination squads have already taken out the two other terrorist survivors of the Munich games, and there is no peace process for Al-Hashey, no Stormont-type jobs, no Mo Mowlam hugs. All he can expect, and clearly does expect, is a bullet in the back of the head.\n\nThe film could have done with more interviews with the athletes of the time, who would all have had fascinating tales to tell, and Macdonald could have used more penetrative talking-head pieces, as Leon Gast did for When We Were Kings, teasing out the intersection of sport, politics and history in the 1974 Ali-Frasier rumble in the jungle. But for all its faults, Macdonald's documentary is very watchable: an under-reported chapter in the secret history of the 20th century."
