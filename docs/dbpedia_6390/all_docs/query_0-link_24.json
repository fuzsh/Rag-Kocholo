Honor and commemorate the sacrifices made that day by remembering the heroes, armed forces, first responders, and countless others’ acts of service to defend our nation’s freedom.\n\nOn the September 11 National Day of Service and Remembrance, Americans of all ages and backgrounds are again invited to join and lead community service projects to honor the lives and service of those we lost on September 11. Cross divides, differences, and ideologies to serve with neighbors and strangers alike to build important bridges in your communities.\n\nThe 9/11 Day of Service is Wednesday, Sept. 11, 2024. You and your partners are encouraged to engage with your community and create lasting impact."
