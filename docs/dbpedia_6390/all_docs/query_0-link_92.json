        "text": "Take a short survey to help us improve the Texas Secretary of State website.\n\nCurrent Processing Time - We are currently processing mailed apostille/authentication requests received August 12, 2024.\n\nThe Office of the Texas Secretary of State (the Office) is the only state agency authorized to issue certificates to authenticate Texas public records that will be used outside of the United States. These certificates are known as authentications, or Apostilles. Effective October 1, 2023, the Office will issue a single certificate universal Apostille. The universal Apostille can be accepted in all countries, but must be further authenticated by the Office of Authentications at the US State Department for countries that are not a party to the Apostille Convention, prior to submission at the country of destination.\n\nPublic records can be recordable documents or non-recordable documents. Recordable documents are issued by a statewide agency/officer and are not permitted to be certified by a notary public. Alternatively, non-recordable documents are not issued by statewide agencies/officers and can be notarized in English by a Texas Notary Public to be considered a public record.\n\nInternational Adoption\n\nOur office can provide a Universal Apostille for the documents necessary for the international adoption process. Please be sure to utilize the proper form and submit the $10 fee. You can review more information on this on our FAQ page.\n\nBusiness Filings"
