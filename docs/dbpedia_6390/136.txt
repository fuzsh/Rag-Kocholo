The United Kingdom is a state made up of the historic countries of England, Wales and Scotland, as well as Northern Ireland. It is known as the home of both modern parliamentary democracy and the Industrial Revolution.

Two world wars and the end of empire diminished its role in the 20th Century, and the 2016 referendum vote to leave the European Union has raised significant questions about the country's global role.

Nonetheless, the United Kingdom remains an economic and military power with great political and cultural influence around the world.

His Majesty King Charles III ascended to the throne in September 2022, on the death of his mother Queen Elizabeth II.

In September 2015, she had become Britain's longest-reigning monarch, surpassing the record of her great-great grandmother Queen Victoria.

At 73, King Charles was the oldest person to have ascended to the British throne. He is also head of state of several independent countries in the Commonwealth.

As a constitutional monarch, his role in the legislative process is largely ceremonial.

Prime Minister: Keir Starmer

Keir Starmer was elected prime minister in the July 2024 election, which saw a sweeping Labour party victory after 14 years of Conservative or Conservative-led governments, with Labour becoming the largest party in the House of Commons.

Domestically, Starmer has said his administration will focus on economic growth, reforms of the planning system, infrastructure, energy, healthcare, education, childcare, and strengthening workers' rights.

In his first address to parliament following the election, he urged new MPs to deliver "national renewal". He hoped the new parliament would replace the "politics of performance with the politics of service" and that all MPs have a duty to show that politics can be a force for good.

There are numerous challenges facing the Labour government: these include stagnant economic growth and wages, high child poverty and homelessness, crumbling health care and public services, overcrowded prisons and sewage pollution by privatised utility companies.

The UK has a strong tradition of public service broadcasting and an international reputation for creative programme-making.

The BBC began daily radio broadcasts in 1922 and quickly came to play a pivotal role in national life. The corporation is funded by a licence fee, which every household with a TV set must pay.

Hundreds of privately-owned radio and TV stations now compete with the BBC for listeners and viewers.

There are many national and local newspapers, but print circulations have been sliding while online readership has surged.
