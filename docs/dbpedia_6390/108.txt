September ushers a light pre-autumn breeze through this most gorgeous Italian region, after three or so months of intense heat. It’s still warm enough for poolside lounging and al-fresco suppers on the grounds of historic villas and grand hotels, but the temperatures ease off enough as the month progresses for adventure seekers, hikers and culture vultures to explore. While buses and trains run through this corner of the country, it’s more reliable to hire a car for a short trip. This grants reliable access to historic cities, towns, and villages, from the museums and visible Medici legacy of Tuscany’s capital, Florence, to the fairytale scenes of San Gimignano.

Where to stay

Tuscany is an ideal destination for intergenerational escapes, so round up the family and secure a dreamy villa through a company such as Oliver's Travels or Airbnb. For a romantic trip far from the city heat, check into Castello di Vicarello – a renovated 12th-century castle run by a family with a keen eye for immaculate design.

The golden sands, clear waters and charming towns of Cornwall have long been a favourite staycation spot among Britons. However, visit once the schools return after the extended summer break, and it’s a relatively adults-only haven. Granted, the weather might not be as reliable as it is in July and August, but there are still balmy days to be had. Time a visit with the St Ives September Festival and see the stunning seaside resort at its buzziest, as local venues host live music and events for two weeks.

Where to stay

Perfect Stays has some of the most exceptional homes in the county on its rental roster, with a team on hand to ensure any requirements are met for group and family trips. For an indulgent hotel stay, look no further than Fowey Hall Hotel, a stately hotel a short way from Coombe Haven Beach.

When isn't a good time to go to Sicily? The warm wind that blows across the Mediterranean from Africa keeps Italy's sunniest, most richly cultured island hot well into autumn (you might still get a heatwave), though its wild and beautiful beaches are never crowded in September; yet it's cool enough for exploring the labyrinthine streets of its enchanting baroque towns. Memorable meals are to be had everywhere – September is a fine time for fruit and produce from Etna's rich national park; and there's no problem getting a room in the charming hotels.

Where to stay: At Belmond Grand Hotel Timeo, where pool views look good from all angles and a pianist (and Negronis) cajole couples to dance on the balcony against a menacing backdrop of Mount Etna. If you're looking for a city break, take over this sleek Palermo apartment that's within walking distance of all the iconic spots. For more, see our pick of the best hotels in Sicily.

Simply one of the loveliest places in the world, at any time of year, the Cotswolds. Its loveliness wraps itself around you like the early morning mist among the orchards; its drystone cottages and honeycomb-coloured Cotswold stone buildings, ancient and eternal, clambered all over by rambling roses and wisteria; its trickling rivers and weeping willows and wild swans; gentle landscapes and the quaintness of its beautiful villages, and all those country-house hotels for a weekend break in the UK. September brings the harvest, when the local produce is at its best, and the hunter's rich pickings are cooked magnificently in all of the best restaurants in the Cotswolds.

Where to stay: We love Thyme, an idyllic old Cotswold-stone manor with beautifully renovated barns. The Stump is a cosy roadside-inn-turned-pizza-shack just six miles from Cirencester. If you're travelling in a group, takeover No.6, a converted barn that sleeps 10 and set on the edge of the Blenheim Palace Estate in Oxfordshire. See our favourite hotels in the Cotswolds for more recommendations.

It’s no mystery Lisbon is so popular these days. What’s not to like? Afternoons are for climbing its seven hills in search of the best miradouros – terraces with poetic views over its pastel houses and red rooftops – while evenings are best spent in Lisbon's best restaurants, where sensational seafood is fresh from the neighbouring ocean. Night-owls make a beeline for Bairro Alto. Lax open-container laws make the city’s central district a party – join and drink in the dawn. September has fabulous weather – averages of 26°C – and you’ll get the city to yourself, as the unlucky masses have gone back to school.

Where to stay: The Ivens gets our pick for one of the best new(ish) hotels in the world, while Memmo Alfama might just have the best rooftop pool in the city. For a budget stay, try The Independente, a charming hotel-meets-hostel where rooms are from £100 a night. If you'd like to stay close to the sea, this beach apartment is on Costa da Caparica, one of the best beaches in Lisbon. See more options at our edit of the best hotels in Lisbon.

Ireland’s most scenic city is a blast any time of year, but the Galway International Oyster Festival is an excellent reason for going in September. On the last weekend of the month, the beginning of the native oyster harvest is celebrated with parades, the World Oyster Opening Championships (really) and devotees slurping hundreds of the delicacies with stout and Champagne. Sitting pretty on the River Corrib, the harbour town has always been a favourite for its waterside views, snug pubs and super-fresh seafood. But today, it’s also a standard-bearer for west-coast produce, leading the way in local, organic, farm-to-fork cooking (see Michelin-starred Loam’s seasonal tasting menus). A bit of contemporary culture comes courtesy of Coffeewerk + Press: part third-wave coffeehouse, part art gallery, part design shop. Galway’s sustainable food scene isn’t just limited to Michelin-starred affairs such as Loam. Other pioneers include Tartare Café and Wine Bar (local, farm-fresh ingredients; organic and natural wines; compostable cups and napkins), Kai (as well as serving a daily-changing menu of local ingredients, the restaurant recycles all its waste, with around 25 per cent of it converted into fuel) and Dela, which grows its own produce, allowing for a ‘plot to plate time of minutes’.

Where to stay: Wild Honey Inn in County Clare, Ireland’s first Michelin-star pub.

Ask an islander what their favourite month on Santorini is, and they'll likely tell you September. The boiling, broiling summer rush is over, the sea is warmer than ever and the skies are blue, blue, all day long, and the evenings are cooler in its up-steps-and-down hillside towns. September sunsets paint the town of Oia gold, and the deep blues of the Caldera seem heightened in these days of late summer.

Where to stay: For a romantic stay, check in to Andronis Boutique Hotel, where rooms are dotted around the curves of the hotel's traditional cave-style architecture. For families, The Vasilicos is a boutique hideaway and one of the few hotels on the island that doesn't have an adults-only policy. We also love Grace Hotel, Auberge Resorts Collection, a white-washed, cliff-side dream where all the rooms have terraces and there are two pools. See our best hotels in Santorini guide for more.

Morocco saturates the senses. See Marrakech’s chaotic medinas; the raggedly isolated mud-wall towns of the High Atlas; Essaouira’s salty sea air and sun-dappled surf. All are at their finest in September. As the summer sizzle mellows, both Atlantic and Mediterranean coasts remain bikini-balmy, while the winter chill that grasps desert nights and mountain villages is yet to take hold. And a smart new crop of design hotels – typically airy riads with crisp courtyard pools, renovated by French fashion photographers and Italian aristocrats – makes Morocco an especially stylish place to lay one’s head. Fez, a vast, medieval warren of a city, has been busy restoring its ancient buildings and monuments, so there’s no end of historic houses, palaces and secret gardens, mosques and mausoleums to explore. Note: you'll see a lot of working horses and donkeys in Morocco – happily, many of them are protected by SPANA, an international organisation that works with some of the world’s poorest communities to improve the welfare of working animals, and to educate their handlers in animal rights. So if you’re offered a horse and cart ride, and the horse is wearing a SPANA tag (often around the ankle), go for it: your money validates SPANA’s efforts.

Where to stay: Within the city, La Mamounia and Royal Mansour top our list of the best hotels in Marrakech. In Taghazout, Munga Guesthouse is a 15-room boutique stay with an fairylit, indoor-outdoor restaurant. For Essaouira, the cool Riad Dar Maya is all sand-coloured plaster and modern Moroccan minimalism with a hot tub on the roof.

New York we love you, every day of the year, but possibly in September most of all. For the weather, for the new season, and all the fresher air of autumn and possibility of a new season and that new season's styles, the way the city gears up again after sultry, away-on-Long Island August. (Yes, for that matter, Long Island is lovely end-of-season in September, too, from the Hamptons to Montauk.) Or combine New York City with an Upstate New York roadtrip to the Catskills, all that autumnal mellow mistiness and sense of nostalgia for a thing you never even had, listening to the Grateful Dead as you wind through the trees to your log cabin.

Where to stay: Try the Ace Hotel in Brooklyn or Pendry Manhattan West in Midtown, both featured on our 2022 Hot List of the best new hotels in the world. Downtown, buzzy spots like PUBLIC Hotel on the Lower East Side and Hotel 50 Bowery in Chinatown are great for nightlife and people watching. See our pick of the best hotels in New York for more.

Those crazy free spirits who spend the season out in Ibiza and Formentera breathe a sigh of relief when September comes. At last you can get a spot to shake out your towel on the beaches again, and a table for lunch at a beach restaurant without so much as a booking (even at Formentera's famous Juan y Andrea). It's all still hot, hot, hot, the closing parties are the clubbing highlights of the season, and hotels and villas suddenly become a lot more affordable – though you'll still have to take out a loan for drinks. Embracing the White Isle’s natural assets is the best way to make a trip here sustainable. La Granja, for example, is a chic inland farmstead that serves slow food from its own biodynamic garden, and works with the Ibiza Preservation Fund to support the island’s organic farmers. In it for the beaches? Rent a solar-powered charter yacht from La Bella Verde and explore the coast’s quieter corners.

Where to stay: OKU Ibiza, a laid-back luxury retreat with a privileged location that gives you access to the most beautiful beach spots on the island. For sunbeds and sushi, it's hard to beat the chic set up at Nobu Ibiza bay. See more options at our best hotels in Ibiza edit or check out our round-up of the best villas in Ibiza and Formentera.

Massive, messy Mexico City has never been cooler. The lively capital’s young, artsy vibe is everywhere: at the colourful cafés clad in geometric-print tiles; in chic, farm-fresh brunches and craft cocktails blended with home-brewed botanicals; at the urban market in an old auto parts warehouse hawking local designers. September is the last drop of rainy season, which keeps this always-busy megalopolis short of tourists; what they don’t know is the rain tends to come at night, and in quick, sudden fits. By day, it’s 25°C and perfect for nibbling on street eats (pick your lime-doused grilled corn straight from the wheelbarrow) or exploring the city’s most fashionable 'hood: leafy, bohemian Roma Norte. (yes, of Oscar-winning film fame).

Where to stay: Octavia Casa, a seven-room retreat in La Condesa created by Fashion designer Roberta Maceda. We also love Circulo Mexicano for its calming Shaker-simple bedrooms and chilled-out rooftop with pool and Japanese soaking tub.

The shoulder seasons – April-May, September-October – tend to be the most pleasant time to visit Greece and the Greek islands. But blue as the Ionian Sea is, it's still chilly in springtime – so we will plump for September in Corfu, when our morning swim is a warm and delicious affair, when the island's forested hills are still green for afternoon dozes beneath the oaks and olive trees.

Where to stay: At Domes Miramare, which was once the summer mansion of shipping magnate Aristotle Onassis and is now an adults-only hotel standing above its own private beach. Families should look to Grecotel Corfu Imperial, glamorous resort where many of the rooms and bungalows have private pools. See more at our best hotels in Corfu guide.

Istanbul has always been a cultural giant. It straddles two continents and sits on a major branch of the Silk Road, so pretty much every marauder has left their mark here through the ages, creating a city that’s richly diverse in its art, food and mood. And every September, the Turkish capital proves its contemporary cultural chops with the art fair Contemporary Istanbul, where show-stopping installations, sculptures and canvases showcase the region’s most intriguing works. For more cutting-edge Istanbul, head to Beyoğlu, the ultimate good-times hood. When not at a gig, boutique shopping or bar-hopping, check out New Anatolian Cuisine at Mikla, where the lamb-shank dumplings with smoked buffalo yogurt might just change your life.

Where to stay: Soho House Istanbul is set in a 19th-century palace in the city's coolest district. For more options, see our pick of the best hotels in Istanbul.

Less than two hours’ drive from Cape Town, Hermanus has grown from fishing village to popular seaside destination for good reason: it offers the world’s best land-based whale-watching. Come in late September, when the Hermanus Whale Festival celebrates peak season for southern right whales breaching close to shore. Though the fest brings heaps of entertainment – live music, vintage car shows, street food, kids’ activities – spare some time for exploring Hermanus beyond the crowds. It’s at its very best on gorgeous cliffside walks, secluded white-sand beaches (Voëlklip is made for picnicking), or at refined countryside restaurants – The Restaurant at Newton Johnson is set on its own farm, overlooking the winery’s vines. If you're keen to spot some whales, land-based whale watching is about as un-invasive as it gets, and saves on pollution produced by boats. So, while plenty of operations offer whale-watching boat tours here, why bother when the view is so good from terra firma? Hermanus even has its own ‘whale crier’, who helpfully roams around blowing on a kelp horn to alert you to sightings.

It is a surprising fact that it rains more in Milan than in Manchester. Still, never let bad weather stand in the way of a truly splendid city break. Go in September, which has the fewest rainy days of any month in Milan, and an average daytime temperature of 24ºC. Go new-season shopping and spend too much money on some excellent boots which will keep your feet dry and make you happy in the cold, wet months ahead. Or go to Manchester, and tell everyone that it may be raining, but at least it's not as wet as Milan.

Where to stay: Try the Four Seasons Hotel Milano for a luxurious stay in the city centre or checkin to the Hotel Principe di Savoia, one of the city's grand dames. See more on our edit of the best hotels in Milan.

It's definitely still sunshine season in September in Barcelona – temperatures average around 25ºC in the daytime, a balmy 19ºC at night. The locals are back from their holidays, but everyone's still going to the beach and eating out and partying like mad to make the most of the last days of summer. Catalonia's national holiday is on 11 September, when the city closes for parades, concerts and celebrations, and the Fiestas de la Mercè is a week-long festival, the biggest of the year, with hundreds of musicians and carnivals, performances and gigs, planned and impromptu, all over the city.

Where to stay: Design-lovers should make a beeline for The Hoxton in Pobelnou, where some rooms come with a view of the La Sagrada Familia. Another great option is Nobu Hotel Barcelona, a glitzy blend of Japanese minimalism and comfortable luxury. ME Barcelona has an unbeatable city location plus a rooftop sundeck and pool.

This UNESCO-listed river valley is the epitome of bucolic bliss. Little wonder French royalty of yore ditched Paris for its gentle pastures, scattering myriad romantic châteaux across the landscape, plopped amid sprawling manicured gardens or perched on placid lakes. As the back-to-school crowds filter out, take advantage and meander its villages and vineyards in relative peace. Plus, the first weekend of September is marked by the annual Vines, Wines and Walks festival, where visitors choose between various wine trails, led by local winemakers – so you can stroll, sip and chomp the finest cheese with the help of an expert guide.

“Exotic” barely covers it. Zanzibar is another world. Its beaches are mirage-like: salt-white sand, ocean toned electric-blue. Mythical, Unesco-listed Stone Town is an ancient maze built on trade between disparate cultures: Arab, Persian, Indian, European. The scent of cloves fills the bazaars, and gothic churches mingle with domed mosques and Persian hammams. Hotels here are smarter of late; see the waterside Park Hyatt, or Zuri Zanzibar’s thatched villas. September is dry – before the ‘short rains’ of November and December – and not so stifling at around 27°C. Note: you’ll see a lot of operators offering the chance to swim with dolphins in Zanzibar – don’t do it. Tanzania is one of only a few spots in the world with no official regulations to limit the impact of tourism on its dolphin population, and bad practices abound.

They call it the Paris of South America, but Buenos Aires has long tangoed to its own beat. Nothing feels quite like wandering the tree-lined streets of its largest barrio, Palermo, past rainbow-hued street art and bohemian coffee haunts, quirky galleries and fashion boutiques. It’s more seductive still in September, when the cold winter is easing off, but still-thin crowds largely comprise fun-loving locals and expats. Life-changing steaks and chic cocktail bars beckon at every corner; new – and hard-to-get-into – speakeasy Uptown BA recreates a New York Subway station. On the bright side, low-fare long-haul airline Norwegian just launched a direct flight from Gatwick, so there should be plenty of pesos in your pocket for bribing the bouncer.

Tourist-spotting is easy in San Francisco: just look for the people dressed for summer, teeth a-chattering. The City by the Bay is prone to chill winds and bracing fog, particularly in the summer months. September, though, is when the California dream kicks in, all clear blue skies and certified sun. Soak up those cherished rays with the tech wunderkinds in so-hot-right-now Mission district, where flamboyant sunbathers fill palm-dotted Dolores Park, and weekend brunchers order organic pop tarts in the courtyard of a converted Art Deco movie palace, Foreign Cinema. Or do as the proper locals do and head across the Golden Gate Bridge to Napa and Sonoma. The vineyards seldom look better than when soaked in autumn’s warm glow.

July and August are the busiest months in French Polynesia. Hold out until September and, as well as having more overwater bungalows to choose from, the weather’s still heaven. No heavy rains until November; none of the later months’ humidity to force on the air-con. Just blue, blue lagoons and the kind of peace you only find at the end of the world. Though it’s the very picture of paradise, locals call Bora Bora “boring boring”. For a quick culture dose, head out of your resort and visit the pearl farms of quiet Taha’a, or meet the blue-eyed, giant sacred river eels of lush Huahine (but maybe leave it to your guide to feed them). Try to get out of your resort and look for local tour operators offering excursions with an eco bent. Nani Travels, for example, was founded by a young Tahitian, Alexandrine Wan, and offers the likes of helping with coral-reef restoration, e-biking around Mo’orea island’s pineapple fields and monitoring shark populations.

Utah’s “Mighty Five” national parks live up to the moniker, but there’s such a thing as too much demand. Congestion at Arches and Zion is so bad now, officials are proposing reservations-only entry. Although those plans have been shelved for now, to really feel the magic of these landscapes you’ll need to escape the mob. September, after Labor Day weekend, is the sweet spot: the summer crush is gone, but temperatures are still moderate, so you can comfortably hike those incredible trails. This is American scenery at its largest: nothing but great rock cathedrals, blush-pink cliffs and rust-red canyons for miles. And with Under Canvas, you can camp right among them. Though the “Mighty Five” get all the press – and the visitors – Utah also has an impressive state parks system, with landscapes that vary from Mars-like stone forests (Goblin Valley) to bison-speckled beaches (Antelope Island). Visiting state parks takes pressure off the nationals and gives you a crowd-free experience, while also signalling to authorities that every inch of Utah’s wilderness is worth protecting.

Where to stay: At Under Canvas, which is 10 miles north of Moab, safari-style tents have en-suite bathrooms and luxe king-size beds, while mornings bring fresh coffee and cinnamon French toast.

The evenings may be drawing in, but as night falls its cool neighbourhood 'ruin pubs' are lit up by fairylights and full up with a young crowd drinking cocktails outdoors in these pop-up bars set up in crumbling buildings.

It might not quite be the “new Croatia” just yet, but that’s part of the appeal — this Balkan gem has so far managed to remain largely off-radar. There’s always some hardy adventurer ready to be first, though; in the unspoiled Albanian Alps, Brooklyn native Catherine and her Albanian partner run five-room farmhouse Hotel Rilindja, a cosy oasis amid peaks and meadows, where evenings bring feasts of spit-roasted whole goat and fresh reservoir trout. Or escape to the Albanian Riviera for glorious golden sands and clear, cobalt water lapping craggy coves. In summer, the beaches are packed with fugitives from Tirana — but come September they’re back at work, while the climate stays Mediterranean and the Adriatic keeps warm. Albania is one of the poorest countries in Europe, and only small pockets of it are benefitting from tourism: namely, the Riviera, and even then, it’s mostly in the form of day trips from cruise ships. Heading into the mountains brings you up close to more traditional, rural communities and puts your money where it matters most. While independent travel can still be tricky here, Responsible Travel offers walking, cycling, food and wine and cultural itineraries that don’t just focus on the coast.

Where to stay: In Tirana, book a room at Agroturizëm Gjepali, a pre-WWII farm turned guesthouse. In Permet, meanwhile, Villa Permet is a restored 19th-century mansion.

September is the best time for trekking in Peru – the last gasp of dry season after the summer hordes have packed up their walking poles, with clear, sunny days obliging those breath-stealing Andean views. But the Inca Trail isn’t the only hot-ticket pilgrimage around here nowadays. In 2018, chef Virgilio Martínez, of Lima’s Central (hailed the world’s second-best restaurant as of 2022), launched what might be the planet’s most ambitious eatery. Mil restaurant overlooks the lesser-seen Inca ruins of Moray, just 30 miles from trekker gateway Cusco; the menu features only ingredients found here, a dizzying 11,500ft above sea level. The foodie odyssey continues in Peru’s increasingly buzzy capital, with plenty of charming hole-in-the-walls dishing out fresh, citrus-kissed ceviche. Better still, September water temps are best for sampling Lima’s surf scene. Straying off the beaten track will bring more sols to the people who need them most, and one place that’s especially true is Chaparri Ecological Reserve. On Peru’s northern coast, the reserve – home to rare species including the spectacled bear and the puma – is owned and managed by the local community. However, land speculators have, in recent times, aggressively attempted encroachment on this protected territory. Visiting is the best way to give locals much-needed resources to help them keep up their good work.

The original ultimate safari heavyweight is back in the game and is becoming the safari destination to watch. There are some fantastic new lodges opening up in Zimbabwe's exceptional and little-visited national parks, and beside the Victoria Falls. September is one of the best months to go to Zimbabwe for game-viewing, when wildlife congregates around the diminishing watering holes as the temperatures begin to rise and rain is rare, and large elephant herds can be seen in Hwange National Park. It may be high season, but the parks here never get crowded.

Where to stay: Mpala Jena – a tented safari camp on the banks of the upper Zambezi River, close to Victoria Falls – is the perfect spot to discover everything this part of Zimbabwe has to offer: the river, the falls and the wildlife.

Italy's glittering Amalfi Coast is a summer big-hitter for a reason. But we recommend skipping this slice of the country during high summer, and visiting in shoulder season instead – the days are still long and sunshiny, and the coastline's lovely towns and handsome hotels will be far quieter. Amalfi's best beaches will be less crowded, too; don't miss Marina Piccolais, one of the most beautiful of the lot. Spend days visiting the prettiest Amalfi Coast towns – we like seaside towns Minori and Maiori, just a mile apart from one another – or eat at some of the best restaurants not just on the Amalfi Coast, but in the whole of Italy.

Where to stay: 17th-century former monastery Monastero Santa Rosa is a glamorous hotel hovering above the shoreline. Belmond Caruso Ravello, meanwhile, dates back even further, set in an 11th-century ivy-clad building. See our guide to the best hotels on the Amalfi Coast for more ideas.

It's the question we all want to know the answer to: when is the best time to visit Bali? Rainy season is from October to March, while the dry season runs from April to September. Aiming for the outer edges of the dry season is your best bet – making September the perfect time to visit. Get under the skin of secret Bali at slow-pace villages, or visit some of the best beaches in Bali for a last gasp of sunshine before British winter kicks in closer to home.

Where to stay: The best Bali hotels include Bill Bensley's Capella Ubud, a luxe tented camp, and Lost Lindenberg, a whipsmart fresh arrival.
