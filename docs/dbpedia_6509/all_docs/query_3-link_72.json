        "text": "A time zone is a region of the Earth that has the same standard time. Time zones are primarily based on longitudinal lines and are designed to divide the Earth into 24 roughly equal segments, each representing one hour of time difference from the adjacent zones.\n\nThe concept of time zones became necessary with the expansion of railways and telegraph lines in the 19th century when there was a need for standardized timekeeping across vast distances. Prior to time zones, local mean solar time was used, which could vary significantly from one location to another.\n\nEach time zone corresponds to a standard time offset from Coordinated Universal Time (UTC) or Greenwich Mean Time (GMT). UTC is often used as a reference because it is based on highly precise atomic clocks. Some regions within time zones may adjust their local time by shifting forward or backward by one hour during certain periods of the year, a practice known as Daylight Saving Time. DST is used to make better use of natural daylight during the longer days of the year."
