Unlike most time zones, Iran has a half-hour offset instead of the usual full-hour offset.\n\nIRST Time Zone Meridian\n\nIran bases its standard time specifically on the solar time at 52.5Â° east longitude, which runs about 400 km (250 miles) east of Tehran. The same meridian is used in the Persian Solar Hijri calendar, or Iranian calendar, to set the start of the year, known as Norooz.\n\nIran observes Iran Standard Time all year. There are no Daylight Saving Time clock changes.\n\nDST in Iran removed in 2022"
