For example, set year, month, day for today, and additionally hour, minute, second for now.\n\nIf there are more than 4 digits, and if no other date fields have been previously read, then interpret as a \"concatenated date\" (e.g. 19990118). 8 and 6 digits are interpreted as year, month, and day, while 7 and 5 digits are interpreted as year, day of year, respectively.\n\nIf in European date mode, and if the day field has not yet been read, and if the value is less than or equal to 31, then interpret as a day.\n\nIf the month field has not yet been read, and if the value is less than or equal to 12, then interpret as a month.\n\nIf the day field has not yet been read, and if the value is less than or equal to 31, then interpret as a day."
