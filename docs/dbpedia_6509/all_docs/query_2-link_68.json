        "text": "Manage the Proactive Voice and SMS Curfew\n\nTo comply with proactive dialing and SMS messaging laws, you must set the allowed time zones for dialing in your contact center. You can do this at the and ACD level. You can customize the default allowable dialing time range for an ACD skill, record, or phone number to ensure your contact center doesn't dial or text outside of legal hours.\n\nModify Allowed Time Zones for the Business Unit\n\nRequired permissions: External Business Unit View and Business Unit Time Zones Edit\n\nClick the app selector and select ACD.\n\nGo to ACD Configuration > Business Units.\n\nClick the business unit you want to modify.\n\nClick Time Zones.\n\nIf you want to add time zones to those allowed for dialing and SMS messaging in your business unit, select those time zones in the Add Time Zones table. Click Add Time Zones.\n\nIf you want to remove time zones from those allowed for dialing and SMS messaging in your business unit, select those time zones in the Assigned Time Zones table. Click Remove Time Zones. Click Yes in the confirmation window.\n\nModify Allowed Time Zones for the ACD Skill\n\nRequired permissions: Skills Edit\n\nBy default, Personal Connection (PC) can dial or send SMS messages to people in time zones configured at the level. You can remove time zones allowed for dialing for specific ACD and add newly-enabled time zones for the business unit to ACD skills as needed.\n\nIf you're adding a new time zone that's not already allowed in your , enable the time zone in your business unit using the preceding steps.\n\nClick the app selector and select ACD.\n\nGo to Contact Settings > ACD Skills.\n\nClick the ACD you want to modify.\n\nClick the Parameters tab.\n\nClick Edit or Configure for Time Zone Bounding.\n\nIf you want to add time zones to the ACD skill that you've recently enabled for your business unit, do the following:\n\nClick Add in the Time Zone Bounding table.\n\nIn the Time Zone window, select a Time Zone. Note that the drop-down only contains time zones you've enabled for your business unit.\n\nIf you want to automatically activate calling in the time zone between certain hours, enter a start time and an end time in the range text fields. If you want to manually activate and deactivate calling and SMS messaging in the time zone, select Manual Override. Time zones marked Inactive don't show up when you view the Skill Control Queued Calls page.\n\nIf you enable Manual Override and forget to deactivate it, you run the risk of calling people outside of legal hours.\n\nIf you want to remove time zones from the ACD skill, select the time zones in the Time Zone Bounding table and click Delete.\n\nClick Done.\n\nCreate a Custom Time Zone\n\nRequired permissions: External Business Unit View, Business Unit Time Zones Edit, Skills Edit, and Calling List Create\n\nYou can't currently create custom time zones in CXone. However, you can implement a workaround with the same functionality by utilizing the time zones you aren't using.\n\nIn the example shown in these steps, Tom Sawyer wants to limit sales calls for fence painting to Dallas, only allowing them between the hours of 10:00 AM and 2:00 PM.\n\nChoose a time zone you don't already use in your call center. Enable the time zone for your . To do so:\n\nClick the app selector and select ACD.\n\nGo to ACD Configuration > Business Units.\n\nClick the business unit you want to modify.\n\nClick the Time Zones tab.\n\nIn the Add Time Zones table, select the time zone you want to use as your custom time zone.\n\nClick Add Time Zones.\n\nIn our example, Tom Sawyer chooses to add the E. Europe time zone, which he's not currently using and doesn't need, to the list of allowable time zones for his business unit.\n\nView image\n\nClick the app selector and select ACD.\n\nGo to Contact Settings > ACD Skills.\n\nClick the ACD you want to use the custom time zone.\n\nClick the Parameters tab.\n\nClick Edit or Configure for Time Zone Bounding.\n\nClick Add in the Time Zone Bounding table.\n\nIn the Time Zone window, select the Time Zone you enabled for the business unit.\n\nCalculate the difference in time between the time zone you chose and the one you want to create. Enter the start time and end time in the time span text boxes according to the difference.\n\nIn our continuing example, Tom Sawyer wants to limit calls to Dallas to the hours of 10:00 AM through 2:00 PM. Since E. Europe is 8 hours ahead of Dallas, Tom must enter the span as 6:00 PM through 10:00 PM.\n\nView image\n\nIf you haven't already created a calling list, do so now:\n\nCalling list files can't exceed 256 MB in size or 500,000 records. Smaller calling lists result in faster upload and fresher records. Each individual record in a calling list cannot exceed a length of 512 Unicode characters. Calling list uploads support Unicode UTF-8 encoding, which includes Chinese characters and all other languages. If you're creating or editing calling lists in Microsoft Excel, take care to preserve the UTF-8 encoding format.\n\nCXone strips the formatting from phone numbers in calling lists and stores the phone numbers in a universal format. This allows phone numbers to pass between calling lists and do not call (DNC) lists without conflict.\n\nOpen a spreadsheet editor or a text editor.\n\nYou can use the first row to label your columns. This helps with automatic field mapping when you upload the calling list. If you're using a text editor, decide whether to separate the values with commas or tabs.\n\nCreate the columns for your list.\n\nFor a Proactive Voice calling list, you must have a unique identifier column and a phone number column.\n\nFor a Proactive SMS calling list, you must have a unique identifier column and an SMS phone number column.\n\nLearn more about other system fields you can map to\n\nField\n\nDetails\n\nExternal ID Required. An alphanumeric string that is the unique identification of the record.\n\nScore\n\nA relative numeric value you can use to sort records a certain way. For example, if you want PC to dial one record before another, you could give the first record a Score of 1 and the second record a Score of 2 and sort the calling list by score.\n\nCustomer Field 1 and 2\n\nA numeric value you can use for any purpose. For example, it could be an alternate record ID or an amount due.\n\nThese fields are not a method for creating custom fields in the agent application. To do that, configure the Custom Display fields in List Management PC skill parameters.\n\nCaller ID The phone number you want to display as the caller ID for this contact. The number here replaces the default caller ID value set in the skill. This number can be a 10-digit number, NANP format, or E164+ phone numbers. You are required by law to display a valid phone number that contacts can use to reach you. Priority A boolean value that indicates whether the record is a priority record. Compliance Required A boolean value that indicates whether the record requires compliance handling. Time Zone\n\nThe time zone of the contact. You can use either the full name or the list of approved abbreviations for the time zone.\n\nAFT â Afghanistan Time\n\nAKST â Alaska Standard Time\n\nAST â Atlantic Standard Time\n\nACST â Australian Central Standard Time\n\nAEST â Australian Eastern Standard Time\n\nAZOST â Azores Summer Time\n\nCVT â Cape Verde Time\n\nAMT â Caucasus Standard Time\n\nCST â Central Standard Time\n\nBTT â Bhutan Time\n\nBST â British Summer Time\n\nCET â Central European Time\n\nCEST â Central Summer European Time\n\nSBT â Soloman Islands Time\n\nBIT â Baker Island Time (Dateline)\n\nEAT â East Africa Time\n\nEAST â Easter Island Standard Time\n\nEEST â Eastern European Summer Time\n\nESAST â E.

Europe Standard Time\n\nPKT â West Asia Standard Time\n\nWPST â West Pacific Standard Time\n\nYAKT â Yakutsk Standard Time\n\nPreview Required A Boolean value that indicates whether the record requires preview handling. This setting will be ignored when Deliver Numbers Serially is enabled in the PC skill or when the record is being delivered as a callback. Agent Requests a specific agent to speak with the contact. The value is the agent ID. Override Finalization\n\nA boolean value overriding the system finalization reason. Use it to upload a record that was previously finalized and continue dialing it. If you map this column and set a contact record to False and any previous final outcomes exist for the record on this skill, PC rejects the record.\n\nIf you don't map an Override Finalization column, you can override finalized records by re-uploading them as long as the record was finalized more than two hours ago. If you upload a record that was finalized less than two hours previously, PC rejects the record.\n\nOverriding finalized records can corrupt reporting. If you want to place additional calls as a follow-up to a previous interaction, you should upload the record to a new skill and manage it as a new interaction effort.\n\nCall Request Date/Time\n\nThe date and time when PC begins delivering a scheduled callback to a skill or agent. The field contains both the date, time, and time zone in the following format: MM/DD/YYYY HH:MM:SS [-H:MM|Z].\n\nFor more information, see Upload Timed Call Requests in a Calling List.\n\nCall Request Stale Minutes The number of minutes after the Call Request Date/Time that PC continues to try to deliver a call request before retiring it. After the stale time expires, PC finalizes the record and no longer attempts it. For more information, see Upload Timed Call Requests in a Calling List. Expiration Date The date and time when the contact record expires. PC ceases all attempts to reach the contact after the specified date and time. This is an optional field that overrides the expiration date configured for the skill and the Batch Expiration Date configured for this calling list. For more information, see Set an Individual Record Expiration. Start Time The number of minutes after midnight PC begins dialing the record. For example, if you want PC to begin attempting the record at 8:00 AM in a record's respective time zone, set the value in the calling list to the value of 480.\n\nIf you map this field to a calling list, PC ignores the default start time for any applicable records.\n\nEnd Time The number of minutes after midnight the dialer stops dialing the record. For example, if you want PC to stop attempting the record at 12:00 PM in a record's respective time zone, set the value in the calling list to 720.\n\nIf you map this field to a calling list, PC ignores the default end time for any applicable records.\n\nEnter the data for each record in its own row.\n\nSave the file in one of the approved formats shown in the following images.\n\nXL or XLS.\n\nComma-delimited TXT or CSV\n\nTab-delimited TXT or CSV\n\nAdd a time zone column to your calling list. Assign the custom time zone to all records you want to restrict to it.\n\nTom modifies his calling list to assign all numbers with a Dallas area codeâ214 or 972âto the E. Europe time zone.\n\nView image\n\nSave the calling list.\n\nUpload the calling list.\n\nIf you're re-uploading a calling list after making critical updates, stop the associated ACD skill. Restart the ACD skill when you're done uploading calling lists.\n\nClick the app selector and select ACD.\n\nGo to Lists > Calling.\n\nClick Select File.\n\nRead the compliance agreement and click Accept to continue.\n\nEnter a List Name. Select the Upload New radio button if you want to select a new list from your computer, or Select Existing if you want to modify a list you already uploaded.\n\nIf uploading, click Choose File. If modifying, type the File Name or click Browse. Find and select the calling list you want to upload or use. Configure any optional fields as needed.\n\nLearn more about fields in this step\n\nField\n\nDetails\n\nList Expiration Date The date the calling list is removed from CXone. This setting doesn't affect the expiration of the individual records in the list. To set the expiration date for the records in the list, use the Batch expiration date field in the next step of the upload wizard. Skill If you want to assign the calling list to a specific ACD , select one from the Skill drop-down. You cannot upload the list to a Proactive SMS skill if there is no message template assigned to the skill.\n\nStart Skill When Completed\n\nThe Skill you selected starts automatically when CXone finishes processing the calling list.\n\nClick Next.\n\nIf you used the first row of your calling list to label the columns, select Use First Row as Column Names next to Header. Review the automatic mapping done by PC, map any unmapped fields, and configure time zone handling and an expiration date.\n\nLearn more about fields in this task\n\nField\n\nDetails\n\nNo time zone found?\n\nThe action CXone takes if it can't use calling list data to map a time zone to the record. CXone checks the record first for a time zone, then a zip code, then a city and state, and finally the area code of the primary phone number.\n\nIf CXone can't match a time zone to the record, it takes the action you specify here:\n\nReject: Removes the record from eligibility for dialing.\n\nSelect time zone: Attaches a default time zone to the record. Use the drop-down to select the default time zone.\n\nIf you live outside of North America, or if you believe the automatic time zone mapping won't work for your calling list, designate the appropriate time zone for each record on your list. See Time Zone for a list of time zone abbreviations and full names.\n\nBatch expiration date\n\nThe default expiration date for all records in this batch. Once the contact expires, PC no longer attempts to reach that contact. You can specify expiration dates for individual records in the calling list by including an expiration date column in the calling list itself and then mapping the column to the Expiration Date field.\n\nThe expiration occurs at the beginning of the date you select (12:00 AM).\n\nIf it's not already done for you, map your phone numbers and email addresses in Map Destinations. Add and remove destinations as needed.\n\nIf you map a phone field to a specific ACD skill, it appears under the cadence options for that skill. If you don't want to include a specific phone number in the Maximum Attempts or cadence calling order, don't map those phone number to fields. Once you map the field, you can't remove it from the cadence settings.\n\nWhen the file uploads, PC displays the progress and the number of records that loaded successfully and unsuccessfully. If the calling list contains invalid records, use the following steps to fix the errors.\n\nClick Download Link in the warning box that appears.\n\nOpen the file to view the problems with the upload.

Note that when you configure allowable dialing and messaging time at a more granular levelâfor a specific record or phone numberâthose settings override the skill setting. To prevent dialing outside dialing curfew, PC doesn't recognize the allowable time range constraints unless you first apply a time zone.\n\nClick the app selector and select ACD.\n\nGo to Contact Settings > ACD Skills.\n\nClick the ACD skill.\n\nClick Parameters.\n\nClick Configure or Edit for Cadence Settings.\n\nIf you haven't already set up a dialing order for the ACD skill, do the following:\n\nClick Add Cadence.\n\nSelect a phone number from the Calling Order drop-down. These correspond with the phone number fields you mapped when you uploaded the calling list for this ACD skill.\n\nSet the value in Attempts to reflect the number of attempts you want the dialer to make on that number before moving on to the next number in the cadence. If you set up preview dialing, PC counts it as an attempt when an agent rejects a record.\n\nIf the phone number is meant for Proactive SMS messaging, select the Final Outcome. If you set it to SMS Retry, you can configure more SMS attempts later in the cadence.\n\nRepeat the previous step until you have the attempts configured the way you want them. Set the values in the Order column to reflect the order in which you want the number types attempted. The lower the number, the sooner the dialer attempts the number.\n\nClick the + time constraints link by the first entry.\n\nOn the Weekdays number bar, click and drag over the period of time when dialing or SMS messaging is allowed on weekdays. You can create multiple allowed time periods, if you want. Repeat the process for the Weekend number bar.\n\nClick save time constraints.\n\nCreate time constraints as needed for other cadence entries.\n\nClick Done.\n\nSet the Allowable Time Range for Dialing or SMS Messaging per Record\n\nRequired permissions: Calling List Create\n\nThese instructions assume that each record in your calling list has a single phone number or that you want the allowable time range to apply to all phone numbers in a record. Setting the allowable dialing or messaging time range here overwrites any allowable time ranges you set for the ACD . Before you start, decide how you want to assign a time zone to each record. You can:\n\nDirectly assign a time zone by including a time zone column in the calling list.\n\nAdd a zip code or other location information that will allow the system to determine a time zone.\n\nSet a default time zone for records without time zones as you upload the list.\n\nIf you haven't already created a calling list, do so now:\n\nCalling list files can't exceed 256 MB in size or 500,000 records. Smaller calling lists result in faster upload and fresher records. Each individual record in a calling list cannot exceed a length of 512 Unicode characters. Calling list uploads support Unicode UTF-8 encoding, which includes Chinese characters and all other languages. If you're creating or editing calling lists in Microsoft Excel, take care to preserve the UTF-8 encoding format.\n\nCXone strips the formatting from phone numbers in calling lists and stores the phone numbers in a universal format. This allows phone numbers to pass between calling lists and do not call (DNC) lists without conflict.\n\nOpen a spreadsheet editor or a text editor.\n\nYou can use the first row to label your columns. This helps with automatic field mapping when you upload the calling list. If you're using a text editor, decide whether to separate the values with commas or tabs.\n\nCreate the columns for your list.\n\nFor a Proactive Voice calling list, you must have a unique identifier column and a phone number column.\n\nFor a Proactive SMS calling list, you must have a unique identifier column and an SMS phone number column.\n\nFor a Proactive Email calling list, you must have at least an external identifier column and an email address column.\n\nLearn more about other system fields you can map to\n\nField\n\nDetails\n\nExternal ID Required.

This setting will be ignored when Deliver Numbers Serially is enabled in the PC skill or when the record is being delivered as a callback. Agent Requests a specific agent to speak with the contact. The value is the agent ID. Override Finalization\n\nA boolean value overriding the system finalization reason. Use it to upload a record that was previously finalized and continue dialing it. If you map this column and set a contact record to False and any previous final outcomes exist for the record on this skill, PC rejects the record.\n\nIf you don't map an Override Finalization column, you can override finalized records by re-uploading them as long as the record was finalized more than two hours ago. If you upload a record that was finalized less than two hours previously, PC rejects the record.\n\nOverriding finalized records can corrupt reporting. If you want to place additional calls as a follow-up to a previous interaction, you should upload the record to a new skill and manage it as a new interaction effort.\n\nCall Request Date/Time\n\nThe date and time when PC begins delivering a scheduled callback to a skill or agent. The field contains both the date, time, and time zone in the following format: MM/DD/YYYY HH:MM:SS [-H:MM|Z].\n\nFor more information, see Upload Timed Call Requests in a Calling List.\n\nCall Request Stale Minutes The number of minutes after the Call Request Date/Time that PC continues to try to deliver a call request before retiring it. After the stale time expires, PC finalizes the record and no longer attempts it. For more information, see Upload Timed Call Requests in a Calling List. Expiration Date The date and time when the contact record expires. PC ceases all attempts to reach the contact after the specified date and time. This is an optional field that overrides the expiration date configured for the skill and the Batch Expiration Date configured for this calling list. For more information, see Set an Individual Record Expiration. Start Time The number of minutes after midnight PC begins dialing the record. For example, if you want PC to begin attempting the record at 8:00 AM in a record's respective time zone, set the value in the calling list to the value of 480.\n\nIf you map this field to a calling list, PC ignores the default start time for any applicable records.\n\nEnd Time The number of minutes after midnight the dialer stops dialing the record. For example, if you want PC to stop attempting the record at 12:00 PM in a record's respective time zone, set the value in the calling list to 720.\n\nIf you map this field to a calling list, PC ignores the default end time for any applicable records.\n\nEnter the data for each record in its own row.\n\nSave the file in one of the approved formats shown in the following images.\n\nXL or XLS.\n\nComma-delimited TXT or CSV\n\nTab-delimited TXT or CSV\n\nAdd a Start Time and an End Time column to your calling list. For each record where you want to restrict dialing time, specify the Start Time and End Time as the number of minutes after midnight when the time range should start and end. For example, if you want calls to the record to begin at 9:00 AM and end at 6:00 PM, the values would be 540 and 1080, respectively.\n\nUpload the calling list.\n\nIf you're re-uploading a calling list after making critical updates, stop the associated ACD skill.

CXone checks the record first for a time zone, then a zip code, then a city and state, and finally the area code of the primary phone number.\n\nIf CXone can't match a time zone to the record, it takes the action you specify here:\n\nReject: Removes the record from eligibility for dialing.\n\nSelect time zone: Attaches a default time zone to the record. Use the drop-down to select the default time zone.\n\nIf you live outside of North America, or if you believe the automatic time zone mapping won't work for your calling list, designate the appropriate time zone for each record on your list. See Time Zone for a list of time zone abbreviations and full names.\n\nBatch expiration date\n\nThe default expiration date for all records in this batch. Once the contact expires, PC no longer attempts to reach that contact. You can specify expiration dates for individual records in the calling list by including an expiration date column in the calling list itself and then mapping the column to the Expiration Date field.\n\nThe expiration occurs at the beginning of the date you select (12:00 AM).\n\nWhen the file uploads, PC displays the progress and the number of records that loaded successfully and unsuccessfully.
