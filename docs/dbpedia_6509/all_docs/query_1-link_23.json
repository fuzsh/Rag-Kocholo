        "text": "Generally, architecture can be termed as a field of art in building, a structure designed by human beings. Therefore, the grandeur and the height of a civilization is measured by the buildings it left behind which include religious buildings. This can be seen through Indian architecture that appeared as a result of the emergence of Buddhism and Hinduism. Between the main objectives of this study is to discuss the concept, goals and philosophy found in the architecture of India. In addition, the study also discusses the characteristics and elements of Indian architecture made up of Buddhist and Hindu architecture that has influenced some of the architecture of other buildings in the world. In this writing, the authors used qualitative methodology focusing on research on the analysis of documents and observations. The finding shows that the concept and philosophy of Indian architecture has been largely influenced by nation and world civilization. The study also identified the characters and elements. system along the western coast of India.\n\nSamranganasutradhara is, superficially, steeped in religion and replete with dogmas and rituals. By analyzing the text in the backdrop of architectural theory leading to practice, the poetry and prose inadvertently displays sophistication and complexity of ancient building processes. Practical application of ancient architectures by experts outside the architectural community-the ubiquitous \"Vastu expert\"-is proliferating regionally and globally and this paper will explore the location of the debate within the realm of architecture. Transcription, documentation, association, analysis, and issues requiring further research have been utilized as processes to analyze the text. The narrator, King Bhoja of the Paramara dynasty who ruled in the Malwa region of Central India around 11th century, was a polymath who wrote on subjects as diverse as philosophy, poetry, medicine, veterinary science and phonetics while excelling at matters of the state. This lends intellectual rigor to the text and distinguishes it from propaganda and scripture. Proximity of Ujjain to Malwa, as a thriving literary urban settlement and medieval central India history and politics, provides a backdrop of a vibrant and evolving environment. From astronomy to geography, metallurgy to sociology, the influence and relevance of extra-disciplinary fields on architecture is demonstrated and elucidated in detail in the first ten chapters. This does not exclude the need for core competency and rigor of discipline but ensures that theory remains linked to real world practices. An analogy may be drawn with John Ruskins' Seven Lamps of Architecture (1849) where philosophical precepts like sacrifice, truth, power and memory among others contribute to creating architecture. On intensive reading, the subjective tenets lead to core practice issues including being true to the intrinsic qualities of materials and structure. Strictly architectural issues are initiated from the tenth chapter onwards and, logically, start from large scale and move towards small scale-earth to city to building to furniture. Anthropometrics remains the consistent binding element as is demonstrated by the unit of the finger. Proclivity of using proportional, not absolute, measurements reveals the advanced understanding of guidelines and regulations as intellectually complex suggestions and not rules and laws, allowing subjective"
