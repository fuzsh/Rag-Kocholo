Europeans looked down on Neanderthals—until they realized they shared their DNA\n\nEuropeans looked down on Neanderthals—until they ...\n\nOnce upon a time, scientists were convinced that Aboriginal Australians were further down the evolutionary ladder from other humans, perhaps closer to Neanderthals. In 2010 it turned out that Europeans are actually likely to have the most drops of Neanderthal blood, metaphorically speaking. In January 2014 an international team of leading archaeologists, geneticists, and anthropologists confirmed that humans outside Africa had bred with Neanderthals. Those of European and Asian ancestry have a very small but tangible presence of this now-extinct human in our lineage, up to around 4 percent of our DNA. People in Asia and Australia also bear traces of another known archaic human, the Denisovans. There is likely to have been breeding with other kinds of human as well. Neanderthals and Denisovans, too, mated with each other. Many in the deep past, it seems, were pretty indiscriminate in their sexual partnerships.\n\nWolpoff has always been sensitive to the controversy he helped to stoke. He faced down plenty of criticism when he and Thorne published their work. “We were the enemy,” he recalls. “If we were right, there couldn’t be a single recent origin for humans. . . . They said, you’re talking about the evolution of human races in separate places independently of each other.”\n\nAnd their theory remains unproven. Academics in the West and in Africa today generally accept that humans became modern in Africa and then adapted to the environments where they happened to move to fairly recently in evolutionary time—these are only superficial adaptations, such as skin color. But not everyone everywhere agrees. In China, there’s a common belief among both the public and leading academics that Chinese ancestry goes back considerably further than the migration out of Africa. One of Wolpoff’s collaborators, Wu Xinzhi, a paleontologist at the Chinese Academy of Sciences, has argued that fossil evidence supports the notion that Homo sapiens evolved separately in China from earlier human species who were living there more than a million years ago, despite data showing that modern Chinese populations carry about as much of a genetic contribution from modern humans who left Africa as other non-African populations do.\n\n“There are many people who are not happy with the idea of African origin,” I’m told by Eleanor Scerri, an archaeologist based at the University of Oxford who researches human origins. “They have co-opted multiregionalism to make a claim that this is a simplistic idea, that races are real, and that people who have come from a particular area have always been there.” She tells me that this thinking appears to be prevalent not only in China but also in Russia. “There is no acceptance that they were ever African.”\n\nAncient DNA and Neanderthals\n\nViking longhouse above Arctic Circle is protective half-buried dwelling\n\nThree hundred kilometers north of the Polar Circle, on the Lofoten Island of Vestvågøya, a farmer discovered the remains of the largest Viking Era longhouse ever uncovered. Archaeologists later uncovered remains of boathouses used by Viking Era chieftans to build the boats that would take them all across Europe to sell their fish.\n\nAbandoned around around 950 AD, today the reconstructed longhouse (the chieftain’s house) measures 83 meters (272 ft) long and 9.5 meters (31 ft) wide. Inside, the Lofotr Viking Museum hosts nightly Viking feasts and demonstrations of tools of the era: the vertical loom, a bowl lathe, a shaving horse for basket weaving and basic tools for natural tanning of leather.\n\nThe boathouses and Viking ships of the era have been reconstructed in accordance of the technology of the time: the iron nails that allowed for the building of “way bigger ships”. This allowed for a more flexible ship that would twist and turn in big waves and allowed for long distance travel (even to the Americas) reaching speeds of 20 knots with good weather using woolen sails and open hulls.\n\nThe Lofoten Islands were rich in marine life and during the winter months they caught abundant amounts of cod which they then dried naturally. Despite being located at he 68th parallel north, the same parallel as central Greenland or northern Alaska, thanks to the Gulf Stream, the climate here is much milder.\n\nWith winter temperatures averaging around 0˚C and a near constant wind, these are ideal conditions for air drying fish without the need to smoke or salt it. This stockfish was then loaded onto ships and sailed to the rest of Europe.\n\n— Lofotr Viking Museum: https://www.lofotr.no/en/lofotr-vikin...\n\nOn *faircompanies: https://faircompanies.com/videos/viki...\n\nThe Scythians were whites.\n\nScythians - Rise and Fall of the Original Horselords DOCUMENTARY\n\nIts a shame that like many of the nomadic cultures they barely wrote about their own histories, its lucky for us that they were close to the Greeks who loved writing things down.\n\nThe Scythian tribe like Sacae & Massagetae that migrated to India have descendants in JAT tribe of Northern India & Pakistan. They still specialize in Agriculture & Animal husbandry and never give up the virtue of warrior as an example they are just 2% of Indian population but have largest number in Indian Army and have their own regiment in Army named after them as JAT Regiment.\n\nThank you for mentioning the archeological evidence of Scythian women's participation in warfare, as I feel it is often overlooked.

Much older than Mesopotamian writing. The Danube culture was an egalitarian civilization which existed 8000 years ago in Eastern Europe (Romania, Bulgaria, Moldavia .....) and is indeed the cradle of civilization, not the Middle East.\n\nStunning Prehistoric European Artifacts Of Car Like Object\n\nSeveral fascinating ancient artifacts offer excellent evidence our ancestors were familiar with the wheel and produced small objects similar to our modern cars\n\n. However, there are also a number of very interesting artifacts showing very curious car-like models. One of them was discovered by curator of the National Museum in Hungary F. Romer. It is a car-like object with a primitive deity depicted on it.\n\nMany car-like ancient objects can also be traced to the Danube Valley civilization, a mysterious European culture, which left a legacy in form of valuable artifacts covered with an unknown, never successfully deciphered script. These artifacts have been excavated from sites in south-east Europe. The culture that flourished from about 6000 BC to 3000 BC, was named Vinca-Tordos Culture of Serbia and western Romania and derived its name from the village of Vinca located on the banks of Danube river, only 14 km downstream from Belgrade. Near the village of Dupljaja in the vicinity of Bela Crkva, Serbia 95 km from Belgrade and 35 km from Vršac, there are remains of a prehistoric settlement originating from the Middle Bronze Age. At this place archaeologists discovered two carts made of terracotta. Sitting inside the carts are bird-shaped humanoids. The artifacts are kept at the National Museum in Belgrade. It is clear that our ancestors were much more advanced than it is commonly believed.\n\nMarch Of The Titans\n\nThe origin of cheese: European prehistoric farmers quickly added cheese to their diet 7,500 years\n\nResearchers on Wednesday said they found the earliest known chemical evidence of cheese-making, based on the analysis of milk-fat residues in pottery dating back about 7,200 years. Not only did cheese provide a key source of nutrition for prehistoric Europeans, it also allowed them a way to store milk long-term.\n\nHow Did Ancient Rome Begin? | Ancient Rome Documentary\n\nThis video is a special Epilogue to Chapter 2 of our series. It covers the origins of Rome, from a small Latin settlement, to the Roman Kingdom under its Seven Legendary Kings. It then goes through the early Roman Republic until the Sack of Rome and its rebirth in the early 300s BCE.\n\nThe Roman Kingdom (also referred to as the Roman monarchy, or the regal period of ancient Rome) was the earliest period of Roman history when the city and its territory were ruled by kings. According to oral accounts, the Roman Kingdom began with the city's founding c. 753 BC, with settlements around the Palatine Hill along the river Tiber in central Italy, and ended with the overthrow of the kings and the establishment of the Republic c. 509 BC.\n\nThe Roman Republic was a state of the classical Roman civilization, run through public representation of the Roman people. Beginning with the overthrow of the Roman Kingdom (traditionally dated to 509 BC) and ending in 27 BC with the establishment of the Roman Empire, Rome's control rapidly expanded during this period—from the city's immediate surroundings to hegemony over the entire Mediterranean world.\n\nRoman society under the Republic was primarily a cultural mix of Latin and Etruscan societies, as well as of Sabine, Oscan, and Greek cultural elements, which is especially visible in the Roman Pantheon. Its political organization developed, at around the same time as direct democracy in Ancient Greece, with collective and annual magistracies, overseen by a senate The top magistrates were the two consuls, who had an extensive range of executive, legislative, judicial, military, and religious powers. Even though a small number of powerful families (called gentes) monopolised the main magistracies, the Roman Republic is generally considered one of the earliest examples of representative democracy. Roman institutions underwent considerable changes throughout the Republic to adapt to the difficulties it faced, such as the creation of promagistracies to rule its conquered provinces, or the composition of the senate.\n\nUnlike the Pax Romana of the Roman Empire, the Republic was in a state of quasi-perpetual war throughout its existence. Its first enemies were its Latin and Etruscan neighbours as well as the Gauls, who even sacked the city in 387 BC. The Republic nonetheless demonstrated extreme resilience and always managed to overcome its losses, however catastrophic.\n\nLittle is certain about the kingdom's history as no records and few inscriptions from the time of the kings survive. The accounts of this period written during the Republic and the Empire are thought largely to be based on oral tradition.\n\nHow was Rome founded? - History of the Roman Empire - Part 1\n\n\"The story of the founding of Rome it’s a tale that was often told by the Romans as the earliest history of their ancient city. As the legend goes… Rome was founded on April 21, 753 BC by twin brothers, Romulus and Remus. According to tradition, the boys were the sons of Rhea Silvia, a daughter of King Numitor of Alba Longa, who was impregnated by the god of war, Mars…\"\n\nA Neanderthal Odyssey: Everything We Know about the Neanderthals\n\nWhite people (White Europeans) during the Ice Age in Europe.\n\nEuropeans (Whites) were not black in the past. In spite of all this cheddar man crap, ancient European (Whites) people would look much like today. DNA shows ancient Egyptians are about the same as today. Same with a lot of people in the British Isles and Europe.\n\nEdited\n\nAll content in this website is the copyright material. Visitors are welcome to share any articles, but we ask that you acknowledge us as the source.\n\nThe following information is to give evidence that the White European Caucasians (White People) who live in the British Isles across to Russia today including the rest of Europe are indigenous to those regions and they have been there for thousands of years.\n\nIt is important to note that some White Jews may view themselves differently than whites. However, for centuries, Jews considered themselves to be white, which is equivalent to being European. In light of the historical persecution faced by both Jews and whites, it is crucial to avoid division and recognize that White Jews and whites share a common ancestry and European heritage.\n\nThis article aims to remind White Jews that Israel is their religious homeland and Europe is their racial homeland, and that they are indigenous to Europe along with other whites, forming a brotherhood and sisterhood. It is crucial to acknowledge the rich history of White Jews, including their Ice Age ancestry, before their conversion to Judaism.\n\nOur ancient European Caucasian ancestors(white & white Jews ) were transient beings who migrated cross the lands that make up Europe and the British Isles and they are viewed by historians and the scientific community as one people. It matters not what your religion or passport says; Christianity, Judaism, Scandinavia, Russia, France – none of these religions or nationalities existed in the original settlements of human beings in Europe.\n\nWhite people (White Europeans) who live in the United States, Canada, South America, Israel, Australia, and South Africa are indigenous to Europe and should have the right of return to live in their ancient homeland.\n\nThe Inventions of the Jewish People.\n\nIsraeli Professor Shlomo Sand is challenging notions of a Jewish people quoted in his new book, \"those who claim to be all of the Jewish people cannot claim a blood connection with the original Jewish inhabitants of the holy land, but converts along the way.\"\n\nRelated Video:\n\nShlomo Sand - The invention of the Jewish People\n\nIsraelis: Was your family here before 1948?\n\nArab Israelis: Where do you come from?\n\nJewish language\n\n\"The modern Hebrew language being a European hybrid......also is known to have copied Arabic words and Arabic roots to make up new \"Hebrew\" neologisms and calques.\"\n\nThere is scholarly view that goes beyond what even the famous linguist Ghil'ad Zuckerman States that:\n\n\"modern Hebrew\" is simply a form of Yiddish (Yiddish be an Indo-European Language) with some new made-up \"Hebrew\" neologism (often from Arabic) sprinkled in.\"\n\nThe majority of Jews did not come from Israel. They are European Caucasians with the majority from Europe, and some came from the Middle East or the Khazar tribes in Khazaria area in Southern Russia. Many Jews have blue eyes and blonde hair, who's origins originated in Europe.\n\nIt is estimated that the majority of Jews in western countries are actually white Europeans and many have blue eyes, blonde hair and European facial features which only originated from cold climates. Regardless of this most Jews are indoctrinated from birth into believing that they are a distinct race separate from their European brothers and sisters. It is a belief that was started by the Globalist and anti-Semitic Zionists, ie. that they are different to all others and while there is a classical \"Jewish\" look held by some Jews due to the strong breeding within only Jewish families, most people of Jewish descent look no different to Europeans. The Japanese are the same race as Chinese and were indoctrinated from birth and during the Second World War, that they were different from the Chinese. This attitude resulted in the systemic killing and eradication of many innocent Chinese civilians and we need to ensure that this attitude of difference is stopped as it is now in the process of destroying Europe and the Europeans.\n\nMany white Europeans have been converted to the Jewish faith over the centuries and it is worth remembering that during the time of the ice age there were no Jews anywhere on earth. The Jewish belief and faith has simply been invented over the centuries and used as a kind of class warfare against other groups to gain money and power by a small group.\n\nClearly these Israelis from European backgrounds are not Semites. It's written all over their faces.\n\nWhere are Ashkenazi Jews from? Their Origins May Surprise You\n\n\"It appears that the majority of the European converts to Judaism during the early years of the Diaspora were women. That helps explain why the Ashkenazim can trace their female lineage to southern and western Europe.\"\n\nDNA Tests Cannot Be Trusted\n\nThe Mystery of European Hair, Eye, and Skin Color\n\nWhite European and West Eurasians Videos\n\nWoolly Mammoth || Can We See Them Roaming On This Earth Again ?\n\nWhat Race are you?\n\nWhite European Racial Pride.

The Lascaux complex contains some of the most remarkable Palaeolithic cave paintings in the world. One of our organization's goals is to unite European Caucasians worldwide by teaching them about our ancestors before the advent of today's major religions – Judaism, Islam, and Christianity.\n\nToday, White people are scattered all over the world and many no longer identify themselves with their homeland Europe, which must change. We must begin to truly think of the nations of Europe as sacred ground; it is the land and the blood of our ancestors going back thousands of years, many of whom fought to keep it safe for us, their descendants. We need to do our part now in order to pass it on, intact to our future generations.\n\nWhite people should be proud of their ancestors who have done many wondrous things including those who painted in caves and on cliffs in Europe.\n\nThe photo of the skull (pictured left) was taken at the British Museum, London, and is the oldest of human fossils found outside Africa from Georgia in Southern Russia, Eastern Europe as being 1.8 million years old. People have been living in the regions we call Europe and the Middle East along with Central Asia for longer than many people realize.\n\nIf you walked behind the owner of this skull when he was alive and he was dressed in a modern outfit, you would think that he was just another human being until you looked at his face. Then you would notice that he was slightly different, based on the brow ridge and facial features.\n\nIt is worth remembering that the average height of Homo erectus was 6 ft., they did not walk like monkeys. They walked around like human beings do today. Homo erectus based on recent research lived between 1.8 million years – 100,000 years ago.\n\nEuropean researchers claim earliest humans evolved in Europe\n\nEuropean researchers stand by their study that the earliest humans evolved in Europe and not in Africa. But local scientists dispute the claims saying no reliable evidence has been provided to support that view.\n\nThe Petralona Human Skull That Challenges the 'Out of Africa' Theory\n\nThe skull (pictured right), discovered in Northern Greece has the potential to change what we know\n\nabout human evolution. This skull, known as the Petralona Skull was found in 1959 embedded in a wall and was given to the University of Thessaloniki from the Petralona community with the conditions that after examination it would be put on public display by the museum with information about the skull that was discovered.\n\nThe ‘Petralona man’, as it has since been called, was found to be 700,000 years old, making it the oldest human Europeoid (presenting European traits), of that age ever discovered in Europe. The academic responsible for researching the cave and skull, Dr. Poulianos, argues that this hominid evolved separately in Europe and was not an ancestor of a species that came out of Africa.\n\nIndependent researchers tried to dismiss these findings, arguing that the skull was only 50,000 years old and was indeed an ancestor that came from Africa. Then only a decade later in 1971, research from the US was published backing up the findings that the skull was indeed 700,000 years old. This case was made on the analysis of the cave’s stratigraphy and the sediment in which the skull was embedded. Further research in the cave discovered isolated teeth and two pre-human skeletons dating back 800,000 years, as well as other fossils of various species.\n\nToday, most academics who have analyzed the Petralona remains say that the cranium belongs to an archaic hominid distinguished from Homo erectus, and from both the classic Neanderthals and anatomically modern humans, but showing characteristics of all those species and presenting strong European traits. A skull dating back 700,000 years ago which is either Homo sapien or part Homo sapien is in direct conflict with the 'Out of Africa' theory of human evolution. Dr. Poulianos’ findings contradicted conventional views regarding human evolution, as a result his research was suppressed. He and his team have been denied further access to the cave to complete their research and study, and the whereabouts of the skull is now unknown.\n\nPetralona cave\n\nIt is interesting to note that there has been completely separate research completed and published in the last 5 years which also shows evidence that Homo erectus was found in Eurasia as far back as 1.8 million years ago. The discovery of the Dmanisi Skull 5 (pictured left) has certainly caused a lot of discussion in the paleontological world with new theories being that Homo erectus possibly evolved in Eurasia, and then migrated into Africa considering the dates.\n\nNew discovery suggests Homo erectus originated from Asia\n\n\"How \"African\" was the early human dispersal out of Africa?\"\n\nSkull discovery sheds light on human species\n\nBacteria found in Otzi the iceman could turn the Out of Africa theory on ...

Today, we can see the remains of the cold stages through fossilised tree trunks, submerged in today's seawater but visible at extremely low tides. During the lower sea levels animals and man could walk freely towards Europe. Amazing remains of Ice Age beasts were unearthed from Kents Cavern during the Victorian period.\n\nWARM STAGES\n\nAs the planet's temperature rose, the ice sheets melted and the sea levels began to rise once again, closing off the established links to Europe. Plant life would flourish and warm weather animals began to appear, in Joint Mitnor Cave just 20 miles from Kents Cavern. Remains of straight tusked elephants, bison and even hippopotamus were found.\n\nEND\n\nHippos & mammoths in Worcestershire?\n\nThe Ice Age was not always cold: hippos once wallowed in Worcestershire’s warm pools. Over the last 2.5 million years – a period we call ‘The Ice Age’ and known geologically as the Quaternary – the climate fluctuated between icy glacials and warmer interglacials. As temperatures rose species were able to expand into new areas, before being pushed back further south as the climate turned icy.\n\nDuring warm interglacials, herds of horses, bison and aurochs would have roamed the open grasslands of Britain. Beavers and dolphins swam in our rivers; at the height of the Hoxnian Interglacial (around 400,000 years ago) oak forests were home to deer and macaque monkeys. The gentler climate meant that early humans gradually returned to Britain and the stone tools that they left behind have been found at places like Swanscombe in Kent and Boxgrove in West Sussex.\n\nLions, bears, wolves and these early humans would have hunted large animals like rhinoceros and the straight tusked elephant. Straight tusked elephants are now extinct but they were once the largest Ice Age animal of all, twice as large as elephants today and even bigger than a mammoth. They could grow to four metres in height and ten tonnes in weight and their straight tusks could grow to over three metres in length.\n\nAround 130,000 – 115,000 years ago, a particularly warm interglacial allowed tropical species to live in Britain. Hippopotamus bones have been found in Worcestershire at Eckington, Bengeworth and Stourbridge. Spotted hyenas, lions and narrow-nosed rhinoceros are also known to have lived in Britain during this time.\n\nEND\n\n\"Researchers estimate the prints are between 800,000 and 1 million years old\".\n\nOldest Human Footprints Outside of Africa Found\n\nHomo erectus\n\nHomo erectus, our ancient ancestor\n\nHomo erectus\n\nFrom Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia\n\nConstruction\n\nIn 1962, a 366 cm × 427 cm × 30 cm (12 ft × 14 ft × 1 ft) circle made with volcanic rocks was discovered in Olduvai Gorge. At 61–76 cm (2–2.5 ft) intervals, rocks were piled up to 15–23 cm (6–9 in) high. British palaeoanthropologist Mary Leakey suggested the rock piles were used to support poles stuck into the ground, possibly to support a windbreak or a rough hut. Some modern day nomadic tribes build similar low-lying rock walls to build temporary shelters upon, bending upright branches as poles and using grasses or animal hide as a screen.[99] Dating to 1.75 Mya, it is the oldest claimed evidence of architecture.[100]\n\nIn Europe, evidence of constructed dwelling structures dating to or following the Holstein Interglacial (which began 424 kya) has been claimed in Bilzingsleben, Germany; Terra Amata, France; and Fermanville and Saint-Germain-des-Vaux in Normandy. The oldest evidence of a dwelling (and a campfire) in Europe comes from Přezletice, Czech Republic, 700 kya during the Cromerian Interglacial. This dwelling's base measured about 3 m × 4 m (9.8 ft × 13.1 ft) on the exterior and 3 m × 2 m (9.8 ft × 6.6 ft) on the interior, and is considered to have been a firm surface hut, probably with a vaulted roof made of thick branches or thin poles, supported by a foundation of big rocks and earth, and likely functioned as a winter base camp.[101]\n\nSwanscombe Woman\n\nSwanscombe Heritage Park\n\nThe area was already known for the finds of numerous Palaeolithic-era handaxes—mostly Acheulean and Clactonian artifacts, some as much as 400,000 years old—when in 1935/1936 work at Barnfield Pit uncovered two fossilised skull fragments. These fragments came to be known as the remains of Swanscombe Man but were later found to have belonged to a young woman.[7] The Swanscombe skull has been identified as early Neanderthal[8] or pre-Neanderthal,[9] dating to the Hoxnian Interglacial around 400,000 years ago.[6]\n\nIt is actually believed some parts of the skull belonging to the face may still be missing.\n\nThe 400,000 year old Swanscombe skull and the Ebbsfleet Elephant at the heart of Kent's prehistoric metropolis\n\nThey say if you don't know where you've come from, you don't know where you're going.\n\nThankfully for the residents of Swanscombe and Kent they don't have far to travel to piece together a vital piece of early human history.\n\nIt's hard to imagine now but homes along the Thames Estuary were once on land which hyenas, cave lions and huge mammoth-sized elephants freely roamed.\n\nThey were joined by perhaps the town's oldest resident – a 400,000 year old ancestor to the Neanderthal species – known as the Swanscombe woman.\n\nSwanscombe is one of only two sites in Britain where actual human remains of this very early period have been found.\n\nBetween 1997 and 2004 a series of archaeological excavations were carried out in the Ebbsfleet Valley in advance of High Speed 1's passage into Kent .\n\nThey were led by Dr Francis Wenban-Smith, a research professor of archaeology at the University of Southampton, working in partnership with Oxford Archaeology who commissioned the dig, near the Swanscombe Skull site.\n\nTogether they safely removed a 400,000-year-old elephant tusk from a building site near Swan Valley Community School on Southfleet Road, now Ebbsfleet Academy.\n\nThe mammoth find was one-and-a-half metres long and belonged to an extinct species of straight tusked elephants, capable of resting their chins on the back of their African Savannah equivalents today.\n\nThe Ebbsfleet elephant\n\nPeople Killed Elephant.\n\nThe marshy valley teems with life. Herds of deer, aurochs, and a troop of macaque monkeys jostle for space as they wait their turn to drink from a sluggish, spring-fed stream. On the far bank a rhinoceros laps steadily at the water, its horned head obscured by thick reed-beds carpeting the valley floor in verdant green. Encroaching forest has been trampled down by heavy hooves to form a clearing, while nearby vegetation has been stripped almost bare by voracious grazing. On a low chalk cliff overlooking the valley, a huge male lion lazes watchfully near the carcass of a day-old kill. And towering over everything is a majestic, solitary bull elephant, ambling down the valley side towards the water’s edge.\n\nWithout warning, a pack of strongly built men burst from their hiding place in the undergrowth. Brandishing sturdy wooden spears and uttering harsh hunting cries, they close in on the startled elephant. It is a well-practised ambush. The men have been hiding patiently for many hours at a favoured hunting site. They approach cautiously at first, snapping like wolves at the elephant’s flanks, wary of tusks that slice through the air like scythes. Some of the group fling their spears at close range, while the more experienced hunters aim for the elephant’s eyes in the hope of blinding the enraged animal.\n\nMore than twice the height of a man, the lumbering beast cannot turn quickly enough to protect itself from every direction. The hunters dart close to fling their spears with terrific force, before leaping clear, and the elephant gradually weakens, succumbing to the deadly hail of spears. As the mighty beast collapses onto a patch of sun-baked clay beside the mire, its blood is oozing from numerous puncture wounds. The hunters close in for the kill.\n\nAs their initial excitement subsides, one of the men searches the ground for suitable flint nodules, which are plentiful along the stream bank. Using another flint as a hammerstone, the hunter squats beside the elephant and, with a few deft strikes, splits the nodule into a handful of razor-sharp blades and scrapers. Before long the whole group, brandishing similar tools, is butchering the carcass, expertly stripping away the most prized cuts. Several of the hunters slice at the fatty foot-pads, another smashes the skull open with a rock to scoop out the brain. Working together, two others lever the jaw off with a branch and start cutting at the elephant’s tongue. When they are done, only the hide, bones, and tusks are left to mark where the beast fell. The death of this elephant means life for their tribe. Almost everything they need to survive can be won from its bloody carcass.\n\nAstonishing recent finds include eight complete wooden spears from a 300,000-year-old wild-horse hunting camp at SchÃ¶ningen in Germany. These well-preserved wooden artefacts exhibit a high level of craftsmanship. At Lehringen, another German site, a spear was found apparently embedded in a straight-tusked elephant’s ribcage. The Southfleet Road evidence is less explicit, but a wooden spearpoint has been found in the Thames Estuary at Clacton-on-Sea, indicating that early hominins with comparable capabilities were active in southern Britain around 400,000 years ago.\n\nHow Doggerland Sank Beneath The Waves (500,000-4000 BC) // Prehistoric Europe Documentary\n\nHomo Heidelbergensis\n\nDie Sandgrube Grafenrain - Fundort des Homo heidelbergensis\n\nHomo heidelbergensis Homo Heidelbergensis\n\n3D interactive model of (Homo heidelbergensis) skull cast\n\nSpecies Shorts: Homo heidelbergensis\n\nSchöningen spears\n\nThe Schöningen spears are a set of ten wooden weapons from the Palaeolithic Age that were excavated between 1994 and 1999 from the 'Spear Horizon' in the open-cast lignite mine in Schöningen, Helmstedt district, Germany. They were found together with animal bones and stone and bone tools.[1][2][3][4] The excavations took place under the management of Hartmut Thieme of the Lower Saxony State Service for Cultural Heritage (NLD).\n\nShaft section\n\nDescription and function\n\nMost of the spears were made using trunks of slow-growing spruce trees, except for spear IV, which is made from pine. The complete spears vary in length from 1.84 to 2.53 m (6.04 to 8.30 ft), with diameters ranging from 29 to 47 mm (1.14 to 1.85 in).[26] The wooden finds were exposed to sedimentary pressure, and there are varying degrees of deformation.\n\nThe spears were debarked and have evidence of working traces at both ends, demonstrating that they were shaped to be double pointed.[27] One exception is Spear VI, which does not appear to taper at the back. The points of the spears made use of the bases of trees, which is harder wood, while the soft inner pith is offset from the tip.[28] These features suggest an awareness of the properties of wood, and the design in such a way as to maximise the hardness of wood.\n\nLike today’s tournament javelins, the greatest diameter and therefore likely the centre of gravity is located in the front third of the shaft of at least some of the spears.[29] In addition, most of the spears, with the exception of Spear VI, taper at both the front and the back, which may assist flight aerodynamics. This led many to suggest that they may have been designed as thrown spears, similar to a modern javelin.\n\nExperimental research using experienced athletes to throw replicas of Spear II show that the spears are capable of being thrown at distances of at leat 15–20 m, and are similar in weight and balance to javelins.[30][31][32] However, Spear VI, which does not taper at the back and also has a natural kink, is interpreted as a thrusting spear,[33] and replicas of Spear II have also been experimentally tested as thrusting spears.[34] Ethnographically, wooden spears were used as both thrusting and throwing spears.[35] Together the evidence suggests that the Schöningen spears most likely had multiple uses including for self-defence against dangerous predators such as saber-toothed cats, with whom the humans shared the landscape.[36]\n\nOther discoveries\n\nIn addition to the spears and double-pointed sticks, a charred wooden stick made of spruce and measuring 87.7 by 3.6 cm was also found at Schöningen 13 II-4, and is interpreted as a possible skewer.[37] Hundreds of additional wooden fragments from the site are the subject of ongoing research by a multidisciplinary team.\n\nAlso among the finds are the so-called 'clamp shafts', excavated from locality Schöningen 12b, a site that formed earlier than Schöningen 13 II-4. These tools were made from the extremely hard wooden branch-bases of the European silver fir. They are noticeably worked and may have been used as handles for stone tools.[38]\n\nAs of 2015, around 1500 stone tools and over 12,000 animal bones were found.[39] The stone tools comprise denticulates, some bifacially worked tools, retouched flakes and scrapers, but there are no handaxes or handaxe thinning flakes.[40] As such the stone tools are interpreted as late Lower Palaeolithic in nature. The majority of animal bones with signs of butchery belong to an extinct species of horse (Equus mosbachensis). Also present are red deer and large bovids.[41][42] Marks on the bones suggest that the humans had first access to the carcasses, and that carnivores such as wolves and sabre-tooth cats accessed the bones later. Marks from stone tools suggest that humans worked together to butcher their prey.[43] Bone tools have also been discovered in the 'Spear Horizon', and are suggested to have been used for knapping flint and for breaking open other bones for marrow.[44]\n\nThanks to excellent preservation conditions, there are many finds of small animals, among them small mammals, fish, mollusks and insects. Together with the carpological remains, they enable a detailed reconstruction of the climate and the environment, and show that the site of 13 II formed towards the end of the interglacial.[45]\n\nThe Neanderthals in Europe and the Middle East\n\nNeanderthals - White people in 400,000 - 24,000 BC - Wardruna - Gibu\n\nWho were the Neanderthals? | DW Documentary\n\nLong before Homo sapiens populated the earth, the Neanderthals lived in Eurasia.\n\nNow, paleoanthropologists in England and France are using new archeological methods to shed light on some previously unexplained Neanderthal mysteries.\n\nIn an age clouded by the mists of time, the first early humans colonized the Eurasian continent. They settled on land that had only recently been covered by glaciers. This species, called Neanderthals, died out about 30,000 years ago -- but at one time, they formed the largest group in an area that stretched from northern France to the Belgian coast and from the Channel Islands to southern England.\n\nDuring the last Ice Age, the North Sea was frozen over -- and the English Channel was a small river that could easily be crossed on foot. The Neanderthals lived in close harmony with their perpetually changing environment. They had everything they needed to survive: the meat of prey animals, edible wild plants, water and wood for cooking and heating. How did these early humans develop over almost 300,000 years? What were their lives like before they became extinct?\n\nOur documentary is based on the latest research. We investigate various populations of Neanderthals, and visit archaeological sites in northern France, southern England, and on the island of Jersey.\n\nRenowned researchers such as the British paleoanthropologist Chris Stringer and his French colleague Ludovic Slimak describe how the Neanderthals lived, and discuss their cognitive abilities. Was this species capable of structured thinking? Did they have cultures, languages, and societies? How intelligent were they, and what sort of adaptive strategies kept them alive for 300,000 years? How similar were they to modern-day humans?\n\nMap of remains of Neanderthals.\n\nScience & Environment\n\nHow scientists recreated Neanderthal man\n\nA team of scientists has created what it believes is the first really accurate reconstruction of Neanderthal man, from a skeleton that was discovered in France over a century ago.\n\nIn 1909, excavations at La Ferrassie cave in the Dordogne unearthed the remains of a group of Neanderthals. One of the skeletons in that group was that of an adult male, given the name La Ferrassie 1.\n\nThese remains have helped scientists create a detailed reconstruction of our closest prehistoric relative for a new BBC series, Prehistoric Autopsy.\n\nHow Scientists Recreated Neanderthal Man\n\nAncient genomes 2: Neandertals within us\n\nNeanderthal Gene Cluster More Common in Europeans\n\nReconstructed Face Of Neanderthal Woman\n\nEuropeans Have Three times More Neanderthal Genes for Lipid Catabolism than Asians or Africans\n\nScience Daily, April 2, 2014\n\nContemporary Europeans have as many as three times more Neanderthal variants in genes involved in lipid catabolism than Asians and Africans.\n\nAlthough Neanderthals are extinct, fragments of their genomes persist in modern humans. These shared regions are unevenly distributed across the genome and some regions are particularly enriched with Neanderthal variants. An international team of researchers led by Philipp Khaitovich of the Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology in Leipzig, Germany, and the CAS-MPG Partner Institute for Computational Biology in Shanghai, China, show that DNA sequences shared between modern humans and Neanderthals are specifically enriched in genes involved in the metabolic breakdown of lipids. This sharing of genes is seen mainly in contemporary humans of European descent and may have given a selective advantage to the individuals with the Neanderthal variants.\n\nThe researchers analyzed the distribution of Neanderthal variants in the genomes of eleven contemporary human populations of African, Asian and European descent. They found that genes involved in the lipid synthesis contained a particularly high number of Neanderthal variants in contemporary humans of European origin, but not in Asians and Africans.\n\nNeanderthal, 'The lost face of Humanity'!\n\nWhite Neanderthal group picture taken from above video\n\nNeanderthal family.\n\nAncient Music - Cavemen\n\n175,000 year old evidence that the first inhabitants of Europe were highly underestimated.

DNA taken from two female Neanderthals showed they had brown eyes but also carried genes for blue eyes:\n\nWere Some Neandertals Brown-Eyed Girls?\n\n\"The new study, to be published in the American Journal of Human Biology later this spring, looks at the genomes of three female Neandertals from Croatia. Their DNA was the basis of the first effort to compile a complete Neandertal genetic sequence, which was published in 2010.\n\nThe researchers focused their attention on 40 well-studied stretches of genetic material that help determine pigmentation in living people. A particular form of the gene known as TPCN2, for example, bestows brown hair in modern humans; any other form means hair that's another color.\n\nOne complication is that traits such as hair color are controlled by multiple genes. To determine the cumulative impact of multiple genes on one trait, the authors assumed they could simply add together the impact of individual genes. The female Neandertal known as Vi33.26, for example, had seven genes for brown eyes, one for \"not-brown\" eyes, three for blue eyes, and four for \"not-blue eyes.\" By the researchers' reckoning, that means a six-gene balance in favor of brown and a negative balance for blue, so Vi33.26's eyes were probably brown. According to this method, all three Neandertals had a dark complexion and brown eyes, and although one was red-haired, two sported brown locks.\n\nStudy author Tábita Hünemeier of Brazil's Universidade Federal do Rio Grande do Sul says she's not surprised by the results. \"There was a large population of Neandertals in Europe,\" she says. \"It's impossible that an entire population has red hair or blue eyes.\"\n\n\"Other archaeological evidence unearthed at Neanderthal sites provides reason to believe that Neanderthals did in fact have a diverse diet. Microfossils found in Neanderthal teeth and food remains left behind at cooking sites indicate that they may have eaten wild peas, acorns, pistachios, grass seeds, wild olives, pine nuts and date palms depending on what was locally available.\"\n\nI am clearly descendant of Neanderthal. Don't know how far back and what other ancestors were but I have a triangular face, stocky built, bump in the back of my head and I can tolerate cold climate. On top of that the outline of the hand left by Neanderthal matches my hand. In short, I am a white European descended from people that lived there for hundreds of thousands years.\n\nNeanderthals vs Cro-Magnon (Modern European Caucasians )\n\nThe Neanderthals first appeared in Europe about 700,000 years ago and died out some 28,000 years ago. Some DNA testing on Neanderthal bones has revealed they were light-skinned as European Caucasians are today and some had red hair. They had a brow ridge and were shorter than the Ice Age Europeans. The Neanderthal skull image (below), displays the brow ridge. The drawing of the Neanderthal man (pictured right), demonstrates their features are not too dissimilar to Europeans today.\n\nThe globalist promote that the first Ice Age White European Caucasians are believed to have moved into Europe approximately 40,000 years ago. The question is; where did the Caucasoids people from Europe and the Middle East come from? Their skeletons have not been found in Africa so it is believed by many, the Caucasoids originated somewhere in the Caucasus region of Southern Russia and developed from Neanderthals.\n\nThe skeletons of Europeans and many people who live in the Middle East are the same and some people in the Middle East have European features and some have the Middle Eastern looks, and both groups are called Caucasoids. These Caucasoids migrated into Europe and the Middle East who replaced the Neanderthals.\n\nWhen Modern Caucasoids migrated into the Middle East and Europe certain changes occurred within both these groups. Those who moved into Europe had brown eyes and over time many developed blonde hair and blue or green eyes, while many of those who went into the Middle East have predominantly kept their darker hair and brown eyes.\n\nWhen discussing why Neanderthals became extinct and Modern Caucasoids survived, it has been estimated there has been no more than 50,000 Neanderthals living in Europe and one predominant theory was that physical conflicts resulted in the demise of Neanderthals. They had a lower birth rate and could not compete against European Caucasians therefore, over time they disappeared. Article in Nature recently published research on archaeological cave settlements which were found in Western Galilee, Israel, demonstrating both groups of modern humans and Neanderthals lived at the same time just a short distance from each other with peaceful interaction being demonstrated.\n\nScientists in Western Galilee, Israel, unearthed skull remains of both modern man and Neanderthals who lived in the same area about 55,000 years ago. New theories have shown the Neanderthals were not as resourceful as mankind today.\n\nThe map on the right shows Europe during the Ice age approximately 10,000 years ago showing a very different world than to what it is today.\n\nDuring the Ice Age in Europe, Eurasia and the Middle East there was no Christianity; no Islam; no Jewish religion; no Talmud; no Hindu religion. Over a period of time religions have been created by man who adapted their ancient family custom beliefs and has taken over and claimed by the modern religions of today. Many people today have become religious fanatics resulting in millions of people being killed causing much suffering. We the People should learn our family history, customs and beliefs which were practiced before modern religion took over.\n\nDuring the Ice Age, Europeans lived in small family groups often wandering over large areas they controlled and expanding their numbers from small groups into tribal groups leading into nations.\n\nGenographic Project/Neanderthals\n\nFor Neanderthals to kill their prey, they had to be very close to an animal to spear it and many were injured due to their hunting methods. For example; some Neanderthal skeletons revealed broken bones which had healed. The average Neanderthal probably lived no more than 30 years. Around the end of the Ice Age, there was great fluctuation in the climate with periods of heavy snow and warming. During this time many animals became extinct.\n\nDuring this period, some inland Neanderthals appeared to have starved with evidence showing that they practiced cannibalism to survive. Remember that historically, people have resorted to cannibalism in extreme cases such as plane crashes. Neanderthals living along coastal areas survived without the same hardships due to fishing. This is particularly the case with the Neanderthals who lived around the Rock of Gibraltar, Southern Spain, where there are many caves. Some of these caves today are filled with water, however, during the Neanderthal period, the ocean was about 300 feet lower than it is today. The Neanderthals who lived there survived by eating seafood and did not practice cannibalism. DNA testing today shows that Neanderthal men bred with women from other Neanderthal groups, but due to the fact that their population was reduced in inland areas, subsequently the shortage of women led to inbreeding amongst themselves. Neanderthals lived in small groups and due to their harsh lifestyle, very few Neanderthal children reached adulthood with all these factors leading to their gradual decline.\n\nThe Real Neanderthal Man 1-of-5\n\nDiscovery Channel Neanderthal Part-7-10\n\nDecoding Neanderthals\n\nNeanderthal Caves\n\n\"La Cotte de St Brelade is a Paleolithic site of early habitation in Saint Brélade, Jersey.

The cave is also known as Lé Creux ès Fées (The Fairies' Cave).[1][2]\n\nNeanderthals lived there at various times between around 250,000 years ago and after 48,000 years ago—making it the earliest known occupation of the Channel Islands by a hominin species, and also possibly one of the last Neanderthal sites in northwestern Europe. It is the only site in the British Isles to have produced late Neanderthal fossils.[3][4]\n\nAt that time, with sea levels slightly below those at present, Jersey was part of Normandy, a peninsula jutting out from the coast, and La Cotte would have been a prominent landmark on the dry plain that linked Jersey to the French mainland.

The Levallois technique requires a high level of skill and cognition to plan several steps ahead during the flintknapping process (Schlanger 1996) as the shape and preparation of the core determines the shape of the flakes that are removed.

One had a face, but was badly distorted; the other was just the left half of a braincase. {snip}\n\n{snip}\n\nThe one with the face, known as Apidima 2, is a 170,000-year-old Neanderthal—no surprises there. But the other, Apidima 1, was one of us—a 210,000-year-old modern human. And if the team is right about that, the partial skull is the oldest specimen of Homo sapiens outside Africa, handily beating the previous record holder, a jawbone from Israel’s Misliya Cave that’s about 180,000 years old. “I couldn’t believe it at first,” Harvati says, “but all the analyses we conducted gave the same result.”\n\nUntil now, most researchers have focused on the more complete (but less interesting) of the two skulls. “Apidima 1 has just been ignored,” says Harvati. But its antiquity matters for three reasons. First, it pushes back the known presence of modern humans outside Africa by some 30,000 years. Second, it’s considerably older than all other Homo sapiens fossils from Europe, all of which are 40,000 years old or younger. Third, it’s older than the Neanderthal skull next to it.\n\nCollectively, these traits mess up the standard story of Neanderthal and modern-human evolution. According to that narrative, Neanderthals slowly evolved in Europe, largely isolated from other kinds of hominins. When modern humans expanded out of Africa, their movements into Europe might have been stalled by the presence of the already successful Neanderthals. That explains why Homo sapiens stuck to a more southerly route into Asia, and why they left no European fossils until about 40,000 years ago. “The idea of Europe as ‘fortress Neanderthal’ has been gaining ground,” says Rebecca Wragg Sykes, an archaeologist from the University of Bordeaux, but identifying a 210,000-year-old Homo sapiens skull from Europe “really undermines that.”\n\n“It suggests that early Homo sapiens groups got farther than we may have previously thought, occasionally occupying territories that later became that of Neanderthals,” adds Shara Bailey, an anthropologist at NYU. {snip}\n\nThe identity of Apidima 1 could also cast doubt on other archaeological finds from Europe, such as stone tools with no accompanying fossils. Researchers had long assumed that within a certain time window, “any archaeology was all the work of Neanderthals,” says Wragg Sykes. But if modern humans also occupied this “safe range,” which species actually created those artifacts?\n\n{snip}\n\nHow much information can scientists really glean from just the back of the skull, and just the left half at that? Actually, quite a lot, Harvati says: That region is very informative when telling different hominins apart. Apidima 1 lacks several traits that are distinctively Neanderthal, while its rounded shape “is considered to be a uniquely modern human feature that evolved relatively late,” Harvati says.\n\nBut “it doesn’t look like classic Homo sapiens,” says Wragg Sykes, who wonders whether it represents a group of humans that had been interbreeding with Neanderthals or other ancient hominins. “Obviously everyone is going to want to see DNA out of that skull,” she adds.\n\n{snip}\n\nThe Apidima skulls also suggest that the accepted story of Europe, in which modern humans eventually replaced the long-dominant Neanderthals, is too simple. Instead, Harvati thinks that modern humans were already in Greece about 200,000 years ago; they were then replaced by Neanderthals, who were themselves replaced by humans about 40,000 years ago. A similar cycle of competition, where Neanderthals and humans repeatedly replaced each other, seems to have happened in the Levant, the Middle Eastern region that includes Israel and Syria. {snip}\n\n{snip}\n\nGreece is a good place to start. “It’s at the crossroads of three major continents, and it’s a refuge where animals and humans could survive at the height of the ice ages,” Harvati says. “You’d predict population dispersals and range contractions in these areas, the possibility for contact [between different groups], and a more diverse human-fossil record than you’d find in distant parts of Europe. There aren’t many fossils in the region, but it hasn’t been much of a research priority.”\n\n{snip}\n\nFirst religion - they worship Life and Mother of Life *First abstract idea - Lion Man, representing Natural Law of Life *First social idea - Egalitarianism (almost unrealistic today).\n\nAURIGNACIAN - the World's First Abstract Mindset Man from Europe\n\nThe video reveals the lifestyles of Ice Age hunters, how they started fire, type of hunting weapons they used and goes into some detail how the women contributed to their lifestyle and diet.\n\nMystery of Life in the Paleolithic Age: Documentary on Stone Age Archaeology (Full Documentary)\n\nEuropeans, Middle East Caucasoids, and Asians have Neanderthals DNA.\n\nGenetic studies have indicated that non-Africans, (i.e. today’s Europeans and Asians), have between 1% – 4% of the genes from Neanderthals. The theory is that we obtained these genes from interracial relations with Neanderthals and Cro-Magnon (European Caucasians). This might be true in some cases however, there are some researchers who believe that a group of Neanderthals directly developed into Cro-Magnon man possibly in Eurasia. This means that Europeans and the rest of the Neanderthal population existed simultaneously for a very long time till the Neanderthals eventually died out and were replaced by Cro-Magnon man as the dominant hominid in Europe and the Middle East.\n\nFor more information, have a read of David Duke's article discussing new research completed in 2012.\n\nIce Age White European houses and Culture\n\nMany people believe that early Europeans lived in caves, but evidence shows that this was not always true because there are not many caves people can live in.

In this Ancient Architects video, I take a look at the discovery.\n\nExcavations at the site began in 2015 and took three years to complete and have only just been published in the journal Antiquity and the findings are hugely important for our understanding of ancient humans.\n\nThe site of the large mammoth house also contains smaller buildings that were discovered back in the 1960s and 70s. It is located 310 miles south of Moscow and is now home to a museum.\n\nThe mammoth bone structures are not unique, examples are found right across Eastern Europe but until now, the oldest one was dated at 22,000 years old. Therefore the new discovery in Russia’s is the oldest example.\n\nExperts have always said that these structures were built by roaming hunter-gatherers of the Palaeolithic, for refuge to survive the harsh winters of the ice age.\n\nBut the mammoth house found in Russia measures 30 feet by 30 feet. It is made from hundreds of mammoth bones and it would have taken considerable time and effort to make. For so-called hunter-gatherers, who roamed and didn’t spend a long time in one location, why would they go to so much trouble?\n\nIn Focus: Mammoth Bone Huts of Mezhirich\n\nDepictions of humans in Europe from 15,000 42,000 years before present\n\nPre Indo-European peoples of Europe From the Neanderthals and Cromagnon/Aurignacian modern humans in the upper paleolithic to the Minoan earliest .\n\nWhat could be the oldest lifelike drawings of human faces have been uncovered in a cave in southern France.

This was one of the first examples of mass produced art. Fragments of up to ten examples of this design have been found, which means that scores or hundreds must have been manufactured originally. The joke must have been very popular amongst the people of the time! The ibex figure alone is about 7 cm long, and dates to about 16 000 BP. The entire propulseur is 29.5 cm in length. The engraved line along the body of the animal possibly represents a change in the colour of the coat. Although most authorities give the interpretation of a turd with birds above, Bandi (1988) proposes that the 'sausage' coming out of the back of the ibex/chamois is the sac of an infant, and the animal is giving birth. The reasons given are that animals never look back to see their own excrement, but usually do so when giving birth. In addition, the author says that the object is too thick to be excrement, it is much more likely to be the sac of an infant.

However, over the course of the next 5,000 years the human population increased dramatically, allowing them to occupy new territories, while Neanderthals gradually died out\n\nExactly why this was the case has long eluded archaeologists, but now, an international team of researchers may have found the answer – modern humans developed projectile weapons such as spears and spear-throwers and bows and arrows to enable them to hunt more successfully than Neanderthals.\n\nAs a result, modern humans had ready access to food and were able to thrive while Neanderthals struggled to find sustenance and eventually went extinct.\n\nThe team found evidence of projectile weapons dating back 40,000 to 45,000 years, more than 20,000 earlier than any similar weapons found previously, in the Grotta del Cavallo, a limestone cave found in Southern Italy known to have been used by early modern humans during the Paleolithic era.\n\n48,000-year-old arrowheads found in Sri Lankan cave\n\nAn international team of researchers have found a cache of immaculately preserved bone arrowheads in the cave of Fa-Hien Lena, deep in the heart of Sri Lanka’s rainforests.

Pictures: Vitaly Medvedev, Oksana Yanshina\n\nAncient potteries started to appear in the Amur region in the Russian Far East between roughly 16,000 and 12,000 years ago, as the Ice Age slightly eased.\n\nBut what was cooking?\n\nA new international study asks not only why the pots evolved at this time - but examines the type of food they served.\n\nIt turns out some ancient Siberian hunter-gatherers survived the Ice Age by inventing pottery which helped them to maintain a fish diet.\n\nOthers used their new pots to cook meat.\n\nI even think that they came up with the idea of permanent dwellings. One of the earliest permanent dwelling appears in the Osipovka culture as they allowed to stay at the same place during the winter season, having stored big amount of fish.\n\n‘They had no need to relocate together with migrating animals, as did hunters. Their dwellings were dug into the ground. They dug a round holes, put the pillars and covered them with roof of birch bark, turf.\n\n‘It is great that the resent research from our international team confirmed our suggestions and helped us to get closer to understanding of this unique and amazing culture.'\n\nThe Swastika is viewed mostly as a symbol of evil nowadays, but the real origins of this symbols is anything but, it has a history of over 12,000 years and appears in cultures from around the world.\n\nThe TRUE Meaning Of The SWASTIKA & Its 12,000 Years Of History\n\nIce Age White Europeans craved the Swastika on mammoth tusk dated 12, 00 years ago. The ancient European Celtic, Germanic, Scythian, Tocharian, Thracian all used it as \"Good tidings.\" The Swastika is found in India, China, and the northern Americans used it. It would be impossible that people over the world would have the same symbol if not introduced.\n\nRock Paintings in Spain\n\nThe stone age Europeans who lived in Spain left many rock paintings of themselves depicting hunting, honey collecting and other activities, women with long hair, fully covered with skirts down to just above their knees, men in real trousers, or sometimes naked. The paintings show that they used bow and arrows and sometimes wore headdresses that may have contained feathers.\n\nThis artwork is also referred to as Levantine art. These sites are now classified as World Heritage Sites by Unesco. Rock art shown here have been found at over 700 sites. The paintings feature Europeans and the animals they hunted were in the Eastern part of Spain. These date to the Upper Palaeolithic or, more likely, the Mesolithic periods of the Stone Age.\n\nThis artwork spans a large period of time and reflects much cultural change in the area. It shows beautiful images of hunter-gatherer economic systems which over time incorporated the beginnings of settlement showing the use of domesticated cattle and dogs.\n\nNets and skis from ancient times\n\nMan gathering honey, from the Cuevas de la Araña, Bicorp\n\nRock art of the Iberian Mediterranean BasinFrom Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia\n\n7,000 years old rock art in Northern Europe.\n\n7,000 year old rock art in Norway ??

They were based on a find from the middle–late Neolithic settlement of Šventoji 2B (Lithuania), dated back to ~4000–2900 BC. The found two specimens were made of lime bast. They were compared with other extant European twines of similar or close periods. Three pieces of rectangular shape were produced, in order to test some technical and functional questions. In 2012, it was decided to come back to one of the objects, which had inspired some construction and wearing possibilities of the (re)constructed twined clothing.\n\nIt was an engraving on the aurochs bone, depicting five anthropomorphic figures, which was found in Ryemarksgård settlement (Denmark) and dated back to ~8000 BC. A set of photos, testing various variations of wearing the three pieces of clothing, was taken. There were tested more than 25 wearing possibilities, both male and female. Then it was tried to find out poses and actual pieces of clothing, which would best match the depicted figures. According to the congruous silhouette and constructional lines of the clothing, it was presumed, that most of the figures wore a rectangular long cloth (“a cloak”), just in 3-4 different ways. Some of the figures possibly wore a shorter rectangular cloth (“a skirt”) underneath. Repeating parallel lines of the depicted clothing clearly indicate twining, and actual qualities of the (re)constructed twines do confirm the indication. Thus, it is highly possible, that twined clothing was produced and worn by some Mesolithic communities, i.e. much "
