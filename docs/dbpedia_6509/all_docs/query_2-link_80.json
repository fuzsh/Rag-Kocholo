In order to accommodate all time zones, there will be two Connections Companions live every day, dated based on Eastern Standard Time.\n\nIf you find yourself on the wrong companion, check the number of your puzzle, and go to this page to find the corresponding companion.\n\nPost your solve grid in the comments and see how your score compares with the editor’s rating, and one another’s.\n\nToday’s difficulty\n\nThe difficulty of each puzzle is determined by averaging the ratings provided by a panel of testers who are paid to solve each puzzle in advance to help us catch bugs, inconsistencies and other issues. A higher rating means the puzzle is more difficult.\n\nToday’s difficulty is 2.6 out of 5.\n\nFurther Reading\n\nWant to give us feedback?
