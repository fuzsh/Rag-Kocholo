However, we wont to change manually this in our phones/other devices.\n\nSo, please make an update for Iranian's devices to get back this setting, or maybe change hour.\n\nThanks\n\nHello Hossein Ganjyar, and welcome to the Community. I can certainly understand the annoyance of being an hour off on your region's time. However, this forum is for support of US products and customers. As your product is a non-US model and support for these models is very limited, please seek a support team for your area. You can do so by using this link: https://www.samsung.com/us/common/visitlocationsite.html."
