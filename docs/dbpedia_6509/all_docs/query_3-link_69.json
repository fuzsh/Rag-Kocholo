        "text": "¶ INTRODUCTION\n\nAir Traffic Services units shall use Coordinated Universal Time (UTC) and shall express the time in hours and minutes and, when required, seconds of the 24-hour day beginning at midnight.\n\nCoordinated Universal Time (UTC) shall be used by all stations in the aeronautical telecommunication service.\n\nThe reference time Coordinated Universal Time or UTC can be called “Zulu” time\n\nAir Traffic Services units shall be equipped with clocks indicating the time in hours, minutes and seconds, clearly visible from each operating position in the unit concerned.\n\nThis time is set using several time references in some science laboratories.\n\nMidnight shall be designated as 2400 for the end of the day and 0000 for the beginning of the day.\n\nA date-time group shall consist of six figures, the first two figures representing the date of the month and the last four figures the hours and minutes in UTC. (examples are found in METARs and TAFs).\n\nThe time origin is Greenwich Mean Time (GMT) which is set to the Greenwich meridian 0°.\n\n¶ STANDARD TIME\n\nDepending on its position in the world, a country can adopt its own hour named \"standard time\".\n\nPrior to the introduction of standard time, each municipality throughout the clock-using world set its official clock, if it had one, according to the local position of the Sun.\n\nStandard time is the synchronization of clocks within a geographical area or region to a single time standard, rather than using solar time or a locally chosen meridian (longitude) to establish a local mean time standard.\n\nThese regions divide the world into twenty-four time zones, each one covering 15 degrees of longitude.\n\nIn conclusion, local country standard time will differ around the world.\n\nBe aware that some countries adopt local hour shifts between spring and winter period in order to save power consumption.\n\n¶ PROBLEMS WHEN USING STANDARD TIME\n\nFor a flight which takes off at 13H00 standard time at Göteborg-Landvetter airport ESGG (Sweden) and lands at 8H00 standard time at Hong-Kong VHHH (China), if you do not know the standard time reference, it is difficult to know the exact number of hours this flight takes.\n\nThe result is certainly not 19 hours (19H = (08H – 13H) + 24H)\n\n¶ UTC OR “ZULU” TIME\n\nUniversal Time (UT) is a time standard based on the Earth's rotation.\n\nCoordinated Universal Time is the primary time standard by which the world regulates clocks and time.\n\nNearly all UTC days contain exactly 86,400 seconds.\n\nUTC (Coordinated Universal Time) is an atomic timescale that approximates UT.\n\nUTC is also the time standard used in aviation to avoid confusion about time zones and daylight saving time for\n\nflight plans\n\nair traffic control clearances\n\nweather forecasts and maps\n\nNow with the example given in the previous chapter, if you know that the flight takes off at 12H00 UTC on ESGG and lands at 24H00 UTC on VHHH, with the same reference, we are now sure that the flight takes 12Hours ( 12H = 24H – 12H)\n\nThat is why all aircraft flight plans and aerodromes adopt UTC time in order to have the same reference all around the world and do not take into account the local hours offset during their flight and also for calculation purposes.\n\nUTC time is mandatory for all flights in order to have the same worldwide reference.\n\nA time check has to be done before taxiing for take-off.\n\n¶ STANDARD TIME ZONE\n\nStandard time zones around the world are expressed using positive or negative offsets from UTC, as in the list of time zones by UTC offset.\n\nThe difference between UTC time and the standard time is set by national regulation and the difference is given with a multiple of hours and sometimes one half hour is added.\n\nThe table below shows an example of offsets used to calculate the standard time in some countries:\n\n¶ SEE ALSO\n\nDaytime and night\n\n¶ REFERENCE\n\nICAO Documentation Annex 10 - Aeronautical Telecommunications - Volume II - Communication Procedures - Chapter 3.4\n\nICAO Documentation Annex 11 - Air Traffic Services - 14th Edition - July 2016 - Chapter 2.26\n\n¶ AUTHOR"
