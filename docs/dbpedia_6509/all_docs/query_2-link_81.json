        "text": "You can assign up to 6 phone numbers to a Personal Connection (PC) dialing record. For example, you could have PC attempt to call the home number of each record three times before attempting to call the cell number. After two attempts on the cell phone, you could have PC send a Proactive SMS message to the cell phone and then try the home number a few more times before finally attempting the work number.\n\nYou can set up different allowable calling times for each individual phone number in the record, and you can have a default allowable calling time for each type of number in the calling list. It applies to all records that don't contain an individually specified allowable time range.\n\nDo each task in the given order to set up PC dialing and SMS messaging for multiple phone numbers per record.\n\nCreate Custom Fields for Each Phone Type\n\nRequired permissions: Calling List Create\n\nClick the app selector and select ACD.\n\nGo to Lists > Custom Data Definitions.\n\nIf you want to have associated caller ID, compliance, attempts, description, start time, or end time fields for your custom phone field, create those fields first. To do so:\n\nClick the app selector and select ACD.\n\nGo to Lists > Custom Data Definitions.\n\nClick Create New.\n\nEnter a Field Name. Don't give a custom field the same name as a system field. If you plan to make the field visible to agents, make the name readable by adding spaces. If you're using this field as a script variable, you cannot use spaces. If you want the field to be both a script variable and visible to agents, you can use underscores to improve readability or create two mappings to the same field.\n\nSelect a field Type according to these requirements:\n\nField\n\nRequirements\n\nCaller ID Value String Type\n\nCompliance\n\nBoolean Type\n\nAttempts Integer Type Description Integer Type Start Time Integer Type. This setting overrides the default value if you set one. End Time Integer Type. This setting overrides the default value if you set one.\n\nIf you want to set a default field value and your selected Type supports it, enter the Default value. The value you entered applies to all records that don't specify a value for that field.\n\nIf your selected Type supports it and you want to prevent the system from assigning a default value to contacts without an assigned value for the field, select Value Required.\n\nClick Add.\n\nRepeat these steps for each field you want to associate with your custom phone field.\n\nClick Create New.\n\nEnter a Field Name and select the Phone or SMSPhone Type.\n\nIf you created an associated caller ID, compliance, attempts, description, start time, or end time field to apply to this field, select them in their respective fields.\n\nIf you want to set default allowable time ranges for calling or sending SMS messages to contacts, use the Constraints fields. You can create different windows for weekdays and weekends, and each can have multiple time ranges. Because these constraints set the default calling time ranges, the constraints you specify are overridden by values of Start Time and End Time, if you set up related fields.\n\nClick Add.\n\nRepeat these steps for each phone type you want to add to your records.\n\nUpload a Calling List with Multiple Phone Columns\n\nIf you haven't already done so, create a calling list:\n\nCalling list files can't exceed 256 MB in size or 500,000 records. Smaller calling lists result in faster upload and fresher records. Each individual record in a calling list cannot exceed a length of 512 Unicode characters. Calling list uploads support Unicode UTF-8 encoding, which includes Chinese characters and all other languages. If you're creating or editing calling lists in Microsoft Excel, take care to preserve the UTF-8 encoding format.\n\nCXone strips the formatting from phone numbers in calling lists and stores the phone numbers in a universal format. This allows phone numbers to pass between calling lists and do not call (DNC) lists without conflict.\n\nOpen a spreadsheet editor or a text editor.\n\nYou can use the first row to label your columns. This helps with automatic field mapping when you upload the calling list. If you're using a text editor, decide whether to separate the values with commas or tabs.\n\nCreate the columns for your list.\n\nFor a Proactive Voice calling list, you must have a unique identifier column and a phone number column.\n\nLearn more about other system fields you can map to\n\nField\n\nDetails\n\nExternal ID Required. An alphanumeric string that is the unique identification of the record.\n\nScore\n\nA relative numeric value you can use to sort records a certain way. For example, if you want PC to dial one record before another, you could give the first record a Score of 1 and the second record a Score of 2 and sort the calling list by score.\n\nCustomer Field 1 and 2\n\nA numeric value you can use for any purpose. For example, it could be an alternate record ID or an amount due.\n\nThese fields are not a method for creating custom fields in the agent application. To do that, configure the Custom Display fields in List Management PC skill parameters.\n\nCaller ID The phone number you want to display as the caller ID for this contact. The number here replaces the default caller ID value set in the skill. This number can be a 10-digit number, NANP format, or E164+ phone numbers. You are required by law to display a valid phone number that contacts can use to reach you. Priority A boolean value that indicates whether the record is a priority record. Compliance Required A boolean value that indicates whether the record requires compliance handling. Time Zone\n\nThe time zone of the contact. You can use either the full name or the list of approved abbreviations for the time zone.\n\nAFT â Afghanistan Time\n\nAKST â Alaska Standard Time\n\nAST â Atlantic Standard Time\n\nACST â Australian Central Standard Time\n\nAEST â Australian Eastern Standard Time\n\nAZOST â Azores Summer Time\n\nCVT â Cape Verde Time\n\nAMT â Caucasus Standard Time\n\nCST â Central Standard Time\n\nBTT â Bhutan Time\n\nBST â British Summer Time\n\nCET â Central European Time\n\nCEST â Central Summer European Time\n\nSBT â Soloman Islands Time\n\nBIT â Baker Island Time (Dateline)\n\nEAT â East Africa Time\n\nEAST â Easter Island Standard Time\n\nEEST â Eastern European Summer Time\n\nESAST â E.

This setting will be ignored when Deliver Numbers Serially is enabled in the PC skill or when the record is being delivered as a callback. Agent Requests a specific agent to speak with the contact. The value is the agent ID. Override Finalization\n\nA boolean value overriding the system finalization reason. Use it to upload a record that was previously finalized and continue dialing it. If you map this column and set a contact record to False and any previous final outcomes exist for the record on this skill, PC rejects the record.\n\nIf you don't map an Override Finalization column, you can override finalized records by re-uploading them as long as the record was finalized more than two hours ago. If you upload a record that was finalized less than two hours previously, PC rejects the record.\n\nOverriding finalized records can corrupt reporting. If you want to place additional calls as a follow-up to a previous interaction, you should upload the record to a new skill and manage it as a new interaction effort.\n\nCall Request Date/Time\n\nThe date and time when PC begins delivering a scheduled callback to a skill or agent. The field contains both the date, time, and time zone in the following format: MM/DD/YYYY HH:MM:SS [-H:MM|Z].\n\nFor more information, see Upload Timed Call Requests in a Calling List.\n\nCall Request Stale Minutes The number of minutes after the Call Request Date/Time that PC continues to try to deliver a call request before retiring it. After the stale time expires, PC finalizes the record and no longer attempts it. For more information, see Upload Timed Call Requests in a Calling List. Expiration Date The date and time when the contact record expires. PC ceases all attempts to reach the contact after the specified date and time. This is an optional field that overrides the expiration date configured for the skill and the Batch Expiration Date configured for this calling list. For more information, see Set an Individual Record Expiration. Start Time The number of minutes after midnight PC begins dialing the record. For example, if you want PC to begin attempting the record at 8:00 AM in a record's respective time zone, set the value in the calling list to the value of 480.\n\nIf you map this field to a calling list, PC ignores the default start time for any applicable records.\n\nEnd Time The number of minutes after midnight the dialer stops dialing the record. For example, if you want PC to stop attempting the record at 12:00 PM in a record's respective time zone, set the value in the calling list to 720.\n\nIf you map this field to a calling list, PC ignores the default end time for any applicable records.\n\nSave the file in one of the approved formats shown in the following images.\n\nXL or XLS.\n\nComma-delimited TXT or CSV\n\nTab-delimited TXT or CSV\n\nIn your calling list, add columns for each of the custom phone fields and each of their associated custom fields you created.\n\nUpload the calling list.\n\nIf you're re-uploading a calling list after making critical updates, stop the associated ACD skill. Restart the ACD skill when you're done uploading calling lists.\n\nSet the Dialing Order for Multiple Phone Numbers\n\nRequired permissions: Skills Edit\n\nEach Personal Connection (PC) record belongs to a single contact and contains all information for that contact, including all phone numbers associated with the contact. Attempt cadence is the order in which PC calls the single contact's varying telephone numbers, texts the contact's cell phone, or a combination of both. For example, you might set up a cadence so PC attempts calling the contact's phone numbers in the following order: home, home, work, cell, home, home, home, cell SMS, work, work, cell, spouse cell.\n\nPC keeps a record of each attempt along with the outcome. Once a call results in contact with the correct party, PC makes no further attempts on the record. If the outcome is interception or wrong party reached, the system finalizes only the telephone number that generated that outcome and attempts the rest until it reaches the maximum record attempts."
