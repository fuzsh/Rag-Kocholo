        "text": "The helmet depicted on the capital at Ṭāq-e Bostān is the main evidence for employment of lamellar helmets by the Sasanian warriors. It seems that the decorated helmets of the kind were the marks of high status and were adopted by the Iranian warriors from the steppe peoples, most likely after recovery of control over the territories formerly conquered by the Hephtalites. Steppe nomads popularized this form of military gear throughout Eurasia. Another depictions which seem related to the personage on the capital at Ṭāq-e Bostān are representations on the reverses of the coins of Xusrō II, sometimes named as “Anāhitā” type. Similarity between the coinage and the capital allows to identify the personages as the same. This excludes the goddess as possible portrayed personage. Similarly possibility to identify the personage as Vərəθraγna-Bahrām should be refuted due to connection with Bahrām Čōbīn. If the emissions of the coins with the personage in the lamellar helmet were to commemorate the revenge over the murderers of Emperor Maurice than mentioning the name of Bahrām in positive context would be inappropriate. The most likely solution seems existence of secular system of allegories in Sasanian art which would allow transition of various meanings without the refrence to the yazatas.\n\nThis paper examines Iranian helmets from the 2nd century BCE Parthian era into the Sasanian era in the 3rd to 7th century CE. Analyses involve excavated helmets, and depictions of helmets on plaques, coins, bullae, metalworks and stone reliefs housed in museums, private collections and auction houses. Clay sculptures and wall paintings in Central Asia, depictions on Roman victory columns and the line drawings of Dura Europos as well as the reliefs in Iran provide additional information on Iranian headgear and helmets. Sasanian helmets appear to have utilized a rank and/or heraldry system with the possibility that helmets varied between the different regions of the Sasanian Empire (especially between the western and northeast regions). Limitations to research due to limited (especially Parthian) helmet samples are discussed with suggestions for further research.\n\nThis paper analyzes the role of the military costume in the portrait of the Hellenistic and Roman rulers in the Near East from Alexander to the third century AD. Even if there is little contemporary evidence, two important monuments as the so-called Sarcophagus of Alexander and the Nemrut Dağ, the portraits of the Near Eastern rulers in other media as coins or gems, the so-called ‘cuirassed gods’ and the later imperial images of Alexander and Seleucus allowed to highlight the major role of the cuirassed image in the iconography of the Hellenistic sovereigns in the Near East. Alexander brought in the region a new military habitus that was immediately and consciously used to emphasize both the Greek identity and the authority of the king. The cuirassed statue, with a few exceptions, prevailed also in the portraiture of the Roman Emperors. However, the Imperial Age gradually introduced also a ‘new’ element, the fully decorated cuirassed statue that had been elaborated in the Augustan Rome. This ‘Roman’ model was not immediately accepted, but in the second century the statuarytypes used in the Near East were often the same used in the western provinces as well. In this way, the fully decorated breastplate became a true symbol of the power of the Roman emperors.\n\nhe armour of the personage depicted on the capital from Bisotun, exhibited in Ṭāq-e Bostān, has been an object of the research already several times with no definite setting in typology of arms and armour and allocation in historical trends. The article attempts to fill this gap. The article defines the helmet as lamellar/laminar type with the splints with ornately incised edges and central splint over the personage’s nose. The top of the dome is crowned by the decorative, solid finial to which a korymbos is attached. This relates the helmet to the lamellar helmets from Xinjiang and Tang Dynasty China rather than to [?] earlier Kushan lamellar helmets and related Eurasian types, characterised by a flat, round sheet at the top of the dome, usually a sheet over the face, often with a nasal and the laminae running overlapping around the dome, without the central lamina over the face and other laminae spreading to its sides. The body armour can be described as a cuirass made of metallic stripes riveted to each other and placed horizon-tally, with the central, vertical stripe in front. The type is derived from Parthian predecessors with plausible earlier, Achaemenid and Hellenistic sources. The cuirass with frontal opening was a dominant type of construction among the Sasanian armours. The direct relation was evidenced with Korean and Japanese cuirasses of 3rd and 4th centu-ries (later replaced by lamellar coats) and Eurasian, mainly Xinjiang types."
