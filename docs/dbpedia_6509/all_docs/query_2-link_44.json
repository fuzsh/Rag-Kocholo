        "text": "IANA Time Zones\n\nAt TimeAPI we make use of IANA Time Zones. These are time zone ids that each map to an unique time zone. These IANA Time Zones are standardized by the Internet Assigned Numbers Authority. IANA Time Zones follows this convention: {AREA}/{LOCATION}. An area corresponds to a continent or an ocean and the location to a location within the continent. IANA Time Zones were designed for the age of computers and the internet, intended to solve several problems that arose from different time zone naming conventions being used across the world.\n\nFor example, Windows exposes time zones such as Central European Standard Time while other parties might use Central European Time. IANA Time Zones also solve the problem such as asking the current time for Central European Summer Time (CEST) while Central European Time (CET) is active."
