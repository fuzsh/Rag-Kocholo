        "text": "Asia Time Zones\n\nAsia uses a total of 13 different time zones, ranging from UTC+2 to UTC+9.\n\n8 time zones coincide with the meridians multiples of 15º = 60 exact minutes, and\n\n5 time zones are in intermediate meridians of 30 and 45 minutes. (four of 30' and one of 45'). These intermediate time zones, are highlighted with different colors to the usual 4 (yellow - orange - green - pink).\n\nAsia Time Zones\n\nWest Asia (EET) / West Asia (SA) / West Asia (UAE) / Iran / Afghanistan / Central and South Asia / East Asia (+7+8) / India / Nepal / Myanmar / Southeast Asia (+7+8) / Mongolia / China / Indonesia / East and Southeast Asia (+9). Asia map\n\nAsian countries with daylight saving time\n\nWest Asia, specifically the UTC+2 in standard time / UTC +3 in summer time or what would be the same EET / EEST (Easter European Summer Time), which includes the countries: Cyprus - Israel - Lebanon and Palestinian Territories, all of them advance 1 hour during summer time.\n\nIran, Jordan and Syria no longer use DST, the last daylight saving time change was in 2022.\n\nCurrent time of these Asian countries\n\nAsian countries with 1/2 hour time zones\n\nAsia has 4 countries that adapt their time zone, right in the middle of the meridians multiples of 15º equivalent to 1 hour.\n\nThat is, they use time zones adapted to the 30-minute (1/2 hour) time slot, instead of 1 hour.\n\nThose countries are: Iran - Afghanistan - India - Myanmar (Burma). See Asia map\n\nIran Afghanistan UTC +3:30 UTC +4:30 India Myanmar (Burma) UTC +5:30 UTC +6:30\n\nNepal, a country with a 3/4-time slot\n\nIn the Northeast part of India, Nepal is located, with UTC +5:45 time zone, that is with an interval of 3/4 of 1 hour or 45 minutes. Which can be somewhat more complex to calculate the difference with other different time zones.\n\nAlthough to make a faster calculation, it is enough to know the time zone of India +5:30 and add 1/4 of an hour more (15 minutes), or what would be the same, subtract 15 minutes to the time zone of Bhutan or Bangladesh both UTC +6:00 with which we would obtain the time of Nepal.\n\nIndia Nepal UTC +5:30\n\nUTC +5:45\n\nBangladesh/Bhutan UTC +6:00\n\nIntermediate Time Zones in Asia\n\nThere are 5 countries in Asia that do not adjust to the exact time 60 minutes corresponding to meridians multiples of 15º.\n\nTo differentiate these 5 countries from the rest, 5 additional colors have been associated with these intermediate time slots. In this way, it can be easier to distinguish them from most countries that adhere to the 1-hour time slot.\n\nThere are 4 countries with a time zone that fit the 1/2 hour time slot, and the 5th Nepal, which fits the 3/4 hour time slot. All 5 appear with different colors.\n\nThese 5 countries with intermediate time zones are: Afghanistan - India (Sri Lanka) - Iran - Myanmar - Nepal\n\nIran Afghanistan UTC +3:30 UTC +4:30 India / Sri Lanka Myanmar Burma UTC +5:30 UTC +6:30 Nepal (white color) UTC +5:45"
