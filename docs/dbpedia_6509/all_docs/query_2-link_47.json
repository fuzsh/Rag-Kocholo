        "text": "A string with a BCP 47 language tag or an Intl.Locale instance, or an array of such locale identifiers. The runtime's default locale is used when undefined is passed or when none of the specified locale identifiers is supported. For the general form and interpretation of the locales argument, see the parameter description on the Intl main page.\n\nThe following Unicode extension key is allowed:\n\nnu\n\nSee numberingSystem.\n\nca\n\nSee calendar.\n\nhc\n\nSee hourCycle.\n\nThese keys can also be set with options (as listed below). When both are set, the options property takes precedence.\n\nWhether to use 12-hour time (as opposed to 24-hour time). Possible values are true and false; the default is locale dependent. When true, this option sets hourCycle to either \"h11\" or \"h12\", depending on the locale. When false, it sets hourCycle to \"h23\". hour12 overrides both the hc locale extension tag and the hourCycle option, should either or both of those be present.\n\nThe time zone to use. Time zone names correspond to the Zone and Link names of the IANA Time Zone Database, such as \"UTC\", \"Asia/Shanghai\", \"Asia/Kolkata\", and \"America/New_York\". Additionally, time zones can be given as UTC offsets in the format \"Â±hh:mm\", \"Â±hhmm\", or \"Â±hh\", for example as \"+01:00\", \"-2359\", or \"+23\". The default is the runtime's default time zone.\n\nThe format matching algorithm to use. Possible values are \"basic\" and \"best fit\"; the default is \"best fit\". Implementations are required to support displaying at least the following subsets of date-time components:\n\nweekday, year, month, day, hour, minute, second\n\nweekday, year, month, day\n\nyear, month, day\n\nyear, month\n\nmonth, day\n\nhour, minute, second\n\nhour, minute\n\nImplementations may support other subsets, and requests will be negotiated against all available subset-representation combinations to find the best match. The algorithm for \"best fit\" is implementation-defined, and \"basic\" is defined by the spec. This option is only used when both dateStyle and timeStyle are undefined (so that each date-time component's format is individually customizable)."
