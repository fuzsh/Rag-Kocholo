        "text": "Many Indian outsourcing firms offer to work almost the same office hours as their clients – they will work âin your time zoneâ so to speak. This can be an attractive proposition to rich-world clients located in faraway time zones such as Europe, Australia and North America.\n\nClients who insist on their Indian outsourcing team to work much outside of their own time zone can stand to lose in the long-term though. In India as in much of the rest of the world, top talent has plenty of job options. Especially IT professionals.\n\nMaking an offshoring project successful is all about recruiting and retaining the best talent. Requiring talent to work uncomfortable hours every day is a sure way to lose them to the competition.\n\nA normal and comfortable work shift in India would be 9 AM to 6 PM. With flexible timings, Indian staff could comfortably come in either 7.00 AM or stay late to 8.30 PM (from my experience, the typical young software developer more often stays late).\n\nIf so, their 13-hour comfortable hours would make meetings possible with clients from all around the world, from California via Europe to eastern Australia.\n\nEven with limited overlap, outsourcing companies and agencies can successfully collaborate with clients especially when focused on providing great service quality which reduces the need for frequent webcam meetings.\n\nThe timezone gap can even be turned into an advantage, where clients send requests in the evening and can see the results when they come back into the office the next morning.\n\nHere at LiteBreeze, our software developers focus on providing great service quality and maximizing the value they add, to make collaboration in faraway time zones simple for our clients.\n\nIn some cases, staff can even handle planned and occasional odd-hour webcam meetings from home.\n\nUptime of software systems are ensured through reliable and trusted cloud server infrastructure providers such as AWS and Rackspace. For large critical business systems, we can provide on-call developers.\n\nThe following regions overlap during daylight savings time (DST) with the following number of hours:\n\nEuropean time zones overlap with India\n\nTime zone nameUTCCorresponding working hours (7.00 AM to 8.30 PM IST)Example citiesBritish Summer Time (BST)UTC + 12.30 AM to 4.00 PMGuernsey, Isle of Man, Jersey, UK main Islands(England, Wales, Scotland, Northern Ireland)Central European Summer Time (CEST)UTC + 23.30 AM to 5.00 PMAustria, Belgium, Croatia, Czech Republic, Denmark, Italy, France, Germany, Macedonia, Norway, Poland, Serbia, Slovakia, Spain, Sweden, SwitzerlandEastern European Summer Time (EEST)UTC + 34.30 AM to 6.00 PMBulgaria, Finland, Greece, Romania, UkraineGreenwich Mean Time (GMT)UTC + 01.30 AM to 3.00 PMGreenland, Jersey, UK main Islands(England, Wales, Scotland, Northern Ireland)Irish Standard Time (IST)UTC + 12.30 AM to 4.00 PMIrelandMoscow Standard Time (MSK)UTC + 34.30 AM to 6.00 PMMoscow, Ukraine, GeorgiaTurkey Time\n\n(TRT)UTC + 34.30 AM to 6.00 PMTurkey\n\nAustralia and New Zealand time zones overlap with India\n\nIn Australia, Daylight saving is observed in New South Wales, Victoria, South Australia, Tasmania, and the Australian Capital Territory.\n\nDaylight saving is not observed in Queensland, the Northern Territory or Western Australia.\n\nDaylight Saving Time begins at 2 AM on the first Sunday in October, when clocks are put forward one hour.
