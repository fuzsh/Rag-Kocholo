The Iran Time Zone

Iran uses Iran Standard Time (IRST) as standard time, which is three and a half hours after UTC (UTC+3:30). Unlike most time zones, Iran has a half-hour offset instead of the usual full-hour offset.

IRST Time Zone Meridian

Iran bases its standard time specifically on the solar time at 52.5Â° east longitude, which runs about 400 km (250 miles) east of Tehran. The same meridian is used in the Persian Solar Hijri calendar, or Iranian calendar, to set the start of the year, known as Norooz.

Iran observes Iran Standard Time all year. There are no Daylight Saving Time clock changes.
