Iran Standard Time (IRST)

The differences between time zones to each other are always specified in relation to the "Universal Time Coordinated" (UTC), the time on the prime meridian (zero longitude). Phoenix, for example, is on the 122nd degree of longitude west and thus in the UTC-7 time zone. Iran Standard Time is consistent with UTC +3:30.

The Iran Standard Time does not have an associated daylight saving time.
