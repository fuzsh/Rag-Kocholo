Iran Standard Time is three and a half hours ahead of the Coordinated Universal Time standard, written as an offset of UTC + 3:30. That means to find the standard time in the zone you must add three and a half hours from Coordinated Universal Time.

Iran Standard Time is considered a nonstandard time zone because it does not have an hourly incremental difference like most other zones. Instead, there's an additional 30 minute time difference between this zone and standard time.

Territories observing the time zone are primarily in southern Asia. It runs through the country of Iran. Those in the time zone also refer to it as Iran Time (IT).

During fall to winter months Iran Standard Time is used, and then during Daylight Saving (spring to summer months) Iran Daylight Time or IRDT is used.
