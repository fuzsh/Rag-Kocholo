Iran has an east-west extension of 16.7 degrees of longitude. Given the country's location in South Asia, this corresponds to about 1500 kilometers. At this extension, the sun's course is noticeable at different positions in the country, but it still turns out to be moderate. The position of the sun in the west of the country differs from that in the east by about 67 minutes. This means the sun rises and sets 67 minutes later in the west than in the east. This time difference is already a reason for a second time zone in some other countries. However, this would of course also have organizational and economic disadvantages.

No more daylight saving time in Iran

Due to the sun's orbit around the equator, the days are longer in summer (June to September in the northern hemisphere). Countries that switch to daylight saving time in the summer months align the daylight phase with the human rhythm. Unused bright morning hours are thus shifted into the evening (more information on daylight saving time here).

Due to its distance from the equator, the impact would be significant in Iran. Tehran is located 4,000 km from the equator. A day in midsummer would then not last from 04:47 to 19:25, but from 05:47 to 20:25. Nevertheless, in 2022 it was decided to finally abandon daylight saving time in Iran.

Changes in Daylight Saving Times

In Iran Daylight Saving Time has been observed since 1977 until 09/21/2022. On the night of September 21, 2022 at 11:00 pm, after 45 years, the changeover from summer to winter time ended and the current time zone was retained.
