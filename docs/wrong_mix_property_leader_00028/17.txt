Kalpana Systems is very proud to share that last week, during the opening of the entrepreneurial year at Erasmus University Rotterdam, we were awarded the Next Frontier award by former prime-minister Jan Peter Balkenende. This annual award is given to startups with highly innovative concepts and great potential in global sustainable markets.

We want to thank Ernst Hoestra for hosting and Jan Peter Balkenende for giving us the confidence that we are on the right track to make a big impact in the future!
