        "text": "THE HAGUE, Netherlands -- A young party leader with a physical resemblance to the film character Harry Potter looks set to become the Netherlands' next prime minister.\n\nJan Peter Balkenende has worked magic on his Christian Democrats party (CDA), returning it to power after eight years in opposition with an expected 43 seats in the 150-member lower parliamentary chamber. (Full story)\n\nThe 46-year-old academic breaks the recent mould of the liberal-thinking Netherlands with a hard-working personal ethos -- he's habitually at his desk from 8 a.m. to 3 a.m. -- and a right-wing stand against of soft drugs, gay marriages and euthanasia.\n\nA professor of Christian philosophy -- described by associates as a religious man -- he will need all his skills to keep his expected coalition partners together in one political church.\n\nHe is expected to form an alliance with the Pim Fortuyn List, a three-month-old party based on the principles of its flamboyant, openly gay founder who was assassinated on May 6.\n\nFortuyn backed same-sex marriages, the use of soft drugs and euthanasia. His party came second in Wednesday's vote with 26 seats.\n\nBalkenende's personal popularity during the election was heightened by his outspoken and energetic approach -- as well as the good nature with which he took ribbing about his Harry Potter looks, with his brushed-down hair and round glasses.\n\nHe was even photographed on election day holding a side-by-side photo of himself and Potter star Daniel Radcliffe with the caption, \"Spot the Difference.\"\n\nBut the married father of one also has displayed a steely side, having won a prolonged power struggle in his party to become the first undisputed leader since former Prime Minister Ruud Lubbers left Dutch politics in 1994.\n\nHe was in charge of the party for just eight months when he led it to victory on Wednesday.\n\nBalkenende told cheering supporters he was \"ready to take on the responsibility\" of forming a coalition.\n\n\"He is blessed with enormous drive. He can work from 8 in the morning until 3 at night every day. He forgets time,\" Ceese Van der Knaap, a party official, told The Associated Press.\n\nFor relaxation he skis and follows Formula One racing.\n\nBorn in the southern town of Kapelle, Balkenende is relatively new to national politics, entering parliament in 1998 and becoming his party's financial spokesman. He still teaches a philosophy class once a week.\n\nEarlier, he held executive positions in a Christian TV and radio broadcasting station and served on the municipal council of Amstelveen, a town outside Amsterdam. He wrote dozens of reports for the party's scientific research institute.\n\n\"He is like a walking library,\" drawing on the numerous papers and seminars he has given, said Van der Knaap.\n\n\"At this moment, we're not talking about who governs with whom, but about how the CDA can remain a relevant factor in politics,\" Balkenende said after being named leader of the party."
