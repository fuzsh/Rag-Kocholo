        "text": "Resato International develops and manufactures high-pressure components and systems. One of the solutions offered by the firm is the ACM waterjet cutting system. Resato’s solutions are deployed in a wide range of sectors, including the oil, gas, marine and chemical industries.\n\nInnovations into new markets\n\nThe firm scores exceptionally high on a number of innovation indicators. For example, the jury praises “the company’s ability to develop new solutions in tandem with its entries into new markets.” A good example of this approach is the development of Resato’s ACM waterjet.

All in all, the winner of the 2015 Erasmus Innovation Award 2015 is a good example of how changes in technologies and the organisation can be made to complement one another.\n\nHanskamp AgroTech, TrackJack, and YoungCapital are other prominent examples of private-sector innovation. Based on the data collected in the 2015 edition of the annual Erasmus Competition and Innovation Monitor, desk research and interviews with company representatives, the aforementioned firms were nominated together with Resato International for the 2015 Erasmus Innovation Award.\n\nThe jury responsible for selecting the winner of the 2015 Erasmus Innovation Award 2015 was made up of:"
