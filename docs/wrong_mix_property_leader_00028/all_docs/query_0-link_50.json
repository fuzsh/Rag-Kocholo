We believe that innovation and digital means are the way to tackle this long-standing issue, as well as its negative side effects such as social isolation, poor physical health and loss of education and job opportunities. In particular vulnerable citizens in our society, such as the elderly, disabled, people with low incomes and refugees are more likely to suffer from transport poverty. By supporting innovative projects that tackle transport poverty, we aim to provide more opportunities in the field of health, education, employment and leisure for these citizens. Read more"
