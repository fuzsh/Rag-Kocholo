        "text": "Your Excellency Dr Jan Peter Balkenende, Prime Minister of the Netherlands\n\nDistinguished guests\n\nLadies and gentlemen\n\nOn behalf of the people of Singapore, it gives me great pleasure to warmly welcome Your Excellency and members of your distinguished delegation from the Innovation Platform to Singapore. Your visit will boost our already close ties, and stimulate more areas for fruitful cooperation.\n\nThe bilateral relationship between our two countries is a strong and longstanding one. The Netherlands was among the first countries to recognise Singapore's independence and establish diplomatic relations in 1965. We are also indebted to Dutch economist Dr Albert Winsemius, who provided invaluable and wise advice on economic development and investment policy for many years starting in the 1960s, even before Singapore became independent. On the occasion of Prime Minister Balkenende’s visit, I am pleased to announce that we will be naming one of our public roads after Dr Winsemius, in recognition of his contributions to Singapore.\n\nEnhancing our Bilateral Relationship\n\nToday, Singapore and the Netherlands are linked in many ways. Our economic relationship is robust and deep. The Netherlands is our third largest European trading partner. It is also our second largest investor, with over S$50 billion worth of assets in Singapore. This is a remarkable figure, showing that size is no impediment to achieving a considerable economic impact. Almost a thousand Dutch firms operate out of Singapore, adding to our economic vibrancy and diversity. On our part, Singapore has investments worth S$3.1 billion in the Netherlands.\n\nTies between our armed forces are also strong and growing. Our forces operate together in Oruzgan in Afghanistan, in support of the NATO International Security Assistance Force. Medical teams from the Singapore Armed Forces have been deployed in the Dutch Field Hospital in Oruzgan. We appreciate the pre-deployment training conducted by the Netherlands to help our medical personnel work better with the Dutch forces. Last month, Singapore also sent a Weapon Locating Radar detachment to enhance force protection for the personnel in Oruzgan.\n\nBeyond the economic and security spheres, our people-to-people ties remain strong, anchored by a significant Dutch community in Singapore. Many Dutch citizens contribute to our economy and society, just as Dr Albert Winsemius did a generation ago. I am pleased to share that we will be conferring the Honorary Citizen Award to Mr Jeroen van der Veer, a distinguished Dutch citizen and former Chief Executive of Royal Dutch Shell, for helping to develop Singapore as an energy and petrochemicals hub. The formal ceremony will take place at a later date.\n\nCooperating in Research and Development\n\nWe should continue to identify new areas of cooperation. As small, open economies, Singapore and the Netherlands share similar perspectives on many issues that confront countries in this rapidly-changing world. Both our countries are outward-oriented and fully plugged into the global economy. We have benefitted greatly from globalisation, but we have also been buffeted by the recent global financial crisis.Now both of us must prepare in earnest for a more competitive world after the crisis. We will need to focus on research and development, innovation and enterprise to maintain our competitive edge. I am therefore grateful for this visit by the Innovation Platform, which allows us to exchange views, share best practices and pursue collaborative ventures.\n\nOne area of collaboration is in water and environment management. Our research institutes and corporations often have complementary knowledge, and we should encourage them to link up and share their expertise. I am therefore glad that Singapore’s Public Utilities Board, the National University of Singapore and Dutch research institute Deltares have come together to establish the Aquatic Science Centre, a collabo rative water research initiative. Access to the Aquatic Science Centre will be via the Albert Winsemius Lane, which I alluded to earlier.\n\nSingapore was honoured that the Prince of Orange His Royal Highness Willem-Alexander participated in the Singapore International Water Week earlier this year. We were also pleased that the 2009 Lee Kuan Yew Water prize was awarded to Professor Gatze Lettinga, a Dutch scientist, for pioneering an environmentally-sustainable treatment of used water. I understand that Professor Lettinga chose not to patent his invention. This reflects the generous spirit of the Dutch people and their desire to contribute to the welfare of mankind, especially the developing countries.\n\nOur cooperation in water and waste management is a good example of how two knowledge-based economies can add value to each other. There is much more that we can do. This visit by Prime Minister Balkenende is an opportunity to further enhance our partnership and develop ways to work together for mutual benefit.\n\nLadies and gentlemen,\n\nMay I now invite you to join me in a toast to the continued good health and success of Your Excellency Prime Minister Balkenende; peace and prosperity for the people of the Kingdom of the Netherlands; and closer relations between the Kingdom of the Netherlands and Singapore."
