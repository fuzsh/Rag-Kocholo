        "text": "An ode to Dutch mobility innovations\n\nThe biennial Automotive Innovation Award symbolises the innovative capacity of the Dutch automotive industry. The large number of participants are all of international stature. Even though the Netherlands is not a major car production country, our innovations make a significant difference. This recognition underlines the importance of innovation for a smarter, safer and more sustainable future of mobility.\n\nTLEX: innovation in data exchange\n\nIn the Services category, focused on innovations in sharing and service platforms, data collection and management, Monotch stood out with the TLEX product. This platform facilitates real-time, bi-directional data exchange between roadside equipment and road users, a first of its kind.\n\nA mobility vision that reaches further\n\nMenno Malta, CEO of Monotch, said: “This is a great encouragement. Our dream is to connect road users and roadside equipment. This mission requires patience as the roadside equipment is gradually made smart, but we expect the results in the Netherlands within three years. You can be assured that our ambition goes further than the Dutch border. In any case, this award is an important step for our future.”\n\nRecognition and ambitions of Monotch\n\nThe jury praised Monotch for designing a platform with enormous potential. This is an opportunity to improve traffic flow and contribute to safer traffic. TLEX’s impact on traffic in the Netherlands and Europe was considered tremendous."
