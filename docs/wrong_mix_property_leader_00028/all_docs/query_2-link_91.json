        "text": "AMSTERDAM — Dutch pubcaster the NOS is in trouble with Prime Minister Jan Peter Balkenende after it broadcast the wrong tape of his address to the nation on the death of the Netherlands’ former queen Princess Juliana, who passed away Saturday.\n\nA second tape of the address was made after Balkenende stumbled over the dates of Juliana’s reign.\n\nThe NOS broadcast the wrong tape, then discovered its error and broadcast the correct taping.\n\nJuliana was queen of Holland from 1948 to 1980, when she abdicated her throne to her daughter, Queen Beatrix.\n\nWhile the royal family has not complained, the error was galling to Balkenende, who was accused of showing too little emotion at the death of Beatrix’s former husband Prince Claus in 2002.\n\nThe NOS has apologized, but government information office (RVD) general director Gerard van der Wulp called the mistake “a cardinal sin” that had hurt Balkenende’s public image.\n\nThe NOS is the official source for all information during states of emergency, a time when all public channels would switch automatically to its broadcasts."
