Now we are going for gold.\n\nOn the 6th of February in Studio 21 in Hilversum, Dutch ex-prime minister Jan Peter Balkenende will present a number of themed awards as well as a € 100,000 prize.\n\nVOTING IS FREE, BUT HURRY, the lines close at midnight on the 16th of January. How does it work? Send a text message: NBSA 5972 to 4422. Your text is fee, you will just be charged € 0.25 for the confirmation message to tell you that your vote has been received. Will you vote for InAxtion?\n\nMany thanks."
