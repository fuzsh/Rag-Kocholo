        "text": "The finalists of the Automotive Innovation Award 2024 (AIA) were announced today. They have a chance to win prestigious awards for the Netherlands' most impactful innovations in mobility. In a marathon session earlier this month, the jury reviewed the presentations of 19 entries. After careful consideration, 11 organizations with 11 innovations remained: the finalists. One innovation competes in two categories. Winners will be announced at the grand finale on February 5, 2024, for awards in the Sustainability, Safety, and Accessibility categories, a Student Award, and, of course, the grand prize.\n\nThe finale is the culmination of a process that began last summer with a submission call for innovations in the Dutch automotive sector. That call was heard en masse: the jury received no fewer than a record 43 entries. Of those entries – all of which can be viewed on the AIA website – 11 now remain. Below are the finalists listed by category, with brief descriptions.\n\nFinalists in Category 1: Sustainability\n\n1. LeydenJar – Silicon anodes for higher battery capacity\n\nLeydenJar focuses on battery technology for electric cars and is working to develop an anode – the minus pole of a battery – made of pure silicon, which can achieve a 70% higher energy density. Compared to a traditional battery of the same size, this means high capacity, lightning-fast charging capabilities, reduced environmental impact, lower CO2 emissions, and lower production costs. In other words, the same performance from a much smaller battery – helping to make electric driving more affordable and accessible.\n\n2. Karhof – Sustainer™, a unique way to build cargo bodies\n\nKarhof's SUSTAINERTM is a durable body construction method. With the patented CLIMETM joining technique, panels can be clicked together modularly and quickly, and without glue. With SUSTAINERTM, ultralight bodies can be made in many variants, suitable for any specs (from light EV to 3.5-ton trucks). Due to the modular design, the fully recyclable panels can be easily replaced, which extends their lifespan. In addition, these panels can be shipped more efficiently, helping reduce emissions.\n\n3. Econogy – yDrive, electric powertrain for trailers\n\nEquipping trailers with yDrive (Why Drive) technology transforms any fuel-powered truck into a hybrid, or increases range for electric trucks. yDrive features regenerative braking, which recharges a battery pack while decelerating or driving downhill. When accelerating, emissions-free power assist kicks in to reduce fuel consumption and increase the truck's range. yDrive’s highly precise measurements make the trailer more controllable – a key condition to getting this innovation on the road.\n\nFinalists in Category 2: Safety\n\n1. Total Safety Solutions – Emergency Plug®, the universal “off switch” for electric vehicles\n\nTotal Safety Solutions has developed a universal \"off switch\" for electric vehicles: the Emergency Plug®. This allows electric and hybrid vehicles to be instantly disabled in case of emergency or road work, preventing unpredictable behavior and creating safe conditions for road workers. The otherwise extensive protocol, which also differs per vehicle, is thus reduced for first responders to a few seconds.\n\n2. TomTom – Orbis Maps, real-time integration of several map layers on an open-source platform\n\nUntil recently, every tech giant created its own “base” map with unique map layers. TomTom is the founder of the Overture platform, where, together with Meta, Microsoft, and Amazon, it provides a single open access base map. Public and private parties can offer their unique map layers through the Overture platform (free or paid). Orbis Maps is TomTom's own map layers offering, which includes safety products Hazard Warnings and Road Check, for the real-time base map alongside other Overture data points. With this Dutch innovation, the entire world, throughout the world, can be mapped.\n\n3. Perciv AI – Next-generation AI-assisted radar detection\n\nPerciv AI develops AI software solutions that give radar systems \"LiDAR-like performance”. Such capabilities are important for advanced driver assistance systems (ADAS), for example. Radar is significantly cheaper than LiDAR and very robust in all weather conditions. This next-generation AI-assisted detection for radar systems can therefore greatly increase the potential of advanced driver assistance and autonomous driving systems.\n\nFinalists in category 3: Accessibility\n\n1. TomTom – Orbis Maps, real-time integration of several map layers on an open-source platform\n\nUntil recently, every tech giant created its own “base” map with unique map layers. TomTom is the founder of the Overture platform, where, together with Meta, Microsoft, and Amazon, it provides a single open access base map. Public and private parties can offer their unique map layers through the Overture platform (free or paid). Orbis Maps is TomTom's own map layers offering, which includes safety products Hazard Warnings and Road Check, for the real-time base map alongside other Overture data points. With this Dutch innovation, the entire world, throughout the world, can be mapped.\n\n2. Aon – Mobility insurance: insures driver instead of vehicle\n\nMobility Insurance is an innovative insurance solution for shared mobility, which insures the driver of the rented or shared vehicle rather than the vehicle itself. The growing sharing economy is under pressure from the limited insurability of shared vehicles due to users’ careless treatment of rented vehicles. By linking insurance to an ID or driver's license, the expectation is not only that drivers will exhibit safer driving behavior, but also that costs of use will go down.\n\n3. Dutch Automated Mobility – Elmo, remote-controlled shared car\n\nThe Elmo shared car is a remote-controlled shared car that is delivered straight to your door. Through an app, the renter orders a shared car that then comes to the renter – without a driver. A specially trained and certified remote driver brings the car to the requested starting point. The renter then uses the app to get into the car and can drive away. When the renter is done with the car, it stays behind and is remotely driven to a parking spot (or shared mobility hub).\n\nFinalists in Category 4: Student teams\n\n1. TU Eindhoven (InMotion) – Next Generation Battery Pack, the world’s fastest-charging battery pack\n\nThe Next Generation Battery Pack can recharge in less than 4 minutes and is currently the fastest-charging battery pack in a race car in the world. This makes it possible to recharge the electric car as fast as one would a fuel car. The heat released during the rapid battery charging process is extracted from the pack using cell-level cooling, which individually cools each cell.\n\n2. TU/ecomotive – Eterna, the car with replaceable components that lasts a lifetime\n\nWith Eterna, TU/ecomotive has designed a car that can last a lifetime. The car’s body is made from long-lasting components such as the ladder chassis, batteries, and engine. The shorter-duration exterior components are interchangeable, such as interior fabrics and safety features like digital side mirrors and cruise control. Separating the life cycles of the body and exterior makes the most of both life cycles and reduces emissions in the manufacturing process. The Eterna would be offered via leasing so that consumers can customize their car.\n\n3. TU Eindhoven (Team Polar) – The Ice Cube rover, the affordable, sustainable and autonomous vehicle for research in Antarctica\n\nThe Ice Cube rover is an affordable, sustainable, and autonomous vehicle intended for research in Antarctica. The vehicle has large electric engines, a battery, and solar panels. Its enormous towing capacity allows it to traverse the most difficult terrains. The prototype can withstand low temperatures and makes research more economical, safer, more efficient, and more sustainable, with the motto \"pioneering a zero-emission Antarctica”.\n\nJury in conclave to decide winners\n\n\"We were tremendously inspired by all of the entries this year. Some of the innovations are technically very advanced, while others are super smart and practical. But all of them solve a problem,\" says Jan Peter Balkenende, chair of the independent jury. \"We are once again face-to-face with the fact that the mobility sector in the Netherlands is very innovative. Let's give this very important sector a little more space and attention!\"\n\nThe judges' work is not yet done, as the winners must now be chosen from among the finalists. \"The finalists already represent the crème de la crème of innovative Holland. It will be difficult to pick the winners. But fortunately, we still have some time to make our decision,\" said Balkenende. The award winners will be announced at the exclusive Automotive Innovation Dinner on the evening of Monday, February 5, 2024.\n\nAutomotive Innovation Award Foundation\n\nThis year's prize is being organized for the fifth time by the Automotive Innovation Award Foundation, a joint effort of ANWB, BOVAG, LeasePlan, RAI Association, RAI Automotive Industry NL, and Roland Berger. The foundation aims to highlight the enormous innovation capacity of this sector in the Netherlands."
