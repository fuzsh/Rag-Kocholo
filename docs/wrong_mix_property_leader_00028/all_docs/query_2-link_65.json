        "text": "During a wonderfully inspiring evening full of like-minded spirits, The Future Mobility Network and Dutch Automated Mobility’s remote controlled shared car fell just short of the awards. Together with partner Elmo from Estonia we were nominated for the category ‘Accessibility’ and the overall award. With this application we are trying to revolutionize the shared car application in the Netherlands and get it on public roads.\n\nThe Automotive Innovation Awards were created to give more publicity to the beautiful innovations within the automotive sector. Previously, these were often somewhat underexposed while the Netherlands does play an important role in this area. Every few years the awards are held and important innovators in the automotive industry are put in the spotlight.\n\nAccessibility was an important theme at this year’s awards – and the competition was fierce. However, a six-member jury that included former Prime Minister Jan-Peter Balkenende praised the power of the car to take a big step forward in partial transport in the Netherlands.\n\nWe introduced the car last year at the Vakbeurs Openbare Ruimte and conducted tests at the Future Mobility Park in Rotterdam. Just last week, the car was piloted for the first time from Estonia at the park – 2,100 kilometers away! The Elmo share car is a remote-controlled share car that is driven to the door with ease. Through an app, the renter orders a share car that then comes – without an occupant driver – to the renter. A specially trained and certified remote driver brings the car to the desired starting point. Subsequently, the renter can get in via the app and drive away with the car himself.\n\nDirector Alwin Bakker was disappointed, but emphasized the positive side: “If you are in the finals you want to win, but the nomination was already an honor and a good sign. We were also able to tell our story at BNR earlier today. Every day we do our best to make the impossible possible and it’s fantastic that we are now all taking the next step towards exploiting autonomous and remotely controlled systems. The work does not end here. The next leap is approval for the shared car on public roads in the Netherlands!”"
