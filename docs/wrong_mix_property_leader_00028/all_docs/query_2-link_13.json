        "text": "February 5th 2024, LeydenJar was awarded the sustainability prize during the Automotive Innovation Award (AIA) finals. The CEO of LeydenJar Christian Rood was there to accept the award from AIA jury chairman and former Dutch prime minister Jan Peter Balkenende.\n\n“This prize shows that we are on the right path towards creating maximum impact in the automotive sector. Our anodes will make electric vehicles more affordable by reducing battery weight, and at the same time decrease environmental impact of the battery production process”, says Christian Rood. Jan Peter Balkenende, who presented the awards, praised both the quantity and quality of the innovations submitted. “We show that, as a small country, we make a global impact with our innovations. Therefore, these innovations deserve all the attention!”\n\nLeydenJar earned the award for the company’s contribution to next generation battery technology for electric cars. LeydenJar produces pure silicon anodes for lithium-ion batteries, allowing the battery to have a higher capacity, fast-charging capabilities and a reduced environmental impact! This will help make electric driving more affordable and accessible.\n\nThe Automotive Innovation Award is an initiative by ANWB, BOVAG, LeasePlan, RAI Automotive Industry NL, RAI Vereniging and Roland Berger. The AIA is awarded every two years by the independent Stichting AIA. The AIA puts innovations in the Dutch automotive industry in the spotlight and focuses on challenges such as environmental taxes and sustainable mobility. Organisations in the Dutch automotive industry can submit themselves to the AIA. This year, there was a record number of submissions with a total of 43!"
