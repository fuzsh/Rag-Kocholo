        "text": "What a night! Tuesday evening, Rotterdam was the center of innovation during the Grand Final of the 19th edition of the Philips Innovation Award! Congratulations to SoundCell for winning the Innovator League award with their ingenious antibiotic sensitivity testing method, and to AlphaPace for taking home the Rough Diamond League award for their device accelerating radiopharmaceutical evaluations in cancer treatments. Jury Chairman Roy Jakobs praised the impact that the winners could have on the medical world. The six other startups were remarkably united in their mission to improve the world! If you missed the Grand Final, you can watch the livestream on De Ondernemer, BusinessWise, and our PHIA YouTube channel. A big thank you to: The Jury: Roy Jakobs, Ali Najafbagy, Anke Huiskes, Eline van Beest, Gillian Tans & Pieter Zwart Keynote Speaker: Willemijn Verloop Fireside Chat: Host Lars Crama, guests Michael Musandu & Michiel Muller Host: Han Leenhouts\n\nMeet our fifth and last Innovator Finalist: LAYCO! Since 2020 LAYCO is innovating reusable medical devices. The team, in close collaboration with the TU Delft, hospitals, obstetricians and distributors globally is developing new devices to innovate for sustainability and accessibility. velaÂ®, the reusable vacuum pump is the first product in a promising line of impactful medical devices. The device is used for vacuum extraction, a procedure where a suction cup is placed on the babyâ€™s head, to help the baby come out during prolonged or complicated second stage of labour. Current devices are either not easy to sterilize or not easy to use by one person. velaÂ® solves this problem and can be easily sterilised and operated by a single user, reducing cost by 25%, waste by 98% and CO2 emissions by 40%. Only 2 days left until the Grand Final! Head over to our website www.phia.nl to secure your (free) ticket now!\n\nMeet our third and last Rough Diamond Finalist: AlphaPace! Radiopharmaceuticals, a new cancer treatment using radioactive isotopes (e.g. Actinium-225), shows groundbreaking results in the battle against cancer. The doctors need to make sure the radiopharmaceuticals are safe before injection into the body and this needs to happen fast as the Actinium-225 isotopes decay to daughter particles. This decay process lowers the effectiveness of the treatment while raising the risks for the patient. However, the current solution for quality assurance of the medicine takes around 2 hours as it requires this decay process. This method is called in-direct measuring and leads to a paradox for doctors as they cannot quickly inject the substance into the body without risking the patient's safety. AlphaPace offers the solution to this by directly measuring the quality of the radiopharmaceuticals. This means that they can now perform the analysis of 2 hours in just 20 minutes. Alphapace thereby enables the use of radiopharmaceuticals, to make cancer a safely treatable disease! Only three days left until the Grand Final! Head over to our website www.phia.nl to secure your (free) ticket now!\n\nMeet our fourth Innovator Finalist: Madglove Amsterdam! Madglove Amsterdam pioneers home-based rehabilitation with their innovative orthotic glove. Madgloveâ€™s mission is to provide a low-tech, high-impact solution that enhances daily independence for individuals worldwide facing hand disabilities. With their accessible tool, users can take control of their rehabilitation journey from home, empowering them to reach their full potential. Madglove envisions a world where disability is celebrated as diversity, not a limitation. Their glove not only transforms hands but also lives, fostering newfound independence and confidence. Madglove redefines what it means to live life to its fullest potential, ensuring that everyone has the opportunity to thrive.
