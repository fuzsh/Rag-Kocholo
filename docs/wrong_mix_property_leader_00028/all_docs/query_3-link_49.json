        "text": "The annual edition of the Philips Innovation Award is coming to an end. Our trajectory prepares the contestants to pitch their idea in front of the Dutch captains of industry. The Grand Final, this is what our annual cohort is trained for. Information on the Grand Final below.\n\nTrajectory\n\nThe Philips Innovation Award trajectory started around January with 117 applications in 2022. All these applications were graded and provided with constructive feedback by our business panel (a large group of professionals from all kinds of industries). Every business plan was graded by at least 3 business panel members. 30 of the 117 applications subsequently were selected to participate in our cohort. The trajectory started off with Investor day organised in cooperation with our investor partners. Then, the startups got trained on UX Design, Data Science and marketing to achieve digital excellence during prototype day. The first edition of the Find Your Co-Founder day was organised in cooperation with Graduate Entrepreneur. Some of our startups are still in contact with the students they met during this networking day. Ending this phase of the trajectory, the startups had to show their pitching skills to our Semi-Final jury on the Innovation Market (pictures).\n\nSubsequently, 8 finalists were selected to join the last stage of the trajectory. 3 Rough Diamonds and 5 Innovators (learn more about our awards on this page). These 8 finalists were trained on their pitching skills by Debatrix. Job ten Bosch sat with each finalist to fine tune their pitch and to create a catching story to convince the final jury. The last training day was hosted at the headquarters of our brand-new partner KPN. Every platinum partner and Arnold & Siedsma delivered a coach to brainstorm on the business strategy of the startups. At last, the startups are fully prepared to face our final jury, presidented by Frans van Houten.\n\nGrand final\n\nBoth the startups as our student board have worked hard to make all necessary preparations for the Grand Final. It will be a fantastic evening where the startups will try to convince the jury of their excellence. In between the pitches inspiring speakers will give their opinion on innovation and the importance of entrepreneurship. The show will begin at 19:30. After the first 3 Rough Diamond pitches former prime minister Jan Peter Balkenende will share his opinion on innovation and entrepreneurship. Then, the 5 Innovators will pitch with a short break in between. After these pitches the jury will privately discuss which startups will win (one Innovator and one Rough Diamond). During this consultation Humberto Tan will host a panel discussion with Leonique van Houwelingen, Alexandra Jankovich, Alexander Ribbink and Constantijn van Oranje Nassau until the jury is finished. Finally, Frans van Houten will announce the winners of 2022. We are very curious who the winners of 2022 will be, are you too? Secure yourself of a ticket below. Also, please find more information on the startups at the bottom of this article.\n\nGet your FREE ticket via the following link or visit the show through our Livestream that will be embeded on the following page: www.PHIA.nl/edition/2022.\n\n18.30 – Walk-in\n\n19.30 – Start Grand Final\n\n20:12 – Speech Jan Peter Balkenende\n\n20:41 – Break\n\n21:33 – Jury council / Interview Humberto Tan\n\n22:03 – Ceremony Award\n\n22:15 – Closing Drinks\n\nLocation: Theater Rotterdam Schouwburg (Schouwburgplein 25, 3012 CL Rotterdam)\n\nStartups\n\nInnovators\n\nAuto-Pilot\n\nDue to the diversity and complexity of unstructured documents that need to be processed by companies, automation and saving costs is a challenging task. Auto-Pilot is a platform that lets users apply Artificial Intelligence (Natural Language Processing) techniques to process these unstructured documents such as emails and PDFs more efficiently. We believe that the best results are obtained when humans and machines are efficiently working together. Therefore, Auto-Pilot maintains a user-first approach, where the machine closely follows all the steps that a human normally takes when processing a certain file and gradually takes over more work. We call this Collaborative Intelligence.\n\nHart\n\nHART (Human Augmentation Research and Technology) is a student team from the University of Technology Eindhoven. HART focuses on the research field of human augmentation. As humans, we are limited by our biological boundaries. With human augmentation, we try to look beyond and overcome these limits with technology. We have developed an application that can transform spoken language into a vibrational language. With a sleeve that provides haptic feedback, it is possible to substitute the hearing sense of humans. The goal of HART is to create freedom of experiences and become more than human.\n\nRespyre\n\nRespyre is a TU Delft spin-off focusing on the valorisation of a unique scientific cross- over between material science and biology. We believe a living city is a healthy city. By creating space for nature -in an otherwise barren environment- and integrating self- sustaining vegetation in an efficient, sustainable and functional way, we want to bring cities to life. With bio-receptive concrete and moss facades Respyre empowers cities to breathe! The Philips Innovation Award will help us further develop our technology with the great trainings, network and possibly financing it comes!\n\nSavvy\n\nReady-made household and personal care products are extremely polluting for 2 main reasons: These products often contain lots of water (up to 95%). This water gets transported, unnecessarily emitting large amounts of CO2 emissions. Secondly, these products come in single-use plastic packaging, resulting in a lot of waste. Our reusable cleaning and hand soap bottles can be refilled at home with our effective, eco- friendly tablets and tap water. These products alone save 30 plastic bottles and 10kg of cargo weight per household every year. We will continue adding more extremely concentrated products, increasing our impact further.\n\nVeridis\n\nVeridis develops the first scalable analysis method for plastic recycling. The largest challenges for the plastic recycling industry are material insight and quality control. There are no industrially applicable and affordable methods that can tell recyclers the exact composition and quality of their material. Subsequently, high-quality recycling is only done with ~2% of all plastics. We solve this problem with our patent-pending MADSCAN technology, scaling up the analysis of plastic batches by a factor 100.000 whilst being >99% accurate. By giving the plastic recycling industry exactly the reliable insights it needs, we enable this industry to recycle more, faster & more efficiently, moving towards recycling 2.0.\n\nRough Diamonds\n\nAletta\n\nAt Aletta, we aim to help researchers retain participants during clinical research, by improving participant engagement. Due to participant dropout, it can cost €17K to recruit a new participant and the study delay can cost up to €7 million. Aletta helps researchers save money and time on their studies. We develop an ePro mobile app to collect data remotely from participants. We convert clinical surveys into chatbot conversations. Our AI-chatbot assistant collects data by conversing with the participant and recording the answers provided. Our multidisciplinary team of scientists will develop the first AI-powered conversation for clinical research.\n\nGlimp\n\nGlimp helps you to catch your breath. We improve burn-out recovery, with guided breathwork for home. Habituate mindful breathing with our ‘Pebbles’, through haptic & audio feedback. Through a hand-held device, we bring the breathing therapist\n\nto the client’s home. This will increase therapy compliance, reduce recovery time & therapy costs. Our team is expertised to fully develop the product in-house. Moreover, Glimp is partnering with two different Police departments (Delft & National Police), M91200 (electronics manufacturer) and TodayTomorrow (Software). Our USP: We provide effective (data-driven) assistance at home, while providing mental health insights for both client and therapist.\n\nUnifix Care\n\nMore than two billion people worldwide do not have access to essential surgical care. This is mainly related to a shortage of proper medical equipment in lowand middle-income countries (LMIC) to perform these essential surgeries. In the meantime, thousands of tons of medical equipment are thrown out each year by western hospitals. 4-5% of this is brand-new equipment. Current initiatives to give these supplies new use are based on 1-on-1 relationships. These processes are rather inefficient and still result in the waste of most of the equipment. With Unifix we are coordinating this process through our online platform. We aggregate the supply, connect it to the hospitals in need, and ensure that it is properly used by offering adequate education."
