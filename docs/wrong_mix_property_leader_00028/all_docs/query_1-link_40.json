        "text": "About the DSGC\n\nThe Dutch Sustainable Growth Coalition is formed by eight Dutch internationally operating companies. Led by Jan Peter Balkenende (chairman), the coalition is supported by VNO-NCW and facilitated by Accenture.\n\nThe DSGC aims to accelerate the development and implementation of sustainable business models, thereby increasing its contribution to the achievement of the United Nations' 17 Development Goals (SDGs). The SDGs focus on the enormous challenges facing the world. Climate change, depletion and population growth threaten the survival of humanity. Systemic changes are needed to secure a good life for future generations. DSGC members are investing in those changes. This also ensures the long-term continuity of their business. DSGC members are socially responsible, operate inclusively, strive for responsible production and consumption and climate-neutral business operations throughout the chain."
