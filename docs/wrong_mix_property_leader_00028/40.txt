At the recommendation of the SDM, Prime Minister Jan Peter Balkenende of the Kingdom of the Netherlands was awarded an honorary doctorate from Keio University.

The ceremony took place in the North Hall on the Mita Campus of Keio University, beginning at 9:40, October 27. The festivities started with a chorus sung by the Wagner Society, followed by the entrance of Prime Minister Balkenende.

Associate Professor Tetsuya Toma served as Master of Ceremonies, and the recommendation was read by SDM Dean Yoshiaki Ohkami. Following this, President Seike awarded the degree with a short speech. In response, Prime Minister Balkenende gave a speech entitled "Japan and the Netherlands: Working Together to Address Global Challenges." This was followed by a question-and-answer session with Prime Minister Balkenende for students in the SDM including exchange students from the TU Delft TPM. It was a valuable opportunity for students from both countries.
