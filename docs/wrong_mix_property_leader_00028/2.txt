Jan Peter Balkenende has been appointed Minister of State by Royal Decree on 14 October 2022. Balkenende is Professor of Governance, Institutions and Internationalisation at Erasmus School of Economics and Erasmus School of Law since December 2010. Before that, he was Prime Minister of the Netherlands from 2002-2010. During the four preceding years, he served as chairman of the CDA parliamentary party in the Dutch House of Representatives.

HarriÃ«t Schelhaas, Dean of Erasmus School of Law, and Patrick Groenen, Dean of Erasmus School of Economics, are pleasantly surprised and congratulate Balkenende with this honorable appointment.

Minister of State is an honorary title awarded, in exceptional cases, to politicians or statesmen. The title is formally granted by the Monarch. Ministers of State can be consulted by the King, for example in complicated constitutional matters, with moral authority but without formal competence. It is given on a personal basis and for life.

Current Ministers of State are Hans van den Broek, Frits Korthals Altes, Herman Tjeenk Willink, Sybilla Dekker, Jaap de Hoop Scheffer, Winnie Sorgdrager and Piet Hein Donner.
