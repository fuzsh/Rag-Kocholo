        "text": "On May 10, 2022, the town of Tulsa, Oklahoma, crossed by Route 66, became the Louvre for Bob Dylan fans. On that day, the Bob Dylan Center opened its doors, the third stop on a pilgrimage that includes Hibbing, Minnesota, where the man born Robert Zimmerman in 1941 grew up, and Greenwich Village, the bohemian New York neighborhood from which he rose to fame. Gospel and soul singer Mavis Staples (a childhood sweetheart) and two disciples, Elvis Costello and Patti Smith, attended the center's inauguration. Once again, Dylan lived up to his elusive reputation.\n\nThe Tulsa museum is in good company, just 50 meters from the one dedicated to folksinger Woody Guthrie (1912-1967). The man whose guitar bore the slogan \"This machine kills fascists\" was a hero whom Dylan, then unknown, visited in the hospital on his arrival in New York in 1961. Before selling his copyrights to Universal in 2020, and his recording rights to rival Sony – two transactions estimated at more than $500 million combined – Dylan had already ceded his archives in 2016 to the foundation of billionaire George Kaiser, owner of the Woody Guthrie Center, which decided to open the Bob Dylan Center. On public display for the first time, this collection has not failed to attract Dylan fans and support their favorite activity: interpreting the sphinx's lyrics.\n\nFor, even more than his peers elevated to the rank of poet (Leonard Cohen, Lou Reed, Jim Morrison or Patti Smith), his words, spread over more than 600 songs, are methodically scrutinized, analyzed and interpreted by legions of researchers. Dylanologists examine every word, just as others decode hieroglyphics. \"His refusal to dissect and explain his body of work, or himself, has made Dylan and his work especially enigmatic and open to interpretation,\" explained archivist Parker Fishel, curator of the exhibition at the Bob Dylan Center. \"People continue to write about Dylan because there is no Rosetta Stone.\"\n\nMark Davidson, director of the Bob Dylan Center and the Woody Guthrie Center, noted that the temple of Dylanology has plenty to keep enthusiasts busy. It brings together \"more than 100,000 items spanning Dylan's career, including handwritten manuscripts, notebooks and correspondence; films, videos, photographs and artwork; memorabilia and ephemera; personal documents and effects; unreleased studio and concert recordings; musical instruments; and many other elements.\"\n\nIt differs from other museums dedicated to singers, whose collections often include only guitars and stage outfits, in its literary abundance: \"One can see that Dylan worked on whatever he had at hand, whether it was the massive amount of materials he generated on his typewriter in the mid-1960s or the countless hotel notepads that he used to craft songs from the 1980s onward while he was constantly touring.\""
