        "text": "Actor James Martin was serenaded by the audience at the Academy Awards on his 31st birthday as the film he starred in picked up an Oscar.\n\nNorthern Ireland film An Irish Goodbye won best live action short film at Sunday night's ceremony.\n\nMartin, who has Down's syndrome, said he planned to bring the award home to his drama group in Belfast.\n\nThe film's directors Tom Berkeley and Ross White described the win as the best night of their lives.\n\nThey took to Twitter to thank their supporters in Northern Ireland after a whirlwind 24 hours.\n\nAllow Twitter content?\n\nThis article contains content provided by Twitter .

To view this content choose ‘accept and continue’.\n\n\"We're just so proud to be representing Northern Ireland,\" he told BBC News.\n\n\"To be on that stage in front of all of our cinematic heroes - it was a special moment.\"\n\nActor Paddy Jenkins, who plays Fr O'Shea in the film, told BBC Radio Foyle's Mark Patterson Show that \"you don't get many Mondays like this\".\n\n\"Last night I have to say, was pretty special, it really was,\" he said.\n\nThe actor - well known to a Northern Ireland audience through his role in BBC comedy Give My Head Peace - wasn't in Los Angeles due to prior work commitments.\n\n\"I was there (at the Oscars) in spirit. I got to the Baftas, but this is another level.\"\n\nOther nominations in Sunday's ceremony in the best live action short film category, were Ivalu, Le Pupille, Night Ride and the Red Suitcase.\n\nGuillermo del Toro's Pinocchio, which has a Belfast link, was successful in the best animated feature category.\n\nThe body of the puppet which featured in the animation was constructed by a 3D printing firm in east Belfast.\n\nThe big winner of the night was Everything Everywhere All At Once, which won seven awards.\n\nThere was a record number of nominations for Irish talent, with 14 prizes up for grabs.\n\nMartin McDonagh's tragicomedy, The Banshees of Inisherin was nominated in nine categories but did not take home any statuettes.\n\nColin Farrell lost out in the best actor category, while his co-stars Brendan Gleeson and Barry Keoghan were unsuccessful in the best supporting actor category.\n\nIrish actor Paul Mescal also missed out, as did An Cailín Ciúin (The Quiet Girl).\n\nKerry Condon was also nominated for best supporting actress for her role, but that award went to Jamie Lee Curtis.\n\nSet on a remote island off the west coast of Ireland, The Banshees of Inisherin tells the story of two friends who fall out after one decides to abruptly end their relationship.\n\nAn Cailín Ciúin (The Quiet Girl) was the first Irish language film to be nominated for best international feature film, a category formerly named best foreign language film.\n\nHe said the success was \"a testament to the hard work of so many people over recent decades\"."
