        "text": "American singer-songwriter Bob Dylan was awarded the Nobel Prize in literature Thursday, lauded for creating \"new poetic expressions within the great American song tradition.\"\n\nHere are lyrics from just a few of the hundreds of songs that he has written over his career.\n\n\"Blowin' in the Wind,\" 1962\n\nHow many roads must a man walk down\n\nBefore you call him a man?\n\nYes, 'n' how many seas must a white dove sail\n\nBefore she sleeps in the sand?\n\nYes, 'n' how many times must the cannon balls fly\n\nBefore they're forever banned?\n\nThe answer, my friend, is blowin' in the wind,\n\nThe answer is blowin' in the wind.\n\nFull lyrics here.\n\n\"The Times They Are A-Changin,'\" 1963\n\nCome senators, congressmen\n\nPlease heed the call\n\nDon't stand in the doorway\n\nDon't block up the hall\n\nFor he that gets hurt\n\nWill be he who has stalled\n\nThere's a battle outside\n\nAnd it is ragin'.\n\nIt'll soon shake your windows\n\nAnd rattle your walls\n\nFor the times they are a-changin'.\n\nFull lyrics here.\n\n\"A Hard Rain's A-Gonna Fall,\" 1963\n\nOh, what'll you do now, my blue-eyed son?\n\nOh, what'll you do now, my darling young one?\n\nI'm a-goin' back out 'fore the rain starts a-fallin',\n\nI'll walk to the depths of the deepest black forest,\n\nWhere the people are many and their hands are all empty,\n\nWhere the pellets of poison are flooding their waters,\n\nWhere the home in the valley meets the damp dirty prison,\n\nWhere the executioner's face is always well hidden,\n\nWhere hunger is ugly, where souls are forgotten,\n\nWhere black is the color, where none is the number,\n\nAnd I'll tell it and think it and speak it and breathe it,\n\nAnd reflect it from the mountain so all souls can see it,\n\nThen I'll stand on the ocean until I start sinkin',\n\nBut I'll know my song well before I start singin',\n\nAnd it's a hard, it's a hard, it's a hard, it's a hard,\n\nIt's a hard rain's a-gonna fall.\n\nFull lyrics here.\n\n\"Talking New York,\" 1962\n\nWintertime in New York town,\n\nThe wind blowin' snow around.\n\nWalk around with nowhere to go,\n\nSomebody could freeze right to the bone.\n\nI froze right to the bone.\n\nNew York Times said it was the coldest winter in seventeen years;\n\nI didn't feel so cold then.\n\nFull lyrics here.\n\n\"Chimes of Freedom,\" 1964\n\nFar between sundown's finish an' midnight's broken toll\n\nWe ducked inside the doorway, thunder crashing\n\nAs majestic bells of bolts struck shadows in the sounds\n\nSeeming to be the chimes of freedom flashing\n\nFlashing for the warriors whose strength is not to fight\n\nFlashing for the refugees on the unarmed road of flight\n\nAn' for each an' ev'ry underdog soldier in the night\n\nAn' we gazed upon the chimes of freedom flashing.\n\nFull lyrics here.\n\n\"Subterranean Homesick Blues,\" 1965\n\nMaggie comes fleet foot\n\nFace full of black soot\n\nTalkin' that the heat put\n\nPlants in the bed but\n\nThe phone's tapped anyway\n\nMaggie says that many say\n\nThey must bust in early May\n\nOrders from the D. A.\n\nLook out kid\n\nDon't matter what you did\n\nWalk on your tip toes\n\nDon't try \"No Doz\"\n\nBetter stay away from those\n\nThat carry around a fire hose\n\nKeep a clean nose\n\nWatch the plain clothes\n\nYou don't need a weather man\n\nTo know which way the wind blows.\n\nFull lyrics here.\n\n\"Ballad of a Thin Man,\" 1965\n\nYou raise up your head\n\nAnd you ask, \"Is this where it is?\"\n\nAnd somebody points to you and says\n\n\"It's his\"\n\nAnd you say, \"What's mine?\"\n\nAnd somebody else says, \"Where what is?\"\n\nAnd you say, \"Oh my God\n\nAm I here all alone?\"\n\nBecause something is happening here\n\nBut you don't know what it is\n\nDo you, Mister Jones?\n\nFull lyrics here.\n\n\"Like a Rolling Stone,\" 1965\n\nYou never turned around to see the frowns on the jugglers and the clowns\n\nWhen they all come down and did tricks for you\n\nYou never understood that it ain't no good\n\nYou shouldn't let other people get your kicks for you\n\nYou used to ride on the chrome horse with your diplomat\n\nWho carried on his shoulder a Siamese cat\n\nAin't it hard when you discover that\n\nHe really wasn't where it's at\n\nAfter he took from you everything he could steal.\n\nHow does it feel\n\nHow does it feel\n\nTo be on your own\n\nWith no direction home\n\nLike a complete unknown\n\nLike a rolling stone?\n\nFull lyrics here.\n\n\"Idiot Wind,\" 1974\n\nSomeone's got it in for me, they're planting stories in the press\n\nWhoever it is I wish they'd cut it out but when they will I can only guess.\n\nThey say I shot a man named Gray and took his wife to Italy,\n\nShe inherited a million bucks and when she died it came to me.\n\nI can't help it if I'm lucky.\n\nPeople see me all the time and they just can't remember how to act\n\nTheir minds are filled with big ideas, images and distorted facts.\n\nEven you, yesterday you had to ask me where it was at,\n\nI couldn't believe after all these years, you didn't know me better than that\n\nSweet lady.\n\nIdiot wind, blowing every time you move your mouth,\n\nBlowing down the backroads headin' south.\n\nIdiot wind, blowing every time you move your teeth,\n\nYou're an idiot, babe.\n\nIt's a wonder that you still know how to breathe.\n\nFull lyrics here.\n\n\"Dark Eyes,\" 1985\n\nOh, the gentlemen are talking and the midnight moon is on the riverside,\n\nThey're drinking up and walking and it is time for me to slide.\n\nI live in another world where life and death are memorized,\n\nWhere the earth is strung with lovers' pearls and all I see are dark eyes.\n\nFull lyrics here."
