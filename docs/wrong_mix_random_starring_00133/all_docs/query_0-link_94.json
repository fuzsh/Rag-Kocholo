From beautiful picture books for children as young as two years old, to novels for 8-12 year olds to read by themselves, our book recommendations for kids include something for everyone to enjoy over the summer. 2024 is turning out to be a particularly good year for chapter books for emerging readers; it can be hard to find good books for 5-8 year olds to read for pleasure (as opposed to learning to read), but this year already has a great crop of entertaining easy reads. If you are looking for books for older children, check out our 2024 recommendations for teens here.",

R. Smith, Jon Cannell (consultant)\n\nThis is the sequel to Glow, which made our Best Books for Kids 2023 list and was selected by our Children’s Editor as one of the most Beautiful Science Books for 9-12 year olds.

In this volume the children embark on a quest with a legendary map of the desert outside Jaisalmer in Rajasthan. Their adventure is all the more perilous as they are being chased by a ruthless billionaire treasure hunter. Among the many resources at the villain’s fingertips is the rival newspaper he publishes, which pretends that there is no difference between truth and lies and uses the confusion to stir up hate. Illustrated and with big font, this is an excellent series to thrill newly confident readers.\n\nAges 8-11\n\nRead expert recommendations\n\nMushrooms Know: Wisdom from Our Friends the Fungi\n\nby Kallie George & Sara Gillingham (illustrator)\n\nThe kingdom of fungi is just as important as flora and fauna but much less known, so this introduction for children to mushrooms is very welcome. It contains two stories in parallel. On the one hand it’s a scientific picture book teaching us about the importance of mushrooms in ecosystems. On the other, there are lessons we can learn from mushrooms, such as taking care of our neighbourhood and of ourselves, coping with challenges and staying connected. The eye-catching illustrations in vibrant colour are by an award-winning artist.\n\nAges 4-8\n\nRead expert recommendations\n\nHouses with a Story\n\nby Seiji Yoshida & translated by Jan Mitsuko Cash\n\n🏆 2024 Mildred L.
