        "text": "For many in America, Meet the Beatles! marked their first introduction to the legendary Fab Four — and their lives would be forever altered.\n\nReleased on Jan. 20, 1964 by Capitol Records, the Beatles' second American studio album topped the Billboard 200 within a month and stayed there for 11 weeks — only to be ousted by their next U.S. album release, The Beatles' Second Album.\n\nIt's almost impossible to put into words the impact of Meet the Beatles! on an entire generation of the listening public. But Billy Corgan, of the Smashing Pumpkins, gave it a shot as an early fan of the Beatles in a series of LiveJournal remembrances — in this case, of himself at five years old, in 1972.\n\n\"I am totally overwhelmed by the collective sound of the greatest band ever blasting in mono thru a tin needle into a tiny speaker,\" he wrote. \"I associate this sound forever with electricity, for it sends bolts thru my body and leaves me breathless. I can not stand still as I listen, so I must spin… I spin until I am ready to pass out, and then I spin some more.\"\n\nSo many other artists remember that eureka moment. \"They were doing things nobody was doing. Their chords were outrageous, just outrageous, and their harmonies made it all valid,\" Bob Dylan said of the opening track, \"I Want to Hold Your Hand.\" \"I knew they were pointing the direction of where music had to go.\" Everyone from Ozzy Osbourne to Sting and Questlove agreed.\n\nFrom Meet the Beatles!, the Fabs would have the most astonishing five-or-six-year run in music. And so much of their songwriting and production innovation can be found within its grooves; truly, the world had no idea what it was in for. In celebration of the 60th anniversary of Meet the Beatles!, here's a quick track-by-track breakdown.\n\n\"I Want to Hold Your Hand\"\n\nThe Fabs' first American No. 1 hit may have been about the chastest of romantic gestures. Still, there's nothing heavier than \"I Want to Hold Your Hand,\" because it's clamor and fraternity. That seemingly saccharine package also contained everything they'd ever do in concentrate — hints of the foreboding of \"Ticket to Ride,\" the galactic final chord of \"A Day in the Life,\" and beyond.\n\n\"I Saw Her Standing There\"\n\nA few too many awards show tributes have threatened to do in \"I Saw Her Standing There,\" but they've failed. As the opening shot of their first UK album, Please Please Me, it's perfect, but as the second track on Meet the Beatles!, it just adds to the magnitude. What a one-two punch.\n\n\"This Boy\"\n\nSongwriting-wise, \"This Boy\" drags a little; it becomes a little hazy who \"this boy\" or \"that boy\" are. But it's not only a killer Smokey Robinson rip; John Lennon's double-tracked vocal solo still punches straight through your chest. (Where applicable, go for the 2020s Giles Martin remix, which carries maximum clarity, definition and punch — said solo is incredible in this context.)\n\n\"It Won't Be Long\"\n\nHalf a dozen other songs here have overshadowed \"It Won't Be Long,\" but it's still one of the early Beatles' most ruthless kamikaze missions, an assault of flying \"yeahs\" that knocks you sideways.\n\n\"All I've Got to Do\"\n\nLennon shrugged off \"All I've Got to Do\" as \"trying to do Smokey Robinson again,\" and that's more or less what it is. One interesting detail is the conceit of calling a girlfriend on the phone, which was firmly alien to British youth: \"I have never called a girl on the 'phone in my life!\"he said later in an interview. \"Because 'phones weren't part of the English child's life.\"\n\n\"All My Loving\"\n\n\"All My Loving\" was the first song the Beatles played on the American airwaves: when Lennon was pronounced dead, eyewitnesses attest the song came over the speakers. It's a grim trajectory for this most inventive and charismatic of early Beatles singles, with Lennon's tumbling rhythm guitar spilling the composition forth. (About that unorthodox strumming pattern: it seems easy until you try it. And Lennon did it effortlessly.)\n\n\"Don't Bother Me\"\n\nAs Dreaming the Beatles author Rob Sheffield put it, \"'Don't Bother Me,' his first real song, began the 'George is in a bad mood' phase of his songwriting, which never ended.\" Harrison wouldn't pick up the sitar for another year or two, but the song still carries a vaguely dreamy, exotic air.\n\n\"Little Child\"\n\n\"I'm so sad and lonely/ Baby, take a chance with me.\" For a tortured, creative kid like Corgan, from a rough background — and, likely, a million similar young folks — Lennon's childlike plea must have sounded like salvation.\n\n\"Till There Was You\"\n\nMcCartney's infatuation with the postwar sounds of his youth never ended, and it arguably began on record with this Music Man tune. As usual, McCartney dances right on the edge of overly chipper and apple-cheeked. But here, George Martin's immersive, soft-focused arrangement makes it all work.\n\n\"Hold Me Tight\"\n\nLike \"Little Child,\" \"Hold Me Tight\" is a tad Fabs-by-numbers, showing how they occasionally painted themselves into a corner as per their formula. Their rapid evolution from here would leave trifles like \"Hold Me Tight\" in the rearview.\n\n\"I Wanna Be Your Man\"\n\nTellingly, Lennon and McCartney tossed this half-written composition to the Stones — and to Ringo Starr. Mick Jagger's typically lusty performance works, but Starr's is even better — the funny-nosed drummer throws his whole chest into this vocal workout.\n\n\"Not A Second Time\"\n\nMeet the Beatles! concludes with this likable Lennon tune about heartbreak — maybe C-tier by his standards, but it slouches toward his evolutionary step that would be A Hard Day's Night.\n\nSoon, these puppy-dog emotions (\"And now you've changed your mind/ I see no reason to change mine/ I cry\") would curdle and ferment in astonishing ways — in \"Ticket to Ride,\" in \"Girl,\" in \"Strawberry Fields Forever.\" And it all began with Meet the Beatles! — a shot heard around the world.\n\n1962 Was The Final Year We Didn't Know The Beatles. What Kind Of World Did They Land In?\n\nAs the train of Beatles remixes and expansions — solo or otherwise — chugs along, a fair question might come to mind: why John Lennon's Mind Games, and why now?\n\nWhen you consider some agreed-upon classics — George Harrison's Living in the Material World, Ringo Starr's Ringo — it might seem like it skipped the line. Historically, fans and critics have rarely made much of Mind Games, mostly viewing it as an album-length shell for its totemic title track.\n\nThe 2020 best-of Lennon compilation Gimme Some Truth: The Ultimate Mixes featured \"Mind Games,\" \"Out the Blue,\" and \"I Know (I Know),\" which is about right — even in fanatical Lennon circles, few other Mind Games tracks get much shine. It's hard to imagine anyone reaching for it instead of Plastic Ono Band, or Imagine, or even the controversial, semi-outrageous Some Time in New York City.\n\nGranted, these largely aren't A-tier Lennon songs — but still, the album's tepid reputation has little to do with the material. The original Mind Games mix is, to put it charitably, muddy — partly due to Lennon's insecurity about his voice, partly just due to that era of recordmaking.\n\nThe fourth-best Picasso is obviously still worth viewing. But not with an inch of grime on your glasses.\n\nThe Standard Deluxe Edition. Photo courtesy of Universal Music Group\n\nThat's all changed with Mind Games: The Ultimate Collection — a fairly gobsmacking makeover of the original album, out July 12. Turns out giving it this treatment was an excellent, long-overdue idea — and producer Sean Ono Lennon, remixers Rob Stevens, Sam Gannon and Paul Hicks were the best men for the job. Outtakes and deconstructed \"Elemental\" and \"Elements\" mixes round out the boxed set.\n\nIt's not that Mind Games: The Ultimate Collection reveals some sort of masterpiece. The album's still uneven; it was bashed out at New York's Record Plant in a week, and it shows. But that's been revealed to not be its downfall, but its intrinsic charm. As you sift through the expanded collection, consider these reasons you should give Mind Games another shot.\n\nThe Songs Are Better Than You Remember\n\nWill deep cuts like \"Intuition\" or \"Meat City\" necessarily make your summer playlist? Your mileage may vary. However, a solid handful of songs you may have written off due to murky sonics are excellent Lennon.\n\nWith a proper mix, \"Aisumasen (I'm Sorry)\" absolutely soars — it's Lennon's slow-burning, Smokey Robinson-style mea culpa to Yoko Ono. \"Bring On the Lucie (Freda Peeple)\" has a rickety, communal \"Give Peace a Chance\" energy — and in some ways, it's a stronger song than that pacifist classic.\n\nAnd on side 2, the mellow, ruminative \"I Know (I Know)\" and \"You Are Here\" sparkle — especially the almost Mazzy Star-like latter tune, with pedal steel guitarist \"Sneaky\" Pete Kleinow (of Flying Burrito Brothers fame) providing abundant atmosphere.\n\nAnd, of course, the agreed-upon cuts are even better: \"Mind Games\" sounds more celestial than ever. And the gorgeous, cathartic \"Out the Blue\" — led by David Spinozza's classical-style playing, with his old pal Paul McCartney rubbing off on the melody — could and should lead any best-of list.\n\nThe Performances Are Killer\n\nPart of the fun of Mind Games: The Ultimate Collection is realizing how great its performances are. They're not simply studio wrapping paper; they capture 1970s New York's finest session cats at full tilt.\n\nThose were: Kleinow, Spinozza, keyboardist Ken Ascher, bassist Gordon Edwards, drummer Jim Keltner (sometimes along with Rick Marotta), saxophonist Michael Brecker, and backing vocalists Something Different.\n\nAll are blue-chip; the hand-in-glove rhythm section of Edwards and Keltner is especially captivating. (Just listen to Edwards' spectacular use of silence, as he funkily weaves through that title track.)\n\nThe hardcover book included in Mind Games: The Ultimate Collection is replete with the musicians' fly-on-the-wall stories from that week at the Record Plant.\n\n\"You can hear how much we're all enjoying playing together in those mixes,\" Keltner says in the book, praising Spinozza and Gordon. \"If you're hearing John Lennon's voice in your headphones and the great Kenny Ascher playing John's chords on the keys, there's just no question of where you're going and how you're going to get there.\"\n\nIt Captures A Fascinating Moment In Time\n\n\"Mind Games to me was like an interim record between being a manic political lunatic to back to being a musician again,\" Lennon stated, according to the book. \"It's a political album or an introspective album. Someone told me it was like Imagine with balls, which I liked a lot.\"\n\nThis creative transition reflects the upheaval in Lennon's life at the time. He no longer had Phil Spector to produce; Mind Games was his first self-production. He was struggling to stay in the country, while Nixon wanted him and his message firmly out.\n\nPlus, Lennon recorded it a few months before his 18-month separation from Ono began — the mythologized \"Lost Weekend\" that was actually a creatively flourishing time. All of this gives the exhaustive Mind Games: The Ultimate Collection historical weight, on top of listening pleasure.\n\n\"[It's important to] get as complete a revealing of it as possible,\" Stevens, who handled the Raw Studio Mixes, tells GRAMMY.com. \"Because nobody's going to be able to do it in 30 years.\"\n\nJohn Lennon and Yoko Ono in Central Park, 1973. Photo: Bob Gruen\n\nMoments Of Inspired Weirdness Abound\n\nFour seconds of silence titled the \"Nutopian International Anthem.\" A messy slab of blues rock with refrains of \"Fingerlickin', chicken-pickin'\" and \"Chickin-suckin', mother-truckin'.\" The country-fried \"Tight A$,\" basically one long double entendre.\n\nTo put it simply, you can't find such heavy concentrates of Lennonesque nuttiness on more commercial works like Imagine. Sometimes the outliers get under your skin just the same.\n\nRead more: We've Thrown Everything We Could At John Lennon's \"Imagine.\" The Song Nonetheless Endures 50 Years Later.\n\nIt's Never Sounded Better\n\n\"It's a little harsh, a little compressed,\" Stevens says of the original 1973 mix. \"The sound's a little bit off-putting, so maybe you dismiss listening to it, in a different head. Which is why the record might not have gotten its due back then.\"\n\nAs such, in 2024 it's revelatory to hear Edwards' basslines so plump, Keltner's kick so defined, Ascher's lines so crystalline. When Spinozza rips into that \"Aisumasen\" solo, it absolutely penetrates. And, as always with these Lennon remixes, the man's voice is prioritized, and placed front and center. It doesn't dispose of the effects Lennon insecurely desired; it clarifies them.\n\n\"I get so enthusiastic,\" Ascher says about listening to Mind Games: The Ultimate Collection. \"I say, 'Well, that could have been a hit. This could have been a hit. No, this one could have been a hit, this one.\" Yes is the answer.\n\nThroughout his ongoing Got Back tour, Paul McCartney has reliably opened with \"Can't Buy Me Love.\"\n\nIt's not the Beatles' deepest song, nor their most beloved hit — though a hit it was. But its zippy, rollicking exuberance still shines brightly; like the rest of the oldies on his setlist, the 82-year-old launches into it in its original key. For two minutes and change, we're plunged back into 1964 — and all the humor, melody, friendship and fun the Beatles bestowed with A Hard Day's Night.\n\nThis week in 1964 — at the zenith of Beatlemania, after their seismic appearance on \"The Ed Sullivan Show\" — the planet received Richard Lester's silly, surreal and innovative film of that name. Days after, its classic soundtrack dropped — a volley of uber-catchy bangers and philosophical ballads, and the only Beatles LP to solely feature Lennon-McCartney songs.\n\nAs with almost everything Beatles, the impact of the film and album have been etched in stone. But considering the breadth of pop culture history in its wake, Fab disciples can always use a reminder. Here are six things that wouldn't be the same without A Hard Day's Night.\n\nAll Music Videos, Forever\n\nRight from that starting gun of an opening chord, A Hard Day's Night's camerawork alone — black and white, inspired by French New Wave and British kitchen sink dramas — pioneers everything from British spy thrillers to \"The Monkees.\"\n\nAcross the film's 87 minutes, you're viscerally dragged into the action; you tumble through the cityscapes right along with John, Paul, George, and Ringo. Not to mention the entire music video revolution; techniques we think of as stock were brand-new here.\n\nAccording to Roger Ebert: \"Today when we watch TV and see quick cutting, hand-held cameras, interviews conducted on the run with moving targets, quickly intercut snatches of dialogue, music under documentary action and all the other trademarks of the modern style, we are looking at the children of A Hard Day's Night.\"\n\nEmergent Folk-Rock\n\nGeorge Harrison's 12-string Rickenbacker didn't just lend itself to a jangly undercurrent on the A Hard Day's Night songs; the shots of Harrison playing it galvanized Roger McGuinn to pick up the futuristic instrument — and via the Byrds, give the folk canon a welcome jolt of electricity.\n\nEntire reams of alternative rock, post-punk, power pop, indie rock, and more would follow — and if any of those mean anything to you, partly thank Lester for casting a spotlight on that Rick.\n\nRead more: Living Legends: Roger McGuinn On The History Of The Byrds, His One-Man Show And Editing His Own Wikipedia Page\n\nThe Ultimate Love Triangle Jam\n\nFrom the Byrds' \"Triad\" to Leonard Cohen's \"Famous Blue Raincoat,\" music history is replete with odes to love triangles.\n\nBut none are as desperate, as mannish, as garment-rending, as Derek and the Dominoes' \"Layla,\" where Eric Clapton lays bare his affections for his friend Harrison's wife, Pattie Boyd. Where did Harrison meet her? Why, on the set of A Hard Day's Night, where she was cast as a schoolgirl.\n\nDebates, Debates, Debates\n\nSay, what is that famous, clamorous opening chord of A Hard Day's Night's title track? Turns out YouTube's still trying to suss that one out.\n\n\"It is F with a G on top, but you'll have to ask Paul about the bass note to get the proper story,\" Harrison told an online chat in 2001 — the last year of his life.\n\nA Certain Strain Of Loopy Humor\n\nNo wonder Harrison got in with Monty Python later in life: the effortlessly witty lads were born to play these roles — mostly a tumble of non sequiturs, one-liners and daffy retorts. (They were all brought up on the Goons, after all.) When A Hard Day's Night codified their Liverpudlian slant on everything, everyone from the Pythons to Tim and Eric received their blueprint.\n\nThe Legitimacy Of The Rock Flick\n\nWhat did rock 'n' roll contribute to the film canon before the Beatles? A stream of lightweight Elvis flicks? Granted, the Beatles would churn out a few headscratchers in its wake — Magical Mystery Tour, anyone? — but A Hard Day's Night remains a game-changer for guitar boys on screen.\n\nThe best part? The Beatles would go on to change the game again, and again, and again, in so many ways. Don't say they didn't warn you — as you revisit the iconic A Hard Day's Night.\n\nExplore The World Of The Beatles\n\nWhether it be \"Band on the Run\" or \"Jet\" or \"My Love,\" chances are you've heard a Wings song at least once — in all their polished, '70s-arena-sized glory. More than four decades after they disbanded in 1981, we're getting a helping of raw, uncut Wings.\n\nLast February, Wings' classic 1973 album Band on the Run got the 50th anniversary treatment, with a disc of \"underdubbed\" remixes, allowing Paul McCartney, spouse and keyboardist Linda McCartney, and guitarist Denny Laine to be heard stripped back, with added clarity.\n\nAfter a few months to digest that, it was time to reveal a session that, for ages, fans had been clamoring for. On June 14, in came One Hand Clapping, a live-in-the-studio set from August 1974 that captured Wings at the zenith of their powers.\n\nBack then, Wings had the wind in their sails, with a reconstituted lineup Band on the Run at the top of the charts. They opted to plug in at Abbey Road Studios with cameras rolling, and record a live studio album with an attendant documentary. The film wouldn’t come out until a 2010 reissue of Band on the Run; the music’s popped up on bootlegs, but had never been released in full.\n\nThat long absence is a shame; while One Hand Clapping is a bit of a historical footnote, it absolutely rips; Giles Martin shining up the mixes certainly helped. Epochal Macca ballads, like \"Maybe I'm Amazed\" and \"Blackbird,\" are well represented, but when Wings rock out, as on \"Jet,\" \"Nineteen Hundred and Eighty Five,\" and \"deep cut \"Soily,\" they tear the roof off.\n\nBasically, in range and sequencing, One Hand Clapping shows McCartney prepping Wings like a rocket; soon, it'd rip through the live circuit. If you've never taken a spin through McCartney's post-Fabs discography, though, you may not know where to go from here.\n\nSo, for neophytes (or just fans wanting a refresher), here's a framework through which to sift through the Wings discography — with One Hand Clapping still ringing in your ears.\n\nThe Essentials\n\nRemember, as you get into Wings: don't cordon off their catalog from McCartney's solo work as a whole. In other words: if you haven't heard masterpieces like 1971's Ram yet, don't go scrounging through Back to the Egg deep cuts yet: check all that stuff out, then return to this list.\n\nThat being established: the proper Wings entryway is almost unquestionably Band on the Run. Like Sgt. Pepper's and Abbey Road before it, it's an exhilarating melodic and stylistic rush, a sonic adventure — whether you go for the original or the \"underdubbed\" version.\n\nIn the grand scheme of solo Beatles, Band on the Run is also the one McCartney album that slugs it out with John Lennon's Plastic Ono Band and George Harrison's All Things Must Pass, in terms of artistic realization.\n\nThat being said: despite slightly inferior contemporaneous reviews, its follow-up, 1975's Venus and Mars, is almost as good — and if grandiosity isn't your bag, you might actually enjoy it more than Band on the Run. (Think of Harrison following up All Things with the sparser, more spacious Living in the Material World, and you'll get the picture.)\n\nBetween those two albums, you've got a wealth of indispensable Macca songs — \"Jet,\" \"Let Me Roll It,\" \"Nineteen Hundred and Eighty Five,\" \"Rock Show,\" \"You Gave Me the Answer\" — as well as satisfying deep cuts, like doomed Wingsman Jimmy McCulloch's \"Medicine Jar.\"\n\nFrom there, it's time to understand Weird Wings — which rewinds the clock to their beginnings.\n\nThe Weirdness\n\nAs the McCartney canon goes, Ram's stock seems to shoot up every year, single handedly inspiring new generations of psych-pop weirdos. By comparison, Wings' debut, Wild Life, was critically savaged in 1971, and its reputation isn't much better today.\n\nAs you'll learn so often in your solo Macca voyage — you've just got to ignore the critics sometimes. Even McCartney himself said \"Bip Bop\" \"just goes nowhere\" and \"I cringe every time I hear it.\" What he leaves out it's a maddening earworm — to hear this loony, circuitous little sketch once is to carry it to your deathbed.\n\nIndeed, Wild Life is full of moments that will stick with you. In the title track, McCartney screams about the zoo like his hair's on fire; \"I Am Your Singer\" is a swaying dialogue between Paul and Linda; \"Dear Friend\" is one of McCartney's most moving songs about Lennon.\n\nWild Life's follow-up, Red Rose Speedway, is a little more candy-coated and commercial — but outside of the polarizing hit \"My Love,\" it has some integral McCartney tunes, like \"Little Lamb Dragonfly\" and \"Single Pigeon.\"\n\nIn the end, though, Wild Life is arguably the early Wings offering that will really stick to your ribs. It's not a crummy follow-up to Ram, but an intriguing off-ramp from its harebrained universe — and as the opening statement from McCartney's post-Beatles vehicle, worth investigating just on that merit.\n\nThe Deep Cuts\n\nMcCartney has always been a hit-or-miss solo artist by design — digging through the half-written pastiches and questionable experiments is part of the deal.\n\n1976's Wings at the Speed of Sound features a key track in the irrepressibly jaunty \"Let 'Em In,\" and an (in)famous disco-spangled hit in \"Silly Love Songs.\" From there, with tunes like \"Cook of the House\" and \"Warm and Beautiful,\" your mileage may vary wildly.\n\nThe ratio holds for 1978's London Town: you could put the gorgeous \"I'm Carrying\" on your playlist and scrap the rest, or you can go spelunking. And McCartney being McCartney, despite 1979's Back to the Egg being choppy waters, he nailed it at least once — on the lithe, sophisticated, Stevie Wonder-like \"Arrow Through Me.\"\n\nToday, at 81, McCartney is an 18-time GRAMMY winner and an enormous concert draw — charging through his six-decade catalog in stadiums the world over. These albums only comprise one decade in his history, where he flourished as a mulleted stadium act alongside his keyboarding wife. But his catalog would be so much different if he never got his Wings.\n\n5 Lesser Known Facts About The Beatles' Let It Be Era: Watch The Restored 1970 Film\n\nIt may seem like there's little sand left to sift through, but a new Disney+ documentary proves that there is an endless summer's worth of Beach Boys stories to uncover.\n\nWhile the legendary group is so woven into the fabric of American culture that it’s easy to forget just how innovative they were, a recently-released documentary aims to remind. The Beach Boys uses a deft combination of archival footage and contemporary interviews to introduce a new generation of fans to the band.\n\nThe documentary focuses narrowly on the first 15 years of the Beach Boys’ career, and emphasizes what a family affair it was. Opening the film is a flurry of comments about \"a certain family blend\" of voices, comparing the band to \"a fellowship,\" and crediting the band’s success directly to having been a family. The frame is apt, considering that the first lineup consisted of Wilson brothers Brian, Dennis, and Carl, their cousin Mike Love, and high school friend Al Jardine, and their first manager was the Wilsons’ father, Murry.\n\nAll surviving band members are interviewed, though a very frail Brian Wilson — who was placed under a conservatorship following the January death of his wife Melinda — appears primarily in archival footage. Additional perspective comes via musicians and producers including Ryan Tedder, Janelle Monáe, Lindsey Buckingham, and Don Was, and USC Vice Provost for the Arts Josh Kun.\n\nThanks to the film’s tight focus and breadth of interviewees, it includes memorable takeaways for both longtime fans and ones this documentary will create. Read on for five takeaways from Disney+'s The Beach Boys.\n\nFamily Is A Double-Edged Sword\n\nFor all the warm, tight-knit imagery of the Beach Boys as a family band, there was an awful lot of darkness at the heart of their sunny sound, and most of the responsibility for that lies with Wilson family patriarch Murry Wilson. Having written a few modest hits in the late 1930s, Murry had talent and a good ear, and he considered himself a largely thwarted genius.\n\nWhen Brian, Dennis, and Carl formed the Beach Boys with their cousin Mike Love and friend Al Jardine, Murry came aboard as the band’s manager. In many respects, he was capable; his dogged work ethic and fierce protectiveness helped shepherd the group to increasingly high profile successes. He masterminded the extended Wilson family call-in campaign to a local radio station, pushing the Beach Boys’ first single \"Surfin’\" to become the most popular song in Los Angeles. He relentlessly shopped their demos to music labels, eventually landing them a contract at Capitol Records. He supported the band’s strong preference to record at Western Recordings rather than Capitol Records’ own in-house studio, and was an excellent promoter.\n\nMurry Wilson was also extremely controlling, fining the band when they made mistakes or swore, and \"was miserable most of the time,\" according to his wife Audree.\n\nFootage from earlier interviews with Carl and Dennis, and contemporary comments from Mike Love make it clear that Murry was emotionally and physically abusive to his sons throughout their childhoods. He even sold off the Beach Boys’ songwriting catalog without consulting co-owner Brian, a moment that Brian’s ex-wife Marilyn says he felt so keenly that he took to his bed and didn’t get up for three days.\n\nMurry Wilson was at best a very complicated figure, both professionally jealous of his own children to a toxic degree and devoted to ensuring their success.\n\n\"Be My Baby\" and The Wrecking Crew Changed Brian Wilson’s Life\n\n\"Be My Baby,\" which Phil Spector had produced for the Ronettes in 1963, launched the girl group to immediate iconic status. The song also proved life-changing for Brian. On first hearing the song, \"it spoke to my soul,\" and Brian threw himself into learning how Spector created his massive, lush Wall of Sound. Spector’s approach taught Brian that production was a meaningful art that creates an \"overall sound, what [the listeners] are going to hear and experience in two and a half minutes.\"\n\nRead more: How Brian Wilson Crafted The Beach Boys' Early Sound: A Symphony Of Inspirations, From Boogie-Woogie To Barbershop\n\nBy working with The Wrecking Crew — a truly motley bunch of experienced, freewheeling musicians who played on Spector’s records and were over a decade older than the Beach Boys — Brian’s artistic sensibility quickly emerged. According to drummer Hal Blaine and bassist Carol Kaye, Brian not knowing what he didn’t know gave him the freedom and imagination to create sounds that were completely new and innovative.\n\nFriendly Rivalries With Phil Spector & The Beatles Yielded Amazing Pop Music\n\nAccording to popular myth, the Beach Boys and the Beatles saw each other exclusively as almost bitter rivals for the ears, hearts, and disposable income of their fans. The truth is more nuanced: after the initial shock of the British Invasion wore off, the two groups developed and maintained a very productive, admiration-based competition, each band pushing the other to sonic greatness.\n\nCultural historian and academic Josh Kun reframes the relationship between the two bands as a \"transatlantic collaboration,\" and asks, \"If they hadn’t had each other, would they have become what they became?\" Could they have made the historic musical leaps that we now take for granted?\n\nRead more: 10 Memorable Oddities By The Beach Boys: Songs About Root Beer, Raising Babies & Ecological Collapse\n\nThe release of Rubber Soul left Brian Wilson thunderstruck. The unexpected sitar on \"Norwegian Wood,\" the increasingly mature, personal songwriting, all of it was so fresh that \"I flipped!\" and immediately wanted to record \"a thematic album, a collection of folk songs.\"\n\nBrian found life on the road soul-crushing and terrifying, and was much more content to stay home composing, writing, and producing. With the touring band out on the road, and with a creative fire lit under him by both the Beatles and Phil Spector’s Wall of Sound, he had time to develop into a wildly creative, exacting, and celebrated producer, an experience that yielded the 1966 masterpiece, Pet Sounds.\n\nPet Sounds Took 44 Years To Go Platinum\n\nYou read that right: Pet Sounds was a flop in the U.S. upon its release. Even after hearing radio-ready tracks like \"Wouldn’t It Be Nice?\" and \"Sloop John B\" and the ravishing \"God Only Knows,\" Capitol Records thought the album had minimal commercial potential and didn’t give it the promotional push the band were expecting. Fans in the United Kingdom embraced it, however, and the votes of confidence from British fans — including Keith Moon, John Lennon, and Paul McCartney — buoyed both sales and the Beach Boys’ spirits.\n\nIn fact, Lennon and McCartney credited Pet Sounds with giving them a target to hit when they went into the studio to record the Beatles’ own next sonically groundbreaking album, Sgt. Pepper’s Lonely Hearts Club Band. As veteran producer and documentary talking head Don Was puts it, Brian Wilson was a true pioneer, incorporating \"textures nobody had ever put into pop music before.\" The friendly rivalry continued as the Beatles realized that they needed to step up their game once more.\n\nRead more: Masterful Remixer Giles Martin On The Beach Boys' 'Pet Sounds,' The Beatles, Paul McCartney\n\nMeanwhile, Capitol Records released and vigorously promoted a best-of album full of the Beach Boys’ early hits, Best Of The Beach Boys. The collection of sun-drenched, peppy tunes was a hit, but was also very out of step with the cultural and political shifts bubbling up through the anti-war and civil rights movements of the era. Thanks in part to later critical re-appraisals and being publicly embraced by musicians as varied as Questlove and Stereolab, Pet Sounds eventually reached platinum status in April 2000, 44 years after its initial release.\n\nDennis Wilson Was The Only Truly Beachy Beach Boy\n\nAlthough the Beach Boys first made a name for themselves as purveyors of \"the California sound\" by singing almost exclusively about beaches, girls, and surfing, the only member of the band who really liked the beach was drummer Dennis Wilson.\n\nAl Jardine ruefully recalls that \"the first thing I did was lose my board — I nearly drowned\" on a gorgeous day at Manhattan beach. Dennis was an actual surfer whose tanned, blonde good looks and slightly rebellious edge made him the instant sex symbol of the group. In 1967, when Brian’s depression was the deepest and he relinquished in-studio control of the band, Dennis flourished musically and lyrically. Carl Wilson, who had emerged as a very capable producer in Brian’s absence, described Dennis as evolving artistically \"really quite amazingly…it just blew us away.\"\n\nDennis was also the only Beach Boy who participated meaningfully in the counterculture of the late 1960s, a movement the band largely sat out of, largely to the detriment of their image. He introduced the band to Transcendental Meditation — a practice Mike Love maintains to this day — and was a figure in the Sunset Strip and Laurel Canyon music scenes. Unfortunately, he also became acquainted with and introduced his bandmates to Charles Manson. Manson’s true goal was rock stardom; masterminding the gruesome mass murders that his followers perpetrated in 1969 was a vengeful outgrowth of his thwarted ambition.\n\nThe Beach Boys did record and release a reworked version of one of Manson’s songs, \"Never Learn Not To Love\" as a B-side in 1968. Love says that having introduced Manson to producer Terry Melcher, who firmly rebuffed the would-be musician, \"weighed on Dennis pretty heavily,\" and while Jardine emphatically and truthfully says \"it wasn’t his fault,\" it’s easy to imagine those events driving some of the self-destructive alcohol and drug abuse that marked Dennis’ later years.\n\nThe Journey From Obscurity To Perennially Popular Heritage Act\n\nThe final minutes of The Beach Boys can be summed up as \"if all else fails commercially, release a double album of beloved greatest hits.\" The 1970s were a very fruitful time for the band creatively, as they invited funk specialists Blondie Chaplin and Ricky Fataar to join the band and relocated to the Netherlands to pursue a harder, more far-out sound. Although the band were proud of the lush, singer/songwriter material they were recording, the albums of this era were sales disappointments and represented a continuing slide into uncoolness and obscurity.\n\nRead more: Brian Wilson Is A Once-In-A-Lifetime Creative Genius. But The Beach Boys Are More Than Just Him.\n\nOnce again, Capitol Records turned to the band’s early material to boost sales. The 1974 double-album compilation Endless Summer, comprised of hits from 1962-1965, went triple platinum, relaunching The Beach Boys as a successful heritage touring act. A new generation of fans — \"8 to 80,\" as the band put it — flocked to their bright harmonies and upbeat tempos, as seen in the final moments of the documentary when the Beach Boys played to a crowd of over 500,000 fans on July 4, 1980.\n\nWhile taking their place as America’s Band didn’t do much to make them cool, it did ensure one more wave of chart success with 1988’s No. 1 hit \"Kokomo\" and ultimately led to broader appreciation for Pet Sounds and its sibling experimental albums like Smiley Smile. That wave of popularity has proven remarkably durable; after all, they’ve ridden it to a documentary for Disney+ nearly 45 years later.\n\nListen: 50 Essential Songs By The Beach Boys Ahead Of \"A GRAMMY Salute\" To America's Band"
