        "text": "Coinciding with the release of John Lennon 'Mind Games – The Ultimate Collection' and Citizen of Nutopia website launch, the John Lennon Estate and Hard Rock will be celebrating incredible artifacts from his work on display at Hard Rock locations around the world, empowering visitors to learn about his collaborative music-making process with The Beatles & solo, peace-making ideals, and so much more\n\nHOLLYWOOD, Fla., July 16, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- In honor of the release of John Lennon's Mind Games – The Ultimate Collection', Hard Rock International is proud to kick off the John Lennon Memorabilia Treasure Hunt alongside the John Lennon Estate and UMe, the global catalog division of Universal Music Group, for fans around the world.\n\nHard Rock owns the world's largest and most valuable collection of authentic music memorabilia with more than 88,000 pieces displayed at its locations around the globe. Memorabilia highlights to discover through the John Lennon Memorabilia Treasure Hunt include clothing, instruments, sketches, lyrics and more at various Hard Rock locations.\n\n\"Preserving music history is what enriches the Hard Rock travel, dining and gaming experience. We are honored to display priceless pieces from John Lennon's musical and inspirational legacy,\" said Giovanni Taliaferro, Vice President of Memorabilia and Design at Hard Rock International. \"We have the utmost gratitude to the John Lennon Estate and Universal Music Group for inviting us to participate in this amazing venture. We hope that by learning from Hard Rock's memorabilia collection, John's biggest fans can imagine how his artistry and ideals still endure today.\"\n\nThe treasure hunt launch aligns with John & Yoko's new social website citizenofnutopia.com, a map of the world, where fans can sign up, leave peaceful messages, enjoy \"Meditation Affirmations\" and express their gratitude and admiration for John & Yoko and their core principles of Peace, Love and Truth. Nutopia is an imaginary country created by John Lennon & Yoko Ono in 1973, promoting the ideas of Peace and Love made famous by John's songs 'Imagine' and 'Mind Games'.\n\nThe John Lennon Memorabilia Treasure Hunt serves to celebrate the release of 'Mind Games – The Ultimate Collection' sets. The definitive Ultimate Collection puts listeners in the center of the studio and explores the album's 1973 recording sessions at the Record Plant in New York City, from inception to the final master, through scores of unreleased outtakes, unadulterated versions, instrumentals, stripped down mixes, studio chatter and more, revealing how fan-favorite songs evolved and came to life.\n\nSean Ono Lennon says, \"We've been working on the box sets of Mind Games for years now. Initially I thought, 'Mind Games'.. game... What if we 'gamified' Mind Games? So that's all I'll say for now, but there are many levels to this release, including the box sets and far beyond - that will slowly unravel - and I hope will potentially entertain and engage everyone for many years to come. I hope you enjoy these Mind Games with Hard Rock and as my Mom says in the intro to the book, let's see how we can make a positive future with it - to play a positive mind game with one another.\"\n\nCitizens of Nutopia can earn points and rewards in the Unity by Hard Rock global loyalty program when they visit participating Hard Rock Cafes, Casinos and Hotels to discover precious John Lennon memorabilia tagged with QR codes that when scanned, provide more stories about the artifacts and points on the website.

The Out-Takes allow listeners to hear compelling different takes of each song while the Elemental Mixes, a new set created especially for the Mind Games – Ultimate Collection, inhabit a world between the minimalism of the Elements Mixes and the Ultimate Mixes, stripping the songs back to simpler, lean-back arrangements with John's voice to the fore, and without drums. An array of listening options, including High-Definition, studio quality 192kHz/24bit audio in stereo and enveloping 5.1 Surround and Dolby Atmos mixes, are available on Blu-ray.\n\nAll of the tracks have been completely remixed from scratch from the 15 original two-inch multitrack session tapes using brand new 192-24 digital transfers. The Ultimate Collection includes previously unreleased out-takes and stems plus additional never-heard-before audio from archive ¼\" reel-to-reels, cassettes, and videotapes.\n\nTruly a work of art and in a class of its own, the Super Deluxe Edition box set is, in essence, a time capsule into John and Yoko's world around the writing and recording of Mind Games, including the times leading up to and after its release in 1973. As innovative as it is elaborate, the Super Deluxe is presented in a 13-inch cube, a perspex reproduction of Yoko's 1966 artwork \"Danger Box.\" Once lifted, four sides, featuring artwork from Mind Games on shiny Mirror Board, fall to reveal nine individual boxes of various shapes and sizes interlocked together, each with its own look and focus. Hidden throughout the comprehensive and creative set are many Easter Eggs, some of which can only be revealed by using other items in the box to see them, along with loads of other hidden secrets, surprises, puzzles, and \"mind games\". The box is housed inside a striking 13\" packing container cube adorned with custom art.\n\nAmong many of the unique elements included in the Super Deluxe Edition is a limited edition, 12-inch circular canvas reproduction of John's artwork, You Are Here, 1968, with a Certificate of Authenticity, as well as a replica \"You Are Here\" badge.\n\nFor more information about all the Mind Games – The Ultimate Collection formats available or to pre-order, visit:https://johnlennon.lnk.to/MindGames50PR\n\nAbout John Lennon:\n\nJohn Lennon is arguably the greatest songwriter of his generation.
