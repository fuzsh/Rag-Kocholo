        "text": "Anna Quayle, who has died aged 86, thrilled early-1960s theatre audiences in London and New York when she starred as Evie and the other women in Anthony Newley’s life in the musical Stop the World – I Want to Get Off.\n\n“Broadway’s new comedy queen,” enthused one American critic.\n\nThe subject matter was breezily racy for the time, with Newley’s character Littlechap marrying his boss’s daughter (Anna Quayle) after she falls pregnant.\n\nThen during business trips carrying on with Anya, a Russian hostess, Ilse, a German domestic help, and Ginnie, an American cabaret singer – all revue-sketch cameos brought to life by Anna Quayle, whom The Daily Telegraph’s Eric Shorter found “delightful”.\n\nThe musical, written by Newley and Leslie Bricusse, opened in the West End at the Queen’s Theatre (1961-62) and moved to Broadway (Shubert and Ambassador, 1962-4) where the two stars reprised their roles.\n\nAnna Quayle won a Tony award for Best Performance by a Featured Actress in a Musical.\n\nShe soon switched to the big screen to take the non-singing role of Millie for a brief scene in the Beatles’ first film, A Hard Day’s Night (1964).\n\nBackstage, Millie passes John Lennon in a corridor and does a double take, setting up a surreal conversation with: “Hello – oh, wait a minute! You are –” “No, I’m not…,” he replies. “I’m not, no.”\n\nShe insists that he looks “just like him”, but cannot remember his name. Lennon comes up with a string of reasons for his not looking like himself and, putting on her glasses, Millie concludes: “You don’t look like him at all.” Lennon walks away with the parting aside: “She looks more like him than I do.”\n\n“You’re my little chuchi face,” he sings, and she replies: “You’re my little teddy bear.” The lovey-dovey cheesiness, complete with the couple’s hand claps while dancing, is undercut by the baron’s hatred of his wife, but she is oblivious of his attempts to murder her in a string of visual gags.\n\nShe was born Anne Veronica Maria Quay in Birmingham on October 6 1932 to the actor-producer Douglas Quayle (real name John Douglas Bewick Quay) and Kathleen (née Parke).\n\nFrom the age of three, when she appeared in East Lynne, she performed in her father’s stage shows and eventually became known as Anna.\n\nOn leaving the Convent of Jesus and Mary in Harlesden she won a scholarship to train at Rada. She broke her nose in three places after falling off a ladder while earning money as a fashion model – and decided against surgery when her father said it was a good “prop”.\n\nOn television, alongside appearing in entertainment shows and occasional dramas, she brought her Catholic childhood to the role of Reverend Mother Joseph in the sitcom Father Charlie (1982), and played Aunt Spicer in James and the Giant Peach (1975) and form tutor Mrs “Marilyn” Monroe in Grange Hill (1990-94).\n\nAmong Quayle’s other films was Drop Dead Darling in 1966, the James Bond spoof Casino Royale the following year and the Frankie Howerd vehicle Up the Chastity Belt in 1971.\n\nAnna Quayle’s 1976 marriage to the agent and producer Don Baker ended in divorce. She is survived by their daughter, Katy, and her actor brother, John.\n\nAnna Quayle, born October 6 1932, died August 16 2019"
