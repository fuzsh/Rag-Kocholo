        "text": "January 1\n\nLouise Erdrich, a Dartmouth graduate whose German-born father and Turtle Mountain Chippewa mother worked at the Bureau of Indian Affairs together, introduces America to her brilliant voice with Love Medicine, her debut novel.\n\nFebruary 20\n\nFormer VP Walter Mondale wins the Iowa Caucus with 49 percent of the vote to Gary Hart’s 16 percent. Many believe the Dem nom is in the bag, but Hart wins New Hampshire. Mondale clinches it, though, when he trots out the very ’80s slogan “Where’s the beef?”\n\nMarch 15\n\nSuperstar NYC graffiti artist Keith Haring spends a week as artist-in-residence at the Walker Art Center. He paints a large-scale mural of a dragon with the head of a personal computer—maybe in response to Apple’s first Macintosh being launched in January.\n\nMay 1\n\nBob Ulrich is named president of the newly combined Dayton’s and Hudson’s department stores. He’ll eventually be promoted to CEO at Target—and will become the longest-running chief executive in the company’s history.\n\nMay 8\n\nKirby Puckett makes his major-league debut against the California Angels in Anaheim. The Twins rookie goes 4-for-5 with one run.\n\nMay 16\n\nPrince releases his first single off Purple Rain, a bass-line-less dance song entitled “When Doves Cry.” It shoots to No. 1 by summer and stays for five weeks, denying Bruce Springsteen’s “Dancing in the Dark” the top slot.\n\nJune 25\n\nPrince drops the soundtrack for Purple Rain. It becomes Prince’s first No. 1 Billboard album and stays on top for 24 weeks before remaining on the charts for 167 more.\n\nJune 29\n\nBruce Springsteen kicks off his Born in the U.S.A. Tour at the St. Paul Civic Center. The night before, he filmed a video for “Dancing in the Dark” directed by Brian De Palma (Scarface). The Boss pulled an unknown ringer onstage—future Friend Courteney Cox.\n\nJuly 1\n\nSt. Paul hard-core band Hüsker Dü releases Zen Arcade, a double album about a young loner who runs away from home in a failed attempt to find inner peace. The year is regarded as the end of punk, but the Dü’s sound anticipates ’90s grunge.\n\nJuly 12\n\nAfter weeks of interviewing potential running mates at his home in North Oaks, Walter Mondale holds a press conference at the state capitol and announces his selection: Geraldine Ferraro. She becomes the first woman to be nominated by a major party for VP.\n\nJuly 27\n\nPurple Rain premieres at Grauman’s Chinese Theatre in Hollywood—Weird Al, Pee-wee Herman, and Eddie Murphy are among the attendees. Prince arrives via purple limo holding a single rose. The film knocks Ghostbusters out of the No. 1 box office spot.\n\nAugust 5\n\nSusan Rapp, daughter of an Army Colonel and graduate of Eden Prairie High School, wins a silver medal in the 200-meter breaststroke at the Summer Olympics in Los Angeles.\n\nAugust 16\n\nIn the dog days of a season of hope—the Twins will finish 81–81, avoiding a losing record for the first time in five years—the team is sold by Calvin Griffith to Minneapolis banking executive Carl Pohlad for $32 million.\n\nSeptember 7\n\nBlood Simple, the Coen bros’ debut, which revolves around very Coen-esque themes—a broken marriage, a botched ransom for a kidnapping, and a crooked PI—is screened for the first time at the Toronto International Film Festival.\n\nOctober 2\n\nWith a stylistic departure from the messy punk of their first two albums—and its Beatles rip-off of a title—The Replacements drop the third Minnesota-made musical masterpiece of 1984: Let It Be. The Village Voice’s Robert Christgau gives it an A+.\n\nOctober 6\n\nNew head football coach Lou Holtz revives the moribund Gophers, breaking a 17-game Big Ten losing streak in a game against Indiana at the Metrodome. They finish 4–7 and improve to 7–5 in 1985—by which time Holtz exercises his escape clause and bolts for Notre Dame.\n\nOctober 11\n\nAugust Wilson’s Ma Rainey’s Black Bottom makes its Broadway debut at the Cort Theatre. Wilson wrote much of what will become his first Tony-nominated play while living in St. Paul and working with Lou Bellamy at the Penumbra Theatre Company.\n\nNovember 6\n\nMondale loses the 1984 election in a landslide. Minnesota is the lone state to dissent from Reagan’s rare American consensus. The final tally: 525 electoral votes to 13. Jeez.\n\nNovember 20\n\nLouie Anderson makes his TV debut on The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson. From his first joke—“I can’t stay long; I’m in between meals”—he kills. Carson calls him back out to take a bow.\n\nDecember 23"
