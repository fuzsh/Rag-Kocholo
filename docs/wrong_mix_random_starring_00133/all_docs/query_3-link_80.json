        "text": "\"The whole world changed\" after Trump assassination attempt, Gov. Kristi Noem says\n\nSouth Dakota Gov. Kristi Noem praised former President Donald Trump as a “fighter” and said “the whole world changed” two days ago when there was an assassination attempt on Trump.\n\nNoem described Trump as the “toughest man that I have ever met.”\n\n“Nobody has endured more than what he has gone through. They’ve attacked his reputation, they impeached him, they tried to bankrupt him, and they unjustly prosecuted him. But even in the most perilous moment this week, his instinct was to stand and to fight.”\n\nThe post has been updated with more on Noem’s remarks.\n\nJohnson delivered old version of RNC speech erroneously loaded into teleprompter\n\nSen. Ron Johnson delivered an old version of his Republican National Convention speech on Monday night in Milwaukee, calling Democratic policies a “clear and present danger to the country,” as former President Donald Trump and his Republican allies, including the Wisconsin senator himself, have called for unity in the wake of the assassination attempt on Trump.\n\nJohnson’s spokesperson confirmed to CNN that the senator delivered an old version of his remarks that had been erroneously loaded into the teleprompter, instead of the new version calling for unity.\n\nJohnson told Republican delegates that Vice President Kamala Harris and President Joe Biden have “made our lives less safe and far more expensive,” before criticizing Democrats on border security, government spending and gender policies.\n\n“Today’s Democrat agenda, their policies are a clear and present danger to America, to our institutions, to our values and our people,” Johnson said.\n\nThe Wisconsin Republican told the state’s delegates on Monday morning that he was “so pleased” that Trump had decided to alter his planned convention speech to capture a unifying message.\n\nStill, Johnson told the delegation he expected Republicans to continue to draw contrasts with their political rivals.\n\nJohnson said he believes the “vast majority of Democrats” love the country, as Republicans do, adding, “we’ve got different visions, we have different policies, but they love this country.”\n\nFact Check: MTG on Transgender Day of Visibility\n\nRep. Marjorie Taylor Greene said while attacking Democrats in her convention speech Monday that “the establishment in Washington” held Transgender Day of Visibility on Easter this year.\n\n“They promised normalcy and gave us Transgender Visibility Day on Easter Sunday,” the Georgia Republican said.\n\nFacts first: This claim needs context. Transgender Day of Visibility has been held annually on March 31 since it was started in 2009 as a day of awareness to celebrate the successes of transgender and gender-nonconforming people. Easter is celebrated on the first Sunday after the first full moon following the first day of spring and can change year to year. The holiday happened to fall on March 31 in 2024.\n\nResponding to Republicans criticizing President Joe Biden, White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre in an April 1 briefing said she was “surprised by the misinformation” surrounding Easter and Transgender Day of Visibility falling on the same day.\n\n“Every year, for the past several years, on March 31, Transgender Day of Visibility is marked. And as we know — for folks who understand the calendar and how it works, Easter falls on different Sundays every year. And this year, it happened to coincide with Transgender Visibility Day. And so, that is the simple fact,” she said.\n\nPrivate efforts to nudge Biden to step aside continue, sources tell CNN\n\nThe public calls from Democrats asking President Joe Biden to bow out of the presidential race have quieted in recent days, but private efforts to nudge the president and his top aides continue, several Democratic sources tell CNN.\n\nAmong the efforts, these sources say, are repeated memos from a seasoned and respected Democratic pollster, Stanley Greenberg, sharing his take that Biden is on track to lose the election, and in a way that does deep damage to other Democratic candidates.\n\nThese sources said Greenberg has sent several memos over the past two weeks, since the president’s devastating debate performance, analyzing polling internals he asserts show the president’s position continues to deteriorate because Americans overwhelmingly do not see him as up to serving four more years.\n\nGreenberg has been a leading Democratic pollster for decades and his work includes advising Bill Clinton’s two winning presidential campaigns. He declined comment when contacted Monday evening.\n\nSeveral Democratic members of Congress also have continued to lobby privately, these sources said, urging top Biden advisers to consider the damage to Biden’s legacy if the president not only loses the White House but Republicans hold the House and capture the Senate majority.\n\nOne Democratic lawmaker told CNN some top Biden aides get “the depth of this” but believe it can be turned around and in any event describe the president as adamant in the belief he can win. In his NBC News interview Monday, for example, the president again made clear he has no intention of stepping aside.\n\nThe lawmaker’s view was that it was counterproductive to make additional public calls for Biden to step aside right now, because of the imperative of a unified party response to this week’s Republican convention and because of the president’s repeated public statements about staying in the race.\n\nBut this Democrat predicted that approach would change if the polling and other data after the GOP convention showed the president’s standing deteriorating more.\n\nFact Check: RNC video falsely claims Trump signed largest tax cuts ever\n\nA video played at the Republican National Convention featured a narrator making the claim that former President Donald Trump “gave us the largest tax cuts in history.”\n\nFacts First: This is false. Analyses have found that Trump’s 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act was not the largest in history, either in percentage of gross domestic product or inflation-adjusted dollars.\n\nThe act made numerous permanent and temporary changes to the tax code, including reducing both corporate and individual income tax rates.\n\nIn a report released in June, the federal government’s nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office looked at the size of past tax cuts enacted between 1981 and 2023. It found that two other tax cut bills have been bigger – former President Ronald Reagan’s 1981 package and legislation signed by former President Barack Obama that extended earlier tax cuts enacted during former President George W. Bush’s administration.\n\nThe CBO measured the size of tax cuts by looking at the revenue effects of the bills as a percentage of gross domestic product – in other words, how much federal revenue the bill cuts as a portion of the economy – over five years. Reagan’s 1981 tax cut and Obama’s 2012 tax cut extension were 3.5% and 1.7% of GDP, respectively.\n\nTrump’s 2017 tax cut, by contrast, was estimated to be about 1% of GDP.\n\nThe Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, a nonprofit, found in 2017 that the framework for the Trump tax cuts would be the fourth largest since 1940 in inflation-adjusted dollars and the eighth largest since 1918 as a percentage of gross domestic product.\n\nFact Check: Marjorie Taylor Greene’s misleading claim about Biden-era job growth\n\nIn her speech at the Republican National Convention, Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene of Georgia claimed of Democrats: “They claim that our economy is thriving, yet hundreds of thousands of American-born workers lost their jobs these past few years.”\n\nFacts First: This is misleading at best. Bureau of Labor Statistics figures show that the number of American-born workers with jobs has grown significantly during President Joe Biden’s administration. About 130.9 million American-born workers were employed in June, an increase of nearly 4.7 million since June 2021, shortly after Biden took office. (This data is not seasonally adjusted, so we have to look at the same month in each year for an accurate comparison. In January 2021, the month Biden was sworn in, about 123 million American-born workers were employed.)\n\nThere is always churn in the labor market, so it’s certainly possible that hundreds of thousands of individual American-born workers lost their jobs during this period – but contrary to Greene’s insinuation, there have been far greater gains than losses under Biden for American-born workers as a group.\n\nVivek Ramaswamy says he supports former classmate JD Vance for vice president\n\nFormer Republican candidate for president, Vivek Ramaswamy, voiced support for Ohio Sen. JD Vance as Donald Trump’s running mate.\n\n“We used to watch Bengals games at the bar in law school, it’s awesome we’re now here a decade later with JD joining the strongest presidential ticket in our lifetime,” he said. “He’ll be an outstanding Vice President and I look forward to everything ahead for him and for our country.”\n\nOhio Democratic Party decries Vance selection as Trump's vice presidential nominee\n\nShortly after JD Vance was announced as Donald Trump’s running mate, the Ohio Democratic Party decried the decision.\n\nThe Ohio Democratic Party called Vance “an out-of-touch millionaire who launched his political career by taking advantage of Ohio’s opioid crisis and has spent his time in the Senate humiliating himself in the service of a convicted felon instead of working to improve the quality of life for Ohioans.\n\nThe organization added, “Ohio has buyers’ remorse. Donald Trump and the country will too,” they said.\n\nWho are some of the notable figures who awarded delegates at the RNC?\n\nSome of the speakers who took to the stage to announce their state’s delegates for former President Donald Trump are well-known names in their own right. Here are a few of the key individuals who took a role in the process to nominate Trump:\n\nCorey Lewandowski, who delivered New Hampshire’s 22 delegates to Trump, served as his 2016 campaign manager. He was later ousted from a pro-Trump super PAC in 2021 following reports that a donor accused him of making unwanted sexual advances toward her. Lewandowski later made a deal with prosecutors to avoid a misdemeanor charge stemming from the alleged sexual harassment.\n\nMichael McDonald, the Nevada GOP chairman who seconded the former president’s nomination, was one of the Trump campaign’s “fake electors” from the 2020 election. He was part of the delegation of six Trump supporters in Nevada who submitted phony certificates to Congress claiming they were the rightful electors from that state, which Trump narrowly lost to Joe Biden. He was indicted on state charges in Nevada over his role in the scheme, but the case was thrown out last month for jurisdictional reasons. The Nevada attorney general, a Democrat, promised to appeal that decision.\n\nHouse GOP Conference Chair Elise Stefanik, who delivered New York’s delegates, has been a key ally to Trump despite previously being a skeptic of the former president in 2016. The New York Republican was at one point in consideration to be the former president’s running mate.\n\nTrump’s eldest sons, Eric Trump and Donald Trump Jr., delivered Florida’s delegates, pushing him over the top to officially secure the party’s nomination.\n\nBiden campaign says Vance will push \"extreme MAGA agenda\"\n\nThe Biden-Harris campaign said that JD Vance, who former President Donald Trump picked as his running mate, will “bend over backwards to enable Trump and his extreme MAGA agenda, even if it means breaking the law and no matter the harm to the American people.”\n\nThe campaign said it will focus on highlighting the contrasting visions of America: The Biden-Harris ticket, which wants to unify the nation, create opportunity for all and lower costs; or the Trump-Vance ticket, which has a harmful agenda that seeks to take away Americans’ rights, hurt the middle class and make life more expensive, while benefiting the wealthy and “greedy corporations.”\n\n“Billionaires and corporations are literally rooting for J.D. Vance: they know he and Trump will cut their taxes and send prices skyrocketing for everyone else,” she continued.\n\nThe campaign ticked off what it said were Vance’s positions:\n\nSupports a nationwide ban on abortion and criticizes exceptions for rape and incest.\n\nSupports Trump’s agenda to cut Social Security and rip away Americans’ health care.\n\nDenies the results of the 2020 election and makes excuses for political violence.\n\nVirginia Gov. Youngkin previews his convention speech\n\nVirginia Gov. Glenn Youngkin, who is scheduled to speak at the Republican National Convention, previewed what he will speak about in his speech tonight.\n\nHe also said he was happy that former South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley was invited to speak at the RNC, after initially being kept off the program.\n\n“We have a big tent that is the Republican Party and we are filling it up. In Virginia, we were able to win the Hispanic vote and the Asian votes and more of the Black vote that we’ve seen in recent history. We can do this and this is our chance to not just bring together the Republican party, which you see all over here, but bring together America,” he told CNN’s Kaitlan Collins.\n\nMeanwhile: Classified documents case against Trump dismissed\n\nJudge Aileen Cannon has dismissed the classified documents case against former US President Donald Trump.\n\nIn a ruling Monday, Cannon said the appointment of special counsel Jack Smith violated the Constitution.\n\n“Both the Appointments and Appropriations challenges as framed in the Motion raise the following threshold question: is there a statute in the United States Code that authorizes the appointment of Special Counsel Smith to conduct this prosecution? After careful study of this seminal issue, the answer is no,” Cannon wrote in the ruling.\n\nCNN has reached out to special counsel Smith’s team for reaction.\n\nFollow our live coverage of the classified documents case here.\n\nClairton Sportsmen's Club president vaguely remembers Trump rally shooter\n\nThe president of the Clairton Sportsmen’s Club, where Trump rally shooter Thomas Crooks was a member, said he only vaguely remembers the gunman as one among 2,000 members, deferring comment to the attorney for the club.\n\nCrooks was a member of a Clairton, Pennsylvania sportsman club that has a rifle range of 200 yards, according to the Clairton Sportsmen’s Club attorney.\n\nAttorney Robert Bootay previously told CNN, “I can confirm that Mr. Crooks was a member of Clairton Sportsmen’s Club. Beyond that, the Club is unable to make any additional commentary in relation to this matter in light of pending law enforcement investigations.”\n\nPennsylvania GOP Senate candidate asks incumbent to suspend negative ads, saying it's time to \"come together\"\n\nDave McCormick, the Republican nominee for the US Senate in Pennsylvania, has called on Democratic Sen. Bob Casey to join him to “suspend our negative advertising.”\n\nMcCormick and Casey are engaged in a tight race in Keystone State — a key battleground that Democrats hope to hold to maintain control of the Senate.\n\nCasey has yet to respond to the proposal.\n\nSenate Democrat says he hopes Trump will \"follow the lead of President Biden\" and call for unity at RNC\n\nDemocrat Sen. Chris Coons, a co-chair for the Biden-Harris campaign, said on Monday that he hopes former president Donald Trump will use his platform at the Republican National Convention to “follow the lead of President Biden.”\n\nSpeaking to CNN’s Kate Bolduan, Coons highlighted Biden’s past remarks, including his inauguration address, that have called for unity among the American people.\n\nHis comments come after Trump told the Washington Examiner on Sunday that he was going to rewrite his original speech, saying it was a chance to “bring the whole country, even the whole world, together.”\n\nCoons unequivocally condemned political violence, highlighting several events in recent years in which elected officials have been attacked.\n\nDHS secretary calls Saturday shooting \"a failure\" of security\n\nHomeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas has admitted the attempted assassination of former President Donald Trump on Saturday was “a failure” of security.\n\n“An incident like this cannot happen,” he said, noting that President Joe Biden has directed an independent review.\n\nMayorkas said the government would “deliver answers to the American people to the fullest extent possible.”\n\nThe DHS secretary also strongly pushed back on the accusation that he had denied a request for more security for Trump.\n\n“That’s a baseless and irresponsible statement and is one that is unequivocally false,” he said.\n\nAt the start of his interview, Mayorkas echoed Biden’s words that “we are so relieved that former President Trump is okay. Our hearts break for the Comperatore family and of course we pray for a speedy and safe, full recovery for those injured,” he said.\n\nShooter purchased 50 rounds of ammunition hours before shooting\n\nThe shooter in Saturday’s attempted assassination on Donald Trump purchased 50 rounds of ammunition at a local gun store just hours before carrying out his attack, according to a senior law enforcement official.\n\nSecret Service did not sweep building where shooter was perched\n\nThe US Secret Service did not sweep the building from which the shooter in Saturday’s attempted assassination was perched, but instead leaned on local law enforcement to conduct security at that location.\n\nThe spokesman added that there was supposed to be local law enforcement posted in that area, but it is not clear where that post was supposed to be located. A source not directly involved but with knowledge of Secret Service operations described possible roaming posts, for example, as part of some operational plans.\n\nThe Secret Service regularly and successfully works with local law enforcement agencies to assist with securing events, as is the case in Milwaukee where the Republican National Convention is about to kick off.\n\nFurther, the Secret Service utilized two local counter-sniper teams during former President Donald Trump’s rally, in addition to two Secret Service counter-sniper teams.\n\nThe spokesman did not know at the time of CNN’s inquiry which local agency should have been responsible for the building.\n\nTrump expected to announce his running mate at convention\n\nFormer President Donald Trump said in interviews aired last month that he would announce his running mate at the Republican National Convention.\n\nThe presumptive GOP nominee was asked by TV psychologist Dr. Phil McGraw, “Are you going to tell me who your vice-presidential choice is?”\n\n“I can’t yet, but we have some very good people. I’m going to do it in the convention,” Trump said. The GOP convention will take place this week in Milwaukee.\n\nCNN reported on June 5 that vetting materials had been sent to several candidates under consideration to be Trump’s running mate, according to a person familiar with the process. People familiar with the deliberations, however, cautioned that Trump’s search at the time for a running mate was still in flux, and the campaign has emphasized that only Trump would make the final decision.\n\nMilwaukee mayor says he has \"faith and confidence\" in Secret Service ahead of RNC\n\nAs the Republican National Convention begins Monday in Milwaukee, the city’s mayor says he remains confident that security is at an appropriate level after the assassination attempt on former President Donald Trump.\n\nHe continued: “The director of the United States Secret Service continues to have faith in the work that happened over the last 18 months for security, and I have faith and confidence, as well, in the Secret Service, in the Milwaukee Police Department, and other law enforcement agencies that are providing public safety here today.”\n\nJohnson said the perimeter around the convention venue was relatively uneventful overnight, with only two minor arrests.\n\n“Some individuals had a drink or two too much,” Johnson said. “They were intoxicated and then ended up having some interaction with police.”\n\nBecause Wisconsin is an “open carry” state, people will be allowed to have firearms within the soft perimeter outside of Fiserv Forum that is not under Secret Service jurisdiction. Johnson said his concern about gun safety goes beyond a single event. “There are far too many people who have access to deadly weapons who should not have access to deadly weapons,” he said.\n\nAnalysis: A nation traumatized and a campaign transformed as Trump is set to reemerge\n\nDnald Trump will reemerge after an attempted assassination as an even greater mythical hero of his MAGA movement with the Republican National Convention opening today after an extraordinary two weeks that have transformed the 2024 campaign.\n\nSaturday’s shooting is only beginning to distill into a new national trauma. But both the former president and President Joe Biden are gaming out how to navigate the political aftershocks.\n\nAn assassination attempt against a presidential candidate, with all the historical allusions it evokes, raises fears that bloodshed will beget more bloodshed as the toxic politics of the last decade threaten to take an even more ominous turn.\n\nIn his first interview since the attempt on his life, the former president pledged that his RNC keynote address on Thursday — which had been expected to be an update on his “American carnage” inaugural address in 2017 — would be a “lot different.”\n\nRead the full analysis.\n\nCapitol Police operating in heightened threat environment in lead up to conventions\n\nIn a statement on the assassination attempt of former President Donald Trump, Capitol Police say they are already “operating in a heightened threat environment” due to threats against lawmakers.\n\nCapitol Police added that they “have been working with our federal, state and local partners on a comprehensive security plan to protect the Members of Congress” during both the Republican National Convention and the Democratic National Convention.\n\nAs CNN previously reported, Capitol Police are planning to send more than 300 officers to help with security to both the RNC from July 15 to 18 and the DNC from August 19 to 22 – the largest-ever deployment of officers from the department to an event outside of DC.\n\nBiden campaign held a staff call on Sunday acknowledging it's a difficult moment for the country\n\nThe Biden campaign and Democratic National Committee held a call with staff in the hours before President Joe Biden’s Oval Office address Sunday, acknowledging the difficult moment the country and team are navigating in the wake of the attempted assassination of former President Donald Trump, a source familiar with the call said.\n\n“We all do this work because we believe in this country and the people of this country and nobody wants to see this kind of violence to anyone, but to also not just be a citizen, but to be someone who works on behalf of this campaign and in the Party to try to navigate a tough time like this is doubly hard.”\n\nDNC chair Jaime Harrison also told staff on the call that he reached out to Republican National Committee chair Michael Whatley on Saturday to offer his thoughts and condolences and stressed the party’s commitment to opposing political violence, another source familiar with the call said.\n\nThe Biden campaign finds itself navigating a sensitive and complicated political dynamic in the aftermath of the attempted assassination of Trump. Top campaign officials sent a note to its staff shortly after Saturday’s shooting urging staff to “refrain from issuing any comments on social media or in public” and pulled its television advertisements.\n\nHere's the Secret Service director's statement on the Trump assassination attempt\n\nUS Secret Service Director Kimberly Cheatle on Monday released her first statement since the assassination attempt against Donald Trump on Saturday.\n\nRead the statement in full below:\n\n“I would like to start by extending my deepest condolences to the family and friends of Corey Comperatore, who was killed during the assassination attempt on former President Donald Trump’s life in Butler, Pennsylvania, Saturday, as well as those who were injured during this senseless act of violence.\n\nSecret Service personnel on the ground moved quickly during the incident, with our counter sniper team neutralizing the shooter and our agents implementing protective measures to ensure the safety of former president Donald Trump.\n\nSince the shooting, I have been in constant contact with Secret Service personnel in Pennsylvania who worked to maintain the integrity of the crime scene until the FBI assumed its role as the lead investigating agency into the assassination attempt. I have also been coordinating with the protective detail for former President Trump and have briefed President Biden on the details of the incident.\n\nThe Secret Service is working with all involved Federal, state and local agencies to understand what happened, how it happened, and how we can prevent an incident like this from ever taking place again. We understand the importance of the independent review announced by President Biden yesterday and will participate fully. We will also work with the appropriate Congressional committees on any oversight action.\n\nThe incident in Pennsylvania has understandably led to questions about potential updates or changes to the security for the Republican National Convention in Milwaukee. The U.S. Secret Service, in conjunction with our Federal, state and local law enforcement and public safety partners, designs operational security plans for National Special Security Events (NSSE) to be dynamic in order to respond to a kinetic security environment and the most up-to-date intelligence from our partners.\n\nI am confident in the security plan our Secret Service RNC coordinator and our partners have put in place, which we have reviewed and strengthened in the wake of Saturday’s shooting. The security plans for National Special Security Events are designed to be flexible. As the conventions progress, and in accordance with the direction of the President, the Secret Service will continuously adapt our operations as necessary in order to ensure the highest level of safety and security for convention attendees, volunteers and the City of Milwaukee. In addition to the additional security enhancements we provided former President Trump’s detail in June, we have also implemented changes to his security detail since Saturday to ensure his continued protection for the convention and the remainder of the campaign.\n\nThe Secret Service is tasked with the tremendous responsibility of protecting the current and former leaders of our democracy. It is a responsibility that I take incredibly seriously, and I am committed to fulfilling that mission.”\n\nSecret Service director is \"confident\" in security plan for RNC convention\n\nThe US Secret Service director on Monday sought to assure Americans that there is ample security in place for the upcoming RNC convention following the assassination attempt against Donald Trump.\n\n“I am confident in the security plan our Secret Service RNC coordinator and our partners have put in place, which we have reviewed and strengthened in the wake of Saturday’s shooting,” Kimberly Cheatle wrote in a statement.\n\nCheatle addressed the USSS’ presence at the Trump rally on Saturday, first extending her condolences to the friends and family of Corey Comperatore, a firefighter who was killed at the rally in Butler, Pennsylvania.\n\nShe said agents at the scene “moved quickly during the incident, with our counter sniper team neutralizing the shooter and our agents implementing protective measures to ensure the safety of former president Donald Trump.”\n\nCheatle also confirmed that the Secret Service was engaged in an independent review announced by President Joe Biden to “understand what happened, how it happened and how we can prevent an incident like this from ever taking place again.”\n\nBiden's political challenge changes in an instant after assassination attempt on Trump\n\nPresident Joe Biden was bracing for a week of political onslaught.\n\nMore Democratic lawmakers were expected to publicly call on him to drop out of the 2024 race, a grueling campaign schedule would put his stamina on display and a high-stakes TV interview was sure to once again spotlight questions about his age, health and fitness to serve a second term.\n\nWhen gunshots rang out at a Donald Trump political rally in Butler, Pennsylvania, on Saturday, much of that appeared to change.\n\nAt least for a brief moment, politics largely came to a halt. As bipartisan calls condemning the horrific attack on Trump poured in from all corners of the country, the Biden campaign immediately paused TV ads and political communications, and the White House postponed the president’s trip to Texas, where he had planned to attend a fundraiser. He also addressed the nation, calling for a lowering of the political temperature.\n\nSomething else largely came to a halt: The calls from within Biden’s own party for him to abandon his campaign for a second term. Until that moment, those calls had been growing by the day since his disastrous debate performance against Trump last month.\n\nEven as the Biden campaign is working to delicately navigate a moment of national shock, some allies of the president are privately hopeful that the assassination attempt on Trump may ultimately end up quelling the Democratic dissent as the party recognizes the importance of standing as a united front.\n\nRead the full story.\n\nRep. Byron Donalds says Trump \"in good spirits\" after texting the former President Saturday night\n\nRepublican Rep. Byron Donalds of Florida said Monday he has not spoken with Donald Trump directly since Saturday’s assassination attempt but he did text with him that night.\n\nDonalds said that the assassination attempt has given Trump a “new sense of purpose” to move forward with his campaign and return to the White House. He agreed with Trump’s decision to change his Republican convention speech to focus on unity in the wake of the shooting.\n\n“It can’t go to that level,” he said of intense political rhetoric. “We are all Americans. We are one country.”\n\nDonalds, who serves on the House Oversight Committee, also noted that he wants all of the facts about security lapses on Saturday night before blaming any law enforcement agency or anyone else.\n\nTrump says he will give a \"whole different speech\" at the RNC after Saturday's assassination attempt\n\nMany of the questions that predated Saturday evening’s assassination attempt have largely faded into the background as former President Donald Trump, President Joe Biden and their respective allies rush to adapt their campaigns to the new landscape.\n\nIt’s not yet clear how this contest has been altered, but what begins on Monday with the delegate roll call and concludes Thursday night with the former president’s nomination acceptance speech, clearly marks the start of something new and fraught.\n\n“Honestly, it’s going to be a whole different speech now,” Trump told the Washington Examiner of his convention speech following the assassination attempt.\n\nTrump’s return to the stage, which could come earlier in the week, and his rhetoric at the podium will set the tone both for the final months of the presidential campaign and the near-term future of American politics. The former president has, so far, been restrained in his response to the attempt on his life. Other members of his party have not, with some immediately suggesting – without evidence – that the alleged gunman was driven to act by heated campaign rhetoric.\n\nAs the RNC gets underway, here's the latest on what we know about Trump's attempted assassination\n\nFormer President Donald Trump was injured in a shooting during his rally in Butler, Pennsylvania, Saturday evening that also killed one rally attendee and left two others seriously injured.\n\nA lot of new details have come to light since Saturday. Here’s what we know now on the attempted assassination:\n\nTrump speaks about attempted killing: In a new interview with the New York Post, Trump reflected on the assassination attempt, saying: “I’m not supposed to be here, I’m supposed to be dead.” He described the phone call he received from President Joe Biden as “fine” and “very nice.”\n\nTrump in Milwaukee: Just one day after the shooting, he arrived in Milwaukee Sunday for the GOP convention.\n\nInvestigation continues: House Homeland Security Chair Mark Green held a call with US Secret Service Director Kimberly Cheatle on Sunday afternoon with pressing questions on what led to Saturday’s historic security failures, a committee source familiar with the call told CNN.\n\nShooter location: Audio analysis confirms the suspected gunman was situated about 110 to 120 meters (or about 360 to 390 feet) from the podium, according to forensics expert Dr. Robert Maher of Montana State University.\n\nDemocratic reaction: President Joe Biden forcefully condemned the attack on Trump, calling on Americans to come together and “cool down” the rhetoric. Speaking Sunday night in a rare Oval Office address to the nation, Biden said: “A former president was shot. An American citizen, killed, while simple exercising his freedom to support the candidate of his choosing. We cannot – we must not go down this road in America.” Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris will receive another briefing Monday morning from law enforcement officials in the Situation Room on the attempted assassination.\n\nYou can more about how the assassination attempt played in this story, and you can learn more about the shooter by reading this story.\n\nInternational leaders continue to respond to assassination attempt on Trump\n\nLeaders from around the world continue to respond to the attempted assassination of former US President Donald Trump.\n\nThese are the latest to respond on Monday:\n\nRussia: The Kremlin said Russian President Vladimir Putin has not contacted former US President Donald Trump after his assassination attempt on Saturday and has no plans to. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov also reiterated Monday his condemnation of the attack after denouncing any “violence in politics” on Sunday.\n\nSlovakia: Slovak Prime Minister Robert Fico, who was targeted in an assassination attempt back in May, blamed “progressive and liberal media” for Saturday’s assassination attempt. The Slovakian leader was left in critical condition after he was shot from close range five times after an off-site government meeting earlier this year. A man described as a politically motivated “lone wolf” was charged with his attempted murder. Fico called the attempted assassination of Trump a “photocopy” of what happened to him.\n\nSouth Africa: In a post on X, South Africa’s President Cyril Ramaphosa described the attempted assassination as “a stark reminder of the dangers of political extremism and intolerance.” “Political violence is the antithesis of democracy. I wish former President Trump a speedy recovery,” his post continued.\n\nKing Charles III: King Charles III wrote privately to former US President Donald Trump on Sunday through the United Kingdom’s US embassy, Buckingham Palace told CNN. A royal source told CNN the Palace is not sharing details of what was contained in the letter as it is classed as private, but they added his sentiments are in keeping with those communicated by the British Prime Minister. On Sunday, British Prime Minister Keir Starmer said he was “appalled by the shocking scenes” at Trump’s rally in Pennsylvania.\n\nWe will update this post with more from global leaders as we get them throughout the day.\n\nHere's what will happen during the Republican National Convention\n\nThe main event at any national party convention is the official nomination of — and acceptance of the nomination by — presidential and vice presidential candidates.\n\nDelegates at the Republican National Convention in Milwaukee this week are expected to make former President Donald Trump the official GOP presidential nominee. Trump has said he would reveal his pick for running mate at the convention.\n\nHere’s how it could all play out:\n\nNominating a presidential candidate: The name of a candidate is placed into nomination for president with one or more speeches and then seconded. A roll call vote is then taken, with each state delegation announcing how many votes it is casting for each candidate. Candidates win these delegates through the primary elections and caucuses. Trump breezed through the primaries and amassed enough delegates to win the nomination.\n\nNominating a vice president: Traditionally this takes place after a presidential nominee has been selected, however, in 2020, Republicans nominated Mike Pence for vice president by acclamation before conducting the presidential roll call. Like the nominee for president, the name of a candidate is placed into the nomination and is seconded. A vice presidential candidate traditionally is nominated by acclamation — or voice vote — to avoid a potentially time-consuming roll call vote. Both parties have nominated their vice presidential candidates by acclamation since 1988.\n\nAccepting the vice presidential and presidential nominations: Both the president and vice presidential nominee deliver an acceptance speech.\n\nThe story behind that viral Trump photo after an attempted assassination\n\nIt began like any other campaign rally — one that photographer Evan Vucci had covered a hundred times before for the Associated Press.\n\nFormer President Donald Trump took the stage in Butler, Pennsylvania, greeted his supporters and started his speech.\n\nThen, in a flash, it was chaos.\n\n“Over my left shoulder. I heard some pops, and I knew right away it was gunfire,” Vucci said of Saturday’s assassination attempt. “At that moment, I trained my lens on the stage, and I saw the Secret Service agents coming in and covering (Trump) up. From there, I just went into work mode, and I just started doing my job.”\n\nWhile many at the rally took cover, Vucci and other photojournalists leapt into action.\n\nVucci was in the buffer area right in front of the stage when the gunshots rang out. His first thought wasn’t for his own safety but rather documenting the moment taking place in front of him. There are no second chances to capture history through a camera lens.\n\nTake a look at the photos from Saturday here.\n\nAnalysis: In the 1870s, there were 2 assassination attempts on political leaders. Here's what they warn us\n\nOn May 7, 1873, Louisiana Gov. William Pitt Kellogg made his way to his carriage following a meeting in New Orleans, when a man named Charles R. Railey confronted him. Railey told him he was frustrated with how he had been governing, as Kellogg walked away.\n\nAs Kellogg’s carriage rounded the corner one shot rang out. He raised his hand to his neck as his driver raced them away, and though early reports said Kellogg had been shot in his neck and gravely wounded, it turned out that the bullet had just missed him.\n\nIt’s one of the many often forgotten events in US history that I learned about while working on an upcoming book “America’s Deadliest Election, A Cautionary Tale of the Most Violent Election in American History,” with my coauthor David Fisher.\n\nSince the attempted assassination of former President Donald Trump, many have rightly pointed to the sad, bloody history of violence against American political leaders – the murders of Presidents Abraham Lincoln, James A. Garfield, William McKinley and John F. Kennedy, and the attempted assassinations of Presidents Theodore Roosevelt, Harry S. Truman, Ronald Reagan and Gerald Ford.\n\nAmerica’s story is complicated, especially when it comes to passions about our leaders and what and whom they represent. And while violence should never be the answer, it has occurred more than any of us would want to admit.\n\nRead more about the history of violence in US politics here.\n\nThere are no plans to tighten security for RNC after Trump assassination attempt, Secret Service says\n\nThe Secret Service said Sunday that there are no plans to tighten its security arrangements for the Republican National Convention, which begins Monday in Milwaukee.\n\nIt was the first on-camera appearance of a Secret Service representative since the assassination attempt on former President Donald Trump on Saturday. The agency has issued a series of statements following the shooting in Butler, Pennsylvania, but did not appear during a law enforcement news conference there late Saturday.\n\nThe Sunday afternoon news conference on preparations for the RNC did not address the assassination attempt, but federal officials said there were no signs of increased danger at the convention following the shooting.\n\n“Currently there are no known articulated threats against the RNC or anyone visiting the RNC,” said Michael Hensle, the special agent in charge of the FBI field office in Milwaukee.\n\nFirearms will be permitted in a “soft perimeter” around the Fiserv Forum, the venue where the convention will take place, and local officials said state law does not permit them to change those plans.\n\n“Wisconsin is an open-carry state, and therefore Milwaukee and no other jurisdiction in this state can supersede state law,” said Milwaukee Mayor Cavalier Johnson.\n\nTrump is set to officially become the GOP nominee this week. Here's a recap of how we got here\n\nAn incumbent Democratic president seeking reelection coupled with the unusual circumstances of a defeated one-term president seeking another term set up the 2024 primaries as both unprecedented and uncompetitive.\n\nIn the end, both President Joe Biden and former President Donald Trump romped through the primaries — each clinching the nomination on March 12, just a week after Super Tuesday.\n\nWhile about a dozen Republicans sought to challenge Trump, there wasn’t much of a contest. That field spent most of 2023 competing amongst itself for who would emerge as the Trump alternative, while the former president largely didn’t engage — even choosing to skip debates.\n\nBy the Iowa caucuses, it was clear that Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis and former US ambassador to the United Nations Nikki Haley were the only major candidates left to challenge Trump.\n\nAfter Trump won a historic victory in Iowa, beating both DeSantis and Haley by 30 percentage points, it became even more clear that despite his 2020 loss and the January 6 insurrection, Trump remained the favorite of the Republican base. Haley stuck around with a stronger anti-Trump message and won the District of Columbia and Vermont but dropped out of the race the day after Super Tuesday.\n\nRead about Trump’s campaign promises so far here.\n\nHere's what Trump said on stage in the seconds after shots were fired at Saturday's rally\n\nMoments after he was shot at a rally in Butler, Pennsylvania, on Saturday afternoon, Donald Trump was seen with blood on his ear and cheek as he was rushed off the stage.\n\nAudio reveals how the chaotic shooting scene played out from the view of Trump and those involved in getting him to safety. Trump was in the middle of speaking when several shots rang out. He clasps his ear and ducks as Secret Service agents surround him. “Get down, get down, get down,” one says. Another shot sounds and a woman screams.\n\nSeveral voices of Secret Service agents are heard — one says “up!” another “stairs are ready, stairs are ready.” Trump can be heard as well but his words are indistinct. More agents go on stage, some holding assault rifles. Trump’s supporters in the background look shocked, while some film with their phones.\n\nAfter hearing that the shooter is down, Trump and the agents stand up. Here’s what was said:\n\nTrump: “Let me get my shoes, let me get my shoes.”\n\nMale agent: “I got you sir, I got you sir.”\n\nTrump: “Let me get my shoes.”\n\nAnother male agent: “Hold on, your head is bloody.”\n\nMale agent: “Sir, we’ve got to move to the car sir.”\n\nTrump: “Let me get my shoes.”\n\nFemale agent says, “OK,” before saying something about the shoe.\n\nTrump: “Wait, wait, wait.” He then fist pumps to the crowd. He mouths “fight” three times — a move met with cheers by the crowd.\n\nTrump and the Secret Service team move away from the podium and head to the cars as the crowd chants, “USA. USA. USA.”\n\nYou can watch video of the scene here, and read more details from the audio here.\n\nMinute by minute: Here's a visual timeline of the Trump assassination attempt\n\nFormer President Donald Trump was injured in a shooting during his rally in Butler, Pennsylvania, in what the FBI says was an assassination attempt on Saturday night. One rally attendee was killed and two others were seriously injured.\n\nThe rally marked Trump’s last public appearance before the scheduled start of the Republican National Convention in Milwaukee, where the Republican Party is set to formally select him as its presidential nominee.\n\nThrough videos, maps and photos, CNN pieced together what occurred from the start of the rally to the chaotic moments when gunshots erupted to, ultimately, when Trump landed in Newark, New Jersey, early Sunday morning.\n\nView CNN’s timeline here.\n\nWhat to watch at the Republican National Convention\n\nThe Republican National Convention will now take place under the shadow of the attempt to assassinate Donald Trump on Saturday.\n\nIt’s unclear what effect the shooting will have on what had been expected to be a week of pomp and prime-time speeches designed to make the GOP’s best case for Trump and a Republican majority on Capitol Hill.\n\nHere’s what to watch:\n\nWhat will change because of the shooting? Many of the questions that predated the assassination attempt have largely faded into the background as Trump, President Joe Biden and their respective allies rush to adapt their campaigns to the new landscape.\n\nIt’s unclear how this contest has been altered, but what begins today with the delegate roll call and concludes Thursday night with the former president’s nomination acceptance speech, clearly marks the start of something new and fraught.\n\nTrump’s return to the stage and his rhetoric at the podium will set the tone both for the final months of the presidential campaign and the near-term future of US politics. He has, so far, been restrained in his response to the attempt on his life. Other members of his party have not, with some immediately suggesting – without evidence – that the alleged gunman was driven to act by heated campaign rhetoric.\n\nWho is the VP pick going to be? The decision has been made, Trump recently said. CNN previously reported that the Trump campaign viewed today as its deadline for naming a running mate. The potential for a made-for-TV unveiling is there – and it’s likely down to three people: North Dakota Gov. Doug Burgum, Florida Sen. Marco Rubio and Ohio Sen. J.D. Vance. The timeline, though, could be thrown off by the attempt on Trump’s life.\n\nFamily reunion: In 2016, Trump’s children all spoke to the convention and were viewed as bright-eyed validators for his candidacy. Four years later, they mostly took a more aggressive tone.\n\nThe public view of Donald Trump Jr., Eric Trump, Ivanka Trump and Tiffany Boulos (née Trump) has changed over the past eight years. Trump’s eldest sons have emerged as vocal supporters of his right-wing politics. His daughter-in-law, Lara Trump, is now the co-chair of the Republican National Committee. Both Ivanka and Tiffany are expected to be in Milwaukee.\n\nAs will former first lady Melania Trump, though it is unclear whether she will speak.\n\nHere’s what else to watch.\n\nWisconsin GOP chair says there are no \"major changes\" to RNC schedule and he's \"confident\" in security prep\n\nWisconsin Republican Party chairman Brian Schimming said Sunday that as of now, there are no major changes being made to the Republican National Convention schedule, including the expectation that former President Donald Trump’s vice presidential pick will speak on Wednesday, followed by Trump on Thursday.\n\nSchimming told reporters he spoke to RNC chairman Michael Whatley earlier in the day and “everything for the convention is going on as planned.”\n\n“We have dozens and dozens of speakers that will be speaking not only to the folks here, but to people across the nation and across the world about what Donald Trump’s gonna bring to this country. We want to make America great again, and the way to do it is to have a unified convention here in Milwaukee,” he continued.\n\nThough Trump has “obviously been through a lot in the last 24 hours,” Schimming said, based on his understanding, Trump is “doing well” and his thoughts are focused on the victims of the shooting.\n\nHe said he’s not anticipating any “major changes” to the existing security plan, adding “if they were to make any changes, there would be a reason for it, but we don’t see any reason for it right now.”\n\nSchimming told CNN that support from Trump in Wisconsin, a state he lost by just more than 20,000 votes in 2020, is “very, very strong” and said the former president demonstrated leadership amid tragedy on Saturday.\n\nTrump's former GOP primary rivals, Nikki Haley and Ron DeSantis, will speak at convention\n\nFormer GOP presidential candidate Nikki Haley will speak at the Republican National Convention this week, according to two sources. Haley was Trump’s chief rival in the GOP primary contests.\n\nCNN reported last week that Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, another one of Trump’s primary rivals, will also speak at the convention.\n\nTrump and DeSantis, who fiercely attacked one another during the GOP presidential primary, have made an effort to put their personal history behind them in recent months.\n\nDeSantis, who ended his presidential campaign in January and immediately endorsed Trump, met with the former president in Florida in April and told donors and supporters he would help fundraise for Trump.\n\nRead more about the decision behind inviting DeSantis to speak.\n\nDelegates will also conduct other party business at this week's Republican National Convention\n\nDelegates to the Republican National Convention will choose the GOP’s official nominee for president this week in Milwaukee, but they will also conduct other party business.\n\nThe Republican delegates are divided into several convention committees: credentials, rules, platform and permanent organization.\n\nCredentials: This committee is responsible for making sure that the delegates who attend the committee are qualified under party rules to serve. In modern conventions, this committee’s work is usually non-controversial and conducted before the convention actually begins.\n\nRules: The Rules Committee is responsible for reviewing and proposing changes to the official rules that govern the national party. These rules cover everything from how the primary calendar is structured to how delegates are allocated to candidates in a primary. The committee also determines the rules that govern the convention itself. The committee meets in the week leading up to the GOP convention and must come up with a package of rules to govern convention proceedings.\n\nPlatform: The Platform Committee is responsible for drafting the party’s declaration of core principles and beliefs and its official position on a number of issues and presenting it to the convention for approval. Aside from nominating the presidential ticket, this is the other principal function of a national party convention. The presidential nominee is not bound to the platform and often breaks from it on some issues.\n\nPermanent Organization: The Committee on Permanent Organization, which functions continuously between conventions, has as its primary role the selection of convention officers. The committee only exists as part of the GOP.\n\nTrump campaign says a teacher, a veteran and a rancher among those scheduled to speak at RNC\n\nFormer President Donald Trump’s campaign and the Republican National Convention announced more people expected to speak at next week’s convention in Milwaukee.\n\nThe convention’s Committee on Arrangements released on Friday a list of “everyday Americans” slotted to give remarks.\n\nIncluded in the list of speakers are a teacher, a veteran, a rancher who has property on the US-Mexico border, a small business owner, the head golf professional at Trump International and the golf general manager at Trump National Doral, according to a statement.\n\nAlso scheduled to speak is a sibling of Rachel Morin who was allegedly murdered by a man who illegally crossed the border in 2023."
