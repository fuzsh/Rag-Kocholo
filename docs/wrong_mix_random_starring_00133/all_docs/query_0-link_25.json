        "text": "As long as there have been humans, there has been music — as well as mental illness. Thereby, people must have been singing about it since the beginning, right?\n\nSure. But music's an abstract, poetic artform, so the topic usually isn't approached literally. That's why Hank Williams wrote \"I'm So Lonesome I Could Cry,\" not \"I'm Depressed And Also An Alcoholic.\" And why the Rolling Stones called it \"Paint It, Black,\" not \"Wantonly Projecting My Trauma.\"\n\nSo, what does that mean for mental illness and the history of popular music? That delineations aren't always neat and tidy. That's why GRAMMY.com prepared a list of songs that address psychological maladies, more-or-less directly.\n\nObviously, it's not exhaustive — how could a list that leaves out all pre-1968 music be? Plus, It's not like these tunes have to reference the DSM-5 — it's that, to make the cut, they should touch on anxiety, depression, addiction, PTSD, and other conditions without too many buffering layers.\n\nWith that in mind, here are 15 songs from across the decades that got real about the realities of mental illness, and how to overcome it.\n\nThe Beatles, \"Yer Blues\" (1968)\n\nAfter years of freewheeling experimentation in the studio, the Fabs finally jammed out in a room together. Eyeball-to-eyeball, they recorded \"Yer Blues,\" John Lennon's 12-bar cry for help from the White Album.\n\nNever before or since — not even on 1970's shockingly confessional Plastic Ono Band — had he been this candid about suicidal depression in a song. And more than half a century later, \"Yer Blues\" remains bracing, cathartic and strangely giddy.\n\nRead More: Now That I Showed You What I Been Through: 50 Years Of John Lennon/Plastic Ono Band\n\nBill Fay, \"Be Not So Fearful\" (1970)\n\nSkip the string-swelling version from Bill Fay's self-titled debut and seek out the stripped-down demo, found on From The Bottom of An Old Grandfather Clock. What you'll hear is a pocket-sized hymn for when the enemy within has you on the ropes.\n\n\"Someone watches you,\" the English singer/songwriter promises, \"you will not leave the rails.\" A rare thing: a convincing argument against anxiety, and a song of honest-to-goodness utility.\n\nDaniel Johnston, \"Peek a Boo\" (1982)\n\nThroughout his long, unconventional career until his untimely death in 2019, singer/songwriter Daniel Johnston unflinchingly detailed his hopes, longings and fears in his rough-hewn music — as well as his struggles with bipolar disorder and schizophrenia.\n\nHis songbook is littered with sometimes harrowing songs about the latter, but \"Peek a Boo\" sums it up: \"I'm tired from being kidnapped by a dark wolf that would do me in.\"\n\nSwans, \"God Damn the Sun\" (1989)\n\nWhile mostly known for skull-rattling noise jams and symphony scale indie rock, Swans have at least one unforgettable acoustic ballad.\n\nThe majestic, doomed \"God Damn the Sun\" isn't just worthy of Leonard Cohen — because of leader Michael Gira's unvarnished language, it arguably surpasses even the Godfather of Goth's sense of despair.\n\n\"I've got one thing to say before I am drunk again,\" Gira seethes, before condemning life on Earth — all of it. But he made it through, and so can all of us. And when we're in the depths of sorrow articulated in \"God Damn the Sun,\" sometimes pitch-black commiseration feels paradoxically healing.\n\nBob Dylan, \"Not Dark Yet\" (1997)\n\nLess theatrical than \"God Damn the Sun\" yet no less unequivocal about depression, this late-period masterpiece from Time Out of Mind is the soundtrack to self-inventory deep into the night.\n\n\"Every nerve in my body is so naked and numb,\" Uncle Bob sings over a gorgeous soundscape by producer Daniel Lanois, sounding depleted and discouraged. \"I can't even remember what it was I came here to get away from.\"\n\nWhat a monument to a universal facet of the human condition — a fearsome enemy, but not one that has to consume us.\n\nSia, \"Breathe Me\" (2004)\n\nSia's \"Breathe Me\" feels like a continuation of Nine Inch Nails' (and Johnny Cash's) classic \"Hurt\" — only left off this list due to its ubiquity — thanks to its opening lines.\n\n\"Help, I have done it again/ I have been here many times before,\" she sings. \"Hurt myself again today/ And, the worst part is there's no one else to blame.\"\n\nHung on piano and a hangdog string section, \"Breathe Me\" is a dispatch about despair and vulnerability that belongs on a shelf with the best of them.\n\nAmy Winehouse, \"Wake Up Alone\" (2006)\n\nSadly, the wildly talented Amy Winehouse didn't win her battle against drug and alcohol addiction — alcohol poisoning got her at only 27.\n\nBut she left behind a monster body of work — including her breakthrough album Back to Black, which garnered her a whopping five GRAMMYs.\n\nOver a doo-wop rhythm and stabbing chords, \"Wake Up Alone\" is both a love song and a gripping expression of crepuscular loneliness and discontent. \"That silent sense of content that everyone gets,\" Winehouse sings, \"Just disappears soon as the sun sets.\"\n\nParamore, \"Fake Happy\" (2017)\n\nThe juxtaposition of crestfallen lyrics with a sparkling melody is the heart of power-pop — and by extension, pop-punk and alternative rock. And Paramore, who's been at the vanguard of both subgenres for almost 20 years, blends these qualities masterfully.\n\n\"Fake Happy,\" an inspired single from After Laughter, captures the feeling of feigning a grin when you're down in the dumps. \"If I go out tonight, dress up my fears,\" asks bandleader Hayley Williams, \"you think I'll look alright with these mascara tears?\"\n\nAriana Grande, \"breathin\" (2018)\n\nDespite dealing with high-profile breakups and PTSD from horror of the Manchester Arena bombing, Ariana Grande examines her internal mechanisms with humility and magnanimity. (Just think of her immortal line: \"I'm so f***ing grateful for my ex.\")\n\n\"breathin,\" from Sweetener, is no different. \"Feel my blood runnin', swear the sky's fallin'/ How do I know if this s***'s fabricated?\" she asks. Grande doesn't get self-pitying or pretend to have the answers — instead, she looks to a universal human balm during throttling times.\n\n\"Just keep breathin' and breathin' and breathin' and breathin',\" she sings in the hook, over and over and over — like she's telling herself to hang in there as much as us.\n\nJason Isbell and the 400 Unit, \"It Gets Easier\" (2020)\n\nSince his Drive-By Truckers days, Jason Isbell has written like a surgeon about fundamental topics — his sociopolitical beliefs; his relationship with his wife, Amanda Shires; and his decade-plus of sobriety.\n\nTrue to the current state of his recovery, \"It Gets Easier\" isn't about getting on the wagon, but staying on it. It begins with a \"drunk dream,\" a common phenomenon among those sobering up. \"I had one glass of wine/ I woke up feeling fine/ That's how I knew it was a dream,\" he sings.\n\nTaking a cue from his friend and mentor, the late John Prine, Isbell sums up the tune in a crystalline thesis of a hook, over a kicking guitar riff: \"It gets easier, but it never gets easy.\"\n\nG Herbo, \"PTSD\" (2020)\n\nFile this one with Grande's Sweetener, which addresses the Manchester Bombing and her emotions in its wake.\n\nWhile many of the entries insofar on this list deal with anxiety, depression or substance abuse, rapper G Herbo homes in on a very specific and sometimes misunderstood malady: post-traumatic stress disorder.\n\n\"I got a war zone inside of my head / I made it on my own, they said I'd be in jail or dead,\" he raps in \"PTSD,\" featuring Chance the Rapper, Lil Uzi Vert and Juice WRLD. \"I've seen my brothers fall over and over again / Don't stand too close to me, I got PTSD.\"\n\n\"I felt like people may look at my situation and my life like I don't do these things, like I don't have problems, like I don't endure pain or stress,\" Herbo told GRAMMY.com in 2020. \"I just wanted the world to know that we all are the same.\"\n\nRead More: G Herbo Talks PTSD And The Importance Of Mental Health: \"People Need To Treat Mental Health More Seriously\"\n\nFrancisca Valenzuela, \"La Fortaleza\" (2020)\n\n\"La Fortaleza\" — meaning \"the fortitude\" or \"the strength\" — is an impactful statement by Chilean singer/songwriter Francisca Valenzuela about finding the resilience to go on.\n\n\"Everything that has happened has led me to today,\" she sings. \"I look forward to the horizon/ I bury guilt and leave.\" But Valenzuela isn't giving up, or stepping into oblivion. She's beginning anew.\n\n\"With my pen and my poem/ I will cross the mountain range,\" she sings, framing artistic expression as a magical weapon for healing and self-transformation. \"And if I am in the middle of the storm/ Be the calm that sustains the center of the earth.\"\n\nJulia Michaels, \"Anxiety\" (2021)\n\nSome measure of trepidation is necessary for survival, but full-blown anxiety warps that psychological tool — into one that can undermine our day-to-day relationships.\n\nSinger/songwriter Julia Michaels clearly understood this while writing \"Anxiety,\" a cut from Melancholic Mood featuring Selena Gomez. \"My friends, they wanna take me to the movies,\" she sings. \"I tell 'em to f*** off/ I'm holding hands with my depression.\"\n\n\"For the first year [of mass success], I was having panic attacks, I was hiding in hallways, I was running away, people couldn't find me,\" Michaels told Billboard in 2019. Which, she explains, is often hidden in artists behind glitzy promotional machinery.\n\n\"You don't see the photoshoots and the interviews and the flying all the time and the being away from everyone and everything you love,\" she continued. But thanks to \"Anxiety,\" the entire planet saw her clearly.\n\nJessica Darrow, \"Surface Pressure\" (from Encanto) (2021)\n\nThe hit Disney flick Encanto treated viewers to a nuanced take on Latine family dynamics, and \"Surface Pressure\" — written by Lin-Manuel Miranda as the character Luisa's solo — captures bluster that obfuscates insecurity.\n\n\"I'm the strong one, I'm not nervous/ I'm as tough as the crust of the Earth is,\" it begins. But then Miranda's tune cracks that facade: \"Under the surface/ I feel berserk as a tightrope walker in a three-ring circus.\"\n\nThe strength and incisiveness of \"Surface Pressure\" speaks to what makes certain Disney and Pixar films special — despite being marketed to children, they speak to universal human truths.\n\nRead More: From Encanto To \"Euphoria\" And Grand Theft Auto V: Behind The Making Of A Great Soundtrack\n\nJimmie Allen, \"Untitled Song\" (2022)\n\nCountry star Jimmie Allen's trajectory may have led him to a GRAMMY nomination, but it was flecked with difficulties and hardship. Specifically, he was diagnosed with bipolar disorder as a young teen, and the isolation of the COVID-19 pandemic didn't help at all.\n\nBut Allen hasn't just come to terms with this reality — he's made it public so that he might help others in his boat. On April 19, he posted a performance of an unreleased and untitled song, about \"pain [that] pulls me apart like a ripped-up floor\" and feeling \"always on the edge.\"\n\n\"I wrote this song about how I feel a lot of the time,\" Allen tweeted. \"Mental illness is something I have struggled with my entire life.\"\n\nOf course, he's far from alone. But as always, music is one of our most precious gifts to bridge those divides and forge those missing connections — and, consequently, let the light in.\n\nMeet Question, A Rapper/Producer Who Doesn't Want To Be Boxed In By Blindness\n\nAs the train of Beatles remixes and expansions — solo or otherwise — chugs along, a fair question might come to mind: why John Lennon's Mind Games, and why now?\n\nWhen you consider some agreed-upon classics — George Harrison's Living in the Material World, Ringo Starr's Ringo — it might seem like it skipped the line. Historically, fans and critics have rarely made much of Mind Games, mostly viewing it as an album-length shell for its totemic title track.\n\nThe 2020 best-of Lennon compilation Gimme Some Truth: The Ultimate Mixes featured \"Mind Games,\" \"Out the Blue,\" and \"I Know (I Know),\" which is about right — even in fanatical Lennon circles, few other Mind Games tracks get much shine. It's hard to imagine anyone reaching for it instead of Plastic Ono Band, or Imagine, or even the controversial, semi-outrageous Some Time in New York City.\n\nGranted, these largely aren't A-tier Lennon songs — but still, the album's tepid reputation has little to do with the material. The original Mind Games mix is, to put it charitably, muddy — partly due to Lennon's insecurity about his voice, partly just due to that era of recordmaking.\n\nThe fourth-best Picasso is obviously still worth viewing. But not with an inch of grime on your glasses.\n\nThe Standard Deluxe Edition. Photo courtesy of Universal Music Group\n\nThat's all changed with Mind Games: The Ultimate Collection — a fairly gobsmacking makeover of the original album, out July 12. Turns out giving it this treatment was an excellent, long-overdue idea — and producer Sean Ono Lennon, remixers Rob Stevens, Sam Gannon and Paul Hicks were the best men for the job. Outtakes and deconstructed \"Elemental\" and \"Elements\" mixes round out the boxed set.\n\nIt's not that Mind Games: The Ultimate Collection reveals some sort of masterpiece. The album's still uneven; it was bashed out at New York's Record Plant in a week, and it shows. But that's been revealed to not be its downfall, but its intrinsic charm. As you sift through the expanded collection, consider these reasons you should give Mind Games another shot.\n\nThe Songs Are Better Than You Remember\n\nWill deep cuts like \"Intuition\" or \"Meat City\" necessarily make your summer playlist? Your mileage may vary. However, a solid handful of songs you may have written off due to murky sonics are excellent Lennon.\n\nWith a proper mix, \"Aisumasen (I'm Sorry)\" absolutely soars — it's Lennon's slow-burning, Smokey Robinson-style mea culpa to Yoko Ono. \"Bring On the Lucie (Freda Peeple)\" has a rickety, communal \"Give Peace a Chance\" energy — and in some ways, it's a stronger song than that pacifist classic.\n\nAnd on side 2, the mellow, ruminative \"I Know (I Know)\" and \"You Are Here\" sparkle — especially the almost Mazzy Star-like latter tune, with pedal steel guitarist \"Sneaky\" Pete Kleinow (of Flying Burrito Brothers fame) providing abundant atmosphere.\n\nAnd, of course, the agreed-upon cuts are even better: \"Mind Games\" sounds more celestial than ever. And the gorgeous, cathartic \"Out the Blue\" — led by David Spinozza's classical-style playing, with his old pal Paul McCartney rubbing off on the melody — could and should lead any best-of list.\n\nThe Performances Are Killer\n\nPart of the fun of Mind Games: The Ultimate Collection is realizing how great its performances are. They're not simply studio wrapping paper; they capture 1970s New York's finest session cats at full tilt.\n\nThose were: Kleinow, Spinozza, keyboardist Ken Ascher, bassist Gordon Edwards, drummer Jim Keltner (sometimes along with Rick Marotta), saxophonist Michael Brecker, and backing vocalists Something Different.\n\nAll are blue-chip; the hand-in-glove rhythm section of Edwards and Keltner is especially captivating. (Just listen to Edwards' spectacular use of silence, as he funkily weaves through that title track.)\n\nThe hardcover book included in Mind Games: The Ultimate Collection is replete with the musicians' fly-on-the-wall stories from that week at the Record Plant.\n\n\"You can hear how much we're all enjoying playing together in those mixes,\" Keltner says in the book, praising Spinozza and Gordon. \"If you're hearing John Lennon's voice in your headphones and the great Kenny Ascher playing John's chords on the keys, there's just no question of where you're going and how you're going to get there.\"\n\nIt Captures A Fascinating Moment In Time\n\n\"Mind Games to me was like an interim record between being a manic political lunatic to back to being a musician again,\" Lennon stated, according to the book. \"It's a political album or an introspective album. Someone told me it was like Imagine with balls, which I liked a lot.\"\n\nThis creative transition reflects the upheaval in Lennon's life at the time. He no longer had Phil Spector to produce; Mind Games was his first self-production. He was struggling to stay in the country, while Nixon wanted him and his message firmly out.\n\nPlus, Lennon recorded it a few months before his 18-month separation from Ono began — the mythologized \"Lost Weekend\" that was actually a creatively flourishing time. All of this gives the exhaustive Mind Games: The Ultimate Collection historical weight, on top of listening pleasure.\n\n\"[It's important to] get as complete a revealing of it as possible,\" Stevens, who handled the Raw Studio Mixes, tells GRAMMY.com. \"Because nobody's going to be able to do it in 30 years.\"\n\nJohn Lennon and Yoko Ono in Central Park, 1973. Photo: Bob Gruen\n\nMoments Of Inspired Weirdness Abound\n\nFour seconds of silence titled the \"Nutopian International Anthem.\" A messy slab of blues rock with refrains of \"Fingerlickin', chicken-pickin'\" and \"Chickin-suckin', mother-truckin'.\" The country-fried \"Tight A$,\" basically one long double entendre.\n\nTo put it simply, you can't find such heavy concentrates of Lennonesque nuttiness on more commercial works like Imagine. Sometimes the outliers get under your skin just the same.\n\nRead more: We've Thrown Everything We Could At John Lennon's \"Imagine.\" The Song Nonetheless Endures 50 Years Later.\n\nIt's Never Sounded Better\n\n\"It's a little harsh, a little compressed,\" Stevens says of the original 1973 mix. \"The sound's a little bit off-putting, so maybe you dismiss listening to it, in a different head. Which is why the record might not have gotten its due back then.\"\n\nAs such, in 2024 it's revelatory to hear Edwards' basslines so plump, Keltner's kick so defined, Ascher's lines so crystalline. When Spinozza rips into that \"Aisumasen\" solo, it absolutely penetrates. And, as always with these Lennon remixes, the man's voice is prioritized, and placed front and center. It doesn't dispose of the effects Lennon insecurely desired; it clarifies them.\n\n\"I get so enthusiastic,\" Ascher says about listening to Mind Games: The Ultimate Collection. \"I say, 'Well, that could have been a hit. This could have been a hit. No, this one could have been a hit, this one.\" Yes is the answer.\n\nThroughout his ongoing Got Back tour, Paul McCartney has reliably opened with \"Can't Buy Me Love.\"\n\nIt's not the Beatles' deepest song, nor their most beloved hit — though a hit it was. But its zippy, rollicking exuberance still shines brightly; like the rest of the oldies on his setlist, the 82-year-old launches into it in its original key. For two minutes and change, we're plunged back into 1964 — and all the humor, melody, friendship and fun the Beatles bestowed with A Hard Day's Night.\n\nThis week in 1964 — at the zenith of Beatlemania, after their seismic appearance on \"The Ed Sullivan Show\" — the planet received Richard Lester's silly, surreal and innovative film of that name. Days after, its classic soundtrack dropped — a volley of uber-catchy bangers and philosophical ballads, and the only Beatles LP to solely feature Lennon-McCartney songs.\n\nAs with almost everything Beatles, the impact of the film and album have been etched in stone. But considering the breadth of pop culture history in its wake, Fab disciples can always use a reminder. Here are six things that wouldn't be the same without A Hard Day's Night.\n\nAll Music Videos, Forever\n\nRight from that starting gun of an opening chord, A Hard Day's Night's camerawork alone — black and white, inspired by French New Wave and British kitchen sink dramas — pioneers everything from British spy thrillers to \"The Monkees.\"\n\nAcross the film's 87 minutes, you're viscerally dragged into the action; you tumble through the cityscapes right along with John, Paul, George, and Ringo. Not to mention the entire music video revolution; techniques we think of as stock were brand-new here.\n\nAccording to Roger Ebert: \"Today when we watch TV and see quick cutting, hand-held cameras, interviews conducted on the run with moving targets, quickly intercut snatches of dialogue, music under documentary action and all the other trademarks of the modern style, we are looking at the children of A Hard Day's Night.\"\n\nEmergent Folk-Rock\n\nGeorge Harrison's 12-string Rickenbacker didn't just lend itself to a jangly undercurrent on the A Hard Day's Night songs; the shots of Harrison playing it galvanized Roger McGuinn to pick up the futuristic instrument — and via the Byrds, give the folk canon a welcome jolt of electricity.\n\nEntire reams of alternative rock, post-punk, power pop, indie rock, and more would follow — and if any of those mean anything to you, partly thank Lester for casting a spotlight on that Rick.\n\nRead more: Living Legends: Roger McGuinn On The History Of The Byrds, His One-Man Show And Editing His Own Wikipedia Page\n\nThe Ultimate Love Triangle Jam\n\nFrom the Byrds' \"Triad\" to Leonard Cohen's \"Famous Blue Raincoat,\" music history is replete with odes to love triangles.\n\nBut none are as desperate, as mannish, as garment-rending, as Derek and the Dominoes' \"Layla,\" where Eric Clapton lays bare his affections for his friend Harrison's wife, Pattie Boyd. Where did Harrison meet her? Why, on the set of A Hard Day's Night, where she was cast as a schoolgirl.\n\nDebates, Debates, Debates\n\nSay, what is that famous, clamorous opening chord of A Hard Day's Night's title track? Turns out YouTube's still trying to suss that one out.\n\n\"It is F with a G on top, but you'll have to ask Paul about the bass note to get the proper story,\" Harrison told an online chat in 2001 — the last year of his life.\n\nA Certain Strain Of Loopy Humor\n\nNo wonder Harrison got in with Monty Python later in life: the effortlessly witty lads were born to play these roles — mostly a tumble of non sequiturs, one-liners and daffy retorts. (They were all brought up on the Goons, after all.) When A Hard Day's Night codified their Liverpudlian slant on everything, everyone from the Pythons to Tim and Eric received their blueprint.\n\nThe Legitimacy Of The Rock Flick\n\nWhat did rock 'n' roll contribute to the film canon before the Beatles? A stream of lightweight Elvis flicks? Granted, the Beatles would churn out a few headscratchers in its wake — Magical Mystery Tour, anyone? — but A Hard Day's Night remains a game-changer for guitar boys on screen.\n\nThe best part? The Beatles would go on to change the game again, and again, and again, in so many ways. Don't say they didn't warn you — as you revisit the iconic A Hard Day's Night.\n\nExplore The World Of The Beatles\n\nThe first New Music Friday of the summer delivers us fresh jams packed with exciting collaborations and debuts.\n\nThis week features releases from big name, genre-crossing collaborations, including Ariana Grande's remix of \"the boy is mine\" with Brandy and Monica, and Post Malone teaming up with Blake Shelton on their new track \"Pour Me a Drink.\" As you build your new summer playlist, make sure you don't miss out on these ten must-hear tunes.\n\nIce Spice — \"Phat Butt\"\n\nAfter a massive year with the release of her EP Like..? and four nominations at the 2024 GRAMMYs, Ice Spice is ready to level up once again with her newest single, \"Phat Butt.\" With self-assured lyricism on top of a classic drill beat that is true to her sound, the track serves as the second single to be released from her debut album, Y2K!. \"Phat Butt\" comes as both a message to those who lacked belief in Ice Spice’s music career, but also as a quintessential summer anthem.\n\nIn the self-directed music video, the rapper is shown performing in front of a wall of graffiti with grainy video filters, emphasizing the Y2K feel. Ice Spice is set to take on her Y2K World Tour next month and it's no doubt that this \"Phat Butt\" will be a highlight on her setlist.\n\nExplore More: The Rise Of Ice Spice: How The \"Barbie World\" Rapper Turned Viral Moments Into A Full-On Franchise\n\nAriana Grande, Brandy, & Monica — \"the boy is mine (remix)\"\n\nWhen asking different groups who sings the song \"the boy is mine,\" you're likely to get two answers. Some will say pop star Ariana Grande, while others will think of the original 1998 R&B hit by Brandy and Monica, which won the GRAMMY for Best R&B Performance By A Duo Or Group With Vocal in 1999. Doubling down on the shared name of the track and bridging the generational gap among music lovers, Grande, Brandy, and Monica have come together for a fresh remix of \"the boy is mine,\" and the internet couldn't be more ecstatic.\n\n\"My deepest and sincerest thank you to Brandy and Monica, not only for joining me for this moment, but for your generosity, your kindness, and for the countless ways in which you have inspired me,\" said Grande in an Instagram post announcing the collaboration. \"This is in celebration of you both and the impact that you have had on every vocalist, vocal producer, musician, artist that is creating today.\"\n\nRead More: 5 Takeaways From Ariana Grande's New Album Eternal Sunshine\n\nPost Malone & Blake Shelton — \"Pour Me a Drink\"\n\nPost Malone has been dipping his toes into the country genre for some time now and fans have been anxiously awaiting his promised western era post Cowboy Carter.\n\nMalone and Shelton first ignited excitement with a sneak peek of their song, \"Pour Me a Drink\" at the CMA Fest earlier this month.

The song, backed by a thumping mid-tempo instrumental, vividly narrates the transformative experience of being deeply influenced by someone in a relationship and not wanting to return to who you were before. The 18-track project features diverse and vibrant collaborations with unexpected guests like the Jonas Brothers and Ava Max.\n\nMaren Morris & Julia Michaels — \"cut!\"\n\nMaren Morris and Julia Michaels, GRAMMY-winners both independently renowned for their iconic music collaborations, are now joining forces to release their electrifying new track, \"cut!\" The duo has been working together for a few years, with Michaels' co-writing Morris' \"Circles Around Town,\" which received a nomination for Best Country Song at the 2023 GRAMMYs. So, while this collaboration might not come as a surprise, it is still certainly a welcomed one.\n\nAfter a two-year hiatus from releasing music, pop enthusiasts have been eagerly anticipating Morris' return to the spotlight. \"Can't wait to cathartically scream f*ck at the top of our lungs together,\" Morris said in an Instagram post announcing the track.\n\nLearn More: Behind Julia Michaels' Hits: From Working With Britney & Bieber To Writing For Wish\n\nGracie Abrams — 'The Secret of Us'\n\nBuilding on the success of her debut album, Good Riddance, and the skyrocketing momentum of her career after opening The Eras Tour, California-native Gracie Abrams has unveiled her much-anticipated sophomore album, The Secret of Us.\n\nThe album includes the track, \"Close to You,\" which was released ahead of the album drop as the full realization of a 20-second snippet that Abrams posted on Instagram back in 2018.

The release of his newest track, \"F**k The Rap Game\" addresses the phenomenon of getting caught up in the glitz and glamor of the entertainment business, tying in the importance of staying true to one's roots. The Atlanta-raised artist is currently on tour with rapper Russ, with whom he recently released the single \"Workin On Me,” another nod to 6LACK's ongoing mission of self-reflection and deep introspection.\n\n“A better me equals a better you equals a better us. That’s been the formula of my life. I can’t thrive unless I’m around people who are constantly trying to better themselves as individuals,” 6LACK said in an interview with GRAMMY.com last year. “It took a second of me really looking at myself in the mirror, being honest and saying: I am not doing as much work on myself as I claim to be doing and want to be doing on myself.”\n\nRead More: 6lack On His Comeback Album SIHAL: \"I’m Playing A Different Game\"\n\nThe Joy — 'The Joy'\n\nMonths after their buzzworthy performance with Doja Cat at Coachella, South African quintet The Joy has released their self-titled album through Transgressive Records. The album was recorded live, in real time, at Church Studios in London and features no instruments or overdubs — just pure, raw vocals that capture the group's authentic sound.\n\nThe Joy came together through a serendipitous twist of fate. Years back, five boys arrived early to their school choir practice and decided to have an impromptu jam session. Realizing their undeniable musical chemistry, The Joy was born, quickly garnering global acclaim. \"They are, like, my favorite group,\" Jennifer Hudson exclaimed on her talk show.\n\nSurfaces — 'good morning'\n\nKnown for their feel-good tunes that took over TikTok in 2019, Surfaces presents their sixth album, Good Morning. In tracks like, “Real Estate,” the band chronicles the idea of exploring one’s mind and thoughts, above all other features, backed by a tropical lo-fi instrumental, as well as a steady thump of a bass, and trilling trumpets.\n\n“’Real Estate’ is about the infatuation with that place in someone’s mind that you can’t get enough of,” Surfaces explained in a press statement. “It’s a familiar place to call home that feels safe and deserves all the love in the world. We wanted to capture the bliss of finding that space and reveling in it.”\n\nLauren Watkins — 'The Heartbroken Record'\n\nLauren Watkins has a packed summer schedule, which includes opening for country artist Morgan Wallen and releasing her second studio album, The Heartbroken Record. This project draws inspiration from music industry veterans like Willie Nelson and Waylon Jennings, while also infusing influences from contemporary artists like Kacey Musgraves and Miranda Lambert. Each track from the album underscores stories of love and loss, woven together by the overarching theme of heartbreak.\n\n\"I didn't want to just put an album out — I wanted it to be purposeful,\" Watkins said in a press statement. \"It's the past several years of my life, and that was just so much heartbreak and dramatic girl-feelings, but I think in a really deep and relatable way… and it just needs to get off my chest.\"\n\nWhy 2024 Is The Year Women In Country Music Will Finally Have Their Moment"
