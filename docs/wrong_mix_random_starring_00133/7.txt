The Nobel Committee has been handing out the Nobel Prize in Literature since 1901. Who, if anyone, shall receive the award is decided by the Swedish Academy annually according to the dictates of the 1895 will of Alfred Nobel.

Winners can come from any country but must have “produced the most outstanding work in an idealistic direction.” The award is based on an author’s body of work as a whole but sometimes a particularly noteworthy individual work propels an author to the top of the Nobel Committee’s list.
