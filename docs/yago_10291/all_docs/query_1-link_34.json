        "text": "Marshall Brickman and Rick Elice will write the screenplay for the movie version of Jersey Boys, according to a report on Deadline.com. The news of their team’s involvement with the project comes with the announcement that Graham King’s GK Films has secured the feature film rights to the show, which continues to play Broadway’s August Wilson Theatre, with additional productions in Las Vegas, London, and on national tour.\n\nThe musical is based on the life story of Frankie Valli and The Four Seasons, and chronicles the lives of a group of blue-collar boys from the wrong side of the tracks who became one of the biggest American pop music sensations of all time. The show features dozens of the group’s popular hits, including “Walk Like a Man,” “Sherry,” “Big Girls Don’t Cry,” “Oh What a Night,” and “Can’t Take My Eyes Off of You.”"
