        "meta_description": "It’s time to put one of Woody Allen’s “early, funny ones” to the test. SLEEPER presents a zany 1973 vision of the future, with Allen playing a health-food store owner who’s cryogenically frozen and wakes up 200 years later in a police state. He winds up on the run with Diane Keaton’s socialite, the plot involves cloning, and there’s an orgasmatron. Allen has said this farce was inspired in part by Groucho Marx and Bob Hope, and it’s more slapstick heavy than his later films. Upon its release Roger Ebert wrote, “SLEEPER establishes Woody Allen as the best comic director and actor in America,” and the American Film Institute ranked it No. 80 on its all-time-best-comedies list. Does this satirical view of the 22nd century hold up? For that matter, does Woody?",
