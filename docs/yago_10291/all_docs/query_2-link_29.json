Mischievous, Paul doesn't take high school seriously, more interested in classmate Jenny (Cynthia Nixon), a burgeoning journalist who takes a liking to the boy's brilliance. Moving into town is John (John Lithgow), a scientist who's perfected a way to refine plutonium, selling his secrets to the government, which has set up a medical laboratory to conduct tests of the powerful green liquid. Eager to date Elizabeth, John tries to win over Paul with his work on laser experiments at the lab, hoping to wow the teen with sights he's already seen. Catching Paul's attention is evidence of radiation pollution on the grounds, soon teaming with Jenny to infiltrate the secured building and steal a plutonium sample. Now in possession of true power, Paul decides to use the goo to create an atomic bomb for the school's science fair, fully aware of the boundaries he's crossing as he perfects his experiment, triggering panic from John and military officials, who mark him as a possible terrorist.\n\nWhile it's not a groundbreaking picture, \"The Manhattan Project\" is the rare movie to take its teen characters seriously, depicting Paul and Jenny as sharp kids who possess unusual comfort with maturity, both blessed with intelligence to help them achieve in an adult world. Brickman scripts the adolescents as miniature adults (they smoke and drink wine), but it works for the film, setting up a battle of wits and experience as Paul tries to mastermind a dangerous experiment for reasons not immediately understood, trying to shut down John's secret laboratory for world health and personal reasons, especially with the scientist moving in on his mom. What's tricky here is a depiction of heroism, as Paul isn't a noble character, displaying a self-serving attitude throughout the feature, prone to pranks at school (albeit ones that require specific chemistry mastery to pull off) and dismissive of adults in positions of power. Collet provides a performance that both endears and repels, complicating Paul in interesting ways, with Brickman exploring the kid's growing arrogance with his doomsday plans, where end game glory often clouds the dangerous reality of the situation.\n\n\"The Manhattan Project\" isn't a glum movie, remaining light on its feet through scenes of discovery, while the medical lab infiltration sequence is a marvel, devoting substantial screen time to Paul and Jenny's elaborate plan of attack, which involves some feminine appeal, Frisbees, an RC truck, lasers and mirrors, and good old-fashioned timing. The screenplay sets everything up neatly, establishing Paul's skill with picking locks and knowledge of electronics, working through the steps of the theft carefully, only indulging absurdity on a few small occasions. \"The Manhattan Project\" eventually moves on to bomb construction, captured with a propulsive montage of Paul and his plans (including the purchase of plastic explosives), assembling pieces of his macabre puzzle through Brickman's pure directorial fluidity, bringing up the energy of the effort, which reaches a peak around the hour mark. It's difficult to describe the picture as lighthearted, but it moves along wonderfully, defining characters and encounters in a bright manner, setting up the war of minds emerging in the second half.\n\nJohn is a terrific counterweight to Paul's actions, finding his deal with the devil coming back to haunt him in the least expected way. Lithgow is convincingly authoritative, but he also plays John's curiosity with Paul, respecting the teen's smarts and defiance. \"The Manhattan Project\" eventually settles into an extended conversation between the characters, debating the necessity of Paul's demonstration and John's corruption, adding a layer of psychological excavation to aid suspense. Brickman loves these personalities and he's generally good with distance, never stooping to preaching or ridiculous emphasis to make his dramatic points understood. \"The Manhattan Project\" certainly indulges in frightfully tense moments, but it also trusts behavioral nuance and great actors, with John Mahoney appearing as a trigger-happy military leader willing to kill Paul to prevent disaster.\n\nThe Manhattan Project Blu-ray, Video Quality\n\nThe AVC encoded image (1.85:1 aspect ratio) presentation remains bright and crisp throughout. Despite its gloomy premise, \"The Manhattan Project\" is actually a colorful picture, with distinct primaries emerging from costuming and home decoration, while more exaggerated hues, including the green goo of the plutonium, registers with precision. Skintones are equally distinct and natural. Detail is healthy, pinpointing location particulars and science displays, making it easy to follow Paul's work, and facial close-ups keep their tense responses to panicky situations, registering subtle changes in fear. Delineation is secure, never lost to solidification. Grain is fine and filmic. Source is clean, without points of damage.\n\nThe Manhattan Project Blu-ray, Audio Quality\n\nThe 2.0 DTS-HD MA sound mix isn't working with an elaborate design, but it captures the general activity of \"The Manhattan Project\" nicely, with sound effects coming through crisply, along with the bustle of lab work and science fair displays. Dialogue exchanges are precise, preserving the volatile dramatic range, never reaching distortive extremes. Scoring needs are supportive with satisfactory instrumentation, taking command when needed.\n\nThe Manhattan Project Blu-ray, Special Features and Extras\n\nA Theatrical Trailer (2:13, SD) is included.\n\nThe Manhattan Project Blu-ray, Overall Score and Recommendation\n\nMaking a wonderful double feature with 1983's \"War Games,\" \"The Manhattan Project\" ultimately leads to its message-minded finale, but Brickman isn't about to slather on condemnation. Instead, he lightly butters the truth with appealingly goofy depictions of science fair geeks and a ticking clock finale, ratcheting up suspense while working in potent reminders of global threat, personal corruption, and scientific tinkering. There are laughs and nail-biting sequences to get the effort across the finish line, with Brickman making sure the film remains as entertaining as it can be while still delivering its intended point of view. \"The Manhattan Project\" is a smart, exciting movie, but that it dares to take its characters seriously is a special achievement, giving the picture welcome texture as it manages raging hormones and nuclear dreams.\n\nNorth America Blu-ray Discussions\n\nTopic\n\nReplies\n\nLast post\n\n• The Manhattan Project (1986) - Kino22Oct 08, 2019\n\nThe Manhattan Project Blu-ray Screenshots\n\nBack to The Manhattan Project Blu-ray »"
