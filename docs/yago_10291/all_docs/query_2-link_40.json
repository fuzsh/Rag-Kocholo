        "text": "Manhattan Project Overview (01:57)\n\nFREE PREVIEW\n\nScientists, engineers and the army teamed up to detonate the first man made atomic explosion. They built an industrial complex with sites across the country. To manufacture fuel for the bomb they built the 5th largest town in the state of Tennessee.\n\nDiscovery of Fission of Uranium (02:38)\n\nWhen Hitler took power the Jews of Europe were under direct threat. Some of the best scientists found refuge at American universities. In 1938 German scientists split the atom. Leó Szilárd sought help from Einstein to warn president Roosevelt.\n\nU.S. Bomb Effort (02:06)\n\nIn response to the Einstein–Szilárd letter, President Roosevelt formed the Advisory Committee on Uranium. This was a low priority during WWII. Together physicists Enrico Fermi and Leó Szilárd tackled the first obstacle to the bomb.\n\nExperiments in Harnessing Uranium Fission (02:19)\n\nThe U.S. declared war on Japan after the attack on Pearl Harbor. America's entry into the war had a galvanizing effect on its atomic bomb effort. FDR approved production of the weapon and turned the nuclear effort over to the U.S. Army.\n\nUranium 235 (02:04)\n\nThe bomb effort went into high gear. Its first priority was the lack of weapons grade fuel. Fission is more readily produced in a rare uranium isotope. Scientists at Columbia University championed gaseous diffusion.\n\nNuclear Research and Design Facility (02:36)\n\nGrove selected a bomb design site in Los Alamos, New Mexico. In November of 1942 the army purchased 54,000 acres under the guise of using them as a demolition range. J. Robert Oppenheimer was chosen to head up the installation.\n\nElectromagnetic Calutrons (03:48)\n\nOn December 28, 1942 FDR approved an additional investment in the Manhattan Project. The first priority was to build the massive facilities to produce the fissionable material to fuel the atom bomb. The town of Oak Ridge continued to grow.\n\nAtomic Bomb Design (02:50)\n\nIn Los Alamos, design work was underway on \"the gadget' as the test bomb came to be known. The main obstacle was how to quickly assemble two smaller subcritical masses into one larger explosive. Plutonium gained favor as a possible fuel.\n\nManhattan Project K-25 Site (03:58)\n\nGroves began construction on a gigantic gaseous diffusion plant to provide weapons grade fuel for the atomic bomb. By the end of WWII Oak Ridge was the 5th largest town in Tennessee. Plutonium was proving to be tricky.\n\nUranium Gun Bomb Weapon Design (02:20)\n\nDesigners considered a test prior to combat use unnecessary and impossible since there was only enough U235 for one bomb. The design for the more complicated plutonium fueled implosion device was approved and a test was scheduled.\n\nPreparation for Trinity Device Test (02:38)\n\nOn July 16, 1945 in the New Mexico desert, scientists and dignitaries awaited the results of the first test of an atomic weapon. Most feared a dud while others feared it would destroy the universe.\n\nTrinity Device Test (02:44)\n\nOn the morning of July 16, 1945 the world entered the atomic age. The bomb test completely vaporized the steel tower and heated the desert sand into glass. Preparations began for the use of the device against Japan. The bomb remained untested.\n\nScheduled Assault on Japan (02:11)\n\nIn June of 1945 150 Manhattan Project scientists signed a petition calling for a demonstration of the atomic bomb prior to its use against Japan. There was strong support for the bomb at high levels of government and military.\n\nHiroshima and Nagasaki (03:47)\n\nGeneral Groves chose populated Japanese cities as potential targets to demonstrate the bomb's destructive power and end the war as quickly as possible. On August 6, 1945 the Enola Gay dropped the first atomic bomb.\n\nLegacy of the Manhattan Project (04:26)\n\nIn 1949 the Soviets detonated an atomic bomb. During the 1950s both super powers added the hydrogen bomb to their arsenals. Oppenheimer did not agree that the arms race represented progress. His security clearance was revoked.\n\nCredits: Modern Marvels: Manhattan Project (00:56)\n\nCredits: Modern Marvels: Manhattan Project"
