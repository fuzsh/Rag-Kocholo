        "text": "WITH the movie of “Dreamgirls” about to be released – and getting fantastic word of mouth – can a big-screen version of an other Broadway blockbuster about a famous singing group be far off?\n\nSteven Spielberg is said to be in hot pursuit of the movie rights to “Jersey Boys,” the musical about Frankie Valli and the Four Seasons. He’s seen the show and is known to be a huge fan of the music, the era and the expertly constructed script by Rick Elice and Marshall Brickman.\n\nBut Spielberg isn’t the only Hollywood mogul in the hunt. Harvey Weinstein and Tom Hanks, as well as execs from Disney and Warner Bros. have all been spotted at the August Wilson Theatre in recent months.\n\n“There’s been a crowd in the lobby with makeup on,” jokes Brickman.\n\nThere’s a rumor that Des McAnuff, who staged the musical, has a contract that gives him first crack at directing the movie. Brickman says that’s not the case, though he’d be happy to have McAnuff on board.\n\nBut could he say “no” to Spielberg, who, sources say, wants to produce and direct?\n\n“In a word – no,” says Brickman. “But I don’t know whether he feels this is his metier.”\n\nElice and Brickman, who won acclaim this year for their book, would certainly do the screenplay. Neither is a stranger to Hollywood. Elice has worked on several Disney movies and Brickman co-wrote “Annie Hall” and “Manhattan” and wrote and directed the underrated “Simon.”\n\nThey’re actively involved in the movie sale and will probably have final say about how the deal shakes down.\n\nThere are two schools of thought about the best time to make the movie sale.\n\nThe traditional view is that “Jersey Boys” will be worth even more in Hollywood once touring companies have been rolled out around the world.\n\nBrickman says that the creators of “Jersey Boys” have decided “not to entertain any offers for a while, so that we don’t cannibalize the potential of the thing theatrically.”\n\nBut a maverick theater insider says the time for a sale is right now. With “Dreamgirls” poised to be the next “Chicago,” the creators of “Jersey Boys” should strike while the iron’s hot.\n\nWhat could “Jersey Boys” fetch in Hollywood?\n\nExperts say anywhere from $2 million to $5 million, with a large share of the gross box-office receipts going to the creators.\n\n“However it works out, it’s going to be a large payday,” says a source.\n\n“Jersey Boys” isn’t the only Broadway show that’s captured Hollywood’s attention. Weinstein has his eye on “Gypsy,” arguably the greatest musical of all time. Rob Marshall (“Chicago”) would direct, with either Meryl Streep or Barbra Streisand starring as Momma Rose and Catherine Zeta-Jones playing Rose’s daughter, Gypsy Rose Lee.\n\nIT’S official: The acclaimed London re vival of Eugene O’Neill’s “A Moon for the Misbegotten” will be the next tenant at the Brooks Atkinson, vacant now that “The Times They Are A-Changin’ ” has shut down.\n\nKevin Spacey, Eve Best (wonderful as a distraught wife in the last installment of “Prime Suspect”) and Colm Meaney will star in the production, which will be directed by Howard Davies and produced by London’s Old Vic Theatre, where Spacey is artistic director.\n\nANDREW Lloyd Webber has a hit in London: His production of “The Sound of Music” opened to rave reviews last week and has racked up advance ticket sales of about $20 million, propelled by Lloyd Webber’s hugely popular reality show, “How Do You Solve a Problem Like Maria?”\n\nExpect Lloyd Webber to make an appearance as a guest judge on NBC’s new reality show “You’re the One That I Want,” in which unknowns audition for the leading roles in the upcoming Broadway revival of “Grease.”"
