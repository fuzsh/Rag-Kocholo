        "text": "Two movies are out this summer about the famous nuclear physicist, J. Robert Oppenheimer. One is an NBC News-produced documentary, “To End All War: Oppenheimer & The Atomic Bomb,’’ streaming on Peacock, and the other, a Universal Pictures feature entitled, “Oppenheimer,’’ is in theaters now.\n\nBoth, in this reporter’s estimation, are interesting and very well done. It’s curious that they are out this year, which has no significant nuclear anniversaries tied to it. But then again, with Vladimir Putin’s threat in Ukraine and his ruminations about using nuclear weapons, and North Korea’s persistence in developing its own rogue nuclear missile program, one could argue that Oppenheimer is very relevant now.\n\nThe main focus of each film is the top-secret Manhattan Project, in operation during WWII in the early 1940s, and the man heading up the $2.2-billion program, Oppenheimer. Under U.S. Army Corps Of Engineers’ General Leslie R. Groves, Oppenheimer and his team of elite scientists were charged with developing a new weapon, an atomic “fission’’ bomb, at Los Alamos, in a remote area of New Mexico.\n\nThe theory behind the bomb, first proposed by Albert Einstein and his famous equation E=mc2, is that mass and energy are interchangeable, and that if a tiny amount of the former were converted to the latter in a sustained chain reaction of unstable elements Uranium 235 or Plutonium 239, it would release tremendous energy. Enough in fact, to destroy in a split second an entire city with a single bomb.\n\nThe reason for the Manhattan Project’s urgency was that Germany’s dictator, Adolf Hitler, was developing an atomic bomb on his own, and we all know what would have happened had the madman gotten it first. A Nobel Prize-winning physicist, Werner Heisenberg, was directing the Nazis’ efforts, so the threat was very real.\n\nThe theatrical movie, directed by Christopher Nolan, uses well-known actors to play the parts of the Manhattan Project’s scientists, military officials and politicians, and includes Robert Downey Jr., Emily Blunt, Matt Damon, Gary Oldman, Matthew Modine and Rami Malek.\n\nThe film, three-hours long, takes viewers through Oppenheimer’s early life in New York and Europe, then back to America at Los Alamos, and finally through the McCarthy trials in Washington, DC. Oppenheimer was ultimately stripped of his security clearance at that infamous witch-hunt in the 1950s because of his early communist affiliations.\n\nIt is a somewhat sad story, but one all-too-common in the U.S. - the taking down of heroes. And Oppenheimer was a hero. As these movies reveal, he was featured on the covers of “Time’’ and “Life’’ for pulling off the frenetic bomb challenge, first by successfully testing the “gadget,’’ as it was called, at the Trinity Site, near Los Alamos, then with assembling the bombs that flattened Japan’s Hiroshima and Nagasaki.\n\nThe shorter NBC production is more of a documentary, utilizing experts in history and science rather than actors. In it are Richard Rhodes, critically-acclaimed author of, “The Making Of The Atomic Bomb,’’ and, “Dark Sun,’’ which focuses on the later, much more powerful hydrogen bomb. Also featured are modern-day physicist Michio Kaku, Bill Nye The Science Guy, Hiroshima bomb survivor Dr. Hideko Tamura, director of the theatrical movie Chris Nolan and Oppenheimer’s grandson Charles.\n\nFor parts of the documentary where archival footage was unavailable, Creative Mammals, a small company in Atlanta, Georgia, was tasked with animating the sequences, which are interspersed throughout the film. Christopher Cassel directed the film, which runs one hour and 27 minutes.\n\nIn separate stories, we will include interviews with, and quotes from, three persons involved with the NBC documentary: Director Cassel, Creative Mammals founder Robert Burroughs and Hiroshima survivor Dr. Tamura.
