        "text": "A former member of the folksinging groups The Tarriers and The Journeymen, Marshall Brickman wrote for television before beginning his highly successful association with Woody Allen. Brickman co-wrote two of Allen's best-loved films, \"Annie Hall\" (1977) and \"Manhattan\" (1979), before branching out on his own with the overlooked, cynical comedy \"Simon\" (1980) and the thoughtful anti-nuclear thriller \"The Manhattan Project\" (1986). It was with \"Candid Camera\" that Brickman broke into TV in 1966, and after a short stay with Allen Funt, moved on to Johnny Carson. Brickman was one of the key writers for \"The Tonight Show\" (NBC, 1966-70) and also participated in the 1969 primetime special \"Johnny Carson's Repertory Company in an Evening of Comedy.\" That same year, he first worked with Woody Allen as one of the writers on Allen's NBC special. In 1970, Brickman moved from Carson to Dick Cavett, writing and producing for Cavett's ABC show through 1972, a period in which the show won several Emmy Awards."
