Events kick off at 6:30 p.m. with a viewing of the documentary, Richland, in the Pajarito Room at Fuller Lodge. The showing, presented by The National Park Service, Friends of MAPR-LA and Los Alamos Arts Council as a part of their Artist in Residence program, features an incredible look between the past and the present and includes insights from nuclear workers, community members, family members of atomic bomb survivors and more. Following the film at 8 p.m., attendees are invited to take part in a silent luminaria viewing in the historic Memorial Rose Garden at Fuller Lodge.\n\n“We invite all to take part in this powerful event, as we honor the lives lost and reflect upon our history so that we may grow from it,” said Ellyn Felton, Marketing Specialist for Los Alamos County.\n\nVisitors will have the opportunity to decorate and place their own luminaria bag at the event. For more information, visit https://www.nps.gov/mapr/learn/los-alamos-lights-for-peace.htm.\n\nFollowing the events, additional showings of Richland will take place on August 9 at Los Alamos Little Theatre and on August 22 at White Rock Branch Library.
