This study will use data from KPNC and Intermountain Healthcare to define patterns of testing, treatment, and outcomes related to troponin in sepsis.\n\nFunder: National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute\n\nInvestigator: Liu, Vincent\n\nFunder: National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute\n\nIdentifying patient subgroups and processes of care that cause outcome differences following ICU vs. ward triage among patients with acute respiratory failure and sepsis\n\nICU vs. ward triage among patients with acute respiratory failure and sepsis\n\nEach year, millions of patients with acute respiratory failure or sepsis present to U.S. emergency departments at high risk for death but without requirements for life support. Admission of these patients to intensive care units or hospital wards varies considerably with hospital capacity strain, and significantly impacts patient outcomes. Using detailed electronic health record data, instrumental variable and mediation analyses, and machine learning, we will identify the subgroups, care processes, and complications of care that account for these triage-related outcomes, thereby promoting personalized triage and better outcomes.\n\nFunder: National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute\n\nInvestigator: Liu, Vincent\n\nFunder: National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute\n\nAIM-HI grant management and collaborative hub\n\nThis grant funds 5 health-system-based prospective evaluations of the implementation of machine-learning-based diagnostic decision support (ML-DDS) algorithms that will be coordinated through the Kaiser Permanente Augmented Intelligence in Medicine and Healthcare Initiative (AIM-HI). A secondary goal of the grant is to create an International Collaboration Hub for Design and Execution of Clinical AI Evaluation Studies.\n\nInvestigator: Liu, Vincent\n\nFunder: Gordon and Betty Moore Foundation\n\nMachine Learning Applied to EHR Data as a Means of Improving Biosurveillance and Diagnostic Excellence: A Pilot Project\n\nWe aim to develop and extend methods of probabilistic modeling of temporal electronic health record (EHR) data, using non-stationary Gaussian processes, hidden Markov models, and composite mixture models, to identify opportunities to conduct clinical biosurveillance and to achieve diagnostic excellence. Building off collaboration between KP DOR and the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory, this proposal will use population-level EHR data, AI/ML methods and advanced computing to evaluate associations between health system diagnostic testing/treatment and prevalent/incident health conditions and to identify areas of potential diagnostic uncertainty.\n\nInvestigator: Liu, Vincent\n\nEvaluation of Risk-Based Predictive Models to Inform the Efficiency of Perioperative Systems\n\nWe previously developed an automated electronic health record-based risk stratification tool, called the Comorbidity Assessment and Surgical Triage (CAST) score, which we implemented in KP HealthConnect to improve triage of elective surgical patients to perioperative medicine clinic visit types in real-time. This project seeks to improve the efficiency of operative workflows by evaluating the impact of CAST implementation on pre-operative workflows and surgical outcomes; characterizing patients with discordant risk assessments between CAST and the clinician; and evaluating the association between CAST and operative resources, including surgical case duration.\n\nInvestigator: Liu, Vincent\n\nFunder: TPMG Delivery Science Projects Program\n\nTurning back the clock on sepsis: Defining the epidemiology and opportunities of pre-sepsis\n\nWe intend to determine the epidemiology of pre-sepsis, including ambulatory and prehospital care settings, to identify modifiable care delays, opportunities for primary sepsis prevention, and to improve early sepsis care for vulnerable populations. The objectives include determining the epidemiology of pre-sepsis care across ambulatory and prehospital settings using linked EHR data; measuring delays in pre-sepsis care; and understanding the patient-level variation in pre-sepsis care and delays in vulnerable populations. The project is a collaboration between KPNC and University of Pittsburgh Medical Center.\n\nInvestigator: Liu, Vincent\n\nFunder: Gordon and Betty Moore Foundation\n\nEffectiveness and safety of treatments for hospitalized patients with COVID-19\n\nExamine the safety and effectiveness of current treatments for hospitalized patients with COVID-19 and identify patient characteristics and time periods during the disease course that are associated with more favorable treatment response.\n\nInvestigator: Liu, Vincent\n\nFunder: Garfield Memorial Fund\n\nUnderstanding and Informing Early Hospital Antibiotic Prescribing for Potential Infection\n\nThe goals of this study are to (1) examine temporal trends in early hospital antibiotic prescribing patterns over the past 5 years, to assess for unintended consequences associated with earlier antibiotics in severe sepsis/septic shock; (2) quantify the patient-level harm associated with receipt of unnecessary antibiotics; and (3) identify subsets of patients, discernable in real-time with high certainty, who benefit from immediate antibiotics, versus the subsets of patients for whom it is safe to delay antibiotics by 3 hours (thereby allowing time for rapid diagnostics, such as procalcitonin).\n\nInvestigator: Liu, Vincent\n\nFunder: Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality\n\nSepsis on FHIR\n\nOverall goal is to define and refine the current epidemiology, clinical characteristics, and treatment practices in respiratory failure in late and moderately preterm infants. Specific aims are to determine that incidence and epidemiology of respiratory failure in neonates born 32-36 weeks of gestation between 2012 and 2017 in Kaiser Permanente Northern California facilities; describe disease severity and respiratory support by diagnostic category; describe use of surfactant replacement therapy; and assess the impact of surfactant replacement therapy on length of respiratory support, length of hospitalization, and respiratory outcomes in the first year of life.\n\nInvestigator: Liu, Vincent\n\nFunder: Moore Foundation\n\nUsing EHR Audit Logs to Capture Diagnostic Pathways and Time to Diagnosis\n\nRapid expansions in the use of electronic health record (EHR) systems also contribute to large expansions in the availability of metadata. These highly granular metadata may prove particularly useful for understanding how frontline clinicians interact with clinical information when making diagnostic decisions. This project aims to characterize EHR audit log data and advance nascent understanding of the potential to leverage these to provide novel insights into the diagnostic process, with a focus on time to diagnosis, and ultimately inform the achievement of diagnostic excellence.\n\nInvestigator: Liu, Vincent\n\nFunder: Gordon and Betty Moore Foundation\n\nTargeting Cardiovascular Events to Improve Patient Outcomes After Sepsis\n\nSepsis is the most common illness leading to hospitalization in the United States, affecting more than 1 million Americans each year. While short-term mortality has improved over prior decades, sepsis survivors face numerous post-hospital sequelae that negatively impact long-term morbidity and mortality. Cardiovascular complications are among the most common reasons for re-hospitalization and death after sepsis, with approximately 1 in 3 severe sepsis patients experiencing a cardiovascular complication in the year after sepsis hospitalization. This project seeks to identify risk factors for post-sepsis cardiovascular risk based on granular inpatient data collected during hospitalization, and identify potential opportunities to reduce post-sepsis cardiovascular risk.\n\nInvestigator: Liu, Vincent\n\nFunder: National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute\n\nBenchmarking Hospital Quality – Template Matching\n\n​In this study, Kaiser Permanente Northern California researchers will serve as consultants for U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) researchers to evaluate the utility of template matching techniques, compared with standard regression techniques, for comparing hospital quality.\n\nInvestigator: Liu, Vincent\n\nFunder: U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs\n\nIdentifying Pre-Sepsis Opportunities for Early, Targeted Intervention\n\nEarly evidence suggests there will be ongoing waves of COVID-19 outbreak that can be mitigated through effective community-level prediction models and intervention. This project will Identify pre-sepsis opportunities for early, targeted intervention to inform community-level mitigation strategies of upcoming COVID19 surges.\n\nInvestigator: Liu, Vincent\n\nFunder: National Institute of General Medical Sciences\n\nBenefits of Intensive Care Unit Admission for Patients with Acute Respiratory Failure or Sepsis\n\nIdeal and optimally efficient use of intensive care unit (ICU) resources would create benefits across the health care system. Ideal use of ICU resources requires a needs assessment to determine which categories of patients commonly admitted to ICUs derive true net benefit on average from ICU admission versus admission to a regular hospital floor. This project aims to conduct such a needs assessment, which has never before been done.\n\nInvestigator: Liu, Vincent\n\nFunder: National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute\n\nData-Driven Precision Medicine in Sepsis\n\nSepsis is a common and costly disease which contributes to nearly 1 in 2 hospital deaths in our healthcare system. While aggressive early treatment with quantitative resuscitation has demonstrated benefit, many other interventions have not demonstrated efficacy likely resulting from an incomplete understanding of sepsis disease mechanisms. This study seeks to address three questions through innovative approaches to using observational data: (1) what factors can improve our characterization and phenotyping of sepsis patients; (2) what are the potential benefits of using quantitative resuscitation in less severe sepsis subgroups; and (3) how does acute organ dysfunction impact long-term mortality and utilization among sepsis survivors\n\nInvestigator: Liu, Vincent\n\nFunder: National Institute of General Medical Sciences"
