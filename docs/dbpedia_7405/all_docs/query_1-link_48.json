        "text": "The Respiratory Care Program at Oregon Institute of Technology (Oregon Tech) will be recognized on July 13, 2015 by the Commission on Accreditation for Respiratory Care (CoARC) as a recipient of the Distinguished Registered Respiratory Therapist (RRT) Credentialing Success Award. The award will be presented at the American Association for Respiratory Care (AARC) Summer Forum in Arizona to recognize Oregon Tech for being among the top 2 percent of respiratory care programs in the United States.\n\nThis award is presented as part of the CoARC’s continued efforts to value the RRT credential as a standard of professional achievement. From a program effectiveness perspective, the CoARC views the RRT credential as a measure of a program’s success in inspiring its graduates to achieve their highest educational and professional aspirations.\n\nIn selecting programs for this recognition, the CoARC Board used objective criteria based on key accreditation metrics documented in the 2014 Annual Report of Current Status (RCS). These programs were required to: (1) have three or more years of outcomes data; (2) hold accreditation without a progress report; (3) document RRT credentialing success of 90% or above, and (4) meet or exceed established CoARC thresholds for CRT credentialing success, attrition and positive (job) placement.\n\n“This award exhibits the dedication and commitment we have in working toward excellence and high student outcomes,” said College of Health, Arts, and Science Dean, LeAnn Maupin. “I am very proud of the work our faculty, students, and graduates have put into meeting this rigorous criteria. It is significant to receive external validation of the high quality standards of our RRT program and how this leads to success for our graduates once they are in the workforce.”\n\nThe Oregon Tech Respiratory Care program has a 97% success rate of students employed within 6 months of graduation, with an average starting salary of $58,000-$60,000. Graduates are employed in hospitals, physician's offices, rehabilitation facilities, home-care agencies and health care promotion centers as caregivers, managers and educators.\n\nFor more information about Oregon Tech’s Respiratory Care program, contact Jeff Pardy, Program Director, at jeff.pardy@oit.edu.\n\nAbout Oregon Tech’s Respiratory Care Program\n\nOregon Tech offers a Bachelor of Science in Respiratory Care at the Klamath Falls campus, as well as an online degree completion program for Registered Respiratory Therapists (RRT).
