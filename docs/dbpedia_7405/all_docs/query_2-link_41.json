        "text": "Help our profession validate staffing needs.\n\nThe AARC is asking each state society to share the SESG Time Standards Data Collection project with their membership. The first society to have 5 new completed surveys submitted within the next 12 days will receive an RC Week bundle featuring this year’s new merchandise.\n\nBy providing procedure time standards, survey participants will power the Safe and Effective Staffing Guide (SESG) with statistically validated data crucial to qualifying and improving RT staffing.\n\nIn an estimated 60-80 minutes, a department director (or a designee) can contribute to the next edition of this invaluable resource, and in doing so, help shape current and future RT staffing practices.\n\nIs Your State on the Map?\n\nSee how many hospitals have already contributed to the Time Standards Data Collection Project using our digital map. Email your members and post on your social channels (suggested wording below). Your contribution helps the entire profession. Reminder: states already on the map are required to add 5 new completed surveys by August 12 to win an RC Week Bundle!\n\nIf you have any questions or need assistance, contact us at (972) 243-2272.\n\nTake the Survey"
