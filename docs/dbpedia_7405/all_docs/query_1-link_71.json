A. John Dalton B. Thomas Graham C. Jacques Charles D. Joseph Louis Gay-Lussac\n\nDevelopment of the Respiratory Care Profession • 1940s: technicians hauled O2 cylinders & apply O2 delivery devices • 1950s: positive-pressure breathing devices applied to patients • 1960s: Formal education programs for inhalation therapists • Development of sophisticated mechanical ventilators in the 1960s expanded role of respiratory therapist (RT)\n\nDevelopment of the Respiratory Care Profession (cont.) RTs responsible for arterial blood gas & pulmonary function laboratories 1974: designation “respiratory therapist” becomes standard Practice of Respiratory Therapy, originally U.S. & Canada now expands globally 1980: Respiratory Care Week established nationally to promote profession & importance of good lung health\n\nHow long after initially applying positive pressure breathing devices to patients did the first sophisticated mechanical ventilator become available, expanding the role of Respiratory Therapists? A. 10 years B. 20 years C. 30 years D. 40 years\n\nDevelopment of the Respiratory Care Profession (cont.) • Oxygen Therapy • 1907: Large-scale production of O2 developed by Karl von Linde. • 1910: Oxygen tents first used • 1918: O2 masks first used • 1940s: O2 therapy widely prescribed\n\nDevelopment of the Respiratory Care Profession (cont.) 1960s: Clark electrode first developed - allows measurement of arterial PO2 1974: Ear oximeter invented 1980s: Pulse oximeter invented 1960: Venti mask to deliver specific FIO2 introduced 1970s: Portable liquid O2 systems for long-term oxygen therapy (LTOT) in home introduced\n\nDevelopment of the Respiratory Care Profession (cont.) • 21st century marks further advances in home oxygen therapy equipment • New equipment introduced for Long Term Oxygen Therapy include: • Oxygen concentrators with pressure booster (allows transfilling in home) • Smaller, lightweight portable oxygen concentrators\n\nDevelopment of the Respiratory Care Profession (cont.) • Aerosol Medications • 1910: aerosolized epinephrine introduced as treatment for asthma • 1940s-1950s: Isoproterenol (1940) & isoetharine (1951) introduced as bronchodilators • 1971s: Aerosolized steroids first used to treat acute asthma\n\nDevelopment of the Respiratory Care Profession (cont.) • Aerosol Medications • 1980: Advances in bronchodilator therapy - Albuterol sulfate introduced & still used today • 2000: Levalbuteral introduced • Newer aerosol medication delivery devices include dry powder inhaler (DPI) • Innovative designs for small volume nebulizers (SVN’s) invented\n\nDevelopment of the Respiratory Care Profession (cont.) • Mechanical Ventilation • 1928: Iron lung introduced by Philip Drinker • 1940s-1950s: Jack Emerson develops improved version of iron lung used for polio victims • 1950s: Negative-pressure “wrap” ventilator introduced\n\nDevelopment of the Respiratory Care Profession\n\nMechanical Ventilation Originally, positive-pressure ventilation used during anesthesia The Drager Pulmotor (1911), Spiropulsator (1934), the Bennett TV-2P (1948) & Bird Mark 7 (1958) were positive-pressure ventilators Bennett MA-1, Ohio 560, & Engstrom 300 were introduced in 1960s as volume-cycled ventilators.\n\nDevelopment of the Respiratory Care Profession\n\nDevelopment of the Respiratory Care Profession\n\nMechanical Ventilation (cont.) More advanced volume ventilators became available in 1970s: Servo 900, Bourns Bear I & II, & MA II First microprocessor-controlled ventilators developed in 1980s (Bennett 7200) Ventilators with capability of applying advanced modes of ventilation became available in 21st century Due to use of endotracheal tube, mechanical ventilation increases risk for ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) Non-invasive ventilation, when applicable, can prevent this risk.\n\nAll of the following are true about ventilator associated pneumonia (VAP), except: A. it can occur in both mechanically ventilated & spontaneously breathing patients B. death is a potential risk of VAP C. non-invasive ventilation may be used to avoid VAP D. there are very costly consequences when a patient acquires VAP\n\nAirway Management 1980: William MacEwen successfully applied first endotracheal tube to patient 1913: laryngoscope introduced 1941: First suction catheter described 1970s: Low-pressure cuffs for endotracheal tubes introduced\n\nCardiopulmonary Diagnostics 1800: Measurement of lung’s residual volume first performed 1846: first water-sealed spirometer developed by John Hutchinson 1967: rapid arterial blood gas analysis becomes available 1980s: Polysomnography becomes routine\n\nProfessional Organizations Inhalation Therapy Association (ITA) founded in 1947 ITA became American Association for Inhalation Therapists (AAIT) founded in 1954 AAIT became American Association for Respiratory Therapy (AART) founded 1973 AART became American Association for Respiratory Care (AARC) founded in 1982\n\nProfessional Organizations (cont.) 1980s: state licensure for RTs begins State licensure based on RTs passing entry level exam offered by National Board for Respiratory Care (NBRC) NBRC offers certification & registry examination for RTs State licensing laws set minimum educational requirements & determine competence to practice State licensing boards also set required amount of continuing education credits (CEU’s) required to keep license to practice\n\nWhich of the following sets the minimum educational requirements & the method of determining competence to practice Respiratory Care? A. AARC B. BOMA C. State licensing laws D. NBRC\n\nRespiratory Care Education • Due to aging population(baby boomers): • Increased demand for RC services & RT’s • As baby boomers age: • More will have asthma, COPD, & other cardiopulmonary diseases • As treatments & technology continue to advance: • RT’s will require more educational preparation\n\nRespiratory Care Education • RT’s of future will focus more on: • Prevention • Protocol administration • Care plan development • Disease management & rehabilitation • Family & patient education • Tobacco cessation counseling\n\nFuture of Respiratory Care • “2015 & Beyond”—Special task force created by AARC • Formed in 2007 as AARC recognized impending overhaul of U.S. healthcare system • Task—to envision potential roles & responsibilities of RT by 2015 & beyond • 3 strategic conferences held: 2008, 2009, 2010\n\nFuture of Respiratory Care (cont.) • Aim: to answer 5 questions about future of profession: • How patients will receive health care services • How respiratory care services will be provided • Knowledge, skills, attributes needed by RT’s • Educational & credentialing systems necessary • How to transition with little impact on practicing RT’s"
