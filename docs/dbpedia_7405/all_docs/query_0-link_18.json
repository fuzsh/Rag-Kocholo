It covers the pathophysiology and treatment of diseases that affect the respiratory system, as well as topics of fundamental importance to the practice of pulmonary, critical care, and sleep medicine. It was established in March 1917 as the American Review of Tuberculosis.[1] Since then there have been several title changes. In 1953 a subtitle was added, \"A Journal of Pulmonary Diseases.\" In 1955 the title became the American Review of Tuberculosis and Pulmonary Diseases, and in 1959 the American Review of Respiratory Diseases (the final \"s\" was dropped in 1966).[1] The journal obtained its current title in 1994.[1]\n\nThe journal was established by the National Tuberculosis Association, which became the American Lung Association, and which published the journal from 1917 until 1994 when its medical section, the American Thoracic Society, became the publisher.[2]\n\nEditors\n\n[edit]\n\nThe following persons are or have been editor-in-chief of the journal:\n\nAbstracting and indexing\n\n[edit]\n\nThe journal is abstracted and indexed in:\n\nAccording to the Journal Citation Reports, the journal has a 2022 impact factor of 24.7, ranking it 2nd out of 36 journals in the category \"Critical Care Medicine\" and 2nd out of 64 journals in the category \"Respiratory System\".[15]\n\nReferences\n\n[edit]\n\nFurther reading\n\n[edit]\n\nAbraham, E (2005). \"The AJRCCM in 2005\".
