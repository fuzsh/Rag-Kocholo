        "text": "The Rise of Anesthesia, 1800-1920\n\nToday, most medical procedures are designed to be as painless as possible for the patient. But this was not the case before October 16, 1846. “Ether Day” commemorated William Thomas Green’s use of an inhaled anesthetic in a dental surgical procedure.\n\nEther, or “sweet oil of vitriol,” was first synthesized by Valerius Cordus in 1540. Joseph Priestley discovered nitrous oxide or “laughing gas” in 1772 and its use in surgery was first suggested as early as 1800. However, these compounds were primarily used for entertainment or recreational purposes until the 1840s, when both were used in dental procedures. The goal was to relieve pain and help patients recover quickly from the effects of the compounds.\n\nAfter Louis Pasteur brought forth his “germ theory” in 1865 and antisepsis became routine, more complex and lengthy surgeries began to be performed. These developments required changes to inhaled anesthetic procedures and compounds.\n\nThe Oxygen Era and Birth of a Profession, 1900-1940\n\nMuch like ether and nitrous oxide, oxygen therapy began as a recreational past-time in Germany in the 1770s. It was used sporadically for medicinal purposes through the mid-19th century and was advertised as a “cure all” treatment.\n\nIn 1900, Dr. Albert Blodgett attempted the first recorded application of continuous administration of oxygen on a 46-year-old female patient with pneumonia. The goal was to alleviate symptoms of suffocation in her final hours, but surprisingly she was able to continue to breathe and eventually recovered.\n\nBy 1928, oxygen’s positive effects on survival rates were identified. Transporting, monitoring, administering, and cleaning of equipment used in oxygen treatments were added to the duties of nurses and then nursing assistants. Primitive regulators without gauges made it difficult to determine if the tanks were full. By the 1940s, technicians were employed specifically to handle the oxygen therapy required by patients. This was the first segmentation of a respiratory therapy-focused specialty in healthcare.\n\nMechanical Ventilation and The Iron Lung, 1940-1955\n\nMechanical ventilation originated in the 17th century when scientist Robert Hooke demonstrated that the damaged lungs of a dog could continue to function with the application of a bellows to blow air directly into them. Still, positive pressure breathing devices did not become available until 1900. The development of the well-known intensive care unit ventilator did not begin until 1940.\n\nThe most common image of assisted breathing technology in the 20th century was the tank respirator, commonly called “the iron lung.” Rising to prominence in treating patients with poliomyelitis, the iron lung’s development can be traced to 1927 at Harvard University. Seeing that one in every 200 patients infected with the polio virus suffered some type of paralysis—including of the respiratory system—Philip Brinker and Louis Agassiz Shaw developed a machine that could do the breathing for the patient. The positive and negative pressures squeeze the patient’s body for exhalation and relax for inhalation, thereby allowing the patient to breathe.\n\nIn 1952, 52,628 cases of polio were reported in the United States alone. With the advent of vaccinations in the 1950s and 60s, polio cases declined, and the virus was eventually eradicated. Iron lungs went from being a hospital equipment staple to a museum curiosity in less than half a century.\n\nThe Rise and Acceptance of Respiratory Therapists, 1955-2000\n\nOne mark of a profession is the establishment of a professional society. In 1947, the University of Chicago chartered the Inhalation Therapy Association. Following the impact of viruses like polio and the advent of increasingly complicated treatments and surgeries, the specialized understanding of respiration became more and more necessary. The first formal training program for respiratory/inhalation therapists was established at the University of Chicago in 1950. In the 1960s, the number of programs grew, and most were hospital-based. By 1974, the professional designation of “Respiratory Therapist” became standard practice in the U.S. and Canada.\n\nIn 1980, the National Board for Respiratory Care began to offer state licensure exams for respiratory therapists. The first “Respiratory Care Week” was proclaimed by President Ronald Reagan in October 1982 to promote the profession and focus public attention on the importance of good lung health. This annual celebration continues today.\n\nIn 1986, the American Association for Respiratory Care underwent its most recent name change. It remains the national professional organization and continuing education affiliate for practicing respiratory therapists.\n\nFormalizing and Educating a Professional Workforce, 2000-present\n\nIn 2004, Vermont became the 48th state to pass the Respiratory Care Act that allowed the practice of respiratory care to be given in a state, province, region, or nation. With this action, legal professional credentialing was brought to all 48 contiguous states in the U.S.\n\nToday, Respiratory Therapy is a profession recognized globally. Its impact and need within the health care system is acknowledged and valued, and the number of educational programs continues to grow as the Bureau of Labor and Statistics expects the profession to be in high demand. As an allied health profession, respiratory therapists partner with physicians and nurses to treat a variety of patients. They assist with diagnosing lung and breathing disorders, provide testing, determine appropriate therapies, perform laboratory analysis on blood and sputum, manage breathing equipment and devices, and educate patients and families about lung diseases and disorders."
