        "text": "The Ventec Team introduced VOCSN at the 2016 American Association of Respiratory Care Congress (AARC) in San Antonio, TX on October 15th. This annual meeting of more than 5,000 respiratory therapists, physicians, and health advocates is the largest respiratory gathering in the United States.\n\nIn the Exhibit Hall, AARC attendees caught a glimpse of VOCSN glowing under the bright lights of the Ventec booth. Clinicians were invited to participate in five demonstration stations to learn how each of the five therapies – Ventilation, Oxygen, Cough, Suction, and Nebulizer – work seamlessly together. To celebrate the launch of VOCSN, the Ventec Clinical Board hosted a reception Saturday night for more than 100 thought leaders in respiratory care.\n\nWe know that VOCSN is simple, mobile, and care changing, but what we found from Congress attendees is that VOCSN is also “unbelievable,” “incredible,” and “game changing.” Take a look at a video and some of the pictures from AARC Congress 2016."
