        "text": "Midwestern State University’s Respiratory Care program was honored by the American Association for Respiratory Care (AARC) with the APEX Award.\n\nThe AARC honored 11 organizations with its 2024-2025 Apex Awards, and MSU Texas was one of two to receive recognition in the Education category, the other being the University of Kansas.\n\n“The American Association for Respiratory Care APEX award is a testament to the hard work and dedication of the MSU Texas respiratory care program's students, faculty, staff, and alumni who are committed to excellence in respiratory therapy education,” said Jennifer Anderson, the Chair of Respiratory Care at the Robert D. and Carol Gunn College of Health Sciences and Human Services.\n\nThe AARC established the Apex Recognition Program in 2017 to recognize respiratory therapy programs that achieve and consistently perform at the highest standards of education, quality, and patient care.\n\nSimilar to the Magnet Program for the nursing profession, the Apex Program requires facilities to submit detailed documentation on many factors that figure into high-quality care. Apex honorees excel in areas ranging from education and credentialing of their RT staff to the implementation of protocols aimed at facilitating safe and effective delivery of care and more.\n\n“This award signifies the program’s commitment to providing a top-notch education that prepares respiratory therapists to deliver exceptional patient care and positively impact their lives,” Anderson said. “The program takes pride in collaborating with all health science and human service programs in the Gunn College, and this recognition also acknowledges the program’s commitment to interdisciplinary teamwork. The AARC APEX award motivates the program to continue striving for excellence and reinforces its position as a leader in respiratory therapy education.”"
