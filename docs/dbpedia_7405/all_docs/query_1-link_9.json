        "text": "American professional organization\n\nThe American Association for Respiratory Care (AARC) is a non profit organization and is the only professional organization supporting Respiratory Care in the United States. In addition to attempting to help lobby for beneficial legislation nationally and locally, the AARC is trying to promote the profession as a whole to increase interest and membership.[1] The AARC began in 1943, as the Inhalation Technician Association and has evolved rapidly and repeatedly since.[2]\n\nMission\n\n[edit]\n\n\"The American Association for Respiratory Care (AARC) will continue to be the leading national and international professional association for respiratory care. The AARC will encourage and promote professional excellence, advance the science and practice of respiratory care, and serve as an advocate for patients, their families, the public, the profession and the respiratory therapist.\"[3]\n\nPublications\n\n[edit]\n\nRespiratory Care\n\nAARC Times Magazine\n\nFormer titles\n\n[edit]\n\nThe AAIT began publishing a journal called Inhalation Therapy in 1956.\n\nHistory\n\n[edit]\n\nSee also: Timeline of respiratory therapy\n\nThe University of Chicago Hospital forms the Inhalation Therapy Association (ITA) in 1946 and in 1947 the ITA is chartered as a non-profit entity in the state of Illinois.

The AAIT was renamed the American Association of Respiratory Therapy (AART) in 1973 and finally took the current name of American Association of Respiratory Care in 1986.\n\nAffiliations\n\n[edit]\n\nThe AARC has several organizations with which they have an affiliation;[clarification needed] some of these include:\n\nAMA Allied Health Careers\n\nAmerican Academy of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology\n\nAmerican Academy of Pediatrics\n\nAmerican Association of Cardiovascular and Pulmonary Rehabilitation\n\nAmerican Association of Critical-Care Nurses\n\nAmerican College of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology\n\nAmerican Heart Association\n\nAmerican Hospital Association\n\nAmerican Society of Anesthesiologists\n\nAmerican Society for Testing and Materials\n\nAmerican Thoracic Society\n\nCampaign for Tobacco-Free kids\n\nCanadian Society of Respiratory Therapists\n\nCOARC, The Committee on Accreditation for Respiratory Care\n\nCouncil on Licensure, Enforcement, and Regulation\n\nJoint Commission on Accreditation of Healthcare Organizations\n\nLambda Beta Society\n\nNational Association for Medical Direction of Respiratory Care\n\nNational Association for the Support of Long Term Care\n\nNational Board for Respiratory Care\n\nNational Coalition for Health Professional Education in Genetics\n\nNational Committee for Clinical Laboratory Standards\n\nNational Lung Health Education Program\n\nNeonatal Resuscitation Program\n\nRespiratory Therapy Society of Ontario\n\nSociety of Critical Care Medicine\n\nSee also\n\n[edit]\n\nEuropean Sleep Apnea Database\n\nNational Board for Respiratory Care\n\nCommission on Accreditation for Respiratory Care\n\nReferences\n\n[edit]\n\nAdditional sources\n\n[edit]\n\n\"American Association for Respiratory Care International Respiratory Congress,\" 17 December 2012, in Sleep Review online, at https://web.archive.org/web/20131029205057/http://www.sleepreviewmag.com/continuing-education/18224-american-association-for-respiratory-care-international-respiratory-congress .\n\nGreg Spratt, BS, RRT, CPFT, \"Respiratory Care Departments Take a Lead Role in Postoperative Monitoring,\" 11 July 2012, in RT online, at https://web.archive.org/web/20131029203813/http://www.rtmagazine.com/all-news/16820-respiratory-care-departments-take-a-lead-role-in-postoperative-monitoring .\n\nCathy Rozansky, MSH, RRT, \"Educating Health Professionals with Simulation Programs: Implications for Respiratory Therapists,\" 3 May 2012, in RT online, at https://archive.today/20131027100206/http://www.rtmagazine.com/all-news/16804-educating-health-professionals-with-simulation-programs-implications-for-respiratory-therapists .\n\n\"AARC Urges EPA Go Forward with Planned Epinephrine Phase Out,\" 6 December 2011, in RT online, at https://web.archive.org/web/20131029203256/http://www.rtmagazine.com/all-news/18361-aarc-urges-epa-go-forward-with-planned-epinephrine-phase-out- .\n\n\"AARC Releases Audio Book for Oxygen Users,\" October 31, 2012, in Advance for Respiratory Care & Sleep Medicine online, at http://respiratory-care-sleep-medicine.advanceweb.com/News/Daily-News-Watch/AARC-Releases-Audio-Book-for-Oxygen-Users.aspx ."
