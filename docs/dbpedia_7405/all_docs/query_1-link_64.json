        "text": "EXPLORING THE CRITICAL THINKING SKILLS OF RESPIRATORY CARE STUDENTS AND FACULTY Bshayer R. Alhamad Seton Hall University 2016 Introduction: Today, with the increased demands in health care, working as a competent respiratory therapist requires being a highly skilled, critically thinking professional. Although students are expected to learn how to think critically mostly in the academic environment from their faculty, only a paucity of studies has assessed the critical thinking of respiratory care students, with none, to our knowledge, assessing that of faculty. Therefore, the purpose of this mixed method study was to (1) assess the overall critical thinking skill levels of both respiratory care students and faculty, (2) investigate whether respiratory care faculty have stronger overall critical thinking skills than respiratory care students, and (3) determine respiratory care student and faculty perceptions regarding what critical thinking is and how it develops. Methods: All Commis...\n\nObjective We evaluated the impact of an experiential learning strategy on both the adherence to the use of bundles and the incidence of ventilator-associated pneumonia in critically ill adult patients. Methods Longitudinal, quasi-experimental interrupted time-series study in a tertiary teaching hospital in Buenos Aires, Argentina. Successive measurements were made before and after the intervention was implemented between January 2016 and December 2018. Our main exposure was experiential learning, which was based on a combination of play activities, simulation models, knowledge and attitude competencies, role-playing and feedback. The adherence to the bundle for the care of mechanically ventilated critically-ill adult patients and the occurrence of ventilator-associated pneumonia were the main outcomes of interest. We used generalized linear models including time as a linear spline to estimate the effect of the experiential learning strategy both on the adherence to the bundle of car..."
