The MHS was established to provide medical care to the increasing numbers of ill merchant seamen traveling to U.S. port cities to ease the burden on public hospitals. The MHS also offered technical assistance on epidemics and matters of quarantine to the states.\n\nIMPACT\n\nOver the next century, the MHS laid the foundation for public health in the United States. In 1912, the MHS was officially renamed the U.S. Public Health Service (USPHS) and was given increased responsibility for health investigation and environmental safety in controlling the spread of contagious diseases such as smallpox and yellow fever, conducting important biomedical research, regulating the food and drug supply, providing health care to underserved populations, and supplying medical assistance in the aftermath of disasters.\n\nCategory: Public Health and Medicine\n\n1800: Smallpox vaccination in the U.S.\n\nBACKGROUND\n\nThe smallpox vaccination was introduced in the United States in 1800 by Benjamin Waterhouse. In 1855, Maryland successfully passed a law to make the vaccination compulsory for schoolchildren; however, legislative attempts to make vaccinations compulsory in America did not succeed until 1855 and enforcement did not begin until 1872.\n\nIMPACT\n\nThe smallpox vaccine, along with the establishment of vaccination laws and improvements in sanitation, water quality, and hygiene, eventually led to the eradication of the deadly smallpox disease and decreased mortality rates due to the disease.\n\nRelated Pinpoints\n\n1840: Public School Movement\n\nCategory: Public Health and Medicine\n\n1840: Public School Movement\n\nBACKGROUND\n\nIn the 1840s, the United States government began to realize the need to organize public schools throughout the country. This movement was intended to unify Americans in the context of increasing urbanization, industrialization, and immigration.\n\nIMPACT\n\nThe movement in the 1840s to organize public, government funded schools laid the foundation for free education for all children in the United States. \"General education is the best preventive of the evils now most dreaded. In the civilized countries of the world, the question is how to distribute most generally and equally the property of the world. As a rule, where education is most general the distribution of property is most general.... As knowledge spreads, wealth spreads. To diffuse knowledge is to diffuse wealth. To give all an equal chance to acquire knowledge is the best and surest way to give all an equal chance to acquire property.\" --President Rutherford Birchard Hayes\n\nRelated Links\n\nAmerican Education and Civil Rights\n\nCategory: Government and Policy\n\n1847: American Medical Association (AMA) established\n\nBACKGROUND\n\nThe American Medical Association (AMA) was established in 1847. A year later, an AMA committee assessed the state of medical education in the U.S. and reported several deficiencies in the medical education system. The committee concluded that the U.S. system lagged significantly behind those already operating in Europe.\n\nIMPACT\n\nWith the establishment of the AMA, national medical standards and the first code of medical ethics were adopted. The AMA continues to be the largest medical association in America, and over the last century and a half, has continued to set medical guidelines and improve public health care.\n\nRelated Links\n\nAmerican Medical Association\n\nRELATED PINPOINTS\n\n1879: AMA Section: Diseases of Children\n\n1903: AMA Section: Obstetrics and Diseases of Women\n\n1855: First Children's Hospital\n\nBACKGROUND\n\nThe nation's first freestanding children's hospital, established in Philadelphia, began receiving children suffering from acute diseases and accidents on November 23, 1855. This was followed by the establishment of another children's hospital in Boston. By the mid-1890s, most large cities had at least one children's hospital.\n\nIMPACT\n\nThe Children's Hospital of Philadelphia was the first hospital dedicated entirely to children. The opening of this hospital influenced other large cities to provide the same concentrated care to children.\n\nCategory: Public Health and Medicine\n\n1860: First Children's Clinic\n\nBACKGROUND\n\nDr. Abraham Jacobi founded the nation’s first children’s health clinic in New York. During the weekly clinic, medical students were able to focus on conditions specific to children.\n\nIMPACT\n\nDr. Jacobi is regarded as the founder of American pediatrics. By initiating the first children’s clinic in the U.S., he set the precedent for including children’s clinics in hospitals across the nation.\n\nRELATED PINPOINT\n\n1888: American Pediatric Society\n\nCategory: Public Health and Medicine\n\n4/12/1861: The Civil War\n\nBACKGROUND\n\nThe Civil War began with cannon fire ringing out on the morning of April 12, 1861 and ended as the most deadly war in United States history with the surrender of General Lee and his Confederate forces on April 9, 1865. Three million men fought and 600,000 died, more than any other war involving U.S. soldiers. The succession of Southern states from the Union, taxation, and most notably slavery were the immediate catalysts for the first shots of the war. The aftermath of the Civil War, “Reconstruction,” led to the ratification of the Thirteenth Amendment, which abolished slavery in the United States. Reconstruction led to the reorganization of society, the economy and the politics of Southern states.\n\nIMPACT\n\nThe roots of the Civil War run deep and are still debated. The social effects of the Civil War have lasted well over a century, and continue today. Following the Civil War, the Reconstruction Era eventually led to a much stronger centralized government in the U.S.\n\nCategory: Milestones\n\n1867: The U.S. Office of Education established\n\nBACKGROUND\n\nPresident Andrew Johnson created the first Department of Education in 1867. The controversial department was demoted to an office within a year because Congress feared that the department would exercise too much control over local schools. Over the next several decades, the Office of Education remained small, operated under different titles, was housed in various government agencies, and was poorly funded. In 1979, the Office of Education became the Department of Education.\n\nIMPACT\n\nAlthough the Office of Education remained small for many decades, it's creation laid the foundation for future legislation on the role of government in public education.\n\nRELATED LINK\n\nThe Federal Role in Education\n\nCategory: Government and Policy\n\n1869: First Board of Health established\n\nBACKGROUND\n\nThe first state board of health, established in Massachusetts in 1869, was limited to investigative and consultative responsibilities. The Board's limited scope, small budget, and untrained staff were partly responsible for its failure to control a smallpox epidemic. As a result, autonomous local boards of health were created in 1872.\n\nIMPACT\n\nThe board of health in Massachusetts was the first board established to promote the general health of the public. Its creation led the way for the establishment of similar boards of health in most states across the nation.\n\nCategory: Government and Policy\n\n1872: American Public Health Association (APHA) established\n\nBACKGROUND\n\nThe American Public Health Association was established in 1872 by Stephen Smith in New York. The majority of its membership was composed of physicians who served as officials in local and state health departments. The APHA's main purpose initially was to increase these departments' regulatory authority.\n\nIMPACT\n\nAPHA continues to be the oldest and largest organization of public health professionals in the world. Its influence on policies and public health priorities has been continually present since its inception.\n\nRELATED LINK\n\nAmerican Public Health Association\n\nCategory: Government and Policy\n\n1874: Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children established\n\nBACKGROUND\n\nThe first organized attempts to protect abused children arose from humane work that focused on animals. The American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals was established in 1866 by Henry Bergh. In 1874, a woman came to Mr. Bergh seeking help for a brutally abused foster child, Mary Ellen Wilson. Since there was no agency to protect children, the Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals was the only agency to take responsibility for helping the child. Stemming from this event, the Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children was founded in 1874. In 1875, it was incorporated as The New York Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children.\n\nIMPACT\n\nWith the inception of the Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children, the protection of children became a more widely publicized issue and thus a growing concern for state and local governments.\n\nRELATED LINK\n\nNYSPCC\n\nRELATED PINPOINT\n\n1962: Battered Child Syndrome\n\nCategory: Government and Policy\n\n1879: AMA Section: Diseases of Children\n\nBACKGROUND\n\nThe Section on Diseases of Children of the American Medical Association was formed in 1879.\n\nIMPACT\n\nThe formation of this section supported pediatrics as a special branch of medicine.\n\nRELATED LINK\n\nAmerican Medical Association\n\nRELATED PINPOINT\n\n1847: American Medical Association (AMA) established\n\n1881: Abolition of Child Labor becomes top priority for AFL\n\nBACKGROUND\n\nThe use of child labor continued to be of great concern for society and labor groups. In 1881, the abolition of child labor became a top priority for the American Federation of Labor. By 1899, 28 states had passed legislation designed to protect child workers. This was accomplished despite opposition by employers who felt these laws would make it difficult to stay in business. The first state child labor committee was organized in Alabama in 1901. In 1904, the first national child labor committee met in New York. The central purpose of the National Child Labor Committee was to prevent child labor through legislation.\n\nIMPACT\n\nThese concerted and focused efforts to protect child workers has ultimately led to the existence of child labor laws in all 50 U.S. states.\n\nRELATED PINPOINTS\n\n1904: First National Child Labor Committee\n\n1916: Keating-Owen Act\n\n1938: Fair Labor Standards Act\n\nCategory: Government and Policy\n\n1888: American Pediatric Society\n\nBACKGROUND\n\nDr. Abraham Jacobi founded the nation’s first children’s health clinic in New York.

By initiating the first children’s clinic in the U.S., he set the precedent for including children’s clinics in hospitals across the nation.\n\nRELATED PINPOINT\n\n1888: American Pediatric Society\n\n1889: Hull House Settlement Established\n\nBACKGROUND\n\nJane Addams, with friend Ellen Starr, established the Hull House Settlement in 1889 in Chicago, and initiated the Settlement House Movement in the U.S. Services provided at Hull House included kindergarten classes and health, child care and legal aid services.\n\nIMPACT\n\nJane Addams was the first American woman to receive the Nobel Peace Prize in 1931. She was one of the early advisors for the Children's Bureau.\n\nRELATED LINK\n\nJane Addams Hull-House Museum\n\n1890: Progressive Era\n\nBACKGROUND\n\nThe period between 1890 and 1920 involved such intense reform activity that historians have labeled it the \"Progressive Era.\" Over these three decades, Americans organized voluntary and political associations to devise solutions to the problems created by industrialization, urbanization, and immigration.\n\nDuring this period, a reform movement referred to as the \"crusade for children\" revolved around efforts to improve child health and labor conditions. On state and local levels, the increased development of health departments provided new forums for expanding and disseminating pediatric and obstetric knowledge. The private sector increased its involvement in programs for people with disabilities. Notably, volunteer organizations such as the Shriners, the National Society for Crippled Children (Easter Seals Society), the Rotary Club, and the Lions Club each initiated new programs for children and adults with disabilities.\n\nIMPACT\n\nThe efforts of the government to improve child health and labor conditions and the increased sharing of pediatric knowledge paved the way for reform in the next century. Private organizations laid a strong foundation for the continued involvement of the public in programs for children.\n\nRELATED LINK\n\nWomen in the Progressive Era\n\nCategory: Milestones\n\n1893: First State Program for Children with Special Health Needs\n\nBACKGROUND\n\nMinnesota was the first state to provide a state program for children with disabilities.\n\nIMPACT\n\nBy the end of the 19th century, hospitals for children with orthopedic impairments had been established in many major cities.\n\nCategory: Government and Policy\n\n1893: Henry Street Settlement\n\nBACKGROUND\n\nTrained as a nurse, Lillian Wald founded the Henry Street Settlement in New York City in September 1893.\n\nIMPACT\n\nLillian Wald pioneered public health nursing and helped to found the National Organization for Public Health Nursing. She was also instrumental in helping to establish the federal Children's Bureau, National Child Labor Committee, and National Women's Trade Union League.\n\nRelated Links\n\nAbout Henry Street Settlement\n\nCategory: Public Health and Medicine\n\n1893: Milk Stations\n\nBACKGROUND\n\nLack of safe milk was among the most significant child health problems during the 1800s. In 1893, Nathan Straus, a New York philanthropist, established a number of milk stations for the poor in an attempt to decrease infant mortality and morbidity caused by “summer diarrhea.” In 1897, Rochester, New York became the first municipality to provide milk stations.\n\nIMPACT\n\nDue to the provision of safe milk at milk stations and the advent of pasteurization in 1910, diarrheal disease was no longer a major cause of infant mortality by the early 1900s.\n\nCategory: Government and Policy\n\n1894: School Inspections\n\nBACKGROUND\n\nWith the introduction of modern public health methods, schools began to take more responsibility for preventive health care. The Boston Board of Health was the first to introduce medical inspection of children to prevent infectious diseases in schools. Chicago followed by becoming the first city to appoint school physicians. The New York City Health Department became the first health department to introduce compulsory medical inspection in all public schools. Ideas for health education and school medical inspection led to a request from the New York Health Commissioner for the loan of a full-time nurse to provide medical inspection in schools.\n\nIMPACT\n\nThese initial efforts set the precedent for standardized school medical inspections. The school setting allowed for efficient screening of diseases and developmental concerns in schoolchildren.\n\nRELATED PINPOINT\n\n1911: Mandatory School Health Inspection\n\nCategory: Government and Policy\n\n1900: The 1900's\n\nThe 1900s were initiated with the establishment of progressive organizations focused on many emerging maternal and child health issues. The American Medical Association added an Obstetrics and Diseases of Women section. The First National Child Labor Committee and First Bureau of Child Hygiene helped combat the developing health concerns regarding issues such as child labor and overcrowding-related health concerns. The American Association for Study and Prevention of Infant Mortality was the first organization to have a set agenda on reducing the rate of infant mortality. Use of the Little Mother’s League proved that public health assistance training programs allowed for various volunteers across the nation to help decrease the number of infant deaths.\n\nCategory: Milestones\n\n1903: AMA Section: Obstetrics and Diseases of Women\n\nBACKGROUND\n\nThe American Medical Association (AMA) established a section called Obstetrics and Diseases of Women.\n\nIMPACT\n\nThe formation of this section supported the gynecological and obstetrical needs of women in the medical field prior to any national and professional organizations. Although unbeknownst at the time, this would lay the groundwork for a whole specialty of medicine that would greatly contribute to the improvement of women’s health.\n\nRELATED LINK\n\nAmerican Medical Association\n\nRELATED PINPOINTS\n\n1847: American Medical Association (AMA) established\n\n1879: AMA Section: Diseases of Children\n\nCategory: Public Health and Medicine\n\n1904: First National Child Labor Committee\n\nBACKGROUND\n\nThe National Child Labor Committee was organized in 1904 in an attempt to persuade Congress to prevent child labor though legislation. Jane Addams was one of its founding members. The Committee was incorporated by an Act of Congress in 1907. In the same year, Jane Addams reported that there were more than 2 million children under 16 years of age in paid employment in the U.S. She argued that the vast number of children working in the U.S. helped to explain the 580,000 children between 10-14 years old who did not know how to read or write.\n\nIMPACT\n\nThe development of the first national child labor committee indicated a presence in Congress of individuals who were concerned about child labor. The establishment of the committee led to the development of the Federal Children's Bureau in 1912 and the Federal Child Labor Law in 1916. This committee laid the foundation for the strong state and federal child labor laws that were developed later on to ensure the health and safety of America's youth entering the working world.\n\nRELATED LINK\n\nChild Labor in America\n\nRELATED PINPOINTS\n\n1881: Abolition of Child Labor Becomes Priority for American Federation of Labor\n\n1889: Hull House Settlement Established\n\n1916: Keating-Owen Act\n\n1938: Fair Labor Standards Act\n\nCategory: Government and Policy\n\n1907: First Bureau of Child Hygiene\n\nBACKGROUND\n\nDr. Josephine Baker was the first Chief of the MCH Bureau of Child Hygiene (later Bureau of Child Health) in the New York City Health Department from 1908-1923. In addition to being a physician, she was also the first woman to receive a doctorate in public health from the New York University School of Medicine.Through her efforts, she organized visits to tenement homes of newborn babies, provided instruction and assistance to mothers on infant care and was instrumental in the prevention of diarrheal diseases.The MCH Bureau of Child Hygiene in the NYC Health Department also provided care to school children, conducted health clinics, supervised midwives, and regulated children's institutions and boarding homes.\n\nIMPACT\n\nThe development of the first Bureau of Child Hygiene in New York with the help of Josephine Baker had many impacts including:allowing the licensure of midwivesthe development of a dispenser for administering silver nitrate to newborns' eyes to prevent gonococcal infections and blindnessthe development of a newborn formula which added water, calcium carbonate, and lactose to cow's milkthe controversial development of the Little Mothers Leagues where 8 and 9 year old girls were taught how to take care of children while their mothers worked to try and support the children.The establishment of this first MCH bureau paved the way for other state bureaus as well as the subsequent establishment of the federal Children's Bureau in 1912. In addition, the first bureau of child hygiene marks the beginning of the American vision and goal to have children reach their optimal health and to receive quality healthcare.\n\nRelated Links:\n\nNational Library of Medicine - Dr. S. Josephine Baker Biography\n\nCategory: Public Health and Medicine\n\n1908: Little Mothers’ League\n\nBACKGROUND\n\nDr. Josephine Baker, Director of the Division of Child Hygiene at the New York City Department of Health, organized “Little Mothers’ Leagues” starting in 1908. The “leagues” were established to provide care for infants, with the greater goal of reducing infant mortality. Members were females aged 12 to 16, although girls as young as 10 could join. After attending classes, girls became certified as “volunteer aides of the Department of Health.”\n\nIMPACT\n\nYoung girls were very interested in joining Little Mothers’ Leagues, and the leagues spread to other cities. Within seven years, nearly 50,000 girls had attended classes across the country.\n\nRELATED PINPOINT\n\n1907: First Bureau of Child Hygiene\n\nCategory: Government and Policy\n\n1909: White House Conference on Dependent Children\n\nBACKGROUND\n\nIn 1909, President Theodore Roosevelt convened a group of medical professionals and lay leaders interested in the care of dependent children. This marked the first White House Conference on the Care of Dependent Children. One of the major recommendations from this conference was for the development of a federal Children's Bureau.\n\nIMPACT\n\nIn 1909, the first ever White House Conference on the Care of Dependent Children brought national focus to the health and well-being of dependent children and provided the venue for a government leadership role in child welfare reform, including efforts to prevent childhood diseases, reduce infant mortality, and reform child labor practices. This conference led to the development of the Children's Bureau in 1912. Today, the activities of the original Children's Bureau are divided between two agencies in the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services; the child welfare responsibilities are housed in the Administration for Children and Families and the health responsibilities are housed in HRSA’s Maternal and Child Health Bureau.\n\nRELATED LINKS\n\nMaternal and Child Health Bureau\n\nRELATED PINPOINTS\n\n1912: Children’s Bureau\n\n1919: White House Conference on Standards of Child Welfare\n\n11/22/1930: White House Conference on Child Protection\n\n1940: White House Conference on Children in a Democracy\n\n1950: Mid-Century White House Conference on Children and Youth\n\n3/27/1960: Golden Anniversary White House Conference on Children and Youth\n\n1970: White House Conference on Children and Youth\n\nCategory: Government and Policy\n\n1909: Prevention of Infant Mortality\n\nBACKGROUND\n\nIn 1909, the American Association for Study and Prevention of Infant Mortality was organized in New Haven, Connecticut. It was the first nationwide association whose mission was to study and identify ways to prevent infant mortality. Dr. Helen Putnam, who served as the president of the American Academy of Medicine, was instrumental in the Association’s development.\n\nIMPACT\n\nThe Association played a major role in creating a new registration procedure for all infant births and deaths in the country.\n\nRELATED LINK\n\nDr. Helen Cordelia Putnam\n\nCategory: Public Health and Medicine\n\n1910: The 1910s\n\nThe decade began to lay the foundation for numerous public health efforts, many of which focused on maternal and child health. By the year 1910, pasteurization of milk was being widely implemented on the national level to provide safe milk for infants and children. Establishment of the National Organization of Public Health Nursing, Children’s Bureau, the United States Public Health Service, and the American Child Hygiene Association helped show that both private and federal organizations and agencies were serious about the health and wellness of women and children, particularly the most vulnerable and impoverished populations. The National Birth Registry, set forth by the Children’s Bureau provided the first concrete evidence of the social causes of infant mortality. The Keating-Owen Act rendered illegal for the exchange of goods produced by factories that employed children under the age of fourteen. The first edition of the Children’s Bureau’s infant care pamphlet along with the Baby Week Campaign and the 1919 Children’s Year all worked to increase the public’s knowledge and awareness of burdens on child health. However, setbacks such as the Spanish Influenza pandemic took a toll on all age groups.\n\nCategory: Milestones\n\n1910: Sickle Cell Anemia Described\n\nBACKGROUND\n\nDr. James B. Herrick presented the first published description of sickle cell anemia in 1910. The patient described was a dental student from Grenada studying in Chicago. As more studies were published, it was realized that all patients described shared origins in Africa. Evaluation of chromosome structure indicates that the sickle cell gene was derived by mutations at least four separate times, three times in Africa and a fourth in either Saudi Arabia or central India.\n\nIMPACT\n\nSickle cell diseases are the most prevalent group of disorders identified by newborn screening, with more than 1500 affected infants born in the United States each year. It is now recognized that genes with mutations for sickle cell disease are common in persons of African, Mediterranean, Middle Eastern, and Indian ancestry, and in persons from the Caribbean and parts of Central and South America.\n\nRELATED PINPOINTS\n\n1949: Sickle Cell Disease and Altered Hemoglobin\n\n1965: MCH Sickle Cell Anemia Initiative\n\n1972: Sickle Cell Anemia Control Act\n\nCategory: Public Health and Medicine\n\n1910: Flexner Report\n\nBACKGROUND\n\nThe American Medical Association employed Abraham Flexner to inspect medical schools in the U.S. regarding entrance requirements, quality of facilities, and financial capabilities to train students and support faculty.\n\nIMPACT\n\nFlexner's recommendations, though criticized during his time, became the foundations for the present educational and licensing requirements of physicians.\n\nCategory: Public Health and Medicine\n\n1910: Pasteurization\n\nBACKGROUND\n\nBy 1910, pasteurization was recognized as the best way to ensure delivery of safe milk to infants and the general U.S. population.\n\nIMPACT\n\nSince the discovery of pasteurization in the mid-1800s, the concepts of sterilization, disinfection, and antiseptics have been widely applied to improve public health.\n\nCategory: Public Health and Medicine\n\n1911: Mandatory School Health Inspection\n\nBACKGROUND\n\nBy 1911, nine states had mandatory school health inspection laws and nearly 400 cities had adopted a system of medical inspection.\n\nIMPACT\n\nThe early school health inspections were used for infectious disease surveillance to identify and quarantine children with threatening conditions. School health programs provided the opportunity for proactive health intervention to educate and screen children and prevent diseases.\n\nRELATED PINPOINT\n\n1894: School Inspections\n\nCategory: Public Health and Medicine\n\n1912: Public Health Nursing\n\nBACKGROUND\n\nThe National Organization of Public Health Nursing (NOPHN) was formed in 1912.

For example, Wald helped to establish the world’s first public school nursing system.\n\nRELATED LINK\n\nJewish Women's Archive\n\nCategory: Government and Policy\n\n1912: U.S. Public Health Service\n\nBACKGROUND\n\nA series of laws in the late 19th century placed the responsibility of providing medical inspections for all arriving immigrants on the Marine Hospital Service (MHS), and ultimate authority of quarantine enforcement with the Surgeon General instead of with the states. In 1912, the MHS was renamed the U.S. Public Health Service (USPHS), which was given greater responsibilities in providing healthcare services to medically underserved populations through health investigations, environmental safety, and health promotion.\n\nIMPACT\n\nAs America's uniformed service of public health professionals with core values of leadership, service, integrity, and excellence, the USPHS Commissioned Corps protects, promotes, and advances the health and safety of national and international medically underserved populations through:\n\nRapid and effective response to public health needs\n\nLeadership and excellence in public health practices, and\n\nAdvancement of public health science\n\nRELATED LINK\n\nCommissioned Corps of the U.S. Public Health Service\n\nRELATED PINPOINT\n\n1798: Marine Hospital Service\n\nCategory: Government and Policy\n\n1912: Children's Bureau\n\nBACKGROUND\n\nThe Children's Bureau was established under President Taft in 1912 at the recommendation of the First White House Conference on Dependent Children in 1909. The mission of the Children's Bureau was to investigate and report “upon matters pertaining to the welfare of children and child life among all classes of our people.\" Although Federal involvement in such issues was controversial at the time, the Bureau was established through active support of President Taft. Julia C. Lathrop became the first chief of the Children’s Bureau and the first woman to be appointed by a president to head a Federal statutory agency.\n\nIMPACT\n\nIn addition to the mandate to investigate and report on child health issues, the early leaders of the Children's Bureau sought to resolve problems through legislation and the political process. The National Birth Registry and the Sheppard-Towner Act were important outcomes of the Bureau's activism. As a result of the leadership provided by the Children’s Bureau, 28 states had established child hygiene bureaus by 1920. Sixteen of these state bureaus were established in 1919 alone.\n\nRELATED LINK\n\nChildren’s Bureau\n\nRELATED PINPOINTS\n\n1907: First Bureau of Child Hygiene\n\n1909: White House Conference on Dependent Children\n\n1914: Pamphlet on Infant Care\n\n1921-1934: Grace Abbott Appointed Second Chief of Children's Bureau\n\n1915: National Birth Registry\n\n1921-1929: Maternity and Infancy Care Act / Sheppard Towner Act\n\nCategory: Government and Policy\n\n1914: World War I\n\nWorld War I (also known as The Great War) was a military conflict of catastrophic size that took place mainly in Europe.

Over the next 50 years, a total of 45 million copies of the pamphlet were distributed as an educational resource.\n\nRELATED PINPOINT\n\n1912: Children’s Bureau\n\nCategory: Government and Policy\n\n1915: National Birth Registry\n\nBACKGROUND\n\nProposed by the Children’s Bureau, the National Birth Registry was established in 1915 to improve data collection of vital statistics.\n\nIMPACT\n\nIn the 1900s, the National Birth Registry and other infant vital records related the first concrete evidence of the social causes of infant mortality, demonstrating how high mortality rates in industrial cities were connected with the unmet health and educational needs of children. As the perpetuating cycle of poverty and ill health was recognized, increased efforts were made to mobilize communities and promote good health.\n\nRELATED PINPOINT\n\n1912: Children's Bureau\n\nCategory: Government and Policy\n\n1916: Keating-Owen Act\n\nBACKGROUND\n\nBy 1900, one in six 10- to 15-year-olds was employed in industry and agriculture, and children as young as 7 were employed in hazardous work environments. The Keating-Owen Act was meant to regulate child labor by prohibiting interstate commerce of goods produced by companies that employed children within certain restrictions. The U.S. Supreme Court overturned the Act in the 1918 Hammer v. Dagenhart case.\n\nIMPACT\n\nThe Act attempted to protect children from wrongful exploitation; however, the Supreme Court ruling in the 1918 case demonstrated that the federal government had no right to intervene in child labor decisions – it was up to the parent whether a child would work instead of attend school. Despite the ruling, the children's rights movement continued to progress. New child labor laws were enacted during the Great Depression in the 1930s.\n\nRELATED PINPOINTS\n\n1881: Abolition of Child Labor Becomes Priority for American Federation of Labor\n\n1904: First National Child Labor Committee\n\n1938: Fair Labor Standards Act\n\nCategory: Government and Policy\n\n1916: Establishment of Schools of Public Health\n\nBACKGROUND\n\nFrom 1916 to 1923, schools of public health were established in colleges and universities in order to meet health departments' increased need for more broadly trained personnel.\n\nIMPACT\n\nToday, more than 50 accredited schools of public health are in the United States.

Other major results of this Act included the development of full-time units for maternal and child health (MCH) services in state health departments and the first MCH training program. By the time the Act expired in 1929, every state but one had established MCH units. Many states continued to provide training even though there was no longer adequate funding.

States soon discovered that they needed adequately trained professionals to make progress, so some of the funds appropriated under the Act were designated to provide nurses with tuition, a per diem, and one-year sabbatical expenses while they participated in specialized training courses. Thus, the first MCH training program was born. Throughout the 1920s and 1930s, the Children’s Bureau offered short courses for a variety of disciplines, including nurses, social workers, physical therapists, obstetricians, and pediatricians.\n\nIMPACT\n\nThe early investments in workforce training through the Sheppard-Towner Act eventually resulted in the MCH Training Program.

The passage of the Title V amendment of the Social Security Act during this decade would help many women and children in the 1930s as well as lay the groundwork for many public health assistance programs for the next century. Public health interventions through food regulation and enforcement began to take shape as milk was fortified to prevent rickets and vitamin K was recommended for newborns. The federal Food Stamp Program was created to help meet nutritional needs of many families during the Great Depression. Technological advances to the hospital grade incubators, and formation of the March of Dimes helped further reduce infant mortality rates.\n\nCategory: Milestones\n\n1930: White House Conference on Child Protection\n\nBACKGROUND\n\nIn 1930, President Herbert Hoover convened the White House Conference on Child Health and Protection. The Conference was called \"to study the present status of the health and well-being of the children of the United States and its possessions, to report what is being done, to recommend what ought to be done, and how to do it.\" Its major focus was child development.\n\nIMPACT\n\nThe White House Conference on Child Health and Protection generated reports that described the health care and protection needed for America's children and highlighted the deficits in the current care for children. The committee reports laid the groundwork for the inclusion of federal-state programs for aid to dependent children, crippled children, and maternal and child health and welfare services in the Social Security Act of 1935 and the Fair Labor Standard Act of 1938.\n\nRELATED PINPOINTS\n\n1909: White House Conference on Dependent Children\n\n1919: White House Conference on Standards of Child Welfare\n\n1935: Title V of the Social Security Act\n\n1938: Fair Labor Standards Act\n\n1940: White House Conference on Children in a Democracy\n\n1950: Mid-Century White House Conference on Children and Youth\n\n1960: Golden Anniversary White House Conference on Children and Youth\n\n1970: White House Conference on Children and Youth\n\nCategory: Government and Policy\n\n1930: Milk Fortification for the Prevention of Rickets\n\nBACKGROUND\n\nBy the 1930s, it had been known for a number of years that rickets was caused by a deficiency of vitamin D. While cod liver oil (a good source of vitamin D) was used to prevent rickets in the 1920s, it was not until the early 1930s that milk became fortified with vitamin D. Initial research was conducted by Martha Eliot and supported by the Children's Bureau.\n\nIMPACT\n\nIn the 1930s, the public health prevention initiative of supplementing milk with vitamin D led to the eventual eradication of rickets in the United States.\n\nRELATED PINPOINTS\n\n1924: Rickets Demonstration Grant\n\n1912: Children's Bureau\n\nCategory: Public Health and Medicine\n\n8/14/1935: Title V of the Social Security Act\n\nBACKGROUND\n\nAs a result of the Great Depression, cutbacks in federal health programs, and the declining health of mothers and babies, the Social Security Act was signed into law in August 1935 by President Franklin Delano Roosevelt. Secretary of Labor Frances Perkins enrolled Katharine Lenroot, then Children's Bureau Chief, to work with her to ensure that children were considered by the Committee on Economic Security, which drafted the legislation.\n\nTitle IV of the legislation also provided funding for federal-state partnerships to help the blind, the elderly, and children, the latter of which became the first incarnation of the Aid to Dependent Children welfare program. Funding was initially provided strictly for needy, dependent children, and it was not until the 1950s that funding was also given to caretakers. This was reflected in a name change to Aid to Families of Dependent Children (AFDC).\n\nIMPACT\n\nTitle V provided programs for maternity, infant, and child care, as well as a full range of medical services for children. Funds were allocated to states to pay for Maternal and Child Health and Crippled Children services, including physicians, dentists, public health nurses, medical social workers, and nutritionists. Unlike other sections of the Social Security legislation, Title V was not an entitlement program. It consisted of four parts: 1) Maternal and Child Health Services, 2) Services for Crippled Children, 3) Child Welfare Services, and 4) Vocational Rehabilitation. Title V is the longest-standing public health legislation in American history, and it continues to work to improve the health of women and children.\n\nRELATED LINKS\n\nSocial Security Act Title V\n\nSocial Security History\n\nCategory: Government and Policy\n\n1935: Introduction of Vitamin K\n\nBACKGROUND\n\nVitamin K was discovered in 1935 by Henrick Dam and Adelbert Doisy.\n\nIMPACT\n\nThe discovery of vitamin K led to the prevention of hemorrhagic disease of the newborn, also known as vitamin K deficiency bleeding. Hemorrhagic disease is a potentially life-threatening bleeding condition in infants where severe bleeding or hemorrhage can result after birth. Due to the discovery that vitamin K can prevent hemorrhagic disease, it was recommended that every newborn baby be given an injection of vitamin K after delivery.\n\nCategory: Public Health and Medicine\n\n1938: Fair Labor Standards Act\n\nBACKGROUND\n\nThe Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938 was the first federal legislation to set employment standards for minimum age and hours of work for children.\n\nIMPACT\n\nWhile previous child labor laws, such as the Keating-Owen Act of 1916, had been met with failure, the Fair Labor Standards Act was the first permanent child labor law enacted by Congress.\n\nRELATED LINK\n\nU.S. Department of Labor - Child Labor\n\nRELATED PINPOINTS\n\n1881: Abolition of Child Labor Becomes Priority for American Federation of Labor\n\n1904: First National Child Labor Committee\n\nCategory: Public Health and Medicine\n\n1938: General Use of Sulfonamides\n\nBACKGROUND\n\nSulfonamides, the first drugs found to be effective against bacterial infections, were discovered by Gerhand Domagk in 1932. Domagk found that one sulfonamide, Prontosil, was effective against streptococcus in mice, and treated his daughter with the drug when she became ill with a streptococcus infection. The treatment saved her arm from being amputated. Domagk won the Nobel Prize for his accomplishments in 1939, but was forced to decline it by the Nazi regime until after the war in 1947.\n\nIMPACT\n\nSulfonamides came into general use by 1938. A variety of derivatives were soon synthesized - sulfapyridine in 1938, sulfathiazole in 1939, and sulfadiazine in 1949.

It had the dual purpose of productively using food surpluses and providing food to people in need. The program permitted people on public assistance to buy orange stamps that could be used to purchase any food. For each $1 of orange stamps that people purchased, they additionally qualified to receive 50 cents in blue stamps, which were used to purchase food determined to be in surplus. The program lasted until 1943.\n\nIMPACT\n\nFrom 1939 to 1943, the first food stamp program reached nearly 20 million people in the U.S. at a cost of $262 million.

These families were provided with medical, nursing, and hospital services for the prenatal period, delivery, and six weeks postpartum at no charge. Complete care was provided for infants less than one year old.\n\nIMPACT\n\nThe EMIC was the largest public medical care program undertaken in the United States up to that time.

It now permanently authorizes the National School Lunch Program (NSLP) and the Child and Adult Care Food Program (CACFP). Through these programs, the National School Lunch Act provides federal subsidies for every school lunch served, particularly for meals served to low-income children. Moreover, federal payment and a set value of commodity assistance is required for meals and snacks served to children, older adults, and people with disabilities in care facilities.

Funds were designated to states to achieve 4.5 beds per 1,000 people.\n\nIMPACT\n\nFederal funding was provided to hospitals where state municipalities were willing to match funds for building renovations.\n\nFacilities receiving Hill-Burton funding had to comply with several requirements. Hospitals were not allowed to discriminate based on race, color, national origin, or creed. Facilities were required to provide a \"reasonable\" amount of uncompensated care each year for 20 years to local residents who needed medical attention but could not afford to pay. Participation in Medicare and Medicaid were also later added to the list of requirements for funding.\n\nIn 1975, the Act was amended and became Title XVI of the Public Health Service Act.\n\nCategory: Government and Policy\n\n1946: UNICEF established\n\nBACKGROUND\n\nFollowing World War II, the United Nations established the United Nations International Children's Emergency Fund (UNICEF).

Itano, Seymour J. Singer, and Ibert C. Wells published “Sickle Cell Anemia, A Molecular Disease.” They discovered that sickle cell disease was associated with an atypical form of hemoglobin, now termed hemoglobin S.\n\nIMPACT\n\nSickle cell disease was the first disease to be linked with the alteration of a specific protein (hemoglobin). As a result, the term “molecular disease” was coined. This discovery marked a milestone in the history of molecular biology.\n\nRELATED PINPOINTS\n\n1910: Sickle Cell Anemia Described By Herrick\n\n1965: MCH Sickle Cell Anemia Initiative\n\n1972: Sickle Cell Anemia Control Act\n\nCategory: Public Health and Medicine\n\nThe 1950s\n\nDespite the medical and technological advancements of the 1940s, the 1950s presented years of stagnation for child health. Infant mortality ceased to decline and maternal mortality rates remained high for certain subgroups. An increasing number of new mothers chose to bottle-feed their infants rather than breastfeed as more women held full-time occupations outside of the household. Additionally, large numbers of children in low-income families received no medical or dental care. However, introduction of the polio vaccine and increased funding for MCH programs allowed some continued progress to occur, including increased services and support for children with intellectual and developmental disabilities and their families.\n\nCategory: Milestones\n\n1950: National Association for Retarded Children\n\nBACKGROUND\n\nAs a result of the Mid-Century White House Conference, the National Association for Retarded Children (now called The Arc of the United States, or The Arc) was formed.\n\nIMPACT\n\nAt the time of its formation, there was little support or assistance available for people with intellectual disabilities or their families. While the Arc began as a grassroots movement, it has grown and adapted over time.

The first Secretary of HEW was Texas native Oveta Culp Hobby, who served as Commander of the Women's Army Corps in World War II and was editor and publisher of the Houston Post. There were six major components of the new Department: the Public Health Service; the Office of Education; the Food and Drug Administration; the Social Security Administration; the Office of Vocational Rehabilitation; and Saint Elizabeths Hospital.\n\nIMPACT\n\nThe creation of a new Cabinet-level department assured that the areas of health, education and social security were represented in the President’s Cabinet and improved federal administration of the government’s human services programs.\n\nRELATED LINKS\n\nA History of HEW\n\nHEW Introduction\n\nRELATED PINPOINTS\n\n1946: Children’s Bureau Placed in Federal Security Agency\n\n1967: Reorganization of the Children’s Bureau\n\n1981: Department of Health and Human Services\n\nCategory: Government and Policy\n\n5/17/1954: Brown v.

This decision challenged the long held opinion that a separate but equal education system was legally and socially acceptable. This same ruling was used in Utah in 1969 to support the decision requiring fair and equal education for mentally retarded students.\n\nCategory: Milestones\n\n1954: Polio Vaccine Developed\n\nBACKGROUND\n\nThree immunologically distinct polio viruses were established as causative agents of poliomyelitis during the 1940s.

It was estimated that 4,037,000 children under age 12 lived in households where the mother worked full-time. A Children's Bureau survey found that 400,000 of these children had no adult supervision during the day.\n\nIMPACT\n\nAfter World War II, the workforce opened up to women prior to the establishment of provisions for children.

President Kennedy initiated programs for people with intellectual and developmental disabilities. The Civil Rights Act prohibited discrimination on the grounds of race, color or national origin. President Lyndon B. Johnson declared a War on Poverty and established programs that had a wide range of impacts on the MCH population. Head Start, Neighborhood Health Centers, Maternity and Infant Care Projects, Medicaid, the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development (NICHD), and MCH Research program all had their roots in the 1960s.\n\n1960: The Genetic Code\n\nBACKGROUND\n\nScientists knew that the genetic information encoded into DNA is translated into proteins with the help of an intermediary molecule -- messenger RNA (mRNA), but they did not know how the information was encoded or decoded. They also suspected that each element of the code -- a codon -- would have to consist of three mRNA bases to allow enough combinations to code for the 20 known amino acids that make up proteins. In 1960, Francis Crick, Sydney Brenner and others demonstrated clearly that the genetic code is structured as a set three mRNA bases -- a triplet code. Additional work during the 1960s, pioneered by Marshall Nirenberg and Heinrich Mattaei, identified the triplet combinations that specified each amino acid and other coded messages that help to control the translation of mRNA into protein.\n\nIMPACT\n\nIdentification of the genetic code increased our understanding of the relationship between DNA and protein structure. It provided insights into the effects of changes in DNA sequences on phenotype, into the mechanism of protein synthesis, into the relationship between mutations and disease, and into the manipulation of the genetic material to produce specific phenotypes. The discovery that the DNA code is universal in the living world also affirms the relatedness of all life on Earth by descent with modification from common ancestors.\n\nCategory: Public Health and Medicine\n\n3/27/1960: Golden Anniversary White House Conference on Children and Youth\n\nBACKGROUND\n\nThe 1960 Golden Anniversary White House Conference on Children and Youth was convened by President Eisenhower. The conference was named in celebration of the 50th anniversary of the first White House Conference on Children and Youth, which was convened by President Roosevelt in 1909. The conference was held during a time when child poverty rates were at an all-time high, with over 20% of families with children under 18 years of age living in poverty.\n\nIMPACT\n\nThe Golden Anniversary White House Conference on Children and Youth addressed myriad contextual issues related to deprivation, poverty, civil rights abuses, and racial discrimination. These included: i) drug abuse, ii) inadequate opportunities for employment, iii) concern for the environment, iv) increased incidence of sexually transmitted diseases, and v) an increasing number of children born out of wedlock. Although health issues were not specifically addressed during this conference, an urgent concern was expressed for the improvement of health services for mothers and children.\n\nRELATED PINPOINTS\n\n1909: White House Conference on Dependent Children\n\n1919: White House Conference on Standards of Child Welfare\n\n1930: White House Conference on Child Protection\n\n1940: White House Conference on Children in a Democracy\n\n1950: Mid-Century White House Conference on Children and Youth\n\n1970: White House Conference on Children and Youth\n\nCategory: Public Health and Medicine\n\n1960: Birth Control Pills Approved for Use\n\nBACKGROUND\n\nIn 1960, Enovid - the first birth control pill, was approved for use in the U.S. by the Food and Drug Administration.\n\nIMPACT\n\nThe approval and later widespread use of the birth control pill in the U.S. was revolutionary. For the first time, women had control over their childbearing through a pill. Within two years, 1.2 million women in the U.S. were using the pill.

The test became known as the \"Guthrie Test.” Its methodology, including the later use of dried blood spots on pieces of filter paper, became widely used to screen newborns for many conditions.\n\nIMPACT\n\nEventually the PKU test became the nation's first universal newborn screening (NBS) test. NBS for PKU allows for the early treatment of the condition and the prevention of its harmful effects, including brain damage and intellectual disability. NBS now occurs in virtually every developed country in the world.\n\nHRSA’s Maternal and Child Health Bureau (formerly the Children’s Bureau) has been actively involved in the evolution of NBS from its very beginnings; the Bureau played a pivotal role in developing the PKU-NBS blood test and has assisted states in developing statewide NBS programs.\n\nRELATED LINK\n\nMedlinePlus - Phenylketonuria (PKU)\n\nRELATED PINPOINTS\n\n1912: Children's Bureau\n\n1938: Initiation of the March of Dimes\n\n1999: Newborn Screening Task Force Report\n\n2000: MCH Heritable Disorders Program Authorized\n\n2004: MCH Heritable Disorders Program Implemented\n\n2005: Uniform Newborn Screening Panel\n\n2008: Newborn Screening Saving Lives Act\n\nCategory: Public Health and Medicine\n\n1961: Panel on Mental Retardation\n\nBACKGROUND\n\nA 25 person Panel on Mental Retardation was appointed by President Kennedy on October 11, 1961.

The report contained 112 recommendations that concerned research, preventive health measures, clinical and social services, facilities for care, and public education programs. Some say that this report is one of the most well researched, comprehensive, and multifaceted documents that exists in the disability field. The report prompted new legislation, including Public Law 88-164, which funded research centers in university and community facilities for people with developmental disabilities (formerly mental retardation), and amendments to the Social Security Act (Public Law 88-156) to increase maternal and child health services and to conduct state studies on the status of services for people with mental retardation.\n\nRELATED PINPOINTS\n\n1963: Title V Appropriation for Research\n\n10/31/1963 Community Mental Health Act\n\nCategory: Government and Policy\n\n1962: Battered Child Syndrome\n\nBACKGROUND\n\nIn 1962, Henry Kempe described the term \"Battered Child Syndrome\" in an article describing a child who had been severely physically abused.

Services included health and dental care, transportation, pharmaceuticals, occupational health and safety, and a variety of pediatric services.\n\nIMPACT\n\nToday the Migrant Health Program is administered by HRSA's Bureau of Primary Health Care. In 2016, these health clinics served more than 860,000 migrant and seasonal farmworkers, and the majority (90%) were of Hispanic origin.

Recommendations from the Panel on Mental Retardation, appointed by President Kennedy, provided the foundation for this public law.\n\nPublic Law 88-156 also led to the creation of Maternity and Infant Care (MIC) projects. These MIC projects were funded by the Children’s Bureau and took a multidisciplinary approach to increasing access to prenatal care in the hopes of preventing infant mortality.\n\nIMPACT\n\nBefore prenatal care was routinely provided, some of the MIC projects sent teams of professionals into communities to bring poor women in for their first prenatal care visits. These MIC projects developed programs for prenatal care, family planning, and infant care, which later become models of care for the U.S.\n\nThe projects dedicated to the health of people with intellectual disabilities aimed to manage and prevent intellectual disabilities.

The act shifted resources away from large institutions that historically hospitalized people with mental illnesses to establish comprehensive community health centers nationwide.\n\nIMPACT\n\nThe Community Mental Health Act led to the creation of comprehensive community mental health centers across the country that helped children, youth, and adults with mental illnesses move back to their communities. In turn, this led to drastic drops in rates of institutionalizations and increased community-based care – by 1980, institutionalization declined by 75% nationwide. Moreover, the passage of this act demonstrated the cost-effectiveness of treatment in community settings compared to institutionalization.

The report from this panel became the blueprint for Head Start. In 1965, project Head Start began as a summer program launched under the auspices of the Office of Economic Opportunity. This summer program aimed to break the cycle of poverty through aid to preschool children from low-income families. The subsequent Head Start programs were primarily set in low-income settings with significant attention devoted to learning, social development, and health care for economically disadvantaged preschool children.\n\nIMPACT\n\nHead Start was enthusiastically received by education child development specialists, community leaders, and parents across the nation.\n\nToday, Head Start provides child development programs to pregnant women, families, and children from birth to age five with the overarching goal of increasing school readiness for children from low-income families.

Duties that remained with the Children's Bureau after the HEW reorganization were transferred to the newly created Office of Child Development. When this occurred, the health programs of the Children's Bureau were transferred to the U.S. Public Health Service, in an agency now known as the Maternal and Child Health Bureau, part of the Health Resources and Services Administration.\n\nRELATED LINKS\n\nThe Children’s Bureau\n\nHRSA's Maternal and Child Health Bureau\n\nRELATED PINPOINTS\n\n1912: Children's Bureau\n\n1946: Children's Bureau Placed in Federal Security Agency\n\n1953: Department of Health, Education and Welfare\n\nCategory: Government and Policy\n\n1967: Medicaid & EPSDT\n\nBACKGROUND\n\nThe Medicaid statute (Title XIX) was amended in 1967 under President Lyndon B. Johnson to create the Early and Periodic Screening, Diagnosis and Treatment (EPSDT) program for needy children, although regulations for EPSDT were not published until 1972. Much of the language of EPSDT came from the Crippled Children's legislation of 1935. The purpose of EPSDT was to identify and diagnose health problems of low-income children through the provision of periodic physical and developmental examinations. The program also provided funds for the treatment of illnesses and other health conditions.\n\nIMPACT\n\nAs a required program in every state, EPSDT aims to improve the health of low-income children by financing appropriate and necessary pediatric services for infants, children, and youth under age 21 who are enrolled in Medicaid.\n\nRELATED LINK\n\nEPSDT\n\nCategory: Government and Policy\n\n1968: Expansion of Lunch & Nutrition Act\n\nBACKGROUND\n\nIn 1968, Congress passed legislation to expand the National School Lunch Act. This expansion funded food for school-age children during the summer and extended the School Breakfast Program. Additionally, a year-round program was initiated to provide food to children from low-income families, in day-care centers, and in Head Start programs.\n\nIMPACT\n\nThis legislation increased the availability of food for children in need year-round. Today, these programs continue to support children receiving an adequate diet both during and outside of school hours.\n\nRELATED LINK\n\nNational School Lunch Program\n\nRELATED PINPOINTS\n\n1946: The National School Lunch Act\n\n1966: Child Nutrition Act\n\nCategory: Government and Policy\n\n1969: White House Conference on Food, Nutrition, and Health\n\nBACKGROUND\n\nIn 1969, President Nixon convened the White House Conference on Food, Nutrition, and Health in an effort to reduce malnutrition and hunger among the nation’s poor.\n\nIMPACT\n\nThe White House Conference on Food, Nutrition, and Health shed light on the importance of nutrition in maintaining a healthy nation. Many landmark policies were developed from this conference, including further development of the food stamp program, the school lunch program, and food labeling.\n\nCategory: Government and Policy\n\n1969: Rubella Vaccine Licensed\n\nBACKGROUND\n\nRubella is a virus usually spread through mucus droplets expelled by coughing or sneezing into the environment. From 1963-1964, 12 million people developed rubella in the U.S. As a result of pregnant women contracting rubella, 20,000 babies were born with serious disabilities and there were 11,000 fetal deaths. The rubella vaccine was licensed in June 1969.\n\nIMPACT\n\nAfter the rubella vaccine was licensed, the number of cases fell dramatically. In 2004, rubella was eliminated from the United States. Today very few cases occur each year, usually while unvaccinated people are traveling outside of the U.S.\n\nRELATED LINK\n\nPregnancy and Rubella\n\nCategory: Public Health and Medicine\n\nThe 1970s\n\nThe 1970s further expanded on the developments in maternal and child health set forth in the decade prior.
