        "text": "[Congressional Record Volume 153, Number 42 (Monday, March 12, 2007)] [House] [Pages H2412-H2414] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov] COMMENDING THE GIRL SCOUTS ON THEIR 95TH ANNIVERSARY Mr. DAVIS of Illinois. Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and agree to the resolution (H. Res. 136) commending the Girl Scouts of the United States of America on the occasion of their 95th anniversary, for providing quality age-appropriate experiences that prepare girls to become the leaders of tomorrow and for raising issues important to girls. The Clerk read as follows: H. Res. 136 Whereas the Girl Scouts of the United States of America (hereinafter referred to as the ``Girl Scouts'') is an organization that is committed to helping girls of today become leaders of tomorrow and that delivers quality experiences for girls locally, nationally, and internationally (through USA Girl Scouts Overseas); Whereas the Girl Scouts are celebrating their 95th anniversary on March 12, 2007; Whereas the Girl Scout program is girl-driven, reflecting the ever-changing needs and interests of participating girls, and provides girls with a wide variety of opportunities through its new mission statement, ``Girl Scouting builds girls of courage, confidence, and character, who make the world a better place.''; Whereas the Girl Scouts encourage increased skill-building and responsibility, and also promotes the development of strong leadership and decision-making skills, through program activities that are age-appropriate and based on the ``Girl Scout Promise and Law''; Whereas at all levels of the Girl Scouts, girls participate in activities that build self-confidence, responsibility, integrity, creative decision-making skills, and teamwork, helping them take steps toward becoming the leaders of tomorrow and developing real-world leadership abilities that will last them a lifetime; Whereas the Girl Scouts advocate for public policy that is girl-centered and beneficial to all girls; Whereas the Girl Scouts recognize that approximately 9,000,000 children over the age of 6 are obese; that obesity is highest among girls coming from families with low-income levels, and that fewer than 1 in 3 adolescents participate in an acceptable amount of physical exercise, with girls getting less exercise than boys overall; and Whereas the Girl Scouts are focusing on promoting healthy living for girls during 2007 and recognize through a recent study ``The New Normal: What Girls are Saying About Healthy Living'' that girls define ``health'' as a combination of diet and exercise as well as emotional well-being and self- esteem: Now, therefore, be it Resolved, That the House of Representatives-- (1) commends the Girl Scouts of the United States of America for its efforts to launch a national dialogue on the issue of obesity among young girls; (2) recognizes the Girl Scouts of the United States of America for its leadership and expertise in knowing the needs of girls through the work of the Girl Scout Research Institute; and (3) commends the Girl Scouts of the United States of America for continuing to actively promote issues important to girls. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to the rule, the gentleman from Illinois (Mr. Davis) and the gentleman from Georgia (Mr. Westmoreland) each will control 20 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Illinois. General Leave Mr. DAVIS of Illinois. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from Illinois? There was no objection. Mr. DAVIS of Illinois. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, it was a brisk March morning when Juliette Gordon Low placed a historic phone call to her cousin in Savannah, Georgia. Juliette said, ``Come right over. I've got something for the girls of Savannah, and all of America, and the world, and we're going to start it tonight.'' That phone call proved to be a historic one. On the evening of March 12, 1912, Juliette Gordon Low gathered 18 girls to register the first troop of Girl Scouts in the United States of America. With one phone call a movement was born. An organization founded upon the principles of strength, empowerment, responsibility, and community, the Girl Scouts have continued to change the lives of many girls for generations. While other organizations have struggled to deal with factors such as race and socioeconomic status, the Girl Scouts have always been looked at as an organization of inclusion, having desegregated councils as early as 1917. {time} 1445 The Girl Scouts also offer programs for girls in unusual situations that make it difficult for them to participate in the standard program. The Girl Scouts Beyond Bars programs helps daughters of incarcerated mothers to connect with their mothers and to have the mothers participate in Girl Scout activities. Another program, Girl Scouting in Detention Centers, allows girls who are themselves in detention centers to participate in scouting. Other initiatives try to help girls in rural areas or in public housing. There are also programs for American girls living overseas. Mr. Speaker, I would be remiss if I did not comment on one of my favorite Girl Scout traditions, which is the annual cookie sale. For many years, I was overjoyed when I would see the little girls selling cookies door to door. I personally like the shortbread cookies. It is because of the long-standing history and commitment of the Girl Scouts of the United States of America that I commend them and ask my colleagues for their support in the passage of this commendation without delay. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. WESTMORELAND. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself as much time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, today commemorates the 95th anniversary of the founding of the Girl Scouts of the United States of America. Founder Juliette Daisy Gordon Low organized the first Girl Scout meeting with 18 girls in Savannah, Georgia. While living in the United Kingdom, Low dreamed of giving the United States something for all girls and envisioned exposing girls to helping their communities and enjoying the outdoors. The organization went through many different name changes, but it was finally renamed as we know it today in 1947. It was later chartered by the United States Congress on March 16, 1950. For 95 years, the Girl Scout organization has provided real-world leadership training for over 50 million girls and young women across the Nation. Today, overall membership includes 2.7 million girl members and 928,000 adult members, working primarily as volunteers. Mr. Speaker, I am proud to say [[Page H2413]] that my two oldest granddaughters are members of the Girl Scouts of America. The important guidance given to girls goes far beyond the eagerly anticipated annual sale of Thin Mints, Tagalongs and Dos si Dos, now made without any trans fat. Through their various programs, the organization instills the ideals of character, conduct, leadership, as well as service to others. They have recently launched a program for girls focused on healthy living that includes education regarding diet and exercise. This important education has been instituted because of the national concern about obesity among children and the knowledge that a program such as this has been proven to lead to emotional and physical well- being. The Girl Scouts organization has long been committed to helping girls of today become leaders of tomorrow through activities that build self- confidence, responsibility, integrity, creative decision-making skills, and teamwork. It can be difficult growing up, especially in today's society. The Girl Scouts is one organization that has consistently guided members to believe that girls can do anything by offering girls aged 5 through 17 a variety of opportunities through their scouting programs. The Girl Scouts are woven into the fabric of American life and have affected girls' lives, as well as their families, in virtually every community in the country. Girl Scout programs continue to expand, taking into account the diverse population of America today. They have initiated outreach programs that strive to include all cultures as part of their mission to foster the qualities on which the United States depends. The Girl Scouts not only reach out to girls in the United States but through U.S.A. Girl Scouts Overseas, it is committed to helping girls worldwide become leaders of tomorrow. Their new vision statement sums up all that is good about this organization by saying, ``Girl Scouting builds girls of courage, confidence, and character, who make the world a better place.'' For this reason, Mr. Speaker, I urge all my colleagues to join me in supporting H. Res. 136. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. DAVIS of Illinois. Mr. Speaker, I want to thank the gentleman from Georgia for his eloquent remarks, and it is my pleasure to yield such time as she might consume to the gentlewoman from New York (Mrs. McCarthy), the sponsor of this legislation. Mrs. McCARTHY of New York. Mr. Speaker, I thank Mr. Davis of Illinois and Congressman Westmoreland from Georgia, also. March marks the 95th anniversary of the Girl Scouts of the United States of America. Founded in 1912 by Juliette Gordon Low, with only 18 members, Girl Scouts is now the finest organization for girls in the world, with close to 4 million active members and more than 50 million former members, and I am proud to say I am one of them. Girl Scouts provides high-quality, age-appropriate experiences for girls locally, nationally and internationally that build girls of courage, confidence, and character, who make the world a better place. For 95 years, Girl Scouts has served girls through a remarkable leadership development program delivered by dedicated volunteers in every community across the country. All programs are girl-driven and provide girls with a wide variety of leadership building activities that promote teamwork and the development of strong decision-making skills. There are many programs to choose from, including more than 70 achievement badges encouraging girls to pursue education and careers in math, science and engineering, an anti-bullying and violence prevention program, and a program that connects girls with their mothers who are incarcerated. Girl Scouts also offer a huge range of outreach activities to girls who have never had the opportunity to be a Girl Scout, including Latina and Native American girls, along with girls in rural communities and in public housing developments. Girl Scouts recognizes the importance of giving a voice to girls by sharing original research reviews that have helped change the dialogue among the media, policymakers and community leaders on issues important to girls. They have released numerous reports that have helped shape policy discussions in this country. In celebrating 95 years of excellence and the significant contributions, Girl Scouts will raise the bar in being the voice for all girls. Help me commend the Girl Scouts of the United States of America for its leadership and expertise in meeting the needs of girls throughout their 95 years of remarkable programs, knowledge and information about girls who recognize the nearly 1 million current adult volunteers and volunteers through the decades. Mr. Speaker, spending time as a Girl Scout when I was a young child I have to say was a wonderful, wonderful experience. Back then, we only worked on homemaking skills. We did things that girls did in the early 1960s, but today I am proud to say that when you see the Girl Scouts working together, serving, certainly volunteerism in nursing homes and helping our elderly, mentoring for those students that need it, they have come a long way and they are on the right track, certainly expanding their horizon for what they are going to do. When they meet with other Girl Scouts internationally, it is a wonderful opportunity so different countries can get to know each other. They are the future of our Nation, and I am proud of them, and I urge my colleagues to pass this resolution. Mr. WESTMORELAND. Mr. Speaker, I have no other speakers at this time, and I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. DAVIS of Illinois. Mr. Speaker, it is my pleasure to yield such time as he might consume to the gentleman from Georgia (Mr. Barrow). Mr. BARROW. I thank the gentleman for yielding. Mr. Speaker, it is with a certain amount of personal pride and a great deal of civic pride that I join my colleagues in support of this resolution today. On the civic side of things, I have the privilege of representing Savannah, Georgia, in the U.S. House of Representatives. It is my hometown. Juliette Gordon Low founded the Girl Scouts in Savannah. She was a native of Savannah. She founded the organization in 1912. The first organization's headquarters was in the back of her home in Savannah, Georgia, and from that humble beginning some 95 years ago we have gone from 18 members to almost 4 million members worldwide. I go by that building every time I am in town on the way to work, walking on the streets. It gives me a great deal of civic pride, along with the rest of my fellow Savannahians, who recognize that Girl Scouts the world over look to Savannah as the home and the homeplace of Girl Scouting. On a personal level, I venture to say that very few of us guys in the U.S. House of Representatives are closer to Girl Scouting than I am. I have three sisters. Every one of them was a Girl Scout, including my twin sister, and I can tell you as a guy you don't get much closer to Girl Scouting than that. I know that there are lots of organizations that promote courage, confidence and character in young girls but none do as good a job as the Girl Scouts. On behalf of my hometown, on behalf of the 700,000 people that I have privilege of representing in Congress, and on behalf of the millions of brothers of Girl Scouts the worldwide, I am proud to congratulate the Girl Scouts on their 95th anniversary, and I extend my best wishes for the next 95 years. Mr. WESTMORELAND. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. DAVIS of Illinois. Mr. Speaker, it is just good to know that in addition to the great scenic beauty and southern charm that Savannah is so well-noted for, that other good things have come from there, and certainly the Girl Scouts of America. I would urge all Members to vote in favor of this legislation. Mr. PATRICK J. MURPHY of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to join the Girl Scouts of the USA in celebrating their 95th anniversary. Since its founding in 1912, the Girl Scouts has become the world's preeminent organization for girls. Back then they had just 18 members, but today, there are 3.7 million Girl Scouts--2.7 million girl members and 928,000 adult members working primarily as volunteers. [[Page H2414]] Girl Scouting builds confidence, character, and leadership skills which allow girls to grow into young women who make positive contributions to the world around them. Each unique experience, be it reading to younger students or participating in a math competition, empowers girls and helps them reach their full potential. On the national level, the Girl Scouts of the USA has been an advocate for girls' involvement in math, science and engineering; for violence prevention and for the health and safety of all girls. Through their many government and corporate partnerships, the Girl Scouts bring innovative programming to girls throughout the country and expand their reach to underserved communities where girls need it most. Mr. Speaker, I am proud that the Girl Scouts of Freedom Valley, which serves my district, has over 21,000 members and 7,000 adult volunteers. I am proud to have such a wonderful team of volunteers dedicated to the leadership and character development of girls in Southeastern Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, I know that all of us take pride knowing that each and every Girl Scout of today will be one of tomorrow's leaders. I know the Girl Scouts of the USA will celebrate many more anniversaries and continue to be a positive influence on our Nation's girls and on our society for generations to come. Mr. DAVIS of Illinois. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the gentleman from Illinois (Mr. Davis) that the House suspend the rules and agree to the resolution, H. Res. 136. The question was taken. The SPEAKER pro tempore. In the opinion of the Chair, two-thirds being in the affirmative, the ayes have it. Mr. DAVIS of Illinois. Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays. The yeas and nays were ordered. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to clause 8 of rule XX and the Chair's prior announcement, further proceedings on this question will be postponed. ____________________"
