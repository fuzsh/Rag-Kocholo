        "text": "Loma Linda University School of Allied Health Professions Respiratory Care Program has received the Apex Recognition Award from the American Association for Respiratory Care (AARC). This is the second time the school has earned this distinction.\n\nThe two-year national recognition award identifies the School of Allied Health Profession’s Bachelor of Science in Respiratory Care entry-level program as having best practices in educating future practitioners and patient safety.\n\nThe AARC Apex Recognition Award was developed in 2017 as a way for the AARC board of directors to recognize healthcare organizations and respiratory care programs that highlight best practices aligned with evidence-based medicine.\n\nDavid Lopez, EdD, RCP, RRT, chair of the department of cardiopulmonary sciences at the School of Allied Health, says that since achieving this recognition for the first time in 2021, the team has continued to meet all 16 standards required for the AARC APEX award designation.\n\n“The skills and stamina of our respiratory care department have been tested like never before. As a vital component to a patient's care team, respiratory therapists work hard each day to deliver quality patient care,” says Lopez. “With the support of our faculty and the outstanding national board performance of our alumni, It’s an honor to receive consecutive recognition for this elite distinction issued to only seven other programs in the nation.”\n\nFounded in 1947, the AARC is the leading national and international professional association for respiratory care. The award program distinguishes organizations for their commitment to excellence in professional development, evidence-based care, patient safety, patient satisfaction, and quality improvement. The Apex Recognition Award includes five categories for recognition: acute care hospitals, long-term care facilities, home medical equipment companies, entry-level educational programs, and dedicated transport teams."
