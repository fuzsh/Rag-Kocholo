This award recognizes outstanding technical performance.\n\n1964\n\nPlasmapheresis is introduced as a means of collecting plasma for fractionation.\n\n1968\n\nAABB/Fenwal Scholarships are created to promote interest in research, development and continuing education in the field of blood banking.\n\n1970\n\nPresident Nixon proclaims January as the first “National Blood Donor Month” to honor voluntary blood donor and to help blood centers recruit new donors.\n\n1971\n\nPostmaster General Winton M.
