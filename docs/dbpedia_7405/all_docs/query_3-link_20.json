The Government's policy, announced in the same order, was that civil rights were guaranteed by the Constitution and essential to domestic tranquility, national security, the general welfare, and the continued existence of our free institutions. The advisory committee was chaired by Charles E. Wilson. The final report of the committee was published in 1947 as a one-hundred-and-seventy-eight page document entitled To Secure These Rights.\n\nThe President's Committee on Civil Rights had the following members: Ms. Sadie T. Alexander, Mr. James B. Carey, Mr. John S. Dickey, Mr. Morris L Ernst, Rabbi Roland B. Gittelsohn, Dr. Frank P. Graham, The Most Reverend Francis J. Haas, Mr. Charles Luckman, Mr. Francis P. Matthews, Mr. Franklin D. Roosevelt, Jr., The Right Reverend Henry Knox Sherrill, Mr. Boris Shishkin, Ms. M.E. Tilly, Mr. Channing H. Tobias, and Charles E. Wilson (Chairman). Robert K. Carr was Executive Secretary of the committee. All departments and agencies of the Federal Government were instructed to cooperate with the committee and furnish it with information and services as required. The committee conducted an inquiry; held public hearings; solicited advice; examined the evidence; and made recommendations for policy improvements to carry out the mandate of Executive Order 9808. President Truman used the report as the basis for a special civil rights message to Congress and for executive orders leading to the desegregation of the armed forces and an end to discrimination in the Civil Service system.\n\n[ Top | Administrative Information | Agency History | Collection Description | Series Descriptions | Folder Title List ] COLLECTION DESCRIPTION\n\nThe Records of the President's Committee on Civil Rights (Record Group 220) came to the Truman collection from the National Archives in 1955.
