For the fifth year in a row, the OSU RT Program has been recognized by our accreditation agency, CoARC, as one of the select group of programs in the nation recognized for the Distinguished RRT Credentialing Success Award!

Senior students form teams, develop, and conduct research projects and also broaden their clinical experiences in specialty areas. Participating in the Denman Undergraduate Research Forum is expected. See the “Research” tab for more information.\n\nExperienced Faculty\n\nThe Faculty is comprised of experienced, licensed, RRTs with graduate degrees including 2 with doctoral degrees, and our pulmonary board-certified medical director. Some faculty have specialty credentials in neonatal/pediatrics and pulmonary function technology, and some are nationally known for their research and service to the profession. Students consistently rate our faculty among the best teachers at the university.\n\nFaculty have received many awards including, the AARC Education Practitioner of the Year, the OSRC Education Practitioner of the Year, the OSRC Researcher of the Year, ARCF Fellowship in Mechanical Ventilation, AARC Fellowship, INO Therapeutics Literary Award, OSRC Outstanding Lifetime Contributor Award, and the HRS Teaching Award.\n\nGraduates in Demand\n\nOpportunities! 4-5+ job offers for each graduate + hiring bonuses!
