        "text": "our History\n\nSince 1985, the GLBT Historical Society has been committed to preserving and sharing LGBTQ history. We have grown significantly since our founding, from a living room full of boxes to professionally managed archive. With more than 1,000 archival collections and over 26,000 museum visitors each year, the society is now an international leader in the field of LGBTQ history, and one of the most important queer cultural institutions in the world.\n\nAs we celebrate the our history, we look confidently towards the future. Support the future of LGBTQ history by making a donation today!\n\n1985\n\nOn March 16, more than 60 people attend a public meeting at the old San Francisco Main Library (now the Asian Art Museum) to propose establishing an association to document and promote understanding of Bay Area queer history. The meeting, organized by Eric Garber, Jim Gordon, Terry Henderling, Ellen Klages, Greg Pennington and Willie Walker, built on smaller gatherings that had started the previous fall, and included members of the San Francisco Lesbian and Gay History Project, which had begun in the late 1970s, and the San Francisco Gay and Lesbian Periodical Archives, which had begun in 1983. On May 18, the membership votes to name the organization the San Francisco Bay Area Gay and Lesbian Historical Society and elects the first board of directors, including co-chairs Ilene Brettholz and Willie Walker (1949–2004).\n\nThe society accessions a major collection from Louis Sullivan (1951–1991), a pioneering gay and transgender activist and historian, a founding member of the GLBT Historical Society, and the founder of the group now known as FTM International. The collection includes correspondence, photos, essays, poems and diaries, some of which were reprinted in 2019 as We Both Laughed in Pleasure: The Selected Diaries of Lou Sullivan.\n\n1993\n\nThe estate of Crawford Wayne Barton (1943–1993) donates an enormous collection, following the photographer’s death from AIDS. The photos in the collection offer a rare glimpse into gay life in 1970s San Francisco, and a significant number have since been digitized.\n\n1994\n\nThe society acquires the extensive papers of activists Del Martin (1921–2008) and Phyllis Lyon (1924-2020). The collection includes the complete records of the Daughters of Bilitis, the first lesbian organization in the United States, and The Ladder, the organization’s monthly magazine. The donation is one of the many extensive archival collections held by the historical society that document decades of LGBTQ organizing and activism.\n\n1996\n\nThirty-five years after he became the first openly gay candidate for public office, José Julio Sarria (1922–2013) donates a considerable archival collection to the society. The collection documents more than a half century of his life, including his political candidacy; his work as a founding member of the League for Civil Education, the Society for Individual Rights, and the Tavern Guild; and his role as “Her Royal Majesty, Empress of San Francisco, José I, The Widow Norton,” the persona he adopted as the founder of the Imperial Court System.\n\n1997\n\nThe society helps to mark the centenary of the world’s first homosexual-rights organization by lending around 30 items to the monumental “Goodbye to Berlin?” exhibition mounted by the Schwules Museum at the Akademie der Künste in Berlin. This collaboration is one of dozens that have made the society’s collections available and accessible to audiences around the world.\n\nTwenty years after its first national convention, the National Association of Black and White Men Together (NABWMT) donates a significant collection of organizational history to the society. The Association is a gay multiracial, multicultural, political and social organization, founded in 1980, with more than 30 chapters around the U.S.\n\n2002\n\nWith a grant from the National Film Preservation Foundation, the society conserves and digitizes material from the Harold T. O’Neal Collection, a collection of 8mm home movies of LGBTQ people made from 1939 to 1989.\n\nThe society receives a donation of pioneering activist Harvey Milk’s (1930–1978) personal artifacts, clothing and memorabilia that trace his life from the 1960s until his assassination. As an elected member of the San Francisco Board of Supervisors, most of Milk’s political papers are held by the San Francisco Public Library.\n\n2003\n\nThe society moves to 657 Mission St. in the South of Market district. At the new location, the organization establishes its first dedicated galleries with an exhibition on the life and death of Harvey Milk. Photo shows the gallery space, with the suit Milk was wearing on the day of his assassination in the foreground.\n\n2004\n\n2018\n\nThe society continues making its collections accessible by providing digital access. In January, it debuts an online archive of the Bay Area Reporter, a weekly LGBTQ newspaper published in San Francisco. The society also digitizes a selection of its archival holdings related to the AIDS epidemic and posts them online for researchers, in partnership with the University of California, San Francisco and the San Francisco Public Library.\n\nThree decades after his death, the Society accessions a collection documenting the life of Sylvester (1947–1988), a famed African American genderqueer disco performer and singer-songwriter. The collection contains performance costumes, family photographs, press materials, awards, albums, and personal items.\n\n2019\n\nSan Francisco Mayor London Breed publicly supports the society’s efforts to create the world’s first full-scale LGBTQ museum and research center. “I am excited to be here to celebrate the GLBT Museum that we are hoping will open in San Francisco because it is long overdue…We know we need a place in San Francisco. Curating and documenting LGBT history is critical to the success of San Francisco.”\n\n2019\n\nAhead of schedule for the Vision 2020 campaign, the society completes a study showing that the plan to create a new LGBTQ museum and research center is not only feasible, but necessary.\n\nIn June, the GLBT Historical Society joins the Committee on LGBT History in co-hosting Queer History Conference 2019, a national conference at San Francisco State University.\n\n2020\n\nMayor London Breed pledges significant financial support from the City and County of San Francisco to opening a full-scale museum of LGBTQ history and culture. With support from local and statewide elected officials, as well as broad-based interest and investment in the project, the society moves confidently into the next phase of its campaign.\n\nCredits and Authorship\n\nThis timeline was adapted by the GLBT Historical Society from research conducted by Gerard Koskovich.\n\nGerard Koskovich is a San Francisco–based historian, curator and rare book dealer.
