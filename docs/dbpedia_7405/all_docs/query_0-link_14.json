        "text": "In 1993, the New York State (NYS) legislature and governor signed into law the Respiratory Therapy Guide to Practice Education Law to guide and regulate the profession of respiratory care under the auspices of the New York State Education Department. New guidelines were implemented by the New York State Education Department for respiratory therapists (RTs) in 2010 to provide the opportunity for RTs to receive continuing education units (CEUs) when participating as clinical preceptors. This study was conducted in June 2012 to determine the extent to which the NYS RTs are aware of the new licensing guidelines and amendments. In June 2012, a web-based survey was e-mailed to 2,503 NYS members of the New York State Society for Respiratory Care, 14% of which (n= 360) completed the survey. The survey included 21 items to assess RTs&#39; awareness of the licensing guidelines that were implemented in 2010, and these respondents were analyzed using basic descriptive statistics. The study show...\n\nThe 2005 American Association for Respiratory Care Human Resources Survey suggested that the national demand for respiratory therapists (RTs) exceeds the supply. At the Cleveland Clinic an expected hospital expansion of 350 beds by 2008 has increased the need for RT staff. This report describes a strategy by which we developed a plan, in concert with local RT colleges, to recruit RTs. Local RT managers were surveyed regarding demand for RTs. We developed a recruitment plan, based on discussions with RT program directors. The survey data and models estimated an annual mean of 33.4 new positions in northeast Ohio. Despite the fact that approximately 84 people graduated from northeast Ohio RT programs yearly in 2004 to 2007, the growth in demand for RTs exceeded the estimated supply. The main factor that caused RT schools to limit the supply of RTs was the paucity of clinical sites. Our analysis shows the schools could achieve a 40% increase in student output, and that if the Cleveland...\n\nThe American Association for Respiratory Care has established a task force to identify potential new roles and responsibilities of respiratory therapists (RTs) in 2015 and beyond. The first task force conference confirmed that the healthcare system in the United States is on the verge of dramatic change, driven by the need to decrease costs and improve quality. Use of evidence-based protocols that follow a nationally accepted standard of practice, and application of biomedical innovation continue to be important competency areas for RTs. The goal of the second task force conference was to identify specific competencies needed to assure safe and effective execution of RT roles and responsibilities in the future. The education needed by the workforce to assume the new responsibilities emerging as the healthcare system changes starts with a close look at the compe-tencies that will be needed by graduate RTs upon entry into practice. Future specialty practice areas for experienced RTs are identified without defining specific competencies. We present the findings of the task force on the competencies needed by graduate RTs upon entry into practice in 2015.\n\nFew health care workers are directly involved in conducting research, but all must be able to read and understand scientific reports in medical journals. They must be familiar with the basic concepts of research in order to practice as professionals. The most important skill is the ability to read and critically evaluate published reports. Health care administrators rely on the results of studies to help solve problems and make decisions about important subjects, such as cost containment, productivity assessment, and continuous quality improvement. Educators must stay current with new technology and its evidence base. Both administrators and educators must be familiar with basic research concepts in order to be informed consumers of research information. Research attempts to find answers using the scientific method. This report describes the steps in the scientific method, the overall plan for conducting scientific research, and some basic skills required to successfully conduct res..."
