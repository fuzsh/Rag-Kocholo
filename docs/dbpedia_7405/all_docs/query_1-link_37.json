        "text": "People suffering from chronic respiratory conditions such as asthma and emphysema turn to trained respiratory therapists for help. Before respiratory therapists work in hospitals, nursing care facilities, and physician offices, they begin their careers by earning either an associate degree or a bachelor's degree. After graduation, respiratory therapists further their career prospects by obtaining state licensure or certifications.\n\nRespiratory therapists primarily work in state, local, and private hospitals, where they examine patients and teach them how to use breathing equipment. The job also requires collaboration with physicians. Respiratory therapists work with patients of all ages, from infants to the elderly. The Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) projects employment in respiratory therapy to increase 21% between 2018 and 2028.\n\nKeep reading to learn how to become a respiratory therapist. The following guide also includes information about educational requirements, specialties, and compensation.\n\nRespiratory Therapist Salary and Job Growth\n\nIn 2019, respiratory therapists made a median annual salary of $61,330, according to the BLS. As with any occupation, factors such as experience and geographical location impact earnings.\n\nThe BLS reports that respiratory therapists who work in hospitals earn a median annual salary of $61,670. Those who work in physician offices earn a median annual salary of $61,120, while respiratory therapists in nursing care facilities earn a median annual salary of $59,260.\n\nSalaries increase as respiratory therapists gain experience, continue their education, and obtain certifications. The top 10% of respiratory therapists earned an annual salary of $86,980 as of May 2019. The lowest 10% of respiratory therapists earned $44,850 annually. The BLS projects employment in respiratory therapy to grow from 134,000 to 162,000 between 2018 and 2028.\n\nAlabama\n\nAmount Mean wage annual: $48,870\n\nCurrently Employed: 2,470\n\nChange in

respiratory therapists is expected to see a 23 percent increase through 2026. That translates to roughly 30,500 new jobs in the field.\n\nThe elderly are expected to be primary drivers of the need for licensed respiratory therapists to treat age-related conditions that affect the lungs, such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and emphysema. There's also expected to be increased demand for respiratory therapists to provide care in nursing homes and long-term care facilities to help reduce incidences of readmission to hospitals from these conditions.\n\nAdvances in care treatments and medications should also create increased demand for CRTs trained in these methods. Lastly, the BLS reports that respiratory therapists willing to travel to rural areas lacking licensed CRTs may have better job prospects than their peers seeking employment in urban areas that have a higher saturation of licensed CRTs.\n\nFour Steps to Becoming a Respiratory Therapist\n\nThe steps to becoming a respiratory therapist differ for every individual. However, all respiratory therapists take the steps listed below to secure a position. Keep reading for more details about how to become a respiratory therapist.\n\nStep 1\n\nComplete a Degree\n\nCollege serves as the first step toward working in respiratory therapy. At minimum, prospective respiratory therapists need an associate degree in respiratory therapy. Many students earn a bachelor's degree in respiratory therapy or pulmonary science. A program's clinical experience requirements provide students with practical training and help them understand the ethical and legal responsibilities involved in respiratory care and treatment.\n\nStep 2\n\nComplete a Credentialing Exam from the National Board for Respiratory Care\n\nEmployers often prefer new hires to hold credentials from the National Board for Respiratory Care (NBRC). Respiratory therapists take multiple-choice exams to become a certified respiratory therapist (CRT) or a registered respiratory therapist (RRT). After completing an associate degree, graduates take the CRT exam. If they score high enough, graduates obtain the RRT certification after completing a clinical exam. Visit the NBRC website for more information about the exams.\n\nStep 3\n\nEarn State Licensure\n\nMost states require licensure for respiratory therapists to work in the field. A candidate for licensure must hold an associate degree from an accredited college in respiratory therapy. The respiratory therapy program must hold accreditation from the Commission on Accreditation of Allied Health Education Programs. In some cases work experience, licensure from another state, or military experience allows candidates to waive licensure education requirements. Prospective respiratory therapists must pass the state licensing exams or the NBRC certification exam to earn a license.\n\nStep 4\n\nMaintain Certification\n\nRespiratory therapists maintain their NBRC credentials in one of three ways. First, they can opt to undergo a quarterly assessment and complete 30 continuing education hours. Acceptable continuing education units include workshops, seminars, or online courses on respiratory therapy or pulmonary function technology. Second, they can retake the same credential exam. Last, respiratory therapists can pass a new credential exam which remains valid for five years thereafter.\n\nPreparing to Become a Respiratory Therapist: Schools and Programs\n\nThe top bachelor's in respiratory therapy degrees offer affordable, flexible, and quality programs. Prospective respiratory therapists pursue either an associate or bachelor's degree in respiratory therapy. Both suffice for employment.\n\nTransfer students typically finish their respiratory therapy education in 1-4 years, depending on previous college credits. The University of Mary, which features one of the top online programs for registered respiratory therapists, allows transfer students to graduate in one year. The Oregon Institute of Technology's bachelor's in respiratory care degree prepares students to take the NBRC certification exam over four years. All programs involve clinical experiences.\n\nOnline bachelor's degrees in respiratory therapy care operate on a synchronous or asynchronous basis with optional hybrid formats. Self-paced classes allow students to complete degree requirements quickly. Alternatively, many students prefer to study in a cohort. Admissions policies vary with some schools offering rolling admissions and others requiring applicants to meet set deadlines.\n\nCourses in Respiratory Therapy Programs\n\nA respiratory therapist's education includes a broad curriculum that builds their critical thinking skills, argumentative and persuasive writing, and technical knowledge of respiratory care. Different factors impact the course load a student takes in a bachelor's in respiratory care program. Curriculum requirements differ by school. Additionally, a student's previous coursework impacts what classes they take. Undergraduates without prior college credits first take chemistry, human anatomy, and other general education units before taking the major courses.\n\nSchooling for respiratory therapy provides students with practical skills in case management and leadership. Students also hone specific technical skills in conducting cardiopulmonary stress testing, assessing chest radiographs, and preparing artificial airways through intubation and endotracheal suctioning.\n\nBefore graduating, students complete rotations and clinical simulations to test out their skills in a clinical setting. See below for examples of courses that students often take in a respiratory therapy program.\n\nCritical Care\n\nA course in critical care covers the methods used in cardiovascular treatment. Students learn important practical techniques, including cardiac life support, cardiovascular management, and nasal oxygen supplementation. The coursework also teaches undergraduates how to diagnose breathing problems such as sleep apnea.\n\nEthics and Leadership\n\nRespiratory therapists handle confidential patient information. The occupation requires a thorough understanding of professional ethics and privacy laws. This class teaches students how to manage crises and make ethical decisions. The practical skills students gain in the course help them advance to management positions.\n\nPediatric Care\n\nStudents enrolled in a pediatric care course learn about how to diagnose and treat infants, children, and adolescents. They gain skills in topics such as common diagnosis, therapeutic gases, and high-risk births. This course especially helps respiratory therapists who want to work in neonatal intensive care.\n\nIntroduction to Clinical\n\nOver the course of their education, respiratory therapists complete clinical experiences. An introduction to clinical course places students in a clinical setting to learn from healthcare professionals. Students gain practical training and make connections in respiratory therapy. Schools require that students complete a background check and drug screening prior to starting a clinical.\n\nRespiratory Case Management\n\nThis class covers the fundamentals of case management. Throughout the course, students strengthen their knowledge of respiratory disorders. They also study patient privacy, ethics, and legal standards.\n\nAccreditation for a Respiratory Therapy Program\n\nAccreditation assures quality and protects students and their investment. During the review process, third-party agencies evaluate schools and confer either regional or national accreditation. Vocational and career-focused colleges receive national accreditation. Academic schools receive regional accreditation. Many employers consider regionally accredited schools more reputable.\n\nAccreditation matters for a student's future career, financial aid, and their ability to transfer schools. Employers typically prefer to hire graduates from accredited schools. Additionally, accredited schools receive federal financial aid and distribute those funds to students. Further, students often cannot transfer credits from nationally accredited schools as easily as credits from regionally accredited schools.\n\nOnline schools receive accreditation by the same regional accrediting agencies as brick-and- mortar colleges. Respiratory therapy degrees receive programmatic accreditation from the Commission on Accreditation for Respiratory Care (CoARC), which evaluates degree outcomes and curriculum.\n\nVisit the Department of Education's database to find accredited schools and programs.\n\nRespiratory Therapist Specialties\n\nEarning a respiratory therapy degree gives students an opportunity to gain skills in niche areas. In addition to the core curriculum, a respiratory therapist's education offers specialized training.\n\nMany students earn a specialty in subjects such as pulmonary diagnostics, long-term care, or neonatal pediatrics. The specific specialties available depends on the school and the program. Much like a minor, online learners must complete additional courses to earn a specialty. Pursuing a specialty does not typically delay graduation. However, specifications for specialties vary with every program.\n\nSpecialties give students the knowledge and practical skills to become polysomnographic technologists, adult critical care specialists, or sleep disorder specialists. These courses allow students to test out their interests and solidify their career goals. The specialized skills students gain impress employers, who often seek out multitalented registered respiratory therapists.\n\nFinding a Respiratory Therapist Program\n\nRegional community colleges often offer Associate of Applied Science degrees in respiratory care or similar degree plans, which can significantly narrow down educational decisions. However, that degree path doesn't necessarily work for students who want to earn bachelor's degrees in order to diversify their career options.\n\nStudents should carefully consider the following factors prior to enrolling in a respiratory care educational program:\n\nIs the program properly accredited? There are many schools that offer respiratory care programs, but students may be required to complete a program that's been accredited by the Commission on Accreditation for Respiratory Care as a prerequisite for licensure in their home state. The National Board of Respiratory Care requires CRTs to have earned a minimum of 62 semester hours of college credit from a program that's been accredited by an agency recognized by either the U.S. Department of Education or the Council for Higher Education. The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services recognizes accreditation from both the CoARC and the Commission on Accreditation of Allied Health Education Programs. Students should check with the respiratory care board in their home state prior to enrollment to fully understand the scope of educational requirements.\n\nTuition cost: College tuition is expensive. According to the College Board's annual Trends in Higher Education survey, average tuition at public two-year colleges for the 2017-2018 academic year was $3,570, while average tuition at public four-year institutions was just under $10,000. Costs soar for private colleges to more than $34,000 per year. Students should understand the fee structure at their prospective school prior to making long-term commitments.\n\nProgram length: Most associate degree programs run for two years, while standard bachelor's programs typically take four years to complete. Students may shave some time by completing accelerated degree programs, summer and winter sessions, and online classes that allow them to move ahead.\n\nDelivery method: There are many different ways to complete a degree program in today's digital world. Students can enroll in online programs, hybrid programs that split time between online and on-campus study, and traditional on-campus programs. Students should seek a program that best fits their learning style.\n\nComponents of a Successful Respiratory Therapist Career: Skills, Credentials, Tools, and Technology\n\nRespiratory therapists who succeed in the field share common traits and characteristics. Most notably, successful registered respiratory therapists learn quickly, work well under pressure, and solve problems during emergencies. The hectic schedule of a respiratory therapist demands a highly organized, team-oriented, and adaptable worker. The job also requires effective communication skills to enable collaboration between patients and other medical professionals.\n\nEmployers commonly prefer respiratory therapists who hold NBRC credentials. Many students also boost their marketability and salary potential by becoming certified sleep disorder specialists, certified pulmonary function technologists, and adult critical care specialists.\n\nCandidates with skills in clinical technology often improve their earnings. Clinical experience during college introduces students to equipment such as respiratory function analyzers and inhalation drug delivery devices.\n\nRespiratory Therapist Professional Organizations\n\nStrong support networks ensure the success of a respiratory therapist.
