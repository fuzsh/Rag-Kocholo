        "text": "Loma Linda University School of Allied Health Professions Respiratory Program is first on the West Coast and in California to receive the Apex Recognition Award from the American Association for Respiratory Care (AARC).\n\nThe two-year national recognition award identifies the School of Allied Health Profession’s Bachelor of Science in Respiratory Care entry level program as having best practices in educating future practitioners and patient safety.\n\nThe AARC Apex Recognition Award was developed in 2017 as a way for the AARC board of directors to recognize healthcare organizations and respiratory care programs that highlight best practices aligned with evidence-based medicine.\n\n“Respiratory care departments everywhere are coming off a hard year. Their skills and stamina have been tested like never before. As a vital component to a patient's care team, respiratory therapists work hard each day to deliver quality patient care,” said Sheri Tooley, BSRT, AARC president. “These teams reach high standards and bring specialized skills, unique to respiratory care departments. We are thrilled to honor these organizations as Apex Recognition Award recipients.”\n\nFounded in 1947, the AARC is the leading national and international professional association for respiratory care. The award program distinguishes organizations for their commitment to excellence in professional development, evidence-based care, patient safety, patient satisfaction and quality improvement. The Apex Recognition Award includes five categories for recognition: acute care hospitals, long-term care facilities, home medical equipment companies, entry-level educational programs, and dedicated transport teams.\n\n“Since achieving maximum reaccreditation of 10 years by the Commission on Accreditation for Respiratory Care in 2019, we have sought to meet all 16 standards required for the AARC APEX award designation,” said Richard Nelson, MD, RRT, program director. “Through support of our faculty and the outstanding national board performance of our alumni, we have been honored as the first on the West Coast to achieve this elite distinction issued to only seven other programs in the nation.”"
