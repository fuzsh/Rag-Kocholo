        "text": "Review:\n\nAARC Career Center offers employers a targeted approach to hiring respiratory care professionals in the U.S. The platform offers feature-rich job posting options that include job distribution by email, highlighted job ads, and job post upgrades for increased exposure, as well as access to a resume database.\n\nWhile employers can manage their job ads and resume searches from a user-friendly online dashboard, the site does not offer advanced tools, such as a built-in applicant tracking system or automated candidate matching. Compared to niche alternatives TherapistJobBoard.com and CSRC Job Board, AARC Career Center is rather costly.\n\nPros:\n\nThere are three job posting packages to suit different budgets.\n\nThe Job Flash plans include job distribution by email and placement in the AARC Career Center home page rotation.\n\nThe Premium Job Flash Package keeps job ads in a top position in the search results and includes a \"Preferred Spotlight\" tag.\n\nEmployers can proactively search for candidates in a resume database.\n\nJob ads and resume searches can be managed from a user-friendly online dashboard.\n\nCons:\n\nThere is no free job posting option.\n\nThe platform is costlier than several niche competitors.\n\nThe site does not feature an applicant tracking system or automated candidate matching.\n\nReputation:\n\nWe were unable to find any online reviews of AARC Career Center.\n\nAARC Career Center vs. HealthcareSource Job Board:\n\nWhile both AARC Career Center and the HealthcareSource job board cater to medical professionals, the former reaches a more defined audience within the medical field. The HealthcareSource job board, however, reaches a larger audience and is more affordable, with pricing starting at $200.00 per post, compared to AARC Career Center's $419.00 per post."
