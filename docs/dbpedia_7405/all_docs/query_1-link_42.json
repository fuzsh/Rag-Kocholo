        "text": "CLEVELAND OH (04/03/2017) (readMedia)-- Breathing is essential to life. That's why the American Lung Association is dedicated to supporting healthy lungs and clean air, because from our first breath to our last, every breath counts. To that end, we're celebrating a historical event, the respiratory therapy profession turns 70. April 15, 1947, is known as the day the Inhalation Therapy Association (ITA) was legally chartered in the state of Illinois.\n\nIn recognition of this historical event, the Dittrick Museum of Medical History on the campus of Case Western Reserve University in Cleveland, OH, will be presenting an exhibit dedicated to the honorable work of respiratory therapists and the organization the world now knows as the American Association for Respiratory Care (AARC).\n\nThe exhibit will feature a display of historical medical equipment used through the years to treat pulmonary patients, as well as a vintage photo gallery featuring photographs collected by respiratory therapist Steve DeGenaro, RRT, and recently donated by DeGenaro to the Dittrick. The exhibit will be on display from approximately March 1 to May 1.\n\nThere will also be a featured educational event at the Dittrick on Saturday, April 22. Leaders from the profession will present an overview of the areas that had a significant impact on the profession. Speakers include AARC Past Presidents Trudy Watson, BS, RRT, FAARC, and Jerome Sullivan, PhD, RRT, FAARC; Robert Chatburn, MHHS, RRT-NPS, FAARC; Jamie Stoller, MD, FAARC; and Joe Lewarski, BS, RRT, FAARC. Proceeds will be donated to the American Respiratory Care Foundation's Virtual Museum fund.\n\nThe American Lung Association values the strides, milestones, and continual hard work of respiratory therapists across the world. The AARC promotes professional excellence within the respiratory therapy profession to support healthy lungs because when you can't breathe, nothing else matters.\n\n###\n\nAbout the American Lung Association\n\nThe American Lung Association is the leading organization working to save lives by improving lung health and preventing lung disease, through research, education and advocacy. The work of the American Lung Association is focused on four strategic imperatives: to defeat lung cancer; to improve the air we breathe; to reduce the burden of lung disease on individuals and their families; and to eliminate tobacco use and tobacco-related diseases. For more information about the American Lung Association, call 1-800-LUNGUSA (1-800-586-4872) or visit: Lung.org.\n\nAbout the AARC\n\nThe American Association for Respiratory Care is a professional association of respiratory therapists that focuses primarily on respiratory therapy education and research. The organization's goals are to ensure that respiratory patients receive safe and effective care from qualified professionals and to provide support to respiratory health care providers. Further information about the AARC is available at www.AARC.org."
