Mother Joseph entered the Caldwell Dominican Community in 1902. As a young sister, she taught at elementary and high school levels.\n\nMother Joseph was elected Mother Superior of the Caldwell Dominican Sisters in 1927 and re-elected in 1933. Due to her involvement in the creation of Caldwell College for Women at the time is was suggested that she be permitted to run again for re-election. She was indeed re-elected for a third term on the first ballot!\n\nMother Joseph was known for her “enthusiasm for all things Dominican” and strived to be a dedicated daughter of the church.\n\nIn 1927, Mother Joseph sought permission to erect a junior college in Caldwell, however, the request was denied as the Bishop felt the need for a woman’s college was already met by the College of Saint Elizabeth at Convent Station. Mother Joseph never abandoned her dream of a college. On June 21, 1939, the Bishop announced that a college for women would be opened in Caldwell by September. Mother Joseph and her Council had done the impossible. They had created the College amidst the Great Depression and war. The college officially opened on September 22, 1939, as Caldwell College for Women, with thirty-four students. By 1947, the college’s enrollment had increased to 170. Just as it is now, the faculty and student body were a close-knit community. The spirit of the family was nurtured by the creation and fostering of many Dominican traditions.\n\nAfter the blessing of the cornerstone for Raymond Hall, the Honorable Alexander P. Waugh a lifetime resident of Caldwell and dear friend to the sisters, spoke of the sisters and Mother Joseph, “Dominicans were not standing still. Great things were happening…Mother Joseph’s name was legendary in the Caldwell Community. She knew what Almighty God wanted her to achieve – and she knew how to obtain material to achieve those objectives. That quiet, able nun on the hill was a mental match for anyone in the Community.”\n\nAt the age of 71 Mother Joseph Dunn passed away on Good Friday, March 30, 1956. As the foundress of Caldwell University, she has left behind a seventy-six year long legacy of carrying and passing on the torch of truth through education and the zeal for the Church, marked with the Dominican spirit."
