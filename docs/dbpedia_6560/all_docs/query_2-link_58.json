        "text": "(jazz music)\n\n(applause)\n\nGood evening, and welcome to The New Yorker Festival.\n\nThis being one of the events to kick off the weekend.\n\nMy name is Bill Buford,\n\nI am a staff writer with The New Yorker,\n\nformerly a fiction editor at the magazine,\n\nand it is my great pleasure this evening\n\nto introduce two very special writers,\n\nand two writers very special to my heart,\n\nIan Buruma and Martin Amis,\n\nand we will be addressing the subject\n\nof the monster in writing\n\nand how the writer responds to the monster.\n\nPolitical, psychological, just downright ugly.\n\nJoseph Brodsky,\n\none of our greatest poets of forever,\n\nand a Russian immigration resident,\n\nnot far from here, in fact.\n\nAnd writing about Russian fiction, at one point,\n\nsaid that this was Russian fiction under communism,\n\nand Russian fiction under Stalin, and then\n\nRussian fiction under these sort of great\n\neras of repression.\n\nA lot of Russian fiction really isn't fiction.\n\nIt's not really works of the imagination.\n\nIt's works that are determined by these\n\noutside forces, these demons, these monsters,\n\nand as such, they're just\n\nresponses to a kind of political environment.\n\nNevertheless, there is a reason why so much great\n\nRussian literature of the 20th century\n\nwas a response to monsters.\n\nI'm pleased this evening to have\n\ntwo writers who have been enthralled in different ways\n\nby the power and the menace of monsters.\n\nIan Buruma has just finished a book which,\n\nI believe, in fact, started with a New Yorker commission\n\nlooking into the assassination of Theo van Gogh,\n\nor Theo van Gogh,\n\nin a brutal killing.\n\nAnd Martin Amis, perhaps one of our\n\nbest fiction writers in the English language,\n\nis also been obsessed and equally preoccupied with\n\nmonsters from Stalin to Saddam Hussein, to\n\ncertain sort of unnamed demons that occur in his fiction.\n\nIan, let me start with you.\n\nIs this idea of the political monster,\n\nis this idea of any monster, is it really just,\n\nfor a writer, just good copy?\n\nAnd after all, you've got someone who\n\nyou've just spend years investigating,\n\na man who did violent and terrible things.\n\nIs some of the appeal just that he did such\n\nviolent and terrible things?\n\nI don't think it's just because\n\nit's good copy and sensational.\n\nAfter all, somebody who's led an exemplary\n\nlife as a family man has never hurt a fly\n\nis not a very interesting person, perhaps,\n\nto reimagine in fiction.\n\nBut the interesting thing about somebody\n\nlike the killer of Theo van Gogh is\n\nto figure out somebody who actually started off\n\nbeing a perfectly average guy who,\n\nindeed, didn't hurt a fly,\n\nwas thought of as being a rather sort of\n\npillar of his community, a do-gooder,\n\na nice guy, did well at school and so on,\n\nhow he can end up, in a fairly short time,\n\nbeing transformed into somebody who\n\nguns down a man off his bicycle\n\nand then slits his throat\n\nand then uses a knife to pin\n\na pamphlet into his chest\n\nfull of death threats and blood-curdling\n\nreligiose language.\n\nNow what happens?\n\nWhat is it that's transformed this figure?\n\nWhat happened to his personality?\n\nWas there an evil there form the beginning?\n\nIf so, what is it?\n\nIs it in all of us?\n\nIs it a political, or a social, or religious\n\ncircumstances that turn him into this?\n\nI mean, I think that's something that, for\n\nnovelists and writers, non-fiction as well as fiction,\n\nis a fascinating conundrum.\n\nSo in a way, the interest is that\n\nyou're really studying just evil.\n\nMartin, is it\n\nevil that attracts you to,\n\nI mean, is it the study of evil that\n\nmakes something like this a compelling subject?\n\nWell, I think you've got to distinguish between the\n\nbig monsters and the little monsters,\n\nthose with a big stage to act on and those\n\nwith a little one.\n\nThey breed each other.\n\nWhen you look into the big historical monsters,\n\nyou expect, when you open the biography of Stalin,\n\nor Hitler, or Mao, you expect the first sentence\n\nto go, He was raised by crocodiles\n\nin a cesspool in Kuala Lumpur.\n\nAs if this would explain what then followed.\n\nThere's a charming anecdote about Stalin,\n\nwhen the 1936 census appeared in Russia,\n\nit was about 10 or 15 million lower than what Stalin had\n\nimagined it would be, so the\n\nfirst measure he took was to shoot the census board\n\nand reappoint another,\n\nand I can imagine the second census board saying,\n\nLook, if the figure we come up with now is still too low,\n\nthen you'll have to decrease it by\n\nthe present census board, take another\n\n40 people off it.\n\nBut in response to that low census, Stalin\n\ndid all sorts of,\n\nhe reversed the progressivist agenda in Russia,\n\nthe Leninist agenda.\n\nHe re-criminalized abortion,\n\nhe legalized inheritance,\n\nhe complicated and prolonged the divorce process,\n\nmass kindergartenization, et cetera.\n\nAnd another thing he did to try and get\n\nRussians reproducing again, because they had stopped,\n\nit was like it was a genetic strike,\n\nhe went out to see his mother\n\nfor the first time in many years,\n\nand she lived in the huge palace\n\nin Georgia,\n\nwhere she occupied one room out of\n\n140, 'cause she didn't want to be in the way or anything.\n\nAnd he went down,\n\nshe said, What are you now?\n\nAnd he said, Do you remember the Tsar?\n\nAnd she said, Yes.\n\nAnd he said, Well, I'm like that.\n\nThen he said, Mother, why did you beat me\n\nso much when I was a child?\n\nAnd she said, Well,\n\nyou know, we were quite right to do it.\n\nThat's why you've turned out so well. She said.\n\nA modern example of trying to find\n\na logic in the childhood is\n\nHannibal Lecter.\n\nNow when\n\nHannibal Lecter was a good and credible figure\n\nand Thomas Harris was a good writer\n\nbefore he got ruined by all those huge meals he ate,\n\nthere's a quite striking line in The Silence of the Lambs\n\nwhere he says to Clarice, Starling,\n\nnothing made me happen, I happened. He said.\n\nQuite bracing line.\n\nBut later on, when the whole character went decadent\n\nand the writer went decadent\n\nand Thomas Harris went sort of gay for Hannibal,\n\nand he becomes, ridiculously and alarmingly,\n\nhe becomes the hero of the later books.\n\nA murdering bastard who bites people's faces off\n\nis suddenly, there's an attempt\n\nto make him morally intelligible,\n\nand it goes like this, in Lithuania\n\nor wherever the hell it was, where\n\nHannibal's parents, who are both ninth-century\n\npatricians, in their castle,\n\nthe Germans came in and Hannibal\n\nlooked up and, suddenly, Nazis,\n\nthere was a famine at the time,\n\nNazis were eating his sister.\n\nNow that will cut you a lot of slack.\n\nSo, the explanation is given.\n\nBut, in fact,\n\nHitler, Stalin, Mao,\n\nthey all had the brother, they all had the sister,\n\nthey all had the unreliable mother,\n\nyou know, the dodgy dad and all that, but\n\nnothing very unusual,\n\nnothing out of the way.\n\nIt's something else, it's the will to power\n\nthat turns out to be what is really unusual.\n\nThe big Stalins, the big monsters\n\nhave this huge stage to be monsters in,\n\nbut they create little monsters who,\n\nthe Freudian explanation for this is priority magic,\n\nthat once the big figure, like Osama Bin Laden,\n\nhas done something atrocious, then all the followers\n\nfeel the priority magic, feel that the ground\n\nhas been cleared for\n\nmoral nullity, and that's where you get a flood\n\nof the little monsters,\n\nwho could be just as terrible in their way.\n\nHitler was a bit of a bore, really.\n\nI mean, which may be--\n\nBore? He was a bit of a bore,\n\nwhich is why, maybe one reason why\n\nhe hasn't often been,\n\nalmost never been an interesting character in fiction.\n\nI think Stalin is easier to fictionalize\n\nbecause he was actually a much more interesting character.\n\nHe had a kind of devilish intelligence.\n\nHe was a real sadist.\n\nI mean, he enjoyed inflicting pain.\n\nNot, he had no appetite for what they call the wet stuff.\n\nNo, he didn't like pulling fingernails.\n\nThe wet stuff, he didn't do, but he\n\nliked to hear all the details and\n\ninflicting humiliation and that kind of thing.\n\nSo there was a kind of real satisfaction there.\n\nAlso, he started off as a sort of petty gangster.\n\nI mean, he did do the wet stuff in his youth\n\nas far as I know.\n\nI thought there was a sort of--\n\nWith the bank jobs.\n\nYeah, there was a little bit of that.\n\nWhereas Hitler was more the kind of fanatic who,\n\nas you say, sort of\n\nmade other people do all kinds of extraordinary things,\n\nbut himself was actually a very boring,\n\nbanal character.\n\nAnd Mao is more like Stalin, probably.\n\nBut there is a reason why the people in the grand stage\n\nhave made less satisfactory fictional characters\n\nthan the smaller monsters, I would say.\n\nYeah, because they pass into a different phase\n\nof inscrutability.\n\nI mean, Hitler was probably of the type of\n\nthe artist manque.\n\nAs was Mao, yeah.\n\nThose of you who've read Nabokov will realize that\n\nthe artiste manque is a very dangerous type.\n\nHumbert Humbert\n\nidentifies himself as\n\nof that type.\n\nAnd there are people who, and perhaps we've all come across\n\nthem in our lives, there are people who\n\nactually are talented.\n\nIf only Hitler had been a bit more talented,\n\nhis suicide would have happened in some tasteless\n\napartment in Berlin in 1929\n\nand not in the bunker in 1945.\n\nBut the artiste manque\n\nis someone who has a lot of ingenuity\n\nthat should be working itself out in art,\n\nbut they bring those artistic nastinesses,\n\ndevilish aptitudes to play in real life.\n\nThe one I'd like to get my hands on,\n\nif I had grown up in Saudi Arabia, is Osama Bin Laden.\n\nAnd not that inexplicable\n\nentity in that\n\nsometimes we think it's all down to birth order.\n\nHe's 17th out of 57.\n\nWe know what a bitch that can be.\n\nNotoriously difficult slot.\n\nAnd when your dad is an illiterate billionaire,\n\ncertain sort of nastiness among the older brothers\n\nis only to be expected.\n\nThe dad, by the way, was a sort of amazing\n\nsex machine.\n\nHe was.\n\nHe had the four, he had the standing four wives\n\nthat you're allowed,\n\nand then completely churning multitude of mistresses.\n\nWhen it's piously said that you're allowed four wives\n\nas the prophet was, the ease of divorce\n\nin the Muslim world, where\n\nit's true in Leninist Russia,\n\nto get divorced, all you have to say was,\n\nI divorce you.\n\nAnd had to put it on a postcard,\n\nand then that was that.\n\nIn Islam, you have to go through the much more\n\nrigamarole of saying it three times.\n\nI divorce thee, I divorce thee, I divorce thee.\n\nAnyway, Osama's dad did a lot of saying that.\n\nIn fact, his whole life might have been just\n\na repeated tape, saying, I divorce thee, I divorce thee.\n\nBut the interesting thing about Osama,\n\nhe's a self-created monster in that\n\nif you look at his statements in the late 1980s, early 1990s\n\nabout America, he says, America must be opposed.\n\nWhenever you meet an American,\n\nyou should make your grievances known\n\nand you should write to American embassies.\n\nWrite to American embassies?\n\nIn 10 years time, he was blowing up American embassies\n\nin North Africa.\n\nHe radicalized himself,\n\nhe took on the doctrine of Takfir,\n\nwhere we'll talk about that perhaps in a minute,\n\nwhere you can kill absolutely anyone you like\n\nas a sort of PR move.\n\nAnd he wasn't like his number two, Ayman al-Zawahiri,\n\nhe wasn't rewired by events, by torture,\n\nand there's a vigorous,\n\nviable theory that\n\ninternational terrorism was created\n\nin the prisons of the Middle East,\n\nparticularly the prisons of Cairo.\n\nIf you've been tortured,\n\nthen you can imagine, you know,\n\nwhat follows from that is...\n\nYou'd be pretty irritated.\n\nYou would, it's all very understandable\n\nthat it's as if your whole moral network is reordered.\n\nAnd of all the people who connected with Osama,\n\nof all the Taliban leadership, for instance,\n\nthe most damaged people on earth,\n\nsuccession of one-eyed mullahs, tin-legged\n\nand peg-legged zealots.\n\nI mean, Osama, who I think has very low IQ, and it's\n\nquite well-attested, did at least have the wit\n\nto stay in one piece.\n\nI mean, nothing ever happened to Osama,\n\nbut he created himself as a monster\n\nbecause he thought this is what would play.\n\nAnd he's never been anything other than a kind of\n\nPR creation.\n\nI'm getting a theme, Martin,\n\nthat they almost regard a lot of these people as\n\nderiving a kind of artistic satisfaction\n\nin being able to play out, on a real stage,\n\nthings that people don't do,\n\nthere's a kind of almost an artistic self-drama.\n\nI mean, I think we should be looking at\n\nIslamism in the light of\n\nthe death cults we know most about, which are\n\nNazism and Bolshevism.\n\nBy death cult, I mean the drastic\n\ndemotion of the value of human life.\n\nThat's the first step.\n\nTrotsky said, The sanctity of human life\n\nis Papist-Quaker babble\n\nthat we must refute.\n\nThe idea that destruction is creative,\n\nextraordinary notion, but very revolutionary notion.\n\nSo you have\n\nall the minor elements of\n\nself-pity and romanticism,\n\nmorbid adolescent rebelliousness combined.\n\nI think much-neglected theme in terrorism is\n\nthe childish pleasure of smashing things up.\n\nYou remember what it was like,\n\nwhen you were in a half-abandoned house,\n\nyou throw, smash all the windows.\n\nA raw pleasure.\n\nWe have one at home with the babysitter tonight.\n\nAll these traits,\n\nthe invocation of the very old and the very new,\n\nanti-Semitism, always.\n\nYou have all these minor traits, and then you have\n\nthe really radical ones, which are the rejection of reason,\n\ntremendously empowering when you reject reason.\n\nStalin, Hitler, and Lenin could never let the word, reason,\n\ngo by in an essay or a speech without\n\nputting some shitty adjective in front of it,\n\nlike cowardly, or miserable, or abject.\n\nIf you reject reason, then,\n\nfor a little while, everything's possible.\n\nYou're in another dimension, another universe.\n\nAnd the revolt against reason is often\n\nsaid to be because science had revealed itself as being\n\nso creepy at the turn of the century, with\n\nFreud and Einstein telling us that\n\nthe universe was irrational,\n\nand Freud telling us that the human psyche was irrational.\n\nThere was a revolt against reason.\n\nBut when you revolt against reason, you also revolt\n\nagainst moral law, which is based on reason.\n\nAnd then everything is allowed.\n\nAnd it's very empowering for a bit.\n\nIt gives the death cult its\n\nmomentum, its escape velocity.\n\nThen it's off,\n\nit's around, it's launched.\n\nAnd then, very soon...\n\nOne of the Taliban's slogans is,\n\nThrow reason to the dogs.\n\nThey chant that.\n\nI saw a marvelous bit of footage of\n\na Taliban warrior who had his leg up on a pile of corpses,\n\nhad one eye here, one eye there,\n\nevery other tooth missing, and he said,\n\nNow that we've done some of our work,\n\ncreating corpses, scattering some corpses around,\n\nperhaps they'll respect us.\n\nThe rejection of reason, rejection of moral law\n\ngets the whole thing going.\n\nExcept in the 20th century\n\nbecause of modern history,\n\ncommunists, in particular,\n\ndid want to give their most irrational actions\n\nthe veneer of science,\n\nwhich complicates it a little bit.\n\nI mean, it explains, Lysenkoism, for example,\n\nand the same was true, of course,\n\nof the Nazis under Hitler,\n\nthat science based on reason was denounced as Jewish science\n\nquite literally, Jewish science.\n\nAnd the critics of arts and so on\n\nwere also often denouncers,\n\nThat's Jewish stuff.\n\nBut the kind of science espoused by Stalin,\n\nwho took this complete hack called Lysenko,\n\nwho had total crackpot theories about how to\n\nforge a new kind of agriculture out of sort of\n\nsheer human will and experiment, and\n\ntrying to grow different crops together\n\nwhich could never grow, but with the proper, the will,\n\nthey would, and so on,\n\nwas to give a kind of scientific\n\nsurface, or justification, for things which, of course,\n\nwere utterly unscientific and utterly unreasonable.\n\nBut they did still felt the need to do this.\n\nAnd Mao went one step further.\n\nHe, in his Great Leap Forward,\n\ntook Lysenkoism and took a look at what had happened\n\nunder Stalin, and, of course, these Lysenkoist experiments,\n\nthese crackpot theories had led to\n\ntremendous famines in the Soviet Union,\n\nthe Ukraine in particular, which\n\ncost the lives of millions.\n\nAnd Mao said, Well, they made one mistake,\n\nthey weren't radical enough.\n\nAnd so under his A Great Leap Forward, again, he denounced\n\nreal scientists who had had scientific training\n\nin agriculture and industry and so on,\n\ndidn't call them Jewish, because that didn't make a lot\n\nof sense in China, but\n\ndid denounce them as sort of Bourgeois,\n\nwhich was his way of saying Jewish,\n\nand invented this sort of more radical form of Lysenkoism\n\nin agriculture, growing crops in Tibet, which\n\nwere impossible to grow and so on,\n\nand people who would tell him that were then,\n\nof course, denounced as Bourgeois saboteurs\n\nof real communism and so on.\n\nAnd again, led to,\n\nat a very conservative estimate, 30 million dead,\n\nbut in the name of a new kind of science.\n\nTruth in Lysenko, who got five Orders of Lenin\n\nunder Stalin.\n\nThe idea is that if you become\n\nso fanatically radical that you can\n\nturn everything around.\n\nBut the famine in Russia was a terror famine, wasn't it?\n\nYeah, it was more deliberate.\n\nIt was designed to crush. Peasantry.\n\nIan, you're studying the van Gogh killing.\n\nI mean, that was kind of a case study of a person who...\n\nI mean, what happened there?\n\nThat seemed like somebody who was abandoning reason\n\nfor something else.\n\nI mean, there was a kind of a liberating moment when\n\nperfectly-civilized conventional approaches\n\nto human conduct were abandoned in place of...\n\nHow did that happen?\n\nThat seemed like that was the thing that was attracting you\n\nto what happened.\n\nWell, I think one way not to try and explain it is to\n\ndelve deeply into Islamic thought or Muslim philosophy,\n\nor even Islamism, political Islam,\n\nbecause I think you find the kind of character\n\nthat Mohammed Bouyeri was,\n\nyou find him in the pages of Conrad novels,\n\nor Dostoyevsky, or indeed amongst the\n\nRed Army faction, the extreme\n\nrevolutionary movements of the 1970s in Europe.\n\nYou also find him on any university campus.\n\nIt's not for nothing that religious cults\n\nand extreme proselytizers for extreme political movements\n\nfind campuses very fertile ground for recruits.\n\nIt's when people are at a vulnerable age.\n\nThey have a shaky idea of who they are,\n\nwhat they're supposed to be doing in life and so on,\n\nand are very susceptible to people who come along\n\nwith a plausible story of how\n\nto give them the meaning of their existence, a cause,\n\nsomething to even die for,\n\nwhether it's religious or political.\n\nThe people who are most vulnerable to this\n\nare often people who feel humiliated,\n\nwho have a grievance,\n\nwho feel that they've been let down by the world,\n\ncould have a sexual background.\n\nThere are all kinds of reasons why people are like that.\n\nNow I think Mohammed Bouyeri\n\nwas such a figure.\n\nI mean, he grew up being relatively well-educated,\n\nquite intelligent, not brilliant, I shouldn't have thought.\n\nSecond-generation immigrant.\n\nHis father was\n\nfrom a village in Morocco,\n\nand these people almost never become radical.\n\nI mean, they're much too busy working in factories.\n\nThey're not particularly religious.\n\nIslam, to them, are the village customs and so on.\n\nIt's the next generation who are in betwixt, in between,\n\nwho feel that they're out of touch\n\nand that they have nothing much in common anymore\n\nwith the village society of their parents,\n\nnor do they feel totally accepted by the country\n\nin which they were born and bred,\n\nand if they're young men with a lot of testosterone\n\nand a lot of uncertainty, they're very easily bruised,\n\neasily humiliated, and anything can trigger them,\n\nand it could be the rejection.\n\nFor example, in the case of Muslims,\n\nand I think this happened with him, too,\n\nthey have this strong idea, the second generation,\n\nnot, when I say they, not all of them, but some of them\n\nhave this strong idea that, basically,\n\nall western women are easy lays.\n\nThey're whores, really,\n\nunlike their sisters, who have to be kept\n\nfirmly under control.\n\nWhen they treat a western woman like a whore,\n\noften, not always,\n\noften, they'll be rejected,\n\nand this then\n\ncauses a sense of humiliation which can only be justified\n\nby saying, They're doing it because\n\nI'm a foreigner, I'm a Muslim,\n\nI'm being discriminated, and so on.\n\nThat can lead to a kind of rage\n\nthat triggers violence.\n\nBut Ian, don't you think that\n\nit is important that it's Islam?\n\nI mean, that you have-- I think it's incidental.\n\nNo, I don't agree.\n\nYou have 60 generations of\n\nsuppression of women.\n\nThe theme of the tempter is tremendously important in Islam.\n\nSayyid Qutb, this,\n\nagain, like in Nabokov, narrator, one of these\n\nhigh-minded, snooty guys\n\nwho's always proclaiming his purity\n\nwhile disclosing, interalia, impenetrable murk.\n\nHe came to America at the end of the 40s and\n\nhad a little episode in New York, then Washington,\n\nthen went to the hell house of Greeley, Colorado,\n\nand where he formulated modern Islamism,\n\namazing story, a ridiculous story.\n\nMany incidents along the way, like\n\nhe claimed he got almost raped\n\nby a drunken American woman\n\non the boat from Alexandria to New York.\n\nI mean, no one knows what really happened, but\n\napparently, she was battering on his cabin door\n\nand he was barricading himself in.\n\nThen he gets, in Washington,\n\nhe was hospitalized with lung trouble,\n\nand he said that the nurse, with her thirsty lips,\n\nher bulging breasts, her swelling rump,\n\nin Colorado, a woman assails him with the notion that,\n\nthis was 1949, early feminism, that sex is just a\n\nphysical process, nothing to do with morality.\n\nFrom this, he formulated the theory that Americans were\n\nunworthy of life, arrogant animals who\n\nwould have to be eliminated.\n\nThe last line in the Quran\n\nis a reference to the devil, where\n\nthe devil is portrayed as the insidious tempter,\n\nwhispering in the minds of men.\n\nAnd it turns out, in developed Islamism, in\n\nthe political thought of this movement,\n\nthat that's what we've all been doing\n\nfor the last couple of hundred years,\n\nthough we didn't know it, was creating a society\n\nfor the tantalization of good Muslims.\n\nThey look at our society and they feel tempted by it.\n\nAnd this terrifies them,\n\nthat sensuality of women,\n\nI think, is very close to the heart of all this.\n\nThe thing they can't bear about modernity is\n\nthe equality of women.\n\nBut I'm a bit skeptical about this\n\nground of cultural theories.\n\nYes, in the case of Mohammed Bouyeri,\n\nto say it has nothing to do with Islam would be absurd\n\nbecause it's done in the name of Islam,\n\nthere are traditions, as you say,\n\nbut it's a bit like the from Luther to Hitler theories\n\nabout what explains the violence in Germany\n\nin the 1930s and 40s.\n\nYou can find, if you read Heinrich Heine,\n\nabout German romantic philosophy,\n\nyou can find plenty of things in the German tradition\n\nof romanticism and so on\n\nthat are harbingers of the\n\nviolent radicalism of Nazism.\n\nBut to say that somehow the real answer\n\nto the way that Nazis behaved or Germans behaved\n\nin the 30s and 40s somehow can be found buried\n\nin some deep German tradition,\n\nI would be suspicious of, just as you could say\n\nin the case of the Japanese with kamikaze\n\nand violent behavior of Japanese troops in China and so on,\n\nthis is often explained, Ah, well, the samurai tradition\n\nand the warrior tradition, and it's all there.\n\nIf you look at Japanese history, you can find it.\n\nNo doubt, in the case of Serbs, there are all kinds\n\nof things that you could find in Serbian history\n\nthat explain it, but I think almost any history,\n\nand almost any religion, and almost any culture\n\nwill contain seeds that, in certain circumstances,\n\ncan be perverted into justifications of extreme violence.\n\nThat's the only reason why I say\n\nto try and find the key to the behavior\n\nof somebody like Mohammed Bouyeri\n\nin the Muslim tradition is a little bit of a red herring.\n\nWho is the killer of van Gogh.\n\nWe haven't introduced him,\n\nbut he was the killer of van Gogh?\n\nMohammed Bouyeri, yeah.\n\nThat's his name.\n\nStill, it's very striking and concerted,\n\nthe hatred of women\n\nin this perversion of Islam.\n\nWell, I mean, the Quran says,\n\nIf you suspect your wife of disobedience, suspect,\n\nthen keep her in beds apart and beat her,\n\nand if she relents, take no further action against her.\n\nThe Taliban, these village idiot vigilantes,\n\nnot only, when they took power in 1996,\n\nwhen they took Kabul,\n\nthey not only, at a stroke, dismantled the whole\n\neducational and medical services of the country\n\nby banning women from working, they decreed\n\nthat they should never leave the house,\n\nand they decreed further that windows\n\nof their houses should be blacked over\n\nso that not even the light of day should penetrate\n\ninto their lives.\n\nThe Taliban, the young warriors of the Taliban\n\nare young men who have never really\n\nhad any contact with women.\n\nThey've lived through those years of civil war.\n\nThey're a brotherhood.\n\nThat's the Muslim brotherhood.\n\nAt these camps in Afghanistan and Waziristan,\n\nPakistani border, it's suicide bombing in the morning, it's\n\nRPGs and IEDs in the afternoon,\n\nand in the evening, it's hating women.\n\nIt's very striking.\n\nI mean, there's no disagreement about the Taliban,\n\nobviously, and I agree that the hatred of women\n\nand extreme puritanism of one kind another\n\nclose to this kind of monstrosity.\n\nWhat interests me more is not what,\n\nsort of as you put it, I mean,\n\nvillage of vigilantes?\n\nWhat did you say? Village idiot.\n\nThat village idiots turn out that way.\n\nWhat is more interesting is how people,\n\nin a very civilized country, modern country like Germany,\n\ncould turn out into something similar.\n\nAnd, for example, if you look at the SA men,\n\nthe stormtroopers in the 1930s,\n\nthey also had this very strong sense that\n\nmale camaraderie, male bonding was\n\nthe only honorable way to live,\n\nthat women were sort of disgusting and so on,\n\nthat violence was a purer way to act,\n\nand there were quite overt\n\nhomosexual overtones in this, too,\n\nbut the tradition of this kind of\n\nmen bonding together to act violently,\n\nyou find in all cultures\n\nthroughout history.\n\nNow what is it that brings people who live in a society\n\nthat's much more highly-evolved and complex\n\nand has far more freedoms than Afghanistan,\n\nespecially in times of crisis,\n\nwhat drives those sort of people\n\nto do these things?\n\nWhich I think\n\nis more interesting and it gets one,\n\nI think, closer to, perhaps, something that is\n\nin all human beings and that cannot simply be explained\n\nby finding the key in one specific tradition\n\nrather than in another.\n\nYes, but the availability of the warrant\n\nis very important.\n\nThat is true, that is why\n\nyou find this thing amongst young Muslim immigrants\n\nin Europe more readily than say under young Hindu\n\nimmigrants, because\n\nthe ready-made cause is there.\n\nIf you're looking for a violent revolutionary cause\n\nto die for, Islamism is there,\n\nwhich is not available to immigrants\n\nor young people from the different traditions.\n\nThat is absolutely correct, I would agree.\n\nAnd perhaps the common theme,\n\nalthough this doesn't quite explain\n\nRussia, but humiliation seems to be...\n\nMartin, to amplify sort of Ian's point.\n\nYou used the phrase earlier,\n\nmoral nullity, that\n\nto characterize the behavior of the little monsters.\n\nIf a big monster has the swagger and charisma\n\nand whatever it takes to change the rules completely,\n\nit seems to have the effect of\n\nliberating these little monsters, like the SS men,\n\nwhich opens up the\n\nfrightening or interesting possibility, at least,\n\nthat there is a kind of...\n\nThat this kind of violence, this kind of\n\nmonstrous ugliness is a very natural expression.\n\nIt's just waiting for the chance to be set free.\n\nI think that's evident, that\n\ngiven total power,\n\nan individual given total power over another individual,\n\nhis thoughts will soon turn to torture.\n\nThat seems to be the equation.\n\nAnd that interests you?\n\nWell, I mean, it's so black\n\nand it's so, I think it is universal,\n\nthat you'd need a good excuse to go in there.\n\nThe appeal of righteous violence\n\nseems to be absolutely limitless to human beings.\n\nThe idea that you can behave like a barbarian\n\nand still be right,\n\nright for that reason.\n\nI mean, Takfir,\n\nas I understand it in Lawrence Wright's book,\n\nThe Looming Tower, he says that Takfir,\n\nwhich is the doctrine taken up,\n\nparticularly, I think, by Ayman al-Zawahiri,\n\nit's an area, it's been present in Islam all along,\n\nbut it's one that is treated, until recently,\n\nvery warily, this is the idea\n\nthat you take upon yourself that area of moral judgment\n\nthat is usually being reserved for the damned,\n\nwhere it is you and not God\n\nwho decides who can be\n\neliminated, who is unclean, who is a hypocrite,\n\nwho is apostate, who are the\n\nvarious categories of those who could be killed.\n\nI mean, this was Bouyeri.\n\nAbsolutely.\n\nIt's a tremendous liberation into nihilism\n\nwith a warrant.\n\nBut the license to torture or to murder\n\ninfidels, people who you regard as utterly other,\n\nas it were, is, of course, leads\n\nto terrible atrocities.\n\nBut another interesting aspect of this is that\n\nsometimes the worst atrocities to do with humiliation\n\nand so on, degradation, take place\n\nbetween people who are actually very similar,\n\nyour neighbors.\n\nYou saw this during partition\n\nbetween India and Pakistan,\n\nwhen, suddenly, Hindus and Muslims who'd lived together\n\nin the same communities for centuries,\n\nwere each other's neighbors, suddenly\n\nfelt not only the license but the necessity\n\nto do each other harm,\n\nand that often leads to extraordinary\n\nforms of atrocity.\n\nAnd one possible explanation for this is that\n\nprecisely because people look the same as you do\n\nand come from the same background, you know them.\n\nBefore you kill them, before you can feel\n\nthat you can kill them with moral impunity,\n\nyou have to humiliate them and degrade them\n\nto the extent that they become nothing more than animals.\n\nAnd when they start behaving like animals, abjectly\n\nscreaming in fear, and whimpering, and writhing, and so on,\n\nthen you feel that you're killing\n\nsomebody who is unworthy, who is filthy, an animal,\n\nsomeone rather than a human being like yourself,\n\nand the necessity to do that, for that kind of degradation,\n\nI think, might actually be at its highest\n\nwhen people are just like you\n\nand not some strange alien.\n\nIan.\n\nYour observation there leads to\n\na question that I wanted to ask, which was,\n\nwhat do you understand about human behavior after this,\n\nstudying this murder so intensely\n\nthat you didn't have before?\n\nApart from the fact that it's a barrel of laughs?\n\nYeah, it sounds, yeah, it's like a lot of jokes.\n\nWell, I suppose because we're all frightened of it.\n\nBecause I agree with Martin.\n\nAnd what is it that we're frightened of?\n\nI mean, we're not frightened, necessarily.\n\nWell, we're frightened of violence, per se, of course,\n\nI mean, of being the victim of it.\n\nBut more frightening, I think, is that\n\nsomewhere deep down, it is in all of us,\n\nwhich is not to say, to make the sort of cheap\n\nobservation that we can all be torturers tomorrow,\n\nalthough I think, to some extent, that is actually true.\n\nI totally agree with Martin.\n\nI think if one person is given total power over another,\n\nit almost invariably will lead to some kind of abuse\n\nif not directly to torture and murder,\n\nbut certainly to abuse.\n\nAnd I think anybody who has any self-awareness\n\nknows that they are not\n\nentirely immune to this.\n\nAnd so to come to grips,\n\nthere are two ways of dealing with things\n\nthat one is frightened of.\n\nOne is to look away,\n\nto want to have nothing to do with it,\n\nnot to think about it,\n\nonly go to films that make you laugh.\n\nPretend that it's not there.\n\nIf you're frightened of snakes,\n\neither you don't want to look at it at all\n\nor you're riveted by it.\n\nOr you could just live at a place where\n\nthere are no snakes.\n\nI'm sorry?\n\nYou can just live in a place where there are no snakes.\n\nThere is no such place in the case\n\nof the potential for violence.\n\nDoesn't Ireland have no snakes?\n\nIreland may not have any snakes,\n\nbut I mean, in terms of the potential for violence,\n\nthis is everywhere.\n\nIt's in us, it's everywhere.\n\nSo because it's frightening,\n\nin my case, I'm fascinated by it,\n\nI want to know more about it,\n\nI want to understand it better,\n\nI want to know why people do these things and so on.\n\nAnd, of course, there is the terrible,\n\nthe pornographic temptation, too.\n\nI mean, we don't all read books about the Holocaust\n\nfor entirely high-minded reasons.\n\nIt's something to be aware of.\n\nPornography of depicted violence.\n\nYes.\n\nMartin, what happened?\n\nYou were this writer who was writing about West London\n\nand like fat people and bad tennis players, and\n\nscumbags who came over to New York and sort of\n\nmade a mess of it,\n\nand now it's Stalin and Lenin and camps and Osama.\n\nWhy have you got attracted to these figures?\n\nI don't know, good question.\n\nI mean, you've been thinking\n\nimpressively long and hard about them.\n\nWas it related to like\n\nsort of rediscovering Robert Conquest?\n\nRobert Conquest, the great historian, The Great Terror.\n\nNo, it was more,\n\nI think it began with...\n\nI think it began with,\n\nschmaltzy answer,\n\nbut it began with becoming a father\n\nand then thinking that\n\nmuch follows from this and that, suddenly,\n\nthe future of the planet, which had been of no interest\n\nto me, whatever, until then,\n\ndid become emplaced,\n\nand then all these sort of pain-in-the-ass subjects,\n\nlike global warming.\n\nThe continuity of the planet became important to me.\n\nNot overnight.\n\nI do remember that you sort of discovered that\n\nthe world had nuclear bombs right after your first child.\n\nYeah.\n\nThat suddenly became very important to me.\n\nThen I think I wrote the book about Stalin\n\njust to give myself a political education.\n\nThen September the 11th happened,\n\nand, suddenly, politics filled the sky.\n\nMy subject.\n\nGeopolitics has not been my subject, but\n\nmasculinity always has been,\n\nand have we ever seen the male animal\n\nin such a weird outfit as\n\nthe robes, camouflage outfits, suit and tie,\n\ngym shoes, trainers of the Islamist\n\nsuicide bomber?\n\nThe Islamist putting himself about,\n\nthat great orange hulk at Glasgow Airport\n\nlooking for somebody to smash himself up against,\n\neven as he's going up in flames.\n\nHave we ever seen masculinity in such a getup?\n\nAnd then the way this relates to women.\n\nI did think this is now\n\na subject that I am prepared,\n\nI've always been prepared for.\n\nOn behalf of The New Yorker, I'd like to thank\n\nIan and Martin.\n\n(applause)\n\n(jazz music)"
