        "text": "The Islamic Republic of Pakistan lies in southern Asia, bordered by India to the east and by Afghanistan and Iran to the west. It has a short frontier with the People’s Republic of China in the far north-east. The climate is dry and generally hot, with an annual average temperature of 27°C (80°F), except in the mountainous areas, which have very cold winters. Temperatures in Karachi are generally between 13°C (55°F) and 34°C (93°F), with negligible rainfall. The principal languages are Punjabi (the language usually spoken in 44.2% of households in 1998), Pushto/Pashtu (15.4%), Sindhi (14.1%) and Saraiki (10.5%). Urdu (7.6%) is the national language, and English is extensively used. The state religion is Islam, embracing more than 96% of the population in 1998, the remainder being mainly Hindus or Christians. The national flag (proportions 2 by 3) has a vertical white stripe at the hoist, while the remainder is dark green, with a white crescent moon and a five-pointed star in the centre. The capital is Islamabad.\n\nCitations:\n\nCountry Flag (Pakistan), in Europa World online. London, Routledge. University of Tennessee, Knoxville.

K2's elevation reaches 28,251 feet or 8,611 meters. This mountain belongs to the Karakoram Mountain Range. The name K2 comes from British surveyors who explored the mountain range, making note of the highest peaks as K1, K2, etc. The first successful ascent was completed by an Italian team led by Ardito Desio in 1954. K2 is considered one of the most difficult climbs in the world due to frequent storms and treacherous slopes."
