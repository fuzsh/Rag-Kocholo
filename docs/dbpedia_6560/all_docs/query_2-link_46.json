        "text": "https://www.dukeupress.edu/atmospheric-noise\n\nDrew Kerr: Atmospheric Noise highlights multiple sensory modes involved with negotiating airport noise. On first brush, the sonic obviously invokes hearing or listening, but the shaking of walls, rattling of glass, the pressurized movement of concrete infrastructure as an aircraft passes overhead in its flight path also make hearing something perceptibly haptic and tactile. You guide us, “[p]roprioception and thermoception are coterminous with hearing: the former a state in the inner ear, the latter a sensation produced by low frequencies.” (120). Then inscribing that noise through measurement in renderings of graphic data and noise contour maps, as well as legal files and written complaints present a material visuality to hearing. Can you talk more about this movement of energy, as you frame it, and how it came into focus for you as the atmospheric, as opposed to the legal-discursive or the activist-political, for example?\n\nMarina Peterson: There’s a lot in this question! Several strands of thought come to bear on these issues. First, I was (and am) invested in finding ways to de-objectify sound – to treat sound as immanent and processual rather than an artifact, whether in the form of a recording or a notion of soundscape that sustains a modern distinction between sound and hearing. Approaching sound as energy helps with this. In Ohio, we had a project “Energy Soundscapes” that involved listening to sounds of energy past and present, while also exploring what it means to treat sound as energy, as an immaterial form or force that is always in motion. Some of the projects can be seen/listened to here. Brian Harnetty was part of this group, and has continued to engage with the region through listening engagements. Treating listening as coterminous with other senses, especially ones like thermoception or proprioception, destabilizes a subject/object divide expressed in the differentiation between hearing and sound. With Thermoception and proprioception, there is no difference between the thing sensed and sensing.\n\nOn the other hand, I was also captivated by the materialist turn, reading Jane Bennett and others, and considering what it means to write with and through forms of matter. I experimented with this, writing about the landscape of southeast Ohio and the invisible yet palpable presence of a history of coal mining that left hills cloaking their emptiness, which became apparent as sinkholes or acid mine drainage.\n\nI went to Los Angeles with a project on infrastructure that connected the city to the ocean, and was in the archive (at the Huntington Library) looking at material on building storm drains and channeling the LA River. Concrete, though a fascinating material form that shifts from viscosity to solidity with the aid of water, was nonetheless hard to get to move, especially in its hardened form. I found files on airport noise and thought they might be useful for teaching (I was wary of doing a sound project, in part because of my reservations about reifying sound). The first files I read were letters from residents around LAX to County Supervisor Kenneth Hahn, appealing to him to do something about the noise. He took their complaints to Washington, finding that airspace jurisdiction was an unsettled domain. This was the hook for me: noise activating air (through airspace law), both coming into being in a dynamic relationality on the move. Air came into focus as a material form that pushed back on new materialisms insofar in its immateriality. Now there is a lot of work on air and atmosphere, but at the time (2013-14) there wasn’t much, so it felt like an exciting area of investigation. Atmosphere came after air, which explains my emphasis on the aerial rather than the affective. However, what I was also interested in was a logic of air or the atmospheric – as something immaterial that is also indeterminate or difficult to pin down. Atmospheric became an expansive way of describing how noise moves and works on and with air, buildings, bodies, and the city. My approach remains rooted in the ethnographic, especially in the fact that airport noise is for the most part curtailed to airborne sound within the range of human audibility.\n\nDrew Kerr: I originally picked up your book coming with my own questions about affective atmospheres, but in your ethnographic world of sonic atmospheres, I quickly was (productively) redirected toward “acoustic sensation, knowledge, and imagination,” (7) as you quote from Steven Feld’s (1996) work. The interplay of these various elements grappling with the matter of noise around the Los Angeles airport reminded me, perhaps a little afield, of Constatine Nakassis’s (2015) proposition that linguistic anthropology is not the study of “language,” per se, but language’s entanglement with other semiotic modalities, particularly intervening in understanding (or at least unpacking) indexical processes. Though you’re not directly engaging that literature, through the course of the book I was convinced of the opening, the possibilities noise provides as a medium. Can you set the scene of how “acoustic sensation, discourse, technology, law, and urban infrastructure” (7) take shape with/through noise?\n\nMarina Peterson: I tend to return to Lefebvre’s spatial triad to account for the simultaneity of what he calls representations of space, representational space, and spatial practice. Though in Atmospheric Noise I describe noise as “A material-discursive ‘monster,’ a ‘quasi object,’ an ‘unformed object’ or ‘hybrid’” (8), formulations developed especially in STS by scholars such as Donna Haraway, Michelle Murphy and Stefan Helmreich. Katie Stewart describes this as “registers” in her essay “Road Registers.” The list you offer (“acoustic sensation, discourse, technology, law, and urban infrastructure” (7)) are some of the ethnographic domains in which noise emerges as an acoustic object as it were, that is given a designation as noise and made meaningful in ways that exceed it as such. In this way, even as noise is always coming into being, it also becomes a way of knowing (in Feld’s terms) – with knowing at once bodily and epistemological. I wouldn’t call noise a medium, as to me that suggests a stability that it doesn’t have; it’s not background, or something in or through which things are formed, instead, it is always emergent even as it does work.\n\nDrew Kerr: I’m also thinking with the enmeshed relationality between metrics, machines, and bodies — the measuring devices that inscribe sonic signatures, human bodies that perceive sound and its effects, sound as that which touches, and sound that is noise, an annoyance. You suggest at a later moment in the book a “continuity across differently vibrating matter that extends from the skin of the body to that of the house and beyond” (131), which I take to poignantly describe this enmeshment. The continuity strikes me as a dense, yet porous bodily materiality (or perhaps material embodiment?), that acutely draws our attention to conversations about im/mediation. Would you say more about your methodologies to encounter this assemblage and its emergence? And, if I might selfishly extend, how might you anticipate such methods contributing to conversations around mediation (what we might frame under semiotics)?\n\nMarina Peterson: I’m aiming to approach the material in a nonrepresentational way, staying close to the thing itself, which might be the physicality of sound or something like semiotics. I describe this as the “viscerality of abstraction” in Chapter 2, engaging with haptic qualities of graphs and metrics. I don’t want to deny the semiotic work they do, but I approach them in a way akin to Rabinow’s assertion that “representations are social facts.” This is also a way of pushing against an understanding of such forms as mediating, which places them between one thing and another. On the other hand, I don’t want to reify experience, which centers a human subject. That said, methodologically my approach is to read documents for haptic moments, with, as you suggested, a continuity of embodiment across forms of matter, which might be bodies, buildings, sound or air, all of which is emergent and in relation. This kind of discussion comes out strongly in acoustic engineering reports, or the way acoustic engineers talk about their work. It’s what Stengers calls the “meso” – “a site of invention” that “affirms its copresence with a milieu” (https://www.inflexions.org/n3_stengershtml.html). I call this a glitch methodology, insofar as I’m drawing out something from the material – principally an attention to the physicality of sound and atmosphere – that isn’t necessarily the intended or expressed meaning.\n\nDrew Kerr: To turn us in another direction, I’m curious to hear more about attunement. The book draws out a tension between audiovisual technologies that render specific measurements of airport noise into general soundscapes, and the individual subjective and collective experiences of noise. There are aerial attunements by microphones, people’s ears and bodies, while simultaneously there are social attunements between people talking as they’re drowned out by plane noise, new existential and legal attunements of annoyance, and commercial economic attunements by farmers navigating their chickens frightened to death. The murmurs and echoes of noise resonate quite deeply. How does attunement disperse from moments of experiencing noise into a public ear? Or perhaps to ask this differently: Can you help us grasp the scales across which attunement and the atmospheric transect in your writing and the worlds of your interlocutors?\n\nMarina Peterson: Attunement is a minor gesture, a turning toward something, whether sound or heat or person. It is a mode of relationality that is ordinary and usually unremarkable. In my article “Sensory Attunements: Working With the Past in the Little Cities of Black Diamonds” I write that “Attunement is an orienting toward, a feeling-ness that does not necessarily have specific content and is generally nondiscursive.” Heat is an important mode of attunement, felt, and discussed in the way that weather is, just part of the ordinary. But that turning toward another to say “it’s hot” is also a moment of relationality, between people who are also experiencing atmospheric effects of coal mining, the history of that region materialized in present and future climates. I brought this sense of attunement to Atmospheric Noise, paying attention to those minor gestural moments that get registered as experience in congressional hearings, but are doing relational work between family members and neighbors, or between residents around the airport and politicians and ultimately federal legislation. This is also part of the atmospheric quality of aircraft noise, which shifts the interpersonal aspect of noise as nuisance to a more distributed or dispersed – and multiscalar – register. Making claims against aircraft noise shifts from the specific noisemaker to law, metricization, airspace jurisdiction, and so on.\n\nDrew Kerr: A final, striking element of the book is your style of writing. Whether through the present tense, layering narratives and parallel events, your own self-reflections in the ethnography, and a curious experiment with glitching, the writing yields an account richly present and animate. This is a powerful rejoinder to the dilemma of capturing the viscerality and fleeting nature of noise often cited by your interlocutors, the court proceedings, sound engineers, and yourself. Can you recount for us the motivations and arrival to this style of writing, and especially how the idea of glitching formed into its own method for you?\n\nMarina Peterson: Thank you for the kind words. A project of writing through things emerged from my engagement with new materialism, nonrepresentational theory, and the landscape of southeast Ohio. I wanted to really push the idea of writing theory through the world. Katie Stewart does this. Of course, we select ethnographic material that is relevant for a framing. But to make the framing intrinsic to the account of a place or thing or encounter brings another kind of intention and attention. It requires staying close to the thing rather than generalizing or skating across the surface.\n\nGlitching is a way of reading against the grain of intended meanings. It’s partly a way of articulating how my approach to science and engineering differs from much (not all) STS. But it also foregrounds the possibility of reading against the grain of dominant (Eurocentric, modern, and so on) modes of knowledge production more broadly.\n\nhttps://www.degruyter.com/document/doi/10.1515/9781501511561/html?lang=en\n\nElizabeth McHugh: On page 25 you talk about how you came to be involved with this project. Had you known about the language ecology in Mexico before you were invited in? Or was there something you really wanted to look into with this situation as opposed to another linguistic ecology, or situation in another region?\n\nHaley De Korne: I knew that Mexico had passed a law in 2003 granting rights to Indigenous language speakers and recognizing Indigenous languages as national languages alongside Spanish. This puts Mexico well ahead of the US and Canada, for example, in terms of official rights and recognition for Indigenous languages. I’ve always been interested in the impact of top-down policies on the ground, and the interplay of bottom-up efforts under different social conditions. In my previous research on Indigenous language education policies in the US and Canada, many of the problems could be blamed on a lack of top-down rights and recognition. I wanted to examine possibilities and constraints in a context where the top-down recognition is in place.\n\nIn addition to that, the Isthmus of Tehuantepec was also especially interesting to me as a region because there are multiple Indigenous languages spoken there, plus Spanish and now some English, so it’s a truly multilingual language ecology. Zapotec also has a history of literacy that goes back to 600 BCE and in modern times speakers of Isthmus Zapotec have been actively promoting their language and culture in written and visual modalities for well over a century. In other words, this is a language community where there have been, and continue to be, many forms of language activism. So I was drawn to it as an excellent place to research language activism in practice, and Indigenous language learning in a contemporary multilingual context.\n\nElizabeth McHugh: On pages 22-23 you talk about situating yourself as an activist scholar, and especially examining the legacy of exploitative research that activist scholars are attempting to overcome. I wondered if you could touch on that more, in the way that your project and the methodology you chose strayed away from those harmful and exploitative practices of the past?\n\nHaley De Korne: The way in which I work to avoid exploitative research is through collaboration, consultation, and of course reflexivity. With regards to the Isthmus, I first met people who were from there and/ or already working there, and who said that it would be useful to understand more about the kinds of issues that I research, that is the social dynamics of language learning and language reclamation. The methodological framework I have used in this project is ethnographic monitoring, a term first coined by Dell Hymes to refer to the use of ethnography for applied or action research. Ethnographic monitoring essentially combines the ethnography of communication with action research. You begin with participant observation in order to understand contextual dynamics, and the priorities and aspirations of the people in that context to the extent that that’s possible. You stay alert to ways that you might be able to support those priorities and aspirations, and potentially engage in some form of action research to that end with stakeholders or collaborators in that context. In other words, you don’t show up assuming you know what matters to people or what should happen, which action research without ethnography can risk doing. And you don’t just observe and stay disengaged, which ethnography without action research can risk doing. I don’t think it’s possible for researchers to engage in the action research piece in every project or every context, but I think it’s important to stay open to it and to take that step when the opportunity arises.\n\nConsultation or checking in with the people you’re doing research with is also key to understanding if there’s something useful that you can do from your position as a researcher, or not. Sometimes we think we have a great idea about how to do something useful, and the stakeholders or people in the context can point out what we’re missing or what we’ve misunderstood. Sometimes it’s not about what we can do, but what we can support. Trying to use the privilege that we have as researchers to amplify the voices and initiatives of people that we work with can be valuable.\n\nLast but not least, reflecting on our research as social action, and the impact we may be having as social actors is also important in my view. It’s unfortunately all too easy to misunderstand certain dynamics or to have an impact that is not what we intended, and on-going reflection can help to guard against that, even if none of us can ever be sure that we’re avoiding all harm. There is great guidance available from Indigenous scholars for avoiding exploitative research, such as Linda Tuhiwai Smith’s classic Decolonizing methodologies: Research and Indigenous peoples (1999/ 2021). Understanding what researchers from our disciplines have done in the past is also important for making different choices ourselves. There are of course many ways to do engaged or applied research, and I don’t believe that there is one correct approach.\n\nElizabeth McHugh: This is a follow up question to that. How would that work if the project wasn’t something where you were invited but one where you sought it out, or where you have to apply for a grant? How would you suggest going about explaining what the goals are then, if you’re not exactly sure in the beginning where you would be stepping in or how you might be helping to amplify their voices? Would you say the goal is language activism, but it has to start with the community first to see what their needs are, and you expect that something will arise?\n\nHaley De Korne: Yes, that’s exactly what I’d do. I would emphasize the importance of contextualization and stakeholder participation to achieve any kind of meaningful social impact, and argue that initial participant observation fieldwork is necessary to lay the groundwork for that. You can also give examples of the kinds of initiatives you anticipate could emerge or would likely be incorporated into the study. You can establish a timeline about when key decisions would be made, even if all of those concrete details can’t be included in the application.\n\nElizabeth McHugh: You talked about how many people you met during your fieldwork would associate your work with rescuing or saving the language and you say that you avoided describing your work in these terms. How would you describe the difference of what language activism is as opposed to a language maintenance or language revitalization effort?\n\nHaley De Korne: Language maintenance is generally understood as trying to stabilize language transmission between generations and maintain a bilingual (or multilingual) community in a context where one language is under pressure. Language revitalization is usually understood as trying to increase the number of speakers of a language that is already marginalized and perhaps endangered. I define language activism much more broadly, as efforts towards positive social change that relate to language, both through resisting inequalities and through imagining and creating alternative futures. This can mean efforts to support an endangered language, but it can also refer to efforts to encourage inclusive and affirmative language choices within a speech community, efforts to change prejudices towards users of a certain dialect, or initiatives to create a literary culture for a language that has been primarily oral, to give a few examples.\n\nElizabeth McHugh: You mention in this case that there are different types of activism, such as in primary and secondary education, higher education, community-based education, and in popular culture spaces. Would you say that an activist can take on smaller roles at a time and just work in higher education language activism? Do they automatically have to take into account community level activism as well? Furthermore, do activists always have to encompass the three actions you include in your activism strategies framework– creating, representing, and connecting– in their activism?\n\nHaley De Korne: Language activists have to work where they are and within the limits of their positionality. For many of us, we can have more impact and work more effectively in certain spaces. So absolutely, yes, I don’t think activists necessarily have to work across multiple spaces at once, although minoritized language speakers are often pressured to do that, for example through the choices they make in their personal, private communication practices, and through taking on roles as teachers or organizers. It’s useful to consider what our social positionality may make possible for us, and what we cannot or should not do because of who we are.\n\nI do think it’s useful to be aware of the work that is being done in other spaces, to the extent that’s possible, and to explore possible synergies. One of the successful strategies I observed in the Isthmus of Tehuantepec was where teachers invited young hip-hop musicians who are producing bilingual music to perform in their schools. The students loved it and were impressed that the local Indigenous language was being used in such a cool way. In several cases I heard students talking about these experiences long after they happened. Because some of the teachers were aware of what the popular culture activists were doing, and because the hip-hop artists were willing to collaborate, they were able to bring a new energy into the classroom and influence the perception of students more effectively than if the teachers had just lectured on the value of Indigenous heritage, or something along those lines.\n\nThe strategies of creating, connecting, and representing can often happen simultaneously, and in overlapping ways, but they can also happen separately. One of my main arguments is that all different kinds of strategies can be impactful, depending on the context and timing. I do not want to prescribe any one way of going about language activism, but rather to draw attention to the many strategies that exist. I also argue that it’s useful to have a flexible repertoire of strategies, and to attempt to adapt to the needs of the moment. I’m not aiming to provide a recipe for language activism, but perhaps more of a flexible playbook or a source of inspiration and illustration of the multiple strategies that are possible.\n\nhttps://www.berghahnbooks.com/title/BerlinerBecoming#:~:text=Description,an%20array%20of%20astonishing%20experiences.\n\nTodd Meyers: I think a fair place with which to open a discussion of Becoming Other is, “Where to start?” Where did this project begin for you? I’d also like to hear your thoughts on a bigger, more unwieldy question the book invites: how might we think of beginnings as we move and change (radically, subtly) across living?\n\nDavid Berliner: The book project started approximately 10 years ago. In parallel with my study into memory and cultural transmission, I became interested in the mechanisms of immersion, beginning, of course, with those that govern participant observation. By living alongside people and engaging in their daily activities, but also by constantly wondering what they think and sense, the anthropologist may feel as if she is “becoming other”, albeit lucid about such impossible metamorphosis. Being a Pentecostal among Pentecostals, boxing with boxers, Papuan among Papuans… Hortense Powdermaker writes that anthropologists are endowed with a particularly flexible, plastic, chameleonic self. I would add fragmentation to this.\n\nAnd this leads me to an earlier beginning of this project. I believe that my interest for such question rests in an existential trouble as a Belgian Jew. Jankélévitch sees in the very nature of the Jewish being to desire “to be the same and another at the same time”. Because they have often migrated from elsewhere, Jews have been trained to oscillate between compartmentalized repertoires of knowledge and action, following their own calendar, using their language, while at the same time appropriating the culture of others, a chameleonic identity at the service of personalities which have become divided. But it is also because they have experienced stereotypes, discrimination and violence at first hand that many Jews have learned to fragment their selves. All the better to blend in and absorb themselves in social and cultural worlds that were not favorable to them, an immersive capacity that is not intrinsic to Jews as I discuss in the final chapter in comparing their condition with other historically stigmatized and persecuted communities in the West.\n\nAbove all, I believe that the writing and the research behind this book have helped to make me slightly other, as I hope it will have such an effect on the reader.\n\nTodd Meyers: I’m fascinated by the ways you deal with self (selves) and experience in the book, especially the refashioning you call exo-experience, which you describe as “a singular type of experience by which an individual identifies oneself with an entity, whether it is human or not.” Could you talk more about exo-experience? I’d also like to know where (if at all) you see the book fitting within the larger frame of the anthropology of experience.\n\nDavid Berliner: Yes, I view this research as part of an anthropology of experience in line with the current trend recognized as “existential anthropology”, a pragmatic approach that scrutinizes lived experiences. Perhaps what distinguishes it from different endeavors is that, at the crossroad of social sciences and psychology, I look for some minimal ingredients exploring human mechanisms (in a Batesonian manner) rather than social causality. Immersive experiences that produce fragmented and plastic subjects are far from being reserved to the participation observation. To designate these phenomena, I indeed propose to use the term exo-experience which I define as quests driven by a desire to adopt the perspective of another, or even to live the existence of another, or at least what one imagines it to be. It is about investing a reality different from one’s own, from the inside, de l’intérieur. Some decide to materialize this identification in a theatrical style. Decentrement is their cardinal principle.\n\nIn particular, I look at a diversity of exo-experiences usually studied separately: cosplayers, animal role players, actors, drag kings and queens, historical reenactors, life action role-players, psychoanalysts (who, through transference, can embody the family of their analysands), and finally writers who dive in the personalities of their heroes. From these spectacular immersive examples, I ask: what do they teach us about the self, its multiple facets and its plasticity? Not only do they rely on similar psychological processes such as perspective taking, empathy, imitation, not only are they empowering and provide pleasure, but they also make possible the emergence of fragmented and flexible subjects, as do mutatis mutandis participant observation.\n\nTodd Meyers: Play is so crucial in the book, something I also found in my experience reading. Cosplay, role-playing, all the slippery forms of identification—-each is lively and often unexpected, but also keenly political. There are moments in the book where people appear to be working through forms of deep empathy and care. Becoming Other shows so well a wide range of forms of self-making, including those that are currently fraught and actively denied. Can you talk more about the political scope of the project?\n\nDavid Berliner: Cosplay, animal role-play, novel-writing and participant observation, with the stories of heterogeneity they produce, help rethink the idea of the human as a unidimensional and constant being. They are laboratories for self-exploration, demonstrating not only that the self is socially constructed, but also that it must be considered in an ever pluralized and changing way. For some, these exo-experiences constitute a crossing, sometimes a transgression loosening the screws of identity categorizations, contesting the powerful rhetoric of the unitary authentic self.\n\nHowever, exo-experiences are not just about play, an aspect I examine in the final chapter of the book. Some have to perform at being what the dominant wants them to be. They have become experts in plasticity, specialists in camouflage, switching from one role to another, modulating their language, their behavior. This is the condition of the colonized, the persecuted, the inferiorized who, in a state of alert, have learned to internalize the master’s point of view in their self– construction. The resulting cleavages generate considerable suffering. I don’t dare to compare such alienating ordeals to the thrill of fictional and playful exo-experiences. However, they do share some essential psychological components. Perspective taking. Imagination. Creative imitation. Multiplication. Pretending. Masks.\n\nIn this book, I follow Michel Serres’ position that such conditions of fragmentation and elasticity should not be thought of as “epistemological monsters”, but as “ordinary situations”. Moreover, I advocate for an ethic of multiplicity and plasticity, as capacities to be accessible to everyone, and to be the result of a deliberate choice rather than an imposed constraint.\n\nTodd Meyers: Finally, where do we go from here? I ask because having read Becoming Other a few times by now, the book’s thesis leaves me with both a sense of promise and terror, which I find hard to reconcile, and maybe that’s the point.\n\nDavid Berliner: I share your impression of hope and fear. Some commentators argue that late capitalist postmodernity, with its loosening of traditional norms, has produced infinitely adaptable individuals, versatile beings with fragmented and flexible (multitasking) selves. Although I partake worries about such neoliberal crafting, my position is slightly more nuanced. With my colleague sociologist Maria Erofeeva, we are now exploring the gymnastics of the selves on social virtual reality platforms such as VRChat. Yet, such technologies certainly are adamant to boost a protean desire to multiplicity and plasticity. The 3D headset, with its stereoscopic rendering and wide field of vision, offers the possibility to immerse oneself in the perspective of a cow, of a migrant, of another gender, of a fictional character — from the inside — . For some, it will be a matter of enjoying parallel lives via their avatars, for example by exploring identities or pretending to be someone else. As you stroll down the pixelated aisles of VRChat, you’ll find yourself amidst digital incarnations with a variety of bodies and faces (elves, anime girls, psychedelic mushrooms, hybrid humans, femboys, robots, and so on) There is a lot of literature on the ability of VR to enhance empathy, a view that is not shared by everybody as VR can only be experienced from one’s own biographical coordinates.\n\nHowever, such an othering dimension remains half of the story. While they do role-play, and attempt to become other in such digital spaces, many VRChat users feel that their avatars, which they spend time creating and get attached to, give them the courage to be more themselves, and even to reveal secret aspects of their identity (what I call endo-experiences). Here, for instance, members of the LGBTQ+ and furry (people who identify with animals) communities come together and communicate freely. Since 2017, Symor (who is portrayed as Winnie the Pooh) has been collecting life stories from individuals who, under the mask of their avatar — sometimes a Kermit the Frog, sometimes a Bugs Bunny — dare to talk about their pain as veterans, alcoholics, victims of harassment, or cancer sufferers.\n\nAll this to say that, while the metaverse is heralded as a frightening neoliberal territory with no law or order (like the dystopian world invented by Stephenson), it could also become a machine for empathy. A machine where people would learn to distance from their false self (“you can be your true self” is a formula often heard in VRChat), but also, through the multiplicity and plasticity offered by VR technologies, explore and care about otherness.\n\nhttps://www.ucpress.edu/book/9780520389380/heavy-metal-islam\n\nLara Sabra: Your book has shown that especially in the Middle East, which suffers from censorship and authoritarian regimes, art can be and is used as a political weapon/strategy for defiance and even relief from experiences of violence and repression. What can we learn about society or about politics from studying art and music? How can music or art, more generally, function as a resource towards understanding issues that social scientists typically explore?\n\nMark LeVine: You know that’s kind of interesting because art is one of the first things that humans did, that makes us human. The ability to create symbolic representations of reality or of our imagination and then share them with other humans – that’s probably one of the defining features that separate us from every other species on this planet. So it’s interesting that one of the most basic expressions of our humanity is so rarely used as an arena for investigation or study by political scientists and other social scientists. That’s a problem of political science and the narrowness of their conception of what politics is. It’s not just a problem of art or culture and how they’re excluded from analyses of politics, it’s also a disciplinary problem within the social sciences, this idea that you can separate politics from sociology, or sociology from anthropology. Obviously, there are nuances and every discipline has its own particular focuses, but they also all run into each other and ask different questions about what is quite often the same phenomenon, usually involving power and how humans gather, utilize, maintain, and hold onto power over other human beings. Art is going to be, like you said, a weapon in those struggles. Its also going to be a tool of resilience or healing; art can be medicine. But also, art talks back to power, always.\n\nAnd usually when people don’t have the power to resist directly, either politically or physically through fighting or some form of mass protest, they can at least resist through art. So art becomes a site of resistance. If art is a site of resistance, then it’s inherently political. Therefore, looking at art and artistic production becomes a way of understanding politics that might not be visible if you’re just looking at the official political realm – the realm of official political contestation and of official political actors like voters, politicians, insurgents, military. Art expands the conversation. Looking at art brings to the surface trends or beliefs that might still be hidden, because bringing them to the surface in that way would expose people to state violence and repression.\n\nAnd on the other hand, it’s not just about studying the art produced by the oppressed, it’s also about studying the art produced by the oppressor. With Israel/Palestine right now, we can understand even more about the nature of this violence and occupation by looking at the music and artwork created by Israelis and Palestinians since October 7, than we can by looking at official pronouncements to the media. Art is usually way more honest. Even when the art is duplicitous, even when it’s state-sponsored art created to reinforce a clearly nonsense program – it still tells us how the government sees things; or which people the government thinks it needs to speak to in cultural ways and what discourse it thinks it can most usefully deploy to maintain its grip on people.\n\nLara Sabra: How important was collaboration in the research for and the creation of this book? There are several moments in the book where you describe your participation in various activities with your research participants by playing musical gigs, co-writing and composing songs, and even co-writing or editing chapters of your book. How did this collaboration come about? Was it intentional or spontaneous and organic?\n\nMark LeVine: There’s a famous quote that I’ve used many times by this great African musician Manu Dibango, who famously said “There is only one race: the race of musicians.” What he was getting at is how musicians from very different cultures can meet each other, and within minutes of meeting each other they can be playing together as brothers or sisters. There is this ability in musicians to create deep relationships very quickly with each other through music. And because I approached many of these artists that I wound up writing about and working with first as a musician, it was much easier for me to work with them and for them to trust me.\n\nI think the traditional mode of doing ethnographic research is extremely extractive and highly imbalanced in terms of power relationships, and very often has no benefit for the people involved. One of the places where this has long been challenged has been in ethnomusicology. The pioneers in doing this have long been musicians who are also anthropologists. If you look at their work – people like Steven Feld or Philip Bohlman – they tend to work collaboratively with the people they’re studying and produce collaborative research that reflects a shared set of values, questions, and assumptions. This is of much more benefit and more respectful to the communities they’re studying than the kind of extractive anthropology that has for so long been dominant, though less now than before.\n\nI’m also very influenced by Indigenous research methodologies and protocols by Indigenous peoples who have always been the biggest victims of this kind of extractive research to begin with. There’s an entire set of Indigenous research principles revolving around collaboration, permission, respect – what I and Prof. Lucia Sorbera of Sydney University call a collaborative ontology. That’s the principle I’ve long worked in. You can’t treat people as merely objects or subjects of your extractive knowledge – the way anthropologists traditionally treated so-called primitive peoples. I always try to begin my relationship with people by asking them, how can I be useful to you? What story can I tell that is helpful and respectful to them and that teaches other people something they don’t know? My philosophy has always been to work with people as musicians first, and then let them tell me what aspects of their lives and their art they think are important to share with other people.\n\nLara Sabra: While the musical genre the book is focusing on is heavy metal, you make continuous references to musicians who explore other genres throughout the book such as hip-hop, rap, and rock. Indeed, when I think about music in relation to politics, I think of these musical genres first and foremost, especially drawing on my own experience within protest movements in Beirut of the past decade where it was these types of music that was played at protest squares (not heavy metal). Why did you choose to focus on heavy metal specifically?\n\nMark LeVine: Since I wrote that book, metal has become less popular, a lot of young people have switched over to hip-hop. It’s easier, it’s cheaper to record, it’s more popular in a way. So hip-hop and EDM have kind of supplanted metal. Electro-dabke, Omar Suleiman, all of those people have become big stars by mixing together house, electronic, with Arab(ic) dance music –that’s a huge thing, but it wasn’t yet so prevalent when I was doing research for the book. In that period, from the early 90s to the mid-2000s, metal was the premier form of rebellious youth music. By 2007, hip-hop had taken over as the more popular form of what I call “Extreme Youth Music.”\n\nBut metal has more pure emotional power than these other genres; it enables a real catharsis. If a form of art can carry and transmit a lot of power, then it’s also gonna transmit a lot of political power. So naturally, it was a very easy music genre to politicize, even if it’s political in a very subcultural way. When Egyptian or Iranian artists are singing metal songs in English, they are usually saying things that would get them arrested or thrown in jail. Metal was able to transmit political protest, even if it was just within the in-group or subculture. Hip-hop is powerful because of the vocal element, the words, the lyrics, the specificity. Metal is much more about the power of the music and the guttural-ness of the vocals. The words are important too, but less important than the power and the way they are being sung. I created a term called “aeffect” – a combination of affect or effect – to refer to this kind of affective power that has political effect. Metal music is very aeffective – it’s got incredibly affective power, at a pre-political, pre-discursive level, but that also has immediate discursive political implications.\n\nLara Sabra: I’m fascinated by one of the ideas you seem to be exploring in this book, which is the similarity and subsequent competition between the alternative, youth-driven heavy metal scenes in the Arab world and the religious/political authorities dominating their societies. Can you elaborate or expand on this?\n\nMark LeVine: Metal as an intense, affective music shares many of the same practices as extreme religious practice, like Sufism, for example. When you see Sufi practices of dance and rhythmic movement to very intense drum beats and you watch people moving, it looks like they’re headbanging. And they are headbanging. It’s the same thing, the way the human body goes into a trance-like, repetitive extreme movement, to rhythms that encourage that. So of course, metal is gonna have a lot in common with that, because it’s an ecstatic form of music. Same thing with a mosh pit in a punk show – it’s the same kind of ritualistic intense movement that produces this emotional psychic state that is very similar to religious states that get produced through extreme practices. That’s why a friend of mine in Pakistan, this famous musician named Salman Ahmad, from the band Junoon, said, “The reason why the mullahs hate us is because we’re their competition.” And he didn’t mean politically – what he means is that they satisfy the same human needs of young people as religion. And that’s why there are attacks on metal and other musicians by conservative religious forces, because they understood they were a threat to them.\n\nLara Sabra: Much has changed in the political landscapes of most of the countries you write about in this book, and arguably much has gotten worse. What would you say makes this book relevant today? What are the implications of this book now? Is art/music still a legitimate and transformative space of resistance/alterity/creativity in light of the extreme violence we’ve witnessed very recently?\n\nMark LeVine: What I said in Heavy Metal Islam is that music is like a canary in the coal mines for looking at changes that are going to happen whether or not the elite in these countries want it or not. In some ways, I think it’s fair to say that I’m one of the people who predicted the explosion of youth activism that we saw with the uprisings of 2009 and beyond (really, 2005-06 in Lebanon). Many of the people and the music that I was studying in the early 2000s went on to be very important in the revolutionary moment of 2009-2014. Most of the young activists in the Arab uprisings or Iran were people who came out of the extreme music scene. And this is because – and this is key – the set of skills you need to form an underground DIY song culture are the same set of skills you need to form an underground DIY political or social movement. You need to know how to organize, you need to know how to circulate ideas and cultural production, you need to know how to get people together – all without the authorities knowing. You need to create something that appeals to a lot of the people in your group without being noticed by others. And these are all the things you need to do underground politics. So it wasn’t surprising to me that the people who were running Tahrir Square when I got there on day four of the uprisings were all my metalhead friends. The landscape has changed, and metal is not as important today in the region as it was then. But find what is the metal of today: find what music today plays the role that metal did, and spend time looking at it."
