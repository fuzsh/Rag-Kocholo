        "text": "Next month I will begin sharing the sequel to my first novel, ‘SONS OF THE GREAT SATAN’,which was inspired by my teen years as an American expat living in Tehran, Iran just prior to the Iranian Revolution of the late 1970s. The second part of this tale is called ‘SINS OF THE GREAT SATAN’, which I’m currently shopping to publishers. Only my Patreon supporters at the “You Gotta Friend In Me” level will get a sneak-peek at this long-coming sequel.\n\nSupport my writing efforts at: www.patreon.com/cherokeerefugee\n\n9 years ago, I wrote SONS OF THE GREAT SATAN as part passion project and part exorcism. Most of my life I dreamed of writing a novel. I wrote song lyrics, poems, and short stories but I always wanted to tackle a novel. Authors fascinated me — they still do. I idolise my favourite authors just like rock stars. Keith Richards — meet Stephen King. Frank Herbert — say hello to Brian May. Kate Bush — might I introduce you tothe lovely Anne Rice. Mr. McCarthy— this is Mr. Reed.\n\nTurning the imagination into reality was something I longed to do myself. Since I was a child, I’ve had voices in my head. I’ve replayed conversations over and over, recited dialog, quoted song lyrics, and absorbed movies scene by scene. I Iive in this world and simultaneously in the imaginary one in my head. The daydream jukebox never stops, but there is one story that loomed larger than all the rest — my high school years in Tehran, Iran during the Islamic Revolution.\n\nI was only in Iran for three and a half years from my freshman to my senior year but those years cast a huge shadow. A revolution will do that to you. ‘SONS OF THE GREAT SATAN’ is part nostalgia and part trauma therapy. To be a 70’s “rock and roll all night at party every day” expat kid, AND to live through a revolution, AND to witness your parent’s marriage dissolve in the process — yeah, there’s a story in there.\n\nI initially started writing a memoir about Iran, a family-in-crisis story. And then I started again. And again. And again. For decades I started writing a memoir but each time I hit the wall. The story was in me but it wouldn’t come out. I slowly realised that I didn’t want to tell my story nor did I want to drag all our family baggage into it. Besides, the Roberts’ story was too small for such a huge event. I wanted to tell an epic, a multi-sided tale that would cut across class and culture. I wanted to show a cataclysmic event unfold on a big stage with lots of actors — it would be my story and many others. And if I was true with my feelings and honest with my intent — well, maybe it might hint at that bigger tapestry we like to call ‘history’. It was a grand vision to tackle for a first novel but it was something I felt compelled to do and I did it to the best of my ability. First novels are just that and ‘SONS OF THE GREAT SATAN’ was mine.\n\nMy lovely wife Judith gave me 9 months off work to write the first draft of ‘SONS’. Every day I got up and banged out page after page. My wife’s support was a gift and an obligation to give her her money’s worth and get the job done. I spent the next year editing and hiring what help I could afford, and then I set out to find a publisher — which never happened. To be honest, I looked for less than a year and nobody I contacted was interested in publishing a first novel about the Iranian Revolution as told by an American teenager now traumatised adult.\n\nSo I self-published ‘SONS’ under my own banner, Big Zig Publishing, and then a funny thing happened. It sold. It got great reviews. I paid off all my production costs and wound up selling over three thousand copies, which is pretty damn good for a self-published novel. SONS also made it to the semi-finals of Amazon’s Breakthrough Novel of the Year — Top 100 out of 60,000 entries. Most importantly to me, it was embraced by expats as well as members of the Iranian diaspora and I even got some positive feedback from readers still living in Iran though I’m certain that it will never be on any bookshelves as long as the IRI rules Iran.\n\nMy father even gave me a lovely review of Terry Andrews, the protagonist’s father in ‘SONS’. “Well, if you feel the need to call me an asshole in print, I’m sure I deserved it.” (I had to remind him that all of the characters were really just voices in my head, all aspects of me — not him — because that’s how fiction works… even when it pulls from observation and dodgy fathers.)\n\nDo I have the cultural knowledge to truly express what the Iranian revolution was about — not really — not at all — that can only come from an Iranian, but I can tell a fictional story born of my own emotions and impressions — and if I’m honest maybe I can tell a good story. The key word here is “story” as in A WORK OF FICTION.\n\nSONS OF THE GREAT SATAN is not any kind of truth — it is a dark fairy tale born of a teenage boy’s broken heart. It’s my story, partly, and not at all, and one must read it like that — it’s just a story, a dark vision, a nightmare of lost souls and hopeless causes from characters who deserved better and some far worse.\n\nSo why did I write a sequel?\n\nBecause I felt like the story was left unfinished. I took it up to the commencement of the revolution (which was the part that I lived through) but I never got to the actual revolution and its aftermath. As much as I loved SONS, I felt that Joey and Farhad needed a few more years to complete their stories. We left them as boys traumatised by a cataclysm and I wanted to know the answer to “and what happened next” to them. What kind of men would they become? ‘SINS OF THE GREAT SATAN’ is the answer to that question and the bookend to all I will ever write about Iran. (I guess you should never say never, but with SONS and SINS I think I’ve laid my ghosts to rest, and hopefully, with the heart and respect that they deserve.)\n\nNext month I will start publishing chapters of SINS here on my Patreon page for my supporters as part of my “short story of the month” program. Those of you who have read SONS will have no problem picking up the story. There are characters you already know as well as new ones, and the story is just as big if not bigger. It will be fun sharing this with you as I continue to shop it around to publishers here in New Zealand.\n\nFor those who haven’t read the first novel, might I suggest https://www.amazon.com/SONS-GREAT-SATAN-Anthony-Roberts-ebook/dp/B004MPRCNC\n\nFor those who’ve read SONS but it’s been awhile, here’s a synopsis to refresh your memory:\n\nNOTE: if you plan to read the ‘SONS OF THE GREAT SATAN’, then please don’t read this synopsis!)\n\nSPOILERS! SPOILERS! SPOILERS!\n\nSTOP READING NOW!\n\n# # # # #\n\nSONS OF THE GREAT SATAN (Synopsis)\n\nTerry, Diane and Joey Andrews return to Texas after five long years in Saudi Arabia to find the country mired in recession and unemployment. Dad is content to wallow in drunken self-pity until an offer arrives from his old boss, Bob Gandalfi, and their new benefactor — the Shah of Iran. With anticipation for a fresh start, the Andrews family takes flight to a new life in Tehran, Iran.\n\nA change of venue does little to slow Terry’s all-star drinking program or his disintegrating marriage; he and Diane separate but remain in Iran so their son can finish his senior year at Tehran American School (TAS).\n\nFarhad Zadeh becomes Joey Andrews best friend at TAS. Each boy represents an aspect of modern Iran that the mullahs despise: foreign influence and the Shah’s rejection of traditional Islamic culture. Farhad’s father, Colonel Massoud Zadeh, is a loving family man — the exact opposite of the self-centered Terry Andrews (Joe’s father) — but the Colonel has blood on his hands too as he is a high-ranking officer in the Shah’s dreaded internal security agency, SAVAK.\n\nAs President Jimmy Carter debates what action to take in Iran; BBC correspondent, Colin Davies, introduces us to the highly intelligent but regally aloof Shah Mohammad Pahlavi and his arch-nemesis, the fervently radical holy man, Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini.\n\nUniversity student, Javeed Yasmin, and his elderly Professor, Farouk Tadjiki, both fall under Colonel Zadeh’s ever suspicious eye, and soon the Professor and his wife must flee for their lives while young Javeed seeks sanctuary in the Ayatollah’s burgeoning revolutionary movement. Javeed meets taxi driver, Ali Hamidi, who sells hashish to American students, but is secretly one of the Ayatollah’s fanatical followers. Together they plot revenge against Colonel Zadeh and his family for SAVAK’s crimes and the murder of Ali’s beloved uncle.\n\nThe rock’n’roll all night and party every day free-wheeling lifestyle of Joey and his classmates slams headfirst into a bloody revolution and a clash of cultures. The boys fight their way out of a street riot and one of Joey’s inner circle winds up in the notorious Evin Prison where Colonel Zadeh’s men torture him for information. Professor Tadjiki and his wife attempt an arduous march across the mountainous Iran-Turkey border to escape SAVAK. Student radical, Javeed Yasmin, rises in the revolutionary ranks to lead a demonstration at Jaleh Square that is brutally put down by Colonel Zadeh and the Shah’s Imperial forces.\n\nAfter the martyrdom of Black Friday, the exiled Ayatollah Khomeini calls for a General Strike and the country grinds to a halt. Colonel Zadeh sends his family to their villa on the Caspian Sea to shield them from the erupting violence and any potential retribution for his actions with SAVAK. Joey and Diane Andrews hole-up and wait for the airport to reopen so they can leave Iran. Terry Andrews secretly marries his Iranian girlfriend, Noori, and makes plans for their new life in America.\n\nThe Shah refuses to crush the rebellion and proclaims he will take a ‘temporary vacation’ to let tempers cool. The country spirals into chaos forcing the American Embassy to announce a mass evacuation of all U.S. citizens. Joey and Diane head for the airport and barely escape a street execution by the newly empowered Brother Javeed and his crew of revolutionary thugs. The Shah departs and the Ayatollah Khomeini returns sending the nation into an ecstatic frenzy of religious mania and cruel street justice.\n\nColonel Zadeh enlists the help of Terry’s boss and former CIA agent, Bob Gandalfi, to get his family out with the American evacuation. As the Zadeh’s prepare to depart, the Ayatollah’s men arrive at their home to exact God’s justice. Down the street, Terry Andrews is looking for his missing passport; he sees the guards arrive at the Zadeh’s home and then hears screams. Against his better judgement and thinking of his own son — Terry intervenes. Through an intense and violent debate with an aged Imam, Terry manages to save the lives of Farhad and his mother, but Colonel Zadeh is summarily executed. Fleeing with the beaten and bloodied Zadeh’s, Terry gathers Noori and they all make a mad dash to the airport where Bob Gandalfi pulls some mighty-long strings to get them aboard the last evac flight out of Iran.\n\n# # # # #\n\nA year after Khomeini’s return, Professor Tadjiki meets with old friends at the George Inn in London and tells the story of his hellish border crossing. At the end of his tale, the Professor’s youngest daughter arrives and announces that she is pregnant and wishes to name the forthcoming baby girl, Marjan, after her mother.\n\nThe final chapter reunites Joey and Farhad in Texas just after the American hostages have been released. Joey is troubled by his time in Iran and his estranged relationship with his father. Seeing Joey’s pain, Farhad tells him that it was his father, Terry Andrews, who rescued them from the revolutionary guards the day his own father was brutally murdered.\n\nThe novel ends atop a water-tower in West Texas where Joey paints over his angry words of ‘FUCK IRAN’ with new graffiti — ‘SONS OF THE GREAT SATAN — CLASS OF ‘79’. Though Joey is lost in a maelstrom of conflicting emotions, Farhad’s faith in God and humanity is reaffirmed by the selfless actions of Terry Andrews. Farhad ends the story by advising the agnostic Joey to look beyond his hatred and his father’s many faults, for divine mercy and compassion exist even in the most flawed vessels.\n\n“Perhaps it does not matter what we believe, my friend ― only that someone believes in us.”\n\n* Rock music was the soundtrack to life as a teenager in the late 1970’s. We listened to it constantly, we talked about it, and it was everywhere we went — even in Iran. The chapter titles in Sons of the Great Satan are all taken from popular songs of the era and illustrate each chapter’s broad theme.\n\n# # # # #\n\n© Anthony H. Roberts, 2022."
