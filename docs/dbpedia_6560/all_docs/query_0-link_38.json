        "meta_description": "UN Peace Ambassador and Pakistani rock star Salman Ahmad will perform his music and read from his text.\n\nSalman Ahmad is the popular guitarist and composer of the musical group Junoon. Since its formation in the early 1990s, Junoon has become a phenomenon in the South Asian music scene and beyond, performing live at BBC's Mega Mela, the MTV music awards in India, and at the United Nations General Assembly in New York. Ahmad, with Junoon, has been increasingly involved in humanitarian efforts, including playing at events such as the Building Human Rights Culture Gala, the Empower Peace program with students in Pakistan, and fundraising for Hurricane Katrina victims\n\nAhmad has produced two documentary films. The Rock Star and the Mullahs tracks Ahmad's visit to the northern Pakistani town of Peshawar, where he directly challenges the local Muslim clergy who have banned all forms of music. His most recent film, Muslims in America: It's My Country Too, uncovers the authentic spirit of American Muslims and their experience wrestling with the personal and social consequences of the 9/11 attacks.\n\nAhmad is a goodwill ambassador for the UN, acting as the US national spokesperson in the fight against HIV/AIDS. He is also on the board of directors of Breakthrough, an international human rights organization that uses education and popular culture to promote values of dignity, equality, and justice.\n\nSalman will be playing a concert at Willamette High School for free on October 25th at 7pm, and he will also be speaking in the Mills International Center for free at 11am on October 25th. He will be accompanied by UO music faculty Doug Scheuerell on Tabla on both evenings. Tickets for the Beall Hall performance can be purchased through the Ticket Office or online at http://tickets.uoregon.edu, powered by Concept3D Event Calendar Software",
