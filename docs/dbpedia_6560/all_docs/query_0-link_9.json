        "text": "PBS Wide-Angle\n\nThe Rock Star and the Mullahs\n\nIntroduction\n\nAbout the Film\n\nSalman Ahmad is the charismatic lead guitarist for the popular Pakistani rock group, Junoon. Inspired by the ancient Sufi tradition, the band’s music and lyrics reflect the moderate, liberal side of Islam.\n\nHe has also become a Special Representative for UNAIDS, and he and the group have publicly advocated the cause of peace with India. But a coalition of fundamentalist Islamic parties has made recent gains in Pakistani elections, and Junoon’s high profile places them in conflict with the hardliners.\n\nWIDE ANGLE follows Salman Ahmed as he journeys to the tolerant, ancient city of Lahore and the fundamentalist stronghold of Peshawar to reveal the internal religious and political conflicts of nuclear-armed Pakistan. The mullahs want to ban the music but Junoon’s fans, among them Pakistani President Pervez Musharraf, have made Salman a rock idol.\n\nThe Rock Star and the Mullahs documentary is no longer available through PBS Wide-Angle. Given that this post is among the most read, we were able to get the six videos of the documentary through Junoon, Salman Ahmed’s band.\n\nWatch The Rock Star and the Mullahs Full Episode in six videos:\n\n1. The Rock Star and the Mullahs Part 1 – A Journey Through Pakistan With Salman Ahmad\n\n2. The Rock Star and the Mullahs Part 2 – A Journey Through Pakistan With Salman Ahmad\n\n3. The Rock Star and the Mullahs Part 3 – A Journey Through Pakistan With Salman Ahmad\n\n4. The Rock Star and the Mullahs Part 4 – A Journey Through Pakistan With Salman Ahmad\n\n5. The Rock Star and the Mullahs Part 5 – A Journey Through Pakistan With Salman Ahmad\n\n6. The Rock Star and the Mullahs Part 6 – A Journey Through Pakistan With Salman Ahmad"
