Salman Ahmad, charismatic lead guitarist for the Pakistani rock group Junoon, has publicly advocated peace with India. Ahmad is also UNAIDS Special Representative. But a coalition of fundamentalist Islamic parties has made unexpected gains in Pakistani elections-evoking contrasts between liberals like Ahmad and hardliner mullahs who want to ban music. This Wide Angle report follows the artist as he journeys to the tolerant, ancient city of Lahore and the fundamentalist stronghold of Peshawar, revealing religious and political conflicts within the nuclear-armed Islamic republic. From this trip emerges a rich portrait of modern-day Pakistan, a pivotal nation in the war against terror. In addition, anchor Mishal Husain interviews Christina Rocca, Assistant Secretary of State for South Asia. (57 minutes)
