The first four tournaments of the UEFA Women's Under-19 Championship were in the U-18 category. In 2001, the German Football Association decided to change the age limit from the U-18 team to U-19. The move was in preparation for 2002 UEFA Women's Under-19 Championship (competition that served as a qualifying tournament for the 2002 FIFA U-19 Women's World Championship).
