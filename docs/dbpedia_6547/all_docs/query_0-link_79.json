        "text": "Current roster of Slovenian NT for 2024:\n\nS: Sara Najdič,Eva Pogačar, Žana Ivana Halužan Sagadin,\n\nOH: Maša Pucelj, Mija Siftar, Selena Leban, Lorena Lorber Fijok, Julija Grubišić Čabo,\n\nOP: Nika Markovič,\n\nMB: Saša Planinšec, Mirta Velikonja Grbac, Nika Milošič\n\nL: Katja Banko, Anja Mazej\n\nIt seems like we have some kind of drama in Slovenian NT.\n\nMany players refused the invitation to NT, among them: Darja Eržen, Iza Mlakar, Klara Milošič, Lara Rituper, Naja Boisa, Lana Ščuka and Eva Pavlović Mori.\n\nEva Zatković., Sara Hutinski, Asja Šen told that they need rest and for sure won't be participating in the few first weeks of national team season.\n\nDisplay More\n\nThey have talented young pool of outsides, so I don't think scuka will be missed a lot. I don't know how are their other setters, but Mori was really bad when she played in turkey. Iza mlakar might be missed though but it seems like volleyball is not her priority\n\nGood that planinsec is back to NT. I think she is an underrated player. Her first season in turkey was amazing\n\nThe coaching team around Michal Mašek has already announced the expanded squad of the Slovak national team. The squad is a mix of experienced players (such as Barbora Koseková, Karin Palgutová and Nikola Radosová) and young talented players (such as Nina Boledovičová).\n\nS: Barbora Koseková (1994), Lucia Sedláčková (1999), Anna Kohútová (2003)\n\nOH: Karin Palgutová (1993), Maria Žernovič (1993), Karolína Fričová (2000), Zuzana Šepeľová (1999), Nikola Radosová (1992), Lucia Herdová (2000), Simona Jelínková (2001), Deana Valentová (2005)\n\nU: Karin Šunderlíková (1999), Diana Návratová (2003), Zuzana Písečná (1997), Michaela Jančová (2003)\n\nB: Katarína Kormendyová (1999), Tereza Hrušecká (2002), Ema Smiešková (2003), Nina Boledovičová (2004), Barbora Truchlá (2006)\n\nL: Michaela Pállová (1999), Skarleta Jančová (1997), Ema Magdinová (1999), Zuzana Justhová (2004)\n\nIn my opinion, the squad doesn't contain any big surprises. Compared to last year's Golden League squad, even more experienced players could take part. Because last year, for example, Karin Palgutová, Maria Žernovič and Nikola Radosová did not take part in the Golden League. The first two mentioned were then in the squad for the European Championship.\n\nThe reasons why they might take part this year are obvious. For Slovakia, the Golden League is the only major national team event this year. However, with a view to the 2025 World Championships, it is important for Slovakia, as Slovakia does not want to squander its good starting position for participating in a World Championships for the first time.\n\nIn terms of the squad, you could perhaps say that the middle block position could become a weak point. Because there, Slovakia has to herald the change for the new generation. Long-time middle blocker Michaela Abrhámová has ended her career and Nina Herelová is out with a torn cruciate ligament."
