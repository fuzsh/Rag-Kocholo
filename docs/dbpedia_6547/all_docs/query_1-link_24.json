        "text": "Andreasâ€™s Biography\n\nAndreas started his professional career at Swedish side Trelleborgs FF in 1998 where he made 11 league appearances before signing for Italian giants Juventus in 1999 at the age of eighteen.\n\nHe spent two year in Turin without ever making the first team at Juve and he returned to Sweden to play for for Djurgardens in 2001. Andreas made 75 league appearances in his three years at the club and won two Swedish titles as well as the Swedish Cup. He also made his UEFA competition debut at Djurgardens when he appeared in the 3-1 defeat of Shamrock Rovers in the 2002/03 Uefa Cup.\n\nIn 2004 Andreas signed for French side Rennes where he played for two years before signing for Manchester City after the 2006 World Cup finals. He made his debut for City in December of that year and made 19 league appearances in a two year spell that was disrupted by injuries.\n\nIn the summer of 2008 Andreas was on the move again, this time to Dutch side PSV Eindhoven where he went on to make over 100 league appearances. He then moved to Turkish side Kasimpasa in July 2012 and has made over 100 league appearances there too.\n\nAndreas made his full international debut for Sweden against Switzerland in March 2002 while still at Djurgardens and played in all of Sweden's games at the 2004 European Championship finals. He has been Sweden's first choice keeper at all of the major tournaments since then."
