        "text": "From 1st January, 1998, players whose nineteenth birthday fell in the same calendar year as the final tournament of the UEFA Under-18 Championship, were additionally able to compete in that year's competition (including in the qualification matches played in the previous year). Prior to this, players reaching nineteen years of age from 1st August of the previous year (i.e. the beginning of the qualifying competition) were not eligible to take part at all in the competition. It was not until the 2001-02 season that it was renamed as the UEFA Under-19 Championship with the same age rules as had been in place throughout the last four editions of the UEFA Under-18 Championship. Consequently, from the season when this ruling was introduced, we have re-categorized England's games as Under-19 level. It would be wrong to make the change at the point when it was only the name of the UEFA competition that was changed. It was the beginning of the 1997-98 season when the England Under-18 team aligned to (what was to eventually become) the UEFA rule for Under-19 eligibility. Only by doing this can we make a fair distinction between players that represented England at Under-18 and their Under-19 equivalents."
