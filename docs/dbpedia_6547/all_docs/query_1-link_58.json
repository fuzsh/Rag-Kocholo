        "text": "Roll of Honour: Confirmed Ireland Women’s National Team Players\n\nLast update: 10 October 2022\n\nNotes: 1) I haven’t added many notes for current or recent players, as they usually have Wikipedia pages. 2) GAA is used as a shorthand for Gaelic Games although I found out after starting the list that technically the GAA is men-only and women have separate sub-organisations. 3) Anne O’Brien, Veronica Guerin and Ann McLoughlin have passed away, I apologise in advance if there are any others listed who I’m not yet aware are deceased.\n\nINDEX: A B C D E F G H I J K L M Mc N O P Q R S T U V W X Y Z\n\nA\n\nLily Maria Phoebe Agg – 17.12.93 – Brighton-born central midfielder whose Irish granny came to the notice of her coach Lisa Fallon at London City Lionesses. Won caps for England up to under 19 level. With Arsenal as a youth and spent 17-18 in Germany with Frankfurt, but mainly journeyed round several sub-top level clubs like Millwall, Brighton, Bristol City and Charlton Athletic while carving out a parallel career as a PE teacher. Highly sought after by Vera Pauw but the protracted eligibility switch was delayed by a broken leg then the covid 19 pandemic. Debut 19.6.22 v Philippines in Turkey and opened the scoring on her debut, much to the chagrin of foghorn-voiced opposition coach Alen ‘Staj’ Stajcic. Wiki\n\nIsibeal Carolan “Izzy” Atkinson – 17.7.01 – Winger from Dublin. Called into senior squad for WCQ in Slovakia, 24.10.17. Given senior debut as a 16yo 90th-minute sub for L Kiernan in 3-1 friendly win over Portugal in the Azores, 21.1.18.

Uni blocked her playing at 2007 World Student Games, to the irritation of Noel King. Outspoken Sept 2019 interview with The42.ie lifted the lid on the shambolic conditions in the summer 2009 10-week USA training camp (no physio, beds in apartments “like something from Alcatraz”, players came back overweight). She was out of favour after refusing to go on for the last 2 minutes of the third friendly defeat by the USA, 2-0 defeat at Bridgeview, IL, 20.9.08.

Played in Shelbourne’s 4-0 LFAI Cup final defeat by Shamrock Rovers at the Iveagh Grounds, August 1997.

Later popped up in a Liverpool County FA XI playing Everton Ladies at Runcorn FC 18.11.98: “Evelyn Carneghie (sic) – a doctor in sports psychology at Edge Hill University.

The game was called off after raging Reims boss Pierre Geoffroy ran on the pitch, ‘struck’ the local ref and petulantly refused to apologise. The Wicklow People noted approvingly: “Carol is well known as a good sport, despite the fact that she can tear defences to pieces with her blistering runs.” Linked w continental transfer to Roma/Standard Liege (“Too old at 20!” was the headline when Reims signed A O’Brien but passed on Carr). Capped v Wales and NI in 1973. One of three Avengers players in the 14-strong panel for the 4-1 win over NI, 30.6.73. Came on at HT for the injured P Gorham. A 17yo (born 55 or 56) Avengers inside right listed in the programme for the historic 3-2 win in Wales, 13.5.73. Reported to have agreed a lucrative nine-month £150-per-week deal with Standard in Jan 1975, which included a college scholarship. She was quoted in the Irish Press calling it a fairy-tale. Had been Avengers’ CF for 4 years but Ireland manager Pat Noone who brokered the transfer likened her aggressive ball-winning to Billy Bremner. She also played camogie for Bray Emmets who won the county championship in 1972 and 74. Didn’t stay long in Belgium and was soon back playing camogie with great success. Camogie beaks had apparently threatened bans on any players who took part in soccer (cf. GAA ‘foreign sports’ ban). She later played both codes of football for Kilmacanogue, alongside S Hayden. Helped Kilmac beat perennial rivals Arklow 2-0 in the Wicklow Cup final, 27.4.84 at Roundwood. Scored twice in a 5-1 win over Packard (Tallaght) to qualify for the final of something called the Paddy Breen Cup, in August 1985. In June 1989 a Carol Carr-Murphy featured for Co. Wicklow who saw off Kilkenny to win the Leinster camogie title. According to the match programme for the League of Ireland’s 9-1 defeat by Scottish League at Ravenscraig Stadium, Greenock, 17.3.74, she was a “Bray, Dublin” centre forward who had been capped against Wales, NI and France in 1973. She did go to Belgium in January 1975 (flew out 15.1.75) but was soon dismayed at aspects of the deal and demanded a “showdown” with Albert Tilkin, the millionaire industrialist and Standard Liege director who ran the Femina women’s team. Tilkin had spotted her playing against France at Parc des Princes 10.10.1973. The facilities were even worse than in Ireland and the £150pw salary breathlessly reported in Ireland turned out to be expenses, lodgings and pocket money. She hit four goals on her debut and played 14 games for the eventual League runners-up, but came home in April after “lonely months” and was in no hurry to go back. The previous year (1974) she had played in a Wicklow GAA intermediate club final as the only female of 30 participants. The GAA wanted to strike her a special medal but she refused and asked for a regular one. “There was no quarter given on any side and all the men treated me as just another player”. Liked GAA but branded soccer her “first love”. Married Gerard Murphy from Drumcondra, September 1976 at the Church of the Most Holy Redeemer, in Bray. Her mum denied she was only on £35-per-month in Belgium: “She wouldn’t go there for that, she was on £20-a-week at home”. She previously worked as a sales assistant in a boutique in Stillorgan, and planned to use the Standard cash to open her own boutique in Dublin. She was bereaved by the death of her brother Michael in April 1975, who died in a car accident. Snobby RTE refused to cover the story of her Belgian transfer and when Carr’s reps protested: “but it’s in all the papers” they sniffed: “We only read the quality papers”. In August 1970 she captained “Pete’s Angels” who played “George’s Girls” in a seven-a-side challenge match at the Carlisle Grounds, Bray, in aid of the Palermo Youth Club. There is a suggestion that K Taylor’s mum Bridget also played for Pete’s Angels at some stage. 10 brothers and sisters, one brother played rugby for Greystones RFC.\n\nKyra Taylor Carusa – 14.11.95, San Diego – 173cm FW – Attended Del Norte High School and played four seasons of youth soccer for San Diego Surf.

On graduation still had a year of soccer eligibility left due to her injury ‘redshirt’, so played out 2018 with Georgetown Hoyas while doing a master’s in marketing and communications. Hit 10 goals in 25 appearances. Georgetown’s Irish coach Dave Nolan tipped off Vera Pauw that she was Irish-eligible under the “granny rule”. Although the player claimed that the FAI had already been scouting her since she was 16. Played one match in the WPSL for LA Galaxy San Diego, scoring a hat-trick in a 6-2 mauling of San Diego Parceiro Ladies on 30 June 2018. Picked by Sky Blue FC 19th overall in the 2019 NWSL draft but snubbed them to sign instead for French second tier side Le Havre in April 2019. Not seen until September 2019 then scored twice on debut in a 3-0 win at Thonon Evian (and was trying to claim the other which was declared an OG) 15.9.19. Only played twice more adding another goal in her swansong 4-0 win at Amiens 3.11.19. It was then reported that she had signed for Utah Royals, who obtained her NWSL rights from something called ‘the re-entry wire’ when Sky Blue waived their claims on her. In pre-season she got itchy feet again and pitched up at ambitious Danish second tier club HB Koge in Feb 2020. It was described as an initial short-term contract on amateur terms, covering the upcoming promotion play-offs. She went directly to their plush Spanish training camp, then was in Denmark for six days which included two goals in a 4-1 friendly win over top flight FC Nordsjaelland. With her paperwork in place she then jetted off with Ireland for ECQs v Greece and Montenegro. Senior Ireland debut in 3-0 win over Montenegro 11.3.20 in Budva, 58th min sub for C Shine. Game was behind closed doors due to coronavirus. She remained with Koge to take part in the delayed promotion series in June. Remaining with Koge in the 2020/21 Kvindeligaen season she rattled in 9 goals in 12 games in the first phase, including two in a 5-0 thrashing of traditional powerhouse Brondby.
