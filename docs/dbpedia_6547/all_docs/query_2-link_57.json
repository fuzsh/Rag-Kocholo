        "text": "Aston Villa are back on home soil for the final part of their pre-season schedule as they take on La Liga side Athletic Club in Walsall.\n\nAfter starting the summer with a pair of comfortable 3-0 wins, Unai Emery's side endured a pretty wretched tour of the United States. Villa suffered three defeats to the Columbus Crew, RB Leipzig and Club America all while scoring just once.\n\nEmery has heavily rotated and also been without a couple of crucial figures, but supporters will undoubtedly be concerned over the club's performances so far given the significance of the season that lies ahead.\n\nHome comforts should benefit them on Wednesday as they take on Athletic Club. Ernesto Valverde's side enjoyed a fine 2023/24 campaign, finishing fifth in La Liga. They have also had a busy summer and this will undoubtedly be their biggest test ahead of their new season opener against Getafe on 15 August.\n\nHere is 90min's guide to Aston Villa's upcoming friendly against Athletic Club.\n\nAston Villa vs Athletic Club H2H Record (All Games)\n\nLast meeting: Aston Villa 2-1 Athletic Club (4 November 1997) - UEFA Cup\n\nCurrent form (all competitions)\n\nHow to watch Aston Villa vs Athletic Club on TV and live stream\n\nAston Villa team news\n\nEmery used the full extent of his squad out in the US and a long list of Villa stars should get run-outs on Wednesday.\n\nThe Spaniard is still without long-term absentees Boubacar Kamara and Tyrone Mings, while reserve goalkeeper Robin Olsen is also nursing a knock.\n\nIt remains to be seen when the likes of Ollie Watkins, Emiliano Martinez and Ezri Konsa will make their first starts of the summer.\n\nAston Villa predicted lineup vs Athletic Club\n\nAston Villa predicted lineup vs Athletic Club (4-3-3): Gauci; Cash, Bogarde, Torres, Digne; Onana, Tielemans, Barkley; Bailey, Archer, Rogers.\n\nAthletic Club team news\n\nEuro 2024 star Nico Williams continues to be linked with a move away this summer and the winger is yet to return to action for Athletic this summer. His brother, Inaki, will start on Wednesday, though.\n\nUnai Simon is nursing a wrist injury which could keep him out for the first few weeks of the season, while Julen Agirrezabala is dealing with a minor back problem and unlikely to play in Walsall.\n\nValverde otherwise has a full complement of players to choose from.\n\nAthletic Club predicted lineup vs Aston Villa (4-2-3-1): Padilla; De Marcos, Yeray, Vesga, Lekue; Prados, Herrera; Berenguer, Sancet, I. Williams; Guzureta.\n\nAston Villa vs Athletic Club score prediction\n\nThere weren't many positives to take from their tour of the States, although Emery won't read too much into their poor run of summer results given the rotation he's overseen and players he's been without.\n\nHe will, however, want to oversee an improvement in performance levels before their Premier League opener against West Ham.\n\nThey should benefit from being back on British shores in midweek, with Athletic Club doing the travelling. The Spaniards have produced a mixed bag in pre-season but this will undoubtedly be competitive.\n\nThis one could go either way, but Villa should get their second domestic win of pre-season."
