        "text": "As football continues to grow globally, flag football is opening doors to many who otherwise would not have a chance to play the game.\n\nThe International Federation of American Football is the global governing body responsible for growing American football around the world. The IFAF leads the regulation, competition, performance and development of the game. Currently, over 70 nations are IFAF members.\n\nFlag football competitions are a major part of the IFAF’s efforts, along with other international competitions. The IFAF first held world championships for men’s and women’s flag football in 2002 with tournaments occurring biannually.\n\nIn 2020, the NFL, IFAF, and International World Games Association announced that flag football would be added to the 2022 World Games.\n\nThe flag football competition featured eight men’s and eight women’s teams from around the world.\n\n“Being a part of the sports program in the 2022 World Games formalizes flag football as an international sport, which promotes the values and benefits of the game to fans around the world,” said Troy Vincent Sr., NFL executive vice president of football operations. “Flag football affords men and women, boys and girls, of all ages, body types, and athletic skills the opportunity to enjoy the values, fun and competitive environment that only football offers.”\n\nThe 2022 U.S. men’s and women’s flag football teams each competed in Gold Medal games in Birmingham, Alabama with the U.S. men winning gold and U.S. women winning silver. The U.S. women were defeated by Mexico's national team in the Gold Medal game.\n\nThe 2022 World Games marked the first time that flag football was part of an international, multi-sport event. More than 3,500 athletes from approximately 100 countries competed.\n\nGrowing the Game with NFL FLAG\n\nNFL FLAG is the largest youth flag football league in the U.S., with over half a million athletes competing in all 50 states.\n\nLearn more about NFL FLAG leagues in the U.S.\n\nNFL FLAG helps students across the U.S. become active and learn the game. Since 2014, the NFL FLAG-In-Schools program has distributed more than 24,000 flag football kits to physical education programs across the country, reaching an estimated 1.3 million students.\n\nRecently, the NFL FLAG-In-School program has expanded to reach international students — providing kits for students in Canada, Mexico, the United Kingdom, Germany, France, and China."
