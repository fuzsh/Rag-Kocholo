FULL TEXT Those of us who are not involved in sport may think that it has little impact on our everyday lives. Varda Burstyn ably leads us to consider that although 'big time' sport may only include a small part of society as active participants (primarily young males), it affects every one of us through the promotion of \"hypermasculine\" behaviours and values that permeate popular culture. The Rites of Men documents the insidious quality of sport that encourages men, women and children to be elitist, individualistic, competitive and coercive. Burstyn traces the roots of these tendencies in sport to the 19th century, and links this development to the emergence of capitalism. At this time, absent father figures began to be replaced by coaches who were to train boys to compete and dominate, and as such, to engage and get ahead in the economy. Sport culture developed as a tonic against effeminacy by devaluing women and the 'feminine' characteristics of cooperation, sensuality, receptivity and compassion. Few of us can explain a cooperative game, yet we are all familiar with games where the object is to draw lines and dominate the \"other.\" Burstyn contends that the predominance of this type of sport can nurture xenophobic and antisocial behaviours. She makes the connection to our increasingly neoconservative political climate, \"a combination of mean-spirited individualism, patriarchal gender norms, and antisocial state policies.\" Burstyn further shows how modern sport has enhanced global commodity culture, and vice versa. From childhood, athletes are groomed to be 'stars' that will enhance the sales of corporate sponsors. Racist and sexist stereotypes are validated and promoted through these stars, who are often poor, unrealistic role models to children and adults. It is sad to think that the corporate and hyper-masculine nature of sport can actually detract from the quality of life for the majority. The book ends with four concrete principles from which we can all begin to make change, sports enthusiasts and non-participants alike. It took me a long time to read The Rites of Men, but I am glad that I did. I only wish that it were more simply written so as to be accessible to the high school gym teacher or coach, the hockey/gymnastics mom (or parents, for that matter), the community sports council and the sport and civic policy makers.\n\nIt is often assumed that a recognisably modern sporting culture did not emerge until the eighteenth century. The plethora of physical training and games that existed before 1700 tend to fall victim to rigid historical boundaries drawn between \" modern \" and \" pre-modern \" sports, which are concerned primarily with levels of regulation, organization and competitiveness. Adopting a much broader and culturally based approach, the essays in this collection offer an alternative view of sport in the early modern period. Taking into account a variety of competitive as well as non-competitive forms of sport, physical training and games, the collection situates these types of activities as institutions in their own right within the socio-cultural context of early-modern Europe. Treating the period not only as a precursor of modern developments, but as an independent and formative era, the essays engage with overlooked topics and sources such as court records, self-narratives and visual materials, and with contemporary discussions about space, gender and postcolonial studies. By allowing for this increased contextualization of sport, the collection is able to integrate it into more general historical questions and approaches. The volume underlines how developments in early modern sport influenced later developments, whilst at the same time being thoroughly shaped by contemporary notions of the body, status and honour. These notions influenced not only the contemporary sporting fashion but the adoption of sports in elite education, the use of sports facilities, training methods and modes of competition, thus offering a more integrated idea of the place of sport in early modern society."
