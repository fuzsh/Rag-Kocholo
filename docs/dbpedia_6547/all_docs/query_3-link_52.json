        "text": "The UEFA Champions League is the pinnacle of club competition for teams based in Europe.\n\nManchester City finally put their name alongside the greatest teams to ever play after beating Inter Milan in the 2023 final. In 2024, Real Madrid extended their record as the most successful team in the competition's history after defeating Borussia Dortmund at Wembley Stadium.\n\nClubs from every European league have the opportunity to participate in the tournament by finishing high enough in their domestic competitions, and/or advancing in qualifying matches prior to the group phase starting. However, as the list below shows, heavyweight nations Spain, Germany, Italy and England tend to dominate.\n\nBut which teams have won the coveted Champions League, or its previous iteration, the European Cup, since the first edition back in 1955/56?\n\nThe Sporting News takes you through the list of teams that have been crowned kings of Europe.\n\nMORE: Which coaches and players have won the UEFA Champions League the most\n\nAll-time Champions League & European Cup winners\n\nThe competition was known as the European Cup until 1992/93 when it was revamped and rebranded as the UEFA Champions League.\n\nSeasonWinnerRunner-upScore202324Real MadridBorussia Dortmund2-02022/23Manchester CityInter Milan1-02021/22Real MadridLiverpool1-02020/21ChelseaManchester City1-02019/20Bayern MunichParis Saint-Germain1-02018/19LiverpoolTottenham Hotspur2-02017/18Real MadridLiverpool3-12016/17Real MadridJuventus4-12015/16Real MadridAtletico Madrid1-1 (5–3 pens)2014/15BarcelonaJuventus3-12013/14Real MadridAtletico Madrid4-1 (a.e.t.)2012/13Bayern MunichBorussia Dortmund2-12011/12ChelseaBayern Munich1-1 (4–3 pens)2010/11BarcelonaManchester United3-12009/10InterBayern Munich2-02008/09BarcelonaManchester United2-02007/08Manchester UnitedChelsea1-1 (6–5 pens)2006/07MilanLiverpool2-12005/06BarcelonaArsenal2-12004/05LiverpoolMilan3-3 (3-2 pens)2003/04PortoMonaco3-02002/03MilanJuventus0-0 (3-2 pens)2001/02Real MadridBayer Leverkusen2-12000/01Bayern MunichValencia1-1 (5-4 pens)1999/2000Real MadridValencia3-01998/99Manchester UnitedBayern Munich2-11997/98Real MadridJuventus1-01996/97Borussia DortmundJuventus3-11995/96JuventusAjax1-1 (4-2 pens)1994/95AjaxMilan1-01993/94MilanBarcelona4-01992/93MarseilleMilan1-01991/92BarcelonaSampdoria1-0 (a.e.t.)1990/91Red Star BelgradeMarseille0-0 (5-3 pens)1989/90MilanBenfica1-01988/89MilanSteaua Bucharest4-01987/88PSV EindhovenBenfica0-0 (6-5 pens)1986/87PortoBayern Munich2-11985/86Steaua BucharestBarcelona0-0 (2-0 pens)1984/85JuventusLiverpool1-01983/84LiverpoolRoma1-1 (4-2 pens)1982/83HamburgJuventus1-01981/82Aston VillaBayern Munich1-01980/81LiverpoolReal Madrid1-01979/80Nottingham ForestHamburg1-01978/79Nottingham ForestMalmo1-01977/78LiverpoolClub Brugge1-01976/77LiverpoolBorussia Monchengladbach3-11975/76Bayern MunichSaint-Etienne1-01974/75Bayern MunichLeeds United2-01973/74Bayern MunichAtletico Madrid4-0 (replay)1972/73AjaxJuventus1-01971/72AjaxInter2-01970/71AjaxPanathinaikos2-01969/70FeyenoordCeltic2-1 (a.e.t.)1968/69MilanAjax4-11967/68Manchester UnitedBenfica4-1 (a.e.t.)1966/67CelticInter2-11965/66Real MadridPartizan2-11964/65InterBenfica1-01963/64InterReal Madrid3-11962/63MilanBenfica2-11961/62BenficaReal Madrid5-31960/61BenficaBarcelona3-21959/60Real MadridEintracht Frankfurt7-31958/59Real MadridReims2-01957/58Real MadridMilan3-2 (a.e.t.)1956/57Real MadridFiorentina2-01955/56Real MadridReims4-3\n\nHistory of the Champions League and European Cup\n\nThe European Cup was first established in 1955, and it remained under that name until the 1992/93 season, when the competition was revamped and rebranded as the Champions League.\n\nOriginally, the competition was only open to the champions of Europe's domestic leagues, as well as the defending champion of the European Cup.\n\nHowever, in 1997, the league runners-up from Europe's strongest leagues were permitted to enter and then, in 1999, a selection of teams that finished third and fourth in their domestic league competitions were also granted qualification.\n\nFollowing the rebranding of the competition to the Champions League in 1992, the defending champions of the competition did not automatically qualify for the following season's edition. This changed in 2005, allowing the participation of then holders Liverpool.\n\nWho won the most Champions League trophies?\n\nA total of 23 clubs have won the Champions League and/or the European Cup, with Real Madrid lifting the title a record 15 times so far.\n\nAC Milan (seven titles), Bayern Munich (six titles), Liverpool (six titles) and Barcelona (five titles) round out the top five.\n\nSince it was rebranded the UEFA Champions League in 1992/93, the winners have come from the following countries:\n\nSpain (13): Barcelona (4), Real Madrid (9)\n\nEngland (7): Chelsea (2), Liverpool (2), Manchester United (2), Manchester City (1)\n\nItaly (5): AC Milan (3), Inter Milan (1), Juventus (1)\n\nGermany (4): Bayern Munich (3), Borussia Dortmund (1)\n\nFrance (1): Olympique Marseille\n\nNetherlands (1): Ajax\n\nPortugal (1): FC Porto\n\nClubs that won most UEFA Champions League trophies"
