How important is to celebrate others success ❓ Quite a lot. As new investor in the segment of endurance sports, I studied The IRONMAN Group growth case, worth to look at in the realm of sports Here 10 Ironman Group facts: 1️⃣ The IRONMAN Group is the largest operator of mass participation endurance sports in the world. 2️⃣ 1 million participants per year come to the races / events 3️⃣Hundreds of events in +55 countries per year 4️⃣Main target audience: Affluent individuals aged 30-40 years old 5️⃣ Entry fees make up a majority of Ironman’s revenue at +50% 6️⃣ Other revenue streams include sponsors, media rights, merchandising) 7️⃣ Private US group called Advance Publications – which also owns Conde Nast – paid some $730 million to acquire Ironman from Wanda Group in 2020 8️⃣ The Ironman race started Feb. 18, 1978, when 15 competitors descended on Hawaii’s Waikiki Beach to attempt the 2.4-mile swim, 112-mile bike ride and 26.2-mile run. Ironman has since expanded world-wide 9️⃣ Participation fees are between 400 and 600 $ 🔟 Ironman group has been paying royalties through a licensing agreement to Marvel for the association with the famous superheroe Both for the value in the realm of the experience economy and sports tourism, i have been eager to share these facts ❗\n\n❗ Happy to share i have been appointed board member at Danish Startup Group (DSG) 👉 An nonprofit in Copenhagen with +600 members whose mission is to engage members and startup enthusiasts in variety of events, insights and networking opportunities within the Danish startup ecosystem, also to support Danish start-ups through different means ✅ After analysing +500 start-ups over the last 5 years, investing in 9, mentoring and judging in different programs and pitch competitions in USA & Europe, i hope to further contribute and learn from one of the most innovative start-up / innovation ecosystems in the world❗ Thanks Tomas Zhang Mathiesen & Frederik Riber Larsen, and all DSG member for the trust and opportunity❗\n\n👉 Did you know LALIGA is back, more crowded than ever before❓ ✅ All-time record stadium attendances in the 2023/24 season, reaching 16 million spectators. 📈 22% growth compared to the 2013/14 season. 🎟 Record season ticket holder renewals, exceeding 90% as of July 31st. Several drivers of Success: 🥇 On the Pitch: Euro 2024 winners, with 19 players from LALIGA; Olympic gold medal winners (19 players too).

My main strategy is value creation for readers in the sports industry. 🤝On my journey, i have connected / met with other executives alike, whom i admire for sharing my vision or going even further Highly recommmend to connect / follow (in sports). You will learn some stuff: Miguel Ángel Hernández Federico Mari Andrew Petcash Ángel J. Martínez López Alwaleed Alkeaid LinkedIn reached 1 billion users recently, brands selling B2B (like most sports organisations do) started to do paid media on the platform, realizing of the potential of the reach. On the other hand, growing a global community and engage with them is what most sports organization are aiming to do. Followers here don’t engage because of great trips or meals. They do because the content posted is relevant to them/ the industry And i open the debate, what is the future value of the new generation of “corporate influencers”❓ I always encourage everyone to start this journey, the value & growth that generates is endless for your professional career (contacts, convos…) for you, your company, etc."
