        "text": "The Jamaican 'Pocket Rocket' Shelley-Ann Fraser-Pryce will surely go down in history as one of the greatest athletes in history\n\nShelley-Ann Fraser-Pryce is a name that resonates with excellence and speed in the world of athletics. Known as the \"Pocket Rocket,\" she has dominated the track for nearly two decades, leaving an indelible mark on the sport.\n\nAs she nears the end of her illustrious career, fans and sports enthusiasts alike are eager to know more about this iconic sprinter's life, achievements, and future plans.\n\nWho is Shelley-Ann Fraser-Pryce?\n\nJamaican sprinter Shelley-Ann Fraser-Pryce is often called the fastest woman alive and was born on December 27, 1986, in Kingston, Jamaica, in the Waterhouse district, where she was raised by her mother, a former athlete, who provided for the family by being an unlicensed street vendor.\n\nFrom a young age, Fraser-Pryce’s sprinting talent was obvious as she dashed barefoot through primary school. Initially unsure about a career in track and field, her potential was undeniable at Wolmer's High School for Girls, where she sparkled in the Inter-Secondary Schools Boys and Girls Championships, bagging a 100m bronze at just 16.\n\nHer early triumphs included capturing the 200m title at the Jamaican Under-18 Championships in 2002 and helping the Jamaican junior team win gold in the 4 × 100m relay at the Central American and Caribbean Junior Championships.\n\nIn 2006, Fraser-Pryce began attending the University of Technology, Jamaica, where she crossed paths with coach Stephen Francis of the MVP Track Club. Initially, her focus and commitment wavered, but by 2007, she was soaring, placing fifth in the 100m at the Jamaican National Senior Championships with a personal best of 11.31 seconds.\n\nThis performance earned her a spot as a reserve for Jamaica's 4 × 100m relay team at the 2007 Osaka World Championships. Competing on the European athletics circuit that summer, she dazzled with victories at the Budapest Iharos Memorial and the Meeting Terra Sarda in Italy.\n\nFraser-Pryce’s international breakthrough came at the World Championships in September 2007, where she helped Jamaica secure a silver medal in the 4 × 100m relay. This experience not only boosted her confidence but also transformed her approach to athletics, setting the stage for her extraordinary career as one of the world’s fastest women and a multiple Olympic and World Championship medallist.\n\nShelley-Ann Fraser-Pryce’s age, height, and weight\n\nFraser-Pryce, who was born in 1986, is currently 37 years old in August 2024 and will be 38 in December.\n\nShe is one of the most formidable competitors on the track thanks to her explosive speed and powerful sprints. She is 5 feet 0 inches (152 cm) tall and weighs about 52 kg.\n\nShelley-Ann Fraser-Pryce’s career records and achievements\n\nFraser-Pryce has received various distinctions throughout her career. She made history in 2008 when she won the gold medal in the 100 meters at the Beijing Olympics, making history as the first woman from the Caribbean to do so.\n\nIn the 2012 London Olympics, she successfully defended her title, and she has won several World Championships.\n\nShelley-Ann Fraser-Pryce’s major achievements\n\nShelley-Ann Fraser-Pryce’s Olympic Medals\n\n2008 Beijing Games: Gold in 100 metres with a time of 10.78 seconds.\n\n2012 London Games: Gold in 100 metres with a personal best of 10.70 seconds, Silver in 200 metres, and Silver in the 4 × 100-metre relay.\n\n2016 Rio de Janeiro Games: Silver in the 4 × 100-metre relay and Bronze in the 100 metres.\n\n2020 Tokyo Games: Gold in the 4 × 100-metre relay and Silver in the 100 metres.\n\nShelley-Ann Fraser-Pryce’s World Championship medals\n\nBerlin 2009: Gold in 100 metres and 4 × 100-metre relay.\n\nMoscow 2013: Gold in 100 metres, 200 metres, and 4 × 100-metre relay.\n\nBeijing 2015: Gold in 100 metres and 4 × 100-metre relay.\n\nDoha 2019: Gold in 100 metres and 4 × 100-metre relay.\n\nEugene 2022: Gold in 100 metres and Silver in 200 metres and 4 × 100-metre relay.\n\nBudapest 2023: Bronze in 100 metres and Silver in 4 × 100-metre relay.\n\nShelley-Ann Fraser-Pryce’s most notable performances\n\nBeijing 2008: Fraser-Pryce's breakthrough in 2008 was a breath of fresh air in athletics.
