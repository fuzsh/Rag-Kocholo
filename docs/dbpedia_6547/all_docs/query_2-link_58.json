        "text": "Euro 2024 has seen the BBC descend on Germany with a star-studded cast of pundits, commentators and presenters to cover all of the action from the summer's tournament.\n\nThe BBC, along with ITV, have the rights to show Euro 2024 games in the UK, and there are plenty of returning presenters, recognisable pundits and familiar commentators to guide us through the action. There are also some special additions to the team, however, with the BBC also providing extensive radio coverage via 5 Live.\n\nOne notable pundit has already left the coverage, however, with Wayne Rooney returning to England as he prepares for his first season as manager of Plymouth Argyle. Still, that doesn't detract from the quality of the coverage available from the broadcaster in Germany, despite Rooney's expert insight and analysis on games.\n\nThomas Frank is also set for a UK return, with pre-season with Brentford just around the corner. The Dane impressed in his role as pundit in his multiple appearances, offering a deeper perspective on the game.\n\nHere, we run through all the faces (and voices) involved in the tournament this summer...\n\nVIDEO: Why You Finally Saw The REAL England Against Slovenia (For About 2 Minutes)\n\nBBC's Euro 2024 Presenters\n\nGary Lineker\n\nNow in his 25th year as the BBC's football anchor, Gary Lineker leads the coverage of yet another major tournament this summer.\n\nOne of England's all-time leading scorers with 48 goals in 80 caps, the former Tottenham, Barcelona and Everton man turned Match of the Day presenter is the face bringing live coverage of the biggest games on the Beeb at Euro 2024 – including any involving England, and the final, though that's not mutually exclusive.\n\nGabby Logan\n\nA presenter with a wealth of experience across huge sporting events such as the Olympics, World Cup and European Championship, Gabby Logan is a familiar face having been with the broadcaster since 2007. She first started working for BBC during a FA Cup fourth round tie between Luton Town and Blackburn Rovers, and sometimes deputises for Gary Lineker on Match of the Day duty.\n\nThe daughter of Leeds United and Wales legend Terry Yorath, former gymnast Logan anchored the Beeb’s coverage of the 2022 Women’s Euros and 2023 Women's World Cup, too.\n\nMark Chapman\n\nHost of Match of the Day 2 and 5 Live’s Sports Report radio show, Mark Chapman has become a regular fixture on the BBC during major tournaments working as both a reporter and presenter. In addition to his work for BBC, Chapman also leads Sky Sports’ coverage of the Carabao Cup.\n\nChapman has worked outside of football, too, most notably on the BBC's coverage of the Rugby League. The popular Lancastrian headed up The NFL Show between 2016 and 2020 as well.\n\nAlex Scott\n\nArsenal and England favourite Alex Scott only retired from professional football in 2018, but she is already one of the BBC’s most prominent presenters. She became the broadcaster's first female pundit for a men's World Cup when featuring on a panel at Russia in 2018.\n\nSince then she has gone from strength to strength in the media world, covering the 2019 Women's World Cup for the BBC before presenting the same tournament four years later in Australia. Scott also hosts the long-running Football Focus, having taken over from Dan Walker in 2021.\n\nIn addition to her work in football, Scott regularly features as a guest presenter on The One Show and the Sports Personality of the Year Awards.\n\nBBC's Euro 2024 Pundits\n\nDavid Moyes\n\nFresh from being relieved of his duties at West Ham, Moyes will work for the BBC in Germany - though this won't be his first stint doing so. He provided some commentary for BBC Radio 5 Live at the 2010 World Cup.\n\nThe Scottish manager will share his BBC duties with Talksport, having also been announced as part of their co-commentary team for Euro 2024.\n\nJoe Hart\n\nHart only retired from professional football at the end of the season, but his next career path could involve punditry and the media. The 37-year-old featured in four major tournaments for England during his playing career, and will return as part of the BBC team at Euro 2024.\n\nAfter 704 club appearances and 75 international games, Hart ended his playing career at Celtic after winning the Scottish Premiership.\n\nUpon his first appearance for the BBC as a pundit, during England's win over Serbia, Hart's tattoos and posture became a great talking point - not least because the game created much excitement.\n\nAlan Shearer\n\nThe Premier League's all-time top scorer is one of the BBC's most prominent pundits, having covered tournaments for the broadcaster since the 2006 World Cup. He is a regular on their flagship Match of the Day programme, and regularly covers live FA Cup games, too.\n\nHaving scored six goals at Euro 96 on home soil, Shearer won the Golden Boot, helping him provide greater insight into decisions made by the likes of Harry Kane, Cristiano Ronaldo and Kylian Mbappe at Euro 2024.\n\nShearer has also be on co-commentary duty for multiple games in the tournament, including England's opener against Serbia.\n\nFrank Lampard\n\nLampard's last role in football management came a year ago, as interim at Chelsea, so the former England midfielder has been drafted back into punditry by the BBC. Before starting his managerial career at Derby in 2018, Lampard worked for BT Sport as a pundit, as well as for the BBC at the 2018 World Cup.\n\nAfter taking some time off, Lampard made a return to screens as manager of England at Soccer Aid. He is now a regular on the BBC coverage at Euro 2024.\n\nCesc Fabregas\n\nNow the current assistant manager of recently-promoted side Como 1907, Fabregas only retired from football a year ago, in 2023, but he will also be on the screens of the BBC this summer alongside preparing for the Serie A.\n\nThis won't be the first time that Fabregas has worked for the broadcaster, though, having acted as a pundit - to great acclaim and addulation - during the 2018 World Cup.\n\nRio Ferdinand\n\nWhile Ferdinand is a regular pundit for TNT Sports for their Premier League and Champions League coverage, the former Manchester United defender also steps up for the BBC during international tournaments. He played in two World Cups for England, helping contribute to his 81 caps, but failed to play at a European Championship due to multiple different reasons.\n\nHe has also presented documentaries away from football, too.\n\nMicah Richards\n\nWhen he’s not cracking jokes at Roy Keane’s expense on Sky Sports, Micah Richards is just about the BBC’s most enthusiastic pundit, regularly lighting up Match of the Day.\n\nThe ex-England defender – a Premier League and FA Cup winner with Manchester City – has been part of the Beeb’s team at each of the last two major tournaments.\n\nAshley Williams\n\nWales' captain during their successful Euro 2016 run, Williams has since retired and become a prominent figure on the BBC during international tournaments. Indeed, the former centre-back worked for the broadcaster at World Cup 2022, as well as Match of the Day, too.\n\nEllen White\n\nEngland women's record goalscorer, Ellen White won Euro 2022 with the Lionesses before announcing her retirement just a month later. She worked for the BBC at the 2023 Women's World Cup, and is regularly seen covering women's games for different broadcasters during the season.\n\nRachel Corsie\n\nThe captain of the Scotland women's team, Corsie has played 140 times for her nation across a 15-year international career, and is now ready for a first forray into the media.\n\nCorsie has played in Scotland, England, USA and Australia across the course of her career, and played every minute of her nation's 2019 World Cup campaign.\n\nJames McFadden\n\nBest known for his spell in England with Everton and Birmingham City, McFadden also played 48 times for Scotland during his career. Upon retiring in 2018, he moved into coaching, first with Motherwell and then the national team under Alex McLeish.\n\nMcLeish and his staff were relieved of their duties in 2019, though, with McFadden since moving into punditry work north of the border.\n\nGuy Mowbray\n\nThe BBC’s main commentator for more than a decade, Guy Mowbray is the voice of the broadcaster’s FA Cup and international coverage these days.\n\nA mainstay of Match of the Day’s commentary team, while working for Eurosport, Mowbray called the 1998 World Cup final at the age of just 26 – becoming the youngster person ever to do so.\n\nRobyn Cowen\n\nThe lead BBC commentator for the Women's Euro 2022 and Women's 2023 World Cup, Cowen will also be the voice for a number of games at Euro 2024 this summer. She's previously worked for the BBC at Euro 2020, too, and is a regular feature on Match of the Day.\n\nSteve Wilson\n\nOne of the longest-serving commentators at the BBC, Steve Wilson joined the network back in 1998.\n\nAnother of Match of the Day’s main men, Wilson commentated on his first FA Cup final in 2018.\n\nJonathan Pearce\n\nAn instantly recognisable voice, Jonathan Pearce has been commentating on the Beeb since the 90s, covering major men’s and women’s tournaments and featuring prominently on Match of the Day.\n\nAway from football, he’s known for his long stint behind the mic on cult show Robot Wars.\n\nSteve Bower\n\nPart of the BBC’s major tournament commentary team for well over a decade, Steve Bower has covered football from non-League right up to the Champions League.\n\nA presenter of the Premier League’s global output, Bower can regularly be heard on Match of the Day.\n\nVicki Sparks\n\nA regular on the BBC’s women’s football coverage, Vicki Sparks became the first woman to commentate on a World Cup match on UK TV when she held the mic for Portugal vs Morocco at Russia 2018.\n\nSparks – who has also reported from games for Final Score and 5 Live – was nominated for Commentator of the Year at the 2023 Football Supporters’ Association awards.\n\nMartin Keown\n\nThree times a Premier League champion with Arsenal, Martin Keown regularly provides co-commentary and punditry on the Beeb.\n\nCapped 43 times by England, the former defender played in all three of his country’s games at Euro 92.\n\nJermaine Jenas\n\nPundit-cum-presenter Jermaine Jenas does it all these days – from providing analysis on Match of the Day, to presenting BBC evening magazine programme The One Show, to conducting the 2022 World Cup draw!\n\nVoted 2002/03 PFA Young Player of the Year while at Newcastle, the former midfielder lifted the 2007/08 League Cup with Tottenham and earned 21 England caps.\n\nDanny Murphy\n\nRegularly seen on Match of the Day and often heard on talkSPORT, Danny Murphy is one of the BBC’s most established co-commentators.\n\nAn England international on nine occasions, the ex-midfielder was a key member of Liverpool’s 2000/01 FA Cup, League Cup and UEFA Cup-winning side.\n\nBBC's Euro 2024 5 Live Team\n\nStephen Warnock\n\nMurphy’s teammate at Liverpool for a short while, former left-back Stephen Warnock represented England twice.\n\nSince hanging up his boots, he’s worked for a variety of broadcasters in Europe and the USA.\n\nDion Dublin\n\nIf you get to the ground early enough, you might just see Dion Dublin ascending the stairs going up to the gantry.\n\nA popular co-commentator and pundit across Match of the Day and live BBC coverage, Dublin – who earned four England caps – shared the 1997/98 Premier League Golden Boot with Michael Owen and Chris Sutton – and later went on to present property show Homes Under the Hammer AND invent a musical instrument, the Dube.\n\nPat Nevin\n\nEx-Scotland, Chelsea and Everton man Pat Nevin is a familiar voice to listeners of 5 Live, having gone into broadcasting not long after his retirement in 2000.\n\nAlongside his role as a co-commentator, the Scotsman also spent a couple of years as Motherwell CEO, though resigned in 2002 due to financial issues.\n\nIzzy Christiansen\n\nA regular on the Beeb and Sky Sports, Izzy Christiansen earned 31 England caps and won the 2016 Women’s Super League title with Manchester City – having previously lifted the Women’s FA Cup with Birmingham City.\n\nChris Sutton\n\nPartner to Alan Shearer in ‘SAS’ strike force which fired Blackburn Rovers to the 1994/95 Premier League title, Chris Sutton is one of the BBC’s most opinionated pundits and a firm fixture on weekly football phone-in 606.\n\nConor Coady\n\nConor Coady seems a shoo-in to make the move into the media once his playing career finishes, and working for the BBC this summer provides him with a great opportunity.\n\nThe Leicester City defender was included in the England squad as recently as the 2022 World Cup, too, highlighting how he's not even that far removed from Gareth Southgate and his players.\n\nTheo Walcott\n\nNow 35, Walcott called time on his career at the end of last season. This summer will see the former England international come full circle, though, after he first broke onto the scene in 2006 at the World Cup in Germany as a 17-year-old.\n\nWalcott has worked for Sky Sports as a pundit on a number of games before.\n\nClinton Morrison\n\nA pundit for regular pundit for Sky Sports on Soccer Saturday, Morrison also has experience working on Football League Tonight for Channel 5, too. The former striker will work on the BBC's radio coverage this summer, having previously played 36 times for the Republic of Ireland.\n\nPaul Robinson\n\nEngland's No.1 knows what it's like playing for the Three Lions at an international tournament in Germany, having done so at the 2006 World Cup. Now a figure in the media landscape, Robinson has worked for Sky Sports in the years since his retirement.\n\nJose Fonte\n\nJose Fonte knows what it takes to triumph at international level, having done so with Portugal at Euro 2016. The defender is still plying his trade with Braga in his home nation, but will rock up in Germany with the BBC ready to offer an alternative perspective on games this summer.\n\nJen Beattie\n\nBeattie may have moved to NWSL side Bay FC in February, but the Scottish international will return to Europe to provide co-comms at Euro 2024.
