        "text": "The Malta FA will apply to participate in the sixth European Women's Championship qualifiers between 2003 and 2005.\n\nThe Malta national women's team has never taken part in an official international tournament organised by FIFA and/or UEFA so far as the local ladies' football organisation opted to turn to 11-a-side football only a few years ago.\n\nWomen's football is slowly but surely gaining popularity in Europe.\n\nLast May, 34 nations, including minnows Liechtenstein, figured in the fifth UEFA Women's U-19 Championship which was played in Sweden. This tournament started in 1998 with Denmark beating France for the first title. Since then the championship was held regularly, and successfully, each year. Germany won the past two editions.\n\nBetween August 17 and September 1 FIFA will be holding its first U-19 Women's Championship which will be played in Canada.\n\nThe upward trend is reflected in all levels. Recently, 20,302 passed through the turnstiles to watch Sweden's women's national team playing a decisive World Cup 2003 home qualifier against Switzerland.\n\nUEFA's inaugural Women's Cup for clubs was also an instant hit. The final, at the Waldstadion in Frankfurt, attracted more than 12,000 spectators. FFC Frankfurt beat Swedes Umea IK 2-0 to lift the first women's crown last May.\n\nIn Malta, women's football has been around for several seasons now but it was only three years ago that the league competition adopted the European rules and started being played on an 11-a-side basis.\n\nHibernians have dominated the scene lately winning most of the honours at stake even though Birkirkara have proved to be a hard nut to crack for the Paolites. The other teams in the league are Mosta, Melita, Raiders and Rabat Ajax.\n\nNursery boost\n\nThe Malta FA decision to have its national women's team in the European Championship 2005 draw was announced at last Thursday's council meeting which also confirmed a three-month suspension to Senglea defender David Aquilina for doping. The club was fined Lm100.\n\nJoe Mifsud, the MFA president, told delegates UEFA has made available Lm70,000 fund to be distributed to the youth nurseries of local clubs. Each club will receive an amount of money based on the number of teams fielded in Youth FA competitions.\n\nDuring Thursday's council meeting, it was also announced that the MFA's next seminar will focus on three main topics... doping, club licensing and nurseries."
