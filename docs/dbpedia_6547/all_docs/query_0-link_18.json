        "text": "\"Union of European Football Associations\" or UEFA is the administrative body for association football in Europe and Asia. It is one of six continental confederations of world football's governing body FIFA. UEFA represents the national football associations of Europe, runs nation and club competitions including the UEFA European Championship, UEFA Champions League, UEFA Europa League, UEFA Super Cup and controls the prize money, regulations, and media rights to those competitions.\n\nUEFA was founded on 15 June 1954 in Basel, Switzerland after consultation between the Italian, French, and Belgian associations. Initially, the European football union consisted of 25 members which number doubled by the early 1990s. UEFA membership coincides for the most part with recognition as a sovereign country in Europe, although there some exceptions. Some micro states, (e.g. the Vatican City) are not members. Some UEFA members are not sovereign states, but form part of a larger recognised sovereign state in the context of international law. Examples include England and Scotland, (part of the United Kingdom) or the Faroe Islands, (part of Denmark) however in the context of these countries government functions concerning sport tend to be carried at the territorial level coterminous with the UEFA member entity. Some UEFA members are transcontinental states, (e.g. Turkey and Russia). Several Asian countries were also admitted to the European football association, particularly Israel and Kazakhstan, which had been members of the Asian football association. Additionally some UEFA member associations allow teams from outside their association's main territory to take part in their \"domestic\" competition. Monaco, for example, takes part in the French League (though a separate sovereign entity); Welsh clubs Cardiff City and Swansea City participate in the English League; Berwick Rangers, situated in England, play in the Scottish Professional Football League and Derry City, situated in Northern Ireland, play in the Republic of Ireland-based League of Ireland .\n\nUntil 1959 the main headquarters were located in Paris, and later in Bern. Since 1995, UEFA headquarters transferred to Nyon, Switzerland. Henri Delaunay was the first general secretary and Ebbe Schwartz the first president. The current president is Michel Platini.\n\nMembers[edit][]\n\nCode Association National teams Founded FIFA affiliation UEFA affiliation IOC member ALB

Montenegro, which became independent, created its own football association.\n\nCompetitions[edit][]\n\nUEFA runs official international competitions in Europe and some countries of Northern, Southwestern and Central regions of Asia for national teams and professional clubs, known as UEFA competitions, some of them regarded between the world's most prestigious tournaments.\n\nInternational[edit][]\n\nThe main competition for men's national teams is the UEFA European Football Championship, started in 1958, with the first finals in 1960, and known as the European Nations Cup until 1964. It is also called UEFA or the EURO. UEFA also runs national competitions at Under-21, Under-19 and Under-17 levels. For women's national teams, UEFA operates the UEFA Women's Championship for senior national sides as well as Women's Under-19 and Women's Under-17 Championships.\n\nUEFA also organized the UEFA-CAF Meridian Cup with CAF for youth teams. In an effort to boost youth soccer.\n\nUEFA launched the UEFA Regions' Cup, for semi-professional teams representing their local region, in 1999.\n\nIn futsal there is the UEFA Futsal Championship and UEFA Futsal Under-21 Championship.\n\nItalian, German, Spanish and French men's national teams are the sole to have won the European football championship in all categories.\n\nClub[edit][]\n\n[60][61]UEFA member countries by club competition entry entitlements, 2007/8\n\nThe top-ranked UEFA competition is the UEFA Champions League, which started in the 1992/93 season and gathers the top 1–4 teams of each country's league (the number of teams depend on that country's ranking and can be upgraded or downgraded); this competition was re-structured from a previous one that only gathered the top team of each country (held from 1955–92 and known as the European Champion Clubs' Cup or simply the European Cup).\n\nA second, lower-ranked competition is the UEFA Europa League. This competition, for national knockout cup winners and high-placed league teams, was launched by UEFA in 1971 as a successor of both the former UEFA Cup and the Inter-Cities Fairs Cup (also begun in 1955). A third competition, the Cup Winners' Cup, which had started in 1960, was absorbed into the UEFA Cup (now UEFA Europa League) in 1999.\n\nIn women's football UEFA also conducts the UEFA Women's Champions League for club teams. The competition was first held in 2001, and known as the UEFA Women's Cup until 2009.\n\nThe UEFA Super Cup pits the winners of the Champions League against the winners of the UEFA Europa League (previously the winners of the Cup Winners' Cup), and came into being in 1973.[5][6][7]\n\nThe UEFA Intertoto Cup was a summer competition, previously operated by several Central European football associations, which was relaunched and recognized as official UEFA club competition by UEFA in 1995.[8] The last Intertoto Cup took place in 2008.\n\nThe Intercontinental Cup was jointly organised with CONMEBOL between the Champions League and the Copa Libertadores winners.[9]\n\nOnly four teams[10][11] (Juventus, Ajax, Bayern Munich and Chelsea[12]) have won each of the three main competitions (European Cup/UEFA Champions League, UEFA Cup Winner's Cup and UEFA Cup/Europa League),[13] a feat that is no longer possible for any team that did not win the Cup Winners' Cup. There are currently nine teams throughout Europe that have won two of the three trophies; all but one have won the Cup Winners Cup, four require a win in the Champions League and five require a UEFA Europa League win.\n\nJuventus of Italy was the first team in Europe—remaining the only one to date (2013)—to win all UEFA's official championships and cups[14] and, in commemoration of achieving that feat, have received The UEFA Plaque by the Union of European Football Associations on 12 July 1988.[15][16]\n\nUEFA's premier futsal competition is the UEFA Futsal Cup, a tournament started in 2001 which replaced the former Futsal European Clubs Championship. This event, despite enjoying a long and well-established tradition in the European futsal community, dating back to 1984, was never recognized as official by UEFA.\n\n[]\n\nThe UEFA Champions League current main sponsors are:\n\nNissan[17]\n\nGazprom[18]\n\nHeineken (excluding France, Kazakhstan, Russia, Slovenia, and Turkey, where alcohol sponsorship is restricted. In France, Switzerland and some parts of Spain, the Heineken hoarding is replaced by an \"Enjoy responsibly\" or \"open your world\" hoarding, and in Kazakhstan and Russia, the Heineken hoarding is replaced by a \"Respect\" hoarding.[citation needed])\n\nMasterCard\n\nSony Computer Entertainment Europe[19]\n\nPlayStation is the brand advertised.\n\nUniCredit[20]\n\nHTC[21]\n\nThe UEFA Europa League current main sponsors are:\n\nHankook,[22]\n\nWestern Union[23]\n\nSocar\n\nHTC.[24]\n\nAdidas is a secondary sponsor and supplies the official match ball and referee uniform for all UEFA competitions. Konami's Pro Evolution Soccer is also a secondary sponsor as the official Champions League video game.\n\nLeague revenues[edit][]\n\nSee also: List of professional sports leagues by revenue\n\nAnnual revenue comparison.
