The U-19 tournaments featured 12 teams while the last five – including this one – have 16 nations.\n\nU-20 WWC FACTS\n\nWith three first place finishes and 28 wins, four losses and six ties in 38 matches, the USA is second in the FIFA U-20 Women’s World Cup all-time ranking.\n\nWith three titles and 29 wins in 40 matches, Germany tops the Women’s U-20 all-time ranking.\n\nGermany has scored the most goals – 112 in 40 matches – for an impressive average of 2.8 goals per match.\n\nThe 2016 edition in Papua New Guinea will be the eighth FIFA U-20 Women’s World Cup.\n\nThe first two editions of the tournament in 2002 in Canada and 2004 in Thailand were held as U-19 events. The tournament then moved to U-20 in Russia in 2006.\n\nA total of 33 different teams have qualified for at least one of the final competitions, including the two debutants to this year’s tournament: Papua New Guinea and Venezuela.\n\nThe confederation breakdown (2002-2016) of qualifiers: AFC (7), CAF (3), CONCACAF (4), CONMEBOL (6), OFC (2) and UEFA (11).\n\nThe USA, Brazil, Germany and Nigeria are the only teams to have qualified for all of the tournaments at this age level held to date.\n\nThe highest number of goals per match, 3.88, was recorded in the inaugural tournament in Canada in 2002, followed by 3.54 in Thailand in 2004 and 3.53 in Chile in 2008.\n\nThe youngest player to have taken part in this competition is Sydney Leroux (playing for Canada in 2004), when she was just 14 years and 6 months old. She would play in two more U-20 Women’s World Cups for the United States after switching affiliations, and she is the USA’s all-time leading scorer in this tournament with 10 goals.\n\nMexico’s Charlyn Corral is the competition’s youngest goal scorer. She was just 14 years and 11 months when she scored against Switzerland in August 2006.\n\n21 players have taken part in three different editions, but only two managed to score in three different tournaments: Mexico’s Charlyn Corral (2006, 2008, 2010) and New Zealand’s Rosie White (2008, 2010, 2012).\n\nTwo players scored ten goals in one tournament: Germany’s Alexandra Popp in 2010 and Canada’s Christine Sinclair in 2002.\n\nThe attendance record for the FIFA U-20 Women’s World Cup was set in Germany in 2010 as 395,295 fans watched games with an average of 12,353 per match.\n\nTwo World Cup finals have had teams from the same confederation.

Pugh was the youngest player on the 2014 U-20 Women’s World Cup Team, where she started all four games, and is age-eligible to play in the 2018 tournament as well.\n\nPugh currently has 17 caps and four goals for the full WNT, which includes her goal against Colombia in the 2016 Olympics that made her the youngest American soccer player to score in an Olympic Games.\n\nPugh led the team with seven goals and four assists in CONCACAF U-20 qualifying, where she won the Golden Boot as top scorer and the Golden Ball as the best player.\n\nThirteen players on the roster have scored international goals, including Jessie Scarpa (6), Ally Watt (5), Marley Canales (4), Ashley Sanchez (4), Kelsey Hedge (4), and Emily Fox (3).\n\nOf the 20 players who helped the USA win the 2015 CONCACAF U-20 Women’s Championship and qualify for the World Cup last December (a tournament that was held during the college season, making several players unavailable), French chose 13 for the World Cup roster. Those players are: Canales, Chandler, DeMelo, Flores, Fox, Hedge, Heinsohn, Jacobs, Otto, Pugh, Roberts, Sanchez and Scarpa.\n\nThe age cut-off date for this Women’s World Cup is players born on or after Jan. 1, 1996. Eight of the 21 players selected by French were born in 1996, eight were born in 1997, four in 1998 and one in 1999. The four ’98s – DeMelo, Heinsohn, Fox and Pugh, as well as Sanchez, are age-eligible for the 2018 FIFA Under-20 Women’s World Cup in France.\n\nSanchez, who captained the USA at the FIFA Under-17 Women’s World Cup in Jordan while scoring three goals, is the youngest player on the team and the only one born in 1999. Sanchez had three goals with five assists at the CONCACAF U-20 qualifying tournament and scored the game-winning goal in the championship game win against Canada.\n\nFourteen different states are represented, led by California with four players and Virginia with three. New Jersey and Colorado have two each.\n\nNine different colleges are represented on the roster, led by Penn State with five players. Notre Dame and North Carolina each have two players.\n\nThe roster includes five players who helped Penn State win the NCAA Championship in 2015 in defenders Kaleigh Riehl, Madeline Elliston and Ellie Jean, midfielder Emily Ogle, and Rose Chandler, who was a back-up ‘keeper.\n\nJust five players on the roster have yet to start college with the rest having played at least one season so far (aside from Taylor Otto, who has started college but has yet to play a college match). The players who have yet to start college are UCLA commits Mallory Pugh and Ashley Sanchez, goalkeeper Brooke Heinsohn, who is headed to Duke, midfielder Savannah DeMelo (USC) and defender Emily Fox (UNC).\n\nBesides Pugh, two other players were on the 2014 U-20 Women’s World Cup roster in defender Kaleigh Riehl and goalkeeper Rose Chandler, but neither played in the tournament.\n\nChandler earned the Golden Glove as the best goalkeeper during the qualifying tournament and Riehl has been a steady leader of the backline during 2016.\n\nGoalkeepers Casey Murphy and Brooke Heinsohn, who are both 6-foot-1, are the tallest GKs to represent the USA in a Women’s World Cup.\n\nMurphy has played the most games in goal for the USA this year with eight, starting seven, but Chandler has played six times this year, starting four.\n\nForward Julie Doyle out of Laguna Niguel, Calif., who has spent most of her U.S. National Team training time this year with the U-18s, traveled to the World Cup with the USA as an alternate in case of an injury suffered before the tournament. Once the tournament begins, players cannot be replaced.\n\nNine members of the U.S. team that won the 2015 FIFA Women’s World Cup also won a U-20 Women’s World Cup. They are Lori Chalupny, Ashlyn Harris and Heather O’Reilly (2002), Meghan Klingenberg, Sydney Leroux, Alex Morgan and Alyssa Naeher (2008), and Julie Johnston and Morgan Brian (2012). Current U.S. WNT players Samantha Mewis, Kealia Ohai and Crystal Dunn also won a U-20 WWC in 2012.\n\nU.S. U-20 WNT – USA vs. France Pre-Game Quotes\n\nU.S. goalkeeper Casey Murphy\n\nOn getting the World Cup underway:\n\n“The countdown during the final few days has begun and it’s getting a bit harder to sleep at night. We’re just super-pumped, super focused and anxiously awaiting kickoff on the 14th.”\n\nOn facing France:\n\n“We definitely know our first opponent is very skilled, technical and fast, but we feel that we’ve prepared ourselves well by watching a lot of film and playing top teams across this whole cycle. I like where our team is at right now. We feel very confident and united.”\n\nU.S. midfielder Marley Canales\n\nOn getting the World Cup underway:\n\n“It’s a very exciting time for us. We’ve all dedicated a lot of time and effort to our training, on and off the field. There’s a lot of anticipation on the team, but at the same time, I think we’re very calm and ready for the challenges that this tournament will bring. It’s going to be fun.”\n\nU.S. midfielder Katie Cousins\n\nOn the honor of representing the USA in the World Cup:\n\n“It’s an amazing opportunity that we’ve all earned, just to be on this team. It’s a chance to try to accomplish something great with your best friends and that’s a unique experience. We’re so honored to represent the USA in Papua New Guinea and I know everyone will do it with class and huge heart.”\n\nBY THE NUMBERS\n\n1.30 Goals allowed per international match by the U.S. U-20s this year\n\n2.50 Goals scored per international match by the U.S. U-20s this year\n\n7 Goals scored by Mallory Pugh in CONCACAF qualifying to lead the team\n\n8 U-19/U-20 Women’s World Cups for which the USA has qualified\n\n23 Career U-20 caps for Mallory Pugh, the most on this Women’s World Cup roster\n\n31 Players to see action in a U.S. U-20 international match this year\n\n25 Goals scored by the USA in 10 international matches this year\n\n810 Minutes played in international matches this year by Kaleigh Riehl, most on the team\n\nIN FOCUS: FRANCE\n\nFédération Française de Football\n\nHead Coach: Gilles Eyquem\n\nBest FIFA U-20 Women’s World Cup Finish (sixth appearance): Third Place (2014)\n\nUSA VS.

All three losses have come to Germany (in the semifinal in 2004, in group play in 2012 and in group play in 2010), but the USA has also beaten Germany three times in this tournament (in the semifinal in 2002, in the quarterfinal in 2006, and in the final in 2012).\n\nFRANCE ROSTER\n\nGOALKEEPERS (3): 1-Mylene Chavas (AS Saint-Etienne), 16-Cindy Perrault (ASPTT Albi), 21-Jade Lebastard (En Avant Guingamp)\n\nDEFENDERS (7): 2-Marion Romanelli (Montpellier HSC), 3-Sakina Karchaoui (Montpellier HSC), 4-Hawa Cissoko (Paris Saint-Germain FC), 5-Pauline Dhaeyer (ESOF La Roche-sur-Yon), 12-Heloise Mansuy (FC Metz), 13-Thea Greboval (FCF Juvisy), 14-Estelle Cascarino (FCF Juvisy)\n\nMIDFIELDERS (5): 6-Laura Condon (ASPTT Albi), 8-Onema Geyoro (Paris Saint-Germain FC), 15-Maelle Garbino (AS Saint-Etienne), 17-Juliane Gathrat (FC Metz), 19-Cathy Couturier (Rodez Aveyron Football)\n\nFORWARDS (6): 7-Delphine Cascarino (Olympique Lyonnais), 9-Marie-Charlotte Leger (Montpellier HSC), 10-Clara Mateo (FCF Juvisy), 11-Louise Fleury (En Avant Guingamp), 18-Valerie Gauvin (Montpellier HSC), 20-Anna Clerac (ASJ Soyaux)\n\nFRANCE ROSTER NOTES\n\nFrance has appeared regularly at the FIFA U-20 Women’s World Cup, playing in five of the seven tournaments to date. Les Bleuettes’ greatest achievement came during their last appearance at Canada 2014 where they claimed third place by defeating Korea DPR 3-2, after having suffered a 2-1 semifinal loss to Germany.\n\nFrance had taken part in the third-place match once before at Chile 2008 where it lost to Germany (5-3). France lost to the North Koreans in the semifinal that year by a 2-1 score.\n\nFrance got to the semifinal of the 2015 UEFA Women’s U-19 Championship, which served as the qualifying tournament for this World Cup, falling in the semifinal to Spain. France won all three games in the first round – beating Sweden (1-0), Denmark (1-0) and host Israel (4-0) – to top the group and earn a berth to PNG, but then lost in penalty kicks to Spain after a 1-1 draw during regulation time.\n\nIn the semifinal against Spain, France opened the scoring through Marie-Charlotte Leger but conceded an equalizer a few minutes later, the first goal they had conceded in the competition. The match finished 1-1, but a cruel climax lay in store for the French, as Leger, her country’s top scorer at the tournament, missed from the spot during the ensuing penalty shoot-out and handed victory to the Spaniards.\n\nLeger also scored against Denmark and the French benefited from a fifth minute own goal against Sweden. Against Israel, Clara Mateo, Noémie Carage, Juliane Gathrat and Leger scored.\n\nFrance is also the reigning UEFA Women’s U-19 Champions, winning the 2016 tournament played in Slovakia while using 12 players that are on its current 2016 U-20 Women’s World Cup roster.\n\nIn the championship game, France defeated Spain (to whom it had lost in the semifinal the year before), 2-1, in a match that was interrupted by a massive rainstorm. Marie-Antoinette Katoto and Grace Geyoro scored for France.\n\nFrance actually lost its first game of the 2016 U-19 Women’s Euros, falling 1-0 to Norway, but rebounded with a 6-0 win over Slovakia on a hat trick from Katoto in a span of 19 minutes, as well as single goals from Clara Mateo, Perle Morroni and Delphine Cascarino. France then beat the Netherlands 2-1 on a goal from Katoto and a penalty from Geyoro to top the group.\n\nIn the semifinal, France defeated Switzerland 3-1 on two goals from Mateo and one from Katoto before taking down Spain in the championship game.\n\nKatoto, who lead the tournament with six goals, was injured before the World Cup and is not on France’s roster.\n\nWith 11 victories from 22 matches played in this tournament, France are one of six teams that have won at least half of the U-20 Women’s World Cup matches they have contested. The only sides with a better win percentage are USA (73.6% per cent), Germany (72.5%), Korea DPR (65.3%) and Japan (52.9%), whereas Sweden are equal with Les Bleuettes on 50.0%.\n\nIn each of their last four U-20 Women’s World Cup campaigns, France faced the eventual champions and were defeated each time: 2-1 by Korea DPR in the 2006 quarterfinals, 3-0 by USA in the group round in 2008, 4-1 by Germany at the same stage of the 2010 edition and 2-1, again by Germany, in the semifinal two years ago.\n\nFrance won the 2012 FIFA U-17 Women’s World Cup in Azerbaijan, which is France’s only FIFA women’s championship to date.\n\nLAST TIME\n\nOn the field for the USA in an international match:\n\nOctober 10, 2016 – Omni Hotel & Resort at ChampionsGate\n\nInternational Friendly\n\nUSA 5 Petersen 7; Ogle 11; Pugh 56; Hedge 64; Jacobs 85\n\nVEN 1 Canas 54\n\nLineups:\n\nUSA: 1-Casey Murphy (22-Rose Chandler, 46); 14-Ellie Jean, 3-Kaleigh Riehl, 25-Taylor Otto (19-Natalie Jacobs, 46), 4-Sabrina Flores (2-Maddie Elliston, 46) 8-Courtney Petersen ,16-Emily Fox (17-Kelcie Hedge, 46), 24-Parker Roberts (13-Marley Canales, 24) 9-Mallory Pugh (capt.)
