        "text": "I've been thinking a lot about the quality of some of the teams left out of major competitions so I decided to put pen to paper and look at what a 64 team world cup would look like.\n\nI'm assuming they would go with 16 groups.\n\nFirst, You double the groups therefore doubling the number of groupstage games. More of these could be played concurrently so the timeframe wouldn't really need to be expanded. This would require more venues however. Poorer nations might not be able to host. South Africa probably wouldn't have gotten the bid under this system.\n\nIn terms of total number of games. Each group plays 6 matches in a four team round robin. 6x8 = 24 games at present. Doubling it obviously means there would be 48 group stage matches. From there you have 32 teams in the knockout stage which means 32 matches. Each team is eliminated once and a 3rd place match is played.\n\nRather than 64 games at the world cup you would be looking at 80 matches. Not that many more assuming I did my math right.\n\nIn terms of alocated spots. We wouldn't see the Netherlands sitting at home on the couch as in '02. To stay with the current pace of UEFA getting just under half of the seeds I estimate they would get about 27 spots. My recommendation would be to give them 24 spots and have three teams play a playoff against another confederation. The top seeded team could play OFC's winner. UEFA's 26th and 27th could play CONMEBOL's 10th and 9th.\n\nSo:\n\nUEFA - 24 spots & 3 playoffs\n\nCONMBEOL - 8 spots & 2 playoffs\n\nOFC - 1 playoff spot\n\n- UEFA 25th vs OFC 1st\n\n- UEFA 26th vs CONMEBOL 10th\n\n- UEFA 27th vs CONMEBOL 9th\n\nCONCACAF - 7 spots\n\nAFC - 8 spots\n\nCAF - 13 spots\n\nNumbers could be adjusted with more intercontinental playoffs to decide the exact number that gets to go.\n\nThe teams I had in mind when I came up with these numbers are listed below. Teams in () are the teams I expected might get a playoff spot. Of course there is no way to know unless the games were actually played.\n\nBrazil, Argentina, Paraguay, Uruguay, Ecuador, Chile, Peru, Colombia, (Bolivia), (Chile)\n\nItaly, France, Spain, Netherlands, Germany, Portugal, Czech Republic, Croatia, England, Turkey, Romania, Scotland, Bulgaria, (Denmark), Greece, Ireland, Northern Ireland, Israel, Norway, Poland, Russia, Serbia, (Slovakia), Switzerland, Sweden, Ukraine, (Wales)\n\n(New Zealand)\n\nUSA, Mexico, Canada, Costa Rica, Guatemala, Honduras, Jamaica\n\nIran, Japan, Korea Republic, Australia, Korea Republic, China, Qatar, Uzbekistan\n\nAngola, Ghana, Cote d'Ivoire, Cameroon, Nigeria, Senegal, Tunisia, Mali, Egypt, Congo DR, Guinea, Morocco, South Africa\n\nAnyway, I fully understand that FIFA isn't likely to do this any time soon. Maybe years down the road. But I thought I would throw the thought out there and see what people thought of the idea.\n\nThey had talked about going to 36 teams or something but it really wouldn't make a difference in my opinion.\n\nDiscuss!\n\nFirst of all, I told glennaldo_sf to present an arguement in his post. You hadn't posted yet. You'll notice I quoted him.\n\nI agree there would be less drama in Europe. But I also believe there are more than 13 teams in europe capable of competing at the world cup and many are eliminated by FIFA's choice to limit their spots. In a 32 team tournament 13 is about the highest they could be awarded fairly though. I'm more concerned about the African nations who are eliminated by simple math.\n\nYou can call asia weak all you like but Iran, Australia, Saudi Arabia, Korea Republic, Japan are all stronger nations than they are given credit for. If you look at 5 spots awarded to asian teams 2 of them reached the knockout stages since 2002, One reached the semifinals and while Saudi Arabia and Iran didn't have the greatest cups in the last couple of years, they are coming along and more world cup appearances creates better teams.\n\nI have no idea what you are talking about in your third arguement. Of course I mentioned you could keep the time frame identical to the 32 team tournament and double the number of matches played per day. So instead of 2 matches we would see 4.\n\nAs far as your fourth arguement. I would have thought the idea would be to have the best two teams play each other in the final. But that doesn't always happen no matter how much planning you do.\n\nSo... Egypt, Ghana, Cote d'Ivoire, Senegal, Cameroon, Nigeria, Guinea and Morocco, Tunisia could all qualify for the same world cup? If there are 9 teams that are of a high enough quality to compete at the world cup it is FIFAs decision to leave 3 or 4 of them at home. 8 deserving teams are forced to compete for only 5 spots.\n\nYou could say that is the case now. Of course with any sport the majority of attention is shown in the later stages. How many Americans don't watch the NFL but always sit down for the super bowl?\n\nThe fanatics will follow all of the games. The leisurely viewer would watch as they pleased and would be as likely to miss a great game with 32 or 64 teams.\n\nThat's a fair arguement. But it also depends on the region. Africa would be much more entertaining I believe with a few more spots to play for. It's a very deep continent. CONMEBOL and UEFA wouldn't be as thrilling but I think it would be a bit more fair.\n\nI always believe that Guatemala would be a very interesting appearance in the world cup. I don't like their style. I think in many cases they are just out to hurt somebody but you have to admit, it makes the game tougher to play and it's something that the world cup hasn't really seen. We know teams like Trinidad and Tobago can play in the world cup. Jamaica is good enough and with more world cup appearances they would see more players in more european leagues which ultimately increases a nations ability.\n\nCanada has a very strong team with a sturdy midfield and pretty good strikers. Their are a few holes on the team but they are certainly good enough.\n\n------------------------------------------------\n\nThe other arguement I wanted to make here is this. Rather than picking exactly how many teams from each continent belong in the world cup finals. Let them play and decide for themselves. This is the idea with the awarding of half a spot. But I think more places than that could be contested.\n\nWhat if, in a 32 team tournament:\n\nUEFA was awarded 7 automatic spots. with 7 playoff spots\n\nCONMEBOL was awarded 3 Automatic spots with 5 playoff spots\n\nCONCACAF was awarded 2 automatic spots with 2 playoff spots\n\nAFC was awarded 3 automatic spots with 4 playoff spots\n\nOFC was awarded 1 playoff spot\n\nCAF was awarded 4 automatic spots with 5 playoff spots\n\nThat gives you 19 automatic spots going to the best of the best in each region. Then, with 24 playoff spots and 12 remaining places at the world cup you allow the teams to prove that they belong at the world cup rather than just assuming that the 12th best team in Europe is more deserving than the 6th best in Africa.\n\nEurope would have to prove they are more deserving of all of the spots they recieve and would have the potential to gain a few more. They could in theory send 14 teams. But this way Africa would have the chance to prove that they deserve to send up to 9 teams.\n\nPerhaps this is a better solution than simply expanding the tournament.\n\n64 is too much. if they would ever expand WC, which i can't see in a long time, they'd do it one of two ways: 40 teams (8 groups of 5 teams [the most likely scenario due to only a 25% increase in number of teams]), or 48 teams (12 groups of 4 teams or 8 groups of 6).\n\nin a 40 team system they'd give OPL one guaranteed spot, give uefa one or two more, concacaf 4, 1 more to africia, and they'd have a bit more extra qualification between confederations. anyways to the tourny, they'd have 5 teams instead of 4, increasing the length of the tournament to 3 more days. having one more team would make it a lot more interesting. a stumble early would allow a team to come back, and the power houses of the world would have a more difficult time advancing, making sure the best of the best 16 would advance. very few though teams like turkey would advance into knock-out rounds. that's the only downside.\n\nin a 48 team system just keep giving away spots to confederations. even at 48, instead of 64, if you're somewhat average, you're in unless you F up bad. more feel good countries would be into the tourny, which is a good thing. as far as the tourney, 12 groups of 4 means we'd have to have a weird setup though. either we'd play it like normal till knockout, 24 teams advance, with the best 8 teams in regards to points (than goal differental, than fifa rankings) get a 'bye' into the second round, and they join the other 16 teams (the 8 who advanced) in the 2nd round, and it would start off like a normal knock-out setup. this is a really unlikely scenario however. it be too much BS and unfair if a country got into a shit group and went 9 points and went +10 GD.\n\nif it expands it will be 40 teams. i can't see 64, unless we start seeing england, spain, germany, italy, france, us, mexico, brazil, argentina, to start severally strugling to get into WC, if missing it all completely. first time we see brazil/argentina, us/mexico, and 2 super powers from uefa missing the tourny in the same year, is when we'll expand it to 40 teams to make sure it never ever happens again.\n\nnot a bad idea though with 64 teams. its just that way too many teams for WC, only a handful of countries could host it unless they change their rules with venues. and it wouldn't be that good for the game.\n\nSince 1990, 14 non-host AFC teams (excluding 2006 Australia) have played 43 games they have 4 wins 8 ties and 31 loses that's a winning percentage of 18.6% (no other Confederations is below 34%) and a GD of -69. I would call that a weak performance.\n\nSo you think that AFC teams have done better in the last three WC (since the expansion to 32 teams)?\n\nThe 10 non-host teams (again without Australia) have played 30 games and they have 2 wins 6 ties and 22 loses, winning percentage of 16.7% (again, no other confederation is below 34%) and a GD of -53 (that's -1.77/game!).\n\nLast two WCs?\n\nThe 6 non-hosts (still, no Australia) have played 18 games with 1 win, 4 ties and 13 loses winning percentage of 16.7% (still, no other confederation is below 34%) and a GD of -36 (-2.00/game!)\n\nEven if we add Australia we get (over the last two WCs), 7 non-hosts, 22 games, 2 wins, 5 ties, 22 loses, winning percentages on 20.5% and a GD of -37. Better than before, but still much worse than any other confederation's non-hosts performance.\n\nOut of all these teams, only Australia (2006, qualified via OFC and a playoff with CSF) and Saudi Arabia (1994) have advanced out of the group stage. On the other hand , 10 of the 14 non-host teams (15 if you include Australia) have finished the group stage either last and win-less or 3rd with a single point.\n\nAll these teams might be \"stronger nations than they are given credit for\", but with the exception of Australia (1 WC), their overall WC performance has been poor.\n\nWe all believe (I think) that CAF has great potential and deserving teams. But for some reason, as a whole, they under performed. Based on what? in the last 3 WCs CAF had 15 teams, the expected performance is for 7.5 to advance and about 3.75 teams to finish last and win-less or 3rd with a single point (actual is 23/96 so for 15 teams we would expect 3.59). How well did CAF do? 3 teams advanced (less than 1/2 the expected value) and 6 had the poor performance (about 2/3 more than the expected value).\n\nDid CAF had strong teams left behind? Maybe/probably, but that should be fixed by changing the CAF qualification format, not by adding more spots. BTW, over the same time period, CONCACAF had the same percentage (40%) of poor performing teams, but CONCACAF had twice as high a percentage of teams advancing (40% vs. 20%), the over winning percentage is (35.7% for CAF and 34.3% for CONCACAF; last two WC is about reversed 34.8% vs. 36%) . I don't think that there is anyway to justify more spots for CONCACAF and on the field they not done any worse than CAF.\n\nI agree with the concept that the intercontinental playoffs is a better solution. However, I don't like the distribution at all. In effect your suggestion has done the following:\n\nUEFA: 7+7/2 - 13 = -2.5 spots\n\nCSF: 3+5/2 - 4.5 = +1 spot\n\nCONCACAF: 2+2/2 - 3.5 = -0.5 spot\n\nAFC: 3+4/2 - 4.5 = +0.5 spot\n\nOFC: 0+1/2 -0.5 = 0 spots\n\nCAF: 4+5/2 - 5 = +1.5 spots\n\nI can understand CSF getting one more \"spot\". I could also see why CONCACAF should lose a 0.5 spot. I find it hard to understand (based on objective criteria) what has CAF done to earn an extra 1.5 spots. There is no WC based data to show that their teams have meaningfully outperformed CONCACAF teams (their is data to support CONCACAF has out performed CAF in the last 2,3,4,5 WCs).\n\nThe worst recommendation is UEFA. In the WC UEFA teams have consistently advanced more about 2/3 of their teams and had only about 1 in 10 teams finish last and win-less or 3rd with a single point. UEFA has earned more than its 13 WC spots (same number they had in 1990 and 1994 when the WC was only 24 teams), it is only politics that have taken spots away from it. At the very least restore UEFA to its 2002 position (14.5 = 10+9/2; yes, I know it was 1+13+0.5). I could even understand a 10+12/2 or 11+11/2; if 6 of UEFA's 2nd tier teams can beat the ROW teams 11-21 teams then UEFA earned having more than 1/2 the WC teams."
