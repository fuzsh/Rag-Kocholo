The march marks the USA’s first step towards qualification for the 2020 FIFA U-20 Women’s World Cup, to be played this summer in Costa Rica and Panama. The U-20 WNT continues Group C play on Monday, Feb. 24 vs. host Dominican Republic (3 p.m. ET) and wraps up the group stage on Wednesday, Feb. 26 vs. Honduras (6 p.m. ET).\n\nAll of the USA’s Group C matches will be played at Estadio Olimpico Felix Sanchez in Santo Domingo, capital of the Dominican Republic. Follow the U-20 WNT throughout the tournament on ussoccer.com as well as U.S. Soccer Facebook, Twitter and Instagram.\n\n2020 Concacaf Women’ Women’s U-20 Championship\n\nGroup C Schedule - USA\n\nDate\n\nMatch\n\nKickoff (ET)\n\nTV Info\n\nVenue\n\nFeb. 22\n\nUSA vs. Cuba\n\n3:00 p.m.\n\nConcacaf Go, TUDN, Concacaf Facebook, Concacaf YouTube\n\nEstadio Olimpico Felix Sanchez; Santo Domingo, Dominican Republic\n\nFeb. 24\n\nUSA vs. Dominican Republic\n\n3:00 p.m.\n\nConcacaf Go, TUDN, Concacaf Facebook, Concacaf YouTube\n\nEstadio Olimpico Felix Sanchez; Santo Domingo, Dominican Republic\n\nFeb. 26\n\nUSA vs. Honduras\n\n6:00 p.m.\n\nConcacaf Go, TUDN, Concacaf Facebook, Concacaf YouTube\n\nEstadio Olimpico Felix Sanchez; Santo Domingo, Dominican Republic\n\nWATCH U-20 WNT QUALIFYING: The 2020 Concacaf Women’s U-20 Championship will be streamed on Concacaf Go app and TUDN as well as via Concacaf Facebook and YouTube. Concacaf Go is accessible in the Concacaf app, available for download in the App Store and Google Play Store.\n\nTOURNAMENT FORMAT: This year marks the 10th edition of the Concacaf Women’s U-20 Championship. The tournament began in 2002 as the CONCACAF Women’s U-19 Championship.\n\nThe year’s tournament features a new 20-team format after all previous tournaments were comprised of eight teams in two groups of four. This year, sixteen countries have been drawn into four groups of four, while four countries advanced directly to the Round of 16 via a pre-qualifying tournament. The top three finishers in each group will qualify to the Round of 16, where they will be joined by the four teams from the pre-qualifying tournament. From there, it’s a knockout bracket to the tournament final. The two winners of the semifinal matches will qualify to the 2020 FIFA Under-20 Women’s World Cup.\n\nThis year’s Concacaf Women’s U-20 Championship will only send two teams to the FIFA U-20 Women’s World Cup, rather than the usual three, due to the World Cup being played in the Concacaf region and hosts Costa Rica and Panama both receiving automatic bids.\n\nGOING FOR SIX: The USA has won five Concacaf championships at this level, including four of the last five. The first tournament, held in 2002, did not produce a champion as the two group winners advanced to the first FIFA U-19 Women’s World Cup without semifinals or a championship game being played. The USA then won five of the next eight tournaments, losing the final to Canada in 2004 and 2008 and to Mexico in 2018. The USA has advanced to the final at every tournament that has held one, facing Canada five times and Mexico three times. This year, the U.S. will look to win its first title since 2015 after falling to Mexico in a penalty kick shootout in 2018.\n\nSUCCESS IN U-20 QUALIFYING: The USA has put together a 37-2-4 record all-time at this tournament. After racking up some big goal-scoring numbers during the early days of the competition, the U.S. has scored 255 goals in its nine appearances at the tournament, while allowing just 17. Last year’s tournament was the USA’s tightest test yet in the region as the team faced three tough matches to finish the group stage with nine points before edging Haiti on a penalty kick shootout to clinch its World Cup berth.\n\nThe U.S. has qualified for all nine FIFA U-20 Women’s World Cups that have been contested, winning the tournament in 2002, 2008 and 2012.\n\nLAUNCHING PAD TO FULL WNT: Many of the players who have scored for the USA in this tournament have gone on to become familiar WNT call-ups. Lindsay Tarpley, Heather O’Reilly, Leslie Osborne, Megan Rapinoe, Yael Averbuch, Rachel Buehler (now Van Hollebeke), Amy Rodriguez, Allie Long, Lauren Cheney (now Holiday), Kelley O’Hara, Alex Morgan, Meghan Klingenberg, Sydney Leroux, Kristie Mewis, Lindsey Horan, Julie Johnston (now Ertz), Morgan Brian, Mallory Pugh and Andi Sullivan have all scored in this competition and gone on to earn caps with the full WNT. Most recently, Tierna Davidson scored the USA’s lone goal in the 2018 tournament final before moving on to the senior WNT in full.\n\nCurrent WNT players Crystal Dunn and Samantha Mewis also represented the USA through two U-20 cycles. Fourteen of the players listed above have played for the USA in a Women’s World Cup at the senior level. Nine helped the WNT take home the 2019 FIFA Women’s World Cup.\n\nQUALIFIED TO COSTA RICA/PANAMA: More than half of the field for the 16-team 2020 FIFA U-20 Women’s World Cup is already set. In addition to hosts Costa Rica and Panama, France, Germany, Netherlands and Spain have qualified from Europe, New Zealand has punched its ticket from Oceania and Japan, Korea DPR and Korea Republic have clinched their berths from Asia. In addition to the two bids awarded at the 2020 Concacaf Women’s U-20 Championship, two teams each will qualify from Africa and South America this spring/summer.\n\nRUN-UP TO DR: The U-20 WNT enters World Cup qualifying after facing a collection of the world’s top teams throughout 2019, topping the likes of Sweden, Germany, and Japan. The USA closed out the year with an exciting run at the 2019 Nike International Friendlies, finishing the tournament with a 2-1 win over France on goals from midfielder Alexa Spaanstra and forward Trinity Rodman.\n\nThe timing of the 2020 Concacaf Women’s U-20 Championship at the start of the year after the college season made the player selection process less difficult. Fifteen of the 20 players on the roster are currently in college while three are playing for youth clubs. Forward Sophia Smith is the sole professional on the roster after she was drafted by the Portland Thorns last month, becoming the first teenager to be taken No. 1 overall in the NWSL College Draft. Midfielder Talia DellaPeruta is currently playing as an amateur in Germany with Frauen-Bundesliga club FC Koln.\n\nPlayers born on or after Jan. 1, 2000 are eligible for the 2020 U-20 Women’s World Cup and head coach Laura Harvey named players from three birth years: 12 players born in 2000, five born in 2001 and three born in 2002. The roster features two of the last three U.S. Soccer Young Female Players of the Year in Smith (2017) and midfielder Brianna Pinto (2019).\n\n2020 Concacaf Women’s U-20 Championship Roster by Position (College or Club; Hometown; U-20 Caps/Goals)\n\nGOALKEEPERS (2): Claudia Dickey (UNC; Charlotte, N.C.; 0/0), Julia Dohle (Penn State; Scarsdale, N.Y.; 6/0)\n\nDEFENDERS (7): Maycee Bell (UNC; Wichita, Kan.; 4/1), Sierra Enge (Stanford; Cardiff, Calif.; 0/0), Naomi Girma (Stanford; San Jose, Calif.; 25/0), Shae Holmes (Washington; Highlands Ranch, Colo.; 2/0), Brianna Martinez (Notre Dame; Albuquerque, N.M.; 4/0), Emily Mason (PDA; Flemington, N.J.; 2/0), Kennedy Wesley (Stanford; Rossmoor, Calif.; 0/0)\n\nMIDFIELDERS (6): Talia DellaPeruta (Köln/GER; Cumming, Ga.; 4/0), Katelyn Duong (Minnesota; Portland, Ore.; 3/0), Jenna Nighswonger (Florida State; Huntington Beach, Calif.; 4/1), Brianna Pinto (UNC; Durham, N.C.; 32/4), Alexa Spaanstra (Virginia; Brighton, Mich.; 13/2), Summer Yates (Washington; Pasco, Wash.; 4/2)\n\nFORWARDS (5): Mia Fishel (UCLA; San Diego, Calif.; 0/0), Rebecca Jarrett (Virginia; Clifton, N.J.; 5/0), Samantha Meza (Solar Soccer Club; Dallas, Texas; 7/1), Trinity Rodman (SoCal Blues SC; Newport Beach, Calif.; 2/1), Sophia Smith (Portland Thorns; Highlands Ranch, Colo.; 27/23)\n\nROSTER NOTES:\n\nDefender Sierra Enge makes her first U-20 WNT roster appearance of the 2019-20 cycle.

Alex Morgan also scored.\n\nCuba qualified to the group stage as the 14th-ranked team in the Concacaf Women’s Under-20 rankings.\n\nCuba has called seven players born in 2000, seven born in 2001, four born in 2002 and two born in 2003 to the Dominican Republic.\n\nAll 20 of Cuba’s players are based domestically in Cuba.
