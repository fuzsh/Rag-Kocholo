        "text": "England men’s senior and development teams will kick off their 2024 campaign later this month with some mouthwatering clashes.\n\nGareth Southgate’s senior side host the two countries just below them in the FIFA Rankings, with Brazil (5th) and Belgium (4th) visiting Wembley Stadium connected by EE in a matter of days, as the Three Lions step up their preparations for UEFA EURO 2024 in Germany.\n\nLee Carsley’s Under-21s will be hoping to defend their European crown in Slovakia next year. To do so, they first need to qualify, and the Young Lions will travel to Azerbaijan before welcoming Luxembourg to Bolton Wanderers’ Toughsheet Community Stadium – adult tickets are just £15 (£10 for BWFC season ticket holders and members) and £7.50 for concessions and under-18s (£5 for BWFC ST holders and members).\n\nEngland EURO Elite League Squad, who were formerly the MU20s and contains players born in 2002, 2003 and 2004, will be on the road for both of their games, as they head to Poland and Czechia.\n\nThe MU19s will be heading to North Africa for games against hosts Morocco and the USA, while the MU18s become the latest Young Lions side to utilise the Pinatar Arena in Spain for a trio of games against Czechia, Germany and the Netherlands."
