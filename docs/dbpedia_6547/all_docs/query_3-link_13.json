        "text": "HOST CITY: Does the location of an event have a big impact on infrastructure requirements?\n\nMartin Kallen: We would like it to be similar all the time – that would be easier for us, but wherever you go it’s different.\n\nOf course we have our criteria and documents we provide to stadiums and organisers to ensure that they meet certain standards. The standards are getting more even.\n\nHowever they are still different in terms of the size and quality of infrastructure. Some have better broadcasting facilities, better hospitality facilities or better technical facilities.\n\nHOST CITY: How does France compare with Poland and Ukraine in terms of event infrastructure?\n\nMartin Kallen: We have 10 stadiums in France, four of which are brand new, 1 existing Stade de France and five refurbished stadiums. If you go to Parc de Princes, they have rebuilt all the hospitality zones, business seats, kiosks, technical area and refreshed the sanitary areas. The remaining seats will be soon replaced.\n\nLyon is a completely new stadium. Lens is in principle a rebuild, with the construction of a new roof, hospitality and technical area, replacement of seats, etc. Saint-Etienne is a rebuild as well – it’s almost a new stadium on the old foundations.\n\nBordeaux is a new stadium and Toulouse made an upgrade of the existing facilities as seating area, kiosks and access control system.\n\nIf you compare this to Poland and Ukraine, most of the stadiums there were new buildings, with one or two exceptions.\n\nIn Poland, Poznan was a rebuild, but almost the whole stadium was rebuilt. All the other stadiums - Warsaw, Gdansk, Wroclaw - were new.\n\nIn Ukraine you had three new stadiums: Donetsk was finished two years earlier for the club FC Shakhtar Donetsk. Kharkiv was similar to Saint-Etienne, where they rebuilt the stadium on old foundations.\n\nFrance is further ahead at this stage in terms of finishing – the infrastructure of most of the stadiums is now delivered. The last one Lyon, will be finished by the end of this year, whereas in Ukraine and Poland a lot of the stadiums were delivered in the last year and two close to the start of the tournament.\n\nIn terms of quality, a brand new stadium is much more modern than the one already existing. New stadiums in Ukraine and Poland are similar to the new stadiums in France.\n\nIt is difficult to compare a rebuilding with a new stadium. You always have some challenges because there is a link to the foundations of the stadium, access and so on. If they were built in the seventies, eighties, it’s not the same as today.\n\nHOST CITY: What opportunities are there for event infrastructure suppliers in France?\n\nMartin Kallen: On the overlay side, we are now doing the last tenders. All the suppliers have put their tenders in. It’s now coming almost to an end, because the work will start next year but the tendering process is taking place now.\n\nOn the stadium side, all the suppliers were chosen by the stadiums because, except Lyon, the last ones will be delivered by this summer.\n\nHOST CITY: What are the main criteria in choosing a supplier for a UEFA event?\n\nMartin Kallen: One is of course their knowledge – they need to have experience. Secondly, they need to have state of the art, products and services.\n\nThey also need to be sustainable. This means that what they are putting in also needs to be taken away and recycled, or ideally reused in a different form; and when it comes to waste management, that it’s not all going in the garbage – it needs to be sorted or treated. The more it can be reused, the better is the sustainability of the product.\n\nWhat is also important is the price. It doesn’t always need to be the cheapest price, but it needs to be a good balance between quality and cost.\n\nTaxes in different countries are always a challenge for suppliers, because they have to establish daughter companies, to recover VAT etc.\n\nFor us, the suppliers are very important for the events, as they are in principle specialists in many areas.\n\nThrough the Association of Global Event Suppliers (AGES), they can exchange their knowledge, information, issues, problems, challenges and best practice – this is a very good initiative.\n\nHOST CITY: How will EURO 2020 differ in terms of event infrastructure?\n\nMartin Kallen: The first big difference is that infrastructure in most of the countries is already ready.\n\nWe have only two locations where a new stadium will be built; one in Budapest and one in Brussels.\n\nThe other stadiums are already state of the art. We have to put on the EURO overlay; we will start working heavily with the stadium from approximatively 2018.\n\nThe overlay required for a big event is mainly for broadcasting and media facilities; then it’s hospitality, commercial facilities and all areas which will be either inside existing stadium premises or temporary facilities built outside. But it’s too early to give further information on that, because we have started the project not long time ago.\n\nHOST CITY: What’s the biggest challenge for EURO 2020?\n\nMartin Kallen: We have different challenges. The biggest one is surely to have a good EURO atmosphere in all the 13 countries as each one has 4 matches in only one host city of the country.\n\nThe other challenge is to ensure easy transport access. Or to have back to back matches in a host city, so fans can remain in the city until the next match – these are all important points to look at.\n\nOf course you have 13 different countries with 13 different legislations, so you have to analyse how you can build a unified ticketing concept which is the same for a supporter in London, Munich and Baku.\n\nHOST CITY: Will ticket prices be different in different countries?\n\nMartin Kallen: That is a good question. That will be decided at a later stage, whether you can have a set price or a different price category that depends on the purchasing power of the people in the country to buy tickets.\n\n[Source: Nordic FAs] The Nordic countries bid for UEFA Women's EURO 2025 with a strong vision of involving and developing women’s football. Nordic values and sustainable development are the core power of the joint bid.\n\nThe Nordic football associations have worked closely together for four years to make a joint bid for a major championship. Now Denmark, Finland, Norway, and Sweden have announced their preliminary bid for the UEFA Women's EURO 2025 with support from the Faroe Islands and Iceland.\n\n“Football is a powerful opportunity to make a change. Together with our Nordic allies we want to show the world through football we have a chance to enhance ethics, transparency and bright and diverse future of the sports”, says president of the Finnish Football Association, Ari Lahti.\n\nIn Denmark, they draw on experiences from EURO2020, where four matches were very successfully staged in Copenhagen.\n\nIn the last few years, the Nordic Football Associations have researched for stadiums, host cities, base camps, and other facilities to form the complete picture of how to develop the best possible host for the UEFA Women's EURO 2025. This work will continue until October 2022 when a final bid should be submitted.\n\nIn December 2022, UEFA's executive committee will announce the host of the UEFA Women's EURO 2025. If awarded to the Nordic team, it will be a spectacular final at Friends Arena in Stockholm – the largest stadium in the Nordic region with room for 50,000 spectators.\n\nKarl-Erik Nilsson, President of the Swedish Football Association says: “All Nordic football associations agrees about the importance of organizing major championships in our countries, and together we have great ambitions for the development of women’s football. We know that a UEFA Women’s Euro in the Nordic countries will strengthen the women’s football, and become an unforgettable experience for both players and supporters.”\n\nJesper Møller, President of the Danish Football Association says: \"The Nordic bid for UEFA Women's EURO 2025 is much more than a championship – it is a team work to ensure the continued development of women's football for more diversity across our common, Nordic visions and values. With EURO 2020 in fresh memory, where Denmark showed its event potential, we will reuse and refine all the good experiences. With a joint Nordic bid, we will display not just Denmark but the entire Nordic approach to women's football and innovative event management\"\n\nLise Klaveness, President of Norway Football Association says: “UEFA Women's EURO 2025 in Norway and the Nordic countries will be a celebration of inclusion, tolerance, and community for all football fans at the stadiums and events in the hosting cities. The spectacle of the finals will be an integrated part of our strategy to strengthen the position of women and girls on and off the pitch in Norwegian football. Great progress has been made in Norway and internationally in recent years developing the women’s game where we are proud to be a pioneer. A Nordic UEFA Women's EURO 2025 tournament will be a powerful showcase for even greater impact and legacy.”\n\nUEFA, the administrative body for football in Europe, has denounced the agreement of twelve leading European football clubs to establish the Super League as a new mid-week competition.\n\nAC Milan, Arsenal FC, Atlético de Madrid, Chelsea FC, FC Barcelona, FC Internazionale Milano, Juventus FC, Liverpool FC, Manchester City, Manchester United, Real Madrid CF and Tottenham Hotspur have all joined the planned Super League as Founding Clubs.\n\n“UEFA, the English Football Association and the Premier League, the Royal Spanish Football Federation (RFEF) and LaLiga, and the Italian Football Federation (FIGC) and Lega Serie A have learned that a few English, Spanish and Italian clubs may be planning to announce their creation of a closed, so-called Super League”, said a statement.\n\n“If this were to happen, we wish to reiterate that we – UEFA, the English FA, RFEF, FIGC, the Premier League, LaLiga, Lega Serie A, but also FIFA and all our member associations – will remain united in our efforts to stop this cynical project, a project that is founded on the self-interest of a few clubs at a time when society needs solidarity more than ever.\n\n“We will consider all measures available to us, at all levels, both judicial and sporting in order to prevent this happening. Football is based on open competitions and sporting merit; it cannot be any other way.\n\n“As previously announced by FIFA and the six Confederations, the clubs concerned will be banned from playing in any other competition at domestic, European or world level, and their players could be denied the opportunity to represent their national teams.\n\n“We thank those clubs in other countries, especially the French and German clubs, who have refused to sign up to this. We call on all lovers of football, supporters and politicians, to join us in fighting against such a project if it were to be announced. This persistent self-interest of a few has been going on for too long. Enough is enough.”\n\nDiscussions with UEFA and FIFA\n\nIn their statement announcing the agreement, the founding clubs said: “Going forward, the Founding Clubs look forward to holding discussions with UEFA and FIFA to work together in partnership to deliver the best outcomes for the new League and for football as a whole.\n\n“The formation of the Super League comes at a time when the global pandemic has accelerated the instability in the existing European football economic model. Further, for a number of years, the Founding Clubs have had the objective of improving the quality and intensity of existing European competitions throughout each season, and of creating a format for top clubs and players to compete on a regular basis.\n\n“The pandemic has shown that a strategic vision and a sustainable commercial approach are required to enhance value and support for the benefit of the entire European football pyramid. In recent months extensive dialogue has taken place with football stakeholders regarding the future format of European competitions. The Founding Clubs believe the solutions proposed following these talks do not solve fundamental issues, including the need to provide higher-quality matches and additional financial resources for the overall football pyramid.”\n\nThe league aims to include three further clubs and to open “as soon as practicable”, eyeing an “August start”.\n\nThe development of the Super League, financed by JP Morgan, comes at a time of unprecedented private equity investment in sports events.\n\nThe UK government has said it will do everything it can to prevent English clubs participating. The plans have been widely criticised by fans and the wider footballing community.\n\nHost City: Events involving multiple host cities are usually delivered by a local organising committee (LOC) in the host nation. What prompted UEFA to bring the organisation of its events in-house instead?\n\nChristian Hirschmueller: UEFA’s approach is built on the understanding that knowledge and experience are critical success factors to deliver UEFA’s events on a very high service level in the most effective and most efficient ways.\n\nHistorically, UEFA started to be directly involved in event operations in 2002 for the UEFA EURO 2004 in Portugal. For UEFA EURO 2008 in Austria and Switzerland, the geographical proximity of the hosts still allowed to have a LOC model, with many synergies created between the LOC and UEFA Events SA. It was thus a kind of intermediary step on the process to fully bring operations in-house.\n\nBy founding UEFA Events SA – a 100%-owned subsidiary of UEFA – after a very successful UEFA EURO 2008, UEFA was able to keep in-house the knowledge and experience obtained during its two previous major sport events. Furthermore, this knowledge was structured in so-called ‘Competence Centres’, such as Technical Services & Overlay (TECH). With the in-house organisation of the annual UEFA Club Competition Finals as from 2013 onwards, UEFA Events SA has been able to use the knowledge and experience of the Competence Centres across all UEFA competitions and maximise the output in terms of effectiveness and efficiency.\n\nThis process which lasted over several years, from the first operational steps in Portugal to the current performance of UEFA Events SA, was initiated, led and implemented by the CEO of UEFA Events SA Martin Kallen.\n\nHost City: Which aspects of event delivery does UEFA outsource most – from operational management and expertise, down to products and services?\n\nChristian Hirschmueller: The daily business in the operational part of UEFA Events SA is to plan and produce UEFA’s events. This means to appoint and contract suppliers, organise the works and coordinate the several activities with all relevant stakeholders. These typically are tasks of companies offering main contractor services which we operate by ourselves.\n\nRegarding operation, this seems one of the main differences between UEFA and other organisers of major sport events: While for other major sports events it might be key to involve a main contractor in order to deliver the event including all the above tasks, UEFA Events SA is covering this part itself and looks for specialised suppliers delivering the services directly.\n\nThis leads to a more direct interaction between internal stakeholders and suppliers and contractual relations are thus getting more transparent. Our experience shows that it saves financial resources, time for complex overhead management and reduces miscommunication between all parties due to less interfaces.\n\nHost City: Can you give us an idea of the scale and scope of technical services and overlay required for an event like the European Football Championship?\n\nChristian Hirschmueller: Generally speaking, TECH is responsible to provide and operate technical infrastructure at the stadiums for UEFA’s major sport events as e.g. UEFA EURO, UEFA Champions League Final or UEFA Europa League Final according to all stakeholders needs and agreed service levels.\n\nOn the one hand this includes the existing technical infrastructure, such as stadium and grid power systems, the proper functioning of the pitch floodlighting or the operation of sound systems, giant screens and stadium TV system.\n\nOn the other hand, this also includes the provision of temporary infrastructure inside and outside the stadium, as the technical and infrastructural needs for such major sports events are higher than existing systems are usually able to cover.\n\nThe list of figures and deliverables is long: for UEFA EURO 2016, TECH delivered 24 MW of temporary power systems for TV broadcasting and additional outside facilities with approx. 1,000 km of cables, 17,700 m2 of tent structures with water und air-condition installation, cleaning services for 500,000 m2 and removed 600 tonnes of waste, installed 1,700 TV commentary desks in 10 different venues, provided a total of 800m cable bridges, installed approx. 25,000 cable hooks, 100 camera platforms, 39 TV pitch view studios, implemented the sound system upgrade of 10 stadiums with 1,100 speakers and around 200 individual infrastructural changes in these 10 stadiums.\n\nIn addition, TECH was responsible for the health and safety procedures during the set-up and dismantling period with a 4,000-page documentation and 200 on-site briefings, the permission process for technical installations with approx. 15,000-page documentation as well as for the frequency management process with 5,000 frequency applications over all matches.\n\nThe TECH planning team was made up of seven people: three in Switzerland and four colleagues in Paris. The overall budget of TECH for UEFA EURO 2016 was EUR 26m.\n\nHost City: For most mega events, the host nation benefits from the opportunity to engage with local suppliers and sponsors to deliver the event. How can hosts of UEFA events benefit if all the procurement and marketing is handled centrally?\n\nChristian Hirschmueller: Let me give you the example of UEFA Technical Services & Overlay (TECH) for UEFA EURO 2016 in France.\n\nAll suppliers were chosen in an open and public tender process. Key factors for choosing suppliers are quality of equipment, availability of resources as well as experience for these very specialised fields in major sport event. Once this is given, local/national suppliers are very attractive for us as they have often the advantage of low logistics and accommodation costs. With these parameters, in total more than two thirds of TECH’s budget remained in the host country.\n\nBeside the planning team mentioned above, the 10 TECH venue managers and the 10 TECH venue coordinators were all locals – half of them never participated in major events before, let alone in major sport events. This means that instead of hiring international crews, we developed a training programme and achieved a very successful knowledge transfer. This was mainly possible due to the model of UEFA Events SA and the core team in Nyon relying on the operational experience of several successfully delivered UEFA EURO tournaments.\n\nHost City: In another innovation, UEFA is staging the 2020 European Football Championships in 13 host venues, all in different nations. It must be incredibly complex working in 13 different countries to deliver the event – how is this being managed?\n\nChristian Hirschmueller: It is a project management challenge to organise a consistent UEFA EURO 2020 tournament under consideration of the new format with its multi-country aspect and cultural diversity. The main task is to prepare the stadiums – which are coming from different operational and infrastructural levels – for a EURO tournament operation.\n\nAt the beginning, the goal was to create a model that was as simple as possible, manageable, transparent and easy to understand for all stakeholders independent of their individual background.\n\nFor this purpose, UEFA Event SA has developed a process that regulates the activities of stakeholders to achieve agreed results together at certain stages, the so called ‘gates’. This process leads to the ‘UEFA Venue Operations Gate-Model’ summarising the process on one A4 page to support a common understanding in order to be ready for the next step in the planning phase.\n\nHost City: What are you most looking forward to about UEFA Euro 2020?\n\nChristian Hirschmueller: The UEFA EURO 2020 will take place from Bilbao to Baku and from Glasgow to Rome. It is a fantastic professional and personal enrichment to meet and cooperate with this large variety of characters and cultures and their different ways of living, during one event.\n\nHost City: Thank you very much and I look forward to hearing you speak at Host City 2017! What are your expectations of this important meeting of cities and events?\n\nChristian Hirschmueller: The Host City 2017 summit is an ideal place to meet and exchange with inspiring people of different branches. I look forward to gathering new aspects and impulses for the work of UEFA Events SA.\n\nUEFA president Aleksander Čeferin has warned the United States and Great Britain that travel restrictions and immigration policies could have a negative effect on hosting future tournaments and finals.\n\nThe United States is one of the favourites to host the 2026 World Cup, but if President Donald Trump’s proposed travel restrictions are approved then it will “not help” the US bid.\n\nČeferin, who is also a FIFA vice-president, told the New York Times: “It will be part of the evaluation, and I am sure it will not help the United States to get the World Cup.\n\n“If players cannot come because of political decisions, or populist decisions, then the World Cup cannot be played there. It is true for the United States, but also for all the other countries that would like to organise a World Cup.\n\n“It is the same for the fans, and the journalists, of course. It is the World Cup. They should be able to attend the event, whatever their nationality is. But let’s hope that it does not happen.”\n\nThe Slovenian also warned Britain that immigration policies after Brexit could affect the UK’s chances of hosting major European football finals.\n\n“If ‘Brexit’ happens, everything changes,” said Ceferin. “But football was played before, and it will be played in the future. Now, with free movement in the European Union, it is much better.”\n\nLast year Paris St-Germain defender Serge Aurier was denied entry to Britain to play in a Champions League match against Arsenal. Aurier had been convicted for assault and was appealing the conviction. This is a concern for Čeferin.\n\n“I was very disappointed when Aurier, from P.S.G., was not allowed to enter England,” he said. “That will worsen when ‘Brexit’ happens, especially if the reasons were as formal. We could have a serious problem.\n\n“But if we see that players cannot enter because they have any sort of procedure ongoing, then we will simply think if we should play our European matches there.\n\n“Neymar and Lionel Messi both have procedures going on. This year, the Champions League final is in Cardiff. Imagine if they did not let them in?\n\n“That is a big thing for us, if players from England can travel anywhere but players from other teams cannot travel to England. With free movement in Europe, it is much better.\n\n“Even in 2020, if ‘Brexit’ has happened, then it can be a big problem for fans. That stays firm, and we will speak to the British government, and I am sure the English Football Association will help us.”"
