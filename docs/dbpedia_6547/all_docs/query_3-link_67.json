        "text": "For now, it appears that Julian Alvarez has played his final game for Manchester City. Yesterday Fabrizio Romano gave his famous ‘Here we go’ line in regards to the move of Alvarez to Atletico Madrid. It now appears to be only a matter of time before the Argentinian international leaves the world champions. With that in mind, the World Cup winner made a sizable contribution to Manchester City during his two-year stay at the club. He deserves thanks from the City faithful as he looks set to begin the next chapter of his career.\n\nJulian Alvarez arrived at Manchester City in the summer of 2022. He arrived at the club from River Plate as one of the hottest young prospects in Argentinian football. Alvarez quickly established himself as a key player in Pep Guardiola’s squad. All told he made 103 appearances for Manchester City. He scored 36 goals and added 18 assists in those appearances. But that doesn’t tell the full story of the impact of the Argentinian international at Manchester City.\n\nREAD MORE: Who could be the ideal player to replace Julian Alvarez for Manchester City?\n\nJulian Alvarez became a Mr Fix-It of sorts for Pep Guardiola. He played up front when required and as a number 10, in midfield or on a wing on occasions for Manchester City. With his talent and work rate, he would always do what was asked of him by Pep Guardiola. That is a testament to the quality of Alvarez that no role was beneath the Argentinian. In an era where certain star players tend to dictate their positions, Julian Alvarez was a breath of fresh air in that regard.\n\nBut it was the contribution of Alvarez during the midway point of the 23/24 season that stands out during his time at Manchester City. Pep Guardiola’s side hit the midway point of last season with Kevin De Bruyne and Erling Haaland both out with significant injuries. They needed players to step up in their absence. It was Phil Foden and Julian Alvarez who stepped up to keep City in touching distance of Arsenal and Liverpool in last season’s Premier League title race. The pair laid the platform for City to launch one of their traditional late runs to create history. Without the contributions of Alvarez and Foden, City may not have been in a position to win a fourth consecutive Premier League title.\n\nJulian Alvarez also made a telling contribution to City’s FIFA Club World Cup success last season. Whenever City needed him to step up he did. His contribution last season is a testament to this. City’s FIFA Club World Cup success is a fitting reminder of what Alvarez added to Pep Guardiola’s squad.\n\nJulian Alvarez looks set to leave Manchester City in the coming days. But he has made a sizable contribution to the club during his two seasons at the club. City claimed the UEFA Champions League, the FIFA Club World Cup, the FA Cup, the UEFA Super Cup and back-to-back Premier League titles during his spell at the Etihad. Without his contribution that may not have been possible. While other players would get the headlines Alvarez was always there when Manchester City needed him. That will be his legacy at Manchester City."
