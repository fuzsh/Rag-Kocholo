        "text": "UEFA’S CHANGE OF FOCUS\n\nWith international competitions well established in the women’s game by the end of the 20th century, a new UEFA Women’s Cup provided an opportunity for the best clubs across the continent to go up against each other; the aim being to increase the general profile of women’s football and adding a higher level of elite competition that also underpinned growing quality at future international tournaments. In that first 2001/02 competition, 33 member associations entered a team – Arsenal represented England – and UEFA was pleased with the immediate uptake, considering the tight budgets for many of those involved, and the costs of embarking on a continental campaign.\n\nLop-sided groups saw wild scorelines, with FFC Frankfurt recording an 18-0 aggregate scoreline in a single match as they swept aside CSC Yerevan from Armenia, alongside five other double-digit goal tallies (which thankfully, have become far more of a rare occurrence in the competition these days).\n\nThe group winners from 2001/02 headed to the quarter-finals, and from there it was typical two-legged knockouts, leading to that one-off final in Frankfurt. There, despite awful weather, 12,106 fans watched a FFC Frankfurt team inspired by future two-time World Cup winner Birgit Prinz beat Umea of Sweden 2-0. UEFA highlighted the attendance as being a European record for the women’s club game, although historic research since then would suggest that wasn’t anywhere near the case. Nevertheless, the success of UEFA’s fledgling club competition was clear to see."
