        "text": "Bye for now\n\nThat's all for today then. Do join us again on Thursday for all the latest transfer news and build-up to the start of the new EFL season, while Manchester City prepare to face Manchester United in the Community Shield.\n\nWe'll also have updates on the latest pre-season games, with Arsenal set to host Bayer Leverkusen later while Aston Villa face Athletic Bilbao at Walsall. Until then, click on the summary points above or below for more on today's top stories and best features:\n\nMorata & Rodri banned for 'Gibraltar is Spanish' chant\n\nChelsea work on deal to sign Atletico's Omorodion\n\n'Great business' or 'a huge mistake'? Fan views on Man City selling Alvarez\n\nCrushing injuries and cowboy hats - Zamora on rise of Swansea boss Williams\n\nWhere has Lee Carsley managed before?\n\nOne of the arguments that could be put forward against Lee Carsley as the permanent manager is his relative lack of senior team experience, although he has coached men's senior teams before.\n\nAs a player, he has a lot of experience of senior football and in a career spanning over 500 games, he played 282 of those in the Premier League.\n\nThe 50-year-old has been caretaker manager for Coventry City in 2012 and 2013, caretaker of Birmingham City in 2017. He also had a 10-game stint as interim head coach in the Championship before Dean Smith was appointed permanently at Brentford.\n\nDuring his time as the Bees' interim manager he won five of his 10 games in charge and was named Championship Manager of the Month in October 2015.\n\nCarsley had been in discussions with Brentford owner Matthew Benham about taking the job at the club permanently during that time but he said he was focused on development football.\n\nBenham said to Carsley he could develop the players in the first team at the club and Carsley has since admitted he wouldn't be âcaught outâ by making that mistake again if offered a senior job.\n\nWhen speaking to the BBC in 2023, he said he played the best football of his playing career between the ages of 28 and 33 years-old, using the example that players can always develop at any stage.\n\nAs auditions go, a debut fixture against the country he represented at international level, would be quite the introduction.\n\nCarsley is an 'unbelievable manager'\n\nAlex Howell\n\nBBC football news reporter\n\nWhenever England play thereâs a debate about how they fit in all of their best players. Looking at how Lee Carsley set up his U21 side, could he be the coach to fit together Trent Alexander-Arnold, Kyle Walker and Reece James - Englandâs glut of exceptional right backs - and players such as Cole Palmer, Bukayo Saka, Jack Grealish, Phil Foden and Jude Bellingham into one team?\n\nOn the way to lifting the trophy in Georgia, when his side came up against Germany in the group stage, Carsley played Palmer in a number eight position in centre midfield and played the majority of the tournament with Newcastle winger Anthony Gordon â named player of the tournament - as his main striker.\n\nGordon called Carsley the âbest man-managerâ he has had in his career and Liverpoolâs Harvey Elliot said Carsley is an âunbelievable managerâ during the Reds pre-season tour this summer.\n\nOf course there are players such as John Stones, Declan Rice and captain Harry Kane that Carsley has not worked with before but, since the U21s lifted the trophy in Georgia, a large number of them have made the step up into the senior squad.\n\nWhat is Carsley's style of play?\n\nAlex Howell\n\nBBC football news reporter\n\nOne of the main criticisms of Gareth Southgateâs tenure was that he did not make enough of the attacking players he had at his disposal. It was the most hotly-debated issue of Englandâs run to Euro 2024, with plenty of debate about Phil Fodenâs perfect position, Cole Palmer only being used from the bench and Anthony Gordon barely featuring.\n\nWhen the England U21 side won the European Championship last summer, social media was rife with montages of the teamâs attractive football dubbed âCars-ballâ.\n\nThose homemade edits resurfaced in the days after Southgate stood down and Birmingham-born Carsleyâs name was among the contenders to replace him.\n\nIn contrast with the picture of former Everton and Derby midfielder Carsleyâs playing career as a central destroyer, he encourages his side to build up with the ball and to express themselves.\n\nAt the tournament in Georgia his side was packed with technical players such as Liverpool duo Harvey Elliott and Curtis Jones, and Nottingham Forest's Morgan Gibbs-White.\n\nHe had a right-footed left-back in Bournemouth's Max Aarons; Everton's James Garner, a central midfielder, playing at right-back; and Jones, a number 10, as one of his two pivots in midfield.\n\nJones played alongside Angel Gomes - now at Lille - who had already transitioned from a number 10 to a deep midfielder. Carsley resisted the temptation to put a traditional centre midfielder next to him.\n\nMoves often started with Burnley goalkeeper James Trafford passing out and players encouraged to express themselves and trust in their decision-making.\n\nThere was one occasion when Chelsea defender Levi Colwill stood still on the ball for more than 30 seconds as he waited for the opposition to press him so he could draw in pressure and then initiate the attack - something the team had worked on in training.\n\nPrepare for 'Carsball': What to expect from Carsley's England\n\nAlex Howell\n\nBBC football news reporter\n\nSome of the biggest managerial names in world football have been linked to the England job since Gareth Southgate resigned after Euro 2024.\n\nBut, for now at least, it is Lee Carsley who is the most likely option as England's interim manager for Nations League games against Ireland and Finland in September.\n\nAnd could the England Under-21 manager be a contender for the permanent role, following the pathway of his predecessor Southgate?\n\nBBC Sportâs Alex Howell followed Carsleyâs England U21 side in Georgia last summer as they won the trophy for the first time in almost 40 years playing a brand of fluid, attacking, high-risk football â while also becoming the first team to record six successive clean sheets in the tournament's history.\n\nCarsley even guided England to victory over Spain in that final â a feat that appears impossible at senior level, with the Spanish menâs national team and La Liga sides winning all 27 major finals the two countries have been involved in dating back to 2002.\n\nA former Republic of Ireland international, Carsley is one of several highly-rated coaches who has progressed through the St. Georgeâs Park system since he joined the FA set-up in 2015.\n\nClick here to read more\n\nLiverpool look at move for midfielder Zubimendi\n\nMandeep Sanghera\n\nBBC Sport\n\nLiverpool are exploring a move for Real Sociedad midfielder Martin Zubimendi as they look to make their first signing under new manager Arne Slot.\n\nZubimendi was part of the Spain squad that won Euro 2024 and came on as a second-half substitute for Manchester City's Rodri when his country beat England 2-1 in the final.\n\nThe 25-year-old has been at Sociedad since 2011 and is reported to have a release clause worth 60m euros (Â£51.5m).\n\nZubimendi helped Sociedad finish sixth in La Liga last season, scoring four times in 31 league appearances. The Spanish club also reached the last 16 of the Champions League in 2023-24 before they were beaten by Paris St-Germain.\n\nZubimendi would be the first arrival under Slot, who took over at the Anfield club following the departure of Jurgen Klopp.\n\nIs the pressure on Leeds?\n\nLeeds appear to be the clear favourites to top the Championship this time around.\n\nLast term they came agonisingly close to returning to the Premier League after dropping out of the automatic promotion places and losing to Southampton in the play-off final.\n\nDaniel Farke guided United to a third-placed finish in the league and it was perhaps their poor start and end to the season that proved to be costly.\n\nDespite losing young talent Archie Gray and the leagueâs player of the season Crysencio Summerville, they've made some decent additions and are expected to be right up there once again.\n\nWill coming so close last season spur them on to go one better this year? I suspect so.\n\nThey welcome Portsmouth to Elland Road for the first game of the season.\n\nCan Burnley bounce back?\n\nAfter finishing 19th in the Premier League last season, Burnley will play Championship football again but will they be able to replicate the heroics of 2023 when the Clarets secured promotion to the top flight with seven games to go? It's unlikely.\n\nVincent Kompany swapped Burnley for Bayern Munich and Scott Parker is now at the helm in this corner of east Lancashire.\n\nParker has twice won promotion to the Premier League. His Bournemouth side went up automatically in 2022 and he guided Fulham to promotion via the playoffs two years earlier.\n\nHe is a man still with questions to answer after being out of work since last March when he was sacked by Club Bruges. He won just two games at the Belgian club.\n\nDespite an apprehensiveness from some over the man in the dugout, Parker will still have plenty of talent at his disposal with the likes of Sander Berge and Josh Brownhill in the middle.\n\nThey start their Championship campaign against Luton on Monday. How significant could that one prove to be by the end of the season?\n\n1) Derby County: 2007-08 (11 points)\n\nWhat happened next?\n\nThe Rams kept faith with Paul Jewell, who had led Bradford and Wigan to promotion from the second tier, despite his minimal impact having taken over from Davies the previous November.\n\nAfter a slow start to the season, three wins and a draw from five league games in October were enough for Jewell to be nominated for the Championship manager of the month award, but that was as good as it got for both team and boss that season.\n\nJewell resigned on 28 December after a 1-0 home defeat by Ipswich left them five points above the second-tier relegation zone.\n\nNigel Clough, son of legendary Derby and Nottingham Forest boss Brian, took over the following month and steered them to survival with an 18th-placed finish.\n\nOddly, despite their league struggles, they made the semi-finals of the League Cup and victories over Stoke and Manchester United (who they lost to over two legs in the semis) meant they actually beat more Premier League teams that season than they had in the previous campaign when they had been a top-flight side.\n\nFootball, hey?\n\n2) Sunderland: 2005-06 (15 points)\n\nWhat happened next?\n\nEx-Black Cats striker Niall Quinn found himself as both chairman and manager when the season began after a summer takeover.\n\nHe made no secret of the fact it was not a position he wanted to be in and his six games in charge brought five defeats and one win.\n\nEnter Roy Keane.\n\nThe legendary Manchester United midfielder had just retired from playing after a brief stint at Celtic and took over at the Stadium of Light with the team down at the wrong end of the table.\n\nHe made a decent start to get them going in the right direction but kicked things into top gear in January thanks to some clever additions like former United team-mate Dwight Yorke.\n\nA 17-match unbeaten league run between 1 January and 14 April catapulted them to the top of the table as the yo-yo club again won the Championship title.\n\n=3) Huddersfield: 2018-19 (16 points)\n\nWhat happened next?\n\nTown stuck with Siewert for pre-season but he was sacked after a 1-0 home defeat by League One Lincoln in the Carabao Cup in just the third game of the season.\n\nImps boss Danny Cowley was then appointed his successor a few weeks later off the back of leading Lincoln to two promotions in three seasons from the National League to League One.\n\nTown eventually claimed their first victory since February on 1 October but it was a season of struggle for the West Yorkshire side.\n\nIn a campaign broken up by the Covid-19 pandemic, they finally secured their second-tier survival after a win over promotion-chasing West Brom in the penultimate game of the season on 17 July.\n\n4) Aston Villa: 2015-16 (17 points)\n\nWhat happened next?\n\nChinese businessman Tony Xia took over in the summer and said he wanted the club to win the Champions League within 10 years.\n\nHowever, despite spending big on players like James Chester, Jonathan Kodjia and Ross McCormack, boss Roberto Di Matteo won just one of his 11 matches and was sacked in October.\n\nChampionship promotion expert Steve Bruce came in but could only guide them to 13th, as they finished 18 points off the play-offs and 31 off the top two.\n\nDespite his bold promises, Xia was in danger of running the club out of business before billionaires Wes Edens and Nassef Sawiris took over in July 2018 and Villa fan Dean Smith ultimately took them back up thanks to a play-off final victory over Derby.\n\nOf course, now Unai Emery has them in the Champions League, maybe Xia could yet be proven right...\n\n=5) Sunderland: 2002-03 (19 points)*\n\n*Portsmouth ended the season with 19 points in 2009-10 but that was after being deducted nine points for entering administration\n\nWhat happened next?\n\nSunderland fans probably feared the worst when they lost their first two matches back in the Football League but a run of four straight wins after that got their season going.\n\nThey never really threatened the top two of Norwich and West Brom but a third-placed finish was an impressive showing given the disarray of the previous campaign.\n\nSunderland's promotion bid ended at the play-off semi-final stage, though, as sixth-placed Crystal Palace claimed a 5-4 win on penalties after a last-minute goal by Eagles midfielder Darren Powellin the second leghad made it 4-4 on aggregate.\n\nDriven on by that near miss, McCarthy led them to the title the following season with 94 points. Although success wasn't particularly lasting - more on that later..."
