        "text": "Sports Anthems: It’s amazing how they can move thousands and thousands of people all at once. Without a doubt, at least some of these songs on this list will be played at some point during MLB’s Opening Day.\n\nMost sporting events without music nowadays just fall flat. An appropriate soundtrack is practically essential. Now, different sporting events often have different vibes. This can vary by the sport itself, the level of said sport or the region in which the sport is being played.\n\nWith this in mind, this list was crafted to have some surprises, yet also be overall universal. It’s trying to walk a very particular line of mass appeal and unexpectedness. Truth be told, this list of the best sports anthems walks that line rather brilliantly.\n\nHow This Best Sports Anthems List Was Determined\n\nThis author has been to her share of sporting events over the years. Regardless of the sport, there are just certain songs that are ubiquitous at sporting events. Whether it’s high school, minor leagues or the pros, these 25 songs deliver on at least one over more of these levels:\n\n-Does the song help hype up a crowd?\n\n-Does the song add a new, appropriate level of emotion to a sporting event?\n\n-Does the song have a unique tie to a team/athlete, but can also transcend it?\n\n-Does it have a universally recognizable hook?\n\n-Has it been used in a sports movie, thus, increasing its reach to the general public?\n\nLook, this list is far from scientific, but it sure is a lot of fun, which is the whole point of any list like this. Frankly, it was a lot of fun to put together. It’s even more fun to revisit when major sports events appear on the calendar, from Opening Day to the Super Bowl and everywhere in between.\n\nFrom rock to hip hop to EDM to pop, here are the 25 best sports anthems, ranked."
