        "text": "With 2030 and 2034 hosting all but confirmed (i.e. engineered with the bidding process virtually sidelined) the question arises who will host in 2038 once Iberia/Morocco/South America (2030) and Saudi Arabia (2034) get the rubber stamp from the FIFA Congress in 2024.\n\nIt's all rather tragically comical. The FIFA Congress approval was introduced post Russia and Qatar to take away power from the FIFA Council (formerly ExCo) except all that power is right back with Infantino and his \"yes\" men and women on the Council where bids are sidelined before they even go to a Congress vote. Case in point, less than a month was given to others to challenge Saudi Arabia for 2034. Simply outrageous.\n\nAnd of course, with the tournament bloated to 48 teams, hosting candidates are significantly narrowed down.\n\nWhy only three continents will likely host a FIFA World Cup:\n\nhttps://www.espn.co.uk/football/story/_/id/38792428/why-fifa-backed-corner-world-cup-hosts\n\nAssuming current restrictions apply and Europe, Asia, Africa, and South America are indeed prevented from bidding in 2038 (in South America's case for three measly games in 2030!) that just leaves Concacaf and the *gasp* OFC.\n\nSo I guess we are looking at yet another World Cup in North America.\n\nThat just leaves the following question. Will Canada and Mexico get a decent number of games this time? Including later rounds? Will the Azteca host the final?\n\nArticle 68 paragraph 4 of the FIFA statutes only disqualifies national associations which belong to the confederation which hosted the previous WC from hosting the next one, so only AFC members would be unable to host the 2038 WC. FIFA is currently revising its statutes, but I don't expect this particular rule to be changed.\n\nGiven that policy has been to select or pre-select the most lucrative venue - both on the part of FIFA and the majority of national associations - I suspect the 2038 edition will be held in Europe, where there are several countries which could handle the demanding organisation of a 48-team event.\n\nBy 2038, England would not have hosted the WC for 72 years but - given the size of the event and the fact that British government policy has been for the UK to bid as a whole rather than as individual countries - I would expect a UK bid and given its likely very attractive commercial potential it would be very favourably received by FIFA and the majority of national associations.\n\nThose new rules also empower the Council to select up to three bids for submission to the Congress for the final decision, so everything the Council did this year was constitutional.\n\nThey may have followed the letter of the statutes, but I would argue they didn't follow the spirit of the same. Again, giving under a month to challenge Saudi Arabia through a formal letter of intent is all but impossible for a non-monarchy where government backing must be secured along with the usual associated studies.\n\nAlthough it sounds like Australia was informally promised (as compensation?) the 2029 CWC which, as of now, is awarded directly by the Council (another thing they have to fix if the expanded CWC is going to be a major FIFA event).\n\nThe point is FIFA was supposed to get more transparent. Without such backroom deals. That has definitely not happened under Infantino and unfortunately it seems he can remain in power until 2031.\n\nCan't argue any of this - in essence, the vote will be a de facto referendum.\n\nSo, there's still technically a chance that those bids fail and the process gets reopened... but half of FIFA's confeds are in on 2030, and Saudi Arabia's wouldn't hesitate to give us \" @Nico Limmat sponsored by LIV\" if that's what it took to push '34 through\n\nI'm not that easy. I also want games in the UAE.\n\nwe have no clue what FIFA will be up to in 7-8 years when the process starts. all confederation rotation rules are used only if that suits them, so those have no real weight. if FIFA sees an opportunity to put extra $$$ onto their accounts they will easily bypass any rule.\n\nunfortunately it is very likely that infantino is still going to be in his chair when 2038 decission is made and that definitely means nothing good\n\nSo no breadcrumbs for Canada and Mexico?\n\nWhat about the next Concacaf World Cup in the 2050’s? Will Mexico ever see another quarterfinal, semifinal, or *gasp* final?\n\nIf the World Cup is going be in the USA every 8-12 years, I'd like to at least see some interesting co-hosting arrangements. Like one half of the bracket in the US and the other half in Brazil (they do have the 2014 stadiums) or something.\n\nI think the 2022 WC did quite well with the TV ratings. I would imagine that where the WC is held matters more than when. Staging a WC in the Europe/Middle-east/Africa time zones probably give a boost to TV ratings.\n\nI forget how awful events in Australia/Japan are. I hope they don't host unless i can be there the entire time.\n\nProbably because it was a weird novelty.\n\nIt is more of a dead time for USA networks during the Summer so it is more ideal to leave it as is and not play in November/December.\n\nOther parts of the world probably do not care as much though but they do not like it cause of the club calendars disruptions."
