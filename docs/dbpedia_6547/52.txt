International football competition

The 2025 UEFA Women's Under-19 Championship will be the 22nd edition of the UEFA Women's Under-19 Championship, the annual international youth football championship organised by UEFA for the women's under-19 national teams of Europe. Poland will host the tournament after original host Belarus was stripped from hosting rights due to the country's involvement of the Russian invasion of Ukraine.[1][2]

Similar to the previous editions held in odd-numbered years, the tournament will act as the UEFA qualifiers for the FIFA U-20 Women's World Cup. The top five teams of the tournament will qualify for the 2026 FIFA U-20 Women's World Cup in Poland as the UEFA representatives besides Poland who automatically qualified as host. If Poland finished in the top four, the team that would be ranked fifth and sixth in the final stage would also qualify.

A total of eight teams are playing in the tournament, with players born on or after 1 January 2006 eligible to participate.

Qualification

52 (out of 55) UEFA nations entered the qualifying competition, with the hosts Poland also competing despite already qualifying automatically, and seven teams would qualify for the final tournament at the end of round 2 to join the hosts.

Qualified teams

Seven teams will qualify for the final tournament along with hosts Poland.
