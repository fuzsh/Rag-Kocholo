Released in the United States as a single in 1968, it followed United States trumpeter Herb Alpert's vocal performance of \"This Guy's in Love with You\" to the top spot on the Hot 100 chart,[1] ranking it as the 18th biggest hit of the year.[2] The song also reached No. 15 Adult Contemporary.[3] Masekela included the song in his albums Grazing in the Grass: The Best of Hugh Masekela (2001), Still Grazing (2004), and Live at the Market Theatre (2006).\n\nMasekela's recording was inducted into the Grammy Hall of Fame in 2018.[4]\n\nA vocal version by American vocal group The Friends of Distinction, with lyrics by band member Harry Elston, was a US chart hit in 1969. \"Grazing in the Grass\" has been recorded by many other musicians.\n\nHugh Masekela recording\n\n[edit]\n\nThe music was inspired by an earlier novelty recording, \"Mr. Bull No. 4\", by Freddie Gumbi,[5] which Masekela had heard in Zambia, that started with a cowbell. When Masekela was recording his debut album, the running order was short by three minutes and his record company suggested he add the tune. Philemon Hou, an actor and singer who was present in the studio, came up with a new melody while the backing track was already being recorded.[6] The session was held at Gold Star Studios in Hollywood.[7]\n\nPersonnel\n\n[edit]\n\nHugh Masekela – trumpet\n\nBruce Langhorne – guitar\n\nAl Abreu – alto sax\n\nWilliam Henderson – piano\n\nHenry Franklin – bass\n\nChuck Carter – drums, cowbell[8]\n\nCharts\n\n[edit]\n\nChart (1968) Peak\n\nposition US Billboard Hot 100 1\n\nThe Friends of Distinction version\n\n[edit]\n\n\"Grazing in the Grass\"Single by The Friends of Distinctionfrom the album Grazin' B-side\"I Really Hope You Do\"ReleasedMarch 1969Recorded1969GenreLength2:52LabelRCA VictorSongwriter(s)\n\nPhilemon Hou\n\nHarry Elston\n\nProducer(s)John FlorezThe Friends of Distinction singles chronologyMusic video on YouTube\n\nThe Friends of Distinction recorded a vocal remake of the tune in 1969 on RCA Victor, which was also a Top Ten pop and R&B hit, reaching No. 3 on the former and No. 5 on the latter.[9] One of the group's members, Harry Elston, wrote lyrics for their version and sang lead vocals.\n\nPersonnel\n\n[edit]\n\nThe Friends of Distinction – vocals\n\nMax Bennett – electric bass\n\nJim Gordon – drums\n\nAl Casey and Arthur Wright – guitars\n\nGene Cipriano – piccolo flute\n\nJohn Audino, Anthony Terran, Bud Childers, Dalton Smith – trumpets\n\nKing Errisson – congas\n\nDouglas Davis – cello\n\nJim Horn – tenor saxophone\n\nGarry Nuttycombe – viola\n\nHarry Bluestone, Jimmy Getzoff – violins\n\nJack Arnold – percussion\n\nLarry Knechtel – piano\n\nLegacy\n\n[edit]\n\nThe Friends of Distinction performed the song on The Ed Sullivan Show on December 27, 1970,[10] and appeared in a cameo section of Season Episode 8 of the adult animated sitcom Family Guy.[11] Their version also used in a 2023 TV commercial for Airbnb.[citation needed] A cover by Raven-Symoné is featured in the end credits of the animated film The Lion King 1½.[citation needed]\n\nChart performance\n\n[edit]\n\nWeekly charts\n\n[edit]\n\nChart (1969) Peak\n\nposition Canada RPM Top Singles[12] 5 U.S. Billboard Hot 100[13] 3 U.S. Billboard Hot Soul/R&B Singles[14] 5 U.S. Cash Box Top 100[15] 6\n\nYear-end charts\n\n[edit]\n\nChart (1969) Rank Canada[16] 62 U.S. Billboard Hot 100[17] 17 U.S. R&B (Billboard)[14] 42 U.S. Cash Box Top 100[18] 59\n\nReferences\n\n[edit]"
