        "text": "College always seemed like an unaffordable dream for the majority of my life. I never expected to come to college, but the only reason I am here is because of scholarships like this. The HAA scholarship not only helped lighten the burden of financial stress, but it also gave me access to a support system I could turn to whenever I felt like I did not belong.\n\nJuan Daniel Fernandez\n\n2019 Oklahoma Scholar"
