I had purchased it only because it was quad. Upon playing it I immediately recognized \"Grazing In The Grass\" and a couple of other tracks. I thought that it was great! At some point I picked up a Q8 copy of \"Whatever\" as well. I always liked their version of \"New Mother Nature\", in fact as much as that of The Guess Who's original version!\n\nThis collection (box set really) as expected isn't as distilled as a \"greatest hits\" or \"best of\" set would be and as such contains a fair bit of filler. \"Whatever\" is the exception with every track a winner.\n\nYes they do sound a lot like \"The Fifth Dimension\". Yes the lyrics are dated, They like to use every once hip sixties saying buzzword cliché, (however you would like to refer to the language used). In a way that is part of the charm!\n\nVery good surround wise. I would rate the albums \"Grazin'\" an 8, \"Real Friends and Highly Distinct\" a 7, \"Whatever\" a 9 or 10. Giving a total for the entire package an 8.\n\n​\n\nI never like writing a bad review, but.....\n\nLet's start with the positive. The mastering is unbelievable. Wow. Crystal clear vocals, instrumentation, etc. It's like you're in the room with them. The 4 channel mix is superb, like you're in the middle of the room with them. That being said....\n\nI never knew just how not pleasant their harmonies we're at times. Exceptionally dissonant sometimes. I noticed it especially with some of the female singers (which I know they switched out over the years.) But there were times where the harmonies were way off. Maybe they did well back then because we all listened to AM radio for their songs? Not sure.\n\nStill. Their hits like Grazing in the Grass and Love or Let Me Be Lonely were nice to hear in crystal clear sound.\n\nProduction, thanks to DV is a 10, but I had to give this a 5 overall. I'm glad I bought it, I'm glad I listened to it, but it will be one of those discs that are in my collection and will likely never listen to again.\n\nProduction, thanks to DV is a 10, but I had to give this a 5 overall. I'm glad I bought it, I'm glad I listened to it, but it will be one of those discs that are in my collection and will likely never listen to again.\n\nI've also got a number of one-and-done multichannel discs in my collection. What I've generally found is, if I rip them to the hard drive, I like listening to a song or two from them on occasion. I'll do a \"deep cut\" session where I listen to a track from this-album-and-that-album that I usually never bother with. I find these sessions to be very enjoyable...I never fret over the thought of slogging through a whole album of material for which I have little interest.\n\nThe fact that these quad mixes have been unheard for roughly half a century, and are now available remastered in high-definition is miraculous. A real gift. I had never heard of the group before, and while other people have mentioned the cover versions and poor harmonies, I found every album to be refreshingly out-of-the-ordinary and inventive.\n\nOne thing that has really surprised me though is that certain quad mixes use different arrangements compared to the stereo versions! Take, for example, My Mind is a Camera and Any Way You Want Me, both from the Real Friends album.\n\nMy Mind is a Camera has a completely different ending in quad than in stereo (the latter fades out the vocals and leaves just the horns and sleigh bells). And Any Way You Want Me in quad starts without the many horn stabs that the stereo version has (and I prefer).\n\nIs this a common occurence in quad mixes? It's the first time I've encountered this. I can understand certain elements in quad mixes becoming more noticeable because of the separation of the mix, but here we're talking about a completely different arrangement of part of the song...\n\nIs this a common occurence in quad mixes?

Heck yes, they ABOUND in the world of Quadraphonics! On early titles like this, chances are the fellow who mixed the stereo cuts was NOT the same guy who mixed the Quad cuts. Therefore, unless the original mixer/producer left detailed notes in the tape box, or the dude making the Quad mix referenced the stereo tracks before tackling the Quad remix; there could be significant differences! That is half the fun in the world of Quad.\n\nI never like writing a bad review, but.....\n\nLet's start with the positive. The mastering is unbelievable. Wow.

Now you hear 'em, now you don't. In the stereo mix, they're always there. Who mixed that track, anyway? (Rhetorical question...)"
