It charted #15 Pop and #3 R&B!\n\nThis Song Review by Andrew Hamilton sums up this luscious song better than I ever could:\n\n‚ÄúAn ultra smooth ballad from the pens of Anita Poree and Jerry Peters delivered by a masculine tenor who‚Äôs countered by a falsetto voice on every chorus; the falsetto takes over near the fade to emote one the most heartfelt tags ever dubbed on a soul record. Simply delicious! Fans lined up in droves when the Friends of Distinction made their inaugural round of soul tours; everybody wanted to hear them live and in person. Produced by Ray Cork, many, including the Gap Band and Luther Vandross, have redone this evergreen, but nobody has duplicated the essence of the original. ‚Äù (Source)\n\nOf course this song is such a classic ‚Äúslow jam‚Äù that even Madea sings it on the stage."
