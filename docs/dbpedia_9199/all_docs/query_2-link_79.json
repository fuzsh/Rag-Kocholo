        "text": "What is internal displacement?\n\nInternally displaced people, referred to as IDPs, have been forced to flee their homes by conflict, violence, persecution or disasters, however, they remain within the borders of their own country.\n\nGlobally, there are 68.3 million internally displaced people. They account for the majority of the world's forcibly displaced population (58 per cent).\n\nIDPs are among the most vulnerable people in the world, and many are trapped in protracted displacement for years or even decades. Uprooted from their homes and livelihoods, they often face dangerous conditions and continue to face risks even after fleeing for safety. National governments have the primary responsibility to protect and assist their displaced citizens and residents, but they may be unable or unwilling to do so.\n\nWhen IDPs do settle, places of refuge may lack adequate shelter, food, clean water or health care. Even where such services exist, the sudden influx of people can overwhelm them. It can be difficult for displaced people to find work, leaving them without an income to support themselves and their families.\n\nWhat is the difference between an IDP and a refugee?\n\nA refugee is someone who is outside their country and cannot return without risking their life or freedom due to conflict or persecution. Refugees are entitled to certain rights and protections under international law.\n\nAn IDP has been forced to flee their home to escape conflict, persecution or disasters, however, they have not crossed an international border and remain inside their country. Their national government is responsible for their protection. They should be afforded the same rights and freedoms as citizens and habitual residents of their country.\n\nDisplacement can often be a continuum: A person displaced within their country (an IDP) may cross an international border to seek safety once they are able to do so, or if the situation further deteriorates, at which point they may become a refugee. Likewise, a refugee may also cross back into their country but not return to their area of origin and so be classified as an IDP.\n\nHow does UNHCR help IDPs?\n\nUNHCR exists to protect and assist everyone who has been affected by forced displacement, including internally displaced people.\n\nAt UNHCR, we have been supporting IDPs since the 1970s. We deliver life-saving assistance to keep them safe and help national governments support IDPs so they can realize their rights and find a safe place to call home.\n\nUNHCR works with partners and other UN agencies to ensure that IDPs are protected and supported. In all our work, we aim to listen to and work with the affected community. We prioritize interventions to prevent, respond to, and mitigate their most urgent and immediate protection risks and needs, including protection against sexual exploitation and abuse, sexual and gender-based violence and child protection. We also bring our longstanding expertise in shelter and camp management to IDP responses, working to ensure displaced people have a safe place to stay can access local services, while ensuring their rights are protected."
