        "text": "Location\n\nTemporary Exhibitions, Jaffe, Hall, and Friends Galleries\n\nAbout\n\nHighlighting a stunning diversity of works dating from 1769 to 1969, many of which have never before been on view, Marks of Distinction features the talents of such distinguished artists as John Singleton Copley, John James Audubon, Winslow Homer, Mary Cassatt, James McNeill Whistler, John Singer Sargent, Joseph Stella, Jackson Pollock, Eva Hesse, and Romare Bearden. The exhibition reveals the rich variety of approaches, media, and subjects that have attracted American artists over the course of two centuries, ranging from Copley's magnificent 1769 pastel portrait of New Hampshire's last royal governor, John Wentworth, to early-nineteenth-century folk portraits and landscapes, lyrical nineteenth-century watercolor marines and interiors, dynamic images of New York City in the jazz age, and purely abstract compositions by pioneering artists associated with abstract expressionism and minimalism.\n\nThis exhibition and publication project was organized by the Hood Museum of Art, Dartmouth College, and supported in part by a major grant from the Henry Luce Foundation, Inc. Its presentation at the Hood Museum of Art is generously supported by the Bernard R. Siskind 1955 Fund and the Hansen Family Fund.\n\nExhibition Curator\n\nBarbara J.
