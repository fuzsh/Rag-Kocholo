In 2024, Quacquarelli Symonds named MSU as #9 in the United States for universities offering “Sports-related subjects.” MSU was also among the top 50 globally in the same rankings.\n\nTeacher preparation and academics\n\nMichigan State University was a pioneer when it launched a full-year teaching internship for students in 1993. Since then, nearly 14,000 Spartans have been certified as new teachers through MSU. The Teacher Preparation Program continues to evolve today.\n\nThe Urban Educators Cohort Program prepares students exclusively for teaching careers in high-need urban schools through special course sections and experiences starting their freshman year.\n\nThe Global Educators Cohort Program, which also starts freshman year, is designed to prepare teachers committed to educating global citizens and working in culturally and linguistically diverse classrooms.\n\nThe College of Education was one of the first to offer an online master’s degree program in education. Several of its master’s programs are now offered completely online, and the Ph.D. program in Educational Psychology and Educational Technology is offered in a hybrid (online and face-to-face) format.\n\nThe College of Education has national accreditation from several organizations, including the Teacher Preparation Program by the Council for the Accreditation of Educator Preparation (CAEP), which requires a commitment to continuously assess program effectiveness; our programs in Rehabilitation Counseling by the Council for Accreditation of Counseling and Related Educational Programs (CACREP); our doctoral program for School Psychology by the Commission on Accreditation of the American Psychological Association (APA) and the National Association of School Psychologists (NASP); and our M.S. in Athletic Training Program by the Commission on Accreditation of Athletic Training Education (CAATE).\n\nAll doctoral students in the College of Education have the opportunity to participate in the Fellowship to Enhance Global Understanding, a faculty-led international study trip with most expenses paid by the college.\n\nCombined with its graduate degree programs, the Michigan State University College of Education has also earned competitive training grants to provide paid fellowship opportunities in key areas. This includes the Michigan State Interdisciplinary Training in Education and Social Science (MITTENSS) Fellowship, Project Hi2LD (Hybrid Interdisciplinary Training to Address High Intensity Needs of Students with Learning Disabilities), fellowships funded through the national Rehabilitation Services Administration (RSA) and fellowships funded through the National Center for Leadership in Intensive Intervention-2 (NCLII-2).\n\nMSU was one of the first pioneering universities selected to participate in the Teachers for a New Era (TNE) initiative, a landmark effort by the Carnegie Corporation to restructure teacher education and set national standards for excellence.\n\nResearch and outreach\n\nCollege of Education faculty members serve as investigators on research projects funded by a variety of agencies and organizations.\n\nThe CREATE for STEM Institute is a hub for innovation and collaboration among researchers committed to improving science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) education from grades K-16. CREATE for STEM is a joint endeavor of the colleges of Education and Natural Science at MSU.\n\nNine current and emeriti College of Education faculty members have been inducted into the National Academy of Education, a society honoring distinguished scholars for pioneering efforts in educational research and policy development.\n\nThree current College of Education faculty (and 11 emeriti faculty) have been inducted into the National Academy of Kinesiology. Representation as a Fellow highlights these scholars as a distinguished leader in the field.\n\nThe Education Policy Innovation Collaborative, or EPIC, launched in 2017 and became the go-to research center for the Michigan Department of Education as it seeks to learn how reforms work best. EPIC has received over $12 million in grants, including one to study the state’s controversial read by grade 3 law. Most recently, EPIC has produced a series of research reports on the impact of COVID-19 in K-12 schools.\n\nThe College of Education’s Office of K-12 Outreach provides professional development and resources for educators across Michigan in support of school improvement efforts.\n\nThe Early Learning Institute, created by faculty from the College of Education, provides a novel model of early intervention for low income students with autism in multiple locations. Kids spend half the day in one-on-one therapy and half in a regular preschool classroom with peers who do not have autism.\n\nMichigan State University became the host institution for the national research organization on school leadership, the University Council for Educational Administration (UCEA), in 2020. UCEA influences the work and training of K-12 educational administrators and represents scholars from over 100 member institutions.\n\nMichigan State University scholars lead journals that are influential in their respective fields, such as one of the editors-in-chief of include Higher Education (Brendan Cantwell), lead editor of Education Administration Quarterly (Gerardo López) and editor-in-chief of Measurement in Physical Education and Exercise Science (Nicholas Myers). MSU served as home to the leading journal in the teacher education field, the Journal of Teacher Education, from 2015-2018.\n\nCollege of Education faculty members are often named leaders of major national organizations. Current and previous leaders include: University Council for Educational Administration (Gerardo López, president 2019-2020 and Terah Venzant Chambers, president 2018-2019) and the American Educational Research Association (Barbara Schneider, president 2013-14).\n\nThe Department of Kinesiology is dedicated to the study of physical activity and sport across the lifespan, with a special emphasis on youth. In our research labs, MSU kinesiology scholars study topics ranging from the impact of physical activity for babies, re-learning how to move after a stroke, the effects of concussions and how exercise affects one’s ability to think clearly.\n\nThe MSU Institute for the Study of Youth Sports was originally created by the Michigan Legislature and is known as a respected source of knowledge on coaching and maximizing the benefits of sports for kids.\n\nMore than 100 teachers in Chicago and other urban areas participated in a fellowship focused on training leaders among STEM teachers. The program was funded by a $2.8 million grant from global tech company Wipro Ltd.\n\nMichigan State University researchers led the first-ever international study of mathematics teacher preparation, the Teacher Education Study in Mathematics (TEDS-M), which generated data from 17 countries.\n\nSixty school districts and 300,000 students participated in the $35 million PROM/SE (Promoting Rigorous Outcomes in Mathematics and Science Education) project, which was led by faculty at MSU."
