The sacrifices they laid upon the altar of freedom will never be diminished or forgotten.\n\nThe staff at our Texas State Veterans Cemeteries are there to help each Texas Veteran and their family at their time of need.\n\nTexas State Veterans Cemeteries are built through a partnership between the state of Texas and the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) and are managed by the Texas Veterans Land Board. They complement the six national cemeteries in Dallas-Ft. Worth, El Paso, Houston, Kerrville and San Antonio (2). Burial benefits at Texas State Veterans Cemeteries are identical to those for VA National Cemeteries."
