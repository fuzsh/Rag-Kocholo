        "text": "Marilyn (McCoo) refers to them as “the precursor group to The 5th Dimension,” they’re the Hi-Fi’s, later called the Vocals! Managed by none other than Ray Charles, their sound was vocal Jazz and one of their tunes (later re-recorded by The Friends of Distinction most excellently) is “Lonesome Mood.” In fact, this rare photo comes to Forever 5th Dimension courtesy of our good friend, Mr. Harry Elston of The Friends. LaMonte (McLemore) writes about a rollicking time with the group in his memoir “From Hobo Flats to The 5th Dimension” in the amusing chapter titled, “Hi-Fi Nights n’ Flights.” Pictured left to right: Harry Elston, Fritz Basket, Lawrence Summers, Rex Middleton (front, conductor), Marilyn McCoo and LaMonte McLemore.\n\n—Robert-Allan Arno\n\n“From Hobo Flats to The 5th Dimension,” the hip hit memoir available at Amazon:"
