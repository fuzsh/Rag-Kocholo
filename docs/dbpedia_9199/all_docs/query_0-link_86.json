        "text": "History\n\nIn 1985, Loveman’s began a tradition of recognizing ten of Chattanooga’s best dressed women for the personal sense of style and fashion. Since those early years, the award has evolved to symbolize the many extraordinary contributions women have made to our community. These women were actually Women of Distinction, too. In 1993, the Woman of Distinction award was presented for the first time to honor women who set themselves apart through their professional achievements and civic, cultural, philanthropic, human service, and environmental commitments to the community.\n\nSince 1983, more than 300 local women have been honored as Women of Distinction.\n\nA Woman of Distinction is one who:\n\nVolunteers her time to help improve the quality of life for others.\n\nEstablishes standards that inspire and encourage other women to achieve their full potential.\n\nProvides leadership and influences decisions that shape and define our city and community.\n\nThese women give of themselves through their time, energy, and talents to make a difference in our world. They are wives, mothers, sisters and friends. These Women of Distinction are representative of what every woman does-- -juggling professional careers, families, community service and philanthropic work.\n\nIn 2017, The American Lung Association closed its Chattanooga office. Believing that the recognition should be continued, a group of past Women of Distinction Chairs, came together to discuss the best way to sustain and even enhance the event. One of the most significant changes made was to give all of the proceeds to local healthcare entities supporting those dealing with lung and heart issues instead of it leaving the community as in years past."
