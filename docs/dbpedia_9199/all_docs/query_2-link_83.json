It meant a lot to me, because it showed my commitment and dedication to my schoolwork.\n\nTyra C., Class of 2022 National African American Recognition Awardee\n\nIt felt like I was getting recognition for all my hard work and allowed me to feel like I was part of an important group of people. This award means a lot to me, especially as an ethnic minority, who is used to not being in the light.\n\nVicky M., Class of 2023 National Hispanic Recognition Awardee\n\nWinning this award meant so much to me. It really validated all the hard work that I have put into my academic career and served as an encouragement to work even harder.\n\nElise Z., Class of 2023 National Hispanic Recognition Awardee\n\nI will be the first in my family to attend college. This recognition was a reminder I can do it. In addition, it has given me a sense of accomplishment and pride in myself.\n\nLiam B., Class of 2024 National Rural and Small Town & Hispanic Recognition Awardee"
