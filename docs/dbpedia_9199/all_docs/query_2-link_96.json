        "text": "Article\n\nWhy conflict isnât all bad and why no one ever deserves to be bullied\n\nIf you are in a relationship with another human being, whether itâs a good friend or just someone who sits next to you in school, the chances are pretty good that you will be in conflict with that person at some point or have already had a conflict with that person. Where there are two people in a relationship, there likely will be disagreements and changes.\n\nOne friend might want to play video games; the other might want to go outside. One friend wants to go shopping; the other really doesnât like shopping. Your classmate always wants to be first in line and so do you. Your brothers fight over who has a bigger part of their room, trying to make sure itâs exactly the same down to the inch. Things like that happen every day.\n\nConflict is a natural part of human relationships as people grow and change. Even though it can cause us stress and can hurt, conflict is not bullying. Conflict happens between two people who are equal in the relationship (think: friends or classmates or co-workers) but have two different points of view about whatâs going on. Sometimes this escalates into a disagreement thatâs so strong people become really emotional. There might be strong words used and lots of big feelings involved. It may take time to sort things out.\n\nIn conflict, when things are equal between people, both sides usually want the issue to be resolved. They donât want the conflict to keep going on; they want to make things better and they want the relationship to continue in a healthy way. Neither person wants to keep hurting the other, so both people will try to do things to improve the situation. Sometimes, conflict can even be helpful in a relationship that needs to change, providing an opportunity to improve something thatâs not going right between the parties.\n\nWith bullying, the person (or group of people) who is doing the bullying means to hurt the other person. The hurt or harm is done on purpose to make the bullying target feel like less of a person. There is always something unequal about the relationship between the two people; maybe the person bullying is physically stronger and creates fear because of that, or maybe the person bullying is more popular and has the kind of social power that can turn a whole group against one person.\n\nWhichever type of power a person with bullying behavior has, they will use it over the person who is being bullied to make them feel less than who they are. Of course, the person who is being bullied does not want this treatment and did nothing to deserve being treated this way.\n\nBullying scenarios might look like this: Someone convinces a group to tease another student based on their looks; someone threatens to beat a person up because of how they talk; somebody posts something untrue and hurtful online about someone else; or someone trips a classmate and makes everyone laugh at the person falling down. The harm is done deliberately and the intent is to cause the other person to suffer in some way.\n\nThe bullying behavior is usually repeated, or threatened to be repeated, over and over. Someone who is bullying may decide to leave out a friend by giving them the cold shoulder and excluding them from group activities. Someone may use a false statement or other mean word toward another every time they see them, or go on social media in an attempt to damage their reputation. Even the threat of behavior like this causes unwanted and undeserved pain for the target.\n\nThink about it this way:\n\nConflict, while sometimes uncomfortable, can be an opportunity for equal partners in the situation to learn how to solve problems. This will happen by both people working the problem out through healthy and positive means.\n\nBullying is done by someone perceived to be more powerful than the target and is unwanted, negative, and meant to cause harm to the bullying target through physically or emotionally damaging means that are repeated or threatened to be repeated.\n\nThe next time you are in a conflict with someone (and there will likely be a next time!), try and remember that inside every conflict is a hidden opportunity to make your relationship better by learning to speak up for yourself and express your needs. Remember that conflict between two human beings is normal and is bound to happen.\n\nRemember as well, that bullying is not the same as conflict. Bullying is meant to cause hurt or harm. Bullying is not something that anyone deserves to have happen to them and they have the right to feel safe.\n\nConflict Resolution\n\nThe difference between bullying and conflict is important to note, because conflict resolution or mediation strategies are sometimes misused to solve bullying problems. These strategies can send the message that both children are partly right and partly wrong, or that âWe need to work out the conflict between you two.â These messages are not appropriate in cases of bullying (or in any situation where someone is being victimized). The appropriate message to the child who is being bullied should be âBullying is wrong and no one deserves to be bullied. We are going to do everything we can to stop what is happening to you.â\n\nBullying and Conflict â Whatâs the Difference? | PACERTalks About Bullying: Season1, Episode 8\n\nSometimes people think that bullying and conflict are the same thing, but they aren't. In one way or another, conflict is a part of everyday experience, in which we navigate the complexities of how we interact. Typically minor conflicts donât make someone feel unsafe or threatened. Bullying, on the other hand, is a behavior with intention to hurt, harm or humiliate and the person targeted is not able to make it stop.\n\nConflict vs. Bullying - 60 second response | PACERTalks About Bullying; Season 3, Episode 8\n\nConflict vs. Bullying â Student Response Season 3, Episode 9\n\nTeen Perspective:\n\nIn one way or another, conflict is a part of everyday experience. Even if it is something small, which it typically is, there is the constant navigation of the complexities of human relationships. This is normal, and minor conflicts typically donât make someone feel unsafe or threatened.\n\nThe questions to ask yourself when you are unsure about the tone of a certain conversation or encounter to determine if it is bullying include:\n\nAre we equals in this situation?\n\nDo I feel victimized or targeted by an individual or a group?\n\nDo I feel safe?\n\nDo I feel that the person or group has intentionally hurt or humiliated me?\n\nSometimes, it can be easy to minimize a bullying situation because you donât really want to deal with the realities of what is happening to you. It is easy to get into a pattern of qualifying bullying as conflict in order to avoid facing the actual problem, when really it is something that you donât deserve and something that requires outside intervention. It can be helpful to ask these questions to yourself, as it can help you sort out the reality of your particular situation.\n\nBlog Post\n\nIs it a Conflict or is it Bullying? Helping Our Kids Learn the Difference.\n\nWritten by staff at PACER's National Bullying Prevention Center\n\nThird graders Nick and Kevin werenât close friends, but they played foursquare together every recess they could. They battled every point during games that were always loud because the foursquare group was serious about the game. There were often disagreements about fouls and rules but they were generally able to work it out. The adults on recess duty did a nice job of monitoring the players, and they carried laminated sets of rules in case the players needed “help” with disputes. Yet, “Itâs not fair!” was often shouted across the playground during recess.\n\nOne day Kevin came home and told his mother, Jennifer, that heâd been bullied. Jennifer, alarmed, asked for details.\n\n“Nick pushed me on the playground,” Kevin said. He told Jennifer that he and Nick had argued about a ball that was “on the line,” and that a teacher asked both boys to sit on the bench to cool off during the rest of recess. “Itâs not fair! He started it, but we both got punished,” Kevin said. Kevin didnât think that Nickâs apology was punishment enough.\n\nHad Nick bullied Kevin? Was Nick too aggressive, but not to the point of bullying Kevin? Or were both boys at fault? Jennifer wasnât sure what to think. She called the school to ask for more details.\n\nWhen a parent hears a story like this, it isnât always clear what has happened or what the consequences should be. Jennifer was torn between feeling she might not have heard the whole story, and wanting to fix things for Kevin.\n\nHere are some helpful ways to distinguish between a conflict and bullying behavior:\n\nConflict looks like:\n\nDisagreement or argument in which both sides express their views\n\nEqual power between those involved\n\nBehavior usually stops when one child realizes they are hurting another\n\nBullying looks like:\n\nIntent of behavior is to hurt, harm, or humiliate\n\nPerson bullying has more “power” such as being more popular or physically stronger\n\nNegative behavior continues even when hurt or harm occurs\n\nIt can be hard for parents when their children are involved in difficult, confusing situations. Nevertheless, itâs important for parents to realize that conflict between children is inevitable â and that sometimes their child wonât like or agree with the outcome. Parents can help their children handle these situations by:\n\nAsking open-ended questions about what happened\n\nListening more than talking\n\nOffering support\n\nHelping their child problem solve\n\nItâs easier for a child to confide what is happening to them when they know their parent is in their corner. Conflict situations are great teachable moments. Parents can help their children learn the skills necessary to express their own views and help create their own solutions.\n\nA cautionary note: if behavior crosses the line from conflict to bullying, itâs not up to the child being bullied to fix the situation. While it can be important for the child to help create a plan for change, adults are responsible for making and enforcing rules so that all the children involved are safe.\n\nPosted November, 2016\n\nYour Opinion Matters\n\nWe look forward to hearing from you!
