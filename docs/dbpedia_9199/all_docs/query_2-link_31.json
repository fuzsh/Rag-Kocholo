        "text": "The NSLS is the nation's largest accredited leadership honor society. Students are selected by their college for membership based on either academic standing or leadership potential. Candidacy is a nationally recognized achievement of honorable distinction.\n\nIn addition to this honorable distinction, the NSLS provides a step-by-step program for members to build their leadership skills through participation at their campus or online. Upon completion of the program, members receive their leadership certificate and take their place among the top student leaders at their campus and across the country. Members are able to list their affiliation on all statements of personal accomplishment, including their resume.\n\nMembership provides access to benefits including scholarships and awards, exclusive on-campus events, employer recruitment through an online job bank, and discounts on computers, textbooks, grad school prep courses, insurance, and much more.\n\nNomination criteria is determined by local Chapter Leaders and is based on GPA and/or leadership potential. Students invited to their school's chapter have earned distinction with their nomination but must complete the leadership program requirements to become inducted.\n\nPlease contact the advisor of your chapter to discuss the criteria of students that were invited to join your NSLS chapter this semester. Their contact information can be found on the inside of your invitation, on the right hand side toward the bottom of the page.\n\nOnce you have completed the steps to become an official member of the NSLS, your membership items are sent to your local Chapter Leaders to present to you during the induction ceremony. Your membership kit includes a shirt, certificate, car decal, pin, and plaque (if purchased during registration).\n\nWhen you join some organizations, the information you receive focuses on material, tangible benefits. The items in your membership kit are nice side benefits, but are not the real value you gain from achieving membership in the NSLS.\n\nThe intangibles that you gain from membership will drive your future and establish you as a leader among your peers, including:\n\nImproved self-esteem\n\nPeer leadership skills\n\nSustainable motivation and drive\n\nParadigms that will help you discover and achieve your dreams\n\nReal-world skills that will help you outperform your peers in the workplace\n\nA network of movers and shakers that are all a part of the drive to create lasting, positive change in the world\n\nAdditionally, you'll receive other benefits such as online resources, customized letters of recommendation for prospective employers or grad schools, graduation accessories that you may purchase and wear at your ceremony to display your NSLS membership, access to exclusive scholarships and awards, personal Success Coaches, and our entire Keynote speaker series.\n\nClick here to see a list and explanation of our membership benefits.\n\nYes, you are still able to join the NSLS and can accept your current nomination. Depending on your circumstances, you'll have one of two options. If the school you're transferring to has an active NSLS chapter, we can transfer your membership to that new chapter. If it does not have an active chapter, we can transfer your membership to our online chapter.\n\nIf you need assistance or would like to discuss your transfer options, please contact Member Experience here.\n\nIf you want to pay your membership fee using a check or money order, you can submit a paper application for membership to the National Office.\n\nTo submit a paper application, please visit www.nsls.org and enter your invitation code. Once you have accessed the online application and get to the payment section, you will see a link to the Paper Application.

If you have any questions, please don’t hesitate to let us know.\n\nOnce the National Advisor approves your online application, you're considered a pre-inducted member. You then go through our online leadership program to become an inducted member and receive numerous, NSLS-exclusive membership benefits.\n\nThe Online Chapter is the same as the program at local chapters, except you don't have to attend events in person and it can all be completed online at your convenience. In addition, rather than a campus advisor, you will be coached by an Advisor at the National Office. Participating in this program will enable you to receive NSLS-exclusive benefits, such as leadership training from the nation's top speakers and authors, personalized success coaching, impressive resume building, and more.

You can earn NSLS Induction by completing this training at your desired pace and on your own timeline.\n\nBy accepting your nomination, you will be well-positioned to maximize your leadership potential and distinguish yourself in the eyes of future employers.

These include opportunities for all members and exclusive benefits for those who achieve induction.\n\nClick here to see a full breakdown of our membership benefits.\n\nIn response to many students that have had challenges attending events on-campus, we developed an Online Chapter.\n\nThe Online Chapter is the same as the program at local campuses, except you do not have to attend events in person and it can all be completed online at your convenience.

A group of family, friends, or coworkers are needed to hold members accountable and offer feedback during this process. Members will work independently on accomplishing goals, and will submit bi-weekly goal write-ups discussing their goals, action steps, and progress. As with campus SNTs, participants may receive coaching prior to their submission being accepted.\n\nTo be eligible to order our Honors Stole and Cords for graduation, you must have completed all of your membership steps and have received credit for them online.\n\nTo check the status of your membership, log in to the Members Area and click on the \"Membership Status\" icon.

However, it’s important to understand which of these honor societies provide legitimate value. Below are some things to consider when deciding whether or not an honor society is legitimate:\n\nAccreditation\n\nAccreditation is a fundamental component that helps to determine whether or not an organization meets the minimum standards of quality. These standards are set by a governing body that reviews all organizations that seek accreditation.\n\nThe NSLS is fully accredited by Cognia (formerly AdvancED), and NSLS courses have been reviewed and recommended for credit reciprocity by ACE and NCCRS.\n\nTransparency\n\nTransparency in criteria for selection and accountability in impact to purpose. The NSLS meets the highest standards of verified social and environmental performance, public transparency, and legal accountability to purpose through its certification as a For Benefit Organization.\n\nEducational Investment\n\nLegitimate honor societies all require a one-time fee in order to join and gain access to the benefits offered. Upon joining the NSLS, you’ll have access for life.\n\nBetter Business Bureau\n\nLegitimate honor societies will be registered with the Better Business Bureau and will maintain the highest rating possible at A+.\n\nWork with Thought Leaders\n\nLegitimate honor societies will have strong ties and relationships with highly successful individuals and thought leaders across industries. They’ll be able to use these relationships to provide value to their members.\n\nSuccess Stories\n\nA legitimate honor society will be able to showcase member success stories. These stories feature how the honor society helped members prepare for, and succeed in, future endeavors.\n\nThe NSLS is fully accredited by Cognia (formerly AdvancED), a national accreditation agency which oversees the sub-regional accrediting bodies as the parent organization of:\n\n(1) The Northwest Accredited Commission (NWAC); (2) The North Central Association Commission on Accreditation and School Improvement (NCA CASI); (3) Southern Association of Colleges and Schools Council on Accreditation and School Improvement (SACS CASI)\n\nThe NSLS is the only honor society to achieve this distinguished accolade. This commitment to accreditation assures advisors, chapter leaders, members, parents, and the national education community that our institutional focus is on raising student achievement. We provide an engaging and enriching learning environment, maintaining an efficient and effective learning program that builds leaders who make a better world.\n\nNSLS courses have also been reviewed and recommended for credit reciprocity by both ACE and NCCRS. Through ACE, more than 1,700 colleges and universities have agreed to consider awarding college credit for NSLS courses. More than 1,500 colleges have done the same through NCCRS.\n\nIn addition to accreditation, the NSLS is also a certified B-Corp. These certifications are more rigorous than ACHS to obtain, and deeper in certification from the U.S. Department of Education and the national board of B-Corps. We currently offer fully integrated online learning, on-campus coaching, and dynamic leadership development. All of which are elements of a fully accredited educational organization.\n\nWhen you accept the invitation from your college to become a member of the NSLS, you’re becoming part of a community filled with driven individuals who are looking to make a positive change in the world through leadership. You’ll develop leadership skills and gain real-world experience through our accredited leadership program, working with peers and industry leaders along the way.\n\nBeyond this, there are many benefits that will make your NSLS membership worth it. These benefits include access to exclusive scholarships and awards, customized letters of recommendation, access to an online job bank, networking events, brand discounts, and more.\n\nTo learn more about all benefits the NSLS has to offer, visit our membership benefits page.\n\nTo learn more about members who have benefited from the NSLS, explore our member success stories.\n\nWatch as some of today’s notable names, including Mark Cuban, Barbara Corcoran, Richard Branson and more share insight on what it means to accept your nomination."
