        "text": "OMAHA, Neb. – College of Saint Mary (CSM) has been named a College of Distinction for the 2024-25 academic year, a prestigious honor that highlights its commitment to providing a high-quality undergraduate education that focuses on hands-on learning, strong student-teacher relationships, a vibrant campus life, and successful outcomes. This is the third straight year CSM has received this recognition.\n\nCSM was also named a Nebraska College of Distinction and a Catholic College of Distinction.\n\n“We are honored to receive this recognition, a testament to our unwavering commitment to providing an exceptional student-centered education,” CSM President Heather Smith said. “This accolade reflects the hard work and dedication of our faculty, staff and students and reinforces our mission to empower women through academic excellence and leadership development. At CSM, we strive to create an environment where every student can thrive and achieve their fullest potential.”\n\nAside from the overall undergraduate recognition, Colleges of Distinction also awards recognition in individual areas. CSM has earned recognition in the fields of Business, Education, Nursing, Career Development, and Equity & Inclusion.\n\nSince its founding in 2000, Colleges of Distinction has awarded schools for their successful implementation of high-impact educational practices and hands-on learning. Unlike traditional ranking systems based on numerical data, its rigorous selection process involves extensive research and detailed interviews with the institutions, accepting only those that adhere to the Four Distinctions: Engaged Students, Great Teaching, Vibrant Community, and Successful Outcomes. CSM has demonstrated exceptional performance in each of these areas, ensuring a supportive and enriching environment that equips students for future academic and career success.\n\n“A college degree opens the door to many opportunities,” said Tyler Schritter, chief operating officer at Colleges of Distinction. “But a truly worthwhile education prepares students to thrive once they walk through the door. College of Saint Mary’s curriculum encourages meaningful student-faculty collaboration through experiential learning that is relevant and applicable to the real world.”\n\nTo be listed among the Colleges of Distinction, CSM demonstrated its unique ways of helping students be active in their education.\n\n“We’ve never ranked our schools,” said Schritter. “No student is alike, so there can’t be a number-one school for everyone. We are much more focused on the innovative ways colleges offer their brand of a truly rich undergraduate education.” CSM’s individual approach to education helps students achieve success in unique ways that cannot be ranked against others.\n\nTo learn more about CSM, visit CSM.edu."
