        "text": "Abi Heller-Wight\n\nPhD Candidate in MSIA – Patient Oriented Research\n\nNIH Ruth L. Kirschstein National Research Service Award (NRSA) Individual Predoctoral Fellowship (2024-2028)\n\nThe NIH National Institute on Aging (NIA) offers Kirschstein National Research Service Award Individual Predoctoral MD/PhD Fellowships (F30 NSRAs) to support promising doctoral candidates to perform dissertation research and training for an MD/PhD degree in a scientific health-related field relevant to the mission of the NIA, with specific funds dedicated to Alzheimer's disease and related dementias. Abi Heller-Wight, an MD/PhD Scholar at UNMC, has been awarded a 5-year F30 NSRA from the NIA for her project, “Measuring neurodevelopmental effects of genetic risk for Alzheimer’s disease via cross-sectional study of brain, cognitive, and physical fitness variables in periadolescent children.” Alzheimer’s Disease (AD) is typically considered a disease of older adulthood, however the influence of modifiable and non-modifiable risk factors, beginning in childhood, significantly influence AD development later in life. Through a novel, multimodal approach, Abi’s project aims to collect data related to brain development (cognitive, brain imaging), modifiable risk factors (physical activity, cardiorespiratory fitness) and non-modifiable risk factors (APOE-ε4 allele status) in order to understand early-life vulnerabilities that effect AD risk. Characterizing the development of AD-vulnerable brain systems, and how these risk factors influence them, could lead to new insights regarding early-life risk stratification and disease prevention. Abi is a PhD candidate in the MSIA Patient Oriented Research doctoral program under the supervision of David E. Warren, PhD, in the Department of Neurological Sciences.\n\nLouise Dow\n\nPhD Candidate in Pharmaceutical Sciences\n\nAmerican Chemical Society, Medicinal Chemistry Division predoctoral fellowship (2024-2025)\n\nThe American Chemical Society (ACS), Medicinal Chemistry (MEDI) Division predoctoral fellowship aims to promote the development of promising young scientists engaged in predoctoral training programs in medicinal chemistry and drug discovery at US institutions. Through the predoctoral fellowship program the MEDI Division supports the training and development of scientists to continue the discovery and development of novel therapeutic agents. Louise Dow was awarded a one-year MEDI predoctoral fellowship for her project \"Identification of 17β-Hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 10 Modulators as A New Therapy for Alzheimer’s Disease.\" Alzheimer's disease is one of the most prevalent neurological disorders worldwide, and due to the multiple hallmarks contributing to disease development and progression, it is likely a multifaceted approach will be required to develop therapeutics. Thus, the identification of next-generation drugs remains imperative. Louise's project focuses on the mitochondrial enzyme 17β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 10 which was identified to bind amyloid beta and potentiate its toxicity. The aim of this work is to identify new and improved compounds possessing the ability to modulate this enzyme and translate into a cytoprotective effect by preventing the production of reactive oxygen species, DNA fragmentation, and cell death. Louise Dow is a PhD candidate in the Pharmaceutical Science Graduate Program under the guidance of Paul Trippier, PhD, Associate Professor in the Department of Pharmaceutical Sciences and Co-Director of the T32 Training Program in Alzheimer’s Disease and Related Dementias Drug Discovery.\n\nFlobater Gawargi\n\nPhD Candidate in IGPBS – Integrative Physiology & Molecular Medicine\n\nAmerican Heart Association Predoctoral Fellowship (2024-2025)\n\nThe American Heart Association (AHA) Predoctoral Fellowship program promotes the integrated research and clinical training of promising students in predoctoral or clinical health professional degree training programs and who intend careers as scientists, physician-scientists or other clinician-scientists, or related careers aimed at improving global cardiovascular, cerebrovascular and brain health. Flobater Gawargi was awarded a two-year AHA fellowship for his project “Iron Homeostasis and Cell Death in the T1DM Heart.” Flobater’s project will investigate the disruption in iron homeostasis caused by diabetes, including ferroptosis—a cell death process characterized by iron accumulation and lipid peroxidation. This study not only seeks to unravel the mechanisms of diabetes-associated ferroptosis but also strives to discover therapeutic strategies to restore balance and prevent diabetes-induced cardiac damage. Flobater is a Ph.D. candidate in the IGPBS-Integrative Physiology & Molecular Medicine doctoral program working under the supervision of Dr. Paras Kumar Mishra, Associate Professor in the Department of Cellular and Integrative Physiology.\n\nAaron Schwab\n\nPhD Candidate in MSIA - Clinically Reevent Basic Research\n\nNIEHS Ruth L. Kirschstein National Research Service Award (NRSA) Individual Predoctoral Fellowship (2023-2028)\n\nThe NIH National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences (NIEHS) offers Kirschstein National Research Service Award Individual Predoctoral MD/PhD Fellowships (F30 NSRAs) to support promising doctoral candidates to perform dissertation research and training for an MD/PhD degree in a scientific health-related field relevant to the mission of the NIEHS. Aaron D. Schwab, an MD/PhD Scholar at UNMC, has been awarded a 5-year F30 NSRA from the NIEHS for his project, “Targeting the ACOD1 immunometabolic pathway of lung myeloid cells to reduce environmental exposure-induced lung disease.” Environmental lung diseases are preventable disorders caused or made worse by inhaled exposure(s) to inflammation-inducing aerosolized agents. Anthropogenic climate change and associated industrial and agricultural intensification synergistically elevate worker and non-worker risk of adverse respiratory health outcomes. Despite advances in understanding the key inflammatory signaling pathways initiating the lung inflammatory response, there remains a paucity of efficacious therapeutic options to hasten recovery and halt progression towards chronic disease. Therefore, this project will utilize an immunometabolic approach, with emphasis on the cis-aconitate decarboxylase 1 (ACOD1)-itaconate axis, to describe the biologic mechanisms underpinning environmental exposure-induced inflammatory lung disease, and potentially inform novel therapeutic approaches to hasten lung recovery post-inflammatory bioaerosol exposure. Aaron is a PhD candidate in the MSIA Clinically Relevant Basic Research doctoral program under the supervision of Jill Poole, MD, in the Department of Internal Medicine, Division of Allergy and Immunology.\n\nDelia Omar\n\nPhD Candidate in IGPBS – Integrative Physiology & Molecular Medicine\n\nAmerican Heart Association Predoctoral Fellowship (2024-2025)\n\nThe American Heart Association (AHA) Predoctoral Fellowship program promotes the integrated research and clinical training of promising students in predoctoral or clinical health professional degree training programs and who intend careers as scientists, physician-scientists or other clinician-scientists, or related careers aimed at improving global cardiovascular, cerebrovascular and brain health. Delia Omar was awarded a two-year AHA fellowship for her project, entitled “Regulation of Lipid Droplets by Endosomal Sorting Complexes in Liver Steatosis”. This project will investigate the mechanisms underlying hepatic lipid droplets (LDs) accumulation and degradation, by identifying the correlation between Endosomal Sorting Complexes (ESCRTs) with LDs biogenesis and catabolism within mammalian hepatocytes. The central hypothesis is that specific ESCRT proteins play diverse roles in lipophagy and LDs biogenesis critical for hepatocyte metabolism. Understanding these mechanisms will have significant impact in discovering new therapeutic strategies for targeting liver steatosis and improve cardiovascular health.\n\nDelia is pursuing her dissertation research in the IGPBS - Integrative Physiology & Molecular Medicine program under the supervision of Micah Schott, PhD, Assistant Professor in the Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology.\n\nGabrielle Watson\n\nPhD Candidate in IGPBS – Immunology, Pathology, and Infectious Disease\n\nAmerican Heart Association Predoctoral Fellowship (2024-2025)\n\nThe American Heart Association (AHA) Predoctoral Fellowship program aims to enhance the integrated research and clinical training of promising students in predoctoral training programs who intend careers as scientists or related careers aimed at improving global cardiovascular, cerebrovascular and brain health. Gabrielle Watson was awarded a two-year AHA fellowship for her project, entitled “Identification of Arginine Transporters in Staphylococcus aureus.” This project will explore the function of arginine transport during the establishment of a S. aureus infection, which is the leading cause of infective endocarditis in North America accounting for nearly 40% of cases. Arginine is required for S. aureus survival and, during the initiation of infection, arginine biosynthesis is repressed therefore the bacteria are dependent upon arginine transporters to acquire arginine from the host. The data generated will provide further insight into the pathometabolism of S. aureus and will inform systems biology approaches to determine novel methods to inhibit serious staphylococcal disease. The innovative nature of this application lies in the utilization of microbiological techniques to identify transporters we hypothesize are critical for growth and survival in the host as shown with various pathogens. Gabrielle is a PhD candidate in the IGPBS-Immunology, Pathology, and Infectious Disease program, working under the supervision of Paul D. Fey, in the Department of Pathology, Microbiology, and Immunology.\n\nMorgan T. Busboom\n\nPhD Candidate in MSIA – Patient Oriented Research\n\nNIH Ruth L. Kirschstein National Research Service Award (NRSA) Individual Predoctoral Fellowship (2023-2025)\n\nThe NIH National Institutes on Aging (NIA) offers Kirschstein National Research Service Award Individual Predoctoral PhD Fellowships (F31 NSRAs) to support promising doctoral candidates who are obtaining specialized, mentored research training from preeminent faculty sponsors while completing dissertation research. Morgan Busboom has been awarded a 2-year F31 for her project “Robotic Exoskeleton Gait Training in Transition Aged Persons with Cerebral Palsy.” Cerebral palsy (CP) is one of the most prevalent and costly developmental disabilities in the United States. Current research and therapeutic interventions related to mobility for transition aged persons with CP is relatively sparse. With this project, Morgan will use a novel robotic exoskeleton gait training protocol and neuroimaging to probe a potential paradigm shifting therapeutic approach that will drive beneficial neuroplasticity in transition aged persons with CP. Morgan is a PhD candidate in the MSIA – Patient Oriented Research doctoral program under the supervision of Max Kurz, PhD, Director of the Physiology of Walking and Engineering Rehabilitation Laboratory at Boys Town National Research Hospital.\n\nAmanda Macke\n\nPhD Candidate in IGPBS – Biochemistry & Molecular Biology\n\nKirschstein National Research Service Award Individual Predoctoral PhD Fellowships (2023-2024)\n\nThe NIH National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism (NIAAA) offers Kirschstein National Research Service Award Individual Predoctoral PhD Fellowships (F31 NSRAs) to support promising doctoral candidates in their mentored training throughout the completion of their dissertation research in the area of alcohol research. Amanda Macke has been awarded a 2-year F31 award for her project, “The impact of alcohol-induced ATF6-mediated ER stress and Golgi disorganization on pro-metastatic glycosylation of integrins in prostate cancer.” Growing epidemiological evidence indicates a link between alcohol consumption and prostate cancer risk, but the mechanisms of alcohol’s effect on prostate cancer growth remain to be elucidated. Amanda’s research is investigating this critical gap to identify proteins and cellular events affected by alcohol, including increased Integrin αv expression on the plasma membrane and fragmented Golgi morphology. This will elucidate events responsible for alcohol-mediated prostate cancer progression and inspire mechanism-based therapeutic strategies to prevent the effects of alcohol on tumor progression. Amanda is a PhD candidate in the IGPBS Biochemistry and Molecular Biology Doctoral Program under the mentorship of Armen Petrosyan, MD, PhD in the Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology.\n\nKyle L. McAndrews\n\nPhD Candidate in IGPBS – Cancer Research\n\nNCI Ruth L. Kirschstein National Research Service Award (NRSA) Individual Predoctoral Fellowship (2023-2025)\n\nThe NIH National Cancer Institute (NCI) offers Kirschstein National Research Service Award Individual Predoctoral PhD Fellowships (F31 NSRAs) to support promising doctoral candidates who are obtaining specialized, mentored research training from preeminent faculty sponsors while completing dissertation research. Kyle McAndrews has been awarded a 3-year F31 award for his project, “Oncogenic insults within the pancreatic ductal glands produce pre-malignant lesions and PDAC.“ A broader understanding of pancreatic cancer initiation and early progression is needed in order to detect this disease and intervene at earlier stages. Kyle is utilizing a transgenic mouse strain which was generated at UNMC to interrogate the tumor-initiating capacity of a specific population of cells in the adult pancreas. He is pursuing this work as a PhD candidate in the IGPBS – Cancer Research program under the guidance of Michael (Tony) Hollingsworth, PhD in the Eppley Institute for Research in Cancer and Allied Diseases.\n\nJake J. Son\n\nPhD Candidate in IGPBS – Neuroscience\n\nNCI Ruth L. Kirschstein National Research Service Award (NRSA) Individual Predoctoral Fellowship (2023-2027)\n\nThe NIH National Institute on Mental Health (NIMH) offers Kirschstein National Research Service Award Individual Predoctoral MD/PhD Fellowships (F30 NSRAs) to support promising doctoral candidates to perform dissertation research and training for an MD/PhD degree in a scientific health-related field relevant to the mission of the NIMH. Jake J. Son, an MD/PhD Scholar at UNMC, has been awarded a 4-year F30 NSRA from the NIMH for his project, “Impact of Trauma on the Longitudinal Development of Cognitive Control Networks in Healthy Youth.” Childhood and adolescence are critical developmental periods during which traumatic experiences can lead to impaired executive function and increased likelihood of psychopathology. While stress related brain aberrations have been widely noted, far less is understood about their developmental trajectory and whether the specific timing of the emergence of stressors may impact long-term function of brain networks related to cognitive function. Jake's research aims to fill this gap by utilizing cutting-edge brain mapping methods and longitudinal analytic tools to identify the impact of trauma exposure and HPA axis activation on developmental trajectories of cognitive control. He is pursuing this work as a PhD candidate in the IGPBS Neuroscience doctoral program under the supervision of Tony Wilson, PhD, Director of the Institute for Human Neuroscience at Boys Town National Research Hospital.\n\nHeidi Vieira\n\nPhD Candidate in IGPBS – Cancer Research\n\nNCI Ruth L. Kirschstein National Research Service Award (NRSA) Individual Predoctoral Fellowship (2023-2025)\n\nThe NIH National Cancer Institute (NCI) offers Ruth L. Kirschstein National Research Service Award Individual Predoctoral MD/PhD Fellowships (F30 NSRAs) to support promising doctoral candidates to perform dissertation research and training for an MD/PhD degree in a scientific health-related field relevant to the mission of the NCI. Heidi Vieira, an MD/PhD scholar at UNMC, has been awarded a 3 year F30 NSRA from the NCI for her research project entitled “Molecular control of tumor-initiating cells in Ras-driven cancers.” Cancer recurrence can be mediated by a distinct, treatment-resistant subpopulation of cells. Heidi’s research project aims to understand the cellular mechanisms that promote the formation and maintenance of these tumor-initiating cells in cancers driven by oncogenic Ras and to develop strategies to selectively target them. Heidi is a PhD candidate in the Cancer Research Doctoral Program, pursuing her dissertation research under the mentorship of Robert E. Lewis, PhD, Professor in the Eppley Institute for Research in Cancer and Allied Diseases.\n\nWeilun Ai\n\nPhD Candidate in IGPBS – Integrative Physiology & Molecular Medicine\n\nAmerican Heart Association Predoctoral Fellowship (2023-2024)\n\nThe American Heart Association (AHA) Predoctoral Fellowship program enhances the training of promising students in pre-doctoral or clinical health professional degree training programs and who intend to pursue careers as scientists, physician-scientists, other clinician-scientists, or related careers aimed at improving global health and well-being. Weilun was awarded a two-year AHA predoctoral fellowship for his project entitled, “The role of thromboxane-prostanoid receptor in alcoholic cardiomyopathy.” The central hypothesis of Weilun’s research is that the thromboxane-prostanoid receptor mediates alcohol-induced myocardial dysfunction by inducing myocardial steatosis and impairing mitochondrial function. Understanding how thromboxane-prostanoid receptor signaling promotes alcoholic cardiomyopathy is essential for the development of therapeutic agents for the treatment of alcoholic cardiomyopathy. Weilun is pursuing his dissertation research in the IGPBS - Integrative Physiology & Molecular Medicine program under the supervision of Saraswathi Viswanathan, PhD in the UNMC Department of Internal Medicine, Division of Diabetics, Endocrinology & Metabolism.\n\nKajal Kamra\n\nPhD Candidate in IGPBS – Integrative Physiology & Molecular Medicine\n\nAmerican Heart Association Predoctoral Fellowship (2022-2023)\n\nThe American Heart Association (AHA) Predoctoral Fellowship program promotes the integrated research and clinical training of promising students in predoctoral or clinical health professional degree training programs and who intend careers as scientists, physician-scientists or other clinician-scientists, or related careers aimed at improving global cardiovascular, cerebrovascular and brain health. Kajal Kamra was awarded a two-year AHA fellowship for her project, entitled “Novel mechanism of neural control of breathing in acute lung injury.” This project will utilize integrative physiological strategies to explore a novel mechanism through lung spinal afferent nerves that may mediate breathing after acute lung injury (ALI). Moreover, because the occurrence and progression of ALI are heightened in patients with underlying pre-existing cardiovascular disease, she will also determine the role of pulmonary spinal afferent nerves in mediating respiratory abnormalities in the ALI animal model with and without pre-existing myocardial infarction. Identification and further understanding of this novel mechanism will provide important information for the long-term goal of developing novel targeted therapeutic approaches to improve clinical outcomes in cardio-pulmonary diseases. Kajal is pursuing her dissertation research in IGPBS Integrative Physiology & Molecular Medicine under the supervision of Hanjun Wang, MD, Associate Professor in the Department of Anesthesiology.\n\nItidal Reslane\n\nPhD Candidate in IGPBS – Immunology, Pathology, and Infectious Disease\n\nAmerican Heart Association Predoctoral Fellowship (2023-2024)\n\nThe American Heart Association (AHA) Predoctoral Fellowship program promotes the integrated research training of promising students in predoctoral training programs and who intend careers as scientists, physician-scientists or other clinician-scientists, or related careers aimed at improving global cardiovascular, cerebrovascular and brain health. Itidal Reslane has been awarded a two-year AHA grant titled “Arginine Biosynthesis is essential for Staphylococcus aureus persistence within the kidneys.” Staphylococcus aureus can infect all organ systems of the human host. Survival and persistence require adjustment of central metabolic pathways in response to aerobic and anoxic environments in addition to differing carbon and nitrogen sources. Although S. aureus encodes biosynthetic pathways to synthesize arginine, it remains a functional auxotroph when grown in a chemically defined medium lacking arginine. It has been shown that 54% of S. aureus clinical isolates collected from diverse sites of infection can grow in medium lacking arginine (arginine prototrophs). Itidal’s research demonstrates that mice challenged with S. aureus exhibit a chronic kidney infection that persists indefinitely, while the infection is typically resolved within the liver, spleen, and heart within two weeks. Furthermore, her preliminary data show that S. aureus arginine prototrophs are readily isolated only from kidneys 20 days post-infection. Collectively, these data suggest that arginine prototrophs are selected within the kidneys facilitating the persistence of S. aureus within the renal abscess. Itidal will now test the hypothesis that mutations that facilitate arginine biosynthesis in S. aureus are selected within a persistent renal abscess. Itidal’s study will begin to uncover metabolic pathways that are critical for the survival of S. aureus in specific niches of the host. The data generated from this investigation will provide a better understanding of the staphylococcal metabolism in-vivo which is essential to develop novel therapeutic agents that disrupt specific metabolic and essential nutrient acquisition pathways. Itidal is a PhD candidate in the IGPBS – Immunology, Pathology, and Infectious Disease program, working under the mentorship of Paul D. Fey, PhD, in the Department of Pathology and Microbiology.\n\nRebecca A. Slotkowski\n\nPhD Student in MSIA - Patient-Oriented Research\n\nNIMHD Ruth L. Kirschstein National Research Service Award Individual Predoctoral Fellowship (2022-2027)\n\nThe NIH National Institute on Minority Health and Health Disparities(NIMHD) offers Kirschstein National Research Service Award Individual Predoctoral MD/PhD Fellowships (F30 NSRAs) to support promising doctoral candidates to perform dissertation research and training for an MD/PhD degree in a scientific health-related field relevant to the mission of the NIMHD. Rebecca Slotkowski, an MD/PhD Scholar at UNMC, has been awarded a 5-year F30 NSRA from the NIMHD for her project, “SPARKLED: Social Programming Affects Risk in Kids of Latent Endothelial Disease.” Heart problems are the number one cause of pregnancy-related death in the United States and most profoundly affect poor and non-White women. Social health programming can help people lead healthier lives by teaching them about stress management and healthy diets, which can help prevent heart disease later in life. Rebecca’s research project is focused on determining how social health programming for teenagers can empower communities across the United States to overcome barriers to health and reduce the long-term burden of adult heart disease during pregnancy. She is pursuing this work as a PhD candidate in the MSIA Patient Oriented Research doctoral program under the supervision of Ann Anderson Berry, MD, PhD, Professor in the Department of Pediatrics, Division of Neonatology."
