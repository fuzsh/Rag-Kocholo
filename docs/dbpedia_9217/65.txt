Uganda fell under British rule in 1890 with the British East Africa Company administering the region. A British protectorate over Buganda was declared in 1894, and over Bunyoro-Kitara, Tooro, Ankole and Busoga in 1896. This area became part of the British East Africa Protectorate on July 1, 1895, which was separated into British East Africa (Kenya) and the Uganda Protectorate in 1903. Uganda gained its independence on October 9, 1962 and became a republic on October 9, 1963.

Cowrie shells had been used in Uganda during the Nineteenth Century, and the British set an official exchange rate of 1 Penny equal to 50 Cowrie Shells. Beginning in 1895, the Imperial British East Africa Company minted coins denominated in Rupees, Annas and Pice, following the British Indian monetary system. The coins were decimalized in 1906 when coins were issued in the name of the British East Africa and Uganda Protectorates with 1 Rupee = 100 cents.. Indian coins circulated in Uganda until their importation was made illegal on July 31, 1920.

The East Africa Currency Board of Nairobi was established to provide a medium of exchange for British East Africa (Kenya, Tanzania and Uganda). On July 31, 1920, the Florin (XEAF) replaced the Rupee, equal to two British Pound Shillings or one Indian Rupee and divisible into 100 Cents. On June 8, 1921, the East Africa Shilling (XEAS), equal to half a East African Florin and one British Shilling Sterling, and also divisible into 100 Cents, replaced the East Africa Florin.

The East African Shilling continued to be used until September 14, 1967 when Uganda introduced the Uganda Shilling (UGS) at par with the East Africa Shilling). Inflation in the 1980s led the introduction of a new Shilling (UGX) on May 15, 1987 with 1 New Shilling equal to 100 Old Shillings. The Rupee, Florin and Shilling were each divided into 100 Cents. The Bank of Uganda, which was established on May 28, 1966 and began operations on August 15, 1966, is the sole note-issuing authority for Uganda.
