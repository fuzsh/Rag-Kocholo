        "text": "I thought ranking and categorizing currencies was a rare process, only of interest to Risk Managers and Traders. So I thought until I read a short article on this topic, did not much agree with the methodology nor results; and hardly learned one thing: perceptions about African currencies are more diverse (sometimes erroneous) than I was thinking.\n\nWe have worldwide about 161 currencies, including 42 from Africa. This appears on the high side, should we consider the economic power of the continent, fortunately still on track for more integration.\n\nHere is a quick overview of currencies in this regions, to open discussions dealing with the risks and opportunities for businesses.\n\nWhat can we call a strong currency?\n\nGood definitions have been refined for several thousand years. Therefore, we may only add some precision relevant to our context.\n\nFor me, it is one that keeps essentially its value in a liberalized market, and supports international trade, as a transaction currency, or efficient means of acquiring one.\n\nThis is supported by:\n\n- strong economic fundamentals (growth, investment, inflation…), a competitive and diversified economy;\n\n- a good commercial balance;\n\n- a disciplined reserve management, or at least ability to maintain sufficient reserves to face shocks;\n\n- Political stability;\n\n- an independent central bank with sound governance, and the effectiveness of its interventions;\n\n- atomicity or sufficient fragmentation of volumes between market participants.\n\nThis interacts with:\n\n- Non-vulnerability to speculation;\n\n- Attraction of foreign investment;\n\n- Etc.\n\nThere are many moving parts, not limited to the above list, which setup varies depending on the countries and time horizon. I remember spending some time crunching weather forecasts, as I was reworking inflation, interest rate and FX forecasts. Those positions performed even better…\n\nConsidering the number of currencies that we are here looking at, we will take a shortcut cascading parameters, weighting and rating all the above. Indeed, this is already done and factored-in by market participants in their volumes of demand and supply of these currencies, and impacted on the FX rates.\n\nAs one would expect, the LEVEL of a rate is not meaningful here (one GHS being worth 1.5 Yuan does not imply that the Cedi is stronger)\n\nFrom the volatility and depreciation trend of each currency over the past 5 years in IMF Special Drawing Rights (XDR) terms, we can derive the classification presented below.\n\nXDR is a composite of the following prices, (with the benefit of reflecting better the settlement currency of our trade flows):\n\nUS Dollar 41.73%\n\nEuro 30.93%\n\nYuan (Renminbi) 10.92%\n\nJapanese Yen 8.33%\n\nBritish Pound 8.09%\n\nTier 1:\n\nSeychelles Rupee\n\nMoroccan Dirham\n\nMauritius Rupee\n\nCFA Franc BCEAO\n\nComoro Franc\n\nCFA Franc BEAC\n\nKenyan Shilling\n\nTier 2:\n\nEthiopian Birr\n\nRwanda Franc\n\nBotswana Pula\n\nAlgerian Dinar\n\nTanzanian Shilling\n\nUganda Shilling\n\nMalagasy Ariary\n\nTunisian Dinar\n\nEritrean Nakfa\n\nNot rated (see reservation 2 below):\n\nBurundi Franc\n\nLiberian Dollar\n\nGuinea Franc\n\nCongolese Franc\n\nMauritanian Ouguiya\n\nTier 4:\n\nGambian Dalasi\n\nSudanese Pound\n\nSierra Leonean Leone\n\nAngolan Kwanza\n\nSouth African Rand\n\nNamibia Dollar\n\nSwazi Lilangeni\n\nLesotho Loti\n\nTier 5:\n\nEgyptian Pound\n\nGhanaian Cedi\n\nZambian Kwacha\n\nMozambican Metical\n\nNigerian Naira\n\nMalawi Kwacha\n\nSome reservations:\n\n1) This tiering might be somewhat improved by 'upgrading' further currencies that have a liquid market of hedging instruments (typically the Rand). This was done though, by only one step.\n\n2) currencies which countries appear in Yellow on the map, did not depreciate significantly, however, some convertibility issues signal that under a more freely floating regime, a broader depreciation would have materialized.\n\nOne could argue that the same applies to the CFA franc, however no convertibility issues were observed there, for eligible transactions.\n\n3) Yes,… this classification results from a Quick Scan, that could surely do with some adjustments.\n\n‘Geometry is the art of correct reasoning from incorrectly drawn figures’ – Henri Poincare.\n\nWe will agree that this may apply in some other fields too.\n\nKey observations:\n\n1)\n\nBy the criteria used here, 'Tier 1' currencies, used by a whopping 19 countries, would be in the same range as the currencies of emerging economies, Pakistani Rupee, Indian Rupee, Thai Baht…\n\nThis is not so bad\n\n2)\n\nNot all, but many of concerned currencies have a conventional peg, to EUR for the francs, and interestingly to a EUR/USD composite for the Moroccan Dirham, which I find best in class.\n\nMost of these countries are engaging in further monetary integration plans, within respective regional economic union.\n\n3)\n\nTier 1&2 currencies (in the above schedule) include currencies such as Seychelles Rupee, Mauritius Rupee, Kenyan shilling, etc., which exchange regimes are all floating.\n\nEven where not a pure float, currencies in tier 2 include all economies rising in Africa: Ethiopia, Rwanda, Tanzania…\n\nThis validates the relevance of a competitive economy to the strength of the currency. It is not the other way around.\n\n4)\n\nCurrencies in tier 4-5 are characterized by either:\n\n- Their economy lacking diversification and Business environment competitiveness (Nigeria, Angola, etc.)\n\n- The choice or maintenance of a floating regime that the maturity of the economies might not be able to support yet; eventually exposing the currency to some level of speculation; (a more controlled regime, still allowing required devaluations, as eventually adopted in Nigeria, would have helped some of these economies, pending more structural solutions)\n\n- Political uncertainties of very different nature (Egypt, ZA…)\n\n5)\n\nStrongest currencies (even where the issuer has no commitment to pay holders of the currency offshore) are accepted in neighboring countries. This applies to the CFA franc, the Kenya shilling…\n\nSame applies to the Rand in Namibia, Swaziland and Lesotho, but essentially due to the Peg of these to the Rand.\n\n6)\n\nThere are tremendous business opportunities in most the countries, regardless of the currency classification. And for a company to reach a critical size of business, it will often be required to expand in various markets of the region.\n\nTherefore a Business focus would be:\n\n- to build adequate structures/resources to manage the volatility, convertibility risk etc. and seize the opportunities. (approaches surely vary somewhat depending on the industries: banks, Fintech companies or other multinationals expanding into the region);\n\n- to develop intra-regional trade and remittances, where the demand for services is still far from being met (idem, regarding the range of approaches and strategies);\n\nWhen transport infrastructures were limited to dromedary caravans, a good knowledge of constellations, and relatively smaller boats on the Indian ocean trade route, about 12 centuries back, Africa was already a Trade champion.\n\nColonial powers badly rewired the system, and the current reminiscences of the golden ages of Intra-African Trade, were from then essentially seen in the informal economy. This is just starting to change in many countries...\n\nThere is a wind of innovation, and more opportunities to be uncovered…\n\nThis is one of the reasons why we are so positive about the future of Africa. The rest is all about Acceleration, through strategic moves that are made -or not enough-, by companies, mostly from the private sector.\n\nGo Africa!"
