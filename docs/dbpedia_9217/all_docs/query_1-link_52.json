        "text": "§ 61. Mr. ORMSBY-GORE\n\nasked the Under-Secretary of State for the Colonies whether the decision regarding the change 600 of the currency in British East Africa from rupees to florins is final; when it will take effect; whether the new currency will extend to the Tanganyika territory; and whether all existing silver rupees, rupee notes, and rupee stamps will be withdrawn from circulation in both territories?\n\n§ Lieut.-Colonel AMERY\n\nThe decision to change the currency system in the East Africa Protectorate, Uganda, and the Tanganyika Territory from the rupee to the florin, fixed at one-tenth of the pound sterling, is final. The new currency will be put into circulation as soon as it is available in sufficient quantities. The existing silver coins and rupee notes will be withdrawn as rapidly as possible when the new currency is available, and steps will also be taken to replace those stamps the values of which are at present expressed in rupees.\n\n§ Brigadier-General COCKERILL\n\nIs not the effect of that decision to increase the debts of everyone of the settlers in East Africa by 50 per cent., since debts incurred at 1s. 4d. will be repaid at 2s.?\n\n§ Lieut.-Colonel AMERY\n\nIn so far as people are owners of sterling, and have to pay out of sterling funds here, I am afraid it does increase their indebtedness. In so far as they are owners of rupees, and have debts to repay, it diminishes it."
