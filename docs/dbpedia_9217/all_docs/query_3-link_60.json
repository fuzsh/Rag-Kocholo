OPENING STATEMENT OF HON. ROBERT MENENDEZ, U.S. SENATOR FROM NEW JERSEY The Chairman. Now the Senate Foreign Relations Committee hearing on ``Russia's invasion of Ukraine: Assessing the U.S. and International Response'' will come to order. Let me thank Secretary Nuland for coming before us today to testify on the crisis facing Ukraine, Europe, and the world and for being with us yesterday in a classified session so that all of the questions that members would want to ask, some which could not be conducted in this forum, could be answered. We appreciate you being there. In just 12 days, the world has changed. As we sit here, Ukraine is fighting for its life. A ruthless dictator is shelling civilians, refusing calls for diplomacy, and threatening the stability of a region. As of this morning, at least 470 Ukrainian civilians have lost their lives because of Putin's brutality. At least 29 of them were innocent children. The last 12 days have been an entire lifetime for the people of Ukraine, forced to leave their lives behind, spending days in subways and makeshift bomb shelters, fleeing from mortars with their children in hand, and sometimes they do not make it. The rest of the world is being called upon to stand with Ukraine to make this war untenable for the dictator in Moscow. The United States and much of the world has rallied with impressive urgency and coordination. I commend the Administration's efforts--the result of months of relentless diplomacy--to build a strong international coalition that has stood up and imposed sweeping costs on the Putin regime. To date, we, along with the European allies and partners and others, have levied serious costs that are already having a devastating effect on the Russian economy. The central bank of Russia is subject to unprecedented sanctions. The top banks in Russia are sanctioned along with Putin himself, and company after company is cutting off Russian ties. We have made clear that with this unjustified, unprovoked invasion, Putin has miscalculated. He has chosen to turn the Russian state into a pariah and to have the Russian people suffer as a result of it. I am afraid, and I hope I am dead wrong, that this may just be the beginning of the fight for Ukraine's existence. We are here and we are prepared to support the Ukrainian people, but it may be a long road. While the response of the past 12 days is valiant, it cannot be the end. Until Putin relents, we must keep the pressure on. That means holding Belarus and the Lukashenko regime to account for their role and acquiescence. It means continuing to squeeze Putin's oligarchs as well as the political elites and seizing their assets so they feel and respond to the pain. In some respects, Europe has been somewhat ahead of us on this score. I think we should be doing what Europe has done. It means ensuring every bank is cut off from SWIFT. It means pressuring those countries who have not yet ended economic ties or arms sales to do so. It means tariffs on non-oil imports and advocating for the private sector to follow the lead of some of our companies to divest and cease operations in Russia and, of course, it means staying laser focused on providing Ukraine every weapon, every piece of lethal assistance, every defense article possible, so that it can defend itself. Many of us are working to do just that as we speak and to respond urgently to the personal appeals of President Zelensky and the Ukrainian ambassador in Washington. I hope this week will result in a bipartisan demonstration of support for Ukraine through the omnibus bill as we heed their calls for additional assistance and weapons. We must also be thinking about the months ahead and recognize that the threat of Kremlin aggression is not going away. I believe we must engage in a revitalized diplomatic effort to counter Russian aggression not only beyond Europe's borders, but globally. Today, I am calling on the Administration to do just that. I have sent letters to the State Department's regional assistant secretaries asking that each detail their diplomatic strategies to counter Russia. This must be a global effort. We need to match our words with action to fend off Putin's attempts to tighten his grip around the world and grasp at political legitimacy. Most immediately, while I have broader concerns about the JCPOA, I am specifically concerned that returning to the JCPOA will benefit Russia economically at a time when the international community is committed to squeezing Moscow. I am also extremely concerned that the Administration would consider purchasing oil from Venezuela. The Biden administration's efforts to unify the entire world against the murderous tyrant in Moscow is commendable, but it should not be undercut by propping up a dictator under investigation for crimes against humanity in Caracas. The democratic aspirations of the Venezuelan people, much like the resolve and courage of the people of Ukraine, are worth more than a few thousand barrels of oil. These are extraordinary times and, yes, we are all looking for extraordinary measures in response, but we cannot lose sight of our core principles of our basic values. We must turn Putin back, out of Ukraine, and out of the regions across the world where his influence has grown. In closing, the people of Ukraine refuse to back down. Their cause is our cause because they should not have to fight. They should not have to flee their borders or leave their homes. They deserve to live and thrive in freedom. The fight for Ukraine is a fight for democracy, a fight for freedom, a fight against a murderous dictatorship, and we cannot forget that. Senator Risch. STATEMENT OF HON. JAMES E. RISCH, U.S. SENATOR FROM IDAHO Senator Risch. Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman, and thank you to Under Secretary Nuland for joining us today to discuss Russia's unprovoked, unwarranted criminal and murderous invasion of Ukraine. I also want to thank you for appearing yesterday and participating in our closed discussion on the issues. I think probably you were impressed, as I was, with the unanimity amongst Republicans and Democrats about how to approach this issue and what should be done about it. I also appreciated your agreement to convey the deep concerns that we had, on a bipartisan basis, on some issues that we are facing, and I truly appreciate that. I look forward to your information, today in open session, about the Administration's actions to help Ukraine, the additional sanctions on Russia we can expect, and what the U.S. is doing to assist the massive humanitarian crisis that is growing both inside Ukraine and in Europe. I also ask you to address the Administration's larger strategy for dealing with this crisis. My goal for security assistance to Ukraine is simple. Enable the Ukrainian people to expel the murderous invaders from their land and defeat Putin. I am disappointed the U.S. did not send more to Ukraine before the invasion began, but I am glad to see the vast amount of international military support Ukraine has received in the past 2 weeks. The U.S. has now sent healthy amounts of equipment to Ukraine. We all know they need more and they need it faster. The international outpouring of disgust at Putin's actions has enabled sanctions on Russia to be more effective than we predicted. There are still huge loopholes that must be closed. I am glad the Administration has cut off oil purchases from Russia. That said, it is imperative that we do not replace Russia's heavy crude with supplies from the dictators in Iran and Venezuela. We are in the enviable position of having the oil and gas reserves needed to increase production in our own country right under our own feet. It boggles my mind the Biden administration would pander to dictators when we can meet our own needs without blood on our hands. Secondary sanctions on banks that undertake transactions with Russia also have not yet been imposed. This leaves open many different avenues for Russia to continue its transactions as usual. As you know, I have been pushing for secondary sanctions since the beginning of this. I understand that the secondary sanctions are complex and I understand they must be handled delicately. Obviously, with the waivers that are always provided, secondary sanctions can be an excellent tool. I predict that secondary sanctions are going to have to be grabbed and put into place at some point in time, in the not too distant future. I also want to say a word about the people of Russia. We are not at war with Russia and we do not seek war with Russia. Putin has led the Russian people into disaster. I know how much Putin is suppressing his own people. I urge them to refuse to be complicit in his crimes. There is much ordinary Russian people can do to push back on Putin's ugly humanitarian crimes. On the humanitarian front, I applaud the work that State and USAID have done so far to prepare for and engage with the huge flow of refugees coming from Ukraine. The stream of refugees looks to be even larger than estimated. Our EU partners are very capable of dealing with this challenge, but we can certainly assist. I am particularly concerned about Moldova, one of Europe's poorest countries, which has one of the largest refugee populations per capita. It is struggling with high Russian- imposed energy prices and may have to deal with the activation of 1,500 Russian troops in its occupied region of Transnistria. This senseless invasion at the hands of a madman is a threat not just to the innocent people of Ukraine, but to all of us in the democratic world. This conflict has immense implications for the people of Ukraine. It also speaks to the credibility of the U.S. and the West to defend the freedom and sovereignty of countries that want to decide their own futures. We must do more to help the innocent civilians, women, and children who are dying each day, and the men and women who are fighting on the frontlines in a war they do not want. I think we all know this can and will get much worse, and I look forward to hearing more from you in this public forum about what more the Biden administration will do to respond to Putin and help the Ukrainian people. Finally, this struggle that Ukrainians are going through reminds us that freedom is not free, as we learned in our struggle to be a free people, and that the value of freedom cannot be measured, but its costs can be burdensome in the extreme. However, at the end of the struggle, there is no greater gift one generation can pass to the next generation than the gift of freedom. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. The Chairman. Thank you. Secretary Nuland, we will start with your testimony. There is a lot to cover so I normally say if you can try to summarize it in 5 minutes, but we will give you a little latitude and then there is, I am sure, by the attendance here you see there will be a lot of questions. So the floor is yours. STATEMENT OF THE HONORABLE VICTORIA NULAND, UNDER SECRETARY OF STATE FOR POLITICAL AFFAIRS, U.S. DEPARTMENT OF STATE, WASHINGTON, DC Ms. Nuland. Thanks very much, Chairman Menendez, Ranking Member Risch, and distinguished members of this committee for the opportunity to be with you here today and for the opportunity yesterday to talk in classified session to discuss Russia's premeditated, unprovoked, brutal attack on Ukraine and what the United States and our allies and partners are doing together in response. To start, let me first thank all the members of this committee and the vast majority of members of Congress for your strong bipartisan support for the brave and resilient people of Ukraine and their government over many years, but especially now in the face of Russia's bloody aggression. The United States, together with our allies and partners around the world, stand united in condemning Russia's war on Ukraine, a war that offends human decency, violates international law, and the core principles of democracy and international peace and security, and has created a catastrophic humanitarian crisis. As we speak, Ukrainian men and women fight for their lives, for their country, for their freedom in the face of President Putin's imperial ambitions. We honor their sacrifice and bravery. Slava Ukrayini; Heroyam Slava. First, what we are doing. We continue to provide defensive lethal security assistance to Ukraine. Just 10 days ago, President Biden and Secretary Blinken authorized the immediate delivery of an additional $350 million of military support, and I am pleased to say that two-thirds of that has already gotten into Ukraine and, in total, the Administration has provided more than a billion dollars in security assistance in just this last year. With Congress' bipartisan support, we are also facilitating third party transfers of weapons and have seen unprecedented international assistance to Ukraine from our allies and partners. Second, we are providing urgently needed humanitarian assistance to Ukraine and its neighbors. Working with the Government of Ukraine, U.N. agencies, humanitarian organizations, and European partners, the United States is providing food, medicine, hygiene supplies, health care, and protection services, shelter support and other assistance. Last week, Secretary Blinken announced an additional $54 million in U.S. assistance, and countries around the world have met the U.N.'s humanitarian appeal with an additional $1.5 billion in support. As you know, with 2 million refugees already and more than 1.2 million IDPs, needs will go up. Third, we have imposed severe sanctions on Russia's financial institutions, its oligarchs, and political leaders, including President Putin and his cronies. We have levied export controls on key industries and the Russian military in close coordination with almost 40 countries around the world, representing over half the world's economy, and those sanctions have had an immediate impact. We are seeing a continued flight of capital, a tumbling of the ruble--it has lost half its value--rising inflation, higher borrowing costs, and evaporating access for Russia to global financial markets. There is more on the way from the G-7, our EU partners, and countries around the world if President Putin does not end this vicious war. We are also working with our allies and partners to limit the disruption of global energy supplies and to prevent Russia from weaponizing its global energy exports while also accelerating diversification of energy supplies. We sanctioned the parent company of Nord Stream 2 and its CEO, and the German Government, as you know, has cancelled its support for the pipeline so that it will not become operational. We are also using all multilateral fora to rally the world in condemning Russia and Belarus. As you know, last week, a record 141 countries voted in favor of the U.N. General Assembly Resolution, calling for Russia to end its war and withdraw from Ukraine--a historic outpouring of support and international solidarity. Days later, the Human Rights Council overwhelmingly passed a resolution establishing a Commission of Inquiry to investigate and call out Russia's human rights abuses in Ukraine, and in close cooperation with our NATO allies, we are strengthening the defense and the deterrence of the alliance's Eastern Flank. Allies agreed for the first time in the alliance's history to give the Supreme Allied Commander authority to deploy NATO's response force, including its spearhead component, the Very High Readiness Joint Task Force--the VJTF--and it is already beginning to deploy. U.S. military personnel in Europe and in its waters now total approximately 100,000. We have more than doubled our U.S. forces in Poland and sent thousands of troops to the Baltics, to Romania, and elsewhere along the flank, along with advanced combat aviation. A number of our allies are also starting to flow forces to NATO's east to bolster their presence and to fulfill their NATO obligations. The message to Russia is clear. NATO is united and our commitment to Article 5 is iron clad. President Putin has not only attacked Ukraine, he has trashed the U.N. principle of self-determination of states and questioned Ukraine's very right to exist. He is testing the foundations of international law and he is testing all of us and NATO and the EU and the G-7 and democracies around the world. As President Biden said, we are now in a battle between democracy and autocracy, and free people, free nations, and a free Ukraine must prevail. As Putin tries to reduce Ukraine to rubble, he is also turning Russia into a prison. Credit cards and ATMs have stopped working, capital controls are biting deeply, imported food, technology, and other goods are drying up, and the last of Russia's free press has been strangled, all while the government hemorrhages money--money that belongs to the Russian people--to fund its war effort and to prop up the ruble. Last week, President Putin criminalized anti-war protests and efforts to support Ukraine. The so-called consultancy laws with Kyiv can result in 20 years in a penal colony. Thirty years of progress in Russia has been wiped out in just 12 days. This is a war launched by one man for his own twisted reasons. It is a war built on lies he has told the world, he has told his own people, and his military, and now it is a war also built on the suffering and grief of so many Ukrainians and also Russians--parents, spouses, partners, children--who will never see their loved ones again, all because of one man's evil choices. Ukrainians are fighting for their nation's survival, but they are also fighting for all of us and for the principles of freedom and democracy that are foundational for our nation and for our allies and partners. Together, we must do all we can to ensure Ukraine not only survives, but it thrives again. We in the Administration are proud to work with all of you towards that difficult, but righteous goal. Thank you. I look forward to your questions. [The prepared statement of Ms. Nuland follows:] Prepared Statement of Ms. Victoria Nuland Chairman Menendez, Ranking Member Risch, and distinguished members of the Committee, thank you for the opportunity to appear before you today to discuss Russia's premeditated, unprovoked, and brutal attack on Ukraine and what the United States and Allied partners are doing in response. To start, let me thank the members of this committee and the vast majority of Members of Congress for your strong bipartisan support for the brave and resilient people of Ukraine and their government over many years, but especially now, in the face of Russia's bloody aggression. The United States, together with our Allies and partners around the world, stand united in condemning Russia's war on Ukraine--a war that offends human decency, violates international law, and the core principles of democracy and international peace and security, and has created a catastrophic humanitarian crisis. As we speak, Ukrainian men and women fight for their lives, their country, and their freedoms in the face of Russian President Putin's imperial ambitions. We honor their sacrifice and bravery. Slava Ukrayini; Heroyam Slava [Honor to Ukraine; to its Heroes, Honor]. Our immediate focus has been to provide Ukraine the help it needs to defend its sovereignty, protect its democratic government, and support Ukrainians seeking aid and refuge. First, we continue to provide security assistance to Ukraine, including equipment needed to defend against threats from the air, from armored assault, as well as to ensure the people standing up to defend Ukraine have the body armor and medical support they need. On February 25, President Biden and Secretary Blinken authorized the immediate delivery of an additional $350 million in military support, and two- thirds of that has already gotten into Ukraine. In total, the Administration has provided more than $1 billion in security assistance in the last year and more than $3 billion since 2014. We continue to urge Allies and partners to contribute security assistance to Ukraine as swiftly as possible. With Congress's bipartisan support we are facilitating third party transfers of weapons and have seen unprecedented international assistance to Ukraine. Some of our closest allies and partners have made dramatic policy shifts and are providing lethal assistance for the first time. Second, we are providing urgently needed humanitarian assistance to Ukraine and its neighbors, led by a forward-based team of dedicated humanitarian response experts from USAID and the Department of State. Partnering closely with the Government of Ukraine, as well as UN agencies, humanitarian organizations, and European partners, the U.S. is providing food, medicine, hygiene supplies, health care and protection services, shelter support, and other assistance, including an emergency announcement last week of an additional $54 million in assistance to those affected by Russia's invasion. As with other forms of assistance, we are encouraged by the contributions of Allies and partners who continue to receive and support all those who are fleeing Ukraine, and who together have pledged nearly $1.5 billion in support of the UN's humanitarian appeal. Third, we have imposed severe sanctions on Russian financial institutions, oligarchs, and political leaders--including President Putin and his cronies--and levied export controls on key industries and the Russian military. We have taken these actions in close coordination with almost 40 countries--representing over half the world's economy-- and they have had immediate impact. We are seeing a continued flight of capital, a tumbling ruble, rising inflation, higher borrowing costs, and evaporating access to global financial markets. Additionally, with Allies and partners, we are launching a joint task force to hunt down and freeze the assets--including mega yachts and mansions--owned by sanctioned Russian companies, oligarchs, and government officials. And we're not done. There is more on the way from the G7 and our EU partners as early as this week if President Putin does not end his vicious war. We are also coordinating closely with our Allies and partners to limit disruption to global energy supplies and to prevent Russia from weaponizing its global energy exports while also accelerating diversification of energy supplies. And as President Biden promised, we sanctioned the parent company of Nord Stream 2, Nord Stream AG and its CEO, and the German Government has also cancelled its support for the pipeline, which will not become operational. We are using all multilateral fora to rally the world in condemning Russia and Belarus. As you know, last week 141 countries voted in favor of the UN General Assembly resolution calling for Russia to end its war and withdraw from Ukraine, a historic outpouring of support for and international solidarity with the Ukrainian people. Days later, the Human Rights Council overwhelmingly passed a resolution establishing a Commission of Inquiry to investigate and call out Russia's human rights abuses in Ukraine. At the Organization for Security and Co-operation (OSCE), we are resolved to hold Russia and its forces accountable for any and all human rights abuses, violations of international humanitarian law, and war crimes they commit in Ukraine--including sexual and gender-based violence, as we are seeing reports of this and other potential abuses. And in close cooperation with NATO Allies, we are adjusting our force posture to strengthen the defense and deterrence of the Alliance's eastern flank. Allies agreed for the first time in history to give Supreme Allied Commander Europe (SACEUR) authority to deploy the NATO Response Force (NRF), including its spearhead component, the Very High Readiness Joint Task Force (VJTF). In recent weeks, we have significantly increased U.S. military personnel positioned in Europe and its waters, which now total approximately 100,000. We have more than doubled our forces in Poland and sent thousands of troops to the Baltics, Romania, and elsewhere on NATO's eastern flank--along with advanced combat aviation. Several Allies including France, Germany, and the UK, have also bolstered their troop presence. The message to Russia is clear: NATO is united, and our commitment to Article 5 is ironclad. President Putin has not only attacked Ukraine, he has trashed the UN principle of the self-determination of states and questioned Ukraine's right to exist. He is testing the foundations of international law and he is testing all of us. He is testing the resolve of NATO, the EU, the G7, and democracies around the world. As President Biden said, we are in a battle between democracy and autocracy, and free people, free nations, a free Ukraine must prevail. As Putin tries to reduce Ukraine to rubble, he is also turning Russia into a prison. Credit cards and ATMs have stopped working; capital controls are biting deeply; imported food, technology, and other goods are drying up; international travel is getting difficult and expensive; the last of a free press plus Twitter, Facebook, and other social media outlets are strangled, all while the government hemorrhages state funds on the war effort and to prop up the ruble. And last week President Putin criminalized anti-war protests and all sympathy with Ukraine--so called ``consultancy'' with Kyiv can result in 20 years in a penal colony. Thirty years of progress in Russia has been wiped out in 10 days. This is a war launched by one man for his own twisted reasons. It is a war built on the lies he has told the world, his own people, and his military. And now it is a war built on the suffering and grief of so many Ukrainians--and Russians too--parents, spouses, partners, children--who will never see their loved ones again, all because of one man's evil choices. Ukrainians are fighting for their nation's survival. But they are also fighting for all of us and for the principles of freedom and democracy that are foundational for our nation and our allies and partners. Together, we must do all that we can to ensure Ukraine not only survives, but thrives again. We in the Administration are proud to work with all of you toward that difficult, but righteous goal. Thank you and I look forward to your questions. The Chairman. Thank you, Madam Secretary. We will start 5- minute rounds. Let me start off with a letter that the Ukrainian parliament has sent us, and I want to read one paragraph of it because I think it creates context for everything we are deciding. ``As you read this, Russian troops are indiscriminately shelling civilians, residential areas, schools, and hospitals. The aggressor is using weapons prohibited by the Geneva Convention and international humanitarian law such as cluster bombs and vacuum thermobaric bombs, intended to cause severe suffering to human beings, and when civilians try to escape the combat zones Russian soldiers shoot at humanitarian `green corridors,' turning them blood red.'' I ask unanimous consent that the letter be included in today's record, without objection. [Editor's note.--The information referred to above can be found in the ``Additional Material Submitted for the Record'' section at the end of this hearing.] The Chairman. The spokesperson for UNICEF has said 1 million children have fled Ukraine, calling it, ``a dark historical first.'' That spokesperson said, ``We have not seen a refugee crisis of this speed and scale since World War II, and this is a children's crisis.'' So against that backdrop, I understand that the Government of Poland a very little while ago, after consultations between their president and the government, are ready to deploy immediately and free of charge their MiG-29 jets and place them at the disposal of the United States of America. They have decided not to go directly, but--and, of course, they are--they have concerns about the backfilling of that at some point in time in some way. Can you speak to that and where we are at in that regard now that the Government of Poland has made that decision? Ms. Nuland. Chairman, I saw that announcement by the Government of Poland as I was, literally, driving here today. To my knowledge, it was not preconsulted with us that they planned to give these planes to us. As you know, we have been having consultations with them for a couple of days now about this request from the Ukrainians to receive their aircraft and were they to donate them whether we would be able to help support backfill in their own security needs. I look forward, when this hearing is over, to getting back to my desk and seeing how we will respond to this proposal of theirs to give the planes to us. The Chairman. They have moved forward now and they have said that their planes are now disposable. They are willing to give it. The one thing that we have heard consistently is a call for a no-fly zone. I understand the challenges of that--NATO and other countries not willing to engage in a direct conflict with Russia. Giving Ukrainians the wherewithal to fight over their own airspace and to be able to have some control over their airspace is, clearly, desirable. Now that Poland has made this decision and, it would be my hope, that other countries in the region as well, that we would be forward-leaning in finding a pathway forward because the one thing about all of this is time is of the essence. If we are going to make a difference, time is of the essence. Let me ask you this. We are doing all these sanctions. There is no one who has been an advocate of sanctions, generally speaking, and, certainly, in this case, more than I have on this committee. I am wondering about cryptocurrency because we are sanctioning all of the traditional financial and banking systems. Cryptocurrency is an opportunity for Russian oligarchs and others to move in a different direction. Are we having our Treasury Department and others think about how we deal with that challenge? Ms. Nuland. Mr. Chairman, we are. In fact, we have in the past, as you know, drained designated hacker wallets from Russia. We have other authorities that allow us to go after crypto. Not only are we looking at it ourselves, we are consulting with our European allies and partners on how we might do more together to close down this dangerous spigot of revenue. The Chairman. I think it is going to be one of the essential elements to continue to dry up every resource that Putin can have and to continue to tighten the noose--the economic noose--around his neck, at the end of the day. Lastly, what are we doing in having a full-scale assault? I said that I sent letters to all the regional secretaries. It seems to me that Putin should feel the consequences everywhere---- Ms. Nuland. Yes. The Chairman. --and that means whether it be Latin America or Asia or Africa, we need to be at the forefront of pressuring Russia in all of those continents, in all of those countries. Are we actively engaged in doing that? Ms. Nuland. Mr. Chairman, we are. Not only are we pressing every country that we speak to at the president and secretaries level and all the levels in the department, every single one of our ambassadors has instructions to work with their host nations to try to get them to match U.S. and EU and allied sanctions to the extent that they can and are willing to condemn Russia. You saw the vote in the UNGA--141 countries. There was significant, how should we say, diplomatic elbow grease went into that from allies and partners around the world. As you know, we have a number of big countries who have abstained from this fight so far and we are trying to use our influence with them as well to get on the right side of history. The Chairman. I hope they get on the right side of history. Some of them I like very much, but they need to get on the right side of history. Senator Risch. Senator Risch. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. First, I want to associate myself with the remarks of the chairman regarding the JCPOA. As I told you in the private session yesterday, I want to say it publicly here and I hope you will commit--you will transmit this to the Administration as you said you would yesterday. That is, there could not be a worse time for the Administration to be trying to come together on a JCPOA and announce it when we are in the middle of the mess we are in right now. The chairman mentioned reasons for it. There is another reason for it, obviously, and I think you saw that yesterday, how united we are as the United States Senate in helping Ukraine and what is going on diplomatically and otherwise, when it comes to this struggle. I cannot think of something you could do that would be worse to try to tear that apart than announce a JCPOA because we are going to be very divided on it. They started out saying it was going to be stronger and longer. There were two different bumper stickers, I guess. One was stronger and the other was longer. Both of those, as we know, are by the by. They then said, well, they were going to work to get less for less. That has gone by the by, and from what everything that is leaking out now, it sounds like it is going to be worse for worse. I just cannot fathom that we want to enter into that at this point. As the chairman properly notes, it is going to cause a tremendous amount of cash to be transmitted to the Russians as a result of a new JCPOA for the reasons he discussed. There is no logical reason to be doing that at this time. Look, this thing has been dragging on. I know that Administration wanted to immediately reverse what Trump had done and I get that. They have been at it now for a year and a half and it, certainly, can be put off for another 6 months. I am not asking that you end it. I know what you are going to do and I know--when I say you, I mean the Administration--I know what the Administration is going to do and I know how it is going to wind up. At least put it on ice for 6 months until we get this mess behind us. So that is the plea I have on the JCPOA. I think it would be in everybody's best interest to do that. As I talked about in our closed hearing yesterday, I hope you will focus on this. We hear a lot about Stingers. We hear a lot about the Javelin. We hear a lot about the Russian MiGs that other countries have. We would like to get into the fight. One thing that has not been discussed are other surface-to- air missiles between the Patriots, which are the big gun, and the Stingers, which are the small gun, I guess. I really think they could do some good with some of those intermediate missiles and I hope you will convey that to the Administration and work on that. Finally, let me just close with secondary sanctions. I know the Administration has not reached for the secondary sanction tool in their toolbox yet. I would say and I would urge, the minute we see somebody trying to get around these sanctions or somebody trying to actually do business with the Russians, the secondary sanctions need to come into play. They can be used surgically. They can be used in a targeted fashion so that we do not injure somebody through collateral damage, either us or one of our partners. That can be done easily with the waivers. So I would urge, again, that they keep that tool at the ready in case they need to use it, and if you want to respond to any of that you got a minute and 16 seconds. Ms. Nuland. Thank you, Ranking Member Risch. Let me just say with regard to the weapons that we are sending to Ukraine, as you know, we talked about some of this in classified session yesterday and we, generally, do not talk in specifics in an open session. With regard to other systems that we might be able to send, we are working very hard and fast on that now so--and we can speak further about it in another setting, if you would like. Senator Risch. That is good to hear. Ms. Nuland. With regard to secondary sanctions, I think you know that some of what we have done already, particularly, the export control constraints, has a global impact in the sense that anybody seeking to transfer American high-tech--any component--anything at all to Russia that has American high- technology in it, whether that country is Singapore or China or Germany or whatever, has to have a license. So that is our effort to create a global regime here. As I said, we are also seeking to get more and more countries to join us in as much of this regime as possible, but we will continue to look at all of these things that you raised. Look, we are not having a hearing about the JCPOA. I will simply say that there was extreme concern that this is not an issue that can wait, given Iran's acceleration of its development of technology towards a weapon, and the last thing we need is this war and Iran with a nuclear weapon. Thanks. The Chairman. Senator Cardin. Senator Cardin. Secretary Nuland, first of all, thank you very much, and we, certainly, appreciate the unity that the Biden administration has been able to achieve with our allies in the global community in isolating Russia and providing needed help to Ukraine and the Ukrainian people. So we talk about that there is strong agreement to supply Ukraine with the defensive lethal weapons they need, and we have done that and our allies have done that. Countries have done that. We have been pretty effective in getting that type of equipment to the Ukrainians. So I am a little bit baffled as to why it is taking so long in regards to aircraft getting into Ukraine. President Zelensky has made it clear he needs it. There is strong unity among all of us that we should be supplying that, and I know that you are not up to date as to the most recent announcements made by the Poles in regards to the aircraft being delivered to Germany. I would ask that if this is not going to be handled quickly to please advise this committee. Time is of the essence and we would like to see those planes there yesterday. So if there is additional bureaucratic delays in making this available, I think we want to know about it because we would like to be helpful in getting it to the Ukrainians as soon as possible and we mean, like, today. So if you could just make a commitment to let us know if there is going to be any delays in accommodating those aircraft I would appreciate that. I know the committee would appreciate that. Ms. Nuland. Thank you very much. I did convey the strong bipartisan sentiment of the committee yesterday with regard to these aircraft and will do so again, based on this hearing. Thanks. Senator Cardin. Thank you. I want to talk a little bit about Moldova and Georgia. If it were not for the Ukrainian resistance and Mr. Putin was able to overtake Ukraine in the timeframe that he thought he would be able to do it, I daresay that there would be a real concern that Mr. Putin may be on his way to Moldova and Georgia--non- NATO countries. What steps are we taking today to help Moldova and Georgia, recognizing that if the circumstances change and Mr. Putin believes he has the ability he would not hesitate to cross those borders? He already has. I mean, he is already in Moldova and Georgia in contested areas. They are not contested, but only by Mr. Putin believing they are contested. What steps are being taken so that those countries are going to be in the best possible position to defend themselves in the event that Mr. Putin decides he is going to move more aggressively in those two countries? Ms. Nuland. Thanks, Senator Cardin. First, with regard to Georgia, as you know, we have a longstanding security relationship with Georgia. They have also contributed regularly to all kinds of NATO operations and NATO exercises and have received lots of U.S. military training and equipment over the years, which--and that program accelerated quite a bit after President Putin's invasion of Georgia in 2008. That relationship is strong and continues to be strong. With regard to Moldova, as you know, Secretary Blinken was in Moldova. I cannot remember--Saturday, maybe--Friday or Saturday. He went with the intention of showing U.S. support and seeking to understand better what their concerns are in the context of this war and, as you know, were Putin's troops to make that landing in Odessa, it is just a short hop up Transnistria and Moldova would be next. In response to the president of Moldova's request, we are looking at increasing not only our humanitarian support to Moldova, because they are also hosting lots of Ukrainian refugees, but border security and energy security and other things that that government has asked for, and we will continue to be responsive as we can. Senator Cardin. So let me ask one additional question. As early as Thursday or Friday, we are going to pass an omnibus appropriation bill. It is going to contain a significant amount of funds for humanitarian assistance. Is the State Department prepared to be able to implement major supplying of humanitarian needs in regards to the refugees that have fled as well as the people within Ukraine that need help? Are we--have the capacity to make sure those relief funds and relief efforts are implemented immediately? Ms. Nuland. We are, Senator. In fact, as we saw these troops mounting on Ukraine's borders, we began working with U.N. agencies, with the Ukrainians, with neighboring states to stockpile humanitarian support. Much of what was initially available was the result of that stockpiling. We are now continuing to push humanitarian support into Ukraine as are the U.N. agencies and into Moldova, as I said, and Poland is also getting a huge amount of international support as are Romania, Slovakia, Hungary, other countries on the front line, and we will do more together with our partners at AID and in the U.N. agencies. Senator Cardin. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. The Chairman. Senator Rubio. Senator Rubio. Secretary Nuland, does the United States recognize Juan Guaido as the president of Venezuela? Ms. Nuland. We recognize his leadership in Venezuela, yes. Senator Rubio. Do we recognize him as the president of Venezuela? Is that not--is that not our official position? Ms. Nuland. It is. Senator Rubio. So why would we meet with a dictator, Nicolas Maduro, without telling Juan Guaido or the ambassador here in the United States that it was happening? I know you told him afterwards. Why would we not coordinate with them beforehand? Ms. Nuland. We did coordinate with them beforehand. We met with the opposition before that meeting. Senator Rubio. You met with the opposition after that meeting. Ms. Nuland. I will take that. I think it was the other way around, Senator. Senator Rubio. I assure you it was after that meeting and, certainly, the ambassador feels that way. He was not aware of it until after that meeting. You are aware that the Venezuelan oil industry is in shambles after years of mismanagement, corruption. It is a personal piggy bank. They produce about--on a good day about a quarter of what they used to produce, what we would all remember as Venezuela, and every informed person in the oil industry will tell you that if we were to buy all of it--and we cannot because some of it is already contractually committed--it would be an insignificant impact on U.S. economy. It is--but it would be a huge benefit to Maduro. It would be millions of dollars for his personal piggy bank. So is this meeting--the secret meeting that occurred this weekend, which is published everywhere--is this part of a Russia strategy or is it part of a general pivot in the broader Venezuela matter? Ms. Nuland. There is zero pivot in our Venezuela strategy, Senator. First and foremost, and I can only talk about it to some extent in this setting--I am happy to talk to you about it in another setting if you would like or after this hearing. Senator Rubio. It is not--not because it is classified, but because it is confidential with another government, another country. Ms. Nuland. For a number of reasons. First and foremost, the mission was about visiting and checking on the welfare of our incarcerated Americans--the CITGO 6 and the other two--and as you know, we have made regular visits to Caracas for that purpose. We were also seeking to get the Venezuelan Government back to the table with the opposition in the internationally monitored peace talks, and then there were a number of other things that we discussed that I can talk to you about in another---- Senator Rubio. Why did they leave those negotiations? Do you recall? Ms. Nuland. They left them because they objected to the extradition of one of---- Senator Rubio. Alex Saab. Ms. Nuland. Yes, exactly. One of the---- Senator Rubio. The guy that was helping them to steal gold and sell it to Iran. Ms. Nuland. Right. I think you would agree that if they were willing to come back to the table with the opposition that would be a good thing for the opposition's goals. Senator Rubio. Actually, I do not really think it would matter. Maduro has had habitual--he is a habitual negotiator, but he never leads to anything. That is why the Vatican will not even host him anymore. Other countries do not even want to be involved anymore. He uses negotiations the way Putin does, habitually, to divide and demoralize his opposition. I just do not understand why we think that cutting a deal with Maduro now to lift sanctions, as he yesterday bragged on television about that meeting and how it is the end of--and as they mocked Guaido. That meeting did tremendous damage to the person that we recognize as the President of Venezuela. It is incredibly troubling and it would mean nothing. We would notice nothing. He is more than happy to agree to negotiations. He uses them to divide the opposition and demoralize them, habitually, the way Putin has done as well. I only have a minute left. Let me ask you, does Ukraine have chemical or biological weapons? Ms. Nuland. Ukraine has biological research facilities which, in fact, we are now quite concerned Russian troops, Russian forces, may be seeking to gain control of. We are working with the Ukrainians on how they can prevent any of those research materials from falling into the hands of Russian forces should they approach. Senator Rubio. I am sure you are aware that the Russian propaganda groups are already putting out there all kinds of information about how they have uncovered a plot by the Ukrainians to release biological weapons in the country and with NATO's coordination. If there is a biological or chemical weapon incident or attack inside of Ukraine, is there any doubt in your mind that 100 percent it would be the Russians that would be behind it? Ms. Nuland. There is no doubt in my mind, Senator, and it is classic Russian technique to blame on the other guy what they are planning to do themselves. Senator Rubio. Last question. I am certain that the Russians were looking at their foreign--their reserves as a way to buffer sanctions. Do you know how--now that we have sanctioned the central bank along with others, what--do we have an idea of what percentage of their reserves are frozen or inaccessible to them? Ms. Nuland. Virtually all of them are now frozen. You notice that the country has been under currency controls for almost 2 weeks now, and the whole point of putting so many of these top 10 banks under sanctions is to make it impossible for them to get access to their cash in hard currency. The Chairman. Thank you. Senator Shaheen. Senator Shaheen. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, and thank you for being here and for everything that the State Department and the Administration is doing to help Ukraine. As I am sure you are aware, I weighed in with Senator Portman over the weekend on the importance of providing jets through Poland for the Ukrainians after we heard from President Zelensky that that was his number-one request, and I understand that we are still working on that issue that we had not coordinated with Poland before they made their announcement. Is that correct? Ms. Nuland. Not to my knowledge, and I was in a meeting where I ought to have heard about that just before I came. I think that actually was a surprise move by the Poles. Senator Shaheen. One of the challenges is being able to backfill any planes that are provided to Ukraine. Is there a willingness on the part of other--of our European allies to help support this effort? Ms. Nuland. Senator, I think what is most important in the short run with regard to Poland is that they benefit from full air security from the NATO alliance and, as you know, the U.S. has increased our support to Poland as has--as have other NATO allies so--and we are also looking at putting some Patriot batteries into Poland. So I think that the main issue is to evaluate together what Poland's immediate needs are in the context of being a neighbor of this conflict. Senator Shaheen. I, certainly, agreed with the line of questioning that you heard from Senator Rubio about the disinformation and what--if you want to know what Russia is planning look at what they are accusing us of. Ms. Nuland. Exactly. Senator Shaheen. To what extent are we working with our allies on the responding to the disinformation that is out there that Russia is putting out? Because, obviously, the Baltic countries, Poland, a number of our Eastern European allies, have long experience with responding to disinformation on the part of Russia. Are we coordinating that effort in any way? Ms. Nuland. Absolutely, Senator. I think you know the State Department's Global Engagement Center, which you all helped us stand up and supported, works 24/7 to--with other allies and partners not just in Europe, but around the world to bring to light Russian disinformation campaigns and who is pushing them. We also work with the tech companies to try to take down false stories and we are working very assiduously on all of that now. We are also working to try to get truth into Russia in the context of a complete freeze on independent news going there, and that is an issue that is of paramount concern to all of us. Senator Shaheen. So how are we replacing the information that might have been shared through social media that is no longer operating in Russia? Are we looking specifically in that area? Ms. Nuland. What I would say to you without getting into it in too much detail there are a large number of Russian independent journalists who are now active outside the country who make use of the internet and telegram and other channels to get truth into Russia. There are huge numbers of influencers and vloggers and videographers who are themselves working to push the truth into Russia and I think that is partly why the Kremlin came down so hard on independent media. We, ourselves, were doing interviews at all levels with what was left of Russian independent media and any Russian state media that would have us. We are continuing to work with lots of the journalists that we already had been working with, as have our allies and partners, and trying to find as many creative ways as we can to get truth into Russia. Senator Shaheen. Thank you. Finally, as you are aware, this--the European Subcommittee did a hearing on the Black Sea region a month or so ago and one of the things we heard is that the Administration was working on a strategy for the Black Sea. Can you talk about how what Russia has done affects what that strategy might look like in the future? Ms. Nuland. I think the greatest concern is the fact that as Putin has installed more and more weapons and more sophisticated weapons onto the Crimean Peninsula, he has used that weaponry to threaten freedom of navigation and to claim greater and greater parts of the Black Sea, well beyond territorial limits. You will remember from the fall--I cannot remember the name of the British ship that came under fire when it was well in international waters. We have a regular rotation of NATO exercises and U.S. exercises into the Black Sea to show presence and try to keep the Black Sea open. We are also working on the capability of all of those states on the littoral--Romania, Bulgaria, Turkey--and I will say that Turkey has taken some very strong moves since this conflict began under the Montreux Convention to deny warships access. We are working on all of those things, and then the strategy will, of course, also look at cyber collaboration, economic integration, fishing, clean Black Sea, all of those things. Senator Shaheen. Thank you. The Chairman. Senator Johnson. Senator Johnson. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Under Secretary Nuland, welcome. I have done a fair amount of negotiating in my private sector life. Generally, when a negotiation proceeds and I realize the negotiating partner is not negotiating in good faith, I walk away. Actually, always if I am not proceeding in a good faith negotiation I walk away. I have never, ever tried to negotiate with somebody who would refuse to even sit down and talk to me. In fact, is that not what is happening with the JCPOA negotiations right now where Iran refuses to meet with our negotiators? Ms. Nuland. Senator Johnson, we do not sit face-to-face with Iran, but we have nearly completed this agreement on the basis of---- Senator Johnson. Okay. Again---- Ms. Nuland. --face-to-face negotiations that they do have with our European partners. So it is not ideal. Senator Johnson. Again, it is--but it is true Iran refuses to meet with us, correct? Is that not an automatic admission that they are not good faith negotiations? Why would the Administration--why would President Biden participate in something like that? That is a charade. It is not a negotiation. Ms. Nuland. Senator Johnson, I will say that I, too, have done a lot of negotiating in my life, and whereas it is not ideal not to sit in the same room, it can work and proximity talks have been known to produce very good agreements. Over time, we will see if we can get there on this one. Senator Johnson. Okay. Following up on Senator Rubio's questioning on Venezuela, it sounds like you really were not talking about buying their oil. Is that true? Ms. Nuland. Senator, I am happy to talk in some detail about all the contours of that trip in another setting or, perhaps, in a little while. We are still in the process of working on a number of things there. The primary purpose of that mission was to go see our eight Americans who are incarcerated. Senator Johnson. Again, Senator Rubio is more familiar with what their oil capacities are. It sounds like they really could not add much to anything we would do. I mean, can you just state categorically that we will not be buying Venezuelan oil? We will not--if we are going to buy oil we will buy American oil? We will not buy from a tyrant like Maduro? Ms. Nuland. Senator, let me try to put this whole oil issue in some context, if I may. When we ban Russian oil, as we are-- as the President very clearly did today, that has an impact on all kinds of things. We already have a situation, thanks to the international efforts that we have galvanized where 70 percent of Russian fuel is stuck. The particular kind of Russian fuel that the U.S. imports or had been importing was heavy fuel and that is only produced in a couple of countries around the world. Whereas we have--we want to ban Russian oil, we also need to find a way--if we do not want to have major economic impacts as a result of this war and the squeeze on oil around the world, we have to find a way to get more capacity into the system. Senator Johnson. Okay. Again, you are not ruling out buying oil from the tyrant Maduro in Venezuela? You are not ruling that out? Ms. Nuland. I will come back to you on that question. Senator Johnson. Okay. We have seen some protests in Russia. Seems like they are being suppressed pretty effectively. People are being jailed. What information are those individuals getting, how are they getting it, and what is the U.S. doing to make sure that the Russian people get more of the truth and less Russian propaganda? Ms. Nuland. Again, President Putin is scared of what we were already doing, so scared that he had to choke off the rest of the--what was left of the free press in Russia. As I mentioned to Senator Shaheen, we have--we and our allies have broad and deep relationships with lots of Russian journalists and lots of Russian brave influencers outside-- operating outside of Russia who are able to push their information into Russia by various means. We also have RFE/RL, which, though it has been closed down in Russia, has a relatively sizable listenership and viewership through the web, which--through the internet, which the-- President Putin has not yet closed down in Russia. We are working on lots of different ways to try to get truth into Russia. I will say that brave Ukrainians, whether they are individual citizens with their cell phones or Ukrainian journalists, have documented mass--the same pictures that we are seeing on our TV are now being packaged by some of these Russian journalists to get back into Russia and to get the truth to them despite President Putin's effort to blind his own people. Senator Johnson. I hope part of the truth we are going to be broadcasting to Russia is just how much the oligarchs, Putin, has stolen from the Russian people. I hope we--as we confiscate that wealth, which I hope we do, I hope we lay it out for the Russian people. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. The Chairman. Thank you. Senator Coons. Senator Coons. Thank you, Chairman Menendez. Thank you, Under Secretary Nuland, both for this hearing and for last night's classified briefing. I wish the American people could see the determined and strong and bipartisan engagement that I am, at least, experiencing from this committee and from Congress. Over the weekend, more than 280 members of Congress took a call--participated in a call with President Zelensky and, if anything, I have been encouraged, even surprised at times, by the unanimity within Congress of support for stronger and stronger measures against Putin and Putin's Russia for his unjustified and immoral invasion of Ukraine. You have served for 32 years, at least, our nation and our public in the State Department and in other roles, and your advice and your insight is greatly appreciated and welcome, and I believe that President Biden's forceful leadership, the decision to proactively release intelligence in order to make it clear to Russia we knew what they were planning, to proactively invest time and effort and diplomatic resources in rebuilding our ties with the EU, with NATO, with other vital partners laid the groundwork for what has been in just 12 days a striking, swift, broad action by the West to impose crippling sanctions on Russia and Russia's economy. I am very concerned about the humanitarian situation in Ukraine. The United Nations is planning for 5 million refugees and 7 million internally-displaced people. There are, as of today, 2 million Ukrainians who have fled the country, a million of them children. That is more in 12 days than fled Syria in 3 years. I am hopeful that this week we will pass an emergency supplemental for Ukraine that will be no less than $12 billion and that more than half of that will be dedicated to the humanitarian crisis. Please help us understand. The U.N. is playing a key role-- the World Food Programme, UNHCR--as well as, of course, USAID and some other impressive private groups like World Central Kitchen are responding quickly. Our partners and allies like Poland, Hungary, Romania, Moldova, as you have mentioned, are responding. What more can we and should we do to meet this humanitarian crisis, which is coming on top of refugee and food insecurity crises in a dozen other countries around the world? Ms. Nuland. Senator Coons, I think you put your finger on it that, unfortunately, at 2 million refugees now we may not have even half of what we will see here. What I will say is that they are fleeing into, by and large, European Union countries who are relatively prosperous and are doing a spectacular job in their own right of welcoming them, managing them. EU agencies are also--EU ECHO and others--working actively with the U.N. and a large number of them are also going to relatives who already live in Europe. That might be just the beginning of this, and I think as it gets worse we will have more and more of the infirm, of the young, of those who have special needs. What we are trying to do is to ensure that we are continuing to get humanitarian assistance into Ukraine. You have seen the horrendous pictures of people sleeping week after week now in subway stations or in their bombed out houses, et cetera. The needs there appear to be moving from early on need for hygiene products and health products and those kinds of things to now needing foodstuffs and other things. Then we are trying to help Poland not only with its ability to flow through refugees, but with its border management because those--that first day as they come off the border is where it is most congested, and we are---- Senator Coons. Senator Shaheen and I were in Poland just 2 weeks ago---- Ms. Nuland. So you saw---- Senator Coons. --and are impressed with the level of partnership. Let me just, in closing, mention this supplemental will include something many of us have supported, more funding for Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty to try and get into Russia and Ukraine truthful, accurate reporting. I am a co-sponsor as well of a resolution that is bipartisan condemning Russian war crimes and calling on international bodies like the ICC to investigate, and I want just to be reassured that we are doing everything we can to document the atrocities against civilians being committed by Russians and to hold Russia's military and political leadership and, specifically, Vladimir Putin accountable for crimes against humanity. Ms. Nuland. To say their, it is Ukrainians who are doing a spectacular job as they confront these horrific incidents in getting documentation and ensuring that they get that out to the world, and we are preparing, as an international community, to respond to all of that and to deal with it and to hold President--to hold Putin accountable as well as those who helped him prosecute this war. Senator Coons. Thank you, and thank you for your service. The Chairman. Senator Romney. Senator Romney. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Thank you, Secretary. I appreciate your willingness to provide this information to us today and again yesterday. With regards to the aircraft that are now under U.S. control, apparently--MiG aircraft that will be in Ramstein and it will be--able to be sent to Ukraine--I know there will be hand wringing and concern about what might happen and how Russia might respond. I did receive a note from a friend who said this. He said, it seems to me that this war will be over when Putin is more worried about what NATO might do than NATO being worried about what Putin might do. I know that all things associated with this conflict have a certain degree of risk, but at the same time there are people dying and there is, I think, a worldwide clamoring, including by our people here, to provide support and help to the people of Ukraine and to help end this outrage. You spent a lot of your career looking at Mr. Putin and trying to understand his reasoning, perhaps, not his psychology. There are a number of people that said he is not going to invade Ukraine. He realizes that is a terrible decision, would not be in his best interest. Nonetheless, he did. There are others that are writing, oh, it was because we sort of opened the door to him--to Ukraine joining NATO that precipitated this. What is your view? As you look at Putin, why did he decide to go in? What precipitated this? I do not just mean this immediate action, but, I mean, why did he make such an extraordinary investment of his country with such enormous repercussions? What drove this? I say that not because I am just curious for the past, but to try and get a sense of where we might be headed. Ms. Nuland. Senator, I think, obviously, those questions should best be directed to Mr. Putin. I will give you a few thoughts here anyway. I think, over the years, President Putin's imperial ambition has grown and he is dissatisfied with the last 30 years of Russian history and has longed for some time to be the guy that helps recreate the Soviet Union, the fall of which, he said, was one of the greatest tragedies of the 20th century. Imagine that, the 20th century. I think he has had that ambition. I think in the last couple of years he has been particularly obsessed with this and particularly consumed. He has created, as you know, a whole bed of lies about how the U.S. would use Ukraine as a springboard to Russia or that NATO would, and he has, frankly, made clear in the last couple of days that he does not actually think that Ukraine is an independent country from Russia. I think his interior mind is now out there for everybody to see. That is what makes me worried that not only do we have to ensure that this Ukraine gambit is a strategic failure for Putin for Ukraine's sake, but also for all of the other countries in the region, and his appetite has only grown with the eating. We cannot allow this to stand. Senator Romney. Do you have a sense of what the end game might be for Putin? Because losing is not acceptable, I am sure, in his psyche. Is there an off ramp? Are there some options that you consider that might be ways for this conflict to end? Ms. Nuland. The way this conflict will end is when Putin realizes that this adventure has put his own leadership standing at risk with his own military, with his own people, that he is hemorrhaging the lives of the people of Russia, the army of Russia, and their future to his own vain ambition, and he will have to change course or the Russian people take matters into their own hands. From the U.S. perspective, the end game is the strategic defeat of President Putin in this adventure. Senator Romney. Would China have the capacity to influence his decisions at this stage and are they trying to do so? Ms. Nuland. The Chinese like to say that they are neutral in this conflict. As we discussed a little bit yesterday, we believe that it is incumbent on all of us and our leadership is, certainly, involved in this and so are many of our allies and partners. I think you know that President Scholz and President Macron--Chancellor Scholz and President Macron talked to Xi Jinping just today to impress upon the Chinese that neutrality is not an option here, that this is a violation of international humanitarian law, violation of sovereignty, that they should not want to stand with somebody who would exact this kind of brutality on his own people, that they should be pushing Putin to stop, that they should be pushing for humanitarian corridors, that they should be thinking about their own strategic and economic interests as this war ramps up energy prices and makes it harder for them, ramps up global commodity prices. As you know, they just reported the slowest growth in some 15 years of their own. They have an opportunity for leadership here and we are all urging them to take it. Senator Romney. Thank you, Madam Secretary. The Chairman. Senator Murphy. Senator Murphy. Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman. Mr. Chairman, I thank you for your opening comments. We are all standing today in awe of the bravery and heroism of the Ukrainian people, of their government, and I am so pleased that this committee and this Congress has, by and large, been able to come together in our support for their efforts. Madam Secretary, I want to thank you personally because I do not know that there is an American diplomat who has fought more vigorously for Ukraine, for Ukrainian sovereignty, for Ukrainian independence over the course of the last decade than you have. First, second, and third, we thank the Ukrainian people for what they are doing right now on behalf of global democracy. It is the U.S.-Ukrainian partnership--an economic partnership, a political partnership, a military partnership--that you have helped forge, I think, that has been contributory to their ability to stand up and defend themselves. So I am grateful for the work that you have done and for your friendship and your candor, as always, time after time with this committee. Let me just say, I think it is a curious decision by Poland to announce their gift of several $100 million worth of jets to the United States without alerting us first, especially since, frankly, they would be the more natural direct partner with Ukraine, given that these are MiG jets that the Poles know how to use and will, ultimately, have to help transfer to the Ukrainians, and I look forward to consultations that we will have with them about their recent announcement. I did want to turn just for a moment to some of the questions that have been raised about Russia's role within the talks inside Vienna, and let me just ask you a pretty simple predicate question to make sure we sort of level set what this committee needs to worry about. The Russian invasion of Ukraine is not the only security challenge posed to the United States today, correct? Ms. Nuland. Correct. Senator Murphy. Listen, I, frankly, think it would be national security malpractice for the United States to kick down the road another 6 months a nuclear deal with Iran, given what this Congress has learned about the progress of the Iranian nuclear program since the withdrawal. To give it another 6 months is to, essentially, put Iran on the doorstep of a nuclear weapon. So because you have been asked questions already about the particulars of these negotiations, maybe just draw us back for a moment and talk to us for a minute about the consequences of not entering-- reentering a deal with the Iranians and, in particular, the prospects for a nuclear arms race in the Middle East to be set off by a sort of final failure of the United States and Iran to get back to a diplomatic agreement. Ms. Nuland. Thanks for the opportunity, Senator, and thanks for your very kind words--my home state senator, we should admit here and a long friend. Let me just say that, as you put it, the last thing we need on top of Putin's bloody war is a nuclear-armed Iran and, you know, what we can say in this setting is that nuclear capability of the kind that we do not want to see could come to Iran in a matter of weeks and months if we do not get them back into this agreement. That is not good for the planet, and to have both Iran and Russia able to threaten all of us in that way would be catastrophic at this time, not to mention what they might do if they teamed up. We have got to be able to walk and chew gum at the same time and that is what we are trying to do, and we do appreciate the fact that we have been able to come up to the Congress again and again and again to try to work on these issues together. Senator Murphy. So just spend the last moment here talking about what Russia's role is at that table, what their equities are. I know many of my colleagues are worried about the benefits that may accrue to Russia through an agreement. How do we workshop their role in these negotiations? Ms. Nuland. I remember earlier in my career working with the Russians during the Bush administration and we were concerned about Iran's nuclear program, and they would say they cannot do it. It is not going to happen. Then a switch flipped at some point in the mid odd years where they began to understand that Iran with a nuclear weapon could threaten them, and that is what got them involved in working with us and bringing China along in this negotiation. They have been--they were partners in the first JCPOA and they have been actually very helpful in trying to get us back to where we are now, first and foremost, because a nuclear- armed Iran is closer to them than they are to us and the range of the weapons that Iran would have, first, could hit them before they could hit us. That said, they also have the--some unique capacity to downgrade uranium, et cetera, so one of the roles that they would play in this deal would be to take higher grade uranium fuel that is only appropriate for weapons and blend it down so that it could be used in reactors, et cetera. There have been--we have had some questions about whether Russia stands to gain financially from this deal. Russia has relatively small trade relations with Iran so it is primarily in the interest of their own national security and their own concerns about a nuclear Iran that they participate in all of this and offer to be the blender down of the fuel. Senator Murphy. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. The Chairman. Thank you. Just an observation--they are not the only country who can do that. Senator Portman. Senator Portman. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Secretary Nuland, unfortunately, you were right about Putin and so here we are. We have a brutal, illegal, totally unprovoked unjustified attack on our ally, a democratic country, a sovereign country, and tonight, as we sit here in Ukraine they are continuing to bomb civilian targets. They shelled civilians who chose to walk down the humanitarian corridors that they had agreed to. They killed people who were on these corridors. We have to remember this is something that requires us, along with our allies--all countries, really--certainly, all freedom-loving countries who care about what might happen to them to step up and do more. I appreciate what was said today, but we have got to do more, both in terms of military assistance and in terms of sanctions, and it is a matter of days or weeks, not months, that we have to do more because it will be too late otherwise. I think Putin miscalculated. He miscalculated about the resolve of the Ukrainian people and the competence of their military. He miscalculated about the resolve of the alliance to respond. Let us get these planes into the country. I think it is a good sign that today the Polish Government sent out a release saying, you can have these MiGs. There are 29 of them. By the way, I wish they would also provide the 18 SU-25s, some of which are dual bomber fighters, because they could use those, too. I wish Slovakia would do the same thing with their 11 MiGs and Bulgaria has 13 MiGs, as far as we know. Maybe more. I hope that you will commit today, and I suppose this is in the form of a question--do you commit to do everything possible to make this arrangement work, whatever it takes? The response that I have gotten from some in the Administration is we are not sure--it might make Putin mad. He has invaded his neighbor and he is killing innocent people, and everything makes him mad. I mean, he has said the sanctions are an act of war. He gets mad over the Javelins and the Stingers. Are you going to do everything you possibly can to get these airplanes that the Ukrainians want badly? We have heard it directly from the president. We have heard it from other Ukrainian officials. Can we get these planes into Ukraine to begin to provide some protection for these innocent civilians? Ms. Nuland. Senator, as I committed yesterday, I will continue to convey the very strong bipartisan view of this committee that these planes need to get to Ukraine. As we discussed in another setting, there are a number of factors to consider here and there are some mixed views among allies and even within the Administration. Obviously, I will convey your strong views and the strong views of everybody that we have spoken today on this issue. Senator Portman. My time is clicking here, but it is not really a concern to me that there is some disagreement in the Administration because all it requires is for the President and his team to decide this is the way we are going to go. Finally, the oil was blocked today or will be blocked. That is great, but it took a long time. Took too long. On sanctions, so many questions for you. The most favored nation--I think we should use our Article 21 ability under the WTO to revoke that. If you have thoughts on that, I would appreciate it. We should seize assets, not just freeze assets. Specific question about U.S. sanctions against Russia's biggest banks, including VTB Bank. They do not apply to energy transactions, we are told, until June 24. Is that true? Ms. Nuland. All of the things that you listed are things that we are looking at. As I said in my opening statement, we are not done with sanctions if he is not done with this war, and we will continue to escalate. You named a number of the things that we are and will look at. With regard to VTB, as you know, part of the strength--the strength of sanctions is when we can do them multilaterally and, particularly, transatlantically with our European allies and partners in Japan. Because of the energy dependency of a number of our European allies, we did agree to a phase-in of some of the VTB sanctions to allow energy processing for Europe and that will fade out over time. Senator Portman. June 24--why that late date? By June 24, it may be too late. Ms. Nuland. It was part of our building of this package with the Europeans to have a 90-day wind-down on this energy carve out so that is--was part of the deal that we struck to maintain unity. Senator Portman. My time has expired. So many other questions. Penetrating the Kremlin's information firewall, it seems to me, is a critical step here to allow the Russian people to know the truth. Ms. Nuland. I agree with you, Senator. Senator Portman. Anything we can do in that regard to be helpful I would like you to follow up with us on that, please. Ms. Nuland. I will. Senator Portman. Thank you. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. The Chairman. Senator Kaine. Senator Kaine. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, and, thank you, Secretary Nuland. I add my words to those of my colleagues to just commend the cooperation of the United States and the leadership of the United States with other nations. If the world wanted to see what U.S. leadership in assembling a coalition of democracies could produce, I believe the world has seen that, and for anyone who has questioned the value of alliances or NATO, I think they understand it now. My colleagues have asked many of my questions so this is maybe more of a comment. There is 195 countries in the world. Two have Jewish heads of state--Israel and Ukraine. Two other nations--Panama and Latvia--have heads of state who have Jewish family members. Vladimir Zelensky is a particular case. His great grandfather and many siblings were murdered in the Holocaust. His grandfather fought with the Red Army against the Nazis. Yet, he has been subject to three assassination attempts, by public reporting, by this invasion, by war criminal Vladimir Putin, and the Russian missile strikes have hit Babyn Yar, the ravine in Kyiv that was the site of the largest single massacre of Jews during World War II in September of 1941. I mention these facts because you were asked by Senator Romney how Vladimir Putin was justifying his actions and you said he has kind of put it out there, and one of the things that is amazing--this is the person we are dealing with--he said that this invasion was needed to denazify Ukraine. So he is attempting to decapitate a government that is led by one of two Jewish heads of state in the world who is the survivor of a family of those who were killed in the Holocaust and he is doing it in a way where he is putting at risk sacred sites that are known throughout the world and across history for the massacre of Jews during World War II. This is the person that we are dealing with. Just that simple phrase ``I am trying to denazify Ukraine'' suggests that he is thinking about this as if we are living in 1945 or 1941, rather than 2020. He is willing to repeat the big lie, ``I am going to denazify this country'' by killing one of two Jewish heads of state in the world and decapitating the government, repeating the big lie over and over and over again, and even willing to attack the sites like Babyn Yar and also there is Russia attacks in Odessa going on, and the massacre of Jews in Odessa was even larger later in the war than the massacres at Babyn Yar in 1941. We have got to win. Democracies have to win this. The challenge, I think, that we are really grappling with is that the strategies that this Administration has put together with other democracies are showing great resolve and the Ukrainian people are showing even greater resolve, and there are early signs of resistance in Russia--runs on ATMs and banks and protests, despite repeated arrests that are ongoing. Nations that we would not have expected to participate with NATO--Sweden and Finland, non-NATO members--delivering weapons to Ukraine. Germany, which has had this post-World War II policy of not putting weapons into a war zone, willing to deliver weapons into Ukraine. Moldova, which has much to fear, announcing just last week that they desperately want to be members of the EU. What Vladimir Putin did in the 2014 invasion of Ukraine and the establishment of these puppet states in Donetsk and Luhansk, everyone could look at those states and see the grim Stalinist camps they were becoming from what had been thriving cities and realize, we do not want any part of that. Vladimir Putin is chasing many nations that were not previously leaning toward the EU or leaning toward NATO. He has done the best possible job to chase them in to a Western orientation. We need to continue to harvest that. Yet, the challenge of all of that is that may not be enough to change Vladimir Putin's calculation. There does not seem to be easy off ramps, and we talked about this during the classified hearing that we had yesterday and I do not need you to comment further on it. If the world wants to know the character of this individual there are a lot of ways to measure it. Someone who would attempt to decapitate the government of one of two nations in the world led by a Jewish head of state whose family perished in the Holocaust and claiming that the motivation behind that is denazification of Ukraine this tells you the kind of person we are dealing with. That is all I have to say, Mr. Chair. The Chairman. Senator Young. Senator Young. Welcome, Under Secretary. I wanted to follow up on the enquiries of the ranking member and Senator Murphy. Like them, I, too, am extremely concerned with reports Russia is attempting to link Iran deal negotiations to sanctions imposed on Russia for its invasion. This situation looks to me more like Russia is trying to blackmail the United States, hoping the Administration is going to sacrifice Ukraine in a misguided effort to finalize an Iran deal at all costs. Reports indicate that Lavrov has requested written guarantees from the U.S. with regard to sanctions relief for transactions between Russia and Iran for the negotiations to continue as a precondition for closing out those negotiations. My question is this, Under Secretary. Has the Administration provided any written guarantees to Russia that its trade investment or military cooperation with Iran will not be subject to sanctions? Ms. Nuland. No. Senator Young. Thank you. Has anything about your negotiations with the Russians changed as a result of their invasion of Ukraine? Ms. Nuland. Senator, in this open setting, I will simply say that you are right, Russia is trying to up the ante and broaden its demands with regard to the JCPOA, and we are not playing ``Let's Make a Deal.'' Senator Young. I look forward to following up this line of inquiry in a closed setting. Before I move on, in light of the gravity of this dynamic, how can the Administration negotiate in good faith with Russia in these Iranian talks? Would not any announced deal be immediately undermined by Russia's ongoing behavior? Ms. Nuland. Senator, we are not negotiating with Iran--with Russia vis-a-vis Iran. As we talked about earlier, Russia, for its own reasons, has chosen to be a participant in these negotiations because it wants to see Iran's ability to get a nuclear weapon constrained. This is one of those rare instances where we have the same strategic objective and, I would argue, as I did earlier, that for us that strategic objective becomes even more important because we do not want a nuclear Iran and a rampaging Putin in Ukraine at the same time. Senator Young. I am not sure we still do have the same strategic objective. That argument might have been made until just the recent days when the Iranian--rather, the Russian negotiator put himself on the internet, indicating that his position was, indeed, shaped not by--if I recall, he said that his position was shaped by the current circumstances in Ukraine--the recent developments. Is that accurate, that the dynamics have changed on account of this intervention? If so, does Russian participation undermine the negotiations? Ms. Nuland. What I can say in this open setting is that there may be some in Russia seeking to get extra benefits for their cooperation and participation in seeking to get Iran back into the JCPOA, but they are not going to be successful. Senator Young. Thank you, Under Secretary. I am going to move on just another couple of questions here I will bundle together in light of time. China is watching this entire Ukraine conflict with close interest and, surely, seeking to make the most of the situation. Can you provide more details on the Saturday call between Secretary Blinken and Chinese Foreign Minister Wang? Specifically, what did Foreign Minister Wang mean when he stated that the situation in Ukraine has, ``reached a point that China did not wish to see''? Ms. Nuland. I am going to let the Chinese side speak for themselves. I will simply say what I said earlier in this hearing, that our intention in our regular engagement with China, including Secretary Blinken's call with his counterpart, was to underscore that this war is not good for China--that we want to see China use its influence with Russia to get this war ended, and, at a minimum, to help get these humanitarian corridors going and that if they are concerned about their economic situation, as they should well be with the lowest growth rates in 15 years, that this war is contributing to it. Senator Young. I am out of time. Thank you, Under Secretary. Ms. Nuland. Thank you. The Chairman. Senator Markey. Senator Markey. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Thank you for your great work, Madam Secretary. As you may remember, you and I discussed in a hearing before this committee in December the fact that the United States cannot preach temperance from a bar tool when it comes to Russian energy. At the same time as many voices were railing against Europe for their reliance on Russian natural gas, American fossil fuel companies were importing nearly $20 billion of Russian oil just last year. At that hearing we discussed the fact that American consumers were unwittingly financing the ill-gotten gains of Putin and his inner circle, the same ``oil-ligarchs'' responsible for enabling Putin's human rights abuses within Russia and now the unjustified invasion of Ukraine. President Biden made the right decision today and I applaud him for that. Now we need to make it a permanent ban to build on the steps that the President announced today. We have to permanently wean ourselves off of corrupt foreign oil and gas by investing in a clean energy revolution. I introduced legislation, the SPIGOT Act, last week to do just that and I think we should enact it so that we have that permanent ban. Madam Secretary, do you agree that there would be value in a comprehensive United States Government report that lifts the veil on oil and gas oil-ligarchs and their involvement in a vast array of Russian human rights abuses? Ms. Nuland. Senator, I love the word ``oil-ligarchs.'' It sounds like a very good idea to me. Senator Markey. Excellent. The reality is, though, that the only way that we can do that and make it sustainable is if we can prevent these fossil-fueled conflicts by ending our own addiction to oil. It happened in the Middle East. It is happening here, and President Biden acknowledged in making today's announcement that we cannot wait for big oil to do the right thing or we will be waiting for as long as it takes for carbon to become a fossil fuel. We have to act as a Senate in order to take those steps. On the question of the nuclear power plants in Russia, how is the United States supporting efforts by the International Atomic Energy Agency to ensure the continued safe operation of all 15 Ukrainian nuclear plants? Ms. Nuland. Senator Merkley, I think you know that the IAEA is trying to negotiate some rules of the road between Russia and Ukraine as Russia tries to seize physical control of all of these plants even as it insists that the Ukrainian operators continue to operate the plants for them. I think the attack on Zaporizhzhia was a wakeup call for not only Ukrainians and Russians, but for the whole world about the danger of close combat near these facilities. We are strongly supporting this effort to negotiate safe practices and, as you know, at Zaporizhzhia the Ukrainian operators performed magnificently in closing down all, but that last bit of power that is needed to keep the core from melting down such that it was less subject to an accident. I think that also speaks to all the work that they have done since Chernobyl on nuclear safety. They are some of the best in the world now, frankly, with our support over many decades. Senator Markey. President Biden nominated Laura Holgate to be his ambassador to the International Atomic Energy Agency. Given the potential threat to the safe operation of Ukraine's reactors and Ukraine's overall energy security, how important is it that Ambassador Holgate be confirmed by the United States Senate without delay, given what we are seeing in Ukraine right now? Ms. Nuland. Extremely important. Laura is a friend of 20 years and an excellent specialist. Senator Markey. Thank you. I agree with you, and I hope we can get it on the committee's agenda very promptly. How concerned are you that Ukraine's other nuclear facilities could be in the crossfire or be subject to a deliberate attack? Ms. Nuland. I think we are all concerned that the Russians want to gain physical and military control, at least of the outskirts and so, again, we are continuing to work with the Ukrainians on safe procedures and we are supporting this IAEA initiative to get some rules of the road going. We will see if the Russians do more than pay lip service to it. Senator Markey. I agree with you 100 percent. We just have to move very, very rapidly if we are going to deal with these threats as they are unfolding. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. The Chairman. Senator Cruz. Senator Cruz. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Under Secretary Nuland, thank you for testifying today. We are sitting here watching the most significant military conflict in Europe unfold since 1945--since the end of World War II, and I am sorry to say that this war, I believe, is the direct result of repeated mistakes made by President Biden and the Biden administration, two mistakes in particular: number one, the disastrous withdrawal in Afghanistan and surrender to the Taliban that emboldened our enemies across the globe, but then, number two, with respect to Russia and Ukraine, very specific mistakes. You and I have talked at great length about Nord Stream 2. As you know, this committee and the Congress won a bipartisan victory stopping Nord Stream 2 in 2019. I authored that legislation. As a result, Putin was deterred from invading Ukraine. When Joe Biden became President, he came in bound and determined to surrender the Nord Stream 2 pipeline to Russia and Putin, notwithstanding the enormous risks that came from it. When President Biden surrendered to Putin on Nord Stream 2, waived the sanctions that had been passed by Congress, at that time Ukraine told us, if you do this Russia will invade Ukraine. At that time, Poland told us, if you do this Russia will invade Ukraine. At that time, I told the Administration and others on this committee told the Administration if you do this Russia will invade Ukraine. We will see tanks in the streets of Kyiv. I wish those predictions had proven wrong. This weekend all hundred senators were on a video conference call with President Zelensky from Ukraine. President Zelensky told us if the United States Government had put sanctions in place last year on Nord Stream 2, Putin would not have invaded Ukraine. Yet, the Administration was bound and determined to continue surrendering to Russia even as Russian troops massed on the border of Ukraine, so much so that the White House put political pressure and forced 44 Democrats to vote to support Russia and Putin just weeks before this invasion. Now, after the invasion, finally, once there were Russian troops invading Ukraine, finally then the Biden administration was dragged kicking and screaming to implementing sanctions on Nord Stream 2. As soon as you did, Nord Stream 2 declared bankruptcy and fired its employees. In my judgment, Putin does not believe any promise from Joe Biden to maintain sanctions on Nord Stream 2 is credible. I think Putin is gambling that when the crisis passes the sanctions will be lifted and Nord Stream 2 will be turned on. I have introduced legislation to make Nord Stream 2 sanctions permanent. In your judgment, do you believe sanctions on Nord Stream 2 should be permanent or should the pipeline be allowed to be turned on? Ms. Nuland. Senator, I think Nord Stream 2 is now dead, and as you have said, it is a hunk of metal at the bottom of the sea. I do not think it will ever be revived. Senator Cruz. So you do not think it will. So let me reiterate my question. Should the sanctions be permanent as a matter of law, in your judgment? Ms. Nuland. I do not think it matters one way or the other. I think the pipeline will never come back. Senator Cruz. You are testifying you have no objections then and State has no objections to Congress making the sanctions permanent? Ms. Nuland. We have not looked at what this would do. I do not think it is relevant one way or the other. Senator Cruz. It is relevant because Biden waived them once in the face of massive congressional pressure---- Ms. Nuland. Senator, if I may---- Senator Cruz:--and put politics ahead of national security, and I believe Putin believes Biden will do it again. Ms. Nuland. Senator---- Senator Cruz. When the Administration announced sanctions on Russia, it glaringly exempted energy from those sanctions. This morning, the Biden administration listened to calls for me and from many others to finally include a boycott of Russian oil and gas. That was the right thing to do, but it should have been done at the outset. Europe continues to rely on Russian energy. In your judgment, will our European allies follow suit and also boycott Russian energy? Ms. Nuland. As you have made clear, Senator, and as we all know, the Europeans have a much higher level of dependence today to heat their homes, to keep the lights on. They are---- Senator Cruz. Is the Biden administration pressing the Europeans---- Ms. Nuland. May I finish? Senator Cruz. --to end their reliance on Russia and is the Biden administration pressing them to rely on alternative sources, including American energy, which is abundant and does not fuel a dictator like Putin? Ms. Nuland. Among the things that we have done as this crisis was emerging and since it started was to ship more American LNG and to create more global alternatives to Putin's gas going into Europe, as you know, including working with our---- Senator Cruz. There are six applications pending with the Biden administration to export LNG. None of them have been approved. Do you have any expectations that any of them will be? Ms. Nuland. The European LNG terminals right now are at full capacity to receive. Senator Cruz. Okay. You are not answering my question. Ms. Nuland. One of the things that we are pressing Europe-- -- Senator Cruz. Are you going to answer the question? Ms. Nuland. Can I try to answer the question? Senator Cruz. You can answer the question. Ms. Nuland. Can I try to answer the question? We have taken advantage of this tragedy to, again, speak to Europe about its over reliance on Russian energy and to say to them---- Senator Cruz. The question was simple. Do you anticipate the applications to export LNG will be approved? You are not answering that question. Ms. Nuland. I, frankly, do not do LNG licensing. I expect that licenses will be approved for as much LNG as can be shipped. The Chairman. Thank you very much. Ms. Nuland. That is what I expect. I do not have responsibility for that so I do not actually know how it works. Senator, I have to say to you President Putin was going to launch this vicious, brutal war with or without Nord Stream 2. Senator Cruz. That is not what Zelensky told us. Ms. Nuland. That is my opinion. Senator Cruz. That is also not what you said when you testified before the Senate. The Chairman. The time of the senator has expired. Senator Merkley. Senator Merkley. Ambassador Nuland, thank you for being with us today. Reflecting on the fact that the people of Ukrain"
