Indeed, at 3.5 percent per capita GDP growth during 2005–13, the EAC outpaced sub-Saharan Africa (3.3 percent) (Table 1.1).\n\nTable 1.1\n\nEast African Community: Selected Economic Indicators\n\nSources: Country authorities; and IMF staff calculations.\n\n1Final year data is 2012 in lieu of unavailable 2013 data.\n\nTable 1.1\n\nEast African Community: Selected Economic Indicators\n\n2000 2005 2013 Nominal GDP (US$ billions) Burundi 0.9 1.1 2.7 Kenya 14.4 21.6 55.3 Rwanda 1.7 2.6 7.5 Tanzania 10.2 14.1 33.3 Uganda 6.1 10.0 22.9 GDP per capita (US$) Burundi 125.4 161.7 305.3 Kenya 426.3 546.6 1058.1 Rwanda 204.7 274.7 690.1 Tanzania 310.3 376.2 719.3 Uganda 274.0 361.9 621.5 Population (millions) Burundi 6.4 7.5 9.0 Kenya 29.5 33.8 41.8 Rwanda 8.4 9.4 10.8 Tanzania 32.4 37.1 45.6 Uganda 24.2 28.4 36.8 Inflation (period average, percent change) Burundi 14.1 1.1 9.0 Kenya 7.8 7.8 5.7 Rwanda 3.9 9.1 4.2 Tanzania 6.0 4.4 7.9 Uganda 3.4 8.6 5.0 Fiscal balance incl. grants (percent of GDP) Burundi −1.5 −4.3 −2.4 Kenya −0.3 −1.5 −5.5 Rwanda 0.8 0.6 −4.8 Tanzania −0.9 −4.0 −5.9 Uganda n.a. n.a. −4.2 Gross public debt (percent of GDP) Burundi 147.3 111.6 31.5 Kenya 51.5 46.6 40.0 Rwanda 82.5 58.3 20.9 Tanzania — 56.0 40.5 Uganda 62.3 57.2 32.8 Gross reserves (in months of imports) Burundi 3.3 2.3 3.4 Kenya 2.7 2.7 4.0 Rwanda 5.3 6.2 4.8 Tanzania 4.4 6.1 4.1 Uganda 6.2 6.3 4.5 Credit to private sector (percent of GDP) Burundi 16.5 13.2 15.5 Kenya 23.2 22.1 32.4 Rwanda 10.5 9.1 15.7 Tanzania 3.7 8.9 19.4 Uganda n.a. 7.7 14.6 Broad money (percent of GDP) Burundi 15.3 21.3 19.7 Kenya 32.8 34.2 41.9 Rwanda 17.5 15.2 21.3 Tanzania 15.4 22.2 30.3 Uganda n.a. 17.3 22.4 Stock market capitalization (percent of GDP)1 Burundi — — — Kenya 8.9 29.6 29.5 Rwanda — — — Tanzania 2.3 4.2 6.3 Uganda — 1.0 34.3 Exports goods and services + imports goods and services (percent of GDP) Burundi 22.6 40.1 48.2 Kenya 45.7 56.0 52.5 Rwanda 34.7 37.3 48.5 Tanzania 34.0 51.5 66.7 Uganda 32.4 38.8 55.2\n\nSources: Country authorities; and IMF staff calculations.\n\n1Final year data is 2012 in lieu of unavailable 2013 data.\n\nTable 1.1\n\nEast African Community: Selected Economic Indicators\n\n2000 2005 2013 Nominal GDP (US$ billions) Burundi 0.9 1.1 2.7 Kenya 14.4 21.6 55.3 Rwanda 1.7 2.6 7.5 Tanzania 10.2 14.1 33.3 Uganda 6.1 10.0 22.9 GDP per capita (US$) Burundi 125.4 161.7 305.3 Kenya 426.3 546.6 1058.1 Rwanda 204.7 274.7 690.1 Tanzania 310.3 376.2 719.3 Uganda 274.0 361.9 621.5 Population (millions) Burundi 6.4 7.5 9.0 Kenya 29.5 33.8 41.8 Rwanda 8.4 9.4 10.8 Tanzania 32.4 37.1 45.6 Uganda 24.2 28.4 36.8 Inflation (period average, percent change) Burundi 14.1 1.1 9.0 Kenya 7.8 7.8 5.7 Rwanda 3.9 9.1 4.2 Tanzania 6.0 4.4 7.9 Uganda 3.4 8.6 5.0 Fiscal balance incl. grants (percent of GDP) Burundi −1.5 −4.3 −2.4 Kenya −0.3 −1.5 −5.5 Rwanda 0.8 0.6 −4.8 Tanzania −0.9 −4.0 −5.9 Uganda n.a. n.a. −4.2 Gross public debt (percent of GDP) Burundi 147.3 111.6 31.5 Kenya 51.5 46.6 40.0 Rwanda 82.5 58.3 20.9 Tanzania — 56.0 40.5 Uganda 62.3 57.2 32.8 Gross reserves (in months of imports) Burundi 3.3 2.3 3.4 Kenya 2.7 2.7 4.0 Rwanda 5.3 6.2 4.8 Tanzania 4.4 6.1 4.1 Uganda 6.2 6.3 4.5 Credit to private sector (percent of GDP) Burundi 16.5 13.2 15.5 Kenya 23.2 22.1 32.4 Rwanda 10.5 9.1 15.7 Tanzania 3.7 8.9 19.4 Uganda n.a. 7.7 14.6 Broad money (percent of GDP) Burundi 15.3 21.3 19.7 Kenya 32.8 34.2 41.9 Rwanda 17.5 15.2 21.3 Tanzania 15.4 22.2 30.3 Uganda n.a. 17.3 22.4 Stock market capitalization (percent of GDP)1 Burundi — — — Kenya 8.9 29.6 29.5 Rwanda — — — Tanzania 2.3 4.2 6.3 Uganda — 1.0 34.3 Exports goods and services + imports goods and services (percent of GDP) Burundi 22.6 40.1 48.2 Kenya 45.7 56.0 52.5 Rwanda 34.7 37.3 48.5 Tanzania 34.0 51.5 66.7 Uganda 32.4 38.8 55.2\n\nSources: Country authorities; and IMF staff calculations.\n\n1Final year data is 2012 in lieu of unavailable 2013 data.\n\nChapter 2 explores the basis of this strong growth by benchmarking performance with countries that have experienced sustained growth. A period of “catch up” partly explains this strong performance, making up for previous low growth. Favorable international commodity prices have also been an important contributing factor, as have a peace dividend following bouts of civil strife and sound macroeconomic policies. Rwanda, Tanzania, and Uganda have grown at rates comparable to countries that have sustained growth and share key characteristics such as periods of low inflation and small budget deficits. Improved business environments and government stability have also contributed to strong productivity gains and rising foreign direct investment (Figure 1.1).\n\nChapter 3 examines issues in macroeconomic convergence, which is critical to fostering economic growth that will support the eventual adoption of a single currency. The core, nominal convergence criteria are (1) a fiscal deficit of no more than 3 percent of GDP, (2) an inflation rate of no more than 8 percent, (3) international reserves at least equivalent to 4.5 months of imports, and (4) a public debt-to-GDP ratio of no more than 50 percent in net-present-value terms. While the convergence criteria on international reserves in months of imports and debt to GDP have invariably been met in recent years, in part because of sound macroeconomic policies as well as substantial debt relief, compliance with the deficit and inflation objectives has been more challenging. The former has been difficult because of the need for greater investment in infrastructure in these countries, and the latter because of the impact of food and fuel shocks. By contrast, differences in per capita incomes and productivity have narrowed over time, reflecting strong growth in the region.\n\nMacrofiscal Situation and Monetary Union\n\nChapter 4 explores fiscal policy challenges and highlights a strengthening over time, with lower deficits and debt levels enabling EAC countries to respond effectively, for example, to the global financial crisis through countercyclical fiscal policy. That said, the crisis underscored the region’s vulnerability to large external shocks. The chapter argues that a clause permitting relaxation for large economic shocks should accompany the fiscal deficit criterion. In light of the discovery of nonrenewable resources in several EAC countries, the case is made to commence tracking nonresource primary balances to provide a more reliable measure of the impact of government policies on domestic demand. Chapter 5 covers topics related to strengthening and harmonizing the institutional framework underpinning fiscal policy, particularly data reporting and coverage and public financial management. It also draws on the experiences of other monetary unions in achieving harmonization of national fiscal practices and the need for the development of a national budget frameworks directive.\n\nMonetary Policy Framework and Implementation\n\nChapter 6, in particular, lays out the rationale for harmonizing monetary policy, which is needed to cement credibility in the introduction of a monetary union, especially by ensuring low and stable inflation. Harmonization needs to be gradual given differences in the degree of exchange rate flexibility, the way monetary instruments are used, the weight given to monetary aggregates, and the role of policy interest rates in monetary operations. However, the chapter underscores that harmonization of monetary policy instruments should be undertaken first, during the transition to monetary union.\n\nChapter 7 explores the channels through which monetary policy is transmitted, that is, whether through interest rates or reserve money. A key finding is that, as in developed countries, there is a shift away from money-focused monetary aggregates as a result of, among other things, possible structural shifts in money demand and money multipliers because of a deepening of financial sectors and the openness of economies to international capital flows.\n\nChapter 7 also addresses EAC countries’ response to the recent food and fuel shocks. Food inflation in all EAC countries peaked in the double digits in 2011, and higher nonfood inflation affected consumer price inflation in Burundi, Kenya, Tanzania, and Uganda. Higher transportation costs associated with rising global oil prices were particularly important in landlocked Burundi and Uganda, and power tariffs rose sharply in Tanzania. To curb potential second-round effects, Burundi, Kenya, Tanzania, and Uganda raised policy rates in late 2011. Tanzanian monetary authorities increased reserve requirements and reduced net open positions, causing both growth in broad money and credit to the private sector to slow and the exchange rate to stabilize, improving the outlook for inflation.\n\nThe chapter emphasizes that strengthening the monetary transmission mechanism would be enhanced by (1) ensuring that monetary targets and interest rate policy are consistent, (2) reducing the high share of currency in circulation, (3) deepening the financial sector and integrating money and foreign exchange markets, (4) reducing banks’ excess reserves at the central bank, and (5) improving data quality and frequency.\n\nExchange Rate Arrangements and Management\n\nChapter 8 considers alternative exchange rate arrangements for the EAC countries in the transition to monetary union, underscoring three main considerations. First, while exchange rate policies differ in important ways across the EAC, the member countries have expressed a desire to achieve a common exchange rate policy during the transition to union. Second, since the transition period will encompass several years, arrangements adopted during it should be consistent with macroeconomic stability and financial development on a country-by-country basis. Third, the transition process should be designed to avoid real exchange rate misalignment in the first few years of the monetary union.\n\nThe chapter concludes that, given the region’s vulnerability to external shocks and the openness of its capital account, a managed float is the appropriate exchange-rate regime during transition to union. This should ensure that national inflation targets are consistent with community-wide convergence criteria for inflation, which would serve as the nominal anchor. The advantages of a managed float are underscored by the uncertain horizon during which union will occur.\n\nFinancial Integration and Framework for Financial Stability\n\nChapter 9 discusses the considerations for the EAC regarding responsibility for financial stability in the envisaged East African Monetary Union. Specifically, financial integration will necessitate the development of a regional financial stability framework—which should encompass a harmonized and a unified approach to supervision and regulation across the region—and appropriate legislation and methods for effective consolidated supervision and home-host cooperation. Financial stability analysis could also be undertaken, involving a review of data definitions and interpretations in order to assess the potential for cross-border contagion through regionally headquartered banks.\n\nSeveral challenges will have to be addressed in the process of financial integration, including strengthening the capacity to monitor the nonbank financial sector and harmonization of supervision and regulation, and arrangements for crisis management and safety nets. These arrangements should be sequenced immediately after completion of the negotiation of the EAC Monetary Protocol.\n\nChapter 10 builds on the introductory issues raised in Chapter 9 by analyzing the degree of financial linkages and flows in the EAC region to understand the associated risks of greater interconnectedness and implications for supervision. Key findings are that while intraregional financial flows are limited, EAC banking systems are linked through cross-country ownership of banks. This makes the region vulnerable to crisis through contagion, if the regionally active banks are not properly supervised. Second, weaknesses in banking supervision in both home and host countries increase the risks of contagion. In particular, some home and host supervisors do not have the capacity to supervise complex financial institutions. Finally, the emergence of financial conglomerations requires closer cooperation among agencies supervising different financial sectors.\n\nChapter 11 empirically investigates whether actions taken under the EAC framework have succeeded in advancing financial integration. It assesses the degree of integration of the financial markets (treasury, interbank, and stock markets) of all five EAC countries, where possible, and examines whether integration has progressed. The empirical results on financial integration in the EAC are mixed but suggest that convergence of investment returns is taking place in all three financial markets assessed in this chapter—treasury bill, interbank, and stock markets. Moreover, the speed of convergence has increased in recent years in the treasury markets (and to lesser extent in the interbank markets). This suggests that financial integration efforts have reduced barriers to financial transactions across borders to some extent, creating incentives for financial institutions to take advantage of arbitrage opportunities across the markets.\n\nChapter 12 reviews recent financial sector assessment programs in the EAC countries from the perspective of regional financial integration, complementing Chapters 9, 10, and 11. It also summarizes the main findings of the regional financial sector assessment programs of 2012/13. Key findings include the need to link up the region’s stock exchanges and depositories to advance capital market integration. The chapter underscores that greater effort is needed to strengthen and expand cross-border retail payments with supporting regulatory frameworks. As cross-border linkages become entrenched, it will be necessary to revisit rules governing the mandates of EAC institutions such as the EAC Secretariat in order to support decision making and delegation of responsibilities.\n\nChallenges and the Way Forward\n\nAs EAC countries have become more integrated with the global economy, their increased interconnectedness will become a channel for spillovers from developments in both advanced and emerging market economies. The transmission of spillover effects of the Great Recession has slowed the pace of growth in emerging markets, in particular the BRICS (Brazil, Russia, India, China, South Africa), with whom EAC countries have increased trade linkages over the last decade.\n\nPolicy frameworks will need to be further strengthened as private capital flows, which tend to be more volatile than official flows, have increased in the context of excess global liquidity. Managing the volatility of private capital inflows and mitigating the macroeconomic impacts of “sudden stops” will increasingly test the robustness of monetary and fiscal policy toolkits. In this context, several EAC countries are moving toward using either the interest rate or inflation as a nominal anchor and have stepped up communications in signaling changes in the stance of monetary policy to the market. At the same time, the exchange rate has been permitted to act as an absorber of external shocks, as demonstrated during the recent food and fuel shocks in 2011 and the coordinated press release by EAC central bank governors.\n\nSustaining robust growth is a key objective and requirement for successful integration. This in turn will require substantial infrastructure investment. The associated financing needs are large and several countries have tapped bilateral nonconcessional financing from BRICS in meeting the demands for scaling up infrastructure investment. However, EAC countries will have to strike a delicate balance in meeting these needs and adhering to the primary convergence criterion on public debt.\n\nThe recent discovery of oil and gas in a number of EAC countries will have far-reaching implications for macroeconomic management and compliance with the macroeconomic convergence criteria. Deficits measured excluding natural resource incomes will need to be monitored carefully. Typically, natural resource incomes have a finite lifetime, based on the size of oil or mineral deposits. Exploiting these resources produces a period of high incomes (associated with license fees, royalties, and other taxes). While this can support a temporary period of higher expenditure, countries often save part of the income stream to extend the period over which higher expenditures can be sustained, and to avoid the sort of sharp rise and subsequent reversal of spending that poses the strongest risks of Dutch disease. Natural resource incomes are also subject to volatility, linked to changes in global commodity prices. Periods of high prices can strengthen fiscal performance, even where there is an underlying deterioration in the nonresource accounts. Given these considerations, EAC countries will need to carefully manage the proceeds from natural resources to avoid creating macroeconomic imbalances, which have been coined “the resource rich curse.” In addition, differences in natural resource endowments will imply varying contributions of natural resources to fiscal revenues. This will pose challenges in the harmonization of the convergence criteria."
