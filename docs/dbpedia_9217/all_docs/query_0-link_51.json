In 1920 the East African Protectorate became the Colony of Kenya, the East Africa Currency Board was set up in December 1919. It introduced a new decimal system based on 100 cents to one East African Florin in 1920 (this coin), abandoning yet retaining the old rupee system - the florin being the same weight as the Indian rupee. This was very short lived, on 1 May 1921 it was replaced by a system based on 100 cents to 1 East African Shilling. This system was expanded on 1 January 1922 to be the official Currency of Kenya, Uganda and Tanganyka."
