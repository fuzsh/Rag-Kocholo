These surveys took place between April 18 and May 27, 2000.\n\nThe areas surveyed included: the city of Kisangani (in collaboration with MSF Holland), the\n\nKatana and Kabare Health Zones, the Kalonge Administrative Zone and approximately 1,000\n\nsquare kilometers surrounding Moba. These sites represent three of the five eastern provinces\n\nwithin DRC and have a collective population of 1.2 million.\n\nThe 1,011 households visited contained 7,339 living residents, who reported 606 deaths among\n\ntheir household members since January 1, 1999. From the information provided the IRC reports\n\nthat:\n\n• 1.7 million excess deaths or more have occurred over the past 22 months as a result\n\nof the fighting in eastern DRC. This equates to 77,000 deaths per month and of that,\n\n26,000 (34%) are children younger than five years of age.\n\n• There are many children younger than two years old missing from the demographic\n\nprofile. Compared to the number of three and four year olds, there are 30% to 40% fewer\n\nchildren under two years of age than would be expected. The data collected indicate that\n\nthe particular hardships endured by women may play a role in the shortage of young\n\nchildren. Specifically within the interviewed families, 3% of full-term births resulted in\n\nmaternal death, and adult death from malnutrition was an almost exclusively female\n\nphenomenon.\n\n• Violent deaths and other “nonviolent” deaths are inseparable in eastern DRC. Those\n\nplaces and times where infectious disease deaths were highest were the same as where\n\nviolent death rates were highest. Moreover, the displacements and economic hardships\n\ninduced by armed combatants play either a direct or an indirect role in all of the excess\n\ndeaths described.\n\n• Violence against civilians appears to be inflicted by all sides. Among the 69 deaths\n\nattributed to violence, family members reported that the deaths were committed by the\n\nInterahamwe and the RCD at a similar frequency.\n\n Violence against civilians appears indiscriminate. Women and children constituted 47%\n\nof the violent deaths reported.\n\n• Eastern DRC is an unchecked incubation zone for disease. In the five surveys\n\nconducted, both endemic and epidemic illnesses are rampant, with major (suspected to be\n\nmore than 500 deaths) outbreaks of cholera, shigella and meningitis reported by\n\nhouseholds. Suspected polio was reported in two of the five areas.\n\n• The overall mortality rate during the year 2000 is higher than it was in 1999. Thus,\n\nnone of the collected information indicates that the rates will decline in the foreseeable\n\nfuture.\n\nAnnex 50\n\nInternational Rescue Committee Bukavu, DR Congo\n\n11\n\nKalonge 21% 14.1\n\nMoba 47% 24.5\n\nZaire 1995, from UNICEF, State of the World’s Children 1997 3.1*\n\n*UNICEF estimates <5 mortality as a function of births, i.e., via a different technique. Thus, the\n\ncalculated <5 CMRs presented are not exactly comparable to the UNICEF value.\n\nThe child mortality rates alone cannot explain the deficiency of young children in Kisangani and\n\nKatana (although the Katana survey last year found an <5 CMR of 10/1,000/mo.). It is likely that\n\nfertility and reproductive outcome issues are playing a part. Minor evidence of this includes: i)\n\nwhile not asked about, five women reported having full-term stillborn children (which were not\n\nincluded as deaths in this report), ii) an estimated 3% of full-term pregnancies in the sample\n\npopulation resulted in a maternal death and iii) adult malnutrition appears to be a\n\ndisproportionately female phenomenon. (In the five surveys, of 15 deaths attributed to malnutrition\n\nin people five years of age and older, 11 (73%) were women with a median age of 25, while only\n\nfour (27%) were males with a median age of nine years.) In the “attribution” of maternal\n\nmortality, the two pregnant women who died of heart attacks during military attacks (one while\n\nbeing shot at, one while running), and the woman who was too pregnant to run from attackers and\n\nwas strangled during/after being raped, were classified as deaths from violence. The woman in\n\nKisangani who died of an induced abortion had her death classified as “other non-infectious.”\n\nThe reason for mentioning these four deaths is to note that there are risks in the DRC associated\n\nwith being pregnant that are not captured by the epidemiological concept of maternal mortality.\n\nEastern DRC is an unchecked incubation zone for disease. Several major disease outbreaks were\n\ndetected during the course of these five surveys, which had not received a significant response (if\n\nany) from the health community. Examples of this include: an estimated 870 suspected meningitis\n\ndeaths in Kisangani (95%, CI = 40 –1,800), family-reported death rates in Moba from cholera and\n\ndysentery of approximately 1% of the sample population, reports of multiple measles deaths in\n\nthree of the five surveyed populations, suspected polio deaths reported in Kalonge (our diagnosis,\n\nnot the families) and seven polio cases last year reported by the Moba physical rehabilitation\n\ncenter.\n\nViolence and infectious disease deaths are inseparably linked. The rates of death from violence\n\nversus the rates of death from all other causes are shown in Figure 15. There is an apparent\n\nassociation between the areas with the most violence-related mortality and the most “other”\n\nmortality. This was seen most dramatically in Kalonge, where when violent deaths increased\n\ndramatically (5.5-fold) during the period after October 1999, the malaria-specific mortality rate\n\nsimultaneously went up 3.5-fold. Many of the Kalonge displaced and the Moba residents reported\n\nthat their family members died of malaria or diarrhea while hiding in the forest after their village\n\nwas attacked. Their statements included that they had no food in the forest, which may have\n\nplayed a large role in their immunological susceptibility\n\nViolence against civilians involves both sides and is somewhat indiscriminate. Over the course\n\nof the five surveys, 69 deaths from violence were reported. Figure 16 shows the age and gender\n\nprofile of those killed. Of note is the fact that only 53% of those killed were males over 14 years\n\nin age. The most common mechanism of murder in all of the age and gender groups was by\n\nshooting except for girls five to 14 years old, whose four deaths were attributed to being burned in\n\ntheir hut, a shooting, an abduction with the body found later and one poisoning. Figure 17 shows\n\nthose to whom the interviewees attributed the deaths. While the numbers of reported deaths from\n\nviolence are small, there seems to be a similar rate of participation in civilian murders by both\n\nsides. In support of the idea that “all sides are complicit and indiscriminate” are the facts that i)\n\nAnnex 50\n\nInternational Rescue Committee Bukavu, DR Congo\n\n12\n\ntwo of three households that had experienced multiple episodes of deaths from violence had the\n\nRCD conduct the murders during one round and the Interahamwe conduct the murders during the\n\nother round; thus, these families could not have been true “enemies” of either, and ii) of 12 RCDattributed\n\nmurders, three (25%) were females, while, similarly, of 18 Interahamwe attributed\n\nmurders, five (28%) were women.\n\nOverall Mortality in Eastern DRC\n\nThere is a dearth of health and mortality data for eastern DRC. Articles in the media and\n\nstatements by political figures have implied that a quantitative documentation of the war death toll\n\nhas occurred, although these estimates seem to be largely speculative. While the 1.2 million\n\npeople within the sampling universe of the five IRC studies are not representative of the\n\napproximately 20 million people in eastern DRC, these surveys probably represent the best\n\nbroad-based data available. Thus, the IRC feels an obligation to provide an estimate of the\n\nnumber of people who have died due to this conflict. This attempt to extrapolate these findings to\n\neastern DRC is done somewhat reluctantly and will systematically attempt to extrapolate\n\nconservatively (to give minimal excess mortality) to avoid these findings later being discredited\n\nas exaggerated or hyperbolic.\n\nThree approaches will be employed to estimate the mortality toll of this conflict. The third, or\n\n“best judgment” approach will be assumed to be the best, but the other two approaches will\n\nprovide insight into the dependence of the outcome on the underlying assumptions. For all three\n\napproaches, the following will be used as inputs:\n\na) Baseline mortality = 1.5 deaths/1,000 population/mo.\n\nb) Place Population of Sample Universe Mortality 1/99 – 4/00 Other\n\nKisangani 613,000 2.6/1,000/mo.\n\nKabare 130,000 2.7/1,000/mo.\n\nKatana 305,000 2.7/1,000/mo.\n\nKalonge 59,000 6.4/1,000/mo. 1-10/99 = 3.5\n\nMoba 100,000 11.4/1,000/mo.\n\nc) Province Population (1996*)\n\nOrientale 5.691 million\n\nN.

Also assume that the rate over the past 22 months has been the\n\nsame as the rate over the survey recall periods of 15.7 to 16.8 months. Thus, the average\n\nAnnex 50\n\nFigure 17: Perpetrators of Killing as\n\nReported by Families, N=69\n\nUnknown\n\n47%\n\nCivilian\n\n6%\n\nRCD\n\n17%\n\nInter.\n\n26%\n\nBandits\n\n3%\n\nBur.

Table 4\n\nestimates the overall number of deaths in the eastern DRC since August 1998.\n\nIt is estimated that approximately 2.5 million people have died as a result of this\n\nwar, above and beyond the million people who might have been expected to die\n\notherwise. Approximately 350,000 of these deaths are believed to have been from\n\nviolence.\n\n6) The mortality rates are increasing.\n\nlRC revisited three of the sites surveyed in the early months of 2000. Two of\n\nthese sites, Katana and Kabare, experienced a 50% or greater increase in the CMR\n\nsince the previous year. In a third location, Lusambo, mortality remained\n\nunchanged. In the two new eastern areas surveyed this year, Kalemie and Kalima,\n\nthe mortality rate has increased over the recall period. Thus, it appears that over\n\nthe past 11 months, the mortality rate has not improved and probably has gotten\n\nworse in eastern DRC.\n\nVII. LIMITATIONS\n\nThere are several limitations to these surveys that should be considered by those who will\n\nuse these data. Some of these include:\n\n• The areas visited may not have been typical of eastern DRC. In particular,\n\nlocal officials and Congolese protested repeatedly that interviewers were\n\ngoing to the safest areas and their findings would understate the severity of\n\nthe situation. Given that adequate security was one of the major criteria\n\nfor selecting sites to visit, this criticism is probably valid.\n\n• There was no follow-up or confirmation of the information provided by\n\ninterviewees. This has two problematic aspects: People may have lied to\n\ninterviewers or may have been mistaken about the cause, month or age of\n\nreported decedents. Interviewers and survey staff are convinced that\n\nfamilies were not inventing deaths, and that the overall CMR estimates are\n\nprobably accurate. The survey staff are equally convinced that some cause\n\nof death data are suspect. For example, less than 10 AIDS-related deaths\n\nwere reported, even though Congo suffers from an AIDS epidemic and\n\ntwo of the visited areas (Kalima and Lusambo) had households report that\n\nTB was one of the two primary causes of death. Likewise, malaria, fever\n\nand diarrhea deaths may not be distinguishablef rom malnutrition. It is\n\nbelieved that violence-related deaths have not been over-diagnosed by the\n\nhouseholds and, if anything, incentives existed to underreport violent\n\ndeaths.\n\nInternational Rescue Committee\n\nMortality in Eastern Democratic Republic of Congo\n\nPagel5\n\nAnnex 51\n\nTable 1: Summary of Mortality Surveys Conducted by IRC in Eastern DRC Since 1998.\n\nPlace & Date Live in CMR- <5 Methods\n\nHHint Deaths/1,000/mo Mort.\n\nKatana, 1/98 - 2/99 1051 3.8 (2.2 - 5.4) 10.1 Spatial grid, clusters spaced lKm.

ILLEGAL EXPLOITATION OF\n\nNATURAL RESOURCES\n\nOriginally this Commission received no assistance from the reconstituted Panel. However\n\nwhen the Commission was about to wind up, some documents were received from the\n\nreconstituted Panel, which prompted this Commission to recall General Kazini for the third\n\ntime. After some difficulty in securing his attendance, the General attended, and after giving\n\nevidence about the documents obtained from the new Panel, produced a number of radio\n\nmessages which affected this Commission’s understanding of what was going on in the the\n\nDemocratic Republic of Congo. so far as the UPDF was 10 concerned, and confirmed certain\n\nsuspicions which this Commission had entertained throughout. That evidence is considered\n\nhere first, as it affects the consideration of the subsequent Headings, taken from the original\n\nPanel Report. The relevant allegations in the original Panel Report involve confiscation,\n\nextraction, forced monopoly and price fixing. Some of the revelations made by General\n\nKazini in the radio messages which he produced go to confirm some of the allegations made\n\nby the original Panel.\n\n13. THE KAZINI REVELATIONS.\n\nThe radio messages concerned the undermentioned subjects:\n\n13.1. UPDF Officers conducting business\n\n20 In answer to the President's radio message (set out in a quotation of the message at\n\nParagraph 14.6 below), General Kazini wrote the following message (dated the 20th\n\nDecember 1998) within hours: --\n\n\"It is true that some officers were getting excited about doing business in\n\nCongo from the beginning but it was discouraged. What is happening is\n\nthat some Ugandans could be in business partnership with some\n\ncommanders but no officers or men are directly involved in trade in Congo.\n\nThere is a big influx of Congolese businessman into Entebbe using our\n\nAircraft on their return journeys they are still facing difficulties to take\n\nitems bought. We have been squeezing to assist them but we cannot handle\n\n30 all their cargo. So I suggest that the Ministry of Commerce or a trade\n\ndelegation from UMA to meet the RCD leadership on your\n\nrecommendation to agree on modalities of doing business with their\n\nAnnex 52\n\n17\n\ncounterparts in Congo. By a copy of this message 2 i/c 1 DIV should not\n\nallow any officer to trade using our aircraft. Meanwhile 2DIV CO, 4DIV\n\nCO to make sure boarders are thoroughly monitored.\"\n\nThe speed at which General Kazini replied shows that he was aware of all these\n\nproblems, would take no real action until the matter became public, and had not\n\npreviously himself made His Excellency the President aware of them.\n\nFrom this message, General Kazini was admitting the following: --\n\n1. That the allegation by the original Panel that some top officers in the UPDF\n\nwere planning from the beginning to do business in Congo was generally\n\ntrue, although the specific examples given were 10 incorrect. On the first\n\noccasion when General Kazini came before this Commission to give\n\nevidence, he denied the allegations in paragraphs 27 and 28 of the original\n\nPanel Report, and was extremely evasive while doing so. In view of his radio\n\nmessage in reply to the President's radio message, he was clearly lying to this\n\nCommission.\n\n2. That Commanders in business partnership with Ugandans were trading in the\n\nCongo, about which General Kazini took no action.\n\n3. That Military aircraft were carrying Congolese businessman into Entebbe,\n\nand carrying items which they had bought in Kampala back to the Congo, but\n\n20 the military were unable to handle all the cargo. On the first occasion that\n\nGeneral Kazini gave evidence before this Commission, he said that it was not\n\nallowed for Congolese businessman or Ugandan businessman to bring items\n\nfrom the Congo on military airplanes. In this he has been revealed to have\n\nlied to this Commission. The whole question of the use of military transport\n\nis considered at Paragraph 14.6 below, and a graphic representation can be\n\nfound below.\n\nAs a result of the President's message, General Kazini took the following steps: --\n\n He directed that officers should not be allowed to trade using military aircraft\n\n He directed that passengers on military aircraft be thoroughly monitored.\n\n30  He took no action in relation to Ugandans in partnership with UPDF officers or\n\nCongolese\n\nAnnex 52\n\n18\n\nThe third paragraph of the President's radio message directed that Ugandan businessmen\n\nshould be given security assistance to do business in Congo in order to alleviate the acute\n\nneeds of the population and to establish links for the future. The radio message itself is clear,\n\nand when this Commission interviewed His Excellency the President, he confirmed that he\n\nhad no intention to assist Congolese businessmen, save as to security, and pointed out that in\n\nhis message he had specifically mentioned Ugandan businessman.\n\nHowever when General Kazini gave evidence to this Commission on the third occasion, he\n\nsaid that he had given directions to assist Congolese businessman to travel back and forth\n\nfrom Congo, and had even allowed them to carry goods from Uganda for sale in the\n\nDemocratic Republic of Congo. His counsel also interrupted 10 his evidence to argue that the\n\nPresidential Radio message included assistance to Congolese businessmen, which it clearly\n\ndid not, save of course in relation to the provision of security.\n\nThis Commission’s researches in comparing the data from the Uganda Revenue Authority\n\nwhich related to collection of customs duty on flights landing at the Military Air Base since\n\n1999, data from Liaison Officers at the Military Air Base and from the Ministry of Defence\n\nrelating to flights for the UPDF, and data from the Civil Aviation Authority showing all\n\nflights recorded by them to the Democratic Republic of Congo, both Civil and Military,\n\nshowed quite clearly that on many occasions, military flights paid for by Ministry of Defence,\n\nor flown on Uganda Air Cargo (flying for Ministry of Defence) were carrying large quantities\n\n20 of coffee in particular back from the Democratic Republic of Congo.\n\nNot only was this originally denied by General Kazini, but also by all of the liaison officers\n\nwho served at the Military Air Base. There was only one admission concerning coffee flown\n\nin from the Democratic Republic of Congo for Mr. Bemba.\n\nAnnex 52\n\n19\n\nFigure 1: Data from URA Customs at Old Airport Entebbe\n\nHowever, as Figure 1 shows, the comparison between Military and Civilian dutiable flights\n\narriving at the Military Air Base shows, for flights during 1999 and 2000 which were\n\nrecorded by URA, military flights and civilian flights were almost equally disposed during\n\n1999, with a wide difference during 2000. There was no data available before 1999 and after\n\nDecember 2001, which is the reason for the dips at each end. General kazini, and the liaison\n\nOfficers at the Military Air Base have been lying to this Commission.\n\nOn the 11th of February 1999 in a radio message General Kazini said that reports had started\n\ncoming to him that officers in the Colonel Peter Kerim 10 sector, Bunia and based at Kisangani\n\nairport were engaging in business contrary to the presidential radio message, and he pointed\n\nout that the cover being used was \"Uganda businessmen / Congolese\".\n\nThis corroborates many of the Original Panel's allegations in respect of officers of the UPDF.\n\n13.2.Gold Mining\n\nOn the 31st of December 1998 General Kazini messaged Major Kagezi, saying that\n\nhis soldiers and detach commanders were writing chits for gold mining and\n\nsmuggling and instructing him to stop this immediately. Major Kagezi replied that his\n\ninvestigations revealed that Lieutenant Okumu had been giving chits, and\n\nrecommended changing his platoon because they had stayed for a long time, but he\n\n20 had been unable to do so because the Commander had refused (an interesting\n\ncomment on co-operation and discipline within the UPDF). On the 1st of January\n\n1999, General Kazini ordered that the platoons be changed and Lieutenant Okumu\n\narrested. This does not agree with the evidence of Lt Okumu who said that he had\n\nAnnex 52\n\n20\n\nalready been arrested from Durba on 27th December 1999. On the 11th of February\n\n1999 General Kazini sent a message to say that he was sending intelligence officers\n\non a fact-finding mission on the gold trade involving UPDF officers and men. This\n\nwas the first time that this Commission had heard of this investigation, and is\n\nsurprised not to have heard about this from Colonel Mayombo, who said that he did\n\nnot conduct any investigations until after the original Panel Report.\n\nAs late as the 15th of February 2000 General Kazini was receiving reports from\n\nProfessor Wamba that UPDF soldiers in Watsa were in conflict with civilians in\n\nrelation to mining, and on 23rd February 2000, he sent a message in which he said\n\nthat he had seen three messages concerning 10 uncoordinated deployments. He pointed\n\nout that no soldier of the UPDF was supposed to guard mines, although Major Kagezi\n\nhad deployed soldiers to Durba. He directed that all soldiers must be withdrawn to\n\nIsiro. This message backs up some of the allegations in the original Panel Report\n\nrelating to mining. It is extremely difficult to reconcile with General Kazini's\n\nevidence that he did not know that the soldiers at Durba had been detached to guard\n\nthe bridge there, and that Lt Okumu’s direct mission written instructions in\n\nSeptember 1999 were to guard the bridge and the airfield.\n\nFurther on the 3rd of October 1999, General Kazini was asking Lieutenant Colonel\n\nSula, Major Kagezi (who had already posted soldiers to Durba against orders) and\n\n20 Captain Kyakabale to let him know if there was any UPDF deployed in either gold or\n\ndiamond mines, directing them to withdraw them immediately and send their names.\n\nGeneral Kazini's actions, radio messages, and evidence to this Commission have been\n\ninconsistent throughout.\n\n13.3. Intelligence/Security Funding\n\nOn the 21st of January 1999 General Kazini complained in a radio message that some\n\ncommanders were getting money from Congolese rebel leadership under the pretext\n\nof intelligence gathering. This is an extremely interesting complaint, given that he\n\nhimself later, in July 2000, instructed Commanders in that area to refer any payment\n\nof security funding to himself at TAC HQ, and is an example of what this\n\n30 Commission is beginning to suspect, that General Kazini was writing all these radio\n\nmessages, and copying many of them to His Excellency the President, to cover\n\nhimself, without any intention that they should be followed.\n\nAnnex 52\n\n21\n\n13.4. Looting\n\nOn the 29th of January 1999 General Kazini was complaining that soldiers of the 19th\n\nBattalion were involved in looting civilians. He directed that soldiers should not man\n\nroadblocks anywhere, and asked for an explanation and details of a specific\n\noccurrence. This was another matter raised by the original panel, and denied by\n\nGeneral Kazini initially, but confirmed by these radio messages.\n\n13.5. Smuggling\n\nOn the 5th of July 1999 General Kazini directed that an investigative team be\n\nstationed in Arua and Nebbi at the customs stations to monitor goods in transit. He\n\nexplained that a dangerous habit was developing where 10 goods supposedly in transit to\n\nCongo were returned to Ugandan markets tax-free. He said that the suspects were\n\narmy officers aided by “Kampala and Arua Boys”. He directed Captain Kyakabale to\n\ntake the appropriate measures. On 23rd August 1999 General Kazini accused the 19th\n\nBattalion of being involved in smuggling in Bunia and Beni sector. On the 25th of\n\nDecember 1999, General Kazini sent a message to, among others Lieutenant Colonel\n\nArocha, Lieutenant Colonel Mugenyi, Lieutenant Colonel Nyakaitana, and Lieutenant\n\nColonel Burundi. He accused of all of them of being suspected of indulging in\n\nsmuggling goods re-entering Uganda territory from the Democratic Republic of\n\nCongo. On the same date he was asking for liaison with the Inspector General of\n\n20 Government to send experts to monitor various customs those on the Uganda border.\n\nHe said that these were border points where goods were smuggled into the country\n\naided by the UPDF without paying taxes. This Commission was able to check this\n\ninformation with the Inspector General of Government, who said that he had never\n\nbeen approached by the UPDF for this purpose. These were the kind of events,\n\ntogether with others referred to below, to which this Commission was referring when\n\nasking Col, Mayombo why he had not investigated such matters. His reply after some\n\nquestioning, and after the witness indicated that he did not know of these matters,\n\nalthough General Kazini clearly did, was:-\n\n“Lt. Col. Mayombo: I am saying My Lord that: At that time I did not\n\n30 investigate it. It was a failure in judgement, I accept.”\n\nWhat General Kazini has done by producing these radio messages is to confirm that\n\nhis information in respect of many of the allegations of misconduct of the UPDF was\n\nthe same as that which reached the original Panel. There is no doubt that his purpose\n\nin producing these messages was to try to show that he was taking action in respect of\n\nAnnex 52\n\n28\n\nthe Democratic Republic of Congo, but that he had gone to Kinshasa at the\n\ninvitation of Laurent Kabila, and there discussed trade possibilities, and in particular\n\nair services. This was at a time when there was every reason to count on the cooperation\n\nof Laurent Kabila, and this Commission sees no problem in such matters as\n\ntrade being discussed at that time.\n\n14.3. Allegations against Kainerugaba Muhoozi\n\nApart from a later general allegation, this is the only time Lt Muhoozi’s name is\n\nmentioned (in Paragraph 28) in the whole original Panel Report.\n\nBefore this Commission Lt Muhoozi said that he went, not to Eastern the Democratic\n\nRepublic of Congo but to Kinshasa on two occasions. The 10 first was in 1997, during\n\nthe regime of Laurent Kabila, when he went to look for a market for meat products on\n\nbehalf of his family ranch, which is well known for the keeping of cattle and the need\n\nfor a market. The second occasion was in early 1998 when he had started working for\n\nCaleb International, Salim Saleh’s firm, for discussions with some potential partners\n\nin the Democratic Republic of Congo with the possibility of developing some mining\n\ninterests there. This was early in the regime of Laurent Kabila, when friendly\n\nrelations were thought to exist between the Kinshasa Government and Uganda.\n\nThis Commission is fully satisfied that these were genuine visits during peacetime to\n\npromote international trade, and this Commission cannot understand why they appear\n\n20 as criticisms in the original Panel Report.\n\n14.4. Allegations against top UPDF Officers\n\nAs to Point 4 above, see Paragraph 13.1 above: General Kazini’s radio message in\n\nreply to that of His Excellency the President shows that, although there was no effect\n\non the policies of the Uganda Government, some officers were excited about the\n\npossibility of self-enrichment in the Democratic Republic of Congo. To that extent\n\nthe allegations in the original Panel Report are true.\n\n14.5. Allegations against General Kazini.\n\nAs to Point 5 above, this Commission has received some evidence in support of the\n\nallegation against General Kazini in relation to his conduct at the inception of the\n\n30 campaign in the Democratic Republic of Congo, From August to December of 1998,\n\nhe was clearly aware of a problem as his radio message shows, but took little action:\n\nAnnex 52\n\n29\n\nhe only appears to have acquainted His Excellency the President of the problem as\n\nlate as December 1998.\n\n14.6.Transportation Networks\n\n14.6.1. Military Air Base\n\nThe original Panel said that the Military Air Base was used during Operation Safe\n\nHaven for transport of goods to and from the Democratic Republic of Congo. The\n\nCommission therefore investigated the operations at the Military Air Base. What\n\nthe Commission found left a lot to be desired.\n\nThe first question to be asked was how a supposedly secure Military Air Base\n\ncame to be used for 10 transport of civilians and goods.\n\nThis Commission asked His Excellency the President about this because it had\n\nbeen intimated to this Commission that this was on reliance on his radio message\n\ndated 10/12/98. Set out below is part of the transcript of his evidence:\n\n……………….when my army went into Congo, I had to give them terms of\n\nreference on all major matters; there is no major matter which we did not\n\nregulate by a document. For instance, on the 15th of December 1998, no, on\n\nthe 10th of December, 1998 at 1500hrs, I sent a message myself to all army\n\nunits in Congo, which I could read for their Lordships: “From President\n\nfor Chief of Staff, Inform Army Commander, Minister-of-State for\n\n20 Defence, and All Stations.\n\n(All stations means all units).\n\nEnsure that there is no officer or man of our forces in Congo who engages\n\nin business. Also report to me any other public servant, whether currently\n\nbased in Congo or not, who tries to engage in business in the Congo.\n\nHowever, other Ugandan businessmen (who are not soldiers or public\n\nservants, including all politicians or their families) ….”\n\nThis is in brackets: (businessmen who are not soldiers or public servants,\n\nincluding all politicians or their families), end of brackets.\n\n“ … should, given the fluid security situation in Congo, be assisted, if\n\n30 necessary, to do business there in order to alleviate the acute needs of the\n\npopulation ….”\n\n(Of the population in Congo).\n\n“… and also to establish links for the future. The purpose of this directive\n\nis to erase the feeling that I ordered our forces into Congo because we\n\nwanted to loot minerals from Congo, and not to defend our security\n\ninterests.”\n\nYour Lordships, if they have not given you this copy of this message, then I\n\nwill give it to you. This is the ….\n\nAnnex 52\n\n50\n\nIf the allegation were true, there would have been a significant number of left hand\n\ndrive cars in the streets of Kampala. This Commission has evidence, and has\n\nobserved, that this is not the case and cannot confirm this allegation.\n\nThe evidence of Adele Lotsove also shows that cars in the Democratic Republic of\n\nCongo are junk, as there are no good roads in the Democratic Republic of Congo, and\n\ntherefore would not be worth stealing and transporting.\n\n15.5. Theft from Banks\n\nParagraph 40 of the original Panel Report alleges that Jean Pierre Bemba had\n\ninstructed his soldiers to empty banks once a town was captured and that the soldiers\n\nhad taken the equivalent of $400,000 from Banque 10 Commerciale du Congo branch at\n\nBumba, $500,000 in Lisala and about $600,000 in Gemena. Jean Pierre Bemba\n\ndenied the allegation. As in the case of coffee referred to in paragraph 15.3 above, he\n\ntold the Commission that he heard of the allegation and wrote to the banks concerned\n\nrequesting them to confirm that money was taken from them by his men during the\n\nliberation of their towns. The banks replied saying that they had never been looted by\n\nhis soldiers. He gave copies of the correspondence to the Commission (Exh.\n\nJPB/7/116) and said that he had also given copies of those documents to the second\n\noriginal Panel. He also pointed out that when a town was about to be captured, the\n\noccupying troops would be ill advised to leave cash in the banks, knowing that it\n\n20 would be lost to them, and converted to funding for the victorious rebels. This\n\nallegation is unlikely to be true.\n\n15.6. Murder of Civilians\n\nIn Paragraph 42 it is alleged that in Bunia Congolese civilians were injured or\n\nmurdered for resisting the attempted seizure of property by “RCD rebels and foreign\n\nsoldiers”. It is not clear whether this is an allegation against the UPDF, but the\n\nallegation is not sufficiently detailed to investigate, or to rely upon. This Commission\n\ndoes however have a record of a General Court Martial in which a soldier was\n\naccused and convicted for murdering civilians who were in custody in Gemena. This\n\nwas much later in April 2001, but indicates that Uganda appears to have taken at least\n\n30 one such allegation seriously.\n\n15.7. Organised Looting\n\nIn Paragraph 43 and 44, the highest army commanders of Uganda are alleged to have\n\nencouraged, organized and coordinated looting, and in particular General Kazini is\n\nAnnex 52\n\n51\n\nsaid to have appointed loyal commanders and reliable civilian Congolese to secure\n\nhis network in areas rich in mineral resources. The appointment of Adele Lotsove was\n\nquoted as an example, and is further dealt with in Paragraph 71. This Commission has\n\nconsidered the matter at Paragraph 15.8 below of this report. In particular, it should\n\nbe born in mind that General Kazini was aware of looting, as his radio message of\n\n29/1/99 shows, and was inappropriately involved in promoting Victoria Diamonds,\n\nindicating actions consistent with the allegations of the original Panel, which cannot\n\nbe totally ruled out.\n\n15.8.Allegations against Uganda\n\n15.8.1. Appointment o 10 f Adele Lotsove\n\nIn paragraph 71 of original Panel Report it was stated that the illegal exploitation\n\nof natural resources of Democratic Republic of Congo was facilitated by the\n\nadministrative structures established by both Uganda and Rwanda. The original\n\nPanel cited as an example the appointment as Governor of Ituri Province of Adele\n\nLotsove on 18th June, 1999 by Major General Kazini.\n\nThis Commission has seen the letter of appointment among the exhibits. The\n\nCommission has also heard evidence on oath from Madam Adele Lotsove and\n\nGeneral Kazini on the issue. Madam Adele Lotsove told the Commission that she\n\nwas a native of Ituri. She was once the 1st Deputy Governor of Kisangani in-\n\n20 Charge of Upper Zaire Province or Haut Zaire. She said that Ituri Province was\n\none of the Provinces of Zaire in 1962, but was abolished by Mobutu. During a\n\nNational Conference in 1991 it was proposed that the whole of Zaire should be\n\ndivided into 28 Provinces. Ituri was supposed to be one of the Provinces, but the\n\nproposal was never carried out. So when she was appointed the 1st Vice Governor\n\nof Kisangani, she considered that as an opportunity to implement the 1991\n\nproposal by proclaiming Ituri a Province as that was the aspiration of her people.\n\nHer aim was to adopt the Ugandan model of administration and political system,\n\nwhich she had seen during her stay in Nebbi in Uganda.\n\nWhen she discussed with General Kazini her aspirations and ambition, she found\n\n30 him very receptive. Since General Kazini was the one in charge of Security she\n\nasked him to take charge of her security whilst she fought for the creation of Ituri\n\nProvince. The letter written by General Kazini dated 18/6/99 allegedly appointing\n\nher a Provisional Governor in-Charge of the Districts of Ituri and HAUT–UELE\n\nAnnex 52\n\n53\n\nrecorded. In those circumstances this Commission is at a loss to work out what\n\ninformation gathered by the original Panel could clearly indicate that such\n\npayments were made, and this Commission therefore doubts this conclusion.\n\nThere is one additional consideration which does not seem to have been borne in\n\nmind by the original Panel, which is that Adele Lotsove was only in office for\n\nsome 3 months before she was dismissed by Professor Wamba, and would\n\ntherefore have had little time to get involved in such matters.\n\n15.8.2. Knowledge of Key Ugandan Officials\n\nIn Paragraph 45 it is alleged that key officials in the Government of Uganda were\n\naware of the situation on the ground: and further, in 10 the case of gold, that the\n\nincreased production would have alerted any government.\n\nIt has proved impossible to trace or investigate the allegation in Paragraph 45,\n\nbecause the key officials and the sources of information upon which the original\n\nPanel relies are not given. In evidence on oath before this Commission, this\n\nallegation has been denied in toto. As to the allegation relating to the levels of\n\nproduction of mineral resources, in particular gold, this Commission has dealt\n\nwith this at Paragraph 21.1 below\n\n16. SYSTEMATIC AND SYSTEMIC EXPLOITATION\n\nIn Paragraphs 46-54 of the original Panel Report, the original Panel allege that a company\n\n20 (Dara Forêt ) used illicit business practices and complicity with occupying forces and the\n\nGovernment (presumably the Government of Uganda ) as well as its international connections\n\nto exploit the natural resources of the Congo. The original Panel conducted a case study\n\nwhich is alleged to support this proposition.\n\nThe allegations of impropriety concern Dara Forêt, Dara Great Lakes Industries and\n\nassociated companies, and the Uganda Government.\n\n16.1.Timber : Dara Forêt and Dara Great Lakes International.\n\nThis Commission reproduces here the example according to the original Panel Report.\n\nEvidence brought, and severely tested by this Commission, is interpolated together with this\n\nCommission’s comments.\n\nAnnex 52\n\n55\n\nTimber harvested in this region, which is occupied by the Ugandan army\n\nand RCD-ML, has exclusively transited or remained in Uganda. Our own\n\ninvestigation in Kampala has shown that mahogany originating in the\n\nDemocratic Republic of the Congo is largely available in Kampala, at a\n\nlower price than Ugandan mahogany. This difference in price is simply due\n\nto the lower cost of acquisition of timber. Timber harvested in the\n\nDemocratic Republic of the Congo by Uganda pays very little tax or none at\n\nall.\n\nThere is no evidence before this Commission that Uganda as a country or as a Government\n\nharvests timber in the Democratic Republic of Congo. This 10 Commission doubts that the\n\nallegation in the Report is correct. Timber does come across the border as an import, and there\n\nis no doubt that timber is also smuggled through the porous borders. Congo timber is cheaper\n\nin the market because it is usually cut by chain saws, which are not allowed in Uganda. Such\n\ndocumentation as this Commission has seen indicates that timber cut in the Democratic\n\nRepublic of Congo is dutiable there on export, and that such duties are levied by the rebel\n\nauthorities and paid.\n\nThis Commission toured the Kampala Timber Market at the Ndeeba area. The Commission\n\nfound that timber from Congo is available in the market. The timber from Congo is mainly\n\nhardwood.\n\n20 The Commission found that timber from Congo is cheaper than those from Uganda. The\n\nreason for the difference in price depends on the method of cutting the timber. In Uganda\n\ntimber is processed either by handsaw or pit saw or by sawmills or what is commonly known\n\nas machine cut. Timber from Congo is processed by chain saw. Timber processed with\n\nhandsaws has a smooth surface while those cut with chain saw have rough or uneven surface.\n\nChain saws are illegal in Uganda.\n\nTransit timber is always accompanied by Forest Products Movement Permit issued by the\n\nDistrict Forest Offices. One needs to get a concession from the Forestry Department to cut\n\ntimber from Forest Reserves. The application is made through the District Officer of the area\n\nwhere the Forest Reserve is situated. It is then forwarded to the headquarters in Kampala\n\n30 where it is processed and issued.\n\nThis Commission was informed that there is a ban on raw timber export. Only finished or\n\nsemi-finished wood products are permitted to be exported.\n\nIn addition, customs fees are generally not paid when soldiers escort those\n\ntrucks or when orders are received from some local commanders or\n\nAnnex 52\n\n56\n\nGeneral Kazini. Timber from the Democratic Republic of the Congo is\n\nthen exported to Kenya and Uganda, and to other continents. The Panel\n\ngathered from the Kenyan port authorities that vast quantities of timber are\n\nexported to Asia, Europe and North America.\n\nThe Panel also discovered during its investigation that individual Ugandan\n\nloggers violated forestry legislation, recognized by their ally RCD-ML, by\n\nlogging (extracting) the timber directly. According to the Congolese\n\nlegislation on the permis de coupe, only individual Congolese nationals are\n\nallowed to harvest timber and only in small quantities. Foreigners must\n\napply for the larger 10 concessions. Initially, Ugandans operated in\n\npartnership with a Congolese permit holder. Soon, the Ugandans began to\n\npay the Congolese to sub-lease the permit and, subsequently, to obtain the\n\nlicence in direct violation of the law.\n\nIn so far as the above relates to Dara Forêt, Mr. Kotiram has told this Commission that he has\n\nnot yet cut a single tree within his concession. He has given good and sufficient reason for\n\nthat, and this Commission will recite it in due course.\n\nDuring a visit to Mpondwe/ Kasindi and also at Arua/ Ariwari, this Commission spoke to the\n\nCongolese Officers there, and they denied strongly that it would be possible for UPDF to\n\ninfluence the passage of merchandise, or for their commanders to give orders in that regard. It\n\n20 is true that large quantities of timber transit Uganda for export to Europe and America, in the\n\nordinary course of trade.\n\nIn so far as individual Ugandan loggers are concerned, this Commission has no way of\n\ninvestigating this non-specific matter: This Commission has had evidence that there are\n\nUgandans who go over to the Congo and buy trees by negotiating with individual Congolese\n\npermit holders or Chiefs, and import the timber once cut to Uganda, which helps to account\n\nfor the presence of Congolese hardwood in the Uganda market. This Commission was\n\ninformed that the low price of Congolese hardwood is due to the fact that Congolese timber is\n\nharvested and cut with chain saws, while chain saws are not permitted in Uganda. The\n\nefficiency of chain saws accounts for the increase in cross border trade. This cross border\n\n30 trade has been carried on throughout living memory.\n\nTimber extraction in the Democratic Republic of the Congo and its export\n\nhave been characterized by unlawfulness and illegality. Besides extracting\n\ntimber without authorization in a sovereign country and in violation of the\n\nlocal legislation, DARA-Forest consistently exported its timber without any\n\ncertification procedure.\n\nIn this Paragraph the original Panel raise the whole question of de facto control of\n\nadministration which this Commission has dealt with under the heading of “Illegality” at\n\nParagraph 11 above.\n\nAnnex 52\n\n58\n\ncompanies, either personally, or by his interest in yet another company, Royal Star\n\nHoldings, which, while registered in Uganda, is a wholly Thai owned Company. Since the\n\nshareholding in Nyota Wood is much the same, presumably it falls under the same umbrella.\n\nThis is the evidence of Mr. Kotiram, and probably in practice it is true: but probably also\n\nthese are not in law subsidiaries of Dara Group, (a company registered in the Virgin Islands)\n\nsince that company does not appear to hold any direct interest in any of the companies.\n\nThen it can be shown that there was no collusion between Nyota Wood and the Ministry of\n\nWater, Land and Forests of Uganda, because one application which was made to the Ministry,\n\nwhich, if the original Panel is right, would have been essential to the alleged conspiracy, was\n\n10 refused by the Ministry.\n\nIn May 2000, DGLI signed a contract for forest stewardship certification\n\nwith SmartWood and the Rogue Institute for Ecology and Economy in\n\nOregon, United States of America.\n\nThis is not true. Smartwood is the certifying Agency: the Rogue Institute for Ecology and\n\nEconomy was an agency whom Mr. Kotiram contracted to advise him on SmartWood’s\n\nrequirements for certification. Thereafter Dara contacted another Company, UNIQUE,\n\nWegerhäuser & Partner, who later gave a presentation to the reconstituted Panel. UNIQUE\n\nwere advising Dara on the way to go about certification of their concessions in Democratic\n\nRepublic of Congo and in Uganda.\n\n20 On 21 March 2000, the Director of the DARA group, Prossy Balaba, sent a\n\nletter to the Commissioner asking him to allow an official of SmartWood to\n\nvisit certain forests, such as Budongo and Bugoma; he was due to visit the\n\nregion in mid-April.\n\nProssy Balaba was not “the director of the Dara Group”. She was a director and minority\n\nshareholder of the Ugandan Company referred to above as DGLI. In that regard it will be\n\nnoted that Mr. Kotiram set up his companies with himself in control, supported by the\n\nparticipation of local directors and shareholders. This is quite normal, and indeed required in\n\nsome countries. In any event, for a Thai National whose grasp of French and English is not\n\nthat good, it is certainly advisable.\n\n30 It is true that the request above was made : this Commission has a copy of the letter.\n\nAnnex 52\n\n61\n\nDemocratic Republic of the Congo of minerals such as cassiterite and\n\ncoltan in trucks. During the original Panel’s visit to Bunia it was reported\n\nthat other products were loaded in trucks which are supposed to carry\n\ntimber only; it is likely that coltan and cassiterite were these products.\n\nMoreover, the fraud extends to the forging of documents and declarations\n\n“originating” in Kinshasa.\n\nThe confusion between Dara Forêt and DGLI, on the basis of the evidence, exists only in the\n\nmind of the original Panel. These appear to this Commission to be two separate Companies,\n\nregistered in two separate countries. Mr. Kotiram agrees that Dara Forêt has been exporting\n\ncoltan for which he has a licence, which he has produced to this 10 Commission. It does not\n\nappear to be forged. The mineral has been sent in transit through Uganda. Mr. Kotiram has\n\nproduced before this Commission Customs documents which have been verified for this\n\nCommission by URA. There is no evidence whatever that any of the Dara Companies have\n\nbeen dealing with diamonds or gold.\n\nThe original Panel is not specific as to the forgery alleged: but this Commission suspect that\n\nthe problem may arise from the use by rebels of original forms left by the Kinshasa\n\nGovernment before the rebellion. In any event, this Commission would be slow to accuse\n\nparties of criminal offences such as fraud and forgery without being able to set out specific\n\ndetails with particulars\n\n20 The logging rate was alarming around Butembo, Beni, Boga and\n\nMambassa. The RCD-ML administration acknowledged its lack of control\n\nover the rate of extraction, the collection of taxes on logging activities and\n\nthe customs fees at the exit points. On the basis of eyewitness accounts,\n\nsatellite images, key actors’ acknowledgements and the Panel’s own\n\ninvestigation, there is sufficient evidence to prove that timber extraction is\n\ndirectly related to the Ugandan presence in Orientale Province. This has\n\nreached alarming proportions and Ugandans (civilians, soldiers and\n\ncompanies) are extensively involved in these activities. In May 2000, RCDML\n\nattributed a concession of 100, 000 hectares to DARA-Forest. Since\n\n30 September 1998, overall DARA-Forest has been exporting approximately\n\n48, 000 m3 of timber per year.\n\nUPDF presence in Orientale Province provided the security and access to overseas markets\n\ndenied to the Congolese for so long. One would therefore expect to see increased activity in\n\nthe area, not only by Dara Forêt but by other companies as well.\n\nSo far as Dara Forêt is concerned, while Mr. Kotiram agrees the figures quoted, he tells this\n\nCommission that in his concession he has not cut even a single tree, and he has given this\n\nCommission good and sufficient reason for this. The source of his timber has been from\n\nAnnex 52\n\n62\n\nindividuals, in accordance with a long standing practice outlined to this Commission by\n\nanother witness.\n\nThis Commission is extremely concerned at the approach of the original Panel to this subject.\n\nNowhere in the whole of this passage is the reliability of sources quoted, but, considering the\n\nemphasis put on these alleged events, the original Panel must have come to the conclusion\n\nthat it was safe to rely on its undisclosed and apparently un-evaluated sources. Yet the\n\nperception of those sources, and that of the original Panel, was quite clearly wrong. A short\n\ninterview with Mr. Kotiram and his associates would have established the truth, but he was\n\nnever approached, according to his evidence. This problem casts doubt on the original Panel’s\n\ncollection and reliance upon information given to it, not only 10 in respect of Dara Forêt, but\n\nthroughout the Report, given the emphasis placed upon this so-called Case Study.\n\nFrom the evidence, this Commission has come to the conclusion that the investigation by the\n\noriginal Panel of Dara Forêt was fundamentally flawed and is unable to find support for any\n\nsingle allegation made in this so-called Case Study.\n\n16.1.1. Allegations against His Excellency the President and his family\n\nThe original Panel say :\n\nSome unconfirmed information indicates that members of President\n\nMuseveni’s family are shareholders of DGLI, although more investigation\n\nis needed.\n\n20 As above, this Commission agrees that a great deal more investigation is needed\n\nbefore such an allegation appears in a report to a United Nations body. This\n\nCommission’s own investigations with the Companies Registry reveal nothing\n\nwhatever of that nature. All the relevant witnesses were called, and all the\n\nCompanies Registry files were obtained. The allegations are specifically denied by\n\nMr. Kotiram, Prossy Balaba, Salim Saleh, Jovial Akandwanaho, and, for himself,\n\nby His Excellency the President\n\nDuring a consideration of the link between exploitation of resources by the\n\nDemocratic Republic of Congo and the continuation of the conflict, the\n\nreconstituted Panel point out that Dara Forêt registered as a Congolese registered\n\n30 Company in Kinshasa in March 1998: it will be remembered that that was at a\n\ntime when relationships between Kinshasa and Kampala were good, and trade\n\nopportunities were being investigated (see Paragraph 14.2 above). Then in June\n\nAnnex 52\n\n69\n\nLt. Col. Mayombo: I am aware that a Lt. Okumu, who was in charge of\n\na platoon, got involved with civilians by issuing chits that they could mine\n\nand he was arrested by the overall operational commander and his case\n\nwas investigated by the Special Investigations Branch of the Military\n\nPolice.\n\nHe promised to let this Commission have details of the investigation, but has\n\nnever returned with that information. This would have assisted this Commission’s\n\ninvestigations enormously.\n\nGeneral Kazini at first said that the officer was reprimanded for his offences: later\n\nhe said that there was a court martial which acquitted 10 him. The entry of reprimand\n\non this officer’s record has never been produced. Lt Okumu said that he was never\n\neven investigated in respect of any offences relating to mines, but that he was\n\ncleared of any charges in respect of selling fuel.\n\nThis has been a cover up: and it is in respect of the conduct of Lt Col Mugenyi, a\n\nsenior officer whom this Commission has caught out in lies and contradictions of\n\na serious nature, Maj. Sonko, who is not fit to fill the rank which he has attained,\n\nand Lt Okumu, who also lied to this Commission, and whose misconduct has been\n\nbadly investigated. Particularly this Commission is unable to reject the allegation\n\nby the original Panel (for this is the purpose of the cover-up) that UPDF soldiers\n\n20 were posted at mines to take contributions of gold from miners to allow them to\n\nmine.\n\nThe evidence of Major General Kazini, General Jeje Odong and Lt. Col. Noble\n\nMayombo clearly shows that the incident did happen and that the culprits were Lt.\n\nDavid Okumu and the soldiers under his command. Lt. Col. Mugenyi claimed that\n\nLt. David Okumu was investigated and found innocent. This Commission has\n\nfound that no proper investigation was conducted because Lt. Col. Sonko who was\n\ninstructed by Lt. Col. Mugenyi to investigate the matter was also implicated in the\n\nmatter. His conclusion therefore did not come as a matter of surprise to the\n\nCommission.\n\n30 The evidence about the final investigation of this matter was extremely unclear.\n\nGeneral Kazini promised to let this Commission have a copy of it: he took no\n\naction for many months, and on his last appearance stated that the matter had\n\ncome before a General Court Martial. He said that he had tried to get a copy of the\n\nproceedings, and had been told that they could not be released to him for reasons\n\nAnnex 52\n\n71\n\nhowever, Maj. Sonko referred to a quite different incident in which two\n\nsoldiers from Bunia were said to have connived with three FAC soldiers from\n\nWatsa Barracks who harassed and robbed civilians. According to his report the\n\ndetach managed to get the stolen money back and to restore it to its rightful owner.\n\nThe whole matter was indecipherable, and amounts to just another example of the\n\nfrustrations one encounters when one tries to investigate what was going on within\n\nthe UPDF. However, in the Kazini Revelations at Paragraph 13.2 above, it is\n\nobvious that there is confirmation of some of the original Panel’s allegations.\n\n16.2.3. Trainees used as Convincible Labour to Mine\n\nIn Paragraph 58 the original Panel states that local 10 Congolese were used in what\n\nthe original Panel termed as “Convincible labour” to mine gold, diamonds or\n\ncoltan. The original Panel gives, as an example, Bondo locality in Equator\n\nProvince where young men from 12 to 18 years recruited by Jean- Pierre Bemba\n\nwere given one-hour morning physical training in the morning, and then sent to\n\ngold mines to dig for gold on behalf of the Ugandans and Bemba. Jean Pierre\n\nBemba denied the allegation concerning the recruitment of young men from the\n\nages of 12 to 18 years. He stated that the minimum age of recruits was originally\n\n17 years, but that it was later put at 18 years. Even when he was told that the\n\nCommission had had evidence from a journalist who showed some video of some\n\n20 young people being trained, Jean Pierre Bemba insisted on saying that the\n\nminimum age was 17 years. He could not see the purpose of recruiting 12-year-old\n\nyoung men.\n\nThe UPDF officers and men this Commission interviewed have admitted that\n\nJean-Pierre Bemba was an ally and that they trained the rebels under his\n\ncommand, but denied that they trained young men recruited by him to mine gold\n\ndiamonds or coltan. Jean-Pierre Bemba has also denied the allegation. Since the\n\nnames of the alleged eyewitnesses who gave information to the original Panel\n\nwere not disclosed, this Commission is unable to investigate the matter further,\n\nconcludes that there it is unable to find evidence to support this allegation\n\n30 16.2.4. Foreign Labour\n\nThe allegation in Paragraph 60 of the original Panel Report is that occupying\n\nforces brought manpower from their home countries to mine in Congo. UPDF was\n\none of the occupying forces, but Uganda, unlike Rwanda, was not mentioned in\n\nAnnex 52\n\n72\n\nconnection with that pattern of organised extraction of minerals from Congo.\n\nThis Commission has not received evidence that tends to prove the allegation. The\n\nprobability is that the original Panel did not find that Uganda was involved and\n\nthat was the reason why Uganda was not specifically mentioned by the original\n\nPanel. Accordingly this Commission rejects it as a mere allegation so far as\n\nUganda is concerned.\n\n16.3.Wildlife.\n\n16.3.1. Poaching in Garambwa National Park\n\nParagraph 61 of the original Panel Report states that between 1995 and 1999, 30%\n\nof elephants were killed in Garambwa National 10 Park in areas controlled by\n\nUgandan troops and Sudanese rebels, and that there are similar problems in other\n\nparks. There is no evidence available as to who was responsible for this. There is\n\nhowever evidence that although there was a detach at Durba, near the Park, its\n\nduties did not cover the Park. Congolese Security Reports produced complained of\n\npoaching by SPLA in Garambwa Park and there were other reports of trouble\n\ncaused by the SPLA there. (Exh. FM/07/102). It should also be noted that the\n\noriginal Panel’s allegation covers the period from 1995 to 1999. Ugandan troops\n\ndid not reach the area until late 1998, and therefore could only have been involved\n\nin this allegation, if at all, for a very short time.\n\n20 16.3.2. Tusks seized in Isiro\n\nIt is also said in Paragraph 61 of the original Panel Report that RCD-ML\n\ntemporarily seized about 3 tons of tusks in Isiro. After strong pressure, it is said,\n\nfrom Uganda, the cargo was released and transferred to Kampala.\n\n16.3.3. Tusks seized from Col Mugenyi near Garambwa National Park\n\nParagraph 62 of the original Panel Report alleges that Lt. Col. Mugenyi of the\n\nUPDF and a crew of his soldiers were found with 800 kgs of elephant tusks in\n\ntheir car near Garambwa Park. The Uganda Government is alleged to have\n\nreceived notification of the incident.\n\nThe original Panel Report does not state the date on which he was found nor by\n\n30 whom he was found, nor to which department or officer of the Uganda\n\nGovernment Report was made. The Uganda Government denies in its response\n\nthat it received notification of this incident as alleged in the original Panel Report.\n\nAnnex 52\n\n81\n\nhas harmed Uganda, and allowed investigators to conclude that His Excellency the\n\nPresident must have been involved in illegal exploitation of the natural resources of\n\nthe Congo. This Commission takes the matter very seriously indeed, and recommends\n\nthat the matter be further investigated by the relevant authorities for further action.\n\n18.4. Take Air Ltd\n\nIn 1998 Take Air, in which General Salim Saleh was a shareholder and director,\n\nsubmitted invoices to UPDF and was paid Shs. 111 million for flights to the Congo\n\nthat could not be identified. Lt. General . Saleh could not explain the reason for the\n\npayment. He promised to check with his staff and report back to the Commission.\n\nThis was not done. Months later the General appeared before 10 the Commission again.\n\nWhen asked about the documents he had promised including manifests, he said that\n\nhe had so far failed to get them. Take Air had closed in late 1998 and he (Saleh) had\n\ndifficulties in tracing its Managing Director who left Uganda in March 1999. To-date\n\nthe payment is still not accounted for. Further investigations are necessary and\n\nrecommended.\n\n18.5. Other Private Companies\n\nIn Paragraph 79 of the UN Report it is alleged that a number of Companies were\n\ncreated to facilitate the illegal activities in Democratic Republic of Congo. On the\n\nUgandan side, it is alleged that military officials created new companies and\n\n20 businesses using prête-noms. It is said that most of the companies are owned by\n\nprivate individuals or groups of individuals. Trinity and Victoria Group are\n\nspecifically named in Paragraph 80 as some of the said companies.\n\n18.5.1. Victoria Group\n\nVictoria Group is said to be chaired by one Mr. Khalil and has its headquarters in\n\nKampala and is owned jointly by Muhoozi Kainerugaba, son of President\n\nMuseveni, Jovial Akandwanaho and her husband. It is said the Group deals in\n\ndiamonds, gold and coffee. These products are purchased from Isiro, Bunia,\n\nBumba, Bondo, Buta and Kisangani. The Group is also suspected in the making of\n\ncounterfeit currency.\n\n30 The evidence the Commission has on oath from Mrs. Ketra Tukuratiire, the Acting\n\nRegistrar – General, is that Victoria Group is not known in Uganda. It is neither\n\nregistered as local Company nor as a foreign Company. Apart from Khalil whom\n\nthis Commission has not been able to interview, as he is a non-resident in the\n\nAnnex 52\n\n82\n\nCountry, all the alleged owners of the Groups have denied any connection with\n\nthe Group.\n\nFurther evidence this Commission has received however, shows that there is a\n\nCompany known as La Societe Victoria which is owned by two people who have\n\nnot been mentioned throughout the evidence. The Company is registered in Goma\n\nand deals in diamonds, gold and Coffee which it purchases from Isiro, Bunia,\n\nBumba, Bondo, Buta and Kisangani. The Company pays taxes to MLC to back up\n\nwhat the Army Commander, Major General Kazini, terms’ “the effort in the armed\n\nstruggle”.\n\nFor that reason, General Kazini gave specific 10 instructions to UPDF Commanders\n\nin Isiro, Bunia, Beni, Bumba, Bondo and Buta to allow the Company to do\n\nbusiness uninterrupted in the areas under their command.\n\nThough General Kazini has denied on numerous occasions that he has any\n\nconnection with Khalil and that he only knew him casually, from the special\n\nfavours he gave to La Societe Victoria and the lies he told about his dealings with\n\nthe Company, one cannot resist the conclusion that he has some interest in the\n\nCompany, though this Commission has no conclusive evidence to prove it.\n\nIt is clear, however that the steps he took to facilitate the interests of the Company\n\nwere above and beyond the call of duty, and further, inappropriate to the UPDF’s\n\n20 role of providing security.\n\nAs regards the alleged dealings of Mr. Khalil with Jovial Akandwanaho in\n\ndiamonds, this Commission originally had only the evidence of Jovial on the\n\nissue. She admitted that she knew Khalil and that herself and Khalil at one time\n\nestablished a Lebanese Restaurant known as Leban (U) Ltd on Bombo Road in\n\nKampala, in the middle of 1999. They are no longer operating the restaurant.\n\nJovial has denied that, apart from restaurant business, she had had any other\n\ndealings with Khalil and in particular, diamonds. However under the heading “The\n\nDiamond Link” at Paragraph 21.3 below, and particularly at Paragraph 21.3.5\n\nbelow, this Commission has come to the conclusion that Jovial’s participation in\n\n30 Khalil’s operations, and Victoria in particular, cannot be excluded.\n\nAnnex 52\n\n88\n\nThis Commission has asked the Inspector General of Government to provide\n\ncopies of the declaration of assets of Salim Saleh unfortunately he has not made one\n\nfor any of the past years, nor yet for 2002.\n\n20.2. Jovial Akandanawaho\n\nJovial told the Commission that she has never been in any part of the Democratic\n\nRepublic of the Congo. Salim Saleh denied business dealings with any of the persons\n\nmentioned. Jovial stated that she co-owned a restaurant with Khalil in Kampala for a\n\nlimited period in 1999, but denied having any other commercial dealings with him.\n\nShe further denied the allegation that she wanted control of Kisangani diamond\n\nmarket. She and her husband refuted the allegation that 10 she was at the root of the\n\nKisangani wars. However, this Commission has evidence connecting Jovial with\n\nKhalil and Victoria in Diamond smuggling, which is considered at Paragraph 21.3.5\n\nbelow where this Commission has found that it is unable to rule out the participation\n\nof Jovial Akandwanaho in the diamond smuggling operations of Victoria, revealing\n\nthat there is some truth in the allegations made against her by the original Panel.\n\n20.3. General James Kazini\n\nIn Para 89, General James Kazini is said to be the third key actor. It is alleged that he is the\n\nmaster in the field, the orchestrator, organizer and manager of most illegal activities related to\n\nthe UPDF presence in the Democratic Republic of the Congo. He is said to rely on the\n\n20 established military network and former comrades and collaborators such as Colonels\n\nTinkamanyire and Mugenyi and to be close to Messrs. Nyamwisi, Tibasiima, Lumbala, Jean-\n\nPierre Bemba all of whom have facilitated his illegal dealings in diamond, coltan, timber,\n\ncounterfeit currency and imports of goods and merchandise in Equator and Oriental\n\nProvinces.\n\nGeneral Kazini is accused of many wrong doings in the original Panel Report, and this\n\nCommission has tried to deal with the allegations in the same order as did the original Panel.\n\nHe was examined by the Commission at length, but he denied any involvement in business\n\nactivities. One of the witnesses, Ateenyi Tibasiima, confirmed what Kazini had said. He\n\nstated in an affidavit that he had not helped or seen Kazini in business activities. However,\n\n30 consideration of General Kazini’s involvement with Khalil and Victoria can be found at\n\nParagraph 21.3.4 below. Throughout this report, General Kazini’s name surfaces in respect of\n\nmany allegations which relate to the misbehaviour of senior officers of the UPDF in the DRC,\n\nin respect of which he has taken little action: he has lied to this Commission on many\n\noccasions. Whilst this Commission bears in mind that he was the man on the ground, and that\n\nAnnex 52\n\n89\n\nmany allegations have been freely made from the DRC which have not stood up to close\n\nexamination, nevertheless this Commission has found that many of those made against\n\nGeneral Kazini are supportable.\n\nGeneral Kazini’s alleged dealings with Jean-Pierre Bemba in respect of coffee beans is\n\ncovered by Paragraph 17.1 above. He and a number of other witnesses have stated that they\n\nwere never asked to meet with the original Panel. Aside from his meddling in local\n\nadministration when he appointed Mme Adele Lotsove a Provisional Governor and created a\n\nnew Ituri Province for which he was reprimanded (see Para 15.8), the Commission has not\n\nfound any evidence to implicate him as accused in the original Panel Report.\n\nHowever, the Commission has received documentary evidence implicating 10 General Kazini in\n\nother local administrative matters. In one case he instructed UPDF Commanders in Isiro,\n\nBunia, Beni, Bumba, Bondo and Buta to allow one company, La Societe Victoria, to do\n\nbusiness in coffee, diamonds, gold uninterrupted in areas under their control as it had been\n\ncleared of taxation by the President of MLC, Jean Pierre Bemba. He concluded by saying\n\nthat: “Anything to do with payment to you in form of security funding, it will be done through\n\nOSH-Tac HQS”, i.e. his office.\n\nIn another letter addressed to the Governor of Kisangani, the Major General attached a copy\n\nof communication from the chairman of MLC and his own comments and stated that\n\nVICTORIA had officially cleared taxes with MLC authorities and asked the Governor “to\n\n20 leave VICTORIA do his business and he will continue to pay taxes to MLC to back up the\n\neffort in the armed struggle”.\n\nWhile General Kazini and other UPDF officer denied collecting or receiving any money from\n\nCongolese for their services, the General’s first letter above leaves little doubt that some of\n\nthe UPDF Senior Officers expected money from Congolese for security purposes. His\n\nevidence makes clear that he also expected it, and that the Commanders would keep the\n\nmoney for themselves, rather than accounting to him for it.\n\n20.3.1. General Kazini's Coltan.\n\nLetter from General Kazini requesting one Thomas Mathe as minister of finance\n\nof RCD-ML to allow his Coltan through customs.(Document 5)\n\n30 On the face of it this appears to be a proper copy letter from General Kazini (who\n\nthen was a Brigadier). However it is apparent that there are a number of strange\n\nthings about it. In the first place Captain Balikudembe’s name is spelt wrong. He\n\nAnnex 52\n\n108\n\nand the mining incidents referred to in Paragraphs 57 and 59 of the original Panel Report,\n\nwith which this Commission has dealt at Paragraph 16.2.1 above.\n\nA serious consideration of those holding Senior Posts in the UPDF is called for, and\n\nrecommended by this Commission .\n\n21. ECONOMIC DATA : CONFIRMATION OF THE ILLEGAL EXPLOITATION\n\nOF THE NATURAL RESOURCES OF THE DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC OF\n\nCONGO\n\nIn Paragraphs 94 to 108 economic data is set out in the report.\n\n21.1.Gold\n\nThe conclusion of the original Panel Report in relation to 10 the economic data was that\n\nthe official data provided by Uganda authorities, contained substantial discrepancies.\n\nThe original Panel pointed out that the export figures for gold were consistently\n\ngreater than production values. The original Panel attributed the gap to the\n\nexploitation of the natural resources of the Democratic Republic of Congo. They\n\npoint out that the Bank of Uganda has acknowledged to IMF officials that the volume\n\nof Ugandan gold exports does not reflect Uganda's production levels, but rather that\n\nsome exports might be leaking over the borders from the Democratic Republic of\n\nCongo. According to the Bank of Uganda exports in 1996 6.4 million dollars, and in\n\n1995 $23 million, and in 1997 were $105 million.\n\n20 This Commission has heard evidence from Bank of Uganda officials that their data is\n\ncollected from forms provided by the Bank of Uganda which express an intention to\n\nexport only. This Commission therefore looked at the URA figures for gold exports\n\nand transit. It was not possible to separate the figures for exports originating from the\n\nCongo, although it was possible to separate the transit figures, but only for 1999 and\n\n2000.\n\nThis Commission thought to confirm figures from the UN COMTRADE database\n\nsaid to have been provided by the Uganda Bureau of Statistics, which revealed totally\n\ndifferent Ugandan export figures to those quoted by the UN panel, sourced from the\n\nMinistry of Energy and Mineral Development. When comparing those figures with\n\n30 the figures provided by Uganda's trading partners in terms of imports from Uganda an\n\neven more disparate picture emerged.\n\nAnnex 52\n\n109\n\nThere are problems in comparing figures, since some are in millions of shillings\n\nand others in thousands of dollars, and some others are in tones/tonnes. But a general\n\npicture can be obtained of a steady rise until 1997, with a dip in 1998 and an increase\n\nin 1999. In 2000 there is a small dip.\n\nThere is also one other thing which appears from the figures, and that is that the\n\nfigures from the COMTRADE database as provided by Uganda Bureau of Statistics\n\nas to Uganda's export figures, and the figures provided by Uganda's partners as\n\nimports differ wildly, and bear no relation at all to the figures provided by URA. It is\n\nquite clear therefore that there is massive smuggling of gold, and that the figures from\n\nany source cannot be relied upon. One wonders 10 how it can be suggested that Uganda\n\nmust have realised what was going on with respect to Gold, or how Uganda can be\n\nblamed for anything but an inefficient Customs Service and a porous border. It is not\n\nthe only country in Africa with these problems. The Commission will have\n\nrecommendations to make on this subject in due course.\n\nIt is also clear that there is no mine in Uganda which is fully operative; the same is\n\nalso true for the eastern Democratic Republic of Congo. The only source of gold\n\navailable is artisanal mining in open areas and abandoned mines (such as Kilo Moto).\n\nThe original Panel themselves indicate that a great deal of artisanal mining is going\n\non: they quote a figure of 2000 people mining in Kilo Moto mines per day, paying\n\n20 soldiers a total of 2 kg per day; no doubt the workers also take an appreciable amount\n\nof gold out of the gate. The Addendum to the original Panel Report increases that\n\nfigure to 10,000 people per day, generating £10,000 a day, 6 days a week, or\n\n$3,120,000 a year. Whether or not soldiers are involved, this is an appreciable amount\n\nof gold. Maj. Ssonko put the figure at 20,000 artisanal miners. Dr Mido gave\n\nevidence that Professor Wamba appointed a Commission of soldiers to charge\n\nartisanal miners at Kilo Moto about $15 worth of gold to go into the mine, and that\n\nthe proceeds from that were about two to three hundred grams a month, which raises\n\nthe possibility that RCD soldiers were mistaken for UPDF soldiers.\n\nAccording to the Uganda Government, the figures for production in Uganda do not\n\n30 reflect true production, because artisanal miners do not declare production, whereas\n\nexporters do. Nevertheless there is widespread artisanal production in Uganda, since\n\nthis would be the only source of gold production in Uganda, apart from the\n\nproduction from one mine in development.\n\nAnnex 52\n\n110\n\nWhat concerns this Commission is that the COMTRADE figures declared by\n\nUganda Bureau of Statistics are 16,35, and 43 million dollars for 1998,1999, and\n\n2000 respectively. These figures are far too high to be matched by likely artisanal\n\nproduction in the Democratic Republic of Congo even taken together with Uganda,\n\nand they are not matched by COMTRADE Partner Import figures which are 2,4,and\n\n14 million dollars only, (which are much more acceptable in relation to artisanal\n\nproduction.\n\nThe original Panel has relied upon figures provided by the Ugandan Bureau of\n\nStatistics. These figures do not match URA figures, or figures from Import partners\n\nwho, with respect, might be expected to be more reliable. 10 This Commission thinks\n\nthat perhaps if a little comparative research had been done, the original Panel would\n\nhave realised that the figures upon which they relied were, to say the least,\n\nquestionable, even though provided by Uganda, and that artisanal mining was the\n\nonly realistic source of gold production in this part of the world. The original Panel\n\nmight have been able to look with sympathy on the parlous state of the Uganda\n\nCustoms Service, and to make constructive recommendations in that regard. This\n\nCommission cannot support their conclusion in Paragraph 45 that :\n\n\"The Panel has strong indications after talking to numerous witnesses (key\n\nand others) that key officials in the Governments of Rwanda and Uganda\n\n20 were aware of the situation on the ground, including the looting of stocks\n\nfrom a number of factories. In some cases, the level of production of\n\nmineral resources would have alerted any government, such as those of\n\ngold for Uganda and coltan for Rwanda (from 99 tons in 1996 to 250 tons\n\nin 1997).\"\n\nIn passing this Commission would point out that in view of this Paragraph, and\n\nsimilar comments in the Addendum, this Commission will not be considering coltan\n\nunder this heading, although there undoubtedly was coltan from the Congo transiting\n\nthrough Uganda.\n\nWith relation to the acquisition of proper statistics, the problem appears to be the\n\n30 recording of production. This Commission visited a gold exporter, and saw one\n\ntransaction through from the visit of the client with unprocessed gold dust to the\n\nmelting of the gold, and payment for it. The client was a businessman in Arua, and he\n\nbrought one large packet which was split up into many smaller packets, each of which\n\nbelonged to an artisanal miner. Each one was painstakingly labelled with the name of\n\nAnnex 52\n\n111\n\nthe artisan, and they were all melted and assessed individually, and the payment\n\nfor each man calculated.\n\nIn such circumstances it is impractical to expect the artisans to notify gold production\n\nand source, even where the law requires it. It is only the exporter who is required to\n\nfill in statistical forms for export. Production and, more importantly, source figures\n\nought also to be required of whoever is the first person in Uganda to melt the gold\n\ndown, because the gold dust brought contains many impurities. In that regard, it was\n\nquite clear from the visit that URA has no hope of charging import duties, because the\n\nindividual packets were so small (smaller than a matchbox,though heavy, and quite\n\nvaluable) that they were easy to hide. For the same reason, it 10 might be impractical to\n\nrequire source figures, because gold smuggled through the border would be unlikely\n\nto be declared as sourced from outside Uganda, so that it was not dutiable. This\n\nCommission was told that the sources were all within Uganda: but looking at some of\n\nthe names involved, and bearing in mind the fact that the client was from Arua, this\n\nwas unlikely.\n\nThis Commission’s observation of the practice and procedure of, at least, artisanal\n\ngold production was that it would be very difficult, if not impossible to control gold\n\nimports from across the border, or to produce production statistics of any kind.\n\nTherefore, even if the Uganda Government ought to have noticed that production\n\n20 figures did not match export figures, there was very little that could be done about it.\n\nPractically speaking this Commission is unable to suggest an approach to solve the\n\nproblem, but would recommend further study of the problem.\n\nTable 1: Comparative figures for Gold from various sources\n\nGOLD\n\nINFORMATION FROM 1995 1996 1997 1998 1999 2000 2001\n\nURA EXPORTS Mshs 24,296 22,233 18,972 12,988 22,497\n\nURA TRANSIT from\n\nCongo Value Mshs 0 0 0 0 13 53\n\nBOU Mshs 2,539 6,409 8,059 1,860 3,836 3,184\n\nAnnex 52\n\n113\n\nfrom Uganda coincide with the years of the wars in the Democratic\n\nRepublic of the Congo, that is from 1997 onward.\"\n\nSo far as this Commission is concerned, the data from Ugandan Authorities is not\n\nsilent. It is quite clear from URA, BOU and Uganda Bureau of Statistics data to\n\nCOMTRADE that there is no record whatever of diamond production in Uganda.\n\nThere is a slight possibility of some artisanal surface diamond collection, but nothing\n\nhas been officially declared.\n\nOn the other side, the original Panel's information, which is said to have come from\n\nWTO, the World Federation of Diamond Bourses and the Diamond High Council,\n\nagrees quite closely with the COMTRADE Partner 10 Import figures on diamonds,\n\nexcept for the figures for 2000. This Commission has checked the original Panel's\n\ninformation with the Diamond High Council. It is revealed that, although much more\n\ncare is now exercised by the Belgian Authorities, at the time in question, the source of\n\ndiamonds was accepted upon the information of the importer, and Diamond High\n\nCouncil statistics (which the original Panel quoted as their source) relate to import to\n\nBelgium.\n\nTherefore, although the original Panel treat as suspicious the fact that, according to\n\nexternal statistics, Uganda was a diamond exporter, in fact that information was based\n\nupon the most unreliable figures.\n\n20 For example this Commission has traced a Police case in Uganda where one Khalil,\n\nwho is mentioned in the original Panel Report, admitted to obtaining diamonds in the\n\nDemocratic Republic of Congo in April 2000, flying them in to the Military Air Base,\n\nand ultimately sending a packet of them through associates to the International\n\nAirport, where the diamonds were exchanged (in the Gents toilet at the airport) for\n\n$550,000 in cash with a courier from Belgium who caught the next flight back. This\n\nwas hardly an honest exchange, particularly as there is no record of import, export or\n\ntransit through Uganda.The reason the matter was reported to the Police in Uganda\n\nwas because on the way back to Kampala, the car was stopped by armed men and the\n\nmoney stolen. The case is dealt with more particularly at Paragraph 21.3 below. The\n\n30 point is that the source of information in Belgium that the diamonds originally came\n\nfrom Uganda (which they did not) was the courier who had been involved in this\n\nshady deal. Had the original Panel known all this, perhaps they would not have been\n\nso hasty as to lay the blame at Uganda’s door: and to establish the source of the\n\ninformation upon which they relied was only a telephone call away, for that is how\n\nAnnex 52\n\n114\n\nthis Commission established this information. There is no doubt that diamonds\n\nare being smuggled, and falsely declared as sourced in Uganda. Bearing in mind that\n\na fortune can be carried in a pocket, it is difficult to see what Uganda as a State can\n\ndo about this. Partner Countries must be aware that Uganda is not a diamond\n\nproducing country, and yet are prepared to publish figures which deny that fact. The\n\noriginal Panel acknowledge the difficulty, and make recommendations in respect of\n\nit, which the Uganda Government, in its response, accepts.\n\nAlthough the original Panel refers to diamond exports from Uganda as commencing\n\n\"with the occupation of the eastern Democratic Republic of the Congo\" the figures\n\nthey produce clearly show considerable trading 10 in 1997, a year before the UPDF went\n\nin. This however would coincide with the start of the Laurent Kabila regime, and the\n\ncoming of relative peace and security to the eastern Democratic Republic of Congo,\n\nfollowed by security provided by UPDF even in troubled times, both of which\n\nenabled overseas trading. There is no surprise in this.\n\nThis Commission cannot therefore understand why the original Panel referred to\n\nthese figures as suspicious, or as supporting their conclusions from field trips.\n\nTable 2: Comparative figures for Diamonds from various sources\n\nDIAMONDS 1995 1996 1997 1998 1999 2000 2001\n\nURA 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\nBOU 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\nCOMTRADE UGANDAEXPORTS\n\n($000) 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\nCOMTRADE PARTNERSIMPORTS\n\n($000) 0 0 203 1,364 1,232 13 0\n\nPANEL ($000) 198 1,440 1,813 1,263\n\n21.3. The Diamond Link\n\n20 An opportunity presented itself to investigate the way in which diamonds were\n\nexported to Europe from the Democratic Republic of Congo, arising from a document\n\nAnnex 52\n\n115\n\nprovided by the reconstituted Panel, combined with information that this\n\nCommission had obtained about the smuggling of diamonds. The evidence and\n\nconclusions to be drawn from it are set out below.\n\n21.3.1. Victoria\n\nThroughout this Commission’s investigations the name of Victoria Diamonds or\n\nVictoria Group has surfaced on many occasions. The allegations in the original\n\nPanel Report were that Salim Saleh was a key shareholder in the group, which was\n\nsaid to have been involved in the making of counterfeit Congolese Francs\n\n(Paragraph 67). Later in paragraph 80 the original Panel described Victoria Group\n\nas being chaired by one Mr. Khalil with its headquarters 10 in Kampala. The original\n\nPanel said that Mr. Khalil deals directly with Salim Saleh's wife on Diamond\n\nissues, and had two collaborators in the Democratic Republic of Congo,\n\nMohammed Gassan and Mr. Talal. The original Panel were also told that Victoria\n\nGroup belongs jointly to the son of President Museveni and Salim Saleh and his\n\nwife, and was involved in trading diamonds, gold and coffee.\n\nIn Paragraph 88, when focusing on Salim Saleh and his wife, and accusing Salim\n\nSaleh of controlling Mbusa Nyamwisi and Ateenyi Tibasima through General\n\nKazini, who were protecting his commercial and business interests, the original\n\nPanel stated that Salim Saleh used the Victoria Group (and also Trinity) for the\n\n20 purchase and commercialisation of diamonds, timber, coffee and gold. The\n\noriginal Panel also reported that Salim Saleh's wife wanted to control the\n\nKisangani diamond markets on the recommendation of Mr. Khalil.\n\nIn the Addendum, Victoria comptoir in Kampala is mentioned in Paragraph 26 as\n\ncontinuing to sell gold mined from Malaka, and in Paragraph 97 as still exploiting\n\ndiamonds, gold coffee and timber, enabling the UPDF to “pull out their troops,\n\nwhile leaving behind structures that permit military officers and associates,\n\nincluding rebel leaders, to continue profiting”. In Paragraph 99 of the Addendum,\n\nRoger Lumbala is alleged to be a front for Victoria in respect of Bafwasende\n\ndiamonds.\n\n30 This Commission’s original researches were centred on a Ugandan Company of\n\nthat name because of the insistence of the original Panel that the Company was\n\nconnected with Kampala, and it took very little time to establish that there was no\n\nsuch company registered in Uganda, either local or foreign. All that was\n\nAnnex 52\n\n116\n\ndiscovered relevant to the allegations in the original Panel report was that at\n\none time Jovial Akandwanaho and Khalil were associated in a Lebanese\n\nrestaurant. They were directors in a company named Leban (U) Ltd which was\n\nregistered on 5th August 1999, and opened a Lebanese Restaurant in Kampala\n\nRoad in mid-1999. Later, Jovial said, she had sold her shares to Khalil.\n\nLater on in this Commission’s researches, a registration document of a company\n\ncalled Victoria Diamonds, registered in Goma in February 1999 was obtained. The\n\nDirectors of that Company were Ahmed Ibrahim (a Lebanese living in Goma) and\n\nKay Nduhuukire (a Ugandan living in Goma), who were mentioned nowhere else\n\nin the reports or evidence. This Commission therefore 10 thought that this Company\n\nwas not the Company referred to by the Original Panel, and reported as such.\n\nHowever, an event in Uganda came to the attention of this Commission. On 14th\n\nJuly 2000 a robbery took place on the Entebbe Road. The robbery was from a\n\nvehicle which was travelling from Entebbe Airport to Kampala: and a sum of\n\n$550,000 was reported to have been robbed from the occupants. The matter was\n\nreported to the Police, and it turned out that the loser was the same Khalil, who\n\nmade a statement to the Police.\n\n21.3.2. Khalil\n\nIn that statement Khalil identified himself as Khalil Nazem Ibrahim, of British\n\n20 Nationality. He said that he came to Uganda in January 1999 and that he had a\n\nLebanese restaurant on Kampala Road and did business of buying diamonds from\n\nthe Congo especially in Kisangani, Buta and Bunia. He did not name the company\n\nunder which he worked. He said that he used to send money for buying diamonds\n\nthrough one Hussein, and sometimes would go himself. He was receiving\n\ndiamonds through the Entebbe airport and also sending them to Europe especially\n\nto Belgium, and received the money in dollars for buying the diamonds from one\n\nNasser Murtada at Entebbe Airport. His base was in Bugolobi in Kampala. Due to\n\nproblems in the Congo he said that he stopped the business and in June 2000\n\nbrought a man named Ismail from Buta to start buying diamonds from the Congo.\n\n30 Khalil said that he then went back to Belgium to arrange finance after showing\n\nIsmail what to do. The procedure was that Nasser Murtada delivered money in\n\ndollars from Belgium at Entebbe airport and took the diamonds already purchased\n\nback to Belgium.\n\nAnnex 52\n\n119\n\nwith Military Transport. It is the name Khalil which connects these operations\n\nand the allegations in the original Panel Report. It seems to matter little whether\n\nthe Goma registered Company La Societé Victoria is the same Victoria Group or\n\nComptoir referred to in the original Panel Report or not. Khalil’s operations are\n\ntherefore referred to in this report simply as “Victoria”.\n\n21.3.4. General Kazini\n\nIn considering these operations, this Commission wonders how they could have\n\nbeen set up, obviously with UPDF assistance, so far at least as transport is\n\nconcerned. Those concerned in smuggling of diamonds from the Congo to the\n\nMilitary Air Base in many cases were admittedly 10 Lebanese, who were plainly and\n\nvisibly neither Ugandan nor Congolese, and again it is fair t"
