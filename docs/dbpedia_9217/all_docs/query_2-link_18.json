This is a strictly factual bulletin, prepared in the Finance and Investment Division from information in its files and the Department's library, supplemented by reports submitted specifically for this study by a considerable number of representatives of the Departments of State and Commerce in foreign countries. The present bulletin is one of several studies of silver made by the same author, the most recent one, The Silver Market, Trade Promotion Series No. 139, being principally a treatment of the economic aspects of the production and distribution of silver. The position of silver in the monetary systems of most countries is distinctly subordinate. Very few countries have silver as their standard of value, namely, China, Hong Kong, Macao, and Tibet. Even China now legally impedes the free movement of silver in certain forms into and out of the country. Several other countries rely on silver as their chief medium of exchange, but do not make it their standard of value, having adopted some form of the gold standard de jure or de facto. British India and Persia come under this category. Contrary to an impression held by some persons, neither these two countries, nor Australia, New Zealand, Mexico, or any other Latin American country employ silver as standard of value. In a number of countries, the study shows, considerable stocks of silver are held. While those of China and India are the most important and the best known, there are significant supplies of the metal in circulation or in the monetary reserves of Spain, Germany, France, the United States, and other countries. The bulletin contains detailed information on the legal provisions relating to silver, on the position of silver in the reserves of banks of issue, the circulation of silver coin, the attitude of foreign countries toward silver, and the possibility of increased use thereof without new legislation. The survey not only covers foreign countries, but includes a detailed description of the position of silver in the United States currency system. F R E D E R I C K M. F E I K E R , Director, Bureau of Foreign amd Domestic Commerce. APRIL 1933. VI THE MONETARY USE OF SILVER IN 1933 INTRODUCTION This study of the present use of silver throughout the world is presented by countries, the subject being examined under four heads: (1) Present legal provisions; (2) possibility of increased use of silver without new legislation; (3) attitude toward silver; (4) present employment of silver. Obviously, the position of silver in the currency systems of the world varies greatly, and it is not possible conveniently to tabulate the results of the present investigation. None the less, certain general observations become possible, and these are presented in the pages immediately following, together witli certain data believed pertinent. At the end there is a summary table. SILVER AS A STANDARD OF VALUE Silver is the standard of value in but few countries today. The full silver standard exists where silver is the standard of value; where in effect free coinage (i.e., coinage unlimited as to maximum amount) exists for the metal; where silver is unlimited legal tender; where there is ready interchangeability of the other currency of the country with silver, with no maximum limit as to quantity; and where there is full freedom to import and export silver. There is scarcely a silver-using country in the world, except Hong Kong, which fulfills all these requirements. China, last important stronghold of silver, has certain restrictions on silver imports and a duty on certain silver exports, but these technical impairments of the silver standard are not serious in that country's case. Other countries which may be classed as on the silver standard are Macao and Tibet. The currency in use in Ethiopia and Afghanistan is silver, but there are restrictions on the movements of the metal. Persia, British India, Ceylon, and Mexico are not on the silver standard, contrary to the belief in some quarters. The four countries just mentioned, also Ethiopia, and all other countries not on the silver standard are normally on some form of the gold standard, or have recently taken steps toward adoption of gold. SILVER AS A MEDIUM OF EXCHANGE There is evidently little inclination abroad to use silver in other than a subsidiary capacity. But this capacity is an important one. All countries require various low-denomination coins, a purpose for which silver is peculiarly suited. The metal is durable, attractive, and easily recognizable. Moreover, it is neither too rare nor too plentiful for the purpose, and it lends itself readily to the technical processes of minting. There are, however, certain limitations in the employment of silver as a subsidiary currency metal, as indicated below. l 2 M O N E T A R Y USE OF SILVER I N 19 3 3 SILVER AS LEGAL TENDER AND SUBSIDIARY MONEY Although silver is relegated to the position of a subsidiary metal in most countries of the world, there is no uniformity as to its status. In a few gold-standard countries where, ipso facto, free coinage of silver does not exist, silver currency is unlimited legal tender de jure. Such is the case in British India, Ceylon, Mexico, Netherland India, Netherland West Indies, Netherlands, Persia, Siam, and Spain; and smaller countries and colonies like Aden, British East Africa, British Somaliland, British West Africa, Goa, Hyderabad, Pondicherry, Travancore, Zanzibar, and the Spanish colonies. Silver currency is unlimited legal tender by specific provision of law or by custom in Hong Kong, where the nearest approach to the full silver standard exists, and in China (including Manchuria), Afghanistan, Ethiopia, Liberia, Macao, Mongolia, and Hedjaz. In the United States silver subsidiary coin is limited legal tender, but the so-called standard silver dollars and the silver certificates which represent them are full legal tender except where otherwise specified in the contract. Subsidiary silver coin, while limited in legal tender, is as a general rule accepted by Governments in tax and other payments without limit as to amount. In this way, if not otherwise, the demand for the different denominations of money in circulation can be adjusted. SILVER CERTIFICATES In addition to the United States, countries employing currency certificates redeemable only in silver include British India, British Somaliland, Ceylon, China (including Manchuria), Colombia, Costa Rica, Ethiopia, Goa, Hong Kong, Hyderabad, Kwantung Leased Territory, Macao, Morocco, Netherlands, Panama,1 Philippine Islands,1 Pondicherry, Travancore, and Zanzibar. In Spain and the Spanish colonies the notes of the Bank of Spain may be classed as silver certificates, not because they are not redeemable in gold, but because, in practice, the Bank of Spain redeems them in silver coin, which is its prerogative. With reference to the above lists, distinction should be made between those countries where silver is full legal tender and those, like the Netherlands, where the certificates are redeemable in the limitedlegal-tender currency only. Again, a separate list might be made of those countries whose notes are redeemable in silver coin (e.g., the rupee) itself ultimately, in normal times, redeemable in gold. The silver certificates of the United States fall into this category not by specific provision of law, but by the general tenor of the goldstandard act of 1900. ATTRIBUTES OF A SUBSIDIARY COINAGE; FIDUCIARY COIN A coinage is subsidiary when the minting thereof is legally limited as to amount; when its value as currency is—by law—greater than its value as metal; when it is limited as to legal tender; when it is convertible, in reasonable quantities, into the standard money 1 American silver certificates are used in such Caribbean countries as the Virgin Islands, Cuba, Panama and the Canal Zone, British Honduras, etc. They also circulate in the Philippine Islands, where silver certificates are locally issued as well. 3 M O N E T A R Y USE OF SILVER I N 19 3 3 of the country; and when its denominations are smaller than the monetary unit of the country. All subsidiary money is fiduciary, because its value as currency rests on the public's faith in the Government's ability to maintain such value. Coin which has all the abovelisted attributes, except that of being smaller in denomination than the unit, is not subsidiary, but is fiduciary. It is desirable that fiduciary coins have a value as bullion sufficiently low to avoid their being melted down, upon a forseeable rise in the price of their principal metal, for example, silver. If they should be withdrawn from circulation and melted, great public inconvenience might result. This, indeed, has happened in our own history, as witness the scarcity of silver coin during the Civil War. Moreover, during the period of an abnormally high price of silver in 1919-20 the same thing threatened to occur again, when the price of silver at one time rose slightly above the bullion value of our subsidiary silver coinage. To avoid a recurrence of this risk Neil Crothers, in his book, Fractional Money, states (p. 289) : \" The proper remedy is to reduce the proportion of pure silver in the coins, with a proportionate increase in the copper. The size, design, and wording need not be changed. This plan involves no delays whatever. The only significant change in the coins is an alteration in color. In 1920 England adopted this method, delaying so long after the crisis had arrived that a law was hastily passed reducing the fineness of the silver coins from 92% percent to 50 percent.\" While it is desirable to mint subsidiary coin with a seigniorage sufficiently large to avoid such danger, the content of subsidiary coin should be sufficiently valuable, as bullion, to avoid temptation to counterfeiters. Against the latter risk there are, of course, certain other protective devices. LIMITS WITHIN WHICH GOLD-STANDARD COUNTRIES FREELY EMPLOY SILVER MAY Since in every country there is normally a certain minimum demand for currency as a medium of exchange, it is possible within that limit to vary the character of the money, whether metal or paper, with the utmost freedom. Such stock of money may consist in whole or part of commodity money, or it may be entirely fiduciary. Within this limit nations may safely substitute copper for nickel, nickel for silver, or silver for gold-secured paper without affecting the price level. Recently, as this study shows, this principle has been resorted to in Germany, France, Colombia, Cuba, Mexico, Poland, and Spain, as a device to improve the gold ratio. The same principle made safe the substitution in many countries of base metal coins or small notes for silver during the World War scarcity of the metal. Countries which did this were, for example, the Netherlands, Japan, Straits Settlements, France, Belgium, and Greece. From this it does not follow that there is no other limit to the amount of silver coin which may be issued. Experience of the United States proves that when coins become too cumbersome a more convenient medium of exchange is demanded. Also, in Germany, where large quantities of 5-mark silver pieces were lately put in circulation, there has arisen much complaint of the inconvenience occasioned by the forced acceptance of the heavy coins, and steps are now being 4 M O N E T A R Y USE OF SILVER I N 19 3 3 taken to substitute smaller coins. It appears that in modern countries accustomed to the use of banknotes and checks, there is a practical limit to the amount of metal which may be put into circulation. WHERE SILVER IS A PREFERRED MEDIUM OF EXCHANGE In certain less-advanced countries, on the other hand, a large part of the population shows a distinct preference for silver rather than paper currency. Particularly is this the case in the backward countries of Africa and Asia, and occasionally in tropical countries, where paper money is in danger of destruction by insects. Countries in these categories are those of the Arabian peninsula, Afghanistan, Algeria, Anglo-Egyptian Sudan, British (and other) India, Ceylon, China (with some local exceptions), Eritrea, Iraq, Mexico, Netherland India, Persia, and Syria. WHERE SILVER COIN IS NOT IN CIRCULATION In several countries there are no silver coins in active circulation. Among these are Albania, Argentina, Belgian Congo, Belgium, Denmark, Finland, Paraguay, and Turkey. For a number of years prior to the latter part of March 1933 no silver had circulated in France, and practically none in any French colony except French Indo-China and Pondicherry. The recent issuance of silver by the French Government will undoubtedly be followed by the circulation of the new coins in the colonies where the coinage system of France applies. (See French Colonies.) Turkey, as mentioned elsewhere, is expected soon to issue silver coins. STATUTORY LIMITS ON SUBSIDIARY SILVER COINAGE Subsidiary silver coinage in various countries is limited either according to the discretion of the treasury or a currency board, or by specific restriction in the currency law. In the United States, United Kingdom, and most other countries silver is minted only as demand for such coin arises; the law places no limit on the amount of subsidiary currency. On the other hand, various countries specifically limit by law the amount of subsidiary coin. The limit may be so much per capita, or it may be a specific figure. In some cases the law specifies how much coin of each metal may be issued. In other cases the proportion of silver coin to total subsidiary coin is subject to variation at the discretion of the mint or treasury authorities. Germany, for example, limited the amount of silver coin to 30 reichsmarks per capita; Latvia, to 30 lats per capita; and Lithuania, to 6 litas per capita; while Poland limited the total of silver, nickel and copper coins to 320,000,000 zlote, of which 140,000,000 zlote were to be of silver. A third group of countries issues silver coin irregularly, in amounts and denominations specified by separate enactment. Thus, France in 1928 passed a law authorizing the issuance within a certain time of 3,000,000,000 francs in silver 10- and 20-franc coins, details of the law being subsequently amended. In Italy the legal authorization for silver coinage specifies the amount of each denomination which may be put into circulation. 5 MONETARY USE OF SILVER I N 19 3 3 In some countries, particularly colonies, new issues of silver coin cannot be made without authorization from abroad. Greece, for example, requires the approval of the International Financial Commission, which was established before the World War to protect foreign loans made to Greece. Nearly all countries have, at one time or another, passed special legislation for the issuance of commemorative coins. Such issues may fall within the limits defined in the law, or they may be authorized in addition to the coinage previously provided. MORE SILVER LEGALLY ISSUABLE IN MANY COUNTRIES While a considerable number of countries have limited by law the amount of silver currency, not all such countries have in circulation all the silver legally issuable. Thus, if necessary, a certain additional amount of silver could be put into circulation there. In other countries, where there is no legal limit, more silver may be issued without formality. The general practice, however, is to issue silver coin only as public demand for subsidiary money requires. Countries where, it is believed, the use of silver coin may be increased without new legislation include the following. It should be borne in mind that the law is not always definite on this point and that it is frequently a matter of opinion whether new legislation would be necessary. In a few cases exact information is not on hand. Afghanistan Albania Anglo-Egyptian Sudan Argentina (?)

The widespread lowering of the fineness of coins after the World War and the large sales of demonetized silver which followed are frequently alluded to. The more important changes in this respect were designed to prevent melting of the coins by the public. Again, the fineness of the silver coins may be altered in order to make the silver currency more popular. It seems very likely that such a change may soon be made in German coinage, where in March a plan was reported under consideration to alter the 5-mark coin and withdraw the 1-mark silver piece. Under the proposal all the exist2 Including colonies and territories where currency of mother country circulates. 6 M O N E T A R Y USE OF SILVER IN 1 9 3 3 ing 5-mark silver pieces would be withdrawn from circulation and, in their place, there would be issued 5-mark coins smaller in size but with the same silver content. From 1919 to 1932, inclusive, it is estimated no less than 541,000,000 fine ounces of silver obtained from demonetized coin have been sold on the world market. The principal single source of this silver since 1927 has been British India. Important amounts have been sold by the United Kingdom, French Indo-China, France, Siam, Belgium, the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics, Mexico, and Egypt. For convenience the following table, brought down to date, is republished from Trade Promotion Series No. 139, The Silver Market.

In contrast with the above, Czechoslovakia and Turkey are likely to use silver for coinage in the near future, while a well-known Buenos Aires economist has recommended that Argentina employ some silver in its currency system. Coinage programs involving silver are now under way for China, Czechoslovakia, France, Iraq, New Zealand, Persia, Poland, Portugal, and Yugoslavia. Silver coinage programs for Germany, French Indo-China, Panama, Colombia, Cuba, and Danzig were recently completed. NET CONSUMPTION IN COINAGE, 1900 TO 1931, BY SELECTED COUNTRIES In the following review of the consumption of silver in coinage China is not included because of the inadequacy of statistical data and because coinage is not the sole index of monetary consumption in a country where silver in a variety of forms passes as currency, while coins circulate on the basis of their value as bullion. During the 30-year period from 1900 to 1929 the largest net consumption of silver in coinage was that of British India (863,400,000 fine ounces), followed by the United States (236,000,000 ounces). These two countries absorbed over half the total for the 15 selected countries tabulated below. Russia and Mexico followed (with approximately 150,000,000 fine ounces each), in turn followed by Germany, Japan, French Indo-China, and Austria and Hungary considered as a unit. The consumption of silver for coinage purposes by the 15 countries was subject to considerable variation from year to year. In the United States, for example, net coinage of silver was heaviest in 1900-1904, and during the years of Pittman Act purchases, from 1920 to 1926. British India's coinage demand, also, was irregular, varying with economic conditions in that country. Apart from the unusually heavy demand (497,000,000 ounces) during the war and post-war period 1916-20, the heaviest net coinage consumption in India took place in the years 1903-7, when 233,000,000 fine ounces were coined by the mints. Since 1922 there has been a net annual return of silver from circulation. Russia's coinage between 1900 and 1929 was very irregular. The heaviest consumption by the mint occurred in 1904, 1915-16, and 1924r-25. Mexico coined substantial amounts in 1900-1901, 1903, and 1920-24. Germany's net consumption was largest in the years 1924-26 and Japan's in 1917, when the large amount of 67,200,000 fine ounces (net) was consumed. During the 5-year period 1927-31 the average annual net consumption by the selected countries was in some cases larger than the annual average for the period 1900-1929. In others, however, a \" net consumption \" had been displaced by a \" net withdrawal from circulation as the accompanying table shows. Thus, whereas British India's net consumption averaged almost 29,000,000 fine ounces per annum in the 30-year period, analysis of the 5-year period ended 1931 shows an average return from circulation of 24,000,000 ounces 8 M O N E T A R Y USE OF SILVER IN 19 3 3 8 per annum, with the return in the depression year 1931 reaching almost 40,000,000 ounces. In the United States annual net consumption averaged close to 8,000,000 ounces from 1900 to 1929; from 1927 to 1931 the average was only 1,640,000 ounces: and during both 1930 and 1931 there were net withdrawals from circulation totaling 4,600,000 ounces. The Soviet's consumption showed a small decline in the 5-year period 1927-31, while latterly—as stated elsewhere—the Government has been withdrawing silver coin for exportation. An unofficial estimate puts sales of demonetized silver by the Union, of Soviet Socialist Republics in 1932 at 11,600,000 fine ounces. Mexico's statistics show an average net withdrawal from circulation, amounting to 560,000 ounces in 1927-31. This average was slightly smaller than the net withdrawal in the year 1931 alone. Mexico's coinage activity of 1932 is, of course, not included in these figures. Germany's large net consumption for coinage during 1931 (18,000,000 ounces) made the 5-year average 8,340,000 ounces, compared with one of 4,530,000 ounces during the 30 years ended 1929. Japan showed average net withdrawals of 180,000 fine ounces during the more recent period; the United Kingdom, 5,180,000 ounces; France, 4,460,000 ounces; and Italy, 1,120,000 ounces. It is noteworthy that in 1931 the United Kingdom showed a net consumption of 5,300,000 ounces and France 7,800,000 ounces in contrast to withdrawals from circulation in the years immediately preceding. The most marked increase was in the case of Germany. In all other cases studied, 1931 does not compare favorably with 1927-31. A comparison of the 1927-31 figures with those for 1900-1929 shows increases in the annual average net consumption in the cases of only three countries, Germany, Persia, and the Netherlands. A similar comparison of 1900-1929 with the year 1931 shows increased net consumption in only Germany, United Kingdom, and France.

Also shown are the totals for the world, as reported to the mint. As the figures show, the country which consumed the largest amount of silver in coinage during the period 1927-31 was Germany, which took 41,700,000 ounces in 1930. The other principal net consumers of silver for coinage purposes, in the order of amount consumed were Union of Soviet Socialist Republics, Persia, Austria, Fren,ch Indo-China, Netherlands, and Poland. Those countries in which the most silver returned from circulation in the period 1927 to 1931 were British India, United Kingdom, France, Netherland India, Italy, and Mexico.

SILVER IN RESERVES OF CENTRAL BANKS Analysis of the percentage of silver in total metallic holdings in 18 foreign banks of issue, by 5-year periods, shows a decline of approximately 17 percent between 1900-1904 and 1905-9; 26 percent during the next 5 years; and 42 percent during the World-War quinquennium. The following is based on statistics compiled by Y. S. Leong, of Washington, D.C.

Detailed 5-year averages by countries, as compiled by Mr. Leong, were published in Senate Document No. 8, 73d Cong., 1st sess. During the 30 years covered by the above figures, details of which were published in an appendix to Trade Promotion Series No. 139, The Silver Market, the proportion of silver in total metallic holdings declined in all but 4 of the 18 countries. Those which showed a net increase were Denmark, Japan, Russia, and Switzerland, whose actual silver holdings were and still are relatively small. In all countries where silver coin actively circulates, the central banks have on hand some silver as till money. Usually, however, in gold standard countries the law governing the central banks' reserves makes no provision for silver, but there are certain exceptions. Central banks at present specifically authorized by law to include silver in their minimum metallic reserves against notes or demand liabilities in general include those of— Albania Bolivia China Colombia Guatemala Hungary Japan Manchuria Netherland India Netherlands Peru Poland Spain Union of South Africa Union of Soviet Socialist Republics United Kingdom In addition to the foregoing list, which applies to central banks, silver is included in the monetary reserves of the treasuries or banks of British India, Ceylon, Ethiopia, Goa, Hong Kong, Mexico, New Zealand, Pondicherry, Siam, Straits Settlements, and the United States.

COINAGE IN COLONIES, MANDATED AREAS, AND SPHERES OF INFLUENCE In connection with the detailed information which follows, it should be borne in mind that changes affecting the coinage of the United Kingdom will affect those countries using British coins. (See British Empire.) Similarly, the recent issuance of silver coins in France, in accordance with the 1928 law, implies the circulation of silver in all French colonies using the French coinage system— although they did not have silver in circulation when this investigation was made. (See French colonies.) Changes in the United States coins are reflected in the circulation not only of those territories and possessions under our control,6 but also of foreign countries like Cuba, Panama, British Honduras, and Honduras, where American money customarily circulates along with the local currency. A similar statement may be made concerning the coinage of Portugal, which circulates in Angola, the Azores, Goa, Madeira, Mozambique, and Portuguese Guinea ; that of Italy, which circulates in Eritrea, Italian Somaliland, Libya, San Marino, and Vatican City; that of Japan which circulates in Chosen, Taiwan, Kwantung Leased Territory, the South Manchuria Railway Zone, and the mandated islands of the Pacific; and that of the Netherlands, Belgium, Spain, Denmark, Australia, New Zealand, etc., in the colonies or mandated areas pertaining to them. CONVERSION EQUIVALENTS The troy pound is divided into 12 ounces, each of 20 pennyweights (dwts.). One pennyweight equals 24 grains. Thus: 1 dwt. = 24 grains. 20 dwts.= 480 grains=1 ounce (troy). 240 dwts. =5,760 grains= 12 ounces ( t r o y ) = l pound (troy). The following equivalents will be found useful in making conversions from troy to avoirdupois: 1 gram =15.432 grains =0.03215 ounce troy=0.03527 ounce avoirdupois. 1 grain =0.0648 gram. 1 ounce troy =31.104 grams. 1 ounce avoirdupois =28.35 grams. 1 kilogram —2 pounds 8 ounces 3 pennyweights troy=15,432 grains. 1 pound avoirdupois =14.5833 ounces troy. 6 See footnote 19 on p. 126. SURVEY BY COUNTRIES ADEN AND PROTECTORATE The monetary unit is the British Indian rupee, divided into 16 annas. The rupee has a par value of approximately $0,365. In Aden the rupee is unlimited legal tender. Apart from British Indian currency, in the territory surrounding Aden, the Maria Theresa dollar is still widely used, both this coin and the rupee being legal tender in all transactions. AFGHANISTAN The official unit of currency in Afghanistan is the silver afghani, commonly known as the Afghan rupee. The afghani is divided into 100 pul. The Afghan rupee has no fixed par value in terms of gold. Present legal provisions-—The official decree establishing the currency in Afghanistan was issued in 1925. According to American Consul Renwick S. McNiece, of Karachi, September 11, 1930, \" it has been impossible to obtain a copy of the law relating to legal tender in Afghanistan. An informant, who is in a position to know, states that the Afghan Government will accept for taxes and customs duties only its own coins, i.e., amani (gold), afghani (silver), and kabuli (silver). The latter is a coin of old standing, 11 kabuli being equivalent to 10 afghani. Other currency circulates freely in the country, and there are always native exchange dealers (sarafan) who have shops in the compound of the customs house (gumruk) at Kabul who will provide legal tender in exchange for other forms of money * * *. \" There are no laws prohibiting the importation of silver or gold or foreign currency of any kind. Exportation of gold and silver in all forms is strictly prohibited and, if detected, results in the confiscation of the intended export.\" The Afghan currency system includes, in addition to the coins mentioned, silver half afghanis (called nim afghani) and 20-pul silver pieces. Both the gold amani and the silver afghani are 0.900 fine. The nim afghani is 0.500 fine. The silver content of the afghani is believed to be about 140.625 grains (troy). Possibility of increased me of silver without new legislation.— More silver currency could be issued with little formality. Attitude toward silver.—Consul McNiece reported in 1930 that \" when the afghani was first issued it was the intention gradually to do away with the kabuli. This is still the intention of the Government, but apparently no date has yet been set for withdrawing the kabuli rupee from circulation.\" Present employment of silver.—Foreign coins and notes circulate freely. Old silver coins, known as gajrees, circulate freely in Afghanistan, as in Persia. Coins circulate on the basis of their value as 15 16 M O N E T A R Y USE OF SILVER I N 19 3 3 bullion. While the foreign coins mentioned above have wide use, it is not possible to indicate the extent of their circulation in a country where there are no statistics of monetary stocks. Silver kabuli currency circulates in denominations of 5 kabuli, 2% kabuli, 1 kabuli, y2 kabuli (called nim kabuli), and 20-paisa (also called 1 thanga or 1 abbasi). There are 60 paisa in 1 kabuli. ALBANIA The monetary unit is the Albanian franc, divided into 5 leks. The franc has a par value of approximately $0.1930. Present legal provisions.—The currency law of July 1925 provides for silver coins in denominations of 1, 2, and 5 francs, but these coins are not now in circulation, although silver coins were minted for Albania by the Italian mint in 1926. Silver coins (crowns) issued by nearby countries before the World War are still to be found in Albania, where they circulate at their bullion value, more or less. Details as specified in the 1925 law are shown in the following table: 7 Denomination 5 francs 2francs 1 franc l _ . H franc 1 1 _. . Fineness Gross weight in gram? 0.900 .835 .835 .835 25.0 10.0 5.0 2.5 Legal tender limit Francs 50 50 50 50 It is believed this coin was not struck in 1926. Albania's note-issue reserve, which must be at least 33*73 percent, may include silver.8 The balance sheet of the National Bank of Albania for the last report date in November 1932 showed gold amounting to 5,508,000 francs, foreign exchange totaling 29,891,000 francs, and a note circulation of 12,272,000 francs. No silver was reported. A law of January 1922 prohibited the exportation of silver coin or bullion. Possibility of increased use of silver without new legislation.— The National .Bank of Albania is entrusted with management of the currency, and could issue silver without new legislation. Attitude toward silver.—There has been no intimation of legislation which would affect the monetary use of silver in Albania. Present employment of silver.—Silver coin in circulation at the end of 1931 totaled 8,579' francs and, in the central bank, 250,187 francs. ALGERIA The monetary unit is the Algerian franc, divided into 100 centimes. The franc has a par value of approximately $0.0392. Present legal provisions.—The Bank of Algeria is the medium through which the paper and metal currency is issued, according 7 Monetary Units and Coinage Systems of the Principal Countries of the World, 1929, p. 20. 8 Federal Reserve Bulletin, July 1932, p. 437. M O N E T A R Y USE OF SILVER IN 17 19 3 3 to a 1930 report, which stated that the coinage was regarded as temporary, being inscribed \" Chambers de Commerce de France The law makes silver coins legal tender to 250 francs, but none are now in circulation. There is no general restriction on the movement of silver, other than the statutory customs duty.9 Attitude toward silver.—When France issues silver coins, they will probably circulate in Algeria. It has been reported that the natives would incline to hoard them. Present employment of silver.—No silver is now in circulation in Algeria. Prohibited from circulation are (since 1894) Italian fractional silver coins; (since 1903) silver coins not current in the country of issue; and (since 1909) Greek silver coins. At the end of 1931 the Bank of Algeria held silver totaling 53,000,000 francs. ANGLO-EGYPTIAN SUDAN The monetary unit is the Egyptian pound, divided into 100 piasters. The Egyptian pound at par equals approximately $4.9431. The currency is at present pegged to the pound sterling at the ratio of approximately £E97% equals £100 sterling. Present legal provisions.—Except that British and Australian shillings and florins of the King George V issue are accepted at 5 piasters and 10 piasters, respectively, the general provisions of the existing currency laws in the Sudan are in the main similar to those in force in Egypt. The legal tender of silver is limited to 200 piasters. A proclamation published on June 15, 1923, removed the embargoes on gold and silver exports. Possibility of increased use of silver without new legislation.— The present use of silver for monetary purposes cannot be extended in the Sudan without legislation. Attitude toward silver.—No legislation in this connection is at present contemplated. Present employment of silver.—For hoarding purposes silver is preferred to bank notes, owing to the clanger of the latter being destroyed by white ants or fire. However, it is thought that there is not much hoarded silver in the country at the present time. At the end of 1931 silver in the Sudan was estimated as follows: In Government treasuries, £E845,393; in the banks, £E7,745; and in circulation, £E921,215. ANGOLA The monetary unit is the angolar, divided into 20 macutas. angolar has a par value of approximately $ 0 . 0 4 4 2 . The The currency is issued by the Junta da Moeda da Angola (Council of the Coinage of Angola). Coins and notes of 1 angolar and higher denominations are unlimited legal tender; smaller currency is legal tender to 20 times its face value. The exportation of Angola coins is prohibited. 9 In 1 9 3 0 this was reported by Consul Oscar S. Heizer as equivalent to $ 0 . 1 0 United States currency per 2 2 0 pounds gross weight for silver bullion and $0.0665 per 220 pounds for coin. 18 M O N E T A R Y USE OF SILVER I N 19 3 3 ARGENTINA The monetary unit is the gold peso, divided into 100 centavos. At par 1 gold peso equals approximately $0.9647. The Argentine gold peso and paper peso are linked at this ratio: 1 gold peso equals 2.27 paper pesos, thus giving the paper peso a par value of approximately $0.4244. The subsidiary coins represent fractions of the paper peso, which, like the gold peso, consists of 100 centavos. Present legal provisions.—There are no general provisions in Argentine law for the use of silver as currency, and no silver is in circulation. (The currency in actual circulation consists of paperpeso bills and nickel coins of 20, 10, and 5 centavos. Cooper 2-centavo coins are in limited circulation, being used chiefly for making change at the post and telegraph offices.) Possibility of increased use of silver without new legislation.—It is believed that silver coins could be issued by the authorities without amendment of the existing laws by executive decree. Attitude toward silver.—Argentina does not produce over 15,000 ounces of silver per annum, and there is, therefore, little likelihood that a sentiment in favor of silver per se will develop. The public has shown no particular objection to the use of silver coins, but there is certainly no public demand for them. That silver may be issued is indicated by Dr. Alejandro E. Bunge, a leading Argentine economist, in a statement of December 31, 1932, entitled \" Second Memorandum on the Exchange Problem in Argentina.\" Dr. Bunge states: \" It seems that unanimous approval has been won for a scheme to coin small silver currency of 50 centavos, and 1- and 2-peso values, up to a proportion between 15 and 20 percent (as in the United States and England) of the circulation. This would allow the retirement of 200,000,000 pesos in notes (all the \" p e s o \" issue and a portion of other denominations). The drop in the price of silver at this time is extraordinary to the extent that it reaches only one fifth of the nominal value represented by the coin itself (said coins have reached value at certain times higher than their nominal value). The high cost of reprinting the notes would be reduced, particularly on the 1-peso notes, the printing of which is considered to be extremely high. The gold guaranty remaining after paying the cost of the silver and the coining would reinforce the gold guaranty on the remaining balance of paper currency. Since this remainder would amount to some 30,000,000 pesos gold, the present ratio of 44 percent of the gold guaranty would be increased to 51 percent.\" Sir Otto Niemeyer's report on the rehabilitation of Argentine finances, made public in April 1933, recommended that coin be substituted for paper currency of denominations smaller than 5 pesos. AUSTRALIA The monetary unit is the Australian pound, divided into 20 shillings of 12 pence each. The pound has a par value of approximately $4.8666. At present it is on the sterling exchange basis at the ratio of approximately £125 Australian to £100 sterling. Present legal provisions.—Silver currency is regulated by the Coinage Act (No. 6) of 1909, an act relating to currency, coinage, and M O N E T A R Y USE OF SILVER IN\" 19 3 3 19 legal tender. The act, insofar as it affects silver money, makes the following provisions: Issuance of silver coins is controlled by the treasury. Silver coins are legal tender for a payment of no more than 40 shillings. The Governor General may determine the dimensions, denominations, and least current weight of Australian coins: may direct that any coins, other than silver or bronze, shall be current and be a legal tender for the payment of any amount not exceeding the amount specified in the proclamation and not exceeding 5 shillings; and may revoke or alter any proclamation previously made. The act is accompanied by a schedule of standard and least current weights of Australian coins, as also details of fineness and remedy allowance. It fixes the fineness of the silver coinage at 0.925. Following are the approximate gross weights of the Australian coins in grams: Florin, 11.3104; shilling, 5.6552; sixpence, 2.8275; threepence, 1.4138. Possibility of increased use of silver without new legislation.— From the text of the law there appears to be no restriction on the amount of silver coins which may be put into circulation. Attitude toward silver.—No legislation affecting the monetary use of silver has been proposed and, so far as is known, none is contemplated. Australia's coinage system being patterned after Great Britain's, it does not seem likely that Australia would alter the monetary use of silver unless to make it conform with that in Great Britain. It will be recalled that, unlike Australia's silver coinage, Great Britain's is now only 0.500 fine. Present employment of silver.—Coinage of Australian silver currency in the year ended June 30, 1928, amounted to £305,000. In the four succeeding years the figures were: £128,000, £61,000, £237,000, and £289,000. These figures are gross, making no allowance for withdrawals from circulation of British silver coins or for replacement of worn Australian coins. The Australian mints commenced to coin silver in 1910, the total amount issued by the treasury from the beginning of operations to June 30, 1932, being £7,427,000. Worn Australian coins withdrawn from circulation from 1910 to December 31, 1930, amounted to £3,126,000, while British silver withdrawn to June 30,1932, totaled £1,816,000. Since 1930, when the rate for remittances on London went to a substantial premium, appreciable amounts of British silver have been exported privately so that practically no British silver is now in circulation. A press report from Wellington on April 19 stated that New Zealand banks had received notice from London that the Bank of England would no longer accept at par British silver coins shipped from New Zealand or Australia. At the end of 1929 the stock of silver coin and bullion held by banks in Australia totaled £2,402,527. AUSTRIA The monetary unit is the schilling, consisting of 100 groschen. One shilling at par equals approximately $0.1407. Present legal provisions.—The main provision relating to the monetary use of silver in Austria is contained in article 86 of the statutes of the Austrian National Bank. That article reads in part as follows: The entire note circulation, including call liabilities, insofar as it exceeds the amount of Government loans, A, B, and C, must be fully covered by the following assets. M O N E T A R Y USE OF SILVER I N 20 19 3 3 The first four categories of assets do not refer to metal cover. The fifth category is the following: By coins of the Republic of Austria in possession of the Austrian National Bank; silver coins may, at the discretion of the bank, also be accounted with their silver value [that is, at their market value as bullion] as a part of the bank's Barschatz [holdings of precious metals and foreign! exchange]. The minting of silver coins is controlled by the Austrian Treasury, but their issuance, as appears below, depends on the central bank. The law of December 20, 1924, authorized the issuance of 4 silver coins, 1 for export only. The 3 coins issued for use in Austria are the 2-, 1-, and ^-schilling pieces, 0.640 fine and having gross weights of 12, 6, and 3 grams, respectively. The fourth coin authorized is the Maria Theresa dollar, weighing 28.0668 grams, 0.833^ fine. The first 3 coins are legal tender in payments not exceeding 50 schillings. Possibility of increased use of silver ivitkout new legislation.—The Austrian National Bank has not taken advantage of the provision which places no limit on the use of silver in the currency reserves. Attitude toward silver.—No legislation which would affect the monetary use of silver is contemplated. Silver coins can be put into circulation only by the Austrian National Bank, which has indicated no intention to put any considerable amount of silver into circulation in the near future. This disinterest in silver is confirmed by Austrian financial experts writing in Viennese newspapers. Present employment of silver.—The total circulation of silver coins in Austria on October 31, 1932, amounted to 83,161,590 schillings, of which 2,806,773 schillings were in possession of the National Bank. The National Bank holds no silver bullion and only a very small amount of Maria Theresa silver trade dollars, which are used in various parts of Africa and Near Eastern Asia. The circulation of silver mentioned above compares with the Austrian National Bank's note circulation of 903,000,000 schillings. AZORES The monetary unit is the escudo, divided into 100 centimos. The par value of the escudo is approximately $0.0442. (See Portugal.) BAHAMAS The monetary unit is the pound, divided into 20 shillings of 12 pence each. The pound has a par value of approximately $4.8666. Present legal provisions.—Under the British Currency Act of November 29, 1883, the British monetary system applies to the Bahamas. Possibility of increased use of silver ivithout new legislation.— The volume of silver in circulation depends simply on the demands of business. Attitude toward silver.—No change in the present use of silver is likely. Present employment of silver.—United States silver coins and other forms of United States currency circulate generally, although not legal tender. M O N E T A R Y USE OF SILVER IN\" 1 9 3 3 21 Silver coins struck in London for the Bahamas include 1-, 2-, and 2y2-shilling pieces. BARBADOS The monetary unit is the pound, divided into 20 shillings of 12 pence each. The pound has a par value of approximately $4.8666.10 Present legal provisions.—British currency has always been used in Barbados. Exportation of British silver, except by the Colonial Treasurer, is prohibited under the Trade Act of 1910. Possibility of increased use of silver without new legislation.— The volume of silver in circulation depends simply on the demands of business. Attitude toward silver.—No change in the present use of silver is likely. Present employment of silver.—About £150,000 in British silver was estimated to be in circulation in 1930, according to a consular report. Replies to questionnaires sent out by the United States Bureau of the Mint indicated that silver in Barbados at the end of 1930 totaled (face value) $507,000 United States currency. BELGIAN CONGO The monetary unit is the Congo franc, divided into 100 centimes. The franc has a par value of approximately $0.0278. Present legal provisions.—No provision for silver is made in the currency law. Attitude toward silver.—No intention to issue silver coinage has been reported. Present employment of silver.—No silver circulates in the Belgian Congo. BELGIUM The monetary unit is the Belgian franc, divided into 100 centimes. The franc, being one fifth of a belga, has a par value of approximately $0.0278. Present legal provisions.—The monetary law makes no specific provision for silver, and no coins of that metal are in circulation. The subsidiary coinage of Belgium is governed by the royal decree of October 26, 1926, \"Arrete Royal Relatif a PEmission, par l'Etat, de Monnaies Divisionnaires Destinees a Remplacer les Petites Coupures Mises en circulation par la Banque National de Belgique.\" This decree was published in the Moniteur Beige of October 28, 1926. There is nothing in the decree which prevents the issuance of silver coins, the matter being left to the decision of the Ministry of Finance. Possibility of increased use of silver without new legislation.— Despite the foregoing, there is no likelihood that silver coins will be minted in the near future. Attitude toward silver.—The present nickel, copper, and nickelcopper coins in circulation appear to be satisfactory, and to substitute silver would be considered by many wasteful. It is worth noting, however, that certain individuals in Belgium have been advocating 10 A unit of account, the British West Indies dollar, equivalent to 4s. 2d. sterling is in use, but it is not coined. M O N E T A R Y USE OF SILVER I N 22 19 3 3 the replacement of the 50-franc banknotes with silver coins. At present this project has not developed sufficient strength to indicate its adoption. On November 15, 1932, there were 572,000,000 francs in 50-franc notes in circulation. Present employment of silver.—By a decree of July 30, 1932, published in the Moniteur Beige of August 4, the Belgian 5-franc, 2-franc, 1-franc, and 50-centime silver coins were demonetized as of August 1, 1932. Actually, these coins have not been in circulation since the war, as they were at that time hoarded for their value as bullion and, later, gradually bought up by the treasury. Neither the Belgian Government nor the National Bank of Belgium holds any silver, the last remaining stocks having been sold about 3 years ago. BERMUDA The monetary unit is the pound, divided into 20 shillings of 12 pence each. The pound has a par value of approximately $4.8666. Present legal provisions.—Since January 1, 1842, when the Act of June 22, 1841, became effective, the British currency system has applied in Bermuda. Movements of silver are not restricted. Possibility of increased use of silver without new legislation.— The volume of silver in circulation depends simply on the demands of business. Attitude toward silver.—No change in the present use of silver is likely. Present employment of silver.—American money circulates freely. BOLIVIA The monetary unit is the boliviano, divided into 100 centavos. The boliviano has a par value of approximately $0.3650. Present legal provisions.—The currency is governed by the monetary reform law of July 11, 1928, put into effect by decree of May 2, 192*9,11 and by the law of December 7, 1929. Under the 1928 law,'old and new silver coins were made legal tender in payments not exceeding 10 bolivianos, and unlimited legal tender in payments to the Government. The law lists the new silver pieces shown in the following statement: 1 boliviano; 0.800 fine; gross weight, 15.0 grams. % boliviano; 0.800 fine; gross weight, 7.5 grams. y5 boliviano; 0.800 fine; gross weight, 3.0 grams. By the law of December 7, 1929, the Government renounced, for a period of 40 years, the right to issue silver coins in favor of the central bank. Under this law the need for small money will be supplied by the bank which will issue not over 7,000,000 bolivianos of 1-boliviano notes, secured by a 50 percent reserve in gold. The statutes of the Central Bank of Bolivia, which call for a 50 percent gold and gold-exchange reserve against demand liabilities, permit the inclusion of silver to the extent of one fifth.12 Article 17 of the 1928 law provides that the Government, through the Minister of Finance, shall meet without delay the demands of 11 The text of the law appears in the Annual Report of tne Director of the United States Mint for 1929, pp. 136-137. 12 Federal Reserve Bulletin, July 1932, p. 437. 23 M O N E T A R Y USE OF SILVER IN\" 19 3 3 the central bank for the issuance of silver and minor coins against the delivery at La Paz of legal gold coins and notes of the bank convertible at par. Article 18 provides that the law enter into force on the day of its promulgation, insofar as it refers to the coinage of silver. By the law of January 7, 1924, an export tax is charged on silver ore graded according to its value in London; 0.40 boliviano for each kilogram of fine silver when the London quotation for silver does not exceed 20 pence per standard ounce troy. The tax increases with higher values. Importation of silver in ore or bullion is free of duty. By laws of 1904 and 1905 exportation of silver money is free, but importation is forbidden. Silverware exports are charged a duty of 8 bolivianos per kilo, but articles of artistic or historical interest may not be exported. Various surcharges are added to duties. Possibility of increased use of silver without new legislation.— The 1928 law apparently indicates no limit to the amount of subsidiary silver which may be issued. From the fact that in 1931 and 1932 several bills calling for silver coinage ^ e r e introduced, it would seem to follow that new coinage is dependent upon special legislation. Attitude toward silver.—The above-mentioned bills were not approved. Apparently the main interest in coinage centered in copper, rather than silver, pieces. It is said that in Bolivia, where the currency has depreciated, the tendency is to use paper or baser metals, rather than silver. Present employment of silver.—Until the war, silver circulated in denominations of 1 boliviano and 50, 20, and 10 centavos, but today only a few of these—the 50- and 20-centavo pieces minted in 1908— are encountered. These two pieces weigh 10 and 4 grams, respectively, and are 10/12 fine. Under the 1908 law there were struck, in 1909, 700,000 bolivianos of 50-centavo pieces and 300,000 bolivianos of 20-centavo coins. At the end of 1932 the Central Bank of Bolivia held 174,000 bolivianos in Bolivian silver coin. Other banks held about 6,400 bolivianos. The Indians, forming well over half the population of the country, undoubtedly hoard a considerable amount of silver, and show some preference for silver coins over paper or nickel money. Their hoards are believed to be more of the rare old coins than of the 1909 minting. A very large proportion of the silver coins are perforated, having been used in necklaces or tied together for hoarding. BRAZIL The monetary unit is the milreis, divided into 1,000 reis. milreis has a par value of approximately $0.1196. The Present legal provisions.—According to a law (no. 4182) of November 13, 1920, silver may apparently be coined in any amount, provided that an equal amount of paper money be retired. At the same time, it is reported from Brazil, coinage of silver is limited by the law of December 31, 1912, to 15 percent of the paper currency circulation. 24 M O N E T A R Y USE OF SILVER IN 19 3 3 The budget law (no. 4632) of January 6, 1923, fixed the fineness of Brazil's silver coinage to correspond with that in force in Great Britain, namely 0.500. This was reaffirmed in Decree No. 15936 of January 24, 1923. A decree (no. 21358) of May 4, 1932, authorized the issuance of commemorative silver, copper, and nickel coins, and set no limit thereon, other than to fix the legal tender maximum for this issue at 40 milreis. Possibility of increased use of silver without new legislation.—In the opinion of the director of the Brazilian mint, there is no limit on the issuance of silver. In any case, should a legal obstacle be encountered, the coinage of additional silver could be provided by decree. If the 1912 law be regarded as limiting the coinage of silver, the maximum issue would be about 45,000,000 milreis, or between 8 and 9 times the present circulation of about 5,500,000 milreis. Attitude toward silver.—Brazil provides comparatively little silver (the yield in 1931 amounting to only 10,000 ounces) and there is no particular preference for the metal. The only motive which might, conceivably, induce the Government to coin silver would be the seigniorage. It is pointed out, however, that such profit is greater in the case of subsidiary coins of other metal. The present circulation of copper and nickel coins is estimated at 10 times that of silver. The increased employment of silver as subsidiary money appears unlikely. So, also, does the use of silver as a monetary reserve. Present employment of silver.—As stated above, the circulation of silver coins is estimated at 5,500,000 milreis. During the three years 1927-29, the coinage of silver amounted to 2,000,000 milreis. Not all of this is circulating, since much is hoarded in the interior, or lost. Under the provisions of legislation prior to the decree of May 4, 1932 (mentioned above), the legal-tender limit for silver coins is put at 20 milreis. Decree No. 5413 of 1889 provided for 2- and 1-milreis and 400-reis silver coins of 0.917 fine; Law No. 559 of 1898, for 4-, 2-, and 1-milreis and 400-reis silver coins of the same fineness; various laws from 1905 to 1913 for 2- and 1-milreis and 500-reis silver coins 0.900 fine; and legislation in 1920, 1922, and 1923 for 2-milreis coins 0.900 and, later, 0.500 fine. BRITISH EAST AFRICA (KENYA, UGANDA, AND TANGANYIKA) 13 The monetary unit is the East African shilling, divided into 100 cents. The principal unit used in foreign exchange transactions is the pound sterling. The par value of the East African shilling is approximately $0.2433. Present legal provisions.—The law provides for only two silver coins, the shilling and the 50-cent piece; these are unlimited legal tender. The currency is controlled by the East African Currency Board, which maintains a stable rate of exchange between British East Africa and London. There are no restrictions on the importation or exportation of silver in any form. In Uganda, since the substitution of East African currency for the florin currency in January 1922, the latter continues to be legal 13 See also Zanzibar. M O N E T A R Y USE OF SILVER I N 25 19 3 3 tender, although being withdrawn from circulation. (The florin of 100 cents made its appearance in 1921 as a substitute for the British Indian rupee and was accompanied by the shilling, which was to replace the half rupee.) Present employment of silver.—As of June 30, 1931, the stock of silver in circulation in British East Africa was reported by the currency board as £3,184,984, made up of £2,897,020 shilling currency, £68,964 \" florin and rupee currency and £219,000 \" in currency strong room.\" Silver in circulation in Tanganyika at the end of 1931 was reported as 10,684,301 shillings and silver \" in stock \" as 22,936,105 shillings. British silver circulates in the coastal towns and cities at a small discount. BRITISH EMPIRE See United Kingdom and the other principal dominions and colonies, which are separately treated in this bulletin. The British coinage system is used in a large part of the British Empire. According to British Under Secretary of State Amery, in a statement made in Parliament on February 26, 1920, British silver coinage is legal tender in the following 27 dominions, colonies, and protectorates:14 Country Legal-tender limit Australia Up to 40s.

Union of South Africa (including the mandated terUp to 40s. ritory of Southwest Africa and Wales Bay) According to the Bureau of the Mint, the British coinage system is in use in the following additional places: British East Africa (including Kenya, Uganda, and Tanganyika), Guernsey, Jersey, Papua (New Guinea). 14 Congressional Record, Senate, May 30, 1932, p. 11524. The comments in parentheses have been added by the author and are not included in the original statement. 15 Governed by the High Commissioner for South Africa. 26 M O N E T A R Y USE OF SILVER I N 19 3 3 The following is according to the Monthly Review of the Standard Bank of South Africa for December 1932: \" Since the departure of Great Britain from the gold standard in September 1931 British and South African silver coins have continued to circulate in the Union on the basis of equal value. In consequence, however, of heavy importations of the former from Rhodesia and overseas to obtain the exchange advantage, the Government decided to withdraw from circulation all British silver, and as from January 15 (1933) the latter will cease to be legal tender in the Union, and will realize only its current exchange value.\" 16 BRITISH GUIANA The monetary unit is the British Guiana dollar, divided into 100 cents. The British Guiana dollar has a par value of approximately $1.0138. Present legal provisions.—Both the pound sterling and the United States dollar are legal tender, the British Guiana dollar being pegged to sterling at 4 shillings 2 pence. Silver may not be exported without the governor's permission. Attitude toward silver.—There seems to be no intention to change the present monetary use of silver. Present employment of silver.—The British Guiana dollar is issued only in the form of paper notes. The recognized currency includes British silver coins and a local silver bit, or 4-penny piece. In 1926 the royal mint struck 30,000 of these pieces for British Guiana. According to the Bureau of the Mint, in 1930 silver in British Guiana banks and the treasury was, at face value, equivalent to $205,000 United States currency. BRITISH HONDURAS The monetary unit is the British Honduras dollar, divided into 100 cents. The British Honduras dollar has a par value of $1. Present legal provisions.—The currency was established by British Honduras Ordinance No. 31 of 1894, now chapters 35 and 36 of the Consolidated Laws of British Honduras, 1924. The silver money in use includes United States coins other than the standard silver dollar, these coins being accepted at par, and the coins named in the 1894 ordinance which are shown in the following table: Denomination 50 cents 25 cents.. 10 cents. 5 cents _ _ _ . . . _ . _ _ _ _ . . - - - - - - - ...

Possibility of increcosed use of silver without new legislation.— Article 5 of the coinage ordinance states that \" subsidiary coins may 16 For details see Union of South Africa. M O N E T A R Y USE OF SILVER I N 19 3 3 27 be from time to time coined for British Honduras, under the directions of the master of the mint, of the metals, denominations, weights, and finenesses (if any) specified in the third schedule to this ordinance.\" Article 6 states: \" If the Governor of British Honduras at any time requests that any new subsidiary coins, whether of silver, nickel, or mixed metal be coined, and the treasury and a secretary of state approve such request, those new coins may be so coined under the direction of the master of the mint.\" Attitude toward silver.—No report has been received to indicate any intention of altering the subsidiary position of silver in the monetary system. Present employment of silver.—In addition to the coins mentioned above, British coins are tendered occasionally, as when a British warship calls. The 5-cent silver piece is now rarerly found in circulation. BRITISH INDIA 17 The monetary unit is the rupee, divided into 16 annas. The rupee has a par value of approximately $0,365. British Indian coins are in use in Ceylon, British Somaliland, Zanzibar, Pemba, Mauritius, and elsewhere, but are being withdrawn from circulation in Iraq (which see). The monetary unit in Ceylon is the rupee, but fractional coins differ from those in use in British India. (See Ceylon.) In Mauritius, the rupee is divided into 100 cents and \" cent\" coins are in use. Mauritius employs silver coins in denominations of one, one half, one fifth, and one tenth rupee. In Zanzibar silver coins in the denomination of one eighth rupee are issued; these coins in silver content are proportionate to the rupee silver piece. Present legal provisions.—The British Indian \" company \" rupee was established in 1835 by the East India Company, to replace the sicca rupee. The company rupee was replaced by the Government rupee in 1862, but the weight of the coin was left unchanged at 180 grains (11.66 grams) and the fineness at 11/12. This has continued to be India's standard coin, although, with the closing of the mints in 1893, the silver standard was abandoned in favor of the sterlingexchange standard. Since 1899 the rupee's exchange value has been officially pegged in terms of sterling, but at a ratio altered from time to time.18 According to the Indian currency amendment act (no. 4) of 1927, which became effective April 1 of that year, rupees are redeemable in gold or, at the option of the controller of the currency, in the equivalent in sterling for immediate delivery in London, at the rate of 21 rupees, 3 annas, 10 pies per tola of fine gold. (One tola equals three eighths ounce troy, or 180 grains.) However, conversions are limited to a minimum of 1,065 tolas of gold or the equivalent in sterling.19 17 Including British Baluchistan, Sonthal Parganas, and the Pargana of Spiti. See also Ceylon, Goa, Hyderabad, Pondicherry, and Travancore. 18 Space does not permit a discussion here of the workings of the gorld, or sterling, exchange standard in India.

Laurence Laughlin, A New Exposition of Money, Credit, and Prices, pp. 4 7 1 - 4 7 2 . 19 Based on price which Bank of England is by law required to pay for gold in London.

Ordinance No. V I I of September 24 repealed Ordinance No. VI and restricted sales of gold or sterling to normal trade requirements, etc. Ordinance No. VI of January 30,1932, repealed all restrictions embodied in Ordinance No. VII of 1931. Silver coinage is governed by the Indian coinage act of 1906, as amended. Act No. IV of March 6, 1918, replaced the 2-anna (one eighth rupee) silver piece by a nickle-copper coin. Act No. X X I of 1919 provided for similar nickel-copper 4- and 8-anna pieces, which were issued from 1919 to 1922. Since then issuance of these denominations exclusively in silver has been resumed.21 Details of British India's silver coinage in circulation are shown in the following table: Gross weight Denomination Fineness Legal tender limit Grams 1 rupee }/2 rupee 34 rupee yB rupee 0.916% .916% .916% . 916% 11.6638 5.8319 2.9160 1.4575 Grains 180.0 90.0 45.0 22.5 Unlimited. Do. 1 rupee. Do. Although minting of silver one eighth rupee pieces was discontinued in 1918, they continue to be legal tender and are, therefore, included in the table. They are being gradually withdrawn from circulation whenever presented at the currency offices and treasuries. In fact all silver coins minted prior to 1876 are being so withdrawn. No restriction is placed on the exportation of coin or bullion. On imports of silver an import duty of 7% annas per ounce was assessed in 1931, a corresponding excise duty being levied on silver mined in India.22 India's currency reserve may be divided into two parts: (a) The paper-currency reserve and (b) the gold-standard reserve. 20 At a fixed price per tola of 21 rupees, 3 annas, and 10 pies. 21 Current details of coinage are published annually in the Report of the British Indian Controller of the Currency. 22 The following history of the duty is reprinted from the Silver Market, Trade Promotion Series No. 139, pp. 4 3 - 4 4 : \" A n import duty on silver was first levied in India in 1894, at the rate of 5 percent ad valorem. This was increased in 1910 to 4 annas per fine ounce, and in 1920 was abolished entirely. In February 1930 the Indian Government announced the restoration of an import duty on silver, amounting to 4 annas (then about 9 cents) per ounce troy, without allowance for alloy or impurity. Exported silver was made subject to a drawback of the full duty. The new measure took effect Mar. 1, 1930. The chief object of the duty was to raise revenue. A t the same time it gave a certain advantage to the Indian Government in the sale in India of silver taken from the currency reserve. On Mar. 17 a bill was introduced, levying on newly mined Indian silver an excise duty equivalent to the import duty. The bill subsequently was passed, and made retroactive as from Mar. 17. \" The continued need for additional revenues' resulted in an increase in the duty on silver from 4 annas to 6 annas per ounce, effective Mar. 2, 1931. On Sept. 29, 1931, there was presented to the Indian legislative assembly a bill providing a surcharge of 25 percent on existing duties, which raised the duty on silver, both the import and excise, from 6 annas to 7 % annas per ounce. The measure became effective provisionally on Sept. 30, pending passage by the assembly and approval by the governor general.' On Nov. 28, 1931, the measure was passed by the assembly and received the approval of the governor general.\" It is still in effect. M O N E T A R Y USE OF SILVER IN\" 19 3 3 29 (a) The paper-currency reserve is governed by section 19 of the Indian paper currency act ( X of 1923) which provides for a reserve in gold and silver amounting to not less than 50 percent of the total note circulation, the balance to be held in \" rupee \" and \" sterling \" securities. Not over 50,000,000 rupees of the reserve may be held in gold in England. Sterling securities in the reserve must be securities of the United Kingdom, maturing not over 1 year from the date of purchase. Rupee securities must be securities of the Government of India, and may not exceed 200,000,000 rupees. Of this amount, not over 120,000,000 rupees may represent so-called ad hoc securities, created by the Government of India for the purpose of securing an expansion of the currency, and issued to the controller of the currency. When it is desired to contract the currency on account of a slack season or for special purposes, as to strengthen the exchange through firm interest rates, this is effected by contracting the ad hoc securities.23 (b) The gold-standard reserve has been built up from the profits on the coinage of rupees plus (until April 1923) interest on securities held therein.24 Possibility of increased use of silver without new legislation.— The Indian Government is the sole currency authority in British India and may increase the circulation of silver without special authorization. Article 4 of the Indian coinage act of 1906 states : \" The following silver coins only shall be coined at the mint for issue under the authority of the governor general in council * * *.\" Attitude toward silver.—The Royal Commission on Indian Currency and Finance (Hilton-Young commission) in 1926, in recommending the gold-bullion standard for India, also advised that the Government, over a 10-year period, reduce its stock of silver held in the treasury from the approximately 850,000,000 rupees held on April 3, 1926, to a maximum of 250,000,000 rupees, or a reduction from approximately 292,200,000 fine ounces to only 85,937,500 fine ounces. This recommendation was adopted as a policy of the Government, which, between 1927 and March 1932, sold 127,581,564 fine ounces of the metal. Notwithstanding these sales, a large net return of rupees from circulation has more than replaced the silver sold, so that the Government's holdings of the white metal at the end of 1932 totaled 1,106,600,000 rupees, or the equivalent of 380,394,000 fine ounces. It appears to be the policy of the Government to sell silver in accordance with the 1926 recommendations, but without creating undue disturbance in the silver market. Naturally, the sales are not announced beforehand. The attitude of the Government toward silver was expounded by the finance member, Sir George Schuster, 23 To provide for seasonal or exceptional needs, such as crop movements, the currencyauthority is allowed by statute to issue currency notes as emergency currency to the Imperial Bank of India to the limit of 120,000,000 rupees against hundis, or internal bills of exchange. With the exception of this emergency currency, the amount of currency notes in circulation may not exceed the total of the reserve in metal and securities, excepting that 50-rupee or 100-rupee notes which have not been presented for 40 years, or 1,000-rupee notes which have not been presented for 100 years after their issue, need not be considered as being in circulation, for the purpose of the reserve. They are considered as having been issued on the credit of the revenues of India and, if ever presented, are to be paid out of those revenues. 24 The interest is now credited to the revenues of the Government as is the similar interest: earned by the paper currency reserve. (See Report of the Royal Commission on Indian Currency and Finance. 1926, vol. I, p. 6.) 30 M O N E T A R Y USE OF SILVER I N 19 3 3 in his budget speech on February 28, 1931. Because of the importance of India in the silver market, the remarks are here quoted in full. I announced in my budget speech last year that the Government of India would be prepared to cooperate with other silver interests if any practical scheme could be devised for controlling the production of new silver and the sale of new and existing stocks. Unfortunately, the only response to my offer has been on the lines indicated in certain utterances which have appeared in the press by representatives of the main producing interests in America. In general, these gentlemen propose that their own production of new silver should remain unrestricted, but that governments and others who hold large stocks of silver should refrain from realizing their holdings, and leave the world's markets free for the new production. Now, whatever criticisms nonofficial members in this house may have made in the past on our policy of selling silver, I am sure that they would not expect the Government of India to part with the country's rights by acceding to any such one-sided arrangement. The demand that the Government of India should refrain from selling is, indeed, an astonishing proposition when the facts are studied. For, in fact, the whole world depends on India as a consumer. In the five years ending March 31, 1930, India absorbed about 540,000,000 ounces of silver or 108,000,000 ounces per annum. According to present indications, her absorption, even in the current year, will be up to this average, so that the total absorption in six years will be about 650,000,000 ounces. As against this, the Government of India have sold out of their own holdings a total of only about 90,000,000 ounces since 1926. Yet it is suggested that even this moderate realization is to stop, and that India is to stand aside and keep her own home market free to absorb the production from the mines of Mexico and the United States. This is clearly an unacceptable idea, and, however anxious we may be—as, indeed, we are—to help, we must, as a condition of cooperation, secure fair consideration of India's interests. In the meanwhile wTe must retain a free hand. We must also ask ourselves whether cooperation is likely to lead to the desired result. The more I study the matter the mpre convinced I am that the fall in the price of silver is part of a much wider movement, and the more doubtful I become whether silver can be dealt with successfully in isolation. The fall in silver prices, in fact, has not really been out of relation to that in the case of other metals. Taking the price of silver, tin, lead, spelter, and copper on March 31, 1926, and treating these prices as 100, the figures for the various metals at the end of January 1931 were 46.3 for silver, 41.4 for tin, 44.8 for lead, 38.1 for spelter, and 78.1 for copper. Therefore, with the sole exception of copper, all these metals had fallen more than silver. Without going into further details, these facts alone indicate that, although a fall in silver prices may have wider results—owing to its currency uses—than a fall in the prices of other metals, nevertheless the causes that fall may be the same. Any action which does not touch the causes of the disease is hardly likely to provide a sound remedy. The conclusion to which this leads me is that, if there is to be an international conference of any kind for dealing with silver, it would be of far greater value to the world if it could also deal with all those other factors in the present world situation which might be affected by international cooperation. I believe that such international cooperation is needed, and that India can play a very important part in it. But the development of this idea would take me into a wider sphere than I can traverse tonight. I hope to find other occasions for its discussion. Regarding Indian hoarding of the precious metals, the matter has been discussed in previous publications of this bureau.25 As to the native attitude toward gold or silver as the standard of value opinion seems to be divided. 26 See Trade Information Bulletin No. 457, The Bombay Bullion Market, by Don C. Bliss, Jr., and Trade Information Bulletin No. 682, The Price of Silver, Trade Information Bulletin No. 742, The Silver Market in 1 9 3 0 ; and Trade Promotion Series No. 139, The Silver Market, by Herbert M. Bratter. 31 M O N E T A R Y TJSE OF SILVER IN\" 1 9 3 3 Present employment of silver.—Apart from the information on this subject given above, the following information relative to rupees in circulation and in the Government reserve is pertinent. It was estimated that rupee pieces in circulation totaled 2,870,000,000 in 1928.2* In 1931 the corresponding estimate was 1,433,000,000 rupees.27 No actual statistics of the circulation are available. From 1835 to 1923, inclusive, whole rupees were issued to a total of 6,475,695,779. Since 1923 none have been coined. On December 31, 1932, notes in circulation were valued at 1,748,008,000 rupees. This represented a slight decrease from the previous year, when the circulation was 1,793,031,000 rupees. The reserve on December 31, 1932, was as follows: Silver coin, 978,295,000 rupees; gold bullion, 186,774,000 rupees; silver bullion, 128,341,000 rupees ; and securities, 454,598,000 rupees. The percentage of metallic reserve to circulation was 73.99 as against 72.14 percent on December 31, 1931. During 1932 there occurred a decline in silver coin which, on December 31, 1931, had stood at 1,150,442,000 rupees. The gold bullion, however, showed a large increase over the 45,645,000 rupees held at the end of 1931. Silver coin and bullion held by the treasury in recent years is shown by the following table. The rupee figures may be converted into fine ounces by multiplying by 0.34375.

A subsidiary 25-cent British North Borneo silver piece is minted 0.500 fine. It weighs approximately 2.85 grams and is legal tender to the amount of 5 Straits dollars. All Straits Settlements money is legal tender in British North Borneo. G. Findlay Shirras in the Economic Journal (London), December 1929.
