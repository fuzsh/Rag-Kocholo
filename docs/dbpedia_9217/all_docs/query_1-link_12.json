        "text": "The National Flag of Uganda was adopted on October 9, 1962. The flag has been designed by Grace Ibingira, who was the Ugandan Minister of Justice.\n\nThe National Flag of Uganda features six equal horizontal bands of black (top), yellow, red, black, yellow, and red. The flag also includes a white disc superimposed at the center, which is featuring a grey-crowned crane, facing the hoist side of the flag. The black color stands for the nation's people. The yellow color represents vitality and sunshine in Africa. The red color represents the color of blood that connects all Africans, hence symbolizing African brotherhood. The grey-crowned crane is the national symbol of Uganda – and is also known for its gentleness. The symbol was also used as a military badge during the colonial period. The raised leg of the bird symbolizes the country moving forward. The flag has a height-to-width proportion ratio of 2:3.\n\nHistory of the Flag of Uganda\n\nUganda was formerly administered by the Imperial British East Africa Company (IBEAC), which was a commercial enterprise developed to stimulate trade in parts of Africa that were controlled by British colonial powers. In 1893, the IBEAC transferred its administration rights of the region, which primarily included the Buganda Kingdom, to the British government. In 1894, the Uganda Protectorate was created, which was composed of land that makes up present-day Uganda. In 1914 the Ugandan Protectorate adopted a flag, which featured a British Blue ensign defaced with the union jack on the canton side of the flag. It also included a disc that superimposed a grey-crowned crane. The flag was used until March 1962, when a national flag was adopted upon the country's independence from Britain. The first proposed flag had thicker green and blue vertical stripes separated by narrow yellow stripes. A silhouette of a yellow crane facing the hoist side of the flag was included in the center. On April 25, 1962, the Democratic Party lost an election to the Uganda People’s Congress (UPC), and the party rejected the flag and instead proposed Uganda's current flag, which was based on the UPC’s flag of red, yellow, and black horizontal stripes.\n\nHistorical flags of Uganda\n\nColonial flag of Uganda\n\nFlag of Uganda\n\nSymbols of Uganda\n\nThe National Coat of Arms of Uganda\n\nThe National Coat of Arms of Uganda was approved on October 1, 1962, and was officially adopted on October 9, 1962. The coat of arms features a shield and two spears - which represent the ability and willingness of Ugandans to defend their country. At the top of the shield are waves - which represent Lake Victoria and Lake Albert. The sun at the center represents brilliant days of sunshine enjoyed in Uganda. The traditional drum at the bottom of the shield symbolizes the summoning and dancing of the Ugandan people for ceremonies and meetings. Supporting the shield are a Crested Crane and a Ugandan Kob. The Crested crane is a subspecies of the Grey-crowned Crane, which is the national bird of Uganda. The Ugandan Kob is a symbolic representation of the abundant wildlife. The shield is seen standing on a green mound and symbolizes the fertile land which is placed directly above a representation of River Nile. The river is flanked by the two main cash crops of the country – coffee and cotton. The national motto: “For God and My Country” is displayed on a ribbon below.\n\nNational Motto\n\n\"Kwa ajili ya Mungu na Nchi yangu\" (\"For God and My Country\")\n\nNational Anthem\n\nAnthem Title: \"Oh Uganda, Land of Beauty\"\n\nMusic Composer: George Wilberforce Kakoma\n\nLyricist: George Wilberforce Kakoma\n\nDate of Adoption: October 9,1962\n\n\"Oh Uganda, Land of Beauty\" is the official national anthem of Uganda. The muisc of the anthem and its lyrics have been created by George Wilberforce Kakoma. The anthem was officially adopted as the national anthem of Uganda on October 9, 1962. Uganda has one of the world's shortest national anthems.\n\n\"Oh Uganda, Land of Beauty\"\n\nOh, Uganda! may God uphold thee,\n\nWe lay our future in thy hand;\n\nUnited, free for liberty\n\ntogether we'll always stand.\n\nOh, Uganda! the land of freedom,\n\nOur love and labour we give;\n\nAnd with neighbours all\n\nAt our country's call\n\nIn peace and friendship we'll live.\n\nOh, Uganda! the land that feeds us,\n\nBy sun and fertile soil grown;\n\nFor our own dear land,\n\nWe'll always stand,\n\nThe Pearl of Africa's Crown.\n\nThe Currency of Uganda is the Ugandan shilling\n\nThe current official currency used in Uganda is the Ugandan shilling (UGX). Until 2013, the shilling was divided into 100 cents. However, today there are no subdivisions.\n\nThe UGX is considered to be a stable currency. The euro, sterling pound, and the USD are also used in the country, particularly by foreigners. On 1 February 2012, the Bank of Uganda, which is responsible for the production, circulation, and stability of the currency reduced its rate to 22% due to three months of reduction in the level of inflation.\n\nCoins\n\nCurrently, coins in denominations of 1, 2, 5,10,50,100,200,500 and 1000 UGX are in circulation.\n\nBanknotes\n\nCurrently, banknotes in denominations of 1,000, 2,000, 5,000, 10,000, 20,000 and 50,000 UGX are in circulation.\n\nThe 2,000 notes were introduced in 2010, in the same year the Bank of Uganda introduced new versions of the Ugandan Banknote bearing the country's historical, cultural, and natural resources. They had improved security features as Uganda became the first country in Africa to incorporate the SPARK technology in its banknotes.\n\nUgandan shilling Banknote\n\nUgandan shilling Coin\n\nHistorical currencies of Uganda\n\nBefore the Ugandan shilling was introduced in 1966, the authority for managing the monetary affairs of the country was the sole discretion of the East African Currency Board. At that time, the currency used in the country was the East African shilling. In 1966, as per the BoU Act, the Bank of Uganda was established and the first currency of Uganda was issued. The East African shilling was replaced at par with the Ugandan shilling. High inflation in 1987, led to the introduction of a new shilling (UGX) that replaced the old currency at a rate of 1UGX = 100 UGS.\n\nThe first coins of denominations 5, 10, 20, and 50 cents, as well as 1 and 2 shillings, were introduced in 1966. In 1987, the coins were remodeled, and the five- and ten-shilling coins in the shape of a heptagon were introduced. In 1998 the 50,100,200-, and 500-shilling coins were introduced. The denomination of coins below 50 shillings was finally withdrawn. On October 9, 2012, 1000 shilling 50th Anniversary coins were issued by the Bank of Uganda to commemorate the 50 years of Independence.\n\nThe Ugandan notes were first introduced in 1966 in denominations of 5, 10, 20, and 100 shillings. The 50-shilling coin was introduced in 1973, in 1983 the 500 and 1,000 notes were introduced followed by the 5000-shilling note in 1985. In 1987 the notes were remodeled and introduced in the denominations of 5, 10, 20, 50, 100, and 200 shillings. A newer model of the 500 and 1,000 notes were introduced in 1991. The new version of the 5,000-shilling note was introduced in 1993 followed by 10,000 in 1993 and the 50,000-shilling note in 2003."
