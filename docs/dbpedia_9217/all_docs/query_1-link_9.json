        "text": "Uganda’s central bank, the Bank of Uganda, was founded in 1966. It monitors Uganda’s commercial banks, serves as the government’s bank, and issues the national currency, the Uganda shilling. The government sets the shilling’s official exchange rate against foreign currencies.\n\nHead Of State And Government:\n\nPresident: Yoweri Museveni, assisted by Prime Minister: Robinah Nabbanja\n\nPopulation:\n\n(2024 est.) 47,066,000\n\nForm Of Government:\n\nmultiparty republic with one legislative house (Parliament [4651])\n\nOfficial Languages:\n\nEnglish; Swahili\n\nRecent News\n\nAug. 18, 2024, 6:19 PM ET (Nation.Africa)\n\nHighway vs Kitende boys’ football match pick of today’s action\n\nAug. 18, 2024, 9:19 AM ET (Nation.Africa)\n\nPresident Museveni officially opens East Africa Secondary School Games\n\nAug. 17, 2024, 5:15 AM ET (Voice of America)\n\nMass circumcision marketed to tourists in Uganda spurs controversy\n\nAug. 13, 2024, 1:28 PM ET (AP)\n\nAn ex-commander of Lord's Resistance Army rebels is convicted in Uganda of atrocities in rare trial\n\nAug. 11, 2024, 11:17 PM ET (AP)\n\nRubbish collapses at landfill site in Uganda's capital, killing at least 18 people\n\nThe Uganda Commercial Bank and the Uganda Development Bank serve most of the commercial and financial needs of the country. There are also commercial banks owned by Ugandan, British, South African, Indian, Egyptian, and Libyan firms. There is a stock exchange in Kampala.\n\nUganda has participated in several regional economic organizations, including the Common Market for Eastern and Southern Africa, the Cotonou Convention, the Kagera Basin Organization, the Intergovernmental Authority on Development, and the East African Community Customs Union. Its principal exports are coffee, fish and fish products, gold, tobacco, cotton, and tea. The main imports are machinery and transport equipment, basic manufactures, food and live animals, and chemicals. Its principal trading partners include South Sudan, Kenya, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, China, India, and Japan.\n\nServices\n\nWith its numerous national parks that contain a wide variety of animals, Uganda is a natural tourist destination. From independence until the early 1970s, tourism was a major part of the economy and ranked third after coffee and cotton in producing foreign exchange. Under President Amin, however, tourism ceased and the national parks were neglected. Since the mid-1980s tourism has slowly increased, and foreign investment in new hotels has also expanded. However, Uganda’s tourist industry was affected by political instability in surrounding regions during the 1990s, although it rebounded in the early 21st century.\n\nLabour and taxation\n\nThe government is the country’s largest employer. Attempts to decrease the number of government workers in the early 1990s met with failure. The Museveni government attempted to increase the status of wage labourers after it took power in the mid-1980s. Cooperative societies, largely focused on agricultural export products, numbered in the thousands at the beginning of the 21st century.\n\nTax revenue in the form of customs duties, sales taxes, and income taxes provides the majority of Uganda’s budget, and grants provide the remainder. The majority of the budget goes to capital expenditures, wages and salaries, education and security, with health receiving less than 5 percent.\n\nTransportation and telecommunications\n\nBeing a landlocked state, Uganda relies heavily on Kenya and Tanzania (particularly the former) for access to the sea. The country has more than 620 miles (1,000 km) of rail line, but rail travel is now infrequently used by the public. Linking Kampala with Kilindini Harbour at Mombasa, Kenya, is a rail line that passes via Jinja, Tororo, Leseru, Nakuru, and Naivasha. Kampala is also connected to the north by a rail line that crosses the Pakwach bridge and to the western parts of the country by a line that reaches the border town of Kasese.\n\nThe main international airport is at Entebbe, Uganda’s former capital, about 20 miles (30 km) west of Kampala. By the end of the 20th century, air travel had expanded to include major international carriers as well as numerous local air companies, which serviced the interior of the country. Kisoro in the far southwestern corner of the country, bordering the Democratic Republic of the Congo and Rwanda, gained an airstrip in 1999.\n\nThere are about 16,650 miles (26,800 km) of roads in Uganda, but only a small fraction of them are paved. A number of road-repair projects are under way, but much of Uganda’s road system is in great need of repair. There is limited shipping service on the Kagera River and on Lakes Albert and Victoria.\n\nThe number of telephone lines is being expanded under foreign consortium agreements and has more than doubled since the mid-1990s. Much more prevalent, however, is cellular service; in existence in Uganda since the mid-1990s, cell phone use had rapidly expanded by the early 21st century, as did the number of Ugandans using the Internet."
