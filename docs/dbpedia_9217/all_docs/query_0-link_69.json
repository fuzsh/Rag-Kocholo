The Bantu expansion from a West African center of dispersal reached the area by the 1st millennium AD. With the borders of the modern state at the crossroads of the Bantu, Nilo-Saharan and Afro-Asiatic ethno-linguistic areas of Africa, Kenya is a truly multi-ethnic state.\n\nEuropean and Arab presence in Mombasa dates to the Early Modern period, but European exploration of the interior began only in the 19th century. The British Empire established the East Africa Protectorate in 1895, from 1920 known as the Kenya Colony.\n\nThe independent Republic of Kenya was formed in 1964. It was ruled as a de facto single-party state by the Kenya African National Union (KANU), a Kikuyu-Luo alliance led by Jomo Kenyatta during 1963 to 1978. Kenyatta was succeeded by Daniel arap Moi, who ruled until 2002. Moi attempted to transform the de facto single-party status of Kenya into a de jure status during the 1980s, but with the end of the Cold War, the practices of political repression and torture which had been \"overlooked\" by the Western powers as necessary evils in the effort to contain communism were no longer tolerated. Moi came under pressure, notably by US ambassador Smith Hempstone, to restore a multi-party system, which he did by 1991. Moi won elections in 1992 and 1997, which were overshadowed by political killings on both sides\n\nHistoric events of Mombasa, one can obtain directly from Britishpathe. most recommendable for purchase, click on link marked in green:\n\nHMS Kenya In Mombasa (1952) Sailors from HMS Kenya marching through streets of Mombasa.\n\nMombasa Welcomes The Princess (1956)In Mombasa, Princess Margaret watches dancing at Purdah ceremony...\n\nSelected Originals - Mombasa Welcomes The Princess (1956) Material related to newsreel story...\n\nDuke Of Edinburgh In Mombasa (1956) Lady Baring, Wife of Governor of Kenya, and Duke of Edinburgh in...\n\nEnsuring A Place In Paradise (1930) Citizens of Mombasa pay homage to Allah at ceremony of \"hasen...\n\nKenya (1953) Various shots of town, country and port of Kenya, showing people working.\n\nMombassa - Gateway To Kenya (1953) Life in Mombassa for natives.

The youngest former president in American history, he was looking for adventure and for a project that would take him away from Washington, D.C., and politics. A naturalist at heart, he turned, not surprisingly, to his boyhood fascination for natural history. Three weeks after the inauguration of his successor, William Howard Taft, Roosevelt set out for British East Africa to hunt big game. The Smithsonian Institution co-sponsored the expedition. Many of the specimens were destined for the new U.S. National Museum building, then under construction on the Mall and today known as the National Museum of Natural History.\n\nFormer US President Teddy Roosevelt’s Drunken Rampage in Nairobi\n\nhttp://owaahh.com/former-us-president-teddy-roosevelts-drunken-rampage-in-nairobi/\n\nThe real heroes of modern-day African postal services risked their lives delivering letters by running in the 1800s\n\nIn Ancient Africa, communication was done through music, drumming and on critical occasions, the sending of royal servants and soldiers. In times when a piece of information was very sensitive or better delivered in person, royal kings left their palaces to speak with other kings behind closed doors.\n\nBetween 1877 and the Conference of Berlin Sir William Mackinnon was allowed to enter into arrangements with the Sultan who conceded all his mainland possessions…He started the first steamship and mail service: had helped in providing a telegram cable service to Zanzibar…etc\n\nThe interior took shape after the railways was introduced and in short six tears … before that the BEA functioning in BEA had two post offices, four agencies all on the Coast…Mombasa, Kismayu, Lamu, Malindi, Takaungu and Wasin …\n\nHere are Time Tables for the Runner Mails to and from-Mombasa-Wasin, Relayed Runner Mails….Mombasa-Takaungu, Malindi…..\n\nRunner Mails- Voi –Taveta…Runner Mails…- Kapiti –Machakos..\n\nMails by Uganda Railways\n\nNairobi-Kiambu-Chaniabridge & Fort Hall and Nyeri Mail Service..\n\nFort Hall-Embu-Meru- and Marsabit Mail services..\n\nRunner Mail….Kiambu & Juja Service\n\nRunner Mails-Eldama Revine\n\nRunner Mail- Lumbwa-Kericho\n\nRelayed Runner and Mule Mails-Kibigori, Nandi, Uasin Gishu Service\n\nRunner Mails .._- Kisumu-Yala River-Mumias\n\nMail Services between Entebbe & Kampala...\n\nAfter settling, the Europeans realised the lack of postal systems. They believed that not every piece of information could be carried by word of mouth especially because there was an obvious language barrier. As foreigners, it was also impossible for them to navigate the land well and travel with information. The German settlers in Namibia and Botswana waited for as good as two years to receive letters from neighbouring towns and their homeland.\n\nThis saw the birth of postal carriers who till today are celebrated in Southern Africa…By ELIZABETH OFOSUAH JOHNSON.\n\nhttps://face2faceafrica.com/article/the-real-heroes-of-modern-day-african-postal-services-risked-their-lives-delivering-letters-by-running-in-the-1800s\n\nPOSTAL HISTORY\n\nThe first post office in the area under consideration was the German office at Lamu. The Denhardt brothers who had been trading in the area for some years organised a post for the Sultan of Witu (Witu lies inland from Lamu).\n\nThe Imperial British East Africa Company was granted a charter in 1889 for the territory between the Juba river to the North and the Umba river to the South. The postal activities of the Company., began in 1890. The G.P.O. in London had written the following memo on the 10 January 1889\n\nThe Directors of the Imperial British East African Company incorporated by Royal Charter have asked this department to state the terms on which it would be willing to arrange with the company for a mail service to and from Mombasa.\n\nThe British Contract Steamers on the Zanzibar line call at that port regularly, as required by the Foreign Office.\n\nIt is understood that the Company intends to establish a Post office at Mombasa and they desire to have postal relations with this Department similar to those arranged three years ago with the British North Borneo Company and based upon the general principles of the Postal Union.\n\nFrom a departmental point of view there is no reason why an arrangement should not be made with the British East African Company in the direction desired but it was necessary in the first instance to ascertain from the Foreign Office for your information whether any political objections existed to the establishment of a quasi British Post Office at Mombasa.\n\nThe Foreign Office stated that in Lord Salisbury’s opinion the North Borneo case forms a very good precedent for dealing with the present application, and that his Lordship sees no objection to the establishment of postal relations between this country and the British East African Company at Mombasa; but he leaves it for you to consider whether in the present disturbed condition of affairs on the Coast, the proposed arrangements can be conveniently carried out.\n\nPerhaps you will be good enough to signify your views as to the expediency of deferring the arrangements or otherwise.\n\nPostal service evolution in Kenya\n\nWhereas Tommy Woods’ general store on Victoria Street (today’s Tom Mboya Street) in Nairobi may be considered by some to have been the first formal post office in the 1890s, postal services in Kenya date back to the 17th Century. After the Portuguese overpowered the Arabs on the East African coast, they installed a governor in Mombasa in 1592 and there is evidence of official correspondence between the port town and the outside world from 1610. The mail was carried by ship to the Arabian peninsula and India then transmitted overland to Europe.

It was rebuilt on the same site, there was deep suspicion between IBEA officials and the railway engineers, it is historically known that IBEA were in trouble around that time, in Uganda too, IBEA Commissioner John Ainsworth — who was running a broke company and thus the Railways authority had the uper hand and ran the show.\n\nThe G.P.O was transferred from Mombasa to Nairobi on 01st March 1909,\n\nA new building (below) was opened on 20th October 1909 , the original building becoming the Victoria Street branch office.\n\nPostage stamps and postal history of British East Africa\n\nFrom Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia\n\nJump to navigationJump to search\n\nThis is a survey of the postage stamps and postal history of British East Africa.\n\nBritain had interests in this area as early as 1824. Missionaries are known to have settled in the area in 1844. The Imperial British East Africa Company obtained a concession in 1887 to administer this area, from Sultan Bargash of the Sultanate of Zanzibar. The company started to experience financial difficulties in 1891. The situation was made more difficult in 1892 when Britain declared the Sultanate of Zanzibar part of the Congo Free Trade Zone and thus depriving the company of import duties.[1] On 1 July 1895, the British government took over the administration of this area when the company was facing bankruptcy.\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Postage_stamps_and_postal_history_of_British_East_Africa\n\nThe Postal Corporation of Kenya, PCK or Posta, is the oldest parastatal in Kenya having been founded in 1901 as the Postal Services of British EA (PSBEA).\n\nThe first General Post Office (GPO) was transferred from Mombasa to Nairobi on 01 st March 1908, the new building as shown above was opened on 20th October 1909.\n\nVictoria Street branch office in the early days...\n\n1909 it was opened along Sixth Avenue (Now Kenyatta Avenue).\n\nAbove photo of General Post Office (GPO) in Nairobi in the 1930s.\n\nThe Holy Family Church behind on the left?\n\nBritish East Africa, the Stamps and their Postal Usage, 1890-1902\n\nClick on Stamp\n\nBritish East Africa\n\nThe Stamps and Their Postal Usage, 1890-1902\n\nEnsign of the Imperial British East Africa Company\n\nhttp://www.exponet.info/exhibit.php?exhibit_ID=825&lng=EN\n\nhttp://www.japhila.cz/hof/0824/index0824a.htm\n\nhttp://georgekrieger.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/BEA-Exhibit-May-2011.pdf\n\nhttp://georgekrieger.com/\n\nEast African, Stamps\n\nhttp://www.thingspostal.org.uk/eastafrica/stamps.html\n\nThe Cancellation of Kenya 1890-1963 (Postal)\n\nClick on photo below to enlarge\n\nThe Evolution of Currency on Eastern Coast and Kenya\n\nThe presence of Indians in East Africa is well documented in the Periplus of the Erythrean Sea or Guidebook of Red Sea by an ancient Greek author written in 60 AD. The ancient Indian work the Puranas also mention the East African coast as well interior of Kenya as far as Lake Victoria, which was known as ’ Nil (Nile?) Sarover,’ Lake Nil, and knew the source the of ‘Nil’ Nile.\n\nIndian merchant mariners, Arab seafarers, Chinese and Persian sailors, among other seafarers have all visited the East African coastline stretching from the Horn of Africa to the port of Sofala in the south.\n\nFrom the times of the Egyptian Pharaohs who hired Phoenician mariners to the pre-biblical era and after, these visitors came to trade on the African coast.\n\nThe Indians have had ancient connections not just with the East African coastline but also its hinterland. The more intrepid Indian ‘nakhoda,’ skippers, undertook caravans on foot safaris to the interior. They knew of places as far inland as Uganda. They also knew the Ruwenzori Mountains as ‘Chandragiri Shekhar,’ Moon Mountain or Mountains of the Moon.\n\nEarly currency used was “Shell” of Cypraea moneta, the money cowry\n\nThis species is most abundant in the Indian Ocean, and was collected in the Maldive Islands, in Sri Lanka, along the Malabar coast, in Borneo and on other East Indian islands, and in various parts of the African coast from Ras Hafun to Mozambique. Cowry shell money was important at one time or another in the trade networks of Africa. Battering of exchange of goods was another method of trade.\n\nThe history of the Indian rupee traces back to Ancient India in circa 6th century BCE, ancient India was one of the earliest issuers of coins in the world.\n\nHistorically, the rupee (derived from the Sanskrit word raupya), was a silver coin.\n\nLater, the Maria Theresa Thalers was also used with other silver coins such as the rupees, used during earlier periods.\n\nThe discovery of large quantities of silver in the United States and several European colonies resulted in a decline in the value of silver relative to gold, devaluing India's standard currency. This event was known as \"the fall of the rupee.\" This had severe consequences in the nineteenth century, when the strongest economies in the world were on the gold standard.\n\nThe East African Currency Board was established in 1919 to issue and administer the currency circulating in British East Africa.\n\nCairo came to assert a pivotal role between the trade of : Indian Ocean, including East Africa, and that of the mediterranean, linking with the developing European as well as North African and Byzantine markets. Increased demands for East African ivory in the 11th century are fleeted by silver and occasional gold coins from timid Egypt found at places on the Swahili coast and islands (and the beginnings of local coinages, first in silver and then in copper, the latter metal obtained from the Southern African trade).\n\nThis Egyptian direction was not the sole one. The commerce between East Africa and India also increased, and continued doing so until the 16th century (when the Portuguese intervened). So did that with China, although this was mostly indirect. Chinese celadon and porcelain - whose broken pieces are common on old Swahili town sites, where these fine bowls had been used to decorate mosques, tombs and houses among other purposes - were transhipped at one or more intermediate ports (such as Malacca, Cambay, Oman and Aden). African ivory conversely reached China by stages.\n\nOnly very rarely did actual Chinese ships visit Africa. One famous exception was about 1420 AD, an occasion used by the Sultan of Malindi - one of the principal Swahili states of the time, which probably combined the fair city and palace of Gedi - to send a distinctive gift to the Emperor of China. This ‘celestial animal’, as it was recognised at the other end, has been immortalised on Chinese silk (over).\n\nEarlier Indian Silver Coins\n\nhttps://www.google.co.uk/search?q=silver+rupee&biw=1366&bih=655&tbm=isch&tbo=u&source=univ&sa=X&ei=a3roVNOKOYGN7Qbt7YHIBw&ved=0CEAQsAQ&dpr=1#imgdii=_\n\nCoins of British India\n\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coins_of_British_India\n\nIn 1888 the Imperial British East Africa Company (IBEAC) which was based in Bombay was given a charter by Queen Victoria to trade in East Africa. In penetrating East Africa the IBEAC utilized the laws and personnel of Government of India as well as Indentured Indian Labour. From 1892 onwards the Indian Penal and Civil codes applied, and judicial appeals were heard in the Court of Bombay. Indian commercial laws, the Stamp, Designs, Insolvency acts were adopted and the Indian Rupee was the East African currency until 1920.

Statement Of Significance: Between 1886 and 1895 The Imperial British East Africa Company had administrative rights in East Africa around Zanzibar. In 1887 the Sultan of Zanzibar ceded control over the port of Mombasa to British administration and the company took control. In 1888 it had coins struck by The Mint, Birmingham in terms British Indian rupees and fractions. In 1895 a British Protectorate was proclaimed over all of the companies territories with administration under the British government.

The areas in which the Currency Board operated were Tanganyika, Zanzibar and Pemba, Kenya, Uganda and British Somaliland. Until the advent of the East African Currency Board, the Indian rupee had been the currency of these protectorates, colonies and mandates. The first issue of the East African Currency Board had been preceded by an issue of rupees under the authority of the Government of the East Africa Protectorate in 1905. (The Protectorate consisted of the area now constituting Kenya.) The East African Currency Board issued its first currency in 1920. The initial issue of a 1-rupee note, was followed by an issue of florin notes in the same year and in the following year the first shilling notes were issued.\n\nhttp://www.worldbanknotescoins.com/2010/05/british-east-african-banknotes-100.html\n\n1 Pice (IBEA Coinage)\n\n1306 (1888-1889)\n\nThe Imperial British East Africa Company (IBEAC) set up a trading post in Mombasa in 1885 following the Heligoland-Zanzibar Treaty between Britain and the German Empire. Mombasa was part of the Sultanate of Zanzibar before that but was by no means powerful enough to stop the British and Germans occupying the Swahili coast.

Florin bank notes were in denominations of 1, 5, 10, 20, 50, 100 and 500 florins, with the 10 florins and above also carrying the denomination in pounds (1, 2, 5, 10 and 50). This currency did not last more than six months, so very few banknotes were released.\n\nAfter about six months, in .. 1921, the East African Shilling was introduced to replace the East African Florin. The EA shilling had a value of 20 EA Shillings per British Pound, and it was pegged to the pound. For that reason, all 20 EA Shilling banknotes had dual values, of 20 EA Shillings and 1 pound.
