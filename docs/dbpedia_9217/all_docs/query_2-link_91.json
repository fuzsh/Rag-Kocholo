It also aims to provide an analysis of the extent to which the native populations accepted or ...\n\nUntil the 21st century, Africa remains the only region in the world where there are countries whose currency is derived from the colonial system. Very far from political and geostrategic considerations, the question has always been asked in order to know the effect of this lack of monetary sovereignty on the evolution of economic activity. Therefore, this study investigates the relationship between Colonial coinage and financial development by applying Generalised Method of Moments. The importance of this approach, is to correct heterogeneity and endogeneity problems. The sample consist of 48 African countries data over 10 years. This study findings are like-minded with those of economic literature around the law, finance and endowment theory. They suggest that in sub-Saharan Africa, the quality of nstitutions has a very large influence on access to domestic credit. Moreover, the main enclave for the development of the financial system due to colonial coinage is the sluggish stability of the latter colonial coinage in Africa.\n\nObjective The study aims to investigate coinage activity and other types of historic commercial transactions in Sub-Saharan Africa: What causes impacted the appearance of currencies in some African communities, and how did they do so, for example, during Islam advent and colonization era. Methodology The current study documented several types of coins in Africa, whether commodity currencies or metals, using a Historical-Anthropological technique. Cowry, clothing, beads, salt, and ivory are just a few examples. This research also acknowledged a beneficial and deep Islamic influence on African coinage; this is owing to Islam's widespread trans-Saharan commercial activity, which exposed African communities to many Oriental civilizations and gave birth to numerous political systems across the continent. Research Finding This study, on the other hand, found that European colonization had a detrimental impact on the natural coinage process and trade activities in Africa, because Colonial coins were imposed on Africans to fulfill Imperial purposes and to destroy other kinds of money and trade activities. Application In this light, the current article contributes by stimulating more research into Islamic coinage as an expression of Islamic civilization in Africa. It will also highlight politically motivated agenda to combat Africa's ambitious strife to not only become self-independent politically but also economically by freeing themselves from the chains of the so\n\nPallaver situates German East Africa within the framework of the broader East African region as a way to illuminate the processes of currency standardization in the colonial context. The monetary geography of the region was determined first by the circulation of the rupee and later by Great Britainâ€™s interests to create a common currency for its East African colonies. Pallaver argues that transimperial, international, and regional contexts influenced currency circulation across and within colonies, drawing attention to forms of colonial money and their use by distinct groups, such as African laborers and Indian traders."
