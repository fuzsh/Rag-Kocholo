        "text": "This is a nice clip from Kevin Spacey (i'm looking for the complete version).\n\nhttp://mannerofspeaking.org/2015/04/19/kevin-spaceys-three-key-elements-to-a-compelling-story/\n\nI don't know that film schools are teaching this: the importance of story, and hence the importance of a the screenplay to the whole.\n\nUp-and-coming Filmmakers want to save their bucks for cameras and locations and other production costs, thus putting less emphasis on getting a solid story presented in a well-written screenplay. A well-written screenplay will address a lot of production issues, such as scene transistions, and clear, concise 'instructions' on where the camera and crew need to be, what props need/ought to be in the set/scene, costume, and so on. It costs money and time when these are not clear, and if the story isn't clear.\n\nIf you are not willing to penny up for such an essential piece of the whole, then master screenwriting yourselves BEFORE you consider production. Story is everything ! Actually you should have a pretty good handle on it regardless. Even if you do not plan to write your own stories, you do need to be able to tell the difference between a good script, and a poor one that probably cannot be salvaged no matter how many gadgets you have on set. With today's pulp fiction approach to film, there is a lot of junk out there: bad dialogue, disconnected threads, poor acting and directing, and ruinous editing.\n\nA good story will still be entertaining on a good camera, assuming the rest of production follows suit. An excellent camera isn't going to fix a crappy story, or speed up a poorly written screenplay.\n\n“In order to write scripts, you must first study the great novels and dramas of the world. You must consider why they are great. Where does the emotion come from that you feel as you read them? What degree of passion did the author have to have, what level of meticulousness did he have to command, in order to portray the characters and events as he did? You must read thoroughly, to the point where you can grasp all these things. You must also see the great films. You must read the great screenplays and study the film theories of the great directors. If your goal is to become a film director, you must master screenwriting”. -- Akira Kurosawa\n\n“With a good script a good director can produce a masterpiece; with the same script a mediocre director can make a passable film. But with a bad script even a good director can’t possibly make a good film. For truly cinematic expression, the camera and the microphone must be able to cross both fire and water. That is what makes a real movie. The script must be something that has the power to do this.” -- Akira Kurosawa\n\nMy fave response to date when giving my prices for writing service ...\n\n'What?! You mean I actually have to pay for this?!'\n\nNo, dude, I'm just yanking your chain. I'm sure you don't need to pay for that cup of coffee at the local cafè, either. All free."
