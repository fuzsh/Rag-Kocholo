        "text": "Kurosawa’s success in film springs from his exceptional attention to every step of the process: namely, the script. According to Kurosawa (Something 193),\n\n“With a bad script even a good director can’t possibly make a good film. For truly cinematic expression, the camera and the microphone must be able to cross both fire and water. That is what makes a real movie. The script must be something that has the power to do this.”\n\nSignature Style\n\nKurosawa’s extensive and illustrious career makes it impossible to summarize his work and impact without leaving significant gaps. Still, even a limited selection of his work demonstrates his mastery of storytelling. Kurosawa’s work is a narrative of extremes: the continuous battle between tradition and modernity, class and ambition, East versus West, and humanity’s balance with nature — all culminating in complex moral themes.\n\nKurosawa speaks of his fixation with intense, polarized aspects of human experience, saying, “I am the kind of person who works violently, throwing myself into it. I also like hot summers, cold winters, heavy rains and snows, and I think my pictures show this. I like extremes because I find them most alive” (Prince 11). Fittingly, Prince describes Kurosawa’s work as a “celebration of the extremities of human behavior” expressed through “the staccato, jagged rhythms, of their cutting, and the undermining of a stable visual world through decentered compositions and the foregrounding of characters and camera movement” (Prince 11).\n\nKurosawa is challenging to nail down, having been “labeled as a propagandist, humanist, modernist, conservative and a range of other positions” (Stafford 2). Perhaps this is because he likes to entertain both sides of the coin in his storytelling. Indeed, Prince describes Kurosawa’s wild, emotive work as at once “Dionysian” despite its’ upholding of the warrior class as “a heroic few set apart from society” (Prince 11–12).\n\nCulture, values, modernity, and even nature are thrown continuously into clash, contrast, and harmony in Kurosawa’s artistry. According to Prince, Kurosawa’s body of work is best understood “as a project, as a specific undertaking influenced by an immediate social challenge,” which he describes as the cultural upheaval of World War II (xvii). “His attempt to fashion a cinema engaged with the contradictory demands of his time” (Prince 1?). “Kurosawa’s cinema is a turbulent one, beset by tensions between premodern and modern values, between Eastern and Western traditions, and, stylistically, between flashes of extreme violence and moments of quiet and contemplation. (Prince xvii)”\n\nOne exploration of contrasting cultures is the Western influence on Kurosawa’s films. Prince explains that Kurosawa drew from the American Western in unique ways — instead of merely translating cowboy to samurai as one might assume, he instead drew from elements like movement and framing (16–17). Perhaps he even found resonance with Japanese traditions of nature in the Western’s technique of integrating a figure with a morally symbolic landscape and a character unto itself (Prince 17). Indeed, the integration of landscape and the natural world was essential to Kurosawa. Nature is both beautiful and terrible-the source of peace and the source of destruction.\n\nPerhaps one of the things that makes Kurosawa a great filmmaker was that he gave great attention to content as well as form. While his visual style is not merely a means of visualizing predetermined content, he was committed to using film to influence the world (Prince 36). We see this careful consideration of content from his emphasis on good writing, as he often advised budding filmmakers to practice creating screenplays before anything else (Prince 37). Indeed, Kurosawa was committed to writing from the will of the characters and commonly wrote in cooperation with other screenwriters to strengthen the work and gain additional perspectives (Prince 37–38)\n\nAnalysis of “Rashōmon”\n\nWhile Kurosawa is famous in part for his themes of master-disciple samurai relationships, heroic champions, and Shakespearian tales of violence and revenge, Rashōmon serves as an exemplifier for some of his most iconic ideas of intelligently handled moral issues, extreme contrast in pacing, interplay with nature, and the posing of Japanese tradition with modern and Western influence. Kurosawa wrote his 1950 film Rashōmon inspired by stories by Ryunosuke Akutagawa (Prince 127). It is a prime example of his best artistry and storytelling.\n\nRashōmon opens when three men take refuge in the abandoned Rashōmon city gate amid a drenching of rain. The war, wind, and earthquake have ravaged the city gate and, in some senses, seems to represent society — a construction that protects but struggles to hold in balance with nature and the dark side of humanity. This setting is also where we are introduced to Kurosawa’s use of pacing, which is overall unrushed, evidenced by run times, which often span two and a half or even over three hours. Kurosawa is someone who tells the story in precisely the amount of time he feels is needed — no more, no less. With a run time of only an hour and 28 minutes (short in contrast to his many lengthier films) Rashōmon has tight pacing with intense action and fight scenes, yet still provides moments of silence and even serenity, felt early in scenes in the forest but also at the city gate. Even in moments of stillness, something is always moving, such as in the opening shot where the priest and woodcutters “are sitting motionless, taking shelter under the gate…they stare out at the rain with heads bowed” (Rashōmon 2). The film never feels rushed yet never stagnates. This dilapidated building is the setting where a woodcutter, a priest, and a commoner discuss the story of a recent trial for the alleged rape of Masago and murder of her samurai husband, Takehiro Kanazawa by the bandit Tajomaru.\n\nThe same story is examined first through three accounts at the trial, each of which demonstrates Kurosawa’s intelligence in regards to the moral implications of action, response, and perspective. First, from Tajomaru, who was impressed by Masago’s beauty and ferocity. He claims she fell to his seduction, and then she asked Tajomaru to dual with Kanazawa to save her from shame, a battle he won honorably and skillfully. He presents himself as a mischievous but not an evil seducer.\n\nThe second account comes from Masago, who claims she was raped, but her husband cruelly would not forgive her. Out of sorrow, she asks him to kill her but faints. When she wakes up, she sees he has been stabbed with a dagger. She presents herself as a victim of rape and cruelty without fault. Next, Kanazawa speaks through a medium to tell his side of the story. According to him, Masago agrees to leave with Tajomaru but asks him to kill Kanazawa. Appalled Tajomaru releases Kanazawa after Masago flees. Kanazawa kills himself, portraying himself as a victim of his wife’s immorality.\n\nFinally, back at Rashōmon, the woodcutter Kikori tells his story, the fourth account, which reads as the truest since he is an uninvolved party even though we already know he is a somewhat unreliable narrator, having previously lied about not witnessing the murder. According to Kikori, Tajomaru asks Masago to marry him, but she is loyal to her husband, who she frees. However, when Kanazawa calls Masago a “shameless whore,” she criticizes both him and Tajomaru for being too cowardly to fight for her love (Rashōmon 37). When they do fight, however, she turns away in fear. The fight is far more pathetic than either of the men initially described it, with Tajomaru winning only through luck.\n\nThis level of subjectivity in storytelling was highly innovative at its time as a predecessor to its frequent use in modern film. The narrative structure emphasizes the subjectivity of point of view and yet does not fall prey to meaninglessness. While Rashōmon could be construed as highly deconstructionist and existential, the film ultimately demands we rise above selfishness to be true, at least to ourselves. This is the moral core that Kurosawa intelligently communicates by presenting us with the terrible scenarios that happen when humans give up on truth and goodness. Tajomaru claims he has nothing to lose, and so is honest, but we later see it proven that even he lies, at least to himself, for his own satisfaction if not to defend social standing.\n\nThe moral message has already been constructed in the mind of the viewer by the time the characters hash it out in dialogue at the end of the film. The priest laments the false narratives at the trial, saying, “Men are so weak. That’s why they lie. That’s why they must deceive themselves” (Rashōmon 23). The Commoner recognizes and confirms the evil in the world when he says of the trial, “Stories like this are ordinary enough now. I heard that demons used to live in the castle here by the gate, but they all ran away, because what men do now horrified them so” (Rashōmon 35). And yet, he accepts this as just the way things are. Kurosawa positions the Commoner as the devil’s advocate for his tale of moral honesty, who says, “Who’s honest nowadays? Look, everyone wants to forget unpleasant things, so they make up stories. It’s easier that way” (Rashōmon 28). The issues of morality are hashed out in a natural way that presents the problem and lets the characters respond according to their established personalities.\n\nIt is at the end of the film that Kurosawa’s telling diverges most from the story upon which it is based. Upon finding a crying baby, the Commoner takes its clothes. The priest and woodcutter are appalled by this final proof of the depravity of humankind. According to Japanese cinema scholar Donald Richie’s analysis, “if Kurosawa has a spokesman in the film it is probably the priest: weak, confused, but ultimately trusting” (4). The story only redeemed when the woodcutter takes responsibility for caring for the child, of which the priest says, “thanks to you, I will be able to keep my faith in men” (Rashōmon 47). Richie correctly observes Kurosawa’s nuanced approach to moral issues, writing that Kurosawa is “Neither anarchist nor misanthrope, he insists upon hope, upon the possibility of gratuitous action” (4). Kurosawa’s hope is hard-fought but exists nonetheless.\n\nOverall, Kurosawa’s dialogue is sparse, leaving room for visual storytelling. Prince calls this “an experiment in recovering the aesthetics of silent cinema” (32). Indeed, many scenes go a long time with no dialogue, telling the story visually. Much of the visual impact of his films comes from the natural world. The manner in which Kurosawa wrote his screenplay settings is more than aesthetically significant, but instead he uses the natural world to inform his storytelling. Prince explains that the symbolic structure of Rashōmon is built around weather and seasons (Prince 17). This is a testament to Kurosawa’s influence by Japanese tradition, “each of the seasons had its own affective properties, where the performance of particular Noh plays was correlated with appropriate seasons, and where one of the rules of a good haiku composition was that it contain a seasonal reference” (Prince 17). In Rashōmon, the devastation and all-consuming power of nature shows up when the men must run to shelter from the pouring rain and yet the environment has already devastated Rashōmon so that it feels as though it barely holds, as if one more gust of wind, let alone earthquake, will fell the structure. And yet, nature in the film is also a source of beauty, such as the glinting sun and the dappled light as Tajomaru sits in the forest. The use of the natural world was striking, as a New York Times reviewer at the time of release described the “deft use of forest light and shade to achieve a variety of powerful and delicate pictorial effects” (Prince 127).\n\nKurosawa’s influence from traditional Japanese culture shows not only through his use of nature but in his inspiration from traditional plays, as he describes, “One can use the Noh play with its three-part structure: jo (introduction), ha (destruction) and kyu (haste). If you devote yourself fully to Noh and gain something good from this, it will emerge naturally in your films” (195). In the traditional Noh structure, events begin slowly, speed up, and then end quickly. This structure translates in Rashōmon with the gradual introduction of the characters, jo, which intensifies with each telling of the crime, ha, culminating in the climactic scene where the men discover the baby, kyu.\n\nAnother hallmark of Kurosawa’s work is his continuous contrast of tradition vs. rebellion occurs in the way Kurosawa wrote the character Masago to explore his moral theme with a deft balancing of social norms with a depth of character. He recognizes the ways in which society subjugates women yet refuses to infantilize them. Kurosawa takes on traditional standards of gender and sexuality when Masago says, “But, how could I answer? How could I, a woman, answer a question like that?” (Rashōmon 37) This seems submissive without the context of the surrounding description, which implies these lines should be read with the actor “in possession of herself” and then grabbing the dagger to free her husband and force him and Tajomaru to fight for her (36–37). She is no more saintly or evil than her male counterparts, portrayed as a player in shaping her own destiny even when society or moral failing constrains the extent to which her efforts for self-actualization are effective.\n\nKurosawa’s films are a constant act of both looking back and looking forward in that he often draws from old influences from silent film and Shakespeare to Noh theatre and ancient Japanese aristocracy and brings them to new light with new ideas and relevancy. In Rashōmon Kurosawa’s fixation with contrasting tradition vs. modernity is more subtle than some of his other films but present nonetheless. Stylistically, Kurosawa says he employed the technique of simplification from modern art for Rashōmon (Richie 18). Rashōmon has a feeling of minimalism with simple, limited locations. It feels like a large, complicated story in a small, simple world.\n\nPerhaps more significant than stylistic tension between tradition vs. modernity is the way moral issues and character actions are handled. In a Film Philosophy article, Robert Castle asserts, “the burden for mankind, symbolized by the child, resides in a new order of life that shakes the foundations of civilization.” The baby received by the woodcutter beckons the potential for societal change and growth. What is being cast off to usher this new growth? Feudalism, perhaps. Despite its setting in the Heian period, Richie argues, “Kurosawa is presenting an indictment of feudal remnants” (Richie 13). Indeed, the narrative is set apart from typical Japanese historical film “in that it questions while they reaffirm; it is realistic, while they are romantic; it is using its period as a pretext and a decoration while the ordinary period film aims at simple reconstruction” (Richie 18).\n\nThese modern ideas in the context of a historical film reach even farther. Richie believes that the core ideas of the story are Western rather than Japanese in the way the film takes an analytical approach in the way it “questions reality yet champions hope” (20). According to Professor Mike Sugimoto’s research on Rashōmon, the film can be viewed as an allegory for post-war Japan: “The central issue — who did it — while key, must also be seen in light of the greater social context of the times…Seen in this light, the problem of memory in the film is a direct reflection of a defeated nation coming to terms (or not) with the question of culpability” (26). The story transcends time and culture because it takes a critical eye to the writers’ own context, thus constructing value outside of specificity.\n\nBy studying Kurosawa’s screenwriting techniques, we can gain a greater appreciation for the basis of his success. He clearly wrote with a full vision, as we see in Rashōmon, the script itself is highly detailed with notes that imply camera focal lengths and even editing choices, and yet the story is always primary. One of the greatest filmmakers of all time has given us the secret to success: according to Kurosawa (139),\n\n“You must read the great screenplays and study the film theories of the great directors. If your goal is to become a film director, you must master screenwriting.”\n\nWhether in pacing and structure or nuanced storytelling and inventive reinterpretations of influences, Kurosawa’s screenplays offer exemplification of the best techniques of film.\n\nWorks Cited\n\nCastle, Robert. “The Radical Capability of Rashōmon.” Film-Philosophy 7.5, Soviet and Asian Cinemas, 5 September, 2003.
