        "text": "Shinobu Hashimoto, a screenwriter whose first film, “Rashomon,” became a touchstone of world cinema, and who went on to collaborate with its director, Akira Kurosawa, on celebrated pictures like “Ikiru” and “Seven Samurai,” died on Thursday at his home in Tokyo. He was 100.\n\nHis death, of pneumonia, was confirmed by Tomo Tran of Vertical Inc., the United States publisher of his memoir, “Compound Cinematics: Akira Kurosawa and I.”\n\nMr. Hashimoto, who had previously worked as an accountant, was the last living member of the cadre of screenwriters around Kurosawa (1910-98). Because Kurosawa liked his screenplays to be written collaboratively, all of Mr. Hashimoto’s work for him was done with others, including Hideo Oguni, Ryuzo Kikushima and Kurosawa himself.\n\nOf the writers in Kurosawa’s stable, Mr. Hashimoto was among the longest-serving, contributing to eight screenplays from 1950 to 1970. Their other pictures together include “Throne of Blood” (1957), a reworking of “Macbeth” set in feudal Japan; “The Hidden Fortress” (1958), an adventure film about a princess escorted in disguise through enemy territory; and “Dodes’ka-den” (1970), about the residents of a Tokyo slum."
