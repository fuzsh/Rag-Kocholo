        "text": "Akira Kurosawa and Hollywood may find themselves working together soon for the first time since the late director's abortive involvement in the war epic Tora! Tora! Tora!, one of several traumatic episodes that led him to attempt suicide in 1972. The remake rights to the lion's share of his movies and unproduced screenplays have been granted by the Akira Kurosawa 100 Project to the Los Angeles-based company Splendent, whose chief, Sakiko Yamada, told Variety he aimed to \"help contemporary film-makers introduce a new generation of moviegoers to these unforgettable stories\". The Kurosawa Project said it had received \"countless\" requests from US and European film-makers, \"expressing intense interest in remaking Kurosawa's movies\".\n\nThe prospect of Kurosawa's influence being funnelled through Hollywood again is enticing; after all, the last time Hollywood directors paid sustained attention to his films, they helped revolutionise Hollywood film-making.\n\nTwo Kurosawa remakes were particularly important: John Sturges's The Magnificent Seven and Sergio Leone's A Fistful of Dollars, deriving from Seven Samurai (1954) and Yojimbo (1961) respectively. The former, passing directly from Japan to Los Angeles, produced one smash hit, offered a narrative template for movies as diverse as The Dirty Dozen and Ocean's Eleven, spawned three lesser sequels and a naff TV series, while inadvertently foretelling in metaphor America's looming military entanglements in south-east Asia (minus the then-inconceivable defeat). The latter revolutionised the moribund American western, changing ideas about violence and the hero's morality, supercharging the work of the likes of Sam Peckinpah and Walter Hill, and handing the genre a new two-for-one Ford/Wayne in Clint Eastwood, director and western icon combined. The brazenness of Leone's rehash, however, prompted a letter from Kurosawa saying, accurately enough: \"A Fistful of Dollars is a very fine film, but it's my film,\" and a lawsuit, later settled out of court.\n\nMeanwhile, the first film-school-educated generation of young directors was absorbing the Emperor's work, and savouring it with an aesthetic as well as a professional palate. John Milius, a Kurosawa fanatic who quoted Hidden Fortress in his The Wind and the Lion, introduced George Lucas to the same movie, which offered him the skeletal outline and epic scope of Star Wars, and the samurai archetype looms large in the scripts and movies of Paul Schrader.\n\nThe new generation paid frequent homage to Kurosawa within their movies but also, more importantly, without, once their own success had been assured. Steven Spielberg cast Toshiro Mifune, very much in type, in 1941, and Martin Scorsese played Vincent Van Gogh in Kurosawa's Dreams – with effects by Industrial Light and Magic. Lucas and Francis Ford Coppola went a stage further in 1980 by persuading 20th Century Fox to cover a shortfall in Kagemusha's budget in exchange for international distribution rights.\n\nBut cultural exchange is a two-way, if not a nine-way street. Let's not forget Kurosawa was, even early in his career, by far the most westernised of Japanese directors, a lover of Lubitsch, Chaplin and Ford, and was often scorned for it in Japan, both by jingoistic war-nostalgists and by the westernised Marxist generation of Japanese film-makers bringing up the rear. He was a voracious consumer of western movies and literature, and the literary sources for his movies range from Gorky (The Lower Depths), Dostoyevsky (The Idiot), and Shakespeare (Throne of Blood, Ran) to Georges Simenon (Stray Dog), Ed McBain (High and Low) and Dashiell Hammett (Yojimbo).\n\nOutside the parameters of the Kurosawa Project/Splendent deal, four other Kurosawa remakes are already in the pipeline, including a Weinstein Company remake of the Seven Samurai set in Thailand, proving the hunger for Kurosawa remakes cited by Project 100 is real, at least for film-makers, and that Kurosawa-based cultural exchange maintains its steady, mutually enriching ebb-and-flow."
