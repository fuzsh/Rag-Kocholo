        "text": "Three months ago, it was reported that Chinese entertainment company Huayi Brothers (Mojin: The Lost Legend, Dragon Blade) announced the production of The Mask of the Black Death, an upcoming film based on a script by one of the most important and influential filmmakers in the history of cinema, Akira Kurosawa (Seven Samurai, The Hidden Fortress).\n\nNow, another never-before-filmed Kurosawa screenplay, Silvering Spear, has been acquired by Jinke Entertainment from Kurosawa Production Co. for a big screen adaptation. The film will be the first of nine, un-filmed screenplays purchased by Jinke.\n\nAccording to THR,“Silvering Spear tells the story of a samurai named Ishigaki Jyube who demonstrates remarkable marksmanship while living during the Warring States period, a turbulent time in Japan’s history. Ishigaki Jyube searches for a way to utilize his special talents, while not exploiting them for personal gain.”\n\nSilvering Spear is scheduled to shoot next year. Stay tuned for details.\n\nDisclaimer: cityonfire.com does not own any of the photos contained in the blog. cityonfire.com was made merely to pay homage to these films, directors, talent, etc. and not for any profit or commercial reasons.
