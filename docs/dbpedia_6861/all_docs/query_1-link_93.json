        "text": "Kurosawa, who died in 1998, is still the undisputed king of samurai movies. With movies such as Yojimbo, Hidden Fortress, and Rashomon, he not only transformed the samurai subgenre, but also the art of filmmaking as a whole. His innovative techniques, such as his use of axial cuts (a technique in which the camera makes a series of cuts toward or away from the subject, giving the illusion of continuity), helped distinguish him from other respected filmmakers of the post-war era. His influence was global. Hollywood titans such as Steven Spielberg, Brian De Palma, and Martin Scorsese are all devotees of Kurosawa and his methods. So is George Lucas, which is why echoes of Kurosawa’s work can be seen throughout the Star Wars trilogy, in everything from the costumes to the famous wipe transitions between scenes.\n\nGiven his monumental success, it should come as no surprise that Kurosawa was a stickler for details. For example, while making Seven Samurai (which, like Yojimbo and Rashomon, was remade into a popular Western), Kurosawa tasked his prop department with finding a way to make a river flow in the opposite direction (and they did). For his film Red Beard, Kurosawa had a production assistant pour 1,000 cups of tea into the same cup in order to give it the perfect well-worn aesthetic. Yet, despite all of his fastidiousness, there was at least one occasion when a scene didn’t unfold exactly how Kurosawa planned. And it turned out to be one of his most influential.\n\nRelated: The 5 Movies That Gave Us ‘Star Wars’\n\nWhen Kurosawa finally called cut, the prop department expected to get an earful. But Kurosawa made no complaints. In fact, he thought the extra blood only made the scene better and decided to keep it. Audiences seemed to enjoy the blood, too, and Kurosawa realized that he was onto something.\n\nFrom then on, outlandish amounts of blood was a hallmark of his films and became a style embraced by filmmakers spanning countries, generations, and genres. Indeed, had it not been for Kurosawa and that malfunctioning hose, movie lovers would never have had the pleasure of watching Jamie Foxx’s Django lay waste to members of the KKK, or Leonardo DiCaprio’s Rick Dalton incinerate some of the Manson family with a flamethrower, or Uma Thurman’s Black Mamba hack her way through an army of assassins.\n\nRead Next: Listen: Nolan’s ‘Dunkirk’ Is Full of Auditory Easter Eggs That Build Tension"
