        "text": "Note: We're reposting this article on collecting film scripts in light of the growing difficulty in acquiring copies of classic mid-century films and movie studio's reluctance to make classics available for exhibition. It was originally published in August 2019.\n\nAccording to a great many people, the film (or movie, if you prefer) was the great art form of the 20th century, so it shouldn’t be any great surprise that there is a large number of collectors — individual and institutional — focused on the movie business; but it might surprise many to learn that there’s great interest in collecting the seemingly least-glamorous part of the entire filmmaking process — the scripts themselves.\n\nCollecting scripts is different from collecting many other forms of printed matter, as scripts were not mass-produced (excepting the relatively recent trade-paperback editions of hit films) or made available for sale to the general public. Scripts were typed out and mimeographed; changes were printed on different colored pages and the earlier pages thrown away; scripts went through innumerable drafts, and sometimes several sets of writers; and all that before the production technicians and artists got hold of the \"finished\" script and began annotating it for their own purposes. There are therefore multiple different types of script and an entire language of shorthand to decipher when evaluating a script manuscript. Different eras and areas of production had their own conventions and practices, so the field is one that requires a great deal of specialized knowledge to navigate successfully.\n\nABAA-member Kevin R. Johnson has been specializing in film scripts since about 2004, and has recently collected some of his knowledge in a book. The Celluloid Paper Trail: Identification and Description of Twentieth Century Film Scripts has been published by Oak Knoll Press (the publishing arm of ABAA-member Oak Knoll Books) and is a guide to the conventions of script-writing, the different stages a script might go through, and the different forms of scripts — produced and unproduced — that one might encounter in the market. It’s an essential reference book for collectors of film scripts, and an entertaining read for those who enjoy learning more about the golden age of Hollywood.\n\nFor a taste of Johnson’s book, you can read the introduction by Tony Bill and Johnson’s preface here…\n\nJohnson recently gave an interview where he introduced the book and discussed some of the key issues in determining the desirability of a script: artifactual value and content value. Read this interview…\n\nYou can buy the book directly from the author, or from his publisher's website.\n\nFeatured items:\n\nScreenplay for The Thin Man Sequel (Original screenplay, Hammett's copy, with holograph correction)\n\nby Dashiell Hammett\n\nBeverly Hills, CA: Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer [MGM], 1935. Dashiell Hammett's original submitted Treatment script for the first sequel to \"The Thin Man,\" here referred to only as \"Thin Man Sequel,\" and ultimately titled \"After the Thin Man.\" With a single holograph correction by Hammett, and letter of provenance from Hammett's daughter Josephine Hammett Marshall regarding the discovery of the treatment in the family's estate. The first \"Thin Man\" film, released in 1934 and based on Hammett's novel, was a smash hit and is today a key film in the American screwball comedy cycle. Five sequels were made between 1936 and 1947 (all starring the original acting team of William Powell and Myrna Loy), and this previously unknown attempt at a sequel by Hammett was clearly commissioned by MGM but never produced, making this script an entire unpublished Hammett work. The story is a completely original one, never reworked for the other films, very much written in Hammett's trademark style and reading a bit more like a story treatment (i.e., a novel) than a final screenplay, which is likely as far as the story got on the road to production. The piece is dated Sept. 17, 1935 at the lower right corner of the front panel, along with Hammett's name, and Hammett's name is noted in pencil next to the title label (though not in Hammett's hand). There is only one single-word correction to the entire text, at page 83 in Hammett's hand, where the word \"compact\" is replaced with \"cigarette case.\" Accompanying the screenplay is a typed letter signed from Hammett's daughter (who edited a recently published collection of Hammett's letters), on her personal stationery, stating that the screenplay was discovered by Hammett's wife in 1980, and that it had been a part of the family's estate until that time. Probably one of only 2-3 copies that could have been produced, and very possibly the only copy extant. To our knowledge, no other copy of this story, in any form, has ever been recorded at auction or sold on the market. Light blue titled wrappers, with the white MGM studio label present, holograph pencil notation of Hammett's name (secretarial), rubber-stamped COMPLETE, dated September 17, 1935, with a single credit for Hammett. 115 leaves, mimeograph. Pages and wrapper Very Good plus, bound with two gold brads. In a custom clamshell box. Full pagination available upon request.\n\nOffered by Royal Books.\n\n[An Archive of Script Material Relating to:] SINCE YOU WENT AWAY\n\nby [WILDER, MARGARET BUELL (SOURCE WORK)]: DANIEL, JEFFREY (PSEUDONYM OF DAVID O.

Eight items mimeographed typescript, printed on rectos only, one item pictorial wrappers. Modest use to a few wrappers, a bit of rust to a few brads, but generally very good to near fine. An interesting lot of material relating to Selznick's 1944 multi-award nominated film adaptation of, and elaboration on, Wilder's epistolary novel about the Home Front, SINCE YOU WENT AWAY: LETTERS TO A SOLDIER FROM HIS WIFE. The film was directed by John Cromwell and Selznick, and starred Claudette Colbert, Jennifer Jones, Joseph Cotten, Shirley Temple, Monty Woolley, Lionel Barrymore and an enormous supporting cast. As originally released in 1944, the film had a running time of 172 minutes; it was recut and re-released in 1949 with a running time of 130 minutes. This archive traces both the original version and the abbreviated version, and includes the following items: a) SINCE YOU WENT AWAY PART II. 9 April 1943, 82 leaves, a portion of an abstract or synopsis of the book evidently for use by the writer; b) a \"Narrative Synopsis of Screenplay,\" 7 September 1943, [1],58 leaves; c) a doorstop of a \"Final Shooting Script,\" 9 September 1943 - January 1944, credited to Jeffrey Daniel - a nome de plume for Selznick which he finally rejected in favor of \"By the Producer\" - an astonishing [2],290 leaves, plus lettered inserts, and exhibiting a rainbow of mimeo, carbon and original typescript dated revises on colored stocks at a virtual 1:1 ratio to unrevised leaves; d) 28 leaves of \"Retakes / Added Scenes / Wild Lines,\" 12 April 1944; e & f) \"Cutting Continuity\" and \"Dialogue Continuity\" for \"Foreign Version, both 20 September 1946, foliated in reel format; g) a \"Dialogue & Cutting Continuity,\" March 1949, clearly the recut version; h) a \"Spotting List for Recut Version,\" 22 August 1949, [2],62 leaves; and finally, i) a copy of the illustrated souvenir program for the original release.
