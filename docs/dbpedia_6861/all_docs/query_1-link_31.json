        "text": "Akira Kurosawa‘s framings have magic. His storyboarding work is magnificent.\n\nSometimes though, the Master’s decisions come from very down to earth motives. In his book Making Movies, Sidney Lumet says: ” I once asked Akira Kurosawa why he had chosen to frame a shot in Ran in a particular way. His answer was that if he’d panned the camera one inch to the left, the Sony factory would be sitting there exposed, and if he’d panned one inch to the right, we would see the airport, neither of which belonged in a period movie.”\n\nLet’s have a look at Akira Kurosawa’s masterwork. For that, we should visit Every Frame a Painting. With Robert Altman and Sidney Lumet as special guests.\n\nMORE ON KUROSAWA?
