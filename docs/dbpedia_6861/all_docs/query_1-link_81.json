        "text": "Under the protective archway of his family home, a young boy stands perplexed just before a heavy rainstorm while his mother dutifully collects various items outside, now wet from the downpour. The boy ponders the weather, a strange collision of sunshine and rain showers, with light shimmering through every droplet. It’s clear he wants to go outside, however, his mother warns him not to; that “foxes hold weddings on days like this” and “they hate it if anybody watches.”\n\nThis is the beginning of the first segment of Akira Kurosawa’s Dreams, a collection of eight distinct, yet kindred short films that portray various dreams of the late Japanese director.\n\nReleased in 1990, Dreams was the first film written solely by Kurosawa in forty-five years and acts as a recounting of the director’s most formative memories told through a cinematic lens. Encased in fantastical, oftentimes prophetic, narratives - from child to man, peach trees to nuclear holocaust - the films reflect a fertile slurry of nostalgia and retrospection; enabling Kurosawa to reflect on his life and legacy and reflect on the experiences that have since resurfaced as subconscious visions [dreams].\n\nThis article will attempt to discern those experiences and explore how Kurosawa projects the depths of his psyche in order to meditate, and comment, on contemporary issues, personal woes and prescient viewpoints. How, through experimentation and imagination, Kurosawa establishes a series of modern fables - allegorical and symbolic - that interweave to form a rich tapestry of universal musings and introspective narratives.\n\nCall to Adventure\n\nThe first segment of the film, “Sunshine Through the Rain”, is a fantastical interpretation of Kurosawa’s childhood memories of being told stories by his mother. Stories of legend, stories of truth - fables and folklore - presented via magical imagery and theatrical composition. “It’s an odd belief [in Japan] that if it’s sunny but raining, the foxes are having a wedding” insists Teruyo Nogami, Kurosawa’s longtime Production Manager, in an interview with Criterion for the 2016 Blu-ray release of Dreams. While not from the motherly standpoint, Nogami’s statement informs the nature of this piece: A sentimental depiction of the lessons and stories told to a child as to keep them from harm. In this sense “Sunshine” is affiliated particularly with the Japanese, who celebrate deep respect for the fox - kitsune - and regard them as “an important part in [...] animal lore”, linked with “fertility and death”, and who acts as a direct “messenger of Inari, the beneficent god of rice, harvest, and fecundity”, as explored by film scholar, Zvika Serper in his essay, Kurosawa’s Dreams: A Cinematic Reflection of a Traditional Japanese Context. Serper goes on to write that “the mere mention of the word “fox” to [the Japanese] evokes many connotations, and its appearance immediately stimulates the imagination”. This preconceived magical notion of the fox bolsters the curiosity of the boy, who, aptly called “I”, acts as the personification of Kurosawa’s child self. This intrinsic connection between Japanese folklore and Kurosawa exposes the inherent autobiographical lens of Dreams, which the director insists in Nobuhiko Ôbayashi’s seminal companion documentary, Making of “Dreams” (1990), is “[his] own story. It’s about [his] childhood.” This is reinforced not only by Toshihiko Nakano’s performance as “I”, which Kurosawa himself helped construct, but also the film’s opening archway - a replica of the director’s childhood home with his family name even etched on its plate: “It looked like the house I lived in as a child. In Koishikawa” (Ôbayashi, 1990).\n\nSpurred by curiosity, “I” - Kurosawa’s youth incarnate - travels to a nearby wood, with trees as tall as mountains and hazy wisps of rain that glisten through the sun’s rays. He hides tentatively behind a mammoth tree and bears witness to a procession of strange humanoid creatures, all dressed up in beautiful wedding attire and glossed in vivid make-up. Journalist, Bilge Ebiri notes, in his essay Quiet Devastation, that the humanoid figures are the titular foxes, “made up of humans with elaborate makeup and fake whiskers.” Yet “they don’t look anything like foxes but are rather stylised depictions of foxes, as might be seen in traditional theater or folk celebrations.” Ebiri cites Serper, by suggesting that the presentation of the foxes comes from Noh theatre: a form of classical Japanese dance-drama which generally consists of a troupe of performers utilising highly stylised movement, dancelike choreography, props and costumes to tell a story. This can be seen when the procession, accompanied by a traditional Japanese score by Shin’ichirō Ikebe, moves past “I”, who watches passively from the tree. Moreover, Ebiri notes that “I”’s passivity might come from Noh theatre as well, citing that “In most of the plays, a waki… usually a traveller, visits a famous place where he encounters a local inhabitant, the shite… and asks to be told a story associated with the place.” While “I” does not ask his mother to tell him a story, she does so anyway and thus manifests “I” as somewhat of a passive observer, listening to the secrets of the associated place as the manifestation of the traveller. She tells of the Fox Wedding [Kitsune no Yomeiri]: a mythical phenomenon told in classical Japanese kaidan [“ghost stories”] with hazy lighting, fog-like showers, traditional Japanese instruments and otherworldly entities as typified by the foxes. The connections between Dreams and Noh theatre are undeniable and continue throughout the film, with every version of “I” venturing to hear a new story. This thereby cements the artform as a huge influence on Kurosawa, and in doing so, reinforces the recollective aspect of the film, with Noh being the oldest major theatre art that is still regularly performed.\n\n“I” stares too long and the procession quickly stops to a halt after sniffing out their young observer. He runs home only for his mother to place a knife into his hands and to tell him that he must seek out the foxes and ask for their forgiveness or perform seppuku - a ritual suicide - in their presence. Thus, with fear abound, “I” travels to a nearby field strewn with flowers of endless variety and walks nervously into a rainbow - where his mother says the foxes make their homes. This is what writer Joseph Campell, in his book The Hero with a Thousand Faces, would describe as the “call to adventure”, a “mythological hero, setting forth from his common-day hut or castle, [lured], carried away, or voluntarily [proceeding], to the threshold of adventure.” “I”, after witnessing the elusive fox wedding, is now lured under the segment’s second archway - the rainbow (the threshold of adventure) - and into the dream world, either to save himself or die trying. These are of course reflective of the hero’s journey to find enlightenment: the treasure in which Campbell purports to be the be-all and end-all of everything. Echoed throughout almost every story - myth or religion-based - the hero must venture the confines of the self to attain, what would be described in Zen Buddhism as the truth that all human beings are Buddha (God). Therefore, it is Kurosawa, as “I”, who walks tentatively towards adventure, and through memory and reflection should return a hero “with the “Ultimate Boon” (self-enlightenment) at his dispersal. We are simply along for the ride.\n\nDreams\n\nBack to Dreams: Kurosawa’s legacy piece. A piece that is so personal, so reflective, and so meticulously Japanese that to recapture its essence would require an assimilated understanding of the very essence of the director himself.\n\nAfter “I”’s opening adventure in the first segment, we move to a very similar setting, a family home, with our hero slightly older, and played by Mitsunori Isaki, in “The Peach Orchard”: a tale about loss and life, in equal measure.\n\nTaking six plates of treats to his sister and her friends sitting playfully in an adjacent room, clearly embodiments of Kurosawa’s three real-life sisters, “I” steps up to a display of some dolls that seem purposefully reminiscent of those seen during hina matsuri (the Dolls’ Festival, otherwise known as the Peach Festival, momo no sekku). The festival, according to Serper, is “one of the very few occasions when little Japanese girls have parties at which they and their girlfriends partake of sweets and food offered to the dolls [...] symbols of divine purification.” This can be seen in their floral wear, with bright colours and fertile hues of yellow, pink and green - their doll-like perfection only matched by the aforementioned hina dolls. “I” turns and asks where the sixth girl is, that he was sure he saw six people in the room and as such, he brought six dishes. His sister rebuts his observation, claiming that there was never a sixth person and that “I” must be sick. This reflects another aspect of Kurosawa’s childhood; claiming in his 1981 memoir, Something Like an Autobiography, that “as a young boy, he was so silent and inert, so uncomprehending of all that was occurring around him [...] that his family feared he might be mentally disabled” as cited by Ebiri. This is further inferred by the passive performance of Nakano in the previous segment, yet arguably, through Isaki’s hysteria, becomes fully realised here.\n\nA young girl - dressed in pink and with traditional bells dangling from her wear - appears before “I”. Seemingly invisible to everyone but “I”, She runs off and he follows, desperate to understand the apparition.\n\nAgain, “The Peach Orchard”, much like “Sunshine”, is undeniably autobiographical, yet told via magical allegory. It depicts the inability of children to act upon tragedy and the confounding notions of death and loss at such a young age. One of Kurosawa’s younger sisters, Momoyo, in real life, died very young and abruptly when he was a child. In his memoir, he recalls playing with Hina dolls with that sister “who died suddenly in fourth grade - as if touched by a swift, evil wind!” It could be argued that the young girl at the beginning, who leads “I” out to the desecrated peach orchard, is the embodiment of this sister. Thereby making the encapsulating parable a childlike representation of the difficulty of accepting mortality as finite and letting go of those who, as Takashi Koizumi - Kurosawa’s long-time assistant director - confirms, the director was very fond of. This is reflected by the tale’s final image, which shows the reality of the dead orchard, in which all but one cherry blossom tree is cut down and flowerless. It can be ascertained that the remaining tree is symbolic of the lingering memory of Kurosawa’s beloved sister, and the dancing spirits - magical embodiments of the hina dolls they used to play with. Additionally, Koizumi continues in, an interview with Criterion, to illustrate the importance of Momoyo in this piece by elaborating that “In her posthumous Buddhist name [in Zen Buddhism a name is given to those deceased as to prevent them from returning to the mortal realm] they used the characters for “peach orchard”.” Positioned in the same spot as the girl only moments earlier in the film, it’s no doubt that the remaining cherry blossom represents Kurosawa’s dead sister and the entire affair reflects his childhood handling of her death. In returning to Serper who cites film scholar, Tsuzuki Masaaki’s, interpretation that “the whole episode [is] the chinkon [repose of souls] of this sister”, Kurosawa utilizes his understanding of the Japanese Shinto religion to symbolically put Momoyo to rest; taking his guilt, his childhood misunderstandings of death and his spiritual modes of acceptance; resurrecting and immortalising her through film and performance.\n\nKurosawa was no stranger to suicide, attempting it himself in 1971 due to his failing eyesight and gall stones but more greatly due to the financial failure of his recent films and their declining cultural relevance. Thus, it wouldn’t be too farfetched to relate the blinding snowstorm as reflective of his loss of sight, and the mountaineer’s slow movement as that of the fall into depression, which is known to cause psychomotor retardation: a visible slowing of physical and emotional reactions. This is further reflected in the film’s following hurdle, which comes after “I” seemingly gives up, falling in with his companions and finding comfort in the cold snow. A woman, clad in a white, snow-like gown, seems to float down from the heavens, a kindly smile on her face and singing a serene, yet haunting song. She caresses “I” who appears at peace with his decision to fall, gently enveloping him with long strands of her sparkling hair. “The snow is warm”, she says, “The ice is hot”. The woman could be considered not only symbolic of the tragic fate of many mountaineers, who wonder lost amid deep snow, losing their minds in thinking that they will be safe and warm beneath it, but also of the pull to suicide; the echoing thought that drives many to believe that to give up is so much easier than the pain of going on. This reiterates Kurosawa’s attempted suicide, who after the strife of losing his perceived relevancy thought to throw it all away in death. Yet, it also echoes another painful memory for Kurosawa, that of his brother, Heigo, “a narrator (benshi or katsuben) in silent movies” who committed suicide at the age of twenty-seven “after talkies [talking pictures] put an end to his artistic career.” Kurosawa admits in his memoir that his brother’s death changed the way he saw the world and that losing him remains, as coined by the chapter in his autobiography, “A Story I Don’t Want To Tell” (Kurosawa, 1981).\n\n“I” stands at the opening of a large tunnel all clad in military uniform. He depicts a soldier on his way back from war, an experience which Kurosawa himself never truly shouldered after he was turned away from his army physical during World War Two (he would later be conscripted too late and thus never fought in the Imperial Japanese Army).\n\nAfter a few steps, a hostile dog comes bounding out of the tunnel, like “I” dressed in military wear - anti-tank gear - carrying explosives and barking wildly. Tentative yet determined, “I” continues into the tunnel and out to the other side, with the setting suddenly changing from night to day as if to give the impression of falling into a dream. On the night side, “I” hears an echoing from within the tunnel and out from its transitory confines marches a soldier, painted pale blue and carrying a rifle. With blackened eyes, it becomes apparent that this soldier, Noguchi, is dead; a walking reminder of the young men lost in WW2. Noguchi points towards a light on the hillside - his home - in the distance and recalls a story of him returning to see his parents: “I went home. I ate the special cakes my mother made for me. I remember it well.” “I” confirms that he’s heard this story before, from Noguchi himself, as the soldier lay dying in his arms, only the latter can’t remember it. It seems that as “I” has crossed the lengths of the tunnel - a symbolic crossing of the mortal realm - so have the tragic memories of his time at war.\n\nIn “The Tunnel”, Kurosawa laments the “stupidity of war”; exploring the last woes of a dead platoon unable to come to terms with their recent demise, and the meaninglessness of their sacrifice. After a few moments, Noguchi is sent off back into the tunnel only to be joined by the rest of his battalion, all of whom perished under the orders of “I”. In this, Kurosawa exposes perhaps the personal guilt he felt due to his inability to go to war, his rejection of the less-than-considerate lengths at which the Imperial Japanese Army implemented to protect and conserve the lives of their soldiers, and more intrinsically his overall contempt for the act of war itself: “I could blame it all on the absurdity of war, or the inhumanity of the military. But to deny my own mistakes and indecisiveness would be cowardly.” This sentiment reflects all of the above yet also brings into question Kurosawa’s criticism of the way the Japanese Government handled the last years of the war; with civil unrest abound and over two million military deaths suffered. While unable to fight, Kurosawa embodies both his personal remorse and that of the Military Generals, who chose to continue fighting after enduring terrible losses. Noguchi and company epitomise the attitude that an abundance of youth - lives just beginning - were wasted in fighting WW2. Young men and women dragged off to fight a losing war for the honour of a country and the very Japanese idea that to die in battle is a worthy death. Kurosawa completes this epithet when “I” states in the film’s closing moments that “To die in battle is to die like a dog,” framing the narrative with the barking dog running back out of the tunnel, now seemingly wounded and in a battle-fueled-frenzy.\n\nAdditionally, it would be remiss not to mention that Ishiro Honda - Kurosawa’s assistant director on Dreams (and the director of the original Godzilla, 1954) - was successfully conscripted in the war and thus took on a more hands-on approach with this segment, teaching the soldiers how to march, how to stand and how to hold their rifles like true Japanese soldiers. Honda, Kurosawa’s “most trusted friend” who Koizumu affirms “having around put [the director] at ease”, helps send off these soldiers, these symbols of anti-war, back into the tunnel and to sleep. To be at peace finally, and to symbolically put to rest the extensive losses of WW2 and all its encumbered grievances.\n\nIn Dreams, Kurosawa revives and explores his most personal memories, unconscious recollections, and most pertinent ruminations about life and life’s wandering shores. In both “Sunshine” and “The Peach Orchard”, he resurrects deceased family members, replicates familial settings and recaptures the whimsical naivety of childhood; exploring old wounds and formative memories through dreamlike fantasy and parabolic storytelling. In “The Blizzard” he explores the submerging faculties of mental health and the experiences he, and those he’s loved, have had to suffer in the wake of crises. In “The Tunnel”, he enlists Japan’s most destructive director, Honda, to expose the nascent contradictions of war; resurrecting a troupe of soldiers to convey the meaninglessness of their occupation and the callousness of their superiors.\n\nThrough cinema and cinematic experimentation, Kurosawa relives both his dreams and his memories - capturing the true essence of the director and personifying his woes, his regrets, his wisdom, and thereby his passions - via three focal lenses (the director famously utilised three cameras when filming) and monumental production costs: “Spielberg and Warner put up the money for Dreams. 1.4 billion yen. That’s a huge budget” (Nogami, 2016). Kurosawa, at the grand age of eighty, continued to work effortlessly to project his life and lessons on the big screen; illustrating each frame as if it were a painting, “carefully [designing] images from one corner of the screen to another” (Nogami, 2016). Hence, it comes as no surprise that the director originally wanted to be a painter, a dream which was squandered not by lack of talent but by the lack of income and the restrictions of the creative medium itself, as affirmed by the director when speaking with Ôbayashi:\n\nA huge admirer of Van Gogh’s and his work, Kurosawa had listed him in his autobiography as “one of the three artists he mentioned when he applied for work at a film company” and, in returning to his brother’s tragic death, “one of the three painters whose paintings changed the way the real world looked to him after [Heigo’s] suicide” (Serper, 2001). Kurosawa idolises Van Gogh endlessly in this piece. Through considerate reproductions of his work, to the graceful honour of Van Gogh’s in-film embodiment - he’s played by a certain famous film director known for his love of world cinema and his gangster movies to boot - Kurosawa resurrects the beloved, yet short-lived painter and extends to him a send-off of the highest veneration.\n\n“I” finds Van Gogh in the middle of a wheatfield, painting furiously in the view of a local landscape of trees and sun, and with a bandage around his head: “Yesterday I tried to complete a self-portrait. I just couldn’t get the ear right so I cut it off and threw it away”. Speaking with an unmistakably New York accent, Van Gogh asks why “I” isn’t painting the aforementioned sunny landscape as “To [him] this seems beyond belief.” The choice to cast Martin Scorsese as the iconic painter speaks volumes of the adoration Kurosawa felt towards Van Gogh. Enlisting arguably America’s top director, and avid film historian, to play the art world’s most tragic hero can only suggest that Kurosawa and his team felt that Scorsese, who was filming Goodfellas (1990) at the time of the shooting, emitted at least a semblance of what Van Gogh meant to Kurosawa. Speaking with Nogami sometime in the eighties, when Kurosawa was visiting fellow director Francis Ford Coppola in New York, Scorsese came across as very intense. So much so that Coppola and the rest of their posse, which included the likes of Spielberg and George Lucas - the latter of whom procured his company Industrial Light and Magic (ILM) to create many of the special effects for Dreams - would make fun of the Taxi Driver (1976) director for being so overly impassioned about cinema and subsequently Kurosawa, being such a legend of the medium. It was in this meeting that “Kurosawa had a sense [...] that Scorsese would be a good fit for Van Gogh” (Nogami, 2016). And through all the makeup, the vibrant orange hair, the iconic straw hat, it is this intensity that shines above all:\n\n“The sun compels me to paint”. These are the last words spoken by Scorsese’s Van Gogh shortly before he marches off into the distance in search of a new vista to paint. Kurosawa then establishes the world of the film as a series of Van Gogh paintings with “I” traversing numerous pieces by the tragic artist, concluding on the titular Wheatfield with Crows. It’s a truly magnificent send-off to one of the most enigmatic painters who has ever lived, with many of the film’s production assistants waiting hidden in the barley field - which had been replanted with wheat “so it would match the painting” a full year before the shoot - opening cages filled with crows to fly out when Scorsese passes out of sight (Nogami, 2016). And while these crows were indeed multiplied and accented by ILM in post-production, it shows just how determined everyone was on and off-set to portray Kurosawa’s vision with the utmost authenticity.\n\nWith “Crows” Kurosawa resurfaces painful memories in the form of his most beloved, and short-lived, painter. Relaying his affection towards, and his post factum condolences for, Van Gogh, who embodies not only the tragic loss of his brother, and indeed the painter himself, but the entirety of cinema concurrently. Through the application of Scorsese as Van Gogh, Kurosawa extends his gratitude to film, the medium which enabled his career, by acknowledging what came before in La Roue and what is coming presently (through Scorsese). In Dreams Kurosawa connects the dots of his psyche, his life, his legacy and gives appropriate reverence to the figures, films and filiations that made it possible.\n\nSeeing Fujisan exploding in shades of red, and the white snow - so indicative of it - turning into molten sludge is terrifying, to say the least. Yet, the sentiment between the Japanese and any other nation would be poles apart in terms of its meaning and impact because, in a sense, Mount Fuji is Japan. Though mountains have often been regarded as holy places - dwellers of ancestral spirits and gods - none are as beloved as Mount Fuji. And in the opening moments of “Mount Fuji in Red”, Kurosawa destroys it completely. Taking the classically divine image of Japan’s most emblematic cultural icon - which has been the subject of countless paintings, poems, films and photographs - and defacing it via man-made means, symbolically disrupting the Japanese zeitgeist and erupting a foreboding sense of apocalypse. As written by Serper, “The sight of the mountain has a major influence on the consciousness of the Japanese, and Fujisan is worshipped as a sacred place of various kami [god, deity, divinity, or spirit].” Thus, to fully realise his nightmare of nuclear disaster, Kurosawa obliterates it in red, contrasting “with that of its original traditionally benevolent image” and showing a god on fire, as symbolic of the prophetic destruction of the nation he inhabits should humanity continue to use, and misuse, nuclear power.\n\n“I” falls in with a mother (Toshie Negishi) and her screaming child as they stare frantically at the fiery spectacle. They’re joined by an older man, played by frequent Kurosawa collaborator, Hisashi Igawa, dressed in a business suit as they witness what the director describes as the end of Japan: “Japan is so small there's no escape.” The film cuts and we reemerge into a black wasteland of ash and smoke, with piles of discarded clothes, possessions and other items scattered around the devastation. The crowd has dispersed, the explosions halted and “I” and company, standing by nearby cliffside, proceed, in predictive fashion, to discern the latent blunders and hubris which have led to such a catastrophic outcome.\n\nWith “Mount Fuji in Red” Kurosawa condemns the use of nuclear power, exploring the terrible consequences of a meltdown and evoking the historic disasters in which Japan faced during WW2. He blames humanity, the creators of nuclear power, explaining in painstaking affect the potential of said creations to cause suffering on such a mountainous scale. Yet, to return to Nogami, it wasn’t unusual for Kurosawa to bemoan, to such a didactic extent, his ruminations about humanity’s wrongdoings, explaining that the “Death’s calling card” line was very typical of the director. Kurosawa - whose films, according to director John Woo (Hard Boiled, 1992), “are filled with a profuse spirit of humanism” (Cadou, 2011) - directs his lens to those who continue to create from nuclear power and attacks them head-on: “It’s simple: Human beings made something stupid, and we’ll never be rid of it” (Nogami, 2016).\n\nKurosawa’s contempt for humanity’s use of nuclear power, which erupts out of his retrospective awareness of his country’s widespread suffering caused by its misuse - and indeed no doubt by the Chernobyl disaster which occurred only four years before the release of Dreams - seeps drearily into the film’s next segment. Depicting a man-made-monstrous by a nuclear disaster, forced to feed or be fed upon by demons who wander an apocalyptic wasteland in constant pain from their newfound deformations, Kurosawa finalises his thoughts on the production of nuclear power in the film’s penultimate vignette, “The Weeping Demon”.\n\nWe find “I” stranded in what appears to be the apocalypse post the nuclear meltdown at Mount Fuji. While not explicitly a sequel to the previous segment, it certainly acts as a continuation of Kurosawa’s nuclear themes. The land is barren, grey, black and dead. Besides “I”’s patchwork attire, which sports muddy greens and creams, and the brown bucket hat so archetypical of director Kurosawa, there is no colour in sight. Just a creeping cloud of fog and a foreboding sense of dread.\n\nIt becomes clear to “I” that he’s being followed. With echoing footsteps proceeding each one of his, “I” halts and waits to see what manner of beast is making them. And somewhat fittingly, out of the sinister fog, comes a weeping demon, clad in rags and with a single horn protruding from his head. The demon speaks of how he came to be. How he was once a man, a farmer, who turned monstrous after dumping “tank trunks of milk into a river to keep prices up.” Through the demon’s confession, which he admits comes from an overriding sense of guilt, Kurosawa’s contempt for the allure of capitalism is displayed: A system of commercialised oppression that causes people to reject their humanity and put profit above all. This is reinforced by the later revelation that the demon, and the rest of the demons that exist in the apocalypse, eat each other for food; an expression of the devouring nature of capitalism, swallowing business, environments, livelihoods whole.\n\n“I” and the demon move into a dead field, now only inhabited by massive dandelions and monstrous roses left “deformed and misshapen” by radiation. The demon reveals that “Long ago this [...] was a field of flowers. But then the hydrogen bombs and missiles turned it into a desert!” Kurosawa aligns his disdain for capitalism with that of nuclear warfare, suggesting that those responsible for the development of nuclear weapons are simply corporate parasites sucking the life out of the earth; leaving it dry and uninhabitable. This reflects the film’s prior segment in which the man in suit (Igawa) is revealed to be one of the workers of the fateful nuclear plant, assuming some of the responsibility for the immense suffering caused and grouping himself with the rest of the capitalists before throwing himself off the cliff: “I am one of those who deserves to die.” Through the weeping demon and the Igawa’s guilt-ridden salaryman, Kurosawa emits what Ebiri describes as “a portrait of the runaway capitalism of post-war Japan, with its tangle of shame and hubris.”\n\nThis is further supported by the fact that the demons, who’re burdened to wander the wasteland for all time, feeding on any semblance of life, also feel pain. Excruciating agony from their aforementioned horns, some of which come in pairs or trios that increase their level of pain exponentially. There is seemingly a class structure within the demon’s ranks. The more horns, the more powerful the demon, and yet the more pain it feels; feeding on its weaker kin, and perpetually wandering farther from its human roots. Kurosawa seems again to be pointing the finger at those in charge, exposing the callousness of corporations and forcing them to feel every ounce of pain and guilt deserved for their abuse. This is made clear in the segment’s final moments, where the demon leads “I” to a pool of blood-red liquid around which a flurry of demons - sporting horns of two or three - pace in agony, gripping their heads and wailing monstrously.\n\nIn “The Weeping Demon” director Kurosawa interweaves notions of economic disparity, nuclear misuse and environmental negligence, culminating in a decrepit look at Japan post-apocalypse with warped fauna and forlorn inhabitants to boot: “We turned the Earth into a dumping ground for toxic waste! There’s no healthy nature left.” Everyone and everything is monstrous, deformed by humanity’s excessive pollution of the Earth’s environments and our wanton abuse of power, whether through military or commercial means. The abusers have turned into demons, the flowers malformed, the fish have grown fur and the birds have only one eye. And Kurosawa punishes humanity - the capitalistic demons guilty of the decrepit state of the world - by forcing us to witness our engendered degradation of nature for all time. Unless of course, we’re eaten by another demon first.\n\nThe man, played by Yasujirō Ozu alum, Chishū Ryū begins to tell “I” about life in the village, how they survive without electricity and the encumbered conveniences of the modern world: “We don’t need stuff like that.” He continues to renounce the technologies of the present, acknowledging the usefulness of tools such as electric lights while nevertheless exposing the inherent needlessness of them:\n\nI: “Isn’t it dark at night?”\n\nOld Man: “Night is supposed to be dark. We’d be in trouble if night were as bright as day.”\n\nThrough Ryū, Kurosawa criticizes humanity’s tendency towards laziness; as a species, we try so hard to separate ourselves from the natural world that we forget the essential truths of life and survival. In a near-didactic monologue, he portrays humanity as a hungry child, ever-wanting and endlessly unsatisfied; pointing the finger at scientists and inventors who “may be smart but so many of them are completely deaf to the beating of nature’s heart. They work so hard inventing things that make people unhappy.” It could be argued that Kurosawa is commenting on the technological revolution of post-war Japan; a country which up until the late 19th century was considered a feudal society, like Europe five hundred years earlier. It’s conceivable that after such a short period of industrialisation/modernisation, in which Kurosawa, in his memoir, still remembers the natural way of life he lived as a child, that the director would reject contemporary customs and yearn for the whimsical nature of the past. Moreover, Kurosawa’s use of Ryū speaks volumes to the director’s perceived nostalgia, being a star who was most famous around the time of his professional heyday and whose frequent director (Ozu), according to film historian Stuart Galbraith IV in his book, The Emperor and the Wolf: The Lives and Films of Akira Kurosawa and Toshiro Mifune, championed many of his early works.\n\nKurosawa frames his all-encompassing Dreams by way of two processions. The first being the fox wedding in “Sunshine”: A mystical, sinister and folkloric event that depicts a moment of growth for “I”, forced to leave the safety of his home and his mother, and journey into the great unknown in order to find enlightenment. This is symbolised by the rainbow in that particular vignette, a glorified archway beckoning “I” to enter the dream world. Yet, in “Waterwheels”, the adventure is complete, and the hero is returned. The old man, who in this sense, acts as the said hero (“I” as observer), bestows his enlightenment upon “I” (as Kurosawa). As “I”, and by proxy the viewer, have travelled the realms of memory, dreams and nightmare, so has the hero re-emerged from what Campbell describes as “the kingdom of dread” and the “boon that he brings” (the old man’s didactic wisdom on life, love and living) “restores the world”. While not his last film, Kurosawa brings his cinematic career, his life, his struggles, his adventure to a close in “Watermills.” Allowing his knowledge, his prescient woes, his vision to be expressed through the medium he knows best - cinema - and offering an “elixir” to heal the world's ailments (natural living). It is a story told time and time again, and yet, through its conception, and the purposeful injection of Kurosawa’s most intimate memories and life-long ruminations, he makes it entirely his. This is Kurosawa’s story. Full-bodied and brimming with his essence."
