You must make an effort to learn to regard it not as something painful, but as routine.”\n\nOne of the best things about being a teacher at the DePaul University School of Cinematic Arts is working with my students. They’re talented, motivated, and passionate about exploring their creative instincts and writing abilities. The interesting thing is our relationship is a two-way street. In class, I share everything from essential storytelling principles to inside information about the business of Hollywood to Joseph Campbell and Carl Jung to basically everything they need to know to succeed in the film and TV business.\n\nBut you know what? My students also teach me! I learn something every day in my interactions with them.\n\nHere’s an example. One of my DePaul undergraduates Jay has met with me twice this quarter to talk about screenwriting and how to grow as a writer. In our most recent session, we had this conversation:\n\nJay: I know from your blog you like writer quotes on writing.\n\nMe: Yeah, actually I’m kind of obsessed with them.\n\nJay: Well, I found this interview with [Akira] Kurosawa and he had this quote which I thought you might like.\n\nUh, yeah!"
