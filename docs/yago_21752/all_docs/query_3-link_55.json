        "text": "Mr Londoner explores the lives of two forgotten medieval sisters at the heart of royal power and patronage.\n\nWestminster Abbey is a leading London attraction for visitors from both the UK and overseas. It is a treasure trove of fascinating stories about the people who shaped the UK and, in some cases, the world. At the heart of this nearly 1,000 year-old building is the St Edmund Chapel. The unusually-designed hexagonal construction is a truly striking place. It’s full of history, atmosphere and intrigue.\n\nThe chapel houses the incredible Elizabethan tombs of Sir John Russell and his wife, Lady Elizabeth. Sir John’s effigy, in his ermine robes, exudes grandeur and self-importance. It resembles that of a fallen idol. At his feet is the body of his infant son, Francis, who pre-deceased him in 1581. Lady Elizabeth’s realistic likeness is carved in alabaster marble. She is depicted sitting. It’s said this is the first seated tomb in England. On the other side of the chapel rests the 13th century knight, Guillaume de Valance, 1st Earl of Pembroke. This is one of the earliest tombs to feature the use of enamel, applied here to great dramatic effect.\n\nSir John and Lady Elizabeth Russell keep eternal vigil over the Chapel of St Edmund. Copyright @meetmrlondoner\n\nBritain’s first Brexit\n\nSt Edmund’s is a former chantry chapel. ‘Chantry’ derives from the French word chanson and its English equivalent, chanting. It was here, in England’s Catholic days, that the Benedictine brothers of Westminster Abbey prayed and said mass over the bodies of recently-deceased nobles and minor aristocracy. This devotional act was performed in exchange for a tidy sum to support the church and its community. This was to help expedite otherwise lengthy journeys from purgatory, fast-tracking the moneyed dead through the gates of heaven. Henry VIII broke with Rome and the Catholic Church in the 1530s. He looked instead to a reformed English church, of which he would become its chief defender. This was Britain’s first Brexit. Many similarly-themed arguments were used to justify the UK’s shock separation from the European Union, in 2016.\n\nOne of Henry’s stronger arguments for suddenly – and somewhat unexpectedly – championing the Protestant Reformation was the inherent corruption of undeserving, but wealthy, people attempting to monetise their place in paradise.\n\nThe shift from Catholicism to Protestantism signalled the death-knell for Catholic idolatry. The saints were expunged from churches, shrines attacked – and chantry chapels either demolished or re-configured for other purposes. At Westminster Abbey they became smaller side chapels. Additionally they were used as burial places for general interments rather than chantry chapels for the exclusive use of individuals or a family.\n\nKing Edward I, possibly from the Sedilia. Image © 2024 Dean and Chapter of Westminster\n\nBetween the Russell and de Valance monuments, is the fine bronze-plated grave of Eleanor de Bohun. It’s easy to locate. The de Bohun family crest features an elegant swan, which can be seen to this day in the brass, as a small, but beautifully-detailed circular design. Eleanor was descended from King Edward I. She enjoyed a string of titles. She was Duchess of Gloucester, Duchess of Aumale, Countess of Buckingham and Countess of Essex. Her ancestor King Edward, is himself buried just a few feet away by the Shrine of St Edward – otherwise know as Edward the Confessor – the man who built the Abbey in the first place.\n\nCash-strapped\n\nAged just seven, Eleanor inherited a vast fortune from her late father, Thomas de Bohun in 1373. In 1376 (aged just ten!) she married the prominent noblemen Thomas of Woodstock, 1st Earl of Woodstock and, later, the Duke of Gloucester. Woodstock was the fifth and youngest son of King Edward III and Philippa of Hainault. Like most junior Royals, he was perennially cash-strapped. Woodstock would have been glad of the significant dowry that the marriage would bring and he and his new wife were rather looking forward to spending her inheritance on some lovely things. However, Eleanor had to share her fortune with her younger sister Mary. She harboured a hope that Mary would pack her bags, renounce her worldly goods and head off to a nunnery, leaving Eleanor as the sole inheritor of the de Bohun fortune.\n\nEleanor de Bohun, depicted in her widow’s robes, on her tomb’s brass plate in Westminster Abbey. Copyright @meetmrlondoner\n\nPressure was put on a much younger Mary to do exactly this. Matters took a different course fact. Mary’s aunt cooked up a plot, along with mover-and-shaker John of Gaunt, to spirit Mary away from the family pile at Pleshey Castle in Essex to Arundel Castle to marry John’s son, Henry Bolingbroke. Bolingbroke would go on to depose (and eventually murder) his cousin, Richard II, and become Henry IV, King of England, in 1399. The unfortunate Richard is buried at Westminster Abbey. Henry, died in Westminster Abbey but lies in Canterbury Cathedral.\n\nHenry of Bolingbroke, flanked by the lords spiritual and temporal, claims the throne in 1399.

He crushed the rebellion of the last Welsh Prince of Wales – Owain Glyndŵr – and then defeated Henry Percy (Harry Hotspur) at the Battle of Shrewsbury in 1403.\n\nConsolidating a power base, putting down any opposition and producing a son and heir was the pre-occupation of every medieval king of England. It was all about dynasty. To this end, Mary was barely 12 years old when she married Henry Bolingbroke in 1381. Five years later Mary gave birth to Henry, the first of her six children. He went on to become Henry V – King of England from 1413 and the hero of the Battle of Agincourt in 1415. Henry remains one of England’s most enigmatic monarchs. Mary died in childbirth, when her daughter Philippa was born in 1394. Far from the contemplative life, Mary’s days mapped out very differently. And today she remains a key, if somewhat lesser-known, footnote in British history.\n\nThe Portrait of Richard II of England (1390s). Westminster Abbey. Photo copyright Danny Parlour\n\nEleanor’s own life took an equally unexpected – and somewhat ironic turn. Her husband was murdered in France, on the orders of King Richard II. Some accounts suggest her unfortunate spouse was suffocated by a feather pillow by persons unknown. Act 1, Scene 2 of Richard II by William Shakespeare, features Eleanor trying in vain to convince John of Gaunt to avenge her husband’s murder. Back in the real world, a distraught Eleanor de Bohun was beside herself with grief. The fine brass plate on her tomb depicts the 36-year-old Eleanor in her widows’ veil. Most ironically of all, she spent the final two years of her life in Barking Abbey, having become a nun.\n\nAbout the Author"
