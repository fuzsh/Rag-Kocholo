        "text": "Today we’re going to take a look at one of Lady Percy’s monologues from Henry IV Part 2. This is an incredible monologue for someone wanting something high stakes, emotionally charged, and with big sweeping imagery. In this monologue we see Lady Percy mourn the loss of her dear husband Hotspur who has died in battle not long before…\n\nContext\n\nIn Part one of the play Lady Percy’s husband Hotspur, started a rebel alliance against King Henry the IV as he had not been very popular. And so everybody went to war, but most notably, Henry the IV’s son, Hal, and Hotspur faced one another on the battlefield and in the end Henry came out on top. This play begins not long after that fateful battle. Hotspur’s father Northumberland finds out through the grapevine that his son has been killed and decides to go to battle. As the rebels and the kingdom ready themselves for yet another war we find Lady Percy wrapped in grief trying to make Northumberland see the futility of war…\n\nOriginal Text\n\nO yet, for God’s sake, go not to these wars!\n\nThe time was, father, that you broke your word,\n\nWhen you were more endeared to it than now;\n\nWhen your own Percy, when my heart’s dear Harry,\n\nThrew many a northward look to see his father\n\nBring up his powers; but he did long in vain.\n\nWho then persuaded you to stay at home?\n\nThere were two honours lost, yours and your son’s.\n\nFor yours, the God of heaven brighten it!\n\nFor his, it stuck upon him as the sun\n\nIn the grey vault of heaven, and by his light\n\nDid all the chivalry of England move\n\nTo do brave acts: he was indeed the glass\n\nWherein the noble youth did dress themselves:\n\nHe had no legs that practised not his gait;\n\nAnd speaking thick, which nature made his blemish,\n\nBecame the accents of the valiant;\n\nFor those that could speak low and tardily\n\nWould turn their own perfection to abuse,\n\nTo seem like him: so that in speech, in gait,\n\nIn diet, in affections of delight,\n\nIn military rules, humours of blood,\n\nHe was the mark and glass, copy and book,\n\nThat fashion’d others. And him, O wondrous him!\n\nO miracle of men! him did you leave,\n\nSecond to none, unseconded by you,\n\nTo look upon the hideous god of war\n\nIn disadvantage; to abide a field\n\nWhere nothing but the sound of Hotspur’s name\n\nDid seem defensible: so you left him.\n\nNever, O never, do his ghost the wrong\n\nTo hold your honour more precise and nice\n\nWith others than with him! let them alone:\n\nThe marshal and the archbishop are strong:\n\nHad my sweet Harry had but half their numbers,\n\nTo-day might I, hanging on Hotspur’s neck,\n\nHave talk’d of Monmouth’s grave.\n\nUnfamiliar Language\n\nEndeared: Bound\n\nPowers: Army\n\nChivalry: Knights/Soldiers\n\nGlass: Mirror\n\nGait: Walk\n\nTardily: Slowly\n\nAffections of Delight: Pleasures\n\nHumour: Mood\n\nBook: Guidebook\n\nModern Translation\n\nOh, please, for God’s sake, don’t go to these wars!\n\nThere’s been times when you’ve broken your word when you were\n\nMore bound to the cause than you are now;\n\nWhen your dear son Percy, when my beloved Harry,\n\nLooked north to see his father bring home his army; but he did that in vain.\n\nWho persuaded you to stay home?\n\nTwo peoples honour was lost, your’s and your sons\n\nYour’s God might be able to brighten again,\n\nBut for his, it stuck to him like the sun to the sky.\n\nAnd because of that light every knight of England did brave things.\n\nHe was the role model for how the youth dressed themselves\n\nNo legs walked that didn’t emulate his noble walk.\n\nAnd his accent which was his only flaw,\n\nBecame the way to speak for valiant people.\n\nThose who spoke low and slowly made their voices sound like his.\n\nIn his speech, walk, diet, pleasure, tactics, mood, he was the standard by which everyone wanted to be.\n\nAnd him, oh wondrous him! That miraculous man!\n\nHim that you left alone on the battlefield to look upon the horrors of war.\n\nTo stand by in a field with nothing to fight with but his name.\n\nThat is how you left him.\n\nDo not do his spirit wrong by holding your honour more important than his.\n\nLet them go!\n\nThe marshal and archbishop have strong armies.\n\nIf my sweet Harry had half of their number I might be hanging off his neck and speaking of Monmouths grave.\n\nNotes on Performance\n\nThere’s a huge amount of text behind this moment to support your performance so if it’s at all possible you should definitely read this play and the one that came before it Henry IV Part 1.\n\nThis speech has high high stakes so don’t hold back. It’s pretty rare that you’re being too big for Shakespeare. So go for it!\n\nTry to affect the people that you’re talking to. The whole reason Lady Percy says what she does in this speech doesn’t exist within a vacuum; she’s desperately pleading with them not to go to war! So chase your objective."
