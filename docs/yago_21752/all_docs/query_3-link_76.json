        "text": "A) That women and men are actually very similar. We can all identify with Hal's struggle to transform, please his parent, and grow up.\n\nB) The term Woman was derogatory back then, and the treatment of hostess sometimes is very unfair. We capitalised on moments like that.\n\nC) The scene of Hotspur and Lady Percy has so many layers when performed by two women. It unlocked the scene in a great way. You understand both sides of the marriage and eventually see Hotspur's tough mask drop. There is genuine love between them.\n\nWith the setting of a women’s prison, Ms. Lloyd doesn’t simply ignore her actors’ gender or ask you to play the roles ‘as men’. How does this complex approach to gender and sexuality affect your performance?\n\nActually, I first just aim to be physically more like a boy and to speak with lower resonance.\n\nThe prisoner as the basis of who I am lets me just make decisions quickly from a gut feeling and not worry about right or wrong. Because that's what the prisoners would do. I think the prisoner sets the actor free. Ironic.\n\nWhat can you tell readers about Hal? What’s the most difficult part of the role?\n\nDifficult to think of myself as Royal—I'm Irish for god's sake!\n\nThen what’s surprised you about him?\n\nSurprised me? The sheer scope of journey. What he thinks he knows versus what he learns by experience.\n\nIs there a choice he makes, or a speech he gives, that’s helped you find your way into the role?\n\nThe speech \"Do not think so. You shall not find it so\" is a good turning point, plus, underneath it all, he just wants his dad to love him. Also here he realises he now has to do what he promised. Before this he was all talk and no action.\n\nHave you seen the play before? Have you played any of its other roles?\n\nNo. I saw a TV version but it didn't affect my playing. I saw Druid do it this summer but I had already played Hal before by then, so for me it was actually lively to just look at him from the outside in!\n\nIn a few interviews online, you’ve mentioned Harriet Walter’s influence on your career. Now you’ve played her wife & rival in J. Caesar and her son in Henry 4. What have you picked up from her, acting-wise?\n\nA lot about using the words and trusting to follow through on a thought or a line. It does the acting for you! She's generally so nice to work with. Very generous.\n\nWhat’s your background in Shakespeare and other classics? Do you think training is necessary to play Shakespeare?\n\nBackground: a couple of projects in drama school. I've read about verse-speaking, picked up tips, etc.\n\nBut no: training is not necessary to enjoy speaking this language. It's in us. It's instinct and words and you are expressing something to another human being. Are you human? Can you read? Do you ever try getting something across to someone? Yes, every day. Then you can for his.\n\nDo you have any particular Shakespearean roles you’d love to perform? Not just the women either—any dream-roles traditionally played by men?\n\nMacbeth maybe. Falstaff! Cleopatra.\n\nIn Henry 4, Shakespeare pointedly excludes women in the political arena, in the scene with Lady Hotspur. How do you try to reconcile his 16th-century views of women with your 21st-century ones?\n\nBasically we just follow our guts and play the scenes human to human. I think context and direction help underlay political themes or views. I think just seeing us play all the roles says a lot in itself.\n\nDon't really understand this question sorry!\n\n-----\n\nThe Donmar Warehouse's Henry IV runs from Nov 6 to Dec 6 at St. Ann's Warehouse in Dumbo.\n\nphotos Helen Maybanks"
