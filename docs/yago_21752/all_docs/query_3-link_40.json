Worse yet, he was exhumed from Whitchurch in Shropshire to be put on display.[3]\n\nHotspur's head was impaled on a city gate in York. The rest of his body was quartered, and divided between \"London, Newcastle upon Tyne, Bristol, and Chester,\" before his wife finally recovered them. She eventually reburied him in November 1403 at York Minster. [1][4] [3]\n\nMonument to Sir Henry \"Hotspur\" Percy at York Minster\n\nSir Henry \"Hotspur\" Percy was killed by an arrow to the head at the Battle of Shrewsbury, July 21, 1403. At the king's order, his head was displayed on a pike over York's Micklegate. He has a wall tablet and monument at York Minster in York in the Lady Chapel.\n\nNote: An e-mail was sent June 19, 2006 to Alton Rogers from Nikki at Dean and Chapter York Minster regarding Henry \"Hotspur\" Percy and his association with York Minster: \"Henry Percy does have a wall tablet and monument here at York Minster in the Lady Chapel. However, he was not buried here. In 1403 he joined his uncle, Thomas Percy Earl of Worcester in rebellion against Henry IV, joining forces with the Welsh rebel Owain Glyndwr. He was killed at the Battle of Shrewsbury when he lifted his visor to get some water, by an arrow through the mouth. An example was made of Hotspur and he was quartered and his body parts were sent all around England as a warning. His head was stuck on a pole at York's gates. Unfortunately, I have no information as to the final resting place of his body parts....\"\n\nTitles\n\nApr 1377: knighted by Edward III with the future Richard II and Henry IV, who were almost exactly his own age.[5]\n\nK.G.; K.B. and many high offices.[5]\n\nKnight of the Garter - 1366.
