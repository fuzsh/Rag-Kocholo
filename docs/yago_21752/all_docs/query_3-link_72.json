        "text": "When I walked inside, I immediately saw the half court line, the cameras up above, and realized that this warehouse used to be a basketball court. I thought it was funny that a court used for coaches to make basketball plays was where new actors and writers would make plays. I thought the mise en scene was very interesting and very hip. It felt very chill and I thought it was interesting how they had the steel drums and a dj on the side to add to the play. In regards to the actual play, until the end, I was fearing whether the actors were actual prisoners or not. Then, when I looked in the cast and saw the guards were actors, I found it very interesting. I found it interesting first that the guards were sort of “patriarchal” in my head, always watching over these women as they were acting, watching over them making sure no one did anything. In a play of all women, the only men were guards. That may have been by accident but nothing ever is. I think it was a symbol of patriarchy, if anything, unless this was completely by accident. Also, the fact that they were acting Henry IV in the prison made me wonder if the “accidents” were on purpose or not. They were very good but I wondered if the actors’ slips were purposeful or if they were just actual slip-ups. The actual slip-ups happened when Hal called the mistress lady a “cunt” and was insulting her for being their “whore” in the play and when Hal and King Henry were having a father-son talk until Falstaff came in playing something in a comedic manner. I feel like they were intentional, however, to take us out of the play and bring us back to the reality of the prison. Especially with the ending scene of lockdown, I think the play is supposed to bridge the two to show that the prisoners can put on a show as such but also, they are prisoners and Lloyd always reminds of as such.\n\nTowards the actual plot and the writing, I thought it was brilliantly written. I thought it was interesting how in the beginning scene, Clare Dunne (Hal) exclaims that she is being released in 3 weeks with a lot of energy. She is almost about to be released, as her character Hal is the heir to the throne. It brings forth how she is always going to leave so in the end, she reigns on top of the other characters as the king and as the next one to leave prison. Also, although it is supposed to be a Shakespearian play, there are a lot of modern twists. For example, instead of battling with swords or even an old gun, they have nerf guns/fake guns and a fake knife and fake money. This takes us out of the play’s false reality and brings us back to the reality of the prison, to further convey that these are props on a set for a prison play. Also, when they draw out the maps to split land between Henry Percy, Glendower, and the other character they were dividing land with, they used spray cans and string to divvy up the lands instead of having an actual map, which again brings us back to the reality that they are in prison. To bridge the gap between prison life and this Shakespearian play takes a brilliant writer and I think Lloyd wrote this beautifully.\n\nMy last point is in regards to the overarching fact that the play is of all woman characters. These women portray the men and women of the play. However, the only real women that were played by women were treated so poorly. The play Henry IV’s main women are Lady Percy and the hostess lady. Lady Percy is, domestically, treated poorly and abused verbally frequently by Hotspur when all she wants is his love and affection. Lady Percy stays at home with their kids while Hotspur goes out trying to be king but he shows no affection to his wife or children when he’s at home. In the play, Lady Percy says that Hotspur hasn’t slept well, hasn’t eaten well, and they haven’t had sex in a while. He’s neglecting her and when she tries to confront him and ask questions about his whereabouts and what he has been doing, he ignores her and just asks for their maid to get the horse. Even when threatening to hurt his penis, he just attacks her verbally saying he doesn’t love her and his true ambition is to be king. He says only when he is king, he will love her. He only treats his wife as if she is second to his true ambitions, or even third if you may. He doesn’t trust her at all and he doesn’t want to satisfy her obvious sexual needs. In regards to the hostess, she is basically Falstaff and Hal’s whore in their household and is treated only as if she is a whore just there to clean, cook, and fulfill their sexual desires. I feel that when she stormed off stage in tears, it showed not just her offense to Falstaff’s comments, but it showed how she really felt being their whore and servant as a woman. The only two women in the play were treated as almost less than human, unable to do anything except be subservient to their male master/husband. This displays the role of women in the Renaissance and in England. That was the most important theme to me; that even in a play of women, they were still subservient and forced to comply to the orders of men, even though the men were women. That made the play even more powerful to me and it showed the real power of patriarchy in one of Shakespeare’s most famous plays. It further displays how opinionated Shakespeare was, how ahead of his time he was, and how brilliant of a writer he was.\n\nIn closing, even though I wasn’t supposed to write an essay, I think this play was very interesting to me. I won’t lie but it’s the only show we’ve been to that I could stay awake for the whole thing so I didn’t miss a single beat. Every line, punchline/joke, and every metaphor was deeply understood by me, even though it went by very fast. I didn’t always understand their English but I understood quite a bit. I really loved this and this play, so far, was my favorite seminar production that I’ve ever been to. It was so amazing, well-written, and powerful. The only thing I would change is add more prison scenes to bring us even further into the reality of them being in prison. Also, although she was ill, Susan Wakoma’s script in hand took away a bit for me. However, I will forever love when she threw the script away so passionately and spoke the rest of her lines in the Hotspur/Lady Percy scene. I give this play 8.99/10 fake guns for it’s amazing writing and wonderful acting. I thoroughly enjoyed this play.\n\nMy ballet experiences have been nothing but dreadful for my entire life. I was not a big fan of ballet or dance in general. I would always respect the ability, athleticism, and compassion of the dancers but I have never really have an “enjoyable” time watching a ballet, or dance in general. I never seemed to find a purpose in any type of dance except for it’s beauty. I couldn’t fathom what so many people but me enjoyed about ballet. However, in this ballet, I was so intrigued. I will not lie; I did find myself bored at times but also, I was very impressed and sucked in to the intensity of the ballet. The binoculars helped me a lot to see everyone in the orchestra and in the show. I got to see the concertmaster, the clarinet section, the times the orchestra would talk. I even saw the fly-aways of the concertmaster and the conductor. It helped keep this ballet interesting for me, especially since I am one to lose interest quickly and nod off. The orchestra, for me, was the best part of the ballet. They exhibited certain qualities of an orchestra that show how professional they were and how ridiculously good they were. First, they were never “loud”, almost like very loud noise that disrupts you. They had such amazing dynamics and contrast in every style. When dancers were on their tip-toes or performing very delicate maneuvers, the orchestra had amazing articulation, almost accenting every step in the proper way for the move. I also think that their control of how soft and loud they were was very exceptional, which ties in with that they were never loud. It seemed as though even when they were forte, they were not blasting or too loud. In a lot of high school and middle school and even in college bands/orchestras, their age shows through the control, intonation, and the dynamics of the group. However, this professional orchestra amazed me in every way. The introduction to the second movement of the show was one of my favorite parts of the show. The clarinet and oboe and the violins had a particular soli that was absolutely beautiful. It was very pretty and had interesting lines that showed how modern it was. It foreshadowed the “weirdness” but more-so the modern style/costumes the dancers would portray/wear. No matter how much I loved the orchestra in the second movement, I loved the third movement the most. I didn’t get the program for the ballet but it felt good to assume what this was about. The first scene and last scene confused me greatly but I loved the warfare scenes and the dancer representing death/war in some way. I really enjoyed the repetition of the dance moves and all of the dancing in that part. The dancers made it clear what was happening in every scene without spelling it out to us. The pianists were also crazy good and their dynamics were very good. They had very good verbal & non verbal communication and I respected their musicianship greatly. In general, after walking by Lincoln Center every day to go to school, I never thought I would be ever so intrigued in one if it wasn’t for jazz or a musical. However, I was rather pleased with the American Ballet Theatre’s performance and I respect their artistic ability. Although I can never, ever do what they did that night, I can understand and see that they are some of the best dancers in the world."
