        "text": "⌜Scene 3⌝\n\nSynopsis:\n\nHotspur reads a letter from a nobleman who refuses to join the rebellion against King Henry. Lady Percy enters to ask Hotspur what has been troubling him so much lately, but he will not confide in her.\n\nEnter Hotspur alone, reading a letter.\n\n⌜HOTSPUR⌝ 0865 But, for mine own part, my lord, I could be\n\n0866 well contented to be there, in respect of the love I\n\n0867 bear your house. He could be contented; why is he\n\n0868 not, then? In respect of the love he bears our\n\n0869 5 house—he shows in this he loves his own barn\n\n0870 better than he loves our house. Let me see some\n\n0871 more. The purpose you undertake is dangerous.\n\n0872 Why, that’s certain. ’Tis dangerous to take a cold,\n\n0873 to sleep, to drink; but I tell you, my Lord Fool, out\n\n0874 10 of this nettle, danger, we pluck this flower, safety.\n\n0875 The purpose you undertake is dangerous, the friends\n\n0876 you have named uncertain, the time itself unsorted,\n\n0877 and your whole plot too light for the counterpoise\n\n0878 of so great an opposition. Say you so, say you so?\n\n0879 15 I say unto you again, you are a shallow, cowardly\n\n0880 hind, and you lie. What a lack-brain is this! By\n\np. 67\n\n0881 the Lord, our plot is a good plot as ever was laid,\n\n0882 our friends true and constant—a good plot,\n\n0883 good friends, and full of expectation; an excellent\n\n0884 20 plot, very good friends. What a frosty-spirited\n\n0885 rogue is this! Why, my Lord of York commends\n\n0886 the plot and the general course of the action.\n\n0887 Zounds, an I were now by this rascal, I could brain\n\n0888 him with his lady’s fan. Is there not my father, my\n\n0889 25 uncle, and myself, Lord Edmund Mortimer, my\n\n0890 Lord of York, and Owen Glendower? Is there not\n\n0891 besides the Douglas? Have I not all their letters to\n\n0892 meet me in arms by the ninth of the next month,\n\n0893 and are they not some of them set forward already?\n\n0894 30 What a pagan rascal is this—an infidel! Ha, you\n\n0895 shall see now, in very sincerity of fear and cold\n\n0896 heart, will he to the King and lay open all our\n\n0897 proceedings. O, I could divide myself and go to\n\n0898 buffets for moving such a dish of skim milk with so\n\n0899 35 honorable an action! Hang him, let him tell the\n\n0900 King. We are prepared. I will set forward tonight.\n\nEnter his Lady.\n\n0901 How now, Kate? I must leave you within these two\n\n0902 hours.\n\nLADY PERCY\n\n0903 O my good lord, why are you thus alone?\n\n0904 40 For what offense have I this fortnight been\n\n0905 A banished woman from my Harry’s bed?\n\n0906 Tell me, sweet lord, what is ’t that takes from thee\n\n0907 Thy stomach, pleasure, and thy golden sleep?\n\n0908 Why dost thou bend thine eyes upon the earth\n\n0909 45 And start so often when thou sit’st alone?\n\n0910 Why hast thou lost the fresh blood in thy cheeks\n\n0911 And given my treasures and my rights of thee\n\n0912 To thick-eyed musing and curst melancholy?\n\n0913 In thy faint slumbers I by thee have watched,\n\np. 69\n\n0914 50 And heard thee murmur tales of iron wars,\n\n0915 Speak terms of manage to thy bounding steed,\n\n0916 Cry “Courage! To the field!” And thou hast talked\n\n0917 Of sallies and retires, of trenches, tents,\n\n0918 Of palisadoes, frontiers, parapets,\n\n0919 55 Of basilisks, of cannon, culverin,\n\n0920 Of prisoners’ ransom, and of soldiers slain,\n\n0921 And all the currents of a heady fight.\n\n0922 Thy spirit within thee hath been so at war,\n\n0923 And thus hath so bestirred thee in thy sleep,\n\n0924 60 That beads of sweat have stood upon thy brow\n\n0925 Like bubbles in a late-disturbèd stream,\n\n0926 And in thy face strange motions have appeared,\n\n0927 Such as we see when men restrain their breath\n\n0928 On some great sudden hest. O, what portents are\n\n0929 65 these?\n\n0930 Some heavy business hath my lord in hand,\n\n0931 And I must know it, else he loves me not.\n\nHOTSPUR\n\n0932 What, ho!\n\n⌜Enter a Servant.⌝\n\n0933 Is Gilliams with the packet gone?\n\nSERVANT 0934 70He is, my lord, an hour ago.\n\nHOTSPUR\n\n0935 Hath Butler brought those horses from the sheriff?\n\nSERVANT\n\n0936 One horse, my lord, he brought even now.\n\nHOTSPUR\n\n0937 What horse? ⌜A⌝ roan, a crop-ear, is it not?\n\nSERVANT\n\n0938 It is, my lord.\n\nHOTSPUR 0939 75 That roan shall be my throne.\n\n0940 Well, I will back him straight. O, Esperance!\n\n0941 Bid Butler lead him forth into the park.\n\n⌜Servant exits.⌝\n\np. 71\n\nLADY PERCY 0942 But hear you, my lord.\n\nHOTSPUR 0943 What say’st thou, my lady?\n\nLADY PERCY 0944 80What is it carries you away?\n\nHOTSPUR 0945 Why, my horse, my love, my horse.\n\nLADY PERCY 0946 Out, you mad-headed ape!\n\n0947 A weasel hath not such a deal of spleen\n\n0948 As you are tossed with. In faith,\n\n0949 85 I’ll know your business, Harry, that I will.\n\n0950 I fear my brother Mortimer doth stir\n\n0951 About his title, and hath sent for you\n\n0952 To line his enterprise; but if you go—\n\nHOTSPUR\n\n0953 So far afoot, I shall be weary, love.\n\nLADY PERCY\n\n0954 90 Come, come, you paraquito, answer me\n\n0955 Directly unto this question that I ask.\n\n0956 In faith, I’ll break thy little finger, Harry,\n\n0957 An if thou wilt not tell me all things true.\n\nHOTSPUR 0958 Away!\n\n0959 95 Away, you trifler. Love, I love thee not.\n\n0960 I care not for thee, Kate. This is no world\n\n0961 To play with mammets and to tilt with lips.\n\n0962 We must have bloody noses and cracked crowns,\n\n0963 And pass them current too.—Gods me, my horse!—\n\n0964 100 What say’st thou, Kate? What wouldst thou have\n\n0965 with me?\n\nLADY PERCY\n\n0966 Do you not love me? Do you not indeed?\n\n0967 Well, do not then, for since you love me not,\n\n0968 I will not love myself. Do you not love me?\n\n0969 105 Nay, tell me if you speak in jest or no.\n\nHOTSPUR 0970 Come, wilt thou see me ride?\n\n0971 And when I am a-horseback I will swear\n\n0972 I love thee infinitely. But hark you, Kate,\n\n0973 I must not have you henceforth question me\n\n0974 110 Whither I go, nor reason whereabout.\n\np. 73\n\n0975 Whither I must, I must; and to conclude\n\n0976 This evening must I leave you, gentle Kate.\n\n0977 I know you wise, but yet no farther wise\n\n0978 Than Harry Percy’s wife; constant you are,\n\n0979 115 But yet a woman; and for secrecy\n\n0980 No lady closer, for I well believe\n\n0981 Thou wilt not utter what thou dost not know,\n\n0982 And so far will I trust thee, gentle Kate.\n\nLADY PERCY 0983 How? So far?\n\nHOTSPUR\n\n0984 120 Not an inch further. But hark you, Kate,\n\n0985 Whither I go, thither shall you go too.\n\n0986 Today will I set forth, tomorrow you.\n\n0987 Will this content you, Kate?\n\nLADY PERCY 0988 It must, of force.\n\nThey exit."
