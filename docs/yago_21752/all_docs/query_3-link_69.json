        "text": "Inhabiting Shakespeare's women can be frustrating, not because he lacked insight into the female condition but because he didn't give us enough space in which to play. \"Have you ever felt that one of your scenes is missing?\" Elizabeth Bell once asked me as she adjusted Gertrude's lipstick, rose from her chair and exited with resignation to meet Hamlet in her closet.\n\nIn 1991, I was playing Lady Percy, wife of the impetuous Hotspur, in Adrian Noble's production of Henry IV parts I & II. There are five named women in these plays, and 50 men. For about the first 45 minutes of the play, only male voices are heard. Then in act 2 scene 3 Kate Percy arrives and speaks for 28 lines without pausing for breath. Her outpouring is a challenge to her husband to tell her what's going on.\n\nWhile driving to Stratford during the run of the play, I heard on the radio an army wife whose husband was involved in the first Gulf war. She said she and her husband usually argued the night before he left home on a posting, because the tension was just too much. Shakespeare accurately wrote the scenes between the Percys as a passionate argument.\n\nRobert Stephens, playing Falstaff, was returning to the stage after a long absence due to ill health. His rakish body seemed to endow Falstaff with a knowledge of \"sack\" that was deep, heartfelt and carnal. His listing gait, from an old fall, gave Falstaff the battered determination of the Fighting Temeraire being towed downstream to be broken up.\n\nOne Friday we gathered in our Clapham rehearsal room for the final run through. The kettle drums, which had arrived some days before, were positioned at the back of the room ready for the battle. I sat on the floor at the front almost under Adrian's desk, as if I were a child at primary school on the story carpet.\n\nThere were one or two pieces of furniture, some odd costumes and two or three huge flagpoles. Robert had a cape and a battered hat and, thin without the Falstaff padding, he shambled with broken strides across the floor, whacked the tavern door frame almost off its hinges and barked with a voice that could have stripped paint from the back wall.\n\nWe watched open-jawed as the magnificent structure of the play unfolded. The kettle drums shook the floor as the men in battle howled and ran across the bare boards. It was an astounding afternoon, inspirational, whether watching or playing we all felt part of an organism we had not known existed.\n\nWhen we got to Stratford the women were banished, three of us in a tiny upstairs dressing room. Actresses in Shakespeare are in an exceptional position, detached from the action, yet linked to it. We hear the play again and again over the PA; new things strike us, we wonder if Shakespeare understood how it feels to be pushed into a position that seems peripheral. As Henry IV wore on, our talk was underscored by the insistent rumble of drums and the cries of battle.\n\nActors come to depend on backstage rituals, building patterns and pathways echoing the onstage life of a play. I don't know how it happened that the men started to come to our room, bloody in their battle dress during breaks in the fighting. There was barely space. They filled the vacant seats then sat on the counters, chain mail among Kleenex and rouge. Rules were observed, weapons had to be left in the corridor.\n\nWhat did we talk about? I don't remember. About life rather than death, about what had happened in the tavern a few minutes before. I know there was laughter, and I know we invariably paused to hear Robert on the loudspeaker ask: \"What is honour? A word.\" Though the conversations are lost to me now, I know that these moments were valuable to all of us. Finally we'd hear the call \"Standby for the tableau\", and the men would leave, not for real battle, but to pretend.\n\nLater I thought about Kate Percy, whose insistence drives her husband to take her to the field of battle to silence her. Like many women, she exists in a war zone without being able to influence the outcome. Many years later, while working on one of her speeches with a drama student, we came to a section where the pentameter has an unexpected rhythm. I'd skipped over it 20 years before, but working on it again we found the underlying beat of a drum woven into the sentence structure. You can work on a speech for years and still find new insights.\n\nMore from Monologue\n\nSamantha Bond: When I kissed Branagh as Romeo we both blushed scarlet\n\nZöe Wanamaker: Je ne regrette rien about Piaf\n\nSinéad Cusack: How Jeremy Irons helped me sneak into the RSC\n\nFiona Shaw: Playing Electra in Derry helped me see the power of tragedy"
