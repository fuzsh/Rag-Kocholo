        "text": "Despite much scholarship on Shakespeare's tragic/trapped and comedic/stoic women, few studies illuminate the almost non-existent role of women in the history plays. The challenge is to deemphasize the riveting male characters of the histories--Falstaff, Hal, and Richard II--and focus instead upon the intelligent, resourceful, and often silent women who populate these plays. With an alternate reading, we valorize these women and discover much about societally-imposed expectations in the Elizabethan age as literary archeologists uncovering a salient past. Margaret of Anjou (Henry VI, Richard III) and Lady Percy-Kate (Henry IV) discover that they can never really control their lives. Henry VI easily preempts Margaret's hard-won authority. At his death, her only alternative is to move into the role of leftover queen. Kate also lives with insignificance. She is isolated when Hotspur's penchant for warring precludes his love for her. We experience the bitter progression as these historical women understand that they are destined to live in the margin. Their identities are determined by the men they marry. However, Margaret achieves control in the end, not over the lives of others, but over her own self. Widowed and throneless, no longer a possession, she defies Richard III and becomes his personal prophetess of doom. The women of the history plays reflect the uncertain status of Elizabethan women, yet Shakespeare questions their predetermined roles and identities.\n\nMy aim through this article is to propagate that Shakespeare is the best known voice for Theatre equality. Drama affects the human spirit; it illuminates our conditions in a way that changes our views of ourselves, our neighbors and the world around us. From the point of view of the history of manners, the prohibition of woman from the stage is also certainly connected to the way the acting profession was normally regarded: as menacing figure, not only because he is able to play an infinite number of roles, but also because, according to the typecast. In this paper the female role has been studied within the context of the merry culture which prevails throughout sixteenth century England. Understanding the female role in its original cheerful context entailed examining the joyful society in Elizabethan England through these plays.\n\nIn this essay, I will evaluate the evidence critics supply in order to address the question: did adult men ever play any of Shakespeare’s female roles on the early modern stage? I will consider the issue of modern day ‘Original Practices’ casting that exclusively utilizes adult male actors, keeping in mind the drive in creators and consumers of theatre to access a “pleasure” derived from experiences they understand to approximate, as Virginia Mason Vaughan puts it, “Shakespeare’s original” intentions. In particular, I will examine Mark Rylance's casting as Cleopatra in the Globe’s 1999 all-male production of Antony and Cleopatra, which several critics heralded as a triumph for authenticity in line with the Globe's self-styled ‘Original Practices’ casting--that is, the choice to populate all of a play’s roles with male actors. This paper investigates historical records and extant scholarship in the field, and asks: if standard early modern practices suggest no evidence of adult men playing female roles, why is this practice embraced as 'authentic' in modern performance? This paper argues that, if historicity is invoked to invalidate women’s claims to Shakespeare’s female roles in modern performance, adult men’s performances ought to be challenged on those same terms.\n\nThe aim of this thesis is to clarify the role that female interpreters in Britain played at an early stage in the canonisation of William Shakespeare. Shakespeare, one of the popular playwrights in English Renaissance theatre, became increasingly famous during the first half of the eighteenth century, and the Shakespeare Jubilee in 1769 marked the climax of the popularisation of his works. It is said that since then, he has maintained his position as the ‘national poet’ of England (or Britain). Although women had supported Shakespeare even before his works had established their canonical status, the extent to which female interpreters contributed to the canonisation of Shakespeare, how they participated in the process, and why they played the roles that they did have not yet been sufficiently visible. In this thesis, I illustrate women’s engagement in the process of the popularisation of Shakespeare by examining the early reception of his works, and to document how individual women’s pleasure of reading and playgoing relates to their intellectual activities. I adopt three approaches to provide answers to my research questions in this thesis: reading critical and fictional works by women; analysing the descriptions of female readers and playgoers by male writers; and conducting a large-scale survey of the ownership history of pre-mid-eighteenth-century printed books of Shakespeare’s plays. This thesis is divided into four chapters. In the first chapter, I analyse women’s engagement with theatre in Renaissance England, and consider Shakespeare’s popularity amongst them based on records about female audiences. The second chapter discusses female readers and writers in Renaissance England and their responses to Shakespeare’s works. Chapter 3 focuses on Restoration Shakespeare and female interpreters from 1642 to 1714. The fourth chapter discusses women’s playgoing, play-reading, writings, and their participation from the early eighteenth century to the Shakespeare Jubilee in 1769.\n\nIt is a most significant matter and aspect of Shakespeare's artistic genius in presenting his women character, that I'm now going to deliberate and contemplate through my paper and thereby bring out a social picture of Shakespeare's time: it's patriarchy, women's condition and their social importance. In our way of discussing women character in Shakespeare's plays, we have to cast a view upon social condition of women, Queen Elizabeth's influence, its stage plays and many others. In this very paper I am going to project three different types of woman and try to determine them socially during Queen Elizabeth's reign. Amongst the other huge number of women character, few important characters are categorized and discussed briefly. And mostly Shakespeare's intelligence and skill in fitting them in a right place and in a right manner is also a central theme of my paper. The various characters with their fluency, their obstacles, their dealings with men and above all Shakespeare's managing of them is purposefully presented on my discussion. In a word, Shakespeare's view upon his female characters, weather it is glorious, jovial or timid investigated argumentatively.\n\nShakespeare's courageous women include an extensive variety of portrayals and types. Inside the exhibition of female characters, Shakespeare's female characters show incredible knowledge, essentialness, and a solid feeling of individual autonomy. These characteristics have driven a few faultfinders to look at Shakespeare as a victor of womankind and a pioneer who left pointedly from level, stereotyped portrayals of females basic to his counterparts and prior producers. Contrastingly, different reporters take note of that even Shakespeare's most positively depicted females have characters that are tempered by negative characteristics. William Shakespeare lived amid the Elizabethan period and composed every one of his works dependent on the general public of that time. The Elizabethan period was a period when females were depicted to be weaker than males. Amid that time it was said that \"women are to be seen, and not heard.\" In this paper an endeavour has been taken to investigate"
