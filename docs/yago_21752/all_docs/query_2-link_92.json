        "text": "It’s nice to see Kate Percy in my inbox! She’s a great character. The teasing comedic nature of the interaction between Kate and Hotspur is quite an endearing representation of one kind of married relationship. ‘Out, you mad-headed ape!’ (2.3.74) to the person who is too distracted to listen to you and who replies to your serious concern ‘What is it carries you away?’ with a literal ‘Why, my horse, my love, my horse’ (2.3.72-73), is both amusing and kind of realistic. It’s quite easy to imagine them as the kind of couple that will slap each other playfully when the other says something ridiculous. And, the sweet thing is that they obviously do care about each other, even if Hotspur does mockingly phrase his reply so that it’s not clear whether he’s calling her or his horse his love… Although they don’t appear together very much, the way they have all these pet names (mostly animals) for one another and keep riffing off one another paints a pretty vivid picture of their relationship.\n\nBut even if it’s said jokingly, there is something to Hotspur’s way of denigrating Kate’s worry and her love that’s revealing. He tells her, in response to her saying that if he loved her, he’d tell her what’s on his mind with, ‘Love! I love thee not; / I care not for thee, Kate. This is no world / To play with mammets and tilt with lips’ (2.3.86-88). He’s saying, essentially, that he has no time for love, and the feminine, which he characterises as things like playing with dolls or kissing. Hotspur considers the female sphere of life as frivolous and thinks that’s where his wife belongs. He loves her, but only has time for her when he has time for kissing. Of course, it’s important to recognise that this is partly a joke still, as is evident from Kate’s response, which is half hurt, and half amused:\n\nDo you not love me? Do you not indeed?\n\nWell, do not then, for since you love me not\n\nI will not love myself. Do you not love me?\n\nNay, tell me if you speak in jest or no. (2.3.92-95)\n\nKate herself isn’t sure if Hotspur is joking, so she’s not taking it entirely seriously, and in asking whether he jests, shows that he is the kind of person who would say such things mockingly. Still, she’s certainly a little shocked that he’d say he doesn’t love her, even as a joke (she repeats ‘Do you not love me?’ twice).\n\nThe thing is, Hotspur is speaking something of what he actually thinks in his joking manner. He never answers her straight: ‘When I am a-horseback, I will swear/ I love thee infinitely’ (2.3.97-98). And though he does love her as much as a man like him is capable of, he’s still fundamentally misogynistic, and doesn’t consider her his equal:\n\nI know you wise, but yet no farther wise\n\nThan Harry Percy’s wife; constant you are,\n\nBut yet a woman; and for secrecy\n\nNo lady closer, for I well believe\n\nThou wilt not utter what thou dost know,\n\nAnd so far will I trust thee, gentle Kate (2.3.103-108)\n\nIn Hotspur’s mind, Kate is always defined in relation to him. She’s wise for a wife of his, she’s secretive, but only because she knows nothing. He thinks Kate is the best woman, but only as good as a woman can be, which is always less than a man. It’s to Kate’s credit that she’s not particularly happy with his idea of her. When asked ‘Will this content you?’ she answers ‘It must of force’ (2.3.113), which is to say she has no choice but to be contented with her lot, and how her husband treats her. It’s rather brilliant that Shakespeare shows in her being able to tell that ‘I fear my brother Mortimer doth stir / About his title, and hath sent for you / To line his enterprise’ (2.3.78-79), showing very concisely that whatever Hotspur thinks of her, she’s perfectly politically savvy. And of course, in the only other scene she appears in she shows again that she can give as good as she gets from Hotspur, and refuse to do what he says, even as he continues in his light-hearted(?) misogyny. She’s great because she maintains character and strength even though she’s in a weak position, and because, whatever his weaknesses, she loves her husband, as is obvious from her eulogy of Hotspur in Part 2, Act 2, scene 3."
