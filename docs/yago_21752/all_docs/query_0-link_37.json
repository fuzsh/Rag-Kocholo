        "text": "Henry Percy (1392/3 - 1455), 1st Earl of Northumberland, was the son of Henry 'Hotspur' Percy. He was restored to favor by Henry V, receiving his grandfather's estates and re-creation of the earldom. Percy was on the regency council in the early years of the reign of Henry VI. He was killed fighting on the Lancastrian side at the Battle of St Albans. Percy married Eleanor Neville, daughter of Ralph, 1st Earl of Westmorland, and was succeeded as earl by his eldest son.\n\nThere were two battles during the English Wars of the Roses fought in or near the town of St Albans.\n\nThe first Battle of St Albans was the first battle of the war and was fought on May 22, 1455.\n\nRichard, Duke of York and his ally, Richard Neville, Earl of Warwick defeated the Lancastrians under Edmund Beaufort, 2nd Duke of Somerset, who was killed. York captured King Henry VI of England and had himself appointed Constable of England.\n\nThe second Battle of St Albans was fought February 22, 1461. With the defeat and death of the Duke of York the previous December (at the Battle of Wakefield, and York's son and heir busy in the west (where the Battle of Mortimer's Cross was fought a few days before the engagement at St Albans), the way was clear for the Lancastrians (lead by Queen Margaret ) to march south towards London, pillaging and sacking as they went.\n\nThey were intercepted near St Albans by forces commanded by the Earl of Warwick. Warwick had his men set up an array of defenses, including ditches and spikes, but they were surprised and defeated before these were complete.\n\nThe Lancastrians captured King Henry, who supposedly spent the battle sitting under a tree, singing. But they did not press their advantage by marching south to London. The reasons are not clear; it may be that their reputation for pillaging had preceeded them as the Londoners would not open their gates.\n\nThe Battle of Hexham (May 15, 1464) marked the end of significant Lancastrian resistance in the north of England during the early part of the reign of Edward IV.\n\nJohn Neville, later to be 1st Marquess of Montagu, led a modest force of 3,000-4,000 men, routed the rebel Lancastrians. Most of the rebel leaders were captured and executed, including Henry Beaufort, 2nd Duke of Somerset. Henry VI, however, was kept safely away (having been captured in battle 3 times earlier in his life), and escaped to the north.\n\nWith their leadership gone, only a few castles remained in rebel hands. After these fell later in the year, Edward IV was not seriously challenged until the Earl of Warwick switched sides in 1469."
