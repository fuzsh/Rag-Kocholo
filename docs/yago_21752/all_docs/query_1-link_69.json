He acceded to the title in 1382 and built Gowran Castle three years later in 1385 close to the centre of Gowran, making it his usual residence, whence his common epithet, The Earl of Gowran. James died in Gowran Castle in 1405 and is buried in St. Mary's Collegiate Church Gowran together with his father James Butler, 2nd Earl of Ormond, his grandfather James Butler, 1st Earl of Ormond and his great great grandfather Edmund Butler, Earl of Carrick and 6th Chief Butler of Ireland.[1] James the 2nd Earl was usually called The Noble Earl, being a great-grandson, through his mother, Eleanor de Bohun, of King Edward I of England.\n\nIn 1391 he purchased Kilkenny Castle from the Despencer family.[2][3] He also built the castle of Dunfert (also called Danefort) and in 1386 founded a Friary of minorities at Aylesbury in Buckinghamshire.[4]\n\nIn 1384 he was deputy to Sir Philip Courtenay, the then Lieutenant of Ireland, who was the nephew of the Archbishop of Canterbury, William Courtenay.

A rift occurred between them over the disagreement between the Archbishop of Canterbury and Richard II with Butler taking the side of the latter. Insurrection followed which prompted Richard II to an expedition under the banner of his close friend Robert de Vere, Duke of Ireland to quell it. This enterprise was led by Sir John Stanley who was accompanied by Bishop Alexander de Balscot of Meath and Sir Robert Crull.[5] Butler joined them upon their arrival in Ireland. The result of its success was Stanley's appointment as Lieutenant of Ireland, Bishop Alexander as chancellor, Crull as treasurer, and Butler again as governor.[6] On 25 July 1392, he was appointed Lord Justice of Ireland as he was again in 1401.

At a young age, he was made Warden of the Marches towards Scotland in 1362, with the authority to negotiate with the Scottish government. In February 1367, he was entrusted with the supervision of all castles and fortified places in the Scottish marches. He went on to support King Richard II, was formally created an Earl on Richard's coronation in 1377,[2] and was briefly given the title of Marshal of England. Between 1383 and 1384, he was appointed Admiral of the Northern Seas. After Richard elevated his rival Ralph Neville to the position of Earl of Westmorland in 1397, Percy and his son, also Henry and known as \"Hotspur\", supported the rebellion of Henry Bolingbroke, who became King as Henry IV.\n\nOn King Henry IV's coronation, Henry Percy was appointed Constable of England and granted the lordship of the Isle of Man. Percy and Hotspur were given the task of subduing the rebellion of Owain Glyndwr, but their attempts to make peace with the Welsh rebels did not meet with the king's approval.\n\n(Duplicate Line.

He also held the title Baron Abergavenny. He was born in Sutton Valence, the son of Laurence Hastings, 1st Earl of Pembroke, and Agnes Mortimer. His father died when John Hastings was only a year old, and he became a ward of King Edward III whilst remaining in his mother's care. The King arranged for John to marry Edward's daughter Margaret in 1359, which drew John into the royal family. However, Margaret died two years later. John Hastings inherited his father's earldom, subsidiary titles and estates in 1368. The same year he made a second marriage, to Anne, daughter of Walter, Lord Mauny. The following year Pembroke commenced the career in royal service that was to consume the rest of his life. The Hundred Years' War had recently reignited in France, and in 1369 Pembroke journeyed to Aquitaine.\n\nThere he took part in a sequence of raids, sieges, and counter-measures against the French, with both notable successes and failures. The latter were compounded by his apparent inability to work alongside the famed soldier Sir John Chandos, who, although head of the King's forces there, was far below Pembroke in rank. He was, however, far above Pembroke in ability, and his subsequent death led to even more problems for Pembroke in France. A couple of years later, the earl was summoned to parliament and returned to England. There, perhaps exasperated by the political failures of the king's ecclesiastical ministers, he was responsible for forcing them from power and being replaced by laymen. Pembroke was soon to return to France again, for what was to be the last time. In 1372 he set off with a small fleet, intending to raise a new army once in Aquitaine. However, his arrival had been anticipated by the Castilian navy (whose kingdom was then allied to France). Pembroke, outnumbered and outgunned, was forced to fight at the Battle of La Rochelle, where he went down to a crushing defeat. Captured and taken to Castile, he was imprisoned in harsh conditions. It took a further three years for a large ransom to be negotiated, but in 1375, he was finally released. Returning to England through France, he was taken ill near Paris and died before reaching home. He was about 28 years old; his wife survived him, as did a son, born in 1372, whom Pembroke had never seen.[note 1] Also named John, he would eventually inherit the earldom. Pembroke was buried in Hereford in spring 1375.\n\nJohn married Countess Margaret PLANTAGENET of Pembroke [122012]. Margaret was born on 20 Jul 1346 in Windsor Berkshire England and died in Dec 1361 in Spain at age 15.\n\nNoted events in her life were:\n\n Birth: at Windsor Castle, 20 Jul 1346, Windsor Berkshire England.\n\nJohn next married Annie MAUNY [122009] in 1368.\n\n(Duplicate Line.
