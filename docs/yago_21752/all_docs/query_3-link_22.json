        "text": "Alnwick Castle has been home to the Percy Family for over 700 years. Below, a family member has been chosen to represent each century, in order to give a flavour of the dramatic history of the Percy family which has shaped the castle you see today.\n\nThe Warrior\n\nHarry Hotspur, son of the 1st Earl of Northumberland, was born at Alnwick Castle in 1364 or 1366. He was supremely powerful in combat on land and sea, though sometimes his hot-headedness could lead him into trouble. Leading lightening-quick strikes against the Scots in the borders gained Harry a fearsome reputation and the nickname ‘hotspur’.\n\nHe was immortalised by Shakespeare in his play King Henry IV (Part 1) and killed in battle fighting against that king.\n\nThe Strategist\n\nHenry trod a careful path through the various conflicts, uprisings and usurpations of the late 15th century, famously holding back at the Battle of Bosworth thereby helping Henry VII to the throne. In enforcing this king’s policy on taxes, however, he was murdered by a mob near Thirsk.\n\nThe Blessed\n\nThomas lived through a period of great religious turmoil and upheaval, witnessing England’s split with the church of Rome. He rebelled against Queen Elizabeth I in ‘The Rising of the Northern Earls’ and was executed at York, professing the Catholic faith to the end, for which he was later beatified.\n\nThe Diplomat\n\nAlgernon Percy was a man of high principle, who steered a solitary path through the mire of the English Civil War. He was also a connoisseur and patron of fine art, who laid the foundation of the collection today.\n\nThe Romantic\n\nElizabeth Percy was responsible for Alnwick Castle becoming a family residence. Her romantic ideas about her ‘braw rough ancestors’ and her passion for the castle and landscape were matched by the vision of her husband, Sir Hugh Smithson. Together they restored Alnwick Castle and transformed the surrounding countryside.\n\nThe Enlightened\n\nAlgernon served in the navy from age 12 to 23, going on to become a great traveller and explorer. On inheriting the dukedom, aged 50, he had enjoyed a wealth of experience, with interests in astronomy, archaeology, art, architecture and technology, which influenced his restoration of the castle, improvement of the estates and numerous public benefactions.\n\nThe Wise\n\nHugh was duke of Northumberland for 48 years, serving with the Northumberland Hussars during the Second World War. In the harsh financial climate of post-war Britain, his judicious management of the estates provided great stability and continuity."
