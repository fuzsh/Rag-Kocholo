Co-written, directed and starring Marty Feldman (The Last Remake of Beau Geste), In God We Trust is an audacious and comedic look at organized religion. Brother Ambrose (Feldman) is sent on a quest to come up with $5,000 to save his monastery. He travels to Los Angeles where he meets a con man (Peter Boyle, Young Frankenstein), a prostitute (Louise Lasser, Take the Money and Run) and a shady televangelist (Andy Kaufman, Heartbeeps) who sees Ambrose as a way to make even more money for his Church of Divine Profit. It’s a laughter-filled quest to see if Brother Ambrose will succeed or be led away by the temptations placed in his way. Co-starring Wilfrid Hyde-White (My Fair Lady) and comedy legend Richard Pryor (Bustin’ Loose) as G.O.D.
