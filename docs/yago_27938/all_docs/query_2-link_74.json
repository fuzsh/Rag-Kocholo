        "text": "103: The Mad Monster\n\nby Trey Yeatts\n\nDale Van Sickel never made a bad film. –He never made a real film.\n\nDale Van Sickel (1907-1977) was a college sports hero who became a prolific stuntman and actor. His first onscreen role was in the Marx Brothers’ 1933 classic Duck Soup. He had small, often uncredited roles in films like Gone with the Wind, War of the Worlds, and North by Northwest, but it was his work as a stuntman in the Republic serials and on television that made his reputation in Hollywood.\n\nWillard Scott reloaded his cheese pistol.\n\nWillard Scott (1934-2021) was a weatherman best known for working on NBC’s The Today Show, beginning in 1980. In 1983, he started the tradition of wishing centenarians (and older folk) happy birthdays during his segments. Fewer people know that from 1959 to 1962, Scott played Bozo the Clown on Washington, D.C., TV station WRC, and in 1963, he appeared in three commercials as Ronald McDonald, the Hamburger-Happy Clown—the first live-action appearance of the character.\n\nIsn’t that Marty Feldman?\n\nMarty Feldman (1934-1982) was a British comedian of small stature easily recognized for his bulging, wonky eyes (caused by Graves’ Disease). He was a member of the influential BBC sketch comedy series At Last the 1948 Show in the 1960s; later hosted his own show on ABC, The Marty Feldman Comedy Machine; and starred in the films The Adventure of Sherlock Holmes’ Smarter Brother, Young Frankenstein, and Silent Movie.\n\nGuns by Vidal Sassoon.\n\nVidal Sassoon (1928-2012) was a British hairstylist who created influential hairstyles in the 1960s, including the popular bob, and developed hair care products that were sold by Procter & Gamble beginning in the early 1980s. He was also politically active; the son of Jewish immigrants, he fought right-wing anti-Semitic groups in Britain as a teenager and founded a research center dedicated to anti-Semitism.\n\nLobby. First floor. Tobacconist. Newspapers.\n\nFor many years, manually operated elevators in high-rise buildings required employees who manipulated the lever. In department stores, the operator would often announce to the elevator’s passengers what products and services were available on each floor.\n\nAmazing. –You’ll believe a man can fly.\n\n“You’ll believe a man can fly” was the advertising slogan for the 1978 film Superman: The Movie, based on the movie’s revolutionary visual effects.\n\nMeanwhile, back in Mesa Verde.\n\nThe phrase “Meanwhile, back at _____” originated with cards inserted in silent films of the early 20th century. In westerns, this was often “Meanwhile, back at the ranch ...” Once audio became a common component, the phrase was still used by narrators in films and radio and television shows.\n\nI’ll be in my trailer. Hope there’s some deli food left. And no brown M&Ms this time!\n\nM&Ms are a brand of candy-coated chocolates manufactured by Mars Inc. They were first sold in 1941. The mention of “no brown M&Ms” refers to an infamous contract rider employed by rock band Van Halen in their heyday. Among the various technical requests they made of their venues’ operators, they asked for a bowl of M&Ms with the brown ones removed. This was not an exercise of pointless vanity but a test to see if their hosts had thoroughly read the contract. On occasions when there were brown M&Ms in the bowl, the band found that technical errors plagued the show, including one performance in Pueblo, Colorado, where the venue literally wasn’t prepared for the weight of the production. The stage setup sank through the floor, causing $80,000 in damage, and David Lee Roth trashed the dressing room. Press reports claimed he petulantly destroyed the room because of the brown M&Ms, thus beginning the legend. As Roth put it in his autobiography, “Well, who am I to get in the way of a good rumor?”\n\n“What did you find out about the ray guns?” –Ron and Nancy?\n\nRonald Reagan (1911-2004) and his second wife, Nancy, were America’s “First Couple” from 1981 to 1989. Ronald was an actor for decades before he became California’s governor (1967-1975) and then was elected president in 1980.\n\nWhy did we bring that, anyway? –Who’s gonna be first? –They got it from Dennis Hopper, I think.\n\nDennis Hopper (1936-2010) was an actor known for his hippie ways and roles in Easy Rider (1969), Apocalypse Now (1979), and Blue Velvet (1986). In the last film, Hopper played a crazed sociopath, Frank Booth, who frequently inhaled from a portable gas tank and forced himself on women. It was often assumed that Frank was inhaling nitrous oxide, but a 2002 special edition of the film identified it as amyl nitrite (poppers).\n\nOh, so they’re both walking this time. –Walking on the moon.\n\nA reference to the Police song “Walking on the Moon.” Sample lyrics: “Giant steps are what you take/Walking on the moon/I hope my legs don't break/Walking on the moon …”\n\nHow come they got Groucho Marx moustaches on their helmets?\n\nGroucho Marx (1890-1977) was an American comedian known for his rapier wit, glasses, cigar, and heavily painted eyebrows and moustache. He was considered the leader of the Marx Brothers, with whom he appeared in thirteen films. He later hosted the radio and television game show You Bet Your Life, without the exaggerated makeup, although he did grow a neat moustache of his own.\n\nHey, Diana Ross is playing at Caesars Palace.\n\nDiana Ross is a singer and actress best known for being a member of the Motown R&B group The Supremes (later billed as Diana Ross & the Supremes). She had a successful solo career and a film career, starring in Lady Sings the Blues (1972) and The Wiz (1978). Caesars Palace is a famed casino and luxury hotel in Las Vegas well known for having top performers as semi-permanent musical acts. It opened in 1966.\n\nLet’s see, just hook up that nitrous oxide to the air intake shaft. Then we can do some serious dental work in there. –What’s he gonna do? Take out their fillings and serve them really cold drinks? –Maybe it’s helium and they’ll all sound like the Munchkins.\n\nMunchkins are the small people who reside in Munchkinland in L. Frank Baum’s classic children’s book The Wizard of Oz (and the 1939 film, too, natch). In the film, the Munchkins’ singing voices were dubbed by professional singers with the recording sped up slightly, accounting for that odd, high-pitched effect.\n\nJust give him a headbutt. Give him a headbutt. He’s just wearing spandex on his head.\n\nSpandex (also known as Lycra or elastane) was developed by DuPont’s Joseph Shivers in 1959. The name originates with the fiber’s elasticity: “spandex” is an anagram of “expands.”\n\nThat’s for Bryant Gumbel. That’s for Gene Shalit. And that’s for dressing up like Carmen Miranda. God, that was dumb.\n\nBryant Gumbel is a journalist best known for co-hosting NBC’s The Today Show for fifteen years, primarily in the 1980s. Gene Shalit is the longtime film, theater, and art critic on The Today Show. He has famously wild, dark, curly hair. Carmen Miranda (1909-1955) was a Brazilian dancer and singer popular in the 1940s and ‘50s who is best remembered for wearing piles of fruit on top of her head.\n\nThose are all Bob Mackie creations, aren’t they?\n\nBob Mackie is a fashion designer known for spectacular and outrageous outfits that have clung to the bodies of some of America’s most famous divas, including Diana Ross, Cher, Madonna, and Bette Midler. He has also worked in costume design on films, television shows, and stage plays.\n\nI’ve never seen so much lava lamps in my life.\n\nLava lamps are an icon of 1960s culture, featuring a diamond-shaped glass tube filled with colored water and a waxy ooze that, when heated by a light bulb, flows around the lamp in undulating patterns that are extremely fascinating to people under the influence of mind-altering chemicals. They are manufactured by Haggerty Enterprises.\n\nHope he remembers what level he parked on. I’m in the Moon Man lot.\n\nAt the various Walt Disney theme parks—Disneyland, Walt Disney World, etc.—the parking lots are designated not by letters or numbers but by the names of Disney characters: the Goofy lot, the Mickey lot, the Pluto lot, and so on.\n\nIt’s the moon car. And it’s filled with evil Michelin men. –What a goofy-looking vehicle.\n\nThe Michelin Man is an advertising figure for Michelin tires; designed in 1898, he is intended to look as if he is made out of a stack of tires. His given name is Bibendum, which first appeared in 1908. Want to know why he’s white? Before 1912, rubber tires were beige or grey-white. Modern tires are black because carbon is added to the rubber to strengthen them.\n\nThey better hurry. They got to get that back to the amusement park. It’s an E ticket ride, you know.\n\nAn “E ticket” (or “E coupon”) comes from the Disney theme park admission system that allowed the holder of the ticket to ride or see the newest or most popular attractions. The system was revamped and E coupons abandoned in 1982. People still refer to especially thrilling/prestigious/expensive experiences as “E ticket rides”; astronaut Sally Ride famously labeled the space shuttle one in 1983.\n\nIs it just me or do those guys look like the crash dummies? –You could learn a lot from a dummy. Buckle up.\n\nThe spokesdummies Vince and Larry were two crash test dummies used in an extensive public service announcement campaign for seat belt use throughout the 1980s. The slogan used at the end of each PSA was “You could learn a lot from a dummy. Buckle up.”\n\nThat thing’s really gonna come in handy when Alan Shepard gets to the moon. It’ll make a swell golf cart.\n\nAlan Shepard (1923-1998) was an astronaut and the first American in space. A decade later, he commanded the Apollo 14 mission to the moon and was the fifth person to walk on its surface. He was the first person to play low-gravity golf on the moon when he smuggled golf balls and a six-iron head aboard. He attached the driver head to the handle of his lunar sample scoop and hit two balls “miles and miles and miles,” as he put it.\n\nGet in the Hershey’s head kiss of death.\n\nHershey’s Kisses are small, foil-wrapped, flat-bottomed teardrop-shaped chocolate candies made by Hershey. They were first made in 1907 and got their name from the way the molten chocolate is placed on the conveyor belt during production.\n\nKinda looks like an electric razor. –Even our name says “Merry Christmas.”\n\nIn a 1970s animated holiday season television commercial for Norelco electric razors, the line “Even our name says ‘Merry Christmas’” was used and the name intentionally misspelled on screen as “Noëlco.”\n\nYou know, that constant heat sounds a lot like a Chevy horn.\n\nChevy is the short name for automaker Chevrolet. It was founded in 1911 and bought by General Motors in 1917.\n\nIt’s a big rock candy mountain.\n\n“Big Rock Candy Mountain” is a song recorded by Harry McClintock in 1928, who claimed to have written it decades before when he was a train-hopping hobo. His version was a tad more risqué than the popular ones released by Burl Ives in 1949 and by Dorsey Burnette in 1960.\n\nSnack Canyon!\n\nIn the late 1970s, the AMC theater chain used to show an animated ad for their snack bar called “Snack Canyon,” in which a group of penguins stumble across Snack Canyon and revel in all the treats available there.\n\nIt’s the Land of Dairy Queen, and the river of chocolate is coming right for you.\n\nA reference to an old advertising jingle for the Dairy Queen chain of restaurants: “In the land of Dairy Queen, we treat you right!” Commercials for the chain in the 1970s featured close-ups of sundae toppings as though they were mountains and, yes, rivers of chocolate and fudge.\n\nIsn’t that lava? I guess they’d be cooked but their hands would be clean. Pumice action.\n\nLava soap is a heavy-duty hand cleaner originally developed by the Waltke Company in 1893. Currently, it’s manufactured by WD-40. The soap contains ground pumice to act as an abrasive in cleaning the skin.\n\nAcme Coyote Transfuser.\n\nIn the world of Warner Bros.’ Looney Tunes shorts, Acme is the fictional corporation that manufactures just about everything. Most famously, their name appeared on the side of nearly every contraption Wile E. Coyote ever used to try and catch that Road Runner. In reality, “Acme” became a popular prefix for company names in the 1920s, as alphabetized phone directories were first printed and they strove to be listed as close as possible to the front of the book. As for why the name was used in Looney Tunes, it’s unknown. In Greek “acme” means “the prime,” so perhaps it’s ironic. It could be an acronym for “A Company that Makes Everything.” Or it could be named after the Acme Company, which made a line of highly regarded animation stands.\n\nHey, it’s Bill Bixby as Lou Ferrigno.\n\nBill Bixby (1934-1993) played Dr. David Banner on the CBS TV series The Incredible Hulk (1977-1982). Whenever someone made him angry (and you wouldn’t like him when he’s angry), his clothes ripped, he put colored contact lenses in and became a green-skinned Lou Ferrigno. Ferrigno is a former bodybuilder, Mr. America, and Mr. Universe (times two) who has become known for cameoing as himself in various films and TV shows.\n\nI could’ve had a V8.\n\nV8 is a beverage made of blended vegetable juices. It was first produced in 1933 and is now manufactured by the Campbell Soup Company. In the 1980s, Campbell's ran a series of commercials in which people regretted their beverage choices, exclaiming in chagrin, \"I could've had a V8!\"\n\nHair designs by Shemp Howard.\n\nShemp Howard (1895-1955), along with his brothers Curly and Moe, was an off-again, on-again member of the comedy trio the Three Stooges. Shemp was a Stooge until 1930, when Curly replaced him; he returned in 1946 after Curly had a stroke and remained with the group until his death nine years later.\n\n[Sung.] Rock-a-bye monster, on the little bed ... –When you wake up, some townsfolk will be dead.\n\nA paraphrasing of the lyrics to “Rock-a-bye Baby,” an English lullaby first published around 1765. Various theories exist as to the lyrics’ meaning, with the most popular labeling it a political commentary on King James II’s infant son, who, rumor had it, was actually someone else’s baby, smuggled into the royal nursery in desperation when the king needed an heir to the throne.\n\nLooks kinda like Fred Travalena now. –Kinda. He’s growing hair. My God, he’s turned him into Abe Lincoln! –The rail splitter. –Wow.\n\nFred Travalena (1942-2009) was a Vegas mainstay, known as the Man of a Thousand Faces for his impersonations of public figures. He was a regular on television comedies and game shows throughout the 1970s and ‘80s. Abraham Lincoln (1809-1865) was the sixteenth president of the United States, who guided the nation through the Civil War (1861-1865) and was assassinated shortly after its end by disgruntled Southerner John Wilkes Booth. He was nicknamed “The Rail Splitter” during the 1860 campaign after some of his supporters displayed portions of a fence Lincoln had supposedly constructed thirty years prior. This gave Lincoln the appearance of being a hard worker and not a soft white collar lawyer.\n\nIsaac Asimov. –Lecherous scientist. –Amish farmer. Quaker Oats man.\n\nIsaac Asimov (1920-1992) was a highly respected science-fiction novelist and science writer best known for his Foundation trilogy. Along with Robert Heinlein and Arthur C. Clarke, he was considered one of the “Big Three” of science fiction. The Amish are a conservative Christian sect found predominantly in North America; there is a large population of Amish in Pennsylvania. They are known for their plain, old-fashioned manner of dress and their rejection of much modern technology, including electricity and cars. The logo on the Quaker Oats canister, painted by Haddon Sundblom around 1940, is of a man dressed in traditional Quaker garb, who somewhat resembles Benjamin Franklin. While some people have believed him to be William Penn, the founder of Pennsylvania, who was a leading Quaker, the company has stated that he is simply meant to be a generic Quaker gentleman.\n\nDr. Cornelius from Planet of the Apes.\n\nPlanet of the Apes is a 1968 film co-written by Rod Serling and starring Charlton Heston as an astronaut trapped on a world where apes are the rulers and humans are the slaves. Cornelius was a scientist chimpanzee featured in the first three films. He was played by Roddy McDowall in films one and three and by David Watson in film two.\n\nA cure for baldness at last. I’m calling it “Helsinki Formula.”\n\nHelsinki Formula is a brand of “scalp health” products, including shampoos, cleansers, and baldness aversion creams.\n\nNow Bingo is his name-o.\n\n“Bingo” (also titled “Bingo Was His Name-O” or “There Was a Farmer Who Had a Dog”) is an English folk song that dates back to the late 1700s.\n\nHe looks just like one of the flying monkeys from The Wizard of Oz.\n\nThe flying monkeys are the henchmen of the Wicked Witch of the West in the 1939 film The Wizard of Oz.\n\nHey, it’s William S. Burroughs.\n\nWilliam Burroughs (1914-1997) was a writer of experimental novels, of which the most famous is Naked Lunch. He became one of the seminal voices of the Beat generation in the 1950s.\n\nMr. Mooney. –Gale Gordon.\n\nGale Gordon (1906-1995) was an actor best known for playing Lucille Ball’s foil in her later sitcoms The Lucy Show (where he played the banker Theodore J. Mooney), Here’s Lucy, and Life with Lucy.\n\nHey, it’s Colonel Potter. Harry Morgan.\n\nColonel Sherman T. Potter was the commanding officer at the 4077th on the M*A*S*H TV show (1975-1983). He was played by Harry Morgan, who is also remembered for playing Detective Bill Gannon on Dragnet (1967-1970).\n\n[Sung.] Four blind fools.\n\nA corruption of the three-hundred-year-old English nursery rhyme “Three Blind Mice.” It’s possible that the lyrics date as far back as 1609, and some choose to interpret it as a cunning political allegory relating to the execution of three Protestant bishops by “Bloody” Queen Mary I of England, with the difficulty being that the bishops were not blinded but burned at the stake.\n\nLike the Pentagon.\n\nThe Pentagon is the world’s largest office building, located in Arlington, Virginia, containing the headquarters of the U.S. Department of Defense. Ground was broken for construction on September 11, 1941 (whoa), and it was opened in 1943.\n\nNext comes the Ghost of Christmas Present. –Christmas present? For me?\n\nIn the Charles Dickens novella A Christmas Carol (1843), the Ghost of Christmas Present leads Scrooge through various tableaus of his contemporaries to show how his dickishness impacts them.\n\nWhat’s the matter, boy? Skippy? –I’d say Skippy is what he was eating.\n\nSkippy is a brand of peanut butter first sold in 1933. It is currently produced by Unilever.\n\nHey, he looks okay. Or as okay as he ever will. –I bet his breath is terrible, though. –But his mouth is cleaner than yours or mine.\n\nThis refers to a long-standing legend about the cleanliness of canine mouths versus humans’. While no thorough and definitive research has been done on the subject, what research that has been done shows that, mathematically, there are often fewer bacterial colonies in cultures from dog mouths but the strains of bacteria are more virulent than human cultures. More simply, remember that dogs wipe themselves with their tongues. Not quite so clean.\n\n[Imitating.] Duh, tell me about the rabbits again, George.\n\nOf Mice and Men is a short novel by John Steinbeck about two drifters (George and Lennie), one of whom is very strong but a bit slow in the head (Lennie), who get jobs working on a ranch in California.
