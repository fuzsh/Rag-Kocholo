I bet I'd enjoy it. I noticed that he directed. He also directed The Last Remake Of Beau Geste....which might have been his very last film? It is also a title that doesn't get around much. I saw his Beau Geste in the cinema. I don't know if it even got released on any format other than VHS...? I recorded my copy off Universal HD back before they had commercial breaks in the movies.\n\nI'll put in a Tivo search and see if I can get In God We Trust."
