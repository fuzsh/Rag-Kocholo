        "text": "By Movieguide® Contributor\n\nGOD’S NOT DEAD: IN GOD WE TRUST emphasizes the “relevance of faith in public life,” as well as the importance of standing strong in your beliefs.\n\n“Amid political and spiritual turmoil, Reverend David Hill steps up to run for Congress,” a synopsis of GOD’S NOT DEAD: IN GOD WE TRUST reads. “Opponent Peter Kane, aims to erase religion from policy, and the fight becomes a beacon of hope for people seeking moral leadership in a divided world.”\n\nThe movie stars David A.R. White, Isaiah Washington, Dean Cain and Scott Baio, with White reprising his role as Reverend Hill.\n\n“GOD’S NOT DEAD: IN GOD WE TRUST explores the enduring relevance of faith in public life and the critical fight to keep religious values at the heart of governance,” the movie’s Instagram account posted. “Featuring a star-studded cast and powerful message, this film calls on believers to stand firm in faith and make their voices heard.”\n\nProducer Michael Scott said of the movie, “GOD’S NOT DEAD: IN GOD WE TRUST serves as a bold reminder that complacency can erode our liberties, freedom, and faith when we fail to actively defend and uphold them. If we truly believe in a faithful God who is ‘good all the time,’ we must be willing to speak out and stand firm in our beliefs, even in the face of great risks and opposition.”\n\nGOD’S NOT DEAD: IN GOD WE TRUST was presented at this year’s Cannes Film Festival by Pinnacle Peak Pictures, along with DISCIPLES IN THE MOONLIGHT and AVERAGE JOE.\n\n“The team at Pinnacle Peak Pictures has produced three excellent new films to go along with our library of popular titles,” said Ron Gell, the company’s vice president of international sales and distribution. “Audiences have shown they are hungry for uplifting, suspenseful and dramatic features with top production values and exceptional casts.”\n\nMovieguide® previously reported on the fifth installment in the GOD’S NOT DEAD franchise:\n\nPure Flix and Pinnacle Peak Pictures announced news of the next installment in the faith-filled franchise, GOD’S NOT DEAD: RISE UP, at a red carpet event at AMC Century City in Los Angeles, CA.\n\n“This is a new chapter in the ‘God’s Not Dead’ franchise and we can’t wait to share this with all the fans. I’m still humbled, eight years later, that this type of movie and this message resonates with so many people,” producer and actor David A.R. White said.\n\nWhite plays Reverend Dave in the previous four movies.\n\n“The legacy and impact of ‘God’s Not Dead’ is undeniable and I’m so proud and honored to be a part of this movement,” he added.\n\nThe event also featured other GOD’S NOT DEAD stars like Dean Cain, Isaiah Washington, Cory Oliver and Brad Heller.\n\nGOD’S NOT DEAD: IN GOD WE TRUST will premiere in theaters on Sept. 12."
