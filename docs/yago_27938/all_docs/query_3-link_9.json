R. White, Isaiah Washington, Dean Cain, Samaire Armstrong, Ray Wise, Charlene Tilton, Scott Baio with guest appearances by Mike Huckabee, Raymond Arroyo, and Newsboys.\n\nLos Angeles, CA. June 25, 2024: Pinnacle Peak Pictures in association with Great American Pure Flix, is excited to announce the exclusive cinema premiere of God’s Not Dead: In God We Trust on September 12, 2024. The highly anticipated film, featuring a stellar cast and notable guest appearances, delves into the complex relationship between faith, politics, and our civic responsibilities, and will be distributed to theaters nationwide through Fathom.\n\nGod’s Not Dead: In God We Trust is a politically riveting fight for freedom starring Isaiah Washington (Grey’s Anatomy), David A. R. White (GOD’S NOT DEAD, Evening Shade), Dean Cain (Lois & Clark), Samaire Armstrong, (The O.C.), Ray Wise (ROBO COP), Scott Baio (Happy Days), Charlene Tilton (Dallas), with guest appearances by Governor Mike Huckabee, Raymond Arroyo (EWTN’s The World Over with Raymond Arroyo), and Grammy Award -Winning band Newsboys.\n\nThe first film in the God’s Not Dead franchise, released in 2014 with a modest $1.5 million budget, grossed over $65 million at the box office, establishing itself as one of the most successful faith-based films of all time. The franchise’s success has continued with subsequent films, collectively grossing over $100 million worldwide, underscoring its enduring popularity and impact.\n\nIn a society saturated with discussions about democracy, representation, and equality, it is alarming to note that 40 million Christians do not vote. This startling statistics should inspire people of faith to recognize the power of their voices and the importance of exercising their right to vote.\n\nSet in a time of political and spiritual upheaval, God’s Not Dead: In God We Trust follows Reverend David Hill as he runs for Congress following the sudden death of an incumbent. Facing a powerful adversary intent on removing religion from governance, the film emphasizes the significance of religious values in shaping policy and governance. It delivers a compelling call for audiences to exercise their God-given right to vote and make their voices heard.\n\nProducer Michael Scott states, “God’s Not Dead: In God We Trust serves as a bold reminder that complacency can erode our liberties, freedom, and faith when we fail to actively defend and uphold them. If we truly believe in a faithful God who is ‘good all the time,’ we must be willing to speak out and stand firm in our beliefs, even in the face of great risks and opposition.”\n\nThe trailer is now available at www.GodsNotDead.com, and ticketing will be available soon at Fathom’s web site.\n\nGod’s Not Dead: In God We Trust is directed by Vance Null and written by Tommy Blaze.\n\nThe executive producers are Michael Scott, David A. R. White, Jim Ameduri, Kendall Baldwin, Shawn Boskie, and Troy Duhon and producers are Brenton Earley and Isaiah Washington.\n\nGod’s Not Dead: In God We Trust promises to be a politically riveting fight for freedom, featuring a powerful ensemble cast and a message that resonates with today’s socio-political climate. Be sure to mark your calendars for September 12, 2024, to witness this thought-provoking film.\n\nCAST:\n\nReverend Dave Hill: David A. R.

Following the unexpected death of a favored congressional incumbent, David feels compelled to enter the race, challenging the increasing efforts to remove religious influence from public policy. Facing off against state senator Peter Kane, a formidable opponent determined to create greater division by pushing religion out of the public square, David must navigate the treacherous waters of modern politics, where his faith, optimism, and principles are put to the ultimate test. As he confronts adversaries from his past and faces relentless scrutiny, David’s campaign becomes a beacon of hope for many who yearn for spiritual and moral leadership in a divided nation.
