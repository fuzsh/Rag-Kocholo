        "text": "Remember him in an old British movie early 70s and he's running across a beach with a topless beauty. I think her name was Julie Ege.\n\nWhat a contrast a wee ugly guy and a stunning topless Scandinavian.\n\nThink that film was on the talking pictures channel recently.\n\nAnd now I want to watch Young Frankenstein again. He was magnificent in that.\n\nDesert Island Film for me. Amazing piece of film on every level.\n\nI never realised he was only 48 when he died.\n\nTo be fair, even as a child, he looked 48\n\nOne of my all time favourite sketches.\n\nPlay the ball as it lies! They ripped off the idea 20 years later for Mr Bean."
