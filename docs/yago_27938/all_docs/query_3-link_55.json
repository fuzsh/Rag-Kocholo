        "text": "God of War is a 2024 American dark fantasy action-thriller film based on the God of War video game series, distributed by Sony Pictures Releasing, and produced by Sony Pictures Columbia Pictures Sony Pictures Animation PlayStation Productions in association with Regency Enterprises WingNut Films and Vanguard Films It is directed by Quentin Tarantino, and produced by the producers of 300 (Mark Canton, Bernie Goldmann, Gianni Nunnari, John H. Williams, Kristine Belson and Jeffrey Silver). It stars Dave Bautista, Rose Byrne, Ben Mendelsohn, Ty Burrell, Benedict Cumberbatch, Florian Munteanu, Milla Jovovich, Andy Serkis, Glenn Close, and Anthony Hopkins.\n\nPlot\n\nKratos waged war at the behest of Ares, eventually leading an attack on a village occupied by worshipers of Athena. Unknown to Kratos, Ares had secretly transported Kratos' wife and daughter to the village; during his frenzied attack on its temple, Kratos accidentally killed them. Although Ares believed this act would free Kratos to become the perfect warrior, the Spartan instead renounced his pledge of servitude to the god. The oracle of the destroyed village cursed Kratos by bonding the ashes of his dead family to his skin, turning it ash-white and earning him the nickname, \"Ghost of Sparta\". Plagued by nightmares of his horrible deed, Kratos vowed to serve the other gods in hope of ridding himself of the visions.\n\nTen years have passed, and Kratos still serves the Olympians by fulfilling hazardous missions as a means of redemption.\n\nMore coming soon...\n\nMid/Post-Credit Scenes\n\nCast\n\nTBD\n\nProduction\n\nA film adaptation of God of War was announced in 2005. Nearly one week prior to the release of God of War II in the United States, creator David Jaffe confirmed that a completed script had been penned by David Self and would be sending it out to an unspecified \"huge-name director.\" Jaffe also expressed interest in seeing actor Djimon Hounsou in the role of the protagonist, Kratos. \"You'd have to get past the fact that Djimon is black, and Kratos isn't, but in terms of the way he looks and his acting ability and his physique â€” I can't think of a better choice.\" Fans all over the globe have displayed support.\n\nIn September 2009, Brett Ratner confirmed he was working on a God of War film, with Stig Asmussen later stating he had no part in its creative control, and didn't really know where the film was headed. Asmussen then issued the following statement:\n\n\"I don't believe anything other than a script has transpired at this stage. I think as part of the agreement that (the movie studio) is supposed to (consult us), so if we hear something, than we'll know. But at this point and in the past two years, we've heard nothing.\"\n\nDavid Jaffe, creator of God of War, thinks it's very doubtful the film is going anywhere, since it has been over two years, and nothing had been heard since. Sony Santa Monica's director of product development John Hight added he thinks it's part of the agreement that a studio is supposed to consult them if anything would happen, so they would know.\n\nIt has been confirmed that a God of War movie is in production. UGO caught up with God of War creator David Jaffe and God of War 3 game director Stig Asmussen about what's going on with the movie.\n\nVideos\n\nFile:God of War movie confirmed"
