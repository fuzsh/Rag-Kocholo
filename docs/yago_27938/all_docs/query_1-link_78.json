        "text": "During every New York Knicks home game, the scoreboard at Madison Square Garden displays a message asking fans to refrain from disruptive behavior. It is a reasonable request, but on a recent night it was not enough to dissuade a wiry man with a beard and a ball cap, who was standing up, cupping his hands around his mouth, and yelling, “Hey, Aaron! Aaron Smith!”\n\nA security guard, a few rows closer to the court, gestured downward with his palms: Quiet, please.\n\n“I’m just trying to get my friend’s attention,” the man said.\n\n“Text him,” the guard said.\n\n“I can’t,” the man said. “He’s reffing.”\n\nAaron Smith was indeed one of the referees that night, working a pre-season game between the Knicks and the New Orleans Pelicans. But the man shouting his name was not a friend, just a mischievous Googler—who also happens to be one of the most acclaimed film directors in the world. His name is Josh Safdie, and he is thirty-five; he and his brother, Benny Safdie, who is two years younger, have directed a series of movies that have been increasingly ambitious and increasingly popular. In 2017, they made “Good Time,” starring Robert Pattinson, a jittery, hallucinatory crime drama, which, once you got over the jitters, was perhaps also a comedy. Their latest, “Uncut Gems,” is a hectic and soulful film largely set in New York’s Diamond District, and starring Adam Sandler as Howard Ratner, a gem dealer and sports gambler who spends two hours making progressively more frantic transactions, in search of a payoff big enough to retroactively justify the risks. Variety compared the film, admiringly, to a “protracted heart attack,” though the Safdie brothers seem to think of it, like its predecessors, as a loving and realistic portrait of their home town. Residents and visitors alike routinely complain that the city is not as interesting as it used to be; the Safdies’ work is devoted to the proposition that any place can be interesting, especially New York, provided you look carefully enough.\n\nIt was a few weeks before the opening of “Uncut Gems,” and the Safdie brothers had taken a break from pre-release screenings (Telluride, Toronto, the New York Film Festival) to steal a glimpse of Zion Williamson, the Pelicans’ No. 1 draft pick. The Safdies are obsessive about basketball; in “Uncut Gems,” Howard’s fortunes rise and fall with the outcomes of the games he bets on. But Williamson had foiled their plans by tearing his meniscus, so the brothers had to find other ways to entertain themselves. Of the two, Josh Safdie tends to be the instigator, driven by instinct and daring. Near one of the baselines, he spotted James Dolan, the team’s widely reviled owner, sitting next to a muscle-bound young man whom he recognized as Dolan’s son, Quentin, a bodybuilder, to whom Safdie had once anonymously AirDropped a photograph of a monster flashing a devil’s-horn sign—he likes sending strange pictures to strangers.\n\nA young boy was sitting directly in front of the Safdies, and Josh made a semi-successful effort to moderate his language. (“Move the ball! What the fuck are you doing?”) Seated next to the boy was a man eating French fries, who soon became the unwitting star of a short film. Josh, raising his iPhone, zoomed in on the man’s fingers: he was neatly applying a line of ketchup to each fry, like toothpaste on a toothbrush. The brothers are always looking for ways to combine scripted storytelling with scenes from everyday life. They typically cast experienced actors alongside first-timers, which is to say, “real people”—although the Safdies would probably object that the term insults the first-timers, by implying that they’re not acting, and also the professionals, by implying that they’re not “real.” Still, viewers who found themselves transfixed by the faintly menacing professionalism of the bail bondsman in “Good Time” might have been pleased to discover that he was played by the proprietor of American Liberty Bail Bonds, in Kew Gardens, Queens.\n\nSometimes the Safdies seem to know everyone in the city, although not everyone in the city knows them. When they were recognized at Madison Square Garden, during the fourth quarter, it was by a student from New York University’s graduate film program. “I just want to say, you guys are my favorite filmmakers in the world,” he said, before shyly sprinting away.\n\n“I swear to God we didn’t plan that,” said Benny Safdie, who is short-haired and clean-shaven, and a bit bigger than Josh. Benny is the quieter of the two, but he is the more dedicated performer. For a few years he tormented the city’s comedy clubs, in character as a fretful failed comedian named Ralph Handel; naturally, the brothers captured these appearances on film. (Nowadays, Benny’s schedule is slightly less flexible: he is married, with two young sons.) When the brothers are on set, Josh generally takes a position behind the monitors, shouting out suggestions to the actors. Benny customarily holds the boom microphone, talking quietly to the actors and—directly into the microphone—even more quietly to his brother.\n\n“Yo, Kane!” Josh shouted. “Kane Fitzgerald!” He had identified another referee.\n\n“I’m telling you, they’re like the Queen’s guard,” Benny said. “They’re not going to pay attention.”\n\n“No—I’m telling you, I get them,” Josh said.\n\n“Enough,” the guard finally said, sternly.\n\nJosh turned plaintive. “We’re not allowed to cheer?”\n\nWhen the game was over—a one-point Knicks loss, not that it mattered—Josh couldn’t resist descending a few rows to talk to the guard who had shushed him. Like many people who like to get into a bit of trouble, Josh has a corresponding knack for talking himself out of it. The guard, turning conspiratorial, told him, “If it was me, I don’t give a shit. It’s an N.B.A. rule. You’re not allowed to bother the refs, and you can’t bother the players during time-outs.”\n\nThe brothers were listening intently, but they were also watching, noting not just the guard’s pungent white-New York accent but also the fit of his jacket, and the purposeful way he gripped the railing when he descended to the section below. Maybe one of these days they’ll need someone to play a Madison Square Garden security guard.\n\n“Sandman!” Josh Safdie said, picking up his phone. “What’s going on?” He and his brother were in a sound studio in midtown, making last-minute alterations to “Uncut Gems.” On the screen, an image of Sandler, in character as Howard, was frozen in mid-patter. Josh talked quietly for a few minutes, then hung up and turned to his brother. “Sandler couldn’t believe we were back in the mix,” he said. The Safdies love crosstalk and ambient sound; they hate the idea of forcing actors to deliver credible dialogue in artificial silence. Now they were preparing a special mix for the Dolby Atmos system, which allows filmmakers to create the sensation that sounds are emanating from specific places in a room.\n\nFor years, the brothers were do-it-yourself visionaries, finding ingenious ways to make their little movies seem big; they used the city as their soundstage in part because it was free. When they began shooting “Uncut Gems,” last year, Josh was annoyed to see that his crew had posted flyers with filming permits on Forty-seventh Street; he was hoping to keep a low profile, in order to capture life in the district. Then he saw the platoon of trucks parked around the corner and remembered that he was involved in a major production, much too big to be surreptitious. For street scenes, the Safdies assembled about a hundred extras, who mingled with people going about their business. If the extras caught someone gawking at Sandler, or at the camera, they were instructed to create a simple distraction: approach the gawker and, posing as a tourist, ask for directions to the nearest subway station.\n\n“This is very new—this whole experience,” Benny Safdie said. For “Uncut Gems,” they commissioned a score by the electronic musician Daniel Lopatin, who records as Oneohtrix Point Never. The sound is neoclassical, inspired, at various points, by Haydn’s Symphony No. 88 and by Vangelis, the pioneering synthesizer wizard. And yet the most memorable sound is the raspy buzzer of Howard’s shop, which serves as the film’s irregular heartbeat. On this day, the brothers were trying to make the mix a little clearer, to allow viewers to separate the voices from the noise. They worked for a long time on a moment near the end of the first act, when an African-American character named Demany, played by Lakeith Stanfield, issues a pithy summation of Howard, the hero: “He just a fuckin’ crazy-ass Jew.”\n\nThe Safdie brothers spent a decade trying to make “Uncut Gems,” driven by their abiding affection for Howard, who is, some early reviewers have noticed, something of an asshole. A critic on IndieWire called him “the most contemptible character” Sandler has ever played, which means that he outranks both title characters of “Jack and Jill,” Sandler’s 2011 comedy, about a man with an annoying sister, which currently has a three-per-cent positive rating on the review site Rotten Tomatoes. Sandler says that he was impressed by the script for “Uncut Gems,” but initially puzzled by the brothers’ reverence for Howard. “They loved him,” Sandler recalls. “On the front page, it says ‘In Howard We Trust.’ ” In the film, Howard is incorrigible, seemingly intent on destroying his family and his business. “It took me a minute,” Sandler says, “because he feels selfish to me. But something that really helped me was—they were, like, ‘Yeah, he does selfish shit, but he’s a dreamer. He wants his big day. He sees other people getting their ass kissed and he wants his own big moment.’ ”\n\nThe Safdies’ father, Alberto, a Sephardic Jew who grew up in Italy and France before moving to New York, worked for a time as a runner and a salesman on Forty-seventh Street, bringing jewelry from the district to shops in the boroughs; he would come home with stories of all the Howards he met. Alberto Safdie was by all accounts an unpredictable father; the brothers remember spending days at home alone, locked in a small bedroom, with a pile of comic books and basketball cards. But he transmitted to his sons an attention to the characters of the city, and an obsession with film. Not long after Benny was born, Alberto bought a video camera and began making home movies. In search of exciting footage, he would send the boys hurtling down too-steep ski slopes, or goad them into reënacting fights from the previous day. Sometimes they became aware that he had been secretly filming them, which made them both self-conscious and curious. Which moments did their father consider worth filming? Partly in self-defense, they started commandeering the camera to make their own films: goofy horror movies, parody documentaries, even an anti-smoking propaganda film, starring Josh as a smoker who suddenly dies.\n\nAlberto split with the boys’ mother, Amy, when the brothers were young; to explain the situation, he instructed them to watch “Kramer vs. Kramer,” the brutal 1979 custody drama, leaving them to work out for themselves the complicated relationship between the filmed world and the real world. The Safdies spent their boyhood shuttling between Queens, with their father, and Manhattan, where their mother lived with their stepfather, who worked in finance. Their upbringing was “very fucked up,” Josh says, but they endured—becoming, in Benny’s words, “not just normal brothers” but also fellow-survivors. They graduated from Columbia Grammar and Preparatory School, a private institution on the Upper West Side; in the early two-thousands, they arrived, a year apart, at Boston University. By then, they had co-founded a do-it-yourself filmmaking collective called Red Bucket, and begun paying special attention to films that blurred the line between fiction and documentary. Their boyhood favorites had included action movies like “48 Hrs.”; now they were discovering films like “Close-Up,” from 1990, by the Iranian director Abbas Kiarostami, who used both archival footage and reënactment to tell the real story of an obsessive fan who impersonated a celebrated director. In Boston, they studied with Ted Barron, a historian of contemporary independent American film, who was impressed by their industriousness. “They were always making stuff,” Barron says. “The other students would only make films when they were told to.”\n\nThis was the era of “Jackass,” the MTV show built around silly and painful stunts, and the Safdie brothers’ early work could be prankish. In one short film from 2008, which they describe as a “social experiment,” Benny plays a dickish businessman on a city bus, voicing increasing annoyance at a crying baby; eventually a long-haired Good Samaritan pushes him out the rear door, to the delight of fellow-passengers. Most of the people were innocent bystanders, but the Samaritan was a friend of the Safdies’, Casey Neistat, who was then emerging as a kind of online auteur. (Neistat and his brother Van made imaginative viral videos, including one in which Van illegally bicycled through the Holland Tunnel; a few years later, they got an HBO show.) Neistat remembers the Safdies as adventurous but cerebral. “They were coming from a far more informed, intellectual, kind of academic side of the film world,” he says. It’s not hard to imagine a longer Safdie film that followed the baby’s mother, slightly freaked out by the outburst that interrupted her ordinary day.\n\nBenny Safdie graduated in 2008, but he skipped the ceremony to fly to Cannes, where his short film “Acquaintances of a Lonely John” was screened, alongside Josh’s début feature, “The Pleasure of Being Robbed.” The films had been selected independently, and the programmers were surprised to find that the two directors were brothers. The early Safdie films were nearly twee, because the main characters tended to be wistful and a little restless. (In “Lonely John,” Benny plays an unmoored young man with a small apartment who likes to hang out at his local gas station.) But the brothers were determined to avoid easy sentiment and easily sympathetic characters. After Cannes, with some financing from a French company, they started work on an unabashedly autobiographical project, “Daddy Longlegs”: a feature about a young father, loving but wildly unreliable, trying to make it through a two-week visit with his two young sons. The mood shifted unpredictably from playful nostalgia to menace and back again, or nearly back again; once you’ve seen a character chopping up a sleeping pill to keep his children in bed longer, it’s difficult to view him as a well-meaning guy trying his best.\n\nOne afternoon, at a cheap Thai restaurant in midtown, Josh Safdie tried to explain his complicated feelings about his chosen profession. “I think movies are against nature,” he said. “It’s the most perverted art form.” He was talking about how filmmakers manipulate the world around them, using viewers’ voyeurism to trick them into caring about an invented reality. “It’s trying to replicate life,” he said. “Which is fucked up—and so powerful.”\n\nThe brothers’ mixed feelings about their medium often center on actors in particular. “Actors have a certain amount of psychotic energy,” Josh says. “They want to be other people.” Instead, the Safdies often cast people who seem incapable of being anything other than themselves. In the new film, Sandler’s girlfriend is played by Julia Fox, a glamorous figure from New York’s downtown bohemia, who is essentially making her acting début as the female lead in one of the year’s most anticipated films. The Safdies have found that a useful tension is generated when professional actors are forced to contend with people playing themselves. “When Adam goes into that jewelry store and talks to two real jewellers, they’re not used to being on camera,” Benny says. “But he’s not used to being in jewelry stores.”\n\nAs the Safdies were casting “Daddy Longlegs,” Josh noticed two young boys on the street who seemed perfect. They turned out to be Sage and Frey Ranaldo, the sons of Lee Ranaldo, the Sonic Youth guitarist, and Leah Singer, an artist; the boys agreed to act in the movie, and their parents appeared as their stepfather and their mother. To play the father, the Safdies cast Ronald Bronstein, who was known for directing an intimate, black-hearted 2007 drama called “Frownland.” Josh met Bronstein on the street, at the SXSW festival, and loved his twitchy energy and his long, expressive face—he bears a faint resemblance to Kramer, from “Seinfeld.”\n\nBronstein had been impressed by one of Safdie’s early short films, “We’re Going to the Zoo,” in which Josh plays a free-spirited hitchhiker. “It was just so light on its feet—it was like a helium balloon,” Bronstein says. “My balloon was filled with lead.” But he had no special interest in acting, and he didn’t want to embarrass himself, so he agreed to star only if he could consult on the script. The brothers agreed, and after the shoot they asked him to help them edit. Bronstein’s performance was widely celebrated: in 2010, he won Breakthrough Actor at the Gotham Independent Film Awards, beating Jennifer Lawrence and Greta Gerwig. But he has done almost no acting since then; instead, he has become the third member of Team Safdie. They have an elegant basic arrangement, Bronstein says: “I write with Josh, Josh directs with Benny, Benny edits with me.”\n\nBronstein has an office at Elara Pictures, the brothers’ production company, a few blocks south of Herald Square. On a recent afternoon, he was sitting in a chair on lime-green carpet, undistracted by the city noises leaking in from two sources: Broadway, through the window, and a cluster of editing screens, through the door. An assistant editor poked his head into the office, wondering whether to take home a copy of “Uncut Gems,” to do more work overnight. Bronstein considered the worst-case scenario. “What if you get mugged on the subway?” he said. “You have no idea how awful it would be.” The film stayed in the office.\n\n“We’re all anxious people, in different ways,” Bronstein says, of himself and of the Safdies. A decade older than the brothers, Bronstein can serve as a figure of restraint. “I don’t get carried away by life as easily as they do,” he says. While the brothers orchestrate spectacles, his job has often been to make sure that quiet, intimate moments ring true. Bronstein describes the difference between the brothers in bluntly Freudian terms. “Josh is maybe the most anally repulsive creator that I’ve ever come across,” he said, admiringly, in a documentary produced by Criterion. “He’s always shitting everything out; he’s also always taking in new influences.” By contrast, he said, “Benny is, like, continence incarnate”—more circumspect, at least most of the time. Bronstein recalled that, when he was trying to film a follow-up to “Frownland,” Benny, who was one of his stars, had a tendency to interrupt rehearsals with bouts of weeping.\n\n“Daddy Longlegs,” their first project together, was a critical hit: in 2010, it won the John Cassavetes Award (given to a film with a budget of less than half a million dollars); in the Times, A. O. Scott called it a “lovely, hair-raising film.” The Safdies imagined that “Uncut Gems” would come next. Josh began hanging out on Forty-seventh Street, trying to penetrate the world of jewellers, while also turning out short films and documentaries. When the brothers were hired by the Turtle Conservancy, a conservationist group, they produced a series of standard celebrity public-service announcements, and then something very different: a four-minute fake documentary about a rare-animal smuggler in a hotel penthouse in Hong Kong, which was so realistic that the Conservancy had to issue a statement reassuring viewers that although the problem was real, the film was make-believe.\n\nOne way of describing the years after “Daddy Longlegs” is to say that the brothers kept getting sidetracked. When a producer asked if they would be interested in looking at some old footage of Lenny Cooke, a legendary New Jersey high-school basketball star who never quite managed a professional career, they said yes, and then found themselves spending years delving into Cooke’s life. The film they made has no narration, and it avoids the temptation to draw any lessons from Cooke’s thrilling boyhood (we see him scoring over a fellow-phenomenon, LeBron James) or his bittersweet adulthood. Near the end comes an audacious scene, enabled by special effects, that makes viewers wonder if anything else was fake.\n\nIn those years, Bronstein was working as a projectionist at Lincoln Center, and one day Josh Safdie stopped by to tell him that he had met an intriguing young woman on Forty-seventh Street: Arielle Holmes, a jeweller’s apprentice who turned out to be part of a community of homeless young people battling addiction. Safdie paid Holmes to write her life story, which she did, often by using display laptops at a nearby Apple Store. With Bronstein, the brothers turned her memoir into a movie: “Heaven Knows What,” an astonishingly grim film that Benny Safdie once described as a “nonfiction drama.” Holmes played a version of herself, pretending to use heroin while she was actually using methadone. (The brothers arranged for her to go to rehab once filming was done.) Caleb Landry Jones, an emerging movie star, played her abusive but somehow mesmerizing part-time boyfriend, Ilya. The real Ilya was by all accounts a volatile figure; he died of an overdose before the film’s première. Jones disappeared into the role so completely that people on the street sometimes mistook him for the real Ilya and, accordingly, tried to either calm him down or fight him. The Safdies filmed outside during a brutally cold winter fortnight, subsisting largely on trail mix made by a member of the crew; by the end of the shoot, they looked about as ragged as the people on the other side of the camera.\n\nThe unvarnished look of “Heaven Knows What,” which makes most other films about homeless characters seem ludicrously contrived, can obscure the brothers’ sophisticated approach. They worked with Sean Price Williams, one of the most celebrated cinematographers in independent film, who shot with long lenses, from a distance, so as not to disturb the actors or alert the authorities (there were no filming permits involved); the action unfolds in tense, unsteady closeups. In the film, as in life, Ilya’s musical tastes were extreme: we see him in a public library, listening to the black-metal band Burzum on YouTube. But, for the soundtrack, the brothers drew heavily on “Snowflakes Are Dancing,” the 1974 album by the Japanese electronic musician known as Tomita, which consists of otherworldly synthesizer versions of Claude Debussy’s compositions. The idea was to create a film that felt romantic, without romanticizing the addiction and the violence in it. “We know it’s not for everybody,” Josh Safdie said, around the time of the film’s release. But he felt confident that it would find an audience. “I think there’s eight kids in every high school in America that would freak out over this movie.”\n\nOne person who freaked out was Robert Pattinson, a star of the “Twilight” movies, who was looking for challenging new roles. Mesmerized by an image of Holmes from the film, heavy-lidded and lit in purples and pinks, he e-mailed the Safdies to say that he wanted to work with them. The brothers were still trying to make “Uncut Gems,” and they knew there was no role in it for a boyish English heartthrob. So they resolved to create something new for him. With Bronstein, they started thinking about a heist film, “Good Time,” in which a nervy lowlife named Connie tries to carry off a bank robbery. To balance Pattinson’s character, they gave him a brother with unspecified intellectual disabilities, someone to conspire with and also to take care of. They considered casting an actor with intellectual disabilities, but the film had to be emotionally and physically gruelling, and they worried that they wouldn’t be able to get the performance they wanted without subjecting the actor to real-life stress. Benny Safdie decided to play the role himself. When the film’s financers expressed skepticism, he made an audition tape in character as Nick, growing agitated as he asked the casting director why she was filming him and what was going on. In the film, Benny makes Nick intensely thoughtful, even though we usually can’t be sure what he’s thinking.\n\nFor the Safdies, “Good Time” was a way of showing the film world that they could be trusted to make bigger movies. (Thanks to the marketable presence of Pattinson, the film had a reported budget of about four and a half million dollars.) To viewers who didn’t know the backstory, “Good Time” might have looked more like a crowning achievement. Connie and his accomplices tear through Manhattan, Queens, Long Island, and Brooklyn, showing us parts of New York that don’t always appear onscreen. One scene is a frenzied sprint through the New World Mall, in Flushing; the brothers had permission to shoot there, but they showed up without warning and shot largely with hidden cameras, as if they were still running a guerrilla operation. “Good Time” craftily updates the Safdie template: if their early movies sometimes felt improvised, this one had evident narrative momentum, supplied by a main character who is always on the run—and, therefore, constantly improvising. Many viewers may have been too dazzled by the action to notice the obstacle that the brothers put in their own path. To underscore the sense of physical push and pull, they managed to make a violent action movie with no guns.\n\nMost of the reviews of “Good Time” were enthusiastic. But there were some dissenters, notably A. O. Scott, the Times critic. Scott, who had loved “Daddy Longlegs,” conceded that the brothers were “clever and crafty,” but he found himself repelled by the new movie, especially by the way Pattinson’s character mistreats a series of black characters. “This pattern does not seem accidental,” Scott wrote, and he wondered whether the brothers meant to hold up for critique Connie’s “bottom-of-the-barrel white privilege,” or whether they were merely trolling—engaged in “coy, self-disavowing provocation.” He concluded that it didn’t much matter. The movie, he wrote, was merely “a rickety genre thrill ride.” At its heart, it was “stale, empty, and cold.”\n\nThe brothers have said that these racial disparities were intentional: they were filming in 2016, and wanted to reflect the cruelty and confusion that they perceived all around them. And yet you need not agree with Scott’s critique in order to acknowledge that he identified something true. (For anyone sick of redemptive Hollywood fare, Scott’s condemnation—stale! empty! cold!—might even have sounded like an unintentional endorsement.) The Safdies have long resisted the idea that filmmaking should be morally instructive, with admirable heroes and clearly identified villains. Instead, they take an approach that is at once more generous and more unsparing, refusing to either condemn their characters or prettify them. Most of all, they resist the idea that movie characters must learn and grow; their heroes tend to be stubbornly stuck. “I don’t know many people who change—in particular, who change over a short span of time,” Josh Safdie says. “That’s just not how life unfolds.”\n\nThe Safdies aim less to edify audiences than to envelop them: they want to create immersive experiences, which generally requires that they immerse themselves. In order to make a film as unflinching as “Heaven Knows What,” Josh Safdie spent so much time in Holmes’s world that he scarcely registered its bleakness. (“Once you’re in the darkness, your eyes adjust,” he said.) On the press tour, Jones, their star, was mumbly and glassy-eyed, as if he were having trouble getting out of character. When the film was released, Safdie proclaimed Holmes a “movie star,” and her life suddenly grew more glamorous; she modelled in a fashion shoot with Lady Gaga, and had a role in “American Honey,” the well-reviewed film about travelling magazine sellers. Since then, though, Holmes has faded from view. Buddy Duress was another first-time actor, gangly and charismatic, who appeared in “Heaven Knows What,” and again in “Good Time,” which was informed by his time in jail. He had a number of acting opportunities, but ended up back in jail on drug charges. “He’s so talented,” Safdie says. “He was doing so well. And he just got sucked back into that world.”\n\nThis is another thing that makes some people uneasy about the Safdies: they like to surround themselves with interesting and sometimes troubled characters, who help inspire their movies, and who don’t necessarily find their own lives transformed in the process. But it would be wrong to suggest that the brothers’ unblinking films reflect a lack of compassion. The true subject of “Good Time” is fraternal love, passionately expressed and imperfectly demonstrated. The Safdies seem to sustain close friendships with virtually all their collaborators, and with each other; if Josh hears Benny say something that he likes, he often responds by rubbing Benny’s ear or squeezing his arm.\n\n“Uncut Gems” may not mollify critics of the Safdies’ tendency to appropriate styles and poses from real life, or to let their characters make bad decisions without authorial censure. It is partly a film about Jewish identity: Howard, the hero, is, in Sandler’s words, a “badass Jew,” living in a Jewish enclave on Long Island. Like James Caan’s similarly badass character in “The Gambler,” from 1974, Howard is infatuated with basketball. The Safdies’ jewelry movie is also a basketball movie, set in 2012: Kevin Garnett, the retired Celtics star, convincingly plays himself, a prospective customer of Howard’s and also an important figure in Howard’s betting strategy. Scott Rudin, one of the producers, said he was drawn in partly by the “race politics”: Howard is a Jewish man whose clientele is largely African-American, and whose prized possession is a black opal stolen from an Ethiopian mine. When Garnett suggests that Howard exploited the Ethiopians by underpaying for the opal, Howard defends himself with a basketball analogy. “I see you out there when the fuckin’ stadium’s all booin’ ya, you’re thirty up, you’re still going full tilt,” he says. “Come on, K.G.—this is no different from that.” Through the Safdies’ eyes, we watch Howard fondly but not quite credulously. This is just how he is.\n\nIn October, “Uncut Gems” screened at Lincoln Center, as part of the New York Film Festival. On the red carpet, Sandler worked the media alongside many of the colorful characters who fill out the film. Mike Francesa, the sports-radio fixture, plays a bookie; Wayne Diamond, an astonishingly tanned fashion designer, plays a high roller; Keith Williams Richards, a former longshoreman, plays a tough guy—his first acting job, though possibly not his first time acting tough. The film radiates outward from Howard, who revels, Safdie-like, in travelling between worlds: we follow him to a Passover Seder, where he encounters the ten plagues, and to a night club, where he encounters the R. & B. star the Weeknd. The film radiates inward, too: it is only a mild spoiler to reveal that “Uncut Gems” both starts and ends with the viewer tunnelling through Howard’s body. When it was over, and the audience was happily dazed, the Safdies and their collaborators shuffled onstage.\n\nGarnett, during his playing days, liked to present himself as an implacable warrior. Asked about his acting work, he gave an earnest reply: “I wanted to be very present.” His wide-eyed intensity matches the film’s mood, but he was not the first basketball player the brothers considered. One early version featured Amar’e Stoudemire, whom they met while working on the Cooke documentary, and who usefully complicated the film’s view of identity by being both African-American and Jewish. (Stoudemire was not cast, partly because he declined to shave his dreadlocks, which he did not have in his playing years.) For a while, they talked to Joel Embiid, the Cameroonian star of the Philadelphia 76ers, but then it turned out that the movie would be shooting, inconveniently, during basketball season. Each time the player changed, the script needed to change, too. The brothers used N.B.A. footage without permission, and are planning to offer a “fair use” defense if the league objects; to strengthen their hypothetical case, they present the games exactly as they occurred, taking no license with the outcomes or the chronology. (Moviegoers hoping to avoid spoilers should avoid learning anything about the 2012 playoffs.)\n\nThe bigger challenge was casting Howard: he needed to be Jewish, and he needed to be riveting, but beyond that the brothers were flexible. They tried to get the script to Sandler. When that didn’t work, they pursued Harvey Keitel; they eventually decided that Howard should be younger, although not before having a convivial Seder with Keitel and his family, at Stoudemire’s house. For a while, Jonah Hill was attached, but then the brothers decided that he was too young, right around the time Hill decided that he was too busy. So they returned to Sandler, this time with extra muscle: Martin Scorsese, who had signed on as executive producer.\n\nIf you’re going to film a love letter to an unlovable character, it helps to have a star whom audiences already adore. The Safdies, like most people who were teen-agers in the nineteen-nineties, grew up on Adam Sandler, whose seemingly simple comedy is driven by a feral spirit. In his best roles, Sandler is stubbornly and sometimes unsettlingly irrational, an Everyman who insists on doing precisely what he feels like doing, even if he can’t quite explain why. During a recent conversation with Brad Pitt, which was filmed for Variety, Sandler conceded that Howard might sometimes be “unlikable,” but Pitt stopped him. “He was never unlikable,” Pitt said. “Never.” The trailer for “Uncut Gems” went viral as soon as it was released, in September. It showed Sandler, resplendent in big white teeth and little rimless glasses, stalking the streets of the Diamond District, alternately triumphant and pathetic, as people shout his name. The Safdies were gratified to see images on Twitter of fans dressed as Howard for Halloween—six weeks before the movie came out.\n\nIn the course of filming, Sandler came to be treated as an honorary member of the Forty-seventh Street fraternity. On the “Tonight Show,” he proudly explained to Jimmy Fallon that the jewellers had given him a professional-grade loupe. “I started looking at everybody’s jewelry, to see if it was good or bad,” he said. “And then—this is the weirdest thing—I discovered, because of the loupe: I have a penis!” He smirked. “And, guys: it’s also ‘uncut.’ ”\n\nAs Fallon collapsed into hysterics, Sandler finished the bit. “But I have to report to you, sadly: it’s not a ‘gem.’ ”\n\nSandler brings a trace of laziness to everything he does, as if he were always looking for a corner to cut; in this film, he often seems to be moving slightly slower than everyone else. Even so, there is no shortage of motion or sound. When not comparing “Uncut Gems” to a heart attack, critics have called it “a merciless assault on the senses,” offering earnest and divergent opinions about which sedatives might best help viewers recover.\n\nThe brothers have grown used to responses such as these. But, Josh Safdie says, “the whole point of it is not to assault people—the whole point of it is to create a feeling of what that world is.” For “Uncut Gems,” the Safdies brought in the cinematographer Darius Khondji, who is renowned for an elegant style, which the brothers both admired and wanted to disrupt. (Josh Safdie liked to torment Khondji by sending him images of buildings by the architect Michael Graves, who is known for exuberantly flouting conventions of good taste.) The Diamond District—which sprang up during the Second World War, when a cohort of Jewish gem dealers fled Europe—is not a cozy place, and the film is full of sharp angles, glass surfaces, and harsh light. The brothers’ bet is that, if they get enough details right, and create a vivid enough character, we will find this world as engrossing as they do—and maybe as lovable, too.\n\n“Just filming something stupid,” Josh Safdie said, when a curious onlooker asked what he was doing. He was on West Forty-fifth Street, near Times Square, aiming a handheld camera at a human statue—a man dressed in gold from head to toe, with gold paint covering his face. The man walked over and conferred with the brothers: “Everybody had fun comments to say to me when I walked by. They said, ‘Stay golden!’ ”\n\nIf people had looked closely at the man in gold, he might have seemed familiar. Another member of the crew referred to him as “Sandman,” and Josh Safdie frowned. “Just call him Howard,” he said.\n\nSandler befriended the Safdies during the filming of “Uncut Gems,” and when he heard them talking about making a quick short film he asked if he could take part. A few years earlier, Benny Safdie had starred in “Solid Gold,” a five-minute film about a rather unsteady human statue. (Passersby, none of whom knew they were in a movie, tended to be encouraging and compassionate.) And so, on a recent night, the brothers made a trip to Times Square to film a sequel: now Benny was all in silver, and slightly better at standing still; Sandler, in gold, was the new wobbler. The brothers seemed energized by working the way they once did, without permits and without much of a script.\n\nThe group headed across Seventh Avenue, into the heart of Times Square, doing their best to act like strangers: just two human statues and a handful of onlookers with cameras, who could easily have been tourists. Eventually, the two statues had a confrontation, with Sandler shoving Benny Safdie down the street. Spectators gathered, tensing slightly the way people do when disorder is erupting. Sandler retreated to a side street so that Josh could capture some more footage, but Benny stayed put and stayed in character.\n\n“Everybody was looking at me, like, ‘Was that real?’ ” Benny said, when he rejoined the group.\n\nJosh was grinning. “Someone came up to me and was, like, ‘Was that guy with you?’ ” he said. “I was, like, ‘Nah.’ He turned to his wife and said, ‘That was real violence!’ ”\n\n“The whole point is for people to go home thinking it’s real,” Benny said.\n\nThe brothers are compulsively productive, which is why they were making a tiny film even while finishing their big film. They admit that they had been dreaming of “Uncut Gems” for so long that they hadn’t really planned on what to do afterward. “It feels like we won, but we lost—because it’s not ours anymore,” Josh said, at the Lincoln Center première. The brothers have a few new projects under way, including a roguish travel show for television, partly inspired by “Fishing with John,” the 1991 cult classic. A few years ago, they began work, with the comedian Jerrod Carmichael, on a remake of “48 Hrs.”; since then, the planned remake has evolved into a stand-alone film that could be their next major directing project. They may produce another documentary, and they’re also thinking about a movie set in the world of rare-animal smuggling—the turtle project got them hooked.\n\n“Uncut Gems,” which is distributed by the indie-film powerhouse A24, opens on December 13th. The Safdies haven’t yet figured out how much the film will change their lives, although the early signs are encouraging. It earned five nominations at the Film Independent Spirit Awards, including Best Feature and Best Director, and last week, at the New York Film Critics Circle Awards, the brothers were jointly named Best Director. Ted Barron, their former professor, attended a première in Toronto, and searched for an appropriate comparison. “The reaction to ‘Reservoir Dogs’ reminds me of the way people seem to be reacting to ‘Uncut Gems,’ ” he said. Except that the Safdies are already veterans. “They’ve been so much more prolific than Quentin Tarantino was at that stage of his career,” Barron said.\n\nBack at Elara, the brothers filmed Sandler in the building’s grimy first-floor washroom, rubbing gold off his face. Josh Safdie pounded on the door, and Sandler roared, “Somebody’s in here!”\n\nBenny offered a note. “A little bit more relaxed on the ‘Somebody’s in here,’ ” he said. “Like you’re kind of dejected.”\n\nAfterward, Sandler went upstairs to get cleaned up, and the brothers headed back outside to shoot some more. They walked to Herald Square, and suddenly they seemed to be filming a different movie: the area was largely deserted, except for a volunteer serving soup to some hungry people who looked as if they didn’t have anywhere to go. Josh Safdie filmed scenes of his brother, still in silver paint, walking down Thirty-fifth Street. There was a police car, with its lights on, sitting behind a truck that was making a delivery to Macy’s. The back of the truck was empty and unattended. “Benny, get in the truck,” Josh shouted.\n\n“What for?” Benny said.\n\n“It’s your home.”\n\nSo he climbed in, sat down, and hung his head. He sat there for a long time, his shiny suit illuminated by red and blue police lights; when the driver returned, he asked Benny to stay there longer, so that his boss could see the spectacle.\n\nIf you spend enough time in the brothers’ world, the city starts to seem like one of their films. As they walked back to their office, some of the hungry people formed a chorus, singing an impromptu theme song: “Silver man! Silver man! Herald Square!” Benny passed a father with his young daughter, who prevailed upon him to do a brief show, and who didn’t seem to notice that his miming skills were distinctly second-rate.\n\n“That was amazing,” Benny said, when the father and daughter had gone. “That kid was, like, over the moon.”\n\n“It’s like a Superman cape,” Josh said. They figured they probably had enough footage for their short movie. “It looked beautiful in the truck,” he said. “It’s a little showy, but—”\n\nBenny finished the thought: “But sometimes that’s O.K.” ♦"
