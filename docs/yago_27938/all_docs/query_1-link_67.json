        "text": "[Writer: Lawrence O’Donnell, Jr. | Director: Christopher Misiano | Aired: 3/23/2005]\n\n<blockquote. “Counting weddings and funerals?” – Vinick\n\nAcross the course of The West Wing‘s sixth season, we’ve borne witness to transition. A series that once centered on those who work in the White House has shifted focus to those who covet it. Bartlet, CJ, Leo, and Toby have become supporting characters in the series they established. New faces, locales, and storylines have taken hold.\n\nDespite a few bumps, the transition has been largely successful, and a welcome change following the staid tone of Season Five. Despite – and in some ways, because of – the fact that Sorkin’s writing was so inherently built into the show’s DNA, Wells and co. have felt freer and more flexible now that they’ve pivoted to more fertile ground. But for all the newfound advantages, the shift in story can sometimes jar against the established West Wing of old.\n\nThose seeking evidence need look no further than Arnold Vinick, one of the new tentpoles of the show’s final two years. An elderly and acerbic California Senator, Vinick is the Republicans’ yin to Santos’ lean Texan yang. From his debut in “In the Room” to his third-act spotlight in “King Corn,” we can tell that this character is more than just a disposable supporting player. (That he’s played by Alan Alda is something of a clue as well.)\n\nDespite his Republican roots, Vinick remains stoically liberal on social issues. This record has allowed him to win in one of the deepest-blue states in America. (Out in the real world, California has not elected a GOP Senator since 1988.) But for those of us who’ve stuck with The West Wing since its premiere, Vinick’s introduction doesn’t quite click with the series we know. Since the show’s inauguration, Republicans have been depicted as clownish cartoon backstabbers, flimsy strawmen for Sorkin’s dialogue to set ablaze. Now we are to accept that the same electorate which sent the likes of Peter Lillianfield, Darren Gibson, and Jeff Haffley to Washington has also picked a pro-choice church-skipper as their Presidential nominee.\n\nIt’s a lot to buy, and credit to “In God We Trust” for trying to confront the problem head-on. The episode features more good-faith Republican arguments than the first four seasons combined, yet “In God We Trust” attempts to reconcile itself with the show’s prior history. Vinick’s chief rival for the GOP nomination, the Rev. Don Butler, is a hardcore right-winger, rock-ribbed in both his faith and pro-life stance. In short, he’s the sort of character the Sorkin years would have torn to shreds. Yet Team Wells gives Butler enough dignity and pragmatism – he declines a running mate position before Vinick can offer it – to keep him from turning into a cartoon.\n\nThe episode then completes the circle with Ray Sullivan, the West Virginia governor who ultimately joins the Vinick ticket. Like Butler, Sullivan is a hardcore conservative, but has a strong record and demonstrates crossover appeal that would be key in a general election. Achieving a sense of balance (in terms of geography as well as policy) is crucial to any Presidential ticket, and Vinick wisely snaps him up.\n\nFinally, the episode throws in Bruno Gianelli, the tough-minded campaign hawk who helped Bartlet to a resounding reelection in Season Four. (Okay, a zombified corpse could have defeated Robert Ritchie, but it’s time to move on from that.) Here, Bruno switches sides, sensing a potential winner in Vinick and eager to spearhead the effort. Bruno’s political shift has one foot rooted in reality (the late actor Ron Silver switched from Democrat to Republican in the early 2000s), but it gives us another familiar face of the supposed opposition to latch onto. Bruno has no particular alliance with either party, which is partly what makes his addition to Vinick’s team so intriguing.\n\nThese multiple and varied perspectives on West Wing conservatism makes for an intriguing change of pace, and ultimately provides cover for Vinick’s agnosticism. (This is, after all, a series that peaked in showing a Democratic President railing against God in the National Cathedral – characters contending with religious challenges are nothing new.) As he explains to Bartlet, his aversion to the church is personal, and to feign commitment to appease the Religious Right would make him appear fraudulent.\n\nThe underlying purpose of “In God We Trust” is not to lecture us on the separation of church and state (mercifully, we’re spared only a few lines of that in Vinick’s closing monologue), but rather to paint the show’s new Republican lead as a palpable and three-dimensional character. So much time has been spent on the Santos campaign that it’s refreshing to see the writers turn heads to the opposition – a candidate who is in some ways more likable and intriguing than the Democrat he will face in the general election.\n\nPerhaps that’s partly because the Democrats, at this point in the series, are in disarray. A brokered convention looms large, and tensions between the Santos and Russell campaigns have yet to simmer. As Season Six nears its finish, the election is wide open – there’s plenty of room for Republicans to pick up the slack.\n\nMinor Pros/Cons (+/-)\n\n+ Vinick explaining how to measure the area of a parallelogram.\n\n+ Sheila balancing her time as campaign manager and mom.\n\n+ I remain amused that the only cable news network in the West Wing universe is MSNBC. Except for whatever the network was that hosted Taylor Reid.\n\n+ Bartlet and Vinick eating ice cream together. This is the sort of thing that could come off as bipartisan fantasy, but Sheen, Alda, and the writing sell it perfectly.\n\n– “Republicans have won 49 states twice in the last 30 years.” This presumably refers to the real-life elections of 1972 and 1984, and it’s once again distracting when a supposed alternate-history show references modern historical events. Just saying."
