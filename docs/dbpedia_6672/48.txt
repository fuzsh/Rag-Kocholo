description

Mollösund is located in the middle of the fairway inside Mollön. Here is a well-protected harbor. Perhaps not so charming due to car parking around the harbor and fishing industry right nearby, but a nice view of the village. South of the harbor there are cafes and a restaurant with a great sea view.

Mollösund has a mix of new and old buildings. But heading south along the sea there is a cobblestone street with well-preserved and rehabilitated old small houses. Here it is decorated with flowers and it is very idyllic. Expensive cars are parked here and the houses are probably vacation homes for wealthy people from Gothenburg. The wooden church a bit further up is worth a visit. An old windmill also sets the character of the place.

Over a hill from the harbor we find a popular bathing spot. By the lighthouse north of the harbor, there are smooth cliffs and a bathing spot for adults. It's a great place to sit when the sun sets.

In the harbor, there is water and electricity, toilets, and showers. Nearby there is a small grocery store.
