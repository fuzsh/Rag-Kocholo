The Väderkvarnen windmill on Sörlejet is Mollösund's landmark. The mill from the 17th century was moved about 300 m further north in 1901 and was in operation until 1929. It is one of three preserved mills in Orust, along with those on Lyron and Askerön.

Small, wooden windmill in an exposed spot with a beautiful view (and a bench to take a break).
