        "text": "Our house is located in the well-maintained area of Tången, which is a few hundred meters east of the old community of Mollösund. It’s about a 15-minute walk to the center, where there is a good selection of shops and restaurants. Tången has its own harbor with a private sandy beach and communal facilities. Our house also includes a boathouse with all the equipment for a perfect day by the shore.\n\nWe have adapted the accommodation for 6 people to live comfortably. If you don’t have too high demands on comfort, it’s possible to squeeze in an additional 2-3 people.\n\nThe house is a semi-detached house built in 2005. On the ground floor, there are 2 bedrooms, 2 bathrooms, a kitchen, and a living room with access to the terrace. Upstairs, there is a large bedroom and a lounge with a TV.\n\nThe house is winterized with underfloor heating, a wood-burning stove, sauna, and a jacuzzi. Mollösund in winter can be as harsh as it is beautiful and fascinating.\n\nWe want responsible and conscientious tenants. We have set an age limit of 25 years and reserve the right to deny rental if we are uncertain.\n\nClick HERE to see a short video of the house\n\nLiving Room\n\nThe living room has an open floor plan with the dining area and kitchen. The room is open up to the roof ridge with large windows facing the terrace. The influx of light and the ceiling height give a wonderful feeling of space in the room.\n\nThe seating area consists of a 3-seater sofa, an armchair, and some ottomans with a large round coffee table in the middle. The display cabinet contains all kinds of glassware to enhance the stay. There is also a wood-burning stove, and firewood is available during the winter months.\n\nA 32″ wall-mounted picture TV (Samsung The Frame) always displays sun in the weather report.\n\nFrom the living room, you can access the terrace with the large dining table for 8 people."
