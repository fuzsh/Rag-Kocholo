The municipality includes Sweden's third largest island Orust and some other small adjacent islets.\n\nThe villages in the municipality are Ellös, Henån, Hälleviksstrand, Mollösund, Svanvik and Varekil. Should be loaded on this page.\n\nHistorically, the area has been inhabited for thousands of years, as evident by ancient remains such as tombs, grave fields and rock carvings. Dating from the Viking Age, runestones are plentiful throughout Orust.\n\nIn the Nordisk familjebok the island of Orust is mentioned as a Geatish territory. Ramshult (the modern Swedish form), a hill fort, is mentioned in Beowulf as Hrefnesholt, the Geatish hill fort which became the prison of Onela, Ohthere and their mother until their rescue by Ongenþeow.\n\nIndustry wise, the area has always been dominated by fishing and boat production. Shipyard Hallberg-Rassy is the largerst employer nowadays. Its shipyard is located in Ellös, on the north-west part of the island, and it has a significant export of sailing boats. The second largest employer is Najad-varvet, also a shipyard. The island Orust has a land area of 346 km², Sweden's fourth largest island.\n\nWhat links to here?\n\nOrust\n\n(Hist: Oroust)\n\nEllöst\n\nHenån\n\nHälleviksstrand\n\nMollösund\n\nSvanvik"
