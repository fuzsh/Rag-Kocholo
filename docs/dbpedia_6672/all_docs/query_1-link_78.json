Equally recognized by their traditional music peers as from popular music press like Billboard.\n\n“Jaerv takes the elements of traditional Scandinavian music and reflects them through a modern prism, with an all-acoustic sound that nonetheless takes a bevy of tricky turns in rhythm and harmony that makes the pleasant rural melodies ring with a contemporary complexity” (Pop Matters).\n\n\"They are singing, playing, storytelling and are so terribly good. The audience is knocked out by their performance!\" (Susanne Rydén - President of the Royal Academy of Music)\n\n\"One of Sweden's most inventive folk bands.\" (Nordstjernan US-magazine)\n\nHighlighted concerts\n\nUSA - Cedar Cultural Center (Minneapolis), Old Town School of Folk Music (Chicago), House of Sweden (Washington DC), Blackstone River Theatre (Cumberland) University of Michigan (Ann Arbor)\n\nJAPAN - Kobe Port Oasis (Kobe), Club Mandala (Tokyo), Funabashi Park (Tokyo), Kenchoji Temple (Kamakura)\n\nEUROPE - Kaustinen Folk Music Festival (Finland), Celtic Connections (Scotland) Stockholm Folk Festival (Sweden), Hilmarfestivalen (Norway), Nordlek Dance Festival (Denmark), Noia Conservatory (Spain) Columbi Egg (Norway)"
