        "text": "9/2/2019: Freezer Won't Cool\n\nThis was a hard one to chase down. The freezer would cool down to just below freezing but wouldn't go lower. We've seen this before when it's overfilled and the airflow is impaired but, after adjusting the load several times, it still wouldn't cool below the mid-20s.\n\nWhat we found was the evaporator was dirty, the fan was dirty, and the primary problem was the fan speed is now much slower than its design speed due to failing bearings. The fan needs to be replaced but we don't have a spare. However, just cleaning the cooling systems increases efficiency enough that a poorly operating fan is more than sufficient.\n\nThe freezer is now operating at -6.7F (-14C) and as reliable as ever. And, of course, we have a new fan on order but it's no rush. We think the system will run reliably like this for many months, if not years.\n\nThis has to be the 5th or 6th time the temperature alarm has warned us that we have a freezer problem. This allows us to make the correction without putting hundreds of dollars in frozen foods at risk. The freezer temp alarm set to a low value has saved us many times. We show yellow alerts on slight increases in freezer temps and at 20F (-6C) we will signal red alert and send email to both of us.\n\n9/5/2019: Toilet Not Flushing\n\nTecma heads are absolutely amazing. The only fault we have ever seen in 10 years of live-aboard use is easy to fix, but can be confusing if you haven't seen the problem before. The symptom is the head will stop reliably flushing. Sometimes you'll need to flush 3 times to evacuate and sometimes it'll work fine.\n\nWhat's happening is that by design the toilets fully evacuate the bowl and pump/macerator assembly. Having this system fully evacuated ensures no smells and no spills in even very rough water. But, on the next use pump/macerator will be dry and, since this is not a self priming pump, it won't do anything until there is water in the pump housing. Since the heads bring the liquid to near the top of the bowl and then down to the pump/macerator, the pump assembly will remain dry until the bowl is full. This will make the toilet appear to be plugged in that the bowl will just keep filling until very near the top at which point, the water flows below and the toilet appears to unplug. In fact, it's not plugged at all and as soon as the pump/macerator has water it works fine.\n\nThe normal operation of this head has a small hose running between the bowl level and pump/macerator. As soon as fluid is in the head, the pump is primed and works great. This small plastic hose pictured above is what makes the system work and every 5 years or so, it'll plug and the head will seem unreliable. Clean and/or replace the hose and the system is back to flushing like new with the usual never-plug reliability of Tecma. It's not that easy to work back there on our installation, so it's a bit of a hassle to get the major hose pictured out but, once that is done, replacing the plastic drain hose is quick and easy.\n\n9/8/2019: Anders and Patrick\n\nWe were enjoying a warm afternoon drink at Lot Hotel, chatting with the owners and watching the boats come and go in the harbor, when two people came up and introduced themselves. We gave our names and one of them said \"I know, we were looking for you\". This sounded interesting—it turns out Anders Segerberg (left) and Patrick Ferreira saw Dirona passing by the Stena terminal in Gothenburg where they work some days back. One has been watching our blog and they are both interested in boats. Why not go visit? They decided it would be a fun trip and headed up to see us at Karingon. We were surprised they could find us, but they pointed it out it's really not that big an island. We really enjoyed our chat with both Anders and Patrick and they came back to Dirona to continue the conversation and look around the boat.\n\n9/9/2019: Furuno DRS25\n\nA few months back our 25KW main RADAR started to occasionally produce auto-tuning errors. This got more and more frequent over a few weeks. We consulted with Furuno and they said that magnetron lifetime is usually in the range of 8,000 transmitting hours. Some go a bit longer and some a bit less, but that generally the lifetime and auto-tuning errors are the symptom when they start failing.\n\nThe recommended parts to bring the RADAR back to full spec would cost about half the price of a new RADAR, so we elected to just go with a new one. We ordered it through Emerald Harbor Marine who have been helping us for 25 years now and took back the 58lb package as part of our luggage when we flew back into Stockholm from some time at work in Seattle.\n\nWe've been running our backup RADAR, a 6KW Furuno DRS6, and it's been working great. The only difference we notice is the 6KW view through the stack to the rear isn't very good, whereas the 25KW just punches through the fiberglass like it wasn't there. Perhaps a bit less range, but the 6KW is an excellent backup and we've hardly noticed the 25KW gone. Here James has just started the work to install RADAR and has just finished taking the antenna off the old one.\n\n9/9/2019: Radar Wiring\n\nHere we are removing the wiring from the RADAR unit prior to unbolting it and removing it from the boat. Looking down from the top you can see two cables coming in. One brings in an Ethernet cable for signalling and the other brings in power and ground. The Ethernet cable modular connection is released and pulled out. Then the power connection is pushed down to release the power and ground wires.\n\nThe red and blue wires are held in with a push-to-release connection. Once the wires are free, the four screws at the bottom, holding the plate over the grommet around the wires, are removed. This plate comes up and the grommet can be raised out of the socket and then removed from the wires. At this point the wiring is free and can be gently pushed down through the bottom hole.\n\n9/9/2019: Greasing Rudder Bearing\n\nWhen our Nordhavn 52 came new from the yard, it used a Delrin (white plastic) upper rudder bearing. This bearing material has the advantage of needing no lubrication and never rusting. But the disadvantage of Delrin is we needed to change the bearing every 1,500 hours. It just isn't that durable. I eventually decided to have a replacement bearing fabricated in Oilite (oil impregnated bronze).\n\nThis approach yields a very durable bearing that will last 8,000 to 12,000 hours and still won't rust. Strictly speaking this material sufficiently self lubricating that no further lubrication is needed for low speed use in a rudder bearing application. But, I decided to play it safe and install a grease fitting and to machine in grease channels. It's been working quite well and I apply grease to this every 6 months.\n\n9/10/2019: FLIR Imaging\n\nEvery 6 months we do a full scan of the breaker cabinet, the DC cabinet, and all high amperage connections using a FLIR One infrared camera . It's important to do this test under maximum load, and what we are looking for is excess heat indicating a poor connection that is getting hot due to excess resistance or excess load for the size of the connector. We typically find nothing out of the norm. We strongly recommend that all electrical connections be torqued once a boat is a year old. We found a great many were lose. But it seems like once a boat has been in use for a while, they stay stable and don't loosen off again. But, we all know someone or have read about someone with an older boat that was lost to fire. In our opinion, it's worth checking.\n\nThis picture is of the 240V electrical panel while the generator is running. Looking at the 240V breakers in the center of the picture you can see that the oven and water maker are idle, the two chargers are running at full load, and the inverter and washer/dryer are running, but at fairly low load. The master breaker is warm but not hot. At the top of the picture, the 4 gauges above there are nice-looking but, as you can see here, they are wasting quite a bit of power. Along the bottom of the picture you can see 4 large manual transfer switches. If you look carefully you can see slight heat in the charger selector switch on the left and the rest are fairly cold. From this you can see that these manual transfer switches are reliable low resistance switches producing little heat. Even the switch on the left that is carry 43A is hardly even warm.\n\n9/24/2019: Oil Filter Leak?\n\nHere we check the top of the filter and can see that nothing is leaking down onto it, which means we are almost certainly looking at a leaking oil filter. But, if you are observant, you'll see a tiny bit of oil residue on the outside end of the filter. It's just luck that this little dab of oil is there and in many, if not most, situations it wouldn't be. The remainder of the filter top is clean and dry, and this could easily fool you.\n\nWhat is happening is the oil filter is hot, so the oil that drips on it is thinned and almost no oil residue is left, possibly leading to a misdiagnosis. Leaks of all types can be difficult, almost crafty, so we keep looking\n\n9/24/2019: Leak Found\n\nLooking above the oil filter in the picture here, you can see the fuel pump has a drip of engine oil on it (click image for a larger view). This is a fairly new fuel pump, so is not likely the leak source and yet there is clearly a drip hanging off the pump manual pump lever shaft. What's interesting about this case is, where the oil dripped onto the oil filter below, there was almost no evidence of the leak. The hot oil filter caused the oil to run around to the other side of the filter and leave almost no residue on the top and a clear leak on the bottom and at the gasket.\n\nIn this case, the fairly new fuel pump appears to have been delivered with hand-tightened fuel diaphragm screws. We tightened these up and the oil leak stopped. This not only fixed the small oil leak, but also solved a mystery problem that has been around for a while. If the generator hasn't been used for a couple of weeks, it needed an extra few seconds of cranking to start and rarely might stall and need to be restarted. If the generator has been run in the last few days, it runs perfectly. The slow-to-start after a period of disuse is probably caused by the fuel pump not operating with full capability and long shutdowns allowing some fuel drain back. Tightening the diaphragm screws fixed both issues.\n\n9/25/2019: Generator J-box\n\nNorthern Lights generators have a grey wire that is ground to shutdown. On Dirona, this wire is grounded by the Sea-Fire system to shut the engine down. When I started to test the Sea-Fire system I noticed the generator grey wire was always grounded. Here I'm verifying that the wiring \"north\" of the generator is fine and the grey wire has a ground problem on the generator.\n\nAs I dug into the \"problem\" I learned what I could have just read off the wiring diagram. The grey wire that when grounded shuts down the fuel to stop the engine supports manual shut down and Sea-Fire mandated shutdown but I had forgotten that low oil pressure will also ground this wire and shut down the motor. Unfortunately, all my testing was done with the generator shut down with zero oil pressure so, naturally, the grey wire was grounded. The good news is I now know this circuit well, but the bad news is I just spent 2 hours investigating when, in fact, there was nothing wrong."
