        "text": "Embark on a 12-day journey of sustainable discovery in serene Västra Götaland County, where relaxation, rejuvenation, and responsible tourism harmoniously blend. Your adventure begins in the vibrant city of Gothenburg, immersing you in a world where sustainability is a living practice. Explore the city’s Botanical Garden, marvel at the Gothenburg Museum of Art’s rich cultural tapestry, and indulge in fresh seafood at Feskekôrka, all while appreciating the city’s eco-friendly ethos.\n\nThe journey continues to the southern islands of Gothenburg’s archipelago, offering tranquillity amidst nature’s untouched beauty. Wander through quaint fishing villages and winding trails, experiencing a peaceful escape that highlights our commitment to environmental preservation and community support.\n\nMore than just a holiday, this tour is an immersive experience in the heart of West Sweden. Discover sustainability and exploration intertwined, from the lush landscapes of Kållandsö to the historic charm of Lidköping. Join us to uncover the true essence of sustainable living and cultural authenticity in this enchanting region.\n\nJourney Overview\n\nDay 1 – Arrive in Gothenburg\n\nDay 2 – Explore Gothenburg\n\nDay 3 – Alingsås & Kållandsö\n\nDay 4- Naturum Vänerskärgården\n\nDay 5 – Kållandsö\n\nDay 6 – Lidköping & Kata Gård\n\nDay 7 – Ljungskile & Bredfjället\n\nDay 8 – Uddevalla\n\nDay 9 – Tjörn\n\nDay 10 – Tjörn\n\nDay 11 – Dyrön\n\nDay 12 – Gothenburg\n\nWhat’s included?\n\nAll accommodation.\n\n2 breakfasts at Hotel Eggers\n\n3 breakfasts and 3 2-course dinners at Victoriahuset-Läckö\n\n2 breakfasts and 2 3-course dinners at Villa Sjötorp.\n\n4 breakfasts and 4 dinners (first evening 3-course/other evenings 1-course) at Björholmen\n\n1 Lunch at the restaurant Hvita Hjorten.\n\nBedsheets, towels and cleaning after check-out are included.\n\nRental of an Electric vehicle including free mileage, 24/7 road assistance, Liability Insurance Supplement, and GPS.

Transfers rather than electric vehicle rental are available on request.\n\nNot included:\n\nBeverages not included.\n\nEntrance fees.\n\nHow is this a Sustainable Journey?\n\nSupporting the local economy: While the food you eat will be bought from local producers, the places you visit are small or medium-sized enterprises that are often family-run businesses owned in Sweden, with local people employed. The Nordic Watercolour Museum and Sculpture in Pilane were conceived as a way of bringing international art to rural West Sweden and a focus for attracting visitors to the area to boost the local economy. None of the destinations you will visit in West Sweden suffer from mass tourism, so you can be sure that you are genuinely supporting the local economy and helping to sustain living communities.\n\nFood and drink: All of the restaurants on this tour work with locally produced and seasonal ingredients as much as possible. You will find some classic Swedish dishes on the menus, along with excellent contemporary cuisine that takes its inspiration from what is available close at hand. Alingsås is the Swedish Capital of Fika, a longstanding and very important tradition, so you’ll also experience a slice of Swedish food culture and history with every delicious bite."
