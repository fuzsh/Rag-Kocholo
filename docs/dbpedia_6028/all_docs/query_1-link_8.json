        "text": "The coastal village of Midwich, California, isn’t the kind of town you’d notice unless you lived there. People drive through without taking their feet off the accelerator, and the locals prefer it that way. For them, Midwich is just a nice place to settle down, escape from the city, raise a family. It’s so quiet, you can hear your own thoughts.\n\nAnd so can the children.\n\nAfter a strange, unseen force envelops the town for several hours one fall day, all of the local women become pregnant – a shocking development for most of them. While all of the pregnancies are healthy and without complications, the local town doctor (Christopher Reeve) cannot explain this amazing incubation, nor can the village minister (Mark Hamill) find any theological explanation.\n\nSearching for clues, the federal government sends in a sophisticated, secretive epidemiologist (Kirstie Alley) to investigate the phenomenon. While she compiles several scientific theories to comprehend the enigma, 10 children are born, nine of whom survive. With white hair and cobalt eyes, their stark and unusual resemblance makes it appear that the brood are all siblings of the same parents. As they mature, they display extraordinary supernatural and telepathic powers which prove fatal to several townsfolk – and may spell doom for the human race."
