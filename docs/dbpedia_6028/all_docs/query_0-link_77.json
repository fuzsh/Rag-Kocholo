        "text": "There's nothing worse than an un-scary scary movie. \"Damned\" is too long on drama, too short on horror and, what is most annoying, too insulting to our intelligence.\n\nFull Review | Original Score: 1/4 | Apr 26, 2022\n\nAlthough it's not in the same league as Carpenter's other notable remake (his 1982 version of The Thing remains unparalleled), it's well worth reassessment.\n\nFull Review | Original Score: 3/5 | Oct 8, 2020\n\nThe film feels somewhat dead. It's not tapping into a cultural vein, or expressing some sort of parental nightmare, it's just echoing those prior ones in a totally unsatisfying way.\n\nFull Review | May 1, 2020\n\nIt's the kind of film that appears to have been made by filmmakers who don't understand a thing about storytelling, pacing, tone, or atmosphere, which is only made all the more shocking by the fact that it was directed by the legendary John Carpenter.\n\nFull Review | Original Score: 2/5 | Apr 11, 2016\n\nThe real shock came when I noticed that a woman filing out of the premiere screening beside me had actually marked her rating card with an \"excellent\" grade.\n\nFull Review | Original Score: 1/5 | Jul 6, 2010\n\nSurprisingly fun horror. Nothing new, but the coma was creepy and the telepathic kids were scary.\n\nFull Review | Original Score: 3/5 | Jul 14, 2003"
