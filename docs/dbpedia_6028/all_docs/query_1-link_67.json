        "text": "\" Beware of the Children \"\n\nWritten by Thomas Glorieux - Review of the regular release\n\nJohn Carpenter has written some amazing movies in his time, classics if you will that capture his style, his voice and his personality. But sometimes the inspiration just isn't there, ultimately resulting in a weaker (or inferior) product. John Carpenter assumed it would be a sensible idea in polishing up a 1960 classic of demon children, but the effort became a weaker one. Today it will only be remembered as one of the final movies which starred a totally healthy Christopher Reeve. And if one would like to know, also for containing a totally addictive main theme.\n\nWe all knew what John Carpenter was capable of, and yet Village of the Damned will surprise you. After all, the charm of opening a Carpenter album with its best track is usually the scenario one wants to sign for immediately. And \"March of the Children\" is no different story wise. The hypnotic march with added choir is cool beyond words.\n\nWhat follows after this is a bit of a mixed bag. \"Children's Carol\" is totally supported by fitting dialogue and somehow it enhances the frightening organ score of Carpenter. But why revisit a movie if you're listening to a CD?\n\nThe entire score (like the story) is centred around a mysterious sound design. In \"Daybreak\" it creates the listening experience, in \"The Fair\" the added guitar adds relaxing qualities to an ominous score. That doesn't take away there's true emotional colour as well, like in \"The Funeral\" even though the mystery theme still needs to be there to state the children's presence.\n\nThere's a theme for the children as well, and it is like Carpenter's voice transcends into \"The Children's Theme\" because it sounds harmless, magical and unknowing at the same time. \"Ben's Death\" goes even further with a choral supported track. The final tracks like \"Burning Desire\" and \"The Brick Wall\" elevate the tension, with enough sound design to keep it from reaching a satisfying listening experience. Sadly this is also put in between the rather inappropriately placed soother \"Welcome Home, Ben\".\n\nThis doesn't change the fact Carpenter's Village of the Damned is still up to par in both the effective experience as the interesting experience. After all we should have closed with \"March of the Children\" as it is the final track we hear in the movie. And we receive our strength from the basic fact that the first part is entertaining enough. Overall, food for Carpenter fanatics, while for many it will be the first time they ever heard of additional composer Dave Davies.\n\nTracklisting\n\n1.
