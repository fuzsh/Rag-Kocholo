        "text": "Village of the Damned is a 1995 American science fiction-horror film directed by John Carpenter and starring Christopher Reeve, Kirstie Alley, Linda Kozlowski, Michael Pare, Mark Hamill, and Meredith Salenger. It is based on the 1957 novel The Midwich Cuckoos by John Wyndham, which was previously adapted into the 1960 British film. The 1995 version is set in Northern California, whereas the book and original film are both set in the United Kingdom. The 1995 film was marketed with the tagline, \"Beware the Children\".\n\nThis was the last publicly released film starring Reeve before he was paralyzed in an equestrian accident in May 1995, as well as his last theatrically released film. The film was panned by critics and failed at the box office upon release.\n\nPlot[]\n\nThe people and animals of the sleepy coastal town of Midwich in California's Marin County fall asleep at a 10 AM \"blackout\" and regain consciousness at 4 PM. Following the blackout, ten women mysteriously fall pregnant, including a virgin girl and a married lady who has not been sexually active for a year, due to her husband being away for work in Tokyo. None of them seek abortions after having dreams, and all the babies are born the same night in a barn â€“ five boys and five girls, though the virgin's daughter is stillborn due to umbilical cord asphyxia. The surviving children are healthy but have pale skin, white-blonde hair, cobalt eyes, and unusually narrow fingernails.\n\nHowever, they do not appear to possess a conscience or individual personalities. They display eerie psychic powers that can result in violent and deadly consequences whenever they experience pain or provocation. The children soon \"pair off\" like mates, except for David, whose intended mate was the stillborn girl. As a result, David is the outcast of the group. Although he retains some degree of psychic powers, he also has the ability to show human compassion. He talks to his mother, Jill McGowan, the school principal, and begins to understand his situation. Mara is the group's leader, and her partner is Robert. She's the daughter of the physician, Dr. Alan, and his wife, Barbara. As a baby, Mara used her powers to force her mother to burn her arm in a pot of boiling water, and later forced her to commit suicide by jumping off a cliff.\n\nThe children, who now have a bad reputation in town, eventually move to the local barn as their classroom for survival. Local priest Father George attempts to shoot them, only for Mara to use her powers and force George to shoot himself. Soon, it is learned that there are other colonies of blackout children in foreign countries, but due to their inhuman nature, they were quickly eliminated, in some cases at the cost of destroying the entire town. The scientific team in Midwich flees the town to escape the chaos. One of the scientists, Dr. Susan Verner, is hypnotized by Mara and Robert to show them the well-preserved alien corpse of David's intended partner she secretly kept in her laboratory for scientific research. David is devastated, and Mara and Robert then hypnotize Dr. Verner to stab herself to death with a scalpel. An angry mob gathers to kill the children, but the town descends into chaos.\n\nAlan devises a plan to detonate a bomb inside a briefcase in the children's classroom. By thinking of a brick wall, he is able to create a mental barrier and keep the presence of the bomb a secret from the children. Jill begs him to spare David because he is not like the others. Alan attempts to do this by asking David to leave to get his notebook from his car. The children begin to suspect that Alan is hiding something. Mara's true face shows through as she breaks through Alan's defenses, revealing the bomb. The other children look at the clock, and the bomb explodes, killing everyone inside, including Alan. Jill holds David outside during the explosion.\n\nWhile driving away, Jill tells David: \"Don't worry, David. We'll go someplace where nobody knows who we are.\""
