Non-Personnel Services Expenditure Account Codes

Account codes are used to classify expenditures and revenues into proper categories. It is through

the classification that the university analyzes expenditures for such purposes as indirect costs rate

analyses, equipment matching support, annual financial statement production, and departmental

budget analyses. It is important that the proper account code be used when transactions are

entered in the accounting system.

Use the 5-digit code that accurately classifies the expenditure. Do not use the 5-digit codes

ending in “00.” Those codes are for general descriptions of the section and are not data enterable.

In some sections, there are lower level codes for specific types of the commodity. Example:
