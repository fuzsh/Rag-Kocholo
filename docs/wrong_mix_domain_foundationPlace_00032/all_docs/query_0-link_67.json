        "text": "Running a sports organization has never been easy. Commissioners and administrators are responsible for a wide variety of tasks that require extraordinary attention to detail, organization, and communication skills. While technology has helped administrators more efficiently handle these tasks, it’s also created an always-on environment that requires around-the-clock management of their organizations.\n\nAdministrators have turned to sports management software as a tool to effectively manage these environments. And for many organizations, sports management software has proven to be a success. From registrations to schedules and more, these tools have transformed the organized sports industry from a logistical guessing game into a highly functioning network of active and informed users.\n\nBut not all sports management software is created equal, and picking the right software requires a great deal of research and industry experience. Further complicating that decision in 2021 is the COVID-19 pandemic, which has created its own set of hurdles for administrators, coaches, parents, and players. The current landscape demands a solution that will allow all members to clear those hurdles. The sports management software that delivers efficient operational and communication tools while also incorporating COVID-19-specific features will be the software of choice for organizations across the country.\n\nSafeguarding the health of your members has always been a responsibility that you take seriously. Your sports management software should be a trusted resource for rising to the challenge. Let’s take a closer look at how to choose the right software for this new climate.\n\nWhile we’ve made progress in returning to the playing field as we once knew it, plenty of obstacles remain. Your organization’s plans for returning to play likely have shifted multiple times, and they’re likely to shift again. The changing circumstances have contributed to a stressful environment for all involved. As an administrator, you understand your duty to offer solutions to your members, and in 2021, that starts with choosing a sports management software that complements and doesn’t complicate, your return to play plan.\n\nSeamless Scheduling: The foundation of a well-run sports organization or league is the schedule. It’s a tool for the entire organization and must be built with precision. An effective sports management tool allows administrators and coaches to automate practice and game schedules, preventing scheduling conflicts, including unavailable venues and coach unavailability. In the COVID era, seamless scheduling becomes even more paramount as the status of practices and games can be changed on a moment’s notice.\n\nEasy, Efficient Communication: As schedules change, administrators and coaches must be able to communicate with parents and players as quickly as possible. Your sports management app should connect members in one communication hub, where users can reliably send and receive a variety of messages and notifications, including organization-wide messaging, 1:1 messaging and group chats. It’s important in this environment that your organization’s app meet users where they are by offering several options for notifications. Some users might prefer email alerts while others respond quicker to push notifications or SMS texts.\n\nAs you evaluate sports management software, consider a provider that integrates messaging with rosters and member profiles. This eliminates the confusion and missed connections that come with using multiple avenues of communication.\n\nHealth Screenings: Perhaps the most complicated aspect of returning to play is making sure all participants are medically cleared. One way to simplify the process is administering and verifying health screenings through your management software. Once a participant is cleared, the software records the result and gives the participant the green light to play. A health screening feature showcases your organization’s emphasis on health, protects all participants, and gives parents peace of mind.\n\nTrusted by Parents: As any administrator or coach can attest to, earning the trust of parents is of utmost importance at every level of competition. Your choice of software should reflect that understanding. Parents want a tool that’s easy to use, keeps all relevant information in one place, and is a proven winner.\n\nOne of the most important aspects of picking the right software for your organization is helping your members navigate the complexities of playing during a pandemic. The best software will address foundational needs such as scheduling, but it will also have the flexibility to adapt to the challenges that lie ahead."
