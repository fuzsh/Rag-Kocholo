        "text": "Flags, Symbols & Currency of French Polynesia\n\nThe Flag of French Polynesia was adopted on November 23, 1984.\n\nThe Flag of French Polynesia is a rectangular tricolor featuring two red horizontal bands encasing a wide white band in a 1:2:1 ratio. French Polynesia’s Coat of Arms is centered prominently on the middle white band. The red and white colors of the flag are the traditional Polynesian colors. The flag has a length-to-width proportion ratio of 2:3.\n\nThe design of the flag is similar to the red-white-red flag of Tahiti which is the largest and the most populous of the French Polynesian islands. However, the Tahiti flag had no emblem in the white band. The French Tricolore is used for official ceremonies in French Polynesia.\n\nFlags of Component Archipelagos of French Polynesia\n\nFlag of the Austral Islands\n\nFlag of the Gambier Islands\n\nFlag of Marquesas Islands\n\nUnofficial flag of the Leeward Islands\n\nUnofficial flag of the Leeward Islands\n\nSymbols of French Polynesia\n\nThe Coat of Arms of French Polynesia\n\nThe current official Coat of Arms of French Polynesia was adopted on November 23, 1984. It features a disk with a blue and white wave pattern depicting the sea on the lower half and a gold and white ray pattern depicting the sun on the upper half. A Polynesian canoe sails on the wave pattern. The Polynesian canoe represents the traditional Tahitian symbol of essential values. It also stands as an important tool for subsistence fishing and as a symbol for communication and transportation between the islands of French Polynesia. The canoe has a crew of five represented by five asterisks that symbolize the five island groups: The Society Islands, the Austral Islands, the Gambier Islands, the Marquesas Islands, and the Tuamotus archipelago.\n\nNational Anthem\n\nBeing an Overseas Territory of France, the French national anthem: \"La Marseillaise\" is the official national anthem of French Polynesia. However, a local territorial anthem was adopted by The French Polynesia Assembly on June 10, 1993. This anthem is sung along with the French anthem during festivals and sporting events and whenever French Polynesia participates in any international conferences. The music of the territorial anthem was composed by Jean Paul Berlier. The lyrics have been authored by Maeva Bougues, Imine Tehei, Angéle Terorotua, Johanna Nouveau, Patrick Amaru, Louis Mamatui and Jean-Pierre et Pierre Célestin.\n\n\"Ia Ora 'O Tahiti Nui\" (Tahitian) - Territorial Anthem\n\nʻUa rahu te atua (i) tōʻu ʻāiʻa\n\nHono noʻanoʻa o te motu rau\n\nHeihei i te pua riʻi au ē\n\nE firi nape mōrohi ʻore\n\nʻO tāʻu īa e faʻateniteni nei\n\nTē tūoro nei te reo here\n\nO te huia\n\nʻA hiʻi i tō aroha\n\nʻIa ora ʻo Tahiti Nui ē\n\nTerritorial Anthem of French Polynesia\n\nMy country is born of God\n\nMultiple islands necklace\n\nWith delicate slices\n\nRated with an immune brace\n\nToday I honor you\n\nHere is the voice\n\nFrom your children\n\nReflect your love\n\nFor Tahiti Nui to live\n\nThe Currency of French Polynesia is the CFP franc\n\nThe current official currency in French Polynesia is the CFP franc. The acronym CFP stands for Cours de franc Pacifique. Its exchange rate with euro is fixed at 1 Euro = 119.33 F.CFP\n\nThe Central Pacific Franc was first introduced in 1945. In September 1949, the CFP franc was pegged to the French franc.\n\nCoins\n\n1,2,5,10,20,50 and 100 coins are currently in circulation.\n\nBanknotes\n\n500, 1000, 5000, and 10,000 notes are currently in circulation."
