        "text": "National name:\n\nRépublique Française\n\nGovernment\n\nFifth republic\n\nGeography\n\nFrance is in the Alps near the Italian and Swiss borders is western Europe’s highest point—Mont Blanc (4,810 m). The forest-covered Vosges Mountains are in the northeast, and the Pyrénées are along the Spanish border.\n\nHistorical Background\n\nAlthough ultimately a victor in World Wars I and II, France suffered extensive losses in its empire, wealth, manpower, and rank as a dominant nation-state. Nevertheless, France today is one of the most modern countries in the world and is a leader among European nations. In recent years, its reconciliation and cooperation with Germany have proved central to the economic integration of Europe, including the introduction of a common exchange currency, the euro, in January 1999. At present, France is at the forefront of efforts to develop the EU's military capabilities to supplement progress toward an EU foreign policy. In July, Sarkozy launched the Union for the Mediterranean-an international body of 43 member nations. The union seeks to end conflict in the Middle East by addressing regional unrest and immigration. On July 21, 2008, Sarkozy won a narrow victory for constitutional changes that strengthen parliamentary power, limit the presidency to two five-year terms, and end the president's right of collective pardon. The changes, approved in July, also allow the president to address Parliament for the first time since 1875.\n\nFacts & Figures\n\nName\n\nFrench\n\nCapital\n\nParis\n\nGovernment\n\nUnitary semi-presidential republic\n\nLanguage\n\nFrench\n\nNational Holiday\n\n14 July\n\nArea\n\n674,843 km\n\nPopulation\n\n65,821,885\n\nCurrency\n\nEuro, & CFP franc"
