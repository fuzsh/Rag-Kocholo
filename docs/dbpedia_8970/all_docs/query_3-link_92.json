        "text": "Grand Canyon University’s Bachelor of Science in Finance with an Emphasis in Financial Planning is an undergraduate degree program that introduces you to all aspects of personal financial planning. In this comprehensive program, you will examine methodologies and best practices in areas such as risk evaluation, investments and taxes.\n\nThis bachelor’s degree program also integrates essential soft skills throughout, including effective communication and professional ethics. A bachelor’s degree can enable students to study financial planning and is typically an entry-level requirement for becoming a financial planner, according to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS).1\n\nAt GCU, you’ll enjoy academic flexibility, as you can choose to study financial planning online or on campus. This degree program is a CERTIFIED FINANCIAL PLANNER™ (CFP) Board registered program that fulfills the CFP® certification education requirement. Earning this undergraduate degree can be the first step toward a career as a financial advisor.\n\nUpon graduation, you will have been provided the necessary knowledge and skills so you can help others plan for their financial future. You’ll also be able to apply what you’ve been taught about financial planning principles and practices to your own personal finances, which may empower you to achieve better peace of mind through wise fiscal decisions.\n\nAt GCU, you will be immersed within the Christian worldview via faith-integrated financial planning classes. You will have the opportunity to learn the important role CFP® professionals have in putting the interests of their clients first as they provide competent and ethical financial planning.\n\nIn GCU’s financial planning courses, you will explore how to assess clients’ personal current and future financial needs, develop goals, evaluate alternatives and create a comprehensive action plan that’s in alignment with your clients’ values and objectives.\n\nAs a student in this finance degree program, you can gain competence in key areas such as:\n\nGCU leads with a Lopes First perspective, embracing a student-centric culture that emphasizes higher purpose, conscious capitalism and academic success.\n\nWhen you complete your financial advisor schooling, you will be expected to demonstrate cultural competence while working with diverse stakeholders. You are encouraged to respect the cultural, social, personal values and differences of the people with whom you work and serve.\n\n1 U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics. (2023, Sept. 6).

Due to COVID-19, data from 2020 to 2022 may be atypical compared to prior years. BLS calculates the median using salaries of workers nationwide with varying levels of education and experience. It does not reflect the earnings of GCU graduates as personal financial advisors, nor does it reflect earnings of workers in one city or region of the country or a typical entry-level salary. Median income is the statistical midpoint for the range of salaries in a specific occupation. It represents what you would earn if you were paid more money than half the workers in an occupation, and less than half the workers in an occupation. It may give you a basis to estimate what you might earn at some point if you enter this career. Grand Canyon University can make no guarantees on individual graduates’ salaries. Your employability will be determined by numerous factors over which GCU has no control, such as the employer the graduate chooses to apply to, the graduate’s experience level, individual characteristics, skills, etc., against a pool of candidates."
