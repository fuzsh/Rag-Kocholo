        "meta_description": "2022 Subscribers: you will automatically receive this title in your January shipment. Remember to use the \"I'm a subscriber...\" free shipping option to add additional products to your package. This limited edition and painstakingly crafted box set (designed by Earl Kessler Jr.) is limited to 6,000 units and is only available here at VinegarSyndrome.com! As the popularity of the giallo genre began to dwindle in the late 70s through mid 80s, producers and directors needed a new hook to lure in audiences to see mysterious killers violently dispatching their victims. They found their answer in sex. Collected here are three mystery and mayhem filled gialli from just after the end of the golden age, which not only feature gruesome kills, but are also jam packed with plenty of sex and nudity. -- ARABELLA BLACK ANGEL: Beautiful Arabella is an insatiable nymphomaniac with a crippled writer husband, Francesco, who is unable to pleasure her. Instead, Arabella searches for lovers in elicit dens of debauchery, bedding an endless array of men. However when her husband discovers her having sex with a stranger in their shed, Arabella panics and kills the man, only to discover that her sudden act of violence arouses creative inspiration in her Francesco. Covering up the crime, Francesco asks his wife to further explore her sexual fantasies and report back on her experiences. Unfortunately, Arabella’s lovers are subsequently visited by someone else…a vengeful murderer who violently castrates them…Of all of Italy’s plentiful sex focused gialli, produced as the genre was winding down in popularity, few were anywhere near as outlandish as prolific cinematographer turned director Stelvio Massi’s ARABELLA BLACK ANGEL. Loaded with visual flair juxtaposed with bloody murders, Vinegar Syndrome is delighted to present the worldwide Blu-ray debut of this deliriously sleazy giallo, newly restored in 2K from its original negative. directed by: Stelvio Massistarring: Tinì Cansino, Francesco Casale, Valentina Visconti1989 / 89 min / 1.33:1 / Italian with English Subtitles & English Dub • Region Free Blu-ray• Newly scanned & restored in 2K from its 35mm original camera negative• Features both its original Italian language soundtrack and optional English dub• Audio essay by author & critic Alexandra Heller-Nicholas • Alternate English titles• Inside sleeve artwork• Newly translated English subtitles -- THE KILLER IS STILL AMONG US: Christiana is a college student who is studying criminology. After becoming intrigued by a vicious murder and mutilation of a young couple on a secluded lover’s lane, Christiana begins her own investigation into the slayings. As she gathers clues that she hopes might lead to the killer’s identity, she begins to find strange parallels between her unassuming boyfriend. And when the killer strikes again, Christiana becomes increasingly afraid that she is, in fact, living with a depraved sex killer… Based on a series of heinous and still unsolved serial murders committed in Florence throughout the 70s and 80s, Camillo Teti’s (Killer Crocodile) directorial debut, THE KILLER IS STILL AMONG US, blends true crime and stylish thriller, while playing through a series of unflinchingly shocking and brutal murders. Co-scripted by giallo legend Ernesto Gastaldi (My Dear Killer), this low key and very nasty giallo comes to Blu-ray for the first time from Vinegar Syndrome, newly restored in 4K from its 35mm original negative. directed by: Camillo Tetistarring: Mariangela D'Abbraccio, Giovanni Visentin, Riccardo Parisio Perrotti, Luigi Mezzanotte1986 / 83 min / 1.66:1 / Italian Mono with English Subtitles • Region Free Blu-ray• Newly scanned & restored in 4K from its 35mm original camera negative• Commentary track with author & critic Rachael Nisbet • Original theatrical trailer• Inside sleeve artwork• Newly translated English subtitles -- THE SISTER OF URSULA: Timid and reserved, though mildly psychotic, Ursula and her lusty sister Dagmar, along with Dagmar’s drug dealing friend Filippo, have arrived at a beautiful, seaside hotel in order to locate their estranged mother, to complete their obligations in regards to an inheritance. But shortly after their arrival, they become embroiled in a web of terror as a black clad mystery assailant begins murdering other guests with a most unusual weapon…One of the earliest sex-gialli, and certainly among the most memorable weapons in the history of the genre, Enzo Milioni’s THE SISTER OF URSULA packs in copious amounts of softcore sex between the killings and co-stars Barbara Magnolfi (Suspiria), Stefania D'Amario (Zombie), and Marc Porel (The Psychic). Vinegar Syndrome is proud to present the North American Blu-ray debut of this notorious fan favorite from a new 4K restoration. directed by: Enzo Milionistarring: Stefania D'Amario, Barbara Magnolfi, Marc Porel, Vanni Materassi, Anna Zinnemann1978 / 95 min / 1.85:1 / Italian Mono with English Subtitles • Region Free Blu-ray• Newly scanned & restored in 4K from its 35mm original camera negative• Commentary track with author & critic Alexandra Heller-Nicholas • “Father of Ursula” - an archival interview with writer/director Enzo Milioni • Original theatrical trailer• Inside sleeve artwork• Newly translated English subtitles Vinegar Syndrome is the premiere online destination for cult classic movies on DVD and blu-ray from the 70's, 80's and 90's.",

No sooner have they set up all of their ghost-catching gadgetry than the hauntings begin: from randy spirits to unexplained manifestations, all the signs of the afterlife incarnate are present.
