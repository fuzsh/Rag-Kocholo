(NASDAQ: VTRS) today announced strong financial results for the second quarter of 2024, including total revenues of $3.8 billion and new product revenues of $210 million, demonstrating the Company's ability to continue to grow its diversified base business.\n\nWith the substantial completion of its divestitures the Company believes it has increased its financial strength and has a strong foundation from which to accelerate growth and shareholder return.\n\n\"I am pleased to report strong second quarter results in which we delivered divestiture-adjusted operational revenue growth across all segments, including strong growth in Greater China. This represents our fifth consecutive quarter of divestiture-adjusted operational revenue growth and demonstrates our ability to execute and grow our base business,\" said Scott A. Smith, CEO, Viatris. \"With our divestitures behind us and a strong foundation to build on, we believe we are at an inflection point for our Company. In our next chapter, our strategy will focus on three main pillars: our diversified and growing base business, our financial strength and significant cash flow, and our expanding innovative portfolio. We expect these three pillars will enable us to accelerate growth and shareholder return.\"\n\n\"Our solid fundamentals, including our growing base business, our financial strength and our ability to generate significant cash flow drove our second quarter results,\" said Doretta Mistras, CFO, Viatris. \"We had another quarter of divestiture-adjusted operational revenue growth, up approximately two percent, which benefited from strong new product revenues. Adjusted EBITDA grew approximately two percent and adjusted EPS grew approximately three percent in the quarter, each on a divestiture-adjusted operational basis, supported by strong gross margins and disciplined investment to advance our pipeline. We expect the momentum we are seeing in the business to continue and we believe we are well positioned for a strong second half of the year.\"\n\n[1] For the quarter ended June 30, 2024, total revenues declined ~3% on a U.S. GAAP basis to $3.8 billion.\n\n[2] For the quarter ended June 30, 2024, U.S. GAAP net earnings (loss) declined from $264 million to ($326 million), and U.S. GAAP diluted EPS declined from $0.22 per share to ($0.27) per share on a U.S. GAAP basis.\n\n[3] U.S. GAAP total revenues for 2024 as of August 8, 2024, is estimated to be between $14.60 and $15.10 billion, with a midpoint of $14.85 billion or a full-year decrease of ~4%. Please see \"Financial Guidance\" and \"Non-GAAP Financial Measures\" for additional information.\n\nFinancial Highlights\n\nSecond quarter 2024 total net sales were $3.8 billion, up ~2% on a divestiture-adjusted operational basis compared to second-quarter 2023 results, with divestiture-adjusted operational net sales growth across all segments.\n\nBrands net sales reflect strong growth in Greater China and the expansion of the Company's portfolio in Emerging Markets and JANZ. This was partially offset by unfavorable channel dynamics in North America and the impact of government price regulations in Japan and Australia.\n\nGenerics net sales reflect strong growth from new product launch performances in Developed Markets, continued growth from complex products, and solid performance across our broader European portfolio.\n\nThe Company generated approximately $210 million in new product revenues in the quarter primarily driven by Breyna™, lisdexamfetamine, and other new products globally. The Company's strong year-to-date performance gives it confidence in raising its outlook to approximately $500 million to $600 million in new product revenues in 2024.\n\nU.S. GAAP net loss was $326 million and adjusted EBITDA was $1.2 billion, up ~2% on a divestiture-adjusted operational basis. U.S. GAAP diluted EPS was a loss of $0.27 per share and adjusted EPS was $0.69 per share, up ~3% on a divestiture-adjusted operational basis.\n\nThis quarter's results demonstrate the Company's financial strength, as the Company generated U.S. GAAP net cash provided by operating activities of $379 million, and free cash flow, excluding the impact of transaction costs primarily related to the divestitures, of $426 million, and paid down approximately $800 million of debt.\n\nAdditional Updates\n\nIn July, the Company brought to substantial completion all divestitures with the closing of its Over-the-Counter (OTC) business to Cooper Consumer Health, a leading European over-the-counter drug manufacturer and distributor.\n\nIn June, the Company was named to TIME's World's Most Sustainable Companies 2024 List recognizing leading companies in corporate social responsibility from more than 30 countries.\n\nIn May, the Company published its 2023 Sustainability Report highlighting its actions and initiatives across multiple areas of focus in support of the Company's efforts to continue to be a model for sustainable access to medicine and to make a difference in the communities it serves.\n\nFinancial Guidance\n\nThe following table summarizes the Company's 2024 financial guidance as of August 8, 2024. The Company is not providing forward-looking guidance for U.S. GAAP net (loss) earnings or U.S. GAAP diluted (loss) earnings per share (EPS) or a quantitative reconciliation of its 2024 adjusted EBITDA or adjusted EPS guidance to the most directly comparable U.S. GAAP measures, U.S. GAAP net (loss) earnings or U.S. GAAP diluted EPS, respectively, because it is unable to predict with reasonable certainty the ultimate outcome of certain significant items, including integration, acquisition and divestiture-related expenses, restructuring expenses, asset impairments, litigation settlements, and other contingencies, such as changes to contingent consideration, acquired IPR&D and certain other gains or losses, including for the fair value accounting for non-marketable equity investments, as well as related income tax accounting, because certain of these items have not occurred, are out of the Company's control and/or cannot be reasonably predicted without unreasonable effort. These items are uncertain, depend on various factors, and could have a material impact on U.S. GAAP reported results for the guidance period. With respect to the Estimated Ranges provided as of August 8, 2024, U.S. GAAP net cash provided by operating activities for 2024 is estimated to be between $2.62 billion and $2.92 billion, with a midpoint of approximately $2.77 billion. With respect to the Estimated Ranges provided as of May 9, 2024, Viatris did not provide forward-looking guidance for U.S. GAAP net earnings or U.S. GAAP diluted EPS or a quantitative reconciliation of its 2024 adjusted EBITDA or adjusted EPS guidance. Please see \"Non-GAAP Financial Measures\" for additional information. With respect to the Estimated Ranges provided on May 9, 2024, U.S. GAAP net cash provided by operating activities for 2024 was estimated to be between $2.71 billion and $3.01 billion, with a midpoint of approximately $2.86 billion. The Company currently expects to be at the midpoint of the August 8, 2024, guidance ranges.\n\nConference Call and Earnings Materials\n\nViatris will host a conference call and live webcast, today at 8:30 a.m. ET, to review the Company's second quarter 2024 financial results.\n\nInvestors and the general public are invited to listen to a live webcast of the call at investor.viatris.com or by calling 844.308.3344 or 412.317.1896 for international callers.

These non-GAAP financial measures, including, but not limited to, adjusted gross profit, adjusted gross margins, adjusted net earnings, adjusted EPS, EBITDA, adjusted EBITDA, free cash flow, free cash flow excluding the impact of transaction costs primarily related to the divestitures, adjusted R&D and as a % of total revenues, adjusted SG&A and as a % of total revenues, adjusted earnings from operations, adjusted interest expense, adjusted other income, net, adjusted effective tax rate, constant currency total revenues, constant currency net sales, constant currency adjusted EBITDA, constant currency adjusted EPS, and divestiture-adjusted operational change, are presented in order to supplement investors' and other readers' understanding and assessment of the financial performance of Viatris Inc. (\"Viatris\" or the \"Company\"). Free cash flow refers to U.S. GAAP net cash provided by operating activities less capital expenditures. Management uses these measures internally for forecasting, budgeting, measuring its operating performance, and incentive-based awards. Primarily due to acquisitions, divestitures and other significant events which may impact comparability of our periodic operating results, Viatris believes that an evaluation of its ongoing operations (and comparisons of its current operations with historical and future operations) would be difficult if the disclosure of its financial results was limited to financial measures prepared only in accordance with U.S. GAAP. We believe that non-GAAP financial measures are useful supplemental information for our investors and when considered together with our U.S. GAAP financial measures and the reconciliation to the most directly comparable U.S. GAAP financial measure, provide a more complete understanding of the factors and trends affecting our operations. The financial performance of the Company is measured by senior management, in part, using adjusted metrics included herein, along with other performance metrics. In addition, the Company believes that including EBITDA and supplemental adjustments applied in presenting adjusted EBITDA is appropriate to provide additional information to investors to demonstrate the Company's ability to comply with financial debt covenants and assess the Company's ability to incur additional indebtedness. The Company also believes that adjusted EBITDA better focuses management on the Company's underlying operational results and true business performance and is used, in part, for management's incentive compensation. We also report sales performance using the non-GAAP financial measures of \"constant currency\", also referred to herein as \"operational change\", total revenues, net sales, adjusted EBITDA, and adjusted EPS. These measures provide information on the change in total revenues, net sales, adjusted EBITDA, and adjusted EPS assuming that foreign currency exchange rates had not changed between the prior and current period. The comparisons presented at constant currency rates reflect comparative local currency sales at the prior year's foreign exchange rates. We routinely evaluate our net sales, total revenues, adjusted EBITDA, and adjusted EPS performance at constant currency so that sales results can be viewed without the impact of foreign currency exchange rates, thereby facilitating a period-to-period comparison of our operational activities, and believe that this presentation also provides useful information to investors for the same reason. Divestiture-adjusted operational change refers to operational change, further adjusted for the impact of divestitures that have closed during 2023 and 2024 by excluding proportionate net sales from those divested businesses from comparable prior periods. The \"Summary of Total Revenues by Segment\" table below compares net sales on an actual and constant currency basis for each reportable segment for the quarters and six months ended June 30, 2024 and 2023 as well as for total revenues, as well as divestiture adjusted operational change in net sales and total revenues. Also, set forth below, Viatris has provided reconciliations of such non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable U.S. GAAP financial measures. Investors and other readers are encouraged to review the related U.S. GAAP financial measures and the reconciliations of the non-GAAP measures to their most directly comparable U.S. GAAP measures set forth below, and investors and other readers should consider non-GAAP measures only as supplements to, not as substitutes for or as superior measures to, the measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. For additional information regarding the components and uses of Non-GAAP financial measures refer to Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations--Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures section of Viatris' Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the three months ended June 30, 2024.\n\nWith respect to the Estimated Ranges as provided as of May 9, 2024, at that time the Company did not provide forward-looking guidance for U.S. GAAP net earnings (loss) or U.S. GAAP diluted EPS or a quantitative reconciliation of its 2024 adjusted EBITDA or adjusted EPS guidance to the most directly comparable U.S. GAAP measures, U.S. GAAP net earnings (loss) or U.S. GAAP diluted EPS, respectively, because it was unable to predict with reasonable certainty the ultimate outcome of certain significant items, including integration, acquisition and divestiture-related expenses, restructuring expenses, asset impairments, litigation settlements and other contingencies, such as changes to contingent consideration, acquired IPR&D and certain other gains or losses, including for the fair value accounting for non-marketable equity investments, as well as related income tax accounting, because certain of these items had not occurred, were out of the Company's control and/or could be reasonably predicted without unreasonable effort. These items were uncertain, depended on various factors, and could have had a material impact on U.S. GAAP reported results for the guidance period. As previously disclosed, such guidance ranges included the full-year expected performance for the then-pending announced divestiture of substantially all of our OTC business and excluded any potential related costs, such as taxes and transaction costs, as well as any acquired IPR&D to be incurred in any future period as it could not be reasonably forecasted.\n\nCertain Key Terms and Presentation Matters\n\nNew product sales, new product launches or new product revenues: Refers to revenue from new products launched in 2024 and the carryover impact of new products, including business development, launched within the last 12 months.\n\nOperational change: Refers to constant currency percentage changes and is derived by translating amounts for the current period at prior year comparative period exchange rates, and in doing so shows the percentage change from 2024 constant currency net sales, revenues, adjusted EBITDA, and adjusted EPS to the corresponding amount in the prior year.\n\nDivestiture-adjusted operational change: Refers to operational changes, further adjusted for the impact of the proportionate results from the divestitures that closed in 2023 and 2024, from the 2023 period by excluding such net sales from those divested businesses from comparable prior periods. Also, for adjusted EBITDA and adjusted EPS, refers to operational changes, adjusted as outlined in the previous sentence and further adjusted for the mark up for the TSA services provided to Biocon Biologics from the 2023 period.\n\nSG&A and R&D TSA reimbursement: Expenses related to TSA services provided for divested businesses are recorded in their respective functional line item; however, reimbursement of those expenses plus the mark-up is included in other expense (income), net. For comparability purposes, amounts related to the cost reimbursement were reclassified to adjusted SG&A and adjusted R&D during 2023 and the first quarter of 2024. This reclassification had no impact on adjusted net earnings, adjusted EBITDA or adjusted EPS.\n\nClosed divestitures or divestitures closed in 2023 and 2024: Refers to the divestiture of the Company's rights to two women's healthcare products in certain countries (other than the U.K., which remains subject to regulatory approval) that closed in December 2023, the divestitures of the commercialization rights in certain of the Upjohn Distributor markets that closed in 2023 and 2024, the divestiture of the women's healthcare business that closed in March 2024, and the divestiture of the API business in India that closed in June 2024.\n\nForward-Looking Statements\n\nThis release contains \"forward-looking statements\".
