        "text": "There is no U.S. Embassy or Consulate in French Polynesia. However, there is a U.S. Consular Agent in French Polynesia who can provide assistance. You may also contact the U.S. Embassy in Suva, Fiji.\n\nCentre Tamanu Iti, 1er etage\n\n98718 Punaauia\n\nFrench Polynesia\n\nTelephone: +(689) 4042-6535\n\nEmergency After-Hours Telephone: Please contact the U.S. Embassy duty officer in Suva, Fiji: +(679) 772-8049\n\nFax: +(689) 4050-8096\n\nEmail: USConsul@mail.pf\n\nU.S. Embassy Suva\n\n158 Princes Rd, Tamavua\n\nSuva, Fiji Islands\n\nTelephone: +(679) 331-4466\n\nEmergency After-Hours Telephone: +(679) 772-8049\n\nFax: +(679) 330-2267\n\nEmail: SuvaACS@state.gov\n\nU.S. citizens do not need a visa if entering on a regular tourist passport and staying no more than 90 days out of every six months. If the purpose of the trip is not tourism (work, scientific research, etc.), then you may be required to obtain a visa before arrival in French Polynesia. If traveling as a tourist, you must be in possession of a return ticket.\n\nFor further information about entry requirements, particularly if entering by sea, contact the French Ministry of Foreign Affairs or the French Embassy at 4101 Reservoir Road NW, Washington, DC 20007, telephone 202-944-6200, fax 202-944-6212, or visit the Embassy of France's web site.\n\nThe U.S. Department of State is unaware of any HIV/AIDS entry restrictions for visitors to or foreign residents of French Polynesia.\n\nFind information on dual nationality, prevention of international child abduction and customs regulations on our websites.\n\nPublic Safety: Protests and strikes periodically occur and can sometimes be violent. Messages regarding possible social unrest, and natural disasters are posted on the embassy’s website.\n\nCrime: Although French Polynesia has a low crime rate, petty crime, such as pick pocketing and purse snatching, does occur. You should secure your valuables at all times and remain particularly vigilant at night. Make sure you lock your doors and secure your windows.\n\nSee our website and the FBI pages for information on scams.\n\nVictims of Crime:\n\nU.S. citizen victims of sexual assault should contact the U.S. Embassy.\n\nReport crimes to the local police at 17 (emergencies) and contact the U.S. Consular Agency at +689 4042-6535.\n\nRemember that local authorities are responsible for investigating and prosecuting the crime.\n\nSee our webpage on help for U.S. victims of crime overseas.\n\nWe can:\n\nhelp you find appropriate medical care\n\nassist you in reporting a crime to the police\n\ncontact relatives or friends with your written consent\n\nexplain the local criminal justice process in general terms\n\nprovide a list of local attorneys\n\nprovide our information on victim’s compensation programs in the U.S.\n\nprovide an emergency loan for repatriation to the United States and/or limited medical support in cases of destitution\n\nhelp you find accommodation and arrange flights home\n\nreplace a stolen or lost passport\n\nDomestic Violence: U.S. citizen victims of domestic violence may contact the Embassy for assistance.\n\nTourism: The tourism industry is generally regulated and rules with regard to best practices and safety inspections are regularly enforced. Hazardous areas/activities are identified with appropriate signage and professional staff is typically on hand in support of organized activities. In the event of an injury, appropriate medical treatment is widely available throughout the country. Outside of a major metropolitan center, it may take more time for first responders and medical professionals to stabilize a patient and provide life-saving assistance. U.S. citizens are encouraged to purchase medical evacuation insurance. See our webpage for more information on insurance providers for overseas coverage.\n\nCriminal Penalties: You are subject to local laws. If you violate local laws, even unknowingly, you may be expelled, arrested, or imprisoned.\n\nPlease ensure that items you purchase in French Polynesia are not pirated or counterfeit. Purchasing or owning these items may have legal consequences in French Polynesia or the United States.\n\nFurthermore, some laws are also prosecutable in the U.S., regardless of local law. For examples, see our website on crimes against minors abroad and the Department of Justice website.\n\nArrest Notification: If you are arrested or detained, ask police or prison officials to notify the U.S. Embassy immediately. See our webpage for further information.\n\nFaith-Based Travelers: See the following webpages for details:\n\nFaith-Based Travel Information\n\nInternational Religious Freedom Report – see country reports\n\nHuman Rights Report – see country reports\n\nHajj Fact Sheet for Travelers\n\nBest Practices for Volunteering Abroad\n\nLGBTQI+ Travelers: There are no legal restrictions on same-sex sexual relations or the organization of LGBTQI+ events in French Polynesia.\n\nSee our LGBTQI+ Travel Information page and section 6 of our Human Rights report for further details.\n\nTravelers Who Require Accessibility Assistance. While in French Polynesia, individuals with disabilities may find accessibility and accommodation different from what you find in the United States. The law prohibits discrimination against persons with physical or mental disabilities in employment, education, access to health care, and the provision of other state services. The French Polynesian government generally enforces these provisions effectively.\n\nFrench Polynesia subscribes to laws that require disability accommodations, and many new buildings with public or community space are accessible. Many existing buildings as well as transportation systems do not yet meet these requirements. Accessibility is a requirement, however, for new construction.\n\nStudents: See our Students Abroad page and FBI travel tips.\n\nWomen Travelers: See our travel tips for Women Travelers.\n\nMedical treatment is generally good on the major islands, but is limited in more remote or less populated areas. In less populated areas where there are no hospitals, medical assistance can be found at a Dispensaire, a French government-run free clinic. Patients with emergencies or serious illnesses are often referred to facilities on Tahiti for treatment. In emergencies, evacuation by air to Papeete may be required. For medical emergencies in French Polynesia, dial 15 for an ambulance.\n\nThe Department of State does not pay medical bills. Be aware that U.S. Medicare/Medicaid does not apply overseas.\n\nMedical Insurance: Make sure your health insurance plan provides coverage overseas. Most care providers overseas only accept cash payments. See our webpage for more information on insurance providers for overseas coverage. Visit the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention for more information on type of insurance you should consider before you travel overseas.\n\nWe strongly recommend supplemental insurance to cover medical evacuation.\n\nMedication: If traveling with prescription medication, check with the government of French Polynesia to ensure the medication is legal in French Polynesia. Always carry your prescription medication in original packaging with your doctor’s prescription.\n\nVaccinations: Be up-to-date on all vaccinations recommended by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Travelers should consider being vaccinated for hepatitis A and typhoid, which can be transmitted through contaminated food and water.\n\nFurther health information:\n\nWorld Health Organization\n\nU.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)\n\nRoad Conditions and Safety: Road conditions in French Polynesia are different than in the United States. While most major roads are paved, many secondary roads are not. In urban areas, traffic is brisk and vehicles and pedestrians jockey for space on narrow streets. Tourists should exercise caution when driving, particularly at night. While extensive sections of the road circumnavigating the island of Tahiti have streetlights, many side streets do not.\n\nTourists who rent bicycles or mopeds should take extra precautions to avoid collisions, even on roads with little traffic. At night, beware of bicycles operating without proper lights.\n\nTraffic Laws: Crosswalks are marked, and the law requires that motor vehicles stop for pedestrians; however, this law is not always followed in practice. Driving while intoxicated is illegal. Use of a mobile phone while driving is also illegal.\n\nPublic Transportation:Maintain control of your personal belongings on public transportation such as buses and ferries. Be aware of the possibility of pickpocketing.\n\nSee our Road Safety page for more information.\n\nAviation Safety Oversight: The U.S. Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has assessed the government of French Polynesia’s Civil Aviation Authority as being in compliance with International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) aviation safety standards for oversight of French Polynesia’s air carrier operations. Further information may be found on the FAA’s safety assessment page.\n\nMaritime Travel: Mariners planning travel to French Polynesia should check for U.S. maritime advisories and alerts. Information may also be posted to the U.S. Coast Guard homeport website, and the NGA broadcast warnings website."
