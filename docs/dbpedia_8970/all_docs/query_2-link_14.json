        "text": "The French Pacific Franc (XPF or CFP)\n\nThe official currency used in French Polynesia is the French Pacific Franc (XPF or CFP). The XPF is issued by the French Treasury and is pegged to the Euro at a fixed exchange rate of 1 EUR = 119.33 XPF. This means that the value of the XPF remains stable and does not fluctuate based on the market conditions. The XPF is divided into 100 centimes, and coins are available in denominations of 1, 2, 5, 10, 20 and 50 centimes and 1 and 2 XPF. Banknotes are available in denominations of 5, 10, 20, 50, 100, 500, and 1000 XPF.\n\nExchange Rate\n\nAs of 2021, the exchange rate of XPF to USD is approximately 1 XPF = 0.009 USD. This means that 1 US dollar is equivalent to approximately 111 XPF. However, it’s essential to note that the exchange rate may fluctuate depending on various economic factors, and it’s always a good idea to check the current exchange rate before planning a trip to French Polynesia. This can easily be done by visiting a currency exchange website or by checking with your bank or credit card company. It’s important to keep in mind that the exchange rate might fluctuate and could change before you travel. This means that the cost of goods or services in French Polynesia may fluctuate as well.\n\nWhere to Exchange Currency\n\nWhen arriving in French Polynesia, it’s best to exchange currency at a bank or currency exchange office. These can be found at the airport and in major towns and cities. It’s also a good idea to exchange enough currency to cover your immediate expenses such as transportation, accommodation, and meals. It’s important to note that not all banks or exchange offices will have the same rates, so it’s worth checking with a few different places to get the best deal. Additionally, some places may have a higher commission fee, so it’s worth taking that into consideration as well.\n\nUsing Credit Cards\n\nFrench Polynesia is a popular tourist destination, and most businesses, hotels, and restaurants will accept major credit cards such as Visa, Mastercard, and American Express. However, it’s always a good idea to have some cash on hand, particularly when visiting more remote areas or smaller businesses. It’s also important to note that while credit cards are widely accepted, they may not always be accepted at smaller establishments or in more remote areas. This is particularly true for small local shops, markets or vendors that might only accept cash. In these cases, it’s good to have a small amount of XPF on hand to make purchases. Additionally, it’s important to let your credit card company know that you will be traveling to French Polynesia, to avoid your card being blocked due to suspicious activity.\n\nATMs\n\nATMs are widely available in French Polynesia, and they are a convenient way to withdraw cash in the local currency. However, it’s essential to note that some ATMs may charge a withdrawal fee, and it’s a good idea to check with your bank or credit card company to see if they charge any additional fees for using an ATM in French Polynesia. Additionally, it’s important to note that not all ATMs may accept all types of cards, so it’s a good idea to check the logos on the ATM before attempting to withdraw money. It’s also worth noting that some ATMs may be out of service or may not have a large amount of cash available, so it’s a good idea to have a backup plan in case the ATM you plan to use is unavailable.\n\nTipping\n\nTipping is not expected in French Polynesia, but it is appreciated for exceptional service. A small tip of around 5-10% is appropriate for good service in restaurants and hotels. It’s also worth noting that many restaurants and hotels include a service charge in their prices, so it’s essential to check the bill before leaving a tip. Additionally, it’s worth noting that, while tipping is not expected, it can be a way to show your appreciation for good service.\n\nMoney Saving Tips\n\nFrench Polynesia can be a bit expensive, so it’s a good idea to budget accordingly.\n\nLook for deals and discounts for activities, tours, and accommodations.\n\nResearch the costs of the activities you want to do in advance, so you can budget accordingly.\n\nBring a reusable water bottle, as purchasing bottled water can add up.\n\nConsider staying in a more budget-friendly accommodation option such as a guesthouse or hostel.\n\nCook your meals, if possible, as eating out can be expensive.\n\nConsider using public transportation instead of renting a car or scooter.\n\nAvoid buying souvenirs at tourist shops, as they can be overpriced. Instead, visit local markets and artisans for better deals.\n\nFrench Polynesia is a beautiful and exotic destination that is sure to make for an unforgettable trip. However, it’s essential to understand the local currency and how to manage your finances during your stay. The official currency used in French Polynesia is the French Pacific Franc (XPF or CFP), and the exchange rate is currently approximately 1 XPF = 0.009 USD. It’s important to check the current exchange rate before planning a trip, and to have a mix of cash and credit cards for convenience. Additionally, it’s important to budget accordingly and keep in mind that French Polynesia can be a bit expensive. By following the tips provided in this article, you can ensure that your finances are in order, and you can fully enjoy your time in this tropical paradise."
