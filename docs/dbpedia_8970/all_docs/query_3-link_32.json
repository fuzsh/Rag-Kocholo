You will need to submit transcripts that indicate your successful completion of all FP Canada courses, through your FP Canada™ Portal, approximately one month prior to the scheduled examination sitting or such other date as established by FP Canada. If you are rewriting the exam and have met the requirements within the past four years, you do not need to re-submit your transcripts.\n\nNote: If you're enrolling in the CFP® Professional Education Program for the August 2024 cohort and beyond, the Introduction to Professional Ethics (IPE) course has been integrated into the program and no longer needs to be purchased separately.\n\nSubmit Your Transcript\n\nExam Locations\n\nCandidates have two options for the administration of the CFP exam: writing the exam at an in-person testing centre, or via online proctoring with their own computer from home or another private location. You will be asked to select an in-person test centre or online proctoring as your exam location as part of the registration process for the CFP exam.\n\nPractice Exam\n\nThe Practice Exam is a study tool to help prepare you for the CFP examination. It allows you to experience how the actual exam looks and feels – and most importantly provides feedback on your performance. Candidates who have prepared with the Practice Exam have often reported feeling more familiar with the exam software, said the diagnostic report provided useful feedback on their performance and said they felt better prepared to write the exam. We encourage you to take advantage of this tool and recommend that you complete the Practice Exam early in your preparation process.\n\nOrder the Practice Exam\n\nStudy Toolkit\n\nTips and tools to help you prepare to write the CFP exam.\n\nPreparation Checklist\n\nThis checklist will help you prepare to write the CFP examination.
