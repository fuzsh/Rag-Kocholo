        "text": "Healthcare\n\nHealthcare is free in Wallis and Futuna. The Agence de Santé (Healthcare Agency - ADS) operates two hospitals (Sia in Wallis and Kaleveleve in Futuna) and three dispensaries in the districts of Mua, Hahake and Hihifo (Wallis). You should dial 15 to call the emergency services.\n\nIn the event of an emergency, the SIA hospital in Wallis and the Kaleveleve annex facility in Futuna will take care of you.\n\nWallis\n\nSIA Hospital\n\nby the RT1 main road, Mata’Utu (Hahake)\n\nTel : (+681) 72 07 00\n\nFutuna\n\nKaleveleve Hospital\n\nTaoa (Kingdom of Alo)\n\nTel :(+681) 72 39 00\n\nTelephone, internet and mail\n\nThe Service des Postes et Télécommunications (SPT) is responsible for postage and mail processing, mail order processing, and the sale of stamps, SIM cards (SPT only), and mobile/4G top-ups (also on sale at convenience stores). There are no mailboxes in Wallis and Futuna, so mail must be posted at an SPT branch.\n\nLocated near the main SPT agency in Wallis, stamp enthusiasts will find a philately section featuring special issues and collections.\n\nThe local mobile network is called Manuia. Only a handful of foreign mobile operators currently cover Wallis and Futuna (SaskTel, Digiciel, Orange, CSL, Telecom, OPT, Vodafone, Sunrise, Tikophone & TVL).\n\nWallis - Main Post Office\n\nMata’Utu Branch (SPT headquarters): Place Sagato Soane, in Mata’Utu (Hahake)\n\nTel: (+681) 72 08 00 or 14 (toll-free)\n\nOpening hours: Monday to Thursday 7.30 a.m. - 2.30 p.m.; Friday 7.30 a.m. - 1.30 p.m.\n\nFutuna - Main Post Office\n\nLieu-dit Faletoa, in Leava (Sigave)\n\nTel : (+681) 72 36 00\n\nwww.spt.wf\n\nOpening hours: Monday to Thursday 7.30 a.m. - 2.30 p.m.; Friday 7.30 a.m. - 1.30 p.m.\n\nPayments and cash withdrawals\n\nThe Wallis and Futuna currency is the Pacific Franc (CFP Franc - international code XPF), also used in the other French Pacific territories (New Caledonia, French Polynesia). The Pacific Franc is pegged to the Euro.\n\n1 € = 119.3317 XPF\n\n1 XPF = 0.00838 €\n\nThere are notes for values of 500, 1000, 5000 and 10,000 XPF and coins for values of 1, 2, 5, 10, 20, 50 and 100 XPF.\n\nThe Bank of Wallis and Futuna (BWF), a subsidiary of BNP Paribas New Caledonia, is the only retail bank in the territory and has a permanent branch in Wallis. The BWF operates two ATMs - one outside the main branch in the Fenuarama shopping mall in Mata’Utu and a second outside the Mata’Utu SPT post office in Place Sagato Soane.\n\nThere is only one cash withdrawal ATM in Futuna, operated by the BWF. It is located next to the Futuna SPT branch in Faletoa, Leava (Sigave).\n\nPlease note: While payment by credit card is becoming increasingly widespread, many shops and stores do not have point-of-sale terminals.\n\nShops & stores\n\nMost shops are open from 6 a.m. to midday and 3 p.m. to 7 p.m.\n\nFenuarama shopping mall\n\nLocated in Mata’Utu (Wallis), Fenuarama is the only shopping mall in the two islands. The mall includes a supermarket, the Banque de Wallis et Futuna (BWF) headquarters, the Aircalin sales agency, the US Army Presence Museum, a hair salon, shops selling traditional apparel, a hardware store and a jewellery shop. A bakery and a snack bar are also on hand if you’re feeling peckish!\n\nSupermarkets\n\nYou can also do your shopping at a number of small shops in Wallis and Futuna. Ask for a full list of shops at the tourist office.\n\nArts & Crafts\n\nYou’ll find a host of artisans selling handcrafted items. For more info, go to the relevant section.\n\nTransport\n\nThere is no public transport service and no taxis on Wallis or Futuna so to get around, you’ll need to rent a car. If you travel to the islands by boat, passing motorists will probably offer you a lift when they see you on the roadside.\n\nThere is also no public sea-crossing service between Wallis and Futuna.\n\nHow to get here\n\nAir Calédonie International (Aircalin), the only airline on the islands, operates flights to Wallis and Futuna. There are two flights per week (three during school holidays), one of which stops off at Nandi airport in Fiji. Flights depart from New Caledonia, where the airline is based, and land in Wallis, which boasts the only airport equipped to handle international flights.\n\nSo you need to take a flight from Noumea (La Tontouta airport) or Nandi airport in Fiji to reach Wallis.\n\nInter-island flights to Futuna, also operated by Aircalin, leave twice a day from Wallis except on Sundays. Extra return flights may be scheduled during peak periods (school holidays, St. Pierre Chanel feast day…). Aircalin operates inter-island flights using a Twin Otter aircraft with only a dozen seats, so be sure to book in advance! You can book seats directly with Aircalin or at travel agencies in Wallis - Wallis Voyages and Futuna - SB Travel.\n\nAirCalin\n\nTel : (+681) 72 00 00 ou 72 00 01\n\n@ :This email address is being protected from spambots.

Many foreign nationals do not therefore need a visa. You can check your own country is included in this list or find out what you have to do to get a visa, by logging onto the France-Visa website or contacting your nearest French Consulate.\n\nSailing to the islands\n\nCOVID-19 crisis restrictions\n\nIn the context of the current COVID-19 crisis, pleasure craft owners are prohibited until further notice from accessing the Wallis and Futuna Islands.\n\nSpecial authorization may be granted to pleasure craft in distress, suffering damage, or other serious issues, subject to assessment by gendarmerie (police) services. In such event, individuals should comply with all health safety requirements imposed by Health Agency medical teams, including any lockdown measures.\n\nDuring the trade wind season, Wallis and Futuna offers a magnificent stop-off destination for keen sailors looking to complete the Pacific Ocean crossing.\n\nOn landing in Wallis and Futuna, your first port-of-call must be the customs office, then on to the gendarmerie to complete all entry formalities.\n\nThere are customs posts on Mata’Utu quayside in Wallis and Leava quayside in Futuna. Although a little further away, the gendarmerie offices are still an easy walk from the quayside.\n\nAnchorage & mooring in Wallis\n\nGahi Bay is now the only authorized anchorage area. However, we recommend you first deal with entry formalities at Mata’Utu quayside before finding your anchorage/mooring spot.\n\nBrigade des Douanes au quai de Mata’Utu : (+681) 72 29 58\n\nStandard service des Douanes : (+681) 72 14 00\n\n@ : This email address is being protected from spambots. You need JavaScript enabled to view it.\n\nGendarmerie Nationale : (+681) 72 09 00 ou (+681) 72 01 51\n\nAnchorage & mooring in Futuna\n\nSince Futuna has no lagoon, anchorage & mooring areas are fairly limited. The most sheltered and convenient place to anchor is Leava Bay, where you will be close to the quayside and shops.\n\nBrigade des Douanes au quai de Leava : (+681) 72 32 42\n\n@ This email address is being protected from spambots. You need JavaScript enabled to view it.\n\nGendarmerie Nationale : (+681) 72 32 17\n\nOther important information\n\nMains power and sockets: mains supply is 220V and sockets/wall plugs are the same as in France.\n\nWater: Tap water is safe to drink in Wallis. It is only safe to drink in some parts of Futuna but people commonly drink tap water all over the island, except in rainy weather.\n\nAccess for persons with reduced mobility (PMR): Unfortunately, there are very few sites or buildings equipped with PMR access. The Territory making every effort to improve facilities to provide suitable access.\n\nA welcome for all: The people of Wallis and Futuna are openhearted and tolerant; your religious beliefs, sexual orientation or ethnic origins are your own business and everybody is welcome! People traveling alone need have no worries - our islands are safe and almost completely crime-free.\n\nA few rules...\n\nBefore setting off to visit a beauty spot or tourist attraction, check that it is not privately owned and that you don’t need to ask permission in advance.\n\nBeaches in front of houses belong to the house owner, so it is customary to ask permission or make yourself known before swimming there.\n\nPlease behave respectfully at all heritage sites. At some sites, certain customs must be respected; for example, it may be forbidden to wear a flower necklace…\n\nDuring a kava ceremony, it is forbidden to stand up and to move around. The customary guards will immediately point out any “faux pas”.\n\nIn many churches, as is commonly the case, it is customary to remove your hat or headgear and, of course, to be correctly attired.\n\nThe best way to avoid gaffes and learn about local customs is to ask our tourism professionals or the cultural affairs department.\n\nFrequently asked questions\n\n{sliders}\n\n{slider How do I travel to Wallis?}\n\nAircalin (Air Caledonia International) is the only airline operating flights to Wallis.\n\nThere are 2 return flights between Noumea and Wallis every week, on Wednesdays and Saturdays: flight time is 3 hours. An additional flight is scheduled during the holiday period. Some flights make a brief stop at Nandi, Fiji, just 1.5 hours from Wallis, so you can also travel to Wallis via Nandi. However, during the Covid-19 crisis, no flights currently stop off at Fiji.\n\nDeparting from France, the shortest route is via Tokyo or Seoul, then Noumea (New Caledonia) with Air France and then Air Calédonie International.\n\nAn economy class airfare costs around 2,500 euros.\n\nTo plan your stay and book your flights, we recommend you contact one of the local travel agencies - Wallis Voyages in Wallis or SB Travel in Futuna.\n\n{/slider}\n\n{slider How do I travel to Futuna?}\n\nThere are 2 return flights, 6 days a week, between Wallis and Futuna; flight time is 50 minutes.

Please check with your chosen airline before departure.\n\n{/slider}\n\n{slider What is the best time of year to travel to Wallis and Futuna?}\n\nAlthough Wallis and Futuna is an all-year-round holiday destination, the best season is from April to November, when the trade winds cool the air with refreshing breezes.\n\n{/slider}\n\n{slider Can I pay in euros/dollars in Wallis and Futuna?}\n\nThe currency used in Wallis and Futuna is not the euro, but the Pacific Franc (XPF), also used in New Caledonia and French Polynesia (1 € = approx. 119,3317 XPF)\n\nIn both islands, finding shops and restaurants which accept payment in euros or dollars is not easy. We recommend visitors traveling via New Caledonia or Fiji change their cash for XPF francs at airport foreign currency exchange offices to cover immediate expenses on the islands. There is no foreign currency exchange office at Hihifo airport – Wallis or Vela airfield – Futuna.\n\nWallis & Futuna Bank has two ATMs in Wallis and one in Futuna, where visitors can use credit cards to make cash withdrawals (Visa Carte Bleue, Visa Premier, MasterCard and Eurocard).\n\nHowever, you can pay by credit card in most shops, restaurants and hotels.\n\n{/slider}\n\n{slider Do I need a visa to travel to Wallis and Futuna?}\n\nWallis and Futuna are French islands so you need the same documents on arrival as you would for France.

So please be vigilant and always drive carefully if you’re travelling around the islands in a rental or courtesy car.\n\nFor vehicle rentals, just contact a rental service. Visitors from non-EU countries may need an international driving license (same rules as for France).\n\n{/slider}\n\n{slider How do I go about arranging a homestay?}\n\nIf you’re looking for a totally authentic experience sharing in local island life, please get in touch with the Wallis & Futuna Tourism Office.

In Futuna, you can also buy SIM cards at the SPT office in Leava.\n\nSIM card top-ups (calls and data) can be purchased at SPT offices and at various shops (convenience stores, shops and supermarkets).\n\nA few call codes:\n\nTo call Wallis from France, dial 00 + 681 + the local telephone number.\n\nTo call France from Wallis and Futuna, dial 00 + 33 (replaces zero) + the number of your correspondent.\n\nTo call abroad:\n\nJapan: 00 + 81\n\nAustralia: 00 + 61\n\nNew Zealand: 00 + 64\n\nFrench Polynesia 00 + 689\n\nNew Caledonia: 00 + 687\n\n{/slider}\n\n{slider What do I need to pack?}\n\nWith temperatures ranging from 25°C to 32°C throughout the year, summer outfits are all you need for your trip! If you tend to feel the cold, pack a light sweater to keep warm on breezy evenings during the trade wind season (April-November). A swimsuit and flip flops are absolute musts!\n\nA tube of sunscreen (environmentally friendly if possible) is essential to protect you from the sun on the beach, on walking trails or out on the water. Snorkelling gear should also be at the very top of your checklist if you’re planning to explore the underwater world. Aircalin grants fans of scuba diving, sport fishing or kitesurfing (and similar sports) an extra 10kg baggage allowance for sports equipment on flights between Noumea and Wallis.\n\n{/slider}\n\n{slider Which languages are spoken in Wallis and Futuna?}\n\nSince Wallis and Futuna are French islands, French is the official language on both islands. Local languages (Wallisian and Futunan) are the other two languages commonly spoken.\n\nWhile there are few islanders who speak English, it is spoken by most tourism and hospitality professionals.\n\n{/slider}\n\n{slider Covid 19}\n\nIn the context of the current COVID-19 crisis, access to the Wallis and Futuna Islands is restricted until further notice. Passengers from New Caledonia only are allowed to move freely within the islands, with no specific health restrictions.\n\nPassengers from anywhere else must, without exception, contact the Public Information Unit (CIP) at the Prefecture: This email address is being protected from spambots. You need JavaScript enabled to view it.\n\nAny application to enter Wallis and Futuna from France must be justified on compelling medical, family or professional grounds, with supporting documentation. Travellers whose applications have been accepted must comply with strict health guidelines both before their flight and upon arrival.\n\nThank you for your understanding of the necessity for implementing these measures to ensure our islands remain free of COVID cases.\n\nAccess to Wallis and Futuna for pleasure boat owners\n\nPleasure boat owners are prohibited until further notice from accessing the Wallis and Futuna Islands.\n\nSpecial authorization may be granted to pleasure craft in distress, suffering damage, or other serious issues, subject to assessment by gendarmerie (police) services.
