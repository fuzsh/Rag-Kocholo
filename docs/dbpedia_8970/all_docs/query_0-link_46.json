        "text": "E*TRADE from Morgan Stanley charges $0 commission for online US-listed stock, ETF, mutual fund, and options trades. Exclusions may apply and E*TRADE from Morgan Stanley reserves the right to charge variable commission rates. The standard options contract fee is $0.65 per contract (or $0.50 per contract for clients who execute at least 30 stock, ETF, and options trades per quarter). The retail online $0 commission does not apply to Over-the-Counter (OTC) securities transactions, foreign stock transactions, large block transactions requiring special handling, futures, or fixed income investments. Service charges apply for trades placed through a broker ($25). Stock plan account transactions are subject to a separate commission schedule. All fees and expenses as described in a fund's prospectus still apply. Additional regulatory and exchange fees may apply. For more information about pricing, visitÂ etrade.com/pricing.\n\nOffer valid for E*TRADE clients opening one new eligible brokerage (non-retirement) account by 9/30/24 and funded within 60 days of account opening with $50 or more of new funds or securities. Promo code âREWARD24â.\n\nNew clients opening only one account\n\nThis offer applies to clients who (i) are opening one new E*TRADE from Morgan Stanley self-directed brokerage (non-retirement) account (âE*TRADE accountâ); (ii) do not have an existing E*TRADE account; and (iii) do not open any other new E*TRADE accounts for 60 days after enrollment in this offer. If you are an existing client or plan to open more than one E*TRADE account, then please refer to the âExisting Clients or New Clients Opening More than One New Accountâ terms below.\n\nCash credits will be granted based on deposits of new funds or securities from external accounts made within 60 calendar days of account opening.\n\nReward tiers under $200,000 ($50-$999; $1,000-$19,999; $20,000-$99,999; $100,000-$199,999) will be paid within seven business days following the expiration of the 60-day period. However, if you deposit $200,000 or more in the new E*TRADE account, then you will receive your cash credit within seven business days after the date of your deposit, followed by any additional reward owed based on your fulfillment tier at the expiration of the 60-day period. If you have deposited at least $200,000 in the new E*TRADE account and you make subsequent deposits in that new E*TRADE account to reach a higher tier, then you will receive a second cash credit following the close of the 60-day window. For example, if you deposit $250,000 into your new E*TRADE account, then you will receive a cash credit of $800 within seven business days after the date of your deposit. Then if you deposit an additional $300,000 into your new E*TRADE account, then you will receive an additional cash credit of $200 at the end of the 60-day window for a total reward of $1,000. If you deposit $500,000 or more in your new E*TRADE account, then you will receive two cash credits that will total $1,000 within seven business days after the date of your deposit. Cash credits will be paid to the new E*TRADE account where the deposit is made.\n\nExisting clients or new clients opening more than one account are subject to different offer terms. Please click here to view offer terms.\n\nOFFER RULES FOR ALL PARTICIPANTS\n\nThis offer applies only to E*TRADE from Morgan Stanley self-directed (non-retirement) brokerage accounts.\n\nNew funds or securities must (i) be deposited or transferred to the new E*TRADE account within 60 days of enrollment in this offer; (ii) be from accounts outside of E*TRADE; and (iii) remain in the new E*TRADE account (minus any trading losses) for a minimum of six months otherwise your cash credit(s) may be surrendered. For purposes of the value of a deposit, any securities transferred will be valued as of the closing price of that security on the business day the deposit is received as reflected in the transaction history. Removing any deposit or cash during the promotion period (60 days) may result in a lower reward amount or loss of reward.\n\nAny assets transferred to the new E*TRADE account from an existing Morgan Stanley AAA brokerage account(s) will be excluded from the reward amount calculations, at E*TRADEâs sole discretion.\n\nIf you are attempting to enroll in this offer with a Joint Account, then the primary account holder may have to fulfill at the tiers noted before the secondary account holder can enroll in this offer. If you experience any issues when attempting to enroll with a Joint Account, then please contact us at 800-387-2331 and we will be able to assist you with your enrollment.\n\nOFFER LIMITATIONS\n\nThis offer is valid for one new E*TRADE self-directed brokerage (non-retirement) account and funded within 60 days with a qualifying deposit.\n\nThe following account types are excluded from this offer:Â any business (incorporated or unincorporated) accounts, retirement accounts, advisory accounts, E*TRADE Futures accounts, Morgan Stanley AAA brokerage accounts, Morgan Stanley Private Bank, National Association accounts (âExcluded Accountsâ). This offer excludes non-U.S. residents, and residents of any jurisdiction where this offer is not valid. You must be the original recipient of this offer to enroll. Clients may only be enrolled in one offer at a time. This offer cannot be combined with any other offers. Each client is limited to a maximum of two new account offers.\n\nE*TRADE reserves the right to terminate this offer at any time.\n\nThis offer neither is, nor should be construed as a recommendation or solicitation to buy, sell, or hold any security, financial product or instrument or to open a particular account or engage in any specific investment strategy."
