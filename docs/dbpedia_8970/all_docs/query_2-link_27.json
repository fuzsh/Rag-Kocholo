        "text": "The French Pacific Franc (CFP, also known as XPF) is the currency in use. It is pegged to the euro. So as the Euro has devalued against the US dollar, the exchange rate has become more favorable for US cititzens traveling to Tahiti.\n\nWe were there several weeks ago and 100 CFP or XPF equated to about $1.01; today it is up a little to $1.03. This is quite a bit different than the typical exchange rate you will find around the islands. For example, most retailers were exchanging at 100 xpf to $1.17 or higher. And hotels and the PG also exchange at these kind of (or slightly less) rates. We went on a few excursions and they wanted almost $1.25 per 100 xpf (you pay say, 125 dollars for an excursion or 1000 xpf). You can do much better at getting this lower exchange rate and then when you need to buy something or for a private excursion for example, pay with xpf directly. Just on one excursion, we saved nearly $50 by using local currency vs the required exchange rate the excursion operator was \"imposing\".\n\nSo where do you get the xpf/CFP? The best exchange rate for any type of money exchange is typically the ATM. Even a bank often charges a higher rate. So go to the ATM. The best ATM is located RIGHT OUTSIDE the area you leave the Papeete airport after you collect your luggage and go through customs. Just to the left maybe 20 feet in the middle of the wall is an ATM.\n\nRemember that you can only take out, typically, $500 from the ATM (this is based on the policies of your own bank). So for us, that would have been 48,000 XPF; you can't take out that odd amount, so we had to take out 40,000. I found a second ATM right across where the ship docs in Raiatea (if you are doing the 7 day society island cruise) and you can raid that one also if necessary.\n\nNone of these charged a surcharge locally; however, some US banks will tack on a fee, often 1% to use a foreign ATM. Your bank may be different.\n\nWe paid for everything in local currency and saved quite a bit over other exchange mechanisms. Remember that the ATM has fewer \"middle men\" to take a cut. The exchange booths are usually the worst of all, although so is the hotel front desk. Use the ATM; you will be pleased. If you take out too much, then you can always trade it in back on the ship (although you will be subject to another \"hit\").\n\nHope that helps.\n\nWe actually have a currency exchange at a local shopping mall (Westshore Plaza in Tampa); when we inquired about French Polynesian francs, they said they could order them (they're not one of the more common currencies they regularly have on hand). We placed our order on a Saturday (July 21) and had them by Tuesday; there was no shipping charge since we picked them up at the mall. We said we wanted about $200 worth of francs; I think we paid just over $200 (including the exchange fee) for 18,000 francs.\n\nWe didn't actually end up using much local currency since we booked most of our excursions through the ship (and paid by credit card in U.S. $ at the end of the trip). We primarily used the francs for tipping our tour guides/drivers and picking up some small souvenirs.\n\nMany of the small vendors that set up tented tables on Motu Mahana, at the port in Moorea, or in the Bora Bora craft market accepted U.S. dollars. Most did a conversion of 1000 francs = $10 to simplify the pricing, so it was actually better using dollars than francs (more favorable rates). However, shops with actual storefronts are more likely to follow the published bank exchange rates and/or accept credit cards for transactions.\n\nI'd plan to arrive with $200 or so in francs; you can always convert more on the ship. (We didn't actually need to do this, but I've heard others say the ship's rates are pretty good.)"
