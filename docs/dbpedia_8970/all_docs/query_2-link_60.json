It has now been unofficially replaced by the euro or, in Bosnia and Croatia, by the US dollar. but NOT Cuba In 2002 it was reported that the euro would be adopted as an official currency in Cuba's most famous beach resort, Varadero, to the east of Havana on the northern coast. The government wanted to attract more European tourists to the island. But since then the Cuban economy has changed. Millions of tourists now visit Cuba and the currency for them is definitely the Convertible Peso, fixed to the US dollar and worth approximately 23 times the Cuban peso that the locals use. The Government takes an 11% commission each time foreign currency is converted into these pesos. Although some hotels and restaurants will accept euro, as they will in many parts of the world, they do not price in it nor use it as a local currency.\n\nJUMP TO Eurozone Pegged New members Old\n\nII.

Trades around 1=DKK7.4265\n\nHungary pegged the forint to the euro in January 2000. But after loosening the tie in May 2001 it abandoned the peg on 26 February 2008.\n\nJUMP TO Eurozone Pegged New members Old\n\nTen countries joined the EU on 1 May 2004 and another two on 1 January 2007. Five of the 2004 entrants - Cyprus, Estonia, Malta, Slovakia and Slovenia - have now adopted the euro. The others from 2004 and 2007 will all do so eventually. See adoption. Eight more states may join the EU in the next few years. But three existing members of the EU may not adopt the euro at all.\n\nThese seven countries joined the EU in 2004 and 2007 but have not yet joined the euro. Country Currency Progress on joining euro Notes Bulgaria Lev Not in ERMII. No firm target date. Joined EU 1 January 2007. Currency pegged to euro at 1.95583 lev. Czech Republic Koruna (Czech) Not in ERMII. No firm target date. Hungary Forint Not in ERMII. No firm target date. In May 2006 Hungary's new Government set a target of 2010 to join the euro. Latvia Lats In ERMII. No target date. Currency already pegged to euro at 0.702804 lats. Lithuania Litas In ERMII. As soon as possible from 2010. EU Finance Ministers thwarted Lithuania's hopes to join the euro on 1 January 2007 as its inflation rate was too high. Poland New Zloty Not in ERMII. No firm target date. a Romania Leu Not in ERMII. Has set 2014 as its target date to join euro. Joined EU 1 January 2007. The new currency, the leu, replaced the old lei from 1 July 2005 and the lei was phased out on 31 December 2006.\n\nThree more states hope to join the EU in the next few years, with five behind them in the queue. It seems likely that the pace of enlargement of the EU will slow down. Even if these states do eventually join the EU, adopting the Euro would come much later. Acceding Country date of Joining EU Notes Candidate Country Applied to join Notes Turkey 1987 Accession negotiations may begin in October 2005. Reunification of Cyprus and human rights issues continue to delay matters. May join in 2015 or so. Croatia 2003 Croatia presented its formal application to join the EU on 21 February 2003. Accession negotiations began on 17 March 2005. Croatia had hoped to join at the same time as Bulgaria and Romania but 2010 is now the earliest likely date. Republic of Macedonia 2004 Applied to be a candidate in January 2004. It was accepted as a candidate in 2005. It could join 2010-2012. Potential candidates First steps taken Notes Albania 2003 May join in 2015. Bosnia & Herzegovina 2005 May join in 2015. Serbia 2005 Hopes to join in 2015 with other Balkan states. But talks were broken off by the EU over the failure of Serbia to arrest Ratko Mladic who is wanted for trial on war crimes.

A new referendum was promised by the Danish Prime Minister Anders Fogh Rasmussen after he was re-elected for a third term. He told journalists on 22 November 2007 \"The time is approaching. It is the government's view that the people in this parliamentary term should have the opportunity to take a stance on the Danish EU opt-outs. It is the government's view that the opt-outs damage Danish interests.\" No date has yet been set. An opinion poll taken after the introduction of the euro notes and coins showed 57% in favour of joining. The Danish currency is already pegged to the euro through the Exchange Rate Mechanism. Sweden The Swedish people voted by a significant majority to stay out of the euro in a referendum held on 14 September 2003. Despite support for the euro by the political and business establishment the result was 56.1% against, 41.8% in favour of Sweden adopting the euro as its currency. Turnout was 81.2% and 1.9% of votes were neither for nor against.\n\nJUMP TO Eurozone Pegged New members Old\n\nIV.
