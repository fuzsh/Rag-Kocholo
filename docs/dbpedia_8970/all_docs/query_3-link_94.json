        "text": "Ten good reasons to invest in Wallis & Futuna\n\nAs the French Territory located furthest from France, the archipelago of Wallis & Futuna has an economy and tax system which differ from those of other overseas collectivities.\n\nLocal economic players enjoy the benefit of support and funding from the Wallis & Futuna Chamber of Commerce, Industry, Trades and Agriculture (CCIMA) which, in terms of responsibilities and operation, is uniquely designed to take into account the Territory’s special status.\n\nHere are a few good reasons to invest in Wallis & Futuna:\n\nWallis & Futuna - the economy\n\n48.2% of the population is aged between 20 and 59, i.e. around 5,500 people, including 4,000 persons in current employment. The employment rate is stable: 2,065 employees are registered on the books of the Wallis & Futuna social security office, including 60.6% public sector employees with, in addition, 381 government employees paying contributions to French social security offices. Wallis & Futuna has an essentially administered economy.\n\nEstimated GDP in 2005 totalled 150 million euros, i.e. €10,100 per year per inhabitant.\n\nThe monthly minimum salary (SMIG) is 90,000 XPF (750 euros).\n\nWallis & Futuna falls under a specific tax regime, the main feature of which is that there is no income tax, corporate tax or capital gains tax. Territorial revenue is primarily indirect tax-linked (customs duties) and totals 2.5 billion XPF per year (around 208 million euros).\n\nPursuit of a professional activity is subject to payment of a licence, set in accordance with the business sector concerned.\n\nThe resource industry sector (agriculture, stockbreeding, forestry, and fishing) comprises 19% of businesses; arts & crafts production 12%; power and water production 0.5%; construction 11%; trade 31%, and other market services 28%.\n\nThere are approximately 650 licensees in the Territory, 2/3 in Wallis and 1/3 in Futuna.\n\nThe Territory’s economic data is compiled each year in a report issued by the Institut d’Emission d’Outre-Mer (IEOM - central bank for French overseas territories).\n\nGrowth sectors\n\nThe Territorial Assembly has established priority sectors for Wallis & Futuna up to 2030, and is committed to ensuring strong backing for such sectors.\n\nPriorities are:\n\nDeveloping the resource sector\n\nBoosting local business growth\n\nLeveraging the Territory’s digital environment to encourage new investors\n\nExpanding tourism\n\nPromoting marine policy\n\nSafeguarding biodiversity and reducing energy dependence.\n\nCCIMA\n\nAs regards the public authorities, the Wallis & Futuna Chamber of Commerce, Industry, Trades and Agriculture (CCIMA) acts as the representative body for the Territory’s various sectors of activity.\n\nIt is tasked with defending the general interests of licenced professionals, providing aid to business leaders and providing advice and training. The CCIMA combines the responsibilities assigned to three chambers (CCI, CMA, and Chamber of Agriculture) in other French departments.\n\nThe public authorities consult the CCIMA on issues relating to business activities in all three sectors.\n\nDo you have an economic project in Wallis & Futuna? A query concerning our business enterprises? Do you need funding support to set up a business activity?\n\nThe CCIMA is here to provide support and advice, at our offices in Wallis and Futuna or This email address is being protected from spambots.
