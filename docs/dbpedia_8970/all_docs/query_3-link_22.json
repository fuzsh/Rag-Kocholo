        "text": "As an Overseas Collectivity of France, the French National Flag is the official flag of Wallis and Futuna. The island collectivity has an unofficial locally used flag. The unofficial flag of Wallis and Futuna has been relatively unchanged since its inception in the 19th century under the reign of King I.P. Lavelua. This flag features a red field with four white isosceles triangles in the middle. The color red symbolizes courage; while the white color represents purity of ideals. The four triangles represents the three native kings of the islands and the French administrator. The apexes of the triangles are oriented inward and at right angles to each other. The Flag of France outlined in white on two sides, is in the upper hoist quadrant of this local flag. The presence of the French Flag symbolizes the affiliation of the island territory with France.\n\nThe CFP franc is the official currency of the French Overseas Collectivity of Wallis and Futuna. The initials CFP stands for Change Franc Pacifique (\"Pacific Franc Exchange\").\n\nImmediately after the WWII, the weakness of the French franc led to creation of the CFP franc in December 1945. Since 1967, the CFP franc has been issued by the IEOM (Institut d'émission d'outre-mer, \"Overseas Issuing Institute\"). The New Caledonian frac was used in Wallis and Futuna during this time.The new highest denomination 10,000 CFP franc banknote (€83.80) was issued on 1 October 1986. The 500 franc banknote was issued in 1992, and the 1000 and 5000 franc banknotes were issued in 1995. The designs of the 500, 1000, 5000 franc banknotes did not change until 2014, when new designs and sizes were introduced. The coins inscribed with the name Nouvelle-Calédonie were used in Wallis and Futuna. The IEOM circulates in the French Pacific Colonies have sets of metal coins with a face value of 100, 50, 20, 5, 2, and 1 XPF."
