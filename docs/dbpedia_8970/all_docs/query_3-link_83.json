        "text": "Our Undergraduate Certificate in Financial Planning can help you prepare for several career paths. Depending on your current knowledge, education level, and experience, there are many different positions that could benefit from our accredited financial planning certificate:\n\nEntrepreneur\n\nFinancial analyst\n\nInvestment banker\n\nManagement consultant\n\nPersonal financial planner\n\nThe business, finance, and market skills that you gain from our certificate in financial planning can be an asset in many other aspects of the financial planning field as you pursue positions of added responsibility. Additionally, the credits from this certificate may transfer directly into the Bachelor of Science in Business Administration – Financial Planning. Take the next step towards your personal and professional goals with a financial planning certificate from Liberty University.\n\nAdditional education or training may be required for some jobs or occupations. Conferral of a certificate does not guarantee job placement.\n\nHigh School Transcript Policy\n\nApplicants may submit a High School Self-Certification Form in lieu of a final official high school transcript in order to enroll in up to 12 credit hours at Liberty University.\n\nApplicants may submit a college transcript showing 12 or more credits from an accredited institution and a High School Self-Certification Form in lieu of high school transcripts.\n\nStudents must submit official high school transcripts, or official college transcripts showing at least 12 credit hours earned with an acceptable grade point average (GPA) from an accredited institution, in order to register for additional courses.\n\nThe official high school transcript, GED requirement, and High School Self-Certification Form can be waived if the applicant has earned an associate degree or higher.\n\nFinal transcripts must reflect all coursework and final grades received for grades 9-12, a graduation date, and an overall GPA. (Mailed transcripts must be in a sealed and unopened envelope.)\n\nOfficial College Transcript Policy\n\nAn acceptable official college transcript is one that has been issued directly from the institution and is in a sealed envelope. If you have one in your possession, it must meet the same requirements. If your previous institution offers electronic official transcript processing, they can send the document directly to luoverify@liberty.edu.\n\nIf you are an international applicant, you may be required to have your international transcripts reviewed. Information regarding the transcript evaluation process for international students can be found by visiting NACES.\n\nApplicants whose native language is other than English must submit official scores for the Test of English as a Foreign Language (TOEFL) or an approved alternative assessment. For information on alternative assessments or TOEFL waivers, please call Admissions or view the official International Admissions policy.\n\nThis program will help you meet the educational requirements needed to sit for the Certified Financial Planner (CFP) certification exam. Take a look below to see what this certification can do for you.\n\nCertified Financial Planner (CFP)\n\nEarning the highly-respected CFP certification can help set you apart from other financial professionals and give your clients confidence in your skills. One question you may have is “Can I get my CFP without a degree?” While a full bachelor’s degree is not required, you can only take the CFP exam after completing certain academic prerequisites, which can be met through our online certificate in financial planning. With Liberty’s competitive tuition rates, our program can help keep your CFP certification costs down."
