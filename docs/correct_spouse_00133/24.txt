Buckner (29) and his wife, 26 years old model Mia Tyler (both on the photo in happier times), decided to split up. A spokesman declared:

\"After taking steps toward trying to improve their marriage, Mia and Dave have mutually decided that their lives are heading in different directions and they each want different things for their futures.\"

Tyler is a daughter of Aerosmith frontman Steven Tyler and the half sister of actress / model Liv Tyler.

The musician and the model, who have been married nearly two years, wed during an Aerosmith concert in Las Vegas in 2003.
