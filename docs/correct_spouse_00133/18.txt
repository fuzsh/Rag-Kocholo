Mia Tyler is expecting her first child.

The daughter of Aerosmith frontman Steven Tyler shared the big news on Instagram on Friday.

The 37-year-old posted a picture of her growing baby bump, gushing: 'My front bump is almost as big as my butt bump!'

Mia finished off her pregnancy announcement by adding: 'Insanely excited to tell the world that our baby will be here this spring.'

She wore all-black in the snap, sporting a form-fitting, short-sleeved T-shirt that highlighted her burgeoning belly.

She teamed that with a pair of skintight, black leggings, finishing off the look with black boots.

Mia showed off her sleeve of tattoos in the selfie, in which her long, dark tresses were worn in a center part, and styled straight.

The artist, who was previously married to David Buckner from 2003-2005, has most recently been linked to Dan Halen.

She did not tag him in the post sharing her good news, but had celebrated him last month as her 'man crush everyday,' gushing: 'And by crush I literally mean I want to crush him. Because I love him. And want to crush him.'

And the photographer has likely gotten some practice taking care of babies, after bonding with her nieces and nephews from half-sister Liv Tyler.

She has gushed about them on her Instagram account, and recently shared a snap of herself with Liv's new daughter Lula Rose.
