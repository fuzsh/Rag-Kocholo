        "text": "Pastor David started life in Rochester, New York. As a young man he entered the U.S. Army and completed 10 years of service. He settled in Colorado in 1994 and worked from that time until 2004 as a business analyst for some large organizations. Then in 2004 he started his own business through 2012. Married to his wonderful wife and co-pastor Nancy Buckner, they have one son Derek who is a U.S. Marine and a beautiful grandchild Aubrey. Pastor David graduated from Global University/Berean School of the Bible and is licensed through Marilyn Hickey Ministries and Orchard Road Christian Center after completing their Minister in Training School. David and Nancy planted House of Purpose Church on East Colfax on Easter 2013.\n\nDavid was born again in 1982 in Rochester, New York, as a result of Nicky Cruz sharing the gospel at the Rochester War Memorial. David was chasing adrenaline and leading others into a very dangerous, destructive, and often violent street lifestyle. He was seeing many of his young friends die. Prior to becoming born again someone gave him the book The Cross and the Switch Blade (by David Wilkerson and John and Elizabeth Sherrill) to read. He knew the Lord was speaking to him about his life and trying to reach him. At the Nicky Cruz event he felt compelled to go down to the altar. Nicky Cruz put his hands on David’s shoulders and started praying over him. He was delivered of much that night.\n\nOver the years before becoming a pastor, David was in leadership in the small groups at Orchard Road Christian Center. He led the Men of Purpose group for several years. He established a Kingdom Business Alliance chapter in the Denver Tech Center. He started the New Commandment Ministry at Orchard Road Christian Center which ministered to widows and single mothers by performing home and car maintenance for them at their houses. In addition David was the Veterans Ministry liaison while at ORCC. As a veteran himself David has always had a heart for the veterans’ community. He is a member of the American Legion and the Disabled American Veterans Auxiliary.\n\nDavid felt the call to pastor for many years. While at Orchard Road Christian Center he joined the Minister in Training School and was given the opportunity to speak at various churches. In 2013 God opened up a door to plant a new church in the Disabled American Veterans building on East Colfax. House of Purpose was birthed. The mission of House of Purpose is to resurrect the purpose, passion, and dreams of individuals in the community and also to serve those who have served. In addition, as an avid motorcycle rider, David has a heart to reach one-percenters and other bikers and is an active member of the Christian Riders Motorcycle Ministry.\n\nStrategically located in Denver but just blocks from Aurora, House of Purpose brings God’s light to East Colfax in the heart of a neighborhood struggling with poverty, homelessness, addiction, and violence. There on one the most violent streets in the country David lead teams in street and motel ministry. He and his teams often find many people who are MIA from an everyday productive life and estranged from their families, dealing with emotional struggles, mental illness, and often are self-medicating. David firmly believes that God has planted House of Purpose because He cares for each individual. He is the Good Shepherd who wants to leave the ninety-nine sheep in the fold and go in search of the one lost sheep. Through prayer and the power of the Holy Spirit people are transformed and receive new hope and passion for life. As they spend time in God’s presence, they find out the purpose for which God created them.\n\nPastor Nancy is a Colorado native who grew up in Lakewood. Nancy was a Baptist Church girl, and asked the Lord to be her Savior at the young age of 5. As Nancy grew older she wanted to see what it was like on the other side of the fence. After college she worked as a software engineer for Motorola in Phoenix. She got to travel and do many different things. Something was missing though. While life looked good on the outside, she was filled with loneliness and emptiness. But God had a plan. The year she turned 30 she moved back to Denver and also met some new friends who introduced her to the baptism of the Holy Spirit, and life as she knew it changed completely.\n\nNancy began working at Marilyn Hickey Ministries as a Prayer Warrior who prayed with people over the phone. It was while working there that she met Pastor David. They were married in 2007. Nancy continues to serve as Executive Director of Operations at Marilyn Hickey Ministries and Sarah Bowling –Living Genuine Love.\n\nNancy’s passion is House of Purpose. She loves to make sure everyone feels loved and included. Nancy also has a passion for studying the Word of God. The Word is alive and powerful and meant to be prayed and declared every day. She would love to have you come to House of Purpose so you can find out what the Word of God and the Holy Spirit can do to fulfill your purpose and transform your life."
