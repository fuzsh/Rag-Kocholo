        "text": "I was born and raised a Red Sox fan.\n\nI can remember my mom letting me stay up late to watch the 1986 World Series. I watched the ball roll between Bill Buckner's legs when I was 11-years-old.\n\nI continued to be a Red Sox fan until about 1991 when I stopped paying attention to sports all together.\n\nI was too enamored with girls, punk rock, skateboards and cigarettes.\n\nI didn't pay attention to pro sports again until about 1995 when I met a great bunch of guys from Albany, New York. They were in a punk rock band called \"All Fall Down.\"\n\nI spent a lot of time with them and eventually even played in the band for a while. They were all huge Yankees fans.\n\nSo I, not feeling that I had any allegiance to anything but Gibson guitars and beer, decided to go with it and start routing for the Yankees.\n\nI payed close attention for a couple of years and then my interest started to dwindle and I was once again not paying too much attention to baseball. I was far more interested in football.\n\nA few years passed and I was working with a guy who was a huge Red Sox fan. We used to go out and carouse together and a lot of times it was at a great Irish sports bar called C.C. O'Brien's. C.C.'s—as it is called by locals—is split right down the middle between Red Sox and Yankees.\n\nAs is many bars in New England.\n\nI spent a lot of time with this guy and he got me paying attention to the Sox again.\n\nIt was two years before the World Series win.\n\nI watched Pedro, Papi, Millar, Damon, Varitek and more. I was hooked. It was my dirty little secret.\n\nI couldn't tell anyone I liked the Red Sox. I felt like such a sell- out.\n\nMy Red Sox loving friend even asked me, \"If someone was to buy you a Red Sox hat would you wear it?\"\n\nI don't think I ever answered, because I still don't have one.\n\nI have watched and routed for the Sox ever since. I still feel dirty though.\n\nI have asked my sacred question to a few people here and there.\n\nIt is funny because if I ask a Yankees fan what they think about my saga they usually jump up and down and scream that I am a trader.\n\nWhen I ask a Red Sox fan, they usually say they are happy to have me.\n\nMy wife and her family are all Yankees fans and we don't talk about it.\n\nI don't know, I have spent most of my life a Red Sox fan I just feel like a loser because of those few weak years."
