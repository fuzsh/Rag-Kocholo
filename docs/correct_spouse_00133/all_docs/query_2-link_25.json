        "text": "Ah, the benefits of yoga. Not only does it help you gain flexibility and strength; it can help you handle a stressful job or deal with months on end with little sunshine. It can give you confidence to rethink your career or to sign up for a nine-week teacher training session in California.\n\nFor Karen and David Buckner, it can help you meet the love of your life.\n\n“I was sitting there on my yoga mat because I was painfully shy,” says David, 46. “Karen came up and said she’d heard I was from Texas and introduced herself.\n\n“It was like a lightning strike. We hit it off that day.”\n\n\"It was kind of like a lightning bolt strike. Yoga gods or angels — I definitely felt that click,\" Karen says.\n\nShe was living in Oregon at the time and, on the advice of her naturopathic doctor, had been taking Bikram yoga classes to help with seasonal depression.\n\n“It was cloudy and rainy and I was craving that heat and humidity,” says Karen, also 46. “I took that first class and fell in love with it. I was in sales and marketing for a health-content provider and feeling I was wanting to do something to be more of service. When the opportunity for teacher training came, I jumped at it.”\n\nDavid, meanwhile, was working as an attorney in Dallas. A former runner, he hadn’t had time to work out and had gained weight. Two friends suggested he try Bikram.\n\n“Pretty shortly thereafter, I felt great,” he says. “I lost 30 pounds that first month.”\n\nHe ended up quitting his job, buying a yoga studio and meeting Karen in California.\n\n“We felt very strongly about each other,” he says, “but we weren’t sure if it was real or because we were in this adult day camp. It’s a nine-week process. You’re in this bubble and it’s not really reality.”\n\nKaren returned home to Portland, David to Dallas. For the next five months, they carried on a long-distance relationship. Finally, Karen says, “We decided if we were going to make it work, we’d need to be in the same town. I decided it was time to go back to Texas.”\n\nThey got married about a year after they met, on June 6, 2004. Beginning a marriage and starting a business have plenty of stresses on their own. Doing both at once, “There were a lot of bumps in the road to get smoothed out. Without Karen, I wouldn’t be here and as successful as we’ve been.”\n\nThey alternate being at their two Bikram Yoga Dallas locations — one in Lakewood, the other in Uptown. “We’re not in the same cubicle all day long,” David says. “But we always have something to talk about over dinner.”\n\n“We complement each other as far as our energy,” Karen says. “We’re yin and yang. On the business side, I focus on sales and marketing. He’s great with legal, finance, facility-related stuff. We both have strengths in certain areas and that’s why we have a successful business and successful marriage.”\n\nThe success is twofold because they’re committed — to each other and to personal and professional growth.\n\n“It goes back to really focusing on self-care and focusing on what I can do to change me, instead of looking outside and blaming a stressful situation at work, or trying to find blame in something related to my partner, to my husband,” Karen says.\n\n“Any time you deal with a stressful situation, whether in marriage or a job, that’s usually the time people neglect themselves and that’s when we most need to take care of ourselves.”\n\nThey do that together with hiking and cross-country ski trips to Crested Butte, Colo.\n\n“It’s important for us to schedule downtime away from the studio to connect,” Karen says, “to do things in nature we enjoy.”\n\n“We both were married previously,” says David, who has three sons from an earlier marriage, with whom he and Karen enjoy spending time. “So we realize the importance of having things in common, activities we share.”\n\nSelf-care is imperative, too, they say. Karen may take solitary walks with their golden retrievers, schedule time with friends, practice meditation. David might go for a trail run or take weekend trips with friends.\n\n“We’ve had to grow individually so we can be stronger together,” David says. “I think we were very fortunate that we both have the same vision. It’s very important to have a strong partnership as a couple and be willing to be flexible and grow and evolve.”\n\nAh, another benefit of yoga: flexibility, in every sense of the word.\n\nNominate yourselves or another couple for True Romance; drop a note to lgarcia @dallasnews.com."
