Buckner and his family to Rusk County, Texas. In 1848, Garrett paid $3.81 in taxes on 320 acres, three horses and fifteen head of cattle. In 1853, he died.\n\nGarrett's eldest son, Moses M. Buckner (1829-1863), was executor of the will, which provided for the widow, Sarah Psalms McSpadden, and the eight children: Moses, Adeline, Catherine, James Green Clay, China Elizabeth, Robert, Mollie and Sarah.\n\nMoses had married Emeline Risinger December 2, 1852. Their children included Frank (1855), Mary Ann (1857), Sarah Theodosia (1859), Robert (1860), and Moses Marah (1862), who was called Mosie. Mosie never saw her father because she was born while he was stationed at Fort Hindman, Arkansas. His regiment (17th Texas Cavalry) was captured January 11, 1863, and he died as a POW March 12 at Camp Douglas, Illinois. His brother James was taken prisoner at the same time and also died.\n\nWhen Moses enlisted at Tyler, his mother presented him with a small Bible. Moses' cousin T. S. McSpadden, carried the Bible home to the widow. Inside it was her last letter to him, telling of the birth of a \"little black-haired girl.\" Emeline had even dipped the baby's foot in ink and marked a print on the letter.\n\nWith the loss of all the adult men in the family, the Buckners suffered considerably during Reconstruction. The youngest Buckner brother, Bob, who was twelve when the war began, remembered sharing a pair of shoes with his sister-in-law, Emeline. Bob was a small man and as a boy his foot was no larger than hers.\n\nEmeline and a sister-in-law, Cassie Buckner Risinger, whose husband (and Emeline's brother) was killed in the war, tried to make out a living on their adjoining homesteads. Cassie's elder daughter, Betty, later told a younger generation, \"We lived on this side and the Buckners lived on the other side of that drain.\"\n\nThings went from bad to worse, till at last Emeline's father drove a wagon up from Nacogdoches County and fetched his daughter and grandchildren back to live with him. Emeline remarried in Nacogdoches County. Cassie later moved her family to Ellis County. Her mother, Sarah McSpadden, moved to West Texas with a younger daughter and is buried in Parker County.\n\nBob married in Rusk County. His first wife died in childbirth and their daughter did not survive childhood. Bob's second wife was Jenny Swink. Their first years of married life were spent in the same house with her family at New Salem. Their children included Oscar, Robert, Kate Lewis, Dee Garrett, Sallie Wilson, Alvin, Will J. and Henry.\n\nAddle, who married William Wilson, was the mother of Stella Youngblood, Marion, Rob, Mollie Gambel and Horace.\n\n\"Rusk County History\", page 131.
