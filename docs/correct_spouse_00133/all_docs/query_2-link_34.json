Brian graduated from Crestwood High School and attended the University of SC, he was most recently employed at Kaydon as a CNC machinist.\n\nIn his youth Brian enjoyed playing baseball and as an adult strumming his guitar and listening to all varieties of music. He enjoyed, and was extraordinarily gifted at working on cars but Brian’s truest joy in life was spending time with his daughter Alyssa.\n\nBrian will best be remembered by all who knew and loved him as the person that was always there for those that needed him. He would give you the shirt off his back or the last dollar in his pocket and he never expected anything in return. He will be remembered as a very loving father, son, brother and friend and will be dearly missed by all who knew him. That genuinely warm and friendly smile that welcomed you or greeted you will never be forgotten.\n\nIn addition to his parents, he is survived by his daughter Alyssa Buckner of Sumter, his brother Michael Buckner and wife Sarah of Cayce, his very special niece Melinda Buckner of Mt. Olive, NC, his paternal grandfather David Buckner Sr., his maternal grandmother Virginia Cunningham, a step-brother Jonathan Sabastian (wife Ashley), two step-sisters Camille Knezevich (husband Chris) and Chellsye Monahan (husband Ehren) and many aunts, uncles, nieces, and nephews.\n\nThe family will receive friends on Monday, December 31, 2018 from 4:00-6:00 pm at Bullock Funeral Home.\n\nA memorial service will be held on Wednesday, January 2, 2018 at 1:00 pm in the Bullock Funeral Home Chapel. Interment will follow in the Evergreen Memorial Park Cemetary.\n\nIn lieu of flowers, donations may be made to St. Jude’s Children’s Hospital, 332 North Lauderdale, Memphis, TN 38105-2479\n\nYou may go to www.bullockfuneralhome.com and sign the family’s guest book.\n\nThe family has chosen Bullock Funeral Home for the arrangements"
