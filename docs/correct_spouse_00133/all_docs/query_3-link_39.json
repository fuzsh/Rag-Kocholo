        "text": "GOVERNOR’S FELLOWS\n\nThe Governor’s Fellows Program, initiated in 1982, offers talented young people firsthand experience in the processes of state government. Fellows are assigned to a member of the Governor’s Cabinet or personal staff. Modeled somewhat after the White House Fellows program, Virginia’s program encourages Fellows to consider a career in government or public service.\n\nApplicants must be rising or graduating seniors or enrolled as degree candidates in graduate or professional schools. Students enrolled in Virginia colleges or universities, public or private, may apply, regardless of state of residence. Virginia residents enrolled in out-of-state institutions, public or private, may also apply."
