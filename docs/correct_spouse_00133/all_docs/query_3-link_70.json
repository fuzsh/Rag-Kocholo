        "text": "Texans OC Bobby Slowik gushed about RB Joe Mixon in Saturday's press conference. \"He's a fun, fun person to coach,\" Slowik said with a big smile. \"From Day one, showed up and absolutely worked his tail off. I mean you could see right away in Phase two, and in OTAs, like I understand now why he was as good as he was in Cincinnati. He puts in an immense amount of work. He loves football. He does not stop wanting to learn, wanting to grow. ... Workhorse. He’s an absolute workhorse, in every regard. Not just as a ball carrier. He embraces protections. He embraces the other things he can do outside of carrying the ball, as an eligible [receiver], as a decoy.\"\n\nBills insider Vic Carucci believes TE Dalton Kincaid could emerge as the top option in the team's passing game this season. Carucci notes the progress that Kincaid made throughout his rookie season and writes that he's \"expected to take a giant leap\" in year two. \"I think the offense will be designed to get the ball in his hands as much as possible,\" Carucci adds.\n\nThe Seahawks placed LB Jerome Baker on the active/physically unable to perform list to begin training camp. Baker is still working back from the Week 18 right wrist injury that required surgery. He didn't do much in spring workouts with his new team either.\n\nJets WR Mike Williams (knee) has been placed on the active PUP list to open training camp. It's not a surprise as he works back from last September's torn ACL. Williams can be activated from the PUP list at any time and would be eligible to play Week 1. We're still expecting him to be out there for the season opener, although HC Robert Saleh suggested in June that Williams might play limited snaps early this season.\n\nGiants QB Daniel Jones (knee) is not expected to land on the PUP list to begin training camp, according to NFL Network's Ian Rapoport. Jones is working back from a right ACL tear suffered on November 5. He's on track to be ready for Week 1, barring a setback between now and then.\n\n49ers WR Brandon Aiyuk has requested a trade, NFL Network's Mike Garafolo reports. Aiyuk is entering the final year of his rookie contract and has been angling for an extension all offseason. A recent meeting between Aiyuk's camp and the 49ers produced no progress toward that extension, according to Garafolo. That prompted Aiyuk to make this trade request.\n\nThe Falcons' new coaching staff has big plans for TE Kyle Pitts this season. OC Zac Robinson said that Pitts is playing both TE and WR in his offense. “He’s learning basically two different positions,” Robinson said. “There’s some tight end and there’s some receiver. So, he’s got a lot on his plate. He’s handled it really well. I’m just excited to see him continue to get more comfortable in the system. The sky is the limit for what kind of season that he can have.\"\n\nThe Athletic's James Boyd highlighted WR Josh Downs as the Colts' 2024 breakout player. It's a noteworthy selection after Indianapolis added WR Adonai Mitchell with the 52nd overall pick of this spring's draft. Downs, though, was a Round 3 pick just a year ago. And Boyd noted that he and QB Anthony Richardson connected often this spring.\n\nThe Athletic’s Jourdan Rodrigue expects Rams TE Colby Parkinson to have a \"big role in this next iteration of [Sean] McVay's offense.” The 25-year-old spent his first four seasons in Seattle, totaling 57 catches, 618 yards, and 4 TDs. Back in March, he signed a three-year contract with a surprising $15.5 million guaranteed.\n\nThe Ravens have placed RB Keaton Mitchell on the physically unable to perform list for the start of training camp. It's no surprise, given that Mitchell is working back from a late December ACL tear. HC John Harbaugh said back in May that the team doesn't expect Mitchell back until \"sometime during the season.\""
