        "text": "David John Lewis Buckner (born on May 29, 1976) is a drummer, best known for his work for hard rock band Papa Roach from 1993 to 2008.\n\nBiography\n\nBorn in Los Angeles, California, he reluctantly moved to the northern California town of Vacaville at the age of 14. There, he formed the band with fellow bored high school students, and equally driven aspiring musicians, Jacoby Shaddix, Ben Luther and Will James in January 1993. After entering the school talent show later that month covering Jimi Hendrix's classic \"Fire\" (without a guitarist). Though they did not win, they knew something had to be done. After ousting Luther in favor of a new guitarist, Jerry Horton, hours of practicing, and a seven track EP \"Potatoes for Christmas\", Buckner left for Washington to attend the Art Institute of Seattle for a year. He soon returned to California as Papa Roach began to pick up momentum. The band recorded the 2 track sampler \"Caca Bonita\", and with Buckner back on drums, they all knew they had made great improvements. Buckner and the rest of the band continued practicing, recording and touring heavily until 1999 when they were signed to Dreamworks Records. Papa Roach's major label debut: Infest was released in April 2000, and went on to sell over 5 million copies worldwide. It became the launching point of Papa Roach's almost 10 year career, which continues strong today. Buckner has also played with other rock bands such as Rocket Transfer Warehouse.\n\nOn October 25, 2003 he married celebrated model/actress, Mia Tyler, Aerosmith's Steven Tyler's second daughter. Notably, the wedding was held onstage, in front of a completely surprised, yet laudatory, audience attending a sold out Aerosmith concert at the MGM Grand Arena in Las Vegas, Nevada. They filed for divorce in July 2005. They had no children together.\n\nA statement by Shaddix, on January 28th 2008, on their Facebook and Myspace [ [http://www.myspace.com/paparoach MySpace.com - Papa Roach - SACRAMENTO - Rock / Rock / Rock - www.myspace.com/paparoach ] ] pages says that Dave has now left the band, citing personal reasons. Although they are due to enter back into the Paramour mansion to continue writing for the next album Dave will no longer join them.\n\nEquipment\n\nZildjian Cymbals:\n\n* A = 16\" 16\" Medium Crash (top) and 16\" Medium Crash (bottom)\n\n* B = 20\" Oriental Crash of Doom (First)\n\n* C = 20\" 20\" Crash Ride\n\n* D = 20\" Ride\n\n* E = 22\" Heavy Ride\n\n* F = 20\" Oriental Crash of Doom (Second)\n\nPearl Drums:\n\n* 1 = 20\" x 24\" Bass Drum\n\n* 2 = 14\" x 6\" Snare *\n\n* 3 = 18\" x 16\" Floor Tom\n\n* 4 = DW 10\" x 3\" Piccolo Tom\n\n* 5 = 12\" x 9\" Tom\n\n* 6 = 14\" x 12\" Floor Tom\n\n* 7 = 16\" x 14\" Floor Tom"
