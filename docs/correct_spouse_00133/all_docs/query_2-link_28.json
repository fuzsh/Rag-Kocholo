        "text": "Doug always loved children. He was a camp counselor and involved in several children’s ministries. Over seven years after his unexpected death, his parents set out to turn their sadness into something useful and full of love.\n\nPatricia, her husband, David, and many family members have made a tradition of serving the children and families of Buckner in Beaumont, Texas. They consider it a mission, ministry and honor to be a part of the Buckner family.\n\n“It was the tragedy of life that helped our family realize the purpose of our lives is to glorify God and show his love,” Patricia said. “This is really all that matters.”\n\nThis year, Patricia and David, along with their children, grandchildren and church family served a meal to over 40 people. They enjoyed being involved in a new aspect of Buckner and getting to know and serve the families.\n\nThe family and friends have primarily served the children at the emergency care facility, but this year they decided to meet the need of another Buckner program, Project HOPES.\n\nThis program works to empower and educate families who have children under the age of five. Families meet monthly at their group connection meetings where they dine together, visit and participate in a learning activity or holiday celebration.\n\n“We love serving with our family because we have so much to be thankful for and so much love to give,” Patricia said.\n\nHow is the Lord working through your most trying circumstances?\n\nHe heals the brokenhearted and binds up their wounds –Psalm 147:3"
