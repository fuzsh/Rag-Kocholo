They lived there for 17 years before moving back to Missouri in 1971. She was a devoted wife, mother, grandmother, and great grandmother.\n\nMary Ann had enjoyed yard work, tending to her flowers and birds, knitting, reading, puzzles, her devotional readings, debates, and prayers.\n\nShe was preceded in death by her parents Dora (Enzmann) and Fritz Pueschel, her husband Charles, and 3 brothers-in-law, Bruce, Don and Larry Ellis, and sister-in-law Fran Pueschel.\n\nMary Ann is survived by her sons-Steve (Sherry), Ken (Letha), and Ted (Pam), all of Owensville: grandchildren-Ben (Tracy), Julie Buckner (Eric), Mitchell (Jeffrey), Cody (Claire), Anya Rusetskay (Anton), and great grandchildren-Levi, Caleb, Mia, Heidi, Ruby, David, Adam, and Evelyn.
