        "text": "Today I’m talk with Kirk Blaine of Native Fish Society all about the draft for the Rogue’s South Coast Multi-Species Conservation and Management Plan. We discuss how it got started back in 2018, data and monitoring issues in previous drafts, concerns with the current draft, the upcoming meeting on 15th, and how easy it will […]\n\nThe idea behind these Guide Gossip articles is to help you along your journey and allow you to understand your style and why you do what you do. Some anglers just fish a certain way because it feels good, or you have seen it before, maybe a guide told you to do so. This may help you expedite understanding of what fishing a “soft rod” means and or why you might choose to fish this way.\n\nThis week I got to sit down and talk with Bill Bakke and Dave Moskowitz. We had a really great talk about how Bill got started fishing, the need for a coast wide conservation voice, the impressive success of wild chinook on the Clackamas, the state of activism, the ecosystem of politics, so much more […]\n\nIt is now or never for wild steelhead. This year’s terrible run numbers should be ringing alarms bells, not a reason to argue for status quo fisheries and seasons. We must face reality: steelhead fishing in the Columbia and Snake Basin is in a desperate, fragile state. The fact is, in this unprecedented season, we don’t have enough fish to sustain the full fisheries of the past. Unprecedented numbers require unprecedented actions. We don’t have any time left and it is going to take all of us pounding on the desks of leaders and agencies to demand changes to restore steelhead numbers and allow for cautious fisheries when populations are high enough to sustain some impacts.\n\nice. Isolating yourself from these places is not the answer. Staying connected – as hard as it may be – is how to be a part of the solution.\n\nConrad Gowell is joining me this week and we had an excellent talk. We discussed DIY flys, the massive ecological effect of dams, woodcuts, snorkeling, the language of fishing culture, fish trap systems, and reasonable demands of Santa.\n\nBruce Kruk has some of the most technically pure spey casting you’ll ever see, which is why I asked him to film this video series.\n\nParticularly, on the single spey, Bruce’s methodology allows for remarkably consistent casting. Pay close attention to this one: the lift!\n\nThis week I’m joined by David Reid. We got to talking about his initial slow start to fishing, a love of surfing, grandparents, how he started rod building, tapers, bamboo, and a strange lack of ocean in Idaho.\n\nThis week I got the chance to speak with Peter Donahower and Tracy Buckner. We had a blast going over how they each started fishing, working in a hatchery, art and influences, the moral dilemma of steel heading, working for native fish society, hunting, and Valerie."
