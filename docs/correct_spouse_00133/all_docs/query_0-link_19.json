However, he did dabble in acting as a kid.\n\nAs reported by MTV, he was featured in a Christmas episode of Disney Channel's Lizzie McGuire along with his dad and sister Chelsea.\n\nAccording to his Facebook page, he tied the knot with Brittany Reardon in 2018.\n\nWhat has Steven Tyler said about his kids?\n\nIn January 2018, Steven spoke to PEOPLE about spending time with his kids during the holidays despite their busy schedules.\n\nThe New York native said: \"Right now, I'm still really busy. Liv is in England ‚Äî I went and saw her last year with the whole family. It's just a little hard.\n\n\"We try to get together for Christmas and it's fun, it's beautiful. What we got is beautiful.\"\n\nOn March 6, 2022, Steven paid tribute to Chelsea's birthday in an Instagram post.\n\nHe wrote: \"‚ù§Ô∏èüéÇ @chelsannat HAPPY BIRTHDAY TO THE BADDEST BABY GIRL PUP!!! I LOVE YOU CHELS‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è.\"\n\nOn May 9, 2021, he honored his daughters for Mother's Day.\n\nThe proud father and grandfather captioned the sweet family collage: \"MY PUPS... #HAPPYMOTHERSDAY ‚ù§Ô∏è.\"\n\nIs Steven Tyler married?\n\nThough he is not currently married, Steven has walked down the aisle twice.\n\nHe and Cyrinda wed in 1978 and went their separate ways in 1987.\n\nIn 1988, he tied the knot with Teresa, and the former couple stayed together until 2006.\n\nHe is now dating his former personal assistant Aimee Preston, who is 40 years his junior."
