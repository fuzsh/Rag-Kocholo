A marriage license for the couple was filed at the Clark County Recorder\\'s Office.Her father, Aerosmith frontman Steven Tyler, reportedly told the audience: \"Hey Vegas, I need a favor, my daughter wants to get married tonight. Can I get a witness?\"It\\'s the first marriage for both, according to People magazine\\'s Nov. 10 issue.<h3>Macaulay Culkin signs NBC deal</h3>Home Alone star Macaulay Culkin has signed a deal with NBC to develop several projects, including a possible comedy show in fall 2004, according to the trade paper Variety.Culkin, 23, has met with \"Late Night\" host Conan O\\'Brien and may also work on a project with him, NBC\\'s president of prime-time development, Kevin Reilly, was quoted Tuesday on Variety\\'s Web site.\"We\\'re going to use him in an unconventional way,\" Reilly said. \"I don\\'t think you\\'ll see Macaulay as a straight-down-the-middle romantic lead. I think you\\'ll see him in something surprising, a little offbeat.\"Reilly said Culkin has \"always had uncanny instincts\" as an actor, and a guest spot last season on NBC\\'s \"Will & Grace\" reinforced that point.Culkin recently starred as club kid Michael Alig in the independent film Party Monster, and will appear in the upcoming Saved opposite Jena Malone and Mandy Moore.<h3>Critic Cowell: \\'Britney\\'s all right\\'</h3>Simon Cowell says he appreciates Britney Spears\\' honesty, even if the 21-year-old pop star did take a dig at him.Spears recently had some advice for wannabe stars participating in the TV talent show \"Pop Idol,\" the British counterpart of \"American Idol.\" Both feature Cowell\\'s often withering assessments of the hopefuls\\' singing abilities.\"I would take his advice and whatever he said and tell him to shove it,\" Spears told Britain\\'s ITV television in an interview broadcast Monday.In response, Cowell told the TV show \"Extra\" in an interview that aired Thursday: \"I\\'ve got to be honest with you, the fact that she said that, I sort of like her more. It makes her more interesting. Britney is now a woman, not a girl. I like that.\"<h3>George Carlin\\'s new book</h3>Comedian George Carlin has agreed to terms for a new book, When Will Jesus Bring the Pork Chops?, an essay collection to be published next year by Hyperion.Financial terms weren\\'t disclosed.\"Here we go again, folks.
