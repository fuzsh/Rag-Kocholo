        "text": "Two days ago I was listening to the CNBC’s “Squawk on the Street,” when Jim Cramer claimed that there will be a revolution in the workplace; that #ChatGPT and #AI will be a wrecking ball to industry, that every non-revenue producer will be replaced. His comments got me thinking about AI and what is happening in the world today. I couldn't stop reading and thinking so I decided to write a Medium article to get it out of my head. These are the highlights: - On roughly the same day the world passed a global population of 8.0 billion the world was introduced to what looks to be the next generation of intelligence. - On November 30, 2022 OpenAI launched ChatGPT. This was not a product release. This is a seismic shift. We have entered a new era. - The new AI passed 1 million human interactions in 5 days. One month later, in the month of January 2023, over 100 million in people interacted with the AI. This means that within 2 months of its introduction to the world, over 1% of humanity engaged with it. - Two days ago, after NVIDIA’s CEO and founder, Jensen Huang reported their quarter results, Nvidia added $79 billion in market value. Even thought the earnings beat was small, his comments shocked the investment world. He said \"The culmination of technology breakthroughs has brought AI to an inflection point.\" - Similarly, Microsoft's CEO Satya Nadella recently said “the age of AI is upon us.” Nadella’s aggressive AI quote came from his Microsoft Q2 2023 earnings call. He shared that Microsoft has made a multi-billion dollar investment in ChatGPT. - By just asking ChatGPT directly, It shared that “by 2025, AI and automation could displace around 85 million jobs.” - We live in a world where the unemployment rate in the US inched lower to 3.4 percent in January 2023, the lowest level since May 1969, and “more than half of U.S. workers — 61% — are considering leaving their jobs in 2023.” Historically, new immigrants emerge into countries and fill the need in the labor market. Today, the new competing labor force looks to be AI. “There are decades where nothing happens; and there are weeks where decades happen.” ― Vladimir Ilyich Lenin I feel like humans really need to assess our place in the workforce and in this new world. And we need to be deliberate in how we enable this new technological revolution. Am I way off on this stuff? I feel that if we don't manage the morality and ethics of this, it could evolve in a non-beneficial way to us or it. BTW, if you haven't tried it, go to chat.openai.com and see why people are so enamored. #Innovation #Technology #Future #Careers #jobs"
