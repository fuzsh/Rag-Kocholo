        "text": "Saltburn filmmaker Emerald Fennell has set her next film as an adaption of the classic gothic novel Wuthering Heights.\n\nThe Emily Brontë book follows Heathcliff, an orphan-turned-foster-son who falls in love with the daughter of the family who owns the estate on which he now lives, Wuthering Heights. After running away, Heathcliff rises up through the ranks of the gentry and exacts revenge on the families — the Earnshaws and the Lintons — who kept him from his true love.\n\nThe Brontë novel was previously adapted for the screen in 1939 by William Wyler with Laurence Olivier starring as Heathcliff, again in 1992 by director Peter Kosminsky starring Ralph Fiennes and Juliette Binoche, and in 2011 by Andrea Arnold.\n\nFennell, whose onscreen work includes The Crown and Barbie, broke out as a filmmaker with her work on the series Killing Eve. She went on to win an Oscar for the screenplay of her first feature film Promising Young Woman, which she then followed with her sophomore feature Saltburn, starring Jacod Elordi and Barry Keoghan, for Amazon.\n\nShe is repped by UTA, the U.K.’s United and Management 360.\n\nFennell made the announcement of her new project on Twitter."
