        "text": "Today’s post was generously contributed by Sue Woodruff-Noland who got in touch with me several months ago to share some very interesting information on her Woodruff-related travels and Woodruff ancestors. We figured out that our common Woodruff ancestor is John “the Elder” Woodruff (b. 1637, m. Sarah Ogden), so we are cousins albeit very distant ones! I hope this blog’s readers, particularly those who are Woodruff descendants, will find Sue’s post of great interest. Please feel free to leave comments in the box below.\n\n************************************************************************\n\nThe days in Northern Michigan are still warm and steamy, but the rascally squirrels are busy hiding acorns, so I think I need to gather “acorns of wisdom” and share them with the generations of John “The Immigrant” Woodruff (1604, Fordwich, Kent, England), whose descendants are abundant.\n\nLikely you all know the lineage from John and where your lines diverge. From the Bentley Historical Library at the University of Michigan, my son, Andrew (the family genealogist) and I have further records provided by a descendant named Charles M. Woodruff (1851-1932) that pre-date John “The Immigrant.” Charles states, “The facts are attested by documentary and historical records; wills, marriage licenses, church rolls, etc. The generations from our progenitor, John Gosmer, gentleman, Mayor of Fordwich, England, 1638 are eleven generations.”\n\nFrom Charles’ genealogy:\n\n1503, Thomas Woodruff (1), Fordwich, Eng., a jurat, and “trusted envoy of ye town.” Died 1552.\n\nWilliam Woodroffe (2), son of Thomas, senior jurat, “key keeper of town chest, a very honorable office conferred upon the two best men of the liberty;” died 1587.\n\nRobert Woodroffe, married Alice Russell at St. Mary Northgate, antiguous to Fordwich, 1573; he and his brother William figure in town books as freemen; William’s line became extinct in 1673; Robert is recorded as jurat and church warden in 1584, died in 1611.\n\nCharles then records John (5), John (6), and John (6)A. Our common ancestor is John (5), baptized at St. Mary Northgate in 1604. Hopefully you have been able to follow…vaguely?… along thus far. Genealogy is not my strong suit; telling stories is. And here is our story.\n\nIn early October 2014 I called Andrew and asked if he would like to go to Ireland to explore our ancestral homeland, Co. Mayo. Of course, he jumped at the opportunity; he also asked to add on a week in England to explore ancestral areas there, and a two-week trip became three. (Son, Neil, living and working in China, was unable to arrange so much time off work to join us.)\n\nAbout 10 years ago, Andrew serendipitously acquired the 1597 Geneva Bible belonging to the Woodruff family. Woodruff cousins paid for a specially made box to preserve the remains of the Bible (at least the first five books of the Bible are worn away, i.e., g-o-n-e), though happily and thankfully the center pages remain intact. I bought Andrew a new, sturdy backpack and on 9 May 2015 the Woodruff Family Bible began its ancestral journey back home to Fordwich, Kent, England.\n\nWe arrived in London 10 May and did a very cursory tour of London, leaving Tuesday, 12 May for Canterbury, arriving around 10 a.m. After taking luggage from the rear seat and the ‘boot’ to our assigned room, we set out for our ancestral village, Fordwich, about four miles northeast of Canterbury. Fordwich is Britain’s smallest town and first recorded as an inhabited place in 675 A. D. I’m not sure if we saw the entire tiny village or not. We walked along sun-dappled lanes, past both a large, modern home and also quaint, sweet little cottages (note the 1650 designation on the cottage pictured here!)\n\nAnd then, there it was: our ancestor’s church, the Church of St. Mary the Virgin (St. Mary’s Church.)\n\nThe church dates from around 1100, in Norman times. Andrew (I gained several rear shots in 3 weeks!) and I approached the church’s entry along a path through a tree shaded cemetery with assorted tombstones, many of indeterminate (old) dates. St. Mary’s closed in 1995, passing, at that time, into The Churches Conservation Trust—and for this we are very grateful on this fine Tuesday in May 2015.\n\nWe entered the church in awe, to think that our ancestors worshiped here, may have been ‘baptized, married, and buried’ from here more than 400 years before. Not surprisingly, we had the church to ourselves and took our time exploring the nave and North aisle (added in the late 12th century.) The tower was inaccessible and the chancel was blocked by the altar rails, which date from the 1600s and comprise thickly set balusters to stop dogs from defiling the Holy Table. Nearby was a lectern and that is where Andrew carefully placed our Family Bible.\n\nThere is a benefactions plaque upon the wall in the narthex that lists a Daniel Woodruff, but this name needs to be researched to determine if he is of our line—apparently there were a great many Woodruffs in Fordwich 400 years ago. Later, while touring Canterbury Cathedral, we spoke with a volunteer, perhaps in her 70s, who has lived in Fordwich all her life and she was not aware of any Woodruff family any longer residing in the area.\n\nAndrew and I didn’t talk much as we made our way around inside the church, each of us engrossed in our own thoughts. Like church mice, first here, then there, into the vestry, out of the vestry, and back for another look at the old organ. I imagined someone playing A Mighty Fortress is Our God in the 1600s, if the congregation was wealthy enough to have an organ then?\n\nThe Chapel of St. Catherine, in the eastern section of the North aisle, was converted at some point in the church’s history. The church organ is accessed here in the vestry and was rebuilt in 1889; it came from St. Martin’s Church, Canterbury, in 1908.\n\nThe Fordwich Parish Registers box was tucked in a corner of the NE side of the nave. Such boxes would have contained baptism, marriage, and burial records. Where the records from this box may be stored is unknown (no docent is on site to answer questions.) It is a lifetime endeavor for us to uncover any records and our family’s history!\n\nThough we don’t have the records that may have been stored in the Registers box, I can clarify for you what the entry in our Family Bible reads (rather confusingly, to me):\n\nThe Age of Benjamin Woodruff. He was born November the 26 Anno: 1744. Being the only one of my grandfather’s family that is now liveing [sic] this March the 23 day Anno 1785. Benjamin Woodruff was born November 26 A 1744 and died 18 October 1837. Benjamin Woodruff’s property June 2d A 1805 (?) Benjamin Woodruff’s property Joanna D (?) 1805 Nov. 5 died July (?) Joanna Benjamin died July 28, 1812.\n\nThe Benjamin who died in 1837 is our Revolutionary War soldier, about whom I will write a separate story for you. I am not aware of any Benjamin who died in 1812, whether I am misreading it, or if the person who wrote it misspoke. There are multiple Johns and Benjamins in the family, too many for my muddled mind!\n\nI have about 30 photos taken in Fordwich, mostly inside the church, but about a quarter of them of the outside grounds. If you ever have the opportunity to visit Fordwich, I think you, too, will be humbled by the history of the settlement of this once important maritime port city on the River Stour where our ancestors once lived…and where, to this day, the Cinque Ports Confederation, an annual Civic service, is still attended by dignitaries from other Cinque Ports, held in our ancestral church.\n\nIn July 2016, the Woodruff family Bible was donated to the Bentley Historical Library at the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor, where two or three boxes of Woodruff documents dating back to the 1840s are stored. All items are available for Woodruff researchers and contain fascinating reading."
