        "text": "The small and welcoming church of St Mary’s in Fordwich is just 3 miles from Canterbury and has been offering rest to weary pilgrims for centuries, sitting on the ancient Way of St Augustine. Slap-bang on the River Great Stour, the truly teeny-tiny town of Fordwich still has the feel of a quaint town of centuries past, with its totally titchy Town Hall, virtually untouched since it was built in 1544. You can hire a canoe or paddleboard, or make like a true pilgrim and avail yourself of the victuals and ale provided by England’s smallest town’s two pubs – The George & Dragon and the award winning The Fordwich Arms.\n\nThe church itself is mellow and unspoilt, with seventeenth-century fittings and wall paintings. It is home to a strange carved stone, dating from around 1100. Nearly 1.7 metres long, the Fordwich Stone is thought to be a shrine made for the body parts – or relics – of a saint, maybe St Augustine of Canterbury.\n\n4 sets of bedding are available to hire, please request at time of booking or get in touch to add it on later.\n\nFor more information about this church and the work of the CCT, click here.\n\nCanterbury Cathedral – Witness to the murder of Thomas Becket in 1170 and the home to some of the world’s oldest stained glass, Canterbury Cathedral holds a place of vital importance in the history and religion of England (3.2 miles away).
