        "text": "After 96 years, the Fordwich United Church has closed following its final service.\n\nThe church saw much changes over its years which was vastly known for its large Sunday service and Vacation Bible School dropped off in membership.\n\nOfficials with the church saying a large percentage of the church started retiring and moving away from the community.\n\nMany however did still return for service. In 2018 with the retirement of the recent minister, the Fordwich United Church decided it would share ministry with the Palmerston and Moorefield United Churches, but in 2020 all three churches were without a minister.\n\nDuring the search, the pandemic arrived and ultimately a decision was made to disband and sell the church building with the final service held on September 19th this year."
