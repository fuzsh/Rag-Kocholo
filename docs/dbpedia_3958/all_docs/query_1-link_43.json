        "text": "Fordwich comes from the Old English âfordâ meaning a âfordâ with âwicâ as a âdwelling, building or group of buildings for specific purposes or industrial settlementâ; therefore, a âtrading centre at the fordâ. The Domesday Book records Fordwich as Forewic.\n\nThe now redundant church at Fordwich is a Grade: I listed building, dedicated to Saint Mary the Virgin. The monks of St Augustineâs Abbey, Canterbury built it around 1070. They added the north aisle late in the 12th century. Early in the 13th century, they extended the chancel and added the tower later that century, with windows inserted in the nave south wall and the north aisle, within 50 years. Joseph Hatch cast and hung a bell in 1624, adding three more nine years later. The church benefited from a plaster tympanum added to the chancel arch in the 16th Century, and, in 1688 inscribed, with the Ten Commandments and the Royal Arms of King William. In 1800, Edward Hasted describes the Fordwich church as consisting of âtwo isles and a chancel, having a tall spire steeple at the west end, in which are four bells. It is situated so close to the river, and so much on a level with it, that it is sometimes overflowed, and always exceedingly wet and damp. There seems to have been some good painted glass in the windows, of which there are but few remainsâ. The Victorians installed a small Holman organ in 1887.\n\nIn 1973, the Rector, Reverend Owen Brandon retired, and due to a general lack of men and money, and the small population, St Maryâs came under the care of the Vicar of Sturry, the Reverend Peter Gausden, who had also taken over the Parish of Westbere with Hersden some two years earlier. In May 1974, Her Majesty in Council created by order, the United Benefice and Parish of Sturry with Fordwich and Westbere. In the following years, maintenance of the ancient church proved an extremely heavy burden on parish finances, and despite considerable fund-raising efforts by the Fordwich community, the building passed into the care of the Churches Conservation Trust. The Trust took over in 1996 and the following year carried out extensive repairs, particularly to the chancel windowsâ¦. more\n\nAlthough the River Stour reaches Canterbury until the 1800âs it could be navigated only as far as Fordwich, which became the cityâs port of, very important as water was the only practical means of transporting goods at the time.\n\nThe Domesday Book describes Fordwich as a 'Small Burgh', one of only seven boroughs in Kent. It became self-governing from the 11th Century and received a Merchant Guild Charter from Henry II in 1184. They elected the Mayor in the Church together with twelve Jurats and other officers, on the first Monday after the Feast of St. Andrew. Should he refuse the office when elected the Mayor would be fined or else had his house pulled down to the ground by the populace. The first known Mayor is John Maynard in 1292. Fordwich remained incorporated until 1886, when the Town property passed into the hands of a body of Trustees.\n\nFordwich became a corporate limb of the Cinque Port of Sandwich in about 1050, before the Norman Conquest, and as such helped to provide ships and men to fight for the Crown as required. In return, the Town received self-government and freed from many national taxes. Later the Head Port of Sandwich changed the provision of ships to the payment of money.\n\nThe Town owned the Quay and the Crane and derived income from duty on imported goods and the hiring of the crane. The stone for Canterbury Cathedral, from Caen in France, unloaded there, together with all the goods required by the thriving monastic city. The port lost its importance due to the River Stour becoming silted up. With the introduction of a railway, in 1830, linking Canterbury and Whitstable harbour, Fordwich finally ceased to be a port. When the River became narrower, the town built a bridge and derived income from the tolls."
