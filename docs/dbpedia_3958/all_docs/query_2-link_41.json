Name and\n\ntown or village County and\n\ncoordinates Photograph Date Notes Grade Botolphs St Botolph\n\nBotolphs West Sussex\n\n0850 Anglo-Saxon The nave and chancel are Saxon, and the south doorway dates from the 17th century. A north aisle was added in about 1250, but this was demolished in the early 19th century. Around the chancel arch are traces of medieval wall paintings. a I West Stourmouth All Saints\n\nWest Stourmouth Kent\n\n0850 Anglo-Saxon The oldest fabric in the church is Anglo-Saxon. The church was altered in the 12th century, but following earthquake damage in 1382 it was rebuilt. Windows were replaced in the 14th and 15th centuries, and the church was restored in 1845. It has been redundant since 1979. The base of a rood screen is still present inside the church. a I Albury St Peter and St Paul (old)\n\nAlbury Surrey\n\n1050 11th century The nave may date from the Anglo-Saxon era, and the lower part of the tower contains pre-Conquest masonry. The nave was extended in the 12th century, the chancel and south transept were added in the 13th century, followed by the south aisle in the following century. During the 19th century the Albury Park estate, in which the church stands, was owned by the banker Henry Drummond. He replaced the spire on the tower with a cupola, and commissioned A. W. N. Pugin to convert the south transept into a mortuary chapel. a I East Shefford St Thomas\n\nEast Shefford Berkshire\n\n1050 11th century Norman features in the church include a north window, the font, and a piscina. Also in the church is the alabaster tomb of Sir Thomas Fettiplace, who died in 1447, and his wife, Lady Beatrice, who was a member of the Portuguese royal family. On the walls above the chancel arch are 12th-century paintings and painted texts. Worship ceased in the church in 1870, and its congregation transferred to a new church nearby. a I Higham St Mary\n\nHigham Kent\n\n1050 11th century The church is constructed in flint and ragstone, the flint arranged to give the appearance of horizontal stripes. The south aisle is almost as wide as the nave, and it is thought that this was added in the 14th century by a nunnery sited nearby at that time. The font is Norman, and between the nave and the Lady chapel is a 15th-century rood screen. a I Little Somborne All Saints\n\nLittle Somborne Hampshire\n\n1050 11th century All Saints has a simple plan, consisting of a nave and a chancel in a single range. The church incorporates an Anglo-Saxon pilaster strip and a Norman round-headed doorway. In the churchyard is the grave of Thomas Sopwith, the pioneer aviator. b II* North Stoke St Mary the Virgin\n\nNorth Stoke West Sussex\n\n1050 11th century The ancient dedication of the church to Saint Mary the Virgin was rediscovered in 2007 by two amateur archaeologists. The church has a cruciform plan with a nave, chancel and two transepts. It contains windows in six different architectural styles. The oldest fitting is a 13th-century font. a I Sandwich St Mary\n\nSandwich Kent\n\n1050 11th century St Mary's has suffered from repeated damage: by the French in 1217 and again in 1457, and from an earthquake in 1578. In 1667 the central tower collapsed, and was rebuilt. In the 19th century the church was restored by Joseph Clarke. Since being made redundant it has been used as an arts centre. a I Shirburn All Saints\n\nShirburn Oxfordshire\n\n1100 11th–12th century All Saints stands immediately to the south of Shirburn Castle, the seat of the Earls of Macclesfield. Its north chapel is the mausoleum of the Macclesfield family. The church was restored and largely rebuilt in 1876 by T. H. Wyatt. c II Ashley St Mary\n\nAshley Hampshire\n\n1125 Early 12th century The chancel was added later in the 12th century, and the windows date from the 15th and 16th centuries. The church was restored twice in the 19th century. Inside the church is a Norman font. There is a painting of a saint in the splay of one of the windows. b II* Paddlesworth St Benedict\n\nPaddlesworth Kent\n\n1125 Early 12th century This simple church stands on the Pilgrims' Way. It closed as a church in 1678 and was then used for some 250 years for non-religious purposes, including use as a farm building. A gallery was added in the 19th century, and the church was restored twice during the 20th century. b II* Burham St Mary\n\nBurham Kent\n\n1150 12th century Standing on the Pilgrims' Way, this church served a now-deserted village. Its north and south aisles have been demolished. Inside the church are two Norman fonts. a I Capel-le-Ferne St Mary\n\nCapel-le-Ferne Kent\n\n1150 12th century St Mary's stands in an isolated position. A stone chancel arch was added in the 14th century containing a three-bay arcade. Above the arcade is a large round-headed opening that silhouetted the rood cross, a feature unique in England. The church also contains a memorial to General Sir Charles William Dunbar Staveley, who died in 1896. a I Catmore St Margaret\n\nCatmore Berkshire\n\n1150 12th century The Norman features in this church include two doorways and the font. The nave roof dates from 1607. During the 19th century the church was restored and Norman Revival features were added, which were more ornate than the original Norman features. a I Cheam Lumley Chapel\n\nCheam Greater London\n\n1150 12th century The chapel consists of the east end of the chancel of a former church that had been converted into a memorial chapel for the Lumley family of nearby Nonsuch Palace. It contains memorials to the Lumleys and to other families. The chapel is the oldest standing building in the London Borough of Sutton. b II* Colemore St Peter ad Vincula\n\nColemore Hampshire\n\n1150 12th century The plan of this church was formerly cruciform, but in 1669 the parishioners considered that the interior was too dark, and they successfully petitioned the bishop for the south transept to be removed. The remaining north transept has a 12th-century doorway in its west wall, a 12th-century window in the north wall, and an 11th-century window in the east wall. Inside the church are a 12th-century font made from Purbeck Marble and a 16th-century wooden screen. b II* East Peckham St Michael\n\nEast Peckham Kent\n\n1150 12th century St Michael's expanded to its present size in about 1300, and it was restored in the 19th century by Joseph Clarke. It contains one Norman window. Elsewhere there are Perpendicular-style windows that were renewed during the restoration. b II* Fleet Marston St Mary\n\nFleet Marston Buckinghamshire\n\n1150 12th century Set in an isolated position surrounded by fields, the church was restored by George Gilbert Scott in 1868. John Wesley preached a sermon here soon after his ordination in 1725. The fittings of the church include a Norman font. b II* Fordwich St Mary the Virgin\n\nFordwich Kent\n\n1150 12th century Dating mainly from the Norman era, the church incorporates some Saxon material in the nave. Inside the church are box pews, and a civic pew containing a stand to hold the mayor's mace. Also in the church is the Fordwich stone, dating from about 1100 and considered to be part of the former shrine of a saint. a I Goodnestone St Bartholomew\n\nGoodnestone Kent\n\n1150 12th century The plan of this flint church is simple, consisting of a nave with a north porch, and a chancel. The porch was rebuilt in 1837 after it had been damaged by an earth tremor. The stained glass in the east window is by Thomas Willement. a I Luddenham St Mary\n\nLuddenham Kent\n\n1150 12th century This flint church stands in a farmyard, and its structure incorporates some re-used Roman tiles. The west door is Norman, and is decorated with zigzags. Inside the church is a 13th-century coffin lid carved with hands holding a heart. a I Mongewell St John the Baptist\n\nMongewell Oxfordshire\n\n1150 12th century Partly ruined, the church stands to the north of Mongewell Park, near The Ridgeway long-distance path. It was remodelled in picturesque Gothic style in the late 18th century for Rev Shute Barrington, Bishop of Durham. The structure consists of a roofless nave, a roofed chancel, and a west tower. c II Newnham Murren St Mary\n\nNewnham Murren Oxfordshire\n\n1150 12th century St Mary's is at the end of a farm track, overlooking the River Thames.
