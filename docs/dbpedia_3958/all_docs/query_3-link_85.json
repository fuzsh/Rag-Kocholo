        "text": "Despite over 20 yearsâ€™ work on the archive, these scans have still not been individually checked and may prove to be damaged, faded, or not of sufficient quality to ever be offered in our full product range. However, if you would particularly like to buy one of these please get in touch quoting the Frith negative number,(s) the town name and size of print you would like to buy. On receipt of your enquiry our archivist will check the scan and advise you if the quality is good enough.\n\nAn album is a way to save a selection of Frith photos, maps and memories that are of interest to you.\n\nCreating an Album enables you to make short lists and then make a final selection from the album. In particular it makes ordering things like calendars much easier - simply create an Album of the 12 photos you like and then use the Album when placng your order - our order process will give you this option.\n\nYou can create as many Albums as you want, so perhaps make one for your hometown, where you live now, where your parents live now etc."
