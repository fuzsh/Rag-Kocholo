        "text": "Hi Jim,\n\nI've been reading the messages about Fordwich with interest.I hope to get there someday. I gather that, since you did not know that John Gosmer had been Mayor of Fordwich, that you have not read Ceylon Woodruff's two volumes, \"Woodruff Chronicles.\"These really are valuable references and I highly recommend them, especially to anyone just starting out.Although I do not think CNW was without error (what genealogy doesn't have some of those), he does provide Woodruff lines that had never been published before.He also offers the list of previously published references which are the basis for all of our Woodruff background, and who among us really wants to reinvent the wheel.\n\nI'm not sure what history of Fordwich you found, perhaps a new one, but the standard reference is \"History of the Town and Port of Fordwich\" published by Rev. C. Eveleigh Woodruff, M.A. in 1895.He also worte \"Archaeologia Cantiana\" on the early family in England and \"Memorials of the Family of Woodruff\", 1899.Then there are the volumes by Francis Eben Woodruff, A.B., Yale, 1864, \"Branch of the Woodruff Stock\", 1902, and \"Woodruffs of New Jersey\", 1909.You might add to this list Howell's \"The Early History of Southampton\" 1887, and Hatfield's \"History of Elizabeth, New Jersey\" 1868 for starters.\n\nNow as to the parishes where our Woodruffs are registered in England, I am a bit confused myself.CNW says \"the parishes of Fordwich, Saint Mary Northgate and Sturry, in Kent, England, are contiguous.\"I interpret this to mean \"related\" since they couldn't be physically touching.Fordwich is recorded in the Domesday Book as a small borough and it is about 2 miles from the city of Canterbury where the parish of St. Mary Northgate is located.This is the parish where Robert Woodroffe's marriage to Alice Russell is recorded for 1573.John Woodruffe 1574-1611 was apparently a member of this parish also, as was John Gosmer. He probably married Eliz. Cartwright there in 1601.According to CNW, 'the Canterbury Marriage Licenses, 1568-1618, p. 181, record that on October 24, 1611, a marriage license was issued to \"Gosmer, John of St. Mary Northgate, Canterbury, joiner, and Elizabeth Woodruffe of same parish, widow.Marriage to be held in St. Mary Bredin parish, Canterbury.\"' John Gosmer was witness to John Woodruffe's will there (Canterbury and St. Mary Northgate Wills). John Woodruffe, the Immigrant, was baptized in 1604 in St. Mary Northgate, Canterbury also.However, he was recorded as a churchwarden in Fordwich in 1636 and probably married Ann there (date?).Their son John was baptized in 1637 in the adjoining parish of Sturry, Kent, England. CNW does indicate, though, that the Church of St. Mary the Virgin at Fordwich, Kent, England is \"a burial ground for Woodruff ancestors\" and he has a picture of this pre-Norman church in his Vol. I.I would be very interested to see your modern day pictures.\n\nI also would be very interested in hearing about any changes to this data and learning more about the relationship between these parishes in England.As I corresponded with C.N. Woodruff thirty years ago, much as many of you are sharing on the Internet today, and actually met the man when I moved to CA, I do feel he was a very competent researcher.However, it is a brave new world and this Internet tool is making faster connections and actual source data available easily for all of us.I think great things are going to come from it, and the new researchers, the younger of you, are going to bring it about. Keep up the good work!Gail"
