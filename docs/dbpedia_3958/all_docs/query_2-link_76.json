        "text": "ST MARY THE VIRGIN, KENT\n\nThis diminutive church sits on the banks of the River Stour and has a homely tilt due to flood damage in the 1600s. It has remnants of its long history stretching back to its Norman and Saxon days, and it’s rumoured Shakespeare may have performed here with his troupe, the King’s Men.\n\nAddress: St Mary The Virgin, The Parish Church of Hayes, Hayes Street, Hayes, Kent, BR2 7LH\n\nTelephone: +44 20 8462 1373\n\nWebsite: stmaryshayeskent.co.uk\n\nALL SAINTS, NORTHAMPTONSHIRE\n\nFor poetry enthusiasts, All Saints, in Aldwincle, offers the chance to spend a night in the church where John Dryden was baptised in 1631. There’s also the prospect of a rather good hot breakfast delivered by a local farmer direct to the church door.\n\nAddress: All Saints' Church, George Row, Northampton, NN1 1DF\n\nTelephone: +44 1604 632845\n\nWebsite: allsaintsnorthampton.co.uk\n\nDo\n\n\\1. Bring your own sleeping bag and pillow; these can also be provided at an extra cost of £25 per person.\n\n\\2. Consider packing some extra layers, as these ancient buildings don’t come with central heating for cool nights.\n\n\\3. Drinking is permitted at champing sites, so do bring supplies of your preferred tipple.\n\n\\4. You can also invite friends with kids and dogs – children of all ages and up to two four-legged champers are permitted.\n\nDon’t\n\n\\1. Avoid bringing a camping stove, and don't expect to heat or cook food within the church, as this isn’t allowed.\n\n\\2. Leave wax candles at home – you can bring a torch instead or use the battery-operated candles provided.\n\n\\3. And don’t worry about breakfast: it will be either provided at a local venue or delivered to the door.\n\nThe Champing season runs from March to September. Accommodation costs from £49 per adult per night for groups of up to 12, and includes use of camp beds, lamps, tea and coffee facilities, and a compost WC.
