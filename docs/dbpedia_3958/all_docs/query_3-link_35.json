We did use the hot water bottles which were provided.\n\nIt’s a beautiful old church that feels far away from everything but there’s a pub near next door (I’m told it’s a bit expensive) and one just down the road. Mark’s and Spencer Food and McDonald’s is a four minute drive away. Sturry station is a 10 to 15 minute walk away. There are some beautiful walks along the Stour Valley. One other thing – the camp beds, which are surprisingly comfortable, can be tricky to get in to if you have mobility issues. I had to have mine moved into the aisle. It was a beautiful relaxing stay."
