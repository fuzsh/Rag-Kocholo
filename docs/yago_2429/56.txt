Emma Thompson says the end of her marriage to husband Kenneth Branagh was just as shocking to her as it was to the public. The actress, who is profiled in the latest issue of The New Yorker, told the magazine she was oblivious to Branagh’s infidelity on movie sets, which led to their split in 1995.

Thompson and Branagh wed in 1989 after meeting on 1987’s Fortunes of War, and later costarred in 1991’s Dead Again, which was directed by Branagh. While the power couple presented a united front to the press and public as they teamed up to make six movies together, their relationship ended after Branagh cheated on Thompson while making Mary Shelley’s Frankenstein.

Branagh, who directed the film, struck up an affair with actress Helena Bonham Carter and went on to date her for five years.

Thompson told The New Yorker she was caught off-guard by Branagh and Bonham Carter’s on-set romance, telling the outlet, “I was utterly, utterly blind to the fact that he had relationships with other women on set. What I learned was how easy it is to be blinded by your own desire to deceive yourself.”

After her split from Branagh, Thompson said she was “half alive,” adding, “Any sense of being a lovable or worthy person had gone completely.” But when she met and fell in love with actor Greg Wise, Thompson said he “picked up the pieces and put them back together.”
