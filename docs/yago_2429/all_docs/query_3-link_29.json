        "text": "Kenneth Branagh is one of Northern Ireland's most successful actors, with three BAFTAs and two Emmy Awards to his name.\n\nThe Belfast native has acted in and directed several adaptations of plays by William Shakespeare, including Hamlet and Much Ado About Nothing.\n\nHe's also starred in the TV show Wallander, but most people probably know him best from his portrayal of Professor Gilderoy Lockhart in the movie Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets.\n\nOff-screen, he has been married to film art director Lindsay Brunnock since 2003.\n\nThey tied the knot after dating for two years, in a relatively low key ceremony.\n\nThe couple don't have kids, as he said \"it just never happened\".\n\nBefore Lindsay, Kenneth was married to actress Emma Thompson.\n\nThey starred together in Fortunes of War, Look Back in Anger, Henry V, Much Ado About Nothing, Dead Again, and Peter's Friends. More recently, they both appeared in The Boat That Rocked, and the Harry Potter series, but they didn't share any scenes in either.\n\nHowever their six-year union ended in 1995 when he had an affair with Helena Bonham Carter, during filming of the movie Frankenstein.\n\nHe was with Helena for four years, in a well-publicised relationship, and it was actually she who introduced him to Lindsay in 1997.\n\nKenneth and Lindsay met again in 2001 on the set of Channel 4 show Shackleton, in which he played explorer Ernest Shackleton.\n\nHe has described his wife as smarter than him, and said she knows him better than he knows himself."
