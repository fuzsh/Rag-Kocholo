I'm going to give up acting for the foreseeable future and we're going to try for another child.\"\n\nShe said that her partner had helped her to come to terms with the pain of the miscarriage.\n\n\"I'm blessed to have Greg as my lover and to be with him. We've been together for nearly three years now and I really do think my recovery has been swifter because of him,\" she said.\n\nThe actress, who has won Oscars for her Sense And Sensibility script and for her performance in Howard's End, stars in Primary Colors alongside John Travolta."
