        "text": "Her extended family of actors, artists & her kids: âWeâre terrible gossips, but âgossipâ in the sense that Phyllis Rose described it, the first step on the ladder to self-knowledge. Gossip is discussion about lifeâs detail. And in lifeâs details are all the little bits of stitching that you need to hold it to-f–king-gether.â\n\nHer fatherâs death: âThatâs when I thought, Everything is upside down.â Ericâs death, in 1982, when Thompson was twenty-three, was a âcataclysmic loss,â she said, adding, âHe left no money. We all had to earn our livings from then on.â\n\nFalling for Kenneth Branagh: They met while filming âFortunes of War.â Thompson remembers the moment on the set of âFortunesâ when she first fell for him. On a break between takes during a night shoot, Branagh tried to amuse her by singing in his slightly falsetto voice. âI burst into tears because he sounded exactly like my father singing on âThe Magic Roundabout,â â she said. Branagh was reminiscent of Eric Thompson in other ways, too. He created the same seclusive climate around himself, wore a carapace of privacy, which Thompson compared to a walnut: âhard to pry open.â âHe was incandescent with ambition and performance energyâ¦ Like two mating lobsters, we clashed claws,â Thompson said of their volatile two-year courtship.\n\nMarrying Branagh in 1989: âI was embarrassed largely by the press version of our marriage. We didnât present as glamorous in any way. I donât think we wanted to be some power couple, and we certainly didnât feel like it. We were lampooned and ridiculed, tooâfair enough if youâre famous and overpaidâbut itâs no fun.â\n\nThe sobbing scene in Sense & Sensibility: âShe was not aware of what was inside her, and it suddenly emerges,â Thompson explained. Edward haltingly admits that âmy heart is and always will be yours.â She holds up her hand, stopping him in mid-romantic flow. Words can wait; in the moment, she is crying tears of anger and joy. Thompsonâs emotional explosion is at once a great piece of acting and a great piece of comedy. (âI was trying to make it as involuntary as possible. A case of the diaphragm taking over,â she wrote in her diary.) âHugh Grant was so cross,â Thompson recalled. âHe said, âYouâre gonna cry all the way through my speech?â I said, âHugh, Iâve got to. Thatâs the gag. Itâs funny.â And he says, âYeah, but Iâm speaking.â I said, âI know.â â\n\nBranaghâs affair: Offscreen, in 1995, while the film was being shot, Thompson had to exert a steely control over her own pain. Her marriage to Branagh had collapsed, but they had not gone public with the news. Branagh had started a relationship with one of the stars of his film âMary Shelleyâs Frankenstein,â Helena Bonham Carter. Thompson was humiliated, in part by her own stupidity. âI was utterly, utterly blind to the fact that he had relationships with other women on set,â she said. âWhat I learned was how easy it is to be blinded by your own desire to deceive yourself.â\n\nFalling for Greg Wise: âI was half alive. Any sense of being a lovable or worthy person had gone completely,â she said. The person âwho picked up the pieces and put them back togetherâ was the actor Greg Wise, who played John Willoughby, the doe-eyed heartthrob who sweeps Marianne Dashwood (Kate Winslet) off her feet in âSense and Sensibility.â (âFull of beans and looking gorgeous. Ruffled our feathers a bit,â Thompson noted of Wise in her production diary.) Thompson has now been with Wise for twenty-seven years, married for nineteen. âIâve learned more from my second marriage just by being married,â she said. âAs my mother says, âthe first twenty years are the hardest.â â"
