        "text": "[quote]Incidentally, a role Meryl passed over first.\n\nThat’s not true. The first and ONLY offer on SMB went to Thompson. They had Tom Hanks for box office clout.\n\nThompson should have had the nod instead of Streep’s overacting ham fest in AOC.\n\nStreep shameslessly showed up to honor Thompson for a critics’ win and instead used the time to trash Disney. She was as always hungry for a nomination, and knew her only chance in a tough year (many critics derided her own AOC performance) was to kick Thompson out.\n\nShe’s a sell-out and marginally talented. She was passed over for Tracey Ullman early in in her career. Tracey is worth way more than her and doesn’t have to work a day in her life. Emma will go to the opening of an envelope. Tracey wouldn’t be caught dead accepting a royal title. Even French and Saunders turned it down. Emma had a real chip on her shoulder in the early days. Then she hooked up with her hubby and did whatever she had to do to become acceptable in polite society. What she really wanted to become was another Jennifer Saunders or Jo Brand and it just didn’t work out. Then she went for period dramas and things started happening. I’m sorry, but period shit is easy to do, especially when you’re a Brit and you have connections. I’m just not impressed by her, at least not as impressed as she is with herself.\n\nThompson's adaptation of Austen's S&S was a very smart feminist reading of the novel (and marxist, but that has less to do with her age, so we won't dwell into this aspect). She didn't do it by clumsily rewriting it in an anachronistic way, the way Patricia Rozema did with Mansfield Park (Fanny Price as a headstrong liberated woman? Really?) or Joe Wright did with Pride and Prejudice.\n\nYes, the (rather rigid) structure of the novel is all about the contradicting takes on Life of these two young (19 and 17) women, the sense vr. sensibility (duh). What Thompson did was to make the two other Dashwood members of the family far more present than they are in the novel. Because of the sheer nature of cinema, Mrs Dashwood is seen a lot, therefore much more present. And then there's Margaret, who is practically a nonentity in the book and was made into a full blown character in the film. That, and the casting of Thompson, who is NOT a 19 yo girl introduced a fascinating new way to suggest a modern take on the story while keeping it true to its time. Seeing it as depiction of four women of varied ages, each in a different stage of her life, and more significant, different stage of internalizing social codes and restrictions of what being a woman supposed to mean, make the film a poignant look on the traditional roles women had. Pre-teen tomboy Margaret is totally oblivious of the rules - in her mind she is a free spirited explorer in the making. Late teen Marian knows a woman destiny is all about the man she is going to marry, but she has this grand romantic - and rather delusional - take on it. Pushing-30 Elinor (which is what 35 yo Thomson is realistically looks like, playing an early 19th century woman) has a very levelheaded notion of what life has to offer her - she may not be happy about it, but she's willing to accept it. Late 40s/early 50s Mom is totally \"institutionalised\" - once her husband is dead, she's in a limbo, having to way - mentally AND financially - to cope, until being saves by a kind male relative.\n\nSo, whether it was by artistic and thematic choice or by Star-oriented-casting-logic necessity, Thompson works perfectly fine as Elinor. For me."
