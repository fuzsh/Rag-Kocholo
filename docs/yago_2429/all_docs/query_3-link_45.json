        "text": "Emma Thompson has revealed that her own relationship heartache inspired the famous Love Actually scene where she's seen sobbing to Joni Mitchell.\n\nThe 58-year-old actress, who plays Alan Rickman's wife in the famous 2003 romantic comedy, is left heartbroken after discovering the jewellery he bought during a Christmas shopping trip was actually intended for his beguiling assistant.\n\nEmma has now said the reason her acting was so convincing is because she had experienced something similar in her personal life - when her first husband Sir Kenneth Branagh allegedly had an affair with Helena Bonham Carter.\n\nSpeaking at a fundraiser for the Tricycle Theatre in London, she said: \"That scene where my character is standing by the bed crying is so well known because it’s something everyone’s been through.\n\n\"I had my heart very badly broken by Ken. So I knew what it was like to find the necklace that wasn’t meant for me.\n\n\"Well it wasn’t exactly that, but we’ve all been through it.\"\n\nEmma and Branagh began dating when they starred as newlyweds in BBC drama Fortunes of War in 1987.\n\nThe director and Helena are believed to have began their affair in 1994 when they were filming Mary Shelley's Frankenstein.\n\nThe actress and Branagh filed for divorce in 1995, citing their work schedules as a reason for the split. After their divorce, Branagh and Bonham Carter dated publicly until 1999.\n\nEmma went on to marry actor Greg Wise in 2003, while Branagh wed art diector Lindsay Brunnock in the same year.\n\nSpeaking previously about the rumoured affair, she told The Sunday Times: \"I’ve had so much bloody practice at crying in a bedroom, then having to go out and be cheerful, gathering up the pieces of my heart and putting them in a drawer.\"\n\nShe admitted the break up was \"all blood under the bridge\".\n\n\"You can’t hold on to anything like that,\" she went on.\n\n\"It’s pointless. I haven’t got the energy for it. Helena and I made our peace years and years ago... she’s a wonderful woman.\""
