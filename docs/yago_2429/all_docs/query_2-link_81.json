        "text": "Ken & Em: A Biography of Kenneth Branagh and Emma Thompson\n\nIan Shuttleworth, Shuttan Leworth. St. Martin's Press, $22.95 (0pp) ISBN 978-0-312-13531-7\n\nFans of English actress Thompson (Howards End) and her husband, Belfast-born actor and director Branagh (Henry V) will take little pleasure in this stilted biography. Shuttleworth, a freelance writer, did not have the cooperation of his subjects and so was limited to published interviews with the couple, newspaper accounts of their work and discreet comments from their colleagues, who are aware that Thompson and Branagh are protective of their personal life. He compares Thompson's privileged childhood with Branagh's working-class background and describes how they met. He also laboriously details their professional achievements up to now (the couple are only in their mid-30s) and adds personal critical comments. He speculates that while Branagh's future lies in directing, Thompson will focus on her film acting career. While Shuttleworth acknowledges that the two support each other professionally, he hints at troubles in their marriage. This is much ado about nothing. Photos.
