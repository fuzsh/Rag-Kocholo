So I knew what it was like to find the necklace that wasn't meant for me.\n\n\"Well it wasn't exactly that, but we've all been through it.\"\n\nThompson and Branagh, now 58, fell in love when they starred as newlyweds in the BBC drama Fortunes of War in 1987.\n\nThey married two years later and appeared together in films including Peter's Friends, Dead Again and Much Ado About Nothing.\n\nBranagh and Bonham Carter, who is seven years younger than Thompson, are said to have started an affair in 1994 while filming Mary Shelley's Frankenstein.\n\nThe following year, Thompson and Branagh filed for divorce, claiming hectic work schedules had led to the breakdown of the relationship. Branagh and Bonham Carter dated until 1999.\n\nThompson married actor Greg Wise, with whom she has two children, in 2003.\n\nIn 2013, Thompson revealed that she had \"made peace\" with Bonham Carter.\n\nDiscussing Branagh's infidelity, she told The Sunday Times: \"I've had so much bloody practice at crying in a bedroom, then having to go out and be cheerful, gathering up the pieces of my heart and putting them in a drawer.\"\n\n\"That is ... all blood under the bridge. You can't hold on to anything like that. I just think ... pfft.\"\n\n\"It's pointless. I haven't got the energy for it.. Helena and I made our peace years and years ago ... she's a wonderful woman.\""
