        "text": "NEW YORK CITY, NEW YORK: Emma Thompson recently opened up regarding her struggles in her marriage to ex-husband Kenneth Branagh. She revealed, \"I was utterly, utterly blind to the fact that he had relationships with other women on set. What I learned was how easy it is to be blinded by your desire to deceive yourself.\"\n\nBranagh had an affair with 'Harry Potter' star Helena Bonham Carter while he was married to Thompson. The duo, who married in 1989, got divorced over the affair in 1995. In 2003, Thompson married Greg Wise, who is a famous actor and producer.\n\nREAD MORE\n\nEmma Thompson reveals her teenage daughter Gaia was sexually assaulted in packed London train\n\n'Harry Potter 20th Anniversary': Here's what the films' stars are doing now\n\nWho is Emma Thompson's husband?\n\nGreg Wise, originally known as Matthew Gregory Wise, is popular for playing the role of John Willoughby in 'Sense and Sensibility'. The duo met on the sets of the film and eventually fell in love. Wise has been popular for his performances in many dramas, including Brad Fraser's 'Kill Me Now'. He was born in England to an architect Prof Douglass Wise. The actor was also popular for his BBC television dramas which included 'The Moonstone with Keeley Hawes', 'The Buccaneers' alongside Carla Gugino, 'Madame Bovary' with Frances O'Connor, and 'The Riff Raff Element'.\n\nWise also became a producer for 'The Song of Lunch' with Thompson as the lead. Wise studied architecture in college but dropped out of the course. He did his first professional job on stage with 'Good Rockin' Tonight'. The couple has two children -- daughter Gaia Romilly Wise and adopted son Tindyebwa Agaba, a Rwandan orphan and former child soldier.\n\nMeanwhile, Thompson also explained in the interview, \"I was half alive. Any sense of being a lovable or worthy person had gone completely.\" She further claimed that Wise \"picked up the pieces and put them back together.\" The actress also added, \"I've learned more from my second marriage just by being married. As my mother says, 'The first twenty years are the hardest.'\""
