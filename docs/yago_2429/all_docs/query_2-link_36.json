        "text": "EMMA THOMPSON has revealed she didn’t have to dig too deep for her crying scenes in 2003 movie Love Actually because her heart had been “badly broken” by ex-husband Kenneth Branagh, who had been unfaithful.\n\n“So I knew what it was like to find a necklace that wasn’t meant for me,” she says of the moment her character discovers her screen husband’s affair.\n\nBut every cloud etc, etc.\n\nLast week, I interviewed The Crown actor Greg Wise, to whom Emma has now been married for nearly 15 years.\n\nHe was promoting the compelling memoir of his late sister Clare, who died of cancer in 2016.\n\nEntitled Not That Kind of Love, it chronicles the highs and lows of the last three years of her life, throughout which she was nursed by Greg, who actually moved in with her for the final months.\n\nHe’d had practice because he had nursed their mother before she died.\n\nMeanwhile, Emma was also looking after her mother Phyllida Law, who has been diagnosed with Parkinson’s disease.\n\nAll of the above truly is love, actually.\n\nIn other words, as the movie suggests, love comes in all shapes and forms, and that goes for the various stages of marriage too.\n\nIn the early years of hearts, flowers and few responsibilities, it’s far easier.\n\nYou tend to focus on your own wants and needs which, in Mr Branagh’s case, was an affair with Helena Bonham Carter.\n\nBut when marriage moves into the more challenging phase of the “sandwich generation”, wedged between the needs of children and ageing parents, it can be exhausting, frustrating, and a real test of just how strong your relationship is.\n\nWhich, when it comes to Greg and Emma, is seemingly unbreakable despite him admitting he can be a “grumpy old arse”, woefully disorganised and rather too fond of beer which, when he finally returned home after his sister’s death, he found had been replaced in the fridge by Emma’s salad.\n\nSo for all those who have recently had their heart broken, take solace from their story.\n\nIt might just be that your cheating ex has done you a favour and, like Emma, you’ll end up being far happier with someone whose inevitable faults — we all have them — are outweighed by the fact that they’re dependable, loving, kind and, let’s face it, deliciously handsome.\n\n- THIS rare Picasso portrait of his “hidden mistress” has just sold for a record-breaking £49.8million.\n\nYou can see why he kept her behind closed doors.\n\nIt's Silent Witness - for real\n\nTHOSE of who you live between Scotland and the M25 will no doubt be used to routinely exchanging pleasantries with strangers.\n\nBut spare a thought for those of us living in London, where no one says anything to anyone, ever.\n\nThe absolute epitome of this is the story of North London mum Elisabeth Katompa, who got out of an Uber and walked to the other side of the car to unstrap her baby’s carrycot.\n\nUnaware, the driver pulled away with her sleeping daughter in the back – and the panicking mum did not realise she could still contact the driver through the Uber app so called 999.\n\nBut here’s where it gets really weird.\n\nThe driver picked up another passenger who said absolutely zilch about the sleeping tot on the back seat.\n\nIt wasn’t until a second passenger got in and presumably said something like, “er, someone’s left a baby, mate”, that the horrified driver realised what had happened and drove straight to a police station.\n\nYou couldn’t make it up.\n\n— SKILLS Minister Anne Milton suggests that the brightest A* pupils should consider shunning Oxbridge in favour of an apprenticeship.\n\nGood advice. Unless, of course, you want to work high up at the BBC.\n\n— GARY OLDMAN, who won the Best Actor Oscar for Darkest Hour, was once rejected by the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art, where the interviewer told him to find “a new way of earning a living”.\n\nSo bear that in mind the next time a supposed know-all tries to diss your dreams.\n\nAll just a dance Jennifer\n\nMOVIE star Jennifer Lawrence is feisty, funny and immensely likeable.\n\nAfter being criticised for wearing a barely there frock in freezing temperatures alongside the Arctic-expedition chic of her overcoat-clad male co-stars, she hit back by saying: “Everything you see me wear is my choice. And if I want to be cold that’s my choice too.”\n\nFair enough. But what are the reasons behind that choice?\n\nSpeaking on Good Morning Britain this week, red carpet veteran Stephanie Beacham remarked that Meryl Streep’s Oscar frock looked “comfy” but, “if you want a big hit in the papers the next day, it’s a corset”.\n\nMeanwhile, before she met Prince Harry and hurriedly deleted it, Meghan Markle used to write an anonymous blog called The Working Actress.\n\nIn it, the former Suits star wrote: “I am part of the horse and pony show this year . . . the outfit I will wear, the hotel I will stay at, the parties I will attend . . .\n\n“This is the ultimate ‘dance, monkey, dance’ . . . because flashing those pearly whites (ahem, veneers) and working the red carpet with your sexy little body (ahem, Spanx) is part of the job description you jumped on board for.”\n\nPrecisely. And, if you choose to do the dance then, yes, that’s absolutely your choice. But please, let’s not pretend it’s a giant step for feminism.\n\n— MORE than 80 viewers have complained to TV watchdog Ofcom after Coronation Street featured a scene in which “troubled” (you can say that again) vicar Billy Mayhew took heroin in church and declared: “This must be what heaven feels like.”\n\nCripes. Hard drugs on the cobbles? It gives a whole new meaning to Betty’s hotpot.\n\n— A NEW study has revealed that men bitch about their workmates far more than women do.\n\nAh, but when they do it, it’s referred to as constructive criticism.\n\nStrictly come... dusting?\n\nANTON DU BEKE has danced with an upright Karcher vacuum cleaner for an ad campaign.\n\nPresumably it was still more flexible than his former Strictly partner Judy Murray."
