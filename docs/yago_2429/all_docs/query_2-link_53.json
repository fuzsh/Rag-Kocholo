        "text": "Getty Images\n\nEmma Thompson is looking back at her past marriage to Kenneth Branagh and his affair with Helena Bonham Carter.\n\nThompson and Branagh were married from 1989 to 1995, and she tells The New Yorker that she was “utterly blind to the fact that he had relationships with other women on set.”\n\nKenneth cheated with Helena on the 1994 movie “Mary Shelley’s Frankenstein,” and Thompson said, \"What I learned was how easy it is to be blinded by your own desire to deceive yourself.\"\n\nThompson isn’t holding a grudge against Branagh or Bonham Carter. She told The Sunday Times in 2013, \"That is… all blood under the bridge. You can't hold on to anything like that, It's pointless. I haven't got the energy for it… Helena and I made our peace years and years ago… She's a wonderful woman.\"\n\nWhen she first learned of the affair, however, she tells The New Yorker she felt “half alive.”\n\n\"Any sense of being a lovable or worthy person had gone completely,\" she explained.\n\nIt is her current husband Greg Wise who \"picked up the pieces and put them back together.\"\n\nThey have been together 27 years and married for 19. \"I've learned more from my second marriage just by being married,\" Thompson explained. \"As my mother says, 'The first twenty years are the hardest.'”"
