        "text": "October 29, 2022\n\nSF Masterworks (2010 relaunch series) #20: A speculative fiction treat first published in a sense shattering 1944! Sirius, thanks to extensive experimenting with biochemistry and breeding, is essentially a dog with the intelligence of a human being. Narrated by a romantic interest of the woman that Sirius was raised with like a foster-brother, but even closer(!), this is Sirius's life story. Although on the face of things the concept felt like an American B movie from the 190s, what makes this book standout is not only how unbelievably well it has aged, but how Stapledon really envisions how a dog with an human intellect would not only feel and do, but struggle with the physical limits put upon him from both his physical make-up and humanity's uncomfortableness with his existence. Good read! 7.5 out of 12.\n\n2022 read\n\nSeptember 25, 2012\n\nDuring the early decades of the 20th century, many intellectuals devoted attention to the idea of what a \"Superman\" would look like. (George Bernard Shaw is a prominent example). After a while, the emphasis shifted; the Nazis gave the word unpleasant associations, though Professors Siegel and Shuster luckily managed to save it from oblivion with their discovery that the Übermensch would carry a cape and wear his underpants on the outside, an important point that had somehow escaped Nietzsche's attention. A strange example of the cross-over between these two streams was Olaf Stapledon. A professor of philosophy by day, I'm guessing that his conception of the Übermensch probably started off at the Nietzsche end; but his science-fiction, which is the only thing that people now remember him for, also contains elements vaguely reminding you of the Son of Krypton.\n\nMost of Stapledon's books explore the Superman theme in one form or another. In his most famous works, Last and First Men and the sequel Star Maker, we see the future evolution of the human race, and later on the evolution of all life in the Universe, towards its godlike conclusion. Odd John is a more standard guy-with-amazing-powers story, though a considerably more intelligent one than average. And in Sirius, a book that deserves to be better known, he turns it round. It's unfortunately impossible to imagine what a Superman would be like, since we are only human; this is the insoluble problem at the heart of Odd John. But suppose, instead, that human scientists managed to produce an Überhund, a dog with human-like intelligence. What kind of life would it have? How would it relate to other dogs, and to people?\n\nStapledon did not have an optimistic take on things, and if you've read any of his other books then you've no doubt already guessed that this one is going to be tragic. But it's a surprisingly moving story, and Sirius is one of the great fictional dogs of literature. If you're a dog-lover yourself, consider putting it on your list.\n\nJanuary 14, 2018\n\nNature or nature? Which is it that makes us who we are?\n\nThis book absolutely tore at my heart strings. I was prolonging my finishing the book, as I felt the ending was inevitable, but it didn't hurt any less. I felt so much sadness and wonder at the character of Sirius, the \"super sheep dog\", imbued not only with human intellect, but also the human frailties of jealousy, love, and questions of the spirit.\n\nNothing I write here can express how deeply this book affected me.\n\nApril 5, 2023\n\nPillow talk that is only about the present should be a warning flag. In love, the same as film noir, if the past isn't shared, something isn't right.\n\n\"Plaxy and I had been lovers; rather uneasy lovers, for she would never speak freely about her past . . . \" the narrator says. His name is Robert and he's as ordinary as his name. He tells this story of his love for Plaxy and her love for a dog.\n\nWe're not speaking here of fondness. The love me, love my doberman kind of thing. This is something altogether different as Robert finds out.\n\n\"I began to understand why it was that our love had always been uneasy, and why when her mother died she did not come back to me. I began to debate with myself the best way of freeing her from this 'inhuman bondage.' But as the conversation proceeded I could not but recognize that this strange relationship of girl and dog was fundamentally beautiful, in a way sacred. (That was the word I used to myself.) Thus my problem became far more difficult.\"\n\nPlaxy loves the dog like a brother and more, much more than that. As a rival, for her affection, Robert is no match apart from the fact that he is human. Sirius (as he's called) has only the mind of a man. His body, though massive and strong, is all dog. The product of her father's experiment, Sirius, like Rappaccini's daughter, is both beautiful and monstrous. Think Heathcliff with more heart, that's this Alsation (German shepherd) and border collie mix.\n\n\"Oh for hands! At night I dream of hands,\" he cries. And I nearly cried more than once. Me. A lover of cats.\n\nJanuary 8, 2019\n\nSo much love!\n\nOlaf Stapledon was a lot of things. Philosopher in real life, novelist in his spare time. But what really made him stand out was the fact that he could write short novels that encompass VAST stretches of time, events, and concepts. One had him envisioning a fate of mankind both good and bad across many thousands of years, or following a future history of mankind until all versions of us died off over a million years, or even encompassing the entire breadth of time and space until we're masters of the universe... and beyond.\n\nAnd then we have THIS beautiful little novel that seems as far from any of these as anything I might imagine from him!\n\nThis came out in 1944. But think Lassie (ten years after this) meets Flowers for Algernon (15 years after this). Add a serious tone about fitting in when in 30's and 40's England when you're not the right skin shade or sex, throw in a very disturbing commentary on religion \"for the right kind\", and make two unforgettable characters in love with each other. And do it without making it creepy.\n\nAnd what you have is Sirius. One of the very best tales of its kind. You can substitute the dog with a man's intelligence with any member of society who just Can Not fit in and this would be on par with any classic of traditional literature.\n\nHonestly, the more I read of Olaf Stapledon, the more timeless his writing becomes. This ought to be a true classic on everyone's shelves if you like SF at all.\n\nAugust 2, 2022\n\n\"There is no place for me in man’s world, and there is no other world for me. There is no place for me anywhere in the universe.\"\n\nAlthough this 1944 novel is classed as “sci-fi”, in my opinion it has only a tenuous connection with that genre. Fundamentally this is a philosophical novel, that paints a picture of humanity from the perspective of an outsider, and considers our own treatment of “the outsider”.\n\nThe novel opens in Britain during the interwar period, and the sci-fi aspect comes with scientist Thomas Trelone creating a new type of dog, with human level intelligence. The author doesn’t really bother with the science of how this might be achieved, merely hinting vaguely at surgery and the injection of hormones. All the puppies in his experimental group die save one, the “Sirius” of the book’s title. As Sirius laments at one point “It’s as though God had made Adam and not bothered to make Eden, nor Eve.”\n\nThe story is told from the perspective of “Robert” who is the lover of Sirius’ human “sister” Plaxy, who grew up with Sirius and with whom she shares an intense emotional bond, so much so that she refers to herself as “the human part of Sirius-Plaxy”.\n\nSirius is caught between two worlds, being neither one nor the other. His biological nature is canine, and he does what a dog does, but his ability to understand the human world also sets him apart from other dogs. Despite his intelligence he remains just a dog in the eyes of the law, vulnerable to ill-treatment from humans and liable to be simply killed if he were judged to pose any danger. The novel is mostly set in NW Wales, where Sirius grows up amongst sheepdogs and learns their trade himself. He also spends time in Cambridge University and in the East End of London. He is a mere curiosity to the Cambridge dons and eventually returns to North Wales. However many of the religiously inclined population of that area view him as a creation of Satan, and the coming of WW2 also creates an atmosphere of fear and paranoia around such a strange creature as Sirius.\n\nI think anyone who has read Frankenstein will see marked similarities with that novel.\n\n“Robert”, writes in the style of a dispassionate observer. Many readers say they found the book very emotional. I didn’t particularly, as I found the detached style of “Robert” a bit of a barrier in that regard. I was left thinking that “Sirius” had been a worthwhile read, but for me not an exceptional one.\n\nMost of the ratings seem higher than mine though, so don’t let me put you off!\n\nApril 7, 2016\n\nWhy did you make only one of me? It's going to be lonely being me.\n\nWhat do we mean when we talk about community?\n\nIt's a word that always seems to be prefaced with something else - a location, an interest, a profession. It's hard to strip away those descriptors, to uncover those individuals with no apparent \"community\", those who challenge us to redefine the word and reevaluate how open our hearts and minds are.\n\nWith fervor he insisted that the most valuable social relationships were those between minds as different from one another as possible yet capable of mutual sympathy.\n\nA product of biological engineering, Sirius is a dog with the intellect of a human, an interloper between species without a true home in either. We follow him from a puppyhood - as he tries to imitate his human \"sister\" as she stacks toy bricks - to an adulthood where he at various points plays the role of sheep herder, scientist, and religious cantor. Along the way he witnesses (and inevitably participates in) cycles of manipulation and abuse that occur between different communities, from families to countries and species. He learns the meaning of war, of prejudice, of disability. And even so, sometimes he manages to glimpse what could be achieved through a community where differences are respected and cherished as much as commonalities.\n\n\"There is no place for me in man's world, and there is no other world for me. There is no place for me anywhere in the universe.\"\n\nShe answered, \"But wherever I am, there is always a place for you.\"\n\nMarch 5, 2024\n\nA shade of Frankenstein?\n\nSirius, a dog with human intelligence and emotion presents a warts and all view of humanity from the perspective of a true outsider.\n\nCreated in a lab Sirius laments that he is one of a kind, he doesn’t fit in the world of dogs or man. He loves Plaxy, the girl he was raised with but he can only love her mind while only physically loving another dog.\n\nThough this was written in the 40’s it doesn’t really come off as dated, the theme of being an outcast is just as relevant today.\n\nOctober 25, 2009\n\nOh man...\n\nI'm either a sentimental animal-lover at heart or a preternaturally genius mind trapped in the lumpen, inefficient body of a mere animal (I jest, I jest) but this book really did move me in a way that not a lot of genre fiction has done.\n\nStapledon is best known for his twin individuality-shattering monuments Last and First Men and Starmaker which are probably the two most criminally underlooked examples of speculative fiction in my experience of the genre, particularly the first. I'm not feeling sufficiently demi-godlike to tackle a review of either of those at this hour so instead I'll talk about Sirius.\n\nIn line with the aforementioned books, Stapledon is often criticised for a cold, emotionless style of writing, and it's true that his characters (where they are even relevant- and here they certainly are) come across as a little cardboard. Sirius the dog, however, \"born with the mind of a man\" as the back of my edition somewhat luridly states, is a freak of science that I fell in love with.\n\nThe book tracks his progression as the dog grows into maturity along with his creator's daughter, the weirdly named Plaxy. We see many facets of his life, as he ponders religion, language and learning. Some of his attempts to \"achieve humanity\" are really heartbreaking, and I found particularly crushing his relationships with his bitches (and I'm not being funny) Physically, he's got no problems- it's just to him they are just dumb, rutting animals, nothing more...\n\nIt struck me as having a very humanist tone, reminiscent of John Wyndham's work in places, but the ending ensures that we can safely file this alongside Stapledon's other books as a somewhat elegaic musing on what sentient life can struggle with, and sadly, be reduced to.\n\nI suppose it could be argued that Frankenstein and the long line of science fiction in that vein have covered all this ground already, the idea of science creating something beautiful but flawed, and ignorant torch waving mobs and so on...but this is a remarkably thoughtful approach to it, and I really feel that Olaf's analytical genius was reigned in on a different, but no less powerful plane of thinking here.\n\nTo those that accuse Stapledon of being a pitiless theoretician, I urge you to read this book, and, to a lesser extent, Odd John .\n\nPS. I must also say that the book made consider the oceans of dreck that make up the \"talking animal\" sub-genre of children's film in a very different way. Imagine a lamenting Babe, squealing with self-loathing as he wallows in his own filth, his career as a youth worker impeded at every trot...\n\nJune 10, 2022\n\nThis is an SF novel from now largely forgotten but extremely interesting British author, whose main works are from the 1930s and 40s, in particular this very book from 1944. I read it as a part of monthly reading for June 2022 at Hugo & Nebula Awards: Best Novels group. The novel was nominated in 2019 for 1944 Best Novel (Retro-Hugo), but was below the cutoff line with just three votes. The winner in this category was Conjure Wife by Fritz Leiber.\n\nThe book starts with a narrator, a military pilot on leave (note the year of the publication), visiting his fiancé in the Welsh countryside. After some search, he finally finds her with a giant dog with a large head. The dog is Sirius and he is the only successful result of his fiancé’s father's experiments of creating a ‘missing link’ a non-human with a human level of intelligence. What follows is a collection of notes written by the dog as well as memories of people who met him, which our narrator gathered at an unspecified later date.\n\nThere are two themes to which his novel pays homage. First, it is what is called by many ‘the first SF novel’ – Frankenstein: The 1818 Text by Mary Wollstonecraft Shelley. Here like is Shelley’s book we have a creature that is intelligent and articular, but which is outside the mankind, often in unpeaceful confrontation. Secondly, the popular in the 1920s-40s idea of evolution next step, like in Gladiator by Philip Wylie, but maybe more known as Superman, who is not accidentally not called the man from stars, but the man of tomorrow.\n\nThe story is slow, old-fashioned ‘biography’ of Sirius, there isn’t a lot of action-adventure but a bit of then-popular in fiction Freudian psychology. I liked the book very much, but this can be partially because I’m a dog person and partially because I needed some slow-going escapism story. Others may find it boring and too old-fashioned.\n\nSeptember 12, 2014\n\n'Sirius' is one of those haunting, one-of-a-kind books that will stay with you far longer than it takes to read its 190-odd pages. Sometimes joyful, often searing; through the eyes of his unique protagonist Stapledon takes a scalpel to humanity, and the skill of his dissection is reason enough to recommend this book.\n\nI'd also recommend 'Sirius' to anyone interested in writing sentient, communicative animals while respecting their underlying biology.\n\nYes, the main character is a bioengineered, talking dog with human-level intelligence, the only one of his kind. Sounds clichéd and awful, right? Wrong. In completely non-emotive, even detached and dry language Stapledon delivers a huge emotional and philosophical punch. This short book is a parable of the destruction of an individual spirit by society, and a terrible indictment of humanity's faults.\n\n\"Why did you make only one of me? It's going to be lonely being me.\"\n\nSirius can't fit in either as a dog or as a human, though he's driven by impulses from both species. He flips between savagery and tenderness in a heartbeat. He hates not having hands, can't see colour or distinguish shapes very well, but smells and sounds to him communicate a whole world that humans can't touch. In fact, all of the descriptions of his dog-mode existence are totally compelling. At the same time he's capable of strong emotional bonds with humans, loving \"as only a dog can\", notably the girl with whom he was raised from birth. The relationship between the two of them is disturbing yet beautiful, and is at the core of the book.\n\nFor such a short read 'Sirius' is overflowing with themes. The inability of science or religion, taken individually, to satisfy the spirit; the nature of individuality and of self-worth; the joy of empathy - even across species - in contrast with the tragedy of loneliness; the corrosive effects of fear, bigotry and intolerance when society has to deal with the unknown.\n\n'Sirius' was first published in 1944, but don't let the vintage put you off. Stapledon is better known for the epic scope of 'Last and First Men' and 'Star Maker', but 'Sirius' will break your heart.\n\nJanuary 16, 2022\n\nเขียนบรรยายถึงความรู้สึกและมุมมองของสุนัขที่กลับกลายเป็นมนุษย์ การเติบโตของตัวตนและอารมณ์ของมนุษย์ การแสวงหาเป้าหมายของชีวิต และโศกนาฎกรรมที่จากความไม่เข้าใจของสังคม ได้อย่างกินใจยิ่ง\n\nแม้จะเขียนขึ้นมานานแล้ว แต่ก็นับเป็นนิยายวิทยาศาสตร์คลาสสิกที่เนื้อหายังไม่ตกยุคสมัย ไม่ควรพลาดที่จะได้อ่านสักครั้งหนึ่ง\n\nApril 5, 2024\n\nI enjoyed this even more on a reread: the mix of deep discussion and complex relationships touched me deeply. On my first read, I found the writing style detached and unemotional, but this time it just hit differently.\n\nMarch 2, 2017\n\nThis book is a highly entertaining read. It is about a dog who is genetically engineered to have a human like brain. The whole book is then a sort of struggle between the animals' instincts and it's higher reasoning and logical nature. It works well as a good metaphor for the instinctive nature of man constantly wrestling with the reasoning nature of man. The book itself is a good critique on human nature from an \"outsider\" that can speak to us. The writing is well done and the ending was well writ, albeit very sad indeed. Overall I gave it a perfect 5 because towards the end of the book you come away feeling like you have lived alongside the dog Sirius. I also gave it 5 stars for it's scathing outsider critique of humanity.\n\nApril 6, 2019\n\nGrāmata, par spīti nosaukumam, nav tikai par suni Sirius, bet arī par viņa kompanjoni Plaxy, ar kuru kopā uzauguši kopš dzimšanas.

Grāmata man gāja uz priekšu ļoti lēni, visticamāk daudzo Siriusa filozofisko pārspriedumu un laika perioda, kurā notika grāmatas darbība, dēļ (starpkaru periods, un Otrais Pasaules karš). Bet tagad vairāk novērtēju savu multifunkcionālo roku un redzes, lai arī nav man tā perfekta, priekšrocības. No zinātniskās fantastikas te gan par maz bija manai labpatikai.\n\nJune 3, 2023\n\nI knew nothing about this before reading and i havn't read any other reviews yet but i'm pretty sure about what aspect of this story most reviews are likely to focus on :lol .\n\nAnyway so this is about a dog given human level intelligence and examines his life and that of the girl who he's raised alongside.\n\nIts such a detailed... logical... psychological and social examination of its central premise, really interesting. It reminded me strongly of certain superhero story's like Gladiator or Swamp Thing. Or perhaps Frankenstein if the monster wasn't rejected by his creator, or maybe Beauty and the Beast if there was never any chance of lifting the curse ;) .\n\nAnd if your thinking, 'sentient dog and close relationship with human girl, is this going to get creepy?' well rest assured that...\n\nSirius made another remark with a sly look and a tremor of the tail. She turned back to him laughing, and softly smacked his face. \"Beast,\" she said, \"I shall not tell Robert that.\"\n\n...eh, yes yes it will get a bit creepy :P .\n\nThe dry, logical writing stops it getting too uncomfortable though but this also leads to the main issue. The dry tone works fine most of the time but theres a couple of key scenes involving deaths which should have been really involving and moving but instead fall flat because of the writing.\n\nSo despite how interesting from an intellectual point of view the plot is i was still only going to give it 3 stars, however the writer does manage to pull off the last vital scene with a flourish and i am a sucker for a solid ending so bumped to 4 just about.\n\nEdit: Made available by the Merril Collection.\n\nJanuary 16, 2023\n\n\"There is no place for me in man's world, and there is no other world for me. There is no place for me anywhere in the universe\" - page 190.\n\nSirius is probably Stapledon's most intimate novel that both demonstrates his maturity as a writer and his finesse as a contemplator on what it is to be human. The book is made all the more remarkable when it is realised that these observations on humanity are observed through the eyes of the dog Sirius who has his level of intelligence raised to that of a human being.\n\nStapledon is at his best when he is operating outside of the box and nowhere is that more true than in this tale of a super-intelligent dog's odyssey for spiritual understanding and acceptance both in regards to his conflicted human/canine nature and in the eyes of his human companions.\n\nSirius is a study of the self and that self's exploration of reality and his contemplations of what, if anything, lay beyond the immediate impressions of this reality. Indeed, some of the best moments in the book are Sirius's wonderings in religion and in the conflicts between his human higher functions and instinctual wolf nature.\n\nOverall, Sirius has less of the vast scale typically attributed to Stapledon and his other well known works, but when dealing with the subject of the interior soul Sirius is bolder, braver and vastly more human than Stapledon's previous odysseys. This is Stapledon coming to turns with his own nature and encouraging the reader to do likewise.\n\nJuly 16, 2020\n\nFor all those folks out there who hold conversations with their pet dog and know for certain that Fido/Fifi understands every word; for those who have gotten a tad \"verklempt\" at the conclusion of such novels as \"The Call of the Wild\" and \"Old Yeller\"; for people who believe that canines just cannot get any smarter than Lassie, Rin Tin Tin or Benji, all of whom starred in innumerable motion pictures; and, well, really, for anybody with a soft spot in his or her heart for man's best friend, have I got a book for you! That book is none other than British philosopher/author Olaf Stapledon's \"Sirius,\" which, as I write these words, is in the running to win a Retro Hugo Award for Best Novel, 1944. Originally released as a hardcover volume by the English publishing house Secker & Warburg, this beautifully written and ultimately quite moving story gives us, following its initial sci-fi setup, a work of ideas and philosophical musings. Subtitled \"A Fantasy of Love and Discord,\" and featuring what must surely be the brainiest canine in all literature, the novel makes sharp observations about society, history, religion and relationships, all wrapped up in a most atypical eternal-triangle story. This was my first experience with Mr. Stapledon, and if this bravura effort (his seventh novel, I believe) is any indication, I'm going to be reading more very soon.\n\n\"Sirius\" takes the form of a biography that was written by a man named Robert. No, we never learn overly much about Robert, or even his last name; only that he is an Air Force soldier of some kind during WW2, is a budding novelist, and is the suitor of a young woman named Plaxy Trelone. (I know...Plaxy?) After Plaxy's mother falls ill, the daughter returns to the family's home in northern Wales to take care of her, and Robert begins to receive confusing letters from his sweetheart. He goes to visit Plaxy while on leave, and discovers that her mother has since passed away. He also gets to meet, for the first time, Sirius, the family dog, who had been born right around the same time as Plaxy. The two have been more than close ever since. But Sirius is far from the average house pet. Plaxy's late father, Thomas Trelone, had been an eminent physiologist, and had attempted, via the use of injected hormones and a meticulous breeding program, to create a line of superintelligent sheepdogs. He had succeeded, but even amongst these, Sirius was something extraspecial. As Robert immediately discerns, Sirius and Plaxy are able to hold a running conversation between themselves, the dog speaking a rough (ruff?) form of English. Using Trelone's scientific notes, as well as verbal testimony from Sirius himself, Robert is thus able to put together the biography that takes up the bulk of this volume. And so, we see how Trelone had mixed a German shepherd with a champion border collie and, several strains later, gotten the phenomenon that was Sirius, the only survivor of a litter of four.\n\nOver the course of Robert's bio, we see Sirius learn to speak, and then read, and then write using a specially designed mitten. We follow him through his youth, see him become a sheepdog apprentice at a neighboring farm (very soon, he is leading the other sheepdogs and even carrying baskets of medicine onto the moors to tend to the sheep's physical ailments!), and behold as he sows some wild oats in disgust at his lot, living like a wild wolf in the hills. Later, however, Sirius goes to Cambridge University to be studied; asks to live with a pastor in London, so as to discover more about religion; learns something of mankind's brutal side, after hearing of the horrors of WW2 and experiencing some of them firsthand; becomes the sole manager of a sheep farm; and becomes something of a pariah and outlaw, when the local townspeople begin to think of him as a devil's familiar, and even of having a carnal relationship with Plaxy. And, oh...did I mention that Sirius also composes music, does a solo performance in an East End church, and even, at one point, writes, addresses and mails a letter? But just in case you are wondering if this prodigy has anything in common with an ordinary dog, the answer is a most definite \"yes.\" Thus, we see Sirius chasing after bitches, hunting, killing another dog in a jealous fit, even killing a man in self-defense. He is, he believes, a human-type spirit in a handless dog's body, a source of endless confusion and frustration for the poor animal...not to mention endless introspection and self-appraisal.\n\nAs I mentioned earlier, Stapledon's novel makes some sharp observations about the human condition, as seen through Sirius' POV and delivered via some wonderfully written passages. Thus, regarding mankind’s treatment of the canine race, we are told that Sirius felt:\n\n\"...There were those who were simply indifferent to dogs, lacking sufficient imagination to enter into any reciprocal relation with them. There were the \"dog-lovers,\" whom he detested. These were folk who sentimentalized dogs, and really had no accurate awareness of them, exaggerating their intelligence and loveableness, mollycoddling them and over-feeding them; and starving their natural impulses of sex, pugnacity and hunting. For this sort, dogs were merely animate and 'pathetically human' dolls. Then there were the dog-detesters, who were either too highbrow to descend to companionship with a dumb animal or too frightened of their own animal nature. Finally there were the \"dog-interested,\" who combined a fairly accurate sense of the difference between dog and man with a disposition to respect a dog as a dog, as a rather remote but essentially like-minded relative....\"\n\nAs for his fellow canines themselves, Sirius feels a hearty sorrow:\n\n\"...It seemed to him incredible that the dominant species should keep so many of the dominated species alive in complete idleness, for not one of these pampered animals had any function but to be the living toy of some man or woman. Physically they were nearly all in good condition, save for a common tendency to corpulence, which in some cases reached a disgusting fulfillment. Mentally they were unwholesome. How could it be otherwise? They had nothing to do but wait for their meals, sink from boredom into sleep, attend their masters or mistresses on gentle walks, savour one another's odours, and take part in the simple ritual of the lamp-post and the gate-post. Sexually they were all starved, for bitches were few, and jealously guarded by their human owners. Had not the canine race been of sub-human intelligence, they must one and all have been neurotics, but their stupidity saved them....\"\n\nI offer these two extended quotes as a means of demonstrating both Stapledon's wonderfully incisive writing style as well as his sharp and detailed observations. I urge you to learn for yourself what Sirius--who is not only the possessor of human intelligence, but patently above-average human intelligence--has to say on matters pertaining to organized religion, God, love, relationships, war, the family and so on. He is a wonderful and touching character who manages to express himself marvelously, and the reader cannot help but be impressed with and moved by him. We feel for his lot as a misfit, fully at home neither in the world of the humans nor the canines. I will not reveal whether or not things end happily for Sirius, but will advise readers to have some Kleenex at the ready.\n\nDuring the course of this biography, we are made privy to the relationships that Sirius enters into with a varied group of characters, but of all these relationships, none are as deep, as long lasting and as complex as the one he has with Plaxy. A fantastically long-lived animal, Sirius, when we first encounter him, has known Plaxy for over 20 years. The two, as mentioned, grew up together, and we get to see Sirius grow jealous of the young girl's hands and, later, of her going away to school and becoming interested in boys. Plaxy, for her part, at times grows resentful of her pet's jealousy and of his moody fits, and is unfailingly shocked by his savage outbursts. But at the bottom of their complex relationship--one that is made even more complicated when Robert enters the picture--is a bedrock of deep love and mutual affection that abides until the book's touching final page. As Sirius movingly tells his mistress at one point, \"The smell of you is more lovely really than the crazy-making scents of bitches.\" This is hardly another story of \"a girl and her dog.\"\n\n\"Sirius,\" it should be noted, is a very British type of affair, and Stapledon, who was born on the Wirral Peninsula, close by to northern Wales, obviously knew his book's setting very well. Personally, this reader found a good atlas handy when looking up such Welsh locales in the novel as Ffestiniog, Trawsfynydd, the Vale of Clwyd, Dolgelly and Aberystwyth, as well as such mountain chains as the Arenigs, Moelwyns and Rhinogs. Likewise, a good dictionary came in handy for such Welsh words as \"cwm,\" \"llyn,\" \"bwlch,\" \"moel\" and \"ghyll.\" The author makes us see and feel this lonely moorland setting very well, and has obviously done his homework regarding sheepherding and ovine diseases. His book is perfectly paced, consistently fascinating, unfailingly intelligent and--once the reader has bought into the central premise--highly credible. Indeed, other than the misuse of a few words--such as \"solicitation\" instead of \"solicitousness,\" and \"lintel\" instead of \"jamb\"--it is a practically flawless creation by this highly esteemed British author.\n\nAll of which, I suppose, begs the question: Should \"Sirius\" cop that Retro Hugo prize? Well, truthfully, I am hardly the person to ask, never having read its five competitors. But let’s run down the list. \"Land of Terror\" is the sixth entry in Edgar Rice Burroughs' Pellucidar series, and although ERB is a perennial favorite of many, the fact that his book is just one in a series might work against it. Leigh Brackett, one of my favorite Golden Age writers, is represented by her novel \"Shadow Over Mars,\" which I really do need to pick up one day. Brackett is another fan favorite who should never be counted out. And then there is Robert Graves' \"The Golden Fleece,\" which has somehow gotten nominated despite its not being a work of science fiction at all. I would disqualify it on that basis alone. Eric Linklater's \"The Wind on the Moon\" is apparently a quite popular novel, although one more geared to adolescents than adults. Finally, \"The Winged Man,\" based on a short story by E. Mayne Hull and later expanded into novel form by her husband, A.E. van Vogt, might be working under a handicap due to its unusual provenance. And so, we have \"Sirius,\" a book that boasts not only a bona fide (bona fido?) science fictional background geared solidly toward mature adults, but also more thoughtful intelligence and philosophical insight--not to mention solid writing--than most books that you are likely to encounter. I may be prejudiced here because it is the only one of the six that I have read, but can't help feeling that the smart bettors should put their money right here. I just loved this book, as you might have discerned...so much so that I am about to begin another Stapledon novel dealing with the subject of superintelligence: 1935's \"Odd John,\" which can fortunately be found in the same Dover edition as \"Sirius.\" Can it possibly be as good as this wonder-filled novel from 1944? Stay tuned....\n\n(By the way, this review originally appeared on the FanLit website at http://www.fantasyliterature.com/ ... a most ideal destination for all fans of Olaf Stapledon....)\n\nMay 11, 2017\n\nA few years back I made a concerted effort to fill in some of the glaring 'gaps' in my SF reading by reading some of the renowned authors and classics of the field that I had hitherto not read. I did manage to fill in many such gaps but one that remained until now was Olaf Stapledon. It's good to finally rectify that even if not with the most obvious choice.\n\nA moving and tragic story about what life might be like for a dog with artificially induced intelligence growing up in a human world. How does he reconcile his dog nature with his human upbringing and what light does it shed on humanity and the way it treats both dogs generally and Sirius in particular?\n\nA pleasant and thought provoking read but never really blew me away. Perhaps I should go with one of his more widely recognised classics next, such as Star Maker or Last and First Men?\n\nJuly 26, 2019\n\nWhile this is deeply emotional, it feels also detached because of the way it is written. It reads like a biography, while also having similarities to saga novels, coming of age and it is also so much about the meaning of life.\n\nThe conflict of Sirius is relatable and his relationship to his \"sister\" Plaxy compelling. It tackles science, religion, occupations and relationships, so everything that can be meaningful in life, and shows it from this relatable but also foreign perspective. It had kind of a \"frankensteins monster\" vibe, even though Sirius had a much better life.\n\nIt could have been much more touching if the writing wasn't so dry.\n\nStill, this is a good recommendation to get into Sci-Fi if you haven't read any before but also offers a lot of new and meaningful things to established sf readers.\n\nMarch 30, 2015\n\nThis is a story about a genetically altered sheep dog with human intelligence who tries to figure out what his purpose in life is in a human world. Can he achieve his mission of finding purpose and love without unleashing his wolf-mood that comes naturally to him? Read on and find out.\n\nThis was a pretty good and sad story that I found on feedbooks. If you like stories about dogs, definitely check it out for yourself.\n\nSeptember 22, 2010\n\nOlaf Stapledon, is undoubtedly best known for his amazing novels \"Star Maker\" and \"Last and First Men\", but if that is all you have read from him then you have missed out on his writings which are in a more traditional style. \"Sirius: A Fantasy of Love and Discord\", published in 1944, is an excellent book as well, though not on the same scale as those earlier works. It is the story of a \"super sheepdog\" (Sirius), who was biologically engineered with hormones, and raised along with the daughter (Plaxy) of the scientist (Thomas Trelone). It is a tragic story, in which Sirius struggles between the worlds of his human family and his canine instinct. A unique bond is formed between Plaxy and Sirius that shapes both of their lives.\n\n\"Sirius\" can stand alone, or be considered part of Stapledon's vast future universe as outlined in his other works. The story is simply on a much smaller scale, and so would not in and of itself be a noteworthy event in books like \"Last and First Men\" or \"Star Maker\". Thomas Trelone is Stapledon's Frankenstein, though certainly he does not suffer from the same character flaws as Shelly's famous predecessor. At the same time, Trelone admits that he failed to consider all of the consequences of his experiment, which led to a very lonely and torn character in Sirius. Sirius cannot fit in with humans for many reasons, though Sirius himself focuses on the lack of hands. Sirius also doesn't fit with other canines, as he finds them too simple and only interesting when a female is in heat.\n\nThis book was tied for 9th on the Arkham Survey in 1949 as one of the `Basic SF Titles', which was a higher rank than \"Star Maker\" (tied for 13th) received. Perhaps the main reason this book is no longer as highly regarded as Stapledon's other books is due to the fact that it is a more traditional style of writing. Innovation counts for a lot with the fans of this genre, and over the course of time more traditional works can be forgotten. However, this book should not be forgotten nor should Stapledon's \"Odd John\", because though they are told in a more traditional manner, they still are uniquely Stapledon, and as such they are both worth reading.\n\nJanuary 4, 2020\n\nSirius is a remarkable book. It took me three days until I was able to write this review because there was so much stuff to think about after the last word was read. With it’s nearly 200 pages the book took me way longer to finish than I anticipated, because of all those thinking breaks.\n\nWhat made this book so special to me, was how it dealt with the topic of affiliation: The natural desire for company, whether through friends, family or in this specific case just likeminded conspecifics, has a fundamental significance for every sentient creature. But what if you are the only one of your kind? What about Sirius?\n\n“I'm afraid I'm not working out according to plan,\" he said. \"But if I am really a person you shouldn't expect me to. Why did you make me without making a world for me to live in. It's as though God had made Adam and not bothered to make Eden, nor Eve. I think it's going to be frightfully difficult being me.”\n\nOlaf Stapledon shows how hard it can be, to work out to the expectations of society. I personally know it well, the omnipresent feeling of doing something wrong, the groundless fear of standing out negatively somehow. Being different isn’t necessarily something bad but it can make your life harder in some ways. And Sirius is different. Sirius thinks, feels and partly speaks like his fellow men but he’s no man but a dog. He’s a dog with paws, unable to write a book or play the piano like a man with his hands. A dog, demoted as property, without any human rights. A conscious dog with feelings in a world, where all the other dogs are driven by instincts and none of them knows, what the thing, called love, is.\n\nSirius is a lonely creature in a world without any space for him. Nevertheless, this humorous, poetic and untiringly fighting four-legged friend showed me, how important it is, to hold your head high, and even despite your strangeness, keep chasing your dreams.\n\n“We are bound to hurt one another so much, again and again. we are so terribly different.''Yes,' he said, 'But the more different, the more lovely the loving.”\n\nApril 22, 2018\n\nI owned another novel by Stapledon many years ago and got rid of it for whatever reason, without reading it. Sirius came to me via my generous brother and that gave me the incentive to plough on.\n\nThe writing style is easy to read and the age of the book (1944) does not hinder a modern reader too much. The setting of this classic is mostly North Wales and Cambridge (with a diversion to the East End of London) and therefore we learn a lot about shepherding (but not too much) and how dogs work with sheep. We also have the comparison of the 'wild' of the country life compared to the constricted town life with their prissy poofed-up dogs whose lovely natural smell is overwritten with cloying perfumes, according to Sirius.\n\nSirius, of course, is a super-intelligent dog who gives mankind a view of mankind from an outsider's perspective. The inner thought processes of the dog are hard to bear at times as he 'smells' humans so well, understanding how the face can say one thing; the smell the other- the truth! I enjoyed Sirius' encounter with a minister as he works out his theological thinking. He has already encountered hypocrisy in man and appreciates a religious person who is practical in supporting his fellow mankind.\n\nMy only disappointment would be the ending, although, I suppose, it was inevitable. A very worthy member of the SF Masterworks series\n\nMay 8, 2014\n\nI should not have read this book. I had set myself a task of working my way through the stack of books that I have been meaning to read for sometime. Something drew me to the book shop and in turn to the sci fi section, and then to Olaf Stapledon. Sirius seemed like it would be a nice little read. So I picked it up. I was wrong. It wasn't nice, it was incredible. I resented work and sleep as it prevented me from reading.\n\nI will not go to much into the actual book itself as I don't like spoilers. The style that Stapledon wrote in fits my style of reading, I found the story flowed fluidly and the way he built the scene and characters was clear and easy. Except at the end of the book, this story could have just as easily been set in the hear and now, which considering it was written over 60 years ago is not bad going.\n\nThe way in which he uses Sirius and the supporting cast to explore how we define humanity, love, and religion (the soul), is really well planned out.\n\nI loved every word and plan to seek out more Stapledon. Not just his fiction but his philosophical work as well. Best side track I've ever committed.\n\nJanuary 18, 2022\n\nAn intelligent dog cannot find peace and happiness among the super-apes who rule this planet.\n\nFirst his biggest problem seems to be that he has a hard time finding a purpose in life. Then, when the unpleasant traits of the humans show themselves, it gets really ugly.\n\nFor a book from the 40s this one is quite modern. No misogyny, no chauvinism. Even the science was not embarrassingly out of date.\n\nAn interesting view of humanity \"from the outside\". The mixture of human and canine traits was very well done.\n\nI liked the first 2/3 quite a bit, not so much the last third.\n\nSome of the philosophical and religious aspects were over my head.\n\n3.5 stars.\n\nApril 9, 2018\n\nVídeoreseña\n\n\"Why did you make only one of me? It's going to be lonely being me\"\n\nSirius is a genetically engineered dog that has been endowed with human intelligence by his maker, Thomas Trelone. Sirius’s story comes really close to that of Frankenstein’s monster, as he tells his many tribulations while trying to achieve a human-like life. Both characters share the same troubled mentality as they gradually find out that they don’t fit either as a human or as a member of their own species. Stapledon’s approach to this dilemma seems more thoughtful, covering themes like empathy, love, loneliness, and fear of the unknown. Don’t let the premise of a talking dog fool you into thinking this is a Disney-like story— while the main character is technically a talking animal, Stapledon does not overlook their own biology and impulses as such. Ultimately, ‘Sirius’ is a moving story that tries to answer the question of what it really means to be human.\n\nJune 28, 2024\n\nif you like this review i now have website: www.michaelkamakana.com\n\n060919: philosophical phantasy at its midcentury best, english version. following the life of one ‘super-super-sheepdog’ as created by cambridge scientist, cerebral, unique, lonely, fantastic. this is somewhat different than other stapledon work in that there are characters, primarily the dog ‘sirius’ and daughter of scientist ‘plaxy’... an interesting view of exactly what dogs would envy in mankind (hands) and of the difference in worlds sensed, smelled, seen, heard, thought, and of course satirical commentary in the best understated english manner. essentially polite, of its era or earlier, this is definitely more story told than shown: there are far more ideas than images, as sirius comes ‘to grips’ with existential questions not alone of dogs or humans but something of both, through science, through religion, but his tragedy is that despite how much he might be loved (in all unspoken ways...) by plaxy, there is finally no one with whom to share his perspective..."
