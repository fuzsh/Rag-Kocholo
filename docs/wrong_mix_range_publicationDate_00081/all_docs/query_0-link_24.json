        "text": "Some believe Sirius golf channel is awful on every level. Here is what I found:\n\nInside the Ropes: The Paulsons guys who are ex journeyman players, who must know someone\n\nStrengths - Have the perfect faces for radio\n\nWeaknesses - Old men trying to talk in todays young man slang about what they did over the weekend or doing that day and about their crappy careers. Is not good radio. Also, having as much command of the English language as a pair of 3rd graders, is brutal radio.\n\nMueller Report says - Turn off quickly. Delete from scan button immediately\n\nAttack Life: A radio show featuring Greg Norman lol ... oh my, nothing can go wrong here\n\nStrengths - Greg continues to put a capital N into narcissist, he never disappoints\n\nWeaknesses - Greg Norman talking\n\nMueller Report - Normally 1 second of listening to Greg Norman is too long. But if you are seeking a few laughs from this aging mentally ill nut job ... leave it on for 20 seconds. The guy is just whacked. Listening to static would be more entertaining.\n\nHank Haney Show ... PGA teaching pro and jilted ex-lover of Tiger, Hank Haney\n\nStrengths - Never ending criticism of the USGA. Show has potential, if he worked at it.\n\nWeaknesses - Many. The stammering delivery is bad for talk radio, work on it Hank. Repetitive topics for 3 hours day after day. Work at it Hank. And Hank simply cannot let go of Tiger dumping him. Plus pushing freaking Voodoo Cream every other minute wth is Voodoo Cream??\n\nMueller Report - Give it 10 minutes. Want to listen to show but HH seems to just be going through the motions. Some days, when the Tiger pain seems like it is too much for Hank ... he is like listening to BeeGee music all day long.\n\nOn the Fly with Mark Lye ... former PGA tour pro Mark Lye, really he was\n\nStrengths - None\n\nWeaknesses - Mark Lye has all the energy of a 20 year old hound dog\n\nMueller Report - Never listen. Unless someone is settling in for a nap, this show has no reason to be on air\n\nConnected with John Cook ... Tour pro and young golf savant John Cook\n\nStrengths - Cookie is a great guy and a pleasant listen. And he dated Bo Derek !\n\nWeaknesses - Little content, rarely on ... probably due to little content\n\nMueller Report - Give it 2 minutes. Cookie would be well served to talk about Bo Derek, otherwise stick to tv\n\nA New Breed of Golf ... former Golf Channel star Mike Breed\n\nStrengths - Best produced show. Content is good. And MB works at it and,of course, adds energy.\n\nWeaknesses - Repetitive ads, make it easy to switch off. Word of the day is junior highish and too much like that lame pretentious Matt Adams clown on TGC now. Also, tries to be too hip with the music genre ... Mike do you actually know who Luther Vondross is ? and taste of wine ... Mike do you even drink wine?\n\nMueller Report - Worth an hour. Effort is there. Could be a keeper if he stayed with his astute instruction and quit trying to be so hip.\n\nMornings with Marr ... TGC Dave Marr\n\nStrengths - True professional, great delivery. Likable guy\n\nWeaknesses - Needs energy. Dave is just much better on tv.\n\nMueller Report - Half hour. Dave pop a greenie or slam coffee or power drinks.\n\nI’am a Walrus ... Craig Stadler\n\nStrengths -Think the Walrus lost interest in doing the show\n\nWeaknesses -If Walrus starts doing the show again\n\nMueller Report - Hopefully Walrus is done doing the show\n\nFred Couples Show .... Fred Couples\n\nStrengths - Fred has the best guests. Musberger gambling bit was great. Scott Pippen was cool. Brought in a pro to do intros and outros, which helped a lot. Listening to Fred butcher the English language is sooo funny, most the time.\n\nWeaknesses - Listening to Fred butcher the English language all the time\n\nFred,being Fred, gets around to doing the show once every 6 months lol.\n\nMueller Report - Check in with Fred, see what he is up to. See who is guest.
