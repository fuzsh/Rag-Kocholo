        "text": "John P. Marquand (born November 10, 1893, Wilmington, Delaware, U.S.—died July 16, 1960, Newburyport, Massachusetts) was an American novelist who recorded the shifting patterns of middle- and upper-class American society in the mid-20th century.\n\nMarquand grew up in New York City and suburban Rye in comfortable circumstances until his father’s business failure, when he was sent to live with relatives in Newburyport. This experience of reduced status and security—sharpened by attending Harvard on a scholarship obtained by agreeing to study a subject he despised (chemistry)—made him acutely conscious of social gradations and their psychological corollaries."
