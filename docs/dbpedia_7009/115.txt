What is Wikipedia?

Wikipedia is an internet-based community project that harnesses the power of public, free, collective knowledge. Unlike traditional web pages designed purely for static content, Wikipedia operates on a wiki model, allowing users from around the globe to create and edit entries collaboratively. At the start of the company's history, founder Jimmy Wales envisioned Wikipedia as a space to facilitate creativity and collaborative knowledge. This dynamic platform has expanded significantly since its inception.

Behind the Encyclopedia: The Journey of Jimmy Wales

Jimmy Wales is known as as the wiki pioneer, leveraging wiki technology to revolutionize the way knowledge is shared online with Wikipedia, the world's largest encyclopedia.

Early Passion for Reading: From a young age, Wales was an avid reader. His mother's purchase of the World Book Encyclopedia when he was just three ignited a curiosity and reverence for comprehensive knowledge, setting the stage for his future endeavors in the world of encyclopedias.

Devotion to Education: After a Montessori-influenced early education, Wales transitioned to the Randolph School in Huntsville, a place he acknowledges was a stretch for his family's budget. However, it helped instill in him a passion for education and led him to graduate high school at sixteen.

Transition from Finance to the Web: Although Jimmy's initial academic pursuits led him to a bachelor's degree in finance from Auburn University, and even saw him taking courses in the Ph.D. finance program at Indiana University, it was the internet that truly captivated him. Deciding not to complete the doctoral dissertation required for a Ph.D., he shifted his focus. At the University of Alabama, Wales focused on web development and Internet fantasy games, laying the foundation for his subsequent digital ventures.

The Genesis of Wikipedia: In the early 2000s, Wales founded Nupedia, which was initially intended to be a free encyclopedia. However, it was the decision to create Wikipedia that allowed him to truly make his mark. Wikipedia began as a complementary project to Nupedia but quickly overshadowed it and changed the way information was consumed and shared globally.

Commitment to Ad-Free Knowledge: Jimmy's desire to ensure that Wikipedia remains free of advertisements showcases his commitment to providing unbiased, free knowledge to the world. Despite initial plans for Wikipedia to be a profitable business, Wales decided to operate it as a non-profit, ensuring its content remains uncolored by commercial interests.

Critique of Traditional Education Systems: Drawing from his personal experiences during his formative years, Jimmy has been an advocate for open and innovative educational models. He believes in reshaping traditional methodologies to better cater to the diverse needs of learners and to foster an environment of genuine curiosity and discovery.

3 Highlights from Jimmy's Augment Class

From setbacks to triumphs, Jimmy shares pivotal lessons from his entrepreneurial endeavors. Here are some highlights:

On Pivoting: "When you're an entrepreneur and you're trying to accomplish something, you'll have a lot of negative people around you — people who are skeptical. They want to know, 'Why is this going to work?' And you don't exactly know all the answers to why it's going to work. And so you're struggling, and sometimes you have to just persevere to believe in your vision and carry on forward. And then there are other times when you have to recognize that actually, this isn't working. Something fundamentally isn't right here. We do need to pivot. We need to make a big change."

On the Value of Failure: "A lot of times people's vision of what it's like to be an entrepreneur is tainted by some of the big-name stories that we've all heard about, because those people didn't necessarily have some early-on failures. But most entrepreneurs aren't like that. Most entrepreneurs go through a whole process of things that work, things that don't, and sort of bumble through and eventually learn enough that they find a formula that succeeds. I think if we're not prepared for failure, then it can be a crushing fear that prevents us from even getting started."

On the Power of Intrinsic Motivation: When thinking about the design of your business and the community around it, Jimmy says to place your focus on people's values. "Don't ignore the power of intrinsic motivation. If you can tap into people's values, you're really onto something magical. If you can combine the extrinsic motivation, good product, good price, with an intrinsic motivation of, 'I believe in this thing,' then you've got some magic."
