He previously ranked as one of TIME Magazine’s most influential people in the world and founded the free encyclopedia, Wikipedia, in 2001. Wikipedia is the fifth most visited website globally and counts half a billion unique visitors each month.\n\nAt the event, Jimmy discussed the threats to online knowledge-sharing and his mission to combat the rise of ‘fake news’ with evidence-based journalism via his new site WikiTRIBUNE.\n\nWikiTRIBUNE is a collaborative online news publication that allows professional journalists and volunteers to work side by side, co-researching and co-writing articles together. Mr Wales took selected questions from the audience via Twitter in a Q&A session at the end of his address, moderated by Irish Independent Technology Editor, Adrian Weckler.\n\nJimmy Wales keynote speech"
