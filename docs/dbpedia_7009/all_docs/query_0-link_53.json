        "text": "Wikipedia founder Jimmy Wales has insisted that the online encyclopedia is not \"woke\" as he battles a backlash from conservative critics across the West.\n\nIn an interview with the Telegraph, the 56-year-old entrepreneur said it is \"not true\" to suggest the website has become a standard bearer for left-wing causes.\n\nWales also took aim at the Government's controversial Online Safety Bill, warning that its attempt to make tech companies responsible for users' posts would \"Balkanise\" the internet and saying he would love to \"tear the whole [bill] up and start again\".\n\nThe web entrepreneur dismissed suggestions that he was personally interested in waging a culture war. He said: \"So, you know, I’m not particularly woke. I’m quite sleepy.”\n\nWikipedia – whose content is written by a community of unpaid editors – has repeatedly come under fire for alleged political bias.\n\nOpponents in the US have accused it of deliberately downplaying the importance of a story damaging to President Joe Biden about files on his son Hunter's laptop, as well as massaging economic news that was harmful to the Democrats.\n\nCritics have also accused it of acting as an echo chamber because it bans or limits the use of the right-wing Daily Mail and Fox News as sources.\n\nBut Wales insisted that these arguments are unfounded.\n\n“We do have a very long tradition of, you know, having respect for freedom of expression,” he said.\n\nFounding an information giant\n\nOne of Wales' formative experiences as a child, growing up in Alabama, was reading the World Book Encyclopedia, although he has previously described being struck by how much information was left out.\n\nAfter working in Chicago as a trader for two years, he quit to co-found the search engine Bomis – which, for a time, included a host of erotic content that could be accessed through what it described as \"the babe engine\".\n\nWales has always dismissed attempts to characterise him as a \"porn king\", and even edited his own Wikipedia page in 2005 to remove references to Bomis's history – something he later said he regretted doing.\n\nBomis was not, in the end, a success. However, it did provide money for his real passion, creating an online encyclopedia without the gaps from his childhood.\n\nIn Wales' first pass at this project, Nupedia, all articles were peer-reviewed by a panel of experts before publication. But he later hit on the idea of collaborative articles written by amateur members of the public, and Wikipedia was born.\n\nThat was 22 years ago now and the world has since become used to the risks posed by online misinformation on everything from global politics to Covid.\n\nBut despite his detractors, Wales still insists that his initial dream of an open-access source of free, impartial facts is in rude health.\n\nEven if the website were biased, he says, it is not up to the Government to intervene – hence his resistance to the Online Harms Bill, a flagship law currently making its way through Parliament.\n\n\"Being ‘woke’ or ‘advocating ideas that other people don't agree’ with is not something that the government really has any business getting involved with,\" he says, addressing Whitehall plans to make tech companies responsible for their users’ posts.\n\n\"If it were possible, let's tear the whole [bill] up and start again, that would be great.\"\n\nWales – who lives in London with his third wife Kate Garvey, Tony Blair's former diary secretary, after kindling a relationship with her at the World Economic Forum in Davos – is more recognisable than most tech bosses because of the frequency with which his face appears on Wikipedia's fundraising adverts.\n\nMost British internet users will have seen the charity-style pledges, rife with phrases such as \"the price of a cup of coffee is all we need.\"\n\n\"Jimbo\", as he is frequently called online, has nonetheless spent years insisting that he doesn’t directly control the Wikipedia website despite being front and centre of its fundraising campaigns.\n\nIn reality, its owner the Wikimedia Foundation sits on an $86m (£71m) cash pile, as disclosed in its latest annual report. If the donations stopped dead today Wikipedia could keep going for another 18 months without needing to raise a finger.\n\nWales himself – who is the foundation's chief executive – has always insisted he hasn’t become rich from the site. Neither Bloomberg nor Forbes magazine list him among Big Tech’s well-heeled winners, and he doesn’t make the cut for the Sunday Times Rich List either.\n\nInternet faces 'balkanisation'\n\nWhether or not one accepts (and Wales doesn’t) that Wikipedia may have to start collecting its users’ identities to comply with Whitehall’s demands, there is no denying its influence on today’s connected world.\n\nThe Wikimedia Endowment Fund, the site’s US-based charitable donations arm, says the online encyclopaedia hosts 57m articles written in 310 languages.\n\nThose pages sit at the top of online searches for everything from aardvarks to Z (“a 1969 Algerian political-thriller film”).\n\nArtificial intelligence scientists regularly copy the entire thing for training chatbots such as ChatGPT. More devious computer scientists are already proposing ways of “poisoning” Wikipedia to give undue influence to whatever name, topic or product one might want to promote.\n\nThis influence comes with substantial flows of money. During the latest year for which accounts are available, Wikipedia’s corporate arm received $153m (£126m) in donations while spending $67m of that on salaries and wages.\n\nThe $86m net cash position is an increase of 17pc ($15m) from the year 2020. In business terms, Wikipedia is in rude health.\n\nAll of that is far from Wales’ mind as he sits in London’s Queen Elizabeth conference centre, though, holding forth about Whitehall regulations in a shirt better suited to a Caribbean beach - a firm nod to the audience of non-conformist software developers he’s just addressed.\n\nSpeaking at OpenUK’s State of Open conference in London earlier this month, the encyclopaedia’s boss warned that the Online Safety Bill was a “very clumsy sort of attempt to do some positive regulation” that risks splintering apart the fabric of the World Wide Web.\n\nEven as he picks his phone up after dropping it during our interview, having been idly fiddling with the handset while holding forth, he gives no quarter to the Government.\n\n“And so we see, increasingly, a Balkanisation of the internet that's only going to get worse as more and more countries and jurisdictions around the world decide to start imposing their own idiosyncratic rules,” says Wales, whose website is one of the top ten destinations online, with more than 10 billion visits from Britons alone every year.\n\nBalkanisation refers to the splitting of countries into new nations along ethnic and religious lines, as happened during the breakup of Yugoslavia after the Soviet Union’s 1991 collapse. It’s this walling-off of parts of the internet, a sort of Westernised version of China’s infamous Great Firewall censorship engine, that Wales is anxious about.\n\nHowever, Wikipedia itself is often a lightning rod for criticism because of its stance on the big issues of the day – or, more accurately, the stance of its legions of editors, who critics routinely label as armchair keyboard warriors with a left-wing viewpoint that colours everything they write.\n\nThe Hunter Biden saga\n\nThe website’s two-decade history is littered with accusations of selectivity, as meticulously chronicled through the “talk” sections of its articles.\n\nOne recent snapshot showing the depth of feeling over how Wikipedia reflects the world was how the site’s users chose to write about the Hunter Biden laptop saga, a piece of American political intrigue that forced Big Tech’s moderation policies into the limelight.\n\nAccording to online theories, Hunter, the US President’s 53-year-old son, allegedly became a subject of interest in a Ukrainian anti-corruption investigation led by the country’s then-attorney general, Viktor Shokin.\n\nThe theory goes that around a decade ago, during his days as Barack Obama’s vice president, Joe Biden threatened to cancel a $1bn loan guarantee extended to Ukraine unless Shokin’s investigation was dropped.\n\nThis “inside baseball” piece of American political folklore – roundly denied by those involved – was largely ignored until an explosive story published by the New York Post in the days before the 2020 US presidential election.\n\nCiting emails discovered on Hunter Biden’s laptop that it had seen, the US tabloid suggested the future president had met a Ukrainian lobbyist after being introduced by Hunter.\n\nPreviously, the Bidens had always insisted that Joe never discussed overseas business dealings with Hunter. If the emails were true, the Post had uncovered evidence of a US presidential election candidate telling a clear untruth.\n\nLeft wing commentators and news outlets were instantly dismissive of the story. Citing a risk of election interference, America’s Big Tech companies responded to the New York Post by blocking links to its story from being shared, including on Twitter and Facebook.\n\nWikipedia was just as infuriated about the laptop allegations as the US Democratic Party’s staffers.\n\nIts users marked the site’s entry about the controversy for deletion, claiming it wasn’t notable enough to bother including.\n\nElon Musk, who bought Twitter for $44bn (£36bn) last year, tweeted at Wales to complain that the website exposed its own “non-trivial left-wing bias” in its handling of the laptop scandal saga.\n\nWales told the OpenUK conference in London that, at the time the scandal broke, “an internal editorial decision” was made - “not about whether to have information, but where it should be” on the site.\n\n\"The Wikimedia Foundation doesn't get involved at all\" in content decisions, he insists, adding: \"You'll be very hard pressed to find anyone [at Wikipedia’s parent company] saying 'this is damaging to Joe Biden, therefore we shouldn't have it'.\"\n\nBut the Hunter Biden laptop saga isn’t the only political scandal Wikipedia has faced.\n\nOne of the most compelling critics of the project's agenda is Larry Sanger, Wales’ co-founder, who left Wikipedia two years after helping set it up and has claimed that it is only welcoming to \"essentially people who agree with the establishment Left.\"\n\n\"You can’t cite the Daily Mail at all. You can’t cite Fox News on socio-political issues either. It’s banned. So what does that mean? It means that if a controversy does not appear in the mainstream centre-Left media, then it’s not going to appear on Wikipedia,\" Sanger told the Unherd website.\n\nFighting disinformation\n\nControversy over Wikipedia erupted afresh last summer when US Democrat activists swarmed onto the website’s entry for “recession” to delete references suggesting Joe Biden’s economic policies had tipped the US into one.\n\nA frenzy of 47 edits were made during just one day as a group of users repeatedly tried to write that there was “no global consensus on the definition of recession”, echoing White House political messaging that sought to downplay the fact that Biden had presided over two consecutive quarters of economic contraction.\n\nThe site has also been a battleground over Covid, with supporters of lockdowns accused of policing and removing legitimate counter-arguments.\n\nForthright and unafraid, Wales says \"our community is fiercely strong against Covid disinformation\" and sniffs at the idea of Wikipedia including \"crackpot information\".\n\nBut he concedes that picking between \"legitimate scientific debate\" and baseless nonsense is \"a fuzzy line\" – for example, on the issues of how to cover the tiny number of severe allergic reactions that are genuinely caused by Covid vaccines.\n\n\"You have to sort of say, actually, there is a phenomenon of vaccine injury, and there are side effects sometimes,\" he says.\n\n\"How do we talk about that? Right now, the community does all that debating.\"\n\nIn Wales' view, the answer to this challenge is to find more users. Actively increasing the number of people writing things on his website is part of a natural drift towards a sort of neutral perfection, where people step in to provide moderating counterpoints to heated views expressed by others.\n\n'Politically disastrous' to block Wikipedia\n\nInevitably, this laissez-faire approach conflicts with the Government's attempt to regulate internet companies and enforce rules about what can, and cannot, be posted online.\n\nAsked what would happen if the Online Safety Bill forced the Wikimedia Foundation to start proactively monitoring Wikipedia and its users to comply with new British regulations, Wales says: \"We would just refuse to do that and they can block us if they want to.\n\n\"But that's not going to happen, that'd be insane and we're not worried about it.\"\n\nHe adds: \"Oh, and we were also blocked in Pakistan, like a week ago, very briefly, and then the prime minister told the regulator ‘knock it off’ because everybody went crazy. Which by the way, is probably what would happen here.\n\n\"If Ofcom ordered something ridiculous [like blocking Wikipedia] I think it would be politically disastrous.\"\n\nOfcom will become Britain’s new internet and social media regulator if the Online Safety Bill passes through Parliament in its current form.\n\nA spokesman for the regulator says: \"When it comes to regulatory oversight, Ofcom has significant experience of operating as an impartial and independent regulator. We will have a range of regulatory tools that we’ll use in a proportionate way to help create a safer life online, while protecting freedom of expression.\"\n\nGraham Smith, lawyer and author of the textbook “Internet Law and Regulation” and a longstanding critic of the Online Safety Bill, thinks Ofcom could be drawn into the politics of any fight over online content regulation, just as Wales warns.\n\n\"As the Bill currently stands, if the Secretary of State did not approve of Ofcom’s recommendation for public policy reasons they could send the draft Code of Practice back to Ofcom to with a direction to modify it – and, it seems, keep on doing so until she was happy with its contents,\" says Smith in an online commentary about the bill.\n\n\"Even if that controversial power of direction were removed from the bill, Ofcom would still have significant day to day power to adopt interpretations of the law and apply them to [social media websites’] decision-making.\"\n\nWales himself is scornful of the likely impact of the bill, saying that its \"think of the children\" messaging obscures its wide scope and reach – and the effects it will have on areas of the internet that few would link with online child safety.\n\nThe most visible of those rules is likely to be age verification: checking that people visiting websites with adult content are adults. With Wikipedia’s entries including sexually explicit and offensive material – just as any dictionary or printed encyclopaedia does – it seems likely these provisions will apply to the site.\n\nIts founder is concerned by that suggestion, which could add substantial costs to its overheads.\n\n\"[Then-culture Secretary] Michelle Donelan did a video question-and-answer session and assured the public that the age gating requirement will not apply to Wikipedia,\" says Wales.\n\n\"So kids won't have to prove their age or be banned from reading Wikipedia for their homework, except that there's nothing actually in the bill that would suggest that that conclusion is correct.\n\n\"And so while it's nice to have assurance from the minister, that that isn't what the bill says.\"\n\nA government spokesman said: \"The world-leading Online Safety Bill has been designed to strike the balance between tackling harm and not imposing unnecessary burdens on tech companies posing a low risk to users' safety.\n\n\"Ofcom will take a reasonable and proportionate approach to monitoring and enforcing the duties in the Bill and focus on services where the risk of harm is highest.\"\n\nControversies unlikely to go away\n\nWhen asked if Wikipedia couldn’t just shrug off the cost of compliance with the Online Safety Bill by hiring moderators – spending some of the $86m it has in the bank – Wales waves a dismissive hand.\n\n\"It's about the fundamentals of how it all works,\" he says with a frown. \"I suspect that as compared to many small message boards, or hobby websites and things like that, then yes, of course, we can afford things.\"\n\nWarming to his theme, he adds: \"I don't think anybody would say it's a good idea to set up a regulatory regime which reinforces the power of the larger players at the expense of smaller players.\"\n\nHere, perhaps, is a nod to the truth about Wikipedia. If the internet is divided into the large and the small, it is a big beast – one whose attitude to the world has the power to shape events as well as chronicling them.\n\nWales, the man who adorns the adverts, may resist accusations that his creation is \"woke\". But as long as it is where the public goes for information, the controversies over the site – and who is in control of its content – will never go away."
