        "text": "We've all been told not to trust Wikipedia, external for essays, homework and life in general.\n\nBut Jimmy Wales, the site's founder, has told Newsbeat it is \"comparable to traditional encyclopedias\".\n\n\"It's not perfect but it's pretty good and improving all the time,\" he added.\n\nHowever, like many before him Wales added that it was best for \"background research\" saying \"as long as they're not copying and pasting, they're probably alright\".\n\nSo can you really trust the site? Newsbeat put listener questions, and a few of our own, to Mr Wales to try to find out.\n\nWe asked, 'Why don't you stop the function that allows people to edit?'\n\nWales said: \"Wikipedia gets better through participation [people editing inaccurate information].\n\n\"We really benefit from anyone being able to spot an error, coming in and saying, 'Hey this is incorrect'.\n\n\"That kind of open dialogue, the democratic debate and discussion, is really what makes Wikipedia work.\"\n\n\"I don't approve of that. I think that most of the time when people do it, in addition to being rude and vandalism, it's actually not very funny, so in general it is something we do try to discourage.\n\n\"If you wanna do something for your friends, click at it, make the funny change and just hit the preview button and just take a screenshot of that and you don't have to bother the rest of the world with your joke.\"\n\n\"It has become part of the infrastructure of university education as students turn to it to get themselves orientated in the subject or to do background research on a subject.\n\n\"One of the things you should look out for is if 'the Wikipedians' have written 'the following section does not cite any sources' or 'the neutrality of this article is disputed'.\n\n\"Those kind of warning signs, take really seriously.\n\n\"If anything seems fishy or even if it doesn't seem fishy, you should read Wikipedia and then click and follow through and give the references and make sure that Wikipedia reflects what the references say and if it doesn't, you can fix it.\""
