        "text": "GENEVA, Switzerland -- Jimmy Wales has a message for Hollywood: You're doomed, it won't be piracy that kills you, and nobody will care.\n\nThe Wikipedia founder, delivering a keynote address at the Internet Society's INET convention in Geneva, predicted that Hollywood will likely share the same fate as Encyclopedia Britannica, which shut down its print operation this year after selling just 3,000 copies last year.\n\n\"Hollywood will be destroyed and no one will notice,\" Wales said. But it won't be Wikipedia (or Encarta) that kills the moviemaking industry: \"Collaborative storytelling and filmmaking will do to Hollywood what Wikipedia did to Encyclopedia Britannica,\" he said.\n\nWales hedged by saying predictions are easy — and he's usually wrong. But he looks at a generation of kids growing up in a world of video and mastering editing software at a young age. His own 12-year-old daughter, Wales said, is already adept at iMovie and won a local award for a short film she made.\n\nAnd just as Wikipedia has show that collaboration on the web is possible (despite the messiness, flame wars and turf battles found on Wikipedia Talk pages), the new generation will find ways to collaborate online to create movies to entertain themselves and their friends.\n\nAnd, Wales says, they'll do that with impressive special effects, CGI and even remote actors.\n\nBut telling a story and building a feature-length film collaboratively is much different and much harder than collectively adding verifiable facts to a Wikipedia entry. So it's unlikely that Hollywood's going to pay much attention to Wales' prognostication. Which means if the next generation turns out to find away to creating the next Titanic on a $5,000 budget, Hollywood won't even see the blow coming.\n\nEVs Are Losing Up to 50 Percent of Their Value in One Year\n\nSome electric car brands are hemorrhaging value, with the worst losing as much as $600 a day. In this investigation, WIRED outlines which models to watch, why this is happening, and how you can game the market to your advantage.\n\nThe 2025 Ford Maverick Shows That Hybrid Pickup Trucks Are Going Mainstream\n\nJust as Tesla ditches its $60,000 Cybertruck, Ford finally allows buyers to pair its efficient hybrid powertrain with all-wheel drive and a towing package. Hallelujah.\n\nGoogle Has Unleashed Its Legal Fury on Hackers and Scammers\n\nThe tech giant says its “affirmative litigation” deters and raises awareness of bad behavior. Skeptics wonder whether these suits are too small a gesture.\n\nI Used ChatGPT’s Advanced Voice Mode. It’s Fun, and Just a Bit Creepy\n\nThe new voice feature from OpenAI for ChatGPT is often entertaining and will even do a Trump impression. It likely rolls out to all paid users this fall.\n\nElon Musk Is No Climate Hero\n\nDuring a live interview with Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump, the former president literally said, “Drill, baby, drill.” Musk met the statement with … silence.\n\nThe Olympics' Hostile Architecture Is a Preview of What's to Come\n\nUnder a bridge in Paris, a homeless encampment has been replaced with dozens of giant Lego-like bricks. Campaigners say things will likely get worse at the 2028 Games in LA.\n\nThis Code Breaker Is Using AI to Decode the Heart’s Secret Rhythms\n\nInspired by his expertise in breaking ancient codes, Roeland Decorte built a smartphone app that continuously listens for signs of disease hidden in our pulse.\n\nFortnite Maker Epic Games Challenges Apple’s Dominance With New iOS App Store\n\nThe Epic Games Store gives iPhone users in the EU an alternative to Apple’s App Store for the first time."
