Tomb of Akbar the Great in Sikandra, Agra (must see)

In the western suburbs of Agra lies Sikandra town that is famous for housing the mausoleum of Emperor Akbar. The Tomb of Akbar the Great is an important Mughal architectural masterpiece, built 1605–1613, set in 48 ha (119 acres) of grounds. It is a sizable complex of finest architectural structures as minarets, towers, gates and the tomb building, most of them being built with red stone and white marble. Panel designs are geometric, floral and calligraphic, and prefigure the more complex and subtle designs later incorporated in Itimâd-ud-Daulâ's Tomb.

The third Mughal Emperor Akbar the Great (1555–1605), himself commenced its construction in around 1600, according to Tartary tradition to commence the construction of one's tomb during one's lifetime. Akbar himself planned his own tomb and selected a suitable site for it. After his death, Akbar's son Jahangir completed the construction in 1605-1613. Akbar was one of the greatest emperors of his time.
