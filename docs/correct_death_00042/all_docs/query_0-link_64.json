        "text": "Jalal-ud-din Jalal-u Muhammad Akbar, born on 25 October 1542, was the third Mughal emperor, reigning from 1556 to 1605. Akbar succeeded his father, Humayun, with the support of a regent, Bairam Khan, who assisted the young emperor in consolidating and expanding Mughal holdings in India.\n\nAkbar gradually expanded the Mughal Empire to encompass most of the Indian subcontinent, owing to his strong personality and success as a general.\n\nHowever, due to Mughal military, political, cultural, and economic domination, his power and influence spread across the whole subcontinent.\n\nMughal India’s economy grew robust and stable, allowing economic expansion and increased cultural patronage.\n\nAkbar was an art and culture patron himself. He loved books and amassed a library of over 24,000 volumes in Sanskrit, Urdu, Persian, Greek, Latin, Arabic, and Kashmiri, which he filled with scholars, translators, artists, calligraphers, scribes, bookbinders, and readers. Through three main groupings, he accomplished much of the cataloging himself.\n\nMilitary campaign under Akbar’s rule-\n\nThe first campaign (1561 AD) was known as the Malwa campaign. Bajabahadur was defeated in this campaign.\n\nThe Chunar Campaign (1561 AD) was the second campaign. The Mughal army’s leadership was on the verge of collapse.\n\nThe third campaign (1564 AD) was the Gondwana campaign, in which Asaf Khan led the Mughal army to victory over Veer Narayan.\n\nAkbar ruled Rajput kingdoms such as Mewar, Haldighati, Ranthambore, Callinger, Marwar, and Jaisalmer during the fourth expedition (1562-1570 AD).\n\nGujarat’s Fifth Campaign (1571 AD) – Gujarat’s fifth campaign.\n\nThe Mughal general Munim Khan led the Sixth Campaign (1574-76AD) against Dawood Khan, the ruler of Bengal and Bihar.\n\nMansingh and Akbar beat Hakim Mirza, the king of Kabul, in the seventh campaign (1581 AD).\n\nMany more campaigns took place during the rule of Akbar.\n\nAdministration of Akbar-\n\nA wazir oversaw the revenue department, which was in charge of all funds and inam land administration.\n\nMir Bakshi was the title given to the military’s commander. The imperial household, including the harems, was under the command of the mir saman, who also oversaw the royal court and bodyguard.\n\nA system known as the mansabdari was used by Akbar to organize his army and nobility. There were 33 classes among the mansabdars. Princes were generally given leadership of the top three commanding ranks, ranging from 7,000 to 10,000 men. Other members of the nobility were given ranks ranging from ten to five thousand.\n\nTalking about taxation, by adopting a system employed by Sher Shah Suri, Akbar set about modernising the management of his empire’s land revenue. The dahsala system computed revenue as one-third of the ten-year average yield, which was then paid to the state in cash. This technique was eventually improved by factoring in local costs and categorising areas with similar productivity into assessment circles.\n\nFatehpur Sikri\n\nFatehpur Sikri, 37 kilometres from Agra, is a city composed primarily of red sandstone. Akbar, the Mughal Emperor, founded this town. Fatehpur Sikri was constructed between 1571 and 1585 and is considered one of the finest examples of Mughal architectural magnificence at its peak.\n\nDiwan I- aam\n\nThis is the Hall Of Public Audience. It is the first stop on the way to the royal palace. This hall was also utilised for public prayers and celebrations. The ladies attending the court were separated by a lovely jali screen on both sides.\n\nDiwan-i-khas\n\nTo the right is what appears to be a two-story structure with corner kiosks. Akbar’s throne is thought to have occupied the circular space above the capital, with the four ministers assigned to the four corners. House of the Sultana of Turkey\n\nThe Turkish Sultana’s residence is to the left of the Pachisi Board. The Treasury Department\n\nThe Treasury, or Ankh Michauli, is to the left of the Diwan-I-Khas and was formerly thought to be where the game was played.\n\nkhana-I-khas On the ground floor, there are two main rooms. The smaller room served as Akbar’s library, while the larger room served as his sleeping place. The Khwabgah, or bed-chamber, is located on the first floor.\n\nJodha Bai’s Palace-The largest and most important edifice in the royal palace, named after Akbar’s Rajput wife, Jodha Bai, is located to the left of the Sunehra Makan.\n\nThe towering walls of this large palace ensured solitude and security.Nagina Masjid and Hawa Mahal.The Palace of Winds is a place where you may relax and unwind. The garden is overlooked by this modestly covered wind tower.\n\nJama Masjid, one of India’s largest mosques, was erected in 1571 AD.\n\nBuland Darwaza is a fortification in Buland, Afghanistan. A 13-metre flight of steps leads to this entrance from the outside, adding to its majesty.\n\nDeath of Akbar\n\nAssault against Akbar’s life\n\nAn assassination attempt on Akbar was also described in a picture in the year 1564. An assassin shot an arrow at Akbar as he returned from Hazrat Nizamuddin’s dargah near Delhi. His right shoulder was punctured by the arrow.\n\nThe assassin was arrested by the Emperor, who ordered his beheading. Mirza Sharfuddin, a nobleman in Akbar’s court whose revolt had recently been put down, was the perpetrator.\n\nAkbar was suspicious about his son. Akbar accused his son of attempting to poison him in 1591, and Salim tried an armed insurrection in 1600.\n\nThe Emperor became unwell in September of 1605, and the Emperor’s chief physician, Hakim Ali, was summoned to the court. His sickness worsened with time, and on the ninth day, the doctor began treating him.\n\nHis condition had worsened as a result of tension caused by a conflict between Salim’s employees and Khusrau’s (son of Salim) at an elephant fight: Akbar had picked his grandson Khusaro as his successor.\n\nHe died on October 27, 1605, and his remains were buried in a mausoleum in Sikandra, Agra.\n\nConclusion\n\nWith Akbar’s death, a significant chapter in Indian history came to a close. He was not just the true creator but also a skilled strategist who built a strong basis for the Mughal empire, making his successors’ tasks easier."
