        "text": "Known as the “City of Victory” after Emperor Akbar’s conquest of Gujarat in 1573, Fatehpur Sikri was the capital of the Mughal Empire from 1571 to 1585, until its abandonment in 1610 shortly after Akbar’s death. The abandoned Mughal capital makes a great side trip from Agra, where tourists from all over the world flocked to visit probably the most famous attraction in India, the Taj Mahal. Inscribed in UNESCO World Heritage in 1986, the red-sandstone capital is considered an Indo-Islamic architectural masterpiece. It is also one of the biggest tourist attractions in India.\n\nIt was almost 4pm when we arrived at the huge parking lot of Fatehpur Sikri. From there, we had to hop on a shuttle bus for a 5-minute ride to the main entrance of the historical site. The sun was already quite low. The red sandstone buildings were very photogenic under the late afternoon sun. However, our visit was quite rush as we only had a bit over an hour to appreciate the historical site.\n\nWith four distinctive chhatris on the top, the Diwan-i-khas or Hall of Private Audience was the first building that caught our eyes as we entered the complex.\n\nEmperor Akbar’s Throne Pillar in the Diwan-i-khas contains motifs of Hinduism, Buddhism, Islam and Christianity, aiming to incorporate all religions into one for his empire.\n\nTansen Musical Pond at the centre of Fatehpur Sikri was famous for the platform designated for the legendary musician Tansen.\n\nThe green pond provided a pleasant contrast to the red sandstone architecture.\n\nPanorama of Tansen musician pond.\n\nSurrounded by a verandah, the Turkish Sultana’s House is an highly ornate building. Both the interiors and exteriors are beautifully carved with motifs. The house is believed to be the residence of the Turkish Queen Sultana.\n\nThe Turkish Sultana’s House is full of intricate carved motifs.\n\nEvery single inch of the building is ornately carved.\n\nWith influences from Hindu and Muslim cultures, the buildings of Fatehpur Sikri showcase some of the best examples of Mughal architecture.\n\nThe well preserved Fatehpur Sikri looked like a large empty shell made with red sandstone.\n\nThe structural skeleton of the buildings looked neat and surreal.\n\nChhatris, the elevated, dome shaped pavilions, are commonly found in traditional Indian architecture. They serve mainly for decorative purpose.\n\nBuilt in 1571, the Birbal’s House accommodated the two senior queens of Emperor Akbar.\n\nBeyond the Birbal’s House, we reached the long colonnade of the Lower Haramsara.\n\nThe colonnade of the Lower Haramsara.\n\nMany historians believe the Lower Haramsara was used as a stable for camels and horses.\n\nAdjacent to the Lower Haramsara is the Jodha Bai Palace, the complex constructed for the Hindu queen. Hindu motifs such as lotus flowers and elephants could be found at the magnificent Jodha Bai Palace.\n\nA pleasant courtyard can be found at the centre of Jodha Bai Palace. For security purpose, only one single guarded entrance was provided for the complex back in the old days.\n\nWe exited from the main entrance of Jodh Bai’s palace to find our way towards Jama Masjid, the famous Friday Mosque of Fatehpur Sikri.\n\n***\n\nPosts on 2018 Rajasthan:-\n\nDay 1: Jodhpur\n\nDAY 1.1: IN TRANSIT TO RAJASTHAN\n\nDAY 1.2: PAL HAVELI & THE OMELETTE MAN, Jodhpur\n\nDAY 1.3: SPLENDOR OF THE SUN FORT, Mehrangarh, Jodhpur\n\nDAY 1.4: SUNSET OVER THE BLUE CITY, Mehrangarh, Jodhpur\n\nDAY 1.5: SADAR MARKET AND GHANTA GHAR CLOCKTOWER, Jodhpur\n\nDay 2: Jodhpur, Osian, Jaisalmer\n\nDAY 2.1: MARBLE CENOTAPH JASWANT THADA, Jodhpur\n\nDAY 2.2: MEDIEVAL STEPWELLS, Mahila Bagh Ka Jhalra, Gulab Sagar, & Toorji Ka Jhalra, Jodhpur\n\nDAY 2.3: PILGRIM OASIS IN THAR DESERT, Sachiya Mata Temple, Osian\n\nDAY 2.4: SUNRISE AT THE FIRST GATE OF GOLDEN FORT, Jaisalmer\n\nDay 3: Jaisalmer\n\nDAY 3.1: THE GOLDEN LIVING FORT, Jaisalmer\n\nDAY 3.2: JAIN TEMPLES PART 1, Jaisalmer\n\nDAY 3.3: JAIN TEMPLES PART 2, Jaisalmer\n\nDAY 3.4: FORT PALACE, Jaisalmer\n\nDay 4: Jaisalmer\n\nDAY 4.1: RESERVOIR OF THE GOLDEN CITY, Gadsisar Lake, Jaisalmer\n\nDAY 4.2: ARCHITECTURAL JEWEL OF RAJASTHAN, Patwon Ki Haveli Part 1, Jaisalmer\n\nDAY 4.3: ARCHITECTURAL JEWEL OF RAJASTHAN, Patwon Ki Haveli Part 2, Jaisalmer\n\nDAY 4.4: DESERT HERITAGE, Hotel Nachana Haveli and Thar Heritage Museum, Jaisalmer\n\nDAY 4.5: LAST STROLL IN THE GOLDEN CITY, Jaisalmer\n\nDay 5: Pushkar\n\nDAY 5.1: RANIKHET EXPRESS\n\nDAY 5.2: 52 BATHING GHATS, Pushkar\n\nDAY 5.3: SUNSET OVER SACRED WATER, Pushkar\n\nDay 6: Pushkar & Jaipur\n\nDAY 6.1: SUNRISE OVER PUSHKAR LAKE, Pushkar\n\nDAY 6.2: GRANDEUR OF THE MAHARAJA, City Palace, Jaipur\n\nDAY 6.3: IN SEARCH OF 1860 CARL ZEISS CAMERA, Jaipur\n\nDay 7: Jaipur\n\nDAY 7.1: AMBER FORT, Jaipur\n\nDAY 7.2: JAIGARH FORT, Jaipur\n\nDAY 7.3: MAHARAJA’S ASTRONOMICAL LEGACY, Jantar Mantar, Jaipur\n\nDAY 7.4: PALACE OF WINDS, Hawa Mahal, Jaipur\n\nDay 8: Bhangarh, Abhaneri & Agra\n\nDAY 8.1: ON THR ROAD TO AGRA\n\nDAY 8.2: HAUNTED RUINS, Bhangarh, Rajasthan\n\nDAY 8.3: CHAND BAORI, Abhaneri, Rajasthan\n\nDAY 8.4: THE ABANDONED CAPITAL OF MUGHAL EMPIRE, Fatehpur Sikri, Agra, Uttar Pradesh\n\nDAY 8.5: FRIDAY MOSQUE, Fatehpur Sikri, Agra, Uttar Pradesh\n\nDay 9: Agra\n\nDAY 9.1: CROWN OF THE PALACES, Taj Mahal, Agra, Uttar Pradesh\n\nDAY 9.2: AGRA FORT, Agra, Uttar Pradesh\n\nDAY 9.3: RAWATPARA SPICE MARKET, Agra, Uttar Pradesh\n\nDAY 9.4: SUNSET AT MEHTAB BAGH, Agra, Uttar Pradesh"
