        "text": "A Glimpse into the Future of India\n\nWhen Ibn Battuta returned to India, Muhammad Tughluq had gone out battling more rebels in the north. There he would die of illness in 1351, only a couple of years after Ibn Battuta passed through India on his way back home. The Delhi Sultanate was reduced to a small northern state while the south was a patchwork of small Muslim and Hindu kingdoms battling each other.\n\nThe sultanate became so weak that in 1398, a Mongol-descended group, under the leadership of Timur (Tamerlane), mercilessly sacked and plundered Delhi.\n\nIt wouldn't be until the early 16th century that a Muslim leader would unite most of southern and central India into the Mughal Empire (Persian for \"Mongol Empire\") .\n\nThe Mughal Dynasty was a line of Muslim emperors who reigned in India from 1526 to 1858. Babur, the first Mughal emperor, was a descendant of the Turkish conqueror Timur on his father's side and of the Mongol conqueror Genghis Khan on his mother's side. He invaded India from Afghanistan and founded the Mughal Empire on the ruin of the Delhi Sultanate.\n\nOn to Syria\n\nIbn Battuta returned to Baghdad and from there crossed over the Syrian Desert on the camel route. At last he arrived in Damascus in the winter of 1348. There he heard from caravan traders that his father had died fifteen years before. He also learned that a son he had never met had died at the age of ten.\n\nHe next went to Aleppo for a few months as a tourist. Here he saw the citadel, an outstanding example of Arab military architecture. It stands atop a hill for defense and has massive stone walls. Aleppo was the northern capital of Syria.\n\nTwo views of the Aleppo citadel: from the front, looking up and from the top, looking down.\n\nSource: By Memorino and Bernard Gagnon [CC BY-SA 3.0], via Wikimedia Commons\n\nBubonic Plague\n\nIbn Battuta's account is engaging in many ways, but one significant point of interest is the fact that his return trip coincided with the spread of the bubonic plague from Central Asia to the Mediterranean and into Europe and North Africa.\n\nAs Ibn Battuta rode through Syria, a terrible disease was descending upon his world. This was the Black Death (or bubonic plague). He first tried to out-run it, but each city he reached was in the middle of a terrible outbreak. In Damascus the death toll was 2,000 people a day! The business of the city had come to a halt. The people begged God for the plague to stop.\n\n\"The people fasted for three successive days... [Then all the people] assembled in the Great mosque until it was filled to overflowing... and spent the night there in prayers... Then, after performing the dawn prayer..., they all went out [barefoot] together... carrying Korans in their hands. The entire population of the city joined... The Jews went out with their book of the law and the Christians with the Gospel... [all] of them in tears . . . imploring the favor of God through His Books and His Prophets.\" [Gibb, p. 143-144]\n\nThe Black Death had started in the early 1330s, before Ibn Battuta reached China. It began in the grasslands of Central Asia and spread eastward in to China and westward across Asia to the Black Sea. The plague is found in rodents like ground squirrels and rats, but it is spread to humans through the bite of a flea living on infected rodents. Drought in Central Asia may have pushed infected rodents into closer contact with humans. Their infected fleas then found their way into the wagon trains and storerooms of caravanserai. The disease spread rapidly as people tried to escape along the trade routes of the steppe. The same Mongol empire that encouraged travelers like Ibn Battuta and Marco Polo, also quickened the progress of the plague across Eurasia between China and the distant Atlantic Coast.\n\nItalian ships carried infected rats and fleas in their cargo to Constantinople, Venice, and Genoa. The plague reached Sicily and Egypt in 1347. One Egyptian historian tells of a ship: out of a total of 332 on board, only 45 arrived at the port of Cairo alive. All of those who had survived died soon after in the port. [Dols, The Black Death in the Middle East, p. 69]\n\nFrom the sea ports, caravans transmitted the disease throughout Europe, northern Africa, and the Middle East. Estimates of the death tolls vary between 1/2 to 1/3 of the populations. At the other end of Eurasia in China the outbreaks of the plague caused massive death rates and economic chaos, and contributed to the collapse of the Mongol (Yuan) Dynasty.\n\nA Note about the Black Death and \"Plague\" Images Online\n\nMistaken information travels quickly on the internet. A good example of this problem is images that are said to depict bubonic plague. The \"Disease and Landscape in Medieval and Early Modern Europe\" episode of The Ottoman History Podcast takes on several common examples of images that have been widely and erroneously used as images of bubonic plague. Begin listening at 32:30 for this discussion of mis-used imagery and see their website to get a look at the pictures in question.\n\nOn to Cairo and Mecca\n\nEven with the threat of the Plague, Ibn Battuta continued on to Palestine and over to Cairo where the toll was still rising. (He tells us that the death toll will reach twenty-four thousand in a day in Cairo!) Then he went up the Nile where the plague had not yet started. Crossing the Red Sea he arrived at Jidda, and continued on to Mecca. He stayed in Mecca for more than four months. The plague raged in Mecca, too, brought by the caravans.\n\nHome to Morocco\n\nWith death all around him, perhaps he felt the need to go home. He was 45 years old and had been gone for 24 years. He again headed west back toward Morocco. \"I was moved [to go back] by memories of my homeland, affection for my family and dear friends, who drew me toward my land, which, in my opinion, was better than any other country.\"\n\nHe left Egypt on a small ship and went to Tunisia where he then traveled overland. He made a brief trip to the Christian lands of Sardinia, but he heard rumors that the people there were pirates who would hold him for ransom. So he left immediately.\n\nAfter ten days at sea he arrived at Tenes. From there he went overland to Morocco. Here he learned that his mother had died only several months earlier. Had she heard from travelers that her long-departed son was on his way home? He arrived in his family's home of Tangier and visited his mother's grave. He met with friends and family and shared his tales of his travels to all parts of Dar al-Islam.\n\nBut restless again after only a few days, he decided to go to the nearby harbor city of Ceuta. He was already thinking about making another trip."
