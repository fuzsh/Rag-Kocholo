        "text": "28 October 1627\n\nDeath of Mughal Emperor Jahangir\n\nWhat happened?\n\nOn 28 October 1627, Mughal Emperor and son of Akbar, Jahangir died at Rajauri, Kashmir.\n\nAspirants can find information on the structure and other important details related to the IAS Exam, in the linked article.\n\nAspirants should begin their preparation by solving UPSC Previous Year Question Papers now!!\n\nTo complement your preparation for the upcoming exam, check the following links:\n\nUPSC Mains General Studies Paper I – Strategy, Syllabus, Structure\n\nTopic-Wise GS 1 Questions for UPSC Mains\n\nPrevious Years History Questions in UPSC Mains General Studies Paper 1\n\nPrevious Years Art and Culture Questions in UPSC Mains General Studies Paper 1\n\n100 Difference between Articles for Revision\n\nJahangir Biography\n\nJahangir was born on 31 August 1569 at Fatehpur Sikri, present Uttar Pradesh to Mughal Emperor Akbar and his wife Mariam-uz-Zamani. Jahangir was named Mirza Nur-ud-din Beig Mohammad Khan Salim and was known simply as Prince Salim. He assumed the title of Jahangir (conqueror of the world) when he assumed the Mughal throne.\n\nHis mother was a Hindu Rajput princess whose original name is not known for certainty. She is sometimes referred to as Harkha Bai or Jodhabai. She was the daughter of Raja Bihari Mal.\n\nJahangir was the eldest son of Akbar. But the lack of primogeniture among the Mughals meant a tussle for the throne was bound to happen.\n\nHe revolted for power while his father was engaged in the Deccan in 1599. But Akbar returned to Agra and the rebellion was suppressed.\n\nWith the support of his stepmothers, he rose to power on Akbar’s death. His reign started on 3rd November 1605 and continued till his death on 28 October 1627.\n\nEarly in his reign, he had to quell a rebellion by his son Khusrau. Khusrau was blinded by his father as punishment.\n\nHe also had to face a rebellion by his other son Khurram. But this was also settled. Prince Khurram later became the emperor on Jahangir’s death and became known as Shah Jahan.\n\nJahangir’s reign had political stability and a good economy thanks to the sound administration and policies of his father Akbar. He continued with the policy of expansion through conquest.\n\nHe was especially fond of art and architecture. He commissioned, catalogued and preserved many artworks. He also kept a zoo where he documented each species of animal. He was exposed to European artworks through the Jesuits who visited his court and encouraged his court painters to adopt European styles as well.\n\nHe was visited by Sir Thomas Roe, the first English ambassador to the Mughal court. Jahangir allowed the English the right to reside and establish factories in Surat. The first English factory in India came about in this way.\n\nIn the year 1594, while still a prince, Jahangir had commanded a force that defeated Vir Singh Deo of Bundela and captured the city of Orchha. He also acquired the suzerainty of Cooch Bihar, Mewar and Kistwar in Kashmir.\n\nHe had skirmishes with the Portuguese when they seized a Mughal ship off the coast of Surat in 1613. He retaliated by seizing Daman and confiscating their churches. He gave the English considerable concessions to gain advantage and favour against the Portuguese.\n\nJahangir is not considered in the same light as his illustrious father and is sometimes considered a weak king. He was said to be addicted to alcohol and opium. He married many times and one of his favourite wives was Nur Jahan who is thought to have influenced him in politics.\n\nHe died in Kashmir where he had gone to rejuvenate his health. He was 58.\n\nHe was succeeded by his son Khurram from his Rajput wife Jagat Gosaini.\n\nAlso on this day\n\n1867: Birth of Margaret Elizabeth Noble who later became Sister Nivedita, a disciple of Swami Vivekananda. 1900: Death of German-born orientalist and Indologist Max Muller. 1955: Birth of Indra Nooyi, CEO of PepsiCo in Chennai. 1955: Birth of Bill Gates, founder of Microsoft, in Seattle, USA.\n\nCandidates can find the general pattern of the UPSC Exams by visiting the UPSC Syllabus page.\n\nRelated Links\n\nIAS Salary Static GK Akbar’s Successors- Medieval Age Reign Mughal Painting – Elite Mixture of Indian, Persian and Islamic styles NCERT Notes: India Under The Mughals Sir Thomas Roe – Arrived in Surat Famous Mughal Emperor Shah Jahan Bahadur Shah Zafar Receives the Emperor of Delhi Title – [September 28, 1837] Mughal Emperor Akbar: Brief biography Foreign Travellers in Indian History Formation of British East India Company – [December 31, 1600] Aurangzeb Ascended the Throne – [July 31, 1658] The Rajputs and North Kingdoms Bahmani Kingdom 1347-1526 NCERT Notes: The Deccan Kingdoms NCERT Notes: Delhi Sultanate NCERT Notes: Arab And Turkish Invasions Sayyid and Lodi Dynasties Vijayanagara Empire – Founded by Harihara and Bukka Tughlaq Dynasty – Delhi Sultanate Slave Dynasty (Sultanate of Delhi) Rashtrakuta Dynasty Gupta Empire – Facts about Origins, and most Important Kings Satavahana Dynasty – Post Mauryan Period Babur – Founder of Mughal Empire Alauddin Khilji – Khilji Dynasty Buddhist And Jain Architecture In India: Facts and Details Difference between Buddhism and Hinduism Difference Between Janapadas and Mahajanapadas Difference Between Ancient, Medieval and Modern History"
