        "text": "Day 1 | Morning\n\nTaj Mahal\n\nOpening Hours: Open on Mon-Fri,Sun\n\nTicket Price: 750 INR\n\nRecommended Length of Stay: 1-3 Hours\n\nLocation: Dharmapuri, Forest Colony, Tajganj, Agra, Uttar Pradesh 2001\n\nThe Taj Mahal is a must-see attraction in India, praised by the poet Tagore as \"an eternal teardrop\". Completed in 1654, the Taj Mahal was built by Mughal Emperor Shah Jahan for Queen Ajman Banu at a huge cost. This palatial mausoleum is mainly constructed of pure white marble, inlaid with precious stones from all over the world. The Taj Mahal also has a completely symmetrical architectural aesthetic, combining Indian and Persian architectural art. The entire building complex includes the vestibule, the main entrance, the main body of the mausoleum and other attractions. You can enter the vestibule from the west, east and south entrances, and then enter from the main entrance. There is a marble pool in the middle called Hawdal-Kawthar (meaning \"Pool of Abundance\"), and the reflection of the Taj Mahal in the water is clearly visible. There is a bench next to the pool that attracts many tourists to sit and take pictures. This is where Princess Diana took pictures when she visited the Taj Mahal. At the end of the pool, on the raised marble platform is the Taj Mahal. There is a tower at each corner of the mausoleum. The main body of the mausoleum is octagonal, with a large hemispherical dome in the middle, decorated with lotus flowers, and four small circles around it. top. The walls on both sides of the entrance to the main tomb are engraved with the Book of Songs, and when you enter the interior, you can see two sarcophagi, one large and one small, but Shah Jahan and the queen are buried in another underground crypt. The interior of the mausoleum is illuminated only by the sunlight that penetrates from the outside, and photography is not allowed here. There is a monastery on the east and west sides of the main mausoleum, the west one is used for praying and kneeling, and the east one is mainly for maintaining symmetry. In different time and light, the Taj Mahal has different appearances. It is warm golden-orange in the early morning, white in the sun, and gradually turns from gold to pink and dark red at dusk, and turns silvery white again at the beginning of the moon. In the corner of the temples on both sides, you can take pictures of the Taj Mahal seen through the arcade, which is also interesting.\n\nReviews from Real Guests:\n\nvar: There are few buildings that evoke such a depth of feeling. Built as an expression of the love that Shah Jahan held for his second wife, Mumptaz Mahal, the beauty of the mausoleum has withstood time and is a true wonder. For those unfamiliar with the history, Jahan had ten wives. He favoured Mumtaz above all. She was 20 when they married in 1612. She gave birth to 14 children, but died following the delivery of the 14th child. She was only 39. While on her death-bed she asked Jahan for a promise. She asked that he build a monument befitting of the love that they held for each other. The Taj Mahal is much bigger than I imagined. The building centres on the resting place of Mumtaz and Jahan. But the Taj Mahal is itself at the centre of a number of buildings, including a Mosque. The ornate gardens are well maintained and, at the time of my visit, were crowded with visitors, mainly from within India. The marble floor of the walkway around the Taj Mahal is quite slippy, well polished by the bare feet of the many visitors who have gone before me. I found the stairway to the Taj Mahal to be quite unnerving.I got good value for my 750 rupee admission fee and would recommend the Taj Mahal to any romaticly inclined person such as myself, but if you have a loving partner, bring her too.\n\nTrip.com User: it’s just a beautiful and magical place, ist amazing to see an increíble construction dedícated to love in a big expression !!! it’s a place you must to see with your eyes\n\nDay 1 | Evening\n\nIf you want to explore other popular attractions later, The Oberoi Amarvilas Agra is a suitable place for you to stay and refresh.\n\nThe Oberoi Amarvilas Agra\n\nIndulge with your own private view of the greatest monument of love at The Oberoi Amarvilas, recognised as the leading luxury hotel in Agra.
