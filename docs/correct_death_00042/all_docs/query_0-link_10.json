        "text": "Tomb of Akbar the Great in Sikandra, Agra (must see)\n\nIn the western suburbs of Agra lies Sikandra town that is famous for housing the mausoleum of Emperor Akbar. The Tomb of Akbar the Great is an important Mughal architectural masterpiece, built 1605–1613, set in 48 ha (119 acres) of grounds. It is a sizable complex of finest architectural structures as minarets, towers, gates and the tomb building, most of them being built with red stone and white marble. Panel designs are geometric, floral and calligraphic, and prefigure the more complex and subtle designs later incorporated in Itimâd-ud-Daulâ's Tomb.\n\nThe third Mughal Emperor Akbar the Great (1555–1605), himself commenced its construction in around 1600, according to Tartary tradition to commence the construction of one's tomb during one's lifetime. Akbar himself planned his own tomb and selected a suitable site for it. After his death, Akbar's son Jahangir completed the construction in 1605-1613. Akbar was one of the greatest emperors of his time.\n\nWhy You Should Visit:\n\nOne of the best places in Agra! Pure energy, good vibrations, not so many people as at the Taj.\n\nTip:\n\nWalk to the very rightmost area, stand in the center diamond and clap. You'll hear the sound but no one else will.\n\nWalk to the corner pillars and whisper. The person across from you will hear what you say.\n\nThere is a huge amount of fascinating history from this tomb, so try to hire a guide.\n\nSight description based on Wikipedia.\n\nAgra Introduction Walking Tour\n\nAgra, the former capital of India under the powerful Mughal emperors, today is perhaps India's most popular tourist destination, in large part due to the magnificent Taj Mahal located here.
