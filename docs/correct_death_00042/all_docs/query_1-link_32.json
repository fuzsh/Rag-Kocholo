        "text": "Agra is 200 km southeast of Delhi and is one of three stops of India's Golden Triangle. Agra is also very well connected via rail and road with other nearby cities and tourist destinations. Like moths to a flame, the allure of the Taj Mahal has been drawing travelers to Agra for centuries. The Taj is not a stand-alone attraction completed with a magnificent fort and a liberal sprinkling of fascinating tombs and mausoleums; there are so many places to visit in Agra.\n\nWhile Agra's golden age was as the capital of the Mughal empire between 1526 and 1658, the city was founded much earlier. The earliest reference to Agra is in the ancient epic, the Mahabharata, while Ptolemy was the first person to call it by its modern name. The recorded history of Agra begins around the 11th century, and over the next 500 years, the city changed hands between various kings, both Hindu and Muslim.\n\nMughals were great builders. Babur built the Aram Bagh (Garden of Relaxation) which was modeled after the garden of paradise and was where he was buried after his death. His grandson Akbar refurbished the Agra fort and built Fatehpur Sikri, an entire city just on the outskirts of Agra. He also renamed Agra after himself, and the city was known as Akbarabad while it was in Mughal hands. Akbar's grandson Shah Jehan would give.\n\nAgra’s most famous monument is Taj Mahal, which Shah Jehan constructed as a mausoleum for his most beloved wife, Mumtaz Mahal. The Taj is constructed in white marble. It took 20 years to construct, and is now universally known as a monument of love. The Taj Mahal is also often considered as the world’s best example of Mughal architecture. Other places to visit in Agra is Agra Fort, called Red Fort due to its massive red sandstone walls, was built by the emperor Akbar. The Fort is constructed of white marble, and contains a palace, the Jahangiri Mahal, and The Pearl Mosque. In 1983, the fort was designated a World Heritage site. Located near the Taj Mahal, there is The Jāmiʿ Masjid, or Great Mosque, and the elegant tomb of Iʿtimād al-Dawlah; both are built of white marble. Northwest, at Sikandra, located the tomb of Akbar.\n\nAlong with so many places in India, Agra is rich in its culture. Many religious and cultural festivals are held in Agra. The annual Taj Mahotsav is a 10-day art, crafts, and music carnival. Usually, it is held in February in Shilpagram, a crafts village close to the Taj Mahal. The theme of the festival is different every year. During the festival, the artists show their talents concerning music and dancing, reflecting the diversity of Indian culture. Additionally, the Taj Literature Festival gives a chance for the icons of the literature around the world to meet.\n\nConcerning its location, Agra plays an important role, as it is an industrial centre for commerce and industry, besides being a major road and rail junction. The city is known for its hand-woven carpets, and leather goods."
