The South gate of this tomb is the largest with four white marble chhatri-topped minarets, similar to those of the Taj Mahal. The buildings are constructed mainly from deep red sandstone.\n\nAn inscription on the mausoleum reads: These are the Gardens of Eden: enter them to dwell eternally!\n\nWhile the entire tomb was constructed and Akbar lived through it, Jahangir constructed a floor of marble stone over the structure. Thus, he completed the structure of his Emperor father's tomb. After his death Jahangir completed the construction in 1605-1613. It cost 1,500,000 rupees to build and took 3 or 4 years to complete.\n\nDuring the reign of Aurangzeb, Jats rose in rebellion under the leadership of Raja Ram Jat. Mughal prestige suffered a blow when Jats ransacked Akbar's tomb, plundering and looting the gold, jewels, silver and carpets. The grave was opened and the late king's bones were burned.\n\nAs Viceroy of India, George Curzon directed extensive repairs and restoration of Akbar's mausoleum, which were completed in 1905. Curzon discussed the restoration of the mausoleum and other historical buildings in Agra in connection with the passage of the Ancient Monuments Preservation Act in 1904 when he described the project as \"an offering of reverence to the past and a gift of recovered beauty to the future\".\nAmazing clicks by @amapandalens \n#akbarstomb #akbar #agra #history #fort #indianhistory #mughal #mughalempire #history #mughalarchitecture #architecture #medieval #historyofindia #india #instagood #indianmonuments #indianculture #indianhistory #instagram #storiesofindia #culture #feed #akbar #akbarstomb\".",
