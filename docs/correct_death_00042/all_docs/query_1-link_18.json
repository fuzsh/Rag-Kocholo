Akbar’s son, Jahangir, commissioned the construction of the tomb after Akbar’s death in 1605. The main tomb building is four-tiered and made of red sandstone and marble. The lower levels are made of red sandstone, while the upper levels, including the central dome, are constructed using white marble. The tomb is a blend of various architectural styles, showcasing a combination of Persian, Indian, and Islamic elements.\n\nDocumented by CA&A in September 1985 and November-December 1990\n\nThis collection was digitized through MEAP grant awarded to CA&A by the @uclalibrary \n\n#tombofakbar #sikandra #agra #uttarpradesh #india #jahangir #redsandstone #marblearchitecture #persianarchitecture #indianarchitecture #islamicarchitecture #historicalmonument #mughalarchitecture\".",
