        "text": "Place Details:\n\nThe tomb of Akbar the Great, located in Sikandra, in the suburbs of Agra is an important Mughal architectural masterpiece, which was built between 1605-1613. Akbar himself commenced the construction of this tomb, according to Tartary tradition, which stated to commence the construction of one’s tomb during one’s lifetime. The South gate of this tomb is the largest with four white marble chhatri-topped minarets, similar to those of the Taj Mahal. The buildings are constructed mainly from deep red sandstone. An inscription on the mausoleum reads: ‘These are the Gardens of Eden: enter them to dwell eternally.’ This historical monument’s beauty cannot be justified in words and one has to visit this place to actually witness it.\n\nImage: Wikimedia Commons\n\nBEST TIME TO VISIT AGRA\n\nThe average minimum and maximum temperature of Agra is as given below. The best time to visit Agra is also specified."
