The decoration of jewels and pearls made the minaret look like a stunning piece of Indo – Islamic architecture. However, good things are rooted to be plundered if history is kept in consideration. Akbar’s tomb makers had no idea that a small mistake by Aurangzeb would set great deals for the tomb of his grandfather.\n\nThe jats in the leadership of Raja Ram Jat rose against Aurangzeb, plundered the tomb of Akbar and took out all its gold and jewels, and devastated it into almost a ruin. They took the control on Agra fort, and shown rage in the most horrifying manners.\n\nThey looted the tomb, dig out the remains of Akbar and dragged his bones out of the coffin. This malpractice was initiated because Aurangzeb then ruler of Mughal Dynasty had killed one of the Jat man, the father of Gukula.\n\nHowever, Aurangzeb got ferocious and killed their leader Raja Ram Jat mercilessly.\n\nThe tomb, which was now a ruin had no one to properly take care of, it is in the times of British era when Lord Curzon took responsibility to mend this heritage site.\n\nArchitecture Of Akbar’s Tomb\n\nThe beautiful red and white sandstone fabricated building is one of the best examples of Indo – Islamic architectural styles.
