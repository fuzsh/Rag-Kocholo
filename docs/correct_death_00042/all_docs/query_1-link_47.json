        "text": "Agra is one of the most popular tourist destinations in India. It is renowned for being home to one the Seven Wonders of the world, the Taj Mahal. It is as loved by Indians as it is by foreigners who throng here in large numbers to admire its beauty. Along with Delhi and Jaipur, Agra forms the Golden Triangle of tourism in India. Situated in Uttar Pradesh, Agra is synonymous with the Taj Mahal however there’s lot more to the city than this world-famous monument. Right from the epic Mahabharata to the Mughal Dynasty, Agra has been monumental and has played a significant role in shaping India’s history. The city was first mentioned in Mahabharata as Agrevana which means the border of the forest. It was later established by Sikandar Lodi of the Lodi Dynasty in the sixteenth century who built many structures including forts, step wells, mosques, etc in Agra. He moved his capital from Delhi to Agra and after his death, his son ruled the city for nine years. Later, Sher Shah Suri ruled Agra and from 1556 to 1658 it was the capital of the Mughal Empire. ALSO SEE There’s more to Agra than the Taj Mahal\n\nUnder the Mughal reign Agra was called Akbarabad and was ruled by greats like Akbar, Jehangir, Shah Jahan, etc. Their love for architecture, gardens and art and culture added a new dimension to Agra’s personality. From Persian gardens on the banks of the Yamuna to monuments and mausoleums, Agra’s golden age started during their rule. It was after the decline of the Mughal Empire and during the reign of the Marathas that Akbarabad became Agra. By 1803, it came under the British Raj that remained strong for most part until India gained independence in 1947.\n\nWhat also shaped Agra’s culture were the different religions that were born and flourished here. From Din-i-Ilahi to the Radhaswami Faith, these beliefs had followers from Akbar’s time. Runukta of Hinduism and Shauripur of Jainism too have their links to Agra.\n\nWith so many prominent rulers having ruled the city, Agra is home to several important monuments including three UNESCO World Heritage Sites: the Taj Mahal, Agra Fort and Fatehpur Sikri. A trip to Agra is incomplete without paying a visit to these that will take you back to an era of its glorious past.\n\nGETTING THERE\n\nAgra is well-connected by road, rail and air with most parts of the country as it is a prime tourist destination. Interestingly, it is 210 km away from the state capital Lucknow and only 125 km away from Delhi. The city is on the banks of the River Yamuna and enjoys a healthy influx of tourists all year round.\n\nAgra’s Kheria Airport is 12.5 km away from the heart of the city and you can avail of taxis once you land. There are four main railway heads in Agra: Agra Cantonment, Agra Fort, Idgah Agra Junction and Raja ki Mandi. Trains from most cities halt at one of these railway stations. India’s fastest train, the Gatimaan Express that runs between Delhi and Agra in flat 100 minutes is also an option for tourists. It also offers travel itineraries for one, two or more days. You can also drive down to Agra from different parts of the county. The Yamuna Expressway is one of the fastest routes to reach Agra from Delhi. If you don’t have your own vehicle, you can even avail of private cabs that ply on this expressway. Buses also ply from cities like Delhi, Lucknow, Jaipur and Gwalior to Agra. The main bus stops in the city are Taj Depot, Inter State Bus Terminal, Ford Depot and Idgah Bus Stand. The government has insured that reaching Agra is not a hassle as it generates a major chunk of tourism for the state.\n\nALSO SEE Honeymoon in Agra: Best places to stay and visit in the city of love\n\nSIGHTSEEING ATTRACTIONS IN AGRA\n\nAgra was the seat of the Mughal Empire and is peppered with some great architectural marvels of their times. While Taj Mahal garners the most amount of interest, when in Agra, it is important to pay a visit to some of the city’s other exemplary structures. Once you are done admiring the wonder that is Taj Mahal, move on to other important sites, some in its vicinity and some a little further away from it. From Akbar’s Tomb to Agra Fort and the walled city of Fatehpur Sikri, Agra is home to some important monuments that tell the story of India’s history. Take a day out to explore these gems that Agra has to offer.\n\nTaj Mahal\n\nThe very first thing every tourist who comes to Agra wants to do is see the beauty that is Taj Mahal. No matter how many times you’ve been here, it will leave you mesmerized with its intricate carvings and architecture. The Taj Mahal is certainly the main attraction that draws millions of tourists to Agra every year and rightly so. Called the epitome of love, it was constructed by Shah Jahan for his beloved wife Mumtaz Mahal whose tomb rests right under the central dome of the monument. It took 22 years and over 20,000 workers to construct this marvel. Shah Jahan spent his last years imprisoned in the Agra Fort gazing at his creation and after his death, his tomb was placed inside the Taj Mahal next to his wife. The white marble monument is an architectural marvel with fine detailing, on the south bank of the Yamuna River. Verses from the Holy Quran are inscribed on it, gemstones adorn its walls and the intricate inlay work adds a touch of magnificence to the structure. Another brilliant fact that makes it a masterpiece is its symmetry, which is why it looks the same from all four sides.\n\nBeing one of the Seven Wonders of the World and the only one in India doesn’t stop from wrong stories floating around the Taj Mahal. Ones like the Taj Mahal was also to be built in black marble or that Shah Jahan dismembered the arms of the artisans who built the monument are pretty common but not really true. But one true and fascinating story is that Agra was not the first choice to build the Taj Mahal. Yes, the world famous monument was originally planned to be constructed in Madhya Pradesh in Burhanpur because Mumtaz Mahal passed away there. Shah Jahan had even marked out the site along the Tapti River where it was to be built but the plan was shelved when Burhanpur was unable to supply enough white marble that was required for its construction. And so, Agra got its iconic monument that we call the Taj Mahal.\n\nAdmire its striking beauty yourself when here. The Taj Mahal is open for visitors between 6 am to 6 pm but remains shut on Fridays. The entry fee for Indians is Rs 20 and for foreign nationals it is Rs 750. According to one legend, if you walk away from the Taj Mahal and look back, you are likely to come back for another visit. Would you?\n\nALSO SEE 8 magnificent photos of the Taj Mahal\n\nAgra Fort\n\nAnother architectural jewel in this city is the Agra Fort, a UNESCO World Heritage Site. It was built by Mughal Emperor Akbar with the help of 4,000 workers who worked for eight years to finish its construction in 1573. Agra Fort is made of red sandstone and was the seat of the Mughal Empire. Some of the major attractions in Agra Fort that will leave you mesmerized are structures like the Sheesh Mahal, Moti Mahal, Jehangir’s Palace and Khas Mahal. The fort has four large gate of which the Delhi Gate was used for the king’s formal entry. Diwan-i-Khas and Diwan-i-Aam were reserved for royal audience and the public respectively.\n\nAgra Fort has been prominent during the Mughal reign. Even though Akbar built it, during the rule of Shah Jahan, he renovated it by adding marble work and converting the raw red sandstone structure to a palace. Years later, his son Aurangzeb imprisoned him in the same fort at Mussaman Burj. Do pay a visit to this part of the fort as it offers one of the best views of the Taj Mahal. Despite these changes, Agra Fort is an epitome of Mughal architecture at its best and shouldn’t be missed.\n\nAgra Fort is open to tourists all days of the week from 7 am to 6 pm. For Indians, the entry fee is Rs 20 while for foreigners it is Rs 300. It is spread across 94 acres so you will need about two hours to explore the entire monument.\n\nFatehpur Sikri\n\nOne of Emperor Akbar’s pet projects was building a walled city a little away from Agra. He called it Fatehpur Sikri and even ruled here for sometime before he was forced to move out due to shortage of water supply. Nevertheless, the surviving monuments tell a tale of his valour and great work. Fateh in Persian signifies victory. The city survived and three of its walled sides are still intact. Akbar paid keen interest in its architecture and layout and it took about 15 years to plan and build it completely. Once ready, it had palaces, harems, buildings, courts and a mosque. But one of the best architectural wonders of Fatehpur Sikri is the Buland Darwaza, a grand gateway to the walled city. Made of red sandstone, there are 52 steps that lead up to its 175 ft high archway that has two inscriptions. Akbar’s favorite minister Birbal too has a monument in Fatehpur Sikri called Birbal’s house. Since he was a Hindu, the architecture is different than the usual Mughal buildings.\n\nOne of the first buildings to be constructed in Fatehpur Sikri was the Jama Masjid, a mosque built according to Indian mosque architecture. It also houses the tomb of Salim Chishti, a great Sufi saint. Akbar, who was the founder of the faith Din-e-Ilahi also constructed Ibadat Khana in Fatehpur Sikri which was used for meetings. The Panch Mahal, a five-storey palatial structure was for the ladies and the Naubat Khana that had drummers announce the entry of the emperor were other unique structures in this city. Despite the lavish architecture and careful planning, Fatehpur Sikri was abandoned in 1585 after ruling it from 1571. This was because the lake that supplied water to the city dried up. Even so, it is worth marvelling the beauty of what a magnificent city this once was. Fatehpur Sikri is about 37 km away from Agra but can be completed on the same trip. Most of the city lies uninhabited and reminds one of its once glorious past. You can find a few budget hotels to stay at near the Fatehpur Sikri Railway Station. Don’t miss visiting this place as it is another UNESCO World Heritage Site.\n\nAkbar’s Tomb\n\nAkbar the Great built some majestic monuments in his lifetime and one of them was his tomb itself. The task of commissioning your own tomb is part of Turkic custom that Mughals adhered to. He even selected the site where he wanted to be kept. His last resting place, Sikandra is where Akbar’s Tomb is. His son Jehangir completed the construction of his father’s tomb in 1613 and it was beautifully carved, made of red sandstone. Just 1 km away from Akbar’s Tomb is Mariam’s Tomb, who was Akbar’s wife and Jehangir’s mother. The monument is open for visitors on all days of the week from 6 am to 6 pm. The entry fee for Indians is Rs 15 and for foreigners it is Rs 110.\n\nMehtab Bagh\n\nTranslating to moonlight garden, Mehtab Bagh is the perfect spot for admiring the beauty of the Taj Mahal. Built by Babur, it is a square garden that was once resplendent with pools, fountains and trees. Today, it makes for a recreational tourist spot. A Mughal garden, it is perfectly aligned with the Taj Mahal along the Yamuna River and was described by Shah Jahan as the ideal spot for viewing the Taj Mahal.\n\nDue to frequent floods and extraction of building material by the villagers, the garden lay in ruins by the ‘90s. However, the Archaeological Survey of India (ASI) intervened and started work to restore the garden to its original state. They even made sure that the plants used in Mehtab Bagh were ones that were originally a part of Mughal gardens. These included guava, Ashoka, jamun, neem, hibiscus, etc. There were four sandstone towers too in the garden at its four corners, however, only one remains now. During the restoration, other structures were added to Mehtab Bagh that were not originally a part of it. Some of these include a statue of BR Ambedkar holding the constitution of India, a temple and nurseries. Visit Mehtab Bagh between 6 am to 7 pm, it is open on all days of the week. The entry fee for Indians is Rs 5 while for foreign nationals it is Rs 100.\n\nMankameshwar Mandir\n\nOne of the ancient Shiva temples in the country, Mankameshwar Mandir holds much religious importance as according to the legend, Shiva installed a lingam here on his own. The Mughal architecture isn’t the only thing that draws tourists to Agra, temples like these are also crowd-pullers. The temple is close to Agra Fort and near other tourist monuments like the Taj Mahal. As per the legend, Shiva wanted to go to Mathura after the birth of Krishna to get a glimpse of the little baby boy. During his descent from Mount Kailash, he rested and meditated at the sight of this temple and declared that if he is able to reach in time to see Krishna, he will install his swaroop here. And so, on his way back he kept his word and there was a lingam here covered in silver.\n\nToday, Shiva devotees come from different parts of the county to pay a visit to this temple. People have to climb down a flight of stairs to reach Mankameshwar Mandir’s sanctum sanctorum. It is surrounded by other idols of Shiva’s family and there are more temples behind this temple’s complex dedicated to other gods like Saraswati, Krishna, Hanuman and more.\n\nWhen here, you can light a deepak and make a wish as the temple gets its name from a wish-fulfilling temple that Shiva himself created. Also, try the paan outside which is usually triangular and covered in silver foil. Mankameshwar Mandir is open on all days from 7 am to 10 pm and entry to the temple is free for all.\n\nTomb of Itimad-ud-Daulah\n\nAnother display of Mughal architecture, the Tomb of Itimad-ud-Daulah was commissioned by Nur Jahan, Jehangir’s wife, for her father Mirza Beg who was given the title of Itimad-ud-Daulah or pillar of the state. The mausoleum is often referred as the draft of Taj Mahal or Baby Taj as it has various elements that are identical to the Wonder of the World. It is also called a jewel box as it isn’t as grand as other Mughal structures yet there is no compromise on its intricacy.\n\nThe Tomb of Itimad-ud-Daulah is made of white marble from Rajasthan and has semi-precious stones encrusted in its walls that display different objects such as a vase, bouquet, fruits, etc. Its construction began in 1622 and was completed in 1628. A garden criss-crossed by walkways and water courses surround the monument. It is located on the right bank of the Yamuna River and is a close replica of the Taj Mahal including its interiors. Mirza Beg’s tomb rests next to his wife’s tomb which was inspired by the Taj Mahal. Many of Nur Jahan’s relatives’ tombs are also kept in this monument.\n\nYou can visit the Tomb of Itimad-ud-Daulah any day of the week between 6 am to 6 pm. The entry fee for Indians is Rs 10 and for foreigners it is Rs 250. Even though this is the smallest of the Mughal monuments, it is a must-visit when in Agra for its intricate work.\n\nGuru ka Tal\n\nPeople of the Sikh community have another reason to visit Agra as it is home to Guru ka Tal. A reservoir from the Mughal era, Guru ka Tal became a religious place when a gurudwara was constructed here in 1970s. What makes it a holy pilgrimage destination is the fact that four out of the 10 Sikh gurus have visited this place in their lifetime. Being both a historical and religious site, it draws enough tourists as well as pilgrims.\n\nGuru ka Tal is also known for its stone carvings and towers that increase its beauty manifold. Even though it is a Sikh religious place, owing to its Mughal past, its architecture of red sandstone reminds us of its historical past. The gurudwara is built in the memory of Guru Tegh Bahadur Ji, the ninth Sikh guru who was martyred here during his fight for the freedom to practise one’s faith.\n\nRam Bagh\n\nThe first of the eleven Mughal gardens to be built, Ram Bagh was Babur’s idea and was initially called Amar Bagh that translates to garden of relaxation. Built in 1528 on the banks of River Yamuna, it is about 5 km away from the Taj Mahal. The idea of the garden was inspired from a Persian garden that represents the Islamic idea of paradise. Therefore, Ram Bagh had lush greenery with a river flowing through it. It has two viewing pavilions that were built in such a way that the cool breeze from the Yamuna and the trees would keep them cool even during peak summer season. Mughal Emperor Babur spent a lot of time in this garden and even died here. Before moving his body to Kabul, it was kept here for some time. Not just him, Emperor Akbar and his son Jehangir also spent their time in Ram Bagh. The present restored garden displays Nur Jahan’s skills as a garden designer.\n\nKinari Bazaar\n\nIf you love to shop and want to take back home something that will remind you of your Agra trip, head to Kinari Bazaar. A crowded market filled with shops selling some of the best local arts and crafts, Kinari Bazaar is behind Jama Masjid. You will have to brace yourself to walk through narrow lanes that are bursting with people to shop here. From shoes, fabrics, spices, jewellery to even marble work, you will find everything in this market. You can even sample local snacks at one of the many street shops. Kinari Bazaar opens at 11 am and shuts down by 9 pm. It is open all days of the week except Tuesdays. Keep this for later once you are done with sightseeing in Agra.\n\nBEST PLACES TO STAY IN AGRA\n\nBeing a tourist spot, Agra offers accommodation for all types of budgets. It also has homestays and hostels if you do not want to shell out too much money. Budget accommodation can cost you anything from Rs 500 to Rs 1,000 and can be easily found around the Taj Mahal. However, accommodation at a low-end or budget hotel is not advisable as it could well be in one of the dirtier parts of the city.Mid-range hotels charge anywhere between Rs 1,000 to Rs 3,000, while tariff at luxury hotels can go Rs 3,000 upwards. The luxury hotels at Agra are among the best in the country and since Agra receives tourists all through the year it is advisable to book in advance.\n\nAmong luxury stays, the Oberoi Amarvilas (0562 2231515) is one of the best with breathtaking views of the Taj Mahal from your hotel room.

The city is bestknown for its petha, pedhas, gajak and dalmoth.

Here are some of the top festivals celebrated in Agra every year.\n\nTaj Mahotsav\n\nProbably the biggest celebration of the monument, Taj Mahotsav usually takes place in February every year.
