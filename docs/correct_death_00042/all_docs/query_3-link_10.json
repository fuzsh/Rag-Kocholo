        "text": "Akbar the “Great” would treacherously assassinate Hindu nobles by feeding them poisoned Paan. He kept identical medicine & poison pills in his Paan box, to secretly slip poison. One day Akbar mistakenly ate the poison pill instead of medicine & died.\n\nKarma served his last Paan.\n\nThis horrific treacherous & cowardly Al-Taqiya was initiated by Akbar in many ways & passed on as a tradition among the Mughals. They would apply snake venom on special robes offered as an honor with friendly letters & assassinate Hindu nobles under the pretension of diplomacy.\n\nSource: Storia Do Mogor Vol.1 (Mogul India), Manucci, Niccolao, translated by William Irvine.\n\n(This article has been compiled from the tweet thread posted by @MumukshuSavitri on May 21, 2023, with minor edits to improve readability and conform to HinduPost style guide)\n\nSubscribe to our channels on Telegram & YouTube.
