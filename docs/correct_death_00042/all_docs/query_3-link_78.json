        "text": "During his four-decade political career, Iran’s former President Ali Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani earned many nicknames. He was called the Shark, both for his smooth, hairless cheeks (reflecting his Mongol ancestry) and the killer political instincts that helped him manipulate one of the most turbulent revolutions in modern times. After the 1979 ouster of the Shah, Rafsanjani amassed so much power in fifteen years—as the speaker of parliament, President, a wartime Commander-in-Chief, and Friday Prayer Leader—that he was dubbed Akbar Shah, which means “great king.” After a revolution that ended millennia of monarchy, it was not always meant as a compliment.\n\nRafsanjani, who began his religious studies at the age of fourteen, was one of nine children of a prominent pistachio farmer. He studied under Ayatollah Khomeini—taking his surname from his province when he became a cleric, as is the custom—and joined the Imam’s opposition to the Shah, in 1963. After the 1979 revolution, Rafsanjani became the theocracy’s Machiavelli—at times wily and ruthless, at other times a jokester who gently cajoled followers with his famed Cheshire-cat grin. He once wept publicly over the Iranian victims of Iraq’s use of chemical weapons. He played the system until the end.\n\nRafsanjani died on Sunday, at the age of eighty-two, after a massive heart attack. State television interrupted programming to announce that \"after a life full of restless efforts in the path of Islam and revolution,” he had “departed for lofty heaven.\" The female anchor’s voice shook as she spoke.\n\nRafsanjani’s death reflects a growing reality for Tehran’s theocrats. The first generation of revolutionaries are now in their late sixties, seventies, and eighties. They are, literally, a dying breed. Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, who has served as Supreme Leader since 1989, will be seventy-eight this year. In 2014, he had surgery for prostate cancer. Iran’s leaders rule a country in which the majority of the population—and now the majority of voters, too—were born after the revolution. The political gap spans not one generation, but three.\n\n“In ten years, they’ll all be gone,” John Limbert, one of the fifty-two Americans held hostage in Iran between 1979 and 1981, told me on Sunday. “In Iran, Presidents have come and gone but this little circle of about twenty-five of them have stayed on. Their first rule: ‘The only way you give up power is if you die.’ And now they’re dying.”\n\nRafsanjani was the ultimate survivor of a fractious revolution and one of its most complex characters. He had been imprisoned by the last Shah at least four times—in a Tehran store, I once saw his mug shot, as prisoner No. 3324-1354, made into a silk carpet—so he endorsed the bloodthirsty purges and executions of the ancien régime. He also reportedly helped in the acquisition of nuclear technology—potentially used for either peaceful energy or a nuclear bomb—from both Russia and Pakistan. He was cited by prosecutors in Argentina for links to the 1994 bombing of a Jewish center in Buenos Aires, which killed dozens, and by prosecutors in Germany for ties to the killing of Iranian dissidents in Europe.\n\nBut compared to the other theocrats he was a political pragmatist, who orchestrated outreach to the United States, first in the Iran-Contra scandal of the mid-nineteen-eighties, and then in proposing the largest petroleum-development deal in Iran’s history, a partnership with Conoco, in the mid-nineteen-nineties. Years later, Rafsanjani said that he had appealed, in writing, to revolutionary leader Ayatollah Khomeini to rethink policy on a country known as the “Great Satan”:\n\nThere are difficult passages and if you do not help us pass through them, they will be difficult to pass through after you. . . . I wrote that, after all, the current policy whereby we neither negotiate with America, nor have any relations with it, cannot be sustained. America is the world's superpower. What are the differences between America and China, Europe, and Russia [with which we have relations]? If we negotiate with them, why should we not negotiate with America? Negotiating does not imply that we submit to them. We talk to them, and if they accept our positions, or we accept theirs, that is done.\n\nThe deal was rejected by the Clinton Administration. Rafsanjani’s office also oversaw negotiations with Lebanon’s Hezbollah to end the saga of American hostages held in Beirut between 1984 and 1991. Last year, amid tensions over Iran’s missile program, he tweeted, “World of tomorrow is one of negotiations, not the world of missiles.” It provoked a public disagreement with his peers.\n\n“Rafsanjani was no bleeding-heart liberal at the start of the revolution,” Shaul Bakhash, an Iran expert at George Mason University, told me. “But he came to see that the real path for the future was through pragmatism, both at home and abroad.\"\n\nIn 1989, Rafsanjani convinced the regime to accept a controversial ceasefire in the eight-year-long war with Iraq. He launched a massive reconstruction campaign after the war ended. He also advocated free enterprise, including the revival of the Shah’s stock exchange, and less state control of the economy. Over the past decade, he pushed publicly for reforms, including more freedom of expression and rights for civil society. Rafsanjani understood the hard truth in utopian systems: the state has to survive in order for the ideas of a revolution to succeed.\n\n“He was not a theorist of any kind,” Limbert said. “I remember listening to him once give a lecture on economics. I said to an Iranian friend, ‘This doesn’t make any sense.’ My friend replied, ‘You’re listening to a pistachio merchant.’ ”\n\nI often visited parliament, in the nineteen-eighties, when Rafsanjani was speaker. I watched him as he sat on the speaker’s elevated dais, receiving a line of members who would whisper in his ear, as business carried on as usual on the floor of parliament. He would occasionally whisper something back, but most of the time he would listen, until he had the final word—and bestowed that grin, one of traits that made him seem accessible. Under Rafsanjani, Iran’s parliament, or Majlis, had become the revolution’s safety valve, the most open institution in an authoritarian system and a place where people felt that they could at least be heard—whatever their sect or ethnicity. (Iran has proportionate representation for its Jewish, major Christian, and Zoroastrian communities.)\n\nRafsanjani also masterminded the boldest political change since the revolution. A debate still rages among the theocrats about whether the “Islamic Republic of Iran”—its full name –should be first and foremost Islamic or a republic. Rafsanjani argued that it should be a republic—and that the President should be the top executive, with the Supreme Leader acting as a guide or adviser. After the death of revolutionary leader Ayatollah Khomeini, in 1989, Rafsanjani engineered a constitutional amendment that eliminated the position of Prime Minister and transferred power to an executive President. Rafsanjani became that first executive President, for two terms, from 1989 to 1997.\n\nAs part of the political transformation, he also orchestrated the appointment of Ayatollah Khamenei—who had been a weak figurehead President—as the revolution’s second Supreme Leader, on the assumption that he would be easy to control. It backfired. The hardcore revolutionaries—who rejected compromising the revolution’s Islamic identity, rigid strictures, and their own powers—began eating away at Rafsanjani’s power. Khamenei gradually built his own power base among the Revolutionary Guards, and vied to marginalize Rafsanjani. The two men became bitter rivals. In a final put-down, Khamenei tweeted Sunday about Rafsanjani’s death—diminishing his religious title from Ayatollah to the lower Hojatoleslam.\n\nHardliners even went after Rafsanjani’s children; two of them—including one who had been a member of parliament herself, as well as deputy head of Iran’s Olympic Committee—were sentenced to prison terms after Rafsanjani’s second term ended. One of Rafsanjani’s sons is still serving a ten-year sentence for financial crimes; he was released temporarily on Sunday, for his father’s official three-day mourning period.\n\nRafsanjani was widely believed to be a charlatan, too. The revolution’s rhetoric is fixated on aiding “the oppressed.” But the senior cleric reportedly became a multimillionaire, amassing wealth through back-door deals and corruption facilitated by his positions. “He was an opportunist,” Limbert said. “He was prepared to do whatever cemented his power and filled his bank account.”\n\nPublic frustration with official greed blocked Rafsanjani’s many attempts at a political comeback. In 2000, he ran again for parliament—but came in thirtieth in the election of the thirty seats from Tehran, and only after a recount. He originally didn’t make the cut. “He aspired to have a bigger role,” Bakhash said. “He wanted to be speaker again. He always had a big sense of himself.” Humiliated, Rafsanjani opted to resign the seat.\n\nHe ran for the Presidency a third time, in 2005, against Mahmoud Ahmadinejad. The contest pitted “the hat” (a lay politician) against “the turban” (a cleric). Ahmadinejad, then Tehran’s mayor, won in part because he was viewed as comparatively less corrupt. Rafsanjani considered running again, in 2013, but was disqualified by the election watchdog.\n\nIn his final years, Rafsanjani won appointment or election to other posts. At the time of his death, he headed the Expediency Council, which is tasked with resolving disputes between parliament and the twelve-man Guardian Council, which vets legislation for compliance with Islam. But he died short of getting the job he coveted the most—Supreme Leader. He did win election—three times since 1999—to the body that appoints the Supreme Leader, the Assembly of Experts. But he didn’t live long enough to get the job himself."
