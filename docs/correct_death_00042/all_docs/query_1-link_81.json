        "text": "The huge red-brick walls mark the area of the imposing fort that carries the stories of the lifetime of all of the early Mughal emperors. The history of the fort talks about a time when an ancient place named Badalgarh was taken over by Ghaznavi and later on by Chahman rajputs. During the time of Lodi empire, Sikandar Lodi built some brick buildings here and also announced Agra to be his capital instead of Delhi. The fort became one of the most important ones for Mughal empire after the Lodis were defeated by them in the battle of Panipath. The place experienced it’s grandeur during the reign of emperor Akbar. These walls are witness to a number of ups and downs, everyday conversations and happenings that changed the history of the then Indian sub-continent. It has seen emperor Humayun to be crowned, to be defeated by Sher Shah Suri and to come back victorious and recapture the fort in 1555. It saw the lifetime of great rulers like emperor Akbar, Jahangir, Shah Jahan and his love for white marble architecture, the construction of Taj Mahal, numerous stories of people who lived here, tales of the royal ladies, their chores and responsibilities, Emperor Shah Jahan kept captivated by his son Aurangzeb and so on. It’s an epitaph of history that reminds about the magnificent time that India and her people used to live once, here in the walled city of Agra.\n\nTales of time:\n\nAfter the defeat of Ibrahim Lodi in the battle of Panipath in 1526, the Lodi empire came to an end and the era of Mughal empire began. The first emperor of Mughal dynasty in India, emperor Babur, started to live here and later emperor Humayun was also crowned here in 1530. As Humayun was defeated by the Suris, they captured the fort and it was with them till 1555 when Humayun came back and won it again. Hem Chandra, popularly known as Hemu, who was also the military general of Adil Shah Suri, captured it in 1556 and won the battle of tughalaqabad against the Mughals. However, this victory was short-lived. He could only reign for one month before the Suris and the Mughals met again in Panipath, in the same place where emperor Babur defeated Ibrahim Lodi years ago and the Mughal empire was established. This time, Hemu lost and once again, the Agra fort came under the control of Mughal empire. Emperor Akbar understood the importance of it’s location and changed his capital to Agra in 1558.\n\nAkbar ordered red sandstone from Barauli, Rajasthan and reconstructed the ruined fort of Badalgarh, making it the impressive fort that stands there today. The inner core was built with bricks and the outer parts with those sandstones, which made it one of the strongest ones of the empire. It took 8 years to be completed and the hard labour of 4000 skilled workers. Finally the construction work was done in 1573. The later years passed in battlefields and the Mughal empire extended it’s rule from Indus valley in the west to the highlands of present day Bangladesh and Assam in the east, from Kashmir in the north to the banks of Kaveri in the south along with some parts of today’s northern Afghanistan in the north west. During the reign of emperor Shah Jahan, some of the old buildings were destroyed to make way to new marble structures. After emperor Aurangzeb came into power, he restrained Shah Jahan and kept him captivated inside the same fort. It is said that Shah Jahan passed his final days and breathed his last in Muasamman Burj, which is a tower with a marble balcony along with a view of the Taj Mahal.\n\nLater on, the fort was invaded by the Marathas and was with them till the early 18th century. In 1761, they lost the battle of Panipath to Ahmed Shah Abdali and thus, left the fort. It was recaptured by Mahadji Shinde in 1785 but the Marathas lost it again to the British army during the second Anglo Marathan war in 1803. During the rebellion of 1857, the fort also served as a battle site. This rebellion paved the way to end the rule of British East India company in the sub continent and the century of being directly ruled by Britain, started.\n\nArchitecture:\n\nThe 70-feet high walls of the fort lie parallel to Yamuna river that flows by. There are four gates to the fort and one that opens to the river. Two of the gates are named as ‘Delhi gate’ and ‘Lahore gate’. As the western side of the fort is now used for military training, the Delhi gate is not accessible to all. However, it is known as a grand architecture that talks about the royal ambience that prevailed here during emperor Akbar’s time. There was also a wooden bridge over the river and as you enter the fort from that way, you get welcomed by the Hathi pole (an imposing gateway with statues of two life sized elephants along with their riders). The bridge was also made and placed in a way that secured the gate from invaders. During any attack, elephants were used to crash a fort’s gate and march forward. Elephants had to run towards the gate straight, without any obstruction, to gather enough speed to break the fort’s gate. However, the presence of this drawbridge created a 90 degrees angle between the inner and outer gate, standing as an obstacle, making the elephant trick a fruitless one.\n\nA marble table, which was a gift to Emperor Jahangir and was very dear to him\n\nAccording to Abul Fazl, the historian or record keeper in Akbar’s court, in the initial stage 500 buildings were made inside the fort following designs from Bengal and Gujarat. However, most of them were demolished later to make way to Emperor Shah Jahan’s marble architectures. Some of them were also destroyed to build barracks for the soldiers. Only 30 of those beautiful buildings have survived in the south eastern side facing the Yamuna, according to history. The Delhi gate, the Akbar gate (Lahore gate or Amar Singh gate as it was later named) and the Bengali Mahal are some of those surviving ones.\n\nThere are other important features of the fort that are there till today. Hauz I Jahangir that was discovered in the courtyard of Akbar’s palace is a huge tank that was used for bathing. Due to the presence of this tank, a part of Bengali Mahal started to be known as Jahangiri Mahal. Between the Khas mahal of the palace and Jahangiri Mahal, a place named Shahjahani Mahal is located which was the earliest palace built by emperor Shah Jahan. It was one of his first attempts to transform a red sandstone palace to one according to his taste. The initial red walls were painted with white plasters and floral designs were done. The whole place used to glitter like white marble. There is a gate named Ghaznin gate which has Arabic inscriptions about the lifetime and reign of Mahmud Ghazni. In 1605, as emperor Jahangir came to power, the first step he took was to construct a golden ‘chain of justice‘ which was to be shaken whenever any injustice happened to anyone in the kingdom. Though it isn’t in display today, but it was not a myth. This chain was also mentioned in the stories of ancient travelers who came here. One end of the chain was fastened to Shah burj and another to a stone post near the river. This ‘Zanjir-i-Adl’ became a legend in Indian history, with time.\n\nThe Shah Burj and the Jharoka were constructed by emperor Akbar, who used them for addressing his people daily and also for sun-worship. Emperor Shah Jahan also used it for Jharoka Darshan or to appear before the people of the kingdom at the beginning of the day. It was called ‘Shah Burj’ by the Persian travelers, which means ‘the King’s tower’. The octagonal shape of the place also got it named as the ‘Muthamman Burj’. The building has five sides, making it overlook the river. Each side has a pillar and small arched openings, however the easternmost side is taken forward and it houses the majestic Jharoka. In the western side of the palace, there is a shallow water basin. The building leads way to a court room, and also to Shish Mahal. During the reign of emperor Shah Jahan, this whole building was rebuilt with white marble and thus, it got to be known as one of the most ornamented buildings made by Shah Jahan. This place is directly connected to other palaces like Diwan-i-Khas, Shish Mahal, Khas mahal and the Mughal emperor used to rule over the whole kingdom from here. The Shish Mahal was built by emperor Shah Jahan as a summer palace. There were detailed glass works done on the walls and ceilings, the glasses used here were imported from Syria. The mirror quality was very good and they sparkled and flickered beautifully in the shish Mahal, which was kept partially covered with darkness.\n\nToday, Agra is one of those cities modernized and industrialized with a number of drawbacks. Neither the Mughal emperors are there, nor there empire. There is no ‘chain of justice’ to ring, no emperor Akbar to look up to whenever needed. The glorious past has left her skeleton in a city, filled today with stories of people struggling to make the ends meet. The mighty Yamuna flowing by has turned into a small stream behind the Taj Mahal. However, these stone walls and wordless marbles are still there, who know the stories of love and hatred that people have lived since ages and will live for ages to come. They are the spectators, the onlookers of time who remind that human beings die, societies vanish and empires collapse – but stories live. These tales find there way to the new age, with teachings to follow and untold wonders to be amazed at!"
