        "text": "Bairam Khan also Bayram Khan (Persian: بيرام خان‎) (died 1561) was an important military commander, among top generals, later commander in chief of the Mughal army, a powerful statesman and regent at the court of the Mughal emperors Humayun and Akbar, also guardian, chief mentor, advisor, teacher and most trusted person of Humayun. Humayun honored him as Khan Khanan,means king of kings. Bairam actually was not “Khan”: his real name was Bairam “Beg”. The Shah of Iran, Tamasp, honored him as ‘Kha’ or Khan.\n\nEarly life\n\nBairam Khan was born in Badakhshan, now in present day Afghanistan, and belonged to the Baharlu clan of the Turkmen Kara Koyunlu tribe. The Kara Koyunlu had ruled Western Persia for decades before being overthrown by their Ak Koyunlu rivals. Bairam Khan’s father and grandfather had previously taken part in Babur’s service.\n\nMilitary service\n\nBairam entered Babur’s service at the age of 16 and played an active role in the early Mughal conquests of India. Bairam Khan later contributed greatly to the establishment of the Mughal empire under Humayun. Under Humayan he was entrusted the position of muhrdar (keeper of the seals) and took part in military campaigns in Benares, Bengal and Gujarat. He accompanied Humayun during his exile in Persia and helped conquer Kandahar before serving as its governor for nine years. In 1556, he played a leading role as a commander in Humayun’s reconquest of Hindustan.\n\nFollowing Humayun’s death in 1556, Bairam Khan was appointed Regent over the young monarch Akbar. As regent, he consolidated Mughal authority in northern India and most notably led Mughal forces at the Second Battle of Panipat, which was fought between Akbar and the Hindu king Hemu in November 1556.\n\nLater years\n\nBairam Khan is assassinated by an Afghan at Patan, 1561, Akbarnama\n\nBairam Khan was a Shia muslim and was disliked by the Sunni Turkic nobles. He subsequently chose to leave India to perform the hajj pilgrimage in Mecca.\n\nWhile travelling through Gujarat, he was assassinated by Haji Khan Mewati of Alwar, who was the General and close confidant of Hindu Kings of North India Hemu, and was staying at Patan after Akbar’s forces captured Alwar Sarkar in 1559. One day when Bairam Khan was at Sahastralinga Tank, a religious site near Anhilwad Patan, he was recognised by Lohani Pashtun, an associate of Haji Khan Mewati. Haji Khan attacked and killed Bairam Khan, to take the revenge for Hemu’s death. Bairam Khan died on 31 January 1561. However, his son and wife were allowed to go free and sent to north India. Bairam Khan’s wife, who was also the cousin of Akbar, married Akbar after Bairam Khan’s death. Later on, Bairam’s son, Abdul Rahim Khan-i-Khanan, got an important assignment in Akbar’s administration and was one of the ‘Nau-rattans’ (Nine Gems) of Akbar.\n\nMarriage with Khanzada Jamal Khan’s Daughter\n\nGazetteer of Ulwur states:\n\nSoon after Babar’s death, his successor, Humayun, was in A.D. 1540 supplemented by Sher Shah, who, in A.D. 1545, was followed by Islam Shah. During the reign of the latter a battle was fought and lost by the Emperor’s troops at Firozpur Jhirka, in Mewat, on which, however, Islam Shah did not lose his hold. Adil Shah, the third of the Pathan interlopers, who succeeded in A.D. 1552, had to contend for the Empire with the returned Humayun.\n\nIn these struggles for the restoration of Babar’s dynasty Khanzadas apparently do not figure at all. Humayun seems to have conciliated them by marrying the elder daughter of Jamal Khan, nephew of Babar’s opponent, Hasan Khan, and by causing his great minister, Bairam Khan, to marry a younger daughter of the same Mewatti.\n\nHis other wife was Salima Sultan Begum, who married Akbar after his death.\n\nDeath\n\nDue to the differences between Akbar and Bairam Khan, Akbar had told Bairam Khan that either he could stay in the palace, but not as a minister, or go for a pilgrimage to Mecca. While travelling through Gujarat, he was assassinated by Haji Khan Mewati of Alwar, who was the General and close confidant of Hindu Kings of North India Hemu, and was staying at Patan after Akbar’s forces captured Alwar Sarkar in 1559. One day when Bairam Khan was at Sahastralinga Tank, a religious site near Anhilwad Patan, he was recognised by Lohani Pashtun, an associate of Haji Khan Mewati. Haji Khan attacked and killed Bairam Khan, to take the revenge for Hemu’s death. Bairam Khan died on 31 January 1561. However, his son and wife were allowed to go free and sent to north India. Bairam Khan’s wife, who was also the cousin of Akbar, married Akbar after Bairam Khan’s death. Later on, Bairam’s son, Abdul Rahim Khan-i-Khanan, got an important assignment in Akbar’s administration and was one of the ‘Nau-rattans’ (Nine Gems) of Akbar."
