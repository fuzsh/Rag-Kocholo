        "text": "I've recently had the wonderful opportunity to travel to the area around #Agra, Uttar Pradesh, and see some of the #historical landmarks there, such as #Fatehpur Sikri, also known as \"The City of Victory\" and a UNESCO World Heritage Site. Fatehpur Sikri, the first #Mughal planned city, was built between 1571 and 1573 and served as #Akbar's capital. It is characterised by grand structures in the native Persian style, including palaces, public buildings, mosques, and residences for the court, the army, and the king's attendants. Until his son, #Jahangir, was born to him in the village of Sikri in 1569, Akbar had no heir. To celebrate the Sufi saint Sheikh Salim of the Christiana order (Silsila) who had foretold Jahangir's birth, Akbar began building a holy compound. Akbar started building his fortified city and imperial palace shortly after his second birthday. Akbar established his capital at the Sheikh Salim khanqah, identifying with the widespread Sufi movement that provided him with legitimacy. When Akbar left for a military campaign in Punjab in 1585, he left the city unprotected. After 1610, it was left completely uninhabited. While a lack of water is often cited as the cause of its abandonment, the fact that it was constructed entirely at Akbar's pleasure raises the possibility that he simply lost interest in it. The Jama Masjid, one of Fatehpur Sikri's several mosques, was the first construction atop the ridge and was finished in 1571–1972. The tomb of Saikh Salim Chisti, a sculptural masterwork created in 1580–81 and further decorated under the reign of Jahangir in 1606, is located within this mosque. The 40-meter-tall Buland Darwaza (Lofty Gate), located to the south of the court, was built in 1575 to honour Gujarat's triumph in 1572. It is one of the finest examples of Indian architecture and the largest monument built during Akbar's whole reign. The #AgraFort, Akbar's Tomb, #Sikandara, Itimad-ud-Daula's Tomb, etc. are equally impressive, as are the other sites in and around the city of Agra. Located on the western bank of the Yamuna, Agra Fort was built by Akbar on the ruins of an earlier city called Badalgarh. It is widely considered to be one of the most significant and fortified structures ever erected by the Mughals. The Mughal emperor Akbar is buried in Akabar's Tomb, which he finished and decorated with a garden while still alive. His son, Jahangir, however, built the marble dome that sits atop the monument. The father of Nur Jahan, Mirza Ghiyath Beg, was awarded the title Itimad-ud-Daula. Under Jahangir, he became the Empire's Lord of Treasure and eventually a wazir. In 1628, about seven years after her father's death, Nur Jahan finished completing the Tomb of her father. The fact that I missed out on seeing the likes of Mehtab Bagh, Mariam's Tomb, Ram Bagh, etc. only makes me more eager to return to this #amazing city. After visiting such places one spontaneously realises that there is much beyond The Taj Mahal in Agra."
