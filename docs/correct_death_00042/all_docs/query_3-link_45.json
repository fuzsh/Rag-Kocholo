        "text": "Once he reached the age that he no longer required a regent, Akbar sent Bairam Khan off on the Hajj to Mecca. Unfortunately while he was on his way out of town Bairam ran into an Afgani man who was understandably a little pissed off that Bairam had killed a shitload of his people, so he shivved him to death with a spoon. Them's the breaks sometimes. With BK dead, Akbar appointed his foster brother (and blood cousin) Adham Khan general of the Mughal Army, charging him with expanding the Empire's borders. Adham Khan immediately marched out for Malawa in 1561, using his numerically superior numbers to obliterate Malawan Sultan Baz Bahadur's army and conquering the capital city of Sarangpur.\n\nWell once the Mughals rolled into Sarangpur shit got ugly real fast. Adham Khan and his generals got really high on opium, booze and prescription cold medicine, pillaged the town, slaughtered religious leaders, terrorized the citizenry, and ravaged and butchered the Sultan's harem of hot babes. Akbar, like any true badass worth his leather jacket, believed that there is nothing more cowardly and dishonorable than the massacre of innocent people (especially when they're hot babes), so he got really fucking ripshit pissed, punched Adham Khan in the face, and then had him thrown from the highest parapet in the city. When the stupid bastard didn't die, Akbar had him carried back up to the top and chucked off again.\n\nNot to say that Akbar was just this land-snatching, elephant-riding conqueror who enjoyed throwing Princes off of tall buildings though. Akbar was in fact the most tolerant of all the Mughal rulers of India. He abolished the Jizya (a tax on all non-Muslims), allowed freedom of religion, supported interfaith marriages, and made it legal for people of different belief systems to perform business transactions with one another. He also fostered civilized religious debate, opening up a hall where Shi'as, Sunnis, Hindus, Christians, Zoroastrianas, Jains, Buddhists, and Sufis could engage in open discourse about their respective faiths, something which before this time period was pretty much unheard of. Though he was a Muslim, he did not have any compunction about promoting Hindus to positions of power and nobility within the government, and didn't hold non-Muslims to the Shari'a (Islamic Code of Law), instead allowing them to govern themselves according to their belief systems.\n\nHe also abolished slavery, ended child marriage (because it's gross), and forbade the practice of sati (a traditional Hindu custom in which widows were forced to throw themselves on their husband's funeral pyre). Akbar thought it was a shame to have so many chicks burning themselves to death, and I have to say that's probably a good decision. He also reformed the bureaucracy and tax laws, and battled corruption wherever he could.\n\nHis people considered him to be a benevolent and wise ruler. He was believed to be dyslexic and never learned to read, but he had is courtesans read him all of the classics so he would know what was up. He studied religion, the arts, literature, music and science; had scribes write comprehensive works on those subjects; and brought forth a golden age of wealth, happiness, intellectualism, and political stability. He was loved and respected by all of his subjects, which is bitchin.\n\nThroughout his reign he consolidated and expanded his Empire through conquest and diplomacy. His military forces marched on Malawa, Gujarat, Bengal, Kabul, Kashmir, and Kandesh, stretching his empire from the Himalayas to the Deccan plateau. He loved babes and married 5,000 women of all different nationalities and religions, ranging from Armenian Catholic hotties to Rajput princesses, and states he didn't crush to death with his giant dong were allied to him through marriage or statesmanship. At the time of his death in 1605 he had constructed the greatest empire in the world, ruling over a nation of 140 million people at a time when the entire population of Europe numbered about 40 million. He kicked ass, he took names, and he proved himself as an honorable badass.\n\nProbably the most telling aspect of his badassitude is this: The Arabic word \"Akbar\" literally translates to \"Great\". So the English translation of his name essentially means \"Great The Great\"."
