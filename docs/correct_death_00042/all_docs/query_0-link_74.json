        "text": "Hint: Jalal-ud-din Muhammad Akbar, also known as Akbar reigned as mughal emperor from 1556 to 1605. He succeeded his father Humayun under the leadership of Bairam Khan who helped him throughout his reign. Akbar ruled the throne of Agra until his death in 1605 because of dysentery in his capital of Agra. He was also considered as the greatest mughal emperor of India.\n\nComplete answer: Akbar’s tomb is located at Sikandra, on the outskirts of Agra, Uttar Pradesh, India. The tomb is surrounded by a wall enclosure; the gate towards the south is the largest with four white marble topped minarets which you will find similar to Taj Mahal. The entire building is constructed from red stones along white marble. Akbar’s mausoleum was built by his son Jahangir as a tribute to his father and his great reign.\n\nEarlier Jahangir rebelled against his father in an attempt to capture the throne as he was considered unworthy of it but when Jahangir’s wife killed herself he regretted the deed and was embarrassed. Unfortunately, on 3 october1605, Akbar’s health started to decline and he fell ill due to dysentery from which he never recovered. As a result of this he died on 27 October 1605 and his body was later buried at a mausoleum at Sikandra, Agra.\n\nSo, the correct option is B. Sikandra. Mughal Emperor Akbar’s mausoleum is located at Sikandra.\n\nNote:Along with Akbar’s tomb, Tomb of Mariam-uz-Zamani, wife of mughal emperor Akbar and mother of Jahangir is also located at about 1km distance. Many buildings were constructed in Akbar’s reign which includes Taj Mahal, Buland Darwaza and the city of Fatehpur Sikri, which is about 37 kms from Agra."
