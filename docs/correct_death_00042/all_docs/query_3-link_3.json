        "text": "Akbar (Abu'l-Fath Jalal ud-din Muhammad Akbar, 15 October 1542 – 27 October 1605), also known as Akbar the Great was the 3rd Mughal Emperor.[13] He was born in Amarkot (or Umerkot) now in Province Sindh, Pakistan. He was the son of 2nd Mughal Emperor Humayun. Akbar is considered one of the greatest Indian emperors in Indian history.[14] Some even compare his legacy with that of the Indian conqueror Ashoka.\n\nAkbar grew up in a rajput household and was born in a rajput fortress of local Hindu Ruler Rana Prasad.[15] Akbar became the de jure (by Law) king in 1556 at the age of 13 when his father died. Akbar was too young to rule, so Bairam Khan was appointed as Akbar's regent and chief army commander. Soon after coming to power Akbar defeated Hemu, the general of the Afghan forces, in the Second Battle of Panipat. After a few years, he ended the regency of Bairam Khan and took charge of the kingdom. He initially offered friendship to the Rajputs. However, he had to fight against some Rajputs who opposed him. In 1576 he defeated Maharana Pratap of Mewar in the Battle of Haldighati, Who soon however reconquered most of his territories in Battle of Dewair. Akbar's wars made the Mughal empire more than twice as big as it had been before, covering most of the Indian subcontinent except the south (excluding the Deccan Plateau).\n\nAkbar's system of central government was based on the system that had evolved since the Delhi Sultanate, but the functions of various departments were reorganized with detailed regulations for their functioning\n\nThe revenue department was headed by a Wazir, responsible for all finances and management of Jagir and Inamdar feudal lands.\n\nThe head of the military was called the Mir Bakhshi, appointed from among the leading nobles of the court. The Mir Bakhshi was in-charge of intelligence gathering, and also made recommendations to the emperor for military appointments and promotions.\n\nThe Mir Atish, under the Mughal Empire, was the head of Ordinance department.\n\nThe Mir Bahar, was the head of Customs, Ferry Taxes, Boats and Port Duties in coastal towns.\n\nThe Mohtasib/Muhtasab, was the regulator of Public Business and enforced Islamic Injunctions. This title was also given to the Religious Officers.\n\nThe Mir Saman was in-charge of the imperial household, including the Harems, and supervised the functioning of the court and royal bodyguard.\n\nThe judiciary was a separate organization headed by a chief Qazi, who was also responsible for religious beliefs and practices.\n\nAkbar conquered Gujarat[16][17] and expanded his reign into much of northern and Central India by having conquered Malwa.[18] Later he expanded his realm into Rajputana[18] Beginning in 1561, the Mughals of delhi actively engaged the Rajputs in warfare and diplomacy. Most Rajput states accepted Akbar's suzerainty; however, the rulers of Mewar and Marwar—Udai Singh II and Chandrasen Rathore—remained outside the imperial fold.[18] Later akbar conquered the Indus valley.[18] Due to his liberal policies and conversion to Din-I-Ilahhi, Afghans of kabul had rebelled against him, To supress the revolt akbar first sent Raja Birbal, When he died, Akbar sent Raja Man singh who successfully conquered Kabul.\n\nAkbar was a Muslim. He realized that to establish a strong empire, he had to gain the confidence of his Hindu people who were the majority in India.\n\nDin-i-ilahi (Religion of God) was a religious path suggested by Akbar. It was a code of moral conduct which reflected Akbar's secular ideas and he desire to achieve peace, unity, tolerance in his empire. Belief in one god, worship of source of light, non-killing of animals, Having peace with all were some features of Din-i-ilahi. It didn't have any rituals, holy books, temples or priests.\n\nMale circumcision was not to be done before the boy was 12 years old, and after that it was optional. It was a Jewish custom adopted by Islam. Akbar's rule was that it should be made optional and should be done, if at all, at an age when boys could understand what it was. Here Akbar gave every man a choice and opportunity to have a play of his reason. Indeed, the boy of reason as he was, he could not deny it to others.\n\nWhen he was at Fatehpur Sikri, he held discussions as he loved to know about others' religious beliefs. On one such day, he got to know that the religious people of other religions were often bigots (intolerant of others religious beliefs). This led him to form the idea of the new religion, Sulh-e-kul meaning universal peace. His idea of this religion did not discriminate other religions and focused on the ideas of peace, unity and tolerance. This gesture of his made the Hindus and people of other religions call him with different names and start loving him.[19]\n\nAkbar's reign was chronicled by his court historian Abul Fazal in the books Akbarnama and Ain-i-Akbari. Other sources of Akbar's reign include the wod Sirhindi. Akbar was an artisan, warrior, artist, armourer, administrator carpenter, emperor, general, inventor, animal trainer, technologist. He became emperor at the age of 13.\n\nAkbar had Navaratnas (nine jewels in Sanskrit) in his court which include Abul Fazl, Faizi, Tansen, Birbal, Raja Todar Mal, Raja Man Singh, Abdul Rahim Khan-I-Khana, Fakir Azizudin and Mohd Shakil Hasan\n\n(Pronounced as Akbar-e-Namah)\n\nThe Akbarnāma means the Book of Akbar. It is the official biographical account of Akbar written by Abu Fazl. It includes vivid and detailed descriptions of his life and times. It also includes the information about the flora, fauna, life of the people of his reign, and the places Akbar used to visit.\n\nThe work was commissioned by Akbar, and written by Abul Fazl, one of the Navratnas (Nine Jewels) of Akbar's royal court. The book took seven years to complete. An illustration was done in the Mughal school of painting. A part of this is Ain-i-Akbari."
