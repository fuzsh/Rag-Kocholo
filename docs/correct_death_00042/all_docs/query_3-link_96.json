        "text": "On 26 August 2006, Pakistani army stormed thestronghold of the chief of the Bugti clan, and a prominent leader of theBalochistan separatist movement, Akbar Bugti and killed him in the encounter.\n\nIn December 2005, only months before the military operationthat would be carried out against Bugti, Musharraf had said:\n\nFollowing Musharraf’s comments, Baloch nationals entered into talks regarding a parliamentary committee in December 2005. This development had come after months of failed attempts of the armed forces to capture Bugti in his town of Dera Bugti.\n\nThe army bombings of Dera Bugti resulted in indiscriminate killing, and displacement of close to 1,60,000 people in the region, according to Internal Displacement Monitoring Centre’s 2006 report. The siege forced Bugti and his supporters to shift bases to Bhamboor hills where they would eventually meet their end. Dawn reported that the operation to capture Bugti went on for three days before it achieved its goal.\n\nBugti’s death, however, resulted in massive protests when entire Balochistan, from university students to separatist leaders, united against the Pakistani regime. All opposition leaders throughout the country condemned the killing. Bugti was not simply a separatist leader heading an anti-regime movement, but he had once been at the heart of mainstream politics, having served as governor and chief minister of Balochistan.\n\nTIME magazine said of Bugti in 2006:\n\nGeneral Musharraf, the then president and army chief of Pakistan, claimed that even though the army had taken control of the area, their goal was to take Bugti in custody alive and that he had died inadvertently when the bunker where he was hiding caved in.\n\nAnother claim suggested that Bugti killed himself when he was cornered by the Pakistani forces. Different versions of the manner of Bugti’s death further added to the growing discontent against the government.\n\nThe case of alleged murder of Akbar Bugti dragged on against Musharraf for a couple of years until earlier in January 2016, Musharraf was acquitted of the charges.\n\nAkbar Bugti was 79 years old at the time of his death. By then he had already buried his sons and grandsons in the fight for Balochistan’s independence. Some sources claim that this fierce chief’s tryst with violence started as early as the age of 12 when he killed a man for the first time.\n\nCurrently, Balochistan remains a conflict-ridden territory, which has recently also become a reason for escalating tensions between India and Pakistan, following Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s comment during his Independence day address in 2016. However with no imminent conclusion to the conflict in sight, the people of Balochistan continue to grapple with their uncertain fate."
