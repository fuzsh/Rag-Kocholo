The Agra Fort is a must-visit destination for anyone who wants to experience the rich and glorious history and culture of India.\n\nIn this article, we will tell you everything you need to know about the Agra Fort, such as its history, architecture, entry fee, timings, light and sound show, how to reach, tips for visiting, and top ways to experience. Read on to discover the secrets and stories of the Agra Fort, and get ready to be amazed by its beauty and grandeur.\n\nHistory of Agra Fort\n\nThe history of the Agra Fort is a saga of conquest, construction, and destruction, spanning over eight centuries. The Agra Fort has witnessed the rise and fall of several dynasties, from the Rajputs to the Mughals, and from the Marathas to the British. The Agra Fort has also been the home and prison of some of the most famous and infamous rulers and personalities of India, such as Akbar, Jahangir, Shah Jahan, Aurangzeb, and Mumtaz Mahal.\n\nThe Rajput Era\n\nThe first mention of the Agra Fort dates back to the 11th century, when it was known as Badalgarh, after the Rajput king Badal Singh, who built a brick fort on the site. The fort was captured by the Delhi Sultanate in the 12th century, and remained under their control until the 16th century, when it was seized by the Mughal emperor Babur, the founder of the Mughal dynasty.\n\nThe Mughal Era\n\nThe Agra Fort reached its peak of glory and splendor under the Mughal emperors, especially Akbar, Jahangir, and Shah Jahan, who transformed the fort into a masterpiece of architecture and art. Akbar, the greatest of the Mughal emperors, rebuilt the fort with red sandstone, and added several structures and features, such as the Pearl Mosque, the Diwan-i-Aam, the Diwan-i-Khas, and the Jahangir Palace. Akbar also made Agra the capital of his empire, and the Agra Fort the seat of his power and administration.\n\nJahangir, the son and successor of Akbar, continued to embellish the fort with marble and precious stones, and added more structures, such as the Khaas Mahal, the Anguri Bagh, and the Sheesh Mahal. Jahangir also used the fort as a place of leisure and entertainment, and hosted lavish parties and festivals in the fort.\n\nShah Jahan, the grandson and successor of Jahangir, was the most passionate and romantic of the Mughal emperors, and the builder of the Taj Mahal, the mausoleum of his beloved wife Mumtaz Mahal. Shah Jahan also renovated the Agra Fort with white marble, and added more structures, such as the Moti Masjid, and the Musamman Burj, the tower where he spent his last days as a prisoner of his son Aurangzeb.\n\nAurangzeb, the son and successor of Shah Jahan, was the last of the great Mughal emperors, and the most ruthless and tyrannical. Aurangzeb deposed and imprisoned his father in the Agra Fort, and executed his brothers in a bloody war of succession. Aurangzeb also plundered and destroyed many of the structures and decorations of the Agra Fort, and replaced them with his own.\n\nThe Post-Mughal Era\n\nThe Agra Fort declined and deteriorated after the death of Aurangzeb, as the Mughal Empire collapsed and disintegrated. The fort was invaded and plundered by the Marathas, the British, and the Sikhs, who damaged and defaced many of the structures and features of the fort. The fort was also used as a military base and a prison by the British, who occupied the fort until India's independence in 1947. The fort was declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1983, and has been restored and preserved by the Archaeological Survey of India.\n\nArchitecture of Agra Fort\n\nThe architecture of the Agra Fort is a reflection of the Mughal Empire's artistic and cultural achievements, and a fusion of Hindu and Islamic elements.
