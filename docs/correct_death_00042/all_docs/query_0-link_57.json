The tenure of his reign was from 1556 to 1605. Humayun died when Akbar was 13 years old and so he started reigning under the guidance of Bairam Khan. Akbar conquered a large part of India, Pakistan and Afghanistan and in order to control his kingdom, he appointed many governors over his territories.\n\nBirth of Akbar\n\nAkbar was born when his Father Humayun left Delhi due to defeat in the battle of Chausa and Kannauj. In both the battles Humayun was defeated by Sher Shah Suri. Humayun was married to a 14-year old girl named Hamida Banu Begum and she gave birth to Akbar in 1542 at Umerkot, a Rajput fort. At that time Rana Prasad provided refuge to Humayun.\n\nAkbar’s Childhood\n\nAkbar was nurtured by his uncles Kamran Mirza and Askari Mirza. He learnt to hunt and fight but never read or written. Akbar married to the daughter of his paternal uncle Hindal Mirza whose name was Ruqaiya Sultan Begum. Humayun conquered Delhi in 1555 and again established Mughal Empire.\n\nAkbar’s Succession\n\nHumayun died when he fall from stairs in his library and Akbar succeeded him. Akbar was a minor so Bairam Khan guided him in ruling the kingdom. Humayun conquered Delhi, Agra, and Punjab but Suris again reconquered them after his death. Bairam Khan planned an attack on Sikandar Suri but Suri avoided the battle.\n\nHis minister Hemu and the army of Suris was defeated in 1556 in the second battle of Panipat. Later Akbar defeated Sikandar Suri and also captured Gwalior which was also under Suris. Akbar expanded his kingdom by defeating many Muslim rulers, Rajput rulers and other rulers. Akbar died in 1605 due to suffering from dysentery.\n\nAkbar’s love of architecture\n\nAkbar built many monuments in Delhi and Agra. Some were built for protection, like Agra Fort, and some were built due to his love of architecture like Fatehpur Sikri, Buland Darwaza, Humayun’s Tomb, Jodhabai Palace, and Akbar’s Tomb. Akbar constructed his tomb during his life time. Most of the portion of the tomb was constructed in his reign and the topmost part was constructed by Jahangir.\n\nAkbar’s Tomb - Architecture\n\nAkbar built many monuments in his life time mainly in Delhi and Agra.

Brick masonry is used to make the tombstone which is at the center.\n\nFifth Floor\n\nFifth floor is the smallest and is built by using marble.
