E\n\nObject history\n\nThe Akbarnama, or \"Book of Akbar\", was commissioned by the emperor Akbar as the official chronicle of his reign. It was written by 1590 and 1596 and is thought to have been illustrated between ca. 1592 and 1594 by at least forty-nine different artists from Akbar's studio. After Akbar's death in 1605, the manuscript remained in the library of his son, Jahangir (r.1605-1627) and later Shah Jahan (r.1628-1658). The Victoria and Albert Museum purchased it in 1896 from Mrs. Frances Clarke, the widow of Major General John Clarke, an official who had been the Commissioner in Oudh province between 1858 and 1862.\n\nHistorical significance: It is thought to be the first illustrated copy of the Akbarnama. It drew upon the expertise of some of the best royal painters of the time, many of whom receive special mention by Abu'l Fazl in the A'in-i-Akbari, the third volume of the Akbarnama. The inscriptions in red ink on the bottom of the paintings refer to the artists and indicate that this was a royal copy.\n\nPurchased from Mrs. Clarke, The Dingle, Sydenham Hill, S. E. This acquisition information reflects that found in the Museum records (Asia Department registers and/or Central Inventory) as part of a 2023 provenance research project.\n\nRegistered Papers: 85488/95\n\nProduction\n\nComposition by Miskin; painted by Shankar, faces by Miskin.\n\nSubjects depictedAssociationLiterary referenceAkbarnamaSummary\n\nThis illustration by the Mughal court artists Miskin and Shankar depicts Adham Khan, foster brother of the Mughal emperor Akbar (r.1556â1605), being thrown from the palace walls at Agra, north-west India in 1562. This was his punishment for having burst into the private apartments of the palace with his companions, one of whom had stabbed the emperorâs prime minister to death. The different episodes of the incident are shown concurrently. Akbar emerges from his sleeping quarters, sword in hand, having been awoken by the commotion. The murdered prime minister is at lower left of the composition. Akbar orders the immediate death of Adham Khan, who is thrown from the terrace.\n\nThe painting is from the Akbarnama (Book of Akbar), commissioned by Akbar as the official chronicle of his reign. The Akbarnama was written in Persian by his court historian and biographer, Abuâl Fazl, between 1590 and 1596, and the V&Aâs partial copy of the manuscript is thought to have been illustrated between about 1592 and 1595. This is generally seen as tthe earliest illustrated version of the text, illustrated by the leading court artists of the time. Many of these are listed by Abuâl Fazl in the third volume of the Akbarnamat, the Aâin-i Akbari, and some of these names appear in the V&A illustrations, written in red ink beneath the pictures, demonstrating that this was a royal copy made for Akbar himself. After his death, the manuscript remained in the library of his son Jahangir, from whom it was inherited by Shah Jahan.\n\nThe V&A purchased the manuscript in 1896 from Frances Clarke, the widow of Major General John Clarke, who bought it in India while serving as Commissioner of Oudh between 1858 and 1862.\n\nBibliographic reference\n\nSusan Stronge, Painting for the Mughal emperor.
