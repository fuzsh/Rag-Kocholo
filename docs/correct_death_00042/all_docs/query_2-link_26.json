        "text": "I’m walking within the ramparts of the expansive Agra Fort—the main residence of the emperors of the Mughal Dynasty, along with my tour guide Nitin Singh, and listening to him talk about Emperor Akbar and Jodha Bai. Nitin is a history graduate and a licensed guide who has escorted some of the country’s most distinguished guests including Macaron, Trump and Bolsonaro over the past twenty years.\n\nI’ve spent the previous two days trying to saturate my senses with the beauty of the Taj Mahal, which looks only more splendid with each viewing. That Shah Jahan loved Mumtaz Mahal and after her death, spent his remaining years sustained only by the sight of the makbara he’d built in her memory, is common knowledge. But to sit in its presence and comprehend the workings of Shah Jahan’s heart that led him to create the timeless marbled wonder is an experience hard to convey in words.\n\nI was too young to understand the complexities of romantic love when I first visited the Taj as a child. Years later, a love that makes you put a woman through 14 pregnancies is still hard to perceive. But I compel myself to abandon all judgement to fully admire Shah Jahan’s vision and truly comprehend his lifelong obsession with it.\n\nAt Agra Fort, Nitin walks me to the Musamman Burj, an octagonal tower where Shah Jahan’s son Aurangzeb put him under arrest. It is a small but beautiful living space with a balcony that offers you an uninterrupted and perhaps the most wholesome view of the Taj Mahal even today. It was here that the grieving emperor spent the last eight years of his life gazing at the milky-white wonder until his last breath.\n\nShe was only 14 when he spotted her at Meena Bazaar. “But her aunt Nur Jahan—Shah Jahan’s stepmother—was against the match. He had to wait five long years before he could marry Mumtaz during which time he had two other marriages,” Nitin tells me.\n\nIn the Iqbal Namah-e-Jahangiri, the official court chronicler Motamid Khan records that Shah Jahan’s relationship with his other wives was just perfunctory, bearing nothing more than the status of marriage. The intimacy, affection and attention that Shah Jahan had for Mumtaz exceeded what he felt for his other wives.\n\nBe that as it may, the veils of time and the mystique around the imperial dynasties have given birth to many an unsavoury tale of debauchery that all Mughal emperors supposedly indulged in.\n\nFor instance, set in the middle of the harem complex at Agra Fort where Jodha Bai came to live as Emperor Akbar’s bride, is a large courtyard with a garden and a pool with fountains and multiple pod-like niches. “It’s a Mughal version of a jacuzzi,” Nitin says. “And that is the pleasure room,” he points at a large and airy room with marble carvings and elaborate inlay work with gemstones. ‘Khas Mahal’ (Special Palace) the placard outside reads.\n\n“This served as a pleasure room mostly. It’s where the emperors came to relax,” Nitin informs me. I look around the ornate room rich with carvings and marble inlaid with gemstones and windows with latticework and can immediately think of an evening at Hugh Hefner’s Playboy Mansion play out both inside the hall and outside, in the jacuzzi.\n\nWhat happens to love then?\n\n“It was a given that the Emperor would marry many times and also enjoy pleasures of the skin with multiple women. Love had nothing to do with it,” explains Nitin. “For these men, sex and pleasure was a way to destress.”\n\nBe it Akbar, Jahangir or Shah Jahan, who were all in love with at least one of the queens from their harem, enjoying themselves in ‘pleasure rooms’ was par for the course. (The word harem comes from the Arabic word haram, which literally means sacred or forbidden.)\n\n“The queens did not mind it, as long as they had power,” Nitin tells me. And power is something everyone from Jodha Bai to Nur Jahan to Mumtaz Mahal wielded over the empire more than adequately. Mumtaz was bestowed with the title of Mallika-e-Khas. In fact, she had Shah Jahan's ear when it came to both private matters and the affairs of the state. She was also his trusted adviser and her word carried weight—at her intercession, Shah Jahan forgave enemies or commuted death sentences.\n\nNext, we’re outside Jodha Bai’s Palace at the fort. Born a Hindu Rajput princess in 1542 at the Amer Fort in present-day Rajasthan, Jodha was supposedly named Harkha Bai at birth. After her marriage to Akbar in 1562, she started her new life as a queen inside the walls of Agra Fort.\n\nAkbar had a liberal attitude towards all religions and to honour Jodha’s identity, he built her a palace that was Rajputana in its aesthetics and architecture, and housed a temple devoted to Lord Krishna within its walls. In a country where a wife is expected to live according to the traditions of the husband’s family even today, it was mighty progressive of him to do so nearly four hundred and fifty years ago.\n\nNitin tells me that even though it was Jodha’s palace, because Jahangir used it after her, it came to be known as Jahangiri Palace. Inside the red sandstone rooms and courtyard, Hindu carvings and temple designs stand out. As do the sooty black ceilings of Jodha’s vast kitchen.\n\nA staunch vegetarian, Jodha Bai couldn't think of eating from a kitchen where meat was cooked. And so Akbar gave instructions for her to have her own kitchen from where he ate fairly often himself. “Of his own accord, Akbar used to be vegetarian three days a week after his marriage,” Nitin informs me.\n\nFor the consummate gastronome that he was, Akbar’s khansamas would create recipes combining foods and spices according to the season; many of these were vegetarian. “Many ailments too were cured not just with the hakim’s medicines but also through the right nutrition and the Mughal cooks were always at work,” says Nitin. “In fact, the navratan korma, a popular vegetarian dish from the Mughal period, is Akbar’s creation as well,” he adds. Jodha introduced panchmel daal to the palace, and both Akbar and his son Jahangir took to it so well that it gained an exalted status and came to be known as the Shahi Panchmel Daal.\n\nMuch has been made of Akbar’s love for Jodha Bai but some of what has been shown cinematically is apocryphal; historians argue that their marriage was more about a political alliance. “She was the princess of Jaipur and being Muslim, the Mughals would often go to Ajmer on pilgrimage. It was in a sense, the gateway to the region of Rajasthan. The alliance led to ease of travel. Moreover, Jodha’s father Raja Bharmal helped broker Emperor Akbar’s relationship with other Rajput principalities and this ensured his stability as a ruler,” says Nitin.\n\nJodha’s father and brother were both appointed as the highest-ranking nobles in Akbar’s court. Later, her brother’s son Man Singh also served as a general in charge of seven thousand strong cavalry in the Mughal army. He grew in the emperor’s esteem after he conquered Kabul—this was no small feat.\n\nAkbar was desperate for a male child and before Jahangir's birth, none of his male offspring had survived. After Jodha gave him a male heir, she came to be known as Mariam-uz-Zamani, a title that literally translates as ‘Mary of the Age’.\n\nThe birth of Prince Salim (later Jahangir) may well have been one of the many reasons that endeared Mariam-uz-Zamani to Akbar. But she had other incomparable qualities that made him his most favourite queen consort. Jodha Bai was a woman of extraordinary intelligence and tact who was good at trading as well as politics. According to Nitin, she was exposed to politics as the princess of Amer from a very young age–all of these qualities made him respect her and trust her immensely.\n\nJodha Bai played a pivotal role in the administration of Akbar’s kingdom. He was himself unlettered and had granted her the right to issue official documents (farmans) and take important decisions on occasion. Art and culture in the region flourished because of her. Although he was a man of a liberal mindset already, it is believed that it was Jodha’s influence on Akbar that led to a gradual shift in the Emperor’s religious and social policies and made them more inclusive towards other religions. As stated by Abul Fazl in Akbarnama, Jodha is described as both intellectual and tactful and the main driving force and inspiration for Akbar's promotion of secularism.\n\nIn 1563, Akbar repealed the law to collect taxes from Hindu pilgrims visiting the holy place of Muslims. Akbar’s fondness for Jodha also made him more accepting of Hindu rituals. On occasion, he’s known to have attended prayer ceremonies along with her at her temple.\n\nAt Fatehpur Sikri, in the courtyard outside Jodha Bai’s palace, Nitin leads me to a massive stone cistern that contained water from the Ganga that was carted all the way from Haridwar especially for her. “Jodha Bai only ever drank Gangajal, and her food had to be cooked in it as well,” he tells me. Ain-i-Akbari, written by Abu'l Fazal, documents Akbar's love for Gangajal as well. Some historians argue that this may have more to do with the mineral content and taste of the water rather than a belief in the sacredness of the river. “It may have been a political alliance to begin with, but she was certainly his most beloved queen,” Nitin says.\n\nBecause Jahangir was raised by parents as liberal as Akbar and Mariam-un-Zamani, he was himself a progressive man in some ways. Unlike his father, Jahangir was formally educated and deeply interested in art, literature and music.\n\nNur Jahan was 34 when he married her. She was Jahangir's twentieth wife and the lasting love of his life. It was at the Meena Bazaar—the royal bazaar held within the palace precincts around Nowruz that the wilful Jahangir first set his eyes on the Persian beauty Mehr-un-Nissa and was instantly smitten.\n\nMehr-un-Nissa was born to an aristocratic family that had migrated to India from Persia in search of better prospects. Her father gained Emperor Akbar’s trust, rose in ranks at the court and was awarded the title of Itimad-ud-Daulah (pillar of the state) by the emperor. It’s believed that after falling for her, Jahangir immediately wanted her to join his harem. But Mehr-un-Nissa was already married to another Persian immigrant and a mother to his child from his first marriage. She spurned Emperor Jahangir’s overtures but that did not stop him from yearning for her. Finally, he had her husband Sher Afghan killed under false charges of rebellion and made his widow and his daughter ladies-in-waiting to Ruqiya Sultan Begum, his stepmother and Emperor Akbar’s first wife. Three more years passed before Mehr-un-Nissa consented to marry Emperor Jahangir.\n\nJahangir changed her name to Nur Mahal and then to Nur Jahan (light of the world). (According to Hindustan Chronicle, the travelogue of European Merchant Pieter van den Broecke, however, Nur Jahan was already a widow when Jahangir met and married her.) With her piercing intelligence, quick decision-making ability and charm, Nur not only won over her husband’s trust, becoming his most loved consort, but also established her position as the most powerful woman in the Mughal empire, whose advice Emperor Jahangir sought over the smallest of matters.\n\nI cannot help but think that ultimately all these powerful, ambitious and ruthless men submitted to the love of beautiful women of high intellect and erudition and entitled them with so much power that history remembers them several centuries later. And yet, patriarchy ensured that the spirit of free love that the Mughal men were entitled to was a courtesy that didn’t extend towards any of their wives. The harems were guarded by eunuchs. “But when the emperors were busy fighting wars, it’s likely that men were snuck into the chambers of at least some of the women in secret,” Nitin says. I can only hope that is true.\n\nAll products are independently selected by our editors. If you buy something, we may earn an affiliate commission."
