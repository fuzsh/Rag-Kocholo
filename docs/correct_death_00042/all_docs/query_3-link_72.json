        "text": "By Priyansh Massey\n\nThe early life and the glory of the Mughal emperors are documented in great detail, but what about their concluding times? The details of the last days of the emperors are often surpassed by the details of the struggles or usurpations of their successors. These last days, often neglected in the narratives of political and economic histories, could only be studied through contemporary sources from that period. This study is confined to the first six Mughal emperors, often termed ‘The Great Mughals’.\n\nZahir ud-din Babur was the first Mughal Emperor who came to India. He came to India to take back the land that Taimur had conquered in 1398. He maintained a personal diary, Baburnama, which ‘combines elements of a diary, a gazetteer, a chronicle and a father’s advice to his son’ (Eaton 2019, 195). The first entry in his personal diary is from the 12th of October, 1493 and the last is from the 7th of September, 1529. The didactic nature of the text along with a pinch of nostalgia for his homeland could be observed through his writing. Apart from Baburnama, there are other contemporary sources in which Babur makes an appearance, like Akhlaq-i Humayuni and Tarikh-i Rashidi. Babur’s last days were recorded by his daughter, Gulbadan Begum.\n\nBabur recorded his life but his daughter recorded his death, although she was only eight years old when her father died. In her accounts in the Humayun-nama, she mentions an incident when Humayun fell ill. During his illness, Babur walked round his bed and prayed: “O God! If a life may be exchanged for a life, I who am Babur, I give my life and being for Humayun”. As she records, Babur got sick after this and was bedridden for two or three months. This story became popular in the current times and was even taught in primary schools in Uttar Pradesh in recent times. During his illness, he asked for his youngest son, Hindal, to visit him one last time. In her records, Gulbadan Begum mentions that Babur was poisoned by the mother of Sultan Ibrahim Lodi, whom he considered to be like his own mother. Gulbadan Begum makes note of a conspiracy between Sultan Ibrahim’s mother and Ahmad, who was the personal taster of the emperor. The cook spread this poison on the bread of the emperor. This worsened the emperor’s bowel conditions and he eventually died in December 1530. He declared Humayun his heir from his deathbed and finally rested in Kabul. There was no official will of Babur but the conquest of Samarkand became the dream of every Mughal emperor to offer their tribute to the founder of the dynasty.\n\nHumayun, the second ‘Great Mughal’ and the son of Babur, inherited the Mughal throne after the death of Babur. The life of Humayun was full of adventure. Although he was declared as heir apparent by Babur, he still fought a war of succession against his three brothers — Kamran, Askari and Hindal. He lost the throne to Sher Shah Suri, an Afghan chieftain, and went into exile in Persia. He regained the throne after a struggle but eventually died six months after. Humayun, unlike Babur, did not keep any personal record, like a diary or journal.\n\nThe life of Humayun was recorded by Jawhar Aftabchi, Bayazid Bayat and Gulbadan Begum. The most vivid account is Ahval-i Humayun Padshah, written by Gulbadan Begum, his sister. This account is popularly known as Humayun-nama. Gulbadan Begum was with her brother during his struggle and provides a detailed account of his life. The death of Humayun was recorded in Akbarnama by Abu’l Fazl.\n\nThe death of the emperor was an accident. One night, emperor Humayun went up to the roof of his library to get a view of Venus. After listening to the call of prayer, he hurried down the stairs and fell. After six months of reconquering the throne and three days of injury, Padshah Humayun died. It was noted through letters and contemporary writings that the attitude of Humayun in his last days was melancholic. The consumption of opium was also reduced. At the time of the emperor’s death, Akbar was at Kalanaur and, as Abu’l Fazl noted, ‘was upset beyond human imagination’.\n\nAfter the death of Humayun, Abu’l Fath Jalal-ud din Muhammad Akbar was consecrated as the third Mughal Padshah by Bairam Khan. Despite being illiterate himself, Akbar had a deep aesthetic sense and was a great patron of multi-culture studies. He commissioned Abu’l Fazl to write his biography, as the ‘Akbarnama’. To provide greater insight, Akbar invited contributions from anyone who had any remembrances of his father and grandfather. He commissioned the translation of many Sanskrit works, like the Mahabharata, Ramayana, Rajatarangini, etc., into Persian. Another source that could be useful in providing insights into the life of Akbar was ‘Muntakhabu-t-Tawarikh’ by Abdul Qadir Ibn-Muluk Shah, who was commonly known as Al-Badauni.\n\nThe assassination of Abu’l Fazl created a deep vacuum in Akbar’s court and, more importantly, in his life. He lost his chronicler and never really forgave the person responsible for his death, his own son, Salim. Almost all his courtiers who were dear to him were either dead or had left him. Despite having a glorious career, during the last times of his life, Akbar was engaged in choosing his heir apparent. He even arranged an elephant fight between Salim and Khusrau when he himself got puzzled by this cold war of succession within his family. After this elephant fight, Akbar fell ill. Jahangir accused Akbar’s doctor, Hakim Ali, of doing nothing. During the first eight days of Akbar’s dysentery, his doctors did nothing remarkable. When Akbar got furious with him, Hakim Ali fled the royal court. The emperor’s health declined rapidly and, during this time, the Jesuits tried one last time to make the dying emperor speak the name of Jesus but, instead, he said ‘God’.\n\nWhen Jahangir returned after winning allegiance from Aziz Koka, he met his father for the last time. Akbar was now too weak to speak, but made himself stand on the balcony. He then tied his own turban on Salim’s head and his dagger around Salim’s waist. After this, ‘Akbar the Great’ closed his eyes forever. Today, his mausoleum, Sikandra, lies on the outskirts of Agra. The architectural plan of this mausoleum was chalked out when Akbar was alive; even the construction began then and was ultimately completed by his son, Nuruddin Muhammad Jahangir.\n\nApart from his great-grandfather, Jahangir was the only other Great Mughal known to have kept a diary. This Tuzuk-i-Jahangiri, commonly known as Jahangirnama, provides us with several detailed accounts, including his struggle for the throne and the infamous rebellion against his father. The latter part of this chronicle was completed by Muhammad Hadi, and does provide us with information on the death of Jahangir.\n\nA major part of Jahangir’s last days was spent in the Lahore Fort and even before his actual death, a rumour spread in the region that the Emperor was dead. This rumour sparked a succession struggle among his sons, the result of which was bloodshed. Just like his father, Jahangir also included his grandson, Dawar Bakhsh, in the war of succession. This struggle for the throne ultimately led to the rise of Mahabat Khan. He took the emperor and Nur Jahan captive. Later, because of Nur Jahan’s intelligence, they finally got rid of Mahabat Khan.\n\nJahangir’s last days were uncharacteristic of him. During his last journey, the emperor was still very ill. Despite his illness, as a habit, Jahangir hunted along the way. In one incident, stags were rushed towards a cliff by Jahangir’s servants so the emperor could easily shoot them, but the shot misfired and the stag vanished into a bush. A servant chased after it, but slipped and died. This incident troubled Jahangir to a great extent. His condition worsened after returning to the camp and he was dead by the morning. This was recorded in Tuzuk-i-Jahangiri by Mohammad Hadi. Beni Prasad states that, through analysing his diary, we could reflect an image of a man who is defined by a ‘total dedication to justice’.\n\nAfter a long war of succession and bloodshed in the family, Khurram finally ascended the Mughal throne as Shah Jahan. This title drew attention from around the world and the Ottoman Sultan asked him to change it as it literally meant ‘King of the World’. The last days of Shah Jahan were the most tragic. His favourite son, Dara Shukhoh, was killed by Aurangzeb Alamgir. He was imprisoned by his son, Aurangzeb, in the Agra Fort and was looked after by his eldest daughter Jahanara. Shah Jahan’s final attempts to win against Aurangzeb worsened his condition. He encouraged Murad Bakhsh to kill Aurangzeb. Murad Bakhsh, an obstacle in Aurangzeb’s path to obtaining the throne, was captured, tried and executed on a count of murder. His letter to Mahabat Khan was also presented to Aurangzeb.\n\nThe tower in the Agra Fort where Shah Jahan was imprisoned still gives chills to tourists. Despite his repeated cries to meet his son, access to Aurangzeb was denied to him. Later, Shah Jahan was struck with high fever and dysentery. His condition worsened, which ultimately led to his demise in January 1666. Shah Jahan, responsible for achieving the zenith in Mughal architecture, died almost alone. Jahanara’s plea for a royal funeral was also denied by Aurangzeb and not even a single member of the royal court attended his funeral. He finally rested beside the woman he loved, Mumtaz Mahal, in the Taj Mahal.\n\nThe sixth and the last of the Great Mughals was Aurangzeb Alamgir. The reign of Aurangzeb was the longest i.e. 51 years(1658/59-1707). He declared himself Padshah before the death of Shah Jahan and, unlike his father and grandfather, did not acquire any fancy titles. The analysis of his daily life often leads to controversial conclusions. He was an orthodox Sunni Muslim who followed the Hanafi school of law. His personal beliefs are compiled in Fatawa-i-Alamgiri, a multi-volume Persian text he commissioned.\n\nOften portrayed as a tyrannical, despotic ruler, Aurangzeb’s deathbed letters give us a different picture. Unlike previous Mughal emperors, we get a will from the deathbed letters of Aurangzeb. These letters were written to his three sons. Among other details, like the distribution of his empire among his sons, an unusual content of his letter was the details of his final rites. He asked his sons to collect 4 rupees and 2 annas from his mahaldar, who kept this money on the emperor’s behalf. This money was earned by the emperor through sewing caps (used during prayer). Then he asks his sons to collect three hundred five rupees from his purse and distribute it to faqirs (beggars) on the day of his death. This money was the wage earned by copying the Quran. Aurangzeb died in March 1707, aged 88, at Ahmednagar Fort. Aurangzeb named his son, Muhammad Azam Shah, as the heir to ruling the throne from Delhi. A story goes that among his last were the words ‘Azma fasad baq!’ which is said to mean ‘After me, the chaos’. The will and deathbed letters of Aurangzeb were translated by Jadunath Sarkar and are now in the Bikaner Museum.\n\nThe deathbed letters, wills, last words, accounts of close relatives and other contemporary sources may not be considered very authentic sources for writing history, but they give a sense of involvement in the court politics of great empires to the reader. The aesthetic nature of these sources often surpasses their historicity and the texts demand to be treated accordingly. These texts may be subject to biases, exaggerations and inaccuracies, but they do give us an insight into the popular culture or belief systems in the royal household. A sense of comparison between the early life, the zenith and the conclusion is inevitable while reading these texts. This is what gives them their beauty.\n\nWorks Cited\n\nAsher, Catherine B., and Cynthia Talbot, India before Europe, New Delhi: Cambridge University Press, 2006.\n\nBeveridge, Annete S., (trans.)
