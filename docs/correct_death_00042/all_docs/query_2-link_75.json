        "text": "It is almost obligatory that I post these photos. Most everyone has heard of the Taj Mahal, and probably almost as many have seen photos of it….it is practically a requirement to see it if you come to India (I think they check at immigration before you leave…if you can’t say what city it is in, they don’t let you leave). For the record, the Taj is in Agra, SO IS (you might have guessed this on your own) Agra Fort. [although this photo looks like every other photo taken of the Taj…I did actually go there myself and take the picture, I didn’t steal from some other website.] The guidebooks all say to go early in the morning (both to watch the effect of the changing light on the white marble, as well as to avoid crowds), which we did in mid-March…it was still chilly in the mornings, hence the wrap.\n\nOne of the most popular/common travel routes in India is the circuit through the “Golden Triangle” to visit the sights in Delhi, Agra and Jaipur…most of those in the former two cities (as noted in other posts) were built by the Mughals. Agra was, for some time, the capital of the Mughal Empire.\n\nAside from Taj Mahal and Agra Fort, there is not much else worth seeing in Agra proper, except to have the experience of feeling like a piece of meat that has been thrown into a tank of hungry piranhas. Agra exists because tourists come to see the Taj, and if you look like a tourist, you will be hounded and hustled EVERYWHERE, for everything, EVERY minute that you are awake. Enter at your own risk. You have been warned. Below, the main gate entrance to the Taj Mahal.\n\nNot unlike the feudal period in western europe, the Mughal Empire period of Indian history is filled with intrigue, deception, family members imprisoning other family members, or murdering them, in the name of power and wealth.\n\nThe entrance to Agra Fort, above, wide enough to ride an elephant through, but uphill, so that large boulders could be pushed off the battlements and rolled down on invaders…likewise boiling oil, which could subsequently be ignited by flaming arrows. This fort was a military stronghold before the Mughal Empire, but was fortified/rebuilt during their reign.\n\nAnd monkeys…did I mention the monkeys?. They are everywhere. this little fellow was discovering the wonders of chewing gum.\n\nInside Agra Fort. This part was built by Akbar The Great for his son Jahangir. Akbar was the third Mughal emperor; he earned the appellation “The Great” due to the significant expansion of the empire under his reign. Akbar ascended to the throne at the age of 13, had 30 wives – many the result of political alliances, and ruled until his death at the age of 63 in 1605.\n\nAkbar’s son Jahangir had tried to revolt and claim the empire as his own in 1600, and following Akbar’s death in 1605 “forcefully ascended to the throne” (according to Wikipedia). Later, Jahangir imprisoned and blinded his eldest son for trying to overthrow him. Jahangir was married to his cousin when he was 16 years old, subsequently had 2 additional wives, and a harem reputed to have over 800 women.\n\nThe moat around the fort is where the trees are in the photo above; it was reportedly stocked with crocodiles. Jahangir would have his enemies, or people who offended him, stand on a narrow platform projecting out from the parapet (seen in the top, far right of this photo) until they fell asleep and fell into the water below.\n\nAbove, the view of the Taj from Agra Fort.\n\nShah Jahan was Jahangir’s favorite son. Best known as the guy who built the Taj Mahal, Shah Jahan was 35 when he ascended to the throne. His first act as Shanshah Shah Jahan (“Ruler of the World”…the title he gave himself) was to imprison his step-mother, and execute her son, his rival for the throne.\n\nShah Jahan’s first wife, and his favorite, was given the title Mumtaz Mahal, “The Jewel of the Palace”. She died giving birth to their 14th child. The Taj Mahal – for those who don’t know – is her tomb.\n\nShah Jahan was more fond of white marble than the red sandstone used by his grandfather Akbar. He expanded Agra Fort, initially using a white plaster over red sandstone (above) then later switching to white marble, inlaid with semi precious stones, in a motif also used at the Taj.\n\nShah Jahan had planned an exact replica of the Taj Mahal, made of black marble. Shown above is the location across the Yamuna River from the Taj, that would have been the site of the “black Taj” meant to be his tomb. Shah Jahan’s son Aurangzeb overthrew him, and imprisoned him in this building (below) in Agra Fort, until the end of his life.\n\nOK, well there you go…more Indian history and Mughal architecture than you probably cared for…but now you can check off the box that says “learn something new today”, and relax for the rest of the day!\n\nDetail of the Carnelian, Malachite & Lapis inlay (and other semi-precious stones that I can’t remember at the moment)."
