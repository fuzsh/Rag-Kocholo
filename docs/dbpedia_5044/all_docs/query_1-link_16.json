        "text": "(1935–2000). Soviet cosmonaut Gherman Titov piloted the Vostok 2 spacecraft, launched on Aug. 6, 1961, on the first manned spaceflight of more than a single orbit. Fellow cosmonaut Yuri Gagarin had made the first orbit of Earth on April 12, 1961.\n\nGherman Stepanovich Titov was born on Sept. 11, 1935, in Verkhneye Zhilino, near Barnaul, Russia, in what was then the Soviet Union. He was accepted in 1953 for aviation cadet training, graduating in 1957 as a jet fighter pilot from the Stalingrad Flying Academy. In 1960 he entered cosmonaut training, during the course of which he received the Order of Lenin for an engineering proposal and was selected as the back-up cosmonaut to Gagarin for Vostok 1."
