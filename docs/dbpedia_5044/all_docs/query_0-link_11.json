        "text": "A year after the first blast furnace had been put in operation, on 4 November 1935, blast furnace No. 2 produced its first pig iron. Cast iron was the plant’s primary product before the war. It was supplied to machine-building plants in the Central and Southern parts of the country. NLMZ met its 1935 target displaying the following performance: blast furnace No. 1 produced 217,206 tonnes of pig iron, or 100.6% of the target, while blast furnace No. 2 produced 30,553 tonnes, or 101.8% of the target.\n\nIn autumn 1935, the Stakhanovite movement spread across the entire country, initiated by local resident Alexei Stakhanov. The shock worker movement at NLMZ was rapidly growing. In November 1935, the plant had 194 Stakhanovites. A month later, there were already 432 of them.\n\nThe Stakhanovite movement was mass movement of Alexei Stakhanov's followers, pioneers of Socialist production in the USSR – workers, collective farmers, engineers and technicians – aimed to improve labour efficiency through implementation of new equipment and technologies. It was one of the types of shock work, the initial and most widespread form of Socialist competition.\n\nThe Stakhanovite movement was initiated by Alexei Stakhanov, a coal miner at the Tsentralnaya-Irmino mine in Kadievka (now Stakhanov), who, on the night of 30–31 August 1935, mined 107 tonnes of coal in 5 hours and 45 minutes, with a standard mining quota of 7 tonnes.\n\nStakhanov was able to demonstrate this sensational performance by switching from the individual approach to the work of the miners that was previously used to a teamwork approach with task sharing. Alexei used only a jackhammer to mine, followed closely by two other miners who widened the coal stall and strengthened its walls.\n\nEncouraged by the propaganda and enjoying financial support from the Communist Party of the USSR, the Stakhanovite movement shortly swept through all industries; transport, construction, agriculture and others; spreading across the entire country.\n\nStakhanovite shifts\n\nIn 1935, operation at NLMZ was totally based on Stakhanovite shifts which lasted for between one and five days. In their reports and statements the shock workers said that they were “paving the way, discovering untapped reserves for transition to Stakhanovite months and conversion of the whole plant into a Stakhanovite facility.”\n\n600 Stakhanovites worked at the plant by 1935. NLMZ met its 1935 target, displaying the following performance: blast furnace No. 1 produced 217,206 tonnes of pig iron, or 100.6% of the target, while blast furnace No. 2 produced 30,553 tonnes, or 101.8% of the target.\n\nThe subsidy was reduced by 1,468,000 rubles over 11 months, instead of the initial figure of 1,300,000 rubles specified in the annual commitment (from the report on achievements of plant personnel presented to the Voronezh Regional Committee of the AUCP(b) after the gathering of NLMZ shock workers and Stakhanovites).\n\nThe trade union committee of the plant became more active. In association with the mining committee of the Lipetsk iron ore mines, it organised a meeting of the Stakhanovites fr om both organisations where the participants discussed not only improvement of production output but also enhancement of ore, flux and pig iron quality. The Komsomol played a major role in achieving production targets and was actively involved in the plant’s social life.\n\nThe training facilities, which significantly enriched the operation of the plant, included a workschool, Stakhanovite courses, and classes wh ere the basics of technical safety were taught. The plant recruited young talent and encouraged steelworkers to improve their technical expertise. To support the people’s creative development and strengthen their motivation, the party promoted the best of them.\n\nOver 40% of all workers were followers of the Stakhanovite movement in 1939. Throughout the year, the employees of three shops – the blast furnace shop, machine shop and cogeneration plant – were holders of the Transferable Red Banner of the plant.\n\nAlongside the Stakhanovite movement’s development, the plant’s management paid special attention to optimisation and invention. Lipetsk steelworkers submitted more than 100 improvement ideas aimed at saving raw materials and fuel, and improving equipment operation.\n\nThe same year, the plant management started an all-out fight against illiteracy, as well as cultural and awareness-raising activities. These initiatives were supervised by Grigory Shapanov, Director of NLMZ. Later on, NLMZ personnel were awarded the Transferable Red Banner by the Plenum of the Central Committee of the Iron and Steel Industry Union of the Centre held in April 1939, for successfully eliminating illiteracy.\n\nFyodor Sergeev\n\nDirector of Novolipetsk Iron and Steel Works in 1939–1946\n\nFyodor Sergeev was born in Dnepropetrovsk. He graduated from the Dnepropetrovsk Metallurgical Institute.\n\nHe began his career in 1919 as an apprentice mechanic, then proceeded to work as an assistant machine operator, a driver and a garage manager, and also held elective positions in the Komsomol. His experience as a professional steelworker began in 1934 at the Novolipetsk Iron and Steel Works, wh ere he was a shift engineer. In 1935 he was transferred to the position of Chief Technical Officer and Deputy Chief Engineer of NLMZ.\n\nSergeev was appointed Director of NLMZ in 1939.\n\nTwice, in 1941 and 1942, he personally supervised the evacuation of plant equipment from Lipetsk to the Urals.\n\nIn 1942 Sergeev was appointed as an officer in charge of a fighter unit. He was awarded two Orders of the Badge of Honour, two Orders of the Red Banner of Labour and five medals, including “For Valiant Labour in the Great Patriotic War 1941–1945”, “For the Restoration of the Black Metallurgy Enterprises of the South” and “For Labour Valour”.\n\nFrom 1943, Fyodor Sergeev was put in charge of the plant’s restoration. By 1944 the pig iron foundry, steel foundry and machine shops had been rebuilt and the plant had adopted technologies to produce munitions and war supplies as well as steam-water isolation valves for evacuated industrial facilities, and operation of auxiliary shops (transport, electrical and water supply shops) had been fully organised. A recreation centre was built in 1946.\n\nSergeev was transferred to Tula and appointed Director of Kosaya Gora Iron Works (KGIW) in 1946.\n\nOrder No. 444\n\nOn forming a militia at Novolipetsk Iron and Steel Works\n\n27 June 1941\n\nTo ensure safety and protection of the Socialist property of the Novolipetsk Iron and Steel Works, I HEREBY ORDER that a militia be formed by enlisting plant workers, engineers and white-collar employees.\n\nMilitias are formed on a voluntary basis and operate outside of working hours.\n\nAll shop managers and heads of departments are instructed to assign all volunteers for militia service to the command of the militia detachment chief officer and to dismiss the volunteers promptly after hours for their militia duty.\n\nI hereby appoint Comrade Bugakov Chief Officer of the Militia and order that the organisation be formed immediately and finish the assignment by 8:00 p.m. on 27 June 1941.\n\nProgress in the task is to be reported directly to me.\n\nPlant Director SERGEEV.\n\nState Archive of Lipetsk Region, R-422, op. 1, d. 30, p. 186\n\nIn autumn 1941 the front line was moving closer to Lipetsk, and the situation became more complicated. A fighter unit was organised at the plant to prevent possible subversive actions. Fyodor Sergeev, Director of NLMZ, was appointed its Chief Officer, with Power Engineer Ivan Naumenko as his deputy. The men in the fighter unit patrolled the premises at night to prevent any sabotage by the enemy.\n\nIn October 1941, the government made the decision to evacuate the equipment of the blast furnace shop, cogeneration plant, water supply system, railway and machine shops of the plant to Chelyabinsk. On 28 October, Fyodor Sergeev, Director of NLMZ, issued Order No. 656 “On Evacuation of NLMZ” based on the decision of the government and a telegraph order from Ivan Tevosian, People’s Commissar of Ferrous Metallurgy.\n\nIt's hard to imagine what it took to dismantle in a few weeks what had been built over the years: two blast furnaces and the combined heat and power plant. Apart from the equipment, engineering drawings and technical documentation for all facilities and buildings had to be evacuated as well. 600 railway cars in 14 military trains arrived at Shagol station in Chelyabinsk Region in late December 1941. By that time, the German troops had already been defeated near Moscow.\n\nAs a Wehrmacht general wrote in his memoirs about the autumn-winter campaign near Moscow: “The fast-moving German divisions that were accustomed to Blitzkrieg operations had become clumsy and slow, almost as clumsy as the Napoleonic armies in 1812.” They were waiting for the frost to strike as their vehicles had been bogged down in impassable mud and slush on Russian roads. And the frost struck...\n\n“The oil froze in the machines. Carbines, machine pistols and machine-guns packed up. Tank engines would not start.” Meanwhile, “The Russians proved themselves masters of rapidly improvised defence, especially in the wintery forests and swamps.”\n\nIn October 1941, the decision was made to evacuate the workers of the Studenovskoye deposit. They were delivered to the South Urals and employed at the Orsko-Khalilovsky Iron and Steel Works.\n\nThe preparatory work started for reconstruction of the blast furnaces and the cogeneration plant. However, Voronezh TPP was unable to fully supply the plant’s power demand due to energy consumption restrictions, so the reconstruction issue remained up in the air. Besides, the equipment of the plant’s cogeneration plant was fully operational at Chelyabinsk Metallurgical Plant, and shipping it back was out of the question. Taking into account the plant’s power shortage, the People’s Commissariat of Ferrous Metallurgy decided to provide NLMZ with a turbine generator and three boilers for its cogeneration plant.\n\nIn March 1946, the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union approved a plan for revival and development of the country’s national economy. Around 6,000 large industrial facilities were to be reconstructed and commissioned as part of the fourth five-year plan.\n\nThe Novolipetsk plant was also being reborn. All city residents capable of working voluntarily participated in the reconstruction of the plant on weekends. Construction workers worked around the clock.\n\nAbout 2,000 of Lipetsk citizens went to war. More than 620 of them were killed in battle defending their homeland; more than 300 were missing in action. Construction of a crushing and beneficiation plant at the Studenovskoye deposit began in 1945.\n\nPavel Sergeev, 1946–1962\n\n(18 October 1911 – 7 November 1988)\n\nPavel Sergeev was born in Yenakiyevo, Donetsk Region, to the family of a white-collar employee.\n\nHe began his career as an apprentice mechanic at the machine shop of Yenakiyeve Iron and Steel Works.\n\nHe graduated fr om the Dnepropetrovsk Metallurgical Institute in 1932 as a blast furnace engineer and was sent to the Dzerzhinsk Metallurgical Plant in Dneprodzerzhinsk wh ere he worked until 1941 as a research engineer, foreman, shift supervisor, blast furnace unit manager, deputy blast furnace shop manager and acting blast furnace shop manager.\n\nSergeev was a veteran of the Second World War. He fought on the Leningrad Front, the Volkhov Front and the 3rd Belorussian Front as a platoon officer and division officer. In 1945 he returned to the steelmaking plant in Dneprodzerzhinsk to take the position of deputy director.\n\nSergeev was appointed Director of Novolipetsk Iron and Steel Works in 1946.\n\nThe plant’s cogeneration plant as well as blast furnaces No. 1 and 2 were reconstructed and launched under his supervision. He also oversaw construction and commissioning of blast furnace No. 3, flat rolling shops (FRS) No. 1 and 2, electric arc furnace (EAF) and sections shops.\n\nIn 1962 he was relieved of his post for health reasons.\n\nOn 18 March 1966, basic oxygen furnace shop No. 1 (BOF-1) was put in operation. By the morning of March 19, the first slab was produced. The following words were immediately written on it in chalk: “Hurrah! Long live the working class!” The following day, the slab produced was used to cast a bas-relief featuring the words: “A gift for the 23rd Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union. First converter steel produced at NLMZ. March 1966”. The shop reached its design capacity in 14 months, which was 16 months prior to the target date.\n\nBOF-1 was the first in the world to combine heavy-duty converters and high-performance vertical continuous slab casters in a single technological cycle. During implementation of this technology, the basic principles of logistics were developed for combination of high-performance basic oxygen furnaces, metal purification units and continuous casting machines. The subsequent scope of work for reconstruction of the shop’s equipment made it possible to improve the operational level of the continuous slab casters and provide a substantial increase in the capacity of the BOF production .\n\nNLMZ’s new steelmaking method gave birth to the currently widespread technology of ’continuous-continuous casting‘, which means continuous casting of ingots fr om a series of replaceable steel teeming ladles.\n\nThis method delivered a reduction in metal loss, improved chemical homogeneity, surface finish and internal structure of cast metal, and later on fundamentally changed the downstream workflow, eliminating slabbing mills and enabling hot charging of ingots and ’direct‘ rolling of billets, significantly simplifying the procedure of billet preparation for steelmaking.\n\nThe plant improved key steelmaking production parameters for a wide range of high grade steel (including low carbon steel for automotive sheets and low alloy tube steel), as well as a melted steel protection system against secondary oxidation, mold oscillators for the continuous slab caster and the secondary slab cooling system. Stopper-free steel teeming from ladles was adopted and implemented as well.\n\nOn 6 July 1966, the State Commission authorised the first stage of the BOF shop for operation. Many builders were decorated with the highest award, the Order of Lenin, including Lipetskstroy Trust Manager Sergei Shuminsky and Chief Engineer Vladimir Khoroshavin. New residential neighbourhoods in Lipetsk were named after them.\n\nOn 1 June 1966, Stoilensky celebrated its fifth anniversary. More than 33 million cubic metres of overburden rock had been dumped over this time.\n\nAnatoly Likhoradov\n\nDirector of Novolipetsk Iron and Steel Works in 1967–1970\n\nAnatoly Likhoradov was born in Dnepropetrovsk. He began his career in 1942 as a mechanic at Magnitogorsk Iron and Steel Works.\n\nHe graduated from the Dnepropetrovsk Metallurgical Institute in 1948 and was sent to the local DMZ Petrovsky steelmaking plant wh ere he worked as assistant foreman, foreman, shift manager and chief foreman at the long steel shop.\n\nIn 1956–1963, he worked at Kryvorozhstal plant as Long Steel Shop Manager, Blooming Shop Manager, Chief Process Engineer and Deputy Chief Production Engineer.\n\nLikhoradov was Director of DMZ Petrovsky steelmaking plant between 1963 and 1967.\n\nIn 1967 he was transferred to Lipetsk and appointed Director of Novolipetsk Iron and Steel Works. Under his leadership, the plant built and commissioned flat rolling shop No. 3, rolling equipment repair shop No. 1, coke battery No. 5, the Sukhoborye Recreation Centre and a sports arena with a swimming pool. He also adopted steelmaking in heavy-duty converters with subsequent continuous casting into a wide mix of slabs by special machines.\n\nIn 1970 Anatoly Likhoradov was appointed Deputy Minister of Ferrous Metallurgy of the USSR. In 1978 he became Head of the Ferrous and Non-Ferrous Metallurgy Unit at the Administrative Department of the Council of Ministers.\n\nSince 1991 he has served as Deputy Head of the International Liaison Department at Stinol Foreign Trade, an NLMK- owned company.\n\nProduction accounting at the blast furnace shop, shipping and sale records, scrap intake records broken down by supplier and the analysis of sold product accounts were all mechanised using a machine tabulation station, which was later reorganised into the Data Processing Centre and then the CAM system.\n\nOn 1 July 1969, flat rolling shop No. 3 was commissioned, with a type-2000 mill designed to produce 5.8 million tonnes per year. The mill was put in commercial operation in April 1970.\n\nThe type-2000 mill is one of the largest facilities in the industry. The total weight of its equipment is more than 37,000 tonnes. The area occupied by the unit itself is more than 120,000 square metres, with a 1.2 kilometre-long hot-rolling production line. The overall generating capacity of electric motors powering the mill equipment exceeds 170,000 kW. The mill is equipped with state-of-the-art automated production control systems.\n\nThe mill was designed with the application of the world’s cutting-edge technology of continuous rolling fr om continuously cast slabs and coiling hot-rolled strips, from the thinnest (1.2 mm) to thick (16 mm) ones, up to 1,850 mm in width, at a high speed and relatively low temperature.\n\nSpecial long steel production processes for the shipbuilding and oil processing industries were developed and implemented, and the technology of steel strip rolling from special grades of construction steel was adopted.\n\nThe new design of the mill equipment enabled roll pressure and rolling speed rates which had not been possible before, as well as a substantial increase in the weight of rolled slabs.\n\nThe design output capacity of the mill was 5.78 million tonnes per year, unprecedented in global practice.\n\nOn 1 March 1969, the crushing and screening plant produced 3.8 million tonnes of high grade ore in one year, fully in line with its production load.\n\nThe first train of iron ore from Stoilensky mine was shipped to Novotulsky Metallurgical Plant on 2 April 1969.\n\nSerafim Kolpakov\n\nDirector of Novolipetsk Iron and Steel Works in 1970–1978\n\nSerafim Kolpakov was born in Lipetsk.\n\nHe graduated from the Lipetsk Ore Mining and Smelting College in 1951 and was sent to Ashinsky Metallurgical Plant wh ere he worked as a crew leader, production foreman and deputy head of the foundry shop.\n\nBetween 1957 and 1963, Kolpakov worked at Lipetsk Tractor Plant as a crew leader in the steel foundry shop, foreman, acting section manager and senior foreman of the iron foundry shop.\n\nIn 1963 he graduated from the Moscow Institute of Steel and Alloys, having completed his education, he changed his job and began working at Novolipetsk Iron and Steel Works at BOF-1. He worked as a foreman, shift manager and deputy shop manager.\n\nKolpakov was appointed head of BOF-1 in 1967 and director of the plant in 1970. He was directly involved in the development and adoption of new technology of steelmaking through heavy-duty converters with subsequent continuous casting by special machines as well as in development and implementation of an integrated environmental protection control system at the plant.\n\nFacilities built and commissioned under his leadership include blast furnace No. 2 which is still in operation, blast furnace No. 5, the steelmaking slag processing shop, the waste water treatment shop, steelmaking equipment repair shop No. 2, Zvezdny Sports Arena, Prometheus summer camp.\n\nSerafim Kolpakov was appointed Deputy Minister of Ferrous Metallurgy of the USSR in 1978 and became Minister in 1985. In 1989 he was appointed Minister of Metallurgy of the USSR. He retired in 1990 with an individual pension in recognition of his service to the nation.\n\nIn 1991, he became Vice President of the Union of Associations and Joint Stock Companies in the Area of Non-Conventional Materials.\n\nKolpakov was elected President of the International Union of Metalworkers in 1992.\n\nDuring the 11th Congress of the Russian Union of Industrialists and Entrepreneurs (employers) in November 2000, he was elected to the Board of the RSPP.\n\nIn October 2001, Kolpakov was elected to the Management Committee of the Non-profit Partnership ‘Consortium Russian Steel’ founded after the agreement between NLMK and NTMK was signed.\n\nSerafim Kolpakov was buried at Troyekurovskoye Cemetery.\n\nIn 1991 NLMK became the first plant in Russia to produce cold-rolled products from titanium and niobium-alloyed ultra low carbon steel (IF type) designed for die stamping of particularly complex components in the automotive industry. The content of carbon and nitrogen in the new steel was only thousandths of a percent. IF steel produced by NLMK is as good as any similar foreign-made steel in all criteria.\n\nThe new steel allowed for manufacturing complex products of a complex shape, as well as reducing the number of operations in stamping and welding processes, which was particularly valuable in manufacturing of highly complex parts in the automotive industry.\n\nThe same year, the plant became the first in Russia to launch a high-speed colour coating line (CCL) with a design capacity of 140,000 tonnes. NLMK was also the first Russian steelmaking plant to start manufacturing of the highest value-added product, pre-painted steel.\n\nCCL-1 absorbed leading global achievements and was way ahead of its time – the real demand for its products evolved only in the late 1990s.\n\nIn December 1991, Avtomet, a research and development enterprise, was established as a subsidiary of NLMK to provide integrated automation services for the plant. Over four years, specialists implemented automation of the main shops RPS, FRS-3, FRS-5, BOF-1 and Refractory Shop. The most important developments and innovations include an automated control system for the finishing stand group of the type-2000 mill based on new-generation IBM PCs integrated into a single computer network; automated equipment repair control systems for FRS-5 and RPS; and an integrated accounting system of the plant.\n\nA state-of-the-art coke battery, unparalleled anywhere in Russia or the CIS, was put in operation. Only two machines of this kind had been launched in Russia over the previous decade, both of them at NLMK. The new coke battery was a facility with 3,500 tonnes of steel structures, 22,000 tonnes of refractory and 3,500 tonnes of production equipment. Microprocessor devices installed on the battery were used to control production processes aimed at ensuring the efficiency of coke gas combustion and preventing discharge of coke gas into the atmosphere.\n\nTen specialised organisations participated in the construction of the coke battery. NLMK specialists completed adjustment of the equipment assembled.\n\nThe dust free coke pushing system used on the new coke battery allowed 490 tonnes of dust to be collected each year and the total amount of atmospheric dust emissions to be reduced by 80%, around 1,500 tonnes per year. The overall costs to NLMK of the launch totalled more than 500 million rubles.\n\n90% of all equipment was produced domestically.\n\nThe second continuous hot-dip galvanising line was launched at FRS-5. It was based on the continuous annealing machine previously employed. Its annual production output totalled 150,000 tonnes of galvanised metal, 0.3–0.5 mm thick, which was in strong demand on the market.\n\nThe new production line was unique because it had been rebuilt from the continuous annealing machine. The work was completed over an exceptionally short period of time: it took less than two years to implement the project. The services of foreign companies Stein Heurtey (France), ANDRITZ Sundwig and Menzel & Krause were enlisted for the project. This reduced time frame also enabled the plant to leave its competitors in the hot-dip galvanised steel market well behind. The machine was rebuilt by specialists of NLMK’s engineering centre and repair plant. The reconstruction was 5 times cheaper than construction of an entirely new production line.\n\nIn 2006 NLMK acquired Independent Transportation Company LLC (NTK), a logistics operator providing 100% of the company’s railway transportation.\n\nNTK was a key logistics asset of the Company, ensuring timely delivery of raw materials for steelmaking and shipment of finished products to customers in Russia and abroad. NTK coordinated interaction with Russian Railways and port authorities regarding export operations.\n\nIn 2006 NLMK acquired VIZ-Steel, Russia’s second-largest electrical steel producer with an annual capacity of 200,000 tonnes. VIZ-Steel’s semi-finished product needs are entirely supplied by NLMK.\n\nVIZ-Steel is an electrical steel production facility located in Yekaterinburg. It produces cold-rolled electrical steel. The production capacity of VIZ-Steel totals around 200,000 tonnes of electrical steel per year. The company’s share of the Russian grain oriented steel market is 56%, with 11% of the global market.\n\nAltai-Koks coke plant satisfying 100% of NLMK’s demand for coke was acquired in 2006.\n\nAltai-Koks is the leading Russian coke plant producing high-quality coke and chemical products. The production capacity of Altai-Koks totals 3.8 million tonnes of six-percent humidity coke. The plant was to commission a new coke battery with a capacity of 1.14 million tonnes at the end of 2006.\n\nDanish steel rolling company DanSteel A/S, a producer of thick steel plates, was acquired in 2006. The semi-finished product needs of DanSteel A/S are completely supplied by NLMK’s steel slabs.\n\nThe annual production output of DanSteel A/S is about 500,000 tonnes of hot-rolled thick plates. DanSteel A/S has state-of-the-art production facilities. For a few years, NLMK had successfully cooperated with the Danish company, being DanSteel’s key supplier of steel slabs since 2002.\n\nIn 2006 NLMK and Duferco Group set up a joint venture including one steelmaking facility and five rolling mills as well as a network of steel service centres in Europe and the USA. The JV’s total output of finished products was estimated at 4.5 million tonnes.\n\nThe companies approved a large-scale technical upgrade and development programme. Total investment was estimated at €375 million. Through the JV with Duferco, NLMK planned to increase slab production by 3.4 million tonnes, while Duferco, which had been facing a shortfall in slab capacity, aimed to expand the output of high value-added goods as well as steel products of special grades.\n\nThe JV included the following companies:\n\nCarsid S.A. (Marcinelle, Belgium) – a slab producer with a production capacity of 2.1 million tonnes per year.\n\nDuferco La Louvière S.A. (La Louvière, Belgium) – a rolled steel producer, with an annual hot-rolling capacity of 2.0 million tonnes, cold-rolling capacity of 1.6 million tonnes, and wire rod capacity of 0.36 million tonnes.\n\nDuferco Clabecq S.A. (Ittre, Belgium) – a thick plate producer with a production capacity of 0.8 million tonnes per year.\n\nDuferco Coating S.A.S. (Strasbourg and Beautor, France) – a coated steel producer comprising two production assets: Sorral (with an annual hot-dip galvanised steel capacity of 0.32 million tonnes and pre-painted steel capacity of 0.12 million tonnes) and Beautor (with an annual cold-rolling capacity of 0.35 million tonnes and electrogalvanised steel capacity of 0.33 million tonnes).\n\nDuferco Farrell Corp. (Farrell, Pennsylvania, USA) – a flat rolled steel producer with an annual hot-rolling capacity of 1.8 million tonnes and cold-rolling capacity of 0.8 million tonnes.\n\nAcciaierie Grigoli S.p.a. (Verona, Italy) – a producer of heavy plates and ingots with an annual heavy plate production capacity of 0.6 million tonnes.\n\nIn addition, the joint venture includes a distribution group of nine service centres selling products manufactured by the JV and other producers. The service centres are located in France, Belgium and Czech Republic.\n\nNLMK’s new 150 MW recovery cogeneration plant was launched at the Lipetsk site in 2011. It was designed to process blast furnace gas from blast furnace No. 7.\n\nWith the new recovery cogeneration plant launched at the Lipetsk site, NLMK’s power generation capacity increased by 45%, to 482 MW, bringing the level of energy self-sufficiency from 47% up to 56%, regardless of the expansion of the blast furnace and steelmaking capacity. Investment in the project was 6.8 billion rubles.\n\nOverall investment in the construction of the blast furnace, recovery cogeneration plant and BF infrastructure totalled 43 billion rubles.\n\nThe European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD) awarded the project a prize for its model integrated energy-saving strategy, promotion of best management practices and skills related to innovative environmental technologies and energy management solutions, which allowed gross emissions to be reduced by 15 times compared with the old technology.\n\nIn 2011 NLMK closed a deal to acquire the remaining 50% stake in Steel Invest and Finance (SIF) from Duferco Group. The transaction resulted in SIF becoming a 100% owned subsidiary of NLMK. Following the acquisition, NLMK established its new business divisions – NLMK Europe and NLMK USA comprising all international assets of the Group.\n\nNLMK Europe division consolidated the Group’s assets in the European Union. It comprised six steel rolling production assets, in particular hot-rolling including for thick plates, cold-rolling, galvanising and pre-painting facilities as well as a network of service and distribution centres. The division employs 3,000 people. NLMK’s business model is unique for Europe and based on stable supply of semi-finished products (slabs) from Russia to European facilities located close to customers that produce flat high value-added products.\n\nNLMK USA comprises three flat steel production facilities – NLMK Indiana, NLMK Pennsylvania (formerly, Duferco Farrell) and Sharon Coating. The division has an electric arc furnace (EAF) at NLMK Indiana with a capacity of 730,000 tonnes and steelmaking facilities with 2.7 million tonnes of capacity producing slabs, hot-rolled, cold-rolled and galvanised steel. The new division brought additional benefits through a common distribution setup in the USA, in particular for pipe and tube production as well as machine building.\n\nIn 2011 processing unit IV was commissioned at Stoilensky’s beneficiation plant. Following the launch, the iron ore concentrate output went up by 2 million tonnes, bringing the total annual concentrate production capacity to 14 million tonnes.\n\nOn 28 October 2011, the official commissioning ceremony for the new quenching & tempering line was held at NLMK Clabecq. Implementation of the project helped ensure sustainable development of NLMK Clabecq and overcome consequences of the economic global crisis. The annual capacity of the line is 250,000 tonnes, which means that one third of NLMK Clabecq’s products will pass through the quenching & tempering line.\n\nNLMK Clabecq produces a wide range of thick plates, including light plates, which are distinguished by high-quality surface finish and adjustable flatness and thickness.\n\nIn 2011 CCL-3 improved the Company’s output of finished painted strips, 0.3–0.8 mm thick and 700–1,250 mm wide. These products enjoy stable demand in Russia, as they are used in manufacturing of building structures, including metal roof tiles, profiled panels, sandwich panels, and interior and exterior cladding. Strips produced at the new line are thinner than ever before.\n\nIn 2011 NLMK was granted the right to develop the third mine field of the Usinsk coal deposit (Usinsky-3) located in the northern part of the Komi Republic. The Usinsk deposit is located in the north-western part of the Pechora coal basin, 45 km south-west of the Vorkuta deposit in Komi. The Usinsk-3 deposit has commercial reserves of over 227 million tonnes of high-quality hard coking coal of Zh and KZh grades in C1+C2 categories.\n\nIn 2011 the Lipetsk site completed upgrade of a continuous casting machine (CCM-8) with a capacity of 2.5 million tonnes per year. CCM-8 was the fifth machine to be renovated at the Lipetsk site.\n\nIts commissioning enabled the plant to launch production of slabs 355 mm thick, while slabs produced by continuous casting machines of this type in Russia are typically 300 mm thick. This reconstruction allowed NLMK to streamline the production of thick plates, in particular in subsidiary European companies – DanSteel and Clabecq. Thick plates are in high demand in the machine-building and energy sectors.\n\nAs part of the project, the CCM was fully revamped, including replacement of casting stands and installation of closed loop water cooling systems. CCM-8 is the first in Russia to use a dynamic secondary cooling model to improve the surface quality and internal structure of billets. The facility is fully equipped with an advanced automation and instrumentation system.\n\nNLMK’s new 300-tonne BOF was put in operation in Lipetsk in 2011. Alongside other Technical Upgrade Programme activities, the launch of the new BOF enabled a 36% increase in steelmaking capacity at the Lipetsk site to 12.4 million tonnes per year.\n\nIn 2011 NLMK acquired National Laminations Group, a service centre in India specialising in electrical grain oriented steel cutting and distribution.\n\nNational Laminations Group is an anisotropic (grain oriented) steel processing and distribution company located in Mumbai. It has an annual processing capacity of 16,000 tonnes. The company also has warehousing facilities with a capacity of 40,000 tonnes located 20 km from Mumbai, close to the port, which facilitates delivery of NLMK’s grain oriented steel from Russia.\n\nIn March 2015The Board of Directors approved NLMK’s new dividend policy. According to the new dividend policy, dividends are to be paid on a quarterly basis with the payout in the range of 50% of net income and 50% of free cash flow calculated based on US GAAP consolidated financial statements, if Net Debt/EBITDA is 1.0x or less.\n\nIn 2015, NLMK Group and Belgian SOGEPA (Societe Wallonne de Gestion et de Participations S.A.) agreed on changes to NLMK Belgium Holdings’ (NBH) ownership structure and governance. The parties signed an agreement increasing SOGEPA’s interest in NBH from 20.5% to 49%.\n\nNBH comprises the production companies and service centres of the NLMK Europe Strip Division (NLMK La Louvière, NLMK Strasbourg, NLMK Coating, NLMK Jemappes Steel Center, NLMK Manage Steel Center and NLMK Profil Batiment), and two NLMK Europe Plate production companies (NLMK Verona and NLMK Clabecq).\n\nUnder the new agreement, the NBH board of directors was be increased to include four representatives of NLMK Group and three representatives of SOGEPA. SOGEPA also received board seats at the principal production subsidiaries of NBH.\n\nIn May 2015, NLMK launched an innovative environmental facility – a biochemical waste water treatment facility at coke and chemical operations at the Lipetsk production site.\n\nThe facility is unique in Russia and employs a custom technology developed by Russian scientists for deep biochemical water purification from phenols, rhodanides, ammoniacal nitrogen and its oxides. The 160 m³/hour facility was designed using the best available technologies, and provided a twenty-fold improvement in the quality of treatment of coke and chemical operations waste water for reuse in the closed-loop water cycle.\n\nAll infrastructure and utilities were installed above ground on an isolated concrete area equipped with a rain, melt and drain water collector, preventing any chance of groundwater pollution in the event of a containment failure and providing twenty-fold reduction in air emissions of specific pollutants that are generated as industrial waste evaporates.\n\nTotal investment into the project which was implemented as part of NLMK’s Environmental Programme 2020 exceed RUB 2 billion.\n\nIn June 2015, NLMK launched operation of a new top-pressure recovery turbine (TRT), a green energy-generating facility, at its Lipetsk production site. Top-pressure recovery turbines generate energy using excess blast furnace gas pressure. Blast furnace gas produced during the smelting of hot metal in blast furnaces at Novolipetsk is also channeled to a heat power plant and a recovery cogeneration plant for captive energy generation.\n\nThe launched TRT is part of a complex with a total design capacity of 28 MW. Launch of the second TRT is scheduled in 2016. The project set to increase the plant’s energy self-sufficiency from 54% to 56%. The TRT will therefore reduce the amount of energy that must be purchased for the plant by 200 million kWh per year, which accounts for approximately 6% of total purchased energy. Investment in the two TRTs is estimated at 1.9 billion rubles.\n\nIn June 2015 NLMK Group announced the opening of a unified sales service centre to serve the Company’s domestic and international clients. Unified call-centre telephone number: +7 (495) 134 44 45.\n\nIn August 2015 NLMK Kaluga, a new generation EAF plant (part of NLMK Long Products) that manufactures a wide range of long products used in construction, produced its second million tonnes of steel. The launch of NLMK Kaluga in July 2013 was the Event of the Year in Russian ferrous metallurgy. The plant is based on the mini-mill concept of locating EAF steelmaking and rolling operations in close proximity to sources of raw materials and consumers of finished goods."
