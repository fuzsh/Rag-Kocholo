        "text": "Born. To Lieut. Colonel Gherman Titov, 29, Soviet Cosmonaut; and Tamara Dasilyevna, 27; their third child, second daughter; in Leningrad.\n\nMarried. Catherine Deneuve, 21, French film ingenue (The Umbrellas of Cherbourg); and David Bailey, 27, London fashion photographer; she for the first time, he for the second; in London.\n\nDied. Clarence Nicholas Sayen, 46, president from 1951 to 1962 of the Air Line Pilots Association, 16,000-member union representing more than 90% of the country’s scheduled airline pilots, a onetime Braniff copilot who won many badly needed air-safety reforms, but called senseless strikes against the airlines in a bitter struggle for control of the smaller Flight Engineers union and resigned under fire; of injuries suffered when the United Airlines Boeing 727 he had taken from New York crashed into Lake Michigan minutes before landing at Chicago, killing all 30 passengers and crew.\n\nDied. Matthew Hobson Murphy Jr., 51, Alabama attorney and self-styled “Imperial Klonsel” of the Ku Klux Klan who last May defended Collie Leroy Wilkins, one of the three Klansmen charged with the murder of Civil Rights Worker Viola Gregg Liuzzo; of injuries sustained in an auto accident; near Tuscaloosa, Ala.\n\nDied. William Clyde DeVane, 67, longtime dean of Yale College (1938-63), a brilliant English scholar (Browning, Tennyson) and teacher who battled for the maintenance of a strong liberal arts curriculum in the face of a mounting tide of “fierce specialization,” was hailed for his 1945 reorganization plan (intensified honors, divisional majors) that served as the model for many other U.S. colleges; of heart disease; in Greensboro, Vt.\n\nDied. Philip Fox La Follette, 68, son of Wisconsin’s “Fighting Bob” La Follette and brother of longtime (1925-46) Senator “Young Bob,” who served three terms as Governor of the state (1931-33 and 1935-39) but failed as head of a short-lived Progressive party revival and retired to private law practice; of pneumonia; in Madison, Wis.\n\nDied. Lucie Valore Utrillo, 87, widow of famed Parisian Impressionist Maurice Utrillo, an ambitious woman who married the aging, alcoholic painter in 1935, shut him up in a suburban home, turned away his friends, curtailed his output to 20 paintings a year, allowed none to be sold until they had reached a price high enough to suit her (around $25,000 at his death in 1955); of heart attack; in Paris."
