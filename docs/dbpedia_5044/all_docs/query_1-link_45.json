        "text": "The first name \"Titov\" is of Russian origin. It is derived from the Russian surname \"Titov,\" which means \"son of Tit,\" with \"Tit\" being a diminutive form of the name \"Tikhon.\" The surname \"Titov\" was quite common in Russia, and at some point, it began to be used as a first name.
