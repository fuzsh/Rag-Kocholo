        "text": "These records, collectively known as vital records, can provide details about important milestones in your ancestors’ lives. They include information like the event date and place, parents’ names, occupation and residence. The cause of death is also included in most death records.\n\nVital records are a cornerstone of family history research because they were typically created at or near the time of the event, making the record more likely to be accurate. This category includes indexes that can help you request copies from vital records keepers, and in some cases the images of actual records."
