        "text": "Rulers\n\nIndex Ta-Ti\n\nTa Mok, original name Ung Choeun, also called Chhit Choeun, Ek Choeun, etc. (b. 1926, Brakeab village, Takeo province, southern Cambodia - d. July 21, 2006, Phnom Penh, Cambodia), Cambodian leader. He joined the resistance against the French colonialists in the 1940s and was an early adherent of the Communist Party (\"Khmer Rouge\") built up by Pol Pot; at some time during his revolutionary career, he took the nom de guerre of Ta Mok, meaning Grandfather Mok. He was said to have been one of the commanders involved in the March 1974 razing of the former royal capital at Oudong, the expulsion of its civilian population, and the massacre of officials and government soldiers captured there. After the Khmer Rouge victory in April 1975, he headed the party's southwestern zone from his home province of Takeo. In 1978, he was dispatched to conduct a purge in the eastern zone bordering Vietnam. A Vietnamese invasion drove the Khmer Rouge from power in 1979. They continued to fight against the Vietnamese-installed regime, and the loss of a leg to a land mine in the early 1980s while inspecting a road project failed to keep Ta Mok from carrying on with the guerrilla struggle. In a 1997 power play he toppled Pol Pot and led the Khmer Rouge in its final days; its force was all but spent, and the government captured its last stronghold at Anlong Veng in 1998, forcing Ta Mok to flee. Unlike other surviving Khmer Rouge leaders, he struck no deal to surrender or defect to the government. He was captured along the Thai-Cambodian border in March 1999 while on the run with a small band of followers. Held in a Phnom Penh military prison, he was charged with crimes against humanity in 2002 but died before he could be tried. His supposed ruthlessness earned him the nickname \"The Butcher\" in the Western press.\n\nTa Quang Buu (b. July 23, 1910, Hoanh Son village, Nam Hoanh [now in Khanh Son] commune, Nam Dan district, Nghe An province, Annam [now in Vietnam] - d. Aug. 21, 1986, Hanoi, Vietnam), defense minister of North Vietnam (1947-48). He was also minister of higher and vocational education (1965-76).\n\nTaaffe, Eduard (Franz Joseph) Graf (Count), (11th) Viscount Taaffe (b. Feb. 24, 1833, Vienna, Austria - d. Nov. 29, 1895, Ellischau, Bohemia, Austria [now Nalzovy, Czech Republic]), Landespräsident of Salzburg (1863-67), Statthalter of Oberösterreich (1867) and Tirol (1871-79), and interior minister (1867, 1870-71) and prime minister (1868-70, 1879-93) of Austria. He succeeded as viscount in the Irish peerage in 1873.\n\nTaal, Olari (b. Aug. 7, 1953, Valga, Estonian S.S.R.), interior minister of Estonia (1998-99). He was also minister of construction (1992) and economic affairs (1992).\n\nTaba`a, Sidi Rashid al-Shakir Sahib al- (b. c. 1795 - d. [strangled] Sept. 11, 1837, Bardo palace, near Tunis, Tunisia), prime minister of Tunisia (1829-37).\n\nTabacaru, Nicolae (b. Aug. 20, 1955, Tarutino [now Tarutyne] rayon, Odessa oblast, Ukrainian S.S.R.), foreign minister of Moldova (1997-2000). He was also ambassador to Germany (2001-03).\n\nTabacci, Bruno (b. August 1946, Quistello, Lombardia, Italy), president of Lombardia (1987-89).\n\nTabachnyk, Dmytro (Volodymyrovych) (b. Nov. 26, 1963, Kiev, Ukrainian S.S.R.), a deputy prime minister of Ukraine (2002-05, 2006-07). He was also head of the office of the president (1994-96) and minister of education and science (2010-14) and youth and sport (2010-13).\n\nTabai\n\nTabai, Ieremia (Tienang) (b. Dec. 16, 1950, Nonouti island, Gilbert and Ellice Islands [now in Kiribati]), president of Kiribati (1979-82, 1983-91). In 1974 he was returned to the House of Assembly of the Gilbert and Ellice Islands by the Nonouti constituency and later became the recognized \"leader of the opposition\" in a system characterized by loose coalitions of like-minded members rather than by formal political parties. In opposition he was a consistent critic of the centralist tendencies of Chief Minister Naboua Ratieta's government, of its somewhat extravagant plans for a costly defense force, and of increasing westernization in government and lifestyles. He championed the virtues of traditional Gilbertese culture, publicized the grievances of village-dwelling copra farmers, and criticized the government expenditure on Tarawa at the expense of the \"outer islands.\" In 1978 Tabai became chief minister. Prior to independence, he proved himself to be a shrewd negotiator when he led his government in discussions with the U.K. over a financial settlement. Also at issue were the demands (not met) of the Banabans that their ancestral homeland of Ocean Island, now a barren wasteland because of phosphate mining, should be separated from Kiribati. In 1979 Tabai was made a companion of St. Michael and St. George by Queen Elizabeth II. When the Gilbert Islands became independent Kiribati on July 12, 1979, Tabai became its first president. He was knighted (G.C.M.G.) in 1982, but does not generally use the title Sir. Retiring from the presidency after serving the maximum three terms allowed by the constitution, he served as secretary-general of the South Pacific Forum (1992-98). In 1999 he was fined for trying to establish an independent radio station. In 2000 he founded a newspaper, the Kiribati Newstar.\n\nTabani, Ashraf W(ali Mohammad) (b. Dec. 17, 1930 - d. July 16, 2009, Karachi, Pakistan), governor of Sindh (1987-88).\n\nTabera, Félix, interior and justice minister of Bolivia (1937).\n\nTabet\n\nTabet, Ayoub, Arabic Ayyub Thabit (b. 1875?, Beirut, Lebanon - d. Feb. 16, 1947), interior minister (1928), acting prime minister (1936-37, 1943), and acting president (1943) of Lebanon.\n\nTabeyev, Fikryat (Ahmedzhanovich) (b. March 4, 1928, Azeyev village, Ryazan oblast, Russian S.F.S.R. - d. June 3, 2015), Soviet politician. He was first secretary of the Communist Party committee of the Tatar A.S.S.R. (1960-79), ambassador to Afghanistan (1979-86), and first deputy premier of the Russian S.F.S.R. (1986-90).\n\nTabi, Barnabas, internal affairs minister of Vanuatu (1999-2001).\n\nTabi, Sidi Yusuf Sahib al- (d.

He was also ambassador to Uruguay (1958-59) and Peru (1961-62).\n\nTabone, Anton (b. Nov. 15, 1937, Gozo island, Malta), Maltese politician; nephew of Censu Tabone. He was minister for Gozo (1987-96) and speaker of the House of Representatives (1998-2008).\n\nC. Tabone\n\nTabone, Censu, byname of Vincent Tabone (b. March 30, 1913, Victoria, Gozo, Malta - d. March 14, 2012, St. Julian's, Malta), foreign minister (1987-89) and president (1989-94) of Malta. He was also minister of labour, employment, and welfare (1966-71).\n\nTabor, Hans (Rasmussen) (b.

Aug. 1, 1939, Copciac, Romania [now in Moldova]), governor of Gagauzia (1995-99, 2002-06).\n\nTaché\n\nTaché, Sir Étienne Paschal (b. Sept. 5, 1795, Saint-Thomas, Lower Canada [now Quebec] - d. July 30, 1865, Saint-Thomas), joint premier of Canada (1855-57, 1864-65). He fought with the British in the War of 1812 and entered active political life with the first elections for the united province of Canada, being elected member for the riding of L'Islet (1841). From 1841 to 1846, he remained in the background of the major political debates and spoke little in the House of Assembly. But when Taché gave a speech in 1846 on the need to establish a militia in Lower Canada, his colleagues took notice. Only two months after his speech, the Draper-Papineau government named him deputy adjutant-general of the militia, responsible for reorganizing the Lower Canadian armed forces. In 1848, he was appointed to the Executive Council and named commissioner of public works in the Baldwin-Lafontaine administration. He was receiver general in several administrations from 1849 to 1857. In 1855-56, he formed a government with Sir Allan Napier MacNab. When MacNab was forced to resign, Taché chose John Alexander Macdonald to form a new government. This coalition was the first sign of an alliance between Liberals in Lower Canada and Conservatives in Upper Canada. In 1857 Taché retired from politics, but he was summoned back by Macdonald in 1864. That same year he presided over the Quebec Conference, which approved the Seventy-two Resolutions that were to form the basis of the British North America Act. He was the only \"father of Confederation\" who did not live to see it. He was knighted in 1858.\n\nTachnazarov, Guychnazar (Tachnazarovich), Turkmen Guýçnazar (Taçnazarowiç) Taçnazarow (b. 1951, Kizyl-Arvat, Ashkhabad oblast, Turkmen S.S.R.

Feb. 22, 1898, Seoul), regent of Korea (1864-73); father of King Kojong. He was born as a distant relative of the royal family and as such held no position in the government. However, when King Ch'oljong died in 1864, leaving no suitable heir to the throne, Yi Ha-ung's minor son was picked as the successor, with him as regent. He assumed the title Taewon-gun (\"Prince of the Great Court\"). He engaged in extensive national rebuilding programs while taking a strongly isolationist stand, in stark contrast to Japan's open-door policy during this period. He inaugurated a far-ranging reform program to strengthen the monarchy, weaken the power of the factions and great clans, and enhance the revenue of the state; he modernized and increased the armies and rationalized the administration. He successfully mobilized the nation against the small but better-equipped naval detachments sent by France and the United States and rejected Japanese and Western overtures for trade and diplomatic relations. As it was customary that the king's in-laws enjoyed power in the court, he did everything to prevent a threat from this quarter, and when his son was 16 he selected an orphaned girl among his wife's relatives, Min, as the new queen, thinking to be safe with this woman. He underestimated her cleverness, however, and she allied with his enemies. By 1873, they had enough power to oust him; his son, anyway, had reached the age of 21. Seeing his anti-foreign policies being reversed, he in 1882 inspired a rebellion against the supporters of Queen Min and their alleged Japanese allies; he temporarily returned to power, but a Chinese force soon arrived and took him as a prisoner to China for three years.\n\nTaezaz, Blattengeta Lorenzo (Mebrhatu) (b. June 30, 1900 - d. June 23, 1947, Stockholm, Sweden), foreign minister of Ethiopia (1941-42).

Taft\n\nTaft, Alphonso (b. Nov. 5, 1810, Townshend, Vt. - d. May 21, 1891, San Diego, Calif.), U.S. secretary of war (1876) and attorney general (1876-77). He was also minister to Austria-Hungary (1882) and Russia (1884-85).\n\nB. Taft\n\nTaft, Bob, byname of Robert Alphonso Taft III (b. Jan. 8, 1942, Boston, Mass.), governor of Ohio (1999-2007); grandson of Robert A. Taft. He served in the Peace Corps teaching at a boarding school in Tanzania (1963-65), and in Vietnam with the State Department (1967-69). Embarking on a political career as a Republican, he was elected to the Ohio House of Representatives in 1976, served four years, then was elected Hamilton County commissioner. He wanted to be governor in 1990, but GOP leaders persuaded him to step aside to avoid a nasty primary fight with George Voinovich, who went on to serve two terms in the office. Taft instead became Ohio secretary of state (1991-99). He was rewarded for his patience in 1998, winning the gubernatorial race 50%-45% over his Democratic opponent, former state attorney general Lee Fisher. In his first year in office he fulfilled many of his campaign promises. He made several tax cuts, but later the financial situation forced him to raise taxes again. In February 2002 he announced his $1.6 billion, 10-year Third Frontier Project to fund biomedical research and support industries and high-tech products with growth potential. He was unopposed in the 2002 Republican primary and raised huge sums, eventually $12 million. The Democratic nomination went to former Cuyahoga County commissioner Tim Hagan, a spirited liberal who had trouble raising money, eventually netting $1 million. Taft, who angered some conservatives when he named as his lieutenant governor candidate Columbus councilwoman Jennette Bradley, a supporter of abortion rights, won 58%-38%. Swept up in a state investment scandal that led to his own no contest plea to ethics law violations in 2005, he ended his tenure as one of the most unpopular governors in the country.\n\nTaft, Charles P(helps) (b. Sept. 20, 1897, Cincinnati, Ohio - d. June 23, 1983, Cincinnati), mayor of Cincinnati (1955-57); son of William Howard Taft; brother of Robert A. Taft.\n\nR.A. Taft\n\nTaft, Robert A(lphonso) (b. Sept. 8, 1889, Cincinnati, Ohio - d. July 31, 1953, New York City), U.S. politician; son of William Howard Taft. He served during World War I as assistant counsel for the U.S. Food Administration (1917-18) and then with the American Relief Administration (1919). A Republican, he became a member of the Ohio House of Representatives (1921-26) and the state Senate (1931-32). Elected to the U.S. Senate in 1938, when the Republican Party was slowly reviving, he lost no time in establishing himself as a powerful influence, hammering away at the \"vain, immoral, and dangerous\" precepts of the New Deal, denouncing its \"socialistic trends,\" defending traditional American \"individualism,\" and calling for a balanced budget and less centralization of power in Washington. He was also an outspoken anti-interventionist, though after the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor (1941) he supported the war effort. He was reelected by a narrow margin in 1944, but with the election of a Republican-majority Congress in 1946, his importance increased. Often called \"Mr. Republican,\" he dominated the party's Senate policy committee, and his most notable achievement was the passage of the Taft-Hartley Labor Relations Act (1947), which placed restrictions on organized labour. Though he retreated somewhat from his earlier isolationism, he still opposed U.S. involvement in world affairs. This, and his unexciting personality, were reasons for his failure to win the Republican presidential nomination. He had already been a favourite-son candidate in 1936, but had the most support in 1948, when he lost to Thomas E. Dewey, and in 1952, when he lost to Dwight D. Eisenhower. In January 1953 Taft (who had won a third term by an overwhelming majority in 1950) became Senate majority leader.\n\nTaft, Royal C(hapin) (b. Feb. 14, 1823, Northbridge, Mass. - d. June 4, 1912, Providence, R.I.), governor of Rhode Island (1888-89).\n\nW.H. Taft\n\nTaft, William Howard (b. Sept. 15, 1857, Cincinnati, Ohio - d. March 8, 1930, Washington, D.C.), president of the United States (1909-13); son of Alphonso Taft. He held local political offices until 1887, when he became a judge of the superior court of Ohio. He then served as U.S. solicitor general (1890-92) and as judge of the U.S. Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals (1892-1900). In 1900 he was persuaded by Pres. William McKinley to give up his judgeship to serve as chairman of the second Philippine Commission, charged with organizing civil government in the islands following the Spanish-American War (1898). Having achieved the end of military rule, he became the first civilian governor in 1901 and thereafter concentrated on the economic development of the islands. He served with great distinction and became popular with the Philippine people. He refused to leave the post when offered appointment to the Supreme Court. When, in 1904, he was named secretary of war, he left with the stipulation that he could continue to supervise Philippine affairs. Pres. Theodore Roosevelt, declining to run for reelection in 1908, threw his support behind Taft, who won the Republican nomination and went on to an easy victory at the polls over the Democratic candidate, William Jennings Bryan. Progressives were disappointed with Taft, and the last months of his unspectacular administration were clouded by a growing breach with Roosevelt, whose increasing radicalism alienated the incumbent. When Taft reluctantly ran for a second term in 1912 against Roosevelt, who ran as a Progressive, the Democrat Woodrow Wilson benefited from the split and won. In 1921 Taft was appointed chief justice of the United States. In declining health, he resigned in February 1930 and died the next month.\n\nTaft, William Howard, III (b. Aug. 7, 1915, Bar Harbor, Maine - d. Feb. 23, 1991, Washington, D.C.), U.S. diplomat; son of Robert A. Taft.

Aug. 31, 1879, Tokyo, Japan - d. Dec. 25, 1926, Hayama, Japan), emperor of Japan (1912-26). The third son of the Meiji-tenno, Yoshihito was proclaimed heir apparent on his 8th birthday, after his two elder brothers died, and he was declared crown prince on Nov. 3, 1889. In 1897 he took his seat in the House of Peers. He married Princess Sadako, a daughter of Prince Michitaka Kujo, in 1900 and had four sons: Hirohito, Yasuhito, Nobuhito, and Takahito. On the death of his father in July 1912, he became, by the official count, the 123rd emperor of Japan. Owing to the national mourning the formal ceremony of enthronement did not take place until November 1915. Unlike his predecessor, he played almost no political role. His physical and mental faculties were increasingly impaired by a series of strokes after 1919, and Crown Prince Hirohito was appointed prince regent in 1921. His reign, referred to as the Taisho (\"Great Righteousness\") era, was marked by foreign policies congenial to Western powers, especially to Great Britain and the United States. These included participation in World War I on the Allied side, the anti-Bolshevik intervention in Siberia, and participation in the Washington disarmament conference. Japan continued the modernization of its economy, and there was a political liberalization, as characterized by an expansion of the suffrage, that led historians to speak of the period of \"Taisho Democracy.\"\n\nTait, Sir (William Eric) Campbell (b.

Feb. 26, 1924, Kakeya village, Shimane prefecture, Japan - d. June 19, 2000, Tokyo, Japan), prime minister of Japan (1987-89). He was a member of the Shimane prefectural assembly (1951-58) before being elected to the lower house of the Diet (parliament). His first ministerial post was as chief cabinet secretary (1971-72, 1974); he later was minister of construction (1976) and finance (1979-80, 1982-86). Within the Liberal-Democratic Party (LDP), he belonged to the pivotal faction led by Kakuei Tanaka. However, in February 1985, he inaugurated his own study group, Soseikai. Although this same ploy had previously been used by Tanaka to establish a personal power base within the ranks of the Eisaku Sato faction, Takeshita's move reportedly infuriated Tanaka. Takeshita was secretary-general of the LDP in 1986-87. In July 1987 he set up his own faction. In October 1987 he was handpicked for the post of president of the LDP (and thus prime minister) by his predecessor, Yasuhiro Nakasone. He is most remembered for helping to pass an unpopular sales tax. In April 1988 he admitted that he was among those politicians who had received stock and cash donations from Recruit, a Japanese company which sought to win special treatment for its businesses. Three cabinet ministers were forced to resign; Takeshita himself toughed it out for months, but with both his own and the LDP's popularity on the rocks - public support at one point plunged to a mere 3% or less - he finally accepted his fate and resigned in 1989. Takeshita, long regarded as one of Japan's \"shadow shoguns,\" played one of his last political cards when he selected protégé Keizo Obuchi (to whom he had turned over his faction in 1992) for premier in 1998. He retired from politics in May 2000.\n\nTakesy, Asterio R. (b. May 25, 1944, Ulul island, Truk [now Chuuk], Micronesia [now in Federated States of Micronesia]), foreign minister of the Federated States of Micronesia (1990-91 [acting], 1996-97).

Jan. 16, 1856 [Dec. 9, 1855, lunar calendar], in present Saga prefecture, Japan - d. Dec. 22, 1938), finance minister of Japan (1915-16). He was also minister of communications (1914-15).\n\nTakeuchi, Ryuji (b. May 1, 1903, Beijing, China - d. Sept. 6, 1999), Japanese diplomat.

April 18, 1874, Belgorod, Russia - d. [executed] May 27, 1930, Moscow, Russian S.F.S.R.), Russian minister of communications (1917).\n\nTakhtarov, Adil-Girey (b. 1886, Kumtorkala, Dagestan oblast [now republic], Russia - d. 1962), chairman of the Central Executive Committee (1937-38) and of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet (1938-50) of the Dagestan A.S.S.R.\n\nTaki, Makoto (b. Sept. 15, 1938), justice minister of Japan (2012, 2012).\n\nTaki A.\n\nTaki Abdoulkarim, Mohamed (b. Feb. 20, 1936, Mbeni, Grande Comore, Comoros - d. Nov. 6, 1998, Beit Salam, Moroni, Comoros), president of the Comoros (1996-98). He was minister of development (1970-71), education (1971-72), rural development (1972-73), equipment (1973-75), and interior (1975) and speaker of the Federal Assembly (1982-84), then went into exile in France. Returning in 1990, he unsuccessfully challenged Said Mohamed Djohar in presidential elections, then went back into exile. Emerging again in 1992, he served briefly as Djohar's government coordinator, but was dismissed and later was linked to an abortive coup attempt. He went back into hiding until September 1995 when he supported the overthrow of Djohar by Robert Denard's mercenaries and was briefly installed as co-president until French troops landed and ousted the mercenaries. In March 1996 he emerged as winner of presidential elections in the coup-prone Indian Ocean island state. Taki, of the National Union for Democracy, took 64.2% of the votes in the second round. His opponent, Abbas Djoussouf, joined other Comoros leaders in congratulating Taki on winning what observers said was a fair and peaceful poll. Taki expressed his satisfaction with the outcome of the election. He told Radio Comoros: \"Perhaps for the first time in the history of our country, the election of a president has proceeded democratically, freely and transparently. For this we are indebted above all to France, to the French government, and to the international organizations.\" He said he would unite Comorans and would not represent any particular region. He promised an economic revival with foreign aid, though it was not clear where this would come from. When in 1997 the island of Anjouan declared its independence, he immediately sent federal troops, but this only fuelled the aggression of the secessionists. He died in office.\n\nTakiyev, Madi (Tokeshovich) (b. April 1, 1978, Bakanas, Alma-Ata oblast, Kazakh S.S.R. [now Almaty oblast, Kazakhstan]), finance minister of Kazakhstan (2024- ).\n\nTakizala (Luyanu Mwis Mbingin), Henri-Désiré (b.

Nov. 23, 1920, Cairo, Egypt), justice minister of Egypt (1976-78).\n\nTalabani\n\nTalabani, Jalal (Husamuddin) (b. 1933, Kelkan village, northern Iraq - d. Oct. 3, 2017, Berlin, Germany), president of the Governing Council (2003) and president (2005-14) of Iraq. As a young man he was quickly seduced by the Kurdish struggle for a homeland to unite a people scattered across Iraq, Iran, Turkey, and Syria. He joined the Kurdistan Democratic Party (KDP) of Mustafa Barzani and took to the hills in a first uprising against the Iraqi government in 1961. But he famously fell out with Barzani who sued for peace with Baghdad - the start of a long and costly internecine feud among Iraqi Kurds. Talabani joined a KDP splinter faction in 1964 and fled to neighbouring Iran in protest. He formalized the breakup in 1975 by establishing his Patriotic Union of Kurdistan after Barzani's forces, abandoned by their Iranian, U.S., and Israeli allies, were routed by the Iraqi army. In the aftermath of the 1991 Gulf War, Western intervention allowed the Kurds to reestablish control over the three most northerly provinces of Iraq, but the rebel enclave fell far short of Kurdish claims for full independence amid Turkish opposition to statehood. The rivalry between Talabani and the Barzanis, now led by Mustafa's son Massoud, degenerated to all-out war in 1993, as Talabani challenged the rival KDP monopoly over customs revenues levied at the Turkish border. The disastrous struggle climaxed with a KDP-invited invasion and reconquest of Arbil by Iraqi forces in 1996. True rapprochement came only in 2002, when it became clear that Washington intended to overthrow Saddam Hussein. Talabani and Barzani then set aside their rivalries and united to safeguard their gains. In 2005, after the first election since the U.S.-led invasion in 2003, Talabani became president of Iraq, while Barzani became president of autonomous Kurdistan. Talabani was reelected in 2006 and 2010, cementing his people's powerful role on the national stage after suffering years as second-class citizens. A close ally of the United States, he won plaudits for striving to smooth strained relations with Syria and Iran as part of efforts to end the two regional powers' suspected efforts to feed the insurgency in Iraq. After suffering a stroke in 2012, he left for treatment in Germany, only returning shortly before the end of his term in 2014.\n\nTalagi\n\nTalagi, Sir Toke (Tufukia) (b. Jan. 9, 1951, Alofi, Niue - d. July 14, 2020, Niue), premier of Niue (2008-20); knighted 2016. He was also minister of finance (2002-05, 2008-20) and tourism (2002).\n\nTalake\n\nTalake, Koloa (Fineaso) (b. June 7, 1934, Vaitupu, Gilbert and Ellice Islands [now in Tuvalu] - d. May 26, 2008), finance minister (1993-96) and prime minister (2001-02) of Tuvalu. He was auditor of the Gilbert and Ellice Islands (1973-75), then auditor (1976-77) and financial secretary (1977-78) of Tuvalu. As MP for Vaitupu since 1993, he moved the censure motion that forced Prime Minister Bikenibeu Paeniu to resign in 1999. Another no-confidence vote, against Faimalaga Luka, led to Talake becoming prime minister. In this role he considered taking legal action against the industrialized nations of the world for causing global warming. Tuvalu is predicted to be among the first countries to disappear under rising sea levels. During his term New Zealand agreed to change its immigration policies to formally admit 75 Tuvaluans a year under its Pacific Access Category, as he sought to gradually reduce Tuvalu's population. However, the prevailing sentiment in Tuvalu was that the country could not afford the kind of legal representation needed to take on major countries in court, and he lost his seat in the 2002 elections. He subsequently moved to New Zealand himself.\n\nTalal (ibn Abdul Aziz Al Saud) (b. Aug. 15, 1931 - d. Dec. 22, 2018), Saudi prince; son of Abdul Aziz.

Jan. 30, 1994, Amman, Jordan), prime minister of Jordan (1960-62, 1964-65, 1967-69, 1969-70). He became a judge in Karak in 1938 and president of the Court of Appeals in 1952 before joining the cabinet as minister of the interior (1953-54). As chief of the royal court (1954-60, 1963-64, 1969, 1973-74), he was King Hussein's chief adviser. He was first named prime minister in 1960, after Prime Minister Hazza` al-Majali's assassination, and was recalled to office three times. The self-effacing Talhouni was considered a moderate Nasserist, though loyal to King Hussein, and was thus appointed by the king whenever he wanted to improve relations with Egypt and when he wished to assert control over the cabinet. Talhouni also took up an ambiguous stand towards the Palestinian guerrillas based in Jordan, the country's major policy problem in those years: while loyal to the Jordanian establishment, he was acceptable to the guerrillas and sought an accommodation with them. He was removed each time when unpopular measures were deemed necessary. He was also foreign minister (1961, 1967-68), justice minister (1964-65), and defense and interior minister (1968). In 1974 he was named president of the Senate, a post he held until the early 1980s, and he headed many pan-Arab parliamentary committees at international events and conferences.

Feb. 29, 1896, Florence, Italy), French diplomat; son of Alexandre Daniel, baron de Talleyrand-Périgord. He was minister to Saxe-Weimar-Eisenach (1852-54), Baden (1854-56), Sardinia (1859-61), Belgium (1861-62), and Prussia (1862-64) and ambassador to Russia (1864-69).\n\nTalleyrand-Périgord, Charles Maurice de, (from 1806) prince de Bénévent (b. Feb. 2, 1754, Paris, France - d. May 17, 1838, Paris), foreign minister (1797-99, 1799-1807, 1814-15, 1815), president of the provisional government (1814), and prime minister (1815) of France. He was nominated bishop of Autun by Louis XVI (1788), elected to the Estates General (1789), and was one of the members of the Assembly selected to draw up the Declaration of Rights. He took a cynical delight in attacking the clergy to which he still nominally belonged, and proposed confiscating the landed property of the church. In 1790 he was elected president of the Assembly. In 1791 he consecrated two \"constitutional\" bishops, was excommunicated, and gave up his clerical career. Early in 1792 he was sent to London, but failed to conciliate William Pitt the Younger; in December he was placed on the list of émigrés. He remained in exile until January 1794, when the Alien Act drove him to the U.S. After the fall of Maximilien Robespierre he returned to Paris (1796) and was made foreign minister under the Directory (1797). For a time he was in disgrace, but he resumed his post after helping Napoléon Bonaparte gain power under the Consulate (1799). Recognizing the latter's genius, he was greatly instrumental in consolidating Napoléon's power as consul for life (1802) and as emperor (1804). He shared responsibility with Napoléon for the organization (1806) of the Confederation of the Rhine, but soon after withdrew from the ministry, though he still served as grand chamberlain (1804-09). At Erfurt (1808), he revealed state secrets to Russia and mortally offended Napoléon, after the disasters in Spain, by making tentative arrangements for the succession. He was opposed to the invasion of Russia (1812) and on this basis deserted Napoléon. In 1814 he dictated to the Senate the terms of Napoléon's deposition, and became foreign minister under Louis XVIII. He negotiated the treaty by which the allies left France in possession of the boundaries of 1792, and at the Congress of Vienna (1814-15) he established France's right to take part on equal terms. After the second Restoration, he became prime minister, but was soon forced out by the ultraroyalists. He was Louis-Philippe's chief adviser at the July Revolution (1830) and went to London as ambassador, retiring in 1834.\n\nTallgren, Carl Olof (Kristian) (b. Jan. 28, 1927, Turku, Finland - d.

April 27, 1942, Tepas, Netherlands East Indies [now in Timor Tengah Selatan regency, Nusa Tenggara Timur, Indonesia] - d. April 25, 2009, Jakarta, Indonesia), governor of Nusa Tenggara Timur (1998-2008).\n\nTalmadge, Eugene (b. Sept. 23, 1884, Forsyth, Ga. - d. Dec. 21, 1946, Atlanta, Ga.), governor of Georgia (1933-37, 1941-43).\n\nH. Talmadge\n\nTalmadge, Herman (Eugene) (b. Aug. 9, 1913, near McRae, Ga. - d. March 21, 2002, Hampton, Ga.), governor of Georgia (1947, 1948-55). His father, Eugene, was governor-elect when he died in December 1946. The Talmadge machine maintained that the legislature, which it dominated, should pick the new governor from among the candidates who had lost in November. Conveniently, one of them was the younger Talmadge, who had received some write-in votes. Herman Talmadge won the legislative vote but was kept from the governor's office by outgoing Gov. Ellis Arnall, who contended Lieutenant Governor-elect M.E. Thompson was his rightful successor. When Arnall departed for the night, Talmadge supporters took over the governor's office and mansion, and Arnall found his way blocked by state troopers. The state Supreme Court eventually ruled in favour of Thompson, but Talmadge beat him in a special election in 1948 and won a four-year term in 1950. As governor, he imposed a sales tax and used the money to overhaul schools, hospitals, and roads. In 1956 he was elected to the U.S. Senate, where he became part of the Southern coalition that for a time obstructed civil rights legislation. But when Leroy Johnson in 1962 became the first black elected to the Georgia legislature since Reconstruction, Talmadge invited him to breakfast at his mansion. Still, Talmadge voted against the 1964 civil rights and the 1965 voting rights bills, though by 1975 he voted to extend the voting rights act. In 1973 he served on the Senate Watergate committee. In 1980, after he was denounced by the Senate for financial irregularities and admitted to an alcohol problem, he was unseated by the first Republican to win a Georgia Senate race since Reconstruction.\n\nTalmage, Thomas G.

Oct. 27, 1917, Kantolo village, near Bizana, East Pondoland, Cape province [now in Eastern Cape], South Africa - d. April 24, 1993, Johannesburg, South Africa), South African political activist. He joined the African National Congress (ANC) in 1943. In 1944 he and Nelson Mandela were among the founders of the ANC Youth League. Tambo became a member of the ANC executive council in 1949 and was appointed secretary-general in 1955. Arrested on treason charges in 1956, he was released the following year and in 1958 became ANC deputy president-general. In 1960, when word leaked out that the ANC would be banned, he managed to slip out of the country, and during the following 30 years he almost singlehandedly built up the external and military wings of the ANC while the organization was banned and many of its leaders, including Mandela, imprisoned. He became acting president-general when Albert Luthuli died in 1967, and he was approved as president-general by the Morogoro conference in 1969. His success in isolating Pretoria and mustering international condemnation of apartheid was often measured by the fact that by 1989 the ANC had more representatives abroad than the government. His speeches were free of rhetoric and ideology and reflected the thoughtful and serious mind of a devoted family man. After the ban on the ANC was lifted, Tambo, who had led its operations mainly from Lusaka (Zambia) and London, returned home in triumph in December 1990, but a stroke he had suffered in 1989 left him unable to continue his executive duties. In July 1991 Mandela was named ANC president-general, and Tambo was given the largely honorary post of national chairman.\n\nTambroni\n\nTambroni (Armaroli), Fernando (b.

In 1921, when the revolutionary Guangdong army entered Guangxi, he fled from office with another pro-Beijing general, Lu Rongting. Later he gained sufficient support from Beijing and made his way back to Guangxi, but his forces were soon defeated by Shen Hongying. He went to Shanghai afterwards, where he was killed by his guard.\n\nTan Siew Sin, Tun (b. May 21, 1916, Malacca, Straits Settlements [now in Malaysia] - d.

Feb. 1, 1909, Tokyo, Japan), justice minister of Japan (1880-81, 1891-92). He was also minister to France (1887-90).\n\nG. Tanaka\n\nTanaka, Giichi, in full Danshaku (Baron) Giichi Tanaka (b. June 22, 1863, Hagi, Nagato province [now in Yamaguchi prefecture], Japan - d. Sept. 29, 1929, Tokyo, Japan), prime minister of Japan (1927-29). A protégé of Aritomo Yamagata, he had a distinguished career in the army and during 1910-13 was director of the Military Affairs Bureau. As minister of war (1918-21, 1923-24), he forcefully advocated, and then vigorously prosecuted, the Japanese campaign in Siberia against the new Soviet regime in Russia. Dreaming of a Japanese empire in Siberia, he conspired with his military associates to send many times the number of troops originally agreed upon and to keep them there long after other countries had withdrawn their forces. Tanaka, who was created a baron and promoted to general in 1920, was one of the most bitterly criticized ministers in Japan. Elected president of the dominant Friends of Constitutional Government (Rikken Seiyukai) political party and retiring from the army in 1925, he became prime minister and foreign minister in 1927. He promoted legislation inflicting the death penalty on revolutionists and subversives. His \"strong-arm\" policy with respect to China earned him sharp criticism at home and abroad. In 1928 he intervened to block the progress of Chiang Kai-shek's Northern Expedition and Jinan was occupied. He was particularly adamant about retaining Japanese control in southern Manchuria. However, the so-called \"Tanaka Memorial,\" supposedly a report to the emperor in which he urged Japanese expansion in China, is apparently a forgery. His failure to persuade the army to punish officers involved in the assassination of the Manchurian warlord Zhang Zuolin led to the fall of his cabinet in July 1929.\n\nTanaka, Hisaichi, also called Hisakazu Tanaka (b. 1889 - d. March 1947, Guangzhou, China), Japanese governor of Hong Kong (1944-45). He was condemned to death and executed as a war criminal.\n\nTanaka, Isaji (b. Jan. 3, 1906, Hyogo prefecture, Japan - d. April 11, 1987), justice minister of Japan (1966-67, 1972-73). He was also director-general of the Autonomy Agency (1956-57).\n\nK. Tanaka\n\nTanaka, Kakuei (b. May 4, 1918, Kariwa, Niigata prefecture, Japan - d. Dec. 16, 1993, Tokyo, Japan), prime minister of Japan (1972-74). One of the richest men in Japan, he was elected to parliament in 1947 as a candidate of the Democratic Party, and the following year joined the newly formed Democratic Liberal Party, a forerunner of the Liberal-Democratic Party (LDP). Building the most powerful, tightly knit faction of the LDP, he became minister of postal services and communications (1957-58), finance (1962-64), and international trade and industry (1971-72) and was made secretary-general of the LDP in 1965 and 1968. In 1972 he succeeded Prime Minister Eisaku Sato in a surprising upset victory over Sato's chosen successor, Takeo Fukuda. He opened diplomatic relations with the People's Republic of China and advocated a policy of redistributing industry across the nation. In the elections of July 1974 his party made a poor showing. In December he was forced to resign in disgrace, dogged by questions about his personal fortune, allegations of tax evasion, and widespread criticism that his economic policies sparked inflation. In July 1976 he was arrested for allegedly accepting about $2 million in exchange for promoting the sale of Lockheed Corp. jets while in office. After a 7-year trial, during which he continued to rule over his LDP faction and thus had a major voice in the selection of prime ministers, he was convicted of graft in October 1983 and sentenced to four years in prison. A subsequent appeal was rejected by the Tokyo High Court in July 1987, but he remained free pending an appeal to the Supreme Court, which was still unresolved when he died. His influence waned after he suffered a serious stroke in February 1985; his faction split up in July 1987 and he finally retired from politics in October 1989.\n\nTanaka, Keishu (b. March 6, 1938, Namie, Fukushima prefecture, Japan - d. Jan. 4, 2022, Yokohama, Japan), justice minister of Japan (2012).\n\nM. Tanaka\n\nTanaka, Makiko (b. Jan. 14, 1944, Niigata prefecture, Japan), foreign minister of Japan (2001-02); daughter of Kakuei Tanaka; wife of Naoki Tanaka. She was first elected to the Diet in 1993, representing her father's old district in Niigata prefecture. She served as head of the Science and Technology Agency in 1994-95 but became popular for her cutting commentary about her colleagues in the Liberal-Democratic Party (LDP). During a three-way race for the party leadership in 1998, for instance, she remarked that it was an unfortunate battle between \"a militarist, a yokel, and a weirdo.\" By 2001 her straight talk, down-to-earth approach, and determination to end the factional rivalries, backroom deals, and scandals that rocked the ruling LDP had made her the most admired politician in the country. She was an effective campaign supporter of reformist candidate Junichiro Koizumi (the \"weirdo\"), who was elected prime minister in April 2001 and then appointed her Japan's first female foreign minister. Less than three months into her job Maki, as she was affectionately known, came under fire for allegedly moving away from Japan's neutral position on a proposed U.S. missile shield and possibly damaging ties with the country's most important ally. After initially balking at Koizumi's orders to dismiss Tokyo's ambassador to Washington, she was barred from representing Japan at the UN General Assembly in November. In January 2002 she was unceremoniously dumped over a feud with Foreign Ministry bureaucrats and the LDP old guard. The official line was that the bickering was holding up passage of the budget. She was also lambasted in the press for crying on camera in the spat that led to her sacking. In June she was suspended from the LDP after refusing to cooperate with a party probe into graft allegations. She resigned her seat in parliament in August.\n\nTanaka, Naoki, original surname Suzuki (b. June 19, 1940, Kanazawa, Ishikawa, Japan), defense minister of Japan (2012).\n\nTanaka, Yasuo (b.

July 19, 2020, St. Petersburg, Russia), prime minister of Kyrgyzstan (2002-05). He was independent Kyrgyzstan's first ethnic Russian prime minister. He fled to Russia following the protests in March 2005 that led to the ouster of Pres. Askar Akayev. In June an international arrest warrant was issued for him as he was accused of illegally transferring state funds to a private business run by his son. He later returned to Kyrgyzstan, and after being questioned by the prosecutor-general's office in Bishkek, he was released on condition that he stays in the country while investigations are going on. In September, however, he was arrested at a border crossing with Kazakhstan, trying to exit the country. He then was to remain under arrest until the end of the investigation. On May 4, 2006, it was announced that \"all criminal cases\" against him had been closed due to \"his poor health.\" He was also allowed to leave the country for Russia.\n\nTanchev (Zhelev), Petur (b. July 12, 1920, Gledka, Bulgaria - d. July 21, 1992), justice minister (1962-66), a deputy premier (1966-71), and a first deputy premier (1971-74) of Bulgaria.\n\nTanco Armero, Nicolás (b.

Dec. 20, 1945, Denver, Colo.), U.S. politician. He was a representative from Colorado (1999-2009) and a candidate for the 2008 Republican presidential nomination.\n\nTandefelt, Adolf friherre (b. Aug. 8, 1747, Hartola socken, Finland - d. Jan. 5, 1822, Helsingfors [now Helsinki], Finland), governor of Uleåborg (1782-85) and Vasa (1785-94). He was made a Finnish friherre (baron) in 1809.\n\nTandja\n\nTandja, Mamadou (b. 1938, Maïné-Soroa, Diffa département, southeastern Niger - d. Nov. 24, 2020, Niamey, Niger), president of Niger (1999-2010). A member of the Kanouri ethnic group, he joined the army in the mid-1950s, rose to the rank of colonel, and won four prestigious decorations. As prefect of Maradi (1976-79) and Tahoua (1981-88), interior minister (1979-81, 1990-91), and ambassador to Nigeria (1988-90), Tandja was known as the \"working chief.\" He participated in most of the formative - and sometimes controversial - events since Niger won its independence from France. In 1974, during a period of severe drought and charges of corruption against Pres. Hamani Diori, Tandja was a member of the military junta that forced Hamani from power and replaced him with Gen. Seyni Kountché. Perhaps the darkest moment in Tandja's career came in 1990, when - as interior minister - he was involved in the violent repression of ethnic Tuareg rebels who had attacked a police station in the north. The rebels alleged the military government had not fulfilled promises to help develop the north or assist Tuareg nomads who had returned to Niger from neighbouring Algeria and Libya. The ensuing clash killed up to 100 rebels, and helped trigger a four-year Tuareg rebellion. Still, these darker memories seem to have been overshadowed in the national imagination by Tandja's reputation for efficiency and hard work. For example, when he served as prefect in Maradi, on the Nigerian border, he won praise from local business leaders for easing restrictions and helping facilitate cross-border trade. He retired from the army in 1991 and began a new career as a politician, winning the leadership of his political party, the National Movement for the Development of Society, and running unsuccessfully for president in 1993 and 1996. He was finally elected in 1999 and reelected in 2004. In 2005-07 he was chairman of the Economic Community of West African States. In 2009 he held a referendum to allow him a third term, but he was ousted in a military coup in 2010. He was released from prison in 2011 when corruption charges were dropped.\n\nB.D. Tandon\n\nL.

March 15, 1932, Taicang county, Jiangsu, China), premier of Taiwan (2000). He came to Taiwan with Chiang Kai-shek's Nationalist troops which lost a civil war to the Chinese Communists and fled into exile on the island in 1949. He graduated from Taiwan's Air Force Academy and began his career as a fighter pilot in the 1950s. During his more than 50 years in service, he served as Air Force Academy superintendent, commanding general of the Combat Air Command, air force commander-in-chief, and (from 1998) chief of the general staff. He became defense minister in 1999 and was one of the most popular members of the cabinet. He was instrumental in parliamentary passage of the long-delayed National Defence Law that officially put the military in the service of the country instead of the Nationalist Party. Swept to power in elections in March 2000 that ended 55 years of Nationalist rule, Pres. Chen Shui-bian of the Democratic Progressive Party appointed Nationalist veteran Tang as premier. The defeated Nationalists reluctantly agreed to let Tang serve as premier but said the party would \"neither endorse his administration nor be responsible for it.\" Chen's decision to recruit Tang was widely hailed as a wise move as it would help the president build support in the military, which had long been controlled by the Nationalists, and also in the Nationalist-dominated legislature. Also, choosing the mainland-born Tang would help promote balance where the political scene is often polarized between native-born Taiwanese like Chen and mainland immigrants like Tang. But once Tang took office in May, he found himself in the crossfire between the Nationalists and the DPP. He became Taiwan's shortest-serving premier when he resigned on health grounds in October after just four and a half months in office.\n\nTang Hualong (b. 1874, Xishui, Hubei, China - d.

November 1911 saw the founding of the Hubei Military Government, of which he was named chief advisor. He was elected speaker of the House of Representatives during Yuan Shikai's reign as a member of the (pro-Yuan) Progressive Party of China, and was named interior minister after Duan Qirui took power. The public was upset about the government's continuing acquisition of external debts to prosecute the civil war. Tang, who was returning from an official visit to the United States intended to secure war loans, was assassinated in Canada by a Kuomintang member named Wang Chang (1886-1918), who killed himself thereafter.\n\nTang Jiaxuan\n\nTang Jiaxuan (b.

Holding posts in the Yunnan provincial army, he participated in the uprising against the Qing dynasty in 1911 and expelled Yungui (Yunnan-Guizhou) governor Li Jingxi. He maintained a high prestige in the southwestern region throughout his life. Tending to be a revolutionary, he was named one of the generalissimos of the Southern government (one of the others being Sun Yat-sen) but did not take office. He compromised with the Beijing government later, keeping his status in the south and isolating Sun Yat-sen, who was forced to leave soon. He was expelled from office in 1921 by Gu Pinzhen, but defeated the latter in 1922. He was expelled again in February 1927, through a coup by his subordinate Long Yun and Hu Ruoyu.\n\nTang Shaoyi (b. 1860, Zhongshan, Guangdong, China - d.

Early associated with the cooperative movement, he entered the Finnish parliament as a Social Democrat in 1907. He sat out the 1918 civil war, opposing the Social Democratic alliance with Communist forces, and, after the \"White\" victory, he worked successfully to revive his party along democratic parliamentary lines. Thereafter he consistently opposed Soviet encroachments on his country's independence. He was chargé d'affaires (1920-21) and minister (1921-23) to Romania before serving as prime minister in Finland's first Social Democrat administration, which was short-lived. Later he became finance minister (1937-39). At the outbreak of the Winter War, he engineered the downfall of the cabinet in a move widely understood as a means of installing a war government. Serving as foreign minister (1939-40), he supported the government's hard line against Soviet demands and largely consolidated the Finnish working class behind the war effort. After the peace of March 1940, he became minister of supply, but Soviet pressure forced his resignation in August. With the resumption of the war, he became minister of commerce and industry (1941-42) and then of finance (1942-44). After the armistice, the Communists accused him of being one of those \"responsible for the war.\" He was arrested on Nov. 6, 1945, and sentenced to 5½ years' imprisonment on Feb. 21, 1946.

Jan. 9, 1852, Kashan, Persia), Persian statesman. By his abilities, he rapidly advanced within the administration. In 1829, as a junior member of a Persian mission to St. Petersburg, he observed the power of Russia and concluded that fundamental reforms were needed if Persia was to maintain its sovereignty. As state accountant in Azarbaijan he witnessed the inadequacies of Persian provincial administration. As head of the Persian mission to the \"Erzurum Conference,\" which was held in 1843-46 to deal with Ottoman-Persian territorial disputes, he studied the progress another Islamic government had made toward modernization. In 1847 he was appointed to the court of the crown prince, Naser ad-Din, in Azarbaijan. With the death of Shah Mohammad Qajar in 1848, Taqi was largely responsible for ensuring the crown prince's succession to the throne. Out of gratitude, the young monarch appointed him chief minister and gave him the hand of his own sister in marriage. At this time he took the title of Amir Kabir. He made strenuous efforts to introduce modernizing reforms. Government expenditure was slashed and a distinction made between the privy and public purses. He took steps towards the secularization of legal systems, toleration towards religious minorities, publication of newspapers, foundation of modern factories and schools. A new secular college was established for training a new cadre of administrators and acquainting them with Western techniques. Excessively formal writing in government documents was banned. He created many domestic and foreign enemies for himself by limiting bribery and abuses of power by government officials and court dignitaries, and by opposing the Anglo-Russian interventions in Persian affairs. The queen mother convinced the young shah that Taqi wanted to usurp the throne. In November 1851 the shah dismissed him and exiled him to Kashan, where he was killed on the shah's orders two months later.\n\nTaquary, José Antonio de Calazans Rodrigues, (2º) barão de (b.

He was a junior official in the press department of the Afghan government in the late 1940s, and press attaché at the Afghan embassy in Washington, D.C., in 1952-53. On returning to Kabul he worked as a translator for U.S. agencies and started his own translation bureau. In 1965 he founded the People's Democratic Party of Afghanistan, which split into two factions in 1967. After the overthrow of the monarchy in July 1973 by Sardar Mohammad Daud Khan, one faction, known as Parcham (\"Banner\"), supported the Daud regime while Taraki's Khalq (\"Masses\") faction opposed it. In 1977, however, the two factions, possibly under Soviet pressure, reunited, with Taraki as secretary-general. A noted writer, he held strong pro-Communist views, and the Daud government jailed him for a brief period. In 1978, with the help of Soviet-trained army units, he overthrew Daud, who was killed with all his family, and became president o"
