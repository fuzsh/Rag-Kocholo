        "text": "Arizona birth records between 1887 and 1935 include child's name, gender, date of birth, father's name, mother's name, and county of birth. In addition, each record includes an image of the original birth certificate. This index and images are provided courtesy of the Arizona Department of Health Services.<br>Statewide registration of births in Arizona officially began in 1909, although some registration existed prior to this date. Only records dating 75 years or older are available to the public.<br><br>Birth records represent one of the key primary sources for family information, typically being issued within days of a birth and containing the parents' names at a minimum. Many times they contain additional parental details including places of birth, ages, number of children and religious affiliation for baptism and christening records."
