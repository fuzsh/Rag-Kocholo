        "text": "With October comes that most weird of all holidays, Halloween. You know, the night when kids dress up in strange costumes and extort candy from their neighbors. Not just kids, of course. I’ve been known to enjoy dressing up in a strange costume for the holiday myself. (When I say strange in regards to myself, I don’t mean my regular daily attire – which some may see as strange.)\n\nSo I’m casting about once again for an amusing Halloween getup. So far, I’ve found:\n\n1. An eggplant costume.\n\n2. A masked professional wrestler costume.\n\n3. A Number 2 pencil costume.\n\nAnd my current favorite,\n\n4. A Price is Right contestant costume, complete with one-bid scoreboard. Keeping my eye out for that just-right getup for candy extortion takes time, but I’ll never slight the time I give to the trivia. Here you are, this week’s serving… enjoy!\n\nDid you know…\n\n…crocodiles can gallop? Like all four-legged animals, crocs have a full range of four-footed footfall patterns, including the gallop. They may not be the most graceful when doing so, but then, they are crocodiles. (Git along, little doggie – er, croccie!)\n\n…the state of Montana has about three times as many cows as it has people? (A very a-moo-sing statistic that is, in the end, udder-ly worthless.)\n\n…horses and cows dream? Strangely, they only do so when they sleep lying down. If they sleep standing up, researchers say they do not dream. (What do horses and cows dream about, anyway?)\n\n…for the average touch typist, their left hand does more than half of the work? For most people, the left hand does 56% of the work in regular typing. (Hunt-and-peck typing doesn’t count toward that statistic.)\n\n…only one continent on Earth has no active volcanoes? You might think it’s Antarctica, but you’d be incorrect – Mt. Erebus is one of two active volcanoes at the bottom of the world, the other being Deception Island. The only continent with no active volcanoes is Australia. (Funny how the coldest place on Earth has some of the hottest mountains, isn’t it?)\n\n…the space program of the Soviet Union was run very cheaply? Though the USSR space program produced numerous “firsts” – first artificial satellite, first man in space, first man-made object to touch another planet – it was a bare-bones operation as far as money was concerned. Case in point: the space suit worn by cosmonaut Yuri Gagarin (1934-1968), the first man to go into space in April of 1961 aboard Vostok 1. Depending on the source you consult, Gagarin’s suit was either the only one they had, or one of just three – and all fitted to him. For the flight of Vostok 2 in August of 1961, cosmonaut Gherman Titov (1935-2000) had to have one of Gagarin’s space suits re-tailored to fit his body, rather than make a new one, due to budget constraints. Additional trivia note: Titov remains the youngest person ever to go into orbit around the Earth. He was 25 years 11 months old when he made his first trip into orbit. Titov was the youngest ever to go into space until 2021, when Oliver Daemen (born 2002) flew a suborbital mission aboard the Blue Origin NS-16 space flight at the age of 18. (I knew the Soviets were in financial trouble when they had to light a fuse to get a rocket off the pad one day.)\n\n…falling asleep quickly may not be a good thing? A healthy sleeper takes about fifteen minutes to fall asleep. If you’re going to sleep in less than five minutes, you may be suffering from sleep deprivation. (I’m not a doctor of medicine, nor do I play one on television, so don’t take my word for it. Go see your favorite family physician, posthaste.)\n\n…nearly 3% of the ice in Antarctic glaciers is made of penguin urine? (No comment.)\n\n…the first voice for Mickey Mouse came from his creator? In the 1928 movie cartoon Steamboat Willie, which was the first time Mickey spoke on film, the voice was provided by creator Walt Disney (1901-1966). (Asked if he were a man or a mouse, Disney answered, “Yes.”)\n\n…more than 100 different viruses can cause the common cold? (That gives new meaning to “common,” don’t you think?)\n\n…it is probably not a good idea to put a weightlifter in a jail cell? Witness the case of Charles Rigoulot (1903-1962), a weightlifter from France. During the Nazi occupation of France in World War II, Rigoulot was jailed after he struck a German soldier. Undeterred by his circumstances, Rigoulot escaped the jail by bending the bars of the cell. He aided other prisoners to escape as well, then proceeded to beat the guard who had jailed him.\n\n…mosquitoes prefer Type O blood to all others? (How do they know this?)\n\n…one of the potential atomic bomb targets in World War II was spared due to sentiment? On the list of targets of the first atomic bombs dropped on Japanese cities, Kyoto was one of the most important. But even when it appeared a third bomb may have been necessary, Kyoto was not considered. It was taken out of consideration because U.S. Secretary of War Henry L. Stimson (1867-1950) had honeymooned in Kyoto and had fond memories of his visit there. (And he apparently wanted to have many more, too.)\n\n…you would have to eat between three and five chocolate bars to get the same amount of caffeine as in one cup of coffee? A chocolate bar contains about 30 milligrams of caffeine, while a cup of coffee has between 100 and 150 milligrams. (The eternal question… chocolate or coffee? Tune in tomorrow, friends!)\n\nNow… you know!"
