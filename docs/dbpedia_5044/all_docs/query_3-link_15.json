        "text": "Gen. Gherman Stepanovich Titov, a fighter pilot who in 1961 became the second Russian to fly in space and the first man to sleep there, died on Wednesday while taking a sauna in his apartment here, officials said today.\n\nHe turned 65 on Sept. 10. Initial reports said he died of carbon-monoxide poisoning.\n\nGeneral Titov will forever be known as the man who almost became the first person in space, the runner-up in a top-secret competition that ended in the selection of Col. Yuri A. Gagarin, a farmer's son, to make the first 108-minute trip around the world in April 1961.\n\nOn Aug. 6, Mr. Titov, a major at the time, stunned the world -- especially the United States -- by riding his 4.7-ton Vostok-2 capsule for 17 orbits and an amazing 25 hours and 11 minutes. His journey was considered a stunning feat in contrast to the American program, which had managed only to loft an astronaut on a 15-minute suborbital hop from Florida to the Bahamas.\n\nUnder public and political pressure to keep pace, the National Aeronautics and Space Administration junked a more cautious schedule of test flights and managed, more than six months later, to send Lt. Col. John H. Glenn on a three-orbit flight around the Earth.\n\nThe Titov flight was notable for two other reasons. He was the first human to sleep in a weightless atmosphere and the first to suffer from the nausea now known as space sickness, common to many astronauts.\n\nA Tass correspondent, Aleksandr Romanov, who monitored the flight, sketched a wry portrait of the astronaut as he whistled over continents early in his flight, seasick almost to incapacitation, yet forced by propaganda dictates to radio cheerful greetings to the nations below him -- even though almost nobody could pick up his weak signals.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
