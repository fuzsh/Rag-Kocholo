        "text": "Inducing the secretion of inflammatory cytokines or interferon (IFN) through the Toll-like receptor (TLR) signaling pathway (left, middle) or the IG-I-like receptor (RLR) signaling pathway (right). In the TLR signaling pathway, TLR2 recognizes signals induced by HSV-1 envelope proteins, such as gB or gD. The signal is transmitted to the cytoplasm, where MyD88 binds to the cytoplasmic domain of TLR2, leading to the activation of transcription factors like NF-kappaB. This activation promotes the translocation of P50/P65 into the nucleus and increases the expression of inflammatory cytokines and IFN-1. Additionally, TLR3, TLR7/8, and TLR9 signaling are activated by dsRNA, ssRNA, or CpG DNA, respectively, in endosomes. These signals activate IRF-3, IRF-7, and NF-kappaB, ultimately resulting in increased expression in endosomes and increased inflammatory cytokines, IFN-1, IFN-III, and interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs). In the RLR signaling pathway, RIG-I and MDA5, which contain N-terminal caspase activation and recruitment domains, recruit and activate the mitochondrial antiviral signaling (MAVS) protein to mediate signal transduction. The activated MAVS protein further activates downstream signaling, promoting the expression of inflammatory cytokines and IFN. Both pathways contribute to the immune response against HSV-1 infection by triggering the production of inflammatory cytokines and interferons, which play crucial roles in controlling viral replication and coordinating innate and adaptive immune responses.

The figure illustrates differences in morphology on 7T T2*w images between “iron dots” in Susac syndrome (red arrows) and the central vein sign (white and black arrow) as well as T2*w hypointense core lesions (blue arrows with zoom) in multiple sclerosis. T2*-weighted imaging is an MRI sequence to quantify observable or effective T2 (T2* or \"T2-star\"); in this sequence, hemorrhages and hemosiderin deposits become hypointense (Chavhan GB, Babyn PS, Thomas B, Shroff MM, Haacke EM. Principles, techniques, and applications of T2*-based MR imaging and its special applications. Radiographics 2009;29[5]:1433-49). All exemplary T2*w images in the bottom are from different patients with Susac syndrome. Note that the “iron dots” in Susac syndrome (red arrows) appear punctate and sharply delineated on T2*w. In contrast, the T2*w hypointense core lesions (blue arrows with zoom) in multiple sclerosis often appear just slightly less hyperintense on T2*w in comparison to other multiple sclerosis lesions. Only when the lesion is viewed on strongly susceptibility-weighted sequences (right) does a rather diffuse signal loss become apparent. The central vein sign in multiple sclerosis also appears as a point-like, pronounced hypointensity on T2*w images when the slice plane is perpendicular to the long axis of the multiple sclerosis lesion (white arrow). However, if the slice plane is parallel to the long axis of the lesion, the central vein sign can be recognized as a straight line running through the center of multiple sclerosis lesions (black arrow).

T2*-weighted imaging is an MRI sequence to quantify observable or effective T2 (T2* or \"T2-star\"); in this sequence, hemorrhages and hemosiderin deposits become hypointense (Chavhan GB, Babyn PS, Thomas B, Shroff MM, Haacke EM. Principles, techniques, and applications of T2*-based MR imaging and its special applications. Radiographics 2009;29[5]:1433-49). Note the strong but punctate and sharply delineated intralesional signal loss. This type of intralesional T2*w signal loss differs from that of more recent multiple sclerosis lesions where central T2*w hypointensities appear larger and are more diffuse. They are also distinct from (enlarged) venules present in multiple sclerosis lesions as “iron dot” lesions do not show a tubular appearance following the course of a vessel.

The cochlea consists of three fluid-filled compartments: the scala vestibuli and scala tympani, filled with Na+-rich perilymph, and the scala media, filled with K+-rich endolymph. The scala media houses the organ of Corti, which comprises the inner hair cells (responsible for auditory transduction), outer hair cells (critical for cochlear amplification), and surrounding supporting cells. Adjacent to the organ of Corti sits the lateral wall, comprising the stria vascularis (responsible for generating and maintaining the endocochlear potential, the driving force for sensory transduction) and spiral ligament (supporting the stria vascularis and cochlear fluid homeostasis). Spiral ganglion neurons innervate the sensory hair cells and transmit auditory signals to the auditory nuclei in the brainstem. Cisplatin enters the endolymph in the scala media through capillaries in the stria vascularis and is subsequently absorbed by the sensory hair cells in the organ of Corti (red dashed arrows).

The ear consists of three parts: the outer, middle, and inner ear. The outer and middle ear are separated by the tympanic membrane. Sound waves are transduced through the tympanic membrane to the chain of three tiny bones (the ossicles) in the middle ear cavity, which is attached to the oval window membrane, leading to fluid vibrations in the inner ear. The inner ear is responsible for hearing (cochlea) and balance (vestibule). (B) The cochlea is divided into three fluid-filled membranous tubes coiling around the modiolus: the scala tympani, scala vestibuli, and scala media. The fluid vibrations create a traveling wave along the basilar membrane, in which hair cells generate the electrical signals and pass them to the spiral ganglion cells. (C) High-intensity sound waves travel through the cochlear duct, causing damage to three key functional areas: the organ of Corti, the spiral ganglion neurons, and the stria vascularis. Hair cells, supporting cells, and spiral ganglion neurons go through morphological changes and eventual apoptosis in extreme cases. Loss of tight junctions, malfunction of endothelial cells, and surrounding cell types contribute to the blood-labyrinth barrier disruption.

The hallucinated perception is replaced by a veridical one when the strength of the false sensory evidence reduces, or expectancies and data comparison override it. False sensory data results from hyperexcitability and spontaneous activation of the primary visual cortex caused by chronic loss of visual input. Green shading indicates which aspects of the framework are mapped to in each model, with the green text indicating the specific effects on functions.

Horizontal influences are in green. The grey blur over memory, context, emotion, and intention indicates that these factors interact to create complex expectancies. Linking arrows show the specific relationships between concepts while recognizing that the influence of these varies dynamically. The level of detail for each function reflects the need to incorporate distinctions in existing theories; thus, perception and attention are much more fractionated than memory or context. Expectancies act to bias perception and can be conceptualized as brain states that reflect prior information about what is possible or probable in the forthcoming sensory environment, ie, what is expected to be seen in that context (Parr T, Rees G, Friston KJ. Computational neuropsychology and Bayesian inference. Front Hum Neurosci 2018;12:61.). Predictions of sensory-level data are central to state models; in contrast, trait models emphasize higher-order expectances that develop from an interaction between (1) memories of past similar visual environments (memory expectancies), (2) the current visual context (context expectancies), (3) future intentions and motivations (intentional and motivational expectancies), and (4) emotions (emotional expectancies). Emphasizing the circular interactions between these functions, the visual context is created from inputs arising from current visual (and other sensory) perceptions. In addition to their direct role in modifying predicted data, expectancies also indirectly affect sensory data gathering and processing via attention.

Boxes and connecting arrows in blue depict linguistic processes, whereas boxes and arrows in gray show auditory processes. This model is a simplified modification of the model proposed by Whitworth in 2013 and is designed to also express interaction among processes (Dell et al 1997; Levelt et al 1999; Whitworth et al 2013). Components of this model were ultimately derived from German neurologist and psychiatrist Karl Kleist (1879-1960) (Kleist 1962), a student of German neurologist, psychiatrist, and neuropathologist Carl Wernicke (1848-1905). Kleist's work can be understood within the historical connectionist model of language processing (Wernicke 1874; Lichtheim 1885). To show this direct comparison, lettering in the top-right corner of the boxes corresponds to those used by German physician and pioneering aphasiologist Ludwig Lichtheim (1845-1928) in 1885, as does the color-coding of the boxes and connecting arrows described above (ie, those outlined in blue represent centers and pathways that result in select aphasia syndromes if damaged).

It was part of the Spatial Reorientation Following Space Flight investigation conducted on crewmembers. During space flight, the vestibular organs no longer respond in a familiar way. In particular, when astronauts undergo a linear acceleration (eg, bending their heads forward) while in space, their otoliths are not properly stimulated. This creates a sensory conflict, which must be resolved by the brain to maintain orientation. When they first return to Earth, astronauts are again disoriented because of sensory conflict.

The scene is in the International Microgravity Laboratory (IML-1) science module aboard Space Shuttle Discovery. Hilmers, a mission specialist, and six other crewmembers spent more than 8 days in Earth’s orbit conducting experiments. Hilmer's helmet assembly is outfitted with accelerometers to measure head movements and with visors that fit over each eye independently to provide visual stimuli. The chair system has three movement patterns: (1) \"sinusoidal,\" or traveling predictably back and forth over the same distance at a constant speed; (2) \"pseudorandom,\" or moving back and forth over varying distances; and (3) \"stepped,\" or varying speeds beginning and stopping suddenly.

Astronaut and physician-engineer James P Bagian (b 1952), STS-40 mission specialist, is in a rotating chair while wearing an accelerometer and electrodes to record head motion and horizontal and vertical eye movements during the rotations. Payload Specialist and molecular biologist Millie Hughes-Fulford (1945-2021), lower left, assisted with the test. She also has electronystagmography contacts on her head, so she was also a participant in some of the experiments. (Source: NASA/Johnson Space Center [Houston]. NASA ID: STS040-211-020.

SLS-1 was the first Spacelab mission dedicated solely to life sciences. The main purposes of the SLS-1 mission were (1) to study the mechanisms, magnitudes, and time courses of certain physiological changes that occur during space flight and (2) to investigate the consequences of the body's adaptation to microgravity and readjustment to Earth's gravity. The mission was designed to study the neurovestibular system (ie, involving the interactions of the vestibular system, eyes, and brain) and, particularly, to examine the causes of space motion sickness. The SLS-1 was launched aboard the Space Shuttle Orbiter Columbia\n\n(STS-40) on June 5, 1991. (Source: NASA/Marshall Space Flight Center [Redstone Arsenal, Alabama]. NASA ID: 9135505.

The experiment examined spinal reflexes to determine whether they changed in microgravity. In Earth's environment, the otoliths signal the muscles to prepare for jolts associated with falling. During the flight, the normal reflex between the otoliths and the muscles was partially inhibited early in flight, declined further as the flight progressed, and returned to normal after landing, suggesting that the brain ignored or reinterpreted otolith signals during space flight. Crewmembers reported a lack of awareness of position and location of feet, difficulty in maintaining balance, and a perception that falls were more sudden, faster, and harder than similar drops experienced in preflight. Crewmembers experienced illusions as they performed prescribed movement tests. When crew members viewed various targets and then pointed at them while blindfolded, their perception of target location and position of their own limbs was inaccurate in flight compared with similar tests on the ground. Spacelab-1 was launched aboard the Space Shuttle Orbiter Columbia for the STS-9 mission on November 28, 1983. The Marshall Space Flight Center had management responsibilities for the mission.

The Vestibular Experiments in Space studied the interaction among the otoliths, semicircular canals, vision, and spinal reflexes in humans. The main objective was to determine how the body, which receives redundant information for several sensory sources, interprets this information in microgravity. Another objective was to record and characterize the symptoms of space sickness experienced by crewmembers. The body restraint system was a rotating chair with a harness to hold the test subject in place. The crewmember wore an accelerometer and electrodes to record head motion and horizontal and vertical eye movement as the body rotated. The first Spacelab mission, Spacelab-1, was sponsored jointly and shared equally by NASA and the European Space Agency. Spacelab-1 was launched aboard the Space Shuttle Orbiter Columbia for the STS-9 mission on November 28, 1983. The Marshall Space Flight Center had management responsibilities for the mission.

The objectives of the M131 experiment were: (1) assess specific behavioral or physiological responses influenced by vestibular activity under 1-g and zero-g conditions; (2) determine man's adaptability to unusual vestibular conditions and predict habitability of future spacecraft conditions involving reduced gravity and Coriollis forces; and (3) measure the accuracy and variability in man's judgment of spatial coordinates based on atypical gravity receptor cues and inadequate visual cues. Dr. Garriott is seated in the experiment's \"litter chair,\" which can rotate the test subject at predetermined rotational velocity or a programmed acceleration/deceleration profile.

Garn's role was as a congressional observer and as a subject for medical experiments on space motion sickness. Despite having flown more than 10,000 hours as a Navy combat pilot, the space sickness Garn experienced was so severe that a scale for space sickness was jokingly based on him, where \"1 Garn\" is the highest possible level of sickness.

They are onboard the NASA KC-135, which uses a special parabolic pattern to create brief periods of microgravity, affording astronauts and astronaut candidates a preview of spaceflight. The photo should be viewed with feet at the top. The three astronauts in the foreground are (left to right): Richard O Covey, Steven R Nagal, and George D Nelson. In the center background is Robert L Stewart. Obscured in the background are Norman E Thagard and Ellison S Onizuka. (Source: NASA.

The reduced-gravity aircraft flies an up-and-down parabolic pattern. This provides about 30 seconds of hypergravity (1.8 to 2.0 g) as the plane climbs to the top of the parabola. Once the aircraft starts to tip over the top of the parabola to descend toward Earth, the aircraft experiences about 25 seconds of microgravity (zero-g). A typical flight conducted 30 to 40 parabolic maneuvers over the Gulf of Mexico. KIAS = knots indicated air speed. (Source: NASA Reduced Gravity Research Program.

Other central deficits in blue denote deficits that may be combined in specific genetic forms of congenital deafness. Except for genes playing intrinsic roles in both the central and peripheral auditory systems, all central auditory deficits shown here are indirect consequences of peripheral hearing impairment. The time scale is based on the development of the human auditory system. (Source: Michalski N, Petit C. Central auditory deficits associated with genetic forms of peripheral deafness.
