        "text": "One of the most evocative photos of the space age shows a white-suited astronaut standing on the grey and dead surface of the moon. The visor of his helmet reflects barren surroundings and maintains his anonymity. Just visible in the reflection is the photographer, Neil Armstrong. While many people could name Armstrong as an astronaut, far fewer remember Buzz Aldrin, the subject of Armstrong's epochal image - and the second man to walk on the moon. The selectivity of fame, as it immortalises the \"first\" but becomes hazy on the \"second\", proves as fickle with the first ever spacemen.\n\nThe Soviet Union's first cosmonaut, Yuri Gagarin, rocketed into the collective consciousness of the world when his Vostok 1 opened the era of manned space flight in April 1961 with an orbit of the earth. But the name of his successor, Gherman Titov, who has died aged 65, is only familiar to the history books and aficionados of space flight.\n\nTitov piloted Vostok 2, but had also been the back-up cosmonaut to Gagarin. This meant that he had to train with, and mirror, Gagarin's preparations right up until their walk to the launch site of Vostok 1, at the Baikonur cosmodrome in Kazakhstan, 1,300 miles from Moscow. But Gagarin remained fit, and Titov had to wait until August 6 1961 for his turn.\n\nThe timing of Vostok 2 was decided by Nikita Khrushchev. So great had been the global reception accorded to Gagarin that the then Soviet leader realised that, in the space programme, he had a formidable propaganda weapon. Titov's mission was therefore timed to occur just a few days before construction of the Berlin Wall was started.\n\nTitov's space flight lasted just over one day, in which he completed 16 orbits of the earth. He took photographs of the seas and land, blurred by the speed of his spacecraft, and, unlike Gagarin, experimented in steering the Vostok. A naturally quiet man, he was none the less elated with the experience and shouted over the radio, \"I am Eagle\" - Vostok 1's call sign - as he hurtled around the planet.\n\nLess enjoyable was the first manifestation of space sickness, the nausea felt by many astronauts and cosmonauts as their inner ears struggle to deal with weightless conditions. Titov was simply trying to get to sleep, and it was when he closed his eyes that the waves of sickness came over. He persisted, and by keeping as still as he could, eventually managed a healthy eight hours, 30 minutes more than that originally allocated.\n\nThis quiet determination was characteristic of the man, and still evident in his polite reluctance to talk openly when I met him briefly in Stockholm in 1998.\n\nTitov was born in the village of Verkhneye Zhilino, in the Altay republic of western Siberia. His father, a language teacher, instilled in his son a love of poetry that stayed with him for the rest of his life. Many were the times he would reel off verses from memory for his fellow cosmonauts. His sophistication did not hold him back from adventure, and, in 1953, he enrolled as a aviation cadet. By 1957, he had graduated from the Volgograd Air Force Pilots Training School and, in 1960, he was selected as one of the \"six\", the Soviet Union's first group of cosmonauts.\n\nThat Titov made it this far was all the more remarkable because of an old injury that he had nursed through hundreds of gruelling hours spent training. As a child, he has fallen from his bicycle and broken his wrist. So severe was the fracture, and in order to hide it from the officials, that he put in an extra hour of training before his scheduled gymnasium sessions to warm up his painful bones and ligaments. This steely reserve was there for all to see when, during training for Vostok, he set a record of 15 hours in the isolation tank.\n\nTitov never flew a second space mission, although he was selected as lead cosmonaut for the ambitious Spiral spaceplane project in the late 1960s. He furthered his qualifications and, in 1968, graduated from the Zhukovsky Air Force Engineering Academy. Spiral was a small, two-manned interceptor boosted into the upper atmosphere by a larger hypersonic aircraft. Drop tests were carried out with unmanned BOR vehicles, but the programme was cancelled in 1968. Titov also worked on the early Salyut space stations, which were essentially manned military reconnaissance platforms.\n\nHis great disappointment was in not being able to see the prediction he made in 1965 come true: \"I myself dream of flying around the moon. Today's cosmonauts have a good chance of getting a close look at the moon.\" Alas, as the former Soviet Union crumbled, so too did Titov's dream.\n\nIn later years, he continued to promote space flight. Then, in 1995, his career moved with the times and he entered politics. He had served as a deputy of the Supreme Soviet between 1962 and 1970, but was now elected to the lower house of the Russian parliament. Titov was married with two children."
