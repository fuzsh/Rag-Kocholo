        "text": "Every once in awhile I stumble into an amazing genealogical find. This one pertains to my 2nd great grandfather from Germany, Peter Heinrich Ratz (1867-1934). I wrote about him a couple of years ago here: “Nothing but the choicest meats” - Henry Peter Ratz (1867-1935).\n\nPeter came to the United States with his family around 1880. I believe they first came to Wisconsin, then the Upper Peninsula of Michigan, and finally settled in Flint, Michigan.\n\nIn the process of cleaning out some old boxes and files, my father came across a treasure trove of VERY old photos and documents that he didn’t even know that he had.\n\nIn the collection was this 136 year old original handwritten (in German) document from 1883.\n\nI do not know German but I could make out a few of the names that fit with known information about our family’s history.\n\nI recognized the “Peter Heinrich Ratz” in the middle of the page. I have seen his name both as Peter Henry and Henry Peter. The year above his name, 1867, matched what I knew to be his birth year.\n\nI also could make out “Johan Ratz” and “Rosine Gramling” who I knew to be Peter’s parents (and my 3rd great grandparents).\n\nThe “Johan Gramling” name was a bit puzzling because I do not have any other information on the Gramling branch in my tree.\n\nI wondered if this was a marriage certificate for Peter and his wife (my 2nd great grandmother), Fannie Schmidt Ratz (1870-1944), but I did not see her name anywhere on the document.\n\nLastly, the dates were a little confounding to me. If this was an original birth record for Peter (1867) then it would not include the dates of 1876 and 1883 which are clearly visible on the document.\n\nI turned to the power of Facebook and the group that I have used several times before: Genealogy Translations.\n\nOne of the very kind and talented moderators there provided the following translation:\n\nEmpire of Germany, Kingdom of Württemberg, superior bailiwick of Künzelsau, deanery of Amrichshausen, parish of Westernhausen,\n\nBaptism and Birth Certificate\n\nIn the year 1867 on 27 th June was born here, legitimate, and on the following 29th June baptised according to the rites of the roman catholic church by the priest, Hassler,\n\nPeter Heinrich Ratz,\n\nFather: Johann Ratz, citizen and farmer here, catholic\n\nMother : Rosine nee Gramling, catholic, died 22nd October 1876\n\nGodfather : Johann Gramling from Aschhausen\n\nThis is a true extract from the local baptism register\n\nWesternhausen 5th October 1883\n\nCatholic parish office\n\nErnst.\n\nThis was indeed an official copy of the Peter’s original baptism and birth certificate entry in the church register!\n\nI am thrilled to have this document and happy to share its story with you.\n\nHere are a couple of photographs of Peter."
