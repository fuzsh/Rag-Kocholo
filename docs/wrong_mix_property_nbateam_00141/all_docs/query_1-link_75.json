        "text": "The Celtics selected Gerald Green, a McDonald’s High School All-American out of Houston, with the No. 18 overall pick of the 2005 NBA Draft. While he had shining moments in his first two seasons, Boston dealt Green to the Minnesota Timberwolves as part of the package used to acquire Kevin Garnett. Less than two years later, Green fell out of the NBA and took his talents to Russia. He kept working on his game and earned a chance to come back to the league in 2011, making a full-circle return to Boston for the 2016-17 season. “When I came out of high school, I was a little kid. I didn’t understand the business,” Green said. “Once I went overseas and had this real motivation to get back, I was willing to do whatever it took to stick in this league, and that’s what I did.”"
