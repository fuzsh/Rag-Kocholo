        "text": "According to Adrian Wojnarowski, the Rockets have signed NBA veteran Gerald Green to a non-guaranteed contract.\n\nThe Rockets have had an open spot on the roster since they released Isaiah Canaan back in October and it looks like they are using the spot to give the Rockets veteran help off the bench in the absence of Luc Mbah a Moute, who has been out for the past two weeks with an injury.\n\nGreen played 47 games with the Celtics last season averaging 5.6 points per game and 1.8 rebounds per game.\n\nHe was in training camp this year with the Milwaukee Bucks, but failed to make the squad after appearing in four preseason games.\n\nThe 31-year old forward has also played for the Minnesota Timberwolves, Dallas Mavericks, New Jersey Nets, Indiana Pacers, Phoenix Suns, and Miami Heat.\n\nThis is Greenâ€™s second stint with the Rockets after having played one game with the team in 2008, logging just four minutes. Hopefully the tenure is longer this time around for the Houston native, who helped the community by rescuing citizens in the wake of Hurricane Harvey.\n\nWelcome home, Gerald!"
