        "text": "Calvin Gerald Green, PhD\n\nOf Bowie, MD, passed away on May 27, 2021 at Anne Arundel Medical Center. He was 86 years old.\n\nHe was born on October 26, 1934 in East St. Louis, IL to Calvin F. and Anna A. Green (nee Stepanek).\n\nHe married Ms. Mary Gene Frawley on June 14, 1958. They were married over 62 years.\n\nHe worked for the Litchfield and Madison (LM) Railway Co. in IL between his high school graduation and admission to college. He graduated from Washington University in St. Louis (BA), the University of Missouri (MA), and the University of Maryland at College Park (PhD in Industrial/Organizational Psychology). From 1963 to 1967, he worked for the Department of the Army as a Senior Project Director in Personnel Research. He worked at Westinghouse Electric Corporation as a Program Manager in Human Resources, Leadership Development, Education & Training, and Management Development, and as a Director of Counseling Services, retiring in 1996 after a 29 years with the company. He taught courses on Management and Psychology at UMD, and reviewed portfolios of students seeking college credit for life experience at UMUC (now UMGC).\n\nAn avid St. Louis Cardinals’ fan, he also loved to play the guitar, sing and write songs, dance with The Blackthorn Stick Irish Dancers, play cards, solve crossword puzzles, and was the ultimate planner, especially when there was a party to be had or for vacations). He also volunteered with the PTA, Boy Scouts, Villa Rosa Nursing Home, and Pathfinder Village in NY.\n\nHe leaves behind his beloved and devoted wife, Mary/Mary Gene; his three sons Michael (Robin Moore), Pat (Kim), and Kevin (Jane Kansook), and his two daughters, Nancy (KJ) Green, and Theresa (Eric) Derro; grandchildren Michelle, Mitch, Dan, Joe, Rachael, Jonnie, Austin and Ava; great-grandchildren Addison, Matthew and Audrey. He was preceded in death by his daughter Kathleen (Katie), his parents, his siblings and their spouses Donald Green, Alvera (and Maurice “Pidge”) Midgley, Doris (and Marion “Bud”) Hanson, Norvell (and Betty, and Dolores) Green, and many relatives and friends.\n\nHe was generous with his love, friendship, time and creativity. He will be missed.\n\nServices will be held on Friday, June 4, 2021, visitation at 10 a.m. with the funeral service at 11 a.m., both at Holy Family Catholic Church, 12010 Woodmore Road, Mitchellville, MD 20721."
