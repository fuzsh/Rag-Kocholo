        "text": "A person with knowledge of the situation says forward Trevor Ariza has agreed to a one-year, $15 million contract with the Phoenix Suns.\n\nThe person asked to remain anonymous because the agreement cannot be officially announced during the free agent moratorium.\n\nThe 33-year-old Ariza, entering his 15th NBA season, brings a reputation for winning and veteran leadership that General Manager Ryan McDonough said the team needed around its young core that features Devin Booker, Josh Jackson and No. 1 overall draft pick Deandre Ayton.\n\nAriza averaged 11.7 points last season for a Houston team that compiled the best record in the NBA at 65-17 before losing to Golden State in a seven-game Western Conference finals.\n\nKings sign draft pick\n\nThe Sacramento Kings signed first-round pick Marvin Bagley III to a contract.\n\nGeneral Manager Vlade Divac announced the deal with the No. 2 overall pick in last month’s draft.\n\nBagley averaged 21 points and 11.1 rebounds and shot 61.4 percent in his one college season at Duke.\n\nHe was one of four freshmen in the nation to average a point-rebound double-double and joined Clemson’s Horace Grant (1986-87) and Wake Forest’s Tim Duncan (1996-97) as the only players in ACC history to lead the conference in scoring, rebounding and field goal percentage.\n\nHeat sign Jones. Jr.\n\nDerrick Jones Jr. signed a minimum deal with the Miami Heat, after playing with them on a two-way contract last season.\n\nThe 6-foot-7 wing played in 14 games with Miami last season, starting eight. His NBA career is best known for his appearance as a member of the Suns in the 2017 dunk contest at All-Star weekend, an invite that came even though he had spent the bulk of his time that season in the G League.\n\nHe could help the Heat in at least two ways — one being depth, the other being affordability. Miami does not have much in the way of financial flexibility this summer, with the luxury tax threshold looming and the Heat trying to keep Wayne Ellington.\n\nVanVleet to stay\n\nThe Toronto Raptors aren’t letting guard Fred VanVleet get away.\n\nA person with knowledge of the contract said the club has reached an agreement with VanVleet on a two-year, $18 million deal. The person spoke on condition of anonymity because the deal can’t be finalized until Friday.\n\nIn his second season with Toronto, VanVleet, a restricted free agent, averaged 8.6 points and was a valuable backup to Kyle Lowry.\n\nBaynes stays in Boston\n\nAron Baynes, who started virtually every game last season with Boston, is staying with the Celtics.\n\nA person familiar with the negotiations says Baynes has agreed to a two-year deal worth $11 million. The person spoke on condition of anonymity because the deal has not been finalized.\n\nThe second year is at Baynes’ option, meaning he could be a free agent again next summer.\n\nGreen’s Rockets deal\n\nGerald Green and his hometown Houston Rockets are staying together. The Houston native agreed to a one-year deal at the $2.4 million minimum, a person familiar with the terms said on condition of anonymity.\n\nDerrick Rose agrees\n\nDerrick Rose and the Minnesota Timberwolves will be counting on one another next season. The 2011 NBA MVP agreed to a one-year deal worth nearly $2.4 million to stay with Minnesota, a person with knowledge of the negotiations said.\n\nThe person spoke on condition of anonymity because nothing can be signed until Friday."
