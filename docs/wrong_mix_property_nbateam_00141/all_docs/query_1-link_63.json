        "text": "Marilyn Ann “Annie” Olsen, a beacon of light and love in the Alpena community, passed away peacefully on July 14, 2024, at Touch of Country under Compassus care. Born on Oct. 3, 1936 to George and Emma (Kirchoff) Olsen, Annie was the youngest sibling in a large and lively family that included Lucille (Ray) Stafford, Betty (Ivan) Jore, Norma (Bill) Smith, Art (Pauline) Olsen, Harvey (Grace) Olsen, Clarence (Irene) Olsen, Gerald “Sam” (Bev) Olsen, Myron (Esther) Olsen, Wayne (Mary) Olsen, Bob (Janet) Olsen, and Alfred Olsen, all of whom preceded her in death.\n\nAnnie was a proud graduate of the local high school, and shortly after receiving her diploma, she embarked on a remarkable career with the Besser company that spanned an impressive 46 years. Her dedication to her work was matched only by her commitment to her faith and community, exemplified by the countless hours she devoted to volunteering at St. Paul Lutheran Church.\n\nAnnie’s zest for life was contagious, and her interests were as diverse as they were numerous. She was an avid bowler, a skillful fisher, and a patient hunter. Her love for baking and cooking was renowned, and many will remember her for the joy she brought through her delicious creations. Annie’s green thumb was evident in her beautiful garden, a place of tranquility and beauty that reflected her nurturing spirit.\n\nHer adventurous soul led her to travel and exploring, yet she always found time for shopping, a passion she pursued with enthusiasm. Annie’s holiday decorations were a sight to behold, spreading cheer and capturing the essence of each season’s spirit. Her love for life was visible in every aspect of her existence, and she lived her years to the fullest.\n\nThose who knew Annie can attest that she was a truly loving individual, with a heart as big as her smile. Her faith-filled life was an inspiration to all, and she approached every challenge with a passionate resolve. Annie’s presence was a gift to those who had the privilege of knowing her, and her absence will be deeply felt by many.\n\nAnnie leaves behind a legacy of love and joy, along with a host of nieces and nephews who will carry her memory forward. Her life was a testament to the power of positivity and the impact one individual can have on the lives of others. She will be remembered not only for her actions but also for the warmth and kindness that defined her. Visiting hours will be held on Thursday, July 25, 2024, from 4 to 7 p.m.\n\nVisiting hours will resume on Friday, July 26, 2024, at St. Paul Lutheran Church from 10 a.m. until the time of the service at 11 a.m. with the Rev. John Shipman officiating. A private graveside service will be held at Evergreen Cemetery at a later date."
