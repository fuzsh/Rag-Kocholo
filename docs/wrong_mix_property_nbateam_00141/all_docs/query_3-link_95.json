Updated by the P.O.W.\n\nNETWORK 2020.\n\nREMARKS: CRASH O/W - SAR FAILED - J\n\nSYNOPSIS: The Vought F8 \"Crusader\" saw action early in U.S. involvement in\n\nSoutheast Asia. Its fighter models participated both in the first Gulf of\n\nTonkin reprisal in August 1964 and in the myriad attacks against North\n\nVietnam during Operation Rolling Thunder. The Crusader was used exclusively\n\nby the Navy and Marine air wings (although there is one U.S. Air Force pilot\n\nreported shot down on an F8) and represented half or more of the carrier\n\nfighters in the Gulf of Tonkin during the first four years of the war. The\n\naircraft was credited with nearly 53% of MiG kills in Vietnam.\n\nThe most frequently used fighter versions of the Crusader in Vietnam were\n\nthe C, D, and E models although the H and J were also used. The Charlie\n\ncarried only Sidewinders on fuselage racks, and were assigned such missions\n\nas CAP (Combat Air Patrol), flying at higher altitudes. The Echo model had a\n\nheavier reinforced wing able to carry extra Sidewinders or bombs, and were\n\nused to attack ground targets, giving it increased vulnerability. The Echo\n\nversion launched with less fuel, to accommodate the larger bomb store, and\n\nfrequently arrived back at ship low on fuel. The RF models were equipped for\n\nphoto reconnaissance.\n\nThe combat attrition rate of the Crusader was comparable to similar\n\nfighters. Between 1964 to 1972, eighty-three Crusaders were either lost or\n\ndestroyed by enemy fire. Another 109 required major rebuilding. 145 Crusader\n\npilots were recovered; 57 were not. Twenty of these pilots were captured and\n\nreleased. The other 43 remained missing at the end of the war.\n\nLt.JG Gerald Green was the pilot of an F8E assigned a mission over North\n\nVietnam on September 12, 1965. At a point in Thanh Hoa Province, about 15\n\nmiles west of the city of Phat Diem, Green's aircraft was shot down. The\n\naircraft crashed. Rescue efforts failed to recover Green, and little hope\n\nwas held out for his survival. Green was declared Killed/Body Not Recovered.\n\n(NOTE: Grid coordinates (BL30050) do not correlate with coordinates given\n\nabove (200459N 1054959E). Coordinates place the loss in Thanh Hoa province\n\nsome 10 miles inland, while other records indicate that Green ditched over\n\nwater. The BL grids support an over/water loss, but not off the coast of\n\nNorth Vietnam. BL grids are located off the coast of South Vietnam in the\n\nSouth China Sea. It is impossible for the aircraft to have gotten from one\n\npoint to another, and it is assumed that the BL grids are incorrect.\n\nTherefore, since Defense Department records indicate an over/water loss, it\n\nis assumed that the aircraft was hit and turned out to sea to facilitate an\n\neasier rescue, and probably went down near the coast of North Vietnam in the\n\nThanh Hoa region.)\n\nSince the war ended, nearly 10,000 reports relating to Americans missing,\n\nprisoner or unaccounted for in Southeast Asia have been received by the U.S.\n\nGovernment. Many authorities who have examined this largely classified\n\ninformation are convinced that hundreds of Americans are still held captive\n\ntoday. Fighter pilots in Vietnam were called upon to fly in many dangerous\n\ncircumstances, and were prepared to be wounded, killed, or captured. It\n\nprobably never occurred to them that they could be abandoned by the country\n\nthey proudly served.\n\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\n01/2020"
