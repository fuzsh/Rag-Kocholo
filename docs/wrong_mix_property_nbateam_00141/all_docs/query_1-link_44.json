        "text": "Shirley Bess (Duffield) Robins, 88, of Libby, Montana passed away at Libby Care Center of Cascadia on July 9, 2024, peacefully in her sleep.\n\nShe was born on April 2, 1936, in Chinook, Montana to Ensign and Mary Alice Duffield. Shirley was baptized as one of Jehovah’s Witnesses at the young age of 6 on Sept. 4, 1942.\n\nShe married Gerald Robins on Feb. 10, 1955. They raised four children together in Libby: Michael, Lori, Linda and Todd. In addition, they fostered Jason Decker. Their home was always open to anyone who needed a safe place for any amount of time.\n\nShirley was a hard worker and a jokester. If you stopped by their homestead, you might find her creating a new flower garden, beginning a building project, mowing in her cowboy boots or tugging hoses around to make their lawn bigger. Many were the victims of Shirley’s packed snowballs, including those who were sick in bed. Her laughter and beaming smile would put anyone in a good mood.\n\nShirley loved teaching others the truths of the Bible about the future. She began pioneering, or serving as a full-time minister, on Oct. 1, 1974, and she continued until she passed away in death.\n\nShirley took comfort in Revelation 21:4, which says “And he will wipe out every tear from their eyes, and death will be no more, neither will mourning nor outcry nor pain be anymore. The former things have passed away.”\n\nShirley was preceded in death by parents Ensign and Mary Alice Duffield; her siblings Juanita Weatherly, Gary Duffield, Karen Wormouth, and Sharon Green.\n\nShe is survived by her husband of 69 years, Gerald Robins (Libby, Montana); sisters Bonnie Connors (Phoenix, Arizona) and Arlene Gosselin (Moscow, Idaho); son Michael Robins and his wife Rosie (Burlington, Washington); daughter Lori Sessums and her husband Rick (Libby, Montana); daughter Linda Johnson and her husband Greg (Wenatchee, Washington); son Todd Robins and his wife Tammy (Libby, Montana); and foster son Jason Decker and his wife Sarah (Columbia Falls, Montana).\n\nShirley also is survived by six grandchildren: Travis Johnson and wife Gaby (Wenatchee, Washington), Jordan Johnson (Wenatchee, Washington), Jessica Thoeny and husband Devon (Libby, Montana), Hannah Johnson (Wenatchee, Washington), Erica Robins (Libby, Montana) and Jericho Decker (Columbia Falls, Montana), as well as many nieces and nephews.\n\nMemorial services will be held at 2 p.m. Sunday, Aug. 11, 2024, at The Kingdom Hall of Jehovah’s Witnesses. A reception will follow at The Ponderosa Room. If you would like to attend via Zoom, the Meeting ID is 7256470990 and the password is 368004."
