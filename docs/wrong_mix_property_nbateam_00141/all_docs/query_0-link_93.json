        "text": "The NBA has concluded its investigation into Monday night's locker room altercation between the Houston Rockets and Los Angeles Clippers.\n\nAccording to ESPN's Adrian Wojnarowski, the league interviewed more than 20 people and found that Trevor Ariza and Gerald Green aggressively tried to enter the Clippers' locker room, and that Chris Paul and James Harden were attempting to calm things down.\n\nAs a result, Ariza and Green have both been suspended for two games. Paul and Harden will not face any fines or suspensions, nor will anyone on the Clippers.\n\n\"They entered the Clipper locker room in order to confront some or one of the Clippers, confront their opponent,\" NBA vice president of basketball operations Kiki VanDeWeghe told ESPN on Wednesday afternoon. \"With circumstances like this -- it was chippy. These were two teams who really went at it. To go into another team's locker room immediately after a game, totally inappropriate and very provocative for the players to do that, and so that's a dangerous situation. It really is.\"\n\nWoj reports that Ariza will lose $51,178 per game for a total of $103,357, while Green's two-game suspension will cost him a total of $19,054.\n\nHours before the suspensions were announced, Ariza spoke with the media and said all of the reports that surfaced regarding what transpired in the locker room were inaccurate. Harden added, \"99% of them are false. We'll leave it at that.\"\n\nThe Rockets will host the Minnesota Timberwolves tonight in the second game of TNT's double-header. Harden, who has missed seven games due to a hamstring injury, is expected to be in the lineup."
