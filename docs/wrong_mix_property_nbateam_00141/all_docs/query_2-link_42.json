While at Golf Shore in his senior year, Green averaged 33 points, 12 rebounds, 7 assists, and 3 blocked shots per game. This made him the top scorer in the 2005 McDonald’s All-American Game.

There he served two years and appeared in 32 games averaging 11.8 minutes, 5.2 points and 1.2 rebounds.\n\n2007 was another successful year for Gerald Green who successfully won the NBA Slam Dunk Contest. That same year, he became a member of the Minnesota Timberwolves after passing 33 points in a game in Atlanta. However, in the second half, he was traded along with other professional basketball players such as Sebastian Telfair, Al Jefferson, Ryan Gomes and Theo Ratliff, for Minnesota Timberwolves’ Kevin Garnett.

The ring got stuck on a nail which automatically tore her finger from the bone. The finger was eventually amputated in accordance with the doctor’s recommendation. Speaking about the incident and its impact on his personality, Green said he then had to deal with issues of insecurity, with co-workers in high school and throughout his career cracking jokes. He also revealed that he never wanted people to know, it made him feel like an outsider. However, the accident did not cause him to give up his basketball career. After being able to bear the pain and shame, Green returned to court with a bandaged hand and, although the amputated finger did not allow him to grab a bullet, he still tries to shoot as he continues to do until ‘until today..\n\nIs Gerald Green married? wife and children\n\nBoth.
