        "text": "Erik Chapman, N.H. Sea Grant/UNH Cooperative Extension fisheries specialist, has been appointed as the acting director for NHSG beginning on July 1, 2016.\n\nChapman, who has been with NHSG since 2010, has a strong research background in marine fisheries, Antarctic food web dynamics, marine birds and the impacts of climate change on marine ecosystems. His appointment will coincide with the departure of current NHSG director Jon Pennock to begin his new role as director of the National Sea Grant College Program in mid-July.\n\n\"I am extremely happy to have Erik join the ranks of the other directors in the network,\" Pennock said. \"Our understanding is that the UNH administration will open an external search for a permanent NHSG Director in the next 6-12 months,\" he added.\n\n\"I'm excited and honored by the opportunity â€“ we are lucky to have had Jon at the helm for so many years and he leaves us in good shape,\" Chapman said. \"But this is critical time for N.H. Sea Grant and I see great opportunities to build on our successes in coastal communities and at UNH.\""
