        "text": "KING LEAR\n\nMultiple locations\n\nTuesday – Sunday, June 24 – August 8, free with RSVP, 7:00\n\nnyclassical.org/king-lear\n\nIn June 2020, with the pandemic lockdown shuttering live performance around the country, theater companies scrambled for ways to present work in virtual platforms. NY Classical, which has presented more than seven hundred free, mostly outdoor shows since 2000, was working on an adaptation of King Lear for that summer, using Nahum Tate’s 1681 “happy ending.” Instead, they staged an online Zoom reading last June. In a twi-ny talk, artistic director Stephen Burdman explained, “King Lear, with alternating endings (both Shakespeare’s and Tate’s), was always our plan for our 2020 summer season. This is the culmination of a three-year project of investigating how Shakespeare’s company toured their shows outside London. In the time of plague, theaters were closed in Elizabethan London, and while we never expected to have a pandemic of our own. . . . We also had great success with both our six-actor Romeo and Juliet as well as the alternating versions of The Importance of Being Earnest, so this project was a combination of these recent experiments. We auditioned and hired the actors and staff prior to New York State on Pause, and we wanted to make sure to keep our commitments to these wonderful people. In addition to a union salary, they are receiving pension and healthcare. This is an opportunity for us to develop the production with these artists and serve our audience community in the safest way possible.”\n\nWith the lockdown over and New York rising from the ashes of a devastating health and economic crisis, NY Classical is ready to stage King Lear the way it originally intended to, in parks across the city. The cast features John Michalski as Lear, Connie Castanzo as Cordelia and the Fool, Jasminn Johnson as Goneril, Aryana Sedarati as Regan, Nick Salamone as Gloucester, Linden Tailor as Edgar, Amar Atkins as Edmund, Michael Stewart Allen as Cornwall, Grant Chapman as Oswald, Cedric Lamar as Kent, and Clay Storseth as Albany, with Ollie Corchado, Evan Moore-Coll, and Saleemah Sharpe. The two-hour production, directed by Burdman, will run Tuesdays to Sundays beginning June 24 through July 11 in Central Park at West 103rd St., followed July 13-18 at MetroTech Commons in Brooklyn, July 20-25 in Carl Schurz Park, and July 27 – August 8 at the Battery. Admission is free, but advance RSVP is strongly suggested, as tickets are limited.\n\nRed Bull Theater at the Lucille Lortel Theater\n\n121 Christopher St. between Bleecker & Hudson Sts.\n\nTuesday – Sunday through January 24, $60-$80\n\n212-352-3101\n\nwww.redbulltheater.com\n\nA whole bunch of characters go to a whole lot of trouble to get laid in Red Bull Theater’s adaptation of Thomas Middleton and William Rowley’s 1622 Jacobean tragedy, The Changeling, but despite all the lust and violence, it ends up being a rather tepid affair. The classic play is set in Alicante, Spain, where the wealthy Vermandero (Sam Tsoutsouvas) has arranged for his daughter, Beatrice-Joanna (Sara Topham), to marry Alonzo de Piracquo (John Skelley). Instead, the strong-willed, fickle young woman has fallen in love with the dapper nobleman Alsemero (Christian Coulson), while Alsemero’s friend, Jasperino (Justin Blanchard), has the hots for Beatrice’s maid, Diaphanta (Kimiye Corwin). One of Vermandero’s servants, the disfigured De Flores (Manoel Felciano), harbors a secret affection for Beatrice. In the local asylum, guard Lollio (Andrew Weems), supposed madman Antonio (Bill Army), and apparent fool Franciscus (Philippe Bowgen) covet Isabella (Michelle Beck), the much younger wife of asylum doctor Alibius (Christopher McCann). As the wedding approaches, dangerous passions lead to subterfuge, mistaken identity, and murder, as blood spills and the body count rises.\n\nPart of Red Bull Theater’s “Season of Scandal,” The Changeling never seems to grab hold of the audience, unspooling more like a series of vignettes than a fully realized play. The company, which has had great success with recent productions of such other seventeenth-century works as Volpone and ’Tis Pity She’s a Whore, has previously staged Middleton’s Women Beware Women and The Revenger’s Tragedy, also with founding artistic director Jesse Berger at the helm, but this time around there is not enough life in the revival. The dark, black set, by Marion Williams, features several platforms at the center, a mysterious closet where Alsemero keeps potions that, among other things, can tell if a woman is a virgin, and doors and mirrors behind which the asylum residents, dressed like strange animals, sometimes hover. The play, which has been turned into a 1974 BBC broadcast starring Helen Mirren, Tony Selby, Brian Cox, and Susan Penhaligon and a 1994 television presentation with Elizabeth McGovern, Bob Hoskins, Hugh Grant, and Sean Pertwee, explores the nature of sin, but ’tis a pity that this revival doesn’t take full advantage of all of the immorality, unable to balance the comic aspects with the tragic, the heartfelt with the absurd. (On January 18, Red Bull Theater will hold its next Revelation Reading, of Middleton’s A Trick to Catch the Old One, directed by Craig Baldwin and with a cast that includes Bill Buell, Grant Chapman, Stephanie DiMaggio, David Greenspan, Christina Pumariega, Mirirai Sithole, David Ryan Smith, and Stephen Spinella.)"
