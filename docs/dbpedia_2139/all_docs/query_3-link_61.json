Coda tells the story of Ruby, the only hearing person in her deaf family. When the family’s fishing business is threatened, Ruby finds herself torn between pursuing her passion at Berklee College of Music and her fear of abandoning her parents. Coda was filmed on location in Gloucester, MA.\n\nOn Sunday night, Coda received three Academy Awards – Best Adapted Screenplay – Sian Heder, Best Supporting Actor – Troy Kotsur and Best Picture of the Year!\n\nYou may recognize Chapman from his role on City on a Hill, Sneaky Pete, Person of Interest and Mystic River – also an Oscar winner for Best Actor – Sean Penn and Best Supporting Actor – Tim Robbins.\n\nKevin Chapman Trivia:\n\nDid you know that Chapman worked in the City Of Boston film office? It was there that he was discovered by film Director Ted Demme and casted as Mickey Pat in Monument Ave."
