        "text": "Originally from LaFayette, GA, Ben Chapman is a Nashville-based artist/songwriter who has garnered early attention for his soulful voice and country-blues guitar playing. He is heavily influenced by the sounds of the 70’s, pairing groove-driven music of bands like the Allman Brothers with compelling, pithy lyrics akin to those of Guy Clark and Roger Miller, cooking up a tasty serving of country jam band ear candy. Playing bars across North Georgia since he was 17, Ben has always considered himself to be an old soul in a new age of country music. Since moving to Nashville, he has attracted a crowd of supporters from seasoned songwriters/artists to industry executives to promising up-and-comers alike, now finding himself at the center of the wheel that seems to be defining the next wave of “cool kid” coming out of Music City. Writing with highly revered songwriters and artists like Brent Cobb, Hillary Lindsey, Hailey Whitters, Jaren Johnston (The Cadillac Three), Lainey Wilson, and Marcus King, Chapman recently signed his first publishing deal with hit songwriter Hillary Lindsey (Dierks Bentley, Little Big Town, Miranda Lambert) under her new publishing company Hang Your Hat Music, a co-venture between Lindsey and Concord Music.\n\nProduced by Jake Gear (Hailey Whitters, Flatland Calvary) expect Ben’s first release “Hippie Speedball” in August 2021."
