        "text": "Ask Ben Chapman what his favorite thing to do is and without missing a beat he’ll say — playing sports, anything from soccer, basketball, and baseball, to volleyball and golf. His passion for sports led him to earn a BS in health and physical education from Cairn University in 2017 and now he’s thrilled to be back at ACS as the 4th-12th grade boys’ PE teacher and head coach of the Varsity Boys’ Soccer and Baseball teams.\n\nChapman, a 2013 ACS alumnus, came to ACS in the 5th grade and once he entered middle school he played all three sports up through high school. He didn’t just play, but he distinguished himself as a valuable team member and leader. He was the recipient of the ACS Billy Robinson Award in his junior year and received the ACS Cougar Award as a senior. At Cairn University, Chapman played baseball for 3 years, golf for 2 years, and volleyball for 1 year.\n\n“I’m excited to share what I learned playing at the college level with my students in PE class,” Chapman said. “I want to teach them the fundamental skills that they need to play a variety of sports and also help them understand the importance of teamwork and good sportsmanship.” In addition to leading PE classes and coaching, Chapman is teaching a high school elective class on health and medicine that gives students an introduction to careers in health care.\n\nChapman resides in Egg Harbor Township and worships at Coastal Christian, where he plays on the church’s softball team that this summer won the championship among a local, 12-team church league. His has three siblings, Billy, a 2010 ACS alumnus, Elijah, a 2019 ACS alumnus, and Olivia, who is a junior at ACS."
