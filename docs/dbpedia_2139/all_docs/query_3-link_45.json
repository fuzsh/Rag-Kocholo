        "text": "All the Young Dudes is a fan fiction prequel series of J. K. Rowling's Harry Potter novels, written by Archive of Our Own (AO3) user MsKingBean89. It was written from March 2017 to November 2018, is over 500,000 words long and contains 188 chapters.[1]\n\nThe story begins in the early 1970s and follows Remus Lupin's childhood, his years at Hogwarts, his fight in the First Wizarding War, and the love story between himself and Sirius Black. It ends in summer 1995, around the beginning of the events of Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix.[1]\n\nPlot summary[]\n\nRemus Lupin, a wizard with a werewolf condition, faces a challenging upbringing after being bitten by Fenrir Greyback. He forms close bonds at Hogwarts, particularly with Sirius Black, whom he later discovers he is in love with. Remus and Sirius join the Order of the Phoenix to combat Lord Voldemort, but suspicion arises, leading to misunderstandings and tragedy. Lupin loses his friends, but eventually, after personal struggles and reconciliation, he reunites with Sirius Black, finding solace in their enduring connection. The epilogue reflects on Lupin's past through the perspective of his partner Grant Chapman, as they encounter Lupin's son, Teddy Lupin.[1]\n\nTitles of the series[]\n\nThe series consists of three books:\n\nBook One: Years 1-4\n\nBook Two: Years 5-7\n\nBook Three: 'Til The End\n\nReception[]\n\nMedia response[]\n\nAll the Young Dudes received positive reviews upon its release. The Mary Sue writer Benedetta Geddo noted that the story is \"a beautifully written story of friends and war and happiness and loss\". She also highlighted the its love story between Remus and Sirius, noting that \"the queer subtext has always been there\" in the original Harry Potter novels. Slate, a magazine, suggested that the story's engrossing nature stems from its detailed world-building beyond J.K. Rowling's creation.[1]\n\nScreen Rant writer Meagan Bojarski listed the story on the site \"Most Popular Fanfiction For Each Major Shiplist\", adding that \"because of its length and depth, many fans consider it a proper book unto itself and accept its information as canon in the greater Harry Potter world\". Another Screen Rant writer Liz Hersey wrote that because of Rowling's controversial comments, Harry Potter fan-fiction such as All the Young Dudess becomes \"valuable, as it's an artistic space that fans can inhabit without having to grapple with Rowling's involvement\" adding that the story \"perfectly represents what makes the Harry Potter series so beloved\".[1]\n\nImpact[]\n\nThe story was listed at number one on AO3's \"Top of all Fics\" but was eventually replaced. Despite this, the story is the top Harry Potter fan fiction on the site and has become an influence for other stories. It also gained popularity at the end of 2020 and beginning of 2021. On TikTok, All the Young Dude's hashtag (#ATYD) has over 1.5 billion views. TikTokers often fancast the characters alongside creating memes about the story.[3] Popular fancasts include Andrew Garfield as Remus Lupin, Ben Barnes as Sirius Black and Aaron Taylor-Johnson as James Potter. Barnes and Garfield have acknowledged the fancast, with Garfield calling it flattering and a \"sweet thought\". There have also been memes on social media about MsKingBean89's identity being Taylor Swift.[1][4]\n\nBehind the scenes[]\n\nThe story interweaves music from the 1970s in its chapters, and takes its title from the 1972 song \"All the Young Dudes\", written by the English singer David Bowie and performed by the English rock band Mott the Hoople.[1]\n\n[]\n\nAll the Young Dudes on Archive of Our Own"
