Since Chapman has fewer Black faculty than we do Hispanic or Latinx faculty, the initial focus has been on hiring Black faculty.”\n\nRead MoreÂ Â»\n\nWhen Shaykh Jibreel Speight gave the invocation at Chapman University’s inaugural Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. Community Award Reception on Jan. 17, he noted it was also the birthday of another Black “fighter,” Muhammad Ali.\n\nThe event, which will be held annually the day after the federal holiday, recognizes a faculty member, a staff member and a student organization who are “keeping Martin Luther King Jr.’s dream alive.”\n\nRead MoreÂ Â»\n\nOn Friday, November 4, 2022, the Leatherby Libraries and Office of Diversity, Equity and Inclusion celebrated the launch of the Black Book Nook on the first floor of the library.\n\nThe Black Book Nook Collection fosters education and community engagement with Black history, thought, literature, and culture.
