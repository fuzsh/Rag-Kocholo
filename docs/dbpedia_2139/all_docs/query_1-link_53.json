All praise and glory to His Holy Name as we continue to witness His grace, love mercy and kindness here in ministry to the poor and needy, the fatherless and orphan, and the widows indeed!” It is our prayer that you will believe God with us to continue to make an eternity of difference in the lives of hundreds of precious children in great need.\n\nFor more than 40 years, Lighthouse Christian Camp has provided weeks of summer camp to disadvantaged and needy children. Through the camp, thousands of children, who never otherwise would have the opportunity, have come – free of charge – to experience the beauty of God’s creation in a new and meaningful way. Working through the public school systems as well as going door to door, camp staff and volunteers identify children to invite for summer camp. Many of these are the forgotten, the un-churched, un-helped and un-loved! How wonderfully excited they are when they hear that “they” will get to go for a week of summer camp! It’s in these weeks of camp that these children hear, many for the very first time, of the love of Jesus Christ. Through numerous planned activities and chapels, children are taught that there is a creator of all things, including themselves. That through Adam, all men became sinful and are condemned to death. That through Christ there is forgiveness of sin and the gift of eternal life. For many, this simple gospel message is a new and transforming truth that changes their lives forever.\n\nE-mail, Print or Share Below:\n\nLighthouse Christian Camp\n\nLighthouse Christian Camp has provided weeks of summer camp to under-resourced, disadvantaged, and needy children since 1982. Through the camp, thousands of children (who otherwise would never have had the opportunity) have come - free of charge - to experience the beauty of God’s creation in a new and meaningful way. Since that humble beginning, this \"Miracle Work of God\" has evolved to include year-round ministries to children, widows, and orphans. We are very excited about this new platform, The Faces Of Lighthouse, where you can learn about the thousands of people God has sent to minister alongside us through the years. To learn more about the specific ministries of Lighthouse please visit our website.\n\nRead More...\n\nLighthouse Christian Camp\n\nBusiness Phone: (615) 597-1264\n\nMobile: (615) 597-1264\n\nEmail: mkilgore@lighthousechristiancamp.com\n\nWeb Site: www.LighthouseChristianCamp.com"
