        "text": "Each week we bring you a personal story from one of our members. For our member profile this week we talked to...\n\nName: Ben Chapman\n\nHometown: Rockford, MI\n\nMember Since: December 2011\n\nOccupation: Software Product Management\n\nFavorite Activities: Ice climbing, rock climbing, mountaineering, camping, hiking, cycling, sailing\n\n10 ESSENTIAL QUESTIONS:\n\nWHAT FIRST BROUGHT YOU TO THE MOUNTAINEERS?\n\nI moved to Seattle in 2011 and I knew I wanted to spend time in the mountains and needed to develop the skills to stay safe. I took the Basic Alpine Climbing Course in my first year and then moved onto the Intermediate Alpine Climbing Course to expand my knowledge of climbing. I also was excited about joining a community of like-minded people who loved to spend time outdoors.\n\nWHAT MOTIVATES YOU TO GET OUTSIDE WITH US?\n\nI love the community and the endless opportunities for adventure. Without a community like The Mountaineers, it can be difficult to align schedules and climbing objectives with a smaller pool of climbing partners. Through The Mountaineers, you can find new partners, develop friendships, and pursue adventure.\n\nWHAT'S YOUR FAVORITE MOUNTAINEERS MEMORY?\n\nI was fortunate to have the opportunity to join The Mountaineers Alpine Ambassadors ice climbing trip in Canmore in February 2020. The trip consisted of living with a group of fellow ice climbers for a week and climbing water ice for 6 days with professional guides in the epic Canadian Rockies.\n\nWHO/WHAT INSPIRES YOU?\n\nI am inspired by experiencing the natural beauty of the world and the thrill of the unknown.\n\nWHAT DOES ADVENTURE MEAN TO YOU?\n\nAdventure to me is the unknown. Whether it is a new destination, route, climbing team, or different conditions - adventure requires uncertainty.\n\nLIGHTNING ROUND!\n\nSunrise or sunset? Sunrise\n\nSmile or game face? Smile\n\nWhat's your 11th Essential? InReach Mini\n\nWhatâ€™s your happy place? High camp with a view\n\nPost-adventure meal of choice? Hamburger and a Pilsner\n\nNOMINATE YOURSELF FOR MOUNTAINEER OF THE WEEK\n\nMountaineers come in all shapes and sizes, varying widely in age, outdoor experience, and length of time involved in The Mountaineers. Part of what makes our community so unique is the broad diversity of our membership, and we hope these weekly features highlight who we are and why our community plays an important part in feeling belonging in the outdoors. We are always seeking self-nominations for our Mountaineer of the Week, and we invite you to share your story. Trust us, we want to hear from you!\n\nSHARE YOUR EXPERIENCES"
