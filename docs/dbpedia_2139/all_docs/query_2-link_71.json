        "text": "I have seen, through the eyes of my good friend and colleague Michael, the dreadful tragedy that childhood Neuroblastoma Cancer can cause. I am walking in memory of Michael and Caroline's daughter Lily Gray, to reflect on her brilliance and to make a contribution. By donating YOU will contribute to the research and support for children and families affected so abruptly and unexpectedly by this cancer. 100 children are diagnosed each year. Michael has kindly written about Lily and her story and pictures are below - if nothing else - please take a moment to read and reflect.\n\n\"Lily was a funny, feisty and beautiful little girl, full of spirit and always true to herself. She had a lovely smile and giggle, and always ensured her family gave each other kisses and hugs. They liked to dance in the kitchen together and Lily liked telling everyone what to do, \"Wake up Daddy!\", \"Mummy, don't like you shoes\", \"Ava do it\", but hated a fuss herself! She loved playing with her many friends. In short, she loved doing exactly the things that all young children do.\n\nLily was 1 and half years old when she was suddenly diagnosed with Neuroblastoma. She responded extremely well to her induction chemotherapy, the surgery to remove the tumour, her high dose chemotherapy and the stem cell transplant. It looked like the cancer had gone, but sadly, the disease was just too aggressive and she passed away age 2 1/4 years old in her mummy's arms. Throughout all this time, Lily remained positive and determined to do all the normal things that little girls love to do: drawing, painting, pushing her toy doggy and prams, running, cycling, and copying anything her big sister did. She was truly an amazing and inspiring little girl.\" Michael Gray\n\nSome have done RideForLily, I will WalkForLily - it will be fun and DIFFICULT! I have been told it is as challenging as a marathon but much longer. About 62 miles and it takes 24 hours.\n\nPlease donate whatever you can. Money will go directly to the NCCA. http://www.ncca-uk.org/"
