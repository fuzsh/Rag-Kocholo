        "text": "Labour MP Ben Chapman said today he was \"extremely distressed\" after an investigation was launched into claims that he was given permission by Commons authorities to claim expenses for part of a mortgage he had already repaid.\n\nHowever, the former civil servant told the Daily Telegraph he did not intend to \"repay a penny\" after correspondence showed the Wirral South MP sought – and was given – permission to reclaim the ­interest payments on the full value of his original mortgage despite paying off £295,000 of the loan in 2002.\n\nChapman, 68, benefited by £15,000 over 10 months between December 2002 and October 2003 from an arrangement which the newspaper said was apparently not unique to him.\n\nThe MP said: \"Whatever I've done, I've been entirely open and above board with the authorities of parliament and I'm distressed that this has occurred.\"\n\nWhen asked by the Telegraph whether he intended to repay the money, he reportedly said: \"The answer is no. It's all something that was agreed a long time ago.\"\n\nThe Labour chief whip, Nick Brown, will hold urgent talks with Chapman and fees office officials this morning as he investigates the practice of claiming interest payments on mortgages, which was stopped in 2004.\n\nThe Telegraph, which has obtained the detailed expenses claim files of MPs, said Chapman paid about £1,900 a month in interest on a £380,000 mortgage on his second home in Lambeth, south London.\n\nHe claimed most of his payments on expenses up to the limit in place at the time.\n\nThe newspaper said that the MP, who also shares a house in his Wirral South constituency with his wife, wrote to the fees office and said: \"I sold some small properties and was in the dilemma of either using the receipts to purchase other properties or, which was for me a bit more comfortable, to pay off some of the mortgage.\"\n\nA copy of his mortgage statement shows that between 11 December 2002 and 23 January 2003, he paid off £295,000, cutting his monthly interest bill to £447.\n\nThe interest charge continued to fall as he paid off more of the mortgage in smaller chunks and was down to £398 by 11 April 2003 – the last point covered by the statement, according to the Telegraph.\n\nChapman went on to point out his concern that his mortgage interest claim would be cut as a result: \"If the capital was reduced, I would reduce the amount I spent on mortgage and thus at least those figures contributing to an allowances claims.\"\n\nHe added: \"By paying off capital, I am forgoing interest and investment opportunities elsewhere.\"\n\nThe document said that he and an official \"disagreed that the mortgage should remain for ACA [additional costs allowance] purposes at the original amount\".\n\nIn September 2003, Chapman was asked by another Commons official for proof of his mortgage arrangement following a requirement introduced three months earlier. Chapman telephoned the official to say his mortgage statement would show he had been overclaiming, but that this had been agreed with the fees office.\n\nThe Telegraph published part of an email between officials discussing his arrangement, which appears to show other MPs were allowed to do the same.\n\nThe unnamed official, who confirmed that a colleague had agreed the overpayment arrangement for Chapman, said such permission \"would certainly not be given now, although I have heard similar arrangements being agreed to in the past. Personally, I do not believe that such an arrangement should ever have been suggested.\"\n\nSuch arrangements stopped when it was decided they should not have been allowed in the first place, but no investigation into them was held, the Telegraph claimed.\n\nA Commons spokeswoman told the paper: \"In October 2003, there was a tightening of the rules for claiming allowances. This was reflected in the 2004 Green Book.\"\n\nThat book sets out MPs' pay, allowances, pensions and responsibilities for employees.\n\nThe claims in today's Telegraph will be a further blow to the Speaker, Michael Martin, who presides over the Commons authorities. Martin was already under pressure to resign following his handling of the expenses scandal.\n\nHis position could be further undermined after it emerged that MPs had been allowed by the Commons authorities to claim taxpayers' cash for nonexistent mortgage payments.\n\nTwo Labour MPs, David Chaytor and Elliot Morley, have been suspended from their parliamentary party pending sleaze investigations into how they came to continue claiming for thousands of pounds in mortgage interest after paying off loans.\n\nA panel of senior Scotland Yard officers and prosecutors will meet this week to decide what action to take in response to a surge of complaints that MPs misused parliamentary expenses.\n\nLawyers have said there would appear to be a case for some to be pursued for theft or other offences – even if they were taking advantage of officially sanctioned arrangements.\n\nChapman, who is a member of the intelligence and security committee, became a MP after a byelection in February 1997."
