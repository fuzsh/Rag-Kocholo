        "text": "WORD OF THE DAY: PELOTA In Spanish, “pelota” means “ball,” but this word is also the name of a game played with that ball and rackets shaped like baskets (called “cinta”) attached to the players’ hands. The sport acquired the name “jai alai” (which translates to “merry festival” from the Basque language) when it came to Cuba in 1910. Pelota and jai alai have ancient roots in the Basque culture (an ethnic group and geographic region spread across France and Spain), but the fast-paced sport gained worldwide popularity in the early to mid-20th century. As players race across the walled three-sided court, hurling the pelota with the cinta, the pelota can reach speeds above 150 mph. The pelota is traditionally made of hard rubber, covered in leather, and is just smaller than a baseball, but harder than a golf ball. “We need a new pelota for the tournament next weekend.” Improve your vocabulary, one day at a time! https://lnkd.in/eWHERa_w #ImproveYourVocabulary #WhatImlearningToday #Worddaily #WordOfTheDay #Pelota #realtor® #EllaDrummondRealtor #resendeimoveis #emanuelladrummond #elladrummond #EDRealtor #elladrummondrealtor #edrealtor #EDR\n\nSlang Series Day 11: Learn the meaning of ‘Kisser’ and how to use it in a sentence!Day 11 ofis here and the slang of the day isIt means mouth, like when Pathirana tried to catch the ball and it hit hisStay tuned for more fun slang words with me, Kuldeep!#slangseries #day11 #kisser #mouth #example #pathirana #ball #\n\n2nd friendly for GKS Tychy (1 liga Poland) vs MFK Karvina(First Tier Czech Republic) - Coach put me in 82nd Min.
