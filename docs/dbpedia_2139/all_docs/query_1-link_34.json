        "text": "Ben was called to the Bar by Middle Temple in 2015 as a Major Scholar. His impressive academic background includes a First Class LL.B in Law from the University of Hull, an LL.M with Merit in International Human Rights Law and Practice from the University of York, and multiple Outstanding grades on his BPTC at Nottingham Law School where he was also awarded a scholarship. He won a number of advocacy and negotiation competitions, and received an\n\nacademic prize for his work in the University of Hull Legal Advice Centre.\n\nFollowing his BPTC Ben worked for a Top 50 UK Law Firm as an Assistant Advocate undertaking advocacy, advice and drafting work. He was (and continues to be) a Presenting Officer for the Teaching Regulation Agency prosecuting teachers in cases of professional misconduct, and appeared regularly before the County Court in small claims trials, application hearings, CCMCs, quantum hearings and infant settlement approval hearings.\n\nHe completed his Pupillage under the supervision of previous member of chambers, and now District Judge, James Carter.\n\nHe is committed to work involving human rights elements and champions access to justice. He supports Advocate, the Bar’s Pro Bono charity, and continues to accept such instructions via them. He was a co-founder of the pro bono legal education programme ‘inFrinGeMent’ raising awareness of FGM. He has developed training for NGOs working with human trafficking survivors in South East Asia and has trained a Police Force in awareness around Travellers and Gypsies.\n\nGrowing up Ben had a number of real-world jobs from working on a market stall, to working behind a bar, through to being a Duty Manager in Boots advising on healthcare.\n\nOutside of work, Ben enjoys cooking, hot curries, live comedy and a wide variety of music (including rock, indie, lofi and instrumental). He regularly travels in search of new foods and experiences. He also keeps a tiny puppy named after a very large and hairy Star Wars character.\n\n“The client commented that Counsel was very professional and that his knowledge of his case was great. This case involved many issues and we were very pleased with how Ben has managed the progression of the case. The client has been provided with clear advice and I feel that he has managed the client’s expectations really well.\n\nBen was prompt to provide a detailed note of the Hearing and has kept\n\nus fully informed regarding the drafting of the Order. His aftercare of the client has also been really good as he has contacted him to go through the Order which I think has been really helpful for this particular client.\n\nOverall we are really pleased with Ben’s representation and look forward to his ongoing assistance.”\n\nJoanne Wilbraham, Ellis-Fermor & Negus\n\n“I thought Ben was excellent and handled a very nervous client extremely well.”\n\nLocal Managing Partner & Solicitor\n\n“I recently instructed Ben to represent a wife, who had previously been a litigant in person, at a final financial remedy hearing.

The client was so pleased and commented that Ben was “amazing” and that she felt so relieved to have him representing her. I would not hesitate to recommend Ben.”\n\nFlorence Ashcroft-Lane, Stowe Family Law\n\nLegal 500 2023 – Child Law (Public and Private) Rising Star Ranked: Tier 1\n\n“Well regarded for his ‘extensive knowledge of occupation orders’ and ability with vulnerable clients.”\n\n“Ben has a great manner with clients and always gives a full note of the hearing and quickly updates following hearing.”\n\nLegal 500 2023 – Social Housing Rising Star Ranked: Tier 1\n\n“Ben demonstrated excellent client care and explained complex legal matters to the client clearly and concisely.

He is prompt, clear, accurate and helpful. He has a lovely, calm and reassuring manner with clients. He inspires the utmost confidence that he has read everything and is on top of their case.”\n\nLegal 500 2024\n\nSocial Housing Rising Star Ranked: Tier 1\n\nRogerson v Bolsover District Council [2019] EWCA Civ 226 (Court of Appeal)Led by Head of Civil and Family Team Tom Russell, Ben was junior counsel on behalf of the Claimant in a Defective Premises Act matter. They were successful on both grounds of appeal, and the Court of Appeal used the opportunity to re-confirm the law in this area.\n\nG v G & G (2021)\n\nA successful application for a Wife under s. 37 Matrimonial Causes Act 1973 obtaining a freezing order and setting aside the disposition of a buy-to-let property. The Husband purported to hold the property on trust for his brother following the separation of the parties. There were allegations of fraud and foreign state corruption. The court agreed with Ben that the Husband’s actions were a sham.\n\nTRA v Nicholas Walker (2021)\n\nRegulatory prosecution of a teacher concerning allegation of recent and historic sexual misconduct with pupils/children. The victim witnesses were particularly vulnerable, with one as an adult still affected by the actions and giving evidence on matters occurring some 19 years prior. The teacher was prohibited from teaching indefinitely.\n\nPanel decision and reasons on behalf of the Secretary of State for Education available here.\n\nBBC News article available here.\n\nJ v M (2021)\n\nMulti-day Fact-Finding Hearing in which Ben’s client, a Father, had previously admitted poor behaviour and was facing serious allegations including strangulation, threats to kill and causing bruising to the child. There were difficulties with an interpreter and questions around whether they were accurately interpreting the accuser’s evidence. Despite this, Ben was able to ensure no findings were made against his client.\n\nP & P (2021)\n\nFact-Finding Hearing at which Ben was representing a 16 year old child separately from her siblings. There were allegations against her Father of physical abuse, destruction of property, emotional abuse, controlling behaviour and alienation of one of the siblings from the others. Ben’s client would not be giving evidence meaning he was limited to cross examination alone to prove her evidence. Ben was\n\nable to present his cross examination in a considered way to display to the Court the Father’s nature when his behaviour was challenged, and satisfied the court that his client’s evidence was true.\n\nT v B & A (2020)\n\nComplex TOLATA/Insolvency matter. Ben was representing a Wife living in an adapted home with 3 disabled children. The property was in the Husband’s sole name. He was bankrupted and a possession order was made, both without the Wife’s knowledge. She applied to set the possession order aside. This was one of the early cases heard remotely following the onset of the 2020 Coronavirus pandemic. Ben’s client spoke very little English. The law in this area did not sympathise with her position. Nevertheless Ben was able to secure a declaration of her beneficial interest in the property and delayed an Order for Sale by 18 months by demonstrating the exceptional circumstances. This would allow her time to raise the funds to buy the Husband’s share and keep the property. The Judge commended Ben’s mastery of the case in circumstances where he had been instructed at very short notice on an emergency basis.\n\nA v M & P (2021)\n\nA very emotionally sensitive Final Hearing in which Ben represented a Special Guardian Grandmother responding to an application for contact by the parents who were each litigants-in-person. The matter was further complicated by a conflict in religions. Ben was able to successfully manage the hearing to secure an outcome favourable to his client and avoid her religious beliefs from being undermined.\n\nD v D (2020)\n\nA high-stakes Fact-Finding Hearing at which Ben represented a Father on a Public Access basis. His client was vulnerable as he could not read or write, and faced deportation if serous allegations of physical abuse against him were proven. He himself made allegations that she had physically abused him and was alienating the child from him in furtherance of that abuse. Ben was able to successfully defend his client against all of the allegations made against him, and was able to prove all of the allegations made against the Mother."
