        "text": "Caitlyn Poach\n\nMatron of Honor\n\nCaitlyn Poach, formerly of House Conley, the First of the Conley sisters, Queen of CrossFit and Craft projects, Protector of the Pediatric ED, the Mother of three boys, the General of Baypoint Maine, the Nurse, the Breaker of toddler fights. The one who will NOT understand this Game of Thrones reference.\n\nMark Chapman\n\nBest Man\n\nBrother of the Groom who loves to debate and, in the end, will sell you on the idea of getting a dishwasher (still waiting on the one he promised our parents). He will say that he is a better golfer than I am, but he hasn’t even broken 100 yet.\n\nJenna Colbert\n\nMatron of Honor\n\nJenna Colbert, formerly of House Conley, the Second of the Conley sisters, Queen of Podcasts and Nerd Trivia, Protector of her husband, Daniel Colbert (he needs it), the Mother of two kitties, the Thespian of the family, the Well-Traveled, the Breaker of Video Game Levels. The one who WILL understand this Game of Thrones reference.\n\nChandler Twining\n\nGroomsman\n\nBest friend of the Groom who has been through it all, including all the cheap beer and appetizers that Applebees could offer during Bros Nights. Careful though, enough of the cheap beers and he might break out his favorite boots.\n\nDelanie Dyer\n\nBridesmaid\n\nDelanie Dyer, of House Dyer. Bestfriend of the bride. Queen of the nightshift NICU. Mother of her kitty; Sabrina. Backpacker extraordinaire. Best buddy-read partner and Keeper of ALL the bride’s secrets.\n\nSamuel Clarke\n\nGroomsman\n\nFriend of the Groom, the Captain, who is often found holding an empty bottle while asking “Why is the rum gone?” He has a fondness for Lake Erie but luckily, he has ghosted it ever since he got into a committed relationship.\n\nKatie Conley\n\nBridesmaid\n\nKatie Conley, of House Conley. Cousin to the Bride. Queen of her special ed. classroom. Mother of her puppy; Gretzky. One-fourth of the Babies of America. Boogie Board-Surfing aficionado and Maker of friends wherever she goes.\n\nScott Morace\n\nGroomsman\n\nCousin of the Groom who was nearly a breakthrough movie producer, but the production studios wouldn’t take an 11 year old seriously. Nowadays he has put the video recorder aside and instead plays dress-up a couple times a year, I guess that it’s called “cosplay”?"
