        "text": "HONOLULU Ben Chapman, who played the title role in the 1954 horror film “Creature From the Black Lagoon,” died here on Feb. 21. He was 79.\n\nHis death was confirmed by his son Ben Chapman III, who said he had been suffering heart and breathing problems.\n\nMr. Chapman, a decorated Korean War veteran and real estate executive, played the monster known as the Gill Man when he was a contract player for Universal Pictures. Released in 1954, the movie was the quintessential 3-D black-and-white monster movie of the 1950s.\n\nMr. Chapman, who was 6 feet 5 inches tall, got the Gill Man part because of his size. He said there were actually two actors who played the part. He was the creature on land; Ricou Browning was the actor in the water sequences.\n\nIn publicity photos Mr. Chapman was the one beneath the foam-rubber body suit and the large-lipped headpiece. Julia Adams was the object of his affection.\n\nThe Gill Man is shot and stabbed in the final moments of the film. He sinks into the depths of the water, only to return in a pair of sequels that never replicated the success of the original. Neither featured Mr. Chapman.\n\nMr. Chapman had a Web site (the-reelgillman.com), where his fans could contact him.\n\nBen Chapman was born on Oct. 29, 1928, in Oakland, Calif., but was reared in Tahiti. When he was 12 or 13, his family moved to San Francisco.\n\nHe served in Korea with the Marine Corps, where he suffered battle injuries to his legs, which doctors wanted to amputate. Instead, he nursed himself back to health. He earned a Korean Service Medal with one star and the United Nations Service Medal.\n\nBesides his son Ben, he is survived by his companion of 25 years, Merrilee Kazarian, who often referred to herself as “Mrs. Creature”; another son, Grant Chapman of Las Vegas; a stepdaughter, Elyse Maree Raljevich of Coto De Caza, Calif.; and a sister, Moea Baty of Los Angeles.\n\nA correction was made on\n\nApril 30, 2008\n\n:\n\nAn obituary by The Associated Press on March 1 about Ben Chapman, who played the title role in the 1954 horror film “Creature From the Black Lagoon,” erroneously included some medals among the decorations he received as a marine in the Korean War. According to the National Personnel Records Center in St. Louis, he was authorized to wear the Korean Service Medal with one star and the United Nations Service Medal. The center said it had no record of his receiving the Silver Star, Bronze Star and two Purple Hearts. This correction was delayed for research."
