The two artists then formed a friendship and began collaborating on music together.\n\nIt wasn't until after their respective marriages ended that the musicians' relationship turned romantic.\n\n\"The truth is there was never a magic plan, 'I'm going to go do this and a couple years later you go do this,' \" Gill said during a 2003 interview with Larry King. \"There wasn't ever even a discussion. I got a divorce. And I said, 'Well, I think [Amy will] probably stay.' I really did. That's how I felt.\"\n\nThe pair began dating in 1999 and got married the following year, bringing together their two families — Grant has three children, Matt, Sarah and Millie, with her ex-husband, Gary Chapman, while Gill shares daughter Jenny with his ex-wife, Janis Oliver.\n\nThe couple's blended family grew by one with the birth of Grant and Gill's daughter, Corrina, just two days after their first wedding anniversary.\n\nFrom writing music together to celebrating anniversaries, here is everything to know about Amy Grant and Vince Gill's relationship.\n\n1983: Vince Gill hears Amy Grant's \"Tennessee Christmas\" on the radio\n\nIt was Grant's holiday tune \"Tennessee Christmas\" that first caught Gill's attention.

And then we worked together Christmas of '93 and actually performed together,\" Grant told King in 2003. \"I was just captivated with his personality.
