        "text": "For once I'm in complete agreement with Hollywood Elsewhere's Jeffrey Wells. He has a good one-paragraph synopsis of “42”why it's not particuarly good but why one scene is powerfulamidst his analysis of Marshall Fine's review:\n\n42 is okay if you like your movies to be tidy and primary-colored and unfettered to a fault, but its a very simplistic film in which every narrative or emotional point is served with the chops and stylings that I associate with 1950s Disney films. The actors conspicuously act every line, every emotional moment. Its one slice of cake after another. Sugar, icing, familiar, sanctified. One exception: that scene in which Jackie Robinson is taunted by a Philadelphia Phillies manager with racial epithets. Im not likely to forget this scene ever. Its extremely ugly.\n\nAgreed. Alan Tudyk, who plays Ben Chapman, the taunting Phillies manager, should get some special kind of award for his performance. It's unblinking.\n\nLinks:\n\nMy review of “42”.\n\nAlan Tudyk on playing Ben Chapman.\n\nMy disagreement with Wells about the “42” poster and “Lincoln.”\n\nAlan Tudyk: A good actor acting ugly."
