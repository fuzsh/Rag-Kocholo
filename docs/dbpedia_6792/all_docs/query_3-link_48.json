        "text": "U.S. Film Festival\n\nSundance Institute assumed creative and administrative control of the U.S. Film Festival, expanded it to 10 days, and showcased American independent and international films, including: John Schlesinger ’s The Falcon and the Snowman, Robert Rosenberg and Greta Schiller’s Before Stonewall, William Duke ’s The Killing Floor, John Sayle’s Brother from Another Planet, Roland Joffé ’s The Killing Fields. Award-winning films included the Coen brothers’ debut film Blood Simple and Jim Jarmusch’s Stranger than Paradise.\n\nFun fact: Renowned documentary filmmakers Frederick Wiseman, D.A. Pennebaker, and Barbara Kopple (all 1985 jurors) and Rob Epstein participated on the “What’s Real” panel, which examined cinematic representation of reality.\n\nBehind the Headlines\n\nHighlights from the Festival included spotlights on Orson Welles and Ron Mann, an Australian independent cinema showcase, and panels on marketing documentaries, screenwriting, financing, and distribution. Notable films included Woody Allen’s Hannah and Her Sisters, Bill Sherwood’s Parting Glances, Lee Shapiro’s Nicaragua Was Our Home, and Ray Lawrence’s Bliss. Smooth Talk, directed by Joyce Chopra and starring Laura Dern and Treat Williams, won the Dramatic Grand Jury Prize.\n\nFun fact: The Festival’s programmers briefly considered eliminating the competition format in favor of a “celebration” of American independent film.\n\nA Next Wave\n\nFestival highlights included panels on first-time filmmakers, Canada’s next wave, and actors on acting, as well as premieres of Jim McBride’s The Big Easy, Jean-Jacques Beineix’s Betty Blue, Atom Egoyan’s Next of Kin, David Anspaugh’s Hoosiers, Gary Walkow’s Trouble with Dick, Jill Godmilow’s Waiting for the Moon, Barbara Margolis’s Are We Winning, Mommy?, and David Jones’s 84 Charing Cross Road. Award winners included Ross McElwee’s Sherman’s March and Lizzie Borden’s Working Girls.\n\nFun fact: The first year of the United States Film Festival in Japan intended to expose new films to the Japanese public, foster creative exchange, and create opportunities for independent filmmakers in the Japanese market.\n\nSuperstar Short Films\n\nThe Festival honored Sam Fuller, showcased new Argentine cinema, and screened nearly 100 films, among them Bruce Weber’s Broken Noses, Louis Malle’s Au Revoir Les Enfants, Michael Hoffman’s Promised Land, Norman Jewison’s Moonstruck, John Waters’s Hairspray, Beth and George Gage’s Fire on the Mountain, and Rob Nilsson’s Heat and Sunlight. Award winners included Jennifer Fox’s Beirut: The Last Home Movie, Bill Couturie’s Dear America, and Jerry Rees’s The Brave Little Toaster.\n\nFun fact:Short films were screened as part of the debut of the Discovery Program for emerging filmmakers, Rogues Gallery, and Best of American Animation. Todd Haynes’s Superstar premiered in the Rogues Gallery.\n\nsex, lies, and Heathers\n\nThe Festival opened with a restoration of F.W. Murnau's 1927 film, Sunrise and continued with a tribute to John Cassavetes and screenings of notable works including Christian Blackwood’s Motel, Martin Donovan’s Apartment Zero, Michael Lehmann’s Heathers, Jonathan Wacks’s Powwow Highway, Tomás Gutiérrez Alea’s Letters from the Park, and Nancy Savoca’s True Love. Steven Soderbergh’s sex, lies, and videotape won the inaugural Audience Award and, after winning the Palme d’Or, became the most successful independent film of its time.\n\nFun fact: Nobel Prize–winning writer Gabriel García Marquéz spearheaded the Festival's continuing exploration of Latin American film, overseeing the creation of six feature-length works based on his stories.\n\nA Human Face on the AIDS Crisis\n\nThe Sundance U.S. Film Festival featured tributes to Richard Lester and Melvin Van Peebles and special sections showcasing Colombian and Kazakhstani film. Notable films included Jane Campion’s Sweetie, Michael Moore’s Roger and Me, Whit Stillman’s Metropolitan, and Charles Burnett’s To Sleep with Anger. Award winners included Wendell B. Harris’s Chameleon Street and Norman Rene’s Longtime Companion, a groundbreaking film supported by the Institute labs, widely considered the first film to put a human face on the AIDS crisis.\n\nFun fact: House Party, directed by Reginald Hudlin and based on the short film of the same title, won both the Filmmaker Trophy and the Excellence in Cinematography Award in the dramatic category.\n\nIndependent Vision\n\nSally Potter’s Orlando, Peter Friedman and Tom Joslin’s Silverlake Life: The View from Here, and Alfonso Arau’s Like Water for Chocolate all premiered during the 1993 Festival. Leslie Harris’s Just Another Girl on the I.R.T., Victor Nunez’s Ruby in Paradise, and Michael Mann’s Public Access were among the award winners, and filmmakers Philip Kaufman and Christian Blackwood were honored with retrospectives of their work. Panels covered topics ranging from regional filmmaking to the next generation of filmmakers.\n\nFun fact: Wes Anderson’s 13-minute short Bottle Rocket screened during the 1993 Festival, and his feature-length version of the film was supported by the Institute’s Screenwriters Lab in the same year.\n\nActors Behind the Camera\n\nThe Festival added 1,300 additional seats with the Eccles Theatre; presented panels on digital filmmaking, avant-garde film, and reinventing genre film, and saw the rise of the actor/director, with Timothy Hutton, Sara Gilbert, Vincent Gallo, Greg German, and Saul Rubinek moving behind the camera. Christina Ricci grew up with very adult performances in Don Roos’s The Opposite of Sex and Vincent Gallo’s Buffalo 66.

Nonny de la Peña’s Hunger in Los Angeles was presented in the New Frontier section. The invitation prompted de la Peña’s intern Palmer Luckey to create a mobile version of a VR headset, which became an early manifestation of Oculus Rift, marking the beginning of the multibillion dollar gold rush among the technology, gaming, and film industries to bring viable virtual reality to the masses.\n\nFun fact: Benh Zeitlin’s Beasts of the Southern Wild was supported by the Institute labs, won the Festival Grand Jury Prize and Excellence in Cinematography Award, and went on to be nominated for four Academy Awards, including Best Picture, Directing, Leading Actress, and Writing (Adapted Screenplay).\n\nNew Paths, New Stories\n\nFor the first time in the Festival’s history, both juries and audiences selected the same films in the U.S. Dramatic and U.S. Documentary Competitions for their top awards: Ryan Coogler’s Fruitvale and Steve Hoover’s Blood Brother both took home the Grand Jury Prize and the Audience Award for best dramatic and documentary, respectively.

You either resist it—we know who those people are—or you go with it,” he said. “We want to ride with that wave.” Celebrating 30 years of independent storytelling, the Festival explored an always feared, often denied, but most vital aspect of the creative process—failure—with FREE FAIL, a day of panels, workshops, and special events. New to 2014 was the Kids section, designed for independent film’s youngest fans. Standout films of the Festival included Obvious Child, A Girl Walks Home Alone at Night, Skeleton Twins, God Help the Girl, Rich Hill, 20,000 Days on Earth, and Boyhood, while the unique history of baseball was showcased in both The Battered Bastards of Baseball and No No: A Dockumentary.

The annual A Celebration of Music in Film concert was a tribute to jazz icon Nina Simone, the subject of What Happened, Miss Simone?,and featured Common, Erykah Badu, Aloe Blacc, Kate Davis, Andra Day, and Al Schackman. Popular with both jurors and audiences, Me and Earl and the Dying Girl won both the U.S. Dramatic Grand Jury Prize and the U.S. Dramatic Audience Award, while The Wolfpack won the U.S. Documentary Grand Jury Prize and Meru received the U.S. Documentary Audience Award. The World Cinema Documentary Grand Jury Prize and World Cinema Dramatic Grand Jury Prize went to The Russian Woodpecker and Slow West, respectively.\n\nFun fact: Nearly 20 years before premiering Dope and winning the U.S. Dramatic Special Jury Award for Excellence in Editing at the 2015 Festival, Rick Famuyiwa premiered his first film, the short Blacktop Lingo, at the 1996 Festival. Famuyiwa also attended the 1997 Sundance Institute Directors and Screenwriters Labs with The Wood, which was released in theatres in 1999.\n\nIndependent Minded\n\n“Diversity comes out of independence. If you’re independent minded, you’re going to do things different from the common form, and you’re going to have more diverse products.” —Robert Redford\n\nA major story of the Festival became The Birth of a Nation , the impassioned and incendiary feature chronicling the life and death of Nat Turner, the Virginia slave and preacher who led an improbable collective uprising against white masters. The film was met by standing ovations at all of its screenings, and it was sold for a record-breaking sum to Fox Searchlight. Another story that arose was the formal diversity of the 2016 program. Among the 123 narrative and documentary features, there seemed to be a critical mass of films that didn’t easily fit into traditional competition categories. Films like Kate Plays Christine, All These Sleepless Nights, Sonita, and Nuts! sought to expand the definition of the documentary, while The Fits, from the NEXT section, brought fabulist storytelling to a real-life cast and location. New for 2016 was the Special Events section, an evolving category that included episodic work, short films, and live performances. The Birth of a Nation and Sonita won both the Grand Jury Prize and Audience Award, marking the third time in Festival history that films from two categories each won both awards. Other top awards went to Between Sea and Land, First Girl I Loved, Jim: The James Foley Story, Sand Storm, and Weiner.\n\nFun fact: New Frontier celebrated its 10th anniversary of cutting-edge media, fine art, and the vast potential and possibilities of storytelling with the presentation of nearly 40 VR works.\n\nMr. Pink Meets Patti Cake$\n\nThe 2017 Festival brought environmentalism front and center, with 14 films and virtual reality experiences on the subject—including follow-up films Chasing Coral (Jeff Orlowski's sequel to Chasing Ice) and Al Gore's much-anticipated Day One film An Inconvenient Sequel. And 25 years after its Sundance premiere, Quentin Tarantino's Reservoir Dogs returned for a special anniversary screening as part of the From the Collection category. Other highlights included culture-clash love story The Big Sick, Ferguson uprising documentary Whose Streets?, absurdist crime movie I don't feel at home in this world anymore., Jordan Peele's surprise Midnight screening Get Out, and, one year after the big success of Sonita, two new films about female rappers: Patti Cake$ and Roxanne Roxanne. Off of the screen, an independently organized Women's March featuring such speakers as Dolores Huerta, Chelsea Handler, and Jessica Williams brought an estimated 8,000 people to crowd Main Street on the third day of the Festival (the second day of Donald Trump's presidency), joining millions of others across the country in similar demonstrations.\n\nFun fact: The 2017 Festival saw heavy snowfall, a power outage that caused screenings at three theatres to be rescheduled, and a cyberattack that halted ticket sales—but not even that trifecta of misfortunes could stop the Festival from going on as planned.\n\nSmall Screen Goes Big\n\nRecognizing the increasing demand for serial content, the 2018 Festival introduced the Indie Episodic section specifically for stories told in multiple installments. And to house even more screenings in Park City for the ever-growing Festival, the Institute converted a sporting goods store into a new permanent 500-seat theater, The Ray—the basement of which became a New Frontier exhibition space that included a 40-seat mobile VR cinema.\n\nAlso making its debut in 2018 was the new Festival Favorite Award, determined by audience ballots from all Festival screenings, which went to the Kids documentary Science Fair. The U.S. Dramatic and Documentary Grand Jury Prizes were awarded to The Miseducation of Cameron Post (directed by Desiree Akhavan) and Kailash (directed by Derek Doneen), respectively, while the biggest sale of the year was Sam Levinson’s Midnight hit Assassination Nation for more than $10 million.\n\nFun fact: Eliza McNitt’s Spheres, a three-part VR series that lets viewers explore the center of a black hole, is purchased for seven-figures, a first for a VR project at the Festival.\n\nPowerhouse Women Take Center Stage\n\nAs Kim Yutani took the reins as the new director of programming, the 2019 Festival made huge strides toward the Institute’s commitment to inclusion—with 41% of films directed by people of color, 17% by people who identified as LGBTQ+, and 45% by women.\n\nSome of the buzziest women-helmed films included two of the Festival’s biggest deal earners—Nisha Ganatra’s Late Night and Gurinder Chadha’s Blinded by the Light—along with Chinonye Chukwu’s U.S. Dramatic Grand Jury Prize–winning Clemency and Lulu Wang’s The Farewell.\n\nA slew of documentaries also made big waves, not the least of which were Special Jury Award winner APOLLO 11, featuring never-before-seen archival footage of the moon landing mission, and Festival Favorite Knock Down the House, which chronicled the journeys of four female political newcomers in the 2018 midterm elections, including youngest-ever Congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez.\n\nFun fact: The 2019 Festival saw an unusual bunch of surprise special guests walk the press lines, including an alien lizard, dog, robot, and astronaut.\n\nImagined Futures\n\nAmong the 2020 program’s award-winning films were Lee Isaac Chung’s coming-of-age immigrant story Minari and Jim LeBrecht and Nicole Newnham’s disability-rights documentary Crip Camp, while the U.S. Dramatic Directing Award went to first-time feature director Radha Blank, who also wrote, starred, and rapped in The 40-Year-Old Version. Notable Festival guests included Hillary Clinton and Gloria Steinem, each of whom had a biographical story (documentary and narrative, respectively) premiering in Park City.\n\nTo celebrate the beginning of the decade, the new Imagined Futures series highlighted the possibilities of an equitable future with panels and special screenings, culminating in a communal bonfire gathering. And at the close of the Festival, longtime Documentary Film Program director Tabitha Jackson was announced as the incoming Festival director in light of John Cooper’s retirement—marking the first time in the Institute’s history that the position went to a woman.\n\nFun fact: The New Frontier project Spaced Out brought audiences into the swimming pool at the Park City Sheraton for a floating outer-space simulation.\n\nIndependent Together\n\nThe pandemic led the Institute to reimagine the festival experience and offer the 2021 Sundance Film Festival digitally for the first time via a custom-designed online platform alongside screenings at local cinemas and arts organizations across the U.S. in the form of Satellite Screens. Huge strides in accessibility led to tripled attendance, with audiences from all 50 states and 120 countries, and industry praise for setting a high standard in user experience for screenings. The all-new New Frontier Spaceship experience allowed artists and Festivalgoers to mingle, watch performances, and view VR projects in a virtual space.\n\nComedian and actor Patton Oswalt hosted the online Awards Night Ceremony, where the top prizes were presented to Sian Heder’s CODA, Jonas Poher Rasmussen’s Flee, Ahmir “Questlove” Thompson’s Summer Of Soul (…Or, When the Revolution Could Not Be Televised), and Blerta Basholli’s Hive, among many others.\n\nFun fact: During the “Barbed Wire Kisses Redux” Big Conversation, B. Ruby Rich reassembled the titans who spoke at the 1992 Festival (a watershed year for LGBTQ+ cinema that gave rise to the term “New Queer Cinema”)—and invited a few guests from the next generation."
