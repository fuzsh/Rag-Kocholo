        "text": "1985\n\nCity Locations\n\nChicago, Illinois (USA)\n\nLocation Types\n\nSchool, Gym\n\nLocation Styles\n\nRetro, â50's/â 60s/â â70's, Modern Building\n\nAbout The Breakfast Club\n\nThe Breakfast Club is a teen coming-of-age comedy-drama movie that was released in 1985. John Hughes wrote, produced, and helmed the independent film, starring Molly Ringwald, Anthony Michael Hall, Emilio Estevez, Ally Sheedy, and Judd Nelson as five students serving detention for the day.\n\nThe plot follows five students of varying social classifications serving Saturday detention in a suburban Chicago high school library. When they find themselves in this strange environment with no one else to talk to but each other, they slowly start to open up and reveal more about themselves than they ever would have done during their time at school. For 8 hours, each student learns something about his or her life that others can apply to their personal lives.\n\nReleased on February 7th, 1985, in Los Angeles to critical acclaim, the film grossed over $51.5 million at the box office. The Breakfast Club has won numerous awards since its initial release, including an Online Film & Television Association for Motion Picture and Song (Don't You (Forget About Me)). The movie also won the MTV Movie + TV Awards - Silver Bucket of Excellence Award.\n\nAccording to Roger Ebert's review, he gave the film three stars out of four and praised the performances, but he also noted that the plot was somewhat predictable. However, he appreciated the film's focus on communication between the characters and its authentic depiction of teenage speech.\n\nThe Breakfast Club Locations\n\nThe release of The Breakfast Club, starring the infamous Brat Pack, was a watershed moment in 1980s American cinema. While much of the film takes place within the walls of Shermer High School, Hughes chose a wide array of settings to provide an interesting backdrop for his characters' stories. From a Chicago suburb to traditional high school hallways and beyond, The Breakfast Club made use of various regional locations for its production. The majority of scenes were shot at Maine North High School in Des Plaines, about 20 miles northwest of Chicago itself. The building had been unoccupied since 1981 and was used as the setting for Shermer High School's library and entranceway during filming.\n\nThe picturesque Illinois locale provided a quaint hometown feel with its rolling hills and one-story red brick buildings framed perfectly against the clear blue sky, making it an ideal setting to capture Hughes' vision on screen.\n\nJohn Hughes also incorporated his alma mater, Glenbrook North High School in Northbrook, into The Breakfast Club's production design. Certain hallways and corridors featured in the movie can be found at this educational institution just north of Chicago proper. For those who are up for a trip down memory lane or inkling to experience some of the same settings that graced our screen three decades ago, visiting The Breakfast Club filming locations is definitely worthwhile.\n\nThe five students discuss their lives and form an unlikely bond while sitting at a table in the middle of the library. With its long tables and bookshelves providing an atmosphere reflecting young angst and rebellion, the library has since become one of the most iconic locations in film history.\n\nJohn (Judd Nelson) is depicted as a rule-breaker who routinely bullies and harasses Claire (Molly Ringwald), Brian (Anthony Michael Hall), and Andrew (Emilio Estevez). He has a strained relationship with the principal and often talks back to and insults Vernon (Paul Gleason). Later on, the five students sneak out of the library to get John's stash of marijuana. They spend their time smoking, listening to music, and having conversations.\n\nThe scene was filmed in the Maine North High School gymnasium at 9511 Harrison Street in Des Plaines, Illinois. The location was selected because the empty hallways and classrooms resembled a typical high school during detention hours. Hughes was from Chicago and he regularly showcased the city in his movies, including The Breakfast Club.\n\nA fictional Chicago suburb called Shermer was created to film the movie, and a real Chicago suburban school called Des Plaines was used as the filming location. The building used in the filming is still standing but has been repurposed as the district headquarters for the Illinois State Police and other offices.\n\nTo visit the location where The Breakfast Club's library scene was filmed, head 20 miles northwest of Chicago. You can reach it by car or by taking Metra trains or CTA buses. Once you arrive at Des Plaines station, it's only a short walk to Maine North High School.\n\nChicago Filming Locations Map\n\nThe basement scene in The Breakfast Club is one of the movie's most dramatic scenes. It's where Principal Vernon (Paul Gleason) is caught looking through the personal files of his teachers by Carl, the school janitor (John Kapelos). While initially hostile to each other, the two eventually have a conversation about their respective lives.\n\nDuring this conversation, Principal Vernon has a few epiphanies of his own and learns that people are more than just labels like 'nerd' or 'jock.' The scene was shot at Park Ridge High School in Park Ridge, Illinois, USA. Although the exact location of the building is unknown, the area can still be visited today.\n\nIn the past, French explorers found that the site was an excellent place to travel between the Des Plaines and Chicago rivers. Later, New England and New York settlers arrived in the early 1830s. One popular attraction in Park Ridge is the Pickwick Theatre, built in 1928 and designed with an Art Deco style. Hillary Rodham Clinton, a former U.S. Senator, and first lady, grew up in Park Ridge.\n\nPark Ridge is between Chicago and O'Hare International Airport. You can get there via I-94 or I-90 W in about 25 minutes. Alternatively, use public transportation, you can take the Metra train (blue line) from downtown Chicago to Des Plaines Station, switch to Pace bus #290, and get off at Talcott & Prospect Ave stop for less than 20 minutes.\n\nAccess Chicago Video Shoot Locations\n\nThe ending scene of The Breakfast Club shows John Bende (Judd Nelson) walking across the football field and punching the air, all while the song Don't You (Forget About Me) by Simply Minds is heard in the background. Symbolizing his transformation from a misunderstood misfit to an empowered individual, he strides determinedly toward the camera and punches the air with a triumphant fist. This scene has since become an iconic cinematic moment and has been referenced many times in popular culture.\n\nThe scene was filmed at Glenbrook North High School, 2300 Shermer Rd, Northbrook, Illinois 60062, USA. It's home to the football field and many locker shots used at the beginning of the movie. John Hughes attended Glenbrook North High School, and filming some of the scenes at the school was sort of an homage to his experiences. Glenbrook North High School was also used as a location for the exterior scenes seen in another John Hughes film, Ferris Bueller's Day Off.\n\nTo get to Glenbrook North High School from the Chicago city center, take a metro blue line from Jackson to Harlem, and after that take a bus from Harlem Blue Line Station to Patriot Blvd./Willow. After a 15-minute walk, or taking a taxi you will reach Glenbrook North High School. Alternatively, you can get there by private car from downtown Chicago, and it will take around 30 minutes via I-94 W.\n\nUncover Chicago Film Shoot Locations\n\nThe Breakfast Club tells the story of five typical teenagers, a jock, a popular girl, a nerd, an outcast, and a rebel, who are forced to spend their Saturday together in detention. As they get to know each other better, they become closer and learn empathy for one another.\n\nIn contrast to the lighthearted humor in Sixteen Candles, Mr. Hughes's current work showcases a serious tone with sporadic comedic relief and trendy adolescent language, such as the phrase \"Yo, Waste-oid! You're not gonna blaze up in here,\" meaning \"Don't smoke.\" Despite this shift in tone, Mr. Hughes still maintains his skill in casting and playfulness from previous works.\n\nThe performances of the young actors were remarkable and admirable. They did justice to their respective roles and brought out the nuances of the characters nicely. The script was also well-written and delightful, with witty dialogue that resonated with viewers. It captured the essence of teenage angst realistically without being melodramatic or over-the-top.\n\nFurthermore, the idea behind The Breakfast Club was unique and made for an unpredictable yet captivating watch. The Breakfast Club has been hugely influential in shaping today's popular culture. It revolutionized the way teen movies are made and spawned many remakes inspired by its premise. Its impact was felt beyond just cinema; its themes resonating with many generations of teenagers since its release in 1985. The Breakfast Club is definitely worth watching if you haven't. Even decades after its initial release, it still holds up wonderfully as both a coming-of-age story and a timeless classic that speaks to all generations alike."
