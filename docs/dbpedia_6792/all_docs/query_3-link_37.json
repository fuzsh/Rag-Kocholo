        "text": "Points of Difference\n\nFilms and novels differ in many ways, and because of these differences the way they convey their themes, plots, and characters will necessarily differ. Three of the most obvious differences between films and novels are found in the scale, the level of realism they convey, and the reflection of the author or filmmaker's ideology.\n\nA Question of Scale\n\nSince the screenplay for a standard feature film runs between 80 and 110 pages and a novel normally runs more than 200 pages, when a novel is adapted to film the story is necessarily shortened. The screenwriter, director, and producers make decisions to cut scenes, characters, and even major elements of the original piece in order to fit the standard 90 to 120 minute feature film length. Occasionally, the filmmakers will opt to make a longer film, but this is usually considered a risk, unless the original work is so well-known that the audience might invest the extra time in the theatre. (Kenneth Branaugh’s Hamlet, for example, cuts very little of Shakespeare’s original play and runs over three hours.) But the most common preference is to shorten the original story in some significant way.\n\nThe other option that is sometimes taken when adapting literature into film is the mini-series. These adaptations are necessarily television-based and lose some of the visual and aural quality found in films made for the wide-screen. They also run from three to six hours and are generally shown over a period of successive nights or weeks. These showings might include commercials (as was the case with the BBC/A&E version of Jane Austen’s Pride and Prejudice) or might be shown commercial-free, as in the PPS series, Masterpiece Theatre. In either case, the ultimate viewers will be video-tape or DVD renters or purchasers. The aesthetic value of these adaptations can be very different because of the length and the television-based viewing.\n\nIn any case, when adapting any work of literature—most specifically a novel—into film, the filmmakers must make some changes in scale. When writing an analysis of the adaptation, therefore, the student should carefully consider the value of these changes: how do they affect the ultimate impact of the work of art?\n\nWhat is Real?\n\nHenry James wrote that literature’s aim is to present a version of real life. But each reader “sees” a different vision of the work of literature, so the idea of reality is interpreted by each of those readers. Similarly, when filmmakers interpret the “reality” found in a work of literature, the final vision reflects not only the ideas of the original author, but also the vision of the filmmakers.\n\nAdaptations can roughly be divided into two categories: straight or loose. For example, Jane Austen’s Emma was adapted to film in 1996 in a Miramax production starring Gwyneth Paltrow. This version retained the original period, setting, and most of the plot and characterization. This production credited Jane Austen and made the most of the Nineteenth Century connection. In 1994, however, Amy Heckerling wrote and produced Clueless, set in contemporary Beverly Hills. Most of the plot and themes of Austen’s original were retained, but many of the characters’ names and all of the original setting were updated. Both adaptations have value in understanding Austen’s work, and each should be considered as a valid, although different adaptations of the original.\n\nIdeology is Relative\n\nSometimes, however, a filmmaker’s attempt to stay true to the original text is thwarted by contemporary sensibilities, and the screenwriter or director’s ideology will come through the film when it was not present in the original work. For example, in Patricia Rozema's 1999 adaptation of Jane Austen’s Mansfield Park, a bold commentary about slavery is added to the film, where it is a mere reference in the novel. And in Emma Thompson’s 1995 screenplay of Austen’s Sense and Sensibility, she allows one of the main characters, Elinor Dashwood, to make a pointed commentary about the predicament of women in her society that Austen would not have been able to make in her novel. In each of these cases, the film adaptation is changed to project messages deemed important by the filmmakers, not by the original author.\n\nIn a similar way, Steven Spielberg made many ideological changes in his 1985 adaptation of Alice Walker’s novel, The Color Purple. Many of these changes, it is assumed by Walker and various critics, were made in order to popularize the controversial novel. In this case the ideology of the novel was modified, and Walker found it necessary to write a book about her experience with the adaptation process. (The Same River Twice, Simon & Schuster, 1995). Thus, considering the themes as well as the ideological basis for the original work of literature is important in analyzing a film adaptation. Considering the contemporary context of both the original work and the film is important when writing about film adaptation."
