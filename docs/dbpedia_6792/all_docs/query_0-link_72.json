        "text": "Zeitgeist The Movie is a film by Peter Joseph exploring the relationship between Christianity, the September 11 attacks and the Federal Reserve Bank. It was released in 2007 on Google Video and is available for free distribution. It is achieving notoriety very quickly, as of July 15, 2007 a specific google search shows 167,000 hits.\n\nDivided into three parts, (Part I: \"The Greatest Story Ever Told\", Part II: \"All The World's A Stage\", and Part III: \"Don't Mind The Men Behind The Curtain\"), Zeitgeist is designed to prompt the audience into questioning their own beliefs on the subjects of US involvement in the 9/11 terrorist attacks, Christian theology, the Federal Reserve System, and the decreasing status of personal freedoms in the United States of America due to introductions of laws and organizations such as The Department of Homeland Security and the Patriot Act\n\nStructure of Film[]\n\nOverture:[]\n\nZeitgeist The Movie starts with the Overture which is a 9.5 minute prologue laying out the foundation for the overall message of the film and how the three main sections have a tangible link. It has been changed in a subsequent release.\n\nThe first 5 minutes of the overture is a pastiche of clips showing the war of man, his homeland the Earth and a reminder of its insignificance in a vast universe. There follows a brief evolutionary link into the bible, the stars and stripes and back to the violence of heavy artillery, culminating with one of the towers of WTC collapsing during 9/11. The mood then changes and in contrast there follows a poignant sequence of clips showing the close up horrors of war. Including the infamous Vietnamese clip of the handcuffed prisoner being shot in the head in the street while people walk by going about their business.\n\nA narrative follows which basically asserts that the populace of the world has been lied to and the religious institutions are no exception to this deception. It alleges... \"The religious institutions in this world are..put there by the same people who gave you your government, your corrupt education, who set up your international banking cartels. Because our masters don't give a damn about you or your family. All they care about is what they have always cared about and that's controlling the whole damn world!\" The narrative continues by advising that the more one educates one's self the \"more obvious things become and you begin to see lies everywhere\", thus encouraging the viewer of the film to not be so apathetic or trusting of The Establishment. The narrative so far is then summed up by a screen banner saying... \"They must find it difficult... Those who have taken authority as the truth, rather than truth as the authority - G. Massey. Egyptologist\"\n\nThe final 2 minutes of the overture features the soundtrack of George Carlin on stage telling the story of religion to a laughing audience where the central theme is that \"religion is all powerful, all perfect, all knowing and all wise, but somehow ... just can't handle money!\" - The audience are told that Religion takes in billions of Dollars and pays no taxes..\n\nPart I: The Greatest Story Ever Told[]\n\nPart I deals with the origins of Christianity in paganism and the parallels between Jesus and the Egyptian Sun God, Horus [1] and many other mythical figures of diverse times and locations in history. [2] This part also documents a series of biblical passages which try to prove that Christian theology is nothing more than an extrapolation of preexisting texts and that The Bible is nothing more than an astrotheological literary hybrid. It introduces varied trivia to dispel the Gospel of Jesus. But doesn't critique its own argument. For example: Horus has 12 disciples (which happens to be questioned even by Egyptologist) and so did Buddha and Kirshna, so why not Jesus?[3][4]\n\nThe Sun[]\n\nPart 1 begins by explaining how and why early civilizations personified The Sun as the \"unseen Creator or God\" [5] and how stars were linked into constellations, the 12 constellations being a place of travel for \"God's Sun\" and representing \"...elements of nature that happened during that period of time.\" This was depicted graphically by the image of the Cross of Zodiac (pictured Left), which shows the 12 constellations, 12 months of the year, 4 seasons, solstices and equinoxes. This section is also used by the film to show the Pagan origins of the symbol of the Cross.[6]\n\nHorus[]\n\nHorus, the Ancient Egyptian Sun God, is introduced as having a number of attributes in common with Jesus [7] The table below shows the comparisons between Jesus and Horus as alleged by the film. It is to be noted that the film does not mention Jesus during the section on Horus, as it presumably allows the viewer to forge the link by him or herself.\n\nAlso discussed is the relationship between Horus and Set[8] Apparently every morning Horus would \"win the battle against Set\" and every evening Set would conquer Horus and banish him to the underworld. The movie describes this conflict between Dark and Light or Good and Evil as \"one of the most ubiquitous mythological dualities ever known.\"\n\nZeitgeist The Movie's Comparison Of Jesus and Horus Occurrence Jesus Horus Born of a.. Virgin Virgin Birthday Dec 25th (research places his birth in Sept or early Jan) Dec 25th Birth Heralded by \"Star In the East\" Sirius (Morning Star) Further Witnesses Three Wise Men ( actually the Bible just says wise men, it never gives a number ) Three Solar Deities Age of Rite of Passage 12 12 Age at Baptism 30 30 Followers 12 Disciples (had more than 12 but used 12 in order to establish the Church) 12 Disciples (questioned among Egyptiologists) Amazing Feats Walked On water, Healed the sick Walked On water, Healed the sick How he Died Crucifixion on a cross Crucifixion on a tree Post Death Events Went to Hell, resurrected after about 35 hours, covering 3 separate days Went to Hell, resurrected after three days Resurrection? Yes Yes\n\nSimilar mythological Gods[]\n\nHaving interested the viewer with the striking similarities between Horus and Jesus the film then goes on to introduce even more mythological gods that it alleges share extremely similar attributes....\n\nAttis (Greece-1200BC) - born of a virgin born on Dec 25th crucified, dead for 3 days and resurrected.[9][10]\n\nKrishna (India-900BC) - born of a virgin, star in the east, performed miracles and resurrected upon death.[11][12]\n\nDionysus (Greece-500BC) - born of a virgin,dec 25th. Performed miracles and resurrected upon death.[13]\n\nMithra (Persia-1200BC) - born of a virgin,dec 25th. 12 disciples, Performed miracles and resurrected upon death after 3 days.[14][15]\n\n... and further lists a multitude of others purportedly with also similar attributes, displaying that there is a running theme among many mythological religious figures.\n\nIn regards to the similarities between all these mythological figures, the film asks the question \"Why these attributes? - Why the virgin birth on December 25th? - Why dead for three days and the inevitable resurrection? - Why the twelve disciples?\"\n\nJesus[]\n\nIn an effort to answer the above questions the figure Jesus is introduced as the \"most recent of solar messiahs\". The film tells Jesus' story which is almost identical to that of Horus and other mythological figures and then the film explains the birth of Jesus in relation to astrological events.\n\nVirgin Birth[]\n\nThe birth sequence of Jesus is presented as being \"completely astrological\". Explained as the following connections. The star in the east is Sirius. - Which on Dec 24th aligns with the 3 stars of Orion's belt. - The three bright stars in Orion's belt are called \"The Three Kings\" - The Three Kings and Sirius all point to the place of the sunrise on December 25. This is why the 3 kings follow the 'star in the east', in order to locate the 'sunrise, the birth of the sun.\n\nThe Virgin Mary is the constellation virgo. - Also known as Virgo the Virgin. - The ancient glyph for Virgo is the altered 'M' ( see picture ) - This is why Mary and other virgin mothers Adonis's mother Myra, and Budha's mother Maya begin with M - Virgo is also referred to as the House of Bread. Bethlehem literally translates to House of Bread. Bethlehem is thus a reference to the constellation Virgo \"A place in the Sky. Not On earth\"\n\nDec 25th[]\n\nDecember the 25th has already been mentioned as a common virgin birthdate for a number of mythological figures and the film here explains its significance in terms of the annual Earth cycle. From the Summer Solstice the days become shorter in the northern hemisphere and The Sun appears to move south and more scarce. The 'ancients' believe the shortening of the days and expiration of the crops symbolised death. The death of The Sun. By December 22 the Sun stops moving south. It reaches its lowest point in the sky and stops for 3 days while residing in the vicinity of the Southern Cross (Crux) constellation. On December 25 The Sun moves 1 degree north and, says the film, \"forshadows longer days, warm and spring\"\n\nThe film deduces that \"The Sun died on the cross, was dead for 3 days, only to be resurrected or born again. This is why Jesus and other sun gods share the crucifixion, a 3 day death and resurrection. the Sun's transition period.\" The film also explains the resurrection of the Sun wasn't celebrated until the Spring Equinox or 'Easter' - At the Spring Equinox the Sun officially overpowers the 'evil darkness', where days become longer than nights.\n\nTwelve Disciples[]\n\nThe film asserts that the 12 disciples are the 12 constellations of the Zodiac who Jesus, being the Sun, travels about with. It also mentions the number 12 is common throughout the bible...\n\nThe film shows an open bible and asserts \"this text has more to do with astrology than anything else.\"\n\nCross Of Zodiac[]\n\nIn this section the film asserts the Christian Cross is actually a pagan adaptation of the cross of the Zodiac. The Cross of the Zodiac, \"the figurative life of the sun\" says the film, was \"not just a tool to track the Sun's movement.\" It was also a pagan spiritual symbol. It is shown that Jesus in early occult art is always shown with his head on this cross by showing a series of images depicting such.\n\nThere is then a short narrative depicting Jesus as the Sun and the Sun's daily cycle as seen from Earth. \"For Jesus is the Sun. The Sun/Son of God, the Light Of The World(Sun). The Risen Saviour, who will come again, as it does every morning(Sunrise). The glory of god who defends against the the works of darkness (sunset/night), as he is born again every morning, and can be seen coming in the clouds, up in heaven{sky}, with his crown of thorns..... or Sunrays.\"\n\nThe Age[]\n\nThis section deals with what the Film calls \"The Age\" and cites the numerous references to this label in the Christian Scriptures. The film proceeds to each the viewer about the significance of The Age by explaining the astrological phenomena the Precession of the Equinoxes. It says that Ancient Egyptions and cultures \"long before them\" recognised that every 2150 years the sunrise on the morning of the Spring Equinox would rise in a different sign of the Zodiac. This is due to the slow angular wobble of the Earth caused by the different gravitational forces of the Sun. Moon and Earth. The film explains it is called a precession because \"the constellations go backward rather than through the normal yearly cycle\"\n\nIt is explained that the time it takes to go thorugh all 12 signs is approx 25,765 years, which is also called a Great Year and that ancient societies were very aware of this and they referred to each 2150 period as an 'Age'. The film states that the period from 4300 BC to 2150 BC it was the age of Taurus the Bull, From 2150BC to 1AD it was the Age of Aries the Ram,from 1AD to 2150 AD it is the Age of Pisces and In 2150 AD we will enter the new age of Aquarius.\n\nPart II: All The World's a Stage[]\n\nPart II deals primarily with 9/11 and asserts that it was a false flag[16] operation in order to provide public backing for the US Establishment to continue its agenda in the Middle East and at home.[17] It also suggests that the bombings in London that took place on the 7th of July, 2005 were orchestrated by the state.[18]\n\nBe ready cause on March 15 it will be National \"Z\" day. We have to do something about it and support this film!!\n\nPart III: Don't Mind The Men Behind The Curtain[]\n\nPart III begins with the argument (citing numerous quotes from the founding fathers) that the American Revolution was in part sparked by an imposition by King George III which forced the colonies to use currency, borrowed at interest, from the Central Bank of England, rather than using the currency that was being produced by the American Colonies, interest free.\n\nThe film then moves to describes the Federal Reserves System that was implemented in 1913 via the Federal Reserve Act. The movie details how bankers were the creators of the Federal Reserve Act and that the system is a fraud which, in the modern day, creates money out of nothing and loans it to the US Government at interest. The point is made that the money supply is regulated by the owners of the Federal Reserve Bank in the interest of the Stock Holders of the Federal Reserve. It also points out the that Federal Resevrve is a \"private corporation, virtually unregulated by the US Government\". It also details how the income tax is a fraud through the claim that the States did not fully/legally ratify the 16th Amendment in 1913, and how there is no documented federal law that plainly states that the average worker must pay federal income tax on his or her wages.\n\nFurthermore, the film postulates that many wars entered into by the U.S. starting with World War I has been the result of forced provocation(false flags) through secret U.S. involvement in cloak and dagger operations in order to goad the American public into supporting the wars. The ultimate goal of which is expansion of United States foreign interests and prolonged sustainment of conflict overseas to increase military spending, thereby boosting profits for corporations tied to politicians and the elite.\n\nThe film then discusses the The Bush Administration's post Sept. 11th 2001 actions, subsequent wars and policy directives, including the Homeland Security Dept. and Patriot Act. The implication made is that the actions follow the same fraudulent course of action used by Adolf Hitler during the WWII, which began when Hitler staged a false flag attack on the German Parliament Building, the Reichstag.\n\nThe work concludes with implications of a coming police state in America and how the continual erosion of civil liberties, coupled with the exploitation of fear in the mass media, will result in a fully \"controlled\", dominated and oppressed population in America.\n\nFilm Sources / Credits[]\n\nThe Zeitgeist website lists sources for each part of the movie. http://zeitgeistmovie.com/sources.htm\n\nReferences[]\n\nWord of mouth[]\n\nZeitgeist has reached a considerable audience, for a film with no commercial publicity.
