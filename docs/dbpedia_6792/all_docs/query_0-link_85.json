        "text": "Americans took three of the major awards at this year's Cannes Film Festival. However, the top prize, the Golden Palm, given to the best film in the festival, went to a Yugoslav movie, ''Papa Is on a Business Trip'' (''Otac Na Sluzbenom Putu''), directed by Emir Kusturica. ''Papa Is on a Business Trip,'' a comedy-drama about an affable philanderer who is imprisoned during Tito's postwar crackdown on Stalinism, was chosen unanimously by the jury, a rare occurrence at this festival.\n\nThe special jury grand prize, traditionally given to the runner-up film, went to an American movie, ''Birdy,'' the story of a friendship between a young man who wants to fly and his boyhood companion, who has been mutilated in the Vietnam War. ''Birdy,'' directed by Alan Parker, was a box-office failure in the United States last Christmas and was overlooked for Academy Award nominations despite favorable reviews.\n\nIn a brief ceremony tonight at the Cannes Film Palace, William Hurt was named best actor for his performance in the Brazilian film ''Kiss of the Spider Woman'' as an imprisoned homosexual who survives by fantasizing about the movies he has seen. For her performance as the mother of a disfigured teen-ager in the American film ''Mask,'' Cher shared the best actress award with Norma Aleandro. Miss Aleandro was honored for her role in the Argentine movie ''The Official Version'' (''La Historia Oficial''). Miss Aleandro plays a middle-class woman who fears that the child she has adopted is the daughter of one of the Desaparecidos, the men and women who were arrested and vanished during the Government's war against terrorism in the 1970's.\n\nAn Award for Cher\n\nToday is Cher's 40th birthday. When she accepted her award, the actress thanked her mother for having ''the good taste to have me on the 20th of May so I could receive this as the best birthday present of my life.''\n\nToday is also James Stewart's birthday. The actor, who turned 77, received a standing ovation when he was given a special tribute for his lifetime of movie acting. Mr. Stewart -who has also picked up the American Film Institute's Life Achievement Award, Kennedy Center honors and an honorary Academy Award during the last few years - told a news conference yesterday that he had no fear about the future of the motion picture. ''It's indestructable,'' he said. ''It will be with us always.''\n\nThe acting awards were heavily applauded, but the award for best director was fiercely booed. Historically, the jury manages to give at least one award each year to a French film. Best director went to Andre Techine for the French movie ''Rendez-vous,'' about a young woman who, according to Mr. Techine's program notes, ''carries out apprenticeships of the theater and love.'' A panel of critics from 12 countries has been rating the festival movies for one of the trade journals here. Only two of the critics gave ''Rendez-vous'' a rating better than fair.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
