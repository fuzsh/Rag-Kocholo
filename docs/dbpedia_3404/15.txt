Anyone in any of the following roles should be considered a potential PEP.

PEPs in Government Roles

Legislative Bodies: An example is a Member of Parliament

Executive Bodies: A PEP could range from the head of state down to the assistant ministers

Diplomatic Roles: Ambassadors or chargé d’affaires would be considered PEPs

Judiciary Bodies: Key people working within supreme courts, constitutional courts or high-level judicial bodies

State-Owned Enterprises: A PEP would typically be anyone from a senior executive upwards. However, even former members of the board of directors no longer associated with an organization may retain influence and still be flagged as PEPs

PEPs in Organizations and Institutions

Central Financial Institutions: Examples here would be the Court of Auditors and members on the boards of central banks

Armed Forces: In this situation a PEP rating would typically only apply to a high-ranking officer

International Sports Committees: Members of these committees may be influenced to vote on the location of major sporting events/contracts for building venues, etc., so have recently been included by FATF under their definition of a PEP

Known ‘Close Associates’ who are Considered PEPs

Anyone with a close business relationship or joint beneficial ownership of legal entities or legal arrangements with a PEP

Anyone who has the sole beneficial ownership of a legal entity which is known to have been set up for the benefit de facto of the PEP

Immediate Family Members who are Considered PEPs

Parents and children of PEPs

Spouse or partner

Siblings

Uncles and aunts

Even slightly indirect family members (such as in-laws) will be considered as politically exposed persons

Note: Each country may have different local PEP regulations that you need to comply with when doing business in that region.

Test Yourself: Are these people PEPs?

The mayor of Paris

A former member of the board of directors for a state-owned enterprise

A famous actress

Head of the Olympic Committee

The son-in-law of the mayor of Paris

A town councilor

The justice of the peace in a Magistrates Court

The manager of a national football team

The business partner of someone who has a sister on the Olympic Committee

It’s easy to see how the list of potential PEPs is expansive and continually in flux as people move into new roles, family members change, regulations and recommendations from the FATF are updated at the local level, and the international landscape changes.
