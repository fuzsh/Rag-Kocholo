        "text": "Complaints are processed upon receipt and the source is notified by letter of the status of their complaint. When information received by the Department of Health Professions indicates a violation of law or regulation within this Agency's jurisdiction may have occurred, it is the responsibility of the Enforcement Division to obtain whatever additional information is needed to prove or disprove that a violation has occurred. Information is gathered and submitted to the appropriate Health Regulatory Board for consideration and action. The Board initially decides whether the evidence is sufficient to indicate that a violation law or regulation may have occurred. If the evidence is not sufficient for that purpose, the case is then closed and no further action is taken. If the Board believes there is sufficient evidence to indicate that a violation of law or regulation may have occurred, a determination is made (following the Administrative Processes Act) whether the accused has violated a law or regulation, and if so, the Board imposes disciplinary action. Click here to see a detailed explanation of the Disciplinary Process.\n\nMedical records are the property of the practitioner; however, the consumer is entitled to copies of those records under the provisions of several sections of the Virginia Code, including: Â§32.1-127.1:03 Patient Health Records Privacy; Â§51.4-111(C)(ii) Unlawful Acts; prosecution, proceedings in equity; and Â§8.01-413 Certain copies of health care providerâs records or papers of patient admissible, right of patient or his attorney to copies of such records or papers, subpoena, damages, costs and attorneyâs fees. To search for laws or regulations you may access the Virginia Legislature Information System.\n\nYou or your authorized representative must request a copy of your medical record in writing to the provider. The provider has 30 days to respond to you. If the provider does not respond to your written request after 30 days, you have the option to file a complaint with our agency. Be sure to keep a copy of the written request you send to the provider and its delivery method, as it may be needed later on if an investigation is conducted.\n\nYou are not required to be present at your informal conference or formal hearing in order for the Board to hear the case and make a decision regarding your license. The Board will convene the informal conference or formal hearing whether you are present or not. If you do not appear, you will not have the chance to respond to any questions Board members may have regarding the allegations against you.\n\nIf you want to attend but are unable to attend the informal conference or formal hearing on the scheduled date, you should request a continuance in writing as soon as possible. Please refer to your notice for filing deadlines and take note that you must provide \";good cause\" for not being able to attend. It is up to the Board to decide whether to grant or deny your request for a continuance.\n\nIf you do not attend an informal conference conducted by an Agency Subordinate, you will not have the right to appeal the Board's decision to a formal administrative hearing. The only appeal will be to the circuit court.\n\nYou may hire an attorney to represent you, but you are not required to have an attorney at an informal conference or formal hearing. Neither the Board nor the Commonwealth will appoint an attorney for you. If you do hire an attorney, he or she should notify the Board in writing as soon as possible that he or she has been retained.\n\nYou may not have anyone who is not a licensed Virginia attorney represent you at an informal conference or formal hearing without the Board's permission. See the Agency's policy document on Pro hac vice practice, Admission of Out-of-State Counsel and Practice by Non-Lawyers, for further information.\n\nVirginia Code Â§ 54.1-2400(10) allows a Board to delegate the authority to conduct informal fact-finding conferences to an Agency Subordinate. An Agency Subordinate may be a current or former member of a Board, a staff member, or any other individual designated by the agency. After the informal conference, the Agency Subordinate makes a recommendation to the Board as to whether a respondent has violated the laws and regulations identified in the notice and, if so, what sanction, if any, the Board should impose. The respondent will have the opportunity to review and respond to the Agency Subordinate's recommendation in writing before it is presented to the Board. A respondent who appeared at the informal conference may appear and speak to the Board when the Board considers the recommendation. The Board can either accept the recommendation, modify the recommendation, or reject the recommendation and schedule a formal hearing. You will be notified in writing of the Board's decision. See Agency policy: The Adjudication Process, for further information.\n\nAll informal conferences and formal administrative hearings are public proceedings. Any member of the public, including the news media, may attend. The Board will send notice of the proceeding to the source of the complaint, who may also be present. The Board members who make up the Special Conference Committee, or the Agency Subordinate, will preside over the informal conference. Also in attendance will be Board staff and an Adjudication Specialist from the Administrative Proceedings Division.\n\nAt formal administrative hearings, a panel of the Board members will hear and decide your case. Also present will be Board staff and an attorney from the Office of the Attorney General, who serves as counsel to the Board. Either an Adjudication Specialist or another attorney from the Office of the Attorney General will prosecute the case on behalf of the Commonwealth. A court reporter will be present to record the hearing. Both the Commonwealth and the respondent may subpoena witnesses to attend and testify under oath at the hearing. See Agency policy: The Adjudication Process, for further information.\n\nIn general, at informal conferences, there are no witnesses and there is no cross-examination. The SCC or Agency Subordinate has the discretion to allow anyone to speak on behalf of the Commonwealth or the respondent, and the SCC or Agency Subordinate may ask questions of anyone who is allowed to speak. The SCC or Agency Subordinate also has the discretion to allow the respondent to ask questions of any speaker.\n\nAt the formal hearing, you have the right to cross-examine any witness for the Commonwealth. Likewise, the Assistant Attorney General or Adjudication Specialist who is prosecuting the case may cross-examine you and your witnesses, and Board members may ask questions of you and all witnesses.\n\n\"Burden of proof\" is the necessity of establishing facts in dispute on an issue before the Board. The burden of proof must be met in order to create a reasonable belief in Board members that those facts are true. In cases alleging that a licensee has violated a law or regulation governing their profession, the Commonwealth has the burden of proving the allegations. In cases where an individual seeks a license or reinstatement of a license, the individual has the burden of proving that they meet the requirements for licensure or reinstatement and are safe and competent to practice.\n\nThe Board must find that disputed facts have been proven by \"clear and convincing\" evidence in order to find a respondent in violation of applicable laws and regulations and to impose a sanction. This standard of proof is less burdensome than proof \"beyond a reasonable doubt,\" which is the standard in criminal cases.\n\nThe Boards within the Department of Health Professions may take actions as identified in Virginia Code Â§54.1-2400. The actions the Board may take include: dismiss the case and exonerate you; modify a previous order regarding you; approve your initial licensure application (with or without terms or conditions on your practice); deny your initial licensure application; reinstate your license (with or without terms or conditions on your practice); deny your reinstatement application; place you on probation; reprimand you; impose a monetary penalty; or suspend or revoke your license. Following the proceeding, the Board actions are mailed to you in the form of an order issued by the Board.\n\nSee the response to FAQ #19 regarding what actions the Board can take following an informal conference conducted by a Special Conference Committee versus an Agency Subordinate, and those following a formal hearing.\n\nAll cases are handled on an individual basis. However, each Board has developed and adopted a Sanctioning Reference Point (SRP) system for certain types of cases it considers on a regular basis.\n\nThe SRP system provides the Board with a tool designed to help it standardize disciplinary actions when sanctions are considered as a result of professional misconduct. The Board is only guided by the SRP system worksheet and may deviate from the predicted sanctions based upon the facts and circumstances of a given case.\n\nThe SRP system is only used for consideration by the Board in sanctioning with offered prehearing consent orders and at informal conferences. It is not used at formal hearings. Boards have adopted SRP Manuals as Guidance Documents or policies. They can be accessed from each Boardâs webpage link as listed below:\n\nAudiology & Speech-Language Pathology\n\nCounseling\n\nDentistry\n\nFuneral Directors & Embalmers\n\nLong-term Care Administrators\n\nMedicine\n\nNursing\n\nOptometry\n\nPharmacy\n\nPhysical Therapy\n\nPsychology\n\nSocial Work\n\nVeterinary Medicine\n\nThe Board deliberates during a closed meeting to make a decision once all the evidence and testimony has been presented at both informal conferences conducted by a Special Conference Committee and at all formal hearings. In most instances, after the Board makes its decision, it will reconvene in an open meeting and announce the decision regarding your case. Following the announcement, you may not discuss the decision with the Board members. However, you may ask questions of Board staff once outside the room. Subsequently, the Board's decision will be mailed to you in writing along with any further instructions.\n\nIf your informal conference was conducted by an Agency Subordinate, there is no case deliberation, no immediate decision is made, and no announcement will be made at the conclusion of your case. The written recommendation of the Agency Subordinate will be mailed to you within 90 days. The Board may accept, modify or reject the recommendation of the Agency Subordinate. If accepted or modified, an Order will be issued and mailed to you. If rejected, the case will be referred to a formal hearing of a panel of the Board. Please see the response to FAQ #4 for more information about Agency Subordinate informal conference processes.\n\nFor Informal Conferences conducted by a Special Conference Committee: Although the decision may be announced at the conclusion of an informal conference conducted by a Special Conference Committee, the decision does not go into effect until 33 days following the date the order is signed and entered. During the 33 days, you may appeal the decision and a formal hearing will be convened before the Board. Upon receipt of your appeal, the informal conference order will be vacated and will not go into effect.\n\nFor Informal Conferences conducted by an Agency Subordinate: The effective date that an order issued by the Board following an informal conference conducted by an Agency Subordinate will depend on whether you appeared at your informal conference. If you did not appear, the order is considered a final decision of the Board and can only be appealed to the circuit court. If you appeared, then the decision does not go into effect until 33 days following the date the order is signed and entered. During the 33 days, you may appeal the decision to a formal hearing with the Board. Upon receipt of your appeal, the informal conference order will be vacated, will not go into effect, and a formal hearing will be convened.\n\nFor Formal Hearings: Although the decision may be announced at the conclusion of a formal hearing, the decision does not go into effect until the written order is signed and entered by the Board. This is a final decision of the Board and may only be appealed to the circuit court. The Boardâs order includes the date it becomes final and deadlines for appealing the decision. Once a deadline has passed, your right to appeal has expired. It is your responsibility to ensure all paperwork is filed with the circuit court pursuant to Rule 1A:4 of the Rules of the Supreme Court of Virginia. See also Agency policy: The Adjudication Process.\n\nAll notices of proceedings and orders are public information pursuant to Virginia Code Â§ 54.1-2400.2(G). Notices and the resulting orders, which contain findings of fact and conclusions of law, will be published on the DHP website. If your case was ultimately dismissed following a proceeding, the notice will not be published on the agencyâs website, although it remains public information by law. However, on the agency website, the following statement will be posted to your license in the License Lookup section: This practitioner was the subject of a proceeding that did not result in disciplinary action. If you want further information, you may contact the [relevant Board]. Please see Guidance Document 76-10.17.\n\nAlthough the notice and order are public information, the investigative report remains confidential, pursuant to Virginia Code Â§54.1-2400.2(A).\n\nIf your license is revoked, you are eligible to apply for reinstatement after three years from the date of entry of the revocation order, pursuant to Virginia Code Â§54.1-2408.2. However, licensees of the Board of Medicine whose licenses are revoked due to boundary issues cannot apply for reinstatement for five years pursuant to Virginia Code Â§54.1-2408.2 . Additionally, Certified Nurse Aides (C.N.A.s) who are revoked based upon a Finding of Abuse, Neglect or Misappropriation of Patient Property are not eligible for reinstatement according to federal law and 18 VAC 90-25-80(B)(2) of the Regulations Governing Certified Nurse Aides . The only exception to permanent revocation for C.N.A.s with one of these Findings is for a Finding of Neglect based upon a single incident as provided in 18 VAC 90-25-81.\n\nIf your license is suspended, the Order will indicate when you are eligible to apply for reinstatement. When you apply to reinstate your license following a suspension or revocation, the burden of proof will be on you to demonstrate to the Board that you are safe and competent to return to practice."
