Assistant District Attorneys hail from all corners of the county and the globe. Many are multilingual. They can work with, and relate to, people from all over the world and from different paths in life. Our Assistants chose to work here because Queens is the personification of the American Dream and they want to help protect that dream for those that pursue it.\n\nDistrict Attorney Melinda Katz is a true daughter of Queens County, who knows every nook and cranny of the World’s Borough. Her progressive reforms have transformed the Office into a 21st Century operation that focuses on fairness, safety, and justice for everyone involved in the criminal justice system. This new forward-thinking and modern prosecutor’s office needs unique individuals who reflect the community we serve.\n\nEach year we seek candidates who are ready to serve our community. Although strong academic credentials are a factor, we also look for a demonstrated commitment to public service and interest in criminal law. Successful candidates must evince an ability to empathize, exercise good judgment, and possess a mature understanding of the needs of the community.\n\nEach seat in the Fall and Spring classes is highly competitive. All applications are thoroughly reviewed, and successful candidates undergo three rounds of interviews as follows:\n\nInitial Interview with an Assistant District Attorney from the Hiring Committee.\n\nPanel Interview with two senior Assistant District Attorneys from the Hiring Partners Committee.\n\nExecutive Interview with the Director of Legal Hiring and two members of the Executive and/or Senior Management staff. The performance of an opening statement (fact pattern provided) is also required.\n\nInterview Tips\n\nDo your homework and learn everything you can about the Queens District Attorney’s Office and Queens County.\n\nBe prepared to discuss in detail what is expected from the role of a prosecutor.\n\nBe prepared to discuss why you want to become a prosecutor in Queens County.\n\nA high level of understanding on topics such as ethics and suppression issues is expected.\n\nIt's vital to show the reasoning behind your answers, whether you know the law or not.\n\nTaking initiative is highly valued. We encourage you to make your case as to why you should become a prosecutor for the Queens District Attorney’s Office.\n\nBe yourself and be genuine in your responses. We welcome diversity of thought and opinion.\n\nDon’t feel pressured to ask questions at the end of your interview, you don’t want to pose “canned” questions. Genuine questions only!\n\nIn the event of a virtual interview, try to neutralize your background so that nothing is distracting the participants.\n\nFAQ (Frequently Asked Questions)\n\nWhat is the starting salary?\n\nNon-admitted: $85,000\n\nAdmitted: $88,000\n\nHow long is the commitment?\n\nThere is a 3-year commitment for ADAs.\n\nDo I have to live in New York State?\n\nYes.\n\nDo you require recommendation letters?\n\nNot required but will accept them if sent on your behalf.\n\nAre references required?\n\nYes, when you are asked to complete an Employment Application.

The department administers career-oriented training programs which include an intensive four-week Incoming Orientation Training Program for new hires, a Felony Assistant/Grand Jury Training Program, meant to develop prosecutors as they progress in their career and begin handling felonies, as well as trial advocacy training for both Criminal Court and Supreme Court assistants. In addition to the career programs, the Legal Training Department administers Monthly Office-Wide CLEs and weekly CLEs designed to address issues specific to individual divisions and bureaus.\n\nBrave Justice Summer Legal Internship\n\nThe Brave Justice Summer Legal Internship Program, established by District Attorney Melinda Katz, is designed to provide law students with an outstanding opportunity to learn about the Queens District Attorney’s Office, which serves the most diverse county in the country.

Interns will be assigned to a specific bureau under newly created Divisions and will work with Assistant District Attorneys.* Depending on the assignment, they engage in many aspects of prosecutorial work, such as:\n\nresearch and writing assignments, including briefs to be heard by the Appellate Division, Second Department of New York State Supreme Court\n\nmotion and discovery practice\n\ncivilian and police interviews\n\ncourt appearances pursuant to the student practice order\n\ncrime scene visits\n\nparticipation in community outreach through the Community Partnerships Division\n\nInterns are also exposed to the inner workings of the Alternative Sentencing initiatives which give selected defendants a second chance to redirect their lives.\n\nThe Brave Justice Summer Legal Internship Program also includes numerous events and multiple presentations throughout the summer to introduce Interns to the various bureaus in the office, and most importantly, to the community of professionals in the criminal justice system who work in their respective roles to achieve justice for everyone.\n\n*The format and activities of this internship will be dependent on maintaining a healthy and safe environment for all. The options will range from in person, to hybrid (in person/remote work), or a fully remote program. Interns will be advised of the format before their start date.\n\nInvestigative/Administrative Positions\n\nA number of key functions for the office are performed by the Office's support staff, including vital support for trial divisions, as well as other community services and office functions.\n\nThe City of New York is an inclusive equal opportunity employer committed to recruiting and retaining a diverse workforce and providing a work environment that is free from discrimination and harassment based upon any legally protected status or protected characteristic, including but not limited to an individual's sex, race, color, ethnicity, national origin, age, religion, disability, sexual orientation, veteran status, gender identity, or pregnancy."
