        "text": "In 2023, Oregon created a new type of legal licensure to help meet the civil legal needs of Oregonians.\n\nSimilar to Nurse Practitioners in the medical profession, Licensed Paralegals (LPs) will be authorized to perform some limited-scope legal tasks previously available only from lawyers. The license is for designated legal work in housing and family law, the two areas of greatest unmet need by Oregonians.\n\nLicensed paralegals must meet specific requirements for education and experience, and will be subject to many of the same rules and regulatory requirements that currently apply to lawyers. The intent is to provide access to legal help for those who currently cannot afford a lawyer or who otherwise might go to court with no legal assistance. We look forward to welcoming these new providers into the bar and the legal profession.\n\nWe are now accepting LP applications. To apply, please see our application here: https://www.osbar.org/lp/apply.html."
