        "text": "Code of Conduct for Members of the European Parliament\n\nThe Code of Conduct entered into force on 1 January 2012 and was last revised in 2023. It sets out as its guiding principles that Members shall act solely in the public interest and conduct their work with disinterest, integrity, openness, diligence, honesty, accountability and respect for the European Parliament's dignity and reputation.\n\nThe Code of Conduct defines conflicts of interest and how Members should address them and it includes rules on disclosure obligations, activities of former Members and the Advisory Committee on the Conduct of Members.\n\nThe Code of Conduct also puts an obligation on Members to submit a detailed declaration of their private interests, a declaration of assets and, where applicable, a declaration of awareness of conflict of interests. Furthermore, the Code of Conduct obliges Members to publish all scheduled meetings, also when delegated to their assistants, with interest representatives falling under the Transparency Register and with representatives of public authorities of third countries. Members are also obliged to declare their attendance at events organised by third parties, where the reimbursement of their travel, accommodation, or subsistence expenses, or the direct payment of such expenses, is fully or partly covered by a third party. The information supplied by Members in their declarations can be found on the Members' individual profile pages, except for the declaration of assets, which is not public.\n\nMembers also have to declare gifts they have received when representing Parliament in an official capacity with an approximate value of more than EUR 150, under the conditions laid down in the Implementing Measures to the Code of Conduct. Such gifts are reported in the register of gifts.\n\nAny Member found to be in breach of the Code of Conduct can be given a penalty by the President. This penalty is announced by the President in Plenary and prominently published on Parliament's website.\n\nSee\n\nSalaries and pensions\n\nSalary of MEPs\n\nMEPs, in general, receive the same salary under the single statute which came into effect in July 2009.\n\nAccording to the Statute, the salary of a MEP is set at 38.5% of the basic salary of a judge at the European Court of Justice. Concretely, the monthly pre-tax salary of MEPs is EUR 10 377.43. The salary is paid from Parliament's budget and is subject to an EU tax and insurance contributions, after which the net monthly salary is EUR 8 089.63. Member States may also subject the salary to national taxes.\n\nThere is one exception: MEPs who held a mandate in Parliament before the 2009 elections could opt to keep the previous national system for salary, transitional allowance and pensions.\n\nPensions\n\nUnder the statute, former Members are entitled to an old-age pension from the age of 63. The pension equals 3.5% of the salary of MEPs for each full year’s exercise of a mandate, and one-twelfth of that figure for each additional full month of mandate, but not more than 70% of the salary of MEPs in total. The cost of these pensions is met from the European Union budget.\n\nAn additional pension scheme, introduced for MEPs in 1989, was closed to new members from July 2009 and is being phased out.\n\nMEPs' allowances\n\nLike Members of national parliaments, Members of the European Parliament receive a number of allowances that are intended to cover the expenditure they incur in the performance of their parliamentary duties.\n\nGeneral expenditure allowance\n\nThis allowance is intended to cover expenditure in the Member State of election, such as Members’ office management costs, telephone and postal charges, and the purchase, operation and maintenance of computer and telematics equipment. The allowance is halved in the case of Members who, without due justification, do not attend half the number of plenary sittings in one parliamentary year (September to August).\n\nThe amount of this allowance in 2024 is EUR 4 950 per month.\n\nOrdinary travel expenses\n\nMost meetings of the European Parliament, such as plenary sessions, committee meetings and political group meetings, take place in Brussels or Strasbourg. Upon presentation of the supporting documents, Members are reimbursed of the actual cost of their travel tickets for attending such meetings, up to a maximum of the D business class (or similar) air fare, the first class rail fare or up to EUR 0.58 per km for car journeys (up to a maximum of 720 km per journey and 60 000 km per year).\n\nAdditionally, in order to cover other travel-related expenses (such as motorway tolls, excess baggage charges or reservation fees or meals, drinks etc) Members are entitled to allowances based on the distance and duration of the journey. These allowances are only paid in relation to one return journey per Parliament working week between one of Parliament’s places of work or a meeting venue and the Members’ place of residence or another point of departure in the Member State of election.\n\nOther travel expenses\n\nMembers are often required to travel within and outside the Member State of election in the performance of their official duties.\n\nFor activities within their Member State of election, travel expenses are reimbursed according to the system for ordinary travel expenses (however, with no distance and duration allowances paid), up to a maximum annual amount of journeys by air or rail, or kilometres travelled based on the size of the country.\n\nFor activities outside their Member State of election, Members may be reimbursed for their travel, accommodation and related expenses up to a maximum annual amount of EUR 5 500, which may be index-linked on a yearly basis.\n\nDaily subsistence allowance\n\nParliament pays a flat-rate allowance of EUR 350 per day (in 2024), which may be index linked on a yearly basis, to cover all subsistence expenses incurred by Members during parliamentary activity periods, on condition that they prove their attendance by signing one of the official registers made available for that purpose.\n\nIf a Member does not take part in at least half of the roll-call votes on voting days in plenary the allowance is halved, even if the Member is present. In the case of meetings organised outside the European Union, the daily subsistence allowance is EUR 175 (likewise subject to the signing of a register), with accommodation expenses being reimbursed separately.\n\nStaffing arrangements\n\nMembers of the European Parliament are free to choose their own assistants within a budget set by Parliament. The relevant terms and conditions are laid down in Chapter 5 of the Implementing Measures for the Statute for Members.\n\nIn 2024, the maximum amount made available to each Member for all their staff related expenses is EUR 29 557 monthly. Members are not paid this amount but they have it at their disposal to use it for all their staff related expenses, following an authorisation by the relevant Parliament department. This amount is used inter alia to cover the salaries, fees and social security contributions of the parliamentary assistants and service providers that Members employ or make use of.\n\nThere are two categories of assistants:\n\n- Accredited assistants working in Brussels, Luxembourg or Strasbourg are employed directly by Parliament. MEPs may recruit up to four accredited assistants. At least 40% of the parliamentary assistance allowance is earmarked for accredited assistants.\n\n- Local assistants assist Members in the Member State in which they were elected. The contracts for those assistants concluded personally with the Member are managed by paying agents who guarantee compliance with the relevant national and European laws. Local assistants can have either an employment contract or a service provider contract.\n\nMembers may also make use of natural or legal persons (e.g. companies) who provide them with specialised and clearly identified services.\n\nMoreover, traineeships may be offered by Members either at Parliament’s places of work or in the Member State in which the Member is elected.\n\nThe total expenditure relating to local assistants and trainees may not exceed 60% of the parliamentary assistance allowance. Expenditure on service providers, however, may not exceed 20% of the allowance. Paying agents’ fees may not exceed 4 % of the parliamentary assistance allowance.\n\nFor the remuneration of natural persons certain ceilings apply. More information can be found here.\n\nSeveral Members may form a grouping to recruit one or more accredited or local assistants or trainees. They then decide among themselves how to share the costs.\n\nMembers may not employ close relatives as assistants. Their assistants must abstain from any actions that conflict with the interests of the Members they assist or those of Parliament\n\nThe names or corporate names of all assistants are published on Parliament’s website for the duration of their contract, unless they obtain a derogation on duly justified grounds such as the protection of their safety."
