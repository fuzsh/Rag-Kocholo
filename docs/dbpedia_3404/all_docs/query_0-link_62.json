Educational Requirements for Admission\n\n(a) Undergraduate Education. Every applicant for admission to the bar must furnish satisfactory proof that the applicant successfully completed at least three (3) years of work required for a bachelor's degree in an accredited college before beginning the study of law, or that the applicant received an equivalent education. An applicant who has not successfully completed at least three (3) years of work required for a bachelor's degree in an accredited college shall have the burden of proving educational equivalency. In addition to filing the petition and questionnaire for admission, any such applicant must submit information sufficient for the board to determine that the requirements of this paragraph have been met.\n\n(b) Law School Education. Except as provided in Rule 42(XI)(b), every applicant must have graduated from a law school approved by the American Bar Association having a three year course and requiring students to devote substantially all their working time to study, called a full-time law school, or from a law school approved by the American Bar Association having a course of not less than four school years equivalent in the number of working hours to a three year course in a full-time law school and in which students devote only part of their working time to their studies, called a part-time law school. A combination of study in full-time and part-time law schools will be accepted only if such law schools meet the above requirements, and the applicant has graduated from one of the law schools.\n\n(c) Foreign Law School Graduate. Notwithstanding the foregoing paragraph, an applicant who has graduated from a law school in a foreign country and who is a member in good standing of the bar of that country or a member of the bar of one of the States of the United States who was admitted after examination and is in good standing, may qualify to sit for the New Hampshire Bar Examination or may apply for admission upon motion by providing to the board satisfactory proof of his or her educational sufficiency. Any person who seeks admission to practice law in the State of New Hampshire who is a graduate of a law school in a foreign country shall have the burden of proving that the requirements of this section have been met. In addition to filing the petition and questionnaire for admission, any foreign law school graduate seeking admission must file an affidavit, signed under oath, attesting that the requirements of this section have been met, and submitting information sufficient for the board to determine that the requirements have been met. To prove educational sufficiency, an applicant must prove:\n\n(1) that he or she successfully completed a period of law study in a law school or law schools each of which, throughout the period of the applicant's study therein, was recognized by the competent accrediting agency of the government of such other country, or a political subdivision thereof, as qualified and approved (distance study, correspondence study and on-line programs are not acceptable); and\n\n(2) that such other country is one whose jurisprudence is based upon the principles of English Common law; and\n\n(3) that the program and course of law study successfully completed by the applicant were substantially equivalent in substance to the legal education provided by a law school accredited by the American Bar Association. An applicant will be deemed to have a legal education equivalent in substance to that provided by law schools accredited by the American Bar Association if the applicant successfully completed, at a law school accredited by the American Bar Association, at least 24 semester credit hours of coursework dealing with either the law of the United States or the law of one of the States of the United States, including a course in basic constitutional law and professional responsibility. Distance study, correspondence study and on-line programs are not acceptable. At least sixteen (16) of the semester credit hours must have been from among at least five of the following categories:\n\n(A) Evidence\n\n(B) Taxation\n\n(C) Civil or Criminal Procedure\n\n(D) Contracts\n\n(E) Decedents' Estates\n\n(F) Real Property\n\n(G) Corporations or business organizations\n\n(H) Torts\n\n(I) Criminal Law\n\n(4) If the applicant has met the requirements of paragraphs (1) and (2), but the applicant's program and course of law study do not meet the requirements of paragraph (3), the board may nevertheless determine that the applicant has proved educational sufficiency based upon the board's consideration of the following factors:\n\n(A) The course of study that was completed as compared to that offered in a law school approved by the American Bar Association;\n\n(B) The attorney's pre-legal education as compared to that offered in a U.S. high school and college or university;\n\n(C) The length and nature of prior legal practice or teaching, if any;\n\n(D) The applicant's familiarity with the American constitutional, common-law and statutory legal systems;\n\n(E) The applicant's successful completion of additional legal studies.\n\nVI. Proof of Character and Fitness\n\n(a) Any person who applies for admission to the bar shall be required to establish his or her moral character and fitness to the satisfaction of the committee and the court before admission to the bar. In determining the moral character and fitness of applicants, the committee shall consider the Character and Fitness Standards set forth in New Hampshire Supreme Court Rule 42B.\n\n(b) Any person who seeks admission to the bar shall at all times have the burden of proving his or her good moral character to the committee and the court. The failure of an applicant to answer any question on the petition and questionnaire for admission, or any question propounded by any member of the committee, a designee of the committee, or by the staff of the Office of Bar Admissions, or to supply any documentary material requested by any of them, shall justify a finding that the applicant has not met the burden of proving good moral character.\n\n(c) Any person who seeks admission to the practice of law shall file with the committee the prescribed petition and questionnaire for admission, which shall contain a certificate signed by two persons certifying the applicant's good moral character. The petition and questionnaire for admission shall be executed by the applicant under oath.\n\n(d) Upon receiving the petition and questionnaire for admission, the committee shall promptly: (1) review the facts stated in the petition, communicate with the references, and make such further investigation as it may deem desirable or necessary; (2) if it deems necessary, arrange for a personal interview with the applicant; (3) consider the character and fitness of the applicant to be admitted to the practice of law; and (4) transmit to the supreme court a report of its investigation and its recommendation in regard to the character and fitness of the applicant for admission to the practice of law.\n\n(e) If the recommendation of the committee is in favor of admission, the court may accept the recommendation and grant the application for admission or decline to accept the recommendation. If the court determines that the recommendation of the committee should not be accepted, it shall either remand the matter to the committee for further investigation and consideration or refer the matter to a referee for an evidentiary hearing during which the applicant shall have the burden of proving his or her good moral character and fitness. If the recommendation of the committee is against admission, the report of the committee shall set forth the facts upon which the adverse recommendation is based and its reasons for rendering an adverse recommendation. The committee shall promptly notify the applicant about the adverse recommendation and shall give the applicant an opportunity to appear at a hearing before it and to be fully informed of the matters reported to the court by the committee, and to answer or explain such matters. Testimony at such hearings shall be given under oath and shall be recorded. Counsel for the committee, counsel for the applicant, and the office of bar admissions general counsel, may issue subpoenas and subpoenas duces tecum to summon witnesses with or without documents for attendance at hearings. Upon the request of an applicant who is not represented by counsel, counsel for the committee, or the office of bar admissions general counsel, may issue such subpoenas to summon witnesses.\n\n(f) If, following an applicant’s appearance before it, the committee is still of the opinion that an adverse report should be made on the application, it shall first give the applicant the privilege of withdrawing the application. If the applicant elects not to withdraw the application, and the second report and recommendation of the committee to the court is against approval of the application, the court, upon receipt of the report with the adverse recommendation by the committee, may grant the application or shall require the applicant to show cause why the application should not be denied.\n\nVII. Bar Examination\n\n(a) The New Hampshire bar examination shall be the Uniform Bar Examination prepared by the National Conference of Bar Examiners. It shall be administered at a time and place determined by the board on the last Wednesday of February and the preceding day, and the last Wednesday of July and the preceding day.\n\n(b) The board’s determination of an applicant’s score on the bar examination is final and is not subject to review.\n\n(c) If an applicant is aggrieved by a final decision of the board, or a subcommittee thereof, with respect to an issue arising from the applicant’s conduct during, or related to, the bar examination, the applicant may seek review of the board or subcommittee’s final decision by the supreme court by filing with the supreme court a petition for review within 20 days of the mailing of the notice of final decision. The applicant shall follow the procedures set forth in Supreme Court Rule 42 (IV)(c).\n\nVIII. Application to take Bar Examination\n\n(a) A person seeking to take the bar examination shall file with the board an application to take the New Hampshire bar examination and a completed petition and questionnaire for admission by the deadlines established by the board. The application and petition and questionnaire for admission must be accompanied by the bar examination application fee which shall be paid to the State of New Hampshire. The fee shall be nonrefundable.\n\n(b) If an applicant to take the bar examination notifies the board at least thirty days before the date of the bar examination that he or she will not take the bar examination for which he or she applied, and wishes to take the immediately subsequent administration of the bar examination, the applicant shall be required to pay an administrative fee in an amount set by the board, but shall not be required to pay an additional bar examination application fee or submit a new application. The applicant is also required to notify the board in writing on or before the application deadline for the subsequent examination of any changes to the applicant’s petition and questionnaire for admission.\n\n(c) A person who has failed the New Hampshire bar examination four times will not be permitted to retake the examination. For purposes of Rule 42, attempts to pass the examination shall count toward the limit of four regardless of whether the examination was taken in New Hampshire or taken in another jurisdiction administering the Uniform Bar Examination prepared and coordinated by the National Conference of Bar Examiners.\n\nIX. Bar Examination Testing Accommodation\n\n(a) In accordance with the testing accommodation policy most recently approved by the court, an applicant whose disability requires testing accommodations shall submit a written request to the board at the time that the applicant files the application and petition and questionnaire for admission. No request for testing accommodations shall be accepted if received after the application deadline for the July or February examination as established by the board. The written request shall describe:\n\n(1) the type of accommodation requested; and\n\n(2) the reasons for the requested accommodation, including medical documentation in a format set forth in the testing accommodation policy.\n\n(b) The request for accommodation shall be ruled on in the first instance by the chair of the board or his or her designee, and the applicant shall be notified of the decision. A denial or modification of a request for testing accommodations by the chair or his or her designee may be appealed to the board of bar examiners, or a subcommittee thereof, in accordance with procedures established by the board. The board or subcommittee’s decision on appeal constitutes a final decision of the board. The applicant may seek review of the board or subcommittee’s final decision by the supreme court by filing with the supreme court a petition for review within 20 days of the mailing of the notice of final decision. The applicant shall follow the procedures set forth in Supreme Court Rule 42(IV)(c).\n\nX. Admission by Transferred Uniform Bar Examination Score\n\n(a) An applicant who meets the Eligibility Requirements set forth in paragraphs 42 (IV)(a), (V), and (VI), and the following additional requirements may, upon motion to the board, be admitted by transferred UBE score. The applicant shall:\n\n(1) Have earned a UBE score that meets or exceeds the minimum score required by the board on the date that the motion is filed; and\n\n(2) Have either:\n\n(A) earned the UBE score in an administration of the UBE which occurred within three years immediately preceding the date on which the motion for admission by transferred UBE score was filed; or\n\n(B) earned the UBE score more than three years but less than five years prior to the date of filing of the motion for admission by transferred UBE score, and establish that he or she has been primarily engaged in the active practice of law, as defined by Rule 42 (XI)(d), for at least two years in another state, territory, or the District of Columbia in which the applicant was a member in good standing and authorized to practice law throughout the entire two-year period.\n\n(b) To qualify for admission under this Rule 42 (X), the applicant must have earned the minimum score required by the board within no more than four attempts on the UBE. For purposes of this rule, attempts to earn the minimum score are counted regardless of whether the applicant tested in New Hampshire or in another jurisdiction administering the UBE.\n\n(c) A person seeking admission by transferred UBE score shall file with the board the required motion form, a completed petition, and supporting documents, in accordance with procedures established by the board, accompanied by the motion fee, which shall be paid to the board. The fee shall be nonrefundable, provided, however, that if a motion for admission by transferred UBE score is denied prior to the commencement of the character and fitness investigation by the committee, then one-half of the character and fitness investigation fee shall be refunded.\n\nXI. Admission by Motion Without Examination\n\n(a) Applicant from Reciprocal Jurisdiction.\n\n(1) An applicant who meets the Eligibility Requirements set forth in Rule 42(IV)(a), (V), and (VI), and the following additional requirements may, upon motion to the board, be admitted to the bar without examination.

Practical Skills Course Requirement\n\n(a) Within two years of admission, each person admitted to practice law in New Hampshire must attend a practical skills course presented by the New Hampshire Bar Association, unless the admittee satisfies the requirements of paragraph (b) or, in exceptional instances, a longer period is approved in writing by the court. This requirement shall not apply to inactive members; however, should such member apply for active status, this course must be taken within one year of the member’s return to active status. A failure to comply with the requirements of this rule will result in the suspension of the attorney’s license. The course will assist new admittees in developing basic lawyering skills and in gaining practical knowledge of New Hampshire practice and procedures. Attendance is required and each new admittee will be required to execute an affidavit stating that he or she has attended each session of the course unless otherwise excused by the supreme court, but no test will be required.\n\n(b) If a new admittee leaves New Hampshire on military or other government service assignment for more than a brief period within two years after being admitted to the bar and before completing the practical skills course, the new admittee’s license shall not be suspended if he or she promptly so notifies the court in writing of his or her departure from the state and his or her intention to complete the course at a later date. Such a new admittee shall be required to attend a practical skills course given within three years of the date of departure, and further provided that, if he or she shall have completed the assignment and returned to New Hampshire within the three-year period, the course taken shall be the first available course given after his or her return. The admittee shall notify the court promptly of his or her return within the three-year period. Upon written request in exceptional instances, the court may extend the three-year period following the date of departure within which the admittee must attend a practical skills course.\n\n(c) Attendance at the practical skills course means, for all new admittees, personal attendance at all sessions of the course.\n\n(d) Exemptions from the practical skills course requirements, or any portion thereof, shall be granted only upon written application filed with the court, setting forth the exceptional circumstances believed to justify the requested exemption.\n\n(e) Reinstatement of a license suspended under this paragraph shall be only by order, upon petition to the court following completion of the practical skills course, and upon such conditions as the court deems appropriate. If the petition to this court is filed more than one year after the date of the order suspending the person from the practice of law in this State, then the petition shall be accompanied by evidence of continuing competence and learning in the law, and evidence of continuing moral character and fitness. If the evidence of continuing competence and learning in the law, and evidence of continuing moral character and fitness, are satisfactory to the court, the court may order reinstatement upon such conditions as it deems appropriate.\n\nIf the evidence of continuing competence and learning in the law is not satisfactory to the court, the court shall refer the motion for reinstatement to the board. A subcommittee of the board shall promptly schedule a hearing at which the attorney shall have the burden of demonstrating by a preponderance of the evidence that he or she has the competence and learning in law required for reinstatement. At the conclusion of the hearing, the subcommittee shall promptly file with the court the record and a report containing its findings and recommendations. The court shall consider the matter in the normal course and following the submission of briefs, if found necessary by the court, and any oral argument ordered by the court, shall enter a final order.\n\nIf the evidence of continuing moral character and fitness is not satisfactory to the court, the court shall order the applicant to file with the board and with the clerk of the supreme court the petition and questionnaire for admission referred to in Supreme Court Rule 42(VI)(c). Further proceedings shall be governed by Rule 42(VI).\n\nXIV. Duty to Update Information\n\nAn applicant for admission to the New Hampshire bar has a continuing obligation to update any information submitted as a part of the application process by providing the new information in writing to the Office of Bar Admissions. The duty to update information exists during the entire pendency of the application or motion for admission. All persons admitted to the bar have a continuing obligation to notify the New Hampshire Bar Association immediately and in writing of all changes of residence address and address of principal office.\n\nXV. Immunity\n\n(a) The board members, committee members, the administrator of the office of bar admissions, and their staff, counsel, investigators, proctors, agents, and members of any hearing panels, in performing their duties under this rule, are regarded as acting as officers of the court and shall be immune from civil liability for any conduct arising out of the performance of their duties.\n\n(b) A person shall be immune from civil liability for all of his or her statements made in good faith to the board, committee, office of bar admissions, office of the attorney general, or the court, given in any investigation or proceedings pertaining to an application for admission. The protection of this immunity does not apply to statements made to others."
