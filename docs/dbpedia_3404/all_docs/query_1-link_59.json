        "text": "Permanent staff are members of the EU civil service appointed for an indefinite time. They constitute the core working force.\n\nThere are three categories for permanent EU officials: Administrators (AD), Assistants (AST) and Secretaries/Clerks (AST/SC).\n\nAdministrators\n\nAdministrators work in a variety of sectors such as justice, law, finance, environment and climate change, foreign affairs, agriculture, economics, IT, communication, human resources, science, translation and interpretation.\n\nDuties include developing policies and legislation; conducting analysis and advisory work; carrying out regulatory tasks; taking part in international negotiations; liaising with stakeholders and partners; engaging with citizens; revising and translating EU legal texts, among many others.\n\nAn administrator career ranges from grades AD 5 to AD 16, with AD 5 being the entry-level grade for university graduates; grades AD 15 and AD 16 are reserved for Director Generals.\n\nSelection and recruitment are also possible at higher grades AD 6 or AD 7 for specialist profiles. In this case, candidates will be expected to have several years’ relevant educational background and work experience will be required for most profiles.\n\nGrades AD 9 to AD 12 are required for middle management posts. Previous management experience is mandatory for selection and recruitment at these higher grades.\n\nAssistants\n\nAssistants are typically engaged in an executive or technical role, providing support in a variety of fields such as finance, communication, administration, research, IT or policy implementation, to name but a few.\n\nAn assistant career ranges from grades AST 1 to AST 11, with staff typically entering at grades AST 1 or AST 3.\n\nSecretaries/Clerks – Support staff\n\nSecretaries and clerks are generally involved in office management and in providing administrative and technical support. Their duties include finalising documents and files; supporting the unit’s or department’s activities (meetings, official travel, diary); compiling and disseminating information (updating databases, files); performing manual tasks.\n\nA secretary/clerk career ranges from grade AST/SC 1 to AST/SC 6. New staff usually enters at grades AST/SC 1 or AST/SC 2.\n\nLearn more details on this salary table (applicable from 1 January 2024).\n\nFind out more about selection procedures and available job opportunities for permanent staff.\n\nIt is possible to work for the EU on a fixed-term contract basis.\n\nContract agents (or staff) carry out a number of manual or administrative tasks and may provide additional capacity in specialised fields where an insufficient number of officials is available.\n\nThey are generally recruited for fixed-term contracts (maximum 6 years in any EU Institution), but in some cases they can be offered contracts for an indefinite duration (in offices, agencies, delegations or representations).\n\nContract staff is recruited in two different ways: via the CAST Permanent procedure or via an ad hoc selection process.\n\nIn the first type of selection, the word CAST stands for Contract Agents Selection Tool while Permanent means that it is open-ended, with no application deadline.\n\nCAST Permanent positions are available for a wide range of job profiles. In this selection, candidates apply for a profile and not for a specific job position.\n\nEU institutions, bodies and agencies can also recruit contract staff to fill specific positions via ad hoc contract staff vacancies. In this case, for each vacancy an application deadline is set.\n\nAs contract staffing needs arise, ad hoc vacancies may be published for a wide range of profiles such as webmasters, policy officers, linguists, project coordinators, security officers, scientific engineering managers, drivers, communication specialists, researchers, to name but a few.\n\nLearn more about application procedures for both CAST Permanent and ad hoc contact staff vacancies on our Selection process page.\n\nIn both CAST Permanent and ad hoc cases, candidates who are successful in obtaining a contract will be employed for a fixed amount of time. In some EU bodies and agencies, contracts could be extended for an indefinite duration.\n\nAll contract staff positions are divided into four function groups (career levels):\n\nLearn more details on this salary table (applicable from 1 January 2024).\n\nFind available job opportunities for contract staff.\n\nTemporary staff is recruited to fill vacant positions within the EU institutions and agencies for a set amount of time; this may range from a few months to a few years.\n\nThey may be asked to perform regulatory, legal, scientific or financial support tasks; conduct policy and data analysis; carry out IT, administrative, research, communication and programming duties, to name but a few.\n\nTemporary staff cover posts requiring different types of qualifications and specialisations, varying from assistant to higher administrator positions.\n\nFor administrator positions, temporary staff can be recruited at grades ranging from entry-level grade AD 5 to AD 6 or higher. Similarly, assistant grades start at AST 1 - AST 3 and can be higher for more specialised profiles.\n\nLearn more details on this salary table (applicable from 1 January 2024).\n\nFind out more about selection procedures and available job opportunities for temporary staff."
