        "text": "Delegates Welcome Steps to Develop More Fair, Efficient, Agile Recruitment System, Help Organization Meet Twenty-First Century Challenges\n\nThe Fifth Committee (Administrative and Budgetary) today wrapped up the first part of its resumed seventy-seventh session by sending the General Assembly one decision and four resolutions, including the first human resources management package in more than six years.\n\nIf approved by the Assembly at its 18 April session, the human resources management resolution would give the Secretary-General long-awaited guidance on developing a more fair, efficient and agile recruitment system that can create a diverse workforce and help the Organization meet twenty-first century challenges.\n\nThe detailed 12-page text asks the Secretary-General for clear and quantifiable targets, benchmarks and timelines that will measure the impact of his plans for diversity, agility and accountability. Noting that the system of desirable ranges is one mechanism with quantifiable targets, the Fifth Committee’s text asks the Assembly to ensure the Secretary-General updates the desirable ranges system in the Secretariat, with effect from 1 January 2024. One element would expand the posts subject to the desirable ranges system to all posts funded by the regular budget at the professional and higher categories, including in special political missions and peacekeeping operations, yet excluding language posts.\n\nAs part of its accelerated efforts to rejuvenate an Organization facing a high level of upcoming retirements, the human resources reform would employ a comprehensive approach to recruit and retain talent — including through the United Nations internship programme, the Junior Professional Officer Programme and the Young Professional Programme. Viewing the internship programme as an integral part of the ongoing reform of the Organization’s human resources system, the Assembly would ask the Secretary-General to develop a transparent, merit-based intern recruitment process that includes outreach mechanisms to attract candidates, particularly from unrepresented and underrepresented Member States.\n\nThe Committee also sent the Assembly a three-part draft resolution on special subjects relating to the 2023 programme budget. Approved by consensus, the text covered issues of air travel; the Organization’s enterprise resource planning project, known as Umoja; and compensation and service conditions for members of the International Court of Justice and the President and judges of the International Residual Mechanism for Criminal Tribunals.\n\nAlso without a vote, the Committee approved a draft resolution that recognized the importance of the Joint Inspection Unit’s oversight function and encouraged the Unit’s efforts to enhance the Organization’s accountability, oversight and governance as a whole. It also moved by consensus on a draft resolution aimed at strengthening the Organization’s accountability, stressing that accountability is a key element of management reform.\n\nLastly, the Committee sent the Assembly a draft decision that would defer consideration of several agenda items — investing in prevention and peacebuilding; capital investment planning; and the information and communications technology strategy — until the second part of its resumed seventy-seventh session.\n\nIn closing remarks, delegates expressed their appreciation for the Committee’s agreement on a human resources resolution after six difficult years. The representative of Saudi Arabia, aligning himself with the “Group of 77” developing countries and China and the Gulf Cooperation Council, said he hoped the Committee’s consensus on human resources will help the Organization represent all countries without distinction, as outlined in Article 101 of the Charter of the United Nations. Saudi youth want to participate more actively in the Organization’s work, and he urged that staff selection be based on unbiased, improved representation that will attract people with the best skills.\n\nThe speaker for the European Union, in its capacity as observer, stressed that the Organization’s people are its most valuable asset and the Committee’s approval of a human resources resolution contains the most significant overhaul of the system of desirable ranges since its inception. The text also addresses a wide array of policies including the recruitment and retention of talents on as wide a geographical basis as possible and strengthened accountability in combatting any form of misconduct. “This is nothing short of historic,” she declared. Yet she expressed regret that the Committee did not reach agreement on supply chain activities and the information and communications technology strategy.\n\nThe representative of the United States said that the comprehensive resolution on human resources management will help rejuvenate the Organization by bringing in new talent, creating a more representative workforce and strengthening protections against misconduct, including sexual harassment. Noting that no side received everything it wanted, he said the failure to make progress on information-technology improvements is short-sighted given the fast pace of technological changes and the Organization’s very real cybersecurity risks. Yet, in reaching an agreement instead of deadlocking as it has done for years, the Committee has reasserted Member States’ active role in United Nations operations.\n\nUganda’s delegate, speaking for the African Group and aligning himself with the Group of 77 and China, pointed out that racism has no place in the Organization, which was founded on the principle of dignity without distinction by race, colour, ethnicity or national origin. He therefore welcomed the appointment of a Special Adviser for addressing racism in the workplace. Expressing disappointment that the Committee was unable to reach consensus on a resolution pertaining to investing in peacebuilding, he said that a proposal agreed upon by several delegations is a comprehensive one. It should serve as a basis to achieve a resolution in upcoming sessions.\n\nPhilippe Kridelka (Belgium), Committee Chair, thanked all Member States for their exceptional energy and diplomatic creativity. He applauded their hard work to reach consensus on several important items and said the progress on the Peacebuilding Fund will be an important part of the Committee’s work during its upcoming session in May.\n\nAlso speaking today were representatives of Cuba (on behalf of the Group of 77 and China), Oman (on behalf of the Gulf Cooperation Council), Japan, United Kingdom and Peru.\n\nChandramouli Ramanathan, Controller, Assistant Secretary-General for Programme Planning, Finance and Budget in the Department of Management Strategy, Policy and Compliance, also made closing remarks about closed peacekeeping missions and the distribution of credits to Member States.\n\nThe Committee will reconvene for the first day of its second resumed session at 10 a.m. on Monday, 1 May.\n\nAppointment to Committee on Contributions\n\nThe Fifth Committee recommended by acclamation the appointment of Minhong Yi (Republic of Korea) from the Group of Asia-Pacific States to fill the vacancy created by the resignation of Ji-sun Jun (Republic of Korea), effective 28 February. If approved by the General Assembly, Mr. Yi will serve until 31 December.\n\nAction on Drafts\n\nThe Fifth Committee first took up and approved the draft resolution titled “Special subjects relating to the programme budget for 2023” (document A/C.5/77/L.30) without a vote. By the terms of Section I of the resolution, titled “Standards of accommodation for air travel”, the General Assembly would take note of the Secretary-General’s report (A/77/629), endorse the conclusions and recommendations contained in the report of the Advisory Committee on Administrative and Budgetary Questions (ACABQ) (document A/77/7/Add.41) and reaffirm that the International Civil Service Commission (ICSC) shall establish standards of travel. It would request the Secretary-General to continue to limit the use of exceptions, strengthen internal controls in this regard and encourage eminent and prominent persons to voluntarily downgrade from their entitled class. All individuals who qualify for first-class or business class United Nations-funded air travel would also be encouraged to voluntarily downgrade. The Secretary-General would be asked to hold managers accountable for the judicious use of travel resources, in particular by increasingly encouraging the use of alternative communication and representation methods.\n\nThe Assembly, reiterating its serious concern at the low compliance with the advance purchase policy directive in all travel categories, would decide that compliance with the advance purchase policy is a prerequisite to undertake any travel above economy class for all staff below the level of Assistant Secretary-General, with exceptions made for delayed travel documents. In noting with concern that the current provider for air travel management services at Headquarters has been in place since 2005 and will expire in October 2023, it would request the Secretary-General to take measures to ensure that the existing process of booking air tickets through the contracted travel agency is cost effective. Further, the Secretary-General would be asked to ensure that the procurement process for all air travel management services contracts is conducted in full compliance with the Organization’s general procurement principles and includes the option of awarding a contract to multiple vendors to allow for greater competition.\n\nConcerning the President of the International Court of Justice and the President of the Assembly, the Assembly would notably decide that both shall not be entitled to first-class accommodation for air travel. For his part, the Secretary-General would be invited to voluntarily downgrade from his entitled class.\n\nBy other terms, the Assembly would ask the Secretary-General to review the lump-sum option for home leave and propose an amount that provides staff an amount equal to actually incurred costs, including options based on the most restrictive economy fare.\n\nThrough section II of the resolution titled “Enterprise resource planning project, Umoja”, the Assembly would take note of the Secretary-General’s report (document A/77/495), his note transmitting the eleventh and final annual progress report of the Board of Auditors (document A/77/135) and the findings of that final report while endorsing its recommendations. It would also endorse the Advisory Committee’s conclusions and recommendations contained within its respective report (document A/77/7/Add.21).\n\nBy the terms of section III titled “Conditions of service and compensation for officials other than Secretariat officials: members of the International Court of Justice and President and judges of the International Residual Mechanism for Criminal Tribunals”, the Assembly would take note of the Secretary-General’s report (document A/77/346), endorse the Advisory Committee’s conclusions and recommendations within its report (document A/77/7/Add.7) and decide to maintain the current pension scheme of judges. It would also request the Chair of the Fifth Committee to solicit a formal legal opinion from the Office of Legal Affairs containing an assessment of legal impediments to the introduction of changes to the pension scheme for judges, particularly those resulting in different pension schemes while judges serve on the Court and those lowering the level of benefits for new judges. The Assembly would additionally request the Sixth Committee (Legal) to consider the legal aspects of this assessment and provide advice for further discussion by the Fifth Committee.\n\nIt next approved the draft resolution titled “Human Resources Management” (document A/C.5/77/L.31) without a vote. By its terms, the Assembly would endorse the conclusions and recommendations contained in the related ACABQ reports and emphasize the crucial role that human resources management reform plays in enhancing the Organization’s efficiency and effectiveness.\n\nNoting the Secretary-General’s proposed plans on reform, the Assembly would ask him to include clearly quantifiable targets, benchmarks and timelines to measure impacts for diversity, agility and accountability outcomes and then adjust his plans accordingly. A report would be presented to the Assembly during the first part of its resumed seventy-ninth session and the Assembly would also ask the Secretary-General to assess his reform efforts and submit a human resources strategy to the Assembly at its eightieth session.\n\nRecognizing the Secretary-General’s intent to ensure an effective, fair, efficient and agile recruitment system that creates a diverse workforce, the Assembly would ask him to provide detailed information on changes to the staff selection process that covers all phases of the recruitment process.\n\nBy further terms, the Secretary-General would ensure the equal treatment of candidates with equivalent educational backgrounds during the recruitment process by fully accounting for the fact that Member States have different education systems and that no education system shall be considered the standard to be applied by the Organization. He would be asked to give equal treatment to internal and external candidates when considering applicants for vacancies and provide in future reports the percentage of internal and external candidates selected. Recalling paragraph 51 of the Advisory Committee’s report, the Assembly would note with serious concern that the 120-day target for recruitment timelines is still not being met and ask the Secretary-General to carry out concrete measures to tackle the root causes of delays and meet the target. The resolution also asks the Secretary-General to keep expanding professional development opportunities for staff, including language training and training in the six official languages, to meet the Organization’s workforce capacity needs.\n\nIn order to build an agile, adaptable and motivated workforce, the Assembly would stress the urgent need to accelerate the mobility process across the Organization, particularly movements between Headquarters and field duty stations. The Assembly would note the Secretary-General’s decision to carry out a new, consolidated approach to staff mobility, starting in 2023, and ask the Secretary-General to report on this new mobility framework’s progress at the first part of its resumed seventy-ninth session. The text emphasizes the importance of periodic updates on the framework’s implementation, including the impact on recruitment trends, contributions to skill development and career progression, and staff experience and satisfaction.\n\nNoting the system of desirable ranges is a mechanism with quantifiable targets, the Assembly would ask the Secretary-General to update the system in the Secretariat, with effect from 1 January 2024, and incorporate several changes. This would include widening the posts subject to the desirable ranges system to all regular budget funded posts at the Professional and higher categories, including in special political missions and peacekeeping operations, excluding language posts. The changes would also include annually updating the calculation of the lower and upper limits of the desirable ranges for all Member States, using the most updated base figure and number of Member States; and review the system every five years. The Assembly would encourage the Secretary-General to work towards bringing each unrepresented and underrepresented Member State within its desirable range by 2030.\n\nNoting the increase in the staff’s average age and the high projected level of retirements, the Assembly would stress the development of an accelerated process to rejuvenate the Organization. This would include a comprehensive approach to recruit and retain talent, including through outreach, the internship programme, the Junior Professional Officer Programme and the Young Professional Programme. It would also plan to increase the number of entry-level Professional posts (P-1 to P-3) while reducing the number of senior-level posts (D-1 and above), through downward job reclassification or abolishment and upcoming retirements, so as not to increase the overall post resource requirements. This approach would be presented to the Assembly during the first part of its resumed seventh-ninth session.\n\nAlso by the text, the Assembly would reaffirm the need to respect the equality of the Secretariat’s two working languages and further reaffirm the use of additional working languages in specific duty stations as mandated.\n\nTurning to efforts to strengthen the management and use of internship programmes in the United Nations system, the text invites executive heads of the United Nations system organizations — under the leadership of the Secretary-General as Chair of the United Nations System Chief Executives Board for Coordination (CEB) — to establish more coherent internship programmes for the United Nations system. The Assembly would urge the Secretary-General to consider the United Nations internship programme as an integral part of ongoing reform of the Organization’s human resources system and request that a comprehensive review of several elements be presented no later than the first part of the resumed seventy-ninth session.\n\nThese elements would include the development of a sustainable internship programme based on an internship strategy and semi-structured training curriculum for interns and efforts to strengthen a transparent, merit-based intern recruitment process and develop outreach mechanisms to attract candidates, particularly from unrepresented and underrepresented Member States. The Assembly would also establish measurable indicators to assess the progress towards an internship programme that is diverse from the perspectives of geographical representation, gender parity and disability, and it would ask the Secretary-General to include assessing whether the restructured internship programme should be administered centrally or remain fully decentralized.\n\nOn the issue of ethics, the text welcomes the Ethics Office’s activities to increase awareness of ethics-related issues for all staff and upgrade its website in the six official languages. The Assembly would request the Secretary-General to propose measures to enhance the Office’s work in the field.\n\nAlso without a vote, the Fifth Committee approved a draft resolution titled “Joint Inspection Unit” (document A/C.5/77/L.29). By its terms, the Assembly - noting with appreciation the Unit’s 2022 report, 2023 programme of work (document A/77/34) and the Secretary-General’s note on the Unit’s 2022 report (document A/77/649) — would stress the importance of the Unit’s oversight functions in identifying concrete managerial, administrative and programming questions within the participating organizations and encourage the Unit to continue its efforts to enhance the Organization’s accountability, oversight and governance as a whole.\n\nIn recognizing the continued need to enhance the Unit’s impact on management efficiency and transparency and that its system-wide effectiveness is a shared responsibility, the Assembly would encourage the Unit, Board of Auditors and the Office of Internal Oversight Services (OIOS) to continue to share experiences, knowledge, best practices and lessons learned with other United Nations audit and oversight bodies, as well as the Independent Audit Advisory Committee, so as to avoid overlap and duplication while achieving further synergy, cooperation, effectiveness and efficiency. It would also note the delay of several reviews including the cumulative impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and delayed responses from organizations subject to reviews.\n\nExpressing its concern that the Unit’s 2023 budget did not fully adhere to established procedures, the Assembly would request the Secretary-General — as Chair of the CEB — to ensure that Assembly decisions on the Unit’s budget are implemented in accordance with established procedures. Budget estimates are to be prepared in a transparent and consistent manner for submission to the Assembly in accordance with article 20 of the Unit’s statute.\n\nAs there are significantly different acceptance and implementation rates of recommendations, including those deemed not relevant by some participating United Nations system organizations, the Assembly would notably request the Unit to examine the status quo with the aim to ensure that future inspections lead to an increase in the number of accepted recommendations without damaging their strength. The Unit would also be strongly encouraged to strengthen the review of its recommendations’ long-term effectiveness and provide an update during the comprehensive midpoint assessment in 2024.\n\nIt next approved by consensus a draft resolution titled “Review of the efficiency of the administrative and financial functioning of the United Nations” (document A/C.5/77/L.32). By its terms, the Assembly would take note of the Secretary-General’s twelfth progress report on strengthening accountability in the United Nations Secretariat (document A/77/692) and endorse the conclusions and recommendations in the Advisory Committee’s eponymous report (document A/77/743). Stressing that accountability is a central principle of management reform, it would request the Secretary-General to continue his efforts to: ensure a strong culture of accountability; strengthen the implementation of results-based management and further increase the use of data and analysis as a strategic tool to inform decision-making; provide information on deliverables and results; identify further possible areas where harmonization in reporting procedures is necessary; and ensure that activities promote cost-efficiency and transparency and are implemented in accordance with the Organization’s legislative framework while maintaining full accountability to the Assembly.\n\nBy other terms, the Assembly would reiterate its request to the Secretary-General to provide in his next progress report an analysis of compliance with the management objectives and performance measures of senior managers’ compacts and take appropriate measures in cases of non-compliance. Senior managers would be urged to meet the geographical targets contained in their compacts.\n\nAs there is a continuing need for a well-functioning system of delegation of authority, the Assembly would ask the Secretary-General to clarify the relationship between Headquarters and field locations the delegation of authority during mission establishment and transition.\n\nOn the “Fraud and Corruption Awareness Handbook”, the Assembly would encourage the Secretary-General to make this resource available in all six official languages where beneficial for external engagement within existing resources. The Secretary-General would be requested to continue to undertake a cultural change in order to ensure a workplace where discrimination, harassment and abuse of authority are not tolerated; perpetrators are held accountable; and staff feel safe to report misconduct.\n\nThe Fifth Committee then turned its attention to the draft decision titled “Questions deferred for future consideration” (document A/C.5/77/L.33). By its terms, the General Assembly would defer until the second part of its resumed seventy-seventh session its agenda items on investing in prevention and peacebuilding; capital investment planning; and information and communications technology strategy.\n\nThe representative of the Russian Federation, noting that his delegation did not have time to read this brief text, asked if the Chair could read aloud “L.33”, which pertains to questions deferred for future consideration.\n\nThe Chair then did so, subsequently asking if the Russian Federation’s delegate was satisfied.\n\nThe representative of the Russian Federation responded in the affirmative.\n\nThe Committee then approved “L.33” without a vote.\n\nPHILIPPE KRIDELKA (Belgium), Committee Chair, then thanked all Member States, particularly the Cuban delegates, at the start of their chairmanship of the “Group of 77” developing countries and China, commending them for their exceptional energy and diplomatic creativity. He applauded their hard work to reach consensus on a number of important items, notably the human resources management package, after 16 hours of negotiation last night, adding that it marked the first time the Committee agreed to give guidance to the Secretariat on human resources after six years. While welcoming the spirit of consensus, creativity and compromise that prevailed, enabling consensus about matters, such as air travel, accountability and the Joint Inspection Unit, among others, he noted that no consensus could be reached on some items, including the Peacebuilding Fund. Noting that he spoke with all regional groups, and found that there was strong political support from groups in all parts of the world to move forward on the Fund, he added that it will be an important part of the Committee’s next session, during which he hoped delegates would demonstrate the same spirit of creativity and compromise.\n\nClosing Remarks\n\nRICHARD TUR DE LA CONCEPCIÓN (Cuba), speaking on behalf of the Group of 77 and China, said he was pleased the Committee was able to reach consensus this year on the important issue of human resources management, after nearly six years without an agreement. He noted the constructive spirit of all Committee colleagues and the trust inspired by the Committee Chair and the facilitators. He acknowledged the Committee’s success in achieving results despite many difficult moments. The resolution on human resources management will provide the Secretary-General with the guidance necessary to help achieve the United Nations goals. He said his delegation stands firm in its dedication and devotion to the Organization and the Fifth Committee.\n\nELEONORE HEIMSOETH, representative of the European Union, in its capacity as observer, stressed that the Organization’s people are its most valuable asset. After six years of unsuccessful attempts, the Fifth Committee finally approved by consensus a resolution which contains the most significant overhaul of the system of desirable ranges since its inception; addresses a wide array of policies including on the attraction, recruitment and retention of talents on as wide a geographical basis as possible; and adopted an ambitious set of new guidelines. It also reiterated the need to focus on gender parity, reinforced the independence of the Ethics Office, consolidated the victims’ rights approach and strengthened accountability in combatting any form of misconduct. “This is nothing short of historic,” she declared.\n\nThe Committee also concluded a number of other agenda items in stark contrast with the outcome of its first resumed session last year, she noted before voicing her regret that no agreement was reached on supply chain activities and the information and communications technology strategy. The key to the best possible outcome lies in the Committee’s ability to uphold transparency in its proceedings. Active engagement, inclusive proceedings and good faith debates make quality discussions and decisions, she underscored.\n\nMEDARD AINOMUHISHA (Uganda), speaking for the African Group and aligning himself with the Group of 77 and China, welcomed the Committee’s adoption of a human resources management resolution after nearly six years. He went on to highlight the issue of racism in the United Nations, reiterating that this has no place in the Organization, which was founded on the principle of dignity without distinction by race, colour, ethnicity or national origin. He therefore welcomed the appointment of a Special Advisor for addressing racism in the workplace. Expressing disappointment that the Committee was unable to reach consensus on a resolution pertaining to investing in peacebuilding, he said that the proposal agreed upon by the African Group, European Union, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, Republic of Korea, United Kingdom, United States, Japan, Switzerland and Norway is a comprehensive one that should serve as a basis for the outcome of such a resolution in upcoming sessions.\n\nMr. AL-SALMI (Oman), speaking on behalf of the Gulf Cooperation Council and aligning himself with the Group of 77 and China, thanked the delegations and experts who participated in the just-concluded negotiations, which have borne fruit, particularly with respect to agenda item 143, on human resources management, following a lengthy negotiation on matters including geographic diversity, mobility and the selection of United Nations staff. The Committee has taken a step in the right direction by ensuring fair representation in the United Nations system.\n\nCHRISTOPHER P. LU (United States) said that the comprehensive resolution on human resources management is a big step forward in making the United Nations fit for purpose to address the challenges of the twenty-first century. With this resolution, the Organization will move forward on a mobility system, be rejuvenated through bringing in new talent, have a more representative workforce and strengthen protections against misconduct, including sexual harassment. The Committee’s actions today will improve processes by increasing transparency and accountability, as well as the performance management system by focusing on outcomes and not outputs, he underscored. No side however got everything that it wanted, he pointed out, noting that the failure to make progress on information-technology improvements is short-sighted given the fast pace of technological changes and the Organization’s very real cybersecurity risks. Yet, in reaching an agreement instead of deadlocking as it has done for years, the Committee has reasserted the authority of Member States to play an active role in United Nations operations, he stressed.\n\nMr. ALMOTAERY (Saudi Arabia), aligning himself with the Group of 77 and China and the Gulf Cooperation Council, said he was pleased with the Committee’s ability to reach consensus on human resources management after six difficult years. He said he hoped this consensus will let the Organization improve its representation in its staff and represent all countries without distinction, as outlined in Article 101 of the Charter of the United Nations. Saudi youth want to participate more actively in the Organization’s work, he said. He urged that the selection of staff be based on unbiased, improved representation that will attract people with the best skills.\n\nFUJINUMA ATSUYUKI (Japan) said his delegation is pleased the Committee was able to adopt a resolution on human resources for the first time in more than six years. This gives the United Nations solid guidance in achieving a more effective, efficient and inclusive Organization. He said his delegation is also content that the Committee found common ground on several important agenda items, especially on accountability, as it has been three years since the Committee provided solid guidance to the Secretariat on this significant matter. On the Peacebuilding Fund, Japan joined the consolidated proposal from many other delegations, as champions and contributors to the peacebuilding efforts.\n\nJAMES STAPLES (United Kingdom), echoing that the Organization’s staff is its greatest asset, pointed out that the Committee was able to give long-overdue guidance to the Secretariat through delegates’ sustained engagement and tireless efforts to bridge gaps and build compromise. There has also been progress elsewhere, including on accountability and peacebuilding financing, he noted, reiterating his Government’s commitment to ensure adequate, predictable and sustainable funding for the Peacebuilding Fund. “In other areas, we were not able to make as much progress as we might have hoped but such is the joy and some may say the sorrow of the Fifth Committee that for most items — including supply chain management, IT and capital investment planning — in various future sessions, we will have the opportunity to discuss again,” he said.\n\nJAVIER SALAS (Peru) underlined the importance of the topics discussed in the Committee, including ethics in the United Nations, cybersecurity, information and communications technology, capital investment, human resources management reform and investment in peacebuilding. On that point, he spotlighted the need for a new peacebuilding fund, which receives both voluntary contributions — like those Peru regularly makes to the current fund — and assessed contributions to finance activities linked to peacebuilding. He added that greater consensus among Member States is needed to establish this new fund, which must be flexible, adaptable, sustainable and predictable to provide financial support in this important area.\n\nCHANDRAMOULI RAMANATHAN, Controller, Assistant Secretary-General for Programme Planning, Finance and Budget in the Department of Management Strategy, Policy and Compliance, said that, through Assembly resolution 76/280, the Fifth Committee was directed to return money from closed peacekeeping missions and distribute credits as of 31 March. He said $81.4 million was due back to troop-contributing countries and 10 of them have asked for payment in cash, and that amount, $29 million, was sent to them today. Six Member States have asked for about $8.6 million to be applied to their other outstanding assessments and he is waiting for instructions from 11 Member States for the remaining $43.8 million. This is the payment of money due to the troop-contributing countries pending for many, many years. In addition, he said $135 million will be returned to all Member States as credits once instructions are received. He pointed out that the cash from the closed peacekeeping missions was a lifeline for regular budget liquidity.\n\nMr. KRIDELKA said the General Assembly will take action on the Fifth Committee’s work on 18 April. The Fifth Committee will hold the first meeting of its second resumed session on 1 May. He then declared the first resumed session closed."
