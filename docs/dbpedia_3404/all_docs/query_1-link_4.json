        "text": "Appellate Courts\n\nThere are two appellate courts in Alaska: the supreme court and the court of appeals. The supreme court was established by the Alaska Constitution, and the court of appeals was created by the Alaska Legislature in 1980.\n\nThe supreme court is the highest level of state court in Alaska. It hears appeals from lower state courts and also administers the state's judicial system.\n\nThe court of appeals has the authority to hear appeals in cases involving criminal prosecution, post-conviction relief, juvenile delinquency, extradition, habeas corpus, probation and parole, bail, and sentencing matters.\n\nThe Appellate Clerk's Office supports the work of the appellate courts. The clerk's responsibilities include monitoring the caseflow through the appellate courts and making recommendations for improvements in appellate procedure. The clerk is also responsible for all case filing and calendaring, publishing opinions and related tasks. The clerk's office is located in Anchorage.\n\nThe Alaska Supreme Court\n\nThe Alaska Supreme Court is the highest level of state court in Alaska. It hears appeals from lower state courts and also administers the stateâs judicial system.\n\nThe Supreme Court includes five justices. The justices, by majority vote, select one of their members to be the chief justice. The chief justice holds that office for three years and may not serve consecutive terms.\n\nThe Supreme Court hears oral argument in cases on a monthly basis in Anchorage, approximately each quarter in Fairbanks and Juneau, and on occasion in other Alaskan communities. The court prefers to hear oral argument in the judicial district where the case was originally heard by the trial court.\n\nThe court meets bi-weekly to confer on cases argued orally and cases submitted on the briefs â that is, without oral argument. The court decides the cases and publishes its decisions in one of three ways â as an Opinion, a Memorandum Opinion, and Judgment (MO&J), or an Order.\n\nOpinions explain in detail the legal reasoning supporting the decision and are published in the official Pacific Reporter and Alaska Reporter.\n\nMemorandum Opinions and Judgments (MO&Js) also explain the legal reasoning but are not published in the official reporters.\n\nOrders rule summarily on the merits of cases or dismiss them, include little or no legal reasoning, and are not published in the official reporters.\n\nAlthough MO&Js and most Orders are not published, they are available for public inspection at the office of the clerk of the appellate courts. Current MO&Js are also available on the Alaska Court System website and through some subscription legal research services.\n\nUnder the state constitution, the Supreme Court establishes rules for the administration of all courts in the state, and for practice and procedure in civil and criminal cases. The Supreme Court also adopts rules for the practice of law in Alaska. The legislature may change the courtâs procedural rules by passing an act expressing its intent to do so by a two-thirds majority of both houses.\n\nSupreme Court Jurisdiction\n\nThe term \"jurisdiction\" means a courtâs legal power and authority to hear particular types of cases. The Supreme Court has final state appellate jurisdiction in civil and criminal matters as follows:\n\nAppeals. The Supreme Court must accept appeals from final decisions by the Superior Court in civil cases (including cases which originated in administrative agencies).\n\nDiscretionary Matters. The Supreme Court may exercise its discretion to accept:\n\nPetitions for Hearing of final appellate decisions of the Court of Appeals (criminal) or Superior Court (civil);\n\nPetitions for Review of non-final orders by the Court of Appeals in criminal cases and the Superior Court in civil cases; and\n\nOriginal Applications in matters for which relief is not otherwise available, including bar admission and attorney discipline matters and questions of state law certified from the federal courts.\n\nAlaska Court System Structure and Flow of Civil and Criminal Appeals\n\nJustices of the Alaska Supreme Court Justice Term Buell Nesbett August 1959 - March 1970 John H.

Henderson July 2021 - Jude Pate March 2023 -\n\nMeet Alaska's Judges\n\nThe Court of Appeals\n\nThe Court of Appeals is a four-judge court consisting of a chief judge and three associate judges. The Court of Appeals was created in 1980 by the Alaska Legislature. The chief judge of the Court of Appeals is appointed by the chief justice to serve a two-year term.\n\nCourt of Appeals Jurisdiction\n\nThe Court of Appeals has jurisdiction to hear appeals in cases involving criminal prosecutions, post-conviction relief, juvenile delinquency, extradition, habeas corpus, probation and parole, bail, and the excessiveness or leniency of a sentence, as follows:\n\nAppeals. The Court of Appeals must accept appeals from final decisions by the Superior Court or the District Court in criminal cases. These include merit appeals (issues concerning the merits of a conviction) and sentence appeals (issues concerning the excessiveness or leniency of a sentence).\n\nDiscretionary Matters. The Court of Appeals may exercise its discretion to accept:\n\nPetitions for Review of non-final orders from the Superior Court or the District Court;\n\nPetitions for Hearing of final appellate decisions of the Superior Court on review of the District Courtâs decisions; and\n\nOriginal Applications in matters for which relief cannot be obtained from the court through one of the above procedures.\n\nAlaska Court System Structure and Flow of Civil and Criminal Appeals\n\nMeet Alaska's Judges\n\nThe Clerk of the Appellate Courts\n\nThe clerk of the appellate courts supports the work of the Supreme Court and the Court of Appeals. The clerk is required to be an attorney. The clerkâs responsibilities include monitoring the caseflow through the Supreme Court and the Court of Appeals and making recommendations for improvements in appellate procedure. The clerk is also responsible for all case filing and calendaring, publishing opinions and related tasks. The clerkâs office is located in Anchorage.\n\nMeredith Montgomery was appointed Clerk of the Appellate Courts in January 2019.\n\nTrial Courts\n\nTrial courts hear court cases when they are first initiated, and render decisions on the law and facts of cases that fall within their jurisdiction. The two levels of trial court in the Alaska Court System are the Superior Court and the District Court.\n\nThe trial courts in Alaska are divided into four judicial districts, whose boundaries are defined by statute. In January of each year, the chief justice of the Supreme Court designates a Superior Court judge from each of Alaskaâs four judicial districts to serve as presiding judge for a term of one calendar year. The presiding judge, in addition to regular judicial duties, is responsible for the administration of the trial courts within the district, including assignment of cases, supervision of court personnel, efficient handling of court business and appointment of magistrate judges. Assisting the presiding judge with administrative responsibilities for each judicial district are the area court administrators.\n\nSuperior Court\n\nThe Superior Court is the trial court of general jurisdiction. There are 45 Superior Court judges located throughout the state. The Superior Court has the authority to hear all cases, both civil and criminal, properly brought before the state courts, with the very limited exception of matters taken directly to the Supreme Court. However, the Superior Court does not routinely hear cases that may be brought in the District Court, a court of limited jurisdiction.\n\nSuperior Court Jurisdiction\n\nThe Superior Court:\n\nis a trial court for both criminal and civil cases;\n\nserves as an appellate court for appeals from civil and criminal cases which have been tried in the District Court;\n\nhears cases involving children who have committed crimes (juvenile delinquency) or who are abused or neglected (child in need of aid);\n\nhears cases involving the property of deceased or incompetent persons;\n\nhears cases involving involuntary commitment of persons to institutions for the mentally ill;\n\nhandles domestic relations matters; and\n\nhandles guardianships and conservatorships.\n\nAlaska Court System Structure and Flow of Civil and Criminal Appeals\n\nDistrict Court\n\nThe District Court is a trial court of limited jurisdiction. Its powers are narrower than those of the Superior Court. At the time of Statehood in 1959, the Alaska legislature created a District Court for each judicial district and granted the Supreme Court the authority to increase or decrease the number of District Court judges within each judicial district. There are currently 20 District Court judges serving in three of the four judicial districts.\n\nMagistrate judges are judicial officers of the District Court whose authority is more limited than the authority of a District Court judge. They preside over certain types of cases in areas of the state where services of a full-time District Court judge are not required. Some magistrate judges serve more than one court location. Magistrate judges also serve in metropolitan areas to handle routine matters and ease the workload of the District Court judges. A magistrate judge is not required to be a lawyer.\n\nDistrict Court Judge Jurisdiction\n\nA District Court judge may:\n\nhear state misdemeanors and minor offenses and violations of city and borough ordinances;\n\nissue summonses, arrest warrants and search warrants;\n\nhear first appearances and preliminary hearings in felony cases;\n\nhear civil cases involving claims not to exceed a value of $100,000 per defendant;\n\nhear small claims cases ($10,000 maximum for most cases; $20,000 for wage claims brought by the Department of Labor);\n\nhandle cases involving children on an emergency basis;\n\nhear domestic violence cases; and\n\nhear inquests and presumptive death hearings.\n\nMagistrate Judge Jurisdiction\n\nA magistrate judge may:\n\nhear trials of municipal ordinance violations, state traffic infractions and other minor offenses;\n\nhold trials and enter judgments in state misdemeanors if a defendant agrees in writing to be tried by a magistrate judge;\n\nissue summonses, arrest warrants and search warrants;\n\npreside over preliminary hearings in felony cases;\n\nhear formal civil cases ($10,000 maximum);\n\nhear small claims cases ($10,000 maximum for most cases; $20,000 for wage claims brought by the Department of Labor);\n\nhandle cases involving children on an emergency basis;\n\nhear domestic violence cases;\n\nhear inquest and presumptive death hearings;\n\nissue writs of habeas corpus (challenges to the legality of a personâs confinement);\n\nsolemnize marriages and perform notary public duties;\n\nact as a hearing officer to review an administrative revocation of a driverâs license;\n\nenter a judgment of conviction if a defendant pleads guilty or no contest to any state misdemeanor; and\n\nconduct extradition (fugitive from justice) proceedings.\n\nAlaska Court System Structure and Flow of Civil and Criminal Appeals\n\nStatewide Court Administration\n\nAs provided by Article IV, section 16 of the Constitution of Alaska, the Alaska Supreme Court appoints an administrative director to supervise the administrative operations of the judicial system. Stacey Marz has been the administrative director since November, 2019. Ms. Marz is assisted by employees in the administrative office of the court who have statewide responsibilities regarding human resources, fiscal operations, information management, facilities, and special projects.\n\nThe specific responsibilities of the administrative director and the administrative office are outlined in Rule 1 of the Alaska Court System Rules of Administration. These include supervising the administrative operations of the court and advising the chief justice and the Supreme Court in all matters not adjudicatory in nature. Sections within the administrative office include:\n\nAlternative Dispute Resolution Projects Coordination\n\nCommunications\n\nCourt Forms\n\nCourt Rules\n\nEducation of Judicial Officers and Clerks of Court\n\nFacilities\n\nFiscal Operations (including Accounting, Supply, Print Shop, Micrographics and Procurement)\n\nHuman Resources\n\nInformation System (Technology)\n\nLanguage Access\n\nLaw Libraries\n\nLegal and Legislative Liaison Services\n\nSelf-Help Services\n\nOther Justice System Participants"
