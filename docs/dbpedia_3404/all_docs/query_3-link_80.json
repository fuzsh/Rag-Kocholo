        "text": "Join the movement.\n\nWhen you join the United States Tennis Association (USTA), you become part of something big. We believe in the power of tennis, the way it can inspire wellbeing and strengthen communities with every bounce of a ball and swish of a racquet. Whether you’re looking for a full-time role or something to fill your free time, there are plenty of ways to get involved—tennis fan or not (yet).\n\nVolunteers are at the very heart of what the USTA does as an association. In fact, the USTA was founded in 1881 by a group of enthusiastic volunteers and our current president and board of directors are all volunteers.\n\nAs such, there are plenty of opportunities to get involved with tennis at the volunteer level. Community Tennis Associations and the National Junior Tennis & Learning network are great places to start, as is the USTA Junior Team Tennis program.\n\nHere are a few other quick links to get you in on the action and giving back to the game you love:\n\nTo volunteer at the local level, contact your section or district.\n\nWant to volunteer to serve on a national committee? Learn more\n\nAnd if you’re a provider or organizer looking to find tennis volunteers near you, consider using an external site like Volunteer Match\n\nWhether you are a tennis player or supporter, there is a way you can serve our sport for a lifetime. Get started today and find yourself in the game."
