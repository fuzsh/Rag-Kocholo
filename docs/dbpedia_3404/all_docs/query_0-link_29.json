A bill or resolve so ordered to a third reading shall be immediately referred to the committee on Bills in the Third Reading and, upon being released by said committee, it shall be read a third time and shall then be open to amendments, the main question being on passing the bill or resolve to be engrossed.\n\nExcept for consolidated amendments or perfecting amendments offered by the committee on Ways and Means, no proposition on a subject different from the amendment under consideration shall be admitted under color of a further amendment to any bill or resolve.

If, upon the taking of such a vote, the presence of a quorum is doubted, a count of the House shall be had, and if a quorum is present the vote shall stand. [67.]\n\n52. The sense of the House shall be taken by yeas and nays whenever required by ten percent of the members elected. The Speaker shall, after waiting up to an interval of twelve minutes, state the pending question and, after opening the electronic voting system, instruct the members to vote for not less than two minutes and no more than twenty-two minutes, the Speaker shall close said system and cause totals to be displayed and a record made of how each member present voted; provided, that if at any time during said voting period any standing, joint or conference committee is meeting in public or executive sessions, the Speaker shall leave the electronic voting machine open for not less than 5 minutes.\n\nAny member desiring to be recorded as being \"present\" when a yea and nay vote is taken on the electronic roll call system shall so notify the Clerk in person after said vote is ordered and before the vote is announced.\n\nIn the event the electronic voting system is not in operating order, the roll of the House shall be called in alphabetical order; provided, however, that no member shall be allowed to vote or to answer \"present\" who was not on the floor before the vote is declared; provided, however, that a member, who was in the State House on a previous roll call, may be recorded by reporting to the Clerk within five minutes after such vote is closed, unless objection is made thereto and it is seconded; and provided further that the presiding officer shall not, for said purpose, interrupt the member who is speaking on the floor; provided, however, that such request may be announced to the House subsequent to the five minutes. The Speaker shall not entertain any requests beyond said five-minute period. Once the voting has begun it shall not be interrupted except for the purpose of questioning the validity of a member's vote before the result is announced. Except as heretofore provided, any member who shall vote or attempt to vote for another member or any person not a member who votes or attempts to vote for a member, or any member or other person who willfully tampers with or attempts to impair or destroy in any manner whatsoever the voting equipment used by the House, or change the records thereon shall be punished in such manner as the House determines; and provided further, that such a violation shall be reported to the Ethics Committee. [68.] (56, 57.)\n\nUpon completion of the tally by the Clerk and the announcement of the vote by the Speaker, the results of all roll calls conducted shall be conspicuously posted on the website of the General Court.\n\n[Amended Jan. 12, 1983; Jan. 11, 1985; Jan. 12, 1987; Jan. 9, 1991; Jan. 24, 2001; Jan. 9, 2003; Jan. 26, 2005; Feb. 11, 2009; Jan 20, 2011; Jul. 7, 2021; Feb. 1, 2023.]\n\n53. The call for yeas and nays shall be decided without debate. If the yeas and nays have been ordered before the question is put, the proceedings under Rules 50 and 51 relative to verification of the vote by the voices of the members or by a return of divisions shall be omitted; if not, they may be called for in lieu of a return by divisions when the Speaker's announcement is doubted by a member rising in their place, and, if then ordered, the proceedings under Rules 50 and 51 shall be omitted.
