        "text": "(1) Attorney Discipline in General:\n\nThe attorney discipline system has been established by the supreme court to fulfill its constitutional responsibility to supervise New Hampshire attorneys. The committees constituting the attorney discipline system act independently to investigate and evaluate grievances against attorneys. As set forth in this rule, the decisions of these committees are subject to judicial review by the supreme court. The attorney discipline office is a division within the administrative office of the courts.\n\n(a) Components: The attorney discipline system consists of the following component parts:\n\n(1) professional conduct committee;\n\n(2) hearings committee;\n\n(3) complaint screening committee;\n\n(4) attorney discipline office.\n\n(b) Jurisdiction: Any attorney admitted to practice law in this State, and any attorney specially admitted by a court of this State for a particular proceeding, and any attorney not admitted in this State who practices law or renders or offers to render any legal services in this State, and any non-lawyer representative permitted to represent other persons before the courts of this State pursuant to RSA 311:1, is subject to the disciplinary jurisdiction of this court and the attorney discipline system.\n\nNothing herein contained shall be construed to deny to any other court such powers as are necessary for that court to maintain control over proceedings conducted before it, such as the power of contempt. Suspension or disbarment of an individual subject to the attorney discipline system shall not terminate jurisdiction of this court.\n\n(c) Grounds for Discipline: The right to practice law in this State is predicated upon the assumption that the holder is fit to be entrusted with professional matters and to aid in the administration of justice as an attorney and as an officer of the court. The conduct of every recipient of that right shall be at all times in conformity with the standards imposed upon members of the bar as conditions for the right to practice law.\n\nActs or omissions by an attorney individually or in concert with any other person or persons which violate the standards of professional responsibility that have been and any that may be from time to time hereafter approved or adopted by this court, shall constitute misconduct and shall be grounds for discipline whether or not the act or omission occurred in the course of an attorney-client relationship.\n\n(d) Priority of Discipline Matters: Matters relating to discipline of an attorney shall take precedence over all other civil cases in this court.\n\n(e) Professional Continuity Committee and New Hampshire Lawyers Assistance Program Exemption: For the purposes of Rule 8.3 of the rules of professional conduct, information received by members of the New Hampshire Bar Association during the course of their work on behalf of the professional continuity committee or the New Hampshire Lawyers Assistance Program which is indicative of a violation of the rules of professional conduct shall be deemed privileged to the same extent allowed by the attorney-client privilege.\n\n(f) Disciplinary matters may be handled by attorneys of the attorney discipline office fulfilling functions of either general counsel or disciplinary counsel, as the general counsel may from time to time assign.\n\n(2) Definitions:\n\n(a) Appeal: \"Appeal\" means an appeal to this court by a respondent or disciplinary counsel of a decision of the professional conduct committee imposing a reprimand, public censure or a suspension of six (6) months or less. An appeal shall not be a mandatory appeal. See Rule 3. An appeal shall be based on the record before the professional conduct committee and shall be limited to issues of errors of law and unsustainable exercises of discretion.\n\n(b) Attorney: Unless otherwise indicated, \"Attorney,\" for purposes of this rule, means any attorney admitted to practice in this State, any attorney specially admitted to practice by a court of this State, any attorney not admitted or specially admitted in this State who provides or offers to provide legal services in this State or any non-lawyer representative permitted to represent other persons before the courts of this State pursuant to RSA 311:1.\n\n(c) Complaint: \"Complaint\" means a grievance that, after initial review, has been determined by the attorney discipline office to be within the jurisdiction of the attorney discipline system and to meet the requirements for docketing as a complaint as set forth in Supreme Court Rule 37A, and that is docketed by the attorney discipline office, or a complaint that is drafted and docketed by the attorney discipline office after an inquiry by that office. If after docketing, the attorney discipline office or the complaint screening committee determines that a complaint is not within the jurisdiction of the attorney discipline system and/or does not meet the requirements for docketing, it shall be removed from the docket and it shall thereafter be treated for all purposes as a grievance that has not been docketed as a complaint.\n\n(d) Disbarment: \"Disbarment\" means the termination of a New Hampshire licensed attorney’s right to practice law in this State and automatic expulsion from membership in the bar of this State. A disbarred attorney may only apply for readmission to the bar of this State upon petition to this court, after having complied with the terms and conditions set forth in the disbarment order promulgated by the court which shall include all requirements applicable to applications for admission to the bar, including passing the bar examination and a favorable report by the professional conduct committee and the character and fitness committee.\n\n(e) Disciplinary Counsel: \"Disciplinary Counsel\" means the attorney or attorneys responsible for the prosecution of disciplinary proceedings before the court, the professional conduct committee and any hearings committee panel. Disciplinary counsel shall include a full-time attorney so designated, such deputy and assistants as may from time to time be deemed necessary, such part-time attorney or attorneys as may from time to time be deemed necessary, and such other attorneys of the attorney discipline office as may from time to time be designated to assist disciplinary counsel.\n\n(f) Grievance: \"Grievance\" means a written submission filed with the attorney discipline office to call to its attention conduct that the grievant believes may constitute misconduct by an attorney. A grievance that is determined, after initial screening, not to be within the jurisdiction of the attorney discipline system and/or not to meet the requirements for docketing as a complaint shall not be docketed and shall continue to be referred to as a grievance. A grievance that is determined, after initial screening, to be within the jurisdiction of the attorney discipline system and to meet the requirements for docketing as a complaint shall be docketed as a complaint and shall be referred to thereafter as a complaint; provided, however, that if the attorney discipline office or the complaint screening committee later determines that the docketed complaint is not within the jurisdiction of the attorney discipline system and/or does not meet the requirements for docketing, it shall be removed from the docket and it shall thereafter be treated for all purposes as a grievance that has not been docketed as a complaint.\n\n(g) Public Censure: \"Public Censure\" means the publication by the court or the professional conduct committee, in appropriate New Hampshire publications including a newspaper of general statewide circulation, and one with general circulation in the area of respondent’s primary office, as well as the New Hampshire Bar News, of a summary of its findings and conclusions relating to the discipline of an attorney, as defined in section (2)(b) of this rule.\n\n(h) Referral: \"Referral\" means a grievance received by the attorney discipline office from any judge or from any member of the bar of New Hampshire, in which the judge or attorney indicates that he or she does not wish to be treated as a grievant.\n\n(i) Reprimand: Reprimand\" means discipline administered by the professional conduct committee after notice of charges and after a hearing before a hearings committee panel and the right to request oral argument to the professional conduct committee, in those cases in which misconduct in violation of the rules of professional conduct is found.

Suspension by the professional conduct committee may not exceed six (6) months.

Any order of suspension entered pursuant to this provision shall be effective immediately.\n\n(b) The term \"serious crime\" shall include any felony and any lesser crime a necessary element of which, as determined by the statutory or common law definition of such crime, involves interference with the administration of justice, false swearing, misrepresentation, fraud, deceit, bribery, extortion, misappropriation, theft, or an attempt or a conspiracy or solicitation of another to commit a \"serious crime.\"\n\n(c) A certified copy of any court record establishing the conviction of an attorney for any \"serious crime\" shall be conclusive evidence of the commission of that crime in any disciplinary proceeding instituted against the attorney based upon the conviction. The certified copy shall constitute evidence sufficient to issue an order of immediate suspension under subparagraph (a) without further hearing.\n\n(d) Upon the receipt of a certificate of conviction of an attorney for a \"serious crime,\" the court may, and shall if suspension has been ordered pursuant to subsection (a) above, institute a formal disciplinary proceeding by issuing an order to the attorney to show cause why the attorney should not be disbarred as a result of the conviction. If the court determines that no such good cause has been shown, the court shall issue an order of disbarment, or such other discipline as the court shall deem appropriate. If the court determines that the attorney has shown cause why disbarment may not be appropriate, the court shall refer the matter to the professional conduct committee, in which the sole issue to be determined shall be the extent of the final discipline to be imposed. Provided, however, that final discipline will not be imposed until all appeals from the conviction are concluded.\n\n(e) Upon receipt of a certificate of conviction of an attorney for a crime not constituting a \"serious crime,\" the court shall refer the matter to the attorney discipline office for such action as it deems appropriate. Referral to the attorney discipline office hereunder does not preclude the court from taking whatever further action it deems appropriate.\n\n(f) An attorney suspended under the provisions of subsection (a) above may be reinstated upon the filing of a certificate demonstrating that the underlying conviction for a serious crime has been reversed but the reinstatement will not terminate any proceeding then pending against the attorney.\n\n(g) Any attorney who has been convicted of a crime in this state or in any other state shall notify the court, in writing, within ten (10) days of sentencing on said conviction. The notice shall inform the court of the crime, the criminal statute violated, the court of conviction, the date of conviction, and the sentence imposed. The clerk of any court within the State in which an attorney is convicted of any crime shall, within ten (10) days of said conviction, transmit a certificate thereof to this court.\n\n(h) Upon being advised that an attorney has been convicted of a crime within this State, the attorney discipline office shall determine whether the clerk of the court where the conviction occurred has forwarded a certificate to this court in accordance with the provisions of subsection (g) above. If the certificate has not been forwarded by the clerk or if the conviction occurred in another jurisdiction, it shall be the responsibility of the attorney discipline office to obtain a certificate of conviction and to transmit it to this court.\n\n(i) Whenever an attorney is indicted or bound over for any felony, the court shall take such actions as it deems necessary, including but not limited to the suspension of the attorney.\n\n(9-A) Proceedings When an Attorney is Alleged to have Engaged in Conduct that Poses a Substantial Threat of Serious Harm.\n\n(a) The attorney discipline office may file a petition for interim suspension or other relief in this court alleging that an attorney has engaged in conduct that poses a substantial threat of serious harm to the public. If the attorney discipline office’s petition alleges that an attorney’s serious misconduct poses an immediate and substantial threat of serious harm to the public or the integrity of the legal profession, the provisions of (9-B), Summary Suspension Procedure, shall apply.\n\n(b) The term “substantial threat of serious harm” encompasses any non-serious crime, conduct, or course of conduct that substantially impairs the attorney’s ability to continue to practice in conformity with the Rules of Professional Conduct and Rule 50, or creates a substantial risk of harm to the public if the attorney is not suspended on an interim basis.\n\n(c) The petition must state with particularity the conduct alleged as well as the bases upon which the interim suspension is necessary to prevent a threat of serious harm to the public. The attorney discipline office shall serve the petition on the attorney by first-class mail, and service shall be deemed complete upon mailing. Service upon the respondent attorney at the latest address provided to the New Hampshire Bar Association shall be deemed to be sufficient. The attorney shall have twenty (20) days from the date of mailing to respond. If the attorney contests the interim suspension, the court will convene a hearing before a judicial referee or a hearing panel of the professional conduct committee. If the attorney consents to the interim suspension, the court may issue an order of interim suspension which will be effective immediately. If the attorney fails to respond to the petition, the allegations of the petition shall be deemed to be admitted, and no hearing shall be required.\n\n(d) The hearing on the petition shall be recorded. The parties shall have thirty (30) days to prepare for the hearing, but no continuance of the hearing shall be granted absent extraordinary circumstances. The attorney discipline office shall have the burden to prove the need for interim suspension by clear and convincing evidence. The referee or panel may consider whether measures short of interim suspension adequately safeguard the public against the threat of substantial harm.\n\n(e) After the hearing, the referee or panel shall issue a recommendation with regard to the need for interim suspension within ten (10) days, and shall forward that recommendation, with the record of the hearing, to the court. The court shall review the recommendation and the record. It may enter an order of interim suspension, dismiss the petition for interim suspension, issue an order directing the attorney to abide by specific conditions in lieu of interim suspension, or remand the matter for further proceedings. Any order issued by the court shall be effective immediately, and shall remain in effect unless it is modified by the court, or it is superseded by an order stemming from disciplinary proceedings arising out of the same or related conduct.\n\n(9-B) Summary Suspension Procedure.\n\n(a) The Summary Suspension Procedure shall apply to cases in which the attorney discipline office alleges that a lawyer has:\n\n(1) engaged in serious misconduct which poses an immediate and substantial threat of serious harm to the public or the integrity of the legal profession; or\n\n(2) failed to comply with a subpoena validly issued under Rule 37(8), or failed to respond to requests for information from the attorney discipline office made in the course of investigating a docketed matter.\n\n(b) “Serious misconduct,” for purposes of this Rule, is any misconduct involving (1) mishandling or misappropriation of client or third party property or funds or (2) any other misconduct which by itself could result in a suspension or disbarment.\n\n(c) The attorney discipline office may file a petition for summary suspension with this court, with copies to the subject attorney, which sets forth with specificity the violation of this section. The petition must state with particularity the conduct alleged as well as the bases upon which the summary suspension is necessary to prevent an immediate and substantial threat of serious harm to the public or the integrity of the legal profession. When the petition for summary suspension is based upon a lawyer’s failure to respond pursuant to Rule 37(9-B)(a)(2), the petition shall be supported by an affidavit of the attorney discipline office affirming the facts set forth in subsection (d). Upon such filing, this court may enter an order of summary suspension and may order such emergency relief as this court deems necessary to protect the public or the integrity of the legal profession.\n\n(d) The affidavit in support of the petition for summary suspension shall affirm:\n\n(1) that the lawyer was served with the subpoena or was mailed the request(s) for information at the latest address provided to the New Hampshire Bar Association;\n\n(2) that the lawyer was afforded a reasonable period of time to comply with the request for information or the subpoena, and has failed to comply, to answer, or to appear; and\n\n(3) that the subpoena or request for information was accompanied by a statement advising the attorney that failure to comply with the subpoena or request for information may result in summary suspension without further hearing.\n\n(4) Notice of intent to seek summary suspension was both sent by certified mail and was provided in hand to the attorney or attempted in hand without success, despite reasonable efforts.\n\n(e) Any suspension under the provisions of this Rule shall be immediately effective upon entry of the suspension order and shall be subject to the provisions of Rule 37(16)(g).\n\n(f) An attorney suspended under the provisions of subsection (c) above may request a hearing by the deadline set forth in the order of suspension. The hearing shall be conducted by a judicial referee or a hearing panel, and shall occur within ten (10) days of the effective date of the suspension. The judicial referee or hearing panel shall issue a report within ten (10) days of the hearing recommending whether the suspension should be lifted.\n\n(g) In the interest of justice, the court may, upon the filing of a petition for reinstatement, terminate such suspension at any time after affording the attorney discipline office an opportunity to be heard. The petition for reinstatement shall be accompanied by an affidavit of compliance stating the extent to which the lawyer has cured or abated the immediate threat of serious harm to the public or the integrity of the legal profession, or has otherwise complied with the subpoena or request for information. A copy of the petition and affidavit shall be sent to the attorney discipline office, which may file a response to the petition and affidavit within 10 days. The court may take such action on the petition as it deems appropriate.\n\n(h) If not reinstated pursuant to Rule 37(9-B)(f) or (g), the attorney shall become subject to the provisions of Rule 37(17).\n\n(i) A lawyer suspended in another jurisdiction pursuant to a procedure similar to that set forth herein may be suspended in this jurisdiction on a reciprocal basis as provided in Rule 37(12).\n\n(10) Proceedings Where An Attorney Is Declared To Be Incompetent Or Is Alleged To Be Incapacitated:\n\n(a) Whenever an attorney has been judicially declared incompetent or voluntarily or involuntarily committed to a mental health facility, the court, upon proper proof of the fact, may enter an order suspending such attorney from the practice of law until the further order of the court. A copy of such order shall be served upon such attorney, the attorney’s guardian and such other persons and in such manner as the court may direct.\n\n(b) Whenever any committee of the attorney discipline system or the attorney discipline office shall petition the court to determine whether an attorney is incapacitated from continuing the practice of law by reason of mental or physical infirmity or illness or because of addiction to drugs or intoxicants, the court may take or direct such action as it deems necessary or proper to determine whether the attorney is so incapacitated, including the examination of the attorney by such qualified medical experts as the court shall designate. If, upon due consideration of the matter, the court concludes that the attorney is incapacitated from continuing to practice law, it shall enter an order suspending the attorney on the ground of such disability for an indefinite period and until the further order of the court, and any pending disciplinary proceeding against the attorney may be held in abeyance.\n\nThe court shall provide for such notice to the respondent attorney of proceedings in the matter as it deems proper and advisable and shall appoint an attorney to represent the respondent if he or she is without adequate representation.\n\n(c) If, during the course of a disciplinary proceeding, the respondent attorney contends that he or she is suffering from a disability by reason of mental or physical infirmity or illness, or because of addiction to drugs or intoxicants, which makes it impossible for the respondent attorney to adequately defend himself or herself, the court thereupon shall enter an order immediately suspending the respondent attorney from continuing to practice law until a determination is made of the respondent attorney’s capacity to continue to practice law in a proceeding instituted in accordance with the provisions of subsection (b) of this section.\n\nIf, in the course of a proceeding under this section or in a disciplinary proceeding, the court shall determine that the respondent attorney is not so incapacitated, it shall take such action as it deems proper and advisable including a direction for the resumption of the disciplinary proceeding against the respondent attorney.\n\n(d) Any attorney suspended under the provisions of this section may apply for reinstatement following the expiration of one year from the date of suspension or at such other time as the court may direct in the order of suspension or any modification thereof. Such application shall be granted by the court upon a showing by clear and convincing evidence that the attorney’s disability has been removed and the attorney is fit to resume the practice of law. Upon such application, the court may take or direct such action as it deems necessary or proper to a determination of whether the attorney’s disability has been removed including a direction for an examination of the attorney by such qualified medical experts as the court shall designate. At its discretion, the court may direct that the expense of such an examination shall be paid by the attorney.\n\nWhenever an attorney has been suspended by an order in accordance with the provisions of subsection (a) of this section and, thereafter, in proceedings duly taken, the attorney has been judicially declared to be competent, the court may dispense with further evidence that the disability has been removed and may direct reinstatement upon such terms as it deems proper and advisable.\n\n(e) In a proceeding seeking an order of suspension under this section, the burden of proof shall rest with the moving party. In a proceeding seeking an order terminating a suspension under this section, the burden of proof shall rest with the suspended attorney.\n\n(f) The filing of an application for reinstatement by an attorney suspended for disability shall be deemed to constitute a waiver of any doctor-patient privilege with respect to any treatment of the attorney during the period of disability. The attorney shall be required to disclose the name of every psychiatrist, psychologist, physician and hospital by whom or in which the attorney has been examined or treated since the suspension and shall furnish to the court written consent to each to divulge such information and records as requested by the attorney discipline system or the court appointed medical experts.\n\n(11) Resignation By Attorney Under Disciplinary Investigation:\n\n(a) An attorney who is the subject of an investigation into allegations of misconduct may file a request to resign by delivering to the professional conduct committee an affidavit stating that he or she desires to resign and that:\n\n(1) the resignation is freely and voluntarily rendered; he or she is not being subjected to coercion or duress; he or she is fully aware of the implications of submitting the resignation;\n\n(2) he or she is aware that there is presently pending an investigation into allegations that he or she has been guilty of misconduct the nature of which shall be specifically set forth;\n\n(3) he or she acknowledges that the material facts upon which the complaint is predicated are true; and\n\n(4) he or she submits the resignation because he or she knows that if charges were predicated upon the misconduct under investigation they could not be successfully defended.\n\n(b) Upon receipt of the required affidavit, the professional conduct committee shall file it with the court, along with its recommendation, and the court may take such action as it deems necessary.\n\n(c) The contents of affidavit of an attorney filed in support of his or her resignation from the bar shall not be disclosed publicly or made available for use in any other proceeding except on order of the court.\n\n(12) Reciprocal Discipline:\n\n(a) Upon being disciplined in another jurisdiction, an attorney admitted to practice in this State shall immediately notify the attorney discipline office of the discipline. Upon notification from any source that an attorney admitted to practice in this State has been disciplined in another jurisdiction, the attorney discipline office shall obtain a certified copy of the disciplinary order and shall file it with the court.\n\n(b) Upon receipt of a certified copy of an order demonstrating that an attorney admitted to practice in this State has been disciplined in another jurisdiction, the court may enter a temporary order imposing the identical or substantially similar discipline or, in its discretion, suspending the attorney pending the imposition of final discipline. The court shall forthwith issue a notice directed to the attorney and to the attorney discipline office containing:\n\n(1) A copy of the order from the other jurisdiction; and\n\n(2) An order directing that the attorney or attorney discipline office inform the court within thirty (30) days from service of the notice, of any claim by the lawyer or professional conduct committee predicated upon the grounds set forth in subparagraph (d), that the imposition of the identical or substantially similar discipline in this State would be unwarranted and the reasons for that claim.\n\n(c) In the event the discipline imposed in the other jurisdiction has been stayed there, any reciprocal discipline imposed in this State shall be deferred until the stay expires.\n\n(d) Upon the expiration of thirty (30) days from service of the notice pursuant to subparagraph (b), the court shall issue an order of final discipline imposing the identical or substantially similar discipline unless the attorney or attorney discipline office demonstrates, or the court finds that it clearly appears upon the face of the record from which the discipline is predicated, that:\n\n(1) The procedure was so lacking in notice or opportunity to be heard as to constitute a deprivation of due process; or\n\n(2) The imposition of the same or substantially similar discipline by the court would result in grave injustice; or\n\n(3) The misconduct established warrants substantially different discipline in this State.\n\n(e) If the court determines that one of the factors set forth in paragraph (d) is present, the court shall refer the matter to the professional conduct committee for its recommendation regarding the discipline to be imposed.\n\n(13) Disbarred or Suspended Attorney:\n\n(a) A disbarred or suspended attorney may be ordered by the court, or by the professional conduct committee when an attorney is suspended by it for a period not to exceed six (6) months, to notify by registered or certified mail, return receipt requested, all clients being represented in pending matters, other than litigated or administrative matters or proceedings pending in any court or agency, of the disbarment or suspension and consequent inability to act as an attorney after the effective date of the disbarment or suspension and shall advise said clients to seek other legal counsel.\n\n(b) A disbarred or suspended attorney may be ordered by the court, or by the professional conduct committee when an attorney is suspended by it for a period not to exceed six (6) months, to notify, by registered or certified mail, return receipt requested, each client who is involved in litigated matters or administrative proceedings, and the attorney or attorneys for each adverse party in such matter or proceeding, of the disbarment or suspension and consequent inability to act as an attorney after the effective date of the disbarment or suspension. The notice to be given to the client shall advise the prompt substitution of another attorney or attorneys.\n\nIn the event the client does not obtain substitute counsel before the effective date of the disbarment or suspension, it shall be the responsibility of the disbarred or suspended attorney to move pro se in the court or agency in which the proceeding is pending, for leave to withdraw.\n\nThe notice to be given to the attorney or attorneys for an adverse party shall state the place of residence of the client of the disbarred or suspended attorney.\n\n(c) The disbarred or suspended attorney, after entry of the disbarment or suspension order, shall not accept any new retainer or engage as attorney for another in any new case or legal matter of any nature. However, during the period between the entry date of the order and its effective date, the disbarred or suspended attorney may wind up and complete, on behalf of any client, all matters which were pending on the entry date.\n\n(d) In addition, the court, or the professional conduct committee in cases where it issued a suspension order, may order that within thirty (30) days after the effective date of the disbarment or suspension order, the disbarred or suspended attorney shall file with the court an affidavit showing: (1) that he or she has fully complied with the provision of the order and with this section; and (2) that he or she has served a copy of such affidavit upon the professional conduct committee. Such affidavit shall also set forth the residence or other address of the disbarred or suspended attorney where communications may thereafter be directed, as well as a list of all other jurisdictions in which the disbarred or suspended attorney is a member of the bar.\n\n(e) A disbarred or suspended attorney shall keep and maintain records of the various steps taken under this section so that, upon any subsequent proceeding instituted by or against him or her, proof of compliance with this rule and with the disbarment or suspension order will be available.\n\n(14) Reinstatement and Readmission:\n\n(a) Reinstatement Following Suspension of Six Months or Less. An attorney who has been suspended for six months or less pursuant to disciplinary proceedings shall be reinstated by the professional conduct committee following the end of the period of suspension upon the filing of a motion for reinstatement. The motion for reinstatement shall be filed with the professional conduct committee and served upon disciplinary counsel and shall be accompanied by:\n\n(1) an affidavit stating that he or she has fully complied with the requirements of the suspension order and has paid any required fees and costs; and\n\n(2) evidence that he or she has satisfactorily completed the Multistate Professional Responsibility Examination since his or her suspension.\n\n(b) Reinstatement Following Suspension of More Than Six Months.\n\n(1) An attorney suspended by the court for misconduct, other than for disability, for more than six months shall be reinstated only upon order of the court. No attorney may petition for reinstatement until the period of suspension has expired.\n\n(2) Petition. An attorney who seeks reinstatement following suspension of more than six months shall file a petition for reinstatement with the court. The petition shall be accompanied by a completed reinstatement form and the requisite filing fee. The petition shall be under oath and shall:\n\n(A) specify with particularity the manner in which the petitioner has fully complied with the terms and conditions set forth in all prior disciplinary orders; and\n\n(B) certify that the petitioner has taken the Multistate Professional Responsibility Examination after entry of the order of suspension and within one year of the filing of the petition for reinstatement, and has received a passing grade as established by the board of bar examiners.\n\n(3) Initial Review of Petition and Reinstatement Form. The court will review the petition and reinstatement form to determine whether the certifications required by subsection (2) of this rule have been provided and whether the reinstatement form is complete. If so, the court shall refer the petition and reinstatement form to the professional conduct committee, and shall provide a copy of the petition and reinstatement form to the attorney discipline office.\n\n(4) Publication of Notice of Petition. If the court refers the petition to the professional conduct committee, the professional conduct committee shall cause a notice to be published in a newspaper with statewide circulation, a newspaper with circulation in the area of the petitioner’s former primary office, and in the New Hampshire Bar News, that the petitioner has moved for reinstatement. The notice shall also be posted on the judicial branch website. The notice shall invite anyone to comment on the petition by submitting said comments in writing to the professional conduct committee within twenty (20) days of publication. All comments shall be made available to the petitioner. Where feasible, the professional conduct committee shall give notice to the original complainant.\n\n(5) Hearing. Upon receipt of the petition, the professional conduct committee may either recommend reinstatement or refer the petition to the hearings committee for prompt appointment of a hearing panel.\n\n(A) The hearing panel chair shall conduct and hold a prehearing conference within thirty (30) days of the appointment of the hearing panel.\n\n(B) The hearings committee shall conduct a hearing within 120 days of the appointment of the hearing panel.\n\n(C) The petitioner shall bear the burden of demonstrating by clear and convincing evidence that he or she has the moral qualifications, competence, and learning in the law required for admission to practice law in this State and that the resumption of the practice of law will be neither detrimental to the integrity and standing of the bar or the administration of justice nor subversive to the public interest.\n\n(D) Attorneys from the attorney discipline office may participate in the hearing to present evidence and to cross-examine the petitioner and any witnesses.\n\n(E) At the conclusion of the hearing, the hearing panel shall promptly file with the professional conduct committee a report containing its findings and recommendations and the record of the proceedings.\n\n(6) Review by the Professional Conduct Committee. Following receipt of the report, the professional conduct committee shall:\n\n(A) review the report of the hearing panel and the record;\n\n(B) allow the filing of written memoranda by disciplinary counsel and the petitioner;\n\n(C) review the hearing transcript;\n\n(D) hold oral argument if requested by a party or ordered by the Committee; and\n\n(E) file its own findings and recommendations with the court, together with the record, and provide a copy of the recommendations and findings to the petitioner.\n\n(7) Final Order by the Court.

The court will review the petition to determine whether the certifications required by subsection (2) of this rule have been provided. If so, the court shall refer the petition to the professional conduct committee, the office of bar admissions, and the character and fitness committee for the formation of a special committee on readmission to consider the petition and to make a recommendation to the court. The court shall provide a copy of the petition for readmission to the attorney discipline office.\n\n(4) The petitioner’s application to take the bar examination, including the petition and questionnaire for admission to the New Hampshire Bar, and all non-privileged documents on file with the office of bar admissions relating to the petition and questionnaire, shall be provided to the attorney discipline office. All documents on file with the office of bar admissions relating to the petition and questionnaire for admission to the New Hampshire Bar shall remain confidential and not available for public inspection, subject to the exceptions listed in Supreme Court Rule 42(IV)(g), until they are submitted as exhibits at the hearing before the special committee on readmission.\n\n(5) The Special Committee on Readmission.

The notice shall also be posted on the judicial branch website. The notice shall invite anyone to comment on the petition by submitting said comments in writing to the professional conduct committee within twenty (20) days of publication.

If the evidence of continuing competence and learning in the law, and evidence of continuing moral character and fitness, are satisfactory to the court, the court may order readmission effective upon payment by the applicant of all bar dues and other fees, including public protection fund fees, that the applicant would have been responsible for paying had the applicant remained an active member of the bar from the date of resignation until the date of readmission. In addition, the court may condition readmission upon completion of such continuing legal education as the court may order.\n\n(b) If the evidence of continuing competence and learning in the law is not satisfactory to the court, the court shall refer the motion for readmission to the professional conduct committee for referral to a panel of the hearings committee. The hearing panel shall promptly schedule a hearing at which the attorney shall have the burden of demonstrating by a preponderance of the evidence that he or she has the competency and learning in law required for readmission. At the conclusion of the hearing, the hearing panel shall promptly file a report containing its findings and recommendations and transmit same, together with the record, to the professional conduct committee. The professional conduct committee shall review the report of the hearings committee panel, the record and the hearing transcript and shall file its own recommendations and findings, together with the record, with the court. Following the submission of briefs, if necessary, and oral argument, if any, the court shall enter a final order. No order of the court granting readmission shall be effective prior to payment by the applicant of all bar dues and other fees, including public protection fund fees, that the applicant would have been responsible for paying had the applicant remained an active member of the bar from the date of resignation until the date of readmission. In addition, the court may condition readmission upon completion of such continuing legal education as the court may order.\n\n(c) If the evidence of continuing moral character and fitness is not satisfactory to the court, the court shall order the applicant to file with the committee on character and fitness and with the clerk of the supreme court the petition and questionnaire referred to in Supreme Court Rule 42(5)(e). Further proceedings shall be governed by Rule 42. No order of the court granting readmission shall be effective prior to payment by the applicant of all bar dues and other fees, including public protection fund fees, that the applicant would have been responsible for paying had the applicant remained an active member of the bar from the date of resignation until the date of readmission. In addition, the court may condition readmission upon completion of such continuing legal education as the court may order.\n\n(16) Procedure:\n\n(a) Either a respondent attorney or disciplinary counsel may appeal findings of the professional conduct committee and the imposition of a reprimand, public censure or a suspension of six (6) months or less by filing a notice of appeal with the supreme court. The appeal shall not be a mandatory appeal. If the appeal is accepted by the court, the court may affirm, reverse or modify the findings of the professional conduct committee.\n\nThe filing of an appeal by the respondent shall stay the disciplinary order being appealed unless the professional conduct committee orders otherwise. If the professional conduct committee orders otherwise, it shall set forth in its order its reasons for doing so. In all cases, however, the supreme court may on motion for good cause shown stay the disciplinary order.\n\n(b) The professional conduct committee shall initiate disciplinary proceedings requesting a discipline of greater than six (6) months in this court by filing the professional conduct committee's recommendation and the record of the proceedings with this court.\n\n(c) Following receipt of the recommendation and the record, this court shall serve the respondent attorney with the recommendation at the latest address provided to the New Hampshire Bar Association. Simultaneously, the court shall notify the parties that the parties must, within 30 days of this court's order thereon, identify any legal or factual issues the parties wish this court to review. Thereafter, this court may issue a scheduling order setting forth a briefing schedule and any other matters as shall be deemed desirable or necessary. There shall not be a de novo evidentiary hearing. In matters resolved by dispositive stipulation, this paragraph shall not apply, though the court retains discretion to reject any dispositive stipulation in whole or in part, or to identify legal or factual issues it wishes the parties to address.\n\n(d) The court may make such temporary orders as justice may require either with or without a hearing.
