        "text": "Anyone in any of the following roles should be considered a potential PEP.\n\nPEPs in Government Roles\n\nLegislative Bodies: An example is a Member of Parliament\n\nExecutive Bodies: A PEP could range from the head of state down to the assistant ministers\n\nDiplomatic Roles: Ambassadors or chargé d’affaires would be considered PEPs\n\nJudiciary Bodies: Key people working within supreme courts, constitutional courts or high-level judicial bodies\n\nState-Owned Enterprises: A PEP would typically be anyone from a senior executive upwards. However, even former members of the board of directors no longer associated with an organization may retain influence and still be flagged as PEPs\n\nPEPs in Organizations and Institutions\n\nCentral Financial Institutions: Examples here would be the Court of Auditors and members on the boards of central banks\n\nArmed Forces: In this situation a PEP rating would typically only apply to a high-ranking officer\n\nInternational Sports Committees: Members of these committees may be influenced to vote on the location of major sporting events/contracts for building venues, etc., so have recently been included by FATF under their definition of a PEP\n\nKnown ‘Close Associates’ who are Considered PEPs\n\nAnyone with a close business relationship or joint beneficial ownership of legal entities or legal arrangements with a PEP\n\nAnyone who has the sole beneficial ownership of a legal entity which is known to have been set up for the benefit de facto of the PEP\n\nImmediate Family Members who are Considered PEPs\n\nParents and children of PEPs\n\nSpouse or partner\n\nSiblings\n\nUncles and aunts\n\nEven slightly indirect family members (such as in-laws) will be considered as politically exposed persons\n\nNote: Each country may have different local PEP regulations that you need to comply with when doing business in that region.\n\nTest Yourself: Are these people PEPs?\n\nThe mayor of Paris\n\nA former member of the board of directors for a state-owned enterprise\n\nA famous actress\n\nHead of the Olympic Committee\n\nThe son-in-law of the mayor of Paris\n\nA town councilor\n\nThe justice of the peace in a Magistrates Court\n\nThe manager of a national football team\n\nThe business partner of someone who has a sister on the Olympic Committee\n\nIt’s easy to see how the list of potential PEPs is expansive and continually in flux as people move into new roles, family members change, regulations and recommendations from the FATF are updated at the local level, and the international landscape changes.\n\nContact us to learn how to streamline your due diligence and lower your exposure to risk and fines."
