        "text": "What criteria did President Biden use to pick his nominee?\n\nPresident Biden conducted a rigorous process to identify Justice Breyer’s replacement. As the longtime Chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, the President took seriously the Constitution’s requirement that he make this appointment “by and with the Advice and Consent of the Senate,” seeking the advice of Senators in both parties. He studied the histories and case records of candidates and consulted legal experts. Confirming exceptionally qualified judicial nominees with varying backgrounds and experiences has been a key priority for the President since he took office.\n\nPresident Biden sought a candidate with exceptional credentials, unimpeachable character, and unwavering dedication to the rule of law. He also sought a nominee—much like Justice Stephen Breyer—who is wise, pragmatic, and has a deep understanding of the Constitution as an enduring charter of liberty. And finally, the President sought an individual who is committed to equal justice under the law who understands the profound impact that the Supreme Court’s decisions can have on the lives of the American people."
