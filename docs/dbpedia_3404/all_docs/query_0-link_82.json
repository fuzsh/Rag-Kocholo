        "text": "Introduction\n\nThe IEP is the cornerstone of the special education process for each individual student. It is the tool to document how one student’s special needs will be met within the context of an educational curriculum and environment. The IEP development process and implementation need to be premised on the research and experience that have shown that to improve results for students with disabilities, schools must:\n\nHave high expectations for students with disabilities;\n\nEnsure their access in the general education curriculum to the maximum extent possible;\n\nStrengthen the role of parents and take steps to ensure that families have meaningful opportunities to participate in the education of their children at school and at home;\n\nEnsure that special education is a service, rather than a place where students are sent;\n\nProvide appropriate special education services, aids and supports in the general education classroom, whenever appropriate;\n\nEnsure that all those who work with students with disabilities have the skills and knowledge necessary to:\n\nHelp these students meet developmental goals and, to the maximum extent possible, the challenging expectations established for all children, and\n\nPrepare them to lead productive, independent adult lives, to the maximum extent possible;\n\nProvide high quality research-based instruction and supports to all students who are experiencing learning difficulties to reduce the need to label children as having disabilities in order to address their learning needs; and\n\nFocus resources on teaching and learning.\n\nThe Foundation of an Effective Special Education Process\n\nAppropriately developed IEPs and high quality research-based specially-designed instructional practices (i.e., special education) are essential to ensure a free appropriate public education to a student with a disability; but the context and environment in which the student's IEP is implemented are equally as important. Because special education is a service and not a place, a high quality and effective special education program relies in great part on the quality of the school district as a whole, including, but not limited to the following:\n\nAdministrative support for the CSE process, including access to training necessary for CSE members to understand and follow through on their responsibilities.\n\nAdministrative support to ensure implementation of CSE recommendations.\n\nA philosophy and practices that support inclusion of students with disabilities in all buildings and classrooms.\n\nEffective communication systems among school principals, CSE chairpersons, special and general education teachers and service providers.\n\nHigh quality early intervening services, including research-based instruction; systems to continually screen, monitor and intervene to address a student's response to instruction (e.g., \"response to intervention\"); school-wide, classroom-based and small group positive behavioral supports and services; and culturally responsive instruction and environments.\n\nKnowledgeable and qualified personnel to conduct individual evaluations, provide special education, and instruct students in core curriculum.\n\nThe IEP and IEP Development Process\n\nThe IEP is a strategic planning document that identifies a student’s unique needs and how the school will strategically address those needs in IEPs:\n\nGuide how the resources of a school will be configured.\n\nIdentify how students will be incrementally prepared for adult living.\n\nProvide an important accountability tool for school personnel, students, and parents to measure students’ progress toward goals and objectives, and to determine whether the school has appropriately configured how it uses its resources to reach the desired outcomes for students with disabilities.\n\nEnsure that each student with a disability has access to the general education curriculum and is provided the appropriate learning opportunities, accommodations, adaptations, specialized services and supports needed for the student to progress toward achieving the learning standards and to meet his or her unique needs related to the disability.\n\nThe IEP development process is a student-centered process. No other issues, agenda or purposes should interfere with this process.\n\nInformation provided by parents regarding their child’s strengths and needs is a vital part of the evaluation and is considered in developing an IEP.\n\nAll members of the Committee share the responsibility to contribute meaningfully in the development of a student’s IEP and to make recommendations that are based on the student’s present levels of performance and in consideration of the student’s strengths, needs, interests and preferences, and the concerns of the parents for the education of their child.\n\nCSEs include individuals who know the student and his or her unique needs and who have the authority to commit the school’s resources to address the student’s needs.\n\nIndividuals serving on CSEs can articulate their role and execute their responsibilities on the Committee.\n\nCSEs include individuals who contribute meaningfully to the discussion of the student's strengths and needs and how those needs can be met in the least restrictive environment.\n\nThe IEP must be developed in such a way that it is a useful document that guides instruction and provides a tool to measure progress.\n\nThe IEP should appropriately address all the student’s unique needs without regard to the current availability of needed services.\n\nThe IEP development process must include steps to ensure IEP implementation.\n\nAll staff with responsibility to implement a student's IEP must be specifically informed of their responsibilities and be provided a copy (or, as appropriate, access to a copy) of the student's IEP.\n\nResources necessary for the student's IEP to be implemented must be accessed in a timely manner.\n\nSystems of progress monitoring of the student's progress toward the annual goals must be established and consistently implemented.\n\nThe student’s parents must be regularly informed of their child’s progress.\n\nThis Quality Indicator Review and Resource Guide focuses on three areas essential to a quality CSE and IEP development process\n\nIndividualized Education Program (IEP) Development\n\nIEPs for students with disabilities developed by the CSE/CPSE result in student access, participation and progress in the general education curriculum and address other disability needs of the student.\n\nResults of individual evaluations provide the information the CSE needs to make its recommendations.\n\nThe student’s strengths and needs guide IEP development.\n\nThe CSE considers the interrelationship of the impact of the student’s disability and the components of the IEP.\n\nIEP development occurs in a structured, sequential manner.\n\nIEPs include documentation of recommendations in a clear and specific manner so that the IEP can be implemented consistent with the CSE recommendations.\n\nAnnual goals are identified to enable the student to progress in the general education curriculum and meet other disability related needs.\n\nThe CSE determines how student needs will be met in the least restrictive environment.\n\nThe CSE demonstrates knowledge of grade level general education curricular and behavioral expectations and benchmarks.\n\nResource Allocation\n\nThe district uses data on the needs of current and future students that are analyzed to determine the procurement, allocation and/or reallocation of resources required to support the CSE process and implement IEP services and supports for students.\n\nProfessional development is provided to CSE members to ensure their understanding of their roles and responsibilities on the CSE.\n\nThe district understands its child find responsibilities to identify students whose needs may need to be addressed by the CSE.\n\nStudents’ needs determine the allocation of personnel and material resources.\n\nIEP Implementation\n\nIEPS are implemented with fidelity and adjusted based on student response to instruction.\n\nOngoing progress monitoring and formative assessment of student progress, goals and objectives are consistently implemented.\n\nRevisions to the IEP are made based on data indicating changes in student needs or abilities.\n\nAlignment between the written document and actual practice is evident.\n\nIndicator: IEP Development Outcome: IEPs for students with disabilities developed by the CSE result in student access, participation and progress in the general education curriculum and address a student's other disability needs.\n\nDriving Questions:\n\nDid the CSE obtain a comprehensive individual evaluation of the student in all areas of the suspected disability?\n\nDoes the CSE have sufficient information about the student's response to instruction in the general education environment?\n\nIs all evaluation information and prereferral information considered and discussed at the meeting?\n\nDoes the CSE have information about the general education curriculum, context, services and assessments to support decision making to make meaningful recommendations for each student?\n\nDoes the CSE understand the unique nature of the student’s disability and consider that information in making its recommendations?\n\nDo the members of the CSE/CPSE understand the Committee process and expectations and their roles, including the information about the student, evaluations, curricula and State and district-wide assessment that they are expected to bring to the Committee discussions?\n\nAre the parent’s concerns and the student’s strengths, preferences and interests evident in the IEP?\n\nQuality Indicators Look for Comments/Evidence Results of individual evaluations provide the information the CSE needs to make its recommendations.\n\nEvaluation results are reported in a manner that provides sufficient basis for:\n\npresent levels of performance (PLP);\n\ncomparison to typically developing peers and grade-level expectations;\n\nunique learning characteristics and educational needs of the student;\n\ndevelopment of IEP annual goals and, as appropriate, short-term instructional objectives and benchmarks; and\n\ntransition activities.\n\nEvaluation results provide sufficient baseline information for future determination of progress in all areas of the suspected disability.\n\nEvaluation reports are written in clear, precise, and easily understood language that is:\n\nJargon free\n\nSuccinct\n\nProvided in the language/mode of communication understood by the parent\n\nEvaluation reports identify the nature and extent to which the student may need environmental modifications or accommodations; human and material resources to support learning in the general education curriculum and environment.\n\nEvaluation reports provide instructionally relevant information that provides insight into the student’s learning characteristics and needs and supports development and provision of instruction likely to result in achievement of the student’s IEP goals.\n\nA student's performance on State and district-wide assessments is discussed, considered and documented during the CSE meeting.\n\nStudent’s strengths and needs guide IEP development.\n\nCSE discussions and IEP recommendations are based on the strengths and needs of the student.\n\nClear, concise PLP statements are written in user friendly language, and are a thorough description of student strengths and needs.\n\nThe CSE considers the interrelationship of the impact of the student’s disability and the components of the IEP.\n\nParent input is solicited, discussed and given meaningful consideration in the development of the IEP.\n\nThe CSE reviews, discusses, analyzes and evaluates the student’s progress toward annual goals in order to address his/her unique needs related to the disability.\n\nThe CSE considers the student's progress in his/her current educational program and/or IEP as a baseline for creation of the new IEP.\n\nThe CSE evaluates the current IEP to determine if it was sufficient to achieve educational benefit for the child:\n\nAnnual goals and special education programs and services were identified to address all identified needs.\n\nThe student acquired new knowledge and skills, and student’s rate of progress was sufficient to meet IEP goals and objectives.\n\nThe CSE considers the level of growth in the student’s social interaction, behavioral, academic and emotional skills in evaluating progress.\n\nIEP development occurs in a structured, sequential manner.\n\nDevelopment of PLP, based on unique student strengths and needs, provides basis for remainder of IEP.\n\nGoals identify the knowledge and skills the student will achieve by the end of the school year based on needs identified in the PLP, and include consideration of measurable post-secondary goals based on identified transition needs for students who are or will be 15 during the period covered by the IEP.\n\nRecommended special education program and services, accommodations, and modifications needed for student to achieve goals are discussed.\n\nPlacement is the last recommendation made in consideration of the least restrictive environment in which the student's IEP can be implemented.\n\nIEPs include documentation of recommendations in a clear and specific manner so that the IEP can be implemented consistent with the CSE recommendations.\n\nRecommendations are written in language the parents and educators can understand.\n\nRecommendations are clearly stated as to identify the district’s commitment of resources to assist the student in reaching his or her goals.\n\nAnnual goals are identified to enable the student to progress in the general education curriculum and meet other disability related needs.\n\nDetermination of individual needs (i.e., present levels of performance) provide the basis for written annual goals.\n\nAnnual goals, including benchmarks or short-term instructional objectives, are identified to:\n\nenable the student to be involved in and progress in the general curriculum (or for preschool students, in appropriate activities); and\n\nmeet each of the student’s other educational needs that result from the student’s disability.\n\nAnnual goals focus on the knowledge, skills, behaviors and strategies to address the student’s needs.\n\nGoals are developed in consideration of the student's need to progress toward the State standards by identifying the foundation knowledge (e.g., reading/math) necessary to meet the standards and/or the learning strategies that will help him or her to learn the curriculum content.\n\nTargeted learning outcomes/goals are closely aligned to the general education curriculum and aligned with the age/developmental level of the class or grade level.\n\nAnnual goals define the path from the student’s present level of performance to a level of performance expected by the end of the year.\n\nIEP goals and objectives are:\n\ninstructionally relevant;\n\nmeasurable;\n\naligned with identified targeted needs;\n\nreasonably achievable in the period covered by the IEP;\n\ncongruent with the student’s ability/disability; and\n\ndesigned to support participation and success in the general education curriculum.\n\nThe CSE determines how student needs will be met in the least restrictive environment.\n\nIn development of the IEP, the CSE first considers all potentially successful accommodations, program modifications, supplementary aids and services, behavioral supports and services and special education services that can occur within the regular education environment before considering services or programs that remove the student from the regular classroom.\n\nThe CSE actively considers and recommends accommodations or modifications to instruction and/or the use of adaptive technology as necessary to ensure access to the general education curriculum.\n\nThe IEP includes support for school personnel (professional development or technical assistance) as needed to implement the IEP.\n\nThe CSE demonstrates knowledge of grade level general education curricular and behavioral expectations and benchmarks.\n\nThe CSE membership includes persons with knowledge of NYS Learning Standards, grade level curriculum content, curriculum maps, and grade level and subject area skill sets, including recognized hierarchal and sequential order of skill acquisition.\n\nThe CSE uses knowledge of the continuum of appropriate academic and behavior intervention strategies for subject areas and age/developmental levels.\n\nThe CSE understands, discusses, and uses information about “hidden curriculum” (social interaction) issues and considerations specific to grade, classroom or building in determining need for accommodations and supports of skill acquisition.\n\nCSE considers issues of access, participation and progress in relation to each individual student's needs, including, but not limited to, consideration of:\n\ncurriculum content;\n\nmodifications to instructional materials;\n\nrate of learning;\n\nphysical environments;\n\ndemonstration of learning;\n\ninstructional approaches;\n\ninstructional supports; and\n\nbehavioral supports.\n\nDimension: Resource Allocation Outcome: The district uses data on the needs of current and future students to determine the procurement, allocation and/or reallocations of resources required to support the CSE process and implement IEP services and supports for students.\n\nDriving Questions:\n\nHave the BOE and administration ensured availability of resources to support the CSE process?\n\nAre the resources readily available to support implementation of the recommendations?\n\nQuality Indicators Look For Comments/Evidence Professional development is provided to CSE members to ensure their understanding of their roles and responsibilities on the CSE.\n\nThe district has documented a procedure for ensuring that members of the committee have access to professional development (PD) addressing their roles and responsibilities.\n\nThe district has documentation of provision of PD in an accessible format and timeframe.\n\nThe district has documentation of participation in PD for all who may participate as members of the CSE/CPSE, including:\n\nChairperson\n\nSpecial education teachers\n\nRelated service providers\n\nGeneral education teachers\n\nParent members\n\nThe district understands its child find responsibilities to identify students whose needs may need to be addressed by the CSE.\n\nThe district has equitable procedures and practices for child find, including procedures for students who are homeless, wards of the State, migrant, limited English proficient, home schooled and parentally placed in private schools located in the school district.\n\nThe district sends the CSE chairperson or representative to planning meetings for students transitioning from Early Intervention to preschool.\n\nThe district ensures that data used to determine student’s need for referral for special education are collected through valid and reliable screening tools, including assessment of the effectiveness of general education instruction and supports (e.g., response-to-intervention).\n\nThe district plans strategically (e.g., longitudinal data on increases or decreases of students in certain disability categories, such as autism, that may result in the need to reallocate resources).\n\nThe district has procedures in place to complete individual evaluations of students suspected of having a disability.\n\nStudents’ needs determine the allocation of personnel and material resources.\n\nA full continuum of special education services is available to each student.\n\nAll members of the CSE team understand the purpose and LRE implications of each service along the continuum.\n\nStudents' needs for special education programs drive how the school district configures its special education services/ resources to meet those needs (e.g., staff are assigned as special class teachers, resource room teachers or consultant teachers depending on the number of students requiring such services as determined at initial and annual review meetings).\n\nThe district has a procedure in place to ensure students needing instructional materials in alternative formats receive them at the same time that other students receive their instructional materials.\n\nDistrict has procedures in place to ensure equipment and materials are provided to support student access of the general education curriculum (e.g., Assistive Technology, needed furniture such as tilt tables, bathroom lift, auditory enhancers) as recommended in the IEP.\n\nDimension: IEP Implementation Desired Outcome: IEPs are implemented with fidelity and adjusted based on student response to instruction.\n\nDriving Questions:\n\nHas the chairperson identified a professional staff person(s) to inform staff of their IEP implementation responsibilities for each student?\n\nDo all staff responsible for implementation of a student's IEP have a copy of (or, as appropriate, access to a copy of) the IEP?\n\nHas the necessary follow-up occurred to ensure that implementation of the IEP and monitoring of progress toward the annual goals are occurring according to the method and schedule in the IEP?\n\nAre instruction and/or related services adjusted to meet changing needs of the student?\n\nAre services prioritized to ensure that the services are implemented in such a way as to address the student’s needs with the greatest impact and least disruption of instruction?\n\nWhat process/procedures are in place for parents and school personnel to inform the CSE if the student is not likely to meet his/her annual goals by the end of the year to consider changes to the student's IEP recommendations?\n\nQuality Indicators Look for Comments/Evidence Ongoing progress monitoring and formative assessment of student progress, goals and objectives is consistently implemented.\n\nPLPs establish a measurable baseline of student’s abilities and needs for determining progress.\n\nInstructional staff use a broad range of objective data collection methods to monitor student progress.\n\nImpact achieved from implementation of recommended strategies is documented.\n\nInstructional staff use data from progress monitoring to inform instruction.\n\nPeriodic reports to parents and others provide specific data, in measurable terms, on the extent to which the student has progressed toward meeting annual goals.\n\nProgress is reported to parents in a manner that is understandable to them (measurable, jargon free, objective not subjective).\n\nRevisions to the IEP are made based on data indicating changes in student needs or abilities.\n\nData from progress monitoring drives decisions made to modify the IEP.\n\nStaff use student progress data as evidence to assess the effectiveness of each special education instructional service and strategy that has been implemented to determine if the instructional approach is effective with the student.\n\nDocumentation verifies that interventions have been implemented with fidelity (training, observations) prior to request for change.\n\nEvidence exists that when progress monitoring shows the student is not likely to reach his/her annual goals, the district schedules IEP reviews in a timely manner to review and, if appropriate, revise the IEP.\n\nAlignment between written document and actual practice is evident.\n\nClassroom instruction and activities are aligned with the IEP goals and objectives.\n\nSpecial education teachers and related service providers are providing specially designed instruction individualized to the student’s needs and designed to support acquisition, generalization, and maintenance of knowledge, skill and learning strategies\n\nResources\n\nOffice of Special Education Educational Partnership\n\nNYS Sample IEP
