The chief sergeant at arms heads the department. Other staff members include two full-time assistant sergeants and a legislative assistant. The chief sergeant is appointed by the speaker. The assistant sergeants are elected by the House members to serve with the chief sergeant as officers of the House. A number of pages are hired during a legislative session to assist in performing necessary duties.\n\nPages\n\nPages serve as support staff for all House and conference committee hearings and assist other departments in their duties. During session, pages assist members in the House chamber by obtaining copies of bills or other legislative materials and delivering messages from the public or other members. They also assist in preparing for a daily session by placing agendas and orders on each member's desk, as well as passing out amendments and other data during debate.\n\nParking\n\nThe sergeant's office coordinates parking spaces for members and staff. Parking information for the public is available from the sergeant's office for those attending meetings or visiting House lawmakers.\n\nSecurity\n\nThe sergeant's office serves as a liaison with Capitol Security in providing security for House office areas. A major role for the chief sergeant is to provide a safe environment for members and staff at all times, particularly during session in the House chamber or during committee meetings.\n\nThe chief sergeant is responsible for decorum and protocol, and may be requested by the speaker to locate and escort members to the chamber during a roll call vote. Members may be escorted from the chamber, or visitors from the gallery, if they become disruptive.\n\nThe sergeant's office orders and distributes keys for offices, files, and desks; unlocks committee rooms for meetings; and authorizes Capitol Complex I.D. cards.\n\nMail Room\n\nThe House mail room receives and distributes mail for members and staff.\n\nText taken from the House of Representatives Legislative Handbook, published by the House of Representatives Public Information Services Office and House Educational Programs."
