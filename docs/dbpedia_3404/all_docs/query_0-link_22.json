        "text": "There are various boards, commissions and committees in county government in Tennessee. Almost all of the boards, commissions and committees are either required or authorized by state general law. It is important to distinguish between boards, commissions and committees that have their basis in state statutory law and exercise authority independently of other bodies or officials as differing from those committees created by resolution of the county legislative body to study and make recommendations to the county legislative body that have no authority to act independently. Study committees created by the county legislative body to make recommendations to the body are not discussed.\n\nIf the statute provides for a board to be elected/appointed by the county legislative body, then the members of the county legislative body cannot serve on this board unless specifically authorized by statute. It violates public policy for an appointing body to confer office upon one of its own members. However, if board members are appointed by the county mayor or some other officer subject to confirmation of the county legislative body, then county legislative body members may be appointed, unless this is expressly prohibited.\n\nThe power to confirm appointments is different from the power to appoint for purposes of analyzing potential conflicts of interest under the common law rule enunciated in State ex rel. v. Thompson, 193 Tenn. 395, 246 S.W.2d 59 (1952), that it violates public policy for an appointing body to confer office upon one of its own members. The Attorney General has opined that the county legislative body's power to confirm candidates appointed by the county executive does not amount to a power of appointment for purposes of the principles applied in Thompson and State ex rel. Bugbee v. Duke (Tenn., filed at Nashville, August 29, 1988), an unpublished opinion of the Tennessee Supreme Court. See Op. Tenn. Att'y Gen. 94-013 (Feb 3, 1994)."
