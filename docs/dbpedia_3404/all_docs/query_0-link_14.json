Therefore, the Handbook contains broad descriptions of reimbursable expenses, but is not an exhaustive list of such expenses. Questions about reimbursement of an expense should be directed to the Committee prior to incurring an expense.\n\nThe Communications Standards Commission (“Commission”) regulates all official communications. Questions about communications should be directed to the Communications Standards Commission.\n\nFor all questions relating to policies and procedures applicable to the acquisition, transfer, disposal, and maintenance of furnishings, equipment, software, and related services, please refer to the User’s Guide.\n\nAdministrative, financial and non-legislative support services (e.g., equipment purchases, technology standards and services, office supplies, room reservation and set-up) are acquired through the Office of the House Chief Administrative Officer (CAO). For further information about the CAO’s services, please refer to HouseNet, the House intranet or the CAO’s services office, First Call, at x58000.\n\nReturn to Top\n\nGeneral\n\nOnly expenses, the primary purpose of which are official and representational, and are incurred in accordance with the Handbook are reimbursable.

The MRA is available for services provided and expenses incurred from January 3 of one year through January 2 of the following year. All expenses incurred will be charged to the allowance available on the date the services were provided or the expenses were incurred. Upon the death, resignation, or expulsion of a Member, the Member’s allowance will be made available only for services provided and expenses incurred at the direction of the Member up through the last day of the Member’s term in office.

The expenditures reflected in the monthly financial statements are compiled and published in the quarterly Statement of Disbursements, which is a public document published online. Return to Top\n\nIncidental Use\n\nIncidental personal use of official equipment and supplies is permitted only when such use is negligible in nature, frequency, time consumed, and expense.\n\nFor example, limited use of government resources to access the Internet, to send or receive personal email or to make personal phone calls is permissible, so long as the use meets theabove criteria, and otherwise conforms with the Regulations of the Committee and the Code of Official Conduct (House Rule XXIII).\n\nEach Member office may adopt a more restrictive incidental use policy\n\nReturn to Top\n\nOverspending\n\nEach Member is personally responsible for the payment of any official and representational expenses incurred that exceed the authorized MRA which the Member shall pay from personal funds. If the Member fails to pay the obligation voluntarily, the CAO will deduct the amount owed from any pay, mileage, or expense reimbursement due to the Member or through an administrative offset or legal action in the case of a former Member. The Office of Financial Counseling will notify a Member if he or she is projected to overspend their MRA.\n\nContact the Office of Financial Counseling at x57474 or the Committee for assistance with accounting and budgeting.\n\nReturn to Top\n\nStaff\n\nReturn to Top\n\nGeneral\n\nFor purposes of this Handbook:\n\n“Staff” refers to all individuals who serve in the office of a Member including employees, fellows, unpaid interns, and volunteers.\n\n“Employee” refers to an individual appointed to a position of employment in the House of Representatives by an authorized employing authority including individuals receiving pay disbursed by the CAO and individuals in a Leave Without Pay or furlough status. Employees count against a Member’s employee ceiling.\n\nThe Congressional Accountability Act (CAA) also contains definitions of “employees” and “interns.” Nothing in this Handbook alters those statutory definitions as applied under the CAA.\n\nEach Member is an authorized employing authority and determines the terms and conditions of employment and service for their staff consistent with applicable federal laws and House Rules.\n\n1. Personnel actions affecting employment positions in the House of Representatives must be free from discrimination based on race, color, national origin, religion, sex (including sexual orientation or gender identity), service in the military, disability, marital or parental status or age.\n\n2. Pursuant to House Rule XXIII, clause 8(a), a Member may not retain an employee on the Member’s payroll who does not perform official duties commensurate with the compensation received for the offices of the employing authority.\n\n3. Teleworking is entirely at the discretion of the Member, subject to the Telework Policy regulations, and a Member is under no obligation to offer a teleworking option to employees. Offices offering teleworking must establish a teleworking program and enter into teleworking agreements with employees who are eligible to telework. The Telework Policy and sample teleworking program and agreement are located on the Committee website.\n\n4. Members are not authorized to procure consultant services or to enter into detailee agreements.\n\nReturn to Top\n\nEmployees\n\nReturn to Top\n\nEmployee Ceiling\n\nUnder 2 U.S.C. § 5321, each Member of the House of Representatives may employ eighteen (18) permanent employees and four (4) additional employees. The 4 additional employees must be appointed to one of the following categories:\n\n1. Interns paid from the MRA\n\n2. Part-time employees\n\n3. Shared employees\n\n4. Temporary employees\n\n5. Employees on leave without pay status\n\nReturn to Top\n\nPaid Interns\n\nPaid interns must perform services for the Member on a temporary basis as part of an educational plan. Examples of an educational plan include, but are not limited to, participation in the Intern Lecture Series, attendance at committee hearings, attendance at CRS internship training programs, etc. Each Member is responsible for determining the activities of the Member’s interns consistent with these requirements.\n\nPaid interns may work for no more than 120 calendar days in a 12-month period, per employing authority and may not be shared between Member offices. Pursuant to regulations promulgated by the Office of Congressional Workplace Rights, paid interns are not employees for purposes of compliance with the minimum wage and overtime provisions of the Fair Labor Standards Act. However, interns, both paid and unpaid, are covered under the anti-harassment and anti-discrimination provisions of the CAA.\n\nThe rate of pay is at the discretion of the Member but may not be less than $1,200 annually or exceed the maximum rate of pay for interns set by the Committee, which is currently set at $38,500 annually.\n\nThe Member determines the terms and conditions of employment of the internship, including provisions for leave (e.g., Annual, Administrative, and Sick).\n\nPaid interns are ineligible to telework unless an office, as part of its continuity of operations plan, requires employees to telework due to a disaster (natural or man-made), pandemic, or other emergency. All equipment issued to support telework must be returned to the employing office no later than thirty days from the end date of the internship and costs incurred to return such equipment are reimbursable.\n\nAny Member interested in employing a foreign national as an intern should contact the Office of General Counsel at x59700.\n\nPaid interns are eligible for transit benefits on a reimbursable basis but are ineligible for the following benefits:\n\n1. Federal Employees’ Retirement System\n\n2. Federal life insurance\n\n3. Federal health insurance\n\n4. Thrift Savings Plan\n\n5. Student Loan Repayment Program\n\nMRA Paid Interns\n\nInterns paid by the MRA count against the Member’s employee ceiling utilizing one of the Member’s four temporary positions.\n\nHouse Paid Internship Program\n\nThe House Paid Internship Program is an allowance separate from the MRA for compensation of interns. The yearly allowance for each Member office is determined by law. In the event of a vacancy in office, amounts will be available to the succeeding Member on a prorated basis as determined by the Committee.\n\nThese interns do not count against the Member’s employee ceiling.\n\nA Member may place an intern they employ through this program with an eligible Congressional Membership Organization (ECMO). Interns placed with an ECMO must be employed by a Member who belongs to the ECMO and are subject to same to the same federal laws and regulations, House Rules, House regulations, and Ethics regulations as interns who may be paid with MRA funds and program participants performing duties for Members offices.\n\nSee Unpaid Interns.\n\nReturn to Top\n\nPart-time Employees\n\n“Part-time employees” are employed by the Member and their normally assigned work schedule is not more than the equivalent of 15 full workdays per month or the equivalent amount in hours. A typical month has 22 workdays so a part-time employee would be an individual who typically works 15 or fewer full 8-hour days per month, or the equivalent amount in hours (e.g., all 22 workdays, but only 5 hours per day). Return to Top\n\nTemporary Employees\n\n“Temporary employees” are employed for a specific purpose or task for not more than 90 calendar days in a 12-month period, unless extended with the written approval of the Committee.\n\nTemporary employees are ineligible for the following benefits:\n\n1.

The primary duty station for any employee shared with three or more employing authorities is either Washington, D.C. or the District of one of his or her employing authorities, which is determined by the location of the employee’s primary residence. All employing authorities must agree in writing to the designation of the shared employee’s primary duty station to ensure they are aware of the potential cost to their official funds to cover travel expenses if the shared employee’s primary duty station is not in Washington, D.C., or the Member’s District.\n\nEmployees may not be shared between a Member or Committee office and the office of an Officer of the House if the employee, in the course of duties for an Officer, has access to the financial information, payroll information, equipment account information, or information systems of either Member, Committee, or Leadership offices.\n\nAny shared employee who is employed by three or more House employing authorities must:\n\n1. Inform each employing authority in writing of the employee’s employment status and any change in employment status with other employing authorities.\n\n2. File with the Office of Risk Management a signed Acknowledgment of Receipt and Understanding of the Shared Employee Manual and Certification of Continued Compliance upon becoming simultaneously employed by three or more employing authorities. (See Acknowledgement and Certification).\n\n3.

Employees who are Exempt from the overtime requirements of the Fair Labor Standards Act, as incorporated by the Congressional Accountability Act, are those who are not required to be paid overtime for all hours worked in excess of 40 hours in one workweek. Exempt employees are expected to work whatever hours are necessary to meet the job responsibilities and needs of the Office.\n\n2. Employees who are Non-Exempt from the overtime requirements of the Fair Labor Standards Act, as incorporated by the Congressional Accountability Act, are those who are required to be compensated for all hours worked in excess of 40 hours per workweek.\n\nThe employee classification determination is based on the actual job duties and responsibilities of the employee. For a detailed review of overtime pay and work requirements for Non-Exempt employees, at the request of a Member or his/her designee, the Office of House Employment Counsel can advise an office of the Fair Labor Standards Act as it pertains to that respective office\n\nReturn to Top\n\nFellows\n\n“Fellows” perform services in a House office on a temporary basis as part of an established mid-career education program while continuing to receive the usual compensation from his or her sponsoring employer.\n\nFellows do not count against the Member’s employee ceiling.\n\nFellows not employed by the House may use existing resources but cannot be reimbursed from House appropriated funds. If a fellow incurs an expense as a result of work performed for the Member, the fellow may either be reimbursed by the fellow’s sponsoring entity or a Member may use personal funds as authorized under House Rules.\n\nThe use of fellows is subject to regulations established by the Committee on Ethics. Contact the Committee on Ethics at x57103 for more information.\n\nReturn to Top\n\nGreen and Gold Congressional Aide Program\n\nThe Green and Gold Congressional Aide Program provide paid fellowships for disabled veterans and members of Gold Star Families to work in Member offices.\n\nThe House-funded positions to participate in the two programs are divided evenly between Members of the majority and minority. Although they are referred to as “fellows” and placed in individual Member offices, participants in the programs are considered employees of the CAO and in general, all expenses are paid for by the CAO. These fellows do not count against a Member’s employee ceiling.\n\nHowever, Members may use their MRA to reimburse Green and Gold Congressional aides for expenses incurred during their fellowship not otherwise covered by the CAO. Members may also use their MRA to provide compensation, such as a bonus, in addition to compensation the fellows receive from the CAO.\n\nAdditional information about the respective programs, including application information, eligibility, and other details, is available from the CAO.\n\nReturn to Top\n\nUnpaid Interns\n\nUnpaid interns are ineligible for benefits and are not eligible for reimbursement. The Committee on Ethics regulates the use of unpaid interns. Contact the Committee on Ethics at x57103.\n\nReturn to Top\n\nVolunteers\n\n“Volunteers” perform services in a House office without compensation from any source.\n\nThe voluntary service should be of significant educational benefit to the participant and such voluntary assistance should not supplant the normal and regular duties of paid employees.\n\nVolunteers should be required to agree, in advance and in writing, to serve without compensation.\n\nThe use of volunteers is subject to regulations established by the Committee on Ethics. Contact the Committee on Ethics at x57103.\n\nReturn to Top\n\nEmployment Law & Regulations\n\nReturn to Top\n\nCongressional Accountability Act\n\nPursuant to the Congressional Accountability Act, the following civil rights, labor, and workplace safety laws are applicable to House employing offices:\n\n1.

Pursuant to 5 U.S.C. § 3110, the term “public official” includes a Member, an employee, and any other individual who has authority, or to whom the authority has been delegated, to appoint, employ, promote, or advance individuals, or to recommend individuals for appointment, employment, promotion, or advancement in connection with employment in an office.\n\nEvery employee must certify a relationship to any Member of Congress on a Certificate of Relationship form available from Payroll and Benefits. If, at any time, the relationship of an employee to any current Member of Congress changes the employee must file an amended certificate of relationship form with the employing office.

Similarly, if a Member becomes the employing authority of a relative who was hired by someone else (e.g., the Member ascends to the chairmanship of a Committee or subcommittee for which the relative is already working), the relative may remain on the payroll. However, the Member may not then give that individual further promotions or raises, other than cost-of-living or other across-theboard adjustments.\n\nThe statute does not prohibit a Member from employing two individuals who are related to each other but not to the Member. Contact the Committee on Ethics at x57103 for further information.\n\nReturn to Top\n\nNon-Disclosure Oath\n\nHouse Rule XXIII, clause 13, requires Members and employees to execute an oath of nondisclosure before having access to classified information. Return to Top\n\nPost-Employment Restriction\n\nMembers and employees paid at a rate equal to or greater than 75 percent of the basic rate of pay of a Member for at least 60 days in the one-year period preceding termination are subject to post-employment restrictions. For the current applicable rate and information regarding the applicable restrictions, contact the Committee on Ethics at x57103. Return to Top\n\nPay\n\nThe Speaker sets the minimum and maximum rate of pay by issuance of a Speaker’s Pay Order consistent with Federal law. The minimum rate of pay set by the Speaker’s Pay Order does not apply to interns, part-time or temporary employees. However, for part-time and temporary employees, Members must adhere to the applicable minimum wage provisions of the Fair Labor Standards Act ($7.25 per hour as of July 24, 2009). Interns are not employees for purposes of compliance with the minimum wage and overtime provisions of the Fair Labor Standards Act.\n\nTotal compensation in one month, including regular pay and any lump sum payment, may not exceed 1/12th of the maximum rate of the Speaker’s Pay Order.\n\nPursuant to 5 U.S.C. § 5505, the monthly payroll is based on a 30-day pay period.
