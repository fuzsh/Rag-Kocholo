        "text": "Federal judiciary as per the UAE's Constitution\n\nAs per Article 45 of the UAE's Constitution, the Federal Judiciary is one of the five bodies that comprise the federal authorities of the UAE Government.\n\nThe independence of the Emirati judiciary supports the country's stability and wellbeing. The UAE judiciary is entirely independent and judges are subject to no authority other than the rule of law and their conscience. Cases are handled by the UAE courts fairly and without interference from any power whatsoever.\n\nThe UAE's Constitution and the President guarantee the value of the mission of justice and respect for judges and judicial bodies. Article 94 of the Constitution stipulates: Justice is the basis of rule. In performing their duties, judges shall be independent and shall not be subject to any authority but the law and their own conscience.\n\nAll defendants, whether Emiratis or expatriates enjoy the right to a fair trial and this right is clearly protected in the UAE's laws.\n\nStructure of the judicial system\n\nThe legal structure in the UAE runs in two systems: the Federal Judiciary presided by the Federal Supreme Court as the highest judicial authority in the UAE and the local judicial departments at the local government level.\n\nAt the federal level, Ministry of Justice oversees courts and prosecution departments across the UAE. It appoints judges and licenses lawyers, experts and legal translators.\n\nArticles 94 to 109 of the UAE's Constitution describe the general principles of these two systems and leave the details to the discretion of local judiciaries. Each of the seven emirates maintain the right to choose either to participate in the Federal Judiciary or to maintain its own local judicial system. The emirates of Sharjah, Ajman Fujairah and Umm Al Quwain follow the federal judicial system.\n\nHowever, at the local level, Abu Dhabi Judicial Department in Abu Dhabi, Dubai Courts in Dubai and RAK Courts in Ras Al Khaimah maintain their own independent judicial departments, with jurisdiction in matters that were not assigned to the Federal Judiciary in accordance with the Constitution.\n\nJurisdiction\n\nArticle 105 of the Constitution allows by federal law, for all or part of a local emirate court's jurisdiction to be referred to the federal courts of first instance. However, it is not possible for a local emirate court to take jurisdiction away from the federal court.\n\nAppeals\n\nFederal laws define the circumstances in which appeals against judgements by the local judicial authorities in penal, civil, commercial and other cases may be made before the federal courts.\n\nThe Constitution explains that there are some disputes that must be heard at a federal level by the Federal Supreme Court and not at a local or emirate's level. These are detailed in Articles 99 and 102 of the Constitution.\n\nFederal Law No. 10 of 2019 regulates judicial relationships between federal and local judicial authorities.\n\nMinistry of Justice\n\nAt the federal level, the Ministry of Justice oversees courts and prosecution departments across the UAE. It appoints judges and licenses lawyers, experts and legal translators. It proposes and implements amendments to the rules of procedure for civil and criminal litigation as would serve the interests of justice.\n\nAccording to Article 6 of Federal Law No. 1 of 1972 on the Jurisdictions of the Ministries and the Competences of the Ministers, its jurisdiction involves:\n\nregulating and supervising the administrative and financial affairs of the federal courts\n\npreparing draft laws related to the Federal Judiciary, the federal public prosecution, general amnesty from the judgements issued by the federal courts\n\nperusing the studies, fatwas and all other legal affairs required by the work needs in different federal ministries\n\npreparing major draft legislations related to the laws on real estate, the expropriation for the public interest, penal law, civil and commercial procedures laws, companies law, procedures before civil and criminal courts, laws of protection of literary, artistic and industrial property, copyrights and laws of extradition of criminals.\n\nUseful links:\n\nAbu Dhabi Judicial Department\n\nDubai Courts\n\nRAK Courts\n\nFrom a tribe's sheikh to judge: How UAE's judicial system has evolved\n\nFederal judicial authority\n\nAs per the UAE's Constitution, the Federal Judiciary enjoys full independence and justice is the basis of its authority. All are equal before the law, regardless of race, nationality and religion. The Constitution does not allow arbitrary arrest, inhumane treatment and illegal intrusion to private properties.\n\nThe UAE Federal Judiciary includes:\n\nFederal Supreme Court\n\nFederal courts\n\nPublic Prosecution.\n\nThe Federal Supreme Court\n\nThe first mention of the Federal Supreme Court was in 1968 when both late Sheikh Zayed bin Sultan Al Nahyan and late Sheikh Rashid bin Saeed Al Maktoum, concluded an agreement on a federation between them. Federal Decree by Law No. 33 of 2022 Concerning the Supreme Federal Court regulates the functions of the Federal Supreme Court.\n\nAppointment and term of the judges of the Federal Supreme Court\n\nThe Supreme Court maintains five judges appointed by the President of the UAE, after an approval by the Federal Supreme Council.\n\nThe President and the judges of the Supreme Court cannot be removed and their services cannot be ended except for the following reasons:\n\ndeath\n\nresignation\n\ncompletion of term of contract for individuals on contract or completion of the term of secondment\n\nretirement\n\npermanent incapacity to carry the burdens of their duties by reasons of ill health\n\ndisciplinary discharge on the basis of the reasons and proceedings stipulated in the law\n\nappointment to other offices, with their agreement.\n\nKey competencies of the UAE's Supreme Court\n\nExclusively, the Supreme Court handles:\n\ndisputes between member emirates, or between any one or more emirate and the Federal Government\n\nconstitutionality of the federal laws and the constitutional legality of legislations enacted by local emirates if they are challenged by the federal laws or the Constitution\n\nexamination of the constitutional legality of laws if such a request is referred by any state court\n\nconstitutional interpretations if requested by federal entity or any emirate\n\ninterrogation of Ministers and senior federal officials on the basis of a request by the Federal Supreme Council\n\ncrimes directly affecting the interests of the federation; such as crimes relating to internal or external security, forgery of the official records or seals\n\nconflict of jurisdiction between federal judicial authorities and the local judicial authorities\n\nconflict of jurisdiction between the judicial authority in one emirate and the judicial authority in another emirate and the classification of the principles relating to it in a federal law.\n\nThe judgements of the Supreme Court are final and binding upon all.\n\nDeath sentences must be approved by the President or may be substituted to a lesser sentence in accordance with stipulated procedures. The President may grant pardon from the execution of any sentence passed by the Federal Judiciary.\n\nFederal courts\n\nThe UAE maintains one or more federal courts of the first instance in the permanent capital of the federation or in the capitals of some of the emirates, in order to exercise the judicial powers, within their jurisdiction, in the following cases:\n\ncivil, commercial and administrative disputes between the Federation and the individuals, whether the Federation is plaintiff or defendant\n\ncrimes committed within the boundaries of the permanent capital of the Federation\n\npersonal status actions, civil actions, commercial actions and other actions between individuals which arise in the permanent capital of the Federation.\n\nThe law regulates all matters connected with the federal courts of the first instance in respect of their organisation, formation, departments, local jurisdiction, procedures to be followed before them, the oaths to be sworn by their judges, conditions of service for their judges and the means of appealing against their judgements.\n\nPublic Prosecution\n\nThe Public Prosecution is another component of the Federal Judiciary system in the UAE. The Constitution states that the Federation maintains a Public Prosecutor appointed by a federal decree, with the agreement of the Cabinet.\n\nThe Federal Law No. 35 of 1992 concerning the Criminal Procedural Law as amended prescribes the jurisdiction of this entity, its procedures and the powers of its assistants over the police and the public security services.\n\nSmart transformation of the judicial system\n\nAiming to speed up litigations before courts, the Ministry of Justice had, as of May 2015, transformed 95 per cent of its services into electronic services.\n\nSome of these services include search of status of a case, which enables people to view the hearing schedule online. In addition, it has engines for:\n\neSessions\n\nsearching lawyers\n\neNotary public\n\neFiling\n\neMarriage\n\neRefund.\n\nThe Case Management System (CMS) helps people to file documents electronically, reduces delays in civil court cases and improves efficiency by making information more accessible to all parties.\n\nFurther, Ministry of Justice launched the legislations ePortal (in Arabic and English) which contains all the general legal texts published in the Official Gazette since the establishment of the UAE in 1971. It also provide access to the following:\n\nthe UAE Legislation (in Arabic)\n\nthe UAE laws in English\n\nthe UAE High Court case decisions (both civil and criminal)\n\nthe consultations of the department of consultations (Fatwa) and legislations of Ministry of Justice\n\nthe International Treaties signed and ratified by the UAE classified by countries and subjects.\n\nLocal judicial departments have also adopted eServices for litigants and legal professionals to avail information about all the cases and procedures.\n\nUseful links:\n\nDigital judicial services - Abu Dhabi Judicial Department\n\nPublic services - Dubai Courts\n\neApplication - Dubai Courts\n\nThe system of courts\n\nThree levels of court\n\nTo achieve the full extent of justice, the UAE adopts three levels of courts for litigation purposes. This system enables effected party to challenge the case and present more evidence within the provisions of the law. The courts' degrees in the UAE are:\n\nCourt of First Instance (federal and local)\n\nCourt of Appeal (federal and local)\n\nFederal Supreme Court (at the federal level) and the Court of Cassation at the local level of the emirates which have independent judicial departments.\n\nIf the ruling of the Court of First Instance is not satisfactory, it can be challenged before the Court of Appeal and then the Court of Cassation according to Federal Law By Decree No. 42 of 2022 Promulgating the Civil Procedures Law (in Arabic).\n\nCourt of First Instance\n\nCourt of First Instance is the first degree of litigation and has the jurisdiction to hear all civil, commercial, administrative, labour and personal status lawsuits. Its jurisdiction includes examining statement of claims, authentication of documents, all urgent matters related to disputes among the people and safeguarding their rights. It is also in charge of enforcing judicial execution deeds, as well as executions by deputation or reference.\n\nCourt of Appeal\n\nCourt of Appeal is the second degree of litigation which entitles the litigant affected by the Court of First Instance to appeal his/her case before a higher court in accordance with the provisions of the civil and criminal procedural laws effective in the UAE.\n\nOnly the convicted may appeal the court judgement. Thus, appeal is not possible to anyone who accepts the ruling explicitly or implicitly.\n\nThe time limit to challenge a ruling starts from the day following its issuance, unless the law provides otherwise. The time limit for appeal shall be 30 days unless otherwise provided by the law, and 10 days in urgent cases. The failure to observe the time limits of appeal in the judgements results in the extinguishment of the right of appeal.\n\nCourt of Cassation\n\nCourt of Cassation is the higher judicial body with power to try cases contested by the Court of Appeals. It supervises the interpretation of laws and its proper enforcement.\n\nAt this court, litigants may appeal only on points of law alone, such as violation of law or on erroneous application or interpretation. The appeal must be filed within 60 days of the judgement of the Court of Appeal if the value claimed in the action exceeds AED 200,000 or cannot be evaluated.\n\nAll decisions of Court of Cassation are final and binding and are not subject to appeal.\n\nUseful links:\n\nThe court system in Abu Dhabi - the Abu Dhabi eGovernment Gateway\n\nAbout courts in Dubai - Dubai Courts\n\nCourt circuits\n\nJudicial circuits are branches of court according to specialty and jurisdiction. Each level of court has a circuit to look into the various types of cases such as: personal status cases, criminal cases and civil cases. The division is based on the scope of the case and expertise of the judges. Each court is presided over by a president and supported by a judge or number of judges and administrative staff. In addition, each court has judicial circuits including personal status, civil, criminal, commercial, labour and real estate.\n\nThe litigant should know the category into which his lawsuit falls to determine the court circuit that would hear his case.\n\nThe court circuits are major and minor which differ depending on the value , the type of the case, and the number of judges.\n\nMinor circuits\n\nThe minor circuits are formed by a single judge, who issues first instance judgements on civil, commercial, and labour actions, whose value does not exceed AED 500,000 and counterclaims whatever was their value.\n\nAlso it reviews actions on :\n\npersonal status\n\ndivision of common property\n\nthose related to the claim and specification of wages and salaries whatever was their value.\n\nIn all cases, the minor circuits' judgements shall be final if the value of the lawsuit does not exceed AED 20,000.\n\nMajor circuits\n\nThe major circuits are formed of three judges. They have jurisdiction over all civil, commercial and labour actions, which do not fall within the jurisdiction of the minor circuits. In addition, they handle:\n\nadministrative and real estate actions irrespective of their value\n\ntemporary or summary claims and all other counterclaims, as well as the claims related to the original request\n\nbankruptcy and preventive composition lawsuits.\n\nLabour court\n\nLabour courts handle cases relating to labour disputes in the private sector. They apply the Federal Decree Law No. 33 of 2021 Regarding the Regulation of Employment Relationship and Cabinet Regulation No. 1 of 2022.\n\nLabour disputes usually concern non-payment of salaries and end of service benefits, rejection of leave and compensation for arbitrary dismissal.\n\nWorkers are exempt from paying litigation fees for claims less than AED 100,000.\n\nPersonal status court (Sharia)\n\nPersonal status court handles all family cases related to matters such as marriage, divorce, alimony, guardianship, custody and visitation, proof of maturity, proof of lineage and inheritance.\n\nFederal Law No. 28 of 2005 applies to personal status cases. Article 1 of the Law provides that the Law shall apply to all UAE nationals except non-Muslims in which case they shall be governed by special rules relating to their specific creed or sect.\n\nThe Family Guidance Section usually handles personal status cases free of charge before they are referred to trial at the Court of First Instance.\n\nIf both parties fail to reach an amicable agreement, the dispute will be referred to the Court of First Instance after the payment of the court fee, if applicable.\n\nCivil courts\n\nCivil courts handle the cases related to the financial rights of individuals and legal entities such as government departments, companies and institutions. The cases can be related to disputes about validity, implementation, cancellation or termination of contracts, intellectual properties, lands and mortgages.\n\nThe major circuit of the Court of First Instance is responsible for hearing cases with a claimed value of more than AED 100,000, while cases below this value are brought before the minor circuit.\n\nFederal Law No. 5 of 1985 (text in Arabic) applies to civil cases.\n\nCommercial courts\n\nCommercial courts handle commercial contracts and commitments, banking processes, commercial papers, bankruptcy and its reconciliation issues.\n\nFederal Decree Law No. 50 of 2022 Promulgating the Commercial Transactions Law regulates types of cases related to above issues.\n\nCriminal courts\n\nThese courts handle criminal cases initiated by the federal or local prosecution in each emirate.\n\nFind related laws:\n\nFederal Decree by Law No. 38 of 2022 Promulgating the Criminal Procedures Law\n\nFederal Law by Decree No. 31 of 2021 Promulgating the Crimes and Penalties Law\n\nMixed legal system\n\nThe UAE adopts a dual legal system of civil and Sharia laws, and recently the system has been extended to include the common law as being practised in Dubai International Financial Centre Courts (DIFC).\n\nThe principles of the UAE's laws are drawn basically from Islamic Sharia (the system of law). However, most codified legislations in the UAE are a mixture between Islamic laws and other civil laws such as the Egyptian and French civil laws.\n\nThe UAE civil law system includes all relevant laws which are largely codified and adapted to meet the evolving needs of business demands, locally and internationally. In parallel to the civil dominating jurisdiction, the UAE adopts the Sharia law system, which works alongside the civil and criminal courts, particularly within personal status courts.\n\nBasis of Sharia laws\n\nIslamic Sharia is one of the sources of the UAE's laws. The UAE's Constitution provides that Islam is the official religion of the Federation and the Islamic Sharia is a main source of its legislation.\n\nSharia is derived from several sources. Some of them are:\n\nThe Holy Koran (Qu'ran), which is the principal source, being the word of Allah\n\nThe 'Sunnah', which are the verbal teachings of Prophet Mohammed\n\nThe 'Ijma', which is a consensus among religious scholars regarding solutions to matters not covered in the Koran or the Sunnah\n\nAnalogous 'Qiyas', which is applied in the absence of a basis for a clear decision and which is drawn in conjunction with the three other sources of law.\n\nFederal Law No. 5 of 1985 on Civil Transactions (Arabic) provides that in absence of a provision in civil law, the judge shall pass a judgement according to Islamic Sharia.\n\nThe role of Sharia laws in the UAE's courts\n\nThe UAE's Sharia courts have the exclusive jurisdiction to hear family disputes, including matters of divorce, inheritance, child custody, child abuse and guardianship of minors.\n\nIslamic marriages are also conducted according to the Sharia provisions in Sharia courts, or through the courts' authorised marriage officers (Mazoons) in each emirate.\n\nMinistry of Justice has launched the eMarriage service that helps couples wishing to get married to book an appointment with a marriage officer.\n\nBoth, the Judicial Department in Abu Dhabi and Dubai Courts facilitate online marriage applications and the services of marriage officers.\n\nUsually, the judges of Sharia courts are trained in Islamic Jurisprudence and Law. In addition, the UAE's courts may rely on principles of Islamic jurisprudence in the construction and interpretation of the UAE laws.\n\nInfluence of Sharia laws on the UAE's businesses\n\nIn the UAE, the Islamic laws reflect on the business sector. For instance, the UAE has enacted legal provisions which prohibit unjustified enrichment and transactions that contain excessive risk or speculation.\n\nThree Sharia principles form the benchmark of Islamic economics. They are:\n\nprohibition of interest (Riba)\n\nprofit and loss sharing\n\nuncertainty and speculation (Gharar).\n\nThese three principals have created the opportunity for Islamic finance to grow in the UAE.\n\nOther reflections of the Sharia principles on the UAE's business laws are:\n\nthe requirements relating to capacity to contract\n\nthe conditions for clarity of contractual terms\n\nthe absence of constraints\n\nthe specific conditions governing sale and purchase transactions.\n\nIn addition, the Islamic financial institutions in the UAE offer many Sharia-compliant products. These products are supported by the normal supplementary services such as the provision of cheque books, internet banking and Sharia compliant credit cards.\n\nRelated links\n\nDubai Islamic Bank\n\nUnderstanding Islamic banking - Abu Dhabi Islamic Bank\n\nState of global Islamic economy 2016/2017 - Dubai Islamic Economy Development Centre\n\nState of global Islamic economy 2017/2018 - Dubai Islamic Economy Development Centre\n\nState of global Islamic economy 2018/2019 - Dubai Islamic Economy Development Centre\n\nUpdated on 22 Jul 2024"
