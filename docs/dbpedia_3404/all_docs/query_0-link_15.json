Most nominations are referred to the appropriate Senate\n\ncommittee or committees on the day they are received. Such referrals are guided primarily by\n\nSenate Rule XXV, which establishes the subject matter under the purview of each committee and\n\ndirects that âall proposed legislation, messages, petitions, memorials, and other matters relating\n\nprimarily to [those] subjectsâ be referred to that committee. Precedents set by prior referrals,\n\nstanding orders, and unanimous consent (UC) agreements adopted by the Senate pertaining to the\n\nreferral of nominations may also influence the referral process.\n\nMost nominations are referred to one committee. For some positions, a nomination or series of\n\nnominations to a position are referred to more than one committee, pursuant to a standing order, a\n\nUC agreement, or a statutory provision. A nomination may be jointly or sequentially referred to\n\nmultiple committees. Joint referral has generally occurred when more than one committee has had\n\na claim to jurisdiction over the subject matter related to the position. Under joint referral, the\n\ncommittees receive the nomination simultaneously and may consider it concurrently. All\n\ncommittees to which a nomination is referred must report it to the full Senate or be discharged\n\nfrom its further consideration before the nomination may be considered on the floor. Sequential\n\nreferral has generally occurred when one committee has had predominant jurisdiction over the\n\nsubject matter related to the position, but another committee has had a claim as well. Under this\n\nprocess, a nomination is referred to the committee with predominant jurisdiction first and is then\n\nsequentially referred to additional committees. Consideration of subsequent referrals can be\n\nsubject to a time limit after which the committee or committees without primary jurisdiction are\n\nautomatically discharged from further consideration of the nomination. Certain âprivilegedâ\n\nnominations or categories of nominations will not be referred unless a Senator requests referral\n\npursuant to a standing order first adopted in the 112th Congress (2011-2012).\n\nThis report identifies, by Senate committee, presidentially appointed positions requiring Senate\n\nconfirmation as of July 30, 2021. For each committee list, positions are categorized as full- or\n\npart-time and then grouped by department or agency. Where nominations have been referred to\n\nmore than one committee, this fact is noted under each of the committees to which the\n\nnominations were referred. The lists also include the lengths of fixed terms, where applicable.\n\nSome commissions, councils, and other multi-member entities are required, by their enabling\n\nstatutes, to maintain political balance in some way. This is noted in parentheses where applicable.\n\nS. 679, which became P.L. 112-166 on August 10, 2012, removed numerous presidentially\n\nappointed positions from the advice and consent process for relevant U.S. Senate committees. A\n\ncomplete list of the presidentially appointed positions that no longer require Senate confirmation\n\nmay be found in the Appendix of this report.\n\nIn many cases, the titles, specific responsibilities, and referral patterns for certain nominations\n\nmay change over time. Because of this, the list of nominations in this report should be considered\n\na âsnapshot in timeâ of presidential appointee positions requiring Senate confirmation and the\n\ncommittees handling them.\n\nThe information provided in this report was compiled from the Senate nominations database\n\navailable to both the congressional community and the public at https://www.congress.gov/\n\nnominations; data on departmental and agency websites; telephone conversations with agency\n\nofficials; and the United States Code.

Almost all of the highest-level political appointee positions in the\n\nfederal government are filled by these officers.1 Three distinct stages mark the appointment\n\nprocessâselection and nomination by the President, consideration of the nomination by the\n\nSenate, and, if the nominee is confirmed, official appointment by the President.2 During the\n\nconfirmation process in the Senate, a nomination is usually first referred to one (or, less\n\nfrequently, more than one) committee. If the committee or committees report the nomination to\n\nthe full Senate, or are discharged from further consideration of the nomination, the nomination is\n\nplaced on the Senateâs Executive Calendar and may be called up for floor consideration.3 The\n\nfollowing pages briefly describe the referral process and identify, for each Senate committee to\n\nwhich referrals have been made, the positions that fall within the committeeâs jurisdiction.\n\nReferral of Nominations to Senate Committees\n\nTo start the process of making an appointment to an advice and consent position, the President\n\nsubmits a nomination to the Senate in the form of a presidential message. The Senateâs executive\n\nclerk, acting on behalf of the presiding officer, gives the presidential message a number, and most\n\nnominations are then referred to the appropriate committee or committees by the Senate\n\nParliamentarian on the day they are received.4 Such referrals are guided primarily by Senate Rule\n\nXXV, which establishes the subject matters under the purview of each committee and directs that\n\nâall proposed legislation, messages, petitions, memorials, and other matters relating primarily to\n\n[those] subjectsâ be referred to that committee. Precedents set by prior referrals, standing orders,\n\nand unanimous consent (UC) agreements may also influence the referral process.\n\nMost nominations are sent to a single committee. Occasionally, the Senate has agreed, by UC,\n\nstanding order, or statute, to refer one or more nominations to more than one committee. Some\n\nUC agreements provided for such a multiple referral only in the case of a specific individual\n\nnomination, while other UC agreements applied to all future nominations to a particular position.\n\nNominations that are referred to more than one committee may be referred jointly or sequentially.\n\nIf a nomination is referred jointly, the committees receive it simultaneously and may consider it\n\nconcurrently. All committees to which a nomination is referred must report it to the full Senate or\n\nbe discharged from its further consideration before the nomination may be considered on the\n\nfloor. In the case of a sequential referral, a nomination is referred first to the committee of\n\npredominant jurisdiction and then referred sequentially to another committee as specified by the\n\nUC agreement or standing order. UC agreements for sequential referral can stipulate that the\n\nnomination must be reported out of the second committee within a specified period of time\n\n1 Positions in the White House Office to which the President makes appointments without the need for Senate\n\nconfirmation are exceptions.\n\n2 In the final, official appointment stage, a confirmed nominee is given a commission signed by the President, with the\n\nseal of the United States affixed thereto, and is sworn into office.\n\n3 For more information on the Senate confirmation process, see CRS Report RL31980, Senate Consideration of\n\nPresidential Nominations: Committee and Floor Procedure, by Elizabeth Rybicki.\n\n4 As discussed below under the heading âStanding Order on âPrivilegedâ Nominations,â pursuant to a standing order\n\nadopted in the 112th Congress (2011-2012), certain nominations and categories of nominations are not referred to\n\ncommittee when received, but are subject to a potentially more expedited process of Senate consideration.\n\nCongressional Research Service\n\n1\n\nPresidential Appointee Positions Requiring Senate Confirmation\n\n(usually 20 days), or else that committee will be automatically discharged from further\n\nconsideration of the nomination.\n\nJoint referral of a nomination has usually appeared to occur when more than one committee has\n\nhad relatively equal jurisdictional claims. For example, since at least the beginning of the 109th\n\nCongress (2005-2006), nominations to seven positionsâtwo in the Office of Management and\n\nBudget and one each in the Department of Commerce, Department of Energy, Department of the\n\nInterior, Department of Labor, and Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporationâhave been referred\n\njointly to two committees.5\n\nSequential referral has been more likely when jurisdictional predominance appeared to favor one\n\ncommittee, but another committee also had some jurisdictional claim on the nomination. In those\n\ninstances, the nomination has usually been referred to the committee with predominant\n\njurisdiction, and then, after being reported to the full Senate by that committee, it has been\n\nreferred sequentially to other committees. For example, the Senate has agreed, by UC, to refer\n\nsequentially nominations to most inspector general (IG) positions.6\n\nIn a small number of cases, individual nominations have been referred to more than one\n\ncommittee on an ad hoc basis by UC. A 2004 nomination for Under Secretary of the Treasury for\n\nEnforcement,7 for example, was first referred to the Committee on Finance. After the committee\n\nhad reported the nomination, it was referred to the Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban\n\nAffairs, and simultaneously re-referred to the Committee on Finance, pursuant to a UC\n\nagreement.8 A 2006 nomination to be Assistant Secretary of State for Intelligence and Research\n\nwas initially referred to the Committee on Foreign Relations. Two days after this referral, the\n\ncommittee was discharged from further consideration of the nomination, and the nomination was\n\nreferred to the Select Committee on Intelligence. The nomination remains in the jurisdiction of\n\nthe Intelligence Committee.9 Also in 2006, a nomination to the position of federal coordinator for\n\nAlaska Natural Gas Transportation Projects was initially referred to the Committee on\n\nCommerce, Science, and Transportation. Two weeks later, the Senate agreed, by UC, to discharge\n\nthis committee from further consideration of the nomination, and to then refer the nomination to\n\nthe Committee on Energy and Natural Resources.10\n\n5 The positions are Director of the Office of Management and Budget; Deputy Director of the Office of Management\n\nand Budget; Assistant Secretary of Commerce for Trade Promotion/Director General of the U.S. and Foreign\n\nCommercial Service; Assistant Secretary of Energy for Environmental Management; Assistant Secretary of the Interior\n\nfor Fish, Wildlife, and Parks; Assistant Secretary of Labor for Veteransâ Employment and Training Service; and\n\nDirector of the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation.\n\n6 On January 7, 2009, the Senate agreed, by unanimous consent, âthat the nominations to the Office of Inspector\n\nGeneral, except the Office of Inspector General of the Central Intelligence Agency, be referred in each case to the\n\ncommittee having primary jurisdiction over the department, agency, or entity and, if and when reported in each case,\n\nthen to the Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs for not to exceed 20 calendar days, except that\n\nin cases when the 20-day period expires while the Senate is in recess or adjournment the committee shall have 5\n\nadditional calendar days after the Senate reconvenes to report the nomination, and that if the nomination is not reported\n\nafter the expiration of that period, the nomination be automatically discharged and placed on the Executive Calendar.â\n\nSen.

Bill Frist, âReferral of Nominations,â remarks in the Senate, Congressional Record, vol. 150, part 11 (July 8,\n\n2004), p. 14904.\n\n9 Sen.

Mitch McConnell, âDischarge and Referral,â remarks in the Senate, Congressional Record, vol. 152, part 10\n\nCongressional Research Service\n\n2\n\nPresidential Appointee Positions Requiring Senate Confirmation\n\nIn some instances, different committees have exercised jurisdiction over different positions within\n\nthe same department or agency. (For details, see the committee presentations that follow.) For\n\nexample, six committees have jurisdiction over positions in the Department of Commerce, and\n\nfour committees have jurisdiction over positions in the Department of the Interior. Usually,\n\nhowever, one Senate committee has jurisdiction over most positions in a given department or\n\nagency.\n\nThe appointment provisions for certain executive branch chief financial officers (CFOs) are\n\nunusual. The Chief Financial Officers Act of 1990, as amended, covers CFOs in 25 specified\n\ndepartments and agencies. Of these, 17 positions may be filled through appointment by the\n\nPresident, with the advice and consent of the Senate, or through designation by the President from\n\namong agency officials who have been confirmed by the Senate for other positions.11 These CFO\n\npositions are identified under the appropriate committees in this report.\n\nStanding Order on âPrivilegedâ Nominations\n\nOn June 29, 2011, the Senate adopted S.Res. 116, a resolution establishing special expedited\n\nprocedures governing Senate consideration of certain presidential nominations.12 Under the terms\n\nof the resolution, which operates as a standing order of the Senate, over 40 specified nominations\n\nor categories of nominations are, when received from the President, not referred to a Senate\n\ncommittee but are instead placed directly on the Senate Executive Calendar under the heading\n\nâPrivileged Nominations â Information Requested.â A qualifying nomination will remain in this\n\ncategory until the Senate executive clerk receives written certification from the chair of the\n\ncommittee with jurisdiction over the nomination that the âappropriate biographical and financial\n\nquestionnaires have been receivedâ from the nominee. Once certified in this way, the nomination\n\nin question is transferred by the executive clerk to a separate section of the Executive Calendar\n\nhaving the heading âPrivileged Nomination â Information Received,â and it will remain in this\n\nstatus on the calendar for 10 days of Senate session.13 At the expiration of this 10-day period, the\n\nnomination is placed on the âNominationsâ section of the Executive Calendar, where nominations\n\nreported by Senate committees are listed. The sponsor of S.Res. 116 expressed his view that the\n\nnominations would be placed in this position on the Executive Calendar, âwith the presumption\n\nthat these noncontroversial positions would be [confirmed] by unanimous consent.â14 Anytime\n\nthat a nomination is on the Executive Calendar in either the âInformation Requestedâ or\n\nâInformation Receivedâ section, any Senator, for himself or herself or on the behalf of another\n\nSenator, can direct that the nomination be referred to Senate committee in the usual fashion.15\n\n(June 29, 2006), p. 13597. A subsequent nomination to this position was referred solely to the Energy and Natural\n\nResources Committee.\n\n11 31 U.S.C. Â§901(a)(1). For more information, see CRS Report RL31965, Financial Management in the Federal\n\nGovernment: Efforts to Improve Performance, by Virginia A. McMurtry; and CRS Report RL32550, Homeland\n\nSecurity Financial Accountability Act: History and Recent Developments, by Virginia A. McMurtry.\n\n12 In the 112th Congress, the Senate also passed legislation intended to reduce the number of executive branch positions\n\nsubject to Senate confirmation. Enactment of S. 679 eliminated the requirement of Senate approval of several specified\n\npresidentially appointed positions in the federal agencies and departments. S. 679 was signed into law by the President\n\non August 10, 2012, as P.L. 112-166. For additional information on these two measures, see CRS Report R41872,\n\nPresidential Appointments, the Senateâs Confirmation Process, and Changes Made in the 112th Congress, by Maeve P.\n\nCarey.\n\n13 A day of Senate session is any day on which the Senate meets.\n\n14 Remarks of Sen. Chuck Schumer, Congressional Record, daily edition, vol. 157 (June 29, 2011), p. S4203.\n\n15 For further reading on the subject, see CRS Report R46273, Consideration of Privileged Nominations in the Senate,\n\nby Michael Greene.\n\nCongressional Research Service\n\n3\n\nlink to page 47 Presidential Appointee Positions Requiring Senate Confirmation\n\nOrganization of the Report\n\nThis report identifies, for each Senate committee to which nominations have been referred during\n\nrecent Congresses, the positions over which the committee has exercised jurisdiction. The lists of\n\npresidentially appointed positions requiring Senate confirmation are based on referrals as of July\n\n30, 2021. For each committee list, positions are categorized as full- or part-time and then grouped\n\nby department or agency. Where nominations have been referred to more than one committee, the\n\npositions are noted under each of the committees to which the nominations were referred. A\n\nfootnote indicates the authority under which the referral to multiple committees was made.\n\nS. 679, which became P.L. 112-166, removed numerous presidentially appointed positions from\n\nthe advice and consent process. A complete list of the presidentially appointed positions that no\n\nlonger required Senate confirmation pursuant to the enactment of P.L. 112-166 may be found in\n\nthe Appendix to this report.\n\nPolicy areas are not specified in statute for some sub-secretary positions.16 The policy areas\n\nshown in the listings for such positions are drawn from the text of presidential nomination\n\nmessages and information from agency officials. In these cases, titles, specific responsibilities,\n\nand referral patterns may change over time. Because of this, the list of nominations in this report\n\nshould be considered a âsnapshot in timeâ of presidential appointee positions requiring Senate\n\nconfirmation and the committees handling them.\n\nMost appointments to departments and single-headed agencies are characterized by an indefinite\n\ntenure; office holders serve at the pleasure of the President. In contrast, terms of office for\n\nappointments to multi-member entities, such as commissions and boards, are often for fixed\n\nperiods of time. For those positions that have fixed terms of office, the lists include the lengths of\n\nsuch terms.\n\nSome commissions, councils, and other multi-member entities are required, by their enabling\n\nstatutes, to maintain some level of political balance. This fact is noted in parentheses where\n\napplicable.\n\nNominations subject to potentially expedited Senate consideration pursuant to S.Res. 116 are\n\nhighlighted in the report with an asterisk, noting their privileged status under the standing order\n\ndiscussed above.\n\nThe information provided in this report was compiled from the Senate nominations database of\n\nCongress.gov, which spans the 97th Congress (1981-1982) to the present; data on departmental\n\nand agency websites; telephone conversations with agency officials; and the United States Code.\n\nFinally, it should be stressed that the Senate Parliamentarian is the sole definitive arbiter of the\n\njurisdiction of Senate committees and the referral of nominations.\n\n16 See, for example, 22 U.S.C.
