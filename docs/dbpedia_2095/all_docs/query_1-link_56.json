        "text": "Sep 20, 2021 Â© Ulrich Theobald\n\nGeneral conditions\n\nThe breakdown of the central government in the last decades of the Han period æ¼¢ (206 BCE-220 CE), and the onslaught of the large-scale rebellion of the Yellow Turbans (huangjin é»å·¾) that smashed integral parts of the local government made a kind of self-protection on the local and regional level necessary. This duty was taken over by the leaders of eminent families (menfa éé¥) and self-proclaimed military leaders. Landowners transformed part of the serfs into private companies (buqu é¨æ²) who defended the fortified manors (wubao å¡¢å ¡) against marauding bandits and soldiers. The number of private troops ranked from several hundred to 4-5,000 (He 1987: 150). State armies and the troops of condottieri helped to suppress the Yellow Turban movement, but the unification under the central government could not be reestablished. Thus, Han China was around 195 de facto split up into several regions dominated by warlords.\n\nOne of the most successful warlords was Cao Cao æ¹æ (155-220) who practically controlled north China after the battle of Guandu éæ¸¡ in 200 CE. His son Cao Pi æ¹ä¸ (Emperor Wen é­æå¸, r. 220-226) founded in 220 the Wei empire æ¹é­ (220-265). Cao Cao's army originated in a private contingent of 5,000 men whom Cao personally paid and led against the tyrant Dong Zhuo è£å (d. 192). After the latter's death, Cao adopted the title of regional governor (mu ç§) of the province of Yanzhou å å· and had thus the right to request the production of troops by the eminent families of the province. Some of these battalions, commanded by Li Dian æå ¸ (180-215), Xu Chu è¨±è¤ (195-230) or Ren Jun ä»»å³» (d. 204), constituted the core of Cao Cao's army. Other parts of his army originated in surrendering Yellow Turban troops, like the infantry Qingzhou Army éå·è» established in 192. Cavalry units came from the province of Liangzhou æ¶¼å·, where Cao forced the Wuhuan tribes \"of the three commanderies\" (san jun Wuhuan ä¸é¡çæ¡) into submission. Their horse riders gave Cao tactical superiority over his enemies at many occasions.\n\nThe advance towards south China made the creation of naval troops necessary. For this purpose, Cao Cao trained troops in the use of boats on the Xuanwu Lake çæ­¦æ¹ close to his residence Ye é´ (today's Yezhen é´é® near Linzhang è¨æ¼³, Hebei). In this way, he was able in 208 to receive the submission of Liu Cong åç®, regional governor of the province of Jingzhou èå·, along with his naval troops that were experienced on the waters of the Yangtze. Yet Cao Caoâs whole naval army was destroyed by the unified army of Sun Quan å­«æ¬ (182-252) and Liu Bei åå (161-222) in the battle of the Red Cliff (Chibi èµ¤å£) in 208. In 224 and 225, Emperor Wen personally inspected the construction of boats and the training of naval troops. A further campaign for the creation of naval units in the provinces of Qingzhou éå·, Yanzhou, Youzhou å¹½å· and Jizhou åå· was carried out in 237. Yet the empire of Wei remained backwards in the use of naval troops in contrast to the empire of Wu å³ (222/229-280). The total number of troops of the Wei empire was about 300,000 men and grew constantly to over 500,000 in the mid-3rd century after the conquest of the empire of Shu èæ¼¢ (221-263) in Sichuan (He 1987: 123; Zhang 1994: 11).\n\nThe army of Shu relied on a variety of military branches. Apart from infantry and the less numerous cavalry, Shu continued the use of chariots and supported the training of crossbow units. Because its military strength was much lower than that of Wei, the strategists of Shu relied more on traditional tactics. Zhuge Liang è«¸èäº® (181-234) wrote an own treatise on the eight types of battle arrangements (Bazhentu å «é£å) in which he described the interplay of infantry, cavalry, chariots, and crossbow units. The latter were of particular interest to counter the numerical superiority of Wei and Wu. Crossbow regiments had sizes of 3-5,000 men and were often constituted by troops recruited from the non-Chinese peoples of the southwest (He 1987: 140). Engineers constructed combined arblasts (called yuanrong å æ) which could eject ten bolts in one single charge. The cavalry of Shu was an integral part of the armies of Zhang Fei å¼µé£ (d. 221) and Zhao Yun è¶é² (161-229). The riders were drafted from among the tribes of the Congsou è³¨å and Qingqiang éç¾. Naval troops also played a certain role in the battles of Yiling å¤·éµ in 208 and Jingzhou èå· in 219, but the number of boats was not very large compared with those of the empire of Wu.\n\nConcerning the total size of the army of Shu, a combined size of 250,000 infantry and cavalry can be found for the year 227, but his number is too high in relation to the population size of Sichuan at the time. A total size of about 140,000 seems rather probable for the early time of the Shu empire, and a number of 100,000 for its last years, when the country was exhausted (He 1987: 141, Zhang 1994: 15).\n\nSun Quan relied on the private military forces of the distinguished families of the lower Yangtze region. The early army of Sun Ce å­«ç­ (175-200) of just several thousand man could thus be enlarged to over 50,000 by integrating infantry and cavalry units of Liu Yao åç¹ (156-197) and Yuan Shu è¢è¡ (d. 199). Sun Quan participated in the battle of Chibi with 30,000 troops (He 1987: 148). Around 250 CE, the army of Wu had a strength of 230,000, and the navy had at disposal more than 5,000 vessels (ibid., 152).\n\nAfter the battles of Chibi and Jingzhou, Sun Quan became master over the middle Yangtze region with is formidable resources. The water-rich regions of the south gave naval units a special importance. Riverine naval bases were set up at Ruxukou æ¿¡é å£ (close to present-day Chaoxian å·¢ç¸£, Anhui), and Xiling è¥¿éµ (Yichang å®æ, Hubei). In Houguan ä¾¯å® (today's Minhou é©ä¾¯, Fujian), Sun had shipyards built the operation of which was taken over by a commandant of ships (dianchuan xiaowei å ¸è¹æ ¡å°). At least part of the labourers were convicts (see penal servitude). The ships had a length of more than 20 zhang (see weighs and measures) and were able to carry 6-700 troops (He 1987: 147) or close to 100 tons of freight. One ship was reportedly able to carry as much as 3,000 troops (Zhang 1995: 18).\n\nIn maritime operations in 230, Sun's navy under the command of Wei Wen è¡æº« (d. 231) and Zhuge Zhi è«¸èç´ (d. 231) reached Taiwan (at that time called Danzhou äº¶æ´² or Yizhou å¤·æ´²) to capture several thousand people from the native tribes to serve in the infantry. In 233, He Da è³é (d. 233) was sent out across the sea to the peninsula of Liaodong é¼æ± to establish political and military relations with Gongsun Yuan å ¬å­«æ·µ in northeast China. In 242, a naval expedition was sent to the island of Zhuya æ±å´ (Hainan) to capture tribespeople of the Dan'er åè³.\n\nEven after the battle of the Red Cliff, Cao Cao and his successors repeatedly tried to cross the Yangtze to conquer territory of the south, but the riverine navy of the Wu empire was far superior.\n\nCommand structure\n\nEven if the armies of the Three-Empires period followed the unit and command system of the Han period, the number of troops per unit and the number of officers in relation to common troops was not standardized. Nominal units and their commanders were (list according to Tongdian éå ¸, ch. 148, Bingdian å µå ¸ 1):\n\nTable 1. Military unit system of the Wei empire strength (men) unit commander 3,200 è» jun brigade å°è» jiangjun and å¯å° fujiang general, vice general 1,600 è£¨ pi regiment å°è» jiangjun, è£¨å° pijun general, assistant general 800 æ ¡ xiao battalion å° wei colonel 400 é¨ bu troop å¸é¦¬ sima major 200 æ² qu company ä¾¯ hou captain 100 å® guan é· zhang lieutenant 50 é dui platoon é ­ tou sergeant 10 ç« huo squad é ­ tou leader 5 å lie section é· zhang head\n\nThe highest field commanders 190-220 still bore the titles cavalry general (piaoji jiangjun é©é¨å°è»), general of chariots and cavalry (cheji jiangjun è»é¨å°è»), and general of the guards (wei jiangjun è¡å°è»). These were actually derived from the field commands of the past Han dynasty.\n\nEven if many of the commanders fighting against the Yellow Turbans had autonomously adopted command, Emperor Xian æ¼¢ç»å¸ (r. 189-220) of the Han dynasty accepted them as state officials and bestowed formal titles of command. Cao Cao, for instance, was given the title of martial general of mobile fighting (xingfen wu jiangjun è¡å¥®æ­¦å°è»), while the commanders directly subordinated to him were general-commander of fighting martiality (fen wu jiangjun sima å¥®æ­¦å°è»å¸é¦¬) or commander in his own rights (biejiang sima å¥å°å¸é¦¬). In 196, Cao was given the title of General-in-chief (da jiangjun å¤§å°è») and was thus formally made the highest military commander of the Han empire. Yet because he was only entitled for military command during concrete military campaigns, his actual and permanent general staff (bafu é¸åº) did not belong to the formal officialdom, but was a private institution of Cao. This general staff was also the core of the eventual civilian government of the Wei dynasty. Cao Cao also occupied the position of Minister of Works (sikong å¸ç©º) which gave him the prerogative to commandeer labourers for various duties, including military ones.\n\nThe sections (cao æ¹) of Cao's general staff were supervised by an Aide (zhangshi é·å²), while military affairs were in the hands of a commander (sima å¸é¦¬). Cao's personal advisors in the general staff occupied the post of retainer-gentleman (congshi langzhong å¾äºéä¸­). Apart from that, there were quite a few clerks, scribes, and secretaries. The Western Section (xicao è¥¿æ¹) was responsible for the civilian personnel, and the Eastern Section (dongcao æ±æ¹) for the military personnel of Cao Cao's shadow government. The household section (hucao æ¶æ¹) cared for taxation and revenue, the memorial section (zoucao å¥æ¹) for the flow and archiving of documents, the discharge section (cicao è¾­æ¹) for judicial matters, the standards section (facao æ³æ¹) for courier service, the officers section (weicao å°æ¹) for logistics and the transport of tribute grain, and the storage section (cangcao åæ¹) for granaries. This division of work in Cao Cao's personal general staff was the basis for the Palace Secretariat (zhongshusheng ä¸­æ¸ç) of the Wei dynasty.\n\nThe elevation of Cao Cao to the post of Counsellor-in-chief (chengxiang ä¸ç¸) in 208 strengthened not just his civilian, but also his military power. Cao added the functions of military libationer (junshuai jijiu è»å¸¥ç¥­é ), five chief commanders (junshuai è»å¸¥, called of the left, right, front, rear, and centre), and a left and a right commander (zuo-you sima å·¦å³å¸é¦¬). Yet in both institutions, the bureau of the Counsellor (chengxiang fu ä¸ç¸åº), and bureau of the General-in-chief (da jiangjun fu å¤§å°è»åº), Cao Cao was supported by staffs (muliao å¹å) not belonging to the officialdom of the Han empire.\n\nCao Cao also created two new bodies of troops, one commanded by a capital commandant (lingjun é è», in 207 renamed zhonglingjun ä¸­é è»), and one capital protector (hujun è­·è», in 207 renamed zhonghujun ä¸­è­·è»). These two officials were the most trusted military advisors of Cao and could take over the command over part of the army during military campaigns. At any time, they commanded the bodyguard (qinjun è¦ªè») of Cao Cao as well as the guard units of the palace and the residence city (later the capital). When Cao Pi forced Emperor Xian to abdicate and adopted the imperial title himself, military power was thus directly in the hands of the sovereign. He also left vacant the post of Counsellor-in-chief and appointed men from the general staff to the highest posts of the Palace Secretariat, namely the Secretariat Supervisor (zhongshujian ä¸­æ¸ç£) and the Secretariat Director (zhongshu ling ä¸­æ¸ä»¤).\n\nRegional command was entrusted to members of the imperial house or trustworthy persons who were given the title of Commander-in-chief of all central and exterior armies (dudu zhong-wai zhujun shi é½ç£ä¸­å¤è«¸è»äº). This title was not just highly prestigious, but also made the holders powerful representatives of the court of the Wei dynasty in the provinces. In the later decades of the Wei period, the Sima å¸é¦¬ family emulated the paradigm of the Cao family and abused the revived post of Counsellor-in-chief to create a private general staff from within.\n\nThere was a great variety of descriptive terms with the title \"general\" (jiangjun å°è») added to the rank of commanders. This means that jiangjun was not an official position (guanzhi å®è·), but just a rank (guanjie å®é) used during campaign. Yet in the empire of Wu, jiangjun was a position with command over a body of troops. Many of these titles were even just honorific and did not give the holders the veritable privilege of full generals. Examples for descriptive or decorative general titles used during campaigns were General Suppressing the Bandits (dangkou jiangjun è©å¯å°è») bestowed on Guan Yu éç¾½ (d. 219), General Charging the Enemy (zhenglu jiangjun å¾èå°è») bestowed on Zhang Fei, or General Attacking the Enemy (taolu jiangjun è¨èå°è») bestowed on Huang Zhong é»å¿ (d. 220), all of them being commanders of Liu Bei. Mi Zhu éºç«º (d. 222?) was General Pacifying the Han (an Han jiangjun å®æ¼¢å°è»), Sun Qian å­«ä¹¾ bore the title of General Holding Together the Centre (bingzhong jiangjun ç§ä¸­å°è»), Jian Yong ç°¡é was General Displaying Virtue (zhaode jiangjun æ­å¾·å°è»), and Yi Ji ä¼ç± was General Displaying Culturedness (zhaowen jiangjun æ­æå°è»). In the dominion of Sun Quan in the southeast, extravagant titles like General Overcoming the Bandits (yingkou jiangjun çå¯å°è» for Cheng Pu ç¨æ®, General Crossing the Yangtze (heng Jiang jiangjun æ©«æ±å°è») for Lu Su é­¯è (172-217) or General with a Tiger's Power (huwei jiangjun èå¨å°è») for LÃ¼ Meng åè were common â apart from the very modest title of deputy general (pian jiangjun åå°è»). When Sun adopted the title of emperor in 229, he elevated Lu Xun's é¸é (183-245) title from Bulwark-General of the State (fuguo jiangjun è¼åå°è») to the elaborated title Superior Grand General-Protector to the Right (shang da jiangjun you duhu ä¸å¤§å°è»å³é½è­·), which gave Lu more prestige, but did not enlarge the holder's power.\n\nLiu Bei, eventual founder of the empire of Shu, likewise developed his civilian government out his general staff. He took himself the position of General-to-the-Right (you jiangjun å³å°è»), while his close advisor Zhuge Liang, the great strategist, was General-to-the-Left (zuo jiangjun å·¦å°è»), and had a staff of his own, even if he was subordinated to Liu Bei. Zhuge occupied at the same time the civilian post of Counsellor-in-chief and Overseer of the Imperial Secretariat (lu shangshu shi éå°æ¸äº). When the under-age Liu Shan åç¦ª (r. 223-263 CE) succeeded to the throne, Zhuge Liang took over regency for the infant emperor. He was succeeded in both functions, military and civilian, by Jiang Wan è£ç¬ (d. 246), then Fei Yi è²»ç¦ (d. 253) and Jiang Wei å§ç¶­ (202-264). All of them were allowed to select the personnel of their staffs independently. The staff consisted of army supervisors (junshi è»å¸«), aides (zhangshi), commanders (sima å¸é¦¬), retainers (congshi å¾äº), recorders, and various clerks and scribes. It was divided into sections each of which was responsible for certain military affairs.\n\nIn the empire of Shu, the two highest posts of the imperial army were Army Supervisor (jianjun ç£è») and Protector-General (duhu é½è­·), while the ranks of the capital commandant (lingjun) and capital protector (hujun) were somewhat lower. Liu Bei arranged his armies into four corps, of which Guan Yu was the General of the Front (qian jiangjun åå°è») commanding the troops in Jingzhou, Zhang Fei the General of the Right (you jiangjun å³å°è») commanding the armies in the Hanzhong æ¼¢ä¸­ region, Ma Chao é¦¬è¶ (d. 222) the General of the Left (zuo jiangjun å·¦å°è») with the troops directed against Liangzhou, and Huang Zhong as the General of the Rear (hou jiangjun å¾å°è») protecting the core lands of the Sichuan Basin. The cardinal direction were also attached to the titles of commanders derived from the central army. Wang Ping çå¹³ (215-248), for instance, was qian jianjun åç£è», Zhang Ji å¼µå was qian lingjun åé è», and Liu Min åæ (b. 190) was zuo hujun å·¦è­·è». An alternative epithet was xing è¡ \"mobile\", like Jiang Wan, who once was Mobile Protector-General (xing duhu è¡é½è­·).\n\nThe career of the Sun family started as military commanders with titles like General Charging the Adversaries (taoni jiangjun è¨éå°è») or General Attacking the Enemy (taolu jiangjun). They likewise developed a civilian government out of their general staff (bafu). The highest commanders during military campaigns held the titles of commander (du ç£), grand commander (dadu å¤§ç£) or area commander-in-chief (da dudu å¤§é½ç£), depending on the size of the unit. These titles were extended by divisional indicators like grand commander of the front (qianbu dadu åé¨å¤§ç£) or commander of the left or right (zuo-you du å·¦å³ç£).\n\nEach of the Three Empires had a disciplinary code compiled characterized by the obligation to strict obedience to rules, methods and commands (transmitted by drums, bells and signal flags) and a harsh penal system to prevent any offence of duties.\n\nThe central army\n\nThe army of the Wei empire consisted of three parts, namely the central army (zhongjun ä¸­è»), the exterior armies (waijun å¤è»), and the regional armies (zhou-jun jun å·é¡è»). In contrast to Cao Cao, Liu Bei conducted military campaigns in person, at least as long as he could. With his passing away, the centralized character of the army of Shu was given up, and the patter of the Cao-Wei empire with central and external commands was also taken over by the empire of Shu.\n\nThe capital army included the imperial bodyguard and the palace guard (suweijun å®¿è¡è», jinjun ç¦è»), but also units protecting the capital city Luoyang æ´é½ (today in Henan). In case of need, parts of the capital army also participated in military campaigns. The core of the bodyguard was the \"cavalry of tigers and panthers\" (hubao qi èè±¹é¨), commanded by close relatives of the sovereign like Cao Xiu æ¹ä¼ (d. 228 CE), Cao Zhen æ¹ç (d. 231) or Cao Chun æ¹ç´ (d. 210). Other units obeyed the commander-in-chief (duwei é½å°), mostly trustworthy followers like Xu Chu or Dian Wei å ¸é (d. 197). Emperor Wei created the summary term militant guard regiment (wuwei ying æ­¦è¡ç) for these protective units. Their members, commanded by a Militant General (wuwei jiangjun æ­¦è¡å°è»), were carefully selected and displayed greatest prowess in battle.\n\nApart from the militant guard regiment â the actual palace guard -, the troops of the capital command regiment (zhonglingying ä¸­é ç) and the capital protection regiment (zhonghuying ä¸­è­·ç), the capital army included two further contingents, namely the xxx (zhongjianying ä¸­å ç) and the capital garrison (zhongleiying ä¸­å£ç). These were the five garrisons (wuying äºç), with a strength of 10,000 troops per unit (He 1987: 127). This body of 50,000 troops was not just entrusted with the protection of the emperor, the palace, and the capital city, but also took as elite troops part in battles.\n\nThere were also leftovers of the Han-period five capital garrisons (wu xiaowei ying äºæ ¡å°ç) with the elite cavalry (yueji è¶é¨), the garrison cavalry (tunji å±¯é¨), the [capital] infantry (bubing æ­¥å µ, the [capital] navy (zhangshui é·æ°´), and the [capital] archers (shesheng å°è²), with a strength of just a few hundred troops, and virtually no military significance (He 1987: 128). In the empire of Shu, members of these ancient units even carried out functions in the civilian government. In the empire of Wu, each of these units was commanded by a colonel (xiaowei æ ¡å°). The whole pentade obeyed the commander of the five garrisons (wuying du äºçç£ or wuxiao du äºæ ¡ç£).\n\nSima Shi å¸é¦¬å¸« (208-255), who annihilated quite a few members of the house of Cao in 249, forced Emperor Cao Mao æ¹é«¦ (r. 254-260 CE) to bestow him the title of General-in-chief with the rights of a palace attendant (dajiangjun jia shizhong å¤§ å°è»å ä¾ä¸­), bearing a special warrant (chijie æç¯), Commander-in-chief of all central and exterior armies (dudu zhong-wai zhujun shi) and Overseer of the Imperial Secretariat (lu shangshu shi). In order to raise his military power, Sima enlarged the central army, on which he had a direct grip, to a size of nearly 20,000 (He 1987: 129), while the exterior armies were under the command of persons loyal to the Wei dynasty. In 255, Wen Qin ææ¬½ and Guanqiu Jian æ¯ä¸å (d. 255) attacked the usurpatorious Sima brothers who were sitting in the capital, but the loyalists were unable to conquer Luoyang. At that time, a great part of the capital army â commanded by the Capital Protector - was already residing in garrisons outside the city walls, while the units residing inside the wall stood under the command of the Capital Commandant. The prestige of the two commanders rose which led to their renaming zhongling jiangjun ä¸­é å°è» and zhonghu jiangjun ä¸­è­·å°è», respectively. They were responsible for the recruitment and selection of officers and troops of the capital army.\n\nThe central army of Shu consisted of left and right Yulin \"Forest of Plumes\" cavalry regiments (zuo-you yulin bu å·¦å³ç¾½æé¨), a Tiger Infantry Regiment (hubu ying èæ­¥ç), and a Tiger Cavalry Regiment (hujiying èé¨ç). The commander of the two first, rather small, regiments were called regimental commanders (budu é¨ç£). The strength of the two others was 5-6,000 troops (He 1987: 143). They were commanded by an overseer of the tiger infantry (hubujian èæ­¥ç£) and overseer of the tiger cavalry (hujijian èé¨ç£), respectively. There was no fix post of highest commander of the central army. Xiang Chong åå¯µ (d. 240) held the title of commander of the central regiments (zhongbu du ä¸­é¨ç£).\n\nThe central army of Wu consisted of the Yulin Guard, the Militant Guard (wuwei), the Winding-Tent Guard (raozhang ç¹å¸³), the Guard under the Tent (zhangxia å¸³ä¸), and the Trouble-Freeing Guard (jiefan è§£ç ©), with a size of at least 2,000 troops per regiment (Zhang 1994: 17). The central army of the empire of Wu rose from the private army of the Sun family. After the foundation of the empire in 229, the Yulin, the Militant, and the Tiger Cavalry regiments were commanded by members of the imperial family. Apart from these regiments and the old Han-period five regiments, the central army of the Wu empire included the regiments Below the Capital (jingxia äº¬ä¸), Below the Residence (duxia é½ä¸), the Central Army (zhongjun ä¸­è»), No-Trouble (wunan ç¡é£), and a further cavalry regiment (ji é¨), each of the led by a commander (du ç£).\n\nApart from Capital Protector (hujun) and Capital Commander (lingjun), the empire of Wu knew the post of Army Controller (dianjun å ¸è»). Moreover, the post of Capital Protector was split into several commands during campaigns. Zhou Yu å¨ç (175-210), for instance, was Capital Protector of the centre (zhong hujun ä¸­è­·è»), LÃ¼ Meng Capital Protector to the left (zuo hunjun å·¦è­·è»), and Lu Xun Capital Protector to the right (you hujun å³è­·è»).\n\nIn Wu, the title of commanders of mid-size units was du ç£, regardless whether the unit stood in the capital in Jianye å»ºæ¥­ (present-day Nanjing åäº¬, Jiangsu) or in the commanderies outside.\n\nExterior armies\n\nThe exterior armies (waijun) were located in critical regions of the empire, but were commanded by generals under the jurisdiction of the central government. They originated after the battle of Guandu when Cao Cao nominated several generals to guard the provinces of Jizhou, Bingzhou ä¸¦å·, and Qingzhou he had just liberated from the domination of the warlord Yuan Shao è¢ç´¹ (d. 202). Yet the terms central army and exterior army were only created by Emperor Wen of the Wei dynasty. General Zang Ba è§é¸, for instance, held the title of Commander-in-chief of all armies in Qingzhou (dudu Qingzhou zhujun shi é½ç£éå·è«¸è»äº). The supreme command over all central-government armies was with Cao Zhen and Sima Shi who were conjointly called Commander-in-chief of all central and exterior armies (dudu zhong-wai zhujun shi). Most outer commands were located in the borderlands to the empires of Shu and Wu in order to forestall unexpected incursions of the enemy. Some Commanders-in-chief (dudu é½ç£) were concurrently entrusted civilian jurisdiction and held thus the title of regional inspector (cishi åºå²). Xiahou Shang å¤ä¾¯å° (d. 225), for example, had the field command of General Conquering the South (zhengnan jiangjun å¾åå°è»), was Commander-in-chief of all armies in the south (dudu nanfang zhujun shi é½ç£åæ¹è«¸è»äº), and regional inspector of the province of Jingzhou. In some cases, a commander-in-chief held the command over three provinces, like Cao Ren æ¹ä» (168-223), who commanded the central-government troops of Jingzhou, Yangzhou æå·, and Yizhou çå·, and Xiahou Xuan å¤ä¾¯ç (208-254) was master of the central-government troops in Yongzhou éå· and Liangzhou.\n\nThe posts of commanders-in-chief were usually occupied by generals with a variety of titles pointing at cardinal directions in question, like \"General conquering the north...\" (zheng... jiangjun å¾[direction]å°è») or \"General suppressing the north...\" (zhen... jiangjun é®[direction]å°è»). Persons of high standing were called General-in-chief (da jiangjun å¤§å°è»). On a lower level, the sovereign appointed \"Generals pacifying the north...\" (an... jiangjun å®[direction]å°è») or \"Generals Appeasing the north...\" (ping... jiangjun å¹³[direction]å°è») which had a lower military rank. These titles were known in Wei and Wu.\n\nDepending on the military importance of the region, commanders-in-chief held one of three ranks, namely commissioned with special warrant (shi chijie ä½¿æç¯), bearing a special warrant (chijie æç¯), and with a temporary warrant (jiajie åç¯). The different privileges of these ranks referred to martial law. A commissioner with a special warrant was allowed to have executed any officer of rank 2,000 shi ç³ (see salaries of officials) and lower under his command. A commander-in-chief bearing a special warrant had this right only during military campaigns, but could execute martial low for common troops in times of peace. A commander-in-chief with temporary warrant could not execute the martial law in peacetime xxx (times of war???).\n\nIn the empire of Shu, commanders of the exterior armies likewise held the post of commander-in-chief over certain parts of the territory (Jiangzhou æ±å·, Hanzhong, Yong'an æ°¸å®, Guanzhong éä¸­ or Kangjiang åº·é), but not all of them were generals. In the region of Hanzhong, the military commander was concurrently the civilian administrator, namely governor (taishou å¤ªå®) of the commandery of Hanzhong. Yet these functions of commanders of exterior armies were created at a relatively late point of time in the history of Liu Bei and his empire. The title is first mentioned in 254, but had precursors in the figure of Wei Yan é­å»¶ (d. 234), who was governor of Hanzhong, and Commanding General Pacifying Distant [Regions] of Hanzhong (du Hanzhong zhenyuan jiangjun ç£æ¼¢ä¸­é®é å°è»).\n\nWith the passing away of Sun Quan, the time was over for the sovereign of Wu to adopt personal command. Instead, the empire of Wu followed the paradigm of Wei and created commanders of \"all central and exterior armies\" (ling zhong-wai zhujun shi é ä¸­å¤è«¸è»äº or du zhong-wai zhujun shi ç£ä¸­å¤è«¸è»äº). Zhuge Ke è«¸èæª (203-253), for example, was chief commander of the armies of the provinces of Jingzhou, and Yangzhou, and at the same time regional governor (mu) of these territories. Sun Jun å­«å³» (291-256) grabbed the titles not just of Counsellor-in-chief and General-in-chief, but also that of highest commander of all central and external armies. The province of Jingzhou in the middle Yangtze region was strategically important. Military commanders therefore bore military and civilian duties at the same time and were concurrently governors (taishou) or even regional inspectors (cishi). Critical points were protected by garrisons under a commander (du). They were appointed centrally and commanded between several thousand and several ten thousand troops.\n\nIt is known that in certain regions, news were transmitted by fire signals (suihuo ç§ç«). News of incursions by the enemy could thus be forwarded to the capital within just one night.\n\nRegional troops\n\nRegional troops were responsible to the governors of commanderies and the regional inspectors of provinces, or â in provinces where no commander-in-chief was appointed â to overseers of provincial troops (jian... junshi ç£[province]è»äº). The staff of regional inspectors included å¾äº, ä¸»ç°¿, æ¸ä½, è¨å, as well as å µæ¹å¾äº, æ­¦çå¾äº and å¸³ä¸ç£. The staff of commandery governors included a é½å°, å¸é¦¬, yuanæ¤½, å²ç£éµ, ä¸»ç°¿, etc.\n\nThe strength of troops in commanderies and provinces depended on the size, military importance, and the overall situation. The local armies were in the first place used for local defence, but could also contribute to the central army during military campaigns. Regional inspectors usually bore the title of general and had a company (buqu) of their own.\n\nThe regional troops of the Shu empire were usually private armies of governors, and therefore did not follow standardized rules. Exceptions from this rather laissez-faire policy were the commanderies of Jianwei ççº in the southwest, and Yidu å®é½ in the east whose governors commanded 4-5,000 regional troops each.\n\nRecruitment\n\nDuring the Later Han period, the system of drafting (zheng bing å¾å µ) was increasingly replaced by voluntary enlistment (mu bing åå µ \"to enlist troops; enlisted troops\", yingmu æå \"to enlist voluntarily\"), even if both methods were used side by side. In addition to traditional drafting of troops as part of corvÃ©e service, the custom of a hereditary soldiery emerged (shibing ä¸å µ).\n\nThe precondition for conscription were household registers by which a rough number of able-bodied males could be determined. When Cao Cao occupied the province of Jizhou, for instance, the registers yielded 300,000 households. Yet the central government always had conflicts with the eminent families who defended their serfs and client households against the drafting committees. Another factor reducing the potential of draftees was household evasion by which peasants refused to register by escaping into the mountains. Drafted troops were not just used as armoured infantry troops (jiabing ç²å µ), but to a great dimension for local defence. Liu Bei, who often changed his base territory, was only able to rely on conscription when he secured the province of Yizhou (Sichuan). Yet in contrast to his opponents in north and south China, the population of the Sichuan Basin was rather small, so that Liu had to rely on enlistment and hereditary soldier households to a much greater extent. Yet the intensification of the conscription system was necessary. After the battle of Yiling, 5,000 troops were drafted out of a number of 12,000 households (He 1987: 145). The recruitment of 5,000 troops out of 12,000 households for Zhuge Liang's first northern campaign was disguised as \"enlistment\" (mu), but was nothing else than a 'canton regulation' (zheng). The constant warfare with the empire of Wei in the north resulted in the fact that practically all males of Shu had served as soldiers once in their life. It is known that troops in long-time service were allowed 2 months of leave per year (He 1987: 146).\n\nThe need for voluntary enlistment or mercenaries therefore grew. Distinguished families supporting the Cao regime occasionally offered their private units (buqu) to serve the government. Such units were called \"voluntary troops\" (yibing ç¾©å µ) and consisted a substantial part of Cao Cao's army in the early period, with commanders like Li Dian, Dian Wei, Xiahou Dun å¤ä¾¯æ (d. 220), LÃ¼ Qian åè or Yu Jin äºç¦ (184-221). In the case of Liu Bei, Gongsun Zan å ¬å­«ç (d. 199), Tao Qian é¶è¬ (132-194), Zhao Yun è¶é² (161-229), Wei Yan and Huo Jun éå³» (180-219) provided private troops to the corps of the condottiere. When Liu evaded north China and took over the province of Jingzhou, he found much less supporters with the only exception of Lei Xu é·ç·, who helped Liu Bei out with his private army. Sun Ce received support by Wu Jing å³æ¯, Zhou Yu, Lu Su, LÃ¼ Fan åç¯ and Gan Ning çå¯§ in his early years. After the conquest of Guiji, Sun Quan was supported by the distinguished families of the region.\n\nAnother part of enlisted troops came from landless peasant refugees (liumang æµæ°) who were in search for employment. Yet enlistment was not always fully voluntary but can rather be called impressment. Even after the foundation of the Three Empires, individual generals continued to provide their proper regiments (buqu) to the imperial armies.\n\nApart from troops, supporters of the contending warlords contributed credit or money with which armies could be recruited, equipped and fed. Zhang Shiping å¼µä¸å¹³, for instance, a horse trader, lend Liu Bei money to raise troops. Mi Zhu helped out Liu Bei not just with 2,000 troops from among his own serfs, but also with money.\n\nHereditary military households (junhu è»æ¶, shijia å£«å®¶, bingjia å µå®¶) recorded in military registers (shiji å£«ç±, bingji å µç±) were supervised either by the civilian government of the commanderies, or by military personnel. The system had its origins in the custom of demanding hostages (contemporary term zhiren è³ªä»») from the side of generals as a way of ensuring their loyalty. The hostages were staying in Cao Cao's residential city Ye, while their relatives were serving as commanders at the front. In the course of time, the hostage system was expanded to common troops. While the latter went to war, their kinsmen and families were settled down in centralized villages. During the time of Emperor Wen, there were already as much as 100,000 military households, half of which was transferred to the new capital Luoyang.\n\nIn the course of time, these households were providing soldiers over generations, sons replacing their fathers in military service, and younger brothers the older ones. In case of defection, family members were punished. A basic problem of constant supply with troops was the frequent custom to kill baby girls. This danger of imbalance in the sex ratio made an active marriage policy for the military household necessary. The state cared for marriages in order to guarantee a long-term supply of young men. Girls from military households were only allowed to marry men from military households.\n\nFor Liu Bei, military households played an important role because the household registers of the province of Jingzhou were only fragmentary. Zhuge Liang suggested therefore to gather peasant refugees and to transform them into military households from which soldiers could be drafted over generations. They were located in Jiangling æ±éµ, a city conquered by the Wu empire in xxx. Another part of military households were the private regiments of Liu Bei's generals. After they settled down in Yizhou (Sichuan), they were practically transformed into military households.\n\nWhile there was a clear spatial separation between garrisons and civilian households, troops and officers of the Wu empire used to dwell in civilian quarters. The several thousand troops of Liyang æ­·é½, for instance, lived in quarters in Wuhu èªæ¹. The reason for this practice was that the Sun regime depended on the goodwill and cooperation of the distinguished families of the region. This means that even if many units were officially regarded as subjected to the central government, they stood in practice under the command of individual clan leaders. Most of these units were heredity soldier families with their own family traditions in the officer ranks. Such units could be as large as 2,000 troops (He 1987: 152-153). With the stabilization of the Sun regime, the central military administration ended the hereditary character of many units and put them under the command of centrally appointed officers. A hostage system as in the Wei empire was unknown.\n\nParticularly before the foundation of the Wei dynasty in 220, Cao Cao's army grew by integration of submitted troops of opponents. There seemed to be no fear of rebellion or disloyalty because the harsh military discipline helped to avoid large-scale defection. Sun Jian å­«å (155-191) integrated the surrendering armies of Liu Yao with 20,000 troops, Chen Yu é³ç with 4,000 men, Yuan Shu with 30,000 men, and Liu Xun åå³ with 2,000 troops.\n\nIn northwest China, large groups of non-Chinese tribes had migrated onto Chinese territory. Such were Xianbei é®®å, Xiongnu åå¥´, Wuhuan, Dingling ä¸é¶ or Qiang ç¾. Cao Cao regularly recruited troops from their villages because they served to staff the cavalry units. The empire of Shu expanded its territory towards the south (Nanzhong åä¸­), where the males of local tribes could be recruited to fill not just the rank and file of the infantry, but they constituted elite or vanguard units like the \"Flying Army\" (feijun é£è»), crossbow units, or of so-called hunting companies (liesheguan çµå°å®, which could also serve in war). It was the regular case that their families were forced to settle down in the Sichuan Basin where they began to form military households.\n\nSun Quan enlarged his army by integrating surrendering units of his enemies, like after the battle of Yiling, when troops of Shu were swallowed, but also by impressing people from the hill tribes (Shanyue å±±è¶) of the southern regions or even from tribes living on the offshore islands of Yizhou and Zhuya. Among the dominating families of the southern hills, local clans (zongbu å®é¨) resisted the dominance of the Wu state. They acceded in paying grain or cloth tributes or taxes, but refused to deliver corvÃ©e and military service. Sun Quan therefore forcibly compelled them to produce manpower to the army of Wu. It can be estimated that about 60 per cent of the army of Wu consisted of impressed native tribes and men of the zongbu clans (He 1987: 152).\n\nSupply\n\nFood supply and expenditure for the armies of the Wei dynasty were organized one the base of the regular tax revenue of that of military agro-colonies. The supply with weapons was under the supervision of a court gentleman master of metals (sijin zhonglangjiang å¸éä¸­éå°).\n\nIn the empire of Shu, the revenue from the salt monopoly and that of iron were used to finance the army. The salt monopoly war supervised by a salt-supervising commander (siyan xiaowei å¸é¹½æ ¡å°). The supply of grain was mainly to be shipped to the border region in the Hanzhong region where between 50,000 and 100,000 troops guarded the frontier against the empire of Wei (He 1987: 146). The strategist Zhuge Liang had therefore created shipping stations to bring the grain from the Sichuan Basin across the mountains. The state also took care for the supply of sufficient pushing carts (muniu æ¨ç) and carts simultaneously pushed and pulled (liuma æµé¦¬). Yet even then, two of the five northern campaigns of Shu against Wei had to be abandoned because of the lack of manpower for the transport.\n\nThe great importance of private armies in the regime of the Sun family led to a distinct model of supply. Successful commanders were given estates (fengyi å¥é, fengyi å°é) from the income of which they supplied their troops. Eminent commanders like Zhou Yu, LÃ¼ Meng, Cheng Pu or Lu Su were given estates with a size of no less than four districts. When commanders were transferred to another place of service, their received new estates in exchange for the old ones because the land was not a kind of \"fief\", but served exclusively for the supply of troops. Yet after the proclamation of Sun Quan as emperor in 229, the system was replaced by a traditional mode of granting land as a lifelong or even inheritable possession, in unison with a title of nobility.\n\nMilitary agro-colonies\n\nThe devastation particularly of north China during the Yellow Turban rebellion led not just to a drastic decline in agricultural production, but in the consequence also to the need to look for other means to feed the huge number of warlord armies operating in China. As many peasants had left their lands in search for a better living (for instance, becoming clients of eminent families), huge tracts of fields fell back to the state as \"public land\" (gongtian å ¬ç°, see office fields), and could be redistributed. Cao Cao used this chance to transform fallow land into agro-colonies where soldiers cultivated the grain they consumed themselves. He had also transferred peasants to the environments of his residence city to deliver the needed agricultural produce. The funds to buy the needed tools and draught animals hailed from the salt monopoly. Civilian agro-colonies delivered annual rents at a quota of 50-60 % (He 1987: 133; see fencheng zhi åæå¶). They were administered by special officials (diannong duwei å ¸è¾²é½å° on the district, and diannong xiaowei å ¸è¾²æ ¡å° on the commander level) under the central court gentleman for field administration (diannong zhonglangjiang å ¸è¾²ä¸­éå°) and not subject to the commandery they were located in. The system of civilian agro-colonies declined under the assail of the eminent families who tried to accumulate more land.\n\nThere were two types of military agro-colonies, namely agro-colonies cultivated by troops (jundui tuntian è»éå±¯ç°), and agro-colonies cultivated by members of solider households (junhu tuntian è»æ¶å±¯ç°). The former existed mainly in the border regions to the Shu and Wu empires. In peacetime, the troops (including officers) engaged in agriculture, and served as soldiers in ongoing campaigns. The yield of such a group of colonies was, for instance, 30 million hu æ of grain (in a time span of 6-7 years; on hu see weights and measures) which served to feed 100,000 troops for 5 years. The average field size was rather small with 20 mu ç per person (He 1987: 134). Members of soldier households were either male relatives of serving troops (yi å½¹) or soldiers not actively serving (hu æ¶). According to the prevalent rule, only one male member of a household could serve as a soldier, a system called mixed service (cuoyi zhidu é¯å½¹å¶åº¦). Agro-colonies of this type were mainly found in the metropolitan province Sizhou å¸å· and in Jizhou. The amount of acreage per person was 50-100 mu, and the rent the same as in the civilian colonies. The supervision of the military colonies was in the hands of tax commanders (duzhi xiaowei åº¦æ¯é½å°), and the Vice Minister of Revenue (duzhi zhonglangjiang åº¦æ¯ä¸­éå°) on the central level.\n\nThe number of military agro-colonies in the empire of Shu was much smaller than that of Wei and was concentrated on the Han River valley, close to the border to Wei. They were supervised by the governor of Hanzhong who held concurrently the title of Agricultural Supervisor (dunong ç£è¾²).\n\nThe Sun family founded agro-colonies at an early point of time, but there was no clear separation between civilian and military colonies because troops were not garrisoned but lived scattered among the civilian populace. There was also no need for separate administration, but the colonies stood under the direct administration of the officers of the unit in question. Nominally civilian colonies were in most cases cultivated by natives of the Shanyue tribes the male persons of which served as troops if they were physically suitable, or as farmers if not. Yet even then, civilian colony households (tuntian hu å±¯ç°æ¶) could be listed as military households (junhu).\n\nMilitary thought\n\nThe late Han and the Three Empires periods were influenced by military thought as developed during the Warring States period æ°å (5th cent.-221 BCE), yet the military experience of the Former Han fighting against foreign tribes with different military cultures and tactics also played a decisive role.\n\nThe warlord Cao Cao, excellently educated, wrote one of the most important commentaries on the highly venerated Sunzi bingfa å­«å­å µæ³. Cao himself is also said to have written military treatises like Xu Sunzi bingfa çºå­«å­å µæ³ and Wei Wudi bingfa é­æ­¦å¸å µæ³ or excerpts from the military classics Bingfa jieyao å µæ³æ¥è¦, Bingshu jieyao å µæ¸æ¥è¦, Bingshu lÃ¼eyao å µæ¸ç¥è¦. There are also fragments of Cao's book Xinshu æ°æ¸.\n\nThe great strategist Zhuge Liang is credited with a host of tactics to overcome difficult situations in the field. The books Jiangyuan å°è (Xinshu å¿æ¸) and Bianyi shiliu ce ä¾¿å®åå ­ç­ have survived, as well as examples of his grand strategy, for instance, in his memorials to the throne suggesting the conquest of the southwest in order to open up resources, e.g. Nanzheng biao åå¾è¡¨, Qian chushi biao ååºå¸«è¡¨, and Hou chushi biao å¾åºå¸«è¡¨. Only a few paragraphs of his other military writings have survived, for instance, 15 paragraphs of the disciplinary code Junling è»ä»¤, sentences from the Bingfa å µæ³, Bingfa bijue å µæ³ç¥è¨£, 10 paragraphs of the Bingyao å µè¦, and his proposal for the management of supply, Zuo muniu liuma fa ä½æ¨çæµé¦¬æ³. The book Jiangyuan focuses on the selection and education and the duties of an excellent general.\n\nIn this illustrated methods of the eightfold battle formation, Bazhen tufa å «é£åæ³ (also called Wuhou bazhen tu æ­¦ä¾¯å «é£å), Zhuge Liang described the combination and mutual support of different types of troops, namely infantry (the bulk of the troops), cavalry, chariots, and crossbowmen. Original charts are not surviving, but the charts were discussed widely, for instance, by Du Fu æç« (712-770), and brought into relation with cosmology and the eight trigrams of divination. The mysterious character of the tactic was popularized by the romance Sanguo yanyi ä¸åæ¼ç¾©. The idea of the eightfold forms is reflected in Li Quan's æç­ book Taibaiyin jing å¤ªç½é°ç¶, Long Zheng's é¾æ­£ Bazhen hebian tushuo å «é£åè®åèªª, and the book Wojijing æ¡å¥ç¶.\n\nThe bazhen, literally \"formation of the eight [compartments]\", is a development of the basis of an earlier model mentioned in the (long-lost) book Sun Bin bingfa å­«èå µæ³ (ch. Bazhen å «é£). It was particularly developed for use in the mountainous region of the Hanzhong region, where the weaker army of Shu was confronted with the much stronger units of Wei. For this reason, the bazhen model was quite effective in defence, but less applicable for conquest wars or for the pressing quickly forward the front. Even quick withdrawal was difficult (Qiu 2017: 76). This disadvantage can - apart from the numeric and topographic conditions - be led back to Zhuge Liang's negligence of tactics over strategy (Zhong 2016: 74). The eight compartments consisted of four \"orthodox\" (zheng æ­£), i.e. infantry/chariot/crossbows and four \"unexpected\" (qi å¥) formations consisting of cavalry. Even if the basic idea was that these two types of formations could convert into the opposite, the four types of arms had their distinctive characteristics. In any case, chariots (or much more, logistics carts used to form barriers) were used to protect infantry and crossbow units, and not for charges against the enemy. It can also be assumed that infantry units with different weapons (polearms or swords) were arranged in a mixed manner to strengthen the common power of defence. Remains on the battlefield (or just marks for training?) were once seen in Yufu é­è ¹æµ¦ near Fengjie å¥ç¯ close to Kuimen å¤é, Chongqing.\n\nThe eight-part formation (ba dazhen) consisted of 8 mid-size and of 64 small formations (xiaozhen). The eight formations had the names of tian, di, feng é¢¨, yun é², long, hu, niao, she. In flat territory, the eight formations could separate to a large battle arrays with eight parts, while in narrow territory, the eight formations contracted to one single unit. The commanding general was in the centre (by some authors seen as a ninth formation). Behind them, 24 units of moveable cavalry (youji æ¸¸é¨) were caring for protection and sudden attacks. When withdrawing, closely tied chariots and \"antler horns\" (lujiao é¹¿è§) prevented the enemy from chasing the troops of Shu.\n\nNonetheless, Zhuge Liang's eight-formations tactics was so famous that during the conquest of Shu in 263, Chen Xie é³å° from Wei was sent out to secure documents on this tactics which consisted of charts and descriptive text. The method was also applied in the subsequent centuries, as for instance, by Ma Long é¦¬é during his conquest of Liangzhou in 279, by Huan Wen æ¡æº« in the battle of Baidicheng ç½å¸å in 346, and Gao LÃ¼ é«é­ and Diao Yong åé during the Southern and Northern Wei dynasties period.\n\nSources:\n\nQiu Jianmin é±åæ (2017). \"Zhuge Liang Bazhentu de zuozhan buzhen yuanze è¯¸èäº®å «éµå¾çä½æå¸éµåå\", Junshi lishi åäºåå², 2017 (4): 71-76.\n\nTian Zhaolin ç°æ­æ (1999). \"Zhuge Liang de bazhentu è¯¸èäº®çå «éµå¾\", Junshi lishi yanjiu åäºåå²ç ç©¶, 1999 (2): 122-125.\n\nYu Daji ä½å¤§å (1994). \"Zhuge Liang Bazhen tu ji zhenfa shitan è¯¸èäº®å «éµå¾åéµæ³è¯æ¢\", Zhongguo shi yanjiu ä¸­å½å²ç ç©¶, 1994 (3): 24-32."
