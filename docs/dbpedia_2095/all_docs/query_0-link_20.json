In 1923 the third party congress decided that our party would cooperate with the Kuomintang [KMT]. In 1924, Dr Sun Yat-sen's KMT, aided by our party, the Communist International and the CPSU, formulated a revolu- tionary policy to unite with Russia and the communists and to support the revolution of peasants and workers and reorganized and formed an alliance composed of various democratic classes. Thus, the first KMT-CCP coopera- tion was shaping up, and the great revolution of China was set off. At that time, the KMT's meager resources were nearly exhausted and had to be rebuilt. Therefore, the KMT, out of necessity, cooperated with us in order to obtain our assistance. During the great revolution in China, the Central Committee of our party organized a Military Commission, and the Soviet Union sent military advisers to China. The KMT, with the support of our party, founded the Huangpu Military Academy, established the National Revolutionary Army and reorganized the old army. When the northern expedition was launched, the KMT already had six armies.1 A great number of Communist Party members were sent to do political work at the military academy and in the armed forces. In some armies, units from the company level up to the army level all had Communist Party members as party representatives. This fact shows that ever since that time, our party began to pay attention to military work, to do revolutionary political work in the armed forces, to unite the armed forces with the people and to integrate the revolutionary armed struggle with the mass struggle. It was precisely because of this fact that the northern expedition swiftly developed with a violent force and won a tremendous victory. The victory was not just something fortuitous. It was the result of our party using Marxism-Leninism as a guide and the armed forces using the Soviet Red Army of that time as their example. At that time, although our party had neither experience in, nor paid Approved For Release 2008/03/19: CIA-RDP04-0146OR000100350001-9 Approved For Release 2008/03/19: CIA-RDP04-0146OR000100350001-9 sufficient attention to, controlling the armed forces, it did come into contact with the problem and began to do something about it. Therefore, in studying the party's military history, it is necessary to begin with these basic historical facts. Chiang Kai-shek, taking advantage of the mistakes committed by our party's rightist opportunist leaders and after mapping out a series of conspiracies, at long last betrayed the revolution in April 1927 and carried out massacres of the people. Many workers, peasants and Communist Party members were slaughtered. Wang Jingwei openly turned anticommunist in July and also carried out massacres of the people. Thus, the KMT-CCP cooperation was completely broken. A large number of Communist Party members were purged from the northern expedition army. They had nowhere to turn. To salvage the revolution and cope with the pressing situation, we realized that an uprising was the only solution, and the party decided to launch an uprising in Nanchang on 1 August. At that time, there was very little time for making and implementing the decision. As we look back on it now, the timing for the uprising was a little too late. After the Nanchang uprising, the forces involved in the uprising all went south to seek foreign aid in Guangdong's Shantou. But they were defeated in Guangdong's Chaozhou-Shantou area. An important lesson learned from this defeat was that these forces did not unite with Jiangxi's peasant movement but went to Guangdong instead. If these forces had taken advantage of the contradictions existing among the warlords themselves and had launched peasant movements in various localities in Jiangxi, solved the land problem, built revolutionary bases and reorganized their forces, it would have been quite possible for them to succeed. After the forces involved in the uprising entered Guangdong, they divided into two parts. The main force advanced to the Shantou-Jieyang area while the other part commanded by me was stationed in Sanheba. Upon hearing that our main force was attacked by the enemy in Chaozhou and Shantou, we immediately marched south to their aid from Sanheba. Only after we arrived at Raoping and met a part of the main force of about 200 men who were retreating from the Chaozhou-Shantou area did we learn that our main force had been routed and scattered. Our force, now totaling a little over 2,000 men including the 200 from the main force that joined us, turned back north and, after engaging an enemy division in the ancient city of Wuping, arrived at Tianxinyu in Jiangxi's Anyuan County. By that time, the morale of our men had sunk further. Our badly battered force, which consisted of three parts--one part commanded by Zhou Shi, one part from the main force that pulled out from the Chaozhou-Shantou area and one part commanded by me--was in total disarray. Some had deserted while others asked to leave. Faced with such a situation, we conducted an initial reorganization at Tianxinyu, held a soldiers' meeting, explained the situation and mission of the revolution and pointed out that the final victory would surely be ours, so as to boost morale and steady our confi- dence. After the initial reorganization, we continued our westward march, Approved For Release 2008/03/19: CIA-RDP04-0146OR000100350001-9 Approved For Release 2008/03/19: CIA-RDP04-0146OR000100350001-9 and passing through Xinfeng, we arrived at Dayu at the end of October and reorganized our forces. First, we reorganized the party and CYL organiza- tions, set up party branches and organized all our men into a column [zong dui 4912 7130] consisting of two subcolumns [dui 7130]. Then we advanced to Shangbao in Chongyi County. The reorganization and training of the contingent of men that survived the Nanchang uprising did not materialize until it arrived at Shangbao. After 3 months of marching and fighting since the Nanchang uprising, we did not o find a place to settle down until we arrived in Shangbao. It gave us some time for reorganization and training. First, we strengthened discipline, stipulating that all funds contributed and materials captured must be turned over to the public. Next, we conducted military training. A major training course was conducted every 2 days and regular training was con- ducted every day. To meet objective requirements, new tactics were pro- posed. They mainly dealt with how to turn major battles into minor ones by adopting guerrilla warfare and how to change the single-line battle array into the wedge-shaped battle array. Of course, all this was only in the embryonic stage. It was Chairman Mao who later systematically and com- pletely solved guerrilla warfare and even the entire strategic problem. Thanks to. the reorganization and training, our forces were united, their discipline strengthened and their combat effectiveness enhanced. Mean- while, a battalion, commanded by Wu Zhonghao, of the worker-peasant army directly led by Chairman Mao, joined us in our reorganization and training. Prior to the Nanchang uprising, Fan Shisheng's 16th Army stationed in southern Hunan had maintained a united front relationship with our party, and our party had also maintained organizations in the 16th Army. Fan Shisheng had also intended to join our incursion into Guangdong. After the Nanchang uprising and the incursion of our forces into Guangdong, Comrade Zhou Enlai wrote us a letter of introduction which would be presented to Fan Shisheng's troops if and when we could make contact with them. Fan Shisheng was an old acquaintance of mine. We were schoolmates in the Yunnan army training school and took part in the 1911 revolution together. After we arrived at Shangbao, Fan Shisheng sent Wei Bocui, a Communist Party member working among his troops, to contact us in the hope of cooperating with us. After the matter was discussed in our party organization, we agreed to cooperate with him and signed an agreement. After that, our troops moved to Rucheng in southern Hunan and cooperated with Fan Shisheng's troops. We disguised ourselves under a falsified regimental designation of his troops. Our cooperation with Fan Shisheng was conditional. The terms were agreed upon during the talks. We were communist troops, thus at any time our party wanted us to leave, we had to leave. We had complete control over all supplies Fan Shisheng provided us. We held the sole power to decide the internal organization and training of our troops, and Fan Shisheng would never interfere. In fact, all these conditions were honored.

Another example, in preparation for the southern Hunan insurrection, we held a meeting in Rucheng of party secretaries of county party committees under the jurisdic- tion of Hengyang to discuss and plan for the insurrection. Still another example, when Huang Shaoxiong was about to attack Fan's troops, Fan wanted us to be his rear guard; we replenished our supplies with the great amount of materials left behind by Fan's troops. All this showed that we could decide our own actions without restrictions set by anyone else. Our cooperation with Fan Shisheng was of great benefit to us. First, we could lie low for awhile (I used an assumed name Wang Kai), catch our breath for reorganization and bide our time for another chance. Second, we could replenish our supplies. During our cooperation, he gave us 2 months' pay and replenished our bedding, clothing and ammunition. When we left, he gave us several tens of thousands of dollars in cash for our travel expenses. In December 1927, we received our party's directive to support the Guangzhou uprising. While still on our way to Guangzhou, we heard that the uprising had failed, and we stayed in Shaoguan. Not long afterwards, we left Fan's troops and entered southern Hunan to organize the southern Hunan insurrection. On the eve of our departure, Fan Shisheng wrote us a letter to express his sincerity. I can still recall the gist of that letter: 1) \"Who can so unite it? He who has no pleasure in killing can so unite it.\"2 2) To prevent losses to your troops, it was better for you to take the main route instead of trails. 3) Final victory belongs to you, but at present I cannot help you, although I would very much like to do so. After leaving Fan's troops, we traveled north from Shaoguan, with a plan to find a base area in southern Hunan. At that time, Gong Chu3 joined our unit. He led the way and took us to Yangjiazhaizi in Yizhang County where Chairman Yang Zida of the Yizhang County peasant association lived. He played an important role in letting us stay at Yangjiazhaizi. After reaching Yangjiazhaizi, we decided to organize an insurrection in Yizhang County. In the county, there was a person by the name of Hu Shaohai who formerly served as battalion commander under Cheng Qian's command and who was known to the local evil gentry. One day in mid-January 1928, we informed Hu Shaohai that we were going to have our troops masquerade as a unit of the National Revolutionary Army and move to the seat of the Yizhang County government. When members of the local evil gentry heard of Hu Shaohai leading troops back, they came out of the city to greet us, welcomed our troops into the city and invited us to dinner. At the dinner, we arrested all the members of the evil gentry and govern- ment officials and launched the Yizhang insurrection. Following the insurrection, we promptly set up the Yizhang County soviet government and founded the 1st Division of the Workers' and Peasants' Revolutionary Army, thus firing the first shot in the southern Hunan insurrection. Approved For Release 2008/03/19: CIA-RDP04-0146OR000100350001-9 Approved For Release 2008/03/19: CIA-RDP04-0146OR000100350001-9 After the Yizhang insurrection, Xu Kexiang, an executioner in the Mari incident, came with his troops from Pingshi to attack us. Our comrades and the broad masses hated Xu Kexiang to the marrow of their bones. After hearing of fighting against Xu Kexiang, their morale was unprecedentedly high and they vied with one another in participating in the fight. Xu Kexiang deployed his six regiments of troops in a long line, which made it easy for us to wipe out his regiments one by one. Thus, once we engaged his troops, we quickly routed an advance regiment of his troops and then pursued and attacked the rest of his troops. In the pursuit, we crushed all.of his six regiments one by one. When we pursued Xu Kexiang and his troops to Pingshi, his troops were thrown into great confusion and were utterly routed. Pingshi was a gorge where there were no crossroads. The enemy troops could flee only along the gorge. So we kept pursuing them to the bank of Lechang River where we had to stop. This battle was fought excellently. We captured many enemy troops, some of whom joined our unit. At Pingshi in particular, we-captured all Xu Kexiang's warehouses and replenished and armed ourselves with materials and weapons in the ware- houses. We seized not only machineguns but mortars and artillery pieces as well. It can be said that Xu Kexiang helped us to build up. The good news of wiping out Xu Kexiang's troops soon got around in southern Hunan. Local party organizations in southern Hunan's various counties contacted us and asked us to build local armed forces. We supported them in doing so. We first helped Yizhang County organize a local regiment. After taking Chenzhou, we then helped Chenzhou organize a local regiment. Later, we successively captured the county seats of Leiyang, Zixing, Yongxing, Guidong and Rucheng and also launched insurrections in Chaling, Anren and Lingxian. The masses in 11 counties went into action and organized their local armed forces. Under the leadership of local party organizations, these local armed forces overthrew local tyrants and-evil gentry as well as the local reactionary governments and set up soviet governments. This is what the southern Hunan insurrection in early 1928 was about (called the year-end insurrection at that time). The southern Hunan insurrection took place at a time when a war had broken out between warlords Bai Chongxi and Tang Shengzhi. So the situation was favorable for us. If the policy and line had been correct, it would have been possible for us to continue to exploit the victory and to consolidate our position in some localities under the given conditions. However, the erroneous left-putschist line alienated the masses from us, thus isolating us. As a result, the revolutionary forces had to withdraw from southern Hunan shortly after the insurrection. The troops we saved from the Nanchang uprising and the local armed forces in southern Hunan successfully joined forces with the Workers' and Peasants' Revolutionary Army under Chairman Mao's direct leadership at Longshi, Ninggang County, on 28 April 1928. On 4 May, we held a grand joining- forces meeting at Lonshi and announced the founding of the 4th Corps of the Workers' and Peasants' Revolutionary Army (the corps was redesignated Approved For Release 2008/03/19: CIA-RDP04-0146OR000100350001-9 Approved For Release 2008/03/19: CIA-RDP04-01460R000100350001-9 as the 4th Red Army later). The main force of our Workers' and Peasants' Red Army had since grown in.strength and become stronger and stronger with each passing day. It scored many important victories in the struggle to consolidate and develop the base area in Jinggangshan. After we joined forces, we won the first battle in early May 1928 when a unit of the 4th Red Army wiped out a battalion of the enemy's 27th Division under Yang Ruxuan's command near Huangao. Following that, this unit put an enemy regiment to rout along the Wudu River. Our troops pursued and attacked enemy troops in the wake of victory and captured Yongxin city far the first time. During this battle, our troops wiped out and routed three enemy regiments. In late May 1928, the enemy troops under Yang Ruxuan's command launched an attack on us from Yongxin. Our 28th Regiment went to the aid of a battalion which was sent to Chaling, Hunan, for newsprint and had not yet returned to Jinggangshan at that time. After learning of the enemy attack, the regiment made a rapid march back to Caoshiao, 15 li from Yongxin city, and wiped out a battalion of the enemy's 79th Regiment by attacking it from the rear. Hu Zidang, commander of the enemy regiment, was killed on the spot. The enemy troops fled helter-skelter, and we pursued them to Yongxin city. It was said that Yang Ruxuan was listening to a phonograph record when our troops stormed into the city and killed his foreign-bred dog. He was wounded by a stray bullet while climbing over the city wall to flee. Thus, we took Yongxin city for the second time. We seized a lot of booty, including more than 50,000 silver dollars. The following morning we withdrew from Yongxin city on our own initiative. Nearly 10 regiments of Chiang Kai-shek's troops in Hunan and Jiangxi launched an attack on Jinggangshan in June 1928. The enemy used the three regiments under Yang Ruxuan's command as the main attack force to attack our positions at Laoqixiling. Two regiments under Yang Chisheng's command launched a secondary attack on our positions at Xinqixiling. The 29th Regiment and a battalion of the 31st Regiment were assigned to defend Xinqixiling and the 28th Regiment was given the task of defending Laoqixiling. The fighting started before dawn on 22 June 1928 (the Dragon Boat Festival fell on that day) and lasted until dark. At noon, our 28th Regiment defending Laogixiling first put to rout the main attack force of three enemy regiments which fled in disorder toward Yongxin city. At this time, our 29th Regiment and a battalion of the 31st Regiment defending Xinqixiling also launched a counterattack and forced the enemy troops to retreat in disorder. These enemy troops attempted to flee through Longyuankou, but our 28th Regiment outflanked, them there, thus cutting off their retreat and annihilating most of them. Our troops pursued the enemy troops to Yongxin and took the city for the third time. Thus, we smashed the siege by the enemy. These are the well-known great victories won at Qixiling and Longyuankou.

Party leaders, including great Marxist and proletarian strategist Mao Zedong, Zhou Enlai, Liu Shaoqi and Zhu De rendered indelible services to the founding and development of the PLA. As the 55th anniversary of the founding of our army draws near, all commanders and fighters of the army, while recalling the past eventful years, cherish with boundless feelings the memory of proletarian revolutionaries of the older generation who bent their backs for the cause of liberation of the people of all nationalities throughout the country until their dying day and of innumerable revolu- tionary martyrs. Just as the resolution unanimously approved by the 6th Plenary Session of the 11th CPC Central Committee pointed out,,the Chinese revolution was victorious mainly because we relied on a people's army led by the CPC; an army of a completely new type and enjoying flesh-and-blood ties with the people, to defeat a formidable. enemy through protracted people's war. History has proved that without such an army, the people would have nothing and it would have been impossible to achieve the liberation of our people and the independence of our country. Today, the people of the whole country are pleased to see that the PLA--a people's army--has undergone new development and improvement in the new historical conditions, developing from a purely land force into a composite force that includes air and naval forces and other technical branches. Apart from being equipped with excellent conventional weapons produced by China itself, we also possess sophisticated strategic weapons such as atomic and hydrogen bombs and LRBM's for self-defense. It can be predicted that on the basis of the further development of the national economy, the degree of modernization of the PLA is sure to be further enhanced.

Under the leadership of the CPC Central Committee and its Military Commission, the whole army has conscientiously studied and implemented the various principles and policies of the party. The army has paid special attention to implementing the guidelines of the 3d and 6th Plenary Sessions of the 11th CPC Central Committee, guiding the troops to more conscientiously uphold the four basic principles and unifying the ideas on the basis of the basic conclusion of the \"Resolution on Certain Questions in the History of Our Party Since the Founding of the PRC.\" While constantly eliminating the influence remaining from the \"leftist\" guiding ideology, the whole army has resolutely repudiated and overcome bourgeois liberalization and other erroneous ideological tendencies so that the troops' political conscious- ness and understanding of policy have been markedly raised. The various PLA units have extensively launched an activity of building socialist spiritual civilization centering on having ideals, paying attention to morality and observing discipline. A large number of new people of the Lei Feng type have emerged. Quite a few PLA units have penetratingly conducted patriotic education. characterized by the principle that state interests are above everything. This has played a marked role in heighten- ing the sense of national self-respect and pride and in understanding the superiority of China's socialist system. In the struggles to resist natural disasters in some areas of the country, the numerous cadres and fighters have, with their own practical actions, fulfilled the aim of army building--wholehearted service to the people--and forged closer links between the army and government and between the army and people. The various activities, such as building the army on a regular basis and con- ducting military and political training, have improved sense of discipline and organization and have effectively raised combat effectiveness. The military exercises successfully held in north China and in a few other areas have marked our army's step forward in improving the capability of concerted operations among various branches of the armed forces and. in employing the means of modern warfare. Vigorously supported by the broad masses of the people, our army has triumphantly fulfilled the tasks of defending our coastline and frontiers, the tranquility of our motherland and the four modernizations drive. The victories in battles of self- defense at the Fakashan and Koulinshan Mountains have added new glories to the 1 August army flag. All this has proved that the PLA created and led by the CPC and armed with Mao Zedong Thought is a completely trust- worthy powerful people's armed force with fine training and strong combat effectiveness. The cadres and fighters of the army are most obedient to the party and people and go wherever the party directs them. The com- manders and fighters fight where there is greatest hardship and danger. This PRC armed force, that belongs to and is loyal to the people, is like a steel great wall reliably defending our people's peaceful labor and socialist modernization. Recalling the 55 years of the army's history, one could say it is a history of progressing., from small to big, from weak to strong, and from \"millet Approved For Release 2008/03/19: CIA-RDP04-0146OR000100350001-9 Approved For Release 2008/03/19: CIA-RDP04-0146OR000100350001-9 plus rifles\" to the building of a modern revolutionary army. Under the guidance of Mao Zedong Thought, we attach importance to the decisive role of the human factor in war, but we never overlook the important role of weapons, We lay stress on defeating with inferior equipment an enemy equipped with superior weapons and we constantly strive, where objective conditions permit, to improve the army's capability of fighting modern warfare and push forward army building. As far back as during the infant period of the Red Army, Comrade Mao Zedong pointed out: \"We oppose efforts to halt the Red Army at the old stage and strive to develop the Red Army to a new stage.\" In the early period of the war of resistance against Japan, when there was an extremely great disparity in strength between the enemy and ourselves, Comrade Mao Zedong pointed out in \"On Protracted War\": \"The reform of our military system requires its modernization and improved technical equipment, without which we cannot drive the enemy back across the Yalu River.\" Later, on many occasions, he again said: The Chinese army should also gradually be provided with modern technology, equipment and specifically military attainments. The great foresight of the party leader and the unflagging revolutionary drive of the numerous cadres and fighters ensured that, even under extremely difficult condi- tions, our army always made every effort to improve the combat capability of the troops. In those years, when the poorly equipped worker and peasant Red Army, hemmed in by massive enemy troops, succeeded in seizing from the enemy the first radio transceiver, they took good care of it and, after assiduously learning how to operate it in a very short time, employed it in directing operations on the battlefront. When many fighters were still fighting with indigenous rifles, broadswords and spears, our army simply and thriftily set up an artillery school with the few guns we seized from the enemy. As far back as in the liberation war period, our army already had its own aviation school and armored troops. These scenes of assiduously doing pioneering work remain fresh in our memory as if they were before us now. Our army has always refused to be self- satisfied and conservative or to halt its efforts at the initial stages but instead, where the objective conditions permit, fully bring into play the subjective initiative in an effort to guide the army building to a higher stage. It is still necessary for us to constantly promote this extremely invaluable revolutionary drive in the new historical period. Lenin said: \"When an army is not prepared to master all weapons and all forms and methods of struggle the enemy has possessed or may possess, this act is considered stupid by everybody else.\" Modern military science and technology are changing with each passing day. Since the fruits of the world's latest science and technology are extensively applied in war, a whole series of changes has taken place in the forms of war, strategy, tactics and military organization. Many unprecedented new situations and special features have appeared in modern warfare. Hence, in an inter- national situation in which the danger. of war still exists, we must greatly step up the building of a modern national defense and raise the army's modern combat capability to a new level. When reviewing the troops taking part in military exercises somewhere in north China, Deng Xiaoping, chairman of the Military Commission of the CPC Central Committee, more explicitly pointed out: It is necessary to.build our army into a strong, Approved For Release 2008/03/19: CIA-RDP04-0146OR000100350001-9 Approved For Release 2008/03/19: CIA-RDP04-0146OR000100350001-9 modern and regular revolutionary army. With full confidence, the comrades'. of the whole army are unremittingly fighting for the realization of this great goal along with the people throughout the country. At present, under the guidance of the 3d Plenary Session of the 11th CPC Central Committee, the work of readjustment, restructuring, consolidation and improvement is being continuously carried out on the economic front and marked achievements have been scored. Following the Central Committee's unified guiding principle on carrying out system reforms, the PLA is right now working hard to readjust, reorganize and restructure itself and-advance toward the great goal of revolutionization, modernization and regulariza- tion. In the course of readjusting and restructuring the army, it is imperative to build the troops into a revolutionized and modern crack force in accordance with the requirements of modern warfare. Comrade Mao Zedong said: \"That the troops are valued for their quality, not their number, is still a principle of army building in the future.\" During the arduous years of the anti-Japanese war, our party rigorously practiced the policy of better troops and simpler administration, reduced the number of non- combat personnel and lightened the burden of the people. This resulted in speeding up the victorious course of war. In. the early period of the founding of the PRC, we carried out the policy decision of reducing the number of armymen and improving the quality of the army so that it was possible for our army to establish various branches and thus strengthened the combat effectiveness of our army. Although the specific conditions were slightly different in various historical periods, the principle that troops are valued for their quality and not their number still holds good. Now people have come to realize that the trial of strength in a war mani- fests not only in the number of soldiers but, more importantly, in modern weapons and equipment and in people's capability to operate modern equip- ment. With the swift development of modern science and technology, there is indeed a tremendous increase in the power of weapons. Following improvement in the level of modern weapons, equipment and the command system, it is entirely possible to appropriately reduce the number of soldiers. Just as Comrade Deng Xiaoping said: A reduction and not an increase in manpower is a sign of modernization. It can thus be seen that practicing the policy of better troops is not a negative or stagnant policy but a positive and advanced one. The policy of better troops is a correct and scientific policy which conforms to the specific features of modern warfare and the law of development of modern military affairs. By a crack force, from the major aspects, we mainly mean the following three demands: 1) There must be people with high political awareness, advanced military thinking and relatively high scientific and cultural accomplishment, and all readjustment and restructuring measures must be beneficial for discovering, selecting and promoting talented people and for making the cadre force revolutionized, younger and more knowledgeable and specialized. 2) There must be excellent modern weapons and equipment. 3) There must be organic integration of men and arms, which means that there must be strict training and scientific formation. After a period of Approved For Release 2008/03/19: CIA-RDP04-0146OR000100350001-9 Approved For Release 2008/03/19: CIA-RDP04-01460R000100350001-9 arduous efforts by the comrades of the whole army, our army will be a crack force with keen wits and capable administrative structure, agile command, excellent equipment, fine training, quick reactions, high efficiency, and very powerful combat effectiveness, and be a hand-picked force that cannot be toppled or defeated. It will be a sharp sword defending the socialist motherland. Human factors still play a primary role in modern warfare. However, it is necessary to understand human factors in an all-round way. They include not only human courage, consciousness and the spirit of sacrifice but also human wisdom, and talent as well as mastery and application of science, culture and technology. All modern equipment, even such high-tech equip- ment as electronic calculators, reconnaissance satellites and spaceships, should also be. operated by man. No precision and advanced weapons can hit the targets with unfailing accuracy. Of these, the scientific and techno- logical levels of the operators are very important factors. The political consciousness of the PLA in undoubtedly first-rate in the world. In the future, it is still necessary to regard political work as the lifeline of our army, strive to build socialist spiritual civilization and conduct patriotic education centering on loving the party, the socialist motherland and the people's army in order to raise the political quality of our army to a new level. It should be noted, however, that the scientific, cultural and technological level of our. cadres still fails to keep abreast of the requirements of modern warfare. If we fail to speedily change this state of affairs, we shall not be able to skillfully master and proficiently operate more up-to-date equipment, let alone bring its efficiency into full play. Therefore, an urgent question confronting us is to vigorously step up the work of making our cadres master intellectual knowledge. The status and role of science, culture and technology in army building is becoming more and more important and outstanding. In particular, the intensive application of science in modern weapons and the ever-changing progress of modern science such as electronics, laser, infrared rays and spaceflight have made it necessary for us to study new knowledge and new technology and to arm ourselves with modern scientific knowledge. There is the importance of knowledge on the one hand and the deficiency of knowledge on the other. This is an acute contradiction. Quite a few comrades under- stand the importance and urgency of solving this contradiction. At the beginning of this century, Lenin wrote a commentary entitled \"The Fall of Port Arthur.\" This famous article vividly described and penetratingly elaborated the defeat suffered by the czarist Russian army in its war against the Japanese army. Lenin pointed out that although czarist Russia had squandered hundreds of millions of rubles on the purchase and building of splendid warships, in view of the fact that both the officers and soldiers proved \"uneducated\" and \"backward\" and \"that there were no people with the necessary technical knowledge to utilize the latest achievements of military engineering,\" the military might of czarist Russia \"proved to be a sham\" and those expenditures \"proved to be antiquated and utterly useless.\" All this shows how important scientific and cultural knowledge is to the modernization of the army. It is hoped that our cadres, particu- larly the leading cadres, will attach great importance to this increasingly urgent problem. From now on they should regard it as a matter of great Approved For Release 2008/03/19: CIA-RDP04-01460R000100350001-9 Approved For Release 2008/03/19: CIA-RDP04-0146OR000100350001-9 strategic importance, concentrate their efforts on it and make sure that the scientific and cultural appearance of our army will change considerably in the coming years. The CPC Central Committee recently decided that in the coming 5 years or so, all cadres working in the central party and government institutions should at least reach senior middle school level culturally and middle vocational school level professionally and that there should be a considerable number of people who have university level. From now on, cadres who do not come up to the stipulated level cannot be transferred to the central party and government institutions; the existing cadres who do not come up to the stipulated level should manage to reach this level within a stated time through study and rotational training. This guideline is likewise applicable to our army. Moreover, as far as the needs for army building are concerned, we should act more quickly and do better. Both men and arms must excel in building a crack force. In the context of requirements for opposing a future war of aggression, we still lag behind in weapons and equipment. We must at all times carry forward the army's fine combat traditions and establish strong confidence and resolve in defeating with inferior weapons an enemy armed with superior weapons. Under the conditions of national economic capabilities, we must also step up national defense scientific research work, strive to improve our arms and equipment and reduce our discrepancies in this respect to the minimum. In his article \"On the Ten Major Relationships\" Comrade Mao Zedong pointed out: \"We are stronger than before and will be stronger still in the future. We will not only have more planes and artillery but atom bombs too. If we are not to be bullied in the present-day world, we cannot do without the bomb.\" What Comrade Mao Zedong predicted has initially come true. We will certainly be able to equip our units with newer weapons as our national economy and military science and technology develop. With further improvement in the level of modernization, the long-tested PLA will be like a tiger that has grown wings and will be in a better position to defeat all aggressors who dare to launch a war against us. Workers, peasants and the comrades in scientific, technological, educational and various other circles in our country will exert themselves and, in their own respective posts, make more contributions to the modernization of national defense and the people's own army. Arms, including all modern arms, are only potential fighting force, they can only become actual fighting force when closely integrated with men. Apart from strict training, this also requires scientific formation. It takes a, lot of learning to more scientifically and rationally form the army according to the requirements of modern warfare. At present, a great many countries attach great importance to the study of military systems. Following new developments in modern warfare, military formation has also appropriately been reformed. For example, since World War II, some coun- tries have abolished cavalry units and established air defense forces and strategic rocket forces; some countries have changed the \"three three system\" of the ground forces into the \"five mass system [wu qun zhi 0063 5028 0455]: and some countries have increased electronics confrontation Approved For Release 2008/03/19: CIA-RDP04-0146OR000100350001-9 Approved For Release 2008/03/19: CIA-RDP04-0146OR000100350001-9 showing that military formations should adapt to the objective situation in the way that people change their clothes according to changes in season. We must broaden our vision of breaking away from the fetters of the force of habit and daring to conduct reforms and be promoters of reforms. The most important thing in the scientific formation of the armed forces is to strengthen their synthesis. Without the synthesis of the various branches of the armed forces, there would be no modernization and it would have been impossible to adapt ourselves to modern warfare. For a consid- erably long historical period, our army has chiefly relied on a single branch of the armed forces in fighting and a lot of comrades have been familiar with infantry. However, in order to direct a combined operation of various branches of the armed forces, it is still necessary to study assiduously and conscientiously. Reviewing the history of our army, we have already taken two steps, the first step consisting of concentrating only on infantry, and the second of independently developing various branches of the armed forces. We should now take a third step, which is to better strengthen the synthesis of the various branches. Since the founding of the PRC, we have established various branches of the armed forces, such as the air force, navy, artillery troops, engineer troops and armored troops, but they basically formed a system of their own and we have not been able to organically combine them together either in system, training or administra- tion. If this state of affairs continues to exist, it will be difficult to adapt to the needs of modern warfare. Comrade Ye Jianying has summed up the characteristics of modern warfare as: three-dimensional warfare, combined warfare, and general warfare. As we understand it, what is referred to as three-dimensional warfare is that as soon as a war breaks out, the enemy is sure to come simultaneously from the sky, land and sea and fight both at the front and in the rear. What is referred to as combined warfare is that war has developed from operations by a single branch of the armed forces or small-scale and limited-range concerted operations in the past to large-scale, extensive-range and com- plete combined warfare. What is meant by general warfare is that war is not only a trial of military strength but also a general trial of strength of various war factors, such as politics, economy, science, technology and diplomacy. These special features of modern warfare fully show that it is imperative to strengthen the synthesis of the army, practice combined operations by various branches of the armed forces and bring into full play their overall might; it is imperative for armymen and people through- out the country to make concerted efforts and launch a people's war under the modern conditions in order to defeat the enemy. We must therefore greatly step up composite training. Every commander, especially the com- manders of composite forces must be familiar with the capabilities of all types of weapons and learn how to employ the various technical branches of the armed forces in coordination. At the same time they must also under- stand, as much as possible, other branches of knowledge related to war. We must further change the idea of having just one branch of the armed forces and establish the concept of composite warfare. This is a profound change. Lenin said: \"In our practical life there are both the feature of extraordinary courage and the mentality of fearing extremely small changes.\" Approved For Release 2008/03/19: CIA-RDP04-0146OR000100350001-9 Approved For Release 2008/03/19: CIA-RDP04-0146OR000100350001-9 We should not be afraid of, but should be bold in, making reforms. We should actively support all reforms that are conducive to the strengthen- ing of synthesis. In making readjustment and reforms, it is necessary to take into consid- eration not only peacetime but also wartime and do a good job of linking peacetime with wartime. In doing everything, such as what is to be initiated, what is to be reformed, what is to be readjusted and how should we do our work in order of importance and urgency, it is necessary to have war preparedness in mind for this helps us to be always alert and ready to strike at the enemy who dares to invade us. Political and ideological education must be geared in such a way that it ensures the fulfillment of readjustment as well as educates the troops to firmly foster the idea of war preparedness. We should also further step up work on the militia and do a good job of the reserve service and mobilization systems. If the enemy dares to invade us, we shall engulf it in the boundless ocean of the people with people's war under the modern conditions. Fewer troops and simpler administration are always interrelated and go hand in hand. In order to have crack troops it is imperative to have simpler administration. It is imperative to improve work style in order to achieve the goal of improving work efficiency and command capability. It is neces- sary to implement the principle of integrating centralized and unified leadership with division of responsibility, put responsibility systems on a sound basis, reduce the number of command levels, and further define the scope of responsibilities of leading organs at all levels. Leading organs at the higher levels should chiefly understand developments and have a good grasp of policies. Principal attention should be paid to grasping problems related to policies, implementing the policies and principles laid down by the CPC Central Committee and its Military Commission, conducting investiga- tion and study, summing up experiences and supervising and speeding up ful- fillment of assigned work. We should not take on the detailed routine work that should be handled by the institutions at the lower levels for this will not only make it difficult for us to do our work well but will also be unfavorable to bringing into play the initiative of the lower levels. It is also unfavorable to overcoming bureaucratism, routinism and the methods of working in a handicraft manner and to improving work efficiency. We advocate that leading cadres at various levels should, within the scope of their duties, be bold in taking responsibility and work boldly. If a person is responsible for the work, he should be responsible for it to the end. We should change the past phenomena, such as unclear definition of duties incumbent to each person or post, inexplicit division of labor, ? multiple command levels, mutual shift of responsibility, the travel of documents from one department to another, long delays in making decisions and passing on difficulties to the leadership. We should consult others on our own initiative on all matters that should be consulted and we should independently, responsibly and on our own initiative solve well the problems that we can solve. Comrade Mao Zedong pointed out: \"Having a clear understanding of China's national condition is a fundamental basis for having a clear understanding Approved For Release 2008/03/19: CIA-RDP04-0146OR000100350001-9 Approved For Release 2008/03/19: CIA-RDP04-0146OR000100350001-9 of all revolutionary problems.\" Just as all things in the world have both their general and specific characteristics, army building in various coun- tries of the world has its general characteristic, but it also has its own special characteristics. It is necessary for the economic construction to suit our national conditions, and it is also necessary for army building to suit our national conditions. China has the biggest population in the, world. It has a vast territory, long coastline and highly different natural conditions. It is necessary for us to conscientiously study modern military theory and foreign military experience. At the same time, it is all the more necessary for us to conscientiously study our national condi- tions, learn and study the application and development of Mao Zedong's military thinking in modern conditions, study the inregration of people's war with modern conditions and seek an army system that suits China's specific features and the principles of various types of army building. It is necessary for us to inherit and carry forward the fine tradition of our army, constantly study new developments, solve new problems and push forward our army building in a down-to-earth manner. Today, the great task of achieving the four modernizations in our great socialist motherland is calling on us. Stepping on the land of our mother- land and bearing the expectations of the people, the workers' and peasants' Red Army, the Eighth Route Army and the new Fourth Army in those years boldly and heroically headed for the battlefield in seeking liberation. In order to build our army into a strong, modern and regular revolutionary army, let us learn from the example of the older generations and, under the leadership of the CPC Central Committee and its Military Commission, advance bravely.

To rescue China from national crisis, our party established the anti-Japanese National United Front. The Chinese workers' and peasants' Red Army the the Red Army in the northern part of Shaanxi were redesignated as the 115th Divi- sion, 120th Division and 129th Division of the Eighth Route Army after they had successfully accomplished the task of the long march and arrived at the northern part of Shaanxi Province. They marched to the forefront of resist- ing Japanese troops and penetrated far behind enemy lines to establish anti- Japanese democratic base areas and shoulder historical tasks of resisting Japan and rescuing the nation. To defend the party Central Committee and nation's anti-Japanese supreme headquarters--the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia border area, the Luochuan meeting of the party Central Committee decided to release some troops from the three main divisions to form a rear corps of the Eighth Route Army. The rear corps formed in September 1937 was initially called the rear office of the Eighth Route Army. The name was changed into rear corps in December of the same year. The rear corps were made up of 1 brigade, 11 regiments and peace preservation troops which were formerly local armed forces. There were about 10,000 people in the force. At that time, there were only 3 leaders who were assigned to the rear corps. I was a commander and concurrently political commissar, Comrade Cao Lihuai was chief of staff and Comrade Mo Wenhua was director of the political department. No positions of deputies were set and our organ was small but highly efficient. All of united as one. Thanks to the loving care and direct leadership of the military commission of the CPC Central Committee and Comrade Mao Zedong, our corps was gradually built into a crack force which was good in political quality and powerful in combat strength and which'achieved outstanding results in eliminating bandit Approved For Release 2008/03/19: CIA-RDP04-0146OR000100350001-9 Approved For Release 2008/03/19: CIA-RDP04-0146OR000100350001-9 gangs, resisting the Japanese troops, counter-campaigning against friction and accomplishing glorious historical tasks of defending the border area, the northwestern part of our country and the party Central Committee. Our corps also provided various anti-Japanese battlefields throughout the country with more than 2,000 cadres to support their anti-Japanese struggle. I personally experienced a life of fiery struggle at that time. Today when I recall the life, I feel that I still yearn for it. The rear corps was made up of troops from various quarters, including the first, second and fourth front armies of the Red Army, the.Red Army in the northern part of Shaanxi Province and local armed forces. They truly came from all corners of the country. Our crack force was good in quality and most of its members had undergone the long march and grown in the environment of fierce struggle. Communist Party members formed a large proportion of the members of the troops. Cadres and fighters had a higher political conscious- ness and acquired the spirit and fine traditions of staunch and hard struggles. However, due to the fact that members of the corps came from various base areas which followed different systems and work styles, there existed the problem of chaotic organizational system, roving guerrilla actions, lax discipline and so forth. The phenomenon of lacking unity occurred from time to time. Under such circumstances, it was our tremendous task to build the rear corps into a regu- lar troop with powerful combat effectiveness. - Comrade Mao Zedong directly concerned himself with the building of the rear corps and frequently asked about its work. Although he was occupied with a myriad of state affairs and was extremely busy, he always managed to find time to listen to our reports and discussed with us the work of the troops. He frequently met leading comrades of various regiments in order to grasp the situation and issue instructions for work. He concerned himself with the consolidation, life, study, combat and production of the troops as well as the formulation of some rules and regulations and took up these matters personally. When I once made a work report on how to grasp the work of building this corps, he told me cordially that the key to turning this army, which was made up of fighters from various quarters with lax discipline, into an unconquer- able and indomitable regular corps with powerful combat effectiveness, lay in whether r7.e could act in accordance with the spirit of the Gutian Congress. We acted in line with the direction pointed out by Comrade Mao Zedong. First of all, we firmly grasped the link of political and ideological education. At the end of 1937 and in July 1938 we respectively held the first and second meetings attended by leaders of the corps. At the end of 1938, we con- vened the first party congress of the corps and in May 1939, we held a meeting attended by cadres above battalion level. In October of the same year, a political work meeting was also convened. In the above-mentioned meetings, we stressed that we should take the ideological and political work of the party as the key link, take part in the two great campaigns of \"production and study\" and accomplish the four main tasks in\"politics, military affairs, culture and the party's work.\" We put forth the slogan of \"doing our best to carry out the campaign of study and build the troops into a combat school.\" Approved For Release 2008/03/19: CIA-RDP04-0146OR000100350001-9 Approved For Release 2008/03/19: CIA-RDP04-01460R000100350001-9 A regular political and educational system was established in the corps and all fighters were required to take four political classes each week and cadres extensively organized their study groups. Our purposes in providing politi- cal and ideological education were 1) to guide cadres and fighters to study Marxist theories with the \"History of the Soviet Communist Party (Bolshevik)\" and the \"Political Textbook\" compiled by the political department of the corps as our main teaching materials; 2) to study further the party's theories on the united front and various guiding principles and policies as well as cur- rent affairs. To strengthen the study of political theories and culture., teachers in charge of the teaching of Marxist-Leninist theories and Mao Zedong works were assigned to various regiments and teachers in charge of the teach- ing of cultural knowledge were assigned to various companies.. We also pub- lished the \"Fenghuo Bao\" and the \"Fenghuo Supplement\" and established the Fenghuo Opera Troupe and art school to enliven the cultural life of the corps. After several years' of political and ideological education, and the great movement for party consolidation in particular, cadres Marxist-Leninist level and class consciousness was considerably raised and various nonprole- tarian ideologies and work styles were continuously discarded. This laid a reliable foundation for regularizing and strengthening the combat effective- ness of the force. In 1944, Comrade Mao Zedong personally summed up the experience of the politi- cal work of the rear corps and wrote the article \"On the Political Work of the Army\" which is regarded as an historical document. This document was formerly a political work report of the political department of the corps delivered at a senior cadre meeting of the northwest bureau of the CPC Cen- tral Committee. Actually, it was mostly written by Comrade Mao Zedong personally. This report fully affirmed the achievements in and experiences of, the political work of the rear corps and pointed out that following a series of ideological and political work and the movement for party consoli- dation in specific, the rear corps is full of enthusiasm of militancy, produc- tion and study and is full of vitality.\" This report also stressed: \"Revo- lutionary political work led by the party is the lifeblood of the revolu- tionary army\" and a mark which differentiated the revolutionary force from the reactionary troops. Political work meant using revolutionary spirit to educate the army so that it could fulfill various tasks assigned by the party ideologically, politically and organizationally. Without revolutionary political work, it would be impossible to establish an army which completely defended the people's interests. The fundamental reason why the Eighth Route Army and the New Fourth Army fought so courageously in the war of resistance against Japan and could carry out hard struggle and keep on fighting in spite of all setbacks was that they conducted profound careful political work. Over the past several decades, this document has played an important guiding role in the political work of our troops. While constantly and firmly grasping political and ideological education, we consolidated the troops both organizationally and in discipline. At a meet- ing attended by leaders of the rear corps, a decision on unifying the organi- zational system of the troops was made according to the instructions issued by Comrade Mao Zedong. The meeting also issued a call on laying a foundation for the regularization of the troops and stressed the necessity of establish- ing various rules and regulations and set strict demand on the military life Approved For Release 2008/03/19: CIA-RDP04-01460R000100350001-9 Approved For Release 2008/03/19: CIA-RDP04-01460R000100350001-9 of the force. We unified the troop establishment and the names of various organizations as well as various rules and regulations on shift duty, briefing, meetings, reports, request for leave, inspection, summation of work and so forth. We promulgated various regulations, ordinances and orders concerning daily affairs, discipline, staff officers, combat, confidential work, docu- ments, archives and so forth. We provided the troops with more education on discipline and placed the enforcement of discipline on the agenda of the work of party branches in companies to ensure that the troops absolutely complied with and observed various disciplines. We also strengthened the building of party branches in the companies and pay attention to bringing the role of fighting bastions of party branches and the vanguard and exemplary role of Communist Party members into full play. Through such consolidation work, we enforced strict discipline in military life, established normal order, strengthened unity and built closer relations between the army and the govern- ment on the one hand and the army and the people on the other. Hence our troops took on a new look. In particular, we attached importance to the military training and the study of military theories and technology of the troops to constantly enhance their combat effectiveness. The rear corps did not fight so frequently as troops at the front and its tactical and technological level was mainly enhanced through military training. Comrade Mao Zedong also showed concern for the military training of the rear corps. He demanded that cadres above regiment level study military ideology, strategy and tactics and modestly study the combat experiences of troops'fighting at the front. He also instructed that more practice, rather than lectures, was needed in the military training and that elicitation method of teaching should be followed. We guided our cadres and fighters to conscientiously study Comrade Mao Zedong's \"On Protracted War\" to master objective laws of the war of resistance against Japan. In military training, we conducted strategic training and technical training separately. The stress of technical training was laid on the four aspects: Bayonet fight- ing, shooting, throwing hand grenades and the enhancement of combat effective- ness in fighting at close range. The emphasis of tactical training was put on close-range combat which included the operation of squads and platoons, fight- ing at night, fighting on rivers and mountains and fighting carried out in particular terrains such as forests, deserts, land covered with gaoliang and so forth. While giving military training, we.also paid attention to training officers and soldiers so that they possessed the combat spirit of valor and vigor. We put forth the slogan \"Tasks are more important than lives.\" At the same time, we also ran training classes, training units and study classes for cadres at brigade and regiment levels so that cadres above squad level might have an opportunity to focus their attention on military training and study. In such a way, the combat effectiveness of our troops was considerably enhanced. This ensured that we could achieve one victory after another in real battles. After the start of the war of resistance against Japan, the conditions in the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia border region were extremely complicated. Bandits ran rampant inside the border region. To the east of the Huanghe, the Japanese troops faced us across the river and the other three sides of the border region Approved For Release 2008/03/19: CIA-RDP04-01460R000100350001-9 Approved For Release 2008/03/19: CIA-RDP04-0146OR000100350001-9 were encircled ring upon ring by several hundred thousand KMT troops. However, with the support of the main force at the front and the people of the border region, the rear corps of the Eighth Route Army repulsed the enemy attacks one after another and successfully defended the border region and the party Central Committee. In the early days of the war of resistance against Japan, because the main force,of the Eighth Route Army was sent to the front, the KMT and the Japanese invaders made use of bandits to harass the border region. At that time, apart from bandits operating alone, there were 43 gangs of bandits including Xue .Zhimao, Li Qinwu, Zhao Laowu and so forth. They had more than 4,000 men and 2,000 guns or so. They made a practice of looting, raping, slaughter and arson, assassinated our working personnel, sabotaged our local administrative organs and stopped at nothing in doing evil. Therefore, people at the border region could not live a stable life and social order was in chaos. Expedi- tiously eliminating bandits became an urgent task in defending the border region. The rear corps concentrated a superior force and adopted tactics of combining the practice of \"vigorously pursuing and intercepting and making a joint attack\" with the act of mobilizing the masses in order to disintegrate the bandits politically and suppress them militarily. Within a period of less than a year, we basically wiped out those bandits after a score of big and small battles. When I reported the news to Comrade Mao Zedong, he felt pleasantly surprised and immediately drafted a telegram and sent it to various anti-Japanese base areas throughout the country to cite the rear corps. From March 1938 to 1940, the Japanese aggressor troops attacked our front at the flood prevention zone of the border region on scores of occasions. By relying on their superiority in airplanes and artilleries and using gas shells., they tried to fight their way across the Huanghe River to launch a decisive war to quickly destroy the border region. However, the rear corps, and the 359th brigade which reinforced it, closely united with the people of the border region and exerted joint efforts to build strong defense works stretch- ing more than 1,000 li along the flood prevention zone. With the powerful support of the main force of our troops stationed at the northwestern part of Shanxi Province, we defeated the attack of the Japanese aggressor troops after 78 big and small battles.. They did not dare to march forward even an inch. While fighting those battles, we did not merely adopt defensive tactics. In- stead we vigorously made a flank attack on the enemy. For instance, when the enemy was marching toward the flood prevention zone for the first time, our troops launched a night attack on the enemy battalions from the Wanglaopo Mountain near the Fenli Highway. After fighting with bayonets, which lasted for several hours, we defeated an enemy's unit, wiped out more than 200 sol- diers and seized a lot of booty. In the battle of Songjiachuan, more than 15,000 enemy troops tried to fight their way across the river behind the artillery screens and air raid. Our troops and people at the border region held fast to their positions day and night. After a fierce battle, which lasted for 3 days and nights, the enemy's plot of fighting their way across the river did not succeed and they were compelled to retreat. In the battles to check the enemy's attack on Jiaxian County, its attempt to seize crossing sites and prevent it from crossing the Huanghe River, we met its attack calmly and adopted the tactic of \"crossing half of the river to strike blows at the Approved For Release 2008/03/19: CIA-RDP04-0146OR000100350001-9 Approved For Release 2008/03/19: CIA-RDP04-0146OR000100350001-9 enemy.\" In the meantime, we sent our troops to penetrate into the enemy's rear area to carry out a flank attack. The Japanese troops were crushed and defeated and their plot to fight their way across the Huanghe River did not succeed. To the fighters of the rear corps, their most frequent and complicated task was to carry out the struggle to counter the friction created by the KMT. After the fall of Wuhan in 1938, the diehards of the KMT were inactive in fighting the Japanese aggressors. However, they actively pursued a domestic anti-communist policy and set off an anti-communist upsurge on three occasions. They harassed, sabotaged and blockaded the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia border region. Under the personal direction of Comrade Mao Zedong, our rear corps carried out a series of struggles to counter the friction. When we were launching such struggles, Comrade Mao Zedong taught us that we should stick to the principles of \"with good reason, with the advantage and with restraint,\" \"we will not attack unless we are attacked; if we are attacked, we will certainly counter- attack,\" \"we will not fight unless we are sure of victory\" and \"stop when we reach the limit.\" I still remember that when Yan Xishan was frantically carrying out anti-communist activities in 1939 to attack the new army in Shanxi led by the party, the party Central Committee sent Comrade Wang Ruofei and me to the town of Qiulin to talk with Yan Xishan. We brought with us Comrade Mao Zedong's personal letter to Yan Xishan. Comrade Mao Zedong wrote in the letter the principle of \"we will not attack unless we are attack; if we are attacked, we will certainly counterattack.\" Yan Xishan was scared after reading it and demanded that the last sentence be changed into \"we will defend ourselves.\" Comrade Mao Zedong insisted that not a single word could be changed and that we should firmly stick to the principle \"if we are attacked, we will certainly counterattack.\" In the struggle to counter the friction created by the KMT, there were several things which left a deep impression on me. They enabled us to realize Comrade Mao Zedong's superb skill of struggle. The first thing was that from the end of 1939 to the spring of 1940, when the Japanese aggressor troops were strengthening their attack against the Shaanxi- Gansu-Ningxia border region, the diehards of the KMT began their first anti- communist upsurge. Chiang Kai-shek ordered the KMT reactionary troops, which encircled the border region, to attack and occupy 5 counties including Chun- hua, Xunyi, Zhengning, Ningxian and Zhenyuan, and 6 districts and 43 villages at the border region. Just at this critical juncture, the party Central Com- mittee decided to transfer the 359th brigade to reinforce the border region. When Comrade Wang Zhen led the brigade to march toward Suide, the Japanese aggressor troops were fighting their way across the river. He Shaonan, the KMT commissioner in Suide, was terror-striken at the news and ran away. Our party Central Committee ordered Comrade Wang Zhen to take the concurrent post of the commissioner of Suide to maintain social order there. However, when the Japanese troops were defeated by us, He Shaonan came back again to try to seize the domain and create friction. Of course, he was resolutely counter- attacked by us. The KMT reactionaries seized this opportunity to give enor- mous publicity to the incident in order to discredit us. To tell people of the whole country about the truth of this incident and expose the'anti- communist plot of the KMT, Comrade Mao Zedong did a very clever thing. He Approved For Release 2008/03/19: CIA-RDP04-0146OR000100350001-9 Approved For Release 2008/03/19: CIA-RDP04-0146OR000100350001-9 personally drafted a telegram of commendation on behalf of Comrade Wang Zhen and sent it to the KMT authorities in my name. While citing.the great achieve- ments of Comrade Wang Zhen in resisting the Japanese troops, the telegram also exposed He Shaonan's crimes of taking bribes and bending the law as well as abandoning Suide. The KMT and Chiang Kai-shek did not know how to reply. This was a method of using attack as a means of defense. Another thing was that in January 1941 diehards of the KMT created the \"South- ern Anhui incident\" and began the second anti-communist upsurge. More than 400,000 troops of the units of Hu Zhongnan, Ma Bufang and Ma Hongkui, and 3 peace preservation brigades and 10 peace preservation corps strictly sealed off_ the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia border region. Again Comrade Mao Zedong wrote the article \"On the situation of the Shaanxi-Gansu-Nangxia border region.\" After his personal revision, the article was translated into foreign languages and published. The article told the world about the political, economic and mili- tary development of the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia border region and revealed how the KMT troops created friction at the border region and enforced a triple- depth blockade. It also made known to the public the designations of the KMT troops which sealed off the border. This laid completely bare Chiang Kai-shek's anti-communist plots. During the second half of 1942, as required by the development of the situa- tion of the war of resistance against Japan and the struggle to repel the attack of the troops of the KMT diehards against the border region, the party Central Committee decided to establish joint defense forces of the five provinces including Shaanxi, Gansu, Ningxia, Shanxi and Suiyuan. The rear corps was led by the joint defense forces of the five provinces. Thus the military strength of the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia region was greatly expanded. This created favorable conditions and contributed to shattering the massive military attack of Hu Zhongnan. The production campaign of the rear corps started as early as in 1938. At that time, fighters of the rear corps led a very hard life. On an average, each fighter had only five fen a day for meals and wore shabby clothes. Some of them wore cotton-padded coats in summer and shorts in winter or even went barefoot on ice. To overcome economic difficulties, improve the livelihood of our troops and lighten the burden on the people, Comrade Mao Zedong told us that we should learn to carry out production and that we should combine production, study and combat. In accordance with the instruction of Comrade Mao Zedong, at the second meeting attended by leaders of the corps held in July 1938, we put forward the slogan of \"Production and Study.\" At a party congress held in December of the same year, we put forth the slogan \"Adopt a posture of fighting to speed up production and turn our military. units into a place for collective production.\" Thereafter, we regarded pro- duction as a constant task of our army units. At that time, the purpose of our production was to improve the livelihood of army troops and our main efforts were devoted to planting vegetables, raising pigs, making straw sandals, spinning wool, weaving cotton cloth and so forth. Although the scale of our production was not large, we achieved marked results. Our fighters' food, uniforms, daily necessities and so forth were greatly improved. This provided experiences and set a good example for the future mass production campaign. Approved For Release 2008/03/19: CIA-RDP04-0146OR000100350001-9 Approved For Release 2008/03/19: CIA-RDP04-0146OR000100350001-9 After 1939, the diehards of the KMT stepped up their attack, enforced a strict economic blockade on the border region stopped regular pay for the Eighth Route Army and began one anti-communist upsurge after another. This caused extreme difficulties in the financial supplies of the border region. We had enormous difficulties in supplying food and clothing to the army and people at the border region. At that time, people at the border region had to bear heavy burdens and the masses complained about this. Comrade Mao Zedong told all comrades everywhere that the people would support us if we attached impor- tance to the development of production,and.lightened the burden on the masses. Otherwise, they would not support us and the revolution would collapse half- way. One day, Comrade Mao Zedong called Lin Boqu, Gao Gang and me together and asked us: What is our purpose in coming to the northern part of Shaanxi Province? He then said: We came here to make revolution. Now the Japanese imperialists and the diehards of the KMT are trying to bottle us up and starve us to death. What should we do? There are three paths we can follow: first, since it is no longer possible to carry out the revolution, we had better give it up halfway and go home. Second, if we are not willing to give up and cannot adopt effective methods, we had better wait and starve ourselves to death. Third, we can use our hands to develop production and overcome diffi- culties by relying on our own efforts. After hearding Comrade Mao Zedong's humorous remarks, we agreed to his method of developing production by relying on our own efforts. After that, the party Central Committee and Comrade Mao Zedong called on the party, government, army, civilians and schools at the border region to exert a concerted effort to launch the mighty campaign of mass production. In the mighty campaign of mass production, the broad masses of the officers and men of the rear corps were the most active and scored the most marked achievements in production. In 1943, they opened up 210,000 mu of wasteland and reaped 30,000 dan of refined grain. They operated 11 wool workshops and 52 other mills which produced clothing, shoes and stockings, leather, wooden articles, large handcarts and so forth, in addition to coalpits, charcoal kilns, brick and tile kilns and ceramic kilns. We wove 13,000 bolts of cloth and carried out animal husbandry, transportation, business and so forth. A number of advanced and exemplary figures such as Zhao Zhankui, Wu Shenghua, Hu Qingshan, Zhang Zhiguo, Feng Guoyu, Zhao Zhankui and so forth, from all fronts of industrial and agricultural production and army units, came to the fore. After the mass campaign of production, we gradually solved the problems of the supplies for the army units and self-sufficiency. Right at the beginning of the mass campaign of production, the 359th brigade put forth the slogan \"We do not want a single piece of grain, a can of cloth and a fen of money from the state.\" They marched to Nanniwan and other places to reclaim wasteland and begin farming. Some companies went straight to barren hills to open up wasteland. When they had no place to live, they slept in the open on the barren hills. When they had nothing to eat, they allayed their hunger with wild herbs and grass roots. They worked hard for several months at a time. Cadres and fighters used their own hands to turn the desolate and uninhabited Nanniwan into \"fertile land of the northern part of Shaanxi.\" In 1944, \"half of the grain they produced was surplus grain\" and the objective of one pig for two persons and two goats for one person on the average was attained.

However, their goal was not attained. On the contrary, under the wise leadership of the party Central Committee and Comrade Mao Zedong, we developed production and brought forth a prosperous economy through the campaign of mass production. We had ample food and clothing and created wonders which have rarely occurred in the world. Our American friend Snow and patriotic overseas Chinese Chen Jiageng came to Yanan. They highly praised the scene of hard struggle and prosperity at the border region. Under such arduous circumstances, we never bowed to difficulties. On the contrary, we c overcame them. What did we rely upon to conquer those difficulties? I think that we mainly relied on the correct leadership of the party Central Committee and Comrade Mao Zedong. The whole party and army kept in line with the party Central Committee and united as one and all of us were inspired by the lofty ideals of serving the people and the spirit of working hard for the prosperity of the country. In this way, difficulties gave way. Comrade Mao Zedong said that people needed a bit of spirit. At that time, we were of one heart and one mind to defeat the Japanese imperialists and to build a prosperous and strong new China. We fought for these common objectives. Therefore,-no dif- ficulties could daunt us. Today, on the new long march of carrying out the four modernizations and making China rich and powerful, we particularly need the \"Spirit of Nanniwan!\" In 1945 when I was to leave Yanan for the northeast to take up a new post, Comrade Mao Zedong talked with me for a long time. He said that the rear corps was a good force which had resolutely implemented the correct line of the, party Central Committee and the task entrusted by the party. He fully affirmed all the achievements scored by the rear corps and its contributions to defending the party Central Committee and the border region. Actually, all these achieve- ments could not be separated from his personal direction and concern! On the occasion marking the 55th anniversary of the founding of our army, we par- ticularly cherish the memory of Comrade Mao Zedong., who made tremendous con- tributions to the building of our army. Comrade Mao Zedong's military thought on the people's army and people's war will always be our source of strength for winning victory.

In order to victoriously shoulder the ever more arduous and strenuous tasks entrusted to us by the party and the state, it is still necessary for us to make greater efforts in this respect. On the ideological, theoretical, educational, news, literary, art and publication fronts, not only the comrades in leading positions but every cadre and every research worker, including the comrades who have moved to the second line and who have temporarily left their jobs for recuperation or retired, are confronted with the problem of constantly heightening party spirit and improving the style of study. Heightening party spirit is inseparable from improving the style of study. Comrade Mao Zedong linked heightening of party spirit with the Marxist style of study. It is chiefly due to sabotage by the Lin Biao and Jiang Qing counterrevolutionary cliques--this historical reason--that until now we have not succeeded in fundamentally improving party work style. Although party work style in quite a few localities, departments and units is much better than it was in the past and is getting better and better, there are still considerable gaps compared with the best level ever recorded. In 1943, Comrade Chen Yun, who was head of the organizational department at that time, delivered a speech to the literary and art workers due to leave for the rural areas. It is almost 40 years since then and yet the truth contained in that speech is still applicable today with respect to comrades who engage in literary and art work. It is likewise applicable with respect to comrades who engage in propaganda, cultural and other work. He said, whether you are a specialist in a certain field or a person engaged in some sort of work, you should first regard yourself as an ordinary CPC member. Every CPC member should conscientiously think over this problem. As a CPC member, whether you have scored great achievements, hold a high position or have been in the party for a long time, do you first of all think that you are an ordinary CPC member when you are speaking, writing and doing work? We express our readiness to obey the party organizations when we take the oath on being admitted to the party. Approved For Release 2008/03/19: CIA-RDP04-0146OR000100350001-9 Approved For Release 2008/03/19: CIA-RDP04-0146OR000100350001-9 However, when the organization assigns work to us, can we always resolutely abide by the assignments and, strive to accomplish the tasks? Naturally, it is permissible, by stating the reasons, to ask the organization to consider assigning us another job so that we can work more and better for the party. However, from the erroneous words and deeds of some party members we can see that they have forgotten even the basic rules a party member should abide by. With respect to this matter, we should not be excessively accommodating. When a party member exceeds what is proper in both his words and deeds, he should make self-criticism and correct his mistakes. Otherwise, the dis- cipline of our party will become lax and corrupted. At present, there are indeed a small number of party members who regard themselves as infallible and who, when writing articles or delivering speeches, do not consider whether their articles and speeches conform to the party's line, principles and policies. They only remember that they are specialists in certain fields or heads of some sort but forget that they are first of all CPC members. This is very bad indeed. The leading system of our party must be reformed and the forms of party organization may also undergo some changes. However, there is no change in the fact that every party member should abide by the party rules and regu- lations. So long as you are a CPC member, whether you are a head of a certain department or a specialist in a certain field, you must be honest and faithful to the CPC branch, the general CPC branch and the CPC com- mittee and to the organization. You should abide by the party rules and regulations and should not violate them. You should obey the leadership, supervision and education of the organization in which you are in'and should not reject this leadership, supervision and education. The CPC Central Committee has on many occasions raised the question of consolidating the party. It is first of all necessary to conduct ideological education in order to raise ideological consciousness and, on the basis of the ideological education, carry out consolidation of the organization step by step. In the course of the ideological education, every party member should conscientiously judge if he conforms to the requirements for a party member. If he does not come up to the require- ments, he should strive to achieve them. If he does not want to exert himself and if he is really unqualified, it is. no good letting him stay in the party. It is necessary for every party member to constantly consider this question: Am I a qualified or an unqualified party member? What should I do if I am unqualified? There are only two ways out: One is to strive to become qualified and the other is to refuse to make any efforts and so have to give up party membership. It will not do for a person who is unqualified to stay in the party for this will implicate the party and and undermine the party's image. This is a very serious question with respect to comrades who are already party members now and comrades who have applied for party membership. In order to be a qualified party member, it is imperative for our words and deeds to conform to the requirements of the party constitution. In a socialist country like ours, the party is in a leading position. The composition, organization and conditions of the party are extremely Approved For Release 2008/03/19: CIA-RDP04-0146OR000100350001-9 Approved For Release 2008/03/19: CIA-RDP04-0146OR000100350001-9 important not only to the party itself but also to the entire cause of the socialist modernization program, the. destiny of the state and the prospects of the nation. Recently a leading comrade of the CPC Central Committee said that efforts should be made to enable our party members to become qualified party members and our cadres to become qualified cadres so that the combat effectiveness of the party not only comes up to but also sur- passes the highest level in the party's history. If the party organiza- tions at various levels and all party members come up to the requirements of the party, we shall be fully confident of greatly pushing our work for- ward and smoothly accomplishing the historic task of the socialist mod- ernization program. No matter how many difficulties and obstacles we may meet, we shall have sufficient strength to vanquish them. Confronted with such a serious problem, no party member should. adopt the attitude of \"letting things drift if they do not affect one personally.\" We should not only strive to become a qualified party member but also be responsible for supervising other party members and find out if they are qualified as party members. With respect to unqualified party members, it is necessary to criticize and help them. If they turn a deaf ear to criticism and refuse to accept help, we must be bold to speak out and make suggestions on deal- ing with them to the party organization. This is a manifestation of hold- ing ourselves responsible to the party, the people and the cause of socialism and communism. The question of heightening party spirit is the lifelong duty of every party member and its requirements must be increasingly higher. First of all, we should strive to be a qualified party member. If we fail to become qualified, how can we raise the requirements? Now we do not set demands from the highest standards but from the requirements of the party rules and regulations. As far as a CPC member is concerned, these are the minimum requirements. If a party member fails to abide by the party rules and regulations, how can he fight for the cause of communism all his life and place the party's interests in the first place? Every party member must be subject to supervision. The CPC committee, general CPC branch and CPC branch and every party member must first of all supervise the leading responsible comrade of their department and see whether he carries out or violates the principles and policies of the CPC Central Committee. If violations have been noticed, criticism can be made to his face. If a party member has been, subjected to retaliation on this count, he can lodge complaints with the CPC committee at the higher levels up to the Central Committee. Heightening party spirit intrinsically involves the necessity of improving the style of study. Propaganda work is a task imbued with strong party spirit and scientific nature. Broadly speaking, it is in the category of social science. In the past few years, tremendous achievements have indeed been scored in the research work of social science. Especially in the economic and political aspects, the numerous social science workers have taken an active part in the discussions of relevant questions and the many views they have raised Approved For Release 2008/03/19: CIA-RDP04-0146OR000100350001-9 Approved For Release 2008/03/19: CIA-RDP04-0146OR000100350001-9 have played a good role in practical work. They have also done much better than before in conducting investigation and study and in collecting data and their consciousness is also higher than before. This constitutes progress. However, it is still necessary to greatly improve our style of study. For example, in the past few years, great changes have taken place in the-rural areas and the situation is excellent. The peasants heartily welcome the policies of the CPC Central Committee and everyone is jubilant. However, some research workers refuse to go to the rural areas. They are reluctant or unwilling to listen to the voice of millions of people and the views of the worker and peasant masses. This cannot be considered as good style of study. Even if we make cursory observation for a very short time, it will greatly help our work and contribute to our understanding. It is very important to ask the departments concerned to supply some material. How- ever, no matter how rich the material may be, it is still material gained in the past or secondhand material. As far as people who engage in research work are concerned, it is necessary to gather secondhand material. However, where conditions permit, it is more important to gather firsthand material. After all, there are.great disparities between the material gained from written documents and actual life. If we manage to find time to go to various provinces, prefectures, counties, communes and production brigades and have a look at the peasants' homes, we shall feel that we have gained much more substantial and abundant material than we did from written mate- rial. This greatly helps to increase our knowledge and broaden our thinking. Ours is a very, big country. The natural and economic conditions and the cultural levels in various localities of the rural areas are different and the economic developments are very uneven. It is therefore necessary to have various forms of agricultural production responsibility system. Even the same type of responsibility system, such as the implementation of the contract system in an overall way, often varies a great deal in localities of different economic development. In developing agriculture, it is also necessary to rely mainly on the planned economy and supplement it with regulation by market mechanism; and, with respect to the peasants' freedom, if we do not handle it well, it will affect the state plan. If we go to the grassroots to conduct investigation and study, we shall be able to confirm that the principles laid down by the CPC Central Committee conform to reality and thus deepen our understanding. There are many branches of learning in social science and so the requirements for getting in touch with reality cannot follow the same pattern. A person who engages in the study of history comes into contact with material quite different from that studied by a person who engages in solving practical problems. Even if you are a person who engages in the study of history, it will also do you a lot of good if you go to the grassroots and have a look. Owing to different historical conditions in the past and different economic development in various localities, the implementation of public ownership of the means of production and the agricultural production responsibility system also frequently bear the imprint of history. This historical imprint cannot but exert an influence on current work and practice.

We have a number of economists, some of whom have played a very good role in helping the CPC Central Committee and the State Council to determine the principles and policies.
