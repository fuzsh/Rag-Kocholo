        "text": "This article is designated a work in progress. Please ask the wiki team before adding content.\n\nThis timeline concerns the internal political developments of China from the Xinhai Revolution up until 1936.\n\nBetween 1895 and 1911, China experienced significant turmoil and transformation, a period marking the late Qing Dynasty's decline and the preliminary end of over two thousand years of imperial rule. This era began with a devastating defeat in the Sino-Japanese War, which resulted in the Treaty of Shimonoseki. The treaty forced China to cede Taiwan and the Liaodong Peninsula to Japan, recognise Korean independence, and pay a large indemnity, signaling the rise of Japan as a regional power and China's vulnerability.\n\nIn the wake of this defeat, foreign powers intensified their presence in China, carving out spheres of influence and obtaining various concessions in what became known as the \"Scramble for Concessions.\" Key concessions included port cities and railway construction rights granted to Britain, France, Germany, Russia, and Japan, leading to increased foreign dominance and internal dissatisfaction. Constitutional monarchist reformers took control in Beijing in the aftermath and, with the support of the young Guangxu Emperor, orchestrated the Hundred Days' Reform. Led by reformist intellectuals like Kang Youwei and Liang Qichao, the movement aimed to strengthen China in the face of foreign encroachment. However, the conservative backlash, led by Empress Dowager Cixi culminated in a coup that halted the reforms and placed the Guangxu Emperor under house arrest.\n\nIn 1899, the Boxer Rebellion, an anti-Christian uprising by the nationalist \"Boxers\", broke out. It targeted especially foreign nationals and prompted intervention by the Eight-Nation Alliance (Britain, France, Germany, Japan, Russia, the United States, Italy, and Austria-Hungary), leading to the Boxer Protocol. This treaty imposed harsh penalties on China, including a massive indemnity and further concessions, exacerbating the country's plight. In response, the Qing government implemented the \"New Policies\" between 1901 and 1911, a series of reforms aimed at modernising the military, establishing new schools, and creating a constitutional monarchy framework with provincial and national assemblies. Despite these efforts, the reforms were too little, too late, failing to halt the rising tide of nationalism and revolutionary sentiment.\n\nNationalist and revolutionary movements gained momentum as the Qing reforms faltered and foreign domination persisted. In 1905, revolutionary leaders such as Sun Yat-sen and Song Jiaoren met in Tokyo to discuss a merger of different insurrectionist groups. A new organisation known as Tongmenghui emerged as a significant revolutionary force, garnering support among overseas Chinese, intellectuals, and disaffected elements within China - years later, said organisation would evolve into the Kuomintang. Throughout the late 1900s, the Tongmenhui and similar organisations were evolved in a vast array of regional uprisings. While all of these failed, China descended further and further into instability.\n\nThe Failed Revolution[]\n\n1911[]\n\n1911 was marked by significant upheaval in China, catalyzed by the Railway Protection Movement and culminating in the Xinhai Revolution. The Railway Protection Movement began in response to the Qing Dynasty's decision to nationalize locally funded railway projects and transfer control to foreign banks, which ignited widespread protests in various Southern provinces. This nationalisation was seen as a betrayal of Chinese sovereignty and economic interests, leading to mass demonstrations and strikes demanding the return of railways to local control. The movement exposed the Qing government's vulnerability and intensified public dissatisfaction.\n\nThis discontent set the stage for the Xinhai Revolution, a pivotal uprising that commenced with the Wuchang Uprising on October 10, 1911. Soldiers of the New Army, influenced by revolutionary ideas, mutinied in Hubei province, and the revolt rapidly spread, with many provinces declaring independence from Qing rule. Revolutionary groups, notably the Tongmenghui led by Sun Yat-sen, galvanized support for the overthrow of the Qing Dynasty.\n\nDate Event Location Description Picture May 1911 Railway Nationaliation Act Signed in Beijing, but affecting primarily Central & Southern China\n\nFacing the financial burden imposed by the Boxer Protocol, the Qing government in Beijing begins to nationalise regionally funded railway lines and announces its desire to sell the rights to these ventures to foreign interests. Consequently, lenders of the American-German-British-French China Consortium agree to take over an array of railways in Central and Southern China in return for a generous loan agreement.\n\nAugust 1911 Railway Protection Movement Sichuan The nationalisation of the railway lines causes strong opposition across Southern China, particularly in Sichuan. Many local shareholders, a mix of civil servants, gentry, merchants, and landowners, are dissatisfied due to their compensation with government bonds rather than silver. Thousands of protestors head to the streets. Public speeches are held against the plan, widely regarded as a seizure of valuable economic assets by the Manchu court and the conversion of local property to foreign control. September 1911 Revolutionary Skirmishes around Chengdu Sichuan The mass protests in Sichuan are bloodily suppressed, further exacerbating the situation. Anti-monarchist underground groups, most prominently the Tongmenghui, initiate armed clashes with Qing troops in and around Chengdu. As the situation deteriorates, Beijing orders the neighboring provinces of Hunan and Hubei to reinforce Sichuan with backup forces. October 1911 Wuchang Uprising Hubei The withdrawal of forces from Hubei results in a massive power vacuum. On October 11, with most of the local troops on the way to Sichuan, revolutionary soldiers in Wuhan launch the Wuchang Uprising, the formal beginning of the Xinhai Revolution. The mutineers capture the Wuchang mint and arsenal - not long after, throughout the entire south city after city declare against the Qing government. Eventually, the Hubei Military Government under revolutionary icon Li Yuanhong is established. November 1911 Yuan Shikai becomes Chinese Premier Beijing Prince Chun, the panic-stricken regent of the underage Emperor Puyi, follows the assembly’s demand for the immediate adoption of a constitution and urges a former viceroy, Yuan Shikai, to come out of retirement and save the dynasty. Yuan agrees and is appointed Premier. Not long after, he forces Prince Chun to resign, and establishes Han supremacy over most of the ruling administration. Late November 1911 Ceasefire between Revolutionaries and Qing Forces Shanghai After a costly battle between revolutionary forces and government troops at Yangxia, 13 other Southern and Central Chinese provinces sway their allegiance to the revolutionaries, in spite of the confrontation ending in a nominal government victory. Unable to suppress nationwide insurrections, Premier Yuan Shikai enters into negotiations with the Wuchang government and agrees to a ceasefire. December 1911 Establishment of a Provisional Republican Government in Nanjing Nanjing In the wake of the ceasefire, leading revolutionaries from Wuhan such as Li Yuanhong and Shanghai such as Chen Qimei agree to establish a Republican counter-government, the Provisional Government of the Republic of China, in Nanjing to strengthen their leverage during the negotiations with the Beijing government. Late December 1911 Sun Yat-sen elected President of the Nanjing Government Southern & Central China Elections take place in the territories controlled by the Nanjing Provisional Government. Famous revolutionary icon and Tongmenhui leader Sun Yat-sen, who only recently returned from his exile in the United States of America, gains an absolute majority and is proclaimed Provisional President. 1 January 1912 is set as the epoch of the new Republican calendar. 29 December 1911 Secession of the Bogd Khanate of Mongolia Discontent with Chinese rule, Mongolian nobles and religious leaders start a movement for freedom. On December 29, they proclaim Mongolia a sovereign state and establish a theocratic monarchy. The Bogd Khan, a revered spiritual leader, becomes the head of the new nation. Although major powers do not immediately recognise Mongolia's independence, Russia offers some support. Despite China's continued claims, Mongolia operates as a e facto independent state.\n\n1912[]\n\n1912 brought transformative changes to China, marked by the end of the Qing Dynasty and the establishment of the Republic of China. Following the successful Xinhai Revolution, which began in late 1911, the abdication of Emperor Puyi on February 12, 1912, officially ended over two thousand years of imperial rule. Sun Yat-sen, a key revolutionary leader, was elected as the provisional president on January 1, 1912. However, political instability soon emerged as Yuan Shikai, a powerful military leader, maneuvered to replace Sun Yat-sen and was formally elected as president in March 1912. The nascent republic faced immediate challenges, including regional warlordism, political fragmentation, and efforts to unify the country under a central government, setting the stage for continued turbulence in the years to come.\n\nDate Event Location Description Picture January 1912 Negotiations between Yuan Shikai and Sun Yat-sen Beijing-Nanjing Negotiations between Beijing and Nanjing continue throughout early 1912. The country is essentially divided between the Qing-controlled north and the Republican-controlled south. Since Yuan could rely on the elite Beiyang Army, the Nanjing government recognises that an armed confrontation with the North would be fruitless. Yuan is willing to conclude peace with the South and enforce the abdication of the Emperor, but only under the condition that the Republican capital be moved to Beijing and that he become President of the Republic himself. Begrudgingly, Sun agrees. 12 February 1912 Yuan Shikai abolishes the Chinese Monarchy Beijing The Xuantong Emperor Puyi, 6 years old, is forced to abdicate the throne in a proclamation that transfers the government to the people’s representatives, declares that the constitution should thenceforth be republican, and gives President Yuan Shikai full powers to organise a provisional Republican government in Beijing. 10 March 1912 Yuan Shikai proclaimed as Provisional President Beijing Yuan is proclaimed provisional president in Beijing, his power base. In an attempt to unify the country, Sun Yat-sen dissolves the Nanjing counter-government. Famous Wuchang revolutionary Li Yuanhong is chosen as vice president. A provisional constitution is promulgated in March 1912 by the Nanjing parliament, and in April the government is officially transferred to Beijing. 25 August 1912 Foundation of the Chinese Nationalist Party Beijing On August 25, 1912, the Nationalist Party, a predecessor of the Kuomintang, is officially established at the Huguang Guild Hall in Beijing, During this event, the Tongmenghui and five smaller pro-revolution parties merge to contest the first national elections of 1912/13. Sun Yat-sen is chosen as the party chairman, with the famous revolutionary Huang Xing as his deputy. The most influential member of the party, however, is Song Jiaoren, mobilising mass support from gentry and merchants for the Nationalists to advocate for a constitutional parliamentary democracy. The party opposes constitutional monarchists and intends to check the power of President Yuan Shikai. 3 November 1912 Russo-Mongolian Agreement Mongolia Tsarist Russia recognises Mongolia as an autonomous region, which effectively means acknowledging its independence from Chinese control while not explicitly declaring it fully independence. Mongolia agrees indirectly to place itself under the protection of Russia, vastly increasing Russian influence in the Russo-Chinese frontier.\n\n1913[]\n\nIn 1913, President Yuan Shikai, who had consolidated power in 1912, sought to strengthen his control, leading to increasing tensions with revolutionary leaders and provincial warlords. The year was marked by the Second Revolution, an unsuccessful series of uprisings led by Sun Yat-sen and other members of the Kuomintang (Nationalist Party) against Yuan's authoritarian rule. Yuan's forces quickly suppressed these rebellions, solidifying his dominance. Additionally, Yuan dismissed the National Assembly, further centralising power and sparking widespread discontent.\n\nDate Event Location Description Picture 11 January 1913 Treaty of Friendship and Alliance between Tibet and Mongolia Tibet & Mongolia February 1913 First Nationwide Elections in Chinese History Entirety of China At the first National Assembly elections in Chinese history, the Nationalist Party wins an overwhelming majority, gaining control of over half the seats in both houses. The second largest party is the Progressive Party, led by constitutional monarchist Liang Qichao, one of the intellectuals behind the Hundred Days' Reform and a known supporter of Yuan Shikai's presidency. March 1913 Assassination of Nationalist Party leader Song Jiaoren Shanghai After the Nationalists' electoral victory in February, many expect the influential Song Jiaoren to become the next premier. However, shortly after the elections, he is assassinated in Shanghai, just two weeks before the assembly is set to convene. The Nationalist Party accuses Yuan Shikai of ordering the assassination, but Yuan denies the allegations. April 1913 Chinese-Western Loan Agreement Beijing Tensions between Yuan Shikai's Beiyang Clique and the Nationalist Party soon begin to escalate. Realising that armed confrontation is likely inevitable, Yuan secures a Reorganisation Loan of 25 million pounds sterling from Great Britain, France, Russia, Germany, and Japan in April, without consulting the parliament. This loan is used to finance the expansion and modernisation of the Beiyang Army. July 1913 Second Revolution Southern, Eastern and Central China Angered by Yuan's blatant disregard for the revolutionaries' democratic principles and his creeping centraliation of power, Nationalist Party-aligned governors launch a series of uprisings against the Beijing government throughout the summer of 1913 after Yuan officially dismisses the National Assembly. Additionally, bandits would rise up all over China against Yuan's regime, known as the Bai Lang Rebellion.\n\nDue to a lack of military coordination and inferior equipment, the revolution attempt can be quelled by Yuan. The revolutionary governors that participated in the uprising either defect to Yuan, are forcefully dismissed, or flee abroad. Most high-ranking National Party leaders, including Sun Yat-sen, also evacuate the country. In the aftermath, Yuan further consolidates his position, de facto ruling as an autocrat.\n\nOctober 1913 Yuan Shikai formally inaugurated as President Beijing An intimidated parliament formally elects Yuan Shikai President of the Republic of China, and the major powers extend recognition to his government. Many trusted Beiyang Army generals are given prominent positions in his cabinet, including several who would rise to power in the consequent years, such as Duan Qirui and Feng Guozhang. To achieve international recognition, Yuan has to agree to autonomy for Outer Mongolia and Tibet. 5 November 1913 1913 Sino-Russian Agreement Mongolia Yuan concludes a deal with Russia which recognises nominal Chinese sovereignty over Mongolia, but grants the Russians a broad array of political and economic special privileges, most importantly the right to station troops there. November 1913 Forceful Dissolution of the Nationalist Party In November Yuan Shikai, legally president, orders the Nationalist Party dissolved and forcefully removes its last remaining members from parliament. Since the majority of parliament members are still from the Nationalist Party, the parliament can no longer meet quorum and is subsequently unable to convene.\n\nRise and Fall of Yuan Shikai[]\n\n1914[]\n\nThroughout 1914, President Yuan Shikai continued his efforts to consolidate power, dissolving the National Assembly in January and replacing it with a provisional government under his control. The Beiyang Army and a loyalist bureaucratic apparatus became the foundation of his autocratic rule. Yuan's centralising efforts intensified tensions with regional warlords and alienated many of his of erstwhile allies - the Progressive Party due to Yuan's increasingly undemocratic actions, provincial governors due to his imperial aspirations and restriction of provincial autonomy, and generals in his Beiyang Army by centralizing tax collection from local authorities. Additionally, the outbreak of the Weltkrieg in July, had profound economic and political implications for China while Japanese sway continued to grow.\n\nDate Event Location Description Picture 3 July 1914 Simla Convention Tibetan-Indian Frontier Representatives from China and Tibet convene in Simla, British India, to discuss a proposed convention by the British. The convention aims to delineate \"Inner Tibet\" (comprising Qinghai, Gansu, Sichuan, and Yunnan) under Chinese jurisdiction, while granting \"Outer Tibet\" significant autonomy, effectively placing it within the British sphere of influence. Disagreements over the precise Chinese-Tibetan and British-Tibetan borders, however, lead to a stalemate. The Chinese delegation ultimately withdraws from the negotiations without signing the agreement. Subsequently, the British and Tibetan representatives reach a separate compromise, resulting in Britain de jure gaining control over Arunachal Pradesh. De facto, the claim is never enforced. 8 July 1914 Foundation of the Chinese Revolutionary Party Japan While exiled in Japan, Sun Yat-sen establishes the Chinese Revolutionary Party. However, many of his old revolutionary comrades, including Huang Xing and Hu Hanmin, refuse to join him due to the requirement for all party members to take an oath of personal loyalty to Sun. This stipulation is seen by many as undemocratic and contrary to the spirit of the revolution. As a result, Sun becomes temporarily marginalised within the Republican movement during this period. Nonetheless, a party bureau in Shanghai, led by Chen Qimei and Chiang Kai-shek, continues to pledge loyalty to him. 28 July 1914 Beginning of the Weltkrieg 7 November 1914 Fall of German Kiautschou Bay Shandong With Germany preoccupied in Europe, Japan joins the Entente and seizes the German Kiautschou Bay concession in Shandong Province.\n\n1915[]\n\nBy 1915, Yuan's power had almost become absolute. Controversial treaties with neighbourig powers such as Russia and China, seen by nationalists as a betrayal of the nation, gained him international recognition and funds. Further consolidfating power and suppressing opposition to his regime, his ambition to restore the monarchy and declare himself Emperor culminated in the establishment of the Empire of China in December 1915, a move that sparked widespread resistance and led to the National Protection War. The political climate was marked by significant unrest and opposition from both republican revolutionaries and regional military leaders, setting the stage for further instability and conflict in the years to come.\n\nDate Event Location Description Picture 18 January 1915 Twenty-One Demands The Japanese set before the government in Beijing the so-called Twenty-One Demands, aimed at securing Japanese economic controls in railway and mining operations in Shandong, Manchuria, and Fujian. They also press to have Yuan Shikai appoint Japanese advisors to key positions in the Chinese government. The Twenty-One Demands would have made China effectively a Japanese protectorate, violating the unwritten \"Open-Door Policy\" upheld by the US and Britain and therefore straining the Anglo-Japanese Alliance. The Chinese public responds with a spontaneous nationwide boycott of Japanese goods. The Beijing government rejects some of these demands but yields to the Japanese insistence on keeping the German Kiautschou Bay territory already in its possession. 29 May 1915 Treaty of Kyakhta Mongolia The Russo-Chinese Treaty of Kyakhta settles the political dispute between the two nations about Mongolian autonomy. It recognises Mongolia's autonomy under Chinese suzerainty, thereby confirming China's sovereignty while granting Mongolia self-governing rights, and facilitated a temporary stabilisation of relations among the three parties, setting a framework for the coexistence of Russian, Chinese, and Mongolian interests in the region. 12 December 1915 Declaration of the Hongxian Monarchy Beijing Despite the unpopularity of his policies, especially in the wake of the Twenty-One Demands, Yuan continues his despotic agenda, further centralising all powers of the state around himself. Supported by his son Yuan Keding, he declares himself Hongxian Emperor of a newly restored Chinese Empire on 12 December. 25 December 1915 Beginning of the National Protection War Southern China Yuan's move to restore the monarchy faces immediate and fierce opposition from regional leaders and military governors. Deposed Yunnan Governor Cai E, still interned in Beijing, manages to evade execution and flees back to Yunnan, where he, together with his former associate Tang Jiyao and ex-Jiangxi governor Li Liejun forms the National Protection Army to fight Yuan Shikai and defend the Republic, declaring Yunnan independent on 25 December.\n\n1916[]\n\nIn 1916, China was experiencing significant political instability. In the wake of mounting nation-wide instability following the outbreak of the National Protection War, Yuan Shikai was pressured by his subordinates in the Beiyang Army to adbicate as Emperor in March, but remained President of China.Yuan's death in June 1916 further plunged China into chaos, leading to the fragmentation of central authority and the rise of warlordism, where regional military leaders took control of various parts of the country. This period marked the beginning of a years-lasting era of internal strife and division within China.\n\nDate Event Location Description Picture 22 March 1916 Abdication of Yuan Shikai Beijing Yunnan's declaration of independence also encourages other Southern provinces, including Guizhou, Guangxi, Jiangsu, Guangdong, Zhejiang, Shaanxi, Sichuan, and Hunan, to denounce the government in Beijing throughout early 1916. Prominent defectors include Guangxi governor Lu Rongting and progressive politician Liang Qichao. Yuan's power further crumbles when several high-ranking Beiyang Army representatives, such as Feng Guozhang, Li Chun, and Duan Qirui, start to oppose his reign. As Yuan's most trusted allies, along with foreign powers like the Empire of Japan, pressure him to abdicate, Yuan formally repudiates the monarchy and steps down as the first and last emperor of his dynasty in late March, but remains in office as President of China. He dies on June 6, 1916, at the age of 56. 18 May 1916 Assassination of Chen Qimei Chen Qimei, a pivotal figure in China's revolutionary movement alongside Sun Yat-sen, is shot in Shanghai upon his clandestine return to provoke revolution against Yuan by Zhili-aligned military officer Zhang Zongchang - the eventual infamous warlord of Shandong - thereby further weakening the Nationalist movement. June 1916 Li Yuanhong inaugurated as President of China After Yuan Shikai's death in June 1916, Vice President and Wuchang revolutionary Li Yuanhong succeeds to the presidency. This move finds support among the Southern governors, most notably Cai E, who revoke their declarations of independence and rejoin the Beijing government upon Li's official inauguration on June 7. The National Protection War comes to an end. July 1916 Beginning of the Warlord Era While China is finally de jure united under a popular president, the National Protection War has left deep scars on the nation's geopolitical landscape. Despite Li's official role as president, the real power in Northern China lies with Premier Duan Qirui, who continues Yuan's controversial centralisation efforts. Factionalism starts to shatter the hopelessly divided Beiyang Army, with several cliques emerging: The Anhui Clique, led by Duan and Xu Shuzheng, dominates Beijing and the North China Plains; the Zhili Clique, centered around Vice President Feng Guozhang, controls Central and Eastern China; and the Fengtian Clique, led by Zhang Zuolin—a former bandit who has expelled the pro-Yuan governors from Manchuria—becomes the most powerful force in Northeastern China. Despite the superficial appearance of national unity, these regional warlords and their factions hold significant power, severely undermining efforts to establish a stable, centralised government.\n\nThe problem with this factionalism is that the Beiyang government is no longer able to effectively crack down on rebellions in the far-flung Southern and Eastern provinces. De facto, government control only reaches as far south as the Yangtze River and as far west as Shaanxi. China slowly descends into decentralised warlordism, with the militaristic Beiyang Army-dominated \"Beiyang Government\" in Beijing controlling most of Northern China, while charismatic generals like Cai E, Lu Rongting, and Tang Jiyao rule the revolutionary warlord states in the south.\n\nAdditionally, the de facto independent states of Mongolia, Tibet, and Xinjiang, as well as the Muslim Chinese Ma family domain, control the vast deserts and mountains of Western China. This marks the formal beginning of the Warlord Era.\n\nLate July 1916 Return of Sun Yat-sen to China Sun Yat-sen returns from his Japanese exile to Shanghai, hoping that his nationalist ideas might now fall on fertile ground. Focused on rebuilding the suppressed Revolutionary Party and reestablishing its political and military strength, he aims to counter the rising power of regional warlords who have taken control of various parts of China after Yuan's death. Sun's efforts are directed towards unifying the country and advancing the republican ideals he championed during the 1911 Revolution. 8 November 1916 Death of Cai E Yunnan Cai E, the most influential Republican leader of the National Protection Army-aligned warlord states in the south, passes away on November 8, 1916, at the age of only 33. His death, attributed to tuberculosis, is seen as a significant loss to the republican movement in China and causes a power vacuum in Southern China, which benefits the rise of new warlords such as Tang Jiyao as well as several KMT-aligned leaders.\n\nAn Empire fragmented[]\n\n1917[]\n\nDespite the end of Yuan's dictatorship and the nominal reunification of China, the year 1917 further exacerbated China's fragile political situation. A power struggle between President Li Yuanhong, one of the revolutionary leaders of the 1911 Xinhai Revolution, and Premier Duan Qirui, a Beiyang Army general formerly subordinated to the late Yuan, threatened to tear the country apart. A failed attempt at restoring the Chinese Empire by a clique of monarchist generals failed, giving Duan and the circle of officers around him, the so-called \"Anhui Clique, almost absolute power. His disregard for the constitution stoked renewed resistance in the rebellious south, where an anti-Northern counter-government was declared by regional warlords and the Chinese Revolutionary Party, triggering the First Constitutional Protection War.\n\nDate Event Location Description Picture Early/Mid 1917 Power Struggle between President Li Yuanhong and Premier Duan Qirui Northern China Early 1917 is marked by an increasingly tense power struggle in Beijing's highest echelons, as Premier Duan Qirui proves unwilling to abide to the restored 1912 Constitution, finding frequent ways to circumnavigate it, to the dismay of President Li, Vice President Feng Guozhang (leader of the Zhili Clique), and, once again, the governors of the South. A major flashpoint between Li and Duan is the question of neutrality in the Weltkrieg. Duan heavily favors siding with the Entente, viewing it as an opportunity to secure loans from Japan to bolster his own position. The pro-neutrality Li strongly objects, arguing that focusing on China's domestic issues and mending the North-South divide should be the priority. April 1917 First Yunnan-Sichuan War Sichuan Central authority in Sichuan, a massive confrontation zone between Beiyang and Southern forces since the Second Revolution of 1913, begins to collapse as a violent power struggle breaks out over the province's governorship. Two warlords, the Beiyang-backed pro-Northern candidate Liu Cunhou, and the Yunnanese puppet Dai Kan, fight for control of the province, with Dai being backed by invading Yunnanese troops under Tang Jiyao.\n\nMost of Sichuan plunges into anarchy, with dozens of small warlords emerging in the countryside. In the following years, the struggle over control of Sichuan would continue, with the Northern-appointed governors residing in Chengdu, the Southern-aligned one building up their power base near the Yunnanese border and regional warlords establishing themselves in cities such as Chongqing.\n\nMay 1917 Forced Dismissal of Duan Qirui Beijing As the conflict between Duan and Li escalates, the former starts to use bullying tactics with organised mobs to force the parliament into submission to approve his foreign-political agenda. As a consequence, Li dismisses Duan in May as Premier after parliament votes for his resignation. Duan denounces this move as illegal and retreats to Tianjin, where he, supported by many Beiyang Army generals, demands the dissolution of parliament: China stumbles into the next political crisis. 1 July 1917 Manchu Restoration Beijing To calm tensions with Duan, Li Yuanhong summons famous unalaigned general & Anhui Governor Zhang Xun, a hero during the 1913 military campaigns against the South, to Beijing to mediate the situation. However, upon his arrival, Zhang, backed with German funds, occupies the city, forcing Li to dissolve the Parliament and restore Puyi to the Dragon Throne. President Li seeks refuge in the Japanese legation, where he is forced to reinstate Duan as Premier. Mid-July 1917 Duan Qirui assumes uncontested control Beijing After reaching a compromise with Li, Duan leads the Beiyang Army into Beijing, swiftly defeating Zhang's forces and ending the Manchu Restoration. The royalists are vanquished, but Li's reputation has suffered significantly, while Duan Qirui has emerged once again as the most powerful man in China. Consequently, Li is compelled to resign as President and replaced by Vice President Feng Guozhang of the Zhili Clique, solidifying the Beiyang Army's total control over the government. Upon his return, Duan refuses to restore parliament, arguing that his victory over the Manchu Restoration counted as a second Xinhai Revolution and set out to craft a new provisional senate which will draft the election rules for a new parliament. This senate cut the number of seats in the future parliament by nearly half. 1 September 1917 Establishment of the Guangzhou Counter-Government Southern China Duan's complete disregard for the constitution causes Sun Yat-sen and his Chinese Revolutionary Party, Cen Chunxuan (an influential Southern Chinese intellectual and politician) and deposed parliament members from the North to establish a semi-democratic counter-government in Guangzhou, supported by the remnants of the National Protection Army, to counter Duan's abuse of power. This includes the Yunnan Clique of Tang Jiyao, the Guangxi Clique of Lu Rongting, the Guangdong Clique of Chen Bingkun, the Hunan Clique of Tan Yankai, and the Guizhou Clique of Liu Xianshi: It is the beginning of the First Constitutional Protection Movement. Ironically, Sun Yat-sen's new government is neither based on the Provisional Constitution rather, it is de facto a military government and Sun is its Generalissimo. Late Summer 1917 Outbreak of the First Constitutional Protection War Southern & Central China Duan, infuriated by yet another declaration of independence in the south, reacts by mobilising the Beiyang Army and dispatching two renowned Zhili commanders southward, aiming to weaken Zhili influence in the north. Among these commanders is Wu Peifu, a young and ambitious military officer and protégé of Cao Kun, the second most important general of the Zhili Clique after Feng Guozhang. Like Feng, Wu opposes fighting the Southern governors, aligning with the Zhili Clique's preference for peaceful reconciliation with the south. Upon arriving in Hunan, Wu refuses to take up arms. This fiasco deeply embarrasses Duan in Beijing, leading to his formal resignation as Premier in November. Despite his resignation, Duan continues to wield considerable influence in Beijing due to the loyalty of various military commanders and governors. During the winter, the North and South enter a temporary armistice. December 1917 Growing Resistance against Sun Yat-sen Guangzhou\n\nSun Yat-sen's authoritarian tendencies in the south alienate many important regional military officers and political figures. In December, a conference is convened by local warlords Lu Rongting and Tang Jiyao as well as Tang Shaoyi, a famous former Beiyang Government politician and first Premier of the Republic in 1912/13, where they advocate for the removal of Sun, the recognition of Feng Guozhang's Northern presidency and formation a united government.\n\nIn the end, China would never join the Entente, mainly because of strong opposition from Feng Guozhang, the inaction of the United States and Russia's collapse into civil war in late 1917. Nonetheless, Duan would try to negotiate financial loans with Japan in secret, in exchange for concessions, to fund the military buildup for the reconquest of the south. Around the same time, the New Culture Movement, which calls for the creation of a new Chinese culture based on global and western standards, especially democracy and science, begins to emerge in coastal urban centres, especially in cities with significant foreign presence. Major representatives are Hu Shih, Chen Duxiu, Cai Yuanpei and Li Dazhao.\n\n1918[]\n\nDate Event Location Description Picture March 1918 Foundation of the Anfu Club Beijing Several high-ranking Anhui Clique generals and governors, among them most prominently Wang Yitang and Xu Shuzheng, form the so-called \"Anfu Club\", the political wing of Duan Qirui's Anhui Clique. They exert so much pressure on President Feng Guozhang that the latter is forced to reinstate Duan Qirui as Premier in late March. 24 May 1918 Ousting of Sun Yat-sen Guangzhou Distrust towards Sun Yat-sen reaches new heights as Sun opposes any peace settlement with the Beiyang Government and opposition figures such as Minister of the Navy Cheng BIguang are suspiciously assassinated. For powerful Southern warlords such as Lu Rongting and Tang Jiyao, this demonstrates that further cooperation with Sun is unfeasible.\n\nBy the end of May 1918, the post of Generalissimo is formally abolished, and a committee of various military officers headed by Cen Chunxuan assumes control. Sun, once again side-lined by his political opponents and military strongmen, leaves for Shanghai following the reorganization with his most loyal supporters, among them Chiang Kai-shek and Wang Jingwei. Following Sun's removal, the Southern warlords agree to Wu's diplomatic overtures. A peaceful settlement between the north and south is arranged later that year, and China is united on paper once again.\n\nMay 1918 Xu Shisheng inaugurated as President of China Beijing In October, the term of President Feng Guozhang expires. In an attempt to placate the south, he agrees not to seek re-election provided Duan also vacate the office of premier on the same day. Duan, whose power base in Beijing has been constantly shrinking throughout 1918 due to the successful Zhili efforts to establish peace in the south, reluctantly agrees. Nonetheless, also largely due to the political influence of the Anfu Club, Duan manages to engineer the appointment of Xu Shichang as the next President: Xu, renowned constitutional monarchist and former Premier, is a civilian and therefore not directly tied to any of the Northern military cliques. Lacking any military power of his own, Xu therefore is bound to his political benefactors, the Anhui Clique. Via Xu, Duan hopes to delimit Zhili influence in the government while enlargening his own sphere of influence without actually holding any government posts.\n\nShortly after, the war against the South officially continues. The Constitutional Protection Army is engaged in battle in Hunan and the Beiyang Government manages to achieve a major victory, but once again, army commander Wu Peifu halts the further advance southwards, instead proclaiming that he is willing to enter into negotiations with the south.\n\n1919[]\n\nDate Event Location Description Picture Early & Mid 1919 Shanghai Unification Negotiations North and South start negotiations in Shanghai about China's political future. The Southerners demand that all ties with Japan are to be cut and that the further expansion of the Beiyang Army is to be stopped, but the continued influence of Duan Qirui & the Anfu Club makes these demands unacceptable for the Northern government. Discussions drag throughout the year and are closely observed by the foreign powers. The neutral United States of America imposes a weapon embargo against China, hoping that this would prevent further conflict in the future. The Germans throw their diplomatic support behind the Guangzhou Government and the Zhili Clique, hoping that the termination of all Sino-Japanese treaties signed between 1912 and 1919 (including the Twenty-One Demands) would finally free China from Japanese influence. Late Summer 1919 Chinese Invasion of Outer Mongolia In late summer 1919, while the Shanghai negotiations are still ongoing, Duan Qirui suddenly orders his right-hand man, Xu Shuzheng , to invade Mongolia. Duan fears that the Shanghai Conference could spell an end to his far-reaching imperialist ambitions, as the Southern governors, the Zhili Clique, and most Western powers have turned against Japanese and Anhui influence in China for the sake of \"peace.\" To prepare for the worst, Duan plans to extend his sphere of influence northwards.\n\nThe Russian Civil War has left Mongolia without a foreign protector, and the country's long-running prime minister, Tögs-Ochiryn Namnansüren, died in April 1919, leaving the ruling elite deeply divided over a successor. This presents the perfect opportunity for the Anhui Clique to intervene. By autumn, all of Outer Mongolia, including Tuva, finds itself under the nominal control of the Chinese Republicl\n\nSeptember - November 1919 Versailles Peace Negotiations Europe Meanwhile in Europe, the Treaty of Versailles is signed on 6 November, de facto ending the Weltkrieg after more than five years of fighting. As per the terms of the treaty, Germany acquires all French posessions in China (Guangzhouwan, the settlements in Shanghai, Tianjin, Hankou and Shamian as well as the French-owned Kunming–Haiphong railway in Yunnan) and the Belgian concession in Tianjin. Austria-Hungary would later acquire the Italian concession in Tianjin. However, the situation in East Asia would remain unresolved: With Japanese troops in Kiautschou and their claims backed by treaty with China, the Japanese delegation would refuse to withdraw from the German posessions in China and the Pacific during the peace negotiations in September and October. Seeing this insistence as a potential obstacle to the very much desired end of the war, the British delegation does not support the Japanese motions to retain Kiautschou after German refusal in the first round of negotiations. Feeling isolated and insulted, the Japanese delegation walks out of the conference without signing any peace treaty (therefore remaining formally at war with the Central Powers) and the government in Tokyo officially denounces the Anglo-Japanese Alliance. 10 October 1919 Reorganisation of the Chinese Revolutionary Party into the Kuomintang (KMT) Sun Yat-sen's Chinese Revolutionary Party finds itself in a tremendous crisis - isolated and with many high-ranking leaders deceased, internal reform is required. Pressured by his few remaining loyal supporters, Sun convenes a party conference on 10 October in the French Concession in Shanghai. There, he formally reorganises the CRP into the Chinese Nationalist Party (Kuomintang), adopting the concept of \"national revolution\" and expanding party membership to address the lack of popular support for the CRP's actions. Sun aims to sway his former allies in the south, hoping this will enable his return to Guangzhou to continue his struggle against the Beiyang Government. October 1919 Anti-Anhui Clique Demonstrations & Breakdown of Unification Negotiations Documents leaked at the Versailles Peace Conference, held by the German Empire in occupied France, expose the Nishihara Loans granted by Japan to Duan Qirui between 1917 and 1918, also revealing that Duan personally promised Japan far-reaching concessions in Shandong (including the German posession of Kiautschou) in exchange for further loans. Protests break out in Beijing, but die down after a few days - however, even worse, the scandal would cause an immediate breakdown of the negotiations in Shanghai, with the Southern warlords leaving after learning of the vast corruption the government has been involved in in the last few months - even though it had mainly been the Anhui Clique who was responsible for the dubious agreements with the Japanese. Many accuse Duan's invasion of Mongolia to be orchestrated by Japan as well, with the secret goal to extend Japanese influence into Central Asia.\n\nThe Zhili Clique would promptly draw conclusions from this fiasco, planning to decimate Duan's last remaining influence once and for all. Tensions between the Zhili and Anhui Cliques have long been boiling in the background, and the sudden occupation of Mongolia as well as the Nishihara Scandal and the subsequent failure of the Shanghai Conference would be the straw that breaks the camel's back. With the old Feng Guozhang ailing and having withdrawn to his retirement home in Beijing (where he would die on 12 December 1919), two new figures emerge as the leaders of the Zhili Clique: Cao Kun, famous general, trusted associate of the late Feng and, since 1916, Governor of the province of Zhili, and Wu Peifu, the Zhili general who had been responsible for ending the Constitutional Protection War in mid-1918. Cao gets into contact with the Manchurian warlord Zhang Zuolin, leader of the relatively small Fengtian Clique, which is still considered to be a second-class force among the three Northern Beiyang Cliques, while Wu meets representatives from Yunnan and Guangxi at Hengyang, where they sign a treaty entitled \"Rough Draft of the National Salvation Allied Army\" (救国同盟军草约) in November: A new major alliance begins to form within China, this time targeting the Anhui Clique and Duan Qirui.\n\nWith Japan never signing the Treaty of Versailles, the war in the East inofficially continues, although permanently stuck in a frozen conflict. While German troops and ships begin to gradually arrive in Indochina, the German Chinese concessions and Pacific colonies are still in the grasp of the Empire of Japan, and as Japan stands to be the dominant naval power in the Western Pacific, a direct engagement between German and Japanese ships seems more than unlikely. At the same time, Japan is now internationally isolated and, since the collapse of the Anglo-Japanese Alliance, without a clear ally. While this may not be an immediate concern, there is little question that Japan will eventually need to face both a recovered Imperial Germany and the rising industrial power of the United States of America.\n\nThe Warring Cliques[]\n\n1920[]\n\nDate Event Location Description Picture Late January 1920 Dissolution of the Guangzhou Counter-Government Guangzhou After all remaining ministers refuse to attend the parliamentary assembly on 24 January, Cen Chunxuan officially declares the Canton counter-government dissolved. The city of Guangzhou is thus under the complete control of the Guangxi Clique, led by local warlord Lu Rongting. Early 1920 Second Yunnan-Sichuan War Another local conflict breaks out in Sichuan. The power struggle in 1917 had been won by the pro-Northern candidate Liu Cunhou at first (with the pro-Southern candidate Dai Kan being encircled and killed) - however, Liu's rule would not last long, as he himself was ousted in early 1918 by Xiong Kewu, a local warlord from Chongqing and a former associate of Cai E. Xiong had been supported by the Yunnanese troops of Tang Jiyao - however, even after the war was won and most of Sichuan was under the control of Xiong, Tang's troops were not willing to evacuate, still occupying large parts of Southern Sichuan. Eventually, Xiong started negotiations with Yunnan, to no avail: In early 1920, the situation escalates, triggering the Second Yunnan-Sichuan War. After only a few weeks, Chengdu finds itself under the siege of Yunnanese troops under Lü Chao, but Xiong manages to reconcile with his former enemy Liu Cunhou: By the end of the year, the province is back under local control and collapses back into infighting. April 1920 Formation of the Eight Provinces Anti-Anhui Alliance Cao Kun convenes a large meeting in Baoding with representatives from the provinces of Zhili, Hubei, Henan, Jiangsu, Jiangxi, Lianoning, Jilin and Heilongjiang, secretly forming the \"Eight Provinces Anti-Anhui Alliance\". At this point, almost all of China, the south and the north alike, has conspired against the Anhui Clique. One month later Cao orders Wu to relocate his troops, still stationed in Hunan, from Hengyang up to Baoding. July 1920 Outbreak of the Zhili-Anhui War In early July, the Zhili Clique pressures President Xu Shishang to remove Xu Shuzheng from the post of commander-in-chief of the Northwest Frontier Defense, drastically limiting Anhui influence in Mongolia and Northern China in general. Deeply angered, Duan Qirui forces the President to dismiss both Cao and Wu from their high-ranking positions, even though there is legally no possible way to actually remove them from their posts. At that point, everybody is aware that conflict is certain: Both the Anhui Clique and the anti-Anhui alliance begin to mobilize their troops, triggering the Zhili-Anhui War. August 1920 First Ye-Gui War Guangxi & Guangdong Sun Yat-sen's Kuomintang, still exiled in Shanghai, forges an alliance with Chen Jiongming, a minor warlord from Eastern Guangdong and an old associate of Sun during the Xinhai Revolution. Their goal is to expel Cen Chunxuan and Lu Rongting from Guangzhou before reunification with the north is achieved. In early August, Chen officially revolts against Cen and Lu, driving their forces out of Guangzhou with indirect support from Tang Jiyao. By the end of November, Sun and the Kuomintang return and establish a new rival government in the south, perpetuating the North-South divide. Cen Chunxuan relocates to Lu Rongting's power base in Nanning, vowing to reclaim Guangzhou but eventually retires due to old age. October 1920 Roman von Ungern-Sternberg invades Mongolia With Mongolia in anarchy after the Anhui collapse, the power balance in the region begins to shift. Two notorious Russian warlords in Transbaikal, Grigory Semyonov and his subordinate Roman von Ungern-Sternberg, both of which are known mongolophiles, see this as an opportunity to expand their little warlord fiefdom, which is mostly sponsored by the Japanese as an effort to weaken the Russian White Movement, southwards. Under Semyonov's orders, Sternberg crosses the Russian-Mongolian border in October 1920 and moves south-westwards, towards the Mongol capital, Urga. He is supported by Mongol nobles who seek independence from the Anhui remnants, who still occupy and ravage the country. Especially the Bogd Khan, who secretly sent Ungern his blessing for expelling the Chinese from Mongolia, hopes that his authority will be fully restored after the Chinese withdrawal. November 1920 Minju Incident Guizhou A military coup throws Guizhou into disarray. The province has been ruled by a clique of pro-Yunnanese military officers under the lead of Liu Xianshi since Tang Jiyao's invasion of the province in 1912, but this elite has become increasingly challenged by a clique of young, Kuomintang-associated reformers under Liu's nephew Wang Wenhua. With Yunnanese forces still fighting in the Sichuanese frontier, Wang seizes the opportunity and launches a coup, soon after purging most of the old guard in what becomes renowned as the \"Minju Incident\". While initially successful, Wang is shot only a few months later by one of his associates, with the province descending into infighting. Late November 1920\n\nWhile the Southern governors had declared their loyalty to the Zhili Clique the year prior, they would not actually take up arms against the Anhui, so the war is mostly limited to the North China Plains, especially around Beijing, Tianjin and Baoding, mostly along the major railway lines. Small clashes also take place in Shanghai. The Zhili Clique emerges victorious after a brief conflict; Beijing is captured, most Anhui troops are wiped out, the Anfu Club is dissolved and Mongolia plunges into anarchy without proper Chinese protection, with Chinese troops without clear leadership terrorizing the Mongolian population and pillaging cities. Duan Qirui and Xu Shuzeng both flee to the Japanese concession in Tianjin. In the aftermath, the Anhui Clique is practically dissolved; a few members defect either to the Zhili or the Fengtian Cliques, most of the Anhui governors would be removed from their posts throughout 1920/21, only the Anhui governors in Zhejiang and Shandong would endure until the mid-1920s. Wu Peifu is nationally credited as the strategist behind the Zhili clique's victory, while the Fengtian clique provided token support. Both cliques form a joint government in Beijing.\n\nWith the Zhili victory in the north, many are sure that now peace will finally prevail in China once and for all. Lu Rongting and Cen Chunxuan, still the most influential warlords in Southern China, use the Zhili victory as a pretext to explore unification with the north. This move is condemned by many Southern politicians and regional warlords however, who fear that renunification would mean a return to the old authoritarian central government, the revocation of all autonomy and the renewed suspension of the rightful Provisional Constitution, even though these fears are largely unjustified. Supported by the Yunnan Clique of Tang Jiyao, who is not really interested in unification as well anymore and instead wants to expand his power base on the south, the Guangzhou parliament relocates to Kunming.\n\n1921[]\n\nDate Event Location Description Picture January 1921 In early January, the Southern Parliament can finally move from Kunming back to Guangzhou. The Kuomintang soon would once again emerge as the most powerful force within parliament. With Cen Chunxuan and Lu Rongting out of the picture, there are only three persons that could possibly challenge Sun's rule now: Tang Jiyao, the governor of Yunnan, Wu Tingfang, an old guard revolutionary and Southern Chinese Minister of Foreign Affairs in his late 70s, and Chen Jiongming, who has expressed his explicit support for Sun's cause. With Tang busy in Yunnan, Wu ailing and Chen loyal, Sun's power remains uncontested: That is why in April, the National Assembly dissolves the military government and elects Sun Yat-sen \"Extraordinary President\", making him de facto dictator of the Guangzhou Government once again. However, the new Guangzhou Government, without any foreign recognition, is beset with questions of legitimacy as its form exists outside of the constitution it is mandated to protect. February 1921 Gu Pinzhen's Coup in Yunnan Meanwhile, Tang Jiyao is slowly losing his firm grip on Yunnan as forces in the shadows begin to conspire against him: Many local army commanders have grown dissatisfied with Tang's rule, who frequently starts pointless aggressive wars against neighboring provinces, especially the mountainous Sichuan, being responsible for the deaths of countless Yunnanese soldiers. Already in late 1920, after the disastrous Second Yunnan-Sichuan War, high-ranking military officer Gu Pinzhen secretly had met with fellow commanders to plan a mutiny against Tang. In February 1921, these plans are executed and Tang is ousted by a military coup in Kunming, forcing him to flee to Guangzhou, with his last remaining loyal troops under Long Yun retreating to Southern Yunnan and Guangxi. February 1921 Capture of Urga Mongolia The Mongolian capital Urga falls to Sternberg's troops, resulting in a surrender of the Anhui Clique remnants. Ungern's special detachment of Tibetans, Mongols, Buryats, and Russians rescues the Bogd Khan from house arrest and restore him to his rightful throne. Following the capture of the city, Sternberg orders the destruction of Chinese stores in the town and the execution of all Jews. A secret police is set up and begins to hunt down suspected Bolshevik and Chinese sympathisers, and soon, all of Mongolia is under the baron's control. April 1921 Sun Yat-sen becomes Dictator of the Guangzhou Government 6 October 1921 Second China Consortium An agreement is signed between the Republic of China, Japan, Germany, Britain, the US, and Russia about the reconstruction of the lapsed pre-war Six-Power Consortium, which previously had monopolised loans and investment to the Chinese central government. First proposed by the newly-elected McAdoo Administration in the summer of 1921, it is adopted by all relevant powers following considerable negotiations on 6 October 1921. The Consortium is intended to promote peaceful collaboration between great powers while aiding the economic development of China, a country long torn by civil conflict.\n\nThe signing of the consortium encourages Berlin to finally re-establish proper relations with the Japanese and the Russian Republic, both of which had remained in an uncertain limbus ever after the Japanese refusal to conclude peace in 1919/the end of the Russian Civil War respectively.\n\n6 November 1921 Tsingtao Accord Pressured by the international community, a proper peace agreement is finally signed between Germany and Japan, ending two years of diplomatic uncertainty between the two nations and officially putting an end to the war in East Asia. The status quo ante bellum is restored, with Japan, despite heavy protests at home, withdrawing from Tsingtao and the Pacific Islands. The Japanese withdrawal allows Germany to re-establish control over its Asian colonies, including the newly-annexed colony of Indochina. In Japan this diplomatic deal, trading all conquests from Germany for verbal recognition of long-established interests, proves to be unpopular, and the agreement is derided as a \"Second Triple Intervention\" by opponents, in reference to the humiliating experience of 1895 where similarly conquered territory was denied to Japan by a diplomatic intervention from Russia, Germany and France. In mid-November, as the last Japanese troops evacuate the city of Tsingtau and the surrounding areas, the Takahashi government collapses under condemnation and public pressure. Late 1921 Rising Tensions between Sun Yat-sen & Chen Jiongming Chen Jiongming, who enjoys significant autonomy in Eastern Guangdong under Sun's new government, invites anarchists, syndicalists, and federalists to the province, much to the dismay of Sun. The relationship between Chen and Sun begins to slowly deteriorate throughout the year. One of the radicals invited by Chen Jiongming is Peng Pai, a young anarchist, who eventually launches a peasant movement in the region of Hai-Lu-Feng under the auspices of Chen.\n\nMuch to the displease of Tang however, Sun Yat-sen and the KMT are quite sympathetic to the new warlord (as Tang's unreliability and unpredictability always had been problem), even confirming Gu as the new rightful governor - this would strain the relations with Tang in the long term. Sun would try to enter into enters into talks with Tang, offering him high-ranking positions in the Guangzhou Government to compensate him for his loss, but Tang declines, instead getting into contact with Chen Jiongming in Eastern Guangdong. Chen convinces Tang to return to Yunnan to oust Gu and reestablish himself as the rightful warlord of Yunnan in an effort to weaken the KMT's increasingly firm grip on the Southern provinces. He also promises Tang military support and slowly begins to recruit him for his own federalist agenda, unlike Sun, whose ideas promote Chinese Unitarism.\n\nWith Tang potentially on his side, Chen sets up a plan to further increase his influence in the south. His plan: invading Guangxi to expel the last remaining pro-Northern remnants around Lu Rongting to claim the province for the Guangzhou Government. Of course, the secret goal is to secretly expand his own sphere of control to keep Sun and the KMT in check. However, the plans are eventually dropped due to the arrival of German warships and colonial troops in formerly French Tonkin, which had been granted to them as per the terms of the Treaty of Versailles. Fearing a European intervention because of large troop movements along the unstable Sino-Vietnamese border, he refrains from invading the province (The historical second Guangxi-Guangdong war does not break out and Lu Rongting remains in power).\n\nMeanwhile, in Mongolia, Urga has fallen to Sternberg's troops and most Anhui garrisons on the countryside have surrendered, fled or been completely decimated. During the Battle of Urga in February, Ungern's special detachment of Tibetans, Mongols, Buryats, and Russians rescues the Bogd Khan from house arrest and restore him to his rightful throne. Chinese troops, civilian administrators and military commanders flee northwards and massacre any Mongolian civilians they encountere along the road from Urga to the Russian border. Following the capture of the city, Sternberg would order the destruction of Chinese stores in the town and the execution of all Jews: A secret police is set up and begins to hunt down suspected Bolshevik and Chinese sympathizers and soon, all of Mongolia is under White Russian control. Only a few weeks later, with the White victory in the Russian Republic, the forces of Alexander Kolchak move eastwards to crack down on the various Cossack warlord states in the Far East, most prominently Semyonov's: Semyonov calls his former subordinate to come to his aid, but Sternberg never responds, leading to the capture of Chita and the escape of Semyonov to Manchuria. Sternberg drops his former ambitions in Russia and solely focuses on his new power base in Mongolia.\n\n1922[]\n\nMeanwhile in the north, the Zhili Clique restores the legal system, reopens the National Assembly and finally forces the unpopular President Xu Shichang out of office, indeed reinstating Li Yuanhong as it had been promised. Li only accepts with the private assurances that warlord forces around Beijing be disbanded; while the Zhili Clique agrees, they would never honor their promise. Sun Yat-sen had been right: Li soon turns into an even powerless puppet than before, in reality most of the government is run by Cao Kun and Wu Peifu. With the Zhili Clique turning more and more corrupt, the Fengtian Clique in the north slowly begins to reorganize itself. Now only left with the provinces of Fengtian, Heilongjiang and Jilin (Rehe and Chahar had been lost to the Zhili following the armistice at Qinghuangdao), Zhang Zuolin begins to build up Manchuria as a well-defended fortress and reestablishes the mighty Fengtian Army from scratch with secret Japanese support, already preparing for a war against the Zhili in the near future\n\nDate Event Location Description Picture February 1922 Tang Jiyao recaptures Yunnan In February, Tang Jiyao gathers his forces to retake Yunnan, supported by Chen Jiongming, despite Sun Yat-sen's attempts to appease him. The forces of Gu Pinzhen are decimated in a decisive battle; while in posession of a much larger army, Gu's forces are disorganized and plagued by factionalism. With the support of local bandits, Tang leads a raid on Gu's headquarters and executes him for high treason. The remnants of Gu Pinzhen’s loyal men, under the command of Zhu De, Yang Ximin, Jin Handing and Fan Shisheng, manage to evade capture and execution and flee into Sichuan to the north. Some of them would eventually go to Guangzhou (and later on Shanghai), ending up in the service of Sun Yat-sen and the Kuomintang, while Zhu De would leave for Europe, becoming acquainted with left-leaning Chinese émigré circles. By mid-March, Tang has reestablished himself as governor and warlord of Yunnan. April 1922 Outbreak of the First Zhili-Fengtian War In Beijing, tensions rise between the Zhili and Fengtian Cliques ruling the unstable Beiyang Government. By 1921, the Zhili Clique, led by Cao Kun, has expanded its influence significantly, controlling formerly Anhui CLique-controlled Central and Eastern China. Meanwhile, the Fengtian Clique, led by Zhang Zuolin, faces geographic limitations in Manchuria and growing threats from the Zhili to the south, a stabilising Russia to the north, and an aggressive Japan to the east.\n\nJapan, having shifted support to the Fengtian Clique after the Anhui Clique's fall, is unhappy with Zhang Zuolin's weakening position. To counter the Zhili's growing power, Japan seeks to provoke a conflict without appearing as the aggressor. This opportunity arises when the Fengtian Clique removes Zhili-backed Premier Jin Yunpeng and replaces him with their own candidate, Liang Shiyi, without consulting their coalition partner. Liang, a former suppoeter of Yuan Shikai and member of the so-called \"Communications Clique\", a powerful interest group of bureaucrats, technocrats, and businessmen, soon finds himself being accused of \"selling out the country to Japan\" and the Fengtian Clique of \"pandering to imperialist powers\". Under pressure, Liang resigns.\n\nOn 10 April 1922, Zhang Zuolin, with Japanese and Guangzhou Government support, deploys his troops as an act of retaliation, triggering the First Zhili-Fengtian War.\n\n1 May 1922 Foundation of the Chinese Syndicalist Party Shanghai European-inspired far left-leaning ideologies begin to slowly emerge in China, most prominently the fledgling Syndicalist movement: Chen Duxiu, another important intellectual who had made himself a name during the New Cultural Movement, had been exposed to Western Syndicalism via European, especially French, agitators in the Shanghai International Settlement, slowly establishing himself as the uncontested leader of the fringe Chinese Syndicalist Party. With China being a primarily agrarian nation, Syndicalism however remains mostly limited to the large, often European-influenced metropolises on the coast. 18 June 1920 Conclusion of the First Zhili-Fengtian War While the Fengtian surprise attack initially forces the Zhili Clique to withdraw from Beijing to Hejian and Renqiu, but in May, thanks to the efforts of Wu Peifu, the Fengtian Army is outflanked and forced to retreat back to Manchuria. After the Zhili Clique captures Tianjin, European diplomats intervene and convince Cao Kun to agree to peace negotiations with Zhang Zuolin. Negotiations on a British warship anchored off the coast of Qinghuangdao result in the establishment of the new Zhili-Fengtian border at Shanhaiguan. On 18 June, an official peace treaty is signed, ending the First Zhili–Fengtian War with a resounding Zhili victory. Late June 1922 Expulsion of Sun Yat-sen by Chen Jiongming from Guangzhou After the war, a movement emerges to reunite the northern and southern governments by having Sun Yat-sen and Xu Shichang, presidents of the Guangzhou and Beiyang governments respectively, resign in favor of restoring Li Yuanhong as the president of a united Republic of China. Chen Jiongming in the south supports this idea, hoping Li's leadership would allow him to apply his federalist ideas. However, Sun and the KMT reject it, claiming Li would be a puppet of the military, as he was in 1916-17. Instead, Sun proposes the Northern Expedition, a military campaign to overthrow the Beiyang Government and establish KMT rule over China. The Guangzhou Government's troops, later known as the National Revolutionary Army (NRA), would march north, defeating warlords and aiming to free China from corruption and lawlessness. Their first target would be Lu Rongting in Guangxi, followed by a march through Hunan, Jiangxi, and Hubei, ultimately reaching Beijing and beyond.\n\nChen disagrees and favors peaceful unification, leading to a break with Sun. When the Beiyang Government recognizes Chen as the legitimate governor of Guangdong, he abandons Sun and swears loyalty to Beiyang. An anti-KMT revolt ensues in Guangzhou, and forces loyal to Chen attack Sun's residence and office. Under gunfire, Sun and his loyalists flee to Shanghai on a British ship, marking the end of the Second Constitutional Protection Movement. With Sun gone, Chen begins building a model province in Guangdong to promote federalism, and Lu Rongting in Guangxi supports the Beiyang Government.\n\nAugust 1922 Kuomintang secures Communard support Sun Yat-sen establishes the KMT's new headquarters in the Shanghai International Settlement, realising that both of his attempts to establish a KMT counter-government in the south failed due to his overreliance on the military forces of warlords and that he needs his own loyal forces if he ever wants his still hypothetical \"Northern Expedition\" to happen. With the help of his closest associates, which are at the time Chiang Kai-shek, Wang Jingwei and Hu Hanmin, Sun manages to secure the secret diplomatic support of the Commune of France. This support is driven by the influx of socialists into the party and France's desire to counteract the Zhili Clique, backed by their rivals Germany and Britain.\n\n.\n\nRise of the White Sun[]\n\n1923[]\n\nDate Event Location Description Picture April 1923 Yunnan-Guangxi War Guangxi As Tang Jiyao reestablishes his position in Yunnan, he tries to tighten his grip over all of Southern China again. An invasion plan of neighboring Guizhou, led by the subliminally pro-Zhili governor Yuan Zuming who seized power during the provinces's civil war in the early 20s, is indefinitely postponed in favour of a southward advance into Guangxi, the domain of another pro-Zhili warlord, Lu Rongting. Tang's secret ambition is to restore Sun Yat-sens Kuomintang Government in the aftermath - however, due to his forces de facto controlling both Guangxi and the capital city of Guangzhou, the true power would lay in the hands of Tang himself, who would finally arise as the most powerful warlord in the south. Late April 1923 Revolt of the New Guangxi Clique Guangxi Resistance against Lu Rongting in Guangxi begins to brew after the Yunnanese invasion as pro-Kuomintang officers start to rally against Lu, alienated by his subliminal pro-Zhili stance. Among them is Li Zongren, a local army commander who had distinguished himself as a brave fighter during the Constitutional Protection War in Hunan in early 1918. After his return to Guangxi, Li had gradually expanded his influence on the countryside under the pretense of suppressing bandit activities and would eventually form his own clique loyal to him within Lu Rongting's Guangxi Clique: the so-called \"New Guangxi Clique\", very similar to Wang Wenhua's reformist organisation in Guizhou. October 1923 Inauguration of Cao Kun as President of China In Beijing, the Zhili Clique's corruption is escalating, driven by their power-hungry leader Cao Kun. With both the President and Premier already puppets of the Zhili Clique, Cao aims to become President himself. In June, he intimidates acting President Li Yuanhong, who attempts to flee to Tianjin with the presidential seal but is abducted and forced to resign. To secure support from the National Assembly, Cao's men openly bribe and threaten members of parliament, undermining the Beiyang Government's legitimacy. In October, Cao Kun is inaugurated as President.\n\nShortly after, the assembly passes a new Chinese constitution, known as the \"Cao Kun Constitution\" or the \"Bribery Constitution.\" This hastily drafted document replaces the 1912 Provisional Constitution of Sun Yat-sen and is considered the most democratic and progressive in Chinese history. However, like its predecessors, it is ignored as the Zhili Clique maintains uncontested control over the government. The increasingly autocratic Zhili leadership causes dissension, particularly between Cao Kun and his former protégé, army commander Wu Peifu. As the Zhili Clique splits into Cao's Baoding Clique and Wu's Luoyang Clique, rumors of an internal power struggle arise. However, the threat from the Fengtian Clique to the north temporarily unites them.\n\n:\n\nWhen Tang Jiyao eventually invades Guangxi in April, triggering the Yunnan-Guangxi War, Li would openly declare revolt against his superior, an important factor which would lead to the downfall of Lu Rongting's \"Old Guangxi Clique\".\n\nAfter the capture of Nanning, Lu Rongting would flee temporarily to Shanghai, with his remaining loyal forces scattering all over Southern Guizhou and Hunan. As Tang does not have the capability to fully control Guangxi himself, he surrenders Nanning to Li Zongren's men, establishing a pro-Yunnanese and pro-KMT military administration in the city. Instead, Tang focuses his efforts entirely on capturing the city of Guangzhou. Chen Jiongming already awaits him on the border after being informed about troops movements in Guangxi, but eventually retreats to Huizhou, approximately 110 kilometres to the east of Guangzhou, when he realizes the the numerical superiority of the invaders. Following Chen's expulsion, Sun Yet-sen returns from Shanghai and rebuilds his KMT government in Guangzhou - already for the third time at this point. During his time in Shanghai, he has become more amenable to the left wing of the party due to the French aid which would later contribute to his consolidation of power in the south.\n\nSun's goal this time is not to overly rely on neighboring, opportunistic warlords, but to build his own power base from scratch. For that however, experienced, trained soldiers and military officers who would never question their loyalty to the generalissimo and the Kuomintang are needed: The aim of the Guangzhou Government is therefore the establishment of a modern military academy, akin to the famous ones in Baoding and Kunming, which brought forth the crème de la crème of modern China's standing armies' officer corps and general staffs. With secret French financial and diplomatic support, the so-called Whampoa Military Academy is established on Changzhou Island in Guangzhou; it would open its gates in early May of the following year. Apart from the newly gained French funds, Sun Yat-sen would also make use of gambling and opium trade to finance the construction of the academy and eliminate corruption within his own government's ranks.\n\n1924[]\n\nDate Event Location Description Picture Late January 1924 1st National Congress of the Kuomintang in Guangzhou (\"First Reorganisation\") Guangzhou Between 20 and 30 January, the 1st National Congress of the Kuomintang is held in Guangzhou. It is attended by almost 200 delegates and headed by Chairman Sun Yat-sen and the KMT Presidium, consisting of Hu Hanmin, Wang Jingwei, Lin Sen, Li Dazhao and Xie Jiu. High-ranking Communard advisors are also present. During the congress, the Central Executive Committee of the Guangzhou Government is elected and Sun Yat-sen's three major policies (close cooperation with the Commune of France, the continued struggle against imperialism/feudalism and the the alliance with minor leftist organisations throughout the country, like the Chinese Syndicalist Party or Peng Pai's anarchists) are officially confirmed. Spring 1924 Zhili-Anhui-Guangzhou Proxy Conflict in Sichuan Sichuan A proxy conflict over control of Sichuan erupts between the Zhili Clique, the remnants of the shattered Anhui Clique, and the Guangzhou Government when Beijing withdraws recognition of Xiong Kewu, the long-time most powerful warlord and de jure governor of the province. Instead, the Zhili clique starts to support Yang Sen, a Chengdu-based warlord and powerful commander of the Sichuan army. As a consequence, Xiong opportunistically throws his support behind the Kuomintang, while remnants of the Anhui Clique begin to fund the Chongqing-based warlord Liu Xiang. The province is ravaged by confrontations between the three warlords. Fighting eventually stalls between Yang & Liu, while Xiong is forced to flee to Guangzhou where he is eventually arrested due to alleged ties to Chen Jiongming's federalist movement. 20 May 1924 Roman von Ungern-Sternberg declares himself Regent of Mongolia Mongolia With the death of the Mongolian Bogd Khan, Roman von Ungern-Sternberg takes control of the Bogd Khan's imperial seal, declaring himself \"Regent of Mongolia\" until the next reincarnation is found. August 1924 Guangdong Merchant Corps Upising 15 September 1924 Outbreak of the Second Zhili-Fengtian War Northern China A territorial dispute over Shanghai stokes tensions between the Fengtian and Zhili Cliques. De jure, the port city is part of Jiangsu, a traditional Zhili domain under the local warlord Qi Xieyuan, but de facto, it has been governed from Zhejiang, one of the few provinces under the control of the dying Anhui Clique. When Zhili authorities demand the cession of the province to Qi's control, Zhang Zuolin and Sun Yat-sen pledge to defend neutral Zhejiang in an effort to weaken the Zhili Clique, expanding the conflict to the far north and far south: It is the beginning of the Second Zhili-Fengtian War. Autumn 1924 Split of the Zhili Clique into North and South Late October 1924 Beijing Coup Beijing After striking a secret deal with Zhang Zuolin, high-ranking Zhili commander Feng Yuxiang decides to backstab his superiors, launching the Beijing Coup in the heart of the Northern capital. Financially supported by the Japanese and the Fengtian Clique, Feng's troops occupy key government buildings within the city and block the roads leading in and out. President Cao Kun is captured, stripped of all of his ranks and put under house arrest.\n\nAfter the coup, Feng installs a new, more liberal President, the non-partisan Huang Fu. Huang initiates several reforms on Feng's behalf including the expulsion of Puyi from the Forbidden City and abolishing the role of the old bell and drum towers as the official timepiece. After Puyi's expulsion, he takes up residence in the German concession in Tianjin.\n\nAt that point, for the first time during the Warlord Era a true internal (but informal) split within the Zhili Clique can be noted: As the forces of Wu Peifu and Cao Kun are preoccupied with defending the Chinese northern frontier from invading Fengtian troops, they are not able to properly assist their subordinates in Eastern China. Cut off from support by the central government, the Zhili-aligned governors of Jiangsu, Fujian, Anhui and Jiangxi therefore form the so-called \"Southern Zhili Clique\", which would enjoy almost total autonomy over their own affairs, while Wu's forces in the north would become known as the \"Northern Zhili Clique\". Only connected by the greater goal of subjugating their common enemies, mistrust between the Northern and Southern factions would gradually rise throughout the coming decade.\n\nOne of the most important acts that manifests the foundation of the Southern Zhili Clique is the formation of the so-called Jiangsu–Zhejiang Allied Army, a direct alliance of Qi Xieyuan's Jiangsu province with Zhili-aligned Fujian to the south. Fujian always had been a core Anhui domain, but the long-reigning governor, Li Houji, had been ousted by the Zhili Clique in 1923 and replaced by the young and ambitious Sun Chuanfang. When Qi invades Zhejiang to gain control over the city of Shanghai, Sun would wholeheartedly support him to expand his own influence northwards. Shortly after, both governors would sign the above-mentioned alliance of convenience to resist invading forces from the north and south.\n\nMeanwhile in the north, Zhang Zuolin leads his forces down to Shanhaiguan and engages the troops of Wu Peifu. On 18 September, the opposing armies meet, with the battle drastically intensifying after 28 September. Fengtian assaults on Shanhaiguan are thrown back as Zhili forces take up defensive positions, enjoying geographical advantages. At this point, another Zhili victory still seems more than likely.\n\nUpon receiving news of the coup, the Fengtian commanders Zhang Zongchang and Li Jinglin use this opportunity to launch a major offensive and eventually break the Zhili's frontline, forcing them to retreat. Zhang Zuolin orders to pursue the demoralized Zhili troops and manages to win a major battle outside Tianjin; Wu then withdraws to Junliangcheng with the goal to take the train down to his power base in Henan and reorganize his troops, but these plans are interfered by the sudden and surprising intervention of yet another warlord: Yan Xishan of the Shanxi Clique. Yan, formerly a warlord very loosely affiliated with the Anhui Clique, had declared Shanxi's neutrality in the early '20s, devoting himself to the modernization of his province as he was well aware that Shanxi was not sufficiently developed to compete for hegemony with other warlords. Now however, he suddenly begins to support the anti-Zhili alliance out of pure opportunism: Yan always had been a very progressive-minded person and never had been very content with Cao Kun's ascension to the Presidency. His troops would capture the city of Shijiazhuang, severing the tracks of the Beijing–Hankou railway and therefore cutting Wu off from his associates in the south. Facing attacks from all sides, Wu and his 2000 remaining men are forced to embark on a transport ship in Tanggu in early November, sailing down to Eastern China where the Southern Zhili Clique can protect them from further Fengtian incursions. At this point, the war in the north is basically over.\n\nHowever, the situation in Eastern China does not exactly look bright as well. Under the orders of Zhang Zuolin, Zhang Zongchang would take the train down towards Shanghai via Anhui-controlled Shandong in an effort to root out the forces of Southern Zhili commanders Qi Xieyuan and Sun Chuanfang and stop them from reinforcing Wu. The attack would catch Qi and Sun on the wrong foot, as they mainly had expected a KMT attack from the south, but not a sudden Fengtian advance from the north. Soon, Sun and Qi find themselves cut off from each other and Qi is eventually defeated and flees to Japan in the last moment - ironically, the downfall of Sun Chuanfang's former ally would manifest his own rise to prominence only a few months later.\n\nMeanwhile, as agreed previously, Sun Yat-sen sends his newly-recruited and trained men northwards into Fujian to support Zhang against Sun Chuanfang's troops, but a rebellion by the Canton Merchant Corps, disgruntled by the Kuomintang's leftist rhetoric, as well as small-scalle insurrections loyal to Chen Jiongming break out in Guangzhou and Western Guangdong. Sun Yat-sen is eventually forced to order his troops to return, eventually putting down the uprising at home. The leaders of the Merchant Corps, most prominently Chen Lianbo, flee to British Hongkong in the aftermath. The short-lived campaign proves to be the first major conflict fought by cadets and officers trained at the newly-established Whampoa Military Academy.\n\nAfter 2 November the war is effectively over, with the Zhili losing all of their northern provinces to Zhang Zuolin's Fengtian Clique and Feng Yuxiang's forces, the so-called Guominjun (\"National Army\"): The myth of Zhili invincibility has been entirely shattered. However, fighting continues well into 1925 down in Zhejiang between Fengtian and Southern Zhili forces - but in Beijing, peace finally endures again for the time being. Northern China is divided among the victors, with Zhang Zuolin taking the prosperous North China Plain, while Feng's influence remains limited to the former Zhili territories in poor Northwestern China - this unfiar discrepancy would soon lead to tensions. A new provisional government under the famous Duan Qirui as figurehead is created to balance the interests of Feng and Zhang, but in return, Duan would be pressured to hand in Shandong, the last remaining Anhui-held province in China, to the Fengtian, de facto ending Anhui presence in China outside of the Beiyang Government. At the end of the year, renewed plans to hold negotiations for national reunification between Feng, Zhang, Duan and Sun Yat-sen become loud, with Sun travelling to Beijing for the first time in years; everything seems to be steering towards a bright future, but once again, this would turn out to be a mere illusion.\n\nIn Eastern Guangdong, suspecting Peng Pai's experiment in Hai-Lu-Feng is too connected to the Kuomintang and supported by the French, Chen Jiongming decides to stop and suppress it. Peng Pai then turns to the KMT and becomes a leading figure in its agrarian socialist wing. However, this wing is not wholeheartedly supported by the influential right-wing of the KMT and Peng’s proposal of setting up the Guangzhou Peasant Movement Training Institute (PMTI) is rejected. High-ranking KMT right-wingers claim that such movement would only lead to chaos and anarchy in the countryside and refrain the agrarian socialists from their experiment.\n\nMeanwhile in Tibet, the 13th Dalai Lama, who has ruled in Lhasa relatively isolated since the Xinhai Revolution, greatly expands and reforms his nation's infrastructure, building hospitals and schools, reforming the government to avoid political corruption, expanding the military, and allowing relatively free movement in and out of Tibet. To accomplish this, he orders Commander-in-chief Changra to purchase and train regiments with newly-purchased British Lee Enfield rifles. To pay for these soldiers, the Dalai Lama orders for additional taxes from the Tashi Lhunpo Monastery, whose steward, the 9th Panchen Lama, refuses. The Panchen Lama, whose authority in Tibetan Buddhism is nearly as high as the Dalai Lama’s, is punished by having his monastery cut off from government support: Sensing his imminent expulsion, the Panchen Lama flees to Mongolia.\n\nHowever, after the war, Huang would be replaced by a more pro-Japanese candidate under pressure of the Fengtian Clique, as he had not been willing to grant financial concessions to Japan, leading to the eventual return of Duan Qirui to Beiyang politics and the dissolution of the discredited National Assembly.\n\n1925[]\n\nDate Event Location Description Picture 12 March 1925 Death of Sun Yat-sen Unfortunately, the anti-Zhili coalition's efforts for a negotiated unification are fruitless, as Sun Yat-sen dies of cancer in Beijing in March, aged 58. China remains stuck in a fragile status quo, with tensions between the Fengtian Clique and Guominjun gradually increasing, while in the Guangzhou Government a dangerous power struggle among Sun's former must trusted associates begins to unfold itself. March 1925 Start of the KMT's Eastern Expeditions Guangdong, Guangxi, Yunnan Fearing a coup of influential military officers, the KMT launches an invasion of Eastern Guangdong, the Eastern Expedition. roughout the summer, the last remants of Chen Jiongming's forces are defeated, with Chen escaping to British Hong Kong. Further anti-KMT revolt attempts take place over the course of the rest of the year both in rural areas of Guangdong, such as that of Yunnan warlord and Old Guangxi Clique sympathizer Yang Ximin and Liu Zhenhuan or that of Tang Zimo, a former subordinate of ex-Sichuan warlord Xiong Kewu, but all of these can be crushed, with its leaders and participants either fleeing to Hong Kong or Sichuan or being outright executed. At the end of the summer, most of Guangdong is finally unified under the banner of the Kuomintang. April 1925 Second Yunnan-Guizhou War Guizhou Upon learning that Guizhou's governor Yuan Zuming has meddled in Sichuanese affairs to north, indirectly supplanting Tang's own influence in the Yunnanese-Sichuanese border region, Tang Jiyao launches the Second Yunnan-Guizhou War, ousting Yuan and replacing him with his own brother Tang Jiyu. The ability to directly exploit the resources Guizhou would increase Tang's financial revenues to further expand his army, enabling him to bolster his position in the south. Late April 1925 Partition of Shanghai Eastern China A truce is signed between Zhang Zongchang and Sun Chuanfang. Sun is recognised as the rightful governor of Fujian and Zhejiang as well as half of Shanghai, while Zhang is appointed governor of Shandong as well as the other half of Shanghai. Therefore, while the Second Zhili-Fengtian War had caused the defeat of the Zhili Clique in Northern China and the retreat of Wu Peifu to Henan and Hubei, the position of the Zhili-aligned warlords in Eastern China, especially Sun Chuanfang, remains largely untouched\n\nThe provinces of Jiangsu and Anhui are temporarily left under the control of warlords associated with the crumbling Anhui Clique as a neutral middle ground, though later that year, they are eventually deposed and replaced with Fengtian Clique generals, with Yang Yuting becoming governor of Jiangsu and Jiang Dengxuan governor of Anhui.\n\n30 May 1925 Shanghai Massacre & Outbreak of the May Thirtieth Movement Shanghai In the Shanghai International Settlement, an American-British concession open for international trade, the Shanghai Municipal Police is on high alert due to the British Revolution, ready to crack down on any kind of potential syndicalist agitation. In the end however, it would not be European agitators to light the fuse, but the Chinese themselves. KMT presence in the still divided city is at an all-time high, especially in the surroundings of the far-left Shanghai University. On 30 May 1925, violence breaks out when policemen try to break up a student demonstration, with several gunshots being fired and 9 persons dead: This so-called Shanghai Massacre triggers the May Thirtieth Movement, in which Chinese Syndicalists and the KMT take a prominent role. Throughout the next weeks, most of the city's infrastructure would completely collapse, martial law would be declared, with dozens of protestors and foreigners being killed. Late June 1925 Outbreak of the Canton-Hong Kong Strike & Shakee Massacre A spike of unrest breaks out in the south following the May Thirtieth Movement, culminating in the Hong Kong-Canton Strike which paralyses most of the local economy. Left-wing activism is ascendent, and contributes to worsening tensions in Guangzhou. The situation escalates when thousands of anti-imperialist protestors attempt to violently seize the island of Shamian, a joint British-German concession directly in the heart of Guangzhou. Shots are fired into the masses, with the consequent Shakee Massacre turning out more bloody than the earlier confrontation in Shanghai.\n\nThe incident in Shamian almsot causes an international crisis; an open invasion of Shamian by the KMT's leadership is only prevented after Communard diplomatic intervention, who cannot risk open conflict with Germany and Britain. Instead, an anti-colonial press campaign is initiated, with anti-European pamphlets being passed around in Guangzhou and Hong Kong and claiming that the British are planning to poison local water supplies. Devastating strikes the result, with 250,000 protestors demanding the withdrawal of the European powers in late July. Tensions at this point are higher than ever at any point in British-Chinese colonial history since the Boxer Rebellion.\n\nLate July 1925 Sichuanese War of Unification Sichuan In Sichuan, the bloody conflict between opposing warlord factions continues unabated. Although Liu Xiang ultimately defeated Yang Sen in 1924, emerging as the dominant warlord in Sichuan, the province's power balance remained fragile. Formerly Yunnan-aligned Guizhou warlord Yuan Zuming began causing trouble in the south, further complicating the situation.\n\nIn late July, Yang Sen, now supported by Wu Peifu from the east, invades Sichuan from Hubei, initiating the Sichuanese War of Unification. Liu Xiang quickly forms an anti-Yang alliance, which includes Yuan Zuming, and manages to defeat Yang later that year. Yang flees back to Zhili-controlled territory, leaving Liu victorious. However, Liu's tenuous alliance with Yuan Zuming significantly increases the latter's influence in the province, once again shifting the power balance in Sichuan.\n\n20 August 1925 Assassination Attempt on Liao Zhongkai 22 November 1925 Outbreak of the Anti-Fengtian War Fengtian In the North, tensions are gradually rising between Feng Yuxiang and Zhang Zuolin. Throughout the summer and autumn of 1925, both Zhang and Feng begin soliciting help from their former Zhili enemy, Wu Peifu. Seething at Feng's earlier betrayal during the Beijing coup, Wu eventually seals an alliance with the Fengtian Clique in late 1925. A new major war in China seems imminent.\n\nIn October, Guo Songling, a high-ranking Fengtian army commander who formerly served under Sun Yat-sen in the south, secretly defects to the Guominjun. On November 22, 1925, he suddenly lays siege to Mukden, striking directly at the heart of the Fengtian Clique. This marks the beginning of the Anti-Fengtian War, pitting the overstretched Guominjun against a coalition comprising the Zhili and Fengtian Cliques.\n\n25 November 1925 Establishment of the League of Five Provinces Eastern China Not all Zhili-aligned governors fight the Guominjun alongside Wu Peifu. Zhejiang warlord Sun Chuanfang, keen to expand his influence in the east, uses the chaos in the north to take full control of Shanghai and march into Fengtian-controlled Jiangsu and Anhui. On November 25, 1925, he establishes his new headquarters in the old southern capital of Nanjing as military governor of Jiangsu. This day is considered the founding date of the so-called League of Five Provinces and marks the clear split of the Zhili Clique into northern and southern factions, with Sun becoming effectively more powerful than his nominal superior Wu Peifu.\n\nThe Guangzhou Government, surprised by Sun's reluctance to support his Zhili comrades, tries to convince him to defect to the KMT. Sun, having recently fought against Zhang's armies, seems unwilling to suddenly side with the Fengtian Clique against the Guominjun solely due to his loose ties to the Zhili Clique. However, Sun refuses the offer and executes Wang Jingwei's emissaries. Wang retaliates by executing Sun's envoys.\n\nDecember 1925 Japanese-Mongolian Intervention into the Anti-Fengtian War Manchuria & Chahar On 24 December, in a stunning reversal of fortune, Guo's siege of Mukden is lifted by the intervention of the Japanese Kwantung Army, and Guo is killed. The Guominjun begins haemorrhaging soldiers, both from fighting and desertion, as it tries to hold off the combined armies of Wu Peifu and Zhang Zuolin. When the regent of Mongolia, Roman von Ungern-Sternberg, is brought into the conflict against Feng Yuxiang through ties to his and Zhang’s mutual sponsors, the Japanese, and begins to advance into Chahar, the Guominjun slowly withdraws from the northern borderands, focusing their strength on maintaining their presence in the North China Plain and Western China instead.\n\nMeanwhile in the south, the Kuomintang is in deep crisis about its future leadership. The main contenders in this uneasy struggle are the left-leaning Wang Jingwei and Liao Zhongkai and the right-leaning Hu Hanmin, with Whampoa Academy instructor and former close companion of Sun Yat-sen Chiang Kai-shek taking in a more moderate, centrist stance. Especially Liao Zhongkai is notably in favour of maintaining close relations with the Commune of France as well as the Chinese Syndicalist movement, which however is strongly opposed by the KMT right wing, backed principally by the New Guanxi Clique and Tang Jiyao in Yunnan. Tang originally had contested the KMT leadership as well, assuming it would fianlly manifest his position as the most powerful warlord in the south, but trouble in the neighboring province of Guizhou, refrain him ultimately from doing so.\n\n.\n\nOver the year, tensions within the Guangzhou Government would constantly rise, and the fact that no clear political leadership is in charge would severely weaken the morale among soldiers and politicians alike, leading to corruption and lawlessness on the countryside.\n\n- but the political struggle in Guangzhou continues, eventually culminating in a bloody assassination attempt on 20 August: Before a Kuomintang Executive Committee meeting, Liao Zhongkai is almost killed by five gunmen with Mauser C96 handguns as he steps out of his limousine, only barely surviving. Four of the five hitmen are killed by local security forces or commit suicide, the fifth however can be captured: He would be arrested, interrogated and later executed.\n\nUnder severe pressure, the gunman reveals his connections to a associate of Hu Hanmin. It becomes obvious that the KMT right-wing is behind the assassination attempt. Chiang Kai-shek and Wang Jingwei seize the opportunity to execute Xu Chongzhi and Hu Hanmin after finding evidence of their involvment. The rightists however would repudiate these claims, arguing that the assassination attempt had been a bid of Wang and Chiang to get rid of the increasingly dominant KMT right-wing. Nonetheless, Wang Jingwei assumes the position of generalissimo and Chiang becomes commander of the KMT's military, while Liao Zhongkai becomes acting president of the Gouangzhou KMT government. This move is especially criticized by Tang Jiyao, who soon begins to use anti-socialist rhetorics and slowly distances himself from the Guangzhou Government. His criticism of the new government would lead to a steady exodus of the right to Yunnan, however, the party remains unified for the time bein.\n\n. The wave of unrest that follows emboldens the Chinese Syndicalist Party to form the League of Chinese Syndicalists (LCS) in an attempt to broaden its support base. Although initially suspicious, the Kuomintang accepts the LCS into the \"United Front\".\n\nMeanwhile, the civil war in Britain has reached its peak, with thousands of loyalists fleeing the island by ship in all directions. With the London government barely exerting any influence anymore, the foreign politics of the United Kingdom completely come to a standstill. This would have drastic influence on the events in Canton and Hong Kong; with most of the Chinese citizens on strike and because of the aftereffects of the NYSE crash, the British economy in the city collapses completely and would remain paralysed for the following months. Anarchy threatens to prevail in the British concessions, with foreigners being attacked on the streets, but then, Claud Severn, Governor of Hong Kong, comes to a controversial decision which would have far-reaching consequences a later on: He strikes a deal with a former enemy. When the China Station of the Royal Navy withdraws from Hong Kong to Weihaiwei in late July (later that year even fully retreating to Australasia to put down insurrection), Severn contacts the German Governor-General of Indochina, in order to solicit support from Guangzhouwan to ensure the concession's safety as he still fears a full-blown KMT intervention. The Germans are all too happy to comply, and within a matter of days over 3,000 German troops take up positions in Kowloon and the New Territories, with the prospect of prompt reinforcement. The British concession on Shamian Island is temporarily occupied as well.\n\nAn anti-British and anti-German boycott continues for several more months, even though the heavily-armed presence of German colonial troops calms down the situation over time. Still, the local economy remains mostly paralysed and Hong Kong's total trade falls by 75% and shipping diminishes by over 60%. The Chinese warlords of the north use the incident as a pretext to further their own political aims: While Feng Yuxiang threatens to attack European interests via force and demands a public apology, Zhang Zuolin, who effectively controls Shanghai's Chinese outskirts, has his police and soldiers arrest protesters and socialists and assist the Settlement forces in their stabilization efforts.\n\nBerlin soon unilaterally extends their offer of protection to all of Britain’s concessions in China until the restoration of “responsible British Government” could be ensured, an offer soon echoed by virtually every power with a presence in the country. In what would soon come to be called the “Shanghai Scramble”, German and Japanese troops begin a series of standoffs across the remaining concessions, re-igniting tensions ostensibly extinguished with the Tsingtao Accord only four years prior. The American “China Marines”, the 15th Infantry Regiment and the Philippine Division (under Brigadier-General Douglas MacArthur) soon join the bloodless struggle, later followed by token forces from Austria-Hungary and the Russian Republic. Though Austrian and Russian forces depart after only two months, this general state of affairs persists for nearly two years, as the respective sides delineate informal areas of control within the former British quarters and regularly butt heads.\n\nIn Central China, Wu Peifu establishes his new power base in Wuhan, Hubei, militarily supported by Zhili-aligned Hunan Governor Zhao Hengti. There, sends out messages to various surrounding provincial governors preemptively declaring the new Beijing government illegitimate, proclaiming himself the defender of the legitimate national government, and calling for support. His attempt to form a \"Coalition of 14 Provinces\" however fails spectacularly when most governors, even his Zhili associate Sun Chuanfang, respond much less enthusiastically than he expected - it has become clear that he has lost most of his sway over the country. However, much surprinsingly, the Germans, concerned abount the imminent push by the French-backed KMT to unify the country, contact Wu by the end of he year with the intention of planning to eventually interfere directly in the conflict in China, promising him to support him diplomatically and financially.\n\nDuring the revolutionary chaos in India, Tibetan troops occupy Ladakh in the Chinese-Indian borderlands.\n\nShowdown in the East[]\n\n1926[]\n\nDate Event Location Description Picture Early 1926 Expulsion of Yuan Zuming from Sichuan Sichuan In Sichuan, Liu Xiang, disgruntled with Yuan Zumings steadily increasing influence in the south of the province, strikes a deal with his former enemy, Yang Sen, who has relocated to Hunan where he is propped up with Zhili and German equipment for yet another offensive into Sichuan. Throughout the early months of the year, Yuan Zuming is expelled from the province by a united offensive of Liu's and Yang's forces. Following that, "
