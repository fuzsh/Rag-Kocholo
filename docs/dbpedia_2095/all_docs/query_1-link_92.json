        "text": "Foreword\n\nAccording to the book Explaining Simple and Analyzing Compound Characters, [1] the traditional Chinese character “dang,” meaning “party” or “gang,” consists of two components (called radicals) that correspond to “promote or advocate” and “dark or black,” respectively. Putting the two radicals together, the character means “promoting darkness.” “Party” or “party member” (which can also be interpreted as “gang” or “gang member”) carries a derogatory root meaning.\n\nConfucius said in The Analects, “A gentleman is proud without being aggressive, sociable but not partisan.” [2] The footnotes of The Analects explain, “People who help one another conceal their wrongdoings are said to be forming a gang (party).” [3] In Chinese history, political cliques were often called “peng dang” (cabal). It is a synonym for “gang of scoundrels” in traditional Chinese culture, and the meaning implies ganging up for selfish purposes.\n\nWhy did the Communist Party emerge, grow, and eventually seize power in contemporary China? The Chinese Communist Party has constantly instilled in the minds of the Chinese people that history chose the Party, that the people chose the Party, and that “without the Party, there would be no new China.” Did the Chinese people choose the Communist Party? Or did the Communist Party “gang up” and force Chinese people to accept it? We must look to history to find the answers.\n\nFrom the late Qing Dynasty (1644–1911) to the early years of the Republic period (1911–1949), China experienced tremendous external shocks and extensive attempts at internal reform. Chinese society was in painful turmoil. Many intellectuals and people with lofty ideals wanted to save the country and its people. However, in the midst of national crisis and chaos, their sense of anxiety grew, leading first to disappointment and then to complete despair. Like an ill patient who will turn to any available doctor for a treatment or cure, they looked outside China for a solution. When the British and French styles failed, they switched to the Russian method. They did not hesitate to prescribe the most extreme remedy for the illness, in the hope that China would quickly become strong.\n\nThe May Fourth Movement in 1919 was a thorough reflection of this despair. Some people advocated anarchism, others proposed to overthrow the doctrines of Confucius, and still others suggested bringing in foreign culture. In short, they rejected Chinese traditional culture and opposed the Confucian doctrine of the middle way. Eager to take a shortcut, they advocated the destruction of everything traditional. On one hand, the radical members among them did not have a way to serve the country. On the other hand, all of the members believed firmly in their own ideals and will. They felt the world was hopeless, believing that only they had found the right approach to China’s future development. They were passionate for revolution and violence.\n\nDifferent experiences led to different theories, principles, and paths among various groups. Eventually, a group of people met Communist Party representatives from the Soviet Union. The idea of “using violent revolution to seize political power,” lifted from the theory of Marxism-Leninism, appealed to their anxious minds and conformed to their desire to save the country and its people. They immediately allied with each other and introduced communism, a completely foreign concept, to China.\n\nAltogether, 13 representatives attended the first national congress of the CCP. Later, some of them died, some ran away, and some, betraying the CCP or becoming opportunistic, worked for the occupying Japanese and became traitors to China, or quit the CCP and joined the Kuomintang (Chinese Nationalist Party). By 1949, when the CCP came to power in China, only Mao Zedong and Dong Biwu remained of the original 13 Party members. It is unclear whether the founders of the CCP were aware at the time that the “deity” they had introduced from the Soviet Union was, in reality, an evil specter, and the remedy they sought for strengthening the nation was actually a deadly poison.\n\nThe All-Union Communist Party (Bolsheviks), having just won its revolution, was obsessed with ambition for China. In 1920, the Soviet Union established the Far Eastern Bureau, a branch of the Third Communist International, or the Comintern. The Comintern was responsible for the establishment of communist parties in China and other countries. Boris Shumyatsky was the head of the Far Eastern Bureau, and Grigori Voitinsky was a deputy manager.\n\nThey began to prepare for the establishment of the CCP with Chen Duxiu and a handful of other founding members. The proposal they submitted to the Far Eastern Bureau in June 1921 to establish a China branch of the Comintern indicated that the CCP was controlled by the Comintern. On July 23, 1921, under the direction of Vladimir Abramovich Neiman-Nikolsky and Henk Sneevliet (who went by the pseudonym Maring) from the Far Eastern Bureau, the CCP was officially formed.\n\nThe communist movement was then introduced to China as an experiment, and the CCP has since set itself above all, conquering all in its path, and thereby bringing endless catastrophe to China.\n\nA majority of the general secretaries of the CCP have been labeled anti-communist. Clearly, the CCP has a life of its own, with its own independent body. The Party runs the officials; the officials do not run the Party.\n\nIn the “Soviet regions” [44] of Jiangxi Province, while the CCP was encircled by the Kuomintang and could barely survive, it still conducted internal cleansing operations in the name of cracking down on the Anti-Bolshevik League, [45] executing its own soldiers at night or stoning them to death to save bullets. In northern Shaanxi Province, while sandwiched between the Japanese and the Kuomintang, the CCP began the Yan’an Rectification Movement of mass cleansing, killing many people. This type of repetitive massacre on such a massive scale did not prevent the CCP from eventually expanding its power to rule all of China. The CCP expanded this pattern of internal rivalry and killing from its small revolutionary enclaves to the whole nation.\n\nThe Party is like a malignant tumor: In its rapid development, the center of the tumor has already died, but it continues to diffuse to the healthy cells on the outer edges. After the cells are infiltrated, new tumors grow. No matter how good or bad a person was to start with, after joining the CCP, he or she would become part of its destructive force. The more honest the person was, the more destructive he would become. Undoubtedly, this CCP tumor will continue to grow until there is nothing left for it to feed upon. Then, the cancer will surely die.\n\nThe founder of the CCP, Chen Duxiu, was an intellectual and a leader of the May Fourth student movement. He showed himself not to be a fan of violence and warned the CCP members that if they attempted to convert the Kuomintang to the communist ideologies or had too much interest in power, it would certainly lead to strained relationships. While being one of the most active members of the May Fourth generation, Chen was also tolerant. He was then the first to be labeled a “right-wing opportunist.”\n\nAnother CCP leader, Qu, believed that CCP members should engage in battles and fighting, organize rebellions, overthrow authorities, and use extreme means to return Chinese society to its normal functioning. However, Qu confessed before his death: “I do not want to die as a revolutionary. I had left your movement a long time ago. Well, history played a trick, bringing me, an intellectual, onto the political stage of revolution and keeping me there for many years. In the end, I still could not overcome my own gentry notions. I cannot become a warrior of the proletariat class after all.” [46]\n\nThe CCP leader Wang Ming, at the advice of the Comintern, argued for unity with the Kuomintang in the war against the Japanese, rather than expanding the CCP base. At Party meetings, Mao and Zhang Wentian [47] could not persuade this comrade, nor could they reveal the truth of their situation: that due to the limited military strength of the Red Army, they would not be able to hold back even a division of the Japanese by themselves. If the CCP had decided to fight the Japanese, then the history of China would certainly have been different. Mao was forced to remain silent at the meetings. Later, Wang was ousted, first for a “left-wing” deviation, and then for being an “opportunist” of the right-wing ideology.\n\nHu Yaobang was a Party general secretary (the head of the CCP) who was forced to resign in January 1987. He had won back the Chinese people’s support for the CCP by bringing justice to many innocent victims who had been criminalized during the Cultural Revolution. Still, in the end, he was kicked out.\n\nZhao Ziyang, the CCP’s fallen general secretary, [48] wanted to help the Party to further reforms, yet his actions brought him dire consequences.\n\nSo what could each new leader of the CCP accomplish? To truly reform the CCP would imply its death, and the reformers would quickly find their power taken away by the CCP itself. There is a certain limit to what CCP members can do to transform the CCP system, so there is no chance for any reformation of the CCP to succeed.\n\nIf the Party leaders have all turned into “bad people,” how could the CCP have expanded the revolution? In many instances when the CCP was at its best — also its most evil — its highest officials failed in their positions. This was because their degree of evil did not meet the standard of the Party, which has, over and over, selected only the most evil of people. Many Party leaders have seen their political lives end in tragedy, yet the CCP has survived. The CCP leaders who survived their positions were not those who could influence the Party, but those who could comprehend the Party’s evil intentions and follow them. They strengthened the CCP’s ability to survive while in crisis and gave themselves entirely to the Party. It's no wonder Party members were capable of battling with heaven, fighting with the earth, and struggling against other human beings. But never could they oppose the Party. They are tame tools of the Party or, at most, symbiotically related to the Party.\n\nShamelessness has become a marvelous quality of today’s CCP. According to the Party, its mistakes were all made by individual Party leaders, such as Zhang Guotao [49] or the Gang of Four. [50] Mao was judged by the Party as having made three parts mistakes and seven parts achievements, while Deng judged himself to have made four parts mistakes and six parts achievements, but the Party itself was never wrong. Even if the Party was wrong, well, it is the Party itself that has corrected the mistakes. Therefore, the Party tells its members to “look forward” and “not to be tangled in past accounts.” Many things can change: The communist paradise has been replaced by the lowly goal of socialist food and shelter; Marxism-Leninism has been replaced by the “Three Represents.”\n\nPeople should not be surprised to see the CCP promoting democracy, allowing freedom of belief, abandoning Jiang Zemin overnight, or redressing the persecution of Falun Gong, if it deems that doing so necessary to maintain its control. There is one thing that never changes about the CCP: the fundamental pursuit of the Party’s goals — the survival and maintenance of its power and control. The CCP has mixed violence, terror, and high-pressure indoctrination to form its theoretical basis, which has then turned into the Party nature, the supreme principles of the Party, the spirit of its leaders, the functioning mechanism of the entire Party, and the criteria for the actions of all CCP members. The Communist Party is as hard as steel, and its discipline is as solid as iron. The intentions of all members must be unified, and the actions of all members must be in complete compliance with the Party’s political agenda.\n\nConclusion\n\nWhy has history chosen the Communist Party over any other political force in China? As we all know, in this world there are two forces, two choices. One is the old and the evil, whose goal is to do evil and choose the negative way. The other is the righteous and the good, which will choose the right and the benevolent way.\n\nThe CCP was chosen by the old forces. The reason for the choice is precisely because the CCP has gathered together all the evil of the world, Chinese and foreign, past and present. It is a typical representative of the evil forces. The CCP took the greatest advantage of people’s inborn innocence and benevolence to cheat, and, step by step, it has prevailed in gaining today’s capacity to destroy.\n\nWhat did the Party mean when it claimed that there would be no new China without the Communist Party? The evidence shows that without deceit and violence, from the CCP’s founding in 1921 to its rise to political power in 1949, the Party would not be in power. The CCP differs from all other types of organizations in that it follows a twisted ideology of Marxism-Leninism and does as it pleases. It explains all that it does with high theories and cleverly links them to certain portions of the masses, thus “justifying” its actions. It broadcasts propaganda every day, clothing its strategies in various principles and theories and proving itself to be forever correct.\n\nThe development of the CCP has been a process of accumulating evil, with nothing glorious at all. The history of the CCP itself precisely shows its illegitimacy. The Chinese people did not choose the CCP. Instead, the CCP forced communism, this foreign evil specter, upon the Chinese people by applying the evil traits that it inherited from the Communist Party — evil, deceit, incitement, unleashing the scum of society, espionage, robbery, fighting, elimination, and control.\n\nThis concludes Commentary Two.\n\nNotes:\n\n[1] Xu Shen (c. 58–148), Shuowen Jiezi.\n\n[2] Confucius (551 B.C.–479 B.C.), The Analects.

However, in the Chinese “modern” drama, opera, and ballet, she is described as a girl who is forced to flee to a cave after her father is beaten to death for refusing to marry her off to an old landlord. She becomes white-haired for lack of nutrition. This became one of the most well-known “modern” dramas in China and inspired class hatred toward landlords.\n\n[8] Roughly translates as “slum workers.” This term, coined by Marx in The Class Struggles in France (1848–1850), identifies the class of outcast, degenerate, or underground elements that make up a section of the population of industrial centers. It includes beggars, prostitutes, gangsters, racketeers, swindlers, petty criminals, tramps, chronic unemployed or unemployables, persons who have been cast out by industry, and all sorts of declassed, degraded, or degenerated elements.\n\n[9] Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels, The Communist Manifesto (1848).\n\n[10] Mao Zedong, 1927.\n\n[11] Zhou Enlai (1898–1976) was second in prominence to Mao in the history of the Chinese Communist Party.

In 1931, he was arrested by the Kuomintang and assisted them in uncovering many of the CCP’s secret agents. All eight members of Gu’s family were later strangled to death and buried in the French concession in Shanghai.\n\n[13] The War of Liberation of June 1946 was the civil war between the CCP and the Kuomintang. The war is marked by three successive campaigns — Liaoxi-Shenyang, Huai-Hai, and Beiping-Tianjin — after which the CCP overthrew the rule of the Kuomintang, leading to the founding of the People’s Republic of China on Oct. 1, 1949.\n\n[14] Chiang Kai-shek (1887–1975), also called Jiang Jieshi, was leader of the Kuomintang and later exiled to become the ruler of Taiwan.\n\n[15] Hu Zongnan (1896–1962), a native of Xiaofeng County (now part of Anji County), Zhejiang Province, was successively deputy commander, acting commander, and chief of staff of the Kuomintang’s southwest military and administrative headquarters.\n\n[16] Li Xiannian (1909–1992) was one of the senior leaders of the CCP.

It was largely successful in these objectives. During the Northern Expedition, the CCP had an alliance with the Kuomintang.\n\n[25] The revolutionary movement during the CCP–Kuomintang alliance that carried out the Northern Expedition.\n\n[26] Sun Yat-sen (1866–1925) was the first leader of the Kuomintang and often described as the founder of modern China.\n\n[27] Tan Pingshan (1886–1956) was one of the early CCP leaders in Guangdong Province.\n\n[28] Feng Jupo (1899–1954) was one of the early CCP leaders in Guangdong Province.\n\n[29] Lin Zuhan (1886–1960), also known as Lin Boqu, was one of the earliest CCP members.\n\n[30] Peng Pai (1896–1929) was a CCP leader.\n\n[31] Zhang Shenfu (1893–1986), also known as Zhang Songnian, was one of the founders of the CCP who induced Zhou to join the CCP.\n\n[32] The National Revolutionary Army, controlled by the Kuomintang, was the National Army of the People’s Republic of China. During the period of the CCP–Kuomintang alliance, it included CCP members who joined the alliance.\n\n[33] On April 12, 1927, the Kuomintang, led by Chiang Kai-shek, initiated a military operation against the CCP in Shanghai and several other cities. More than five thousand CCP members were captured and many of them were killed by the end of 1927 in Shanghai.\n\n[34] The Jinggang Mountains area is considered the first rural revolutionary base of the CCP and is called “the cradle for the Red Army.”\n\n[35] Mao Zedong, Report on an Investigation of the Peasant Movement in Hunan (1927).\n\n[36] Ibid.\n\n[37] Liaoxi-Shenyang, Beijing-Tianjin, and Huai-Hai battles were the three major battles the CCP fought with the Kuomintang, from September 1948 to January 1949, that annihilated many of the Kuomintang’s crack troops. Millions of lives were lost in these three battles.\n\n[38] Lin Biao (1907–1971), a senior CCP leader, served under Mao Zedong as vice premier under Zhou Enlai (from 1954), as vice chairman (from 1958), and as defense minister (from 1959). Lin was designated as Mao’s successor in 1966 but fell out of favor in 1970. Sensing his downfall, Lin reportedly became involved in a coup attempt against Mao and tried to flee to the USSR once the alleged plot became exposed. He died in a plane crash in Mongolia.\n\n[39] Qu Qiubai (1899–1935) was one of the CCP’s earlier leaders and famous leftist writers. He was captured by the Kuomintang in late February 1935 and died on June 18 that year.\n\n[40] The “Three Represents” was initially mentioned in a speech by Jiang Zemin in February 2000. According to this doctrine, the Party must always represent the development trend of China’s advanced productive forces, the orientation of China’s advanced culture, and the fundamental interests of the overwhelming majority of the Chinese people.\n\n[41] Zhang Bojun (1895–1969) was one of the founders of the China Democratic League, a democratic party in China. He was classified as the No. 1 rightist in 1957 by Mao and was one of the few rightists who were not redressed after the Cultural Revolution.\n\n[42] Luo Longji (1898–1965) was one of the founders of the China Democratic League. He was classified as a rightist in 1958 by Mao and was one of the few “rightists” who were not redressed after the Cultural Revolution.\n\n[43] Pu Yi, or Aisin Gioro in Manchurian (1906–1967), was the last emperor of China. After his abdication, the new republican government granted him a large government pension and permitted him to live in the Forbidden City of Beijing until 1924. After 1925, he lived in the Japanese concession in Tianjin. In 1934, he became the emperor of the Japanese puppet state of Manchuria. In 1945, he was captured by the Russian army and became a prisoner until 1950, when he was handed over to the Chinese Communist Party. In 1946, Pu Yi testified at the Tokyo War Crimes Tribunal that he had been the unwilling tool of the Japanese militarists and not, as they claimed, the instrument of Manchurian self-determination. He was imprisoned at Shenyang until 1959, when Mao granted him amnesty.\n\n[44] The \"Soviet regions\" were not Soviet at all, but rather were revolutionary enclaves set up by the CCP in the provinces of Hubei, Henan, and Anhui during the time of rebellion against the Kuomintang, prior to Japan’s invasion in World War II.\n\n[45] In this episode during the CCP’s internal struggle in 1930, Mao ordered the killing of thousands of party members, Red Army soldiers, and innocent civilians in Jiangxi Province, in an attempt to consolidate his power in the CCP-controlled areas.\n\n[46] Qu Qiubai. “A Few More Words.” May 23, 1935. Written shortly before his death on June 18, 1935.\n\n[47] Zhang Wentian (1900–1976) was an important leader of the CCP, beginning in the 1930s. He was deputy foreign minister of China from 1954 to 1960. He was persecuted to death during the Cultural Revolution. His case was redressed in August 1979.\n\n[48] Zhao Ziyang (1919–2005) was dismissed as general secretary and put under house arrest due to his disagreement with using force to end the student demonstrations in the Tiananmen Square massacre in 1989.\n\n[49] Zhang Guotao (1897–1979) was one of the founders of the CCP. He was expelled from the CCP in April 1938. He went to Taiwan in November 1948, then to Hong Kong in 1949. He immigrated to Canada in 1968.\n\n[50] The Gang of Four was formed by Mao Zedong's wife, Jiang Qing (1913–1991), Shanghai Propaganda Department official Zhang Chunqiao (1917–2005), literary critic Yao Wenyuan (1931–2005), and Shanghai security guard Wang Hongwen (1935–1992). They rose to power during the Cultural Revolution and dominated Chinese politics during the early 1970s."
