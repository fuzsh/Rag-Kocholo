        "text": "Ryan Ramsey gave the Quad Cities River Bandits another quality start Tuesday evening, and Trevor Werner hit a home run for the second straight game.\n\nWith those two leading the way, the Bandits opened this week’s six-game homestand at Modern Woodmen Park against the Midwest League-leading Wisconsin Timber Rattlers with a solid 5-0 victory.\n\nThe victory snapped QC’s two-game losing streak and moved the Bandits to 48-54 for the season. QC is now 18-19 in the Western Division second-half race.\n\nIt was just the second shutout loss of the season for Wisconsin (65-37, 22-13 in the second half that still leads the division).\n\n“It’s really good to get off to a good start in the series and win that first one,” QC manager Brooks Conrad said. “It was a well-played game all the way around. Really good pitching. The guys played the heck out of the defense and got some timely hitting. That leads to a good chance to win the ball game.”\n\nRamsey pitched five shutout innings, allowing three hits. It was his fourth straight start allowing no more than one run. He walked one batter and struck out six, matching his season high.\n\n“I’ve been getting in a good flow of things,” Ramsey said after evening his record at 3-3 and dropping his ERA to 2.50. “Working with (pitching coach Derrick Lewis) and simplifying the approach. That’s been the goal since the very beginning is to fill up the zone. That’s when games have been iffy for me when the walks have been up.”\n\nThe addition of a consistent and reliable curveball has been a difference-maker for the 23-year-old, who has walked 26 and fanned 74 in 68 1/3 innings.\n\n“He’s been doing really well all year,” Conrad said of Ramsey. “He’s kind of tweaked and perfected some of his off-speed stuff and been able to stay in the zone more effectively, and it’s paid off.”\n\nHe left after five innings, turning things over to Oscar Rayo (two innings, one hit), Chazz Martinez (one inning, one hit) and Natanael Garabitos (one hitless inning) to close out the victory.\n\n“Rayo and Chazz did an excellent job pitching out of jams and showed their resilience,” said Conrad, who watched the Rattlers strand 10 runners on base.\n\nListen now and subscribe: Apple Podcasts | Google Podcasts | Spotify | RSS Feed | SoundStack | All Of Our Podcasts\n\nQC scored in both the first and third innings after two were out — both frames in which Kansas City's highly touted rookie Jac Caglianone made the second out.\n\nIn the first, Carson Roccaforte singled home Spencer Nivens, who had doubled ahead of Caglianone.\n\nIn the third, it was again Nivens getting things started with a one-out single. Werner then laced a fastball for a two-run homer over the fence in left field off Wisconsin starter Patricio Aquino (L, 3-4).\n\n“It’s been a seasonlong progression, but all the work in the cages and BP and all that is a good feeling that it is finally paying off,” said Werner, who upped his season total to nine. “Seeing pitches better and laying off pitches I shouldn’t be swinging at and doing damage on pitches I should be swinging at. It’s a good recipe when you’re swinging at the strikes and taking the balls.”\n\n“Getting those runs early and getting Ramsey some breathing room was really good,” Conrad said.\n\nCaglianone picked up his first professional base hit in his third at-bat. In the fifth ininng, he ripped a 110 mile per hour liner to the wall in right for a double. He finished 1-for-4.\n\nThe Bandits added a pair of insurance runs in the eighth when Omar Hernandez singled in Roccaforte and Justin Johnson, both of whom reached on two of QC’s three walks in the frame.\n\nWisconsin recorded five hits in the game, three of those doubles by Cooper Pratt — his first three two-baggers of the season.\n\nQC lived dangerously late in the game as the Timber Rattlers loaded the bases in the eighth with one out. However, Martinez, who hit two batters in the frame as he pitched into a jam, got out of it without any runs scoring.\n\nThe series is scheduled to resume Tuesday evening at MWP. QC is scheduled to start right-handed pitcher Ethan Bosacker (3-1, 1.69 ERA) against Wisconsin left-hander Brian Fitzpatrick (4-1, 2.83 ERA).\n\nAnother promotion: While the Bandits did add two to the roster this week, they lost one of their most reliable pitchers as Chase Wallace was promoted to Class AA Northwest Arkansas.\n\nHe is the eighth Bandit player to move up this season.\n\nThe 25-year-old right-handed reliever made 27 appearances for Quad Cities this season recording a 1-3 record with a 2.82 ERA. His 0.83 WHIP was the best among Midwest League relievers with at least 17 appearances. In his third season in the Quad-Cities, he walked just nine batters while striking out 38.\n\nLove\n\n0\n\nFunny\n\n0\n\nWow\n\n0\n\nSad\n\n0\n\nAngry\n\n0\n\nGet in the game with our Prep Sports Newsletter\n\nSent weekly directly to your inbox!\n\n* I understand and agree that registration on or use of this site constitutes agreement to its user agreement and privacy policy.\n\nTom Johnston\n\nsports writer/golf editor\n\nGet email notifications on {{subject}} daily!\n\nYour notification has been saved.\n\nThere was a problem saving your notification.\n\n{{description}}\n\nEmail notifications are only sent once a day, and only if there are new matching items.\n\nFollowed notifications\n\nPlease log in to use this feature\n\nLog In\n\nDon't have an account?
