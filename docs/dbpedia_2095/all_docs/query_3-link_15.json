        "text": "II. THE UNITED FRONT IN THE NORTHWEST\n\nTrue to its claim, the CCP policy of opposing Japanese aggression had been of long standing. As early as April 12, 1932, the Chinese Central Soviet Government in Kiangsi formally declared war on Japan. In subsequent years the CCP continuously poured out statements demanding that the Red Army be allowed to march northward to fight the enemy. During the Fukien Incident the CCP and the 19th Route Army reached and signed an agreement under the title “Anti-Japan and Anti-Chiang Preliminary Agreement.” 1 On the occasion of dispatching the Northward Anti-Japanese Vanguards shortly before the Long March, the CCP also issued a declaration on the “Northward Anti-Japanese Movement of the Chinese Red Army.”2\n\nThe CCP “United Front” Strategy\n\nEqually cogent is the CCP claim that they had long advocated the “united front.” The earliest evidence was a manifesto jointly issued by the Central Soviet government and the Red Army on January 10, 1933, laying down some conditions for signing an agreement with any armed units for opposing Japanese aggression. Later, they had circulated the so-called “five great programs for war against Japan” and “six programs for military resistance to Japan.”3 So far the CCP attempt at forming an alliance had been a “united front from below,” chiefly confined to the military sphere. The real turning point came with the August 1, 1935 Manifesto which formally introduced a “united front” policy on a national scale, but which was designed and proclaimed in Moscow without the knowledge of the CCP leaders then in China.\n\nThe gist of the Manifesto is summarized here:\n\n1. Chinese affairs should be solved by the Chinese. However criminal and treacherous the KMT and the Blue-Shirt Club have been, Japan has absolutely no right to meddle with them.\n\n2. All parties and groups and all walks of life should put aside their divergent political views and inter ests, suspend the civil war, and unite themselves in the struggle against Japan and for salvation of the nation.\n\n3. An anti-Japanese allied army will be organized.\n\n4. A national defense government composed of all parties, groups, and professions will be established to carry out the responsibility of resisting Japan and saving the country by implementing the following measures:\n\na) Resist Japan and save the country by the recovery of lost territory.\n\nb) Relieve famine, prevent floods in order to stabilize People's livelihood.\n\nc) Confiscate all the properties of the Japanese in China in order to finance the war with Japan.\n\nd) Confiscate all the properties, grains and land of the Chinese traitors to be handed over to the poor brethren and anti-Japanese fighters for their use.\n\ne) Abolish onerous taxes and fees, regulate currency and finance, and develop industry, agriculture, and commerce.\n\nf) Increase salaries and wages and ameliorate the life of workers, peasants, soldiers and officers, and students and teachers.\n\ng) Practice democracy, liberty and free all political prisoners.\n\nh) Promote free education and provide jobs for unemployed youth.\n\ni) Carry out the policy of equality for all nationalities in China and protect the freedom of life, property, residence, and the business of overseas Chinese in China and in foreign countries.\n\nj) Unite with all antiimperialist masses (toiling masses inside Japan and peoples of Korea and Taiwan) as our allies and unite with all nations who are sympathetic to the Chinese liberation movement, and establish friendship with all those nations which maintain goodwill and neutrality in the anti-Japanese war of Chinese People's liberation. 4\n\nThe full text of the August 1 Manifesto, and the background in which it was written were not known to Mao Tse-tung and his CCP Central until the arrival of Chang Hao, the CCP delegate to the Comintern, in November 1935 and not known by Chang Kuo-t'ao and his CCP Central, who had remained in Hsikang, until January 1936.5 On the basis of the August 1 Manifesto, the CCP at its Politburo meeting held at Wayaopao, North Shensi, in December 1935 adopted the “Resolution on the Current Political Situation and the Task of the Party,” which in the main served as the official party line from that time onward. This resolution, while maintaining intact the ten programs of the August 1 Manifesto just quoted above, differed from it on a few crucial points.6\n\nFirst, the united front enunciated in the December 1935 resolution was to be formed both “from below” and “from above,” as all those, including the national bourgeoisie, who were opposed to the Japanese imperialists, were included regardless of individual origin, parties, groups, and classes. However, it singled out Chiang Kai-shek as traitor along with the Japanese imperialists to be opposed.\n\nIn the second place, the peasant policy of the resolution showed a marked departure from the past radical policy of the “poor peasant line” prevalent throughout the Kiangsi Soviet period. Under the new peasant policy, “rich peasants in the Soviet territory would enjoy the same rights as the poor peasants in the distribution of land.” Although landlords as a class were automatically included in the united front and landlords were specifically given full political rights, yet no mention was made concerning the land the landlords owned, nor their right to own land. Ironically, the resolution repeatedly stressed the importance of the solution of the land problem as well as the fundamental principle of linking the land revolution and the national revolution together.\n\nIn the third place, not only was the CCP determined to retain the Soviet—a point which was not touched upon in the August 1 Manifesto—but it also wanted the Soviet to be expanded so as to serve as the base of resistance against Japan and to vie for the CCP leadership in the People's united front. But the name of the “workers' and peasants' Soviet republic” was slightly changed by substituting the word “People's” for “workers' and peasants'” in order to include the whole Chinese people.\n\nUnder the slogan of resistance against Japan and promotion of the “united front,” in spite of the fact that a more important reason may have been the solution to the food shortage, the main force of the Red Army crossed the Yellow River in western I Shansi on February 20, 1936. In connection with the February eastern expedition, the CCP issued a circular telegram entitled “Convocation of a National Congress for War of Resistance against Japan and National Salvation,” calling for immediately convening the national congress, formally establishing a national defense government, and joining all forces in fighting Japan.7\n\nShansi was the home and power base of the warlord, Yen Hsi-shan. This sophisticated warlord made some hasty preparations to fend off the enemy, appealed to Nanking for more troops to help defend his territory, and introduced some social measures to fight Communism. Yen adopted the “Regulation for Common Land-Ownership in Villages,” “Follies of Communists and the Critique of Communism,” and “Distribution of Land According to Labor and Assurance of Products.” He also organized the people into a “Group for Justice” and a “Group for Protection against Communists.”8 Unfortunately for Yen, all these improvisatory measures were either too late to bring about the expected effect or too radical to be implemented; he failed to stop the Communists.\n\nNot until after the Red Army had invaded forty-eight counties of Shansi and eight divisions of the Central Army of Chiang Kai-shek had arrived on the scene, did the Red Army make a successful withdrawal to the west of the Yellow River, taking with them the provisions they had seized in Shansi. 9 But upon crossing back to Shensi, the CCP issued a passionate declaration under the title “Armistice and Negotiation for a Joint Resistance Against Japan” on May 5, 1936. Unlike previous declarations, this declaration was addressed to the Nanking national government, all parties, groups, and armed forces of the whole nation, and all Chinese who were unwilling to become slaves. It is important to note that the declaration revealed a fundamental shift in CCP strategy. Whereas in the December 25, 1935 Resolution, Chiang Kai-shek was considered the enemy of the Chinese people and equated with the Japanese imperialists, the May 5, 1936 declaration sounded like a direct appeal to Chiang himself, as shown in its central passage: 10\n\nThe Soviet central government and the Red Army, after repeated deliberations, recognize that in the face of national exigency, no matter who is victorious in the decisive battle, the result will be the loss of strength in Chinese national defense, a.result which will only please the Japanese imperialists.… In order to urge Chiang Kai-shek and his patriotic military subordinates to awake at last, we, though having won many victories in Shansi, have still withdrawn the People's Anti-Japanese Vanguards to the west bank of the Yellow River. This move was intended to show to the Nanking government… and the whole people of China our sincerity.… We solemnly urge the leaders of the Nanking government to consider our views: at the critical turning point of national extinction, it is only reasonable that we should suddenly repent and let the spirit of unity in fighting foreign aggression prevail over “the fighting between brothers outside the wall.” In the country as a whole, we must first stop fighting in the Shensi, Kansu, and Shansi area and on both sides must send representatives to discuss and formulate concrete methods for national salvation. This will be the fortune not only of your gentlemen but also of our country and people. Should you continuously refuse to repent your role as Chinese traitors, then your days and rule will certainly be numbered as you will be cursed by the people of the whole country.\n\nApart from public statements like the May 5, 1936 Declaration appealing to Chiang Kai-shek and the Nanking government to terminate civil war, the CCP also sent its representatives to approach the KMT leaders personally. Chiang himself revealed that the CCP representative made the first contact with the KMT at Hong Kong in the fall of 1935. About the time when the CCP issued its May declaration, negotiations between the KMT and the CCP virtually had started between Ch'en Li-fu, Chiang's protégé in charge of party affairs, and P'an Han-nien, the CCP negotiator with the 19th Route Army during the Fukien Incident. The KMT-CCP negotiations then taking place at Shanghai and Nanking may not have led to a successful conclusion because the KMT put forward some exorbitant demands: (1) believe in the San-min chu-i [ Three principles of the people]; (2) obey the command of Generalissimo Chiang; (3) abolish the Red Army which will be reorganized into the national army; and (4) abolish the Soviet which will be changed into a local government. 11 On the other hand, however, the CCPTs incessant propaganda and passionate overtures gradually took effect on the Tungpei Army, particularly its commander the Young Marshal who was responsible for terminating the Red Army in the northwest.\n\nThe New Base for the Young Marshal\n\nEven before the Communists ended their Long March and settled in North Shensi in late October 1935, Chiang Kai-shek had transferred the Young Marshal and his Manchurian army to Shensi, then still the base of the warlord Yang Hu-ch'eng (1883–1949). Yang, a bandit in origin, had a long revolutionary career, being a general of the 2nd Kuominchun (People's Army) commanded by Hu Ching-i in the early 1920s. Yang gained fame in the defense of the city of Sian under an eight-month seige by another warlord Liu Chen-huan in 1926. Later Yang curried the favor of Chiang Kai-shek, especially in the latter's contest with Feng Yü-hsiang in 1930, and thus succeeded in maintaining his semiindependent status while paying Chiang his allegiance. 12\n\nEarlier in 1927, when Yang's army was nominally under Feng Yü-hsiang's command, it had undergone internal transformation from a typical, feudal force into a more progressive, revolutionary army under the influence of political workers sent by the Wuhan Left regime. One noticeable result was the penetration of the Communists into his army. Despite the fact that Yang followed Feng Yü-hsiang in purging the Communist elements from his army, some Communists managed to survive until 1936, even holding important posts. 13 Further, Yang, in spite of his lack of education, was not at all resistant to revolutionary ideas, as long as they did not limit his power.\n\nWith the arrival of the Long Marchers in North Shensi, Chiang Kai-shek immediately turned his attention to Sian, the center of the northwest whose political and military structures were to be reorganized and geared to the needs of punitive war against the Reds. Whatever the change, it was certainly at the expense of Yang's power and interest. Yang conceded the governorship of Shensi to Shao Li-tzu, a long-time friend of Chiang Kai-shek; in the military realm he retained his post as Pacification Commissioner of Shensi but his prestige and power were overshadowed by the newly created Northwestern Headquarters of Bandit Suppression (NHBS).\n\nWhile Chang Hsüeh-liang was vacillating in accepting the appointment as Vice Commander-in-Chief of the NHBS, Yang showed some goodwill toward Chang by dispatching a message of welcome to him. 14 Moreover, Chang also saw the opportunity of using the northwest as his base to regroup his scattered forces in North China and to give his leadership to his fellow men from Manchuria. In the reshuffling of the Shensi and Kansu provincial governments, Chang's man, General Yu Hsüeh-chung, was made governor of Kansu. Indeed, before long, Chang had made Sian the haven of those exiled from Tungpei (Northeast or Manchuria).\n\nSince the Tungpei Army was transferred to the northwest, not only had the families and relatives of the troops followed and moved to Shensi, but many Tungpei people from other parts of China, mainly from North China, had also come to seek new opportunities in jobs or business. The Young Marshal had no choice but to try to help these people resettle in the northwest. He therefore undertook a gigantic construction program; villages for Tungpei refugees, hospitals, schools, and factories were built by funds out of his own pocket. He also moved the engineering school of the Tungpei University with a view to transferring the whole university to Sian. 15\n\nNaturally the Young Marshal found his situation in Sian quite different from that at Hankow in 1934–1935, during which period he was surrounded by Chiang Kai-shek's men, his own force was scattered, he had no political base, and most of all, he lacked mass following. Now in the northwest, his situation had improved greatly, for the Tungpei people began to play a dominant role in many phases of life in the two provinces of Kansu and Shensi. As for Chang himself, he was still only a man in his midthirties with tremendous energy and imagination; he had his responsibilities, difficulties, and burdens, but he also drew consolation from helping people, from leading his troops and the Tungpei people, and from his destiny and ambition to recover his homeland and to become great. But his great mission and ambition had to be put off for the sake of immediate duty—to destroy the Reds.\n\nChang had never been interested in fighting the Communists. During the Hopei crisis in June 1935 when Yü Hsüeh-chung, governor of Hopei who was also the commander of the 51st Army of Tungpei, was forced to quit Hopei by the Japanese demand, Chang was greatly aroused and said: “My compatriots previously blamed me for not offering resistance to Japan; now I hope that the leader, Chiang Kai-shek, will change my appointment, not letting me fight the Communists but the Japanese, for I feel that to die in fighting the Communists is not as worthy as to die in fighting the Japanese.”16 As long ago as in his Hankow period, the Young Marshal recommended to the Central Government that the policy of “internal pacification before resistance to external aggression” should be changed. He was convinced that “the success of German and Italian Fascism did not lie so much in their ideology as in their expansive policy which restored national rights and gained glory for the people; in so doing, their leaders won strong support from the people. Conversely, the Chinese government recovered territory inch by inch in a civil war, while it lost its territory to the foreign aggressors 'province by province'; certainly it would lose the support of the people; and as a result the government and the people must perish together.”17\n\nDisenchanted with the policy of suppressing the Communists as he had been, the Young Marshal was optimistic and gladly assumed his post as acting Commander-in-Chief of the NHBS in the hopes that the few thousand remnants of Communists in the area would be easily liquidated in a short time and that the consolidation of the new base for the war of resistance against Japan could be started soon. 18 To his dismay, the first encounter between the Tungpei Army and the Red Army came as a surprise. In late October 1935 when the 67th Army commanded by Wang I-che marched toward North Shensi along the line from Fuhsien, Kanchuan to Yenan (then called Fushih), his two divisions were waylaid by the local Shensi Red Army at Loshan near Kanchuan. Commander Ho Li-chung of the 110th Division was killed, and more than three thousand soldiers and officers in the lower ranks were taken prisoners; among them was a regiment commander of the 107th Division named Kao Fu-yüan, who later turned out to be instrumental in linking the Tungpei Army with the CCP. Less than a month later, in mid-November, another Tungpei division, the 109th, commanded by Nu Yüan-feng, was routed by the Red Army at Chihlochen in western Shensi. Nu was captured and he as well as several regiment commanders later committed suicide. 19\n\nOne might wonder what gave the spectacular victory to the Red Army? Though the Red Army was better trained in guerrilla war fare, suitable for the mountainous terrain of North Shensi, the Tung-pei Army was much better equipped and the ranking officers of both divisions in question were strongly dedicated to their goals. By virtue of the fact that all the high-ranking officers of the two divisions—except one who was captured and another who escaped back to Sian—gave up their lives, their high morale cannot be doubted. It was not the fighting strength of the Red Army that overwhelmed the two divisions, but rather the propaganda that disarmed them. When.the Red Army propaganda team sang the song, “My Home is on the Sungari in the Northeast,” it had an instant nostalgic effect on thesehome-sick men. The rank and file were even more moved by the slogans of the Red Army, such as “Chinese must not fight Chinese!” and “Unite with us and fight back to Manchuria!”20 All those Tungpei Army men captured in these two campaigns became the first members of the training school for captives.21 It had been the policy of the CCP that those captured KMT soldiers and low-ranking officers were given the choice between remaining in the Red Army and returning to the KMT areas. Those who decided to leave were set free with some pocket money. Understandably special efforts were made to indoctrinate the Tungpei captives, particularly the regiment commander, Kao Fu-Yüan, who was received by Chairman Mao Tse-tung and other CCP leaders. Upon their return, Kao and most of those captured became willing propagandists of the CCP “united front” line.\n\nEven before the repatriation of the captives from the Soviet area, the Young Marshal took the stunning defeat and the loss of two divisions and one regiment with a heavy heart and began to toy with the idea of seeking a “peaceful” solution as he wrote:\n\nFirst the 110th Division was annihilated and its commander Ho Li-chung was killed. This was followed by the total defeat of the 109th Division and its commander Nu Yüan-feng died in refusing to surrender. These two division commanders were among the best in the Tung-pei Army. Twice terrible defeats have inflicted great pain on my heart; they further reinforced my belief that it was regrettable that outstanding generals had to sacrifice their lives for the sake of civil war. At the same time I no longer disparage the fighting strength of the Communist bandits. Thus, the thought of using “peaceful” means to solve the Communist issue was kindled in my heart. 22 (Emphasis mine. )\n\nIndeed the Tungpei Army was never again engaged in such a life and death struggle with the Red Army as in these two campaigns. One reason, of course, was that the Tungpei Army was wise enough not to be trapped again. Also there no longer seemed a need for such hard fighting, inasmuch as the CCP was determined to win over the Tungpei Army to the united front. In January 1936, the CCP organized the White Army Work Committee with Chou En-lai and Chang Hao (alias Lin Yü-ying) as secretary and deputy-secretary respectively, a group mainly devoted to penetration and propaganda work in the Tungpei and Hsipei Armies.23 it was clear to the CCP leaders that the mere survival of the Communists in North Shensi, let alone victory in fighting Japan, hinged upon how successful they could be in winning over the Tungpei Army, the largest non-Chiang force in the northwest, a prize the CCP was determined to win.\n\nOn January 25, 1936, the Red Army issued “An Open Letter to All the Officers and Soldiers of the Tungpei Army,” in which it pointed out that “Chiang Kai-shek transferred the Tungpei Army to Kansu and Shensi with the intention that the two willing and resolute anti-Japanese armies, the Tungpei and Red Armies, would make great sacrifice and suffer colossal losses.” It further pointed out that “Chiang sent his own stooges to spy on, supervise, or split the Tungpei Army from within. Therefore, the Tungpei Army have no other choice but resistance against Japan and opposition to Chiang. The workers' democratic government and the Red Army are willing to unite with the Tungpei Army and to organize the national defense government and the allied army in order to fight the Japanese joint-ly.” 24\n\nRiding the tide of the national movement generated by the December 1935 student demonstrations, the CCP appeal to the Tungpei Army to end civil war and unite with the Red Army in order to resist Japan had a greater result than had been anticipated. Further, the Red Army moved into Shansi in February for the purpose of marching northward to face the Japanese aggressors, a duty which the Tungpei Army could not help feeling was its own. In fact, not only were most of the young officers of the Tungpei Army aroused and prepared to accept the “united front” doctrine, but even the Young Marshal himself was quite moved. Here he recalled the situation:\n\nIt was then that the Communists roared out the song of ending civil war and resisting Japan together. This did not merely win my heart, but it captured the minds of the majority of the Tungpei Army, particularly the young officers. As no progress had resulted from further campaigns against the Communists, I began to think myself that my own policy had failed, and therefore I consulted with my subordinates for their views. As a result, proposals for making contact with the CCP and Yang Hu-ch'eng for cooperation, suspending the bandit-suppression campaign, conserving our own strength, and uniting with others in the resistance against Japan were advanced. 25\n\nThe Young Marshal had many reasons to see the wisdom of ending civil war which he had always abhorred. His view of the Chinese Communists deserves some elaboration. While far from being a scholar, the Young Marshal had learned a great deal from his advisers and secretaries, many of whom were professors and returned students from Japan and Western countries. In addition, through the years of fighting the Communists, actually since 1926, he had acquired some knowledge of Communism and had been familiar with the Chinese Communist issues. In his view, the surge of Communism in China must be attributed to imperialist aggression. It was the imperialist oppression of China that drove the Chinese intellectual elite to Communism. For Chang knew this by his own experience. Earlier in 1932, when two professors along with several students of the Tungpei University were arrested by the Central Government on the charge of being Communists and were brought to Nanking, the Young Marshal as president of the University intervened and brought about their release. 26 As for the poor people who joined the Communists, Chang blamed the imperialists. Imperialist aggression had reduced China to the status of a semicolony. China had lost her tariff autonomy, and foreign goods were inundating the markets. That not only prevented her infant industry and commerce from normal growth but even helped create widespread economic depression and rural bankruptcy, a result that drove thousands of people to the Communist ranks. Indeed, he was convinced that “if the Communists are the greatest enemy of China, their origin is still the imperialists.”27\n\nWith his long view of the Chinese Communists as has been described, Chang had no difficulty in convincing himself that the CCP overture was sincere. He would not mind taking the initiative in approaching the Communists. Still in Hankow in 1934 he gave support to General Li Tu, an anti-Japanese hero, for his return to Manchuria where he would carry on partisan warfare. Chang assigned Ying Te-t'ien, his secretary, and Chao I, formerly a brigade commander, to accompany Li to return to Manchuria via the Soviet Union. In Manchuria they would have to make contact with the Communists who had been fighting a guerrilla war there. Although Li's group did not reach Manchuria but instead returned to China, the Young Marshal knew that Li had connections with the Communists. Now he asked Li to contact the Communists on his behalf. Li sent a certain Liu Ting, a Communist, to Sian. 28 Liu told Chang that the Communists wished to come to Sian to talk with Chang in person but were afraid for their safety. Finally Chang decided to go to: Shanghai himself. Probably in late February 1936 the Young Marshal met Pan Han-nien in a Western restaurant in Shanghai. Nothing came out of the meeting, partly because of Chang's imposing posture as though he demanded nothing short of Communist surrender, and in part because of PanTs ambiguity in presenting the CCP position.29 But there was no question that the CCP leaders at Paoan, North Shensi, realized that the Young Marshal was willing to negotiate with the CCP.\n\nWhile the Young Marshal's personal attempt to reach some understanding with the CCP may have failed in late February and early March 1936, the CCP took the diplomatic offensive, so to speak, by releasing the Tungpei captives, including nearly all the officers. The impact of their return, though the full extent is still difficult to judge, must have been tremendous. What they had learned during their captivity probably had little to do with Communism or revolution. It is safe to say that they must have become well versed in the language of the “united front” which had gained popularity since the December 1935 student movement. This language could have been reduced to a simple formula such as the following: “Japan wants to terminate the existence of China and all Chinese will become slaves of the Japanese. No matter how deep and intolerable our hatred and enmity may have been, we Chinese must no longer fight each other, for we must be united to fight the enemy and to save our country. Those who are rich give their money; those who are powerful give their strength. Once we are united, not only shall we be able to drive the Japanese out of North China, but we shall recover our three lost northeastern provinces!” The plain truth as represented in this argument would have been sufficient to convince any Chinese soldier, had he not been denied the opportunity to listen to it. The effectiveness of this argument would have been magnified when presented to the homesick, disappointed, and alienated Tungpei officers and soldiers whose hope had been exactly the same as shown in the argument.\n\nThe first convert of the Tungpei high-ranking officers to the “united front” doctrine was no other person than Wang I-che, the defender of Mukden during the “September 18 Incident” of 1931 which led to the fall of the whole of Manchuria to Japan. As already noted, Wang's 67th Army, to which the bulk of the repatriated captives were returning, suffered a stunning defeat and colossal losses at the hands of the Red Army. It was not unnatural that Wang, more than any other Tungpei high-ranking officer, was willing to lend his ears to the accounts of the Soviet episodes given by his returned comrades-in-arms, notably his regiment commander Kao Fu-Yüan.30 Like Edgar Snow who visited the Soviet area a few months after the release of the Tungpei captives, Kao and other returned captives needed only to tell Wang what they actually had seen and heard. That the Communists desperately wanted to save themselves from destruction by the KMT suppression campaigns was beyond doubt, but that question seemed as irrelevant to Wang as it is to us today. The crucial fact that their immediate goals—to resist Japan—were identical and that their mutual need—to cease killing each other—was real must have occupied the mind of Wang. Without delay he sent Kao to the Young Marshal to report the same to him.\n\nChang, of course, listened to Kao and other returned captives attentively, but being the head of the Tungpei Army, Chang in all his activities in the northwest was under close, constant watch by Chiang Kai-shek's men who were all over the northwest. There was another consideration on his part, i.e., to maintain the morale of his army still facing the Red Army at the front. Chang was extremely cautious and thus revealed no sign whatever that he was persuaded or influenced by Kao's and others' reports. On the contrary, as for those returned captives who talked vociferously or tended to spread rumors, Chang without hesitation punished them severely. It looked as if the Young Marshal had put the “united front” issue to rest for the time being. His overt negative response to the reports of the returned captives and his punishment of some of them were quite understandable under the circumstances. But all this had aroused much resentment among his young followers whose faith had been cherished by him.\n\nAmong Chang's young followers, two groups stood out as influential: the small civilian bureaucracy under Chang was dominated by the graduates from the Tungpei University who held most of the middle-ranking posts; in the military, nearly all officers except a few top-ranking generals were graduated from the Tungpei Chiang-wu T'ang. These like-minded young officers, most of them inclined to the left, some of them Communists, formed a coterie which exerted a great influence as the summer of 1936 wore on. 31\n\nThis elite group was enlarged by the arrival of two Communists from Peking. Shortly after his arrival at Peking in February 1936, Liu Shao-ch'i sent Ma Shao-chou and Sung Li as student representatives from Peking to Sian. Their mission was to sound out the Young Marshal's attitude toward the “united front.” Ma, though a graduate of the Tungpei University, thought that they really risked their lives when they approached the Young Marshal and asked him to support the “united front.” To their surprise, Chang received them with great calm; not only was he undisturbed by the idea of the “united front,” but he was even pleased with their appeal. At once they were asked to remain in Sian to work for him. Later, Ma was responsible for the establishment of the political training school, a haven of refugee students from North China. As this nucleus grew in strength, it took an organizational form called the “Society of Comrades for Resistance against Japan” (K'ang-Jih t'ung-chih hui). All its members were young and middle-ranking civilian and military officers, except one who was a division commander. 32 Their names as far as we know included Kao Ch'ung-min, Tsou Ta-p'eng, Ying Te-t'ien, Li Yu-wen, Tu Wei-kang, Kao Fu-Yüan, Ch'en Hsü-tung, Chang Ch'ien-hua, Miao Chien-ch'iu, Ma Shao-chou, Sung Li, Chieh Ju-chuan, Liu Lan-po, Sun Ming-chiu, and Hsiang Nai-kuang. Although the group was non-Communist, Communist influence must have been very great. Besides Ma and Sung, who were Communists, there were other Communists in this group, namely, Li Yu-wen, Chang Ch'ien-hua, Chieh Ju-chuan, Liu Lan-po, and Hsiang Nai-kuang. An invisible hand to direct the policy of the “Society of Comrades for Resistance Against Japan” was the newly organized CCP Tungpei Army Work Committee of which Liu Lan-po was secretary, succeeded by Hsiang Nai-kuang later. 33\n\nThe Young Marshal was not unaware of the existence of the Society; important organizations of such secret nature would never have been tolerated in a provincial and personal army. Probably the Young Marshal did not care who were Communists or non-Communists. One thing was clear—they were all young men from Manchuria; their way of life was common, as was their fate. Instead of discouraging its growth, Chang saw that the Society fit into the general scheme which he was forming.\n\nBy the middle of March 1936 the Young Marshal was able to make direct contact with the CCP. According to his own account, shortly after the lifting of the siege of Kanchuan by the Red Army on March 10th, a clear indication of showing goodwill toward the Tungpei Army, the Red Army dispatched a representative to the headquarters of the 67th Army to express its genuine desire for cooperation with the Tungpei Army in the resistance against Japan. Wang I-che, in turn, cabled the Young Marshal requesting that he receive the representative himself. With little hesitation the Young Marshal flew to Lochuan to meet the Red Army representative, Li K!o-nung, a secret security chief of the CCP. 34 But Chang did not know Li nor especially his status in the CCP. Nevertheless, Li proposed some conditions on which the united front was to be based. In fact, his proposals were similar to those eventually advanced by the CCP. Because of his lack of confidence in Li, Chang said to him that “if the CCP has faith in the united front, it should send either Mao Tse-tung or Chou En-lai here.” To Chang's great surprise, shortly after Li's departure, word was sent from the CCP that Chou would come. The Young Marshal entrusted Chou Fu-ch'eng, commander of the 129th Division of the 53rd Army then stationed at Yenan, with the task of a cordial reception for Chou. 35\n\nOne night in late April or early May at a Catholic Church in Yenan, Chang and Chou met for two or three hours. Among many other things discussed in relation to the united front against Japan, the role of Chiang Kai-shek became the central issue. While both readily agreed that given the general situation, China could not achieve unification through Fascism, they differed greatly over Chiang Kai-shek. Hot debate ensued. At one point, Chou raised the issue of Hirota Koki's three principles to which Chang assured Chou that Chiang would never accede as a price for peace. The dilemma with which the CCP and Chou were confronted was that heretofore the CCP official position had not included Chiang in the united front. Moreover, not only had the CCP advocated a united front against Japan without Chiang, it had even insisted on “opposition to Chiang for the sake of a united front.” In its view, until Chiang's rule was overthrown, it would be impossible to form a united front. Conversely, Chang believed that it would be unthinkable that resistance against Japan could be brought about without Chiang whose leadership was absolutely necessary. To him, support for Chiang was prerequisite to resistance against Japan. Chang tried to convince Chou that Chiang was anti-Japanese and was making preparations for a war with Japan. 36 At last Chou recognized that Chiang was devoted to the country and willing to resist Japan; he also believed that in a war with Japan Chiang ought to assume the leadership. He pointed out that, as in the past, he and other Communists would be glad to serve Chiang again. However, Chou still did not trust the men surrounding Chiang. Indeed he argued that had the Central Government been determined to resist Japan, why would it still want to exterminate the Communists who were most hated by the Japanese for their enthusiastic resistance to them? Despite all misgivings the CCP was prepared to restore the old relationship with the Kuomintang and again to put itself under the leadership of Chiang, under the proclaimed “Platform of War of Resistance against Japan.” Then a nine-point agreement was reached:\n\n1. The Communist armed forces will receive inspection, reorganization, and concentration for training to prepare for resistance against Japan.\n\n2. It is guaranteed that the Communist army will never be deceived or disarmed.\n\n3. Communist forces in Kiangsi, Hainan, and Ta-pTieh Mountain will also receive inspection and reorganization.\n\n4. The title of the Red Army will be abolished, and it will receive the same treatment as the national armed forces.\n\n5. Communists are no longer allowed to work in the army.\n\n6. Communists will stop staging all kinds of tou-cheng (struggle).\n\n7. Communist prisoners, except those who are opposed to the government and attack the leader, will be released and given freedom of activity.\n\n8. Nonmilitary Communist members will be allowed to live in North Shensi.\n\n9. After war of resistance against Japan is victorious, the CCP will be allowed to become a legal political party like those in the democratic countries of England and the United States.37\n\nIn addition, Chou proposed that if the Young Marshal harbored any doubt about what Chou had said, he would be willing to put himself and others under his direct command and surveillance so that they could be reproachable at any time. Chang was greatly moved by the sincerity of Chou. As a matter of fact, Chou had spent his boyhood in Mukden and later attended school in Tientsin. Since he was only about two years older than Chang, their meeting must have been marked by soul-searching for ways to save the country, intermingled with the joy over reconciliation, nostalgia and mutual admiration for their youthful achievements. The meeting had a tremendous emotional impact on the Young Marshal. He was overwhelmed by Chou's personality and the sincerity of the CCP in the united front; he later described his feelings: “At that time I generously accepted his views and expressed the desire of vengeance against Japan not only for injuries to my family but for the national humiliation. I, therefore, will not lag behind others in fighting Japan. Yet/ I pointed out to him that I have my superior, and there are things which I am not in a position to decide; nonetheless, I will do my best to recommend their realization to Chiang. We also vowed that we should never break our promise to each other.”38\n\nFrom its knowledge of the Chang-Chou conference and their agreement, the CCP Politburo met to formulate a new policy. After a hot debate, the CCP recognized the necessity of “allying with Chiang” and “supporting Chiang.” Although there is no document available to account for this policy, change, the May 5, 1936 Declaration of the CCP clearly urged Chiang Kai-shek to stop the civil war and to lead the nation to resist Japan. It was primarily due to this policy change that Chiang acceded to preliminary negotiations with the CCP carried on by his close aide Ch'en Li-fu.39"
