        "text": "A poem by Mao Zedong, “Militia Women, Inscription on a Photograph—a jueju” (七绝·为女民兵题照 “Qijue: Wei nüminbing tizhao”) is to the present day the most frequently cited source to describe the Maoist ideal of femininity:\n\n飒爽英姿五尺枪曙光初照演兵场中华儿女多奇志不爱红装爱武装\n\nHow bright and brave they look, shouldering five-foot riflesOn the parade ground lit up by the first gleams of dayChina’s daughters have high-aspiring minds,They love their battle array, not silks and satins1 [End Page 153]\n\nThe concluding line of the poem in particular has become a trope for a new concept of female dress and behavior. Bu ai hongzhuang ai wuzhuang (不爱红装爱武装) literally translates as “They don’t love red garments, but military uniforms,” and the shift from hong (红), the color red that denotes feminine beauty with erotic connotations but also marital happiness, to wu (武), meaning both weaponry and militancy, marks a shift from conventional and sexualized notions of female beauty (“red garments”/“silks and satins”) toward a militant interpretation of femininity.2 The verse seemingly subsumes in one phrase what has been described as the “masculinization” or “defeminization” of the socialist woman through a discourse that linked femininity to feudalism and capitalism.3 The “androgyny of the Cultural Revolution,”4 when female (and male) Red Guards donned army uniforms, then appears to be the ultimate realization of this Maoist ideal.\n\nScholarship on women’s histories and gender in China has been revolving around the tension between the state-sponsored discourse of women’s liberation—encapsulated in the phrases “Women can uphold half of heaven” and “The times have changed, men and women are the same”—and the more than incomplete achievement of gender equality in the years between 1949 and 1976. Studies by Emily Honig, Tina Mai Chen, Suzy Kim, and others have served to demonstrate the complex uses of gendered representations, sartorial choices, and female agency.5 In discussions of the sartorial aspects of gender discourse, especially of the replacement of “silks and satins” with less heavily gendered garments, the question of how these are to be evaluated from a feminist point of view nonetheless takes center stage. Tina Mai Chen has succinctly phrased the dilemma: “When women wore [the People’s Liberation Army] uniform, did they extend the parameters of female fashion, undermine male dominance of the uniform, subject women to masculinization, or a combination of these?”6 [End Page 154]\n\nThe complex issues surrounding representations of socialist femininity have to date been tackled only insufficiently by scholars of art and visual culture; the same is true of propaganda art and photography in socialist China in general.7 Historians of gender or literature direct the focus of their inquiry toward the relation between the depicted ideal and social reality without taking into full account the complexities of visual representation. Several authors explicitly or implicitly assume that the numerous pictures of women working in previously male domains address a female audience and that they visualize models (模范 mofan) of socialist behavior to be emulated.8 They highlight either the normative and repressive functions of these images or their failure to represent either true gender equality or a society where this equality is not achieved.9 Images distributed through the state media of socialist China are thus treated as transparent mediators of explicit political norms and messages that shape their own reception by (female) audiences or that fail to do so. What remains to be fully assessed are the multilayered functions of visual representation, as well as the formal and artistic strategies employed in these pictures, including the straightforwardly propagandistic ones.\n\nThe formulation of a new ideal of socialist personhood and its propagation to the people is but one function assigned to images and texts created during the Maoist era. It is crucial to differentiate carefully between the various circumstances that governed the production, reproduction, textual framings, and reception of images. And although propaganda posters, artworks conforming to the ideological framework outlined by the Chinese Communist Party (CCP), and news photography were produced within the same discourse of socialist construction and were subject to the same tight ideological control, they were each assigned different functions that have to be taken into consideration. These different types of images have in common that they participate in the conventions of their respective genres and in established idioms to convey meaning or create new expressions. Moreover, they are contingent on the moments of their production and publication as well as on the subjectivities of their authors and the circumstances of their reception.\n\nThis article therefore proposes that photographs and other images from the Maoist period should not be measured against a state-sponsored political discourse, on the one hand, and social realities, on the other. Instead, these images have to be regarded as [End Page 155] performative and as actively shaping discourses, gendered behavior, and social norms.10 Artists, photographers, and editors relied on various pictorial strategies, an important one being the use of allegory. The questions of whether or not representations of women active in male-dominated domains testify to achievements or failures in gender equality and whether they reflect new or conventional gender norms address but one aspect targeted by these images, and arguably not always the most important one. Most of the images of militiawomen and hard-working “iron girls” should be read not as a documentation of social facts but as allegories of class and nation. For the persuasiveness of these allegories and their attractiveness to female as well as male audiences, the female gender and even sexual attractiveness of the depicted women is as quintessential as their class identity, as I will show below.\n\nMy article presents as a case study a brief history of one particular genre in the visual culture of socialist China, a genre that sparked Mao Zedong’s famous verse and thus seems to epitomize the new ideal of a militant woman: the images of militiawomen that proliferated in Chinese media between 1958 and 1976.11 Furthermore, I probe into the connection between these models of female militancy and the military apparel and militant behavior of female Red Guards during the Cultural Revolution, likewise often described with the phrase bu ai hongzhuang ai wuzhuang. The formation of the Red Guards in 1966 was, inter alia, an outcome of the militarization of Chinese society up to the mid-1960s, which was visually accompanied by an increasing number of militiawomen pictures.12 Therefore, I will, in a second line of inquiry, discuss images of Red Guards from 1966 and their figurations of an urban, adolescent female militancy.\n\nThe images under discussion here, mostly photographs, were published in Renmin huabao (人民画报 China Pictorial), a pictorial published in Chinese as well as multiple foreign languages that shaped the image that the People’s Republic of China (PRC) presented to the world; Zhongguo funü (中国妇女 Women of China), the journal of the All-China Women’s Federation, which addressed a female readership and promoted what Wang Zheng has described as state feminism;13 and Zhongguo sheying (中国摄影 Photography in China), the journal of the Chinese Photographer’s Association that was crucial in shaping the aesthetic and ideological standards of photography in socialist China. Although directed at different audiences, the three journals often published the same photographs. More importantly, they participated in the formation of a common visual language and aesthetic ideals in the representation of the socialist woman.\n\nThe medium of photography is particularly convincing in conveying social and gender norms as well as in serving allegorical purposes due to its presumed indexicality, [End Page 156] i.e., that as a semiotic sign, according to Charles S. Peirce, it refers to its signified via a physical connection.14 In Rosalind Krauss’s words, “Every photograph is the result of a physical imprint transferred by light reflections onto a sensitive surface. The photograph is thus a type of icon, or visual likeness, which bears an indexical relationship to its object.”15 The assumption that what a photograph shows was actually there at the moment of exposure—what Tom Gunning has called photography’s “truth claim”16—ties the allegorical image and the normative ideal to living persons. Like socialist realist paintings, photographs from the Maoist period show an ideal reality, promoting a society as it should be. The claim to visual truthfulness associated with photography presents this ideal as already realized. The tightly controlled arrangement of the photographs and their highly standardized iconography supersede the particularity of the individual and transform it into an idealized image of class and nation. As Matthias Weiß has noted with regard to portrait series from national socialist Germany, such photographs do not work in the mode of Roland Barthes’s “That-has-been”17 but instead propagate an unattainable “That-will-be.”18\n\nOn the other hand, the fact that these photographs depict actual living women can help to undermine the projection of an ideal socialist subject, to trace the constructions of such idealized images, and to better understand how political movements and everyday experiences were transformed into coherent visual representations of women and men embodying the norms of socialist society. Therefore, in this article, I not only analyze how the photographs of young militiawomen or Red Guards were put to allegorical use in the years between 1958 and 1976, in order to exemplify the workings of visual propaganda, but I also draw attention to the historical and personal contingencies behind those photographs and shed light on the personal histories, experiences, desires, and conflicts that were subsumed in the images of Maoist femininity."
