        "text": "Jacqueline Lee \"Jackie\" Kennedy Onassis (née Bouvier, July 28, 1929 – May 19, 1994) was an American socialite, writer, photographer, book editor and first lady of the United States from 1961 to 1963, as the wife of President John F. Kennedy. When her husband was inaugurated, she was the third-youngest first lady of the United States at age 31. During her time as the first lady of America, she endeared the American public with her fashion sense, devotion to her family, emphasis on arts and culture, and dedication to the historic preservation of the White House.\n\nAfter the assassination and funeral of her husband in 1963, Kennedy and her children largely withdrew from public view. In 1968, she married Greek shipping magnate Aristotle Onassis, which caused controversy. Following Onassis's death in 1975, she had a career as a book editor in New York City. She died in 1994 and was buried at Arlington National Cemetery alongside President Kennedy.\n\nDuring her lifetime, she was regarded as an international fashion icon. Even after her death, she ranks as one of the most popular and recognizable first ladies in American history, and in 1999, she was listed as one of Gallup's Most-Admired Men and Women of the 20th century. ​\n\nJacqueline and her husband John Fitzgerald Kennedy, with their children John Kennedy, Jr and Caroline Bouvier Kennedy, 4 August 1962\n\nBiography\n\nJacqueline Bouvier, 1935\n\nJacqueline Lee Bouvier was born on July 28, 1929, at Southampton Hospital in Southampton, New York, to Wall Street stockbroker John Vernou \"Black Jack\" Bouvier III and socialite Janet Norton Lee. Her mother was of Irish descent, and her father had French, Scottish, and English ancestry. Named after her father, she was baptized at the Church of St. Ignatius Loyola in Manhattan and raised in the Catholic faith. A sister, Caroline Lee, was born four years later on March 3, 1933.\n\nJacqueline Bouvier spent her early childhood years in Manhattan and at Lasata, the Bouviers' country estate in East Hampton on Long Island. She looked up to her father, who likewise favored her over her sister, calling his elder child \"the most beautiful daughter a man ever had\". From an early age, Jacqueline was an enthusiastic equestrienne who successfully competed in the sport and horse-riding remained a lifelong passion for her. She took ballet lessons, was an avid reader, and excelled at learning languages, speaking English, French, Spanish, and Italian. French was particularly emphasized in her upbringing.\n\nIn 1935, Jacqueline Bouvier was enrolled in Manhattan's Chapin School, which she attended for Grades 1–7. She was a bright student but often misbehaved; one of her teachers described her as \"a darling child, the prettiest little girl, very clever, very artistic, and full of the devil\". Her behavior improved after the headmistress warned her that none of her positive qualities would matter if she did not behave.\n\nThe marriage of the Bouviers was strained by her father's alcoholism and extramarital affairs; the family had also struggled with financial difficulties following the Wall Street Crash of 1929. They separated in 1936 and divorced four years later, with the press publishing intimate details of the split. According to her cousin John H. Davis, Jacqueline was deeply affected by the divorce and subsequently had a \"tendency to withdraw frequently into a private world of her own.\"\n\nWhen their mother married Standard Oil heir Hugh Dudley Auchincloss, Jr. , the Bouvier sisters did not attend the ceremony, because it was arranged quickly and travel was restricted due to World War II.\n\nThe Bouvier sisters gained three stepsiblings from Auchincloss's previous marriages, Hugh \"Yusha\" Auchincloss III, Thomas Gore Auchincloss, and Nina Gore Auchincloss; she formed the closest bond with Yusha, who became one of her most trusted confidants of her. The marriage later produced two more children, Janet Jennings Auchincloss in 1945 and James Lee Auchincloss in 1947.\n\nAfter the remarriage, Auchincloss's Merrywood estate in McLean, Virginia, became the Bouvier sisters' primary residence, although they also spent time at his other estate, Hammersmith Farm in Newport, Rhode Island, and in their father's homes in New York City and Long Island\n\nAlthough she retained a relationship with her father, Jacqueline Bouvier also regarded her stepfather as a close paternal figure. He gave her a stable environment and the pampered childhood she never would have experienced otherwise. While she adjusted to her mother's remarriage, she sometimes felt like an outsider in the WASP social circle of the Auchinclosses, attributing the feeling to her being Catholic as well as being a child of divorce, which was not common in that social group at that time .\n\nAfter seven years at Chapin, Jacqueline Bouvier attended the Holton-Arms School in Northwest Washington, D.C. from 1942 to 1944, and Miss Porter's School in Farmington, Connecticut, from 1944 to 1947. She chose Miss Porter's because it was a boarding school that allowed her to distance herself from the Auchinclosses, and because the school placed an emphasis on college preparatory classes. In her senior class yearbook, Bouvier was acknowledged for \"her wit, her accomplishment as a horsewoman, and her unwillingness to become a housewife.\" She later hired her childhood friend Nancy Tuckerman to be her social secretary at the White House.\n\nJacqueline Bouvier graduated among the top students of her class and received the Maria McKinney Memorial Award for Excellence in Literature.\n\nIn the summer of 1947, Jacqueline Bouvier made her debut to high society and became a frequent presence in New York social functions. Hearst columnist Igor Cassini (brother of Oleg Cassini, who would become her official designer decades later) dubbed her the \"debutante of the year\".\n\nIn the fall, Jacqueline Bouvier entered Vassar College in Poughkeepsie, New York, at that time a women's institution. She had wanted to attend Sarah Lawrence College, closer to New York City, but her parents insisted that she choose the more isolated Vassar.\n\nShe was an accomplished student who participated in the school's art and drama clubs and wrote for its newspaper. Due to her dislike of Vassar's location in Poughkeepsie, she did not take an active part in her social life and instead traveled back to Manhattan for the weekends.\n\nShe spent her junior year (1949–1950) in France—at the University of Grenoble in Grenoble, and at the Sorbonne in Paris—in a study-abroad program through Smith College. Upon returning home, she transferred to George Washington University in Washington, D.C., graduating with a Bachelor of Arts degree in French literature in 1951.\n\nWhile attending George Washington, Jacqueline Bouvier won a twelve-month junior editorship at Vogue magazine; she had been selected over several hundred other women nationwide. The position entailed working for six months in the magazine's New York City office and spending the remaining six months in Paris.\n\nBefore beginning the job, she celebrated her college graduation and her sister Lee's high school graduation by traveling with her to Europe for the summer. The trip was the subject of her only autobiography, One Special Summer, co-authored with Lee; it is also the only one of her published works to feature Jacqueline Bouvier's drawings.\n\nOn her first day at Vogue, the managing editor advised her to quit and go back to Washington. According to biographer Barbara Leaming, the editor was concerned about her marriage prospects; she was 22 years of age and was considered too old to be single in her social circles. She followed the advice, left the job and returned to Washington after only one day of work.\n\nJacqueline Bouvier moved back to Merrywood and was referred by a family friend to the Washington Times-Herald, where editor Frank Waldrop hired her as a part-time receptionist. A week later she requested more challenging work, and Waldrop sent her to city editor Sidney Epstein, who hired her as an \"Inquiring Camera Girl\" despite her inexperience, paying her $25 a week. He recalled, \"I remember her as this very attractive, cute-as-hell girl, and all the guys in the newsroom giving her a good look.\" The position required her to pose witty questions to individuals chosen at random on the street and take their pictures for publication in the newspaper alongside selected quotations from their responses. In addition to the random \"man on the street\" vignettes, she sometimes sought interviews with people of interest.\n\nDuring this time, Jacqueline Bouvier was briefly engaged to a young stockbroker named John Husted. After only a month of dating, the couple published the announcement in The New York Times in January 1952. After three months, she called off the engagement because she had found him \"immature and boring\" once she got to know him better.\n\nJacqueline Bouvier and U.S. Representative John F. Kennedy belonged to the same social circle and were formally introduced by a mutual friend, journalist Charles L. Bartlett, at a dinner party in May 1952. She was attracted to Kennedy's physical appearance, wit and wealth. The pair also shared the similarities of Catholicism, writing, enjoying reading and having previously lived abroad. Kennedy was busy running for the U.S. Senate seat in Massachusetts; the relationship grew more serious and he proposed to her after the November election. Bouvier took some time to accept, because she had been assigned to cover the coronation of Queen Elizabeth II in London for The Washington Times-Herald.\n\nAfter a month in Europe, she returned to the United States and accepted Kennedy's marriage proposal. She then resigned from her position at the newspaper. Their engagement was officially announced on June 25, 1953.\n\nJacqueline Kennedy with her husband John Fitzgerald Kennedy\n\nJacqueline Kennedy with her husband John Fitzgerald Kennedy\n\nJacqueline Kennedy with her husband John Fitzgerald Kennedy\n\nJacqueline Bouvier and John F. Kennedy married on September 12, 1953, at St. Mary's Church in Newport, Rhode Island, in a mass celebrated by Boston's Archbishop Richard Cushing. The wedding was considered the social event of the season with an estimated 700 guests at the ceremony and 1,200 at the reception that followed at Hammersmith Farm. The wedding dress was designed by Ann Lowe of New York City, and is now housed in the Kennedy Library in Boston, Massachusetts. The dresses of her attendants were also created by Lowe, who was not credited by Jacqueline Kennedy.\n\nJacqueline Kennedy with her husband John Fitzgerald Kennedy on their wedding day, 1953\n\nJacqueline Kennedy with her husband John Fitzgerald Kennedy on their wedding day, 1953\n\nJacqueline Kennedy with her husband John Fitzgerald Kennedy on their wedding day, 1953\n\nThe newlyweds honeymooned in Acapulco, Mexico, before settling in their new home, Hickory Hill in McLean, Virginia, a suburb of Washington, D.C. Kennedy developed a warm relationship with her parents-in-law, Joseph and Rose Kennedy.\n\nDuring the early years of her marriage to John F. Kennedy, Jacqueline Kennedy took continuing education classes in American history at Georgetown University in Washington, D.C.\n\nDuring the same period, the couple faced several personal setbacks. John Kennedy suffered from Addison's disease and from chronic and at times debilitating back pain, which had been exacerbated by a war injury; in late 1954, he underwent a near-fatal spinal operation. Additionally, Jacqueline Kennedy suffered a miscarriage in 1955 and in August 1956 she gave birth to a stillborn daughter, Arabella. They subsequently sold their Hickory Hill estate to Kennedy's brother Robert, who occupied it with his wife Ethel and their growing family, and bought a townhouse on N Street in Georgetown. The Kennedys also resided at an apartment at 122 Bowdoin Street in Boston, their permanent Massachusetts residence during his congressional career.\n\nKennedy gave birth to daughter Caroline on November 27, 1957. At the time, she and her husband were campaigning for his re-election to the Senate, and they posed with their infant daughter for the cover of the April 21, 1958 issue of Life magazine. They traveled together during the campaign and soon enough, John Kennedy started to notice the value that his wife added to his congressional campaign. In November 1958, John was reelected to a second term. He credited Jacqueline's visibility of her in both ads and stumping of her as vital assets in securing his victory, and he called her \"simply invaluable\".\n\nIn 1959, John Kennedy traveled to 14 states, with Jacqueline taking long breaks from the trips so she could spend time with her daughter, Caroline. She also counseled her husband on improving his wardrobe in preparation for his intended presidential campaign the following year.\n\nOn January 3, 1960, John F. Kennedy was a United States senator from Massachusetts when he announced his candidacy for the presidency and launched his campaign nationwide. Shortly after the campaign began, she became pregnant. Due to her previous high-risk pregnancies, she decided to stay at home in Georgetown. Jacqueline Kennedy subsequently participated in the campaign by writing a weekly syndicated newspaper column, Campaign Wife, answering correspondence, and giving interviews to the media.\n\nDespite her non-participation in the campaign, Kennedy became the subject of intense media attention with her fashion choices. On one hand, she was admired for her personal style; she was frequently featured in women's magazines alongside film stars and named as one of the 12 best-dressed women in the world. On the other hand, her preference for French designers and her spending on her wardrobe brought her negative press. In order to downplay her wealthy background, Kennedy stressed the amount of work she was doing for the campaign and declined to publicly discuss her clothing choices.\n\nOn July 13 at the 1960 Democratic National Convention in Los Angeles, the party nominated John F. Kennedy for president.\n\nOn November 8, 1960, John F. Kennedy narrowly defeated Republican opponent Richard Nixon in the U.S. presidential election. A little over two weeks later on November 25, Jacqueline Kennedy gave birth to the couple's first son, John F. Kennedy, Jr. She spent two weeks recuperating in the hospital, during which the most minute details of both her and her son's conditions were reported by the media in what has been considered the first instance of national interest in the Kennedy family.\n\nJacqueline Kennedy's husband was sworn in as president on January 20, 1961. She insisted they also kept a family home away from the public eye and rented Glen Ora at Middleburg. The discussion about Kennedy's fashion choices continued during her years in the White House, and she became a trendsetter, hiring American designer Oleg Cassini to design her wardrobe. She was the first presidential wife to hire a press secretary, Pamela Turnure, and carefully managed her contact with the media, usually shying away from making public statements, and strictly controlling the extent to which her children were photographed.\n\nAlthough Kennedy stated that her priority as a first lady was to take care of the President and their children, she also dedicated her time to the promotion of American arts and preservation of its history. The restoration of the White House was her main contribution, but she also furthered the cause by hosting social events that brought together elite figures from politics and the arts.\n\nKennedy had visited the White House on two occasions before she became first lady: the first time as a grade-school tourist in 1941 and again as the guest of outgoing First Lady Mamie Eisenhower shortly before her husband's inauguration. She was dismayed to find that the mansion's rooms were furnished with undistinguished pieces that displayed little historical significance and made it her first major project as first lady to restore its historical character. On her first day in residence, she began her efforts with the help of interior decorator Sister Parish. Continuing the project, she established a fine arts committee to oversee and fund the restoration process and solicited the advice of early American furniture expert Henry du Pont. To solve the funding problem, a White House guidebook was published, sales of which were used for the restoration. Working with Rachel Lambert Mellon, Jacqueline Kennedy also oversaw the redesign and replanting of the Rose Garden and the East Garden, which was renamed the Jacqueline Kennedy Garden of her after her husband's assassination. In addition, Kennedy helped to stop the destruction of historic homes in Lafayette Square in Washington, D.C., because she felt these buildings were an important part of the nation's capital and played an essential role in its history.\n\nJacqueline Kennedy with her husband John Fitzgerald Kennedy on the Inauguration day\n\nJacqueline Kennedy with her husband John Fitzgerald Kennedy\n\nOn February 14, 1962, Jacqueline Kennedy, accompanied by Charles Collingwood of CBS News, took American television viewers on a tour of the White House. On the tour, she stated that \"I feel so strongly that the White House should have as fine a collection of American pictures as possible. It's so important... the setting in which the presidency is presented to the world, to foreign visitors. The American people should be proud of it. We have such a great civilization. So many foreigners don't realize it. I think this house should be the place we see them best.\" The film was watched by 56 million television viewers in the United States, and was later distributed to 106 countries. Kennedy won a special Academy of Television Arts & Sciences Trustees Award for it at the Emmy Awards in 1962, which was accepted on her behalf by Lady Bird Johnson. Kennedy was the only first lady to win an Emmy.\n\nThroughout her husband's presidency and more than any of the preceding first ladies, Jacqueline Kennedy made many official visits to other countries, on her own or with the President. On the Kennedys' first official visit to France in 1961, she impressed the public with her ability to speak French, as well as her extensive knowledge of French history.\n\nIn 1962, Kennedy undertook a tour of India and Pakistan with her sister Lee Radziwill. The tour was amply documented in photojournalism. In addition to these well-publicized trips during the three years of the Kennedy administration, she traveled to countries including Afghanistan, Austria, Canada, Colombia, United Kingdom, Greece, Italy, Mexico, Morocco, Turkey, and Venezuela.\n\nThat year, she was named Woman of the Year for her efforts in uplifting the American history and art by Time Magazine.\n\nJacqueline and her husband John Fitzgerald Kennedy, with their children John Kennedy, Jr and Caroline Bouvier Kennedy\n\nJacqueline with her children John Kennedy, Jr and Caroline Bouvier Kennedy\n\nJacqueline Kennedy became a global fashion icon during her husband's presidency. After the 1960 election, she commissioned French-born American fashion designer and Kennedy family friend Oleg Cassini to create an original wardrobe for her appearances as First Lady. From 1961 to 1963, Cassini dressed her in many of her most iconic ensembles, including her Inauguration Day fawn coat and Inaugural gala gown, as well as many outfits for her visits to Europe, India, and Pakistan. In 1961, Kennedy spent $45,446 more on fashion than the $100,000 annual salary her husband earned as president.\n\nKennedy preferred French couture, particularly the work of Coco Chanel, Cristobal Balenciaga, and Hubert de Givenchy, but was aware that in her role as first lady, she would be expected to wear American designers' work. After noticing that her taste for Paris fashion was being criticized in the press, she wrote to the fashion editor Diana Vreeland to ask for suitable American designers, particularly those who could reproduce the Paris look. After considering the letter, which expressed her dislike of prints and her preference for \"terribly simple, covered-up clothes,\" Vreeland recommended Norman Norell, who was considered America's first designer and known for his high-end simplicity and fine quality work. She also suggested Ben Zuckerman, another highly regarded tailor who regularly offered re-interpretations of Paris couture, and the sportswear designer Stella Sloat, who occasionally offered Givenchy copies. Kennedy's first choice for her Inauguration Day coat was originally a purple wool Zuckerman model that was based on a Pierre Cardin design, but she instead settled on a fawn Cassini coat and wore the Zuckerman for a tour of the White House with Mamie Eisenhower.\n\nIn her role as first lady, Kennedy preferred to wear clean-cut suits with a skirt hem down to middle of the knee, three-quarter sleeves on notch-collar jackets, sleeveless A-line dresses, above-the-elbow gloves, low-heel pumps, and pillbox hats. Dubbed the \"Jackie\" look, these clothing items rapidly became fashion trends in the Western world. More than any other First Lady, her style was copied by commercial manufacturers and a large segment of young women. She would be named to the International Best Dressed List Hall of Fame in 1965.\n\nHer influential bouffant hairstyle, described as a \"grown-up exaggeration of little girls' hair,\" was created by Mr. Kenneth, who worked for her from 1954 until 1986.\n\nJacqueline Kennedy with her husband John Fitzgerald Kennedy\n\nJacqueline Kennedy with her husband John Fitzgerald Kennedy\n\nJacqueline Kennedy with her husband John Fitzgerald Kennedy\n\nJacqueline Kennedy with her husband John Fitzgerald Kennedy\n\nIn early 1963, Kennedy was again pregnant, which led her to curtail her official duties. On August 7, she went into labor and gave birth to a boy, Patrick Bouvier Kennedy, via emergency Caesarean section, but the baby died of hyaline membrane disease two days after birth.\n\nJacqueline Kennedy was deeply affected by Patrick's death and proceeded to enter a state of depression. However, the loss of their child had a positive impact on the marriage and brought the couple closer together in their shared grief.\n\nJacqueline Kennedy's friend Aristotle Onassis was aware of her depression and invited her to his yacht to recuperate. President Kennedy initially had reservations, but he relented because he believed that it would be \"good for her.\" The trip was widely disapproved of within the Kennedy administration, by much of the general public, and in Congress. The First Lady returned to the United States on October 17, 1963. She would later say she regretted being away as long as she was but she had been \"melancholy after the death of my baby\".\n\nOn November 21, 1963, the First Lady and the President embarked on a political trip to Texas with several goals in mind; this was the first time that she had joined her husband on such a trip in the U.S. After a breakfast on November 22, they took a very short flight on Air Force One from Fort Worth's Carswell Air Force Base to Dallas's Love Field, accompanied by Texas Governor John Connally and his wife Nellie. The First Lady was wearing a bright pink Chanel suit and a pillbox hat, which had been personally selected by President Kennedy.\n\nDuring the motorcade ride, John F. Kennedy was shot and taken to hospital, where he died not long after, aged 46.\n\nAfter her husband was pronounced dead, Kennedy refused to remove her blood-stained clothing and continued to wear it as she boarded Air Force One and stood next to Johnson when he took the oath of office as president. The unlaundered suit became a symbol of her husband's assassination, and was donated to the National Archives and Records Administration in 1964. Under the terms of an agreement with her daughter, Caroline, the suit will not be placed on public display before 2103.\n\nJacqueline Kennedy on the day of her husband John Fitzgerald Kennedy's funeral, Kennedy, with her children John Kennedy, Jr and Caroline Bouvier Kennedy, 25 November 1963\n\nJacqueline Kennedy on the day of her husband John Fitzgerald Kennedy's funeral, Kennedy, with her children John Kennedy, Jr and Caroline Bouvier Kennedy, 25 November 1963\n\nJacqueline Kennedy on the day of her husband John Fitzgerald Kennedy's funeral, Kennedy, with her children John Kennedy, Jr and Caroline Bouvier Kennedy, 25 November 1963\n\nJacqueline with her children John Kennedy, Jr and Caroline Bouvier Kennedy\n\nKennedy spent 1964 in mourning and made few public appearances. She purchased a house for herself and her children in Georgetown but sold it later in 1964 and bought a 15th-floor penthouse apartment for $250,000 at 1040 Fifth Avenue in Manhattan in the hopes of having more privacy.\n\nAfter her husband's assassination, Jacqueline Kennedy relied heavily on her brother-in-law Robert F. Kennedy; He had been a source of support for her after she had suffered a miscarriage early in her marriage for her; it was he, not her husband de ella, who stayed with her in the hospital. In the aftermath of the assassination, Robert became a surrogate father for her children for her until eventual demands by his own large family and his responsibilities for him as attorney general required him to reduce attention.\n\nIn January 1968 Robert Kennedy's advisors urged him to enter the upcoming presidential race. Jacqueline Kennedy was against the idea at first but then encouraged her brother-in-law and even wish he would win.\n\nJust after midnight PDT on June 5, 1968, an enraged Palestinian gunman mortally wounded Robert Kennedy minutes after he and a crowd of his supporters had been celebrating his victory in the California Democratic presidential primary. Jacqueline Kennedy rushed to Los Angeles to join his wife Ethel, her brother-in-law Ted, and the other Kennedy family members at his hospital bedside. Robert Kennedy never regained consciousness and died the following day. He was 42 years old.\n\nAfter Robert Kennedy's death in 1968, Jacqueline Kennedy came to fear for her life and those of her two children, saying: \"If they're killing Kennedys, then my children are targets ... I want to get out of this country\".\n\nJacqueline Kennedy Onassis with her husband Aristotle Onassis on their wedding day, 20 October 1968\n\nJacqueline Kennedy Onassis with her husband Aristotle Onassis on their wedding day, 20 October 1968\n\nOn October 20, 1968, Jacqueline Kennedy married her long-time friend Aristotle Onassis, a wealthy Greek shipping magnate who was able to provide the privacy and security she sought for herself and her children. The wedding took place on Skorpios, Onassis's private Greek island in the Ionian Sea. After marrying Onassis, she took the legal name Jacqueline Onassis and consequently lost her right to Secret Service protection, which is an entitlement of a widow of a U.S. president. The marriage brought her considerable adverse publicity. She was condemned by some as a \"public sinner\", and became the target of paparazzi who followed her everywhere and nicknamed her \"Jackie O\".\n\nDuring their marriage, Jacqueline and Aristotle Onassis inhabited six different residences: her 15-room Fifth Avenue apartment in Manhattan, her horse farm in Peapack-Gladstone, New Jersey, his Avenue Foch apartment in Paris, his private island Skorpios, his house in Athens, and his yacht Christina O.\n\nJacqueline Kennedy Onasis's style changed dramatically since then. Her new looks consisted of wide-leg pantsuits, silk Hermès headscarves, and large, round, dark sunglasses. She even began wearing jeans in public. She set a new fashion trend with beltless white jeans with a black turtleneck that was never tucked in and instead pulled down over her hips.\n\nJacqueline Kennedy Onassis with her husband Aristotle Onassis\n\nJacqueline Kennedy Onassis with her husband Aristotle Onassis\n\nJacqueline Kennedy Onassis with her husband Aristotle Onassis\n\nJacqueline Kennedy Onassis with her husband Aristotle Onassis\n\nJacqueline Kennedy Onassis with her husband Aristotle Onassis\n\nAristotle Onassis's health deteriorated rapidly following the death of his son Alexander in a plane crash in 1973. He died of respiratory failure at age 69 in Paris on March 15, 1975. His financial legacy was severely limited under Greek law, which dictated how much a non-Greek surviving spouse could inherit. After two years of legal wrangling, Jacqueline Onassis eventually accepted a settlement of $26 million from Christina Onassis—Aristotle's daughter and sole heir—and waived all other claims to the Onassis estate.\n\n​After the death of her second husband, Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis returned permanently to the United States, splitting her time between Manhattan, Martha's Vineyard, and the Kennedy compound in Hyannis Port, Massachusetts.\n\nIn 1975, she became a consulting editor at Viking Press, a position that she held for two years. She resigned from Viking Press in 1977.\n\nDuring her marriage to Aristotle Onassis, Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis as well as her children continued a connection with the Kennedy family. She developed a close relationship with Ted who visited them often, and later he was involved in her public appearances.\n\nIn 1979, she appeared alongside her mother-in-law Rose Kennedy at Faneuil Hall in Boston when Ted Kennedy announced his decision of running for president. She also participated in the subsequent presidential campaign, which was unsuccessful.\n\nFollowing her resignation from Viking Press, Onassis was hired by Doubleday, where she worked as an associate editor under an old friend, John Turner Sargent, Sr. Among the books she edited for the company are Larry Gonick's The Cartoon History of the Universe, the English translation of the three volumes of Naghib Mahfuz's Cairo Trilogy and autobiographies of ballerina Gelsey Kirkland, singer-songwriter Carly Simon, and fashion icon Diana Vreeland. She also encouraged Dorothy West, her neighbor on Martha's Vineyard and the last surviving member of the Harlem Renaissance, to complete the novel The Wedding (1995), a multi-generational story about race, class, wealth, and power in the U.S.\n\nIn addition to her work as an editor, Onassis participated in cultural and architectural preservation. In the 1970s, she led a historic preservation campaign to save Grand Central Terminal from demolition and renovate the structure in Manhattan. A plaque inside the terminal acknowledges her prominent role in its preservation. In the 1980s, she was a major figure in protests against a planned skyscraper at Columbus Circle that would have cast large shadows on Central Park; the project was cancelled. Her notable historic preservation efforts also include her influence in the campaign to save Olana, the home of Frederic Edwin Church in upstate New York.\n\nOnassis remained the subject of considerable press attention, especially from the paparazzi photographer Ron Galella, who followed her around and photographed her as she went about her normal activities; he took candid photos of her without her permission. She ultimately obtained a restraining order against him, and the situation brought attention to the problem of paparazzi photography.\n\nIn the early 1990s, Onassis supported Bill Clinton and contributed money to his presidential campaign.\n\nJacqueline Kennedy with her son John Kennedy Jr., 1991\n\nFrom 1980 until her death, Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis maintained a close relationship with Maurice Tempelsman, a Belgian-born industrialist and diamond merchant who was her companion and personal financial adviser.\n\n​In November 1993, Onassis was thrown from her horse while participating in a fox hunt in Middleburg, Virginia, and was taken to the hospital to be examined. A swollen lymph node was discovered in her groin, which was initially diagnosed by the doctor to be caused by an infection. The fall from the horse contributed to her deteriorating health over the next six months. In December, Onassis developed new symptoms, including a stomach ache and swollen lymph nodes in her neck, and was diagnosed with non-Hodgkin lymphoma, a blood cancer.\n\nShe began chemotherapy in January 1994 and publicly announced the diagnosis, stating that the initial prognosis was good. She continued to work at Doubleday, but by March the cancer had spread to her spinal cord and brain, and by May to her liver and was deemed terminal. Onassis made her last trip home from New York Hospital–Cornell Medical Center on May 18, 1994. The following night at 10:15 p.m., she died in her sleep in her Manhattan apartment at age 64, with her children by her side.\n\nIn the morning, her son John F. Kennedy, Jr. announced his mother's death to the press, stating that she had been \"surrounded by her friends and her family and her books, and the people and the things that she loved\". He added that \"She did it in her very own way, and on her own terms, and we all feel lucky for that.\"\n\nJacqueline Kennedy's son John F. Kennedy, Jr. and daughter Caroline Kennedy on her funeral.\n\nOn May 23, 1994, her funeral Mass was held a few blocks away from her apartment at the Church of St. Ignatius Loyola, the Catholic parish where she was baptized in 1929. She was interred at Arlington National Cemetery in Arlington, Virginia, alongside President Kennedy, their son Patrick, and their stillborn daughter Arabella. President Bill Clinton delivered a eulogy at her graveside service.\n\nJacqueline Kennedy with her husband John Fitzgerald Kennedy, wearing a pearl necklace\n\nJacqueline Kennedy Onassis left an estate that its executors valued at $43.7 million including a large collection of jewelry she acquired throughout her lifetime. Her triple-strand pearl necklace, designed by American jeweler Kenneth Jay Lane, became her signature piece of jewelry during her time as first lady in the White House. Often referred to as the \"berry brooch,\" the two-fruit cluster brooch of strawberries made of rubies with stems and leaves of diamonds, designed by French jeweler Jean Schlumberger for Tiffany & Co., was personally selected and given to her by her husband several days prior to his inauguration in January 1961. She wore Schlumberger's gold and enamel bracelets so frequently in the early and mid-1960s that the press called them \"Jackie bracelets\"; she also favored his white enamel and gold \"banana\" earrings. Kennedy wore jewelry designed by Van Cleef & Arpels throughout the 1950s, 1960s and 1970s; her sentimental favorite was the Van Cleef & Arpels wedding ring given to her by President Kennedy.\n\nMany of her signature clothes are preserved at the John F. Kennedy Library and Museum; pieces from the collection were exhibited at the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York in 2001. Titled \"Jacqueline Kennedy: The White House Years,\" the exhibition focused on her time as a first lady."
