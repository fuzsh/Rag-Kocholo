        "text": "By Scott Ross\n\nAs ever, click on the highlighted text for links and fuller reviews.\n\nI Want to Live! (1958) As an Orson Welles partisan it’s almost impossible for me to enjoy a movie directed by Robert Wise. Welles believed that the one-time editor of Citizen Kane, in exchange for the opportunity to direct, eagerly butchered The Magnificent Ambersons for the management of RKO while its maker was in South America, and whether this is true or the justifiable paranoia of a man whose masterpiece was destroyed while he was unable to defend it is almost beside the point. In addition to his editorial malfeasance, Wise directed some of the terrible scenes in Ambersons re-shot by studio diktat, and he did become a director, eventually winning two Academy Awards (for the emotionally manipulative The Sound of Music and the appalling West Side Story). I admit to liking parts of some of his pictures: The Set-Up (largely for Robert Ryan’s superb performance), Executive Suite (sweaty capitalist melodrama somewhat redeemed by its cast, especially Nina Foch), Somebody Up There Likes Me (for Paul Newman), Run Silent Run Deep (for Gable and Lancaster), Odds Against Tomorrow (nowhere near as good as its source novel but watchable for Ryan and Harry Belafonte, and the picture’s ironic ending), The Haunting (not a patch on Shirley Jackson’s book but it is hard to forget that breathing door) and Star! (cynical and wildly overblown but fascinating, for all the wrong reasons). His two Val Lewton pictures (The Curse of the Cat People and The Body Snatcher) are memorable as much for what Lewton, their producer, brought to them as for anything Wise did. But there is absolutely no excuse for how badly Wise and Robert Anderson distorted and cheapened Richard McKenna’s wonderful novel The Sand Pebbles.\n\nMy distaste is not entirely centered around the matter of Wise v. Welles, however. Generally I find Wise the worst sort of obvious filmmaker, prone to symbols and to Expressionist camera angles, not for reasons of organic composition but merely to be smart, drawing attention to his cinematic “invention.” With I Want to Live! — note the gratuitous exclamation point — Wise was abetted in his emotional manipulation by the imprimatur of The Truth. Based by the screenwriters Nelson Gidding and Don Mankiewicz on newspaper pieces by Edward Montgomery concerning the guilt or innocence of the condemned Barbara Graham, and on Graham’s letters, the movie paints its subject as a smart-ass good-time girl railroaded by The System. (The reality may have been less sanguine, although Graham maintained that her confession was coerced.) Susan Hayward gives one of those performances, half-banal, half-inspired, that kept getting her Academy Award nominations and, finally, this time, won her the prize. What’s best about the picture are Lionel Lindon’s superb black and white photography, William Hornbeck’s intelligent editing, and the trend-setting score by Johnny Mandel. Other soundtracks of the period, including several splendid ones by Elmer Bernstein and Alex North, were jazz-oriented. But like Bernstein’s Sweet Smell of Success the year before (and Duke Ellington’s Anatomy of a Murder the year after) Mandel’s was jazz, performed by a remarkable aggregation that included Gerry Mulligan, Art Farmer, Bud Shank, Shelley Manne, Milt Bernhardt, Pete Jolly, Jack Sheldon and Red Mitchell.\n\nOne thing Wise did get absolutely right: The depiction of Graham’s gas-chamber execution, whose starkness emphasizes the calculated nature of capital punishment as it is carried out in this country; the gawking spectators, eager to catch the condemned’s last breath, are more cold-blooded than Barbara Graham ever was.\n\nThe Wizard of Oz (1939) The generations born and raised after 1990 will find it hard to credit how, from 1959 to 1991, this already well-loved musical fantasy became an institution, its annual network television airing (usually at Easter) an event looked forward to and savored by children, even those (like me) whose families did not own a color teevee and who didn’t discover until they were in their 20s that the Horse of a Different Color was just that. Once Ted Turner got his mitts on the picture you had to have a cable subscription to see it; now, of course, it’s shown only on TCM, which, considered a thing only the old are interested in, I suspect few young people ever watch without coercion.\n\nI may not be exactly happy to have reached my sixth decade but I wouldn’t trade the yearly excitement of tuning in to this imperishable product of the studio age for a few years chipped off my biography. Who, knowing their glories, would want to miss Harold Arlen’s felicitous melodies, “Yip” Harburg’s delicious lyrics, flying monkeys, dozens of midgets, a cranky apple tree who speaks in the voice of Candy Candido, Herbert Stothart’s background score with its instantly memorable theme for Miss Gulch on her bicycle and its menacing Winkie chorus, Judy Garland’s endearing performance as Dorothy (and her marvelous singing voice), Margaret Hamilton’s as The Wicked Witch of the West, Frank Morgan’s as The Wizard, Jack Haley’s as the Tin Man or Ray Bolger’s as the Scarecrow? Or, supremely, the great Bert Lahr as the Cowardly Lion, especially when, singing “If I Were King of the Forest” like a mad Met tenor with enlarged adenoids, he belts the immortal phrase, “Monarch of all I survey/Mah-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-haah-nuck!” It always slays me.\n\nThe Dybbuk [דער דיבוק] 1937 A beautiful Polish adaptation (direction by Michał Waszyński, screenplay by S. A. Kacyzna) of S. Ansky’s Yiddish folk play, exquisitely filmed by Albert Wywerka and with an effective musical score by Henryk Kon. The splendid cast includes, in the leading roles, Abraham Morewski, Ajzyk Samberg, Mojżesz Lipman, Lili Liliana and the superb Leon Liebgold as the thwarted lover whose imprecations have such disastrous results. One of the few major European Yiddish productions, The Dybbuk was made near the end of a decade that would see Poland subsumed by Nazi Germany and, presumably, most of its cast and creators destroyed in the Shoah.\n\nThe excellent restoration is part of the Kino Blu-ray collection Jewish Soul: Classics of Yiddish Cinema.\n\nThe Love God? (1969) This frequently riotous Nat Hiken-written and directed take on 1960s sexual mores was the first adult Don Knotts comedy, and died a miserable death on its release in 1969. It was also traduced by the critics, who either didn’t seem to comprehend that it was a satire or if they did, like Judith Crist, considered it “smutty.” If you’re open to it, there’s something just inherently funny about Don Knotts as a mousy bird magazine publisher being turned into a Hugh Hefner prototype by an unscrupulous flesh-peddler (Edmond O’Brien), an ambitious editor (Anne Francis) and a pretentious gangster (B.S. Pully) with a penchant for punching everyone, women included, who disagrees with him. Along the way there are funny bits by James Gregory as a crusading lawyer, Maureen Arthur as a nudie magazine model, Jesslyn Fax as a retired schoolteacher, Marjorie Bennett as an ancient small-town secretary who can’t wait to cut loose in New York, Herb Voland as the Attorney General and Ruth McDevitt as an outraged old bat. If Maggie Peterson, who plays Knotts’ virginal beloved, looks a little like a pretty horse surprised by a grass bouquet, Knotts himself is in fine fettle, especially when sporting his new “mod” wardrobe or, riotously, twice performing his medley of bird calls, the second time with a mouth gone dry from terror. The score is, as usual for a Knotts comedy, by Vic Mizzy. Sadly, Hiken died between the filming and release of this, his only feature film.\n\nThe Green Man (1956) Memory betrays us in peculiar ways. There was a scene in some movie comedy or other — I no longer recall which one — that for years I misremembered almost completely. When I finally saw the picture in question again, I was more than a bit taken aback because my false memory of that scene (whatever it was) was so much funnier than the reality. I was a victim of memory distortion; somehow in the intervening years between first exposure and second my brain had filled in the details in a way that was almost infinitely more satisfying than what my eyes had actually seen. This psuedomemory recurred to me while watching the British comedy The Green Man because I saw it on the strength of a recommendation by Stephen Fry, whose appreciation of it I now realize was as misguided as my own for that nameless, long-ago seen comedy. In “A Critical Condition,” one of the essays in his book Paperweight, Fry writes, “As a child I saw a film on television starring Alastair Sim called The Green Man. Like almost any picture featuring that incomparable genius it contains moments of as absolute a joy as one is ever permitted on this sublunary plain. There is one scene, in which he attempts to bustle a female palm court trio out of a room that he needs to be vacated, which remains as funny as anything committed to celluloid.” Well! It sounded like something Billy Wilder and I.A.L. Diamond had unaccountably left out of Some Like it Hot. Who wouldn’t want to see that?\n\nI waited with great anticipation for the palm court sequence and when it arrived was utterly flummoxed to find the action consisted of little more than a somewhat anxious Sim asking the ladies of the trio to join him for drinks in the adjacent bar, and the women, after delightedly agreeing, following him out. That was it. Not that The Green Man was as puny a thing as the critic who offended Fry by deeming it “a thin, ultimately unsatisfactory vehicle for Sim” would have his readers believe. Sim, as a very successful middle-class assassin, is marvelous, as he nearly always was, the picture is cleverly constructed by Frank Launder and Sidney Gilliat (based on their play), directed with assurance if not flair by Robert Day (and an uncredited Basil Dearden) and the supporting cast, which includes George Cole, Jill Adams, Avril Angers, John Chandos, Terry-Thomas, Raymond Huntley and Dora Bryan, performs with brio. But Stephen Fry, alas, appears to have been the victim of the same, unreliable memory distortion that also afflicted me.\n\nLove and Death (1975) At the time of its release, this was considered Woody Allen’s most pretentious movie, by critics who hadn’t yet lived. Considering that this satire on Russian literature includes take-offs on, and homages to, Tolstoy, Dostoevsky (an entire dialogue scene composed of his titles), Chekhov and, although he was not Russian, Ingmar Bergman, pretentious Love and Death certainly is. It is also extremely funny.\n\nIf Sleeper gave Diane Keaton her first exposure as a comedian of no small inspiration, her performance here delivers something very close to genius. As Sonja, the lifelong love of Boris Grushenko (Allen) Keaton skewers every pseudointellectual Barnard graduate who ever pontificated mindlessly and reactively, and, in the scene in which Allen and the man (Lloyd Batista) he’s about to impersonate take turns bopping her on the head with a wine bottle, she’s blissfully funny. Sleeper represented an enormous leap in Allen’s filmmaking, and Love and Death is even more impressive, enriched by Ghislain Cloquet’s fine-grained, deeply saturated cinematography. The movie also contains Allen’s first great ensemble cast, including James Tolkan (as Napoleon); Olga Georges-Picot in a role intended for Groucho Marx’s secretary and manager Erin Fleming who had appeared in everything… about sex but re-cast when that mentally unbalanced woman stormed off the set in outrage; Zvee Scooler as Boris’ idiot father; Despo Diamantidou as his disapproving mother; Jessica Harper as Sonja’s Chekhovianly depressed friend; Alfred Lutter as the young Boris; Frank Adu in a hilarious bit as a black drill sergeant during the French invasion of Russia; and the wonderful Harold Gould, who shares a side-splitting dueling sequence with Allen.\n\nSome of the set-pieces are uproarious, some merely wan, and a few of the jokes don’t work at all; hearing that Boris is seen leading a cheering squad during a battle, for example, is funnier than actually seeing him do it. Allen’s Bob Hope impersonation, honed in his earlier movies (Bananas, Sleeper and as the Jester in sex) gets a full workout here, and in some ways the picture is little but a remake of the 1946 Hope comedy Monsieur Beaucaire, right up to the hero’s surprise execution at the end. But it’s handsome looking, occasionally brilliant, and the lulls don’t last long. The score, comprised solely of music by Sergei Prokofiev, includes well-chosen excerpts from “The Lieutenant Kijé Suite,” “Alexander Nevsky,” “The Love for Three Oranges,” the String Quintet in E and “Scythian Suite” for Orchestra.\n\nThe Night of the Iguana (1964) After A Streetcar Named Desire, the finest of all Tennessee Williams screen adaptations. John Huston, the director and with Anthony Veiller co-scenarist, working in Gabriel Figueroa’s luminous black-and-white cinematography, enhanced what was effective in Williams’ 1961 drama (the characters, the situation, the dialogue and the jungle-like Mexican atmosphere) and removed what was superfluous (the 1940 time-frame and the German Nazi tourists), crafting a genuinely cinematic experience that is also a faithful interpretation of a great American dramatist’s last important play. Richard Burton has one of his best movie roles as the Reverend Dr. T. Lawrence Shannon, a disgraced minister driven by circumstance to shepherding a bus full of middle-aged church ladies around Mexico, drinking too much, fending off the advances of a hormonally unbalanced teenage girl, and being put into a blind panic by all of it. Shot largely in Puerto Vallarta, then little but “a remote fishing village” but which the unrelenting paparazzi fixation on The Liz and Dick Show eventually helped turned into an exclusive resort which I assume the fishermen and their families could no longer afford to live in, The Night of the Iguana exhibits throughout the sort of supple artistic control Huston lavished on material that really engaged him. Williams of course was continually drawn to his twin themes of the sacred versus the profane and the struggle of the sensitive to survive brutality; here he embodies the former in Shannon’s battle with his own nature (and the nature of the girl, and of the earthy widow who’s got her eye on him) and the latter through the character of the gentle spinster Hannah Jelkes, companion to her grandfather, an aged poet embarked on his last tour and hopeful of completing his latest poem before the little strokes that beset him carry his fragile spirit away.\n\nI hope I don’t make The Night of the Iguana sound deadly, because it’s the furthest thing from that, and not least because of Huston’s superb cast. As Maxine Faulk, the lusty widow of Shannon’s oldest friend, Ava Gardner gives what is probably her finest performance — dallying with two strange maraca-playing Mexican youths (Fidelmar Durán and Roberto Leyva) out of her anger at, and jealousy over, Shannon, laying out her disappointments in invective yet capable of great kindness. As Hannah, Deborah Kerr is an utterly transcendent figure, not fluttery and self-deluding as Blanche Du Bois or Alma Winemiller in Summer and Smoke are or driven to ruthlessness like Maggie the Cat but practical-minded and, despite her genteel poverty, filled with compassion for the sufferings of others, even those like Shannon whom she correctly suggests enjoy their own mental anguish. She, and Cyril Delevanti as the poet Nonno, are deeply moving; when Nonno recites his final poem while his granddaughter takes it down, it would take a stonier constitution than mine not to melt before the beauty both of the language and Delevanti’s becalmed, ancient face. Before that consummate event, during her long discussion with the immobilized Shannon, Miss Jelks observes, “Nothing human disgusts me, Mr. Shannon, unless it is unkind or violent.” This seems to me Williams’ response to the Roman playwright Terence’s “Homo sum: humani nihil a me alienum puto.” (“I am human: I consider nothing human is alien to me.”) Interestingly, as Williams wrote it Hannah’s line concludes “unless it is unkind, violent.” Someone (Huston and Veiller, or perhaps Kerr herself) altered it slightly, and for the better. Poetic expression like that can work onstage but is not as easily digested in the more realistic medium of film.\n\nSue Lyon, the physically overripe Lolita of the Kubrick picture two years earlier, fully captures what Orson Welles once called the insanity of adolescence, careening from her lubricious crush on Shannon to suddenly hating him to switching her allegiance to the tour’s young bus driver (James “Skip” Ward). Mary Boylan does wonders with the brow-beaten tourist Miss Peebles, but Grayson Hall steals every scene she’s in as Lyons’ chaperone Miss Fellowes, a woman clearly in the thrall of her own Lesbian obsession but, as a convention-minded church choral director, unwilling or unable to see it for what it is. Although the movie could be seen as cruel toward the character, even her chief nemesis Shannon is at pains to protect her from the self-knowledge he correctly believes would destroy her. Benjamin Frankel composed a beautiful score for the picture, Huston’s best work between The African Queen and The Kremlin Letter. Yet in his infinite wisdom and renowned critical perspicacity, Leonard Maltin in his movie guide deems this poetic masterpiece a “plodding tale.” He would.\n\nBroadway Danny Rose (1984) I’ve never quite been able to reconcile the snideness and cynicism of Woody Allen with some of the pictures he’s made that suggest a sweeter soul than he generally displays. Are they the result of calculation merely? Broadway Danny Rose is one of those seemingly incongruous movies, an openhearted paean to the losers of show-biz that is both unexpectedly moving and sidesplittingly funny. Told as a long, shaggy-dog anecdote by Sandy Baron to a table of his fellow comedians at the Carnegie Deli, the picture doesn’t make fun of Danny’s acts, such as the stuttering ventriloquist or the balloon-folding couple, as much as it laughs at Danny’s unflappability — his unshakable belief that any one of his stable of barely employable clients could become wealthy and famous. It’s easy to laugh at a man who keeps reminding these pathetic acts to say to themselves, “Smile, star, strong,” yet Danny genuinely loves and care for these bottom-feeders, and the casual way he’s betrayed by his favorite, a washed-up singer called Lou Canova (Nick Apollo Forte) and Lou’s Mafia-connected mistress Tina (Mia Farrow) shatters him. For once in an Allen performance the pain isn’t just a story point indifferently acted; when near the end Tina unexpectedly shows up at the tatty Thanksgiving dinner Danny holds for his clients the look of deep hurt on Allen’s face is remarkable.\n\nGordon Willis shot the movie in thick-grained black-and-white, and the picture’s look renders the action as a modern fable, remembered not from a distant past but recounted at best a few months later. Among the comics at the Carnegie, in addition to Baron, are Jackie Gayle, Will Jordan (when people imitate Ed Sullivan, if indeed they still do, they’re really imitating Jordan’s impersonation of Sullivan) and Allen’s then-manager Jack Rollins, and Milton Berle, Howard Cosell and Joe Franklin also appear as themselves. Gina DeAngelis is marvelous as a vindictive Mob mother and Farrow, hiding behind smoked eyeglasses, gives a terrific comic performance as the sort of woman no one would ever mistake her for (or, up to the time of the movie, ever thought her capable of enacting.) Among the comic pleasures of Broadway Danny Rose is a hysterically funny sequence in the warehouse in which Macy’s Thanksgiving Day balloons are stored involving Danny, Tina, a gun-wielding hood and the unexpected release of helium.\n\nIt’s a Wonderful Life (1946) There has probably never been a more manipulative, counterfeit “populist” in American movies than Frank Capra, and this perennial holiday favorite (a dud in its time which only became popular through loss of its copyright) is the perfect illustration of that. What Capra did well, such as depicting the dark corners of American platitudes, he did exceptionally well here, as when James Stewart’s George Bailey rejects a weeping Donna Reed and marriage even as he’s embracing her in desperation, or when with his life in tatters he hugs his young son, or as with tears in his eyes he’s praying in a bar for a deliverance he doesn’t believe possible. (Capra realized too late that he needed to move the camera in and when Stewart said he couldn’t perform the scene again, resorted to a slow optical printer zoom.) Casting is half the battle here, and in James Stewart Capra got a man capable of both enormous charm and pitch-black despair; it was George Bailey that led the critic David Denby several years ago to claim that Stewart was the greatest actor in American movies, a sentiment with which I wholly concur.\n\nAlas, what Capra did badly is in even greater abundance in It’s a Wonderful Life: That cloying, mealy-mouthed (and patently phony) embrace of treacly platitudes that mars if it does not ruin every picture of his except It Happened One Night. It’s particularly galling when one knows that Capra, although he publicly proclaimed himself a populist, loathed and distrusted people, in groups or singly, and privately worshiped fascism, adopting the political traits and impulses of the natural-born reactionary. His “convictions” tended to be those of his principal screenwriter, Robert Riskin, from which he ran in terror during the Blacklist years. It’s telling that Capra is one of four scenarists credited on It’s a Wonderful Life, because George Bailey’s dilemma is his director’s as well, that of a man who hates what he believes he’s supposed to love. I don’t mind that Capra, along with the husband-and-wife team of Frances Goodrich and Albert Hackett (and Jo Swerling, who also worked on the script) lards on the ironies with a trowel or even that he paints George’s antagonist Mr. Potter (Lionel Barrymore) as an irredeemable villain whose fangs fairly drip with poison like the spider George compares him to so much as I do his concomitant wallowing in sentimentality; that bit about bells and angels’ wings makes my teeth ache.\n\nAlthough Capra was too profligate with money for the picture to ever show a profit, it must also be admitted that having built an entire town on the backlot, he used it effectively. The cinematography by his gifted director of photography Joseph Walker (with Joseph Biroc) is exceptional as well, and Dimitri Tiomkin’s music is less oppressively heavy than was his norm. The director also got, in addition to Stewart and Reed, lovely and/or thoroughly engaging performances from a large cast including Thomas Mitchell, Henry Travers, Beulah Bondi, Frank Faylen, Ward Bond, Gloria Grahame, H. B. Warner, Frank Albertson, Todd Karns, Sheldon Leonard, Charles Lane, Carl Switzer, Ellen Corby, Dick Elliott and Bobbie Anderson, who is extraordinary as the young George.\n\nEliot M. Camarena believes the movie depicts the final thoughts of a suicide, and although Capra certainly would have disagreed, it’s an avenue of interpretation worth pursuing.\n\nRadio Days (1987) Woody Allen’s sweetest movie, a loving tribute to the mass medium of his childhood refracted through a fictionalized depiction of his family. It’s also among the writer-director’s most beautiful pictures, shot with a burnished glow by the great Italian cinematographer Carlo Di Palma on Santo Loquasto’s richly designed and executed sets. One could, I suppose, accuse Radio Days of nostalgic excess but the tone is generally so light and amusing it’s a bit like Fellini’s Amarcord translated into American pop iconography. Allen narrates, and his youthful doppelgänger Joe is charmingly played by the young Seth Green, with Julie Kavner and Michael Tucker as his bickering parents. The large ensemble cast includes Joy Newman as Joe’s teenage sister, Josh Mostel as his quarrelsome uncle (“Take the gas pipe!”), Renée Lippin as his equally bovine wife, Mia Farrow as a talentless aspiring actress, Danny Aiello as her would-be mob assassin, Gina DeAngelis as his practical mother, Kenneth Mars as the family’s rabbi, Wallace Shawn as the hilariously incongruous radio voice of The Masked Avenger and Diane Keaton in a lovely New Year’s sequence as a nightclub singer crooning Cole Porter’s “You’d Be So Nice to Come Home To” (and incidentally wiping Farrow’s anemic rendition of “I Don’t Want to Walk Without You” off the screen and out of your memory.) Although Radio Days is a love-letter to Allen’s reminiscences of radio it’s also a Valentine to Dianne Wiest. As young Joe’s chic, marriage-minded Aunt Bea, Wiest is the movie’s vibrant human fulcrum, ever hopeful of romance yet nearly always thwarted; one of her suitors leaves her stranded on the road when he becomes convinced the Martians have landed, another is married and a third (Robert Joy), seemingly the most appropriate match for her, turns out to be grieving the death of his boyfriend.\n\nThe wonderful soundtrack of period recordings includes Benny Goodman’s “Body and Soul,” Glenn Miller’s “In the Mood,” Tommy Dorsey’s “Opus One” and “I’m Gettin’ Sentimental Over You,” Artie Shaw’s “Frenesi,” The Mills Brothers’ “Paper Doll,” Bing Crosby and The Andrews Sisters’ “Pistol Packin’ Mama,” Carmen Miranda’s “South American Way” (to which Newman joyously lip-synchs, accompanied by Tucker and Mostel), The Ink Spots’ “If I Didn’t Care,” Xavier Cugat’s “Babalu” and “One, Two, Three, Kick,” Guy Lombardo’s “That Old Feeling,” Duke Ellington’s “Take the ‘A’ Train” and, in a nice sequence, a then-living link to the past Allen was evoking: The aged Kitty Carlisle performing “They’re Either Too Young or Too Old” on the radio.\n\nThe Band Wagon (1953) Produced by MGM’s Freed Unit the year after Singin’ in the Rain, written (like Rain) by Betty Comden and Adolph Green and based (also like its predecessor) around an existing musical catalog — in this case the elegant songs of Howard Dietz and Arthur Schwartz — The Band Wagon is usually treated like the proverbial red-headed stepchild. But how fair is to compare any movie against what many people (myself included) regard as the best of all film musicals and find it wanting? For one thing, under the direction of the design-oriented Vincente Minnelli, it looks even better than Singin’ in the Rain. For another, it’s got Fred Astaire.\n\nI hope if you’re reading these pages you don’t need to be told that Astaire was the greatest performer in musicals, or why. Just watching him stroll beside a stationary train with his distinctive walk while softly singing in that inimitable voice the Dietz and Schwartz standard “By Myself” is joyous, and when he gets an opportunity to do what he did best, there is almost no one in movies who could, or can, touch him. Comden and Green used Astaire’s insecurities to flesh out his character, a faded movie star taking a chance on a Broadway show: His concern that Cyd Charisse, his dancing partner in the picture, was too tall for him, for example, or too much of a ballet dancer, or that he had no natural sympathy with or ability to perform Michael Kidd’s stylistic choreography. Despite his fears and as a result of his willingness to be persuaded by people with talent, Astaire gets to do more in The Band Wagon that he had in years, and in more different but related styles. He has a great number with an authentic shoe-shine man (Leroy Daniels) in “Shine on Your Shoes”; a breathtaking pas de deux with Charisse in “Dancing in the Dark“; a charming duet with the wonderful Nanette Fabray in “I Love Louisa” (which he originally performed with his sister Adele in the stage revue, also called The Bandwagon); an uproarious version of “Triplets” with Fabray and Jack Buchanan; a long, funny Mickey Spillane spoof (“The Girl Hunt Ballet,” written by Alan Jay Lerner) that also includes a sexy dance with Charisse which virtually defines the appeal of both partners; and, with Buchanan, an exquisite song-and-dance to one of the most sophisticated ballads ever written, “I Guess I’ll Have to Change My Plan,” gloriously designed by Oliver Smith. Watch the way Astaire slides out of his highchair in “Triplets” and seems to be moving to the floor in graceful slow motion, and marvel that such golden beings once walked the earth.\n\nStreamers (1983) During what I think of as his wilderness years, between the debacle of Popeye (1980) and the triumph of Vincent and Theo (1990), what Robert Altman mostly did was stage plays, and in a few instances, film them. The movie of David Rabe’s excoriating Vietnam-era drama Streamers came just before Altman’s superb condensation of Donald Freed and Arnold M. Stone’s Nixon fantasia Secret Honor (1984) and while neither was seen by nearly enough people (Streamers cost a mere $2 million to make but earned only $378,452) both represent a different way of looking at plays cinematically. Streamers doesn’t feel entirely real, the way McCabe and Mrs. Miller did, or California Split, but it also doesn’t look exactly like a stage play either. Some critics of the movie were bothered by that, and there are times (as with the lack of outside activity around the Army barracks in which it’s set) when the picture does feel hermetically sealed. Yet it’s so well directed, so beautifully lit (the cinematograper was Pierre Mignot) and so magnificently acted by its exceptional cast this slight air of neither-fish-nor-fowlness in no way detracts from the power of the drama.\n\nIn 1975 when Mike Nichols directed the premiere of the play at the Long Wharf, theatre in America was seldom as strong, as confrontational, as violent or as bloody as Streamers, and there were a lot of walk-outs and, in New Haven, Off-Broadway, on Broadway and in Los Angeles, reports of men and women fainting in their theater seats. I’ve always found it interesting that people can sit through all sorts of violence, gore and human viscera being spewed in a movie, the most realistic of all performing artforms, without demur yet are overcome by seeing it done by live actors on a stage. Perhaps the very artificiality of theatre, however heightened its reality, lulls them into such a state of comfortable alienation that the explosion of violence un-moors them. I also confess that I’ve never quite understood the essential situation of Rabe’s play, which primarily concerns sexual tensions in a stateside barracks. While the interior struggle of a draftee to come to grips with his homosexuality is one countless young soldiers have dealt with, in every nation, presumably for centuries, the way Ritchie (Mitchell Lichtenstein) flirts with the others, flaunting what he’s uncertain of himself, doesn’t ring true for 1965, when Streamers is set. Nor do the attitudes of his barracks-mates (Matthew Modine and David Alan Grier) who in a comparable situation would probably have beaten Richie up on a regular basis or otherwise have made him so miserable he would have asked for a transfer. Here they reject his being what they call a “faggot,” but don’t despise him. That, however dismissive, still seems a bit enlightened, if I may use the word, for that time.\n\nHowever, Rabe’s dialogue is so good, the acting here of so high a quality and Altman’s staging of it so effective as to sweep such cavils aside. All of the young men are splendid, but Lichtenstein and the terrifyingly mercurial Michael Wright as the outsider who deliberately stirs the tensions, are better than that, as are Guy Boyd and, especially, George Dzundza, as the veteran officers who float in and out of the action and whose generally drunken presence is a fearful reminder of what is about to happen to the boys when they are finally shipped to Vietnam. Dzundza has a long monologue at the end that, as written and acted, are pocket illustrations both of why American stage drama was once revered, and how much has been lost in the decades since Streamers premiered.\n\nthe birdcage (1996) The latest (and, so far, last) iteration of the popular French stage play by Jean Poiret that became an internationally record-breaking movie in 1978 and a Broadway musical which despite premiering in the age of Reagan, AIDS and rampant public and private bigotry against gay men and Lesbians,* became a long-running, Tony Award-winning hit. The musical La Cage Aux Folles kept its action in Europe (the original creators, who included Tommy Tune, Jay Presson Allen and Maury Yeston, had planned to set theirs in New Orleans); for the movie, wittily written by Elaine May and flavorsomely directed by Mike Nichols, the action was, wisely, moved to South Miami Beach and the central characters made American. (The sole exception is the Guatemalan houseboy Agador, portrayed by Hank Azaria in an achingly funny performance.) The basic plot remains the same: Middle-aged couple consisting of club owner (Robin Williams) and drag star (Nathan Lane) find their son (Dan Futterman) is getting married to the daughter (Calista Flockheart) of a Moral Majority-type Senator (Gene Hackman), himself fleeing the press over a sex-scandal involving his late political partner. Add in the politician’s convention-minded spouse (Dianne Wiest), a conniving National Enquirer reporter (Tom McGowan) and attempts to, variously, temporarily get rid of the drag queen or train him to pass, to remodel the couple’s apartment in Early Conservative and to inveigle the boy’s biological mother (Christine Baranski) to put in an appearance at the dinner party, and pandemonium naturally ensues.\n\nI like this edition of the material better than the original, and infinitely more than the stage musical. May has a way with a comic line that is as distinctive as Larry Gelbart’s or Woody Allen’s. In addition, that master of behavioral direction Mike Nichols was the perfect person to guide an enterprise that, although wildly funny, could if not kept on a believably human line become protracted and silly. Emmanuel Lubezki lit the movie to bring out the pastel surroundings, Jonathan Tunick contributed some characteristic melodies and orchestrations, Stephen Sondheim added a nifty number (“Little Dream”) for Williams to stage with Lane and a sullen dancer, Ann Roth contributed witty costumes, there is some splendid matte work by Robert Stromberg and Mike Wassel, and the cast performs the material with comedic gusto and fresh invention, especially Hackman and Lane. The latter’s beard is noticeable during his scenes as “Mother,” however, proving Billy Wilder right for shooting Some Like it Hot in black-and-white.\n\nYou Only Live Once (1937) A tough, nihilistic Fritz Lang picture starring Sylvia Sidney as an idealistic legal secretary and Henry Fonda as the ex-con she believes in. The screenplay by Gene Towne and Charles Graham Baker sets up Eddie Taylor (Fonda) as such a born loser that when he’s arrested for an armored car robbery and a batch of murders and sentenced to death you know that no matter what else happens, his story is not going to end well. Fonda pitches his soft tenor low, and gravelly, as if Eddie is in a constant state of fury and although the picture lost money his performance in it almost certainly led to better quality projects than he’d enjoyed during his first two years in Hollywood. 15 minutes of the movie were taken out of the original hour and forty minute cut, allegedly for then-extreme violence and it shows; some of the picture’s continuity is off as a result. (The deleted footage is lost and was likely destroyed.) The cinematography by Leon Shamroy, especially in the restored Classic Flix Blu-ray, is striking and Alfred Newman composed a strong score with a lovely main theme for the lovers. If you know and appreciate Newman, you can tell it’s him from the first notes of the main title.\n\nThe Romantic Englishwoman (1975) I don’t really know what to say about this British curio directed by the expatriate American blacklistee Joseph Losey except that it’s well acted (Glenda Jackson, Michael Caine and Helmut Berger are the leads), occasionally witty (the screenplay is by Tom Stoppard and Thomas Wiseman out of the latter’s novel), beautifully photographed (by Gerry Fisher, who at times almost makes Glenda Jackson look attractive) and engagingly scored (by Richard Hartley). But it’s such an elliptical chimera of a movie that with very few changes it could have been a Harold Pinter play, and I don’t mean that as a compliment. And while in real life Berger, who plays a sociopathic drug smuggler and pathological liar, identified as bisexual, his performance as a part-time heterosexual gigolo is, shall we say, less than convincing. What with his pronounced lisp and languid, piss-elegant walk we keep expecting him to come on to Caine rather than Jackson. Surely that’s not what was intended?\n\nMan’s Favorite Sport? (1963) An intermittently hilarious variation by Howard Hawks on Bringing Up Baby, with Rock Hudson in the unenviable position of working up a sub-par imitation of Cary Grant and Paula Prentiss not evoking Katharine Hepburn and thereby coming off much better. In John Fenton Murray and Steve McNeil’s screenplay, Hudson is a fishing expert at Abercrombie & Fitch who has never fished in his life and who is bedeviled by the determinedly wacky Prentiss, who enters him into a prominent fishing competition and then must teach him everything he needs to know in three days. The picture is buoyed by Hawks’ expert way with comic set-ups and dialogue, by Russell Harlan’s scrumptious color photography, by a bouncy main title song by Henry Mancini and Johnny Mercer, some very funny sight gags (the look a bear gives the camera as it rides by on a runaway motorbike is priceless) and by the sparkling supporting cast which includes John McGiver, Roscoe Karns, James Westerfield, Regis Toomey, Forrest Lewis and, as a phlegmatic professional Indian, Norman Alden. Prentiss can’t match Hepburn’s originality in Baby, but she is an original nonetheless, especially when she laughs, which is often. Hawks later said of her that she was fine but couldn’t remember what she’d done from take to take, creating continuity problems. Yet she’s so engaging you don’t notice the technical flaws. Why her performance here didn’t lead to better opportunities than What’s New, Pussycat? is one of those eternal mysteries. Hudson is in his own way a good comedian, but it’s almost impossible to watch him in this role and not think of Grant, to Hudson’s detriment. Cary Grant’s touch with a comedic line was nonpareil and, like Fred Astaire, when he walked across a room there was no mistaking him. Hudson walks like a former truck driver.\n\nLove Me Tonight (1932) This frothy, Lubitsch-like musical concoction is often regarded as one of the greatest of all movie musicals. It isn’t quite that, but it’s extremely entertaining, imaginatively directed, smartly written and beautifully scored. The director, Rouben Mamoulian, does some nice things, such as the way he hands off “Isn’t It Romantic?” from Maurice Chevalier — who sings it satirically — to various characters in Paris, on a train out of town and in the suburbs where in Jeanette MacDonald’s voice it becomes a soaring ballad. The songs are by Richard Rodgers and Lorenz Hart, and Hart also wrote some of the dialogue, in rhyming couplets, which sounds rather fey but, as staged and acted, is charming. (The score includes “Lover,” “Mimi” and the title song.) The script, by Samuel Hoffenstein, George Marion Jr. and Waldemar Young, is light and witty, built on Graustarkian implausibilities cleverly worked out. Victor Milner’s cinematography is extraordinary, and the delightful supporting cast includes the peerless Charles Ruggles as an impoverished vicomte; Charles Butterworth as MacDonald’s thwarted would-be swain; Myrna Loy as a man-mad comtesse; Elizabeth Patterson, Ethel Griffies and Blanche Friderici as a trio of dizzy aunts; Robert Greig as a major domo; and C. Aubrey Smith as the imperious duke who rules all of their lives. If you like Chevalier, as I do, you’ll be entranced by his performance as the exuberant Parisian tailor, but as the princess above his station MacDonald is a little tough to take at times, especially when we’re exhorted by the director to gaze upon those vaguely homely shopgirl’s features of hers and pretend she’s a great beauty.\n\nA Boy Named Charlie Brown (1969) The first Peanuts feature was wildly successful in its time, and broke Disney’s exclusive hold on big-screen animation. Charles M. Schulz’s screenplay, based on the notion of Charlie Brown being entered into a national spelling bee, is a charmer; it retains, and builds on, the characteristics of the strip that made it so unique and treasurable through the decades. Although I think that in his direction of the Peanuts features and TV specials Bill Melendez often flattened out the look of Schulz’s renderings, and occasionally made them downright ugly, his direction of the picture is assured, inventive (lots of split screens) and often very funny. While Snoopy’s skating/hockey fantasy at the Rockefeller Center rink is perfectly in keeping with his character the long Schroeder sequence set to his playing the Beethoven “Pathetique,” is a more puzzling inclusion, but most of what’s in the movie is entirely apt.\n\nThe musical score is variable, what with Rod McKuen’s typically gauzy ballad — why, during what is obviously the school year, does he twice invoke August afternoons, and what exactly is this “kind of magic that only little boys can do”? — vying with John Scott Trotter’s arrangements of the familiar Vince Guaraldi themes, but the vocal casting is not only just right it’s nearly definitive: Peter Robbins’ distinctive husky rendering of Charlie Brown, Pamelyn Ferdin’s conclusive Lucy van Pelt, Glenn Gilger’s gently philosophical Linus and Erin Sullivan’s entirely adorable Sally Brown.\n\nBelow, a newspaper advertisement for the weirdest movie coupling I think I’ve ever seen. It’s like an entry in one of those competitions to find the least (or most) appropriate double-feature.\n\nThis could be a satirical mock-up. I sincerely hope it is. We’re Hanging You from Your Nipples, Charlie Brown!\n\nThe Jungle Book (1967) I ended 2022 revisiting one of my earliest movie loves. I was the perfect age when this one was released to embrace a new Disney animated feature. As a cartoon-mad child, Walt Disney was at the center of my imaginative world; when he died in December of 1966, I was as stunned and saddened as I had been when my beloved maternal great-grandmother passed away in her sleep the year before. Remember, “The Wonderful World of Color” was a television fixture in those years, and the presence of Walt himself, although he appeared less often then than he had in the early days of its previous iteration (“Walt Disney Presents”) was still occasionally a part of that weekly experience.\n\nAlthough my sister and I saw Cinderella in 1965, the reissue of Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs, to which my mother took me on a memorable afternoon in 1967, made so marked an impression on me that I have for years mistakenly believed it was my first animated feature. I tended to obsession even then, and Snow White was the focus of my six-year-old’s ardor for several months… until The Jungle Book arrived and I went duly gaga over it: I had the special double-length Gold Key Giant Jungle Book comic (I wore the cover off that one through obsessive re-reading), Jungle Book Disneykins figurines from Royal Pudding, Jungle Book temporary tattoos, a Jungle Book oil-paint-by-numbers kit, the wonderful Joe Liptak-designed Jungle Book View Master pack, a Jungle Book Whitman frame-tray puzzle, a Jungle Book coloring book, Jungle Book books, and, of course, the Jungle Book soundtrack album, whose surface I eventually wore to the smooth consistency of a hockey-puck. (My poor parents.) Seeing the picture again in its 1990 re-release I was considerably less enthusiastic, and not merely due to being 20 years older. Yet it’s remarkable what an additional three decades can do for a picture, and to your perception of it. Seeing The Jungle Book again in 2022 I still think, as I did going to the 1978 and 1990 reissues, that it’s too self-consciously (and anachronistically) hip for its own good, especially in Phil Harris’ and Louis Prima’s likable but slangy vocal performances. The rich character designs (by Bill Peet and Ken Anderson) and backgrounds (Al Dempster), however, are superb and the animation wonderfully expressive, particularly that by Milt Kahl, John Lounsbery, Frank Thomas and Ollie Johnston, who animated most of the picture by themselves.\n\nCavils aside, although I’ve seen The Jungle Book numerous times since it was first released I don’t think I’ve enjoyed it as much since the age of six as I did watching it again on New Year’s Eve.\n\n*I have never, and will never, employ “LGBT” or any of its increasingly ludicrous (and increasingly wearisome) acronyms for the so-called gay community. You would think any politician who panders by routinely mouthing such barbarisms as “LGBTQIA2S+” would find the letters causing his or her tongue to cleave to the roof of his or her mouth. Further, I will not be a party to pushing transgenderism, either as a part of that “community” or otherwise, especially to the self-questioning young. My reasons are manifold. First, until relatively recently, transsexuals did not wish to be considered as having anything in common with Lesbians and gay men, and I am perfectly happy to honor their previous wishes indefinitely… especially when they push gay men entirely out of leadership positions at Pride events, as happened two summers ago in New York. Second, I resent the coopting for its own highly suspicious reasons by the unbalanced Woke of a movement that did so much, beginning in 1969, to make my life less anxious. Third, when I was a youth the term was simply “gay,” period, which always seemed entirely sufficient. Later the acronym was “GLB,” although few of us trusted bisexuals, for good reason; they may have affairs with us but they nearly always go back to safe, heterosexual pairings. Besides, no one asked me whether I minded taking the second seat to gay women, who make up a mere 16% of the self-identifying gay population. (I did, and I do. Is this a social movement, or imprecations for dealing with a shipwreck, where the women must be gotten to the lifeboats first?) Fourth, I do not see the advantage, aside perhaps from providing political comfort, of labeling oneself in any way. Fifth, and perhaps most important: These labels are not used to unite. They are intended to divide, and are being used to do just that. Did the veterans of the Stonewall riots really put their bodies on the line so that one day children could have their hormones blocked and their breasts and genitals removed and have know-nothing college students claim, without citing the slightest evidence, that evil white gay men removed blacks and Latinos from the movement?\n\nText copyright 2023 by Scott Ross\n\nBy Scott Ross\n\nNothing I’ve seen so far this year has elicited in me a great desire to write a full review. Hence this installment of minis.\n\nThe Man from Laramie (1955) The sixth and final collaboration between James Stewart and the director Anthony Mann is a solid adult Western, although not a patch on their best work together. It’s based on a well-regarded novel by Thomas T. Flynn, originally serialized in The Saturday Evening Post, and with a screenplay credited to Philip Yordan and Frank Burt. Burt was a frequent contributor to Stewart’s splendid, short-lived radio series The Six-Shooter; Yordan was one of the busiest fronts of the blacklist era, but as he claimed authorship of any number of disputed scripts whose actual writers later challenged his participation, it’s anyone’s guess whether he wrote a word of this one, or who else might have. The credit itself is less urgent than that the material begins promisingly and, while never less than intelligent, devolves irredeemably into melodrama — probably because there is simply too much plot for one brief movie to contain. Stewart, seeking the seller of rifles to Apaches (and whose Cavalry brother has died as a result) finds himself at loggerheads with an isolated town’s wealthiest and most powerful family of ranchers, led by Donald Crisp, secretly going blind and haunted by recurring dreams in which a stranger murders his arrogant son (Alex Nicol). His foreman (Arthur Kennedy), meanwhile, struggles to make his worth clear to the old man while battling the owner’s spoiled, impulsive progeny. And that’s not to mention the son’s fiancée (Cathy O’Donnell), nor Crisp’s nearest rival (Aline MacMahon), who has an agenda of her own. You see what I mean about the overlarded plot? Stewart, Crisp, Kennedy and MacMahon acquit themselves admirably, Jack Elam shows up as a villainous ranch-hand, Charles Lang’s Technicolor and CinemaScope photography is sumptuous, George Duning contributed a fine score, and Mann’s direction is both taut and expansive. Unfortunately, their combined efforts don’t add up to much. Interestingly, Mann later began another Stewart Western, the deeply disappointing Night Passage and quit, feeling — quite rightly — that the thing was “trash.” Mann was entirely correct; had the finished movie hewn closer to Norman A. Fox’s very effective short novel, it might have been an ideal picture for him, and for Stewart.\n\nBend of the River (1953) This one is everything The Man from Laramie isn’t. Based on the 1950 novel Bend of the Snake by Bill Gulick (whose later The Hallelujah Train is perhaps the wittiest and most delightful Western novel ever written) it features a finely-wrought screenplay by the redoubtable Borden Chase, stunning cinematography by Irving Glassberg of the Oregon wilderness (the glimpses of the Mt. Hood area are especially mouth-watering), a rousing Hans J. Salter score, tight Anthony Mann direction, a compelling story and terrific central performances by James Stewart and Arthur Kennedy — although the latter plays what amounts to a precursor of his The Man from Laramie character. The picture concerns the efforts of a former border-raider turned scout (Stewart) to supply a wagon-train of homesteaders with the crucial provisions they need to survive their first Oregonian winter. Somehow that précis makes the thing sound deadly, but it isn’t; the movie is done with the intelligence, humor and dramatic integrity that mark Gulick’s work, and at 91 minutes it’s self-contained and compelling. There’s a spectacularly effective climactic gun battle, and the fine supporting cast includes Julie Adams, Jay C. Flippen, Rock Hudson, Harry Morgan, Royal Dano and Frances Bavier. In such company you don’t even mind the presence of Stepin Fetchit.\n\nThe Hot Rock (1972) William Goldman, a longtime admirer of Donald E. Westlake’s comic caper novels, wrote the script for this, a transliteration of the first in Westlake’s ingenious Dortmunder series (originally planned, curiously, as a “Parker” novel for the author’s grittier non de plume Richard Stark.) Goldman’s screenplay is a model of adaptation: Everything that makes the book work is there, perfectly trimmed to screen-time, with very little interpolation from the screenwriter, and no fat whatsoever. Goldman’s script deviates in minor ways, and they only add to the pleasure: First by giving Dortmunder an ulcer — a comic invention I’m surprised Westlake never thought of — and second by letting his crew emerge triumphant; his ending is so perfectly realized it makes you grin in appreciation. (Although I am not widely read in the Dortmunder novels, those I have assayed invariably end with the team losing its illegal quest in some ironic manner. Goldman upends this, and you’re grateful for the deviation.) The entire picture, wittily directed by Peter Yates, generates goodwill; you know from the first scene that you’re in good hands, and that allows you to relax and enjoy the ride. It helps too that the characters are comically idiosyncratic but never cute or self-consciously “wacky.” The plot concerns the theft, for an African delegate (Moses Gunn, wry and very funny) of a fabulous gem; once the caper is pulled off, it runs into seemingly endless complications. Robert Redford is Dortmunder, too smart for his makeshift crew of hapless would-be jewel thieves but too desperate, and maybe too essentially decent, to do any better. His cohorts are George Segal, Ron Leibman and Paul Sand; Charlotte Rae has a good cameo as Leibman’s mother(!), with whom he listens to race track recordings; and Zero Mostel makes a kosher feast of his role as a duplicitous lawyer (or am I being redundant?) whom Goldman slyly promotes from the Sand character’s uncle to his father. Quincy Jones composed a spritely earworm of a main theme in march cadence, and the picture is one of those time-capsule movies that vividly capture the New York of the period: For example, during an unsettlingly vertiginous open helicopter trip (Leibman later said he was terrified) we catch long glimpses of the World Trade Center, then nearing completion. Surprisingly, considering Redford’s ascendancy at the time, The Hot Rock lost money on its release. Seeing it now, you can’t imagine why; it’s one of the cheeriest caper movies ever made, sunny and amusing. Watching it makes you feel happy and refreshed — good all over.\n\nTrue Crime (1999) There was an interesting movie in the journalistic story behind this one, but it was completely transformed between reality and realization, and not I think for the better. I presume the people who made it — Clint Eastwood, the director and star; the credited screenwriters Larry Gross, Paul Brickman and Stephen Schiff, as well as Andrew Klaven, on whose novel it was based — saw the story of a dogged journalist’s painstaking investigation of a miscarriage of justice as too prosaic and mundane: There was only one man’s freedom at stake, after all so those stakes, so beloved of the Hollywood suits, were duly raised, the central premise made more urgent by an innocent man’s impending execution for a murder he didn’t commit. It’s a schizophrenic movie; its central narrative is compelling and often defeats second-guessing, yet its arc is itself a cliché and the picture is cavalier in its sudden devolution into superman-type heroics and an anguished inner-city grandmother’s instant conversion to Eastwood’s comic sidekick. At the same time, the filmmaking is often so assured the damn thing almost works. Eastwood, however, was far too mature at this point in his career to play the serial cocksman, and the sight of him with his shirt off is no longer arousing, it’s distracting. If he wasn’t also the director, it would even seem cruel: You’re not enjoying the sensuality, you’re counting the folds in his flesh. And at 69 the former sex symbol looks years older. If the women with whom he consorts were as superannuated as he is, there might have been some poignancy to the enterprise. As it stands, his womanizing is just embarrassing. Eastwood’s character, a once-celebrated reporter named Steve Everett, behaves as if he considers himself catnip to the distaff. This too could carry a certain frisson, if the movie made us aware of how hollow that conceit is. Instead, the young women he hits on, even as they’re turning down his threadbare seductions, grin at him as if they’re flattered by the old rake’s attention. The actor had also, at that point, lost so much of the almost feline grace he’d exhibited in his prime that when he walks across a room you’re aware that the parts no longer move the way they once did. It happens to us all, of course, but most of us aren’t operating under the merciless glare of arc-lights and widescreen cameras. There’s some good acting here, however, especially by James Woods as Everett’s indulgent editor; Denis Leary, subdued for once as the supervisor itching for a reason to fire Everett; Lisa Gay Hamilton as the grieving wife of the accused; Diane Venora as Everett’s long-suffering mate; Hattie Winston as the grandmother of a deceased felon; Bernard Hill as a prison warden; Michael Jeter as a weasely, unreliable witness; Frances Fisher as an angry D.A.; and little Francesca Eastwood as Everett’s tiny daughter. As the condemned man, Isaiah Washington is astonishing. He’s so good, so sure-footed in his emotional responses to the insupportable, you wish the movie that surrounds him was as deep as his characterization; his reaction to seeing his young daughter for the last time is raw and unforgettable. True Crime isn’t a disaster by any means, but it’s sure an oddity.\n\nAny Given Sunday (1999) I’ve always thought televised football was at once stupid, loud, overlong and boring. Amazingly, it took the considerable and combined talents of John Logan and Oliver Stone to deliver an equally stupid, loud, overlong and boring movie about the game. There are two central stories, involving, primarily, a Miami franchise head coach (Al Pacino) and his struggle to hold onto his job and, secondarily, concentrating on a rising young star quarterback (Jamie Foxx) who first becomes an arrogant show-off and then must learn to be a humble team-player by the play-out. There are also sub-plots involving an aging team captain (Dennis Quaid) nursing a potentially debilitating injury and the team’s embattled owner and general manager (Cameron Diaz), and the characters include a duplicitous team physician (James Woods), a veteran linebacker with a cortisone addiction (Lawrence Taylor) and an egomaniacal sports reporter (the odious John C. McGinley, doing his usual overbaked caricature). Shall I go on? If all you want is two and a half hours of scabrous people and their petty problems and rivalries, or have always hoped to see a detached human eyeball in bloody close-up, Any Given Sunday is for you.\n\nW (2008)\n\nOliver Stone was, ludicrously, slanged in 2008 for not making George W. Bush more of a caricature, and for sympathizing with his central character. That succumbing to the former is the sign of a hack or a satirist (all too often the same thing) and that embrace of the latter is the primary job of a dramatist does not seem to have occurred to the partisans among Stone’s critics. To take on the first accusation: How much more may an artist caricaturize a man who is already a walking self-parody? Stone’s Bush, as written by the scenarist Stanley Weiser and enacted by the redoubtable Josh Brolin is, it seems to me, George W. to the life: Belligerent, untutored, ill-informed, appallingly ignorant — narcissistic in the proscribed macho manner of the Texas playboy who has seldom, if ever, heard the word “no” and been forced to comply with it. To address the second allegation: Although Bush as a man is not as complex as the 37th President of the United States, nor as essentially and tragically bifurcated, this indictment was also leveled at Stone in 1995 when Nixon premiered, and was no more legitimate then. Again, only a parodist or a creative hack reduces his subject to abject villainy. Was Shakespeare traduced for locating the humanity in both Caesar and Brutus? Do we not in part respond to Citizen Kane precisely because Orson Welles offered him in more than a single dimension? And while W is not as ultimately plangent, or as moving, as Nixon, it is certainly nothing to whinge or sneer at. It encapsulates and anatomizes its subject in sharp and often very amusing vignettes that hint strongly at the central emptiness within its eponymous subject. Is that, somehow, the same as bestowing laurels on him? The only area in which I think Stone errs is in his and Weisner’s conception of George H.W., and in their casting of James Cromwell, who neither looks nor sounds like the elder Bush. If any member of the dynasty depicted here deserves vilification, surely it is Bush Senior, that unrepentant liar, conscienceless CIA operative (who claimed, like Nixon, not to remember where he was on the day Kennedy was murdered) and un-indicted war criminal. Ellen Burstyn comes off much better as Barbara Bush, but then, the woman herself scarcely seemed to deserve the unholy brood she gave birth to. Richard Dreyfuss makes an appropriately serpentine Dick Cheney, alternately sneering and bullying. (Although he and Stone apparently differed on the characterization.) The always splendid Scott Glenn gives a good account of Donald Rumsfeld, Toby Jones provides a correspondingly fine embodiment of the Pecksniffian Karl Rove, and Stacey Keach is fascinatingly ambiguous in a role that was conceived as a composite of several of Bush’s spiritual advisors… whose collective failure with their charge is all too obvious and instructive.\n\nWall Street: Money Never Sleeps (2010) Interestingly, this sequel to the 1987 Wall Street is richer and more entertaining than its predecessor, at least until the wholly unnecessary — and utterly unbelievable — climax. The last-minute deus ex machina conversion of the merrily amoral Gordon Gekko rends the fabric of his character: Although he’s appalling, his actions have a unity that renders him whole; turning him into a penitent fairy godfather smacks either of studio interference, or a last-minute cowardice on someone’s part. Because we’re unsure of him through most of the picture, Michael Douglas becomes mesmerizing. And when, near the end, he reveals himself as wholly unchanged, the effect is both delicious and sick-making. It makes that sudden reversal a betrayal of the character, and of our apprehension of him. Shia LaBeouf is a more benign version of the Charlie Sheen character in the first movie (Sheen himself makes a cameo), although I think overall he’s a rather limited actor. Josh Brolin has a good role as LeBeouf’s nemesis, Carey Mulligan is permitted a wide range of emotional response as Gekko’s estranged daughter, Susan Sarandon has a few juicy scenes as LeBeouf’s mother, and Eli Wallach is as usual a deft delight as a high-rolling old financier. Allan Loeb and Stephen Schiff wrote the mostly (until that unfortunate climax) intelligent screenplay, Rodrigo Prieto provides some lovely cinematography, and Oliver Stone directs not as if he’s taken on an obligation but as though the subject is fresher with him now than it was 23 years earlier, proving that Thomas Wolfe’s famous dictum concerning staging a return is not a universal truth.\n\nSnowden (2016) One of the least seen of Oliver Stone’s important pictures, Snowden sits on the shelf with the writer-director’s explorations of American governmental power (JFK, Nixon, W.) and, like Nixon, is both intelligently written and surprisingly moving. Perhaps audiences in 2016 already thought they knew the Snowden story; if they were consuming the Western corporate media’s coverage of his announcement, they didn’t, and don’t. Stone and his co-scenarist, Kieran Fitzgerald, depict Edward Snowden as an exceptionally bright young man of conventional conservative bent, “patriotic” in the way of so many American youths who have incorporated the deliberate inculcation of their public schools, a passive press and all-too active governmental indoctrination into their view of the world. His gradual awakening to the means by which — and the lengths to which — his employers are able, and willing, to go to infiltrate every aspect of his fellow Americans’ lives, and his determination to expose both, form the core of the narrative. (The screenplay was based in part on The Snowden Files by Luke Harding. That Harding has since allowed the Clinton machine’s absurd claims of Russian interference in the 2016 Presidential election to unhinge him completely should, one supposes, not mitigate his former good work.) Joseph Gordon-Levitt is superb as the eponymous anti-hero, and however much one might deplore the reactive manner of Snowden’s thinking, Gordon-Levitt’s performance conveys the young man’s basic decency and kindness as well as his slow awakening in wholly explicable terms. It was the role many of us who have admired this gifted young actor since his sitcom years were waiting for, and it’s a genuine pity that so few have seen it, and that he received no major award nominations for it. Shailene Woodley is equally fine as Snowden’s girlfriend Lindsay Mills, as are the superb Melissa Leo as the documentarian Laura Poitras and Zachary Quinto as the irreplaceable (and un-repressible) Glenn Greenwald. Nicolas Cage plays a character suggested by the estimable former National Security analyst — and fellow whistle-blower — Bill Binney, and Snowden himself appears briefly at the end of the picture. Craig Armstrong’s musical score is a strong asset, as is Anthony Dod Mantle’s rich cinematography and the kinetic editing by Alex Marquez and Lee Percy. The ultimate willingness of one so young to leave behind his life, love and family in the furtherance of an ideal becomes quietly devastating, and for this, Stone is to be commended. Yet it is a measure of the contempt in which Oliver Stone is held by the government stenographers who now comprise the ranks of corporate journalism that a movie as vital and important as Snowden received far less press than a lumbering exercise like Any Given Sunday. And it is equally illustrative of where the American movie audience is now that Sunday was a hit domestically, Snowden a flop.\n\nBorn on the Fourth of July (1988) I missed this picture when it was new, owing partly to my perpetual aversion to its star, but had I seen it in 1988 I suspect I would have appreciated it more. I had attempted, a few years before, to get through Ron Kovic’s memoir, but was defeated by its grim and seemingly unremitting horror. Now that I have read it, Oliver Stone’s adaptation (written with Kovic) almost seems to affirm some of the criticisms leveled at his work as sensationalist and excessive. In the main I do not agree with the opprobrium with which Stone is so frequently assaulted, but Born on the Fourth of July all too obviously embodies those faults others — admittedly, and largely, his political opponents —invariably see in Stone. Kovic’s book is so vivid, incendiary and felt, it scarcely required embellishments like the wholly fictitious Kara Sedgwick character, or Tom Cruise’s romantic run-through-the-rain-to-the-prom. It most especially did not need the sequence in which he and Willem Dafoe (in, again, a role for whom there is no antecedent in Kovic’s life) roll around on the Mexican sand and argue over whose claims of baby-killing are the most true. Even such incidents as Kovic’s shattering his leg and nearly losing it are turned, by Stone, into vulgar, overstated show-pieces (he was merely exercising his useless limbs at home, not parading around in a demented attempt to prove he could walk) and when, at the climax, Kovic is beaten by cops at the 1972 Republican convention in Miami, Stone cheats fact by turning it into Kovic’s heroic last-stand when the reality — he was brutally assaulted by para-military creeps who, when they finally realized he was, as he’d been telling them, a wounded vet, behaved with shame-faced obsequiousness — was so much more inherently and honestly dramatic. Wouldn’t that make a better sequence than presenting Kovic as storming (or anyway, wheeling) back into the convention hall to “take” it, a cinematic fantasy that manifestly did not occur? That sort of phony uplift is contemptible, and beneath a man of Stone’s gifts. I will grant that the picture brings up a subject Americans do not like to address, and which Kovic’s book repeatedly rubs our noses in: The sudden emasculation of the sexually incapacitated. That such lifelong impotence is routinely visited on one so young is one of the great, unspoken tragedies of war. Cruise is, as usual, insufferably over-dramatic, an amateur actor who only knows how to perform when the scene calls for overt, hectoring anger. One of the few unadulterated pleasures of the picture is the performance of Raymond J. Barry as Kovic’s gentle, shattered father, unable to cope with the wreck his country has made of his child. There’s dignity in that, and quiet honesty. It’s something Born on the Fourth of July could use more of.\n\nLord Love a Duck (1966) George Axelrod and Larry H. Johnson’s determinedly strange adaptation of a little-known novel by Al Hine is the last thing in “mod” era outré. The great Roddy McDowall, nearing 40 but playing — somehow believably — 18 is Alan “Mollymauk” Musgrave, a young genius and idiosyncratic non-conformist, who plays everyone around him against each other (and themselves) in furtherance of the attainment of the vacuous desires of his unrequited inamorata Barbara Ann Greene (Tuesday Weld). Axelrod threw all of his bitterness at then-current California popular culture onto the screen, with results that are less riant than determinedly, even dementedly, weird. Thus we get health fads, psycho-babble and smother-love (all embodied by Ruth Gordon), drive-in religious services, physical culture, fly-by-night motion picture production, permissive educational policy (Harvey Korman, in the movie’s funniest performance, is the easily-manipulated, shame-facedly lecherous high school principal), the pathos of the almost-was actress as hopeless lush (Lola Albright as Weld’s mother), cliquish snobbery and, for good measure, repressed and guilty incestuous craving (Max Showalter, giggling guiltily as her father). It doesn’t really hang together, and it’s not nearly either as hilarious nor as poignant as Axelrod seemed to think it was, but it has cult status, and if you’re at all interested in what was happening to the movies in that uncertain period between buttoned-down suppression and full-scale candor, it demands a viewing. Interestingly, Axelrod intended us to hear McDowall screaming “Fuck you!” at his captors during the bizarre climax but was overruled. The shattering of that taboo had to wait another few years, for Robert Altman to include a football game ad-lib by John Schuck in his final cut of MASH.\n\nText copyright 2019 by Scott Ross\n\nBy Scott Ross\n\nContinuing my reluctant withdrawal from moviegoing, due to perpetual disappointment both with new work and with the new theatre audience — neither of which seems to be improving; indeed, the latter now infects every performance venue in the land — I saw only two pictures in a theatre last year… and they were from the 1970s and ‘80s. Additionally, the summer and autumn of 2018 were for private reasons exceptionally difficult for me, and entertainment was something I was able to devote very little time or attention to. Here’s to a much more movie-intensive 2019, whatever the venue.\n\nAnd herewith, the movies (and other video items) I did manage to see during the year recently passed.\n\nBOLD + Underscore Denotes very good… or at least, better than average.\n\n*BOLD + Underscore w/Asterik A personal favorite\n\n1. Older titles re-viewed on a big theatre screen\n\nThe Front Page (1974) Thanks to the Carolina Theatre in Durham I was able to add one more Billy Wilder picture to my list of his work seen on a big theatre screen, having missed this adaptation (by Wilder and I.A.L. Diamond) of the Hecht-McArthur perennial when it was first released. I have a complicated relationship with The Front Page: As an adolescent, influenced — as were so many of my generation — by Woodstein (and perhaps even more so by Carl Kolchak) I aspired to be a journalist. My interests eventually led me elsewhere, but that early appreciation of the Fourth Estate remains, even if it has now, as increasing numbers of people have begun to believe, become a fifth column. No play had a greater influence on popular American culture than this breakneck 1928 farce-melodrama; all the great newspaper comedies of the 1930s (especially those featuring Lee Tracy, who had the starring role in the play) flowed from its influential fount, and it absolutely cemented our image of the hard-bitten, ink-stained, wisecracking reporter… a figure now utterly obliterated by $30,000-a day neoliberal whores for the Establishment.\n\nYet as much as I admire it, I don’t find the play especially funny, except in the 1940 Howard Hawks variation His Girl Friday, and that’s due largely to the charm of Cary Grant, the fast-talking zing of Rosalind Russell and the fizz they spark off each other. (The final line is funny, but once you know it, it’s not one that elicits much of a laugh next time around.) The newsmen depicted are, in the main, appalling — less the bulwark of free-press democracy than shabby, cynical hacks more concerned with snappy headlines than with anything approaching truth. Some would no doubt argue that’s the point of the thing, but the authors clearly intended the play as a paean to the type, not a critique. That their star characters, Hildy Johnson and his unscrupulous editor Walter Burns, eventually manage to keep a corrupt Chicago mayor and sheriff in check is almost by-the-by; they wouldn’t do so unless their own liberty was at stake. That’s not to mention the casual bigotry of the piece: The word “nigger” is used by some of the reporters when “colored,” the general nomenclature of the time, not only would do, but did, elsewhere in the play, and the character of Bensinger is the piss-elegant pansy type prevalent in the ‘20s and ‘30s, all too easily ridiculed, and ridiculous. That Wilder and Diamond not only didn’t improve on that stereotype in 1974 but embellished it, making a cute young cub reporter (Jon Korkes) the object of Bensinger’s attentions, is a mark against their movie. An end-credits post-script reveals — presumably for a boffo laugh… which, sadly, it probably got from its contemporary audience — they’ve left the newspaper business and opened an antique shop together. Why not a florist’s while you’re at it?\n\nAs was their wont when adapting material by others, Wilder and Diamond made several changes to the original, and some critics were unreceptive; Wilder later admitted that he hadn’t understood how deeply venerated the play still was among members of the press. It’s a lively enough transliteration, with a fine performance by Walter Matthau as Burns, a good one by Jack Lemmon as Hildy despite his being too old for the role, and a controversial turn by Carol Burnett as Molly Malloy. (She famously apologized, to a planeload of passengers whose in-flight entertainment the movie was, for her performance.) Yes, she’s strident, but she’s also vulnerable, although not nearly so endearing as Austin Pendleton as the convict Earl Williams, whose imminent execution and eventual escape sets the plot — which Walter Kerr memorably described as “a watch that laughed” — in motion. Some of the scenarists’ alterations are pleasing, such as their stab at making the role of Hildy’s fiancée less thankless, and casting the young Susan Sarandon in the part. There is also excellent support by Charles Durning, Alan Garfield, Dick O’Neill and Herb Edelman (as Hildy’s fellow reporters), a blustery Vincent Gardenia (was there any other kind of Vincent Gardenia?) as Sheriff Hartman, a suave Harold Gould as the Mayor, Paul Benedict as the emissary from the governor, and wonderful old Doro Merande as the Criminal Courts Building custodian Jennie. As Bensinger, alas, David Wayne makes the worst of a bad job. While largely set-bound, the picture has a rich look to it, and there’s even a wild Keystone Kops-like chase through the Chicago streets. The opening credit sequence, set to a spritely Billy May rag (the production company was Universal, no doubt keen to have another Sting-like radio smash on its hands) and depicting the mechanized assembling of a newspaper from page one typeset to completed broadside, is a two-and-a-half minute gem.\n\n*The Changeling (1980) A beautiful rumination on the basic ghost story. Its admittedly thin screenplay is augmented by the usual marvelous George C. Scott performance, rare intelligence behind the camera — the director was the underrated Peter Madek — and a remarkably rich musical score (mostly by Ken Wannberg, with an assist from Rick Wilkens, anchored to an exquisite little music box theme by Howard Blake.) It’s one of those movies that has seen extremes of response: Dismissed, when not bludgeoned, by the critical fraternity on its 1980 release, it was restored and reissued in 2018 to ludicrous over-praise by people who can only deal in absolutes, and in an eminently dismissible interrogatory style: “Is The Changeling the most terrifying movie ever made?” The answer, even for partisans of the picture such as myself, is no. Not even close. But that hardly disqualifies the picture from being seen, and embraced, as a stylish — and surprisingly plangent — exercise in supernatural emotionalism that rewards repeated viewing. Thanks to my friend Eliot M. Camarena for suggesting this one to me a few years back.\n\n2. Documentary\n\nI.F. Stone’s Weekly (1973) Jerry Bruck, Jr.’s illuminating portrait of the fiercely idiosyncratic progressive journalist and, for many years, publisher of the eponymous newsletter still considered among the best, and most reliable, of progressive American news and opinion journals. Viewed courtesy of a kind friend who for the last several years has been my personal source for previously undiscovered (at least by me) cinematic gems.\n\n*Oliver Stone’s Untold History of the United States (2012) A staggeringly effective multipart examination of the dark underbelly of our history no American public school educator will touch: This one-time Republic’s century-plus evolution into the world’s most avaricious, and murderously dangerous, empire. Reactionaries, conservatives, liberals and their corporatist ilk will, if they sample it, no doubt sputter with impotent fury. And even for those of us who’ve been paying attention these last few decades, the revelations on display here will astonish and enrage. Yet even after 12 exhaustively documented hours* (and which feel more like two) neither Stone nor his co-authors Peter Kuznick and Matt Graham succumbs entirely to despair, and their Untold History is, finally, an impassioned call to arms that refuses to admit the defeat of essential values… provided we want them badly enough to fight for their reinstatement. “The record of the American Empire is not a pretty one,” they write. “But it is one that must be faced honestly and forthrightly if the United States is ever to undertake the fundamental structural reforms that will allow it to play a leading role in advancing rather than retarding the progress of humanity.” The Untold History is a vital step in facing that record. Now: Is there the popular will to make the changes we need?\n\nRush to Judgment (1967) This collaboration between the radical American documentarian Emile de Antonio and the Warren Report-debunking Mark Lane is in essence a 98-minute cinematic edition of the latter’s bestselling jeremiad of the same year. Lane’s is the research on which fifty years of responsible investigation into the assassination of John Fitzgerald Kennedy, and its subsequent and violent cover-up, are based. And, as nearly as I can determine, none of his central findings have in the intervening decades been proven incorrect.\n\nDirected by John Ford (2006 edit) Peter Bogdanovich revisited his lovely 1971 documentary/overview in 2006. Alas, his new interview footage (with Clint Eastwood and Harry Carey, Jr.), shot on video, lacks, as Joseph McBride correctly noted in his review, the “vibrant look” and “elegant mobility” of their earlier counterparts. Nor does Eastwood add anything of value to what was observed originally by John Wayne, James Stewart, Maureen O’Hara and Henry Fonda. Still, the prickly sessions with Ford himself, the representative sequences Bogdanovich lovingly culled from his pictures, and the original Orson Welles narration are evergreen, and certainly reason enough to revisit this very personal Valentine to perhaps this most American (in both the good and bad connotations of the word) of 20th century filmmakers.\n\n3. Video/Made for Television\n\nJohnny Mercer: The Dream’s on Me (2009) A pleasant, if not especially inspired, Clint Eastwood-produced TCM centenary portrait of our finest pop lyricist.\n\n*The Night Stalker (1972) No American made-for-television movie had a higher viewership in its time than this wonderful, and genuinely scary, adaptation by Richard Matheson of a then-unpublished Jeff Rice novel, and it has lost little of its power, or its humor, in the decades since. The inspired casting of, and performance by, Darren McGavin as pain-in-the-ass investigative reporter (remember them?) Carl Kolchak is half the fun, and the supporting roles are no less vividly limned: Simon Oakland as his dyspeptic editor; Ralph Meeker as that oxymoron, a helpful FBI agent; Elisha Cook, Jr.’s professional snitch; Peggy Rea’s cameo as a switchboard operator bribable with foodstuffs; Larry Linville’s no-nonsense coroner; Charles McGraw’s polished, slippery Chief of Las Vegas police; and Barry Atwater, cunningly revealed in stages by the director, John Llewellyn Moxey, as the vampire. There’s also a terrific score by Dan Curtis’ house composer Robert Corbert. The new Kino Blu-Ray restoration is mouth-watering, making The Night Stalker look as good as it must have when first aired. My favorite bit of Kolchakian rhetoric (“Now, that is news, Vincezo. News! And we are a newspaper! We’re supposed to print news, not suppress it!”) is one that has, thanks to Bill Clinton’s Telecommunications Bill of 1996 and the subsequent, nearly total corporate takeover of all news media, become even more sadly pertinent.\n\nThe Night Strangler (1973) This inevitable sequel to The Night Stalker is nowhere near as good as its record-breaking predecessor, and pointed up the major flaw of the subsequent weekly series: That supernatural crimes keep popping up wherever Carl Kolchak goes, and that only he believes in them. But it’s atmospheric as hell, what with its remarkable abandoned city beneath the streets of Seattle, from whence a new serial murderer emerges. And it has McGavin and Matheson (not to mention Simon Oakland) and that’s almost enough. It also has a feast of fine supporting roles embodied by Scott Brady, Wally Cox, John Carradine, Al Lewis, Margaret Hamilton, Jo Ann Pflug as Kolchak’s co-conspirator, and Richard Anderson as the urbane villain. Dan Curtis directed this one, and it’s also out in a sumptuous-looking Kino Blu-Ray.\n\nThe Incredible Mel Brooks: An Irresistible Collection of Unhinged Comedy (2012) If, as I do, you can’t quite imagine life without the mad, unbridled wit of Mr. Brooks, this Shout! Factory set is five discs of bliss. (Six, if you count the accompanying CD. Which isn’t to mention the nifty hardcover book.) The DVDs consist of Brooks’ television appearances, an uproarious reunion interview with Dick Cavett, a five-part Mel and His Movies documentary, shorts (including Brooks’ and Ernest Pintoff’s Academy Award-winning The Critic) and even episodes of Get Smart! (one show is enough to make us wonder why we loved it so much in the ‘60s), When Things Were Rotten (which is no better now than it was in 1974) and Mad About You. There is never such a thing as too much Mel Brooks but even if there were, this set would support Mae West’s contention that too much of a good thing can be wonderful.\n\n4. Seen a second… and final… time\n\nBuffalo Bill and the Indians, or Sitting Bull’s History Lesson (1976) Robert Altman and co-scenarist Alan Rudolph’s adaptation of Arthur Kopit’s trenchant, theatrical play Indians lost much in the translation, and the result is an occasionally diverting mess. A fine cast (Paul Newman, Joel Grey, Burt Lancaster, Geraldine Chaplin, Kevin McCarthy, Harvey Keitel) flounders in material too diffuse to have a discernible shape or point of view.\n\nVon Ryan’s Express (1965) Joseph Landon and the redoubtable Wendell Mayes adapted David Westheimer’s fascinating World War II thriller, and lost thereby much of what made it enthralling. To their credit, they kept the central figure’s prickly, unlikable character, and their star, Frank Sinatra, never winks at the audience. But the ending, which sacrifices Colonel Ryan on the altar of carnage, and which has no correspondence in Westheimer’s book, is wholly unnecessary. Mark Robson directed crisply, Trevor Howard makes a good foil for Sinatra, Vitto Scotti shows up as a train engineer, and the propulsive score by Jerry Goldsmith is one of his finest early works.\n\nThe Black Cauldron (1985) When I saw this animated Disney adaptation of Lloyd Alexander’s Prydain pentalogy on its release, I found it exceptionally impressive visually but largely uninvolving on a human level. In the intervening years I read, and fell in love with, Alexander’s entrancing series of novels for young people, so seeing the picture again was dispiriting. The novelist’s scope is Tolkeinean in its breadth, characterization and action, and 80 minutes is too skimpy a running-time to even begin encompassing it. But the books are as well deeply moving, something the movie never is, even with an illogical tear-jerker of a climax added on. The action takes in only a small set of events from, essentially, the first and second novels in the series, and the vast canvas of characters has been reduced to a mere handful, with one major figure (the Horned King’s tiny henchman Creeper) created out of whole cloth. Or ink-and-paint, as may be. One could go on at length, but why bother? Elmer Bernstein composed a splendid score, and young Grant Bardsley makes a properly questing Taran. The other voices include Freddie Jones, Nigel Hawthorne, Arthur Malet, Billie Hayes, John Hurt (as the Horned King) and John Byner, very fine as Gurgi. Among the familiar Disney names associated with the picture are Roy Disney (dialogue), John Musker and Ron Clements (story), and, in the animation department, Ruben Aquino, Hendel Butoy, Pixote Hunt, Glen Keane, John Lasseter, Rob Minkoff, Phil Nebbelink, George Scribner and Andreas Deja, all of whom would go on to far better things.\n\n5. New to Me: Meh\n\nBye Bye, Braverman (1968) This adaptation by Herb Sargent of Wallace Markfield’s 1964 novel, directed by Sidney Lumet, is richly populated with wonderful actors (George Segal, Jack Warden, Joseph Wiseman, Sorrell Booke, Phyllis Newman) and is on a certain level a vivid comic depiction of 1960s New York Jewish intellectuals. Sargent’s screenplay elides some of the archness of Markfield’s self-consciously (and, to my ear, anachronistic) “Jewish” dialogue, but, alas, is no more substantial, and its climax is even wispier. Godfrey Cambridge does have a marvelous scene as a cabbie, and Alan King gets a sly satirical sequence as a pompous Rabbi.\n\nThe Last of the Mobile Hot-Shots (1970) Another Lumet adaptation, by Gore Vidal this time, and of a Tennessee Williams flop (The Seven Descents of Myrtle) is the last word in weird. And although Robert Hooks is, as always, excellent, his presence as the mulatto bastard brother of James Coburn’s shabby white racist makes a hash of the action, since “Chicken” is supposed only to be somewhat dark-skinned, and not, as depicted here, obviously black. (The filmmakers also, un-shockingly, removed the Coburn figure’s homosexuality.) Lynn Redgrave gives a winning account of Myrtle, Coburn is fascinating, and the thing was shot, beautifully, by James Wong Howe. But it’s a curio merely, and a rather disagreeable one.\n\nThe Cowboys (1972) A real misfire. William Dale Jennings’ sumptuous novel (based on his own rejected original screenplay) was turned, by Irving Ravetch and Harriet Frank, Jr., into a crude, morally objectionable revisionist Western, the ambiguity of the original lost by the appalling placement of John Williams’ rousing “Cowboys” theme at a crucial juncture. John Wayne and Roscoe Lee Browne almost triumph over this unsavory mélange, unimaginatively directed by Mark Rydell. But Bruce Dern, as the chief villain, wallows in overstated ugliness.\n\nExecutive Action (1973) What might have been a galvanizing fictionalized critique of accepted wisdom on the assassination of John Kennedy was turned in its pre-production into an oddly tame affair. The original script, by the JFK assassination researcher Mark Lane and the playwright Donald Freed (cf., the Nixonian fantasia Secret Honor, filmed by Robert Altman) and later adapted by them into a compelling paperback novel, made no bones about CIA involvement in Kennedy’s murder. The subsequent screenplay, by Dalton Trumbo, muddies these waters to the point of nearly complete opacity: From which shadowy organization, if any, is Burt Lancaster’s team derived, if not directed? Your guess would be as good as mine. Lane and Freed also focus their narrative very effectively on two of the conspirators’ descending life spirals, both of which the picture eschews, to its ultimate detriment. That said, the sight of three old Hollywood lefties (Lancaster, Will Geer and Robert Ryan, whose last film this was) as sinister reactionary collaborators holds a sly kick.\n\nPlay Misty for Me (1971) Clint Eastwood’s directorial debut is a time-capsule movie in any number of ways: As a depiction of the artistic colony of Carmel, California (where Eastwood resides, and was once a bar-owner — and later the mayor) at the beginning of the 1970s; the hair, autos, interior design and clothing of the time; the emergent style of Hollywood filmmaking as practiced by bright young directors feeling their oats; and, perhaps most interestingly, as an example of a narrative form that would no doubt be greeted with howls and Twitterized hisses today. “What? A thriller with a knife-wielding psycho… and she’s a woman? How dare they? And Eastwood goes to bed with her and then dumps her just because she’s a little unstable? #Hatred for the Mentally Ill! Maybe it was men like him who made her crazy! So she stabs his housekeeper — does that make her a bad person? (His Black housekeeper. #Racist Director!) And then he punches her? #Abuse! #Sexist Pig!” Never mind that one of the screenwriters (Jo Helms, who also crafted the story) was a woman. (The other was Dean Riesner.) Much more to the point is that fact that Eastwood’s character, an FM jazz d.j., behaves in such a demonstrably stupid manner throughout the rising action. And his directorial flourishes date the picture far more than the actors’ clothing, reaching their nadir in a soft-focus romantic montage with Donna Mills, set to Roberta Flack’s “The First Time Ever I Saw Your Face,” which became a Top 40 hit. There is a nice sequence at the Monterey Jazz Festival, a narrative development obviously close to the director’s heart, Eastwood’s mentor Don Siegel shows up in a pair of nice bits as a barkeep and Jessica Walter does wonders with a character so frighteningly mercurial you wonder why her co-star doesn’t take out an immediate restraining order against her. But then, if he had, there might not be any movie. (I said he was stupid.) Bruce Surtees was the cinematographer.\n\nBroken Arrow (1950) This early attempt at being fair to Native Americans — the screenwriter, uncredited until decades later, was the then-recently blacklisted Albert Maltz — is overly earnest, stilted in its dialogue (which James Stewart’s opening narration hastens to warn us is due to the Apache language being spoken solely in English) and, while beautifully shot in color by Ernest Palmer, was directed with no distinction whatsoever by Delmer Daves, whose oeuvre only a confirmed Sarrisite could love. Jeff Chandler, whose stardom has always seemed to me one of American cinema’s great enigmas, is Cochise. The best one can say is that at least he doesn’t embarrass himself. Debra Paget is rather lovely as Stewart’s eventual Apache bride, and Will Geer, himself about to be blacklisted, has a small, showy role as an angry settler. Mickey Kuhn, who memorably played Montgomery Clift as a boy in the early part of Red River, also appears, as Geer’s son. Stewart, alas, has little to tax him histrionically until late in the picture.\n\nNight Passage (1957) I’ve seldom seen a good Western novel so thoroughly — and, to my mind, perversely and irresponsibly — ruined by Hollywood as what the makers of this one did to Norman A. Fox’s remarkable little book. But either the producer or the screenwriter (the redoubtable Borden Chase) removed the guts from Fox’s story, one that couldn’t have been more of a ready-made movie if it had been typed in screenplay format. A terrific picture could, and should, have been made from it, preferably in black-and-white, but neither Chase nor James Neilson, the ploddingly literal director, trusted what they had. There’s not even more than a few minutes’ worth of night in the damn thing… and that with a director of photography as certifiably great as William H. Daniels! Audie Murphy gives a good account of the nominal villain; you get the sense that he, at least, read the book. But Brandon deWilde, while game, is years too young for a role that should have been cast with an adolescent, and Dan Duryea is truly dreadful; the characteristic habit of his role is laughter, but each time Duryea breaks into it, the braying result is as phony as the backdrops the actors are framed against in the medium shots and close-ups. As good as James Stewart is in the lead, he’d have been twice as effective if more of Fox had made it onto the screen. Indeed, the only actor in Night Passage who’s a true breath of fresh air is Olive Carey, and it’s notable that her character, a wise, cheerful old muleskinner, wasn’t in the novel at all. The picture reaches its creative nadir in an added sequence that probably pained Norman Fox as much as, if not more than, what they took out of his book: A would-be comic brawl among querulous Irish laborers that is no funnier here than it was the many times John Ford attempted it, usually with Victor McLaglen. An extended sequence, on a moving train-car, provides the only real suspense in the picture: You keep looking at Stewart and deWilde, and those rushing waters far down below, and wondering how much insurance was issued on the actors.\n\n6. New to Me: Worth (or More Than Worth) the Trip\n\nFrom Noon ‘Til Three (1976) Frank D. Gilroy wrote and directed this delightful Rashomon-like parable, from his own ingenious little novel, which takes off from variations on what may have happened between a bank robber and a young widow during a crucial three-hour liaison. Charles Bronson and Jill Ireland are surprisingly charming as the lovers, and if the finale is less downbeat than the climax of the book its payoff is in its way no less pointed. Elmer Bernstein composed the delicious score, and the lyrics to his eponymous waltz are by Alan and Marilyn Bergman. (Bernstein and Alan Bergman appear on-screen as early Tin Pan Alley hacks, plugging the song.) Lucien Ballard added his usual luminous cinematography, and the Twilight Time Blu-Ray transfer makes splendid show of it.\n\nViolent Saturday (1955) A good crime drama depicting the planning of a bank robbery in a mining town that gets a lift from the performances of Stephen McNally, Richard Egan, Sylvia Sidney, J. Carrol Naish, Margaret Hayes, Tommy Noonan and Lee Marvin. Sydney Boehm wrote it, from a novel by William L. Heath, and it’s crisply directed by Richard Fleischer. With its small town full of adulterous dames, peeping Toms and kleptomaniac librarians, the picture suggests what might have happened had Richard Stark written Peyton Place. Charles G. Clarke provided vivid Technicolor cinematography, Hugo Friedhofer composed the taut and intelligently-spotted suspense score, and there’s a spectacular finale at a farmhouse owned by, of all people, Ernest Borgnine in an Amish beard and accent. Victor Mature, playing a man embarrassed that his son thinks he’s a coward, struggles manfully with a lousy part. He doesn’t overcome it, although he fares rather better with the villains.\n\nThe Crucible (1996) This excellent Nicholas Hytner-directed film of the 1953 Arthur Miller play about the Salem witch trials — and, in part, the playwright’s response to the House Committee on Un-American Activities — when seen in the years since the Democrats instigated a brand-new Red Scare on “evidence” no more substantial than that concocted by the terrified young Salemite Abigail Williams, carries with it a new and unavoidable metaphor: Hillary Clinton is Abigail.\n\nThe Landlord (1970) Hal Ashby’s directorial debut is a determinedly quirky take on what used, rather prettily in America, to be called “race relations.” The perennially under-rated Beau Bridges plays a wealthy ne’er-do-well who capriciously buys a Brooklyn apartment building, selfishly concerned only with refurbishing his own apartment and utterly unprepared for the wild array of his new black tenants, whom he plans to evict. The superb cast includes Diana Sands, Lee Grant, Pearl Bailey, Lou Gossett Jr., Mel Stewart and Robert Klein. Kristin Hunter wrote the novel on which the actor and playwright Bill Gunn based his cutting screenplay. Gordon Willis was the cinematographer.\n\nThe Public Eye (1992) Howard Franklin wrote and directed this beautifully photographed (by Peter Suschitzky) attempt at a latter-day, albeit period, film noir (always a fool’s errand) and basing the central character played by Joe Pesci on the idiosyncratic photojournalist Arthur Felling, aka “Weegee.” It doesn’t entirely work either as a character study or as a thriller, but it’s a highly original conceit, and Pesci, who has a tendency to repeat himself, is refreshingly restrained here. The always interesting Barbara Hershey also stars, and Stanley Tucci has a fine role as a hood with a conscience. Some of Wegee’s distinctive photos are featured, along with work by others.\n\nHombre (1967) One of several collaborations between Martin Ritt and the aforementioned screenwriters Ravetch and Frank, this one based on an Elmore Leonard Western. It’s an expansive movie, shot by James Wong Howe in widescreen and muted color, but doesn’t, finally, add up to a great deal. Paul Newman is the eponymous anti-hero, a taciturn young Caucasian raised by Apaches, and his performance is very nearly silent. It’s the kind of thing Steve McQueen made a fetish of, but that was due to his own well-deserved insecurities as an actor; you’ve only to picture any of McQueen’s defining roles with Newman instead, to comprehend the gulf that lay between them. Only a performer of Newman’s range and seriousness could really pull off the conceit, and he’s splendid here, as is the rather astonishing supporting cast: Frederic March, Diane Cilento, Cameron Mitchell, Martin Balsam, David Canary and, especially, Richard Boone. If not an ideal movie, it’s certainly an intelligent one.\n\nTom Sawyer (1973) Conceived and written by Richard M. Sherman and Robert B. Sherman and financed by, of all things, The Reader’s Digest, this musical variation on Mark Twain turns out to be a welcome, and very pleasant, surprise. Johnny Whittaker is Tom to the life, especially in the delightful fence-painting sequence; with his curly mass of strawberry hair and those half-attractive/half-ordinary features, Whittaker passes for a young Sam Clemens, which is who Tom is anyway. As Becky Thatcher, Jodie Foster (in only her third film appearance) is already poised and appealing; and Celeste Holm is the Aunt Polly of one’s fondest dreams, exasperated and warm in equal measure.
