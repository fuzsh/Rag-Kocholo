Vincent Louis George and Percival Arthur George in the business carried on by me under the style or firm of 'GEORGE & BRANDAY'. Sgd. Arthur George (Source: The Gleaner, Kingston, Jamaica - Monday, January 23, 1922)\n\nThe Gleaner, Kingston, Jamaica - Tuesday, January 24, 1922:\n\nTHE FUNERAL OF THE LATE MR. ARTHUR GEORGE\n\nThe funeral of the late Mr. Arthur George, J.P., head of the firm of Messrs. George and Branday, took place yesterday afternoon from his late residence, Ardenne, Hope Road, St. Andrew.\n\nQuietly and without any rush the veteran Shipping Agent was escorted to his last resting place at the Half-way Tree cemetery by a representative gathering of business and professional men of the city who had come to pay their last respects to the deceased gentleman.\n\n...... The Rev. H.G. Lovell, Rector of the Half-way Tree Parish Church, officiated.... (here follows a list of business men and women who attended).\n\nThe pall bearers were Messrs. V. L. George, P.A. George, Ewan Soutar, C.A. Squire, Arthur Williams and F.L. Casserley.\n\nAs a mark of respect to the deceased the flags of the various shipping offices and consulates were flown at half mast yesterday.\n\nMr. George's Mercantile Career.\n\nMessrs. George and Branday's office was closed yesterday as a mark of respect for the lat Mr. George. It must have been a sourced of gratification to him to see, within a few months of his death, the completion of a large and commodious concrete building on the firm's premises at the corner of Orange and Port Royal Streets, where Messrs. George and Branday's new office is located; and likewise of a concrete sea wall which greatly adds to the facilities for handing vessels and improves the wharfage accommodation.\n\nAs the deceased gentleman was also a pioneer in the development of trade between this island and Canada, it is pleasing to note that he lived to see his firm entrusted with the agency of the Canadian Pacific Steamship Service, which has just started a passenger and freight service between Kingston, Havana, Boston and St. John's, N.B. This is no doubt the well-merited recompense for the efforts of years.\n\nMessrs. George and Branday are one of the oldest Jamaica business houses, having been founded by the late Mr. Arthur George, in conjunction with Mr. J.W. Branday, on the 1st. August, 1879. On Mr. Branday's death in 1909, Mr. George became sole partner. The business will henceforth be conducted, under the old style and name, by the present surviving partners, Messrs. V.L. George and P.A. George, the sons of the deceased.\n\nThe late Mr. George (who was a correspondent of the National Board of Marine Underwiters of New York) was born in St. Thomas-in-the-East on the 19th. December, 1849. During his early business career he was associated with Mr. Simon Soutar and with Messrs. Davidson, Colthirst and Co. His demise is certainly a loss to the business community of Jamaica.\n\nThe Daily Gleaner, Kingston, Jamaica - Wednesday, February 8, 1922:\n\nThe Will of the late Mr. Arthur George has been lodged in the Supreme Court, and an application will shortly be made by his son, Mr. A.C. George, Solicitor, that it be admitted to probate. It is learned that the deceased has left estate valued at £55,000.\n\nExecutors of his Will were Rose Emily George (nee Branday) and Arthur Charles George.\n\nThe Gleaner, Kingston, Jamaica - Monday, June 5, 1922:\n\nTo All Whom It May Concern\n\nTake notice that owing to the decease of Mr. Arthur George, the business formerly carried on by him under the style or firm of \"George & Branday\" and latterly by Messrs. Arthur George, Vincent Louis George and Percival Arthur George will, as of the 1st. day of June 1922, be carried on by Messrs. Vincent Louis George and Percival Arthur George on their own account, and they, the said Vincent Louis George and Percival Arthur George will be responsible for all future transactions with the firm.\n\nAll amounts to the above-mentioned date due from the former firm, will be settled by the executors of the Estate of the late Mr. Arthur George.\n\nMessrs.

DUQUESNAY\n\nIt is with regret we record the death of Mr. Henry duQuesnay for many years secretary of the Jamaica Fire Insurance Association, and clerk in charge of the insurance department of Messrs. Harvey and Bourke, the well known solicitors of this city.\n\nOf a quiet, unassuming disposition Mr. duQuesnay, during the long number of years with which he was connected with Messrs. Harvey and Bourke, came in touch with quite a large section of the commercial community of Kingston and was greatly esteemed by all who knew him.\n\nIn the earlier stages of his career, Mr. duQuesnay intended to embark in the Holy Order of Priesthood, and left Jamaica for the United States along with the then Vicar Apostolic, the Very Rev. Fr. Porter, to study for the profession. After a few years he however, decided to change his choice and came back to Jamaica to enter upon a business life. In the course of his long career in business he was chiefly identified with the firm of Messrs. Harvey and Bourke, and only for a short break did he venture out in a drug store business, which he eventually gave up, and once again returned to Messrs. Harvey and Bourke to carry on in the insurance line.\n\nA son of the late Theodore duQuesnay and Mrs. duQuesnay the deceased whose illness was of brief duration - indeed almost sudden, for he was at work the previous day - will be deeply regretted. Upright and honest in his dealings, courteous and kind in his associations a true and devout Christian, his sudden call to eternal rest from the bosom of a loving family will be deeply lamented. Indeed he was up and about on Thursday afternoon when he mentioned to his better half that he had been feeling better and would be able to take a cup of tea and an egg. Alas, while it was being prepared and while sitting fully dressed at the table, the final call came. The spirit of a good soul had been transported to the realms beyond and his mortal remains laid to rest in the Roman Catholic Cemetery yesterday afternoon in the presence of a large gathering of relatives and friends whose floral tributes as well as their presence testified louder than words to the great esteem in which the late Mr. duQuesnay was held.\n\nMr. duQuesnay is survived by a widow, three sons and a daughter as well as seven brothers and many other relatives to whom we offer our deepest sympathy.\n\n-----------------------------------------------------\n\nWill of HENRY PERCIVAL JOSEPH LE MERCIER DUQUESNAY\n\nEntered Will Book No. 25, Folio 100?\n\nLodged Records Office August 12, 1930\n\nJamaica S.S.\n\nThis is the last Will and Testament of me Henry Percival Joseph Le Mercier duQuesnay of the parish of Saint Andrew, Insurance Clerk.\n\nI appoint my son Harold Aubrey Le Mercier duQuesnay of the parish of Saint Andrew, Clerk, to be the Executor of this my Will.\n\nI give and bequeath the sum of Sixty Pounds (£60-0-0) to the Saint Vincent de Paul Society for Charity to the Poor and I direct my Executor to pay over the said sum to that Society.\n\nAll the rest and residue of my Estate, real and personal, I give devise and bequeath to my Wife Eugenie Cephaline Le Mercier duQuesnay absolutely.\n\nWitness my hand this Seventh day of March, One Thousand Nine Hundred and Twenty Eight.\n\nSigned: H.

McNish's Bakery in Spanish Town.\n\n1919 - Vincent was the owner of McNish's Bakery in Kingston, along with the branch in Spanish Town.\n\n1921 - He was robbed of nine truck wheels. Two men were found guilty.\n\n1924 - In July of 1924, Vincent was in court being sued by D.P. Mendes for £175 due on acceptance drawn by defendant H.A. Maxwell and accepted by Vincent on September 3, 1920. In December 1919, Vincent was \"doing a very good business, the value of the bread made each week being over £800. He states that in December he was anxious to buy a motor lorry in connection with his business, and wanted £100 cash for this purpose. He mentioned this to the plaintiff who offered to lend him the £100. He went with defendant Maxwell to plaintiff's residence to borrow the £100, and then plaintiff told him he required a second name on the acceptance. DuQuesnay at first demurred to this, but finally called in Maxwell, who was simply a clerk in duQuesnay's office at £10 a month, and who signed the acceptance for £175 as drawer and duQuesnay signed as acceptor, and plaintiff handed over the £100 to duQuesnay. Maxwell never got a penny of the £100.\"\n\nIn September 1920 he own Mendes £84 on installments and didn't have the money to pay him. Mendes was threatening to sue him. \"Now, duQuesnay had given a bill of sale of his stock and premises, and it was of the utmost importance to him not to be sued, as if it came to the knowledge of the holder of the bill of sale he would exercise his power of seizure under the bill of sale (as indeed ultimately happened). duQuesnay consequently went to see the plaintiff along with Maxwell to try and persuade him to give time. He states that plaintiff absolutely refused to do so at first, but finally agreed to do so on condition that duQuesnay take a further load of £16 which with the £84 due the bill of Dec. 1919 would make up the sum of £100, and that the two defendants should give a second acceptance for £175 on similar terms..... duQuesnay states that he was forced to accept these terms, and as a consequence the acceptance of 3rd. Sept. 1920, upon which he plaintiff now sues, was made out and signed.\"\n\nMaxwell corroborated duQuesnay's story and both of them swear positively that no sum of £84 cash was paid on 3rd. Sept.\n\nMr. Justice Orpen accepted that the story of the defendants was a true account of what took place. \"The defendants have put in a counterclaim in which they ask for relief under the Usury Law of 1905\" Justice Orpen found that the plaintiff had power over the defendants and was charging interest on interest, etc. and in the circumstances \"I consider the transaction both harsh and unconscionable within he meaning of the Usury Law of 1905\". Mendes was awarded £28. 12/11 with costs (defendant had paid a further £71 to plaintiff prior to the court case).\n\n1926-27 - Vincent was Manager of the Valentine Bakery in Kingston, owned by Cecil Hope Paton.\n\n1948 - He has an ad in the Gleaner wanting to purchase £100 Jamaica Government Stock. His address is only given as Box 90, Kingston, telephone 3150.\n\n1949 - Vincent is a witness in a trial regarding radio fraud. At this time he is referred to as a \"radio technician\" at \"duQuesnay's Radio Shop\", living at 20 Sackville Road.\n\nMore About VINCENT IGNATIUS LE MERCIER DUQUESNAY:\n\nOccupation 1: 1907, Baker294\n\nOccupation 2: 1926, Manager of the Valentine Bakery, Jamaica295\n\nResidence 1: 1907, 12a Blake Road, Kingston, Jamaica296\n\nResidence 2: 1910, Red Hills Road, St. Andrew, Jamaica\n\nMarriage Notes for MARIE POUYAT and VINCENT DUQUESNAY:\n\nThe marriage register gives Marie Bertha Pouyat's surname as Sorapure - which is correct as she was by then a widow having previously married Linval Sorapure.\n\nWitnesses: Charles LeM. duQuesnay and Marie Sorapure.\n\nMore About VINCENT DUQUESNAY and MARIE POUYAT:\n\nMarriage: August 06, 1907, Kingston, Jamaica297\n\nChildren of MARIE POUYAT and LINVAL SORAPURE are:\n\n70. i.

Born in Kingston 1879. Son of the late Peter B. Desnoes and Mrs. Desnoes nee Malabre. After leaving school entered the mineral water business, and in 1903 started business on his own account which was destroyed by the earthquake in 1908, but was re-established at the present site, 157 Harbour St., Kingston.\n\nDESNOES & GEDDES\n\nTheir meeting was simple enough. One morning, two youngsters came upon each other in the offices of West Indies Mineral and Table Water Company in Kingston Jamaica. \"My name is Thomas Hargreaves Geddes,\" said the newcomer. The other smiled. \"Glad to make your acquaintance! I've been here a bit. I'm Eugene Desnoes.\"\n\nAnd so, for the first time, Desnoes and Geddes shook hands. Neither of them could have imagined that this would mark the beginning of an extraordinary partnership.\n\nA partnership that has lasted 82 years, and has given the world Red Stripe, The Great Jamaican Beer.\n\nYears later they each began their own soda companies and in 1918, they joined forces to form Desnoes and Geddes Company Limited. The company became well-established in making popular sodas and distributed the best imported liquors. But Desnoes and Geddes also shared what seemed then to be an impossible dream: to build a brewery to produce a Jamaican beer of international quality. It would be more than a decade before that dream would be a reality.\n\nIn 1927 Desnoes and Geddes announced the opening of the Surrey Brewery on Pechon Street in the heart of downtown Kingston. The first Red Stripe Beer-more like an ale, heavy and dark-was brewed a year later. The birth of Red Stripe would later be considered a milestone in Jamaican history. When the island gained independence from Britain in 1962, a columnist for The Daily Gleaner wrote \"the real date of independence should have been 1928, when we established our self respect and self confidence through the production of a beer far beyond the capacity of mere Colonial dependants.\"\n\nThe light, golden Red Stripe we enjoy today was first brewed in 1934, the creation of Paul Geddes (later Jamaica's first brewmaster) and Bill Martindale. So successful was the new Red Stripe that by 1935 Jamaica's Governor, in alarm, sent a dispatch to London warning: \"this local industry turns out a beer so excellent and at so cheap a price that the English beers are unable to compete.\" The answer was prompt: \"Tax local beer, but not British imports.\" A public outcry followed and the order was quietly withdrawn. It was only in 1940 that the British were able to levy an excise tax on the local beer and other goods since \"Jamaica would have to pay its share of the cost of World War II.\" But fate has a sense of humour. The same World War II brought large contingents of Canadian and American troops to Jamaica. Red Stripe sales soared.\n\nOver the years the business remained a family affair and the baton was passed on to Peter Desnoes and Paul Geddes. Like their fathers before them, Peter and Paul had big dreams. They envisioned a new, ultra-modern plant and they decided to gamble everything-selling some property and using deeds of others as loan securities-to buy land and begin construction of a plant which was to be the marvel of Jamaica. The old Surrey Brewery on Pechon Street was phased out in 1958 when the ultra-modern plant at Hunt's Bay went into operation. This was the most modern brewery in the Caribbean and with its capacity the horizons of Desnoes & Geddes widened considerably.\n\nThe next 30 years constituted an era of significant expansion for the company. Along with Red Stripe, the company had a remarkable portfolio of products including international favourites like Pepsi-Cola and 7-Up, as well as D&G Soft Drinks, Jamaica's best-loved sodas. Other major brands include: Heineken, Dragon Stout, Guinness Stout, McEwans.\n\nDesnoes & Geddes became a public company in 1970, and the company remained under the control of the Desnoes and Geddes families until 1993 when controlling interests were acquired by Guinness Brewing Worldwide (GBW).Guinness assumed management of the company and later sold the soft drinks division to Pepsi Americas. Today, the company's exclusive focus is on beer , and in addition to Red Stripe, produces Heineken, Dragon Stout, Guinness Stout and Malta.\n\nThat early morning handshake between Desnoes and Geddes has resulted in a legacy of innovation and excellence and is a statement of the remarkable spirit of Jamaicans.\n\nThe Daily Gleaner, Saturday, December 9, 1950 - Page 8:\n\nMR. EUGENE DESNOES, BUSINESSMAN DIES.\n\nDeath came to Mr. Eugene Peter Desnoes, businessman and sportsman at 6 0'clock yesterday evening.

They went to Morgan's Harbour where Mr. Chevolleau kept his motor-boat, and the party left there bound for Rackhams Cay.\n\nWhile Mr. Chevolleau and Mrs. Sutton-Brown were having a swim. Mr. Chevolleau noticed that the boat was drifting away, Mr. Barker having slumbered at the helm.\n\nMr. Chevolleau swam after the boat to awaken Mr. Barker, and then - a blank in the story.\n\nMr. Barker soon after awake, started the engine, returned the boat to the cay, and was shocked to find that Mr. Chevolleau was not there. Moreso was Mrs. Sutton-Brown when she realized that Mr. Chevolleau was not in the boat. They raced the motor for Morgan's Harbour, and there informed Mr. Tony Kelly and Mr. Peter McCaulay who were about getting on the Cay, that Mr. Chevolleau was missing. All started off for Rackhams Cay in search and about mid-way the distance they saw the body floating and being attacked by about three sharks.\n\nAt this stage Mr. Tony Kelly, who is a nephew of Mrs. Francis Chevolleau (Gwyneth Dorothy Desnoes) was about to dive into the water when he was restrained by Mr. McCaulay.\n\nThe sharks were beaten off and the body was taken from the water into the launch which speeded for Morgan's Harbour where Mr. Barker was landed. The boat then raced for the nearest landing point on the Kingston waterfront - the United Fruit Company's drydock to the west of the No. 1 Railway Pier.\n\nThe Police had been notified, and Dr. Eric Don hurried to the spot and pronounced Mr. Chevolleau dead. The Police then took charge of the body and it was removed to the mortuary.\n\nMr. Chevolleau is survived by his wife and two sisters, Miss Dolly Chevolleau and Mrs. Herbert Desnoes.\n\nFuneral services will be held at the Church of SS Peter and Paul, Matilda's Corner, this afternoon at 4:30 o'clock, and interment will be at the Calvary Cemetery, Lyndhurst Road.\n\nMr. Chevolleau was born in Kingston on October 19, 1906, son of the late Mr. Arthur Chevolleau, for many years organist of the Holy Trinity Cathedral, North Street, and Beatrice Blanche Henderson, his wife. The son attended St. George's College from 1917 to 1922, and was First Prizeman in 1919.\n\nOn leaving College he filled a post at Barclays Bank, Kingston, and next joined the Jamaica Co-operative Fire Insurance Company Ltd., which he served from 1924 to 1938. Then he joined the firm of Desnoes & Geddes. He married Gwyneth, a daughter of the late Mr. Eugene Desnoes, one of the principals of the firm, on December 10, 1932.
