        "text": "Lamoine - Dr. James E. Gallagher died on May 12, 2024, of Parkinson's related pneumonia. Born Sept. 20, 1940, in Woburn, Mass., Jim grew up in an Irish working-class community.\n\nHe never imagined going to college. His life changed when a high school teacher, recognizing his inquiring mind, earnestly insisted he apply to Middlebury College. Receiving a full scholarship for 4 years, he fell in love with Middle English, languages, folklore, and the life of the mind.\n\nAnd so began Jim's academic journey through graduate study at Indiana University, where he was awarded a Fulbright Scholarship for a year of research in Istanbul, Turkey, earned a masters degree in Folklore, and a Ph.D in Sociology.\n\nJim joined the faculty at the University of Maine in 1971, teaching Sociology and Honors for more than 30 years. Jim loved teaching. Beginning his classes assuring his students, \"There are no stupid questions,\" he challenged students to explore ideas and discover knowledge on their own, making learning a life-long endeavor.\n\nAt the beginning of his graduate study, Jim and Dolores O'Neill married. They began their family with their first son born in Turkey, followed by their second son upon returning to graduate school, and a daughter after arriving at UMaine. They divorced in 1981.\n\nIn time, Jim's path merged with his new partner's, Kathryn Gaianguest, and they carved out a life on their own iconoclastic terms. After both retiring from their UMaine faculty positions, they welcomed their blended family to their home they built on Great Ledge in Lamoine. Jim subsequently served on the Lamoine Planning Board for many years. The late onset of Parkinson's dominated his last years with exercise and study to understand the disease.\n\nA lover of Tullamore Dew, a pint of Guinness and the poetry of Seamus Heaney, the lilting cadence of Middle English language, a game of pool, and outlaw country music, Jim fully embodied the Irish soul.\n\nHe is survived by his wife/partner, Kathryn; his children: Frank, Sean, and Christine; Kathryn's children: Brian and Kasia; his grandchildren: Kate, Ian, Daniel, Finn, Fiona, Declan, Cooper, Payson, and Leo; cousin, Pat Michielutti; and niece and nephew, Margaret and Patrick Gallagher.\n\nA celebration of Jim's life will be held June 11, 2024, at 4:30 p.m. at the Lamoine Bayside Grange. In lieu of flowers, donations may be made in Jim's memory to: Rock Steady Boxing - Bold Coast, P.O. Box 1187, Mariaville Road, Ellsworth, ME 04605; or to Downeast Community Partners Transportation."
