        "text": "The Cranberries paid tribute to Dolores O’Riordan on what would’ve been the late singer’s 49th birthday.\n\nMembers of the Irish rock band took to social media on Sunday (Sept. 6) to honor the memory of O’Riordan, who died in January 2018. She was 46.\n\n“Happy Birthday Dolores, you’re in our thoughts and in our hearts, always,” the Cranberries’ Fergal Lawler, Noel Hogan and Michael Hogan wrote in a tweet.\n\nO’Riordan was found submerged in her bathtub at a London hotel at the time of her death. It was later determined that she accidentally drowned while intoxicated from alcohol.\n\nThe Cranberries split after completing a final album featuring vocals by O’Riordan.\n\nThe band plans to re-release its 1994 album, No Need to Argue, on Nov. 13 through Island Records/UMe. The remastered and expanded version will feature three B-sides (“Away,” “I Don’t Need,” and “So Cold In Ireland”) and 19 unreleased previously unreleased tracks.\n\nCheck out the Cranberries’ birthday tribute to O’Riordan below."
