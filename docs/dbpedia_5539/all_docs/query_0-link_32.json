        "text": "The Michael E. Busch Annapolis Library engraved brick pathway was funded by your donations to the library!\n\nA component of the Beyond Your Expectations: the Campaign for the Library, the pathway has over 1500 inscribed bricks that were installed in 2020. From the parking lot to the front entrance, the walkway is a testament to the community’s love for the library. Each brick has a unique inscription, whether a word, name, or phrase, which will continue to inspire for many years to come.\n\nThe listed brick engravings on this page are in the general location (top, middle, or bottom) that they appear in the pathway. They are not in order by row and bricks are located in even-numbered sections only. To search for a word or phrase in most browsers, use Ctrl F (Windows) or Command F (Mac) to open the \"Find\" box.\n\nPlease stop by the circulation desk at the Busch Annapolis Library to see the brick walkway key.\n\nSections: 2 - 4 - 6 - 8 - 10 - 12 - 14 - 16 - 18 - 20 - 22\n\nSection 2\n\nLocation Top: Germantown\n\nLocation Top: Homewood\n\nLocation Top: Community\n\nLocation Top: Association\n\nLocation Top: You can find magic Wherever you look...
