        "text": "With prominent cheekbones, luminous skin and the most crystalline green eyes of her day, Gene Tierney's striking good looks helped propel her to stardom. Her best known role is the enigmatic murder victim in Laura (1944). She was also Oscar-nominated for Todsünde (1945). Her acting performances were few in the 1950s as she battled a troubled emotional life that included hospitalization and shock treatment for depression.\n\nGene Eliza Tierney was born on November 19, 1920 in Brooklyn, New York, to well-to-do parents, Belle Lavinia (Taylor) and Howard Sherwood Tierney. Her father was a successful insurance broker and her mother was a former teacher. Her childhood was lavish indeed. She also lived, at times, with her equally successful grandparents in Connecticut and New York. She was educated in the finest schools on the East Coast and at a finishing school in Switzerland.\n\nAfter two years in Europe, Gene returned to the US where she completed her education. By 1938 she was performing on Broadway in What a Life! and understudied for the Primrose Path (1938) at the same time. Her wealthy father set up a corporation that was only to promote her theatrical pursuits. Her first role consisted of carrying a bucket of water across the stage, prompting one critic to announce that \"Miss Tierney is, without a doubt, the most beautiful water carrier I have ever seen!\" Her subsequent roles Mrs O'Brian Entertains (1939) and RingTwo (1939) were meatier and received praise from the tough New York critics. Critic Richard Watts wrote \"I see no reason why Miss Tierney should not have a long and interesting theatrical career, that is if the cinema does not kidnap her away.\"\n\nAfter being spotted by the legendary Darryl F. Zanuck during a stage performance of the hit show The Male Animal (1940), Gene was signed to a contract with 20th Century-Fox. Her first role as Barbara Hall in Hudson's Bay (1940) would be the send-off vehicle for her career. Later that year she appeared in Rache für Jesse James (1940). The next year would prove to be a very busy one for Gene, as she appeared in Abrechnung in Shanghai (1941), Waffenschmuggler von Kenya (1941), Tabakstraße (1941) and Belle Starr (1941). She tried her hand at screwball comedy in Das große Spiel (1942), which was a great success. Her performances in each of these productions were masterful. In 1945 she was nominated for a Best Actress Oscar for her portrayal of Ellen Brent in Todsünde (1945). Though she didn't win, it solidified her position in Hollywood society. She followed up with another great performance as Isabel Bradley in the hit Auf Messers Schneide (1946).\n\nIn 1944, she played what is probably her best-known role (and, most critics agree, her most outstanding performance) in Otto Preminger's Laura (1944), in which she played murder victim named Laura Hunt. In 1947 Gene played Lucy Muir in the acclaimed Ein Gespenst auf Freiersfüßen (1947). By this time Gene was the hottest player around, and the 1950s saw no letup as she appeared in a number of good films, among them Die Ratte von Soho (1950), Köchin gesucht (1951), Close to My Heart (1951), Schiff ohne Heimat (1952), Unruhe um Barbara (1953) and Die linke Hand Gottes (1955). The latter was to be her last performance for seven years. The pressures of a failed marriage to Oleg Cassini, the birth of a daughter with learning disabilities in 1943, and several unhappy love affairs resulted in Gene being hospitalized for depression. When she returned to the the screen in Sturm über Washington (1962), her acting was as good as ever but there was no longer a big demand for her services.\n\nHer last feature film was Drei Mädchen in Madrid (1964), and her final appearance in the film industry was in a TV miniseries, Scruples (1980). Gene died of emphysema in Houston, Texas, on November 6, 1991, just two weeks shy of her 71st birthday.\n\nBorn in Maisons-Laffitte on 5-5-1920, Andrée Debar grew up in the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg where she graduated from high school. Living in this tiny but bilingual country and having an English grandmother gave Andrée a definite advantage : being able to speak fluent French, German and English, to which she later added Italian by dint of working for Roman studios. Still in Luxembourg, feeling the urge to become an actress, she attended the Conservatory of Music and Comedy. Once in Paris, where she settled down after completing her studies, she continued on the same track, studying drama with Marcelle Géniat until 1949 when, thanks to Jean Cocteau, she was given the opportunity to be part a prestigious tour in Egypt. Cinema noticed her even before, and she made her debut as of 1940 in a short and as of 1946 in the feature film in two parts Le bataillon du ciel (1947). Her figure, willowy and elegant, was an asset but might not have been enough to make her stand out in the crowd of all those starlets wishing to make a plash in the movies. What attracted the producers, directors and talent scouts was her unusual - almost masculine - look. As a matter of fact she was at her best when the strange mix of femininity and masculinity in her were exploited to their full potential. She is fascinating in two films by the director who best captured her physical ambiguity, 'Jacqueline Audry' in Die Liebe gehört mir (1957) and Der Favorit der Zarin (1959). What a pity André Debar decided to quit acting after the latter film. She could have done more troubling things during the bolder 1960s and 1970s. But Andrée Debar turned to film production instead - until 1977. And after this date, she gave a final farewell to cinema, preferring to open an antique shop with her old friend Sophie Desmarets as her partner. When she died of Alzheimer's disease in 1999, Andrée Debar and her androgynous beauty were totally forgotten. She deserved better.\n\nThe less famous, but still undeniably talented, of the \"Marilyn\" sex symbols of the 1940s/'50s was born Marvel Marilyn Maxwell in Clarinda, Iowa on August 3, 1920 (she later began using her middle name professionally at the suggestion of Louis B. Mayer). As a teenager, she worked as an usher at the Rialto Theater in Fort Wayne, Indiana, and later as a radio singer.\n\nIn 1942, Maxwell signed a contract with Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer, appearing on such radio shows as \"The Abbott and Costello Show\", \"Beat the Band\", and \"Stars Over Hollywood\". That same year, she made her movie debut in the star-studded World War II propaganda film Stand by for Action (1942). She went on to star in such popular movies of the 1940s/50s as Nacht der tausend Sterne (1943), Abenteuer im Harem (1944), Zwischen Frauen und Seilen (1949), Ein charmanter Flegel (1950), The Lemon Drop Kid (1951) (in which she introduced the carol \"Silver Bells\"), and 5 auf einen Streich (1958). Throughout World War II, and later the Korean War, she accompanied three-time co-star (and off-screen lover) Bob Hope on USO tours to entertain troops.\n\nThroughout the 1950s, Maxwell directed her focus to television, with guest appearances on such series as The Colgate Comedy Hour (1950), General Electric Theater (1953), The Red Skelton Show (1951), The Tennessee Ernie Ford Show (1956), and Playhouse 90 (1956). This continued into the '60s, as Maxwell appeared on Wagon Train (1957), Make Room for Daddy (1953), Amos Burke (1963), The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson (1962), and The Bob Hope Show (1950), and even game shows such as I've Got a Secret (1952) and Pantomime Quiz (1947). Her most prominent part in this period was that of diner owner Grace Sherwood on Bus Stop (1961), a series she left after one season after becoming bored of \"doing nothing but pour a second cup of coffee and point the way to the men's room\".\n\nMaxwell was married three times - to actor John Conte, restaurateur Anders Nylund McIntyre, and producer Jerry Davis - each marriage ending in divorce. She had one son with Davis, Matthew (b. 1956). On March 20, 1972, 15 year-old Matthew returned home from school, only to find his mother dead from an apparent heart attack. Maxwell was 51 at the time of her death.\n\nIn America, the early performing arts accomplishments of young Maureen FitzSimons (who we know as Maureen O'Hara) would definitely have put her in the child prodigy category. However, for a child of Irish heritage surrounded by gifted parents and family, these were very natural traits. Maureen made her entrance into this caring haven on August 17, 1920, in Ranelagh (a suburb of Dublin), Ireland. Her mother, Marguerita Lilburn FitzSimons, was an accomplished contralto. Her father, Charles FitzSimons, managed a business in Dublin and also owned part of the renowned Irish soccer team \"The Shamrock Rovers.\" Maureen was the second of six FitzSimons children - Peggy, Florrie, Charles B. Fitzsimons, Margot Fitzsimons and James O'Hara completed this beautiful family.\n\nMaureen loved playing rough athletic games as a child and excelled in sports. She combined this interest with an equally natural gift for performing. This was demonstrated by her winning pretty much every Feis award for drama and theatrical performing her country offered. By age 14 she was accepted to the prestigious Abbey Theater and pursued her dream of classical theater and operatic singing. This course was to be altered, however, when Charles Laughton, after seeing a screen test of Maureen, became mesmerized by her hauntingly beautiful eyes. Before casting her to star in Riff-Piraten (1939), Laughton and his partner, Erich Pommer, changed her name from Maureen FitzSimons to \"Maureen O'Hara\" - a bit shorter last name for the marquee.\n\nUnder contract to Laughton, Maureen's next picture was to be filmed in America (Der Glöckner von Notre Dame (1939)) at RKO Pictures. The epic film was an extraordinary success and Maureen's contract was eventually bought from Laughton by RKO. At 19, Maureen had already starred in two major motion pictures with Laughton. Unlike most stars of her era, she started at the top, and remained there - with her skills and talents only getting better and better with the passing years.\n\nMaureen has an enviable string of all-time classics to her credit that include the aforementioned \"The Hunchback of Notre Dame,\" So grün war mein Tal (1941), Das Wunder von Manhattan (1947), Belvedere räumt auf (1948), Der Sieger (1952), and Die Vermählung ihrer Eltern geben bekannt (1961). Add to this the distinction of being voted one of the five most beautiful women in the world and you have a film star who was as gorgeous as she was talented.\n\nAlthough at times early in her career Hollywood didn't seem to notice, there was much more to Maureen O'Hara than her dynamic beauty. She not only had a wonderful lyric soprano voice, but she could use her inherent athletic ability to perform physical feats that most actresses couldn't begin to attempt, from fencing to fisticuffs. She was a natural athlete.\n\nIn her career Maureen starred with some of Hollywood's most dashing leading men, including Tyrone Power, John Payne, Rex Harrison, James Stewart, Henry Fonda, Brian Keith, Sir Alec Guinness and, of course, her famed pairings with \"The Duke\" himself, John Wayne. She starred in five films with Wayne, the most beloved being Der Sieger (1952).\n\nIn addition to famed director John Ford, Maureen was also fortunate to have worked for some other great directors in the business: Alfred Hitchcock, William Dieterle, Henry Hathaway, Henry King, Jean Renoir, John M. Stahl, William A. Wellman, Frank Borzage, Walter Lang, George Seaton, George Sherman, Carol Reed, Delmer Daves, David Swift, Andrew V. McLaglen and Chris Columbus.\n\nIn 1968 Maureen found much deserved personal happiness when she married Charles Blair. Gen. Blair was a famous aviator whom she had known as a friend of her family for many years. A new career began for Maureen, that of a full-time wife. Her marriage to Blair, however, was again far from typical. Blair was the real-life version of what John Wayne had been on the screen. He had been a Brigadier General in the Air Force, a Senior Pilot with Pan American, and held many incredible record-breaking aeronautic achievements. Maureen happily retired from films in 1973 after making the TV movie Das letzte Wort hat Tilby (1973) (which on the prestigious Peabody Award for Excellence) with Henry Fonda. With Blair, Maureen managed Antilles Airboats, a commuter sea plane service in the Caribbean. She not only made trips around the world with her pilot husband, but owned and published a magazine, \"The Virgin Islander,\" writing a monthly column called \"Maureen O'Hara Says.\"\n\nTragically, Charles Blair died in a plane crash in 1978. Though completely devastated, Maureen pulled herself together and, with memories of ten of the happiest years of her life, continued on. She was elected President and CEO of Antilles Airboats, which brought her the distinction of being the first woman president of a scheduled airline in the United States.\n\nFortunately, she was coaxed out of retirement several times - once in 1991 to star with John Candy in Mama, ich und wir zwei (1991) and again, in 1995, in a made-for-TV movie, Der Ruf des Engels (1995) on CBS. In the spring of 1998, Maureen accepted the second of what would be three projects for Polson Productions and CBS: Cab to Canada (1998) - and, in October, 2000, The Last Dance (2000).\n\nOn St. Patrick's Day in 2004, she published her New York Times bestselling memoir, 'Tis Herself, co-authored with her longtime biographer and manager Johnny Nicoletti.\n\nOn November 4, 2014 Maureen was honored by a long overdue Oscar for \"Lifetime Achievement\" at the annual Motion Picture Arts and Sciences Governors Awards.\n\nMaureen O'Hara was absolutely stunning, with that trademark red hair, dazzling smile and those huge, expressive eyes. She has fans from all over the world of all ages who are utterly devoted to her legacy of films and her persona as a strong, courageous and intelligent woman.\n\nFrance's major sex siren of the early 50s, this lesser-remembered post-war French dish pre-dated bombshell Brigitte Bardot by a few years. Martine was born Marie-Louise (Maryse) Jeanne Nicholle Mourer on May 16, 1920, but little is known of her childhood. A chance meeting with comedian André Luguet steered her towards a career in the theatre. Trained by René Simon, she made her 1940 stage debut with \"Phedre\" billed as Maryse Arley.\n\nIn unbilled film parts from 1941, she subsequently caught the eye of Henri-Georges Clouzot who hired her for an upcoming film with the working title of \"The Cat,\" based on the novel by Colette, but the project was scrapped. Nevertheless, she did attract attention in the movie La ferme aux loups (1943) (Wolf Farm), which takes advantage of her photogenic beauty and ease in front of the camera despite a limited acting ability.\n\nA pin-up goddess and support actress throughout the 40s, Martine also appeared on the stage of the Theater of the Renaissance. A torrid affair with actor Georges Marchal, who was married to actress Dany Robin at the time, ended disastrously and she attempted suicide by taking an alcohol/drug overdose and throwing herself into the Seine River. She was saved by a taxi driver who accompanied her there. Ironically, the unhappy details surrounding her suicide attempt renewed the fascination audiences had with Martine up until that time. In 1949, she married her first husband, former American actor-turned-restaurateur Stephen Crane, who was once married to Lana Turner.\n\nContinuing on with post-war French filming, she co-starred in such movies as Bifur 3 (1945), L'extravagante mission (1945), Trente et quarante (1946), Voyage surprise (1947), Les souvenirs ne sont pas à vendre (1948), Je n'aime que toi... (1949), Une nuit de noces (1950), the title role in Im Anfang war nur Liebe (1951) and Liebenswerte Frauen? (1952). She scored her first box office blockbuster hit with the French Revolution epic Mein Leben für die Liebe (1953). Without a doubt, the success was prompted by her semi-nude scenes and taunting, kittenish sexuality.\n\nFrom there she was off and running. Her film romps were done tastefully with an erotic twinge of innocence and gentle sexuality plus an occasional bubble bath thrown in as male bait. Her array of costumed teasers included the title role in Lukrezia Borgia (1953), as Lysistrata Liebe, Frauen und Soldaten (1954), Der Skandal (1954), the title role in Madame Dubarry (1954), the title role in Nana (1955), Das Tagebuch des Mister Thompson (1955), the title role in Lola Montez (1955) and Ihr schlechter Ruf (1956). Several of the above-mentioned films were guided and directed by her second husband Christian-Jaque, her husband from 1954 to 1959. They later divorced due to professional conflicts and long separations.\n\nA true feast for the eyes and one of the most beautiful actresses of her time, Martine tried to branch out internationally in films in the late 1950s. Unfortunately, Bardot had already taken over the top French sex goddess pedestal and Martine's fan base diminished. She co-starred with Van Johnson in the crime drama Operation Tiger (1957), but it was met with indifference. She immediately returned to French/Italian films Nathalie (1957), Nächte auf Tahiti (1958), Die erste Nacht (1959), Vor uns die Hölle (1959) and Nathalie spielt Geheimagentin (1959).\n\nProblems with substance abuse and a severe accident severely curtailed her career in the 1960's. She continued with such films as Austerlitz - Glanz einer Kaiserkrone (1960) (as Empress Josephine), plus Eines Abends am Strand (1961), Der Herr mit den Millionen (1961) and I Don Giovanni della Costa Azzurra (1962). She made her last film in 1963, which was released four years later as Hell Is Empty (1967).\n\nDepressed, Martine turned alarmingly reclusive as a third marriage to French doctor Andre Rouveix also soured by 1962. One last marriage to fourth husband Mike Eland, an English businessman and friend of first hubby Steve Crane, seemed hopeful, but on February 6, 1967, Martine died of cardiac arrest at age 46 in the bathroom of a hotel in Monaco. Her husband discovered her. Newspapers hinted at a possible drug overdose but nothing was ever proven. She was buried in the cemetery of Cannes.\n\nVirginia Clara Jones was born on November 30, 1920 in St. Louis, Missouri, the daughter of a newspaper reporter and his wife. The family had a rich heritage in the St. Louis area: her great-great-great-grandfather served in the American Revolution and later founded the city of East Saint Louis, Illinois, located right across the Mississippi River from its namesake. Virginia was interested in show business from an early age. Her aunt operated a dance studio and Virginia began taking lessons at the age of six. After graduating from high school in 1937, she became a member of the St. Louis Municipal Opera before she was signed to a contract by Samuel Goldwyn after being spotted by an MGM talent scout during a Broadway revue. David O. Selznick gave her a screen test, but decided she wouldn't fit into films. Goldwyn, however, believed that her talent as an actress was there and cast her in a small role in 1943's Jack London (1943). She later had a walk-on part in Follies Girl (1943) that same year. Believing there was more to her than her obvious ravishing beauty, producers thought it was time to give her bigger and better roles. In 1944 she was cast as Princess Margaret in Das Korsarenschiff (1944), with Bob Hope and a year later appeared as Ellen Shavley in Mein zauberhafter Bruder (1945). Her popularity increasing with every appearance, Virginia was cast in two more films in 1946, Der Bub von Brooklyn (1946), with Danny Kaye, and Die besten Jahre unseres Lebens (1946), with Dana Andrews, and received good notices as Andrews' avaricious, unfaithful wife. Her roles may have been coming in slow, but with each one her popularity with audiences rose. She finally struck paydirt in 1947 with a plum assignment in the well-received Das Doppelleben des Herrn Mitty (1947) as Rosalind van Hoorn. That same year she married Michael O'Shea and would remain with him until his death in 1973 (the union produced a daughter, Mary Catherine, in 1953). She got some of the best reviews of her career in James Cagney's return to the gangster genre, Maschinenpistolen (1949), as Verna, the scheming, cheating wife of homicidal killer Cody Jarrett (Cagney). The striking beauty had still more plum roles in the 1950s. Parts in Gesetzlos (1950), She's Working Her Way Through College (1952) and Flucht aus Schanghai (1953) all showed she was still a force to be reckoned with. As the decade ended, Virginia's career began to slow down. She had four roles in the 1960s and four more in the following decade. Her last role was as Lucia in 1997's The Man Next Door. She died on January 17, 2005.\n\nEnigmatic, dark-haired foreign import Alida Valli was dubbed \"The Next Garbo\" but didn't live up to postwar expectations despite her cool, patrician beauty, remote allure and significant talent. Born in Pola, Italy (now Croatia), on May 3, 1921, the daughter of a Tridentine journalist and professor and an Istrian homemaker, she studied dramatics as a teen at the Motion Picture Academy of Rome and Centro Sperimentale di Cinematografia before snaring bit roles in such films as Il cappello a tre punte (1935) [\"The Three-Cornered Hat\"] and I due sergenti (1936) [\"The Two Sergeants\"]. She made a name for herself in Italy during WWII playing the title role in Manon Lescaut (1940), won a Venice Film Festival award for Piccolo mondo antico (1941) [\"Little Old World\"] and was a critical sensation in Noi vivi (1942) [\"We the Living\"]. She briefly abandoned her career, however, in 1943, refusing to appear in what she considered fascist propaganda, and was forced into hiding. The next year she married surrealist painter/pianist/composer Oscar De Mejo. They had two children, and one of them, Carlo De Mejo, became an actor. She divorced in 1955, then she came back to Italy,\n\nFollowing her potent, award-winning work in the title role of Eugenia Grandet (1946), she was discovered and contracted by David O. Selznick to play the murder suspect Maddalena Paradine in Alfred Hitchcock's Der Fall Paradin (1947). She was billed during her Hollywood years simply as \"Valli,\" and Selznick also gave her top femme female billing in Carol Reed's classic film noir Der dritte Mann (1949), but for every successful film--such as the ones previously mentioned--she experienced such failures as Die Glocken von Coaltown (1948), and audiences stayed away. In 1951 she bid farewell to Hollywood and returned to her beloved Italy. In Europe again, she was sought after by the best directors. Her countess in Luchino Visconti's Sehnsucht (1954) was widely heralded, and she moved easily from ingénue to vivid character roles. Later standout films encompassed costume dramas as well as shockers and had her playing everything from baronesses to grandmothers in such films as Augen ohne Gesicht (1960) [\"Eyes Without a Face\"], Jacky, wer bist du? (1960), Edipo Re - Bett der Gewalt (1967) [\"Oedipus Rex\"], Tendre Dracula (1974), 1900 (1976), Suspiria: In den Krallen des Bösen (1977), La luna (1979), Feuertanz - Horror Infernal (1980), Aspern (1982), Ein Sommer am See (1995) and, her most recent, Semana Santa (2001).\n\nErnestine Jane Geraldine Russell was born on June 21, 1921, in Bemidji, Minnesota.\n\nHer father was a United States Army lieutenant and her mother had been a student of drama and an actress with a traveling troupe.\n\nOnce Mr. Russell was mustered out of the service, the family took up residence in Canada but moved to California when he found employment there.\n\nThe family was well-to-do and although Jane was the only girl among four brothers, her mother saw to it that she took piano lessons. In addition to music, Jane was interested in drama much as her mother had been and participated in high school stage productions.\n\nUpon graduation, Jane took a job as a receptionist for a doctor who specialized in foot disorders. Although she had originally planned on being a designer, her father died, and she had to go to work to help the family.\n\nJane modeled on the side and was very much sought-after especially because of her figure.\n\nShe managed to save enough money to go to drama school, with the urging of her mother. She was signed by Howard Hughes for his production of Geächtet (1943) in 1941, the film that was to make Jane famous. The film was not a classic by any means but was geared through its marketing to show off Jane's ample physical assets rather than acting abilities. Although the film was made in 1941, it was not released until two years later and then only on a limited basis due to the way the film portrayed Jane's assets. It was hard for the flick to pass the censorship board. Finally, the film gained general release in 1946. The film was a smash at the box office.\n\nJane did not make another film until 1945 when she played Joan Kenwood in Young Widow (1946). She had signed a seven-year contract with Hughes, and it seemed the only films he would put her in were those that displayed Jane in a very flattering light due to her body. Films such as Ein Satansweib (1951) and Die Spielhölle von Las Vegas (1952) did nothing to highlight her true acting abilities. The pinnacle of her career was in Blondinen bevorzugt (1953) as Dorothy Shaw, with Marilyn Monroe. This film showed Jane's comedic side very well. Jane did continue to make films throughout the 1950s, but the films were at times not up to par, particularly with Jane's talents being wasted in forgettable movies to show off her sexy side. Films such as So liebt man in Paris (1955) and Bungalow der Frauen (1956) did do Jane's justice and were able to show exactly the fine actress she was.\n\nAfter Traum in Pink (1957) (a flop), Jane took a hiatus from films, to dabble a little in television, returning in 1964 to film Bezwinger des Todes (1964). Unfortunately, the roles were not there anymore as Jane appeared in only four pictures during the entire decade of the 1960s. Her last film of the decade was Engel der Hölle (1967). After three more years away from the big screen, she returned to make one last film called McGee, der Tiger (1970).\n\nHer last major appearance before the public was in the 1970s when Jane was a spokesperson for Playtex bras.\n\nHad Jane not been wasted during the Hughes years, she could have been a bigger actress than what she was allowed to show.\n\nJane Russell died at age 89 of respiratory failure on February 28, 2011, in Santa Maria, California.\n\nBorn Deborah Jane Trimmer in Glasgow, Scotland in 1921, she was the daughter of a soldier who had been gassed in World War I. A shy, insecure child, she found an outlet for expressing her feelings in acting. Her aunt, a radio star, got her some stage work when she was a teenager, and she came to the attention of British film producer Gabriel Pascal, who cast her in his film version of George Bernard Shaw's \"Major Barbara\" (Major Barbara (1941)) and Love on the Dole (1941). She quickly became a star of the British cinema, playing such diverse roles as the three women in Leben und Sterben des Colonel Blimp (1943) and the nun in Die schwarze Narzisse (1947).\n\nIn 1947, she \"crossed the pond\" to Hollywood and came to MGM, where she found success in films like Der Windhund und die Lady (1947), Edward, mein Sohn (1949) and Quo vadis? (1951). After a while, however, she tired of playing prim-and-proper English ladies, so she made the most of the role of the adulteress who romps on the beach with Burt Lancaster in Verdammt in alle Ewigkeit (1953). The film was a success, and Kerr received her second Oscar nomination. She also achieved success on the Broadway stage in \"Tea and Sympathy\", reprising her role in the 1956 film version of the same name. (Anders als die anderen (1956)). That same year she played one of her best-remembered screen roles, \"Mrs. Anna\" in Der König von Siam (1956). More success followed in Der Seemann und die Nonne (1957), Die große Liebe meines Lebens (1957), Getrennt von Tisch und Bett (1958), Der endlose Horizont (1960), Schloss des Schreckens (1961) and Die Nacht des Leguan (1964).\n\nIn 1968, she quit movies, appalled by the explicit sex and violence of the day. After some stage and TV work in the 1970s and 1980s and swan song performances in The Assam Garden (1985) and Hold the Dream (1986), she retired from acting altogether. Kerr holds the record for the most Academy Award nominations for Best Actress without a win (six), but that was made up for in 1994, when she was given an Honorary Oscar for her screen achievements.\n\nMinor league singer/actress Gale Robbins was a knockout-looking hazel-eyed redhead who made a modest dent in post-war Hollywood films. Born Betty Gale Robbins in Chicago, Illinois (some say Mitchell, Indiana) on May 7, 1921, she was the eldest of five daughters of Arthur E., a doctor, and Blanche Robbins, and educated at Chicago's Jennings Seminary at Aurora, Illinois and Flower Tech. Gale had a natural flair for music and appeared in glee clubs and church choirs in the early days. She graduated from her Chicago high school in 1939.\n\nShe started out in entertainment as a model for the Vera Jones Modeling School in Chicago, but her singing talents soon took over. Signed by a talent agency, she sang with Phil Levant's outfit in 1940 and later teamed with some male singers for a swing band that called themselves \"The Duchess and Her Dukes.\" She went on to work with some of the top radio and live 'big bands' of that era including the Jan Garber and Hal Kemp orchestras, her best showcase was working for Art Jarrett in 1941 when he took over Kemp's band.\n\n20th Century-Fox caught sight of this slim looker while she was singing for 'Ben Bernie (I)'s outfit and was quickly signed her up, her first film being the pleasant time-filler In the Meantime, Darling (1944). A semi-popular cheesecake pin-up, Gale appeared on the cover of \"Yank, The Army Weekly\" in 1944, was heard on radio, and toured with Bob Hope in Europe the next year. Her post-war parts, mostly sultry second leads, were typically lightweight in nature. She was often lent out to other studios and not always in a singing mode. Gale's better known film work includes Race Street (1948), Tänzer vom Broadway (1949), Drei kleine Worte (1950), Seine Frau hilft Geld verdienen (1950) and Schwere Colts in zarter Hand (1953).\n\nGale went on to host the Hollywood House (1949) and also appeared on The Colgate Comedy Hour (1950) in 1951. In the late 50s the gal with the smooth and sexy vocal style released an easy-listening album (\"I'm a Dreamer\") for the Vik Label backed by Eddie Cano & His Orchestra. She covered such standards as \"Them There Eyes\" and \"What Is This Thing Called Love.\" After her final film appearance in Die Kanaille von Kansas (1958) and a few additional TV parts on such programs as \"Bourbon Street Beat,\" \"77 Sunset Strip,\" \"The Untouchables,\" \"Perry Mason\" and \"Mister Ed,\" Gale phased out her career to focus full-time on raising her family.\n\nMarried to her high school sweetheart Robert Olson in November of 1943 while he was serving in the Air Force, her husband turned to construction engineering as a career and they had two children. After her 47-year-old husband was tragically killed on February 4, 1967, in a building accident, a distraught Gale, left the States for a time with her two daughters, and decided to make a transatlantic comeback of sorts appearing in nightclubs in Japan and the Orient. She later was glimpsed in the film Jede Stimme zählt (1972) and appeared on stage in Stephen Sondheim's musical \"Company\" in 1975. She also made ends meet as an interior decorator. Gale died of lung cancer in February of 1980, and interred at Forest Lawn Cemetery.\n\nWhen it came to bright and polished, they didn't get much spiffier than singer/actress Janet Blair -- perhaps to her detriment in the long haul. At Columbia, she was usually overlooked for the roles that might have tested her dramatic mettle. Nevertheless, she pleased audiences as a pert and perky co-star to a number of bigger stars, ranging from George Raft and Cary Grant to Red Skelton and The Dorsey Brothers.\n\nOf Irish descent, she was born Martha Janet Lafferty in Altoona, Pennsylvania, in 1921. Raised there in the public school system, she sang in the church choir during her youth and adolescence. The inspiration and talent were evident enough for her to pursue singing as a career by the time she graduated. At age 18, she was a lead vocalist with Hal Kemp's band at the Cocoanut Grove in Los Angeles. While with Kemp's outfit, Janet met and, subsequently, married the band's pianist, Lou Busch, a respected musician, songwriter, and, later, ragtime recording artist.\n\nA Columbia Pictures talent scout caught her behind the microphone and spotted fine potential in the pretty-as-a-picture songstress. The death of Kemp in a car accident in December of 1940 and the band's eventual break-up signaled a life-changing course of events. She signed up with Columbia, for up to $100 a week, and moved to Los Angeles while her husband found work as a studio musician. Janet made an immediate impression in her debut film as the feisty kid sister of Joan Blondell and Binnie Barnes in Three Girls About Town (1941) and also dallied about in the movies, Two Yanks in Trinidad (1942) and Blondie Goes to College (1942), until her big break in the movies arrived. Star Rosalind Russell made a pitch for Janet to play her co-lead in Meine Schwester Ellen (1942) as her naive, starry-eyed younger sister (Eileen), who carried aspirations of being a big-time actress. The film became an instant hit and Janet abruptly moved up into the \"love interest\" ranks. Usually appearing in a frothy musical or light comedy, she was seeded second, however, to another redhead, Rita Hayworth, when it came to Columbia's dispensing out musical leads. Janet, nevertheless, continued promisingly paired up with George Raft in the mob-oriented tunefest, Broadway (1942); alongside Don Ameche in the musical, Something to Shout About (1943); and opposite Cary Grant in the comedy-fantasy, Pinky und Curly (1944), one of his lesser known films. She played second lead to Ms. Hayworth in Music Box Girls (1945) and was right in her element when asked to co-star with bandleaders Jimmy Dorsey and Tommy Dorsey in their biopic, Die legendären Dorseys (1947). A rare dramatic role came her way in the Glenn Ford starrer, Gallant Journey (1946), but again she was relegated to playing the stereotyped altruistic wife. In retrospect, the importance of her roles, although performed quite capably, were more supportive and decorative in nature and lacked real bite. By the time the daring-do \"B\" swashbuckler Schwarze Pfeile (1948) rolled out, Columbia had lost interest in its fair maiden and Janet had lost interest in Hollywood.\n\nA new decade brought about a new career direction. Putting together a successful nightclub act, she was spotted by composer Richard Rodgers and made a sparkling name for herself within a short time. Rodgers & Hammerstein's \"South Pacific\", starring Mary Martin, was the hit of the Broadway season and Janet dutifully took on the lead role of \"Ensign Nellie Forbush\" when the show went on tour in 1950. She gave a yeoman performance -- over 1,200 in all -- within a three-year period. Following this success, she made her Broadway debut in the musical, \"A Girl Can Tell,\" in 1953. She went on for decades, appearing in such tuneful vehicles as \"Anything Goes,\" \"Bells Are Ringing,\" \"Annie Get Your Gun,\" \"Mame,\" and \"Follies.\"\n\nHer career, however, took second place after marrying second husband, producer/director Nick Mayo in 1953, and raising their two children, Amanda and Andrew. The couple met when he stage-managed \"South Pacific\" and went on to co-own and operate Valley Music Theatre in Woodland Hills, California, during the mid-1960s. There, she played \"Maria\" in \"The Sound of Music\" and \"Peter Pan\" opposite Vincent Price's \"Dr. Hook,\" among others. Her second marriage lasted until the late '60s. TV's \"Golden Age\" proved to be a viable medium for her. A promising series role came to her in 1956 when she replaced Emmy-winning Nanette Fabray as Sid Caesar's femme co-star on Caesar's Hour (1954) but she left the sketch-based comedy show after only one season because she felt stifled and underused. She also returned to films on occasion, appearing opposite her Dieser verrückte Mr. Johns! (1948) co-star, Red Skelton, in another of his slapstick vehicles, Rindvieh Nr. 1 (1957); as Tony Randall's wife in the domestic comedy, Sexy! (1962), starring Kim Novak; and in the excellent cult British horror, Hypno (1962) (aka Burn, Witch, Burn) and she was fresh as a daisy, once again, in the antiseptic Disney musical, The One and Only, Genuine, Original Family Band (1968). After her second divorce, Janet laid off touring in musicals and settled in Hollywood to raise her two teenage children while looking for TV work. She found a steady paycheck paired up with Henry Fonda on the sitcom, The Smith Family (1971), playing another of her patented loyal wives. She also found scattered work on such TV shows as Dr. med. Marcus Welby (1969), Die Zwei mit dem Dreh (1975), Fantasy Island (1977), and Love Boat (1977). Her last guest showing was on the Mord ist ihr Hobby (1984) episode, Who Killed J.B. Fletcher? (1991). Janet died at age 85 in Santa Monica, California, after developing pneumonia.\n\nLana Turner had an acting ability that belied the \"Sweater Girl\" image MGM thrust upon her, and even many of her directors admitted that they knew she was capable of greatness (check out Im Netz der Leidenschaften (1946)). Unfortunately, her private life sometimes overshadowed her professional accomplishments.\n\nLana Turner was born Julia Jean Mildred Francis Turner in Wallace, Idaho. There is some discrepancy as to whether her birth date is February 8, 1920 or 1921. Lana herself said in her autobiography that she was one year younger (1921) than the records showed, but then this was a time where women, especially actresses, tended to \"fib\" a bit about their age. Most sources agree that 1920 is the correct year of birth. Her parents were Mildred Frances (Cowan) and John Virgil Turner, a miner, both still in their teens when she was born. In 1929, her father was murdered and it was shortly thereafter her mother moved her and the family to California where jobs were \"plentiful\". Once she matured into a beautiful young woman, she went after something that would last forever: stardom. She wasn't found at a drug store counter, like some would have you believe, but that legend persists. She pounded the pavement as other would-be actors and actresses have done, are doing and will continue to do in search of movie roles.\n\nIn 1937, Lana entered the movie world, at 17, with small parts in They Won't Forget (1937), The Great Garrick (1937) and Ein Stern geht auf (1937). These films didn't bring her a lot of notoriety, but it was a start. In 1938 she had another small part in Love Finds Andy Hardy (1938) starring Mickey Rooney. It was this film that made young men's hearts all over America flutter at the sight of this alluring and provocative young woman--known as the \"Sweater Girl\"--and one look at that film could make you understand why: she was one of the most spectacularly beautiful newcomers to grace the screen in years. By the 1940s Lana was firmly entrenched in the film business. She had good roles in such films as Der Tote lebt (1941), Somewhere I'll Find You (1942) and Weekend im Waldorf (1945). If her career was progressing smoothly, however, her private life was turning into a train wreck, keeping her in the news in a way no one would have wanted.\n\nWithout a doubt her private life was a threat to her public career. She was married eight times, twice to Stephen Crane. She also married Ronald Dante, Robert Eaton, Fred May, Lex Barker, Henry Topping and bandleader Artie Shaw. She also battled alcoholism. In yet another scandal, her daughter by Crane, Cheryl Crane, fatally stabbed Lana's boyfriend, gangster Johnny Stompanato, in 1958. It was a case that would have rivaled the O.J. Simpson murder case. Cheryl was acquitted of the murder charge, with the jury finding that she had been protecting her mother from Stompanato, who was savagely beating her, and ruled it justifiable homicide. These and other incidents interfered with Lana's career, but she persevered. The release of Solange es Menschen gibt (1959), a remake of a 1934 film (Imitation of Life (1934)), was Lana's comeback vehicle. Her performance as Lora Meredith was flawless as an actress struggling to make it in show business with a young daughter, her housekeeper and the housekeeper's rebellious daughter. The film was a box-office success and proved beyond a doubt that Lana had not lost her edge.\n\nBy the 1960s, however, fewer roles were coming her way with the rise of new and younger stars. She still managed to turn in memorable performances in such films as Das Geheimnis der Dame in Schwarz (1960) and Junggeselle im Paradies (1961). By the next decade the roles were coming in at a trickle. Her last appearance in a big-screen production was in Witches' Brew (1980). Her final film work came in the acclaimed TV series Falcon Crest (1981) in which she played Jacqueline Perrault from 1982-1983. After all those years as a sex symbol, nothing had changed--Lana was still as beautiful as ever.\n\nShe died on June 25, 1995, in Culver City, California, after a long bout with cancer. She was 74 years old.\n\nWar-era MGM had a lovely, luminous star in the making with Susan Peters. She possessed a creative talent and innate sensitivity that would surely have reigned as a leading Hollywood player for years to come had not a tragic and cruel twist of fate taken everything away from her.\n\nShe was born Suzanne Carnahan in Spokane, Washington on July 3, 1921, the eldest of two children. Her father, Robert, a construction engineer, was killed in an automobile accident in 1928, and the remaining family relocated to Los Angeles to live with Susan's grandmother. Attending various schools growing up, she excelled in athletics and studied drama in her senior year at Hollywood High School where she was spotted by a talent scout. Following graduation, she found an agent and enrolled at Max Reinhardt's School of Dramatic Arts. While performing in a showcase, she was spotted by a Warner Bros. casting agent, tested and signed to the studio in 1940.\n\nMaking her debut as an extra Susan und der liebe Gott (1940), she saw little progress and eventually became frustrated at the many bit parts thrown her way. Billed by her given name Suzanne Carnahan (known for possessing a zesty stubborn streak, she had refused to use the studio's made-up stage name of Sharon O'Keefe), Susan was barely given a line in many of her early movies. She did test for a lead role in Kings Row (1942) but lost out to Betty Field. Susan's first big break came with the Humphrey Bogart potboiler Der große Gangster (1942), where she was fourth-billed and had the second female lead. Dropped by Warners, MGM picked up her contract and adopted a new stage name for her, Susan Peters. In the Marjorie Main vehicle Tish (1942), Susan earned a co-starring part and met actor Richard Quine on the set. Quine played her husband in the film. The couple also appeared together in the film Dr. Gillespie's New Assistant (1942), and married in real life in November of 1943.\n\nSusan won the role of Ronald Colman's sister's teenage stepdaughter (and a potential love interest of the Colman character) in the profoundly moving film Gefundene Jahre (1942) and earned an Academy Award nomination for \"Best Supporting Actress\" for her efforts. Her potential in that film was quickly discovered and she continued to offer fine work in lesser movies such as the WWII spy tale Assignment in Brittany (1943), the slight comedy Young Ideas (1943) and the romantic war drama Song of Russia (1944), in which she touchingly played Nadya, a young Soviet pianist who falls for Robert Taylor. For these performances, Susan was named \"Star of Tomorrow\" along with Van Johnson and others.\n\nThen tragedy struck a little more than a year after her wedding day. While on a 1945 New Year's Day duck-hunting trip in the San Diego area with her husband and friends, one of the hunting rifles accidentally discharged when Susan went to retrieve it. The bullet lodged in her spine. Permanently paralyzed from the waist down, MGM paid for her bills but was eventually forced to settle her contract. Susan valiantly forged on with frequent work on radio. In 1946 Susan and Richard happily adopted a son, Timothy Richard, but two years later she divorced Quine -- some say she felt she was too much of a burden.\n\nAppearing with Lana Turner as a demure soldier's wife in Keep Your Powder Dry (1945), which was filmed before but released a year after her accident, Susan made a film \"comeback\" with The Sign of the Ram (1948), the melodramatic tale of an embittered, manipulative, wheelchair-bound woman who tries to destroy the happiness of all around her, but audiences were not all that receptive. She also turned to the stage with tours of \"The Glass Menagerie,\" in which she played the crippled daughter Laura from a wheelchair (with permission from playwright Tennessee Williams), and \"The Barretts of Wimpole Street\" opposite Tom Poston, wherein she performed the role of poet and chronic invalid Elizabeth Barrett Browning entirely from a couch.\n\nIn March of 1951 she portrayed an Ironside-like lawyer in the TV series Miss Susan (1951) but the show ran for less than one season, folding in December of that year. After this, the increasingly frail actress, who was constantly racked with pain, went into virtual seclusion. Suffering from acute depression and plagued by kidney problems and pneumonia, she finally lost her will to live and died at the age of 31 on October 23, 1952, of kidney failure and starvation, prompted by a developing eating disorder (anorexia nervosa). It was a profoundly sad and most unfortunate end to such a beautiful, courageous spirit and promising talent.\n\nStatuesque, smart Canadian-born Alexis Smith, with her blue/green eyes and a seductively husky voice, lent a touch of class to her leading ladies of the 1940s and 1950s.\n\nAfter her family moved to California, Alexis grew into a precocious talent and performed ballet in public by the age of thirteen -- dancing to 'Carmen' at the Hollywood Bowl. She later graduated with a degree in drama from Los Angeles City College having previously won an acting contest whilst still in high school. During a performance of a play on campus she was spotted by a Warner Brothers talent scout and signed to a contract in 1941. Until the early 1950s she was paired with the top male stars in Hollywood, including Clark Gable, Humphrey Bogart, William Holden and Bing Crosby. While often simply decorative (as, for example, in Of Human Bondage (1946) and Stallion Road (1947)), stylishly attired by costume designers like Milo Anderson and Helen Rose in the most glamorous gowns, Alexis also proved to be a capable and spirited actress in spite of relatively few opportunities to break out of the mold of \"the other woman\".\n\nEarly on in her screen career the studio's publicity department touted Alexis -- much to her chagrin -- as the \"Dynamite Girl\". While she claimed in later years to have typecast herself (saying that few of her assigned roles ever challenged her on any level) Alexis nonetheless enjoyed good critical reviews for many of her performances. She was also popular with directors and film crews who appreciated her relaxed, professional manner on the set. Commencing her Hollywood tenure, she was cast in two films with Errol Flynn (she would make a total of four films with him): Dive Bomber (1941) and the boxing drama Der freche Kavalier (1942). Though decidedly second fiddle to both the action and the charismatic Flynn, Alexis made a good first impression as the fetching romantic interest. Her next performance, in Jungfräuliche Liebe (1943) opposite Charles Boyer, was described by a reviewer as an \"intelligent rendition\". Her biggest hit of the mid-1940s was as Cole Porter's wife in the inaccurate--but hugely successful--biopic Tag und Nacht denk' ich an dich (1946). She also appeared in two \"noir\" films with Humphrey Bogart at his most menacing: the interesting and underrated Konflikt (1945) and the excellent Die zwei Mrs. Carrolls (1947). As Clark Gable's wife in the gambling drama Hoher Einsatz (1949) she was critically lauded as \"genuinely appealing\". In between, there were also some conspicuous failures, in particular her rather stolid performance in the period drama Das Geheimnis der Frau in Weiß (1948). She had little to do in Hochzeitsparade (1951) and The Turning Point (1952) and her best part in the 1950s, though small, was that of Carol Wharton in Der Mann aus Philadelphia (1959).\n\nDuring the 1960s, Alexis took a sabbatical from the screen to appear on stage with her husband, actor Craig Stevens (her marriage, a rare Hollywood success, lasted 49 years) in \"Critic's Choice\", \"Cactus Flower\" and \"Mary, Mary\". She reserved her best acting for the stage, becoming the Tony Award-winning star of Stephen Sondheim's musical \"Follies\" in which she played Phyllis during the 1971 run on Broadway (which landed her on the cover of the May 3 issue of 'Time' Magazine) and at the Shubert Theatre in Los Angeles in 1972. In 1973, she played Sylvia Fowler in a revival of Clare Boothe Luce's \"The Women\" and was nominated for another Tony for her leading role of Lila Halliday in \"Platinum\" in 1979.\n\nAlexis was seen infrequently on television from the mid-'50s, sometimes appearing on the same show opposite her husband. She had a recurring role as the homicidal Lady Jessica Montfort in Dallas (1978) during the 1984 and 1990 seasons and was nominated for an Emmy for a guest-starring role on Cheers (1982). It was fitting, or perhaps ironic, that her last film role in Zeit der Unschuld (1993) was as a New York socialite, the kind of stereotypical persona she had portrayed so often in her heyday at Warners.\n\nJudy Holliday was born Judith Tuvim in New York City on June 21, 1921. Her mother, a piano teacher, was attending a play when she went into labor and made it to the hospital just in time. Judy was an only child. By the age of four, her mother had her enrolled in ballet school which fostered a life-long interest in show business. Two years later her parents divorced. In high school, Judy began to develop an interest in theater. She appeared in several high school plays. After graduation, she got a job in the Orson Welles Mercury Theater as a switchboard operator. Judy worked her way on the stage with appearance in Boston, Philadelphia, Washington, D.C. and New York City. Judy toured on the nightclub circuit with a group called \"The Revuers\" founded by Betty Comden and Adolph Green. She went to Hollywood to make her first foray into the film world in Greenwich Village (1944). Most of her scenes ended up on the cutting room floor. Disappointed, but not discouraged, Judy earned two more roles that year in Something for the Boys (1944) and Winged Victory (1944). In the latter, Judy had a few lines of dialogue. Judy returned to New York to continue her stage career. She returned to Hollywood after five years to appear in Ehekrieg (1949) as Doris Attinger opposite screen greats Katharine Hepburn, Spencer Tracy and Tom Ewell. With her success in that role, Judy was signed to play Billie Dawn in Die ist nicht von Gestern (1950), a role which she originated on Broadway. She was nominated for and won the best actress Oscar for her performance. After filming Happy-End ... und was kommt dann? (1952), Judy was summoned before the Un-American Activities Committee to testify about her political affiliations. Fortunately for her, she was not blacklisted as were many of her counterparts, but damage was done. Her film career was curtailed somewhat, but rebounded. She continued with her stage and musical efforts, but with limited time on the screen. After filming Die Frau im goldenen Cadillac (1956), she was off-screen for four years. Her last film was the MGM production of Anruf genügt - komme ins Haus (1960) with Dean Martin and it was one of her best. Judy died two weeks before her 44th birthday in New York City on June 7, 1965.\n\nDonna Reed was born in the midwestern town of Denison, Iowa, on January 27, 1921, as Donna Belle Mullenger. A small town - a population of less than 3,000 people - Denison was located by the Boyer River, and was the county seat of Crawford County. Donna grew up as a farm girl, much like many young girls in western Iowa, except for one thing - Donna was very beautiful. That wasn't to say that others weren't as pretty, it's just that Donna's beauty stood out from all the other local girls, so much so that she won a beauty contest in Denison. Upon graduation from high school Donna left for college in Los Angeles, in the hopes of eventually entering movies. While at Los Angeles City College, she pursued her dream by participating in several college stage productions. In addition to the plays, she also won the title of Campus Queen. At one of those stage plays Donna was spotted by an MGM talent scout and was signed to a contract. Her first film was a minor role in MGM's Allein unter Gangstern (1941). That was followed by a small part in Babes on Broadway (1941), with Mickey Rooney and Judy Garland as a secretary. She then won her breakthrough role in Der Schatten des dünnen Mannes (1941). Afterwards, MGM began giving her better parts, in films such as The Bugle Sounds (1942), The Courtship of Andy Hardy (1942) and The Man from Down Under (1943). In 1944 she received second billing playing Carol Halliday in See Here, Private Hargrove (1944), a comedy about a reporter drafted into the army who eventually meets up with Donna's character as a worker in the canteen. The following year Donna starred in Das Bildnis des Dorian Gray (1945), her best role to date. It was a love story set in London in 1890. It got mixed critical reviews but did well at the box-office. Donna was now one of the leading ladies of Hollywood. In 1946 she starred in what is probably her best-known role, as the wife of James Stewart in the classic Ist das Leben nicht schön? (1946). This timeless story is a holiday staple to this day. The film also starred Lionel Barrymore and Thomas Mitchell. The next year Donna starred as Ann Daniels in Paramount's Beyond Glory (1948) with Alan Ladd, which did well at the box-office. Her next role was the strongest she had had yet--Todesfalle von Chikago (1949), again with Ladd. It was one of the best mystery dramas to come out of Hollywood in a long time, and did very well at the box office. As the 1940s faded out and the 1950s stormed in, Donna's roles got bigger but were mainly of the wholesome, girl-next-door type. In 1953, however, she starred as the hostess Alma in the widely acclaimed Verdammt in alle Ewigkeit (1953). She was so good in that film she was nominated for and won the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress, beating out such veterans as Thelma Ritter and Marjorie Rambeau. The film itself won for Best Picture and remains a classic to this day. Later that year Donna starred in Der Tolpatsch (1953), a comedy with Jerry Lewis and Dean Martin. Three years later she landed the role of Sacajawea in Am fernen Horizont (1955), the story of the Lewis and Clark Expedition, starring Charlton Heston and Fred MacMurray. After finishing Besuch um Mitternacht (1958), Donna began her own TV series (produced by her husband), Mutter ist die Allerbeste (1958), a hit that ran for eight years. She was so effective in the show that she was nominated for TV's prestigious Emmy Award as Best Actress every year from 1959-1962. She was far more popular in TV than on the screen. After the run of the program, Donna took some time away from show business before coming back in a couple of made-for-TV movies (in 1974, she had made a feature called Welcome to Arrow Beach (1973), but it was never released). She did get the role of Ellie Ewing Farlow in the hit TV series Dallas (1978) during the 1984-85 season. It was to be her final public performance. On January 14, 1986, less than two weeks before her 65th birthday, she died of pancreatic cancer in Beverly Hills, California. Grover Asmus, her husband, created the Donna Reed Foundation for the Performing Arts in her hometown of Denison. The foundation helps others who desire a career in the arts. Donna never forgot her roots. She was still a farm girl at heart.\n\nOne of America's most loved actresses was born Doris Mary Kappelhoff on April 3, 1922, in Cincinnati, Ohio, to Alma Sophia (Welz), a housewife, and William Joseph Kappelhoff, a music teacher and choir master. Her grandparents were all German immigrants. She had two brothers, Richard, who died before she was born and Paul, a few years older.\n\nHer parents divorced while she was still a child, and she lived with her mother. Like most little girls, Doris liked to dance. At fourteen, she formed a dance act with a boy, Jerry Doherty, and they won $500 in a local talent contest. She and Jerry took a brief trip to Hollywood to test the waters. They felt they could succeed, so she and Jerry returned to Cincinnati with the intention of packing and making a permanent move to Hollywood. Tragically, the night before she was to move to Hollywood, she was injured riding in a car hit by a train, ending the possibility of a dancing career.\n\nIt was a terrible setback, but after taking singing lessons she found a new vocation, and at age 17, she began touring with the Les Brown Band. She met trombonist Al Jorden, whom she married in 1941. Jorden was prone to violence and they divorced after two years, not long after the birth of their son Terry. In 1946, Doris married George Weidler, but this union lasted less than a year. Day's agent talked her into taking a screen test at Warner Bros. The executives there liked what they saw and signed her to a contract (her early credits are often confused with those of another actress named Doris Day, who appeared mainly in B westerns in the 1930s and 1940s).\n\nHer first starring movie role was in Zaubernächte in Rio (1948). The next year, she made two more films, Mein Traum bist Du (1949) and Ein tolles Gefühl (1949). Audiences took to her beauty, terrific singing voice and bubbly personality, and she turned in fine performances in the movies she made (in addition to several hit records). She made three films for Warner Bros. in 1950 and five more in 1951. In that year, she met and married Martin Melcher, who adopted her young son Terry, who later grew up to become Terry Melcher, a successful record producer.\n\nIn 1953, Doris starred in Schwere Colts in zarter Hand (1953), which was a major hit, and several more followed: Das blonde Glück (1954), Nachtclub-Affären (1955), Der Mann, der zuviel wußte (1956) and what is probably her best-known film, Bettgeflüster (1959). She began to slow down her filmmaking pace in the 1960s, even though she started out the decade with a hit, Meisterschaft im Seitensprung (1960).\n\nIn 1958, her brother Paul died. Around this time, her husband, who had also taken charge of her career, had made deals for her to star in films she didn't really care about, which led to a bout with exhaustion. The 1960s weren't to be a repeat of the previous busy decade. She didn't make as many films as she had in that decade, but the ones she did make were successful: Bitte nicht stören! (1965), Spion in Spitzenhöschen (1966), Wo warst Du als das Licht ausging (1968) and Der Mann in Mammis Bett (1968). Martin Melcher died in 1968, and Doris never made another film, but she had been signed by Melcher to do her own TV series, Doris Day in... (1968). That show, like her movies, was successful, lasting until 1973. After her series went off the air, she made only occasional TV appearances.\n\nBy the time Martin Melcher died, Doris discovered she was millions of dollars in debt. She learned that Melcher had squandered virtually all of her considerable earnings, but she was eventually awarded $22 million by the courts in a case against a man that Melcher had unwisely let invest her money. She married for the fourth time in 1976 and since her divorce in 1980 has devoted her life to animals.\n\nDoris was a passionate animal rights activist. She ran Doris Day Animal League in Carmel, California, which advocates homes and proper care of household pets.\n\nDoris died on May 13, 2019, in Carmel Valley Village, California. She was 97."
