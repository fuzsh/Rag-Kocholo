She also was a member of the International Best Dressed List.\n\t\n\tHer first husband was a German-born resident of Mexico named Scholtens, from whom she was divorced.[3][4]\n\t\n\tShe married on 4 October 1935, in London, England, as her second husband, Franz-Egon, Count von Fürstenberg-Hedringen (1896-1975); she was his second wife. By him, she had one daughter, Baroness Dolores (born 31 July 1936)[5] and a son, Baron Franz-Egon (born 27 July 1939).[6] She also had a stepdaughter from her husband's first marriage, the actress Betsy von Furstenberg.

Thomas Loel Guinness, a Member of Parliament (1906-1988) and a member of the extended Guinness beer family, though his particular branch made its fortune in banking and real estate. Of him, she told Noel Coward, &quot; I could never sleep with Loel.
