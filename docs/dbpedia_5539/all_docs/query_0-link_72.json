She was always willing to do anything she could for her friends and family. She was cherished and adored by everyone she came in contact with. A lot of people know she started a battle with cancer 10 years ago. What a lot of people didn’t see was the dedication and determination she showcased every single day, even when no one was looking. She started living a minimalist lifestyle and finding any way she could to stay active because she learned an important lesson of life: money can never replace or buy back the memories made with the ones she loved. She was always encouraging and supporting people any way she could with their goals and dreams. She was always the first to volunteer or tackle a task if it meant helping and being able to share a conversation with someone.\n\nShe always did her best to bring people together. She was a strong bond that kept the family connected and laughing for hours, even from long distance. Her easygoing attitude and quick witted humor will be soulfully missed, but the most inspiring memory will always be: She never gave up, no matter how hard life got, or unfair things became for her. She had the mental tenacity and love in her heart to go for many lifetimes, but unfortunately her body was too exhausted. If you asked her what her biggest accomplishment was, she was always sharp to reply: My son. Everyone who knew her and the things she loved could always tell her heart belonged in the west. She loved horses, line dancing, rodeos, traveling, family get togethers, country music and sometimes a little rock and roll.\n\nAt Terry’s request there are no services. Those wishing to remember Terry may consider a donation to the Schuyler County Humane Society, 124 Marina Drive, Montour Falls, NY 14865 (or online at www.SchuylerHumane.org). The Royce-Chedzoy Funeral Home of Watkins Glen is assisting the family.\n\nObituary: Karen E. Romeo\n\nThe following obituary was submitted to The Odessa File by the Haughey-Wood & Zinger Funeral Home, Montour Falls.\n\nKaren E. Romeo\n\nSchuyler County lost a Beautiful Person on August 25, 2024 at 1:52 pm. Karen E. Romeo, age 66 of Watkins Glen, passed away at Cayuga Medical Center.\n\nKaren was a helper to her neighborhood. She never had to be asked; she’d see the need, walk over, and pitch in. The loss her sisters, Sandy and Bonnie, feel is so unbearable. The pain takes their breath away.\n\nKaren completed Odessa-Montour High School in three years and graduated from Corning Community College and received her Bachelor’s Degree from Elmira College, plus other certifications from various courses she studied, including a General Motors Certification.\n\nCommon sense was so natural to her. She could not understand why her two sisters were “Left behind in the Dust” when it came to common sense. Karen was the person we automatically called when we were puzzled.\n\nKaren’s employment started at Shepard Niles Crane & Hoist. She worked for many small businesses who needed help. Some companies would have failed without Karen’s intervention.\n\nKaren had many acquaintances, but her true friends meant everything to her. She was there for them and they for her.\n\nWe can’t name all the special friends in Karen’s life for fear we would leave someone out. What matters is that you know where you stood with Karen.\n\nKaren’s hobbies all seemed to be outdoors except for rescuing stray cats. She gave them a home and lots of love to finish out their years. Her beautiful flower gardens, sailing, hiking and backpacking the Grand Canyon and outback areas of Canada, cross country skiing and fixing things at her home or at the lake. She knew how to do it all.\n\nKaren is survived by her two sisters, Bonnie and Sandy; as well as the descendants of Dominick and Carmella Franzese. In addition to her parents, Dominic J. and Ethel N. Romeo, Karen was predeceased by her brother Don Romeo. Her sisters’ hearts are broken; they will miss “The Kid” so very much.\n\nFamily and friends may call from 6 p.m. to 8 p.m. on Thursday, August 29, 2024 at the Haughey-Wood & Zinger Funeral Home, 122 N. Genesee St., Montour Falls. A graveside service will be held on August 30, 2024 at 11 a.m. at Holy Cross Cemetery in Watkins Glen.\n\nMemorial donations may be made in her memory to the Humane Society of Schuyler County, 124 Marina Dr., Montour Falls, NY 14865; St. Mary’s of the Lake Church, PO Box 289, Watkins Glen, NY 14891, or the Watkins Glen Fire Dept., 201 N. Perry St., Watkins Glen, NY 14891. Memories of Karen may be shared with family and friends at haugheywoodzinger.com\n\nObituary: James Vernon Alling\n\nThe following obituary was submitted to The Odessa File by the Vedder-Scott & Zinger Funeral Home, Montour Falls.\n\nJames Vernon Alling\n\nAge 76, of Montour Falls, NY and formerly of Rock Stream, NY, passed away on Monday, August 19, 2024. He was born in Waterloo, NY on November 10, 1947, the son of Vernon and Jane (Shirley) Alling, Jr. He was a graduate of Odessa-Montour Central School.\n\nMusic was Jim’s passion. He often called on his sisters Linda and Cindy to discuss Music Theory. Those who knew him received many a You Tube video. He was a percussionist. As a teen, he played snare drum under the direction of Dr. Frank Brown at Odessa-Montour Central School. He played professionally with a local group called The Echelons and once was invited to “sit-in” on the song Wipe-Out by the Safaris (performing the tom-tom drum solo seamlessly) for a band touring locally at The Fontainebleau, Odessa NY. He could often be found playing one of many harmonicas in his collection. Before his passing, he was planning to teach himself guitar on his left-handed Fender Stratocaster. He truly wanted to be a Jimi Hendrix!\n\nHis interests were many, as evidenced by his enormous collection of scrapbooks filled with detailed notes and pictures of boats, motorcycles, fishing equipment, and hunting rifles. Having had one or more of each. We all remember the hydroplane boat he built from scratch, in the upstairs of our garage at 104 Catherine Street. He planed, sanded, stained and polished the wood till it shone like glass. The launch on Seneca Lake, however, didn’t go quite as planned. Jim was an avid stamp collector since childhood. He took up coin collecting as well. Polishing stones with the patience of Job proved fruitful. They too were a prided collection.\n\nHis years of employment as a Machinist at Shepard-Niles, where he worked with brothers Bob and Steve, required accuracy in the smallest of detail and diligence. Jim provided 27 years of that accuracy, amassing a tool collection that was admired by many. He loved science and could often be found reading a book about Tesla or nuclear fusion, then would call brother Paul for “clarification.” He was a wealth of knowledge and used it to provide answers to how things worked.\n\nHe enjoyed walking along the railroad tracks near his property in Rock Stream. It was there he met “Happy” the feral cat. It was “the best day ever” for both as they cohabitated for many years after. Can’t forget to mention his sense of humor. If anyone could figure that out it was brother Eddie, they were two of a kind.\n\nTo know Jimmy was to know a very prayerful man who could easily recite scripture. It was this knowledge of scripture that got him through some challenging times in his life to the end. He will be truly missed by his children, Jim, Jamie, and Scott, grandchildren, cousins, nieces and nephews, friends and siblings.\n\nJim is survived by his daughter, Jamie (Alling) Shah of Charlotte, NC; two sons, James (Rachel) Alling of Horseheads and Scott (Beth) Magee of Homer, NY; two sisters, Linda (Alling) Golicki of Dresden, TN and Cynthia (Alling) Ciaschi of Montour Falls; three brothers, Robert Alling of Montour Falls, Paul (Yvonne) Alling of Orangeburg, SC and Edward (Shawna) Alling of Alpine, NY; three grandchildren, Kiersten, Brianna and Zachary; and by several nieces, nephews and cousins. He was predeceased by his parents, Vernon and Jane Alling; and by his brother, Stephen Alling.\n\nA graveside service will be held privately by the family at Montour Cemetery. Contributions may be made in his memory to the Humane Society of Schuyler County, 124 Marina Dr., Montour Falls, NY 14865 or Golisano Children’s Hospital, 601 Elmwood Ave., Rochester, NY 14642.

Gee\n\nThe following obituary was submitted to The Odessa File by the Royce-Chedzoy Funeral Home, Watkins Glen.\n\nRodney L. Gee\n\nAge 64, of Sugar Hill, Watkins Glen, NY, passed away at home on August 18, 2024.\n\nHe was born in Penn Yan, NY on July 21, 1960, the son of Ronald Ugene Gee and Wilma. He owned and operated Sugarhill Woodworks and Greenhouse, making outdoor crafts and planters with the help of his wife.\n\nRodney was predeceased by his father; brothers Ronald Gee and Edward Gee; mother-in-law Beverly Watts; step-brother Jarod Brown; and brothers-in-law Stephen Morse and Charles Crance.\n\nHe is survived by his loving wife Kim Gee, son Robert (Erica) Gee; daughter Michelle Gee (Dave); mother Wilma (Gary Jr.) Brown; six brothers and sisters, Donald (Sandra) Gee, Dale (Michele) Gee, Duane Gee (Brandi), Carolyn (Steve) Brockway, Janet Crance, and Judy (Mike) Iresabal; step-brother Justin (Lizzie) Brown; seven grandchildren, Randy, Gavin, McKenna, Carter, Emmitt, Cameron, and Waylon; father-in-law Howard Watts; and several aunts, uncles, nieces and nephews.\n\nThe family will receive friends at the Royce-Chedzoy Funeral Home, 212 E. 4th St., Watkins Glen, on Friday (August 23rd) from 12 noon-2 p.m.; followed by a funeral service at 2 p.m.; and burial at 3:15 p.m. at Tyrone Union Cemetery.\n\nHe spent every day of his life enjoying life outside, creating his livelihood and leisure with his bare hands from an early age -- cutting trees, growing grapes, building anything and everything for himself and his family on his own. He was accomplished at training and competing pulling Belgium ponies and creating a business that encompassed all he learned and loved, until he passed. A harder working man will not be found.\n\nObituary: Irene (Negri) Hanley\n\nThe following obituary was submitted to The Odessa File by the Royce-Chedzoy Funeral Home, Watkins Glen.\n\nIrene (Negri) Hanley\n\nAge 95, of Corning, NY, passed away peacefully at Seneca View Skilled Nursing Facility in Montour Falls, NY on August 4, 2024.\n\nIrene was born on August 21, 1928. She was a lifelong resident of Corning and grew up in the old Italian neighborhood of Water Street, where Wegman's is now.\n\nShe graduated from Corning Free Academy. After raising her family she went to work at Corning Glass in the Traffic Department, where she retired after 20 years of service. After retirement she took many wonderful trips with close friends to places such as Italy, Spain and Hawaii. She was a communicant at St Patrick's and All Saints Parishes. Irene loved playing bridge and her time at Keuka Lake.\n\nShe was predeceased by parents Charles and Josephine Negri; son Michael; her four sisters, Victoria Berto, Philomena Ruocco, Frances Agosta, and Florence Crans; her four brothers, Charles Negri Jr., Michael Negri, Anthony Negri, and James Negri; and her special sister-in-law, Cissy, and daughter in-law Nancy.\n\nSurvivors are her brother Richard Negri; daughter Colleen (John ) Waterhouse; sons William (Susan) Hanley, Patrick (Nanette) Hanley and Brian Hanley; nine grandchildren; 12 great-grandchildren, and many nieces and nephews.\n\nThe family would like to thank the staff at Seneca View for the outstanding care they provided Irene in her final years. She was very content there and would say, \"This is a very good place to be and the food's not bad.\"\n\nA mass will be held at All Saints Parish, 158 State St. in Corning on Friday (Aug 30th) at 9:30 a.m., followed by burial at St. Mary’s Cemetery.

Sophie's life was defined by love, kindness, intelligence, and adventure. She was a beautiful woman whose thirty-four years wove a tapestry of humanity.\n\nSophie is the treasured daughter of Marie Fitzsimmons and Kirk Peters. She is the most beloved sister and sister-in-law of Jores and Carolina Peters and Jared and Katie Peters. She is the aunt of Jori, Santiago, Jovan, Maya, Griffin and Harrison. She was adored by the grandparents, aunties, uncles, cousins, and her Peace Corps family. Anton's family thought the world of her.\n\nSophie's home on Seneca Lake extended to the Watkins Glen Schools and her dad's veterinary clinic. She thrived in the arms of her family, a bounty of friends, and the devotion of her teachers and coaches. She was an accomplished student and a fierce athlete. She loved learning, she loved sports, and she loved her friends. And how we loved her. Sophie had a beautiful childhood.\n\nSophie attended SUNY Geneseo, where she received a first-rate education and the glorious friendships of her soccer girls. Her semester in Nicaragua enriched her burgeoning global being, and her compassionate nature flourished. Upon graduation, Sophie was accepted as a City Year Volunteer and moved to Detroit, where she met and fell in love with Anton while quietly and effectively lifting up her students at Osborne High School.\n\nSophie, in the footsteps of her Grandma Janie, earned her Masters of Social Work, graduating from the University of Maryland School of Social Work in 2016. Sophie's internship in the Maryland Office of the Public Defender cemented her compassion and responsibility to each person she encountered. Sophie went on to work with Catholic Charities of Baltimore as a school-based therapist, extending her counsel to adults in the community.\n\nIn 2018, Sophie's lifelong dream of joining the Peace Corps came to fruition as she and Anton were sworn in as Peace Corps Volunteers in Uganda. Sophie's position as a literacy educator was deeply satisfying. Her gentle nature, appreciation of her colleagues, and joy of children made her a beloved member of St. Bruno's Primary School for the two years they lived in Uganda. Sophie's teaching and coaching were developed with deep respect and collaboration with her fellow teachers and principal. Sophie's daily work in the school library was joyous and meaningful. Sophie's Peace Corps Project of building latrines at St. Bruno's continues to make a difference in the well-being of the school community.\n\nSophie's experiences in Uganda, South Africa, Lesotho, Namibia, and Nicaragua shaped her worldview. Her travels to twenty countries filled her spirit and challenged her keen intellect, informing her sense of responsibility as a global citizen.\n\nSophie and Anton made their home in Baltimore, where she worked as a Program Analyst for the U.S. government, doing the daily work that makes the Affordable Care Act accessible to all.\n\nShe appreciated her team and believed in their mission. Sophie's devotion to our country extended from her daily work to her quiet and steady advocacy for social justice and reproductive rights.\n\nSophie was a beautiful mother, kind and gentle, patient and playful. She and Desmond had the happiest and most joyous love. Josie's nine months in the most intimate and rhythmic nurturing of Sophie's being and brief time in her mother's arms is a forever imprint of the greatest love.\n\nSophie was a tender and compassionate wife, thoughtful and pragmatic. She loved Anton deeply and treasured their adventurous yet grounded life in Baltimore. Sophie was proud of Anton's exquisite teaching in the Baltimore City Schools. She loved their neighborhood and the sweet community that encompassed them. In this past year, their travels with Desmond to France and Scotland brought such happiness.\n\nOur gratitude and wonder for the beauty of Sophie is deep and abiding. Our grief in her passing is profound. The outpouring of your love and support has soothed our hearts and we are so grateful.\n\nFamily and friends are invited to celebrate Sophie's gorgeous life and mourn her passing on August 24 from 2 p.m. until 4 p.m. on the knoll at Davis Farm, 5281 Peach Orchard, Hector. Sophie's service will begin at 2:15. In the case of a weather event, we shall gather at the Hector Firehouse.\n\nObituary: John L.

She was a motorcycle enthusiast, and both she and Charles still have motorcycles on loan displayed at the Curtiss Museum in Hammondsport, NY.\n\nMartha was an avid gardener, and if she wasn’t sailing or watching boats and birds on Seneca Lake, you could find her out in the garden, reading a paper, or involved in one of the 100s of jigsaw puzzles she enjoyed greatly. Her family was everything to her, and her entire life, even into her 80s, you could see her at her children’s and grandchildren’s soccer games, running events, volleyball, basketball, Boy Scouts, etc.\n\nMartha was predeceased by her husband, Charles. She is survived by two children, Edward J. Darling and his wife Susan of North Rose, NY, and Julie Ann Darling Sissel and her husband Mark of Rock Stream; and three grandchildren, Jonah, Isaiah, and Seraphina. She recently was blessed to become a grandmother again to Mark’s son, Matthew Harmon Sissel, and his wife Seyeon.\n\nMartha was a devoted wife, mother, and grandmother, and she loved nothing more than to spend time with her family. Even the day before she went to be with her Lord, she was pointing and naming family members in a photograph collage made by her daughter-in-law, Sue. Family was her rock, and she was the rock of her family.\n\nVisitation will be held on Saturday, July 27, 2024 from 1 p.m. to 2 p.m. with the funeral service immediately following from 2 p.m. to 3 p.m. at the Royce-Chedzoy Funeral Home in Watkins Glen, NY. Interment will be at Rock Stream Cemetery at 3:15 p.m. after the funeral service. The family is having a reception with food and refreshments at the family cottage at 4256 Kent Klub Rd., Rock Stream, after the burial. We hope that everyone can stop and come together to celebrate, remember, and share their special memories of Martha and her life.\n\nMemorial contributions may be made to the Martha Valorn Darling Sodus Central School Scholarship Fund or the First Reformed Church at Sodus, NY. Checks can be made out to the church, or for the scholarship to Julie Sissel or Edward Darling.\n\nArrangements are by the Royce-Chedzoy Funeral Home, 212 East 4th Street, Watkins Glen.

June 25, 2024 would have been his 64th wedding anniversary to his wife, Lois Reta Chapman Cutton. There were many more dates or events that he was discussing just literally a few hours before his passing.\n\nDon was deeply spiritual and was very active for many years in the Odessa Baptist Church Family. His spiritual walk was a great example to those around him. Among all things, his immediate family was always at the forefront of his actions and thoughts, and his legacy as a husband, father, grandfather, uncle, brother and nephew is grand indeed! Those left to cherish his love are his wife, Lois, and his children Donna & Tim Philips, Kathy & Shawn Crane, and David Cutton.\n\nDon’s grandchildren were of great joy to him and brought him so many blessings and joys. They include Abigail Philips, Joseph Philips, Evan Crane, Joseph Crane, Caitlyn Crane, Michele Slaven, Rachel Cutton and Eliana Cutton. There are several great grandchildren: Gianni, Carson, Blake, Madalynn, Landon, Aubrey, Colton and Cassius.\n\nDon was a proud member of the U.S. Army, having served in Korea in two different signal battalions. When in the 26th Signal, he helped build and lay line in support of the Korean peace talks that stretched from the UN base camp to Panmunjom. The unit was given a Unit Commendation for its efforts. He learned many habits in the Army that he retained until death. For example: his “jump out of the bed early, make the bed so tight you couldn’t put your feet in it the next night, shave, and emerge with a resolve to tackle the world” daily habit. It was fun to experience that every day!\n\nAfter utilizing the GI Bill to further and finish his education, Don taught Industrial Arts for 34 years at Odessa-Montour Central School. During that time, he was very active in the Teacher’s Union, acting as president for 15 years. He became active in the Retired Teacher’s Association thereafter, receiving the admiration of all of those around him for his service and dedication.\n\nWe thank God for his infinite mercy during Don’s passing, and for allowing us to share our life with this wonderful man. We will miss him and will always consider his life an example and a great one to follow.\n\nRelatives and friends are invited to call on Saturday, June 29, 2024 from 11:00 a.m. to 1:00 p.m. at the Odessa Baptist Church, 111 Fowler Place, Odessa, NY.

Affeldt\n\nThe following obituary was submitted to The Odessa File by Deacon Tom Ruda.\n\nJames A. Affeldt\n\nJames Affeldt, a longtime resident of Rock Stream, NY, passed away unexpectedly on Saturday, June 8, 2024 at 80 years young.\n\nJim was born in Elmira, NY on September 11, 1943, the son of the late Frances and Helen (Sykora) Affeldt. He enlisted in the Navy right after high school at the age 18. Jim referred to this period in his life as a time “when I knew everything and could do anything I put my mind to.” He had a fulfilling welding career in the Navy working in countries like Scotland, Japan, and Antarctica. Jim retired from the Navy in 1982 after serving his country for 21 years.\n\nAfter he retired from the Navy, he and his wife Anita owned and operated A & J Welding and was known as “the man who could weld anything.” His most common welding joke was “I can weld anything, but the crack of dawn.” His work can be seen all over Schuyler County and beyond; these stand as a testament to his skill and desire to do the best job possible. There are many times he helped others for free or at a reduced rate. Often he would not charge churches for his labor, telling them instead that “they could pay him by praying for him. We all need prayers.”\n\nJim was a serious student of the Bible and always looked for the deeper meaning of the “Living Word” that helped him love God and his fellow travelers in this world. He never judged people harshly and found that by listening to others, he could hear the Lord speak to him. He could always find God in the Word, in others, and in Nature. He expressed this through his deeds, thoughts, and how he lived his life. He was a true and faithful servant as evidenced in all his personal and business relationships. He was the most generous, kindhearted, and giving person anyone could ask for. One could just imagine God welcoming him home with the words “Well done good and faithful servant. Inherit the Kingdom prepared for you from the foundation of the world.” And Jim’s reply to God might be, “I need to work, you got anything that you need welded?” Mitch Albom once wrote “Strangers are only family you have yet to meet.” Jim has met many people in his life that he has traveled for 80 years, all are family.\n\nJim was preceded in death by his parents and his older brother, Frances (Fran) Affeldt. Jim loved his family very much and was often referred to as “little Affeldt” when he was of school age because of the times he tried to emulate Fran.\n\nJim is survived by his loving and dedicated wife of 40 years, Anita P. (Sanchez y Perez) Affeldt; his three daughters, Theresa (Tim) Warne, Kimberly (Keith) Walker, and Michelle (Paul) Temerowski; and one son, Raymond Affeldt (Debra); his two sisters, Kathleen Knab and Julie Osborn Taylor; Paula Affeldt (sister-in-law); 11 grandchildren; 19 great grandchildren; and many loved nieces, nephews and cousins in many states including Oklahoma, North Carolina, California and Arizona. He loved them all very much and would do anything for them. He influenced all of those close to him in his own quiet and prayerful way; and for that we thank him beyond any words that could convey our heartfelt gratitude for his life.\n\nJames will be sorely missed by his wife and children and many loved ones and acquaintances. In keeping with his wishes, there will be no public calling hours at this time. A celebration mass of his life will be announced in the fall.\n\nThe family would like to thank the EMT personnel, Schuyler County Sheriff's office, and Schuyler Hospital Emergency unit. In lieu of flowers, please consider a donation to St. Mary's in Watkins Glen, the Humane Society in Montour Falls, or helping a stranger you meet along the road.\n\nObituary: Sherry May Hubbard\n\nThe following obituary was submitted to The Odessa File by the Vedder-Scott & Zinger Funeral Home, Montour Falls.\n\nSherry May Hubbard\n\nAge 74, of Watkins Glen, NY passed away on Friday, June 7, 2024 at Arnot Ogden Medical Center, Elmira, NY.
