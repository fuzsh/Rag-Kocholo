Dolores Guinness sports a sultry and enviably sun-kissed glow on our July 1970 cover. The socialite wore a Christian Dior scarf and Cadoro earrings for an issue that celebrated the Riviera and all of its high-seas, deep-tan regulars. Guinness, born the Baroness von Fürstenberg-Hedrigen in a wealthy sector of Berlin in the 30s, was the daughter of legendary woman-about-town, Gloria Guinness. The elder Guinness was a contributing editor at Harper's Bazaar and International Best Dressed List Hall of Famer, who had four husbands (the Baron was her second) and even more homes in all corners of the world. But the younger Guinness did not hide in her mother's shadow for long. She soon became a fashion icon in her own right, earning her place on the International Best Dressed List by the time she appeared on our cover, at the age of 34. She was often photographed by the likes of Richard Avedon, Bert Stern, and Cecil Beaton, for Vogue, Harper's Bazaar, and Town & Country wearing Givenchy, Dior, Saint Laurent, and Balenciaga. In her heyday during the 50s and 60s, Guinness represented the crème de la crème of the international jet set. In 1955, at age 19, she married her stepbrother, Patrick Guinness, son of her mother's fourth husband. The couple's youngest child, Victoria Christina, went on to marry a Niarchos (Philip), who in turn begat Stavros III and Eugenie, the former a bar-brawling ex of Paris Hilton's, the latter a doe-eyed blonde frequently found front row at Fashion Weeks everywhere.
