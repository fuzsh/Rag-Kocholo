His position in American cinema has never been undisputed, starting out as an often impishly sexy young romantic lead, developing through his independent, political activist playboy persona of the seventies, and to the hottest of Hollywood's fifty plus men in the late eighties and nineties.\n\nWhen the almost unreasonable resourceful Beatty got his break in Splendor In the Grass, he had already turned down ten offers for a football scholarship. He then scored only fairly successful roles in a prolific 60s, before hitting it big with Bonnie and Clyde (1967). He was Oscar-nominated for best actor as well as for best picture (as a producer), and was overnight one of the most sought after men in the business.\n\nAfter doing a handful of star-fueled movies in the early 70s (often opposite contemporary love interests, such as Julie Christie in McCabe and Mrs. Miller and Goldie Hawn in $ (Dollars)), Beatty has arguably been the most selective and independent performer in Hollywood history. In the nearly thirty years that has passed since 1975, Beatty has only acted in eight movies, only one of which he hasn't been either producing or directing himself. In the process he's been able to turn down roles such as the lead in The Way We Were, the role of Michael Corleone in The Godfather: Part II and recently as Bill in Kill Bill: Vol 2.\n\nWarren Beatty's political affiliation has always been an important basis for his movies, and particularly so with two of his most acclaimed films as a director; Reds (1981) and Bulworth (1998), but also in films he has only written, such as Shampoo (1975). From the 9 films in which Beatty has been credited for work behind the camera, he has received a total of 14 Academy Award nominees. It is an achievment beyond compare.\n\nThe sophisticated, trendy, intelligent, arrogant, dominant and notoriously womanizing Beatty was finally hooked in 1992 when he married Anette Bening whom he had met during the filming of Bugsy (1991). 21 years his junior, Bening has managed what no other women has before her; keep Beatty on the mat. They now have four children and reside on Mulholland Drive along with fellow giant Jack Nicholson (and until his death, with Marlon Brando).\n\nAWARDS\n\nThe Academy Awards (Oscars)\n\n1968\n\nNominated for Best Picture for Bonnie and Clyde - producer\n\n1968\n\nNominated for Actor for Bonnie and Clyde\n\n1976\n\nNominated for Writing (Best Original Screenplay) for Shampoo\n\n1979\n\nNominated for Writing (Best Adapted Screenplay) for Heaven Can Wait\n\n1979\n\nNominated for Best Picture for Heaven Can Wait - producer\n\n1979\n\nNominated for Actor for Heaven Can Wait\n\n1982\n\nNominated for Best Picture for Reds- producer\n\n1982\n\nBest Director for Reds\n\n1982\n\nNominated for Writing (Best Original Screenplay) for Reds\n\n1982\n\nNominated for Actor for Reds\n\n1992\n\nNominated for Best Picture for Bugsy - producer\n\n1992\n\nNominated for Actor for Bugsy\n\n1999\n\nIrving G.
