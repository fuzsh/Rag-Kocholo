        "text": "Warren Beatty (1937-) is an Oscar® winning American actor, producer, screenwriter and director. He has been nominated for fourteen Academy Awards® – four for Best Actor, four for Best Picture, two for Best Director, three for Original Screenplay, and one for Adapted Screenplay – winning Best Director for 1981’s Reds (1981).\n\nDrivel part of the page: The events that got us to do a Warren Beatty UMR movie page. (1) Yesterday we were at McDonalds for lunch and the Carly Simon “You’re So Vain” was playing in the background music. I told my wife that song was written about Warren Beatty. She said “Is that trivia nugget on your Beatty page?” I told that I had a request to do a Beatty page but had not done one yet. Then today I saw that Beatty was going to be 79 tomorrow (March 30th)…so I figured the gods were telling me it was time to do a Beatty page. So just in time for his birthday….here is our Warren Beatty UMR Movie Page."
