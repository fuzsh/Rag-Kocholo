        "text": "Story: The debate over who was professional wrestling’s greatest tag team will never have a definitive answer, but to me, Demolition would earn that distinction. While first brought in as an answer of sorts to the surging popularity of The Road Warriors, the painted faces and spiked costumes were just about all the two teams had in common. Demolition, made up of Bill Eadie as Ax and Barry Darsow as Smash, had the raw power and high impact moves of The Road Warriors, but could also work a more technical style, sell like a million dollars, and provide remarkable in ring psychology, a combination of skills that few, if any other teams could match. While Darsow was brought in after a brief, failed run with Randy Colley as Eadie’s partner and of course a third member in Crush would eventually be added, Eadie and Darsow are the definitive version of Demolition. And in this shoot interview, the two sit down to discuss their careers, with a focus on their time as Demolition.\n\nEntertainment Value: As a Demolition fan, I was of course drawn to this shoot interview, but I had good reason to have high expectations for this release. I have enjoyed shoot interviews and podcast appearances from both Bill Eadie and Barry Darsow in solo sessions, as both are well spoken, candid, and seem to be believable in their stories. So bringing both together for one shoot interview sounded great to me and the end result proved me right, as this is a terrific shoot session. The interview takes a little time to trace the origins of both men getting involved in wrestling, which has been covered elsewhere, but a few minutes for those unfamiliar was a wise choice. After that brief introduction period, we get to how and when the two met and then the interview stays on track on the Demolition topics, taking us from concept to execution and the eventual end of the team.\n\nI do want to mention, if you seek out the more salacious stories or wild party memories, this shoot won’t hit that sweet spot. Eadie and Darsow talk about how they avoided most of that, instead treating it like a business and just focusing on earning to send home to their families. Eadie is very emphatic on this, to the point he might seem a touch preachy, but both basically state that while it wasn’t their approach, they don’t judge their peers who chose to live on the wilder side. Don’t let the lack of gossip or scandalous stories fool you however, as this interview is never dull in the least and is packed with interesting tidbits, with minimal filler. I love a good road story as much as anyone, but it was also nice just to hear about the business aspect and the details of navigating 80s WWF, so I have no complaints. I really enjoyed this one, so Demolition’s shoot interview is well recommended."
