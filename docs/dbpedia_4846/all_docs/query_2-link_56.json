        "text": "One-half of the legendary tag team opens up.\n\nTwo years ago former 3-time WWF World Tag Team Champions Ax and Smash of the legendary tag team 'Demolition' were revealed as a part of a class action lawsuit that was filed against World Wrestling Entertainment. The lawsuit came by way of wrestlers who during their respective tenures in the company suffered serious brain injures and they claimed that WWE withheld the information of their injuries from them.\n\nDespite the legal situation between the two parties, 'Demolition' was one of the more successful tag teams in the history of WWE. For 27 years they held the record for the longest reigning Tag Team Champions in WWE history with 478 days. Demolitions' record stood tall until it was broken by The New Day in 2016. 'Demolition's accomplishments and their historic title reign has not secured them spots in the WWE Hall Of Fame. During an interview with Justin Barrasso of Sports Illustrated, Bill Eadie who is known as 'Ax' of Demolition stated that he believes the only reason that he and 'Smash' (Barry Darsow) have yet to be inducted into the WWE Hall Of Fame is due to their names being tied into the lawsuit against WWE.\n\n\"I’m almost certain it’s because of the lawsuit,” said Eadie. \"It could happen, it might not happen, but Barry and I know that the fans know that Demolition should be in the Hall Of Fame. We have the satisfaction of knowing we should be in there, and the fans tell us that every time we go out to sign.\"\n\nAs mentioned, The New Day broke the team's 27-year record of the longest reigning WWE Tag Team Champions in history. Eadie feels that the breaking of their record was done to eliminate 'Demolition' from the WWE history books.\n\n“That was done to try to eliminate Demolition,” said Eadie. “But we have no control over that or the Hall Of Fame. Perhaps they’ll ask, perhaps they won’t, but we’re not going to lose sleep over it.”"
