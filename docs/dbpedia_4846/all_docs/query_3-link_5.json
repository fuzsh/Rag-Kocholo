        "text": "MavpaPosted on 12/03/04 at 09:46:43\n\nYo,\n\nI used to be big time into TNM. I got 6.2 and all the stuff for it, did that logo design thing, baught TNM 7... got angry that that whole TNM Gold thing never came to pass and then sort of lost interest in TNM has wrestling on TV began to suck.\n\nBut I still would get stuff from the mailing list and would glance at it every once in awhile. So...I read this recent one about how the jump from TNM 7 1rst Edition to the 2nd Edition is AT LEAST as big as from 6.2 to 7.\n\nAt first I thought maybe I had just downloaded the wrong file and still have the first TNM 7, but, there it was...2nd Edition. To me, it seems like exactly the same game. Anytime I try to see what's been changed, it reads like one of my essays from biology class in high school...\n\n\"There are many differences between the old world and new world monkeys...far too many to possibly name here.\"\n\nI'm not trying to be combative or anything, I'm just curious as to what the big deal was. The jump from 6.2 to 7 was huge...I mean, 6.2 used to crash all the time because it was completely Dos based. I don't think you could even use the mouse on it...maybe you could, but still... I see nothing so far that compares to this jump.\n\nSo I openly invite Oliver or anyone on this forum to sell me on the improvements and why I should buy this second edition rather than just haul out my old TNM7 files and fire it back up again.\n\nThanks.Critic of the DawnPosted on 12/03/04 at 17:05:24\n\nTo save you some time, here's the list:\n\nMatches\n\nMatch Types\n\nTag Team Battle Royals\n\nTag Team Elimination Matches\n\nI Quit Matches with corner persons\n\nBattle Royals for titles\n\nThree-way and four-way gimmick matches\n\nHandicap Matches with up to 10 vs 9 wrestlers (added 06/25)\n\nFinishes\n\nNew situations for DQs, double DQs.\n\nIntroduction of no contests.\n\nChampions can use their title belts to get an advantage.\n\nMoves\n\nIllegal non-submission moves.\n\nSpecial moves: \"leads to finisher\" and \"illegal\" checkboxes affect the matches properly in all cases.\n\nReferees\n\nExpanded referee interaction with the combatants.\n\nHeel referees\n\nFace referees\n\nHead referee\n\nReferees can be pulled in the way of a move by heel.\n\nBiased referees and special referees.\n\nStand-by referees in case a referee is bumped and out for a prolonged period of time.\n\nMatch Progression\n\nSeveral new spots inside the matches.\n\nSpots for masked wrestlers.\n\nSpots in Battle Royals\n\nOver-the-top-rope DQs\n\nInjuries are now indicated during the match and may cut it short.\n\nPrematch injuries influence matches.\n\nWrestlers who get in the ring more than once per card will suffer from fatigue and may thus lose matches that they would have won in TNM 7 First Edition\n\nSpots with announcers' table (outside).\n\nMisc\n\nOverall rating for a card will be computed.\n\nDatabases\n\nWrestlers\n\nNew attribute: skinning the cat (holding on to the top rope and pulling oneself back in)\n\nNew attribute: springs up (kip up Ã  la Shawn Michaels / The Rock)\n\nMore sophisticated nickname handling - custom placement of nicknames for ring introductions\n\nReferees\n\nNew attributes: heel, face\n\nNew attribute: head referee\n\nCloning (added 06/25)\n\nYou can now create new wrestler, move, manager, dive, tag team, stable and referee records starting over with stats of an existing entity. Make different versions of the same wrestler for different time periods in the blink of an eye!\n\nBooking\n\nFinishes\n\nAbility to book a wrestler to win via pinfall or submission without specifying how.\n\nBooking a finish without giving a time for it.\n\nBooked finishes will now happen in Falls Count Anywhere matches when the wrestlers are on the outside.\n\nScheduling\n\nSchedule tournaments which are seeded according to the ratings.\n\nSelect the participants for a tournament, then have it seeded according to the ratings (added 06/25).\n\nWhen putting the winners of matches into Battle Royals, teams where one man is injured see the non-injured members inserted into the Battle Royal; if there was a draw leading in to the Battle Royal, it still takes place albeit with fewer wrestlers. TNM 7 First Edition didn't know how to handle this.\n\nAbility to assign specific referee to a certain match.\n\nSpecial referees now have all the attributes regular referees have, including their orientation (face, heel).\n\nCircuit Maintenance\n\nTitles\n\nTitles can be rearranged in a circuit (to shift importance).\n\nLimit on the number of titles has been eliminated.\n\nRosters\n\nPrint roster to file.\n\nHiring And Contracts\n\nBacking out of the hiring process is now possible.\n\n\"-\" key brings up wrestler profile like in booking mode.\n\nWrestlers\n\nWhen changing a wrestler's name, he keeps his win-loss-record now.\n\nHTML Gateway\n\nUnlimited cards starting with the same five characters can correctly be translated into HTML; there was a 255-card limit in TNM 7 First Edition for cards starting with the same five characters.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nCustomization Options (require TNM TweakCirc Second Edition)\n\nConfiguration options for matches\n\nProbabilities for covers inside submission moves\n\nEnable/disable over the top rope DQs.\n\nTurn disqualifications for illegal moves on or off.\n\nInfluencing the pacing of the match:\n\nTime Progression: influence how quickly time goes by; adapts your circuit to the pacing of your choice.\n\nHit Factor: increase or decrease the damage done to wrestlers during matches.\n\nUse these two to increase or decrease the number of moves that can be done in a certain period. Great for creating more slowly-paced circuits or quick highflying circuits.\n\nOverruling whether or not finisher can be done outside of the ring in FCA matches\n\nAllow for title changes despite no-shows - if the champion no-shows, you can have the title up for grabs just as well as if a challenger no-shows.\n\nShould your champions be allowed to have a \"golden way\" of winning when in despair? Turn belt shots during matches on or off, just as you wish.\n\nCards\n\nWrite your notes after every match in addition to after the card; these notes are inserted directly into the match results ! Use this for in-show angles, beatdowns and observations.\n\nTurn these notes on and off as you please.\n\nWant to see your match results only ? No problem. The in-card notes can be switched off when necessary to give you the plain card results you know from TNM 7 First Edition.\n\nHiring and contracts\n\nCard multipliers - contracts in TNM 7 usually run for up to 52 cards; many users prefer to run more than one card per month; the card multiplier indicates how many cards are run every month; a 52-card contract will become a contract for 260 cards if the card multiplier is set to 5 cards per month.\n\nCustomize quitting, giving notice - will it happen only once per month of cards or on every card ?\n\nQueues\n\nView your wrestlers' queues.\n\nModify your wrestlers' queues.\n\nInterference\n\nTurn random interference on and off on a circuit level.\n\nProbability of random interference can be increased/decreased by the user as desired.\n\nHighlight interference during match play-by-play for easier spotting.\n\nMask Spots\n\nTurn them on or off on a circuit level.\n\nConfigure how often they take place in your circuit.\n\nInjuries\n\nOption to turn off injuries completely for your circuit.\n\nConfigure how often injuries occur.\n\nRef Bumps\n\nTurn them on or off in your circuit, your call.\n\nInfluence how likely they are.\n\nScheduling\n\nConfigure booking defaults - you will never have to switch them on or off again for every match:\n\nGeneral\n\nHardcore\n\nCountouts\n\nDisqualifications\n\nNo Time Limit\n\nStandard Time Limit\n\nOutside Interference\n\nBook Match\n\nGimmick Match\n\nAssign Referee\n\nNon-Title Match\n\nTop Contenders Match\n\nTitle Change On DQ/Countout\n\nBan Managers\n\nLoser Leaves Town\n\nAssign Match Name\n\nMatch Viewing\n\nWatch Match\n\nSkip Match\n\nFinish Only\n\nJoin In Progress\n\nType Of Match\n\n1 Fall\n\n2/3 Falls\n\nDeath Match\n\nIron Man Match\n\nKeep Play-By-Play\n\nTitle Matches Despite No-Shows\n\nRatings\n\nIgnore title bonuses in global ratings - makes them more comparable.\n\nGeneration:\n\nAdjust bonuses for wins.\n\nAdjust points deducted for losses.\n\nAdjust bonuses for winning streaks.\n\nAdjust how much titleholders benefit in the ratings.\n\nTime Limits\n\nFor the first time ever, you can control time limits for every match type - and on a circuit level:\n\nSingles Matches\n\nTag Team Matches\n\nX-Person Tag Matches\n\nHandicap Matches\n\nTriangle Matches\n\nFour-Way Matches\n\nWarGames - First Period\n\nWarGames - Other Periods\n\nRoyal Rumble Periods - now in seconds for even greater control\n\n... or assign one time limit for all matches.\n\nYou can choose to combine these time limits with those from the main options menu, i.e.\n\nOne-Fall\n\nTwo-out-of-three Falls\n\nIron Man\n\nDeath Match\n\nSet average match time on circuit level to override the global setting.\n\nEric \"Critic of the Dawn\""
