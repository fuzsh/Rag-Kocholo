        "text": "Post by Deleted on\n\nThanks to the Wrestling Observer Newsletter for the notes\n\nWCW\n\nPost Buyout/WWF business collapse\n\nInvasion\n\n1991 January - April\n\nJan 8, 91\n\n\"Although no announcement has officially been made, it is a virtual certainty that Dusty Rhodes will be the new booker for World Championship Wrestling (and also that in 1991, the name National Wrestling Alliance will virtually disappear from the wrestling industry except for the names of a few championships in Mexico and references to WCW in Japan).\"\n\n\"Rhodes' final house show date with Titan was 12/30, although he's scheduled for one last night of humiliation at the Royal Rumble on 1/19. There are some within WCW who believe Rhodes will actually come on board to book before the Rumble, provided WCW can get a release from Titan Sports on Rhodes. If that doesn't happen, then Rhodes will almost surely start as booker very soon after Jan. 20\"\n\n\"Interesting to see all the tapes of the guys who have left the promotion doing jobs on TBS--Mean Mark, Legion of Doom, Stan Lane, Great Muta, etc. WCW named the Feb. 7 match from Beaumont, Tex. between Ric Flair & Arn Anderson vs. Rock & Roll Express (which aired Feb. 17 on NWA Main Event) as its television match of the year. After seeing it again, you can understand why\"\n\n\"Local TV plugs, as I guess are the case in all cities, simply consist of two quickie line-up rundowns of the show. No interviews, either generic or localized, pertaining to the show even air. At least in New York they have the commentary localized to get the angles over. After two years in this business and using how Vince McMahon sells his arena shows as an example it amazes me that can try to sell shows with virtually no hype\"\n\n\"As of the last word I had, the Steiners still hadn't signed 1991 contracts (current deal comes due within the next two months or so). There were problems because the last contract issued cut their percentage of gimmick sales from 33 percent to 17 percent of net profits and also had a clause that in case of an injury that lasts more than one month that the time period of the contract is put on hold\"\n\n\"The Juicer finished up this week. He's going to have a hard time because he can't work at home in Oregon both because the media pressure would be intense and the commission won't license him, and other national offices won't book him because they'd face the same media pressures if he got a push\"\n\n\"Flair and Windham are bleeding in the final two matches just about every night so they are bringing blood back but only in top matches\"\n\n\"In the commentary on the Zenk-Anderson match they talked of Zenk having a 45 match win streak coming into the match. At Starrcade it was 35, but he was pinned at Starrcade\"\n\n\"The Sunday TBS show had a mention of Doom as former world tag team champions out to regain the belts. These shows were all taped before Starrcade and when the thing didn't happen, they had to erase all mention of the change from the tape. And I guess they got every mention but one.\"\n\n\"Fans have been confused everywhere by Horsemen-Doom because the angle on TV in the limo paints Doom as the heels, but at the house shows Doom works as faces\"\n\n\"The 1/30 TBS Clash of the Champions will take place from \"The Atrium,\" which is the lower level of the CNN Center mall. The CNN Center is the corporate headquarters of all the Turner companies, including WCW. It's got maybe 32 floors or so and from the outside looks similar to a shopping mall. It's located next door to the Omni. The wrestling matches will take place on the level with all the restaurants.\"\n\n\"Inside Edition\" will tape a segment on Michael Wall Street at the Meadowlands card on 1/11 for a February air date. If you can't understand why this character is getting so much mainstream publicity when it is a minor character and thus far hasn't set the world on fire it is because this is a character that the Forbes Magazine types (Forbes is doing something on the character) can relate to\"\n\nJan 14, 91\n\n\"Dusty was announced as booker to the guys Monday night. Magnum T.A. was in as a road agent and the booking team appears to be Rhodes, Windham, Magnum, Grizzly Smith, Kevin Sullivan, Ron West and Jody Hamilton with the latter two more messengers\"\n\nDusty changed Clash main from Flair-Pillman to Flair-Scott Steiner. He's starting a Ron Simmons babyface turn and going to have Anderson and Windham broken into singles wrestlers with Anderson in a three-way program with Zenk and Eaton (tweener) for the TV strap. What about Terry Taylor, are you asking?\n\n\"Dustin is coming\"\n\n\"Bobby Eaton was offered a $156,000 contract for 91-92 plus a $15,000 signing bonus and would also be bumped up from $2,300 to $3,000 per week effective immediately should he sign so very strong chance he's staying, in fact, almost for certain. It's amazing that Eaton is finally getting the respect he's deserved all along, at a time when he's in a role inherently less effective because he doesn't have the manager to make up for his interviews\"\n\n\"WCW heels Kevin Sullivan, Tony Schiavone, Master Blaster Blade, Sid Vicious and Dutch Mantell beat Glow Girls four of five last week (I know, Tony isn't a heel) and supposedly had pity on them in the one they lost. Wonder if the FTC can go after you for not trying your hardest to win on Family Feud?\"\n\n\"Norman got his notice that he's done on 1/30. Juicer also done although he made one last play to get his job back. Minotaur will probably be gone before you read this\"\n\nJan 21, 91\n\n\"July 8, 1990. Baltimore Arena. Sting wins the NWA world heavyweight title from Ric Flair. Fireworks go off. It was supposed to be the end of an era. The Ric Flair era. The 90s were here and the champion of the 80s was said by many who would never admit to it today to being the problem holding back the company. I'm not here to write that some of us knew better. The problem wasn't Ric Flair, the problems, as in multiple plural, went much deeper than that. But in wrestling, the booker and the champion are often scapegoats when the company doesn't do good business\"\n\n\"The audience was more-and-more hardcore. The company calls them heel fans, particularly in the Northeast, but that's a misnomer. They were hardcore fans who cheered for who they thought was either the best performer, or the toughest performer. Even the so-called heel fans rarely booed the likes of The Steiner brothers, Lex Luger and Sting. But Ric Flair generally received a lot of cheers because he was a great performer, as did the Midnight Express and Jim Cornette. So did Sid Vicious, for reasons altogether different. But the die-hard fans, the 2,000 or so in cities like Chicago, Baltimore and Philadelphia that were left over from the near packed houses of a few years back, knew that the main events the past six months couldn't match up to those of the previous several years and also knew the reason why. Despite an intense marketing effort that was almost sad and embarrassing, there really weren't that many \"Little Stingers\" in evidence at the shows\"\n\n\"Realistically, Sting never had a chance. The fact that his return from knee surgery to win the title, a result that was hardly wrestling's best-kept secret, failed to sell out Baltimore, was an unheeded warning sign. Getting a huge pop and drawing huge houses aren't the same thing.\"\n\n\"Probably around late November, with the house show situation reaching a new low, the decision was made to go back to Flair. Whether it be just as an interim to groom Scott Steiner (who from all accounts doesn't want it in the first place and he doesn't want to break up his tag team with his brother) or segue into Lex Luger, or as a longer term while someone else is groomed or while nobody else is groomed and wheels simply spin, Flair was going to get to tie the hallowed record of Harley Race as a seven-time champion\"\n\n\"Originally the change was to occur at Starrcade, with Flair wrestling as the Black Scorpion and winning the title. But Sting didn't want to put Flair over in that scenario. Sting refused since he wanted to finish the Scorpion scenario with a victory in the blow-off. At that point, Barry Windham was moved into the Scorpion spot and Flair moved into a tag team spot on the card. But as it became obvious the company insisted on the change, Sting agreed to do it on Jan. 11 at the Meadowlands. Since he did, Flair agreed to put Sting over, as Scorpion, for Starrcade.\"\n\n\"Barry Windham & Arn Anderson beat Doom in a cage match in just 3:54....This was the match that was billed on television as a title-match....Without even an announcement that this was a non-title match when Windham & Anderson were announced as winners, they simply gave the belts to Doom. Between that and the match lasting under four minutes, they left the crowd feeling ripped-off, even on a card which saw a world title change\"\n\n\"Lex Luger's clothesline at the Meadowlands popped Dangerously's jaw legit\"\n\nJan 28, 91\n\n\"If those of you in the New York area heard a loud unexplained pop at about 9:15 on 1/11, it was Rick Steiners clothesline on Al Greene at the Meadowlands\"\n\n\"Dusty is insisting on them going back to doing localized interviews\"\n\n\"The 1/30 Clash has been moved from CNN Center to Gainesville, GA because of the heavy security surrounding CNN Center right now\n\nFeb 4, 91\n\n\"WCW charged $25, $17 and $10 for tickets and had eight no-shows. As originally reported here, and then denied to me by several in WCW (in this case more due to a lack of communication as anything else), then corrected here last week, but ultimately the original story was true, to save on transportation costs, they decided to leave the undercard guys at home and replace them with locals. Instead of Tom Zenk vs. Bobby Eaton, Terry Taylor vs. Michael Wall Street, Brad Armstrong vs. Moondog and Tim Horner vs. Bill Irwin, we got Jim Gorman vs. Matt Moon, Big Mike Huff vs. Earthquake Ferris, Bill \"Superfoot\" Monroe vs. Johnny Sawyer and Paul Brown vs. \"Mad Dog\" Buzz Sawyer (who got the best crowd pop of the entire card).\"\n\nFeb 11, 91\n\n\"I couldn't believe it when Dusty said Teddy Long was out buying condoms (I'm sure he meant condos, but that's how everyone took his speech)\"\n\n\"Before the show started, they must have had the crowd chant \"Bobby, Bobby\" so when Eaton came out they played a tape of the chant to give the illusion that Eaton was incredibly over. This isn't a bad idea, but in every case I've seen WCW do this (like with Lex Luger when he was a heel) they do it for a heel, which defeats the illusion you are trying to create that the crowd doesn't like the guy.\"\n\n\"Zenk wore his TV title that he had lost weeks earlier and it was billed as a TV title match which I guess totally exposed the business to everyone in Perry, GA and any hardcore fan\"\n\n\"Ranger Ross was booked on the show before the war broke out, originally to come down from the ceiling of the CNN Center but with the move to Gainesville, that stunt was impossible so they booked him to wrestle instead\"\n\n\"The Sid interview was noteworthy because it was the first time in history I've ever seen three different announcers all try to \"steal\" the crowd's interest from a guy doing an interview. Dusty interrupted to get himself over. Tony Schiavone was making faces to steal the crowd's focus from Paul E and even Jim Ross was making faces, seemingly to stay on Dusty's good side\"\n\n\"Only WCW could give away an angle like this. Gary Cappetta announced Taylor as the \"computerized man of the 90s\" some nine minutes before Alexanda York was to show up and \"surprise\" everyone by revealing her affiliation with Taylor\"\n\n\"JFD pinned Sheik (they made the announcement that Sheik had nothing to do with current events in Persian Gulf--awful match)\"\n\n\"They did a gimmick with Doug Dillinger where Big Josh was being taken to jail with handcuffs on for running out of the crowd into the ring and Tommy Rich begs them not to press charges and Josh breaks the handcuffs. Josh acts like a total mark and in the ring pretends to not know how to work at all (Dusty should have saved this role for bringing in Tugboat so the role would be a shoot)\"\n\nFeb 18, 91\n\n\"The Butch Reed-Ron Simmons break-up took place on 2/5 in Gainesville at the TV tapings. Since the show doesn't air until 3/2, the two will be teaming up at the house shows until that point which I guess pretty much gives away the result of the tag team title match in Phoenix\"\n\n\"Advance for Wrestle War in Phoenix is around 1,500 tickets in a 16,000 seater building. WWF is in town the night before in one of those strange coincidences that always seem to happen\"\n\n\"How many of you caught that the clip they used to illustrate one of Rhodes' greatest triumphs ever at the Omni on Saturday was actually a clip from Greensboro (match with Blanchard at Starrcade 86) that he lost?\"\n\nFeb 25, 91\n\n\"This is one for the books. The Steiner Brothers won the world tag team titles from the Freebirds on 2/18 in Montgomery, AL at a TV taping (match will air on WCW Pro on 3/9). I guess that gives away the result of Sunday's match.\"\n\n\"JFD & Ricky Morton & Tommy Rich kept their six-man titles (which they weren't to win for five more days) beating Landel & Eaton & Taylor when Eaton got made at Landel and decked him and Landel was pinned\"\n\n\"Windham pinned Simmons (this was taped for TV, Teddy Long was supposed to be in a cage above the ring but the cage no-showed)\"\n\n\"Ric Flair was hospitalized with third-degree burns when he accidentally had scalding hot coffee spilled on him at a McDonalds. He was supposed to miss about a week but was already back in action a day or two later\"\n\nMar 4, 91\n\n\"Lex Luger won't be appearing against Riki Choshu after all. When Luger negotiated his NWA contract, somehow he made it only valid for the United States and Canada so therefore they had no right to send him to Japan without paying him extra and negotiating a deal.\"\n\n\"The 5/19 PPV show was originally moved from St. Petersburg to Charleston, SC but has been moved back to St. Pete because the building in Charleston had a problem with them using pyrotechnic fireworks during the show\"\n\n\"During Big Josh's matches, the fans chant \"Matt Borne\" at him but he tries to pretend he isn't Matt Borne\"\n\nMar 11, 91\n\n\"Buddy Landel did an interview talking about the title situation as well and called the Steiners the world tag champs, which they don't win on TV for another week\"\n\n\"Barry Windham pinned Ron Simmons by pinning Butch Reed who attacked Simmons (as if that makes any sense at all)\"\n\n\"Steiners beat Freebirds to keep the U.S. tag belts (going on the assumption that we aren't supposed to know Steiners are world champs and have given up the US belts, what sense does it make for the supposed world champs to challenge for the US belts?)\"\n\nMar 18, 91\n\n\"The National got phone calls from readers in Milwaukee wanting to know how Brian Pillman could have been injured on TBS on 2/23 when he worked that afternoon in Milwaukee and wasn't taped up and was fine and also why they said Sting was in Phoenix that day when he was in Milwaukee\"\n\n\"Buddy Landel was fired for apparently blowing snot on a hotel manager on the road\"\n\n\"Flair is no longer being referred to as a seven-time champion. That phrase has been banned from television so if/when a record is set, it will never be acknowledged\"\n\n\"The finishes at the Dome show will be most interesting because the Japanese want pinfalls in the middle with no trunks pulled, no ref bumps, no feet on ropes, in every US vs. Japan match. Supposedly WCW is guaranteed $500,000 for its participation in the show and New Japan doesn't want cheap finishes or bad angles ruining its biggest card of the year.\"\n\nApr 3, 91\n\n\"The Dusty finish strikes Tokyo.\"\n\n\"Fujinami was in his dressing room surrounded by about four dozen photographers shooting a billion shots apiece of him with both belts (My Note: IWGP and WCW). Jim Ross and Tony Schiavone were in another part of the building filming the press conference which no doubt ended with them stripping Fujinami of the belt.\"\n\n\"Just about every reporter thought this was a legit world title change except for the few who knew English and had travelled and seen this finish before at Starrcade '85.\"\n\n\"After the show was a sayonara party at a night club in another part of town. Flair continually called Fujinami \"champ\" and there wasn't even any hint of controversy. Friday morning's Nikkan Sports came out and the entire front page of the newspaper was devoted to Fujinami becoming the 75th NWA world champion (NWA means a lot in Japan, WCW means nothing so it was continually called NWA world championship).\"\n\n\"The story that Flair had left Japan with the belt hit the papers on Saturday afternoon. At the storyline in Japan goes, after the sayonara party, at midnight, Dusty Rhodes and Barry Windham (who are the heels in this \"controversy\" in Japan) went to Seiji Sakaguchi and told him the result of the match is a no contest and that Flair was still the champion.\"\n\n\"The story gets even funnier here, as according to the Tokyo Sports story on Saturday, a reporter, who must have figured out what was going to happen, talked with Bill Alphonso and asked him who won and Alphonso said that Fujinami won. So now you've got both refs agreeing with the decision when the original story I'd heard that it was supposed to be all along was the American ref would say Flair won and the Japanese ref would say Fujinami won.\"\n\n\"The reason they didn't just do the Dusty finish as it's done in the U.S. is because of the fear of doing that screw-job would have ended up with the place rioting, which probably is what would have happened. So they did the Verne Gagne and sent the fans home thinking it was a title change until two days later they read the real story in the newspaper.\"\n\n\"So as the story goes, Fujinami is recognized as NWA world champion in Japan. Flair is recognized as NWA world champion and has the belt in the United States. And the two have a rematch on 5/19 in St. Petersberg, FL to rectify the situation.\"\n\nApr 8, 91\n\n\"Sid, who is under contract with WCW until September 1st, gave notice this past week that he wanted to leave the company effective May 31\"\n\n\"In the dressing room this past week, Vicious was said to have complained that he'd done more jobs than Tim Horner\"\n\n\"As of this weekend, on the WCW line-up sheet for the 5/19 SuperBrawl PPV show from St. Petersburg, the Vicious vs. El Gigante stretcher match had a question mark by it.\"\n\n\"This shouldn't surprise anyone by this time but apparently the WWF booked the USF Sundome in Tampa (across town from St. Pete) on--you guessed it-- 5/18. And this will continue to happen until WCW comes up with a retaliation plan\"\n\n\"WWF booked Chicago head-to-head in October, the Meadowlands head-to-head with Nassau in January (both said to be purely coincidences), Phoenix the day before and now Tampa\"\n\nApr 15, 91\n\n\"The split between Sid Vicious and World Championship Wrestling appears to have been reconciled\"\n\nApr 22, 91\n\n\"Forget last weeks headlines. Sid Vicious is bolting WCW for the WWF. The word came in the middle of this past week when the contract that both sides had agreed upon the previous week was drawn up and presented to Vicious, who then gave his notice once again effective after the 5/19 PPV show in St. Petersburg\"\n\nApr 29, 91\n\n\"The latest on Sid Vicious is that he's been pulled by WCW from all previously scheduled house show dates except for the 5/19 PPV show.

The official word was faxed Monday afternoon by Jim Herd to Flair's attorney, Dennis Guthrie, in Charlotte, that Flair's contract is being terminated effective August 1, 1991. Flair was scheduled to drop the WCW title to Barry Windham on 7/1 in Macon, GA in a revised plan decided upon within the past week that had been the subject of many behind-the-scenes problems. WCW officials weren't expecting Flair to show up to Macon (he was originally scheduled to be on vacation until Wednesday's show at the Meadowlands but was given the word last week to be in Macon). The revised plan was for Windham to defend the title against Lex Luger in Baltimore, with Windham's title victory airing on TBS either this coming Saturday night or the day before the Baltimore show.\"\n\n\"I guess it can be reported here that the original plan was for Flair to drop the title to Luger in Baltimore. The hang-up was that the two sides haven't been able to come to terms on a contract extension that had been verbally agreed upon seemingly forever. WCW offered Flair $350,000 per year, which would cut his current salary in half or slightly more than in half. According to Flair, as quoted in the Miami Herald in Wednesday's paper, WCW asked Flair to have his salary cut in half effective immediately. Other reports are that WCW wanted Flair to agree to terminate his existing contract and sign a new contract at $350,000 per year, but TBS sources say the disagreement was over the extension and that no major cut in pay was requested for the period covered by the current contract, which was to expire on May 31, 1992. Flair wasn't willing to take such a massive pay cut for the extension period to begin with, plus there is the ego involved in earning far less than Lex Luger (who will earn $600,000 next year, which politically, is a key reason why the company decided to make him champion because they have to be able to justify that huge contract) and also less than Sting.\"\n\n\"The 7/1 television taping in Macon, GA before a packed house of 4,700 (tapings are heavily padded) was supposed to be the most eventful taping of the year, complete with a world title change. But instead it was only eventful for an announcement made by Gary Cappetta that Flair was stripped of the title, which drew great applause\"\n\n\"Whether this was true or not, certainly there were a lot of people that expected Flair's role after losing the title would be to put over Dustin Rhodes.\"\n\n\"The official story on Dan Spivey is that in a tag team match in Chicago, he was asked to put Zenk over (it was Zenk & Rick Steiner vs. Stan Hansen & Spivey) and refused, which caused a backstage argument. Actually they should have understood his position, because he and Hansen are world tag team champions in Japan so they couldn't very well do a job in the U.S. for anyone, let alone Zenk & Rick Steiner. He was then asked to put P.N. News over every night and, well, that was the end of that job\"\n\n\"The original plan was for Luger to defend the title against Mr. Hughes as the headline match of Halloween Havoc\"\n\n\"Everyone has to work overtime in the studio this week because all syndication has been taped through the end of July, including references to Bash finishes. Instead, all references to Bash finishes have to be edited out of the late July shows, and all references to Flair also have to be edited out.\"\n\n\"WCW lost approximately $6,465,000 in 1990\"\n\nJuly 15, 91\n\n\"Among the readers of this newsletter, there is no wrestler as popular as Ric Flair. He's been named the readers' favorite wrestler for the past seven years, or ever since we started tabulating votes annually in that category. He's also been named Wrestler of the Year by Observer readers seven times in the past nine years. It is very easy to take Ric Flair's side in what is being called a contract dispute but is really a lot more than that. On one side we have arguably the best wrestler in the history of the business. On the other side we have a company that has, quite frankly, done a miserable job in promoting pro wrestling since it purchased Jim Crockett Promotions in 1988\"\n\n\"We really have to go back more than a year to Chicago when Flair was supposed to drop the title to Lex Luger in late March of 1990 and refused to do so. There were many factors involved in that decision, but Flair was negotiating to get a contract extension and/or a contract release which would allow him to go to the WWF is he wanted to before he'd drop the title. When Flair finally lost the title to Sting in July at the Bash, Jim Herd refused to give Flair a contract release, although there were plenty of negotiations regarding a contract extension through June of 1994. What was agreed upon was that if a contract extension hadn't been agreed to by a certain date, a date of which I'm not sure but has probably just recently passed, that either side would have the right to terminate the current contract of $14,000+ per week given 30 days notice. This was the escape clause Flair wanted, because it would give him the option to leave for the WWF, which he didn't have one year ago, which ultimately is why the much-talked-about Ric Flair vs. Hulk Hogan main event at the last Wrestlemania never took place.\"\n\n\"Although Jim Herd told me personally that Flair had an escape clause and that WCW didn't in regard to the current contract, which went through June 1, 1992, as all the details became sorted out this past week, obviously the company had an escape clause as mentioned above and exercised it. According to several sources, the story is that WCW gave notice that they were going to terminate the current contract on August 1st, and that they were attempting to re-sign Flair to a new contract for three years (which would call for Flair to earn figures rumored to be $350,000 this year, $350,000 next year and $250,000 the year after). According to one WCW official, the new figures, which represented a major pay cut for Flair, were fair because the company was going to cut back in the number of dates Flair would be asked to work.\"\n\n\"The money offered is far less than the $500,000-per-year offer made to Randy Savage to jump from the WWF within the past five weeks, which Savage turned down (my feeling on this, without knowing for sure, is that any WWFer is going to be wary of WCW offers because the company has established a bad reputation among WWF wrestlers, whether fair or not, based on its negotiations with Ricky Steamboat, Tully Blanchard, Bret Hart, Arn Anderson and others in regards to honesty in dealing with contract negotiations).\"\n\n\"There was openly talked about fear within WCW that Flair was going to hold the company up for a better deal on his 1992-94 extension before agreeing to drop the title to Lex Luger at the Bash this coming Sunday. That is why, at least on the surface, for the abrupt change in the championship plans for Flair to drop the title on 7/1 in Macon, GA to Barry Windham (who, ironically, doesn't even have a WCW contract). This change gave WCW a way to avoid a possible major embarrassment and to alleviate fears of Flair no-showing a PPV main event. So in order to avoid a possible major embarrassment, the company set up a situation that virtually guaranteed a major embarrassment.\"\n\n\"No matter whose fault it may have been, he was stale in fans' eyes. A marketing business needs fresh new faces to keep things looking new. When the best actor in the world has been around for a long time playing the same role, even if he's still the best actor, he may still not get as many leads as guys who can't carry his jock, so to speak, as an actor, but are fresher and younger faces. While one can argue that WCW didn't treat Flair fairly, or even that part of the problem in Flair appearing stale was how he was portrayed, was Ric Flair worth $750,000 in revenue to WCW over the next year?\"\n\n\"To the credit of WCW, they have made no attempt at all to \"bury\" Flair nor have they tried to hide that Flair is no longer with the organization or pretend that he never existed.\"\n\n\"Another Ross comment on NWA Pro New York regarding the brutality of the War Games is that \"it's not like those cage matches where the object is to run away.

You can see just how big a threat Titan sees WCW as being today when they devote so much television time to an angle with a guy who has given notice and can actually leave before ever doing the angle, although I'd give you long odds against WCW being able to pull the trigger on this deal since they haven't on any other big ones yet....The Rockers also gave notice on Tuesday, but the same goes for them.\"\n\n\"Did you notice on television when WCW did a skit surrounding Ron Simmons with kids that all the kids were black (and not particularly snappily dressed) but when the WWF did something similar with Virgil, all the kids were white and dressed like kids of yuppie parents. I'm not trying to insinuate which is better or worse, just that the difference was so marked in how each group pushes what, in reality is, its token black star\"\n\n\"I have no explanation for this, but this weekend was said everywhere to have been the week where the WCW Pro New York show switched from WPIX on Saturday morning at 9 a.m. to WCBS on Saturday night at 12:30 a.m. Most everyone in the company went under that assumption and the localized voice-overs were done with that in mind. Well, lo and behold, the show aired on WPIX, the old station, despite the previous week them making a big deal about it being their last show on the station. Not only that, but there were frequent references to it being Saturday night and being on the new station\"\n\n\"One Man Gang is officially fired over not doing the job for P.N. News last week\"\n\n\"They are going to keep the concept of the Chamber of Horrors match as a mystery until the match itself. They are actually trying to sell a card on mystery, a mystery as to who The Creatures and the Phantom are and why Windham is on the heel side, etc. Mystery did draw one good TV rating of a Clash for Sting vs. Scorpion, but that show was also free. Mystery drew a poor PPV buy rate with Sting vs. Scorpion\"\n\nOct 9, 91\n\n\"The New York situation has been straightened out with the show on every Saturday night on WCBS. There was miscommunication between whomever inked the deal and everyone else as to the date of the station switch so everyone in the company thought it was a week earlier than it really was\"\n\n\"Scott Steiner got 36 stitches in his shoulder in a chainsaw accident, but I don't believe it'll be a factor in slowing his return to the ring\"\n\n\"Apparently the original finish in the Chamber of Horrors match at Havoc was to be One Man Gang losing the fall by getting \"electrocuted\" by one of the special effects gimmicks. The electrocution wouldn't injure or kill Gang, but cause him to get amnesia and he would come back thinking he was Reverend Billy Bright and be a character babyface, but obviously none of this is going to happen\"\n\nOct 14, 91\n\n\"The reason for this big push for Kazmaier is, and this isn't made up, that Luger vs. Kazmaier is going to headline shows in early November including the card at the Forum in Los Angeles and probably the show in San Jose as well\"\n\n\"The 10/12 show at the Omni will draw one of the largest crowds of the year because they are giving 3,500 tickets away. Paid advance as of Monday was less than 900\"\n\nOct 21, 91\n\n\"A group called American Championship Wrestling drew 600 on 10/12 in Winston-Salem, NC (crowd noteworthy because it was more than WCW drew the next night at the Greensboro Coliseum)\"\n\n\"Ranger Ross and the NAACP are making noise about WCW's character of Private Todd Champion since Ross is a legitimate military man, unlike Champion, but he didn't get the spot with the claim being it was because he's black and Champion isn't\"\n\n\"Lots of heat with the boys on the push Van Hammer is getting. For example, at the Omni on Saturday night, they announced the next show for Thanksgiving as the opening night of the Van Hammer tour. I believe the main event will be Luger vs. Rick Steiner. Anyway, there was a backstage prank where someone put vaseline on Hammer's guitar strap, so when he was swinging it around, it got out of control and popped him in the eye so he got a black eye\"\n\n\"Additional heat in regards to Hammer since he changed his plane flight and he and Badd (who are roommates) both arrived late for Kansas City on Thursday night, which is why Hammer worked so late in the show and Badd never worked. Then Sunday night in Greensboro, they changed plane flights from Atlanta and both missed the card\"\n\n\"Lots of problems regarding ticket stips in St. Louis. To boost the lagging advance, it was announced on television two weeks before the show that kids 12-and-under would be admitted free with a paying adult. While it added some to the crowd, it also brought a lot of complaints to the box office among those who had already purchased tickets for themselves and their kids-under-12 wanting a refund\"\n\n\"10/13 at the Greensboro Coliseum drew just 430 fans and $5,000 (both all-time lows for pro wrestling in the 32-year history of wrestling in the building)\"\n\n\"The Screaming Eagles (Freebirds) angle with the Enforcers just didn't work right, not that it's a bad idea, but when you do an angle like that, the team under the hood pulling the surprise can't get pinned cleanly and then still try and take the match around at the house shows\"\n\nOct 28, 91\n\n\"10/17 in Baltimore drew 1,000 (the all-time low in the building)\"\n\n\"The same crew drew about 820 paid in Philadelphia, which is actually up from the last month show there but still the WWF outdrew them 11-to-1 on the same day with Flair vs. Piper\"\n\n\"The Chamber of Horrors is just going to be the Thunderdome cage from Halloween Havoc in 1989 with a few minor alterations. The problem is that WCW no longer has Tommy Young or Keiji Muto, so this time when they turn on the juice, if the thing catches fire, they may burn down half of Chattanooga. \"\n\nNov 4, 91\n\n\"Van Hammer pinned Doug Somers in 1:12 with a slingshot suplex. Hammer only missed three of the five moves he tried\"\n\nNov 11, 91\n\n\"There were also complaints voiced within the cable industry at the card, including a letter from Request TV to WCW. The complaints were directed at the excessive blood (eight men bled during the show, although two of them were unintentional) and they wanted better explanation beforehand of all future gimmick matches because of the generally poor response to the Chamber of Horrors match.\"\n\n\"Steve Austin & Arn Anderson beat Dustin Rhodes & Bobby Eaton (Austin still had the TV title). Eaton made a full-fledged turn on Rhodes, giving him a shoulderbreaker and walked out of the ring and Austin pinned Rhodes, which is Dustin's first job in nearly one year\"\n\nNov 18, 91\n\n\"Mr. Hughes working against main event talent, Rick Steiner in particular, with his sunglasses on and with those glasses not breaking exposes the business worse than almost anything\"\n\n\"The 11/6 card at the Forum in Los Angeles drew a $14,000 house so the paid attendance was just under 1,000.\"\n\n\"Hammer pinned Terrence Taylor in 11:30 (the first 4:30 consisted of one armdrag, hiplock, punch and bodyslam and then it got worse. Whenever you feel like life isn't being fair to you, just think if you were Terry Taylor. Taylor tried to wet nurse him through this match but after 5:00 of stalling to carry him, it fell apart)\"\n\nNov 25, 91\n\n\"There was serious consideration given last week to putting the WCW belt on Rick Steiner at the Clash. Apparently Lex Luger's contract (running from March-to-March) specifies a certain number of live dates and he'd been booked so heavily over the first eight months of the year that at his present pace, whatever the number is, he'd reach it just about by the end of the year. So in order to keep him working the major towns until the new fiscal year of the contract, Luger is being pulled from all smaller shows.\"\n\n\"Luger refused to work the England tour since it wasn't covered by his contract and there was heat regarding that.\"\n\nDec 2, 91\n\n\"Hot matches aren't what this business is about in 1991, but the combination of returns of Steamboat, Abdullah the Butcher and Cactus Jack with Paul E. Dangerously being recast as a manager and Rick Rude coming in as a top singles heel have started the face-lifting process WCW has so badly needed. TV ratings have made a comeback to the point WCW is consistently outrating the WWF on cable, reversing a trend where the WWF had dominated the cable ratings all summer.\"\n\n\"Big Josh pinned Thomas Rich in 6:03 in a lumberjack match. The Young Pistols, who had yet to turn on television, acted as heel lumberjacks and worked over Josh when he was out of the ring\"\n\n\"The week before the show, WCW contacted the WWF and told them of their intention to use Steamboat at the Clash and requested that if the WWF believed they had any legal claim to Steamboat to please contact them by Friday. Steamboat had signed a two-year contract with Titan Sports which expires around January 4, 1993, although one could certainly make a case that being fired should nullify the contract....Anyway, less than an hour before showtime, Titan sent a fax to the WCW offices in Atlanta (when everyone of importance was already in Savannah for the Clash) claiming they had the legal rights to Steamboat. The word did reach the building before the show and Kip Frye (WCW legal counsel) met with Jim Herd and Jim Crockett and the decision was made to use Steamboat\"\n\n\"In what came off as pretty sleazy on TV, they announced later that a protest had been filed and that the Enforcers were claiming since Steamboat wasn't on the original contract that they should get the belts back. They teased that they've had a decision at the end of the show but then went off the air telling people they'd have to call the 900 number to find out what the decision was.\"\n\n\"Madusa came out, got on her knees (luckily I have no idea what they were trying to symbolize), was pawing at Sting for a while and otherwise distracting him to allow Lex Luger to then jump out of the cabin and clip Sting from behind. Lex grabbed the wrong leg to work on (he should be forgiven, all that Lucha Libre experience made Lex inadvertently grab the right leg) and Sting had to practically tell him to switch legs, which he did.\"\n\n\"Most of this match was only on half the screen as they were showing Sting going out in an ambulance to the nearest \"medical facility\" with Bobby Eaton telling him he has \"plenty of time\" which was a very subtle way of starting the Eaton turn.\"\n\n\"Rude and Dangerously were in the ring ready to be awarded the match via forfeit when Sting, who had hijacked an ambulance from Parts Unknown Medical Center back to the Savannah Civic Center arrived just in the nick of time.\"\n\n\"Muta was apparently going to be Rhodes' secret partner for the Clash in the event that the Steamboat deal didn't come off.\"\n\n\"Most people seem to be crediting a lot of the positive changes in the company to the greater influence of Jim Crockett. Crockett has been saying things that make sense for the better part of the past three years but nobody has been listening, and over the past few weeks they've been.\"\n\n\"They had a tag match with Badd & P.N. News (who will become a regular team which I guess guarantees Badd doesn't get over too much aka threaten Dustin Rhodes' spot on the babyface totem pole)\"\n\n\"Nearly an ultimate disaster on Monday as Lex Luger quit the promotion as a protest because WCW fired Harley Race. The last word I heard is that everything has been worked out, although Luger did miss the 11/25 television tapings in Macon, GA because it wasn't resolved in time\"\n\nDec 9, 91\n\n\"Lex Luger is clearly staying (he's under contract for a long time) and will be working the England tour as well. Luger's quitting last week, apparently because of the decision to drop Race, lasted maybe an hour or two\"\n\nDec 16, 91\n\n\"Dallas Page beat Johnny Rich in what I was told was a must-see singles match which was said to be easily the worst match of the year and Rich seemingly wound up with a broken nose from a clothesline too high and Page did a high knee but the toe of his boot caught Rich in the groin\"\n\n\"I'm not making this one up. Michael Hayes & Jimmy Garvin and The Bad Street Band have a concert on 12/20 at Center Stage\"\n\nDec 23, 91\n\n\"WCW has also moved the SuperBrawl '92 show, which will take place February 29, 1992, from the Taj Mahal in Atlantic City to a 6,000 seat Hall in Milwaukee. The move was because WCW needed one day to set up the show, and Donald Trump himself insisted on booking the building on February 28 for a one-on-one basketball game between Kareem-Abdul Jabber and Julius Erving (which may never even take place)\"\n\n\"The first match was a submit or surrender match between P.N. News and Mr. Hughes. For some unexplained reason, one of the Young Pistols came to ringside to cheer on News and then Harley Race hit him, grabbed his towel, and threw it in the ring costing News the match. Later in the show the Pistols did a heel interview. They made several references in the interview to being from the South. Later, before their title match win over the Patriots (how long ago was that match taped?), they were announced as being from Wyoming. The last time I checked, Wyoming wasn't in the South. So on one television show, WCW had the Young Pistols as both babyfaces and heels and from the North and from the South.\"\n\n\"Patriots-Pistols tag title change was pretty bad. They mixed up signals because on Saturday they talked about the title change as having already taken place and the rematch would be on Sunday, but the bout that aired on Sunday was the title change match.\""
