Early in his career he was known as Krusher Khrushchev, a Russian powerhouse who held the NWA World Tag Team Title with partnet, Ivan Koloff. Also defeated Sam Houston for the NWA Mid-Atlantic Title at Starcade '85. After arriving in the WWF, with partner Ax (Bill Eadie), they were managed briefly by Johnny Valiant, and most memorably by Mr. Fuji. Ax and Smash were known as Demolition. They held the WWF Tag Team Title on 3 occaisions, defeating the teams of Strike Force, The Brain Busters, and the Colossal Connection. Eventually Ax retired, and was replaced by Crush (Brian Adams). The duo lost their tag titles to The Hart Foundation. After splitting up Smash became known as the Repo Man. Later on he journeyed to WCW as the Black Top Bully, before being known as his real name, Barry Darsow."
