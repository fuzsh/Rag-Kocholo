        "text": "The 1990 Survivor Series is best remembered for the spectacular debut of WWE’s Thanksgiving mascot, The Gobbledy Gooker, and some guy named the Undertaker, who had an okay career by most people’s standards.\n\nBut following the appearance of an inquisitive sign that popped up during Austin Theory’s entrance at WWE Payback, old-school fans such as this writer have been asking the same question that once vexed us 33 years ago.\n\nWhy was Ax’s hair so nice at Survivor Series ‘90?\n\nCompeting on The Perfect team with captain Mr. Perfect and his Demolition partners, Smash and Crush, the three-time WWE Tag Team Champion came to the ring with a flawless hairstyle fans were not accustomed to seeing from the brute. Instead of having his hair slicked back, Ax showed up with his mane spruced up as if he were going to a wedding. It was a stark departure from his typical look, and now we know why.\n\nSpeaking to James Romero of Wrestling Shoot Interviews, Ax revealed it was his subtle way of saying goodbye.\n\n“You know that hit the, what is it Instagram and Twitter and all that, and my daughter even (notified me). She said, ‘Dad, there’s something all over the internet about your hair.’\n\n“That was my last night with the office. I’d given my notice, I picked up my papers, I got my pencils, I got my stapler, I got my briefcase, I’m walking out of the building. That’s what happened. I didn’t want to put the goop in my hair.”\n\nFrom 1988 through 1990, Demolition, comprised of Ax and Smash, real names Bill Eadie and Barry Darsow, respectively, dominated the World Wrestling Federation (now WWE) unlike any team before them. Though they were quickly labeled Road Warrior wannabes, the destructive duo soon shed that label after winning the tag team titles and having an excellent series of matches with teams like The Hart Foundation, The Rockers, and the British Bulldogs.\n\nWhile in their third tag title reign in 1990, Eadie suffered a medical scare involving his heart that he said was brought on by an accumulation of iron in his system after years of going to Japan and eating shellfish. It happened while he was on a date with his wife. After eating shrimp and lobster sauce at their favorite Chinese place, Eadie and his wife were on their way to the movies when he felt a tingle and then a burning sensation from his neck up.\n\nEadie stepped outside, where he collapsed on an incoming patron. He said he had an out-of-body experience where he could see his wife holding his head. As he peacefully felt himself rising, he said he could hear in the distance someone say that there was no pulse and they couldn’t get a blood pressure.\n\nHe eventually felt himself return to his body, though he didn’t move. Eadie said a doctor later suggested he get a pacemaker but gave him medication to start. He said that what they did was jumpstart his heart.\n\nWhile he was in the hospital, Eadie spoke with Vince McMahon. Rather than give him and Darsow a few weeks off, McMahon decided to bring in a third member, Crush. Eadie said he was supposed to transition into an office role, presumably as an agent, but what he was promised wasn’t the reality.\n\n“The promise I had for the position kept getting less and less and less from full-time position and full-time pay to part-time position and part-time pay. So, why am I going to stay there and beg for a job when I could get on a phone and go where I wanted to go and do what I wanted to do?”\n\nThe full shoot interview has yet to be uploaded as of this publication. But clips from WSI’s interview with Eadie, where he also talks about why he and Darsow didn’t go to WCW and who were the worst road agents, are available to listen to on WSI’s YouTube page.\n\nIn the meantime, one of wrestling’s great mysteries has been solved thanks to a sign from one curious fan.\n\nWhich makes me wonder: what burning question from a probing mat buff with a sign would you like answered, Cagesiders? Let’s hear it in the comments section."
