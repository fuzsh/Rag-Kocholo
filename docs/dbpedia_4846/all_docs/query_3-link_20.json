        "text": "Welcome guys, gals, and gender non-binary pals, to Ask 411 Wrestling. I am your party host, Ryan Byers, and I am here to answer some of your burning inquiries about professional wrestling.\n\nIf you have one of those queries searing a hole in your brain, feel free to send it along to me at [email protected]. Don’t be shy about shooting those over – the more, the merrier.\n\nHey, ya want a banner?\n\nI’ve been told I should promote my Twitter account more. So, go follow me on Twitter.\n\nEverybody loves to see a question from Tyler from Winnipeg:\n\nIs the Undertaker being on WWE’s Mount Ruthmore a given?\n\nNo, because even though he had a legendary career that 99% of wrestlers should envy, Undertaker was never really the guy to carry the company, which in my mind is a prerequisite to be on a wrestling promotion’s Mt. Rushmore.\n\nWWE’s Mt. Rushmore is really Bruno Sammartino, Hulk Hogan, Steve Austin, and the Rock.\n\nJonFW2 is still trying to find himself:\n\nIn the mid-90’s, WWE had TWO performers who wrestled in the same era as three distinct characters who were never acknowledged as being the same performer.\n\nThey were Glen Jacobs- as Isaac Yankem, Fake Diesel, and of course Kane; and Fatu- as Fatu (in various incarnations), The Sultan, and Rikishi.\n\nWho else has wrestled for the same company as three (or more) different characters who were never acknowledged as the same performer?\n\nThere’s quite a few of these, actually. I’m sure that I didn’t make a comprehensive list, and readers can feel free to add to this in the comments.\n\nBill Eadie immediately comes to mind. In the 1980s WWF, he was originally a contender to Bob Backlund’s championship as the Masked Superstar. A couple of years later, he went from Masked Superstar to Super Machine in the faux Japanese Machines stable. Finally, the very next year, he put on some studded leather and became Demolition Ax. Also, though not nearly as prominent or well remembered, he did have two matches between his Masked Superstar and Super Machine runs as Bolo, which was the name he used when he was one of the Mongols in NJPW, Crockett Promotions, and other non-WWF territories.\n\nSpeaking of Demolition, let’s talk about Randy Colley. He was Moondog Rex in the WWF for many years, wrestling one match as masked enhancement talent Dr. X during that run. He was then the original Demolition Smash for a handful of matches before being replaced by Barry Darsow, reportedly because he was too recognizable as a Moondog. After that, he put on a mask and wrestled as the Assassin, shortly thereafter being placed in another tag team called the Shadows alongside former Conquistador Jose Luis Rivera.\n\nOh, that reminds me, Jose Luis Rivera wrestled under his own name, as a Conquistador, and as a Shadow.\n\nAnother contender: Steve Lombardi. He wrestled for many years in the WWF under his real name before becoming the Brooklyn Brawler, though that gimmick change doesn’t count for these purposes because they were acknowledged as being the same person. However, in subsequent years, he would transform into Kamala’s handler Kim Chee, striking baseball player Abe “Knuckleball” Schwartz (also briefly known as MVP), a Doink, and a one-off appearance as the Black Knight at the 1993 Survivor Series.\n\nSteve Keirn was another Doink in the WWF, he was also Skinner, and he even had a couple of matches for the WWWF under his given name in the late 1970s.\n\nFinally, you’ve got the Headbangers. In addition to that gimmick, they were the Sisters of Love for a time on Shotgun Saturday night, and they wrestled a handful of WWF matches, including one on an early episode of Monday Night Raw, a the masked Spiders, which was their regular gimmick on the indies before becoming the Headbangers.\n\nIt’s also worth noting that in some instances these multiple gimmicks not recognized as the same person initially but then gain recognition retroactively. For example, Shinobi, Avatar, and Leif Cassidy were never acknowledged as being the same person until Al Snow introduced the Head/JOB Squad gimmick in ECW and part of the character became frustration with his prior booking. Something similar happened in latter day WCW with Barry Darsow, where his Krusher Kruschev, Blacktop Bully, and Mr. Hole in One gimmicks were kept separate initially only to later be portrayed as a multiple personality disorder of sorts. (Darsow, of course, was also Demolition Smash and the Repo Man in the WWF, though WCW obviously couldn’t use those names.) Dolph Ziggler was also kept separate from Kerwin White’s caddy Nick Nemeth and Nicky of the Spirit Squad for a while, though they were eventually brought up when Ziggler’s opponents wanted something to hold over his head.\n\nShaun is the only person to turn his back on the Wolfpac without winding up in a body bag:\n\nWhy has there never been a Kevin Nash WWE DVD released?\n\nMy assumption is that it’s because every Kevin Nash match worth watching was against somebody who made a better subject for a DVD, like a Bret Hart or a Shawn Michaels.\n\nThat being said, even though there was never a WWE DVD focused on Nash, WCW did release a VHS tape called Kevin Nash: The Outsider in 1999 which featured clips of his matches from the nWo debut through his January 4, ’99 bout against Hulk Hogan.\n\nSadly, the tape did not include anything from his runs as a Master Blaster or Vinnie Vegas, which I guess ties back into the prior question about multiple gimmicks.\n\nDid you hear the one about Craig?\n\nDoes the Jeff Hardy versus Sting match from the 2011 Victory Road PPV hold the record of having the shortest PPV main event (last match of the card) to date?\n\nLong-time readers of the column will know that I strongly disagree with the erroneous notion that the last match on a card is automatically the main event. However, I’ve written about that enough and don’t feel like going into it again here.\n\nThat being said, Sting/Hardy is not the shortest final match of a pay per view. I have not cataloged them all, but one I immediately thought of which was shorter was Hulk Hogan versus Yokozuna in the closing match of Wrestlemania IX, which saw the Hulkster pin Yoko for the WWF Championship in just 21 seconds.\n\nMeanwhile, the showdown between the Stinger and the Inebriated Enigma has an official match time of 1 minute, 28 seconds.\n\nAaron is busting my brain:\n\nI hope you can clear up some things about my favorite tag team, the Midnight Express.\n\nIn the summer of 1988, Jim Cornette starts talking about challenging Arn Anderson and Tully Blanchard for the NWA tag titles. One day, I’m watching one of the syndicated shows when they say the Express won the titles. According to Wikipedia, they won them at a house show on September 10. Arn and Tully soon showed up on WWF television, so I presume they lost just as their contracts expired. But Wikipedia also says there was a Clash of Champions on September 7.\n\nFirst, why did the titles change on a house show and not national TV? Second, a bootleg video of the match on YouTube shows the Express winning despite Bobby Eaton being the illegal man. Why not a clean win if Arn and Tully were leaving?\n\nThe reason that Anderson and Blanchard didn’t drop the championships at the September 7, 1988 Clash of the Champions is twofold. First off, they weren’t booked on the show, so you would have to have changed the planned card to get a tag title match on it. Second, nobody knew there was any potential need to change the card to do the tag title match on it, because, as of September 7, 1988, nobody knew that the two wrestlers were leaving the company.\n\n“But wait,” you might say, “wouldn’t management know there was a chance of them leaving because their contracts were getting ready to expire?”\n\nOh, you sweet summer child.\n\nThis was actually still in the era where iron clad, guaranteed talent contracts in wrestling were not universal. Anderson and Blanchard’s contracts were not getting ready to expire because they didn’t HAVE contracts that could expire.\n\nThe fact that they didn’t have contracts was actually part of the reason they departed. According to Anderson and Blanchard on an episode of the Conrad Thompson-hosted ARN podcast a couple of years ago, they had a lot of frustrations with Jim Crockett Promotions at the time, one of which was that they saw key talent getting locked up in guaranteed deals as the Crocketts prepared to sell the company to Ted Turner (thereby creating WCW) and nobody bothered to offer them one.\n\nAccording to the same podcast episode, after getting good and pissed off at the promotion in the days after Clash of the Champions, Tully told them that he was leaving and that they had a choice. They could either have him lose the titles on September 9 in Houston or they could have him lose the titles on September 10 in Philadelphia. The promotion opted for September 10 in Philadelphia, and the rest is history.\n\nTo sum it all up, the title change seemed abrupt because it was abrupt and brought on by the fact that the promotion was effectively given the choice of doing it on the spot or never being able to do it at all and having to vacate the straps.\n\nMoving on to the second part of Aaron’s question, I cannot find any explanation as to why the titles changed with the illegal man getting the pin. I can only guess that, because this was a house show match that was never meant to see the light of day, the wrestlers just weren’t paying that close of attention to who was legal.\n\nBig Al can punt a baby like nobody’s business:\n\nOne of the worst angles in WWE history was when Gene Snitsky debuted in 2004 and hit Kane with a chair causing him to fall onto Lita and causing a miscarriage. I was disgusted by this but wondered if Snitsky was supposed to be main roster talent after that or he did just become as “popular” as he did because of the angle and his catchphrase “it wasn’t my fault?”\n\nAccording to an interview that Snitsky did with WWE.com for a 2014 “Where Are They Now?” article, he was not intended to be a part of the main roster after his initial appearance. He was supposed to head back to developmental and, in fact, the choice to use him on the next episode of Monday Night Raw was so last minute that he couldn’t get a commercial flight and the company’s private jet had to be chartered for him instead.\n\nBA is taking some big swings:\n\nI want to know the following by decade. I am asking you so use your best, preferred definition of “best.” Also, use your best definition of a decade. Are the 1900s 1901-1910 or 1900-1909? Your choice.\n\nWho is the best wrestler of the 1900s?\n\nFrank Gotch\n\nWho is the best wrestler of the 1910s?\n\nJoe Stecher\n\nWho is the best wrestler of the 1920s?\n\nEd “Strangler” Lewis\n\nWho is the best wrestler of the 1930s?\n\nJim Londos\n\nWho is the best wrestler of the 1940s?\n\nJim Londos\n\nWho is the best wrestler of the 1950s?\n\nEl Santo\n\nWho is the best wrestler of the 1960s?\n\nVerne Gagne\n\nWho is the best wrestler of the 1970s?\n\nHarley Race\n\nWho is the best wrestler of the 1980s?\n\nRic Flair\n\nWho is the best wrestler of the 1990s?\n\nSteve Austin\n\nWho is the best wrestler of the 2000s?\n\nMistico\n\nWho is the best wrestler of the 2010s?\n\nHiroshi Tanahashi\n\nWho is the best wrestler (so far) of the 2020s?\n\nRoman Reigns"
