        "text": "This is becoming the new Let's Talk About... thread for me (though someone feel free to start one of those up again if the mood strikes). Anyways I figured it's time for our first tag team edition of TSM Profile...\n\nName: Demolition\n\nMembers: Ax (Bill Eadie, 1987-1990, mid '90s-present)), Smash (Randy Colley, 1987. Barry Darson, 1987 to 1991, 2007 to present), Crush (1990 to 1991)\n\nHeight: Ax- 6'3''\n\nSmash- 6'2\n\nCrush- 6'6''\n\nCombined Weight: Various, depending on combination.\n\nYears active: 1987 to 1991, 2007-present\n\nAccomplishments: 3 time WWF Tag Team Champions. Had the longest reign in the title's history.\n\nCareer Summary: Demolition debuted in January '87, managed originally by Luscious Johnny V. After only a few matches, Randy Colley was replaced as Demolition Smash, allegedly because he was too recognizable as the man who played Moondog Rex. He would be replaced by Barry Darsow, a recent signee from Jim Crockett Promotions. Over the course of '87, Demolition would build up momentum defeating all of the established babyface tag teams in the WWF. They would soon replace Luscious Johnny V with another former wrestler, Mr. Fuji as their manager.\n\nAt WrestleMania IV, Demolition would win their first WWF Tag Team titles, defeating Strike Force. They would go on to be champions for a record 478 days. Not only that but they were on top of one of the greatest tag team divisions in WWF history, including (at various points during the reign) the likes of; The Hart Foundation, The British Bulldogs, The Rockers, The Fabulous Rougeaus, The Powers of Pain, The Killer Bees, Strike Force, and The Brainbusters. At Survivor Series '88, Demolition turned face after Mr. Fuji abandoned them to manage their arch-rivals, The Powers of Pain. Demolition conquered The Powers of Pain and Mr. Fuji and retained their titles in a 3 on 2 match at WrestleMania V.\n\nDemolition finally lost the titles in a two out of three falls match to The Brainbusters on The July 29th, 1989 edition of Saturday Night's Main Event. A little over three months later, Demolition would regain the titles in a rematch against The Brainbusters on Superstars but their second reign was short-lived as they fell to the superteam of Andre The Giant and Haku, more popularly known as The Colossal Connection on The December 30th, 1989 edition of Superstars.\n\nIn a memorable match at WrestleMania VI, Demolition would recapture the title from The Colossal Connection and would begin their third and final WWF Tag Team titles reign. Shortly after WrestleMania, a new member named Crush would join the team and Demolition would once again turn heel. In kayfabe, Crush joining the group was a result of their new bad attitude but in reality, McMahon added a new member to the team as a result of Ax's illness problems. At SummerSlam '90, The Hart Foundation would defeat Demolition for the titles with the help of recent arrivees, The Legion of Doom (a team that many initially accused Demolition of ripping off).\n\nDemolition would feud with The Legion of Doom and WWF World Champion, The Ultimate Warrior over the course of the Fall of '90. This feud culminated in a match at Survivor Series '90 where The Warrior, Intercontinental Champion Kerry Von Erich, and The Legion of Doom would defeat Mr. Perfect and all three members of Demolition. Shortly thereafter, Ax left the WWF. Smash and Crush floundered as a team for several months afterwards before being repackaged (Darsow as Repo Man and Crush as....er...Crush, a fun loving Hawaiian).\n\nBill Eadie and The WWF would be embroiled in lawsuits for the better part of the '90s and into the '00s over The Demolition name. Eadie wrestled as Ax, regularly on the indie circuit, attempting to reignite the team with the original Smash, Randy Colley and newcomer, Demolition Blast. In 2007, the classic Demolition lineup of Darsow and Eadie would reunite on the indie circuit. Most notably, they teamed up with The One Man Gang and competed in the 2008 CHIKARA King of Trios tournament.\n\nSome Questions to perhaps to start the discussion\n\n1. Better as heels or babyfaces?\n\n2. Do you think they ever really shed the LOD/Road Warriors ripoff label?\n\n3. Similar follow up; Demolition or The Legion of Doom/Road Warriors?\n\n4. Where would you rank them amongst the great tag teams of their era? Of all time?\n\n5. Favorite matches, moments, etc.\n\n1. Better as heels or babyfaces?\n\n-It doesn't matter to me. Demolition worked either way.\n\n2. Do you think they ever really shed the LOD/Road Warriors ripoff label?\n\n-Ehhh... The Road Warriors were always the more successful team, and they came before Demolition. As a result, Demolition will always have that stigma, even though they were a great team and gimmick.\n\n3. Similar follow up; Demolition or The Legion of Doom/Road Warriors?\n\n-Honestly... I'd take The Road Warriors. Demolition was over, but they weren't at the level of Hawk and Animal's popularity.\n\n4. Where would you rank them amongst the great tag teams of their era? Of all time?\n\n-They are clearly one of the best tag-teams of the late 80's/early 90's, and they rank real high on the list of WWE tag-teams. As far as all time, well, somewhere in the top 20-25.\n\n5. Favorite matches, moments, etc.\n\n-The first wrestling show I ever went to was when they were \"testing\" Crush out with the team. I forgot who Demolition was facing (This was the summer of 1990, I think)... but I still remember people in the crowd cheering, \"We Want Ax!\" We had no idea who this \"other\" guy with Demolition was.\n\nAs a young mark, Demolition was probably my favorite tag team in all of wrestling. I think I would have liked LOD a little more had they actually won the NWA titles and consistently dominated the division, but from the time I started watching in '87 until the the time they left the company they had one short reign. As a kid I really cared about that stuff and Demolition was far more dominating.\n\nCalling Demolition a LOD ripoff is a little unfair, in my opinion. It's not like we're talking the Powers of Pain here, which was such a rip it's not even funny. Darsow and Eadie could at least work a little and weren't as dependent on the squash. Sure, they co-opted the look and feel, but damn if they didn't look badass doing it.\n\nBecause of the ripoff label and the fact that they disappeared off the map after LOD arrived in '91, they get forgotten in the grand scheme of things. They flat out dominated that division for the better part of three years, which should put them up there with the greats of all time. There aren't many classics under their belt but the 2/3 falls with the Hart Foundation was superb. It's an underrated backlog of matches.\n\nDemolition will always have a place in my heart. Two of the biggest markout moments I had as a kid were Demolition related. The first was when Ax and Smash started the '89 Rumble. I was watching on PPV at a neighbor's house and I almost lost it when they had to fight each other. But that was nothing compared to how crazy I went when I saw them beat the Brain Busters on Prime Time. That title win came out of nowhere. It was huge.\n\nTo answer:\n\n1. Better as heels or babyfaces? Demolition was good either way actually. There wasn't much difference in the gimmick either way.\n\n2. Do you think they ever really shed the LOD/Road Warriors ripoff label? Oddly enough, as a kid watching wrestling I never even thought of them as being a ripoff at all. The Powers of Pain? They were real similar to the LOD. But Demolition were built nothing like LOD and didn't wrestle a similar style. They just had a vaguely similar Mad Max gimmick. Ironically enough, while fans may have gotten over this, the WWF didn't. Once LOD joined the company Demolition were jobbed out and done by 1991.\n\n3. Similar follow up; Demolition or The Legion of Doom/Road Warriors? Obviously Demolition didn't have as long of a career as a team, but I will take them here. LOD mostly just squashed and no sold people, being of little use in actual matches. It's painful to watch Hawk in that face in peril role.\n\n4. Where would you rank them amongst the great tag teams of their era? Of all time? From 1987-90 they were tremendous, solid champions. All time? I have no idea, but I'd take them over anyone now.\n\n5. Favorite matches, moments, etc. The two SS matches vs. the Harts, the various Brainbusters matches, and of course the Survivor Series 88 double turn with the Powers of Pain. That was a really great match."
