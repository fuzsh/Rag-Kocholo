Giving him a midcard comedy gimmick like Repo Man was honestly probably the best use of him as he was still good at character stuff. Repo Man was super entertaining I thought. Only thing I would've changed is that I thought they missed the boat not turning him babyface where he would steal stuff from the heels.\n\nPost by Mighty Attack Tribble on\n\nDarsow really started to regress in ring quite a bit towards the end of Demolition and never was really any good again which is odd as he was only in his early 30's at the time.\n\nI did appreciate that Darsow almost completely changed up his in-ring style. Smash was a somewhat slow, powerful, dominating brawler while Repo Man was lighter on his feet – as befitting his sneaky character – and incorporated more holds into his offence.\n\nIt's weird, because I always remembered Repo Man being significantly smaller and less muscular than Smash, no doubt because of that change in style, but rewatching a lot of his matches recently I realised that Darsow was actually bulkier.\n\nPost by ThankGodForSidJustice on\n\nDarsow really started to regress in ring quite a bit towards the end of Demolition and never was really any good again which is odd as he was only in his early 30's at the time.\n\nI did appreciate that Darsow almost completely changed up his in-ring style.

I would say it's definitely the smallest he ever was during his career.\n\nDarsow definitely did seem like one of those guys whose physique and weight would fluctuate quite a bit depending on how he was being used. It looked like he leaned up quite a bit in early 1990 around Wrestlemania VI when Demolition was at their peak. Then he started putting the weight back on and getting doughier by 91 when Demolition was starting to get phased out. Then slimmed down quite a bit when he became Repo Man before letting himself go again by 93 when he was demoted to JTTS status.\n\nPost by thecrusherwi on\n\nI love Demolition but I think Darsow was probably used about as well as he could have been post Demolition. He was a good hand and worked quite well in the Demolition gimmick, but once he dropped the weight (along with significant muscle mass from his 80's peak) that combined with his work was just never going to be higher than a midcard guy.\n\nMy favorite non-Demolition Darsow is honestly regular JTTS Barry Darsow in WCW calling everyone within sight a \"stinkin bum\" for 10 minutes and then having a fun TV match. But I think the WWF did pretty right by Darsow - gave him a monster push in one of the defining Tag Teams of the era and then booked him pretty consistently for another 1-2 years in a gimmick as an underneath heel. As limited as that Repo Man character was, they were still booking him to win squashes on Superstars and Wrestling Challenge into the Fall of 1992. In that era, as long as you're getting those, it's clear the still care about you.\n\nPost by \"Playboy\" Don Douglas on\n\nI think Blacktop Bully was Darsow's best post-Demolition gimmick, but even then it's hard for me to imagine him being much more than a JTTS. I think Darsow just worked better as a tag team guy. I could have seen him doing well in WCW with another burly brawler type.\n\nNot that he was a burly brawler type, but I’m surprised they never teamed him with Bobby Eaton. They paired Bobby with plenty of other people.\n\nPost by thecrusherwi on\n\nI think Blacktop Bully was Darsow's best post-Demolition gimmick, but even then it's hard for me to imagine him being much more than a JTTS.
