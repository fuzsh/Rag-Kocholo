        "text": "As everyone who watches WWE Monday Night Raw must know by now, New Day is on the verge of breaking the record for longest consecutive Tag Team Title Reign. If they hold the belts until Saturday, December 17, they will be the new Longest Reigning Tag Champs in WWE History. They've got their work cut out for them, though, as they are booked in a Triple Threat Tag Match against Sheamus & Cesaro and Gallows & Anderson this coming Monday night on Raw. They've got one team rooting for them, though, and it just so happens to be the team whose record they're about to break: Demolition.\n\nYes, Bill Eadie and Barry Darsow, Ax and Smash of Demolition were interviewed by Bill Apter at Keystone State Wrestling Alliance this past weekend, and they gave New Day their blessing, even though neither Ax or Smash had ever met the members of The New Day.\n\nAx began by saying: “Well, it is a New Day, and (although) I don’t know either one of the gentlemen, I understand they’re very, very competent young men; they’re well accepted by the fans.”\n\nSmash interjected, \"I heard they’re pretty good guys, too.”\n\n\"Back in the day, we didn’t like good guys,\" said Ax, \"but we’ll just change our ways a little bit.\"\n\nApter then asked them what would happen if Demolition decided to try to dethrone The New Day and get the belts back for themselves.\n\n“Well, they better pack a lunch,\" Ax replied, \"because it’s gonna take almost as many days to beat us as it did to beat our record.”\n\nAx & Smash During Their Title Reign"
