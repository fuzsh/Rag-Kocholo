I'm guessing WWE just doesn't want to mess with it because the guy is old and past his prime and who knows he might actually have a case and probably really should be the owner of the gimmick if he thought of it before going to the WWF but I don't know how likely that is.\n\nPost by dizzy on\n\nThe reason Darsow didn't take part is because he had no claim. The lawsuit pertained to Ax and the original Smash, Randy Culley. Since Darsow came in after the gimmick was started, there was nothing he could do.\n\nBill Eadie himself stated otherwise. He said very clearly (at the 8/11/06 Legends of Wrestling convention) that Barry Darsow could've participated in the lawsuit against the WWF but chose not to, and the consequence was that he did not have any ownership in the Demolition name. Eadie further stated that was one of the things that caused a rift between himself and Barry Darsow at that time. Eadie did mention that Randy Culley was involved in the lawsuit, but said that Darsow could've been also if he had chosen to. Ax said something to the effect of, \"I stood up to fight and Barry didn't.\"\n\nThe lawsuit actually lasted for years, almost 15. It only got settled within the last 3-4 years.\n\nYeah, that's the impression I got from Ax when he spoke about it. He didn't make it sound like it was a thing of the long past, like something that just happened in 1991 and was over. It definitely sounded more recent.\n\nWhat was the settlement?\n\nThat Bill Eadie (Ax) owns the Demolition name and rights to use it anywhere. Ax would not comment on the situation beyond that.\n\nThat is only according to him though. I'm guessing WWE just doesn't want to mess with it because the guy is old and past his prime\n\nI don't buy that. There's no way in hell Vince would ever allow anyone under any circumstances to profit from using gimmicks and intellectual properties that he owns. There is no reason not to believe Bill Eadie when he says the lawsuit was settled and that he owns the Demolition name.\n\nPost by dizzy on\n\ndemolition dvd would be great!!\n\nIndeed! But the next best thing is the Demolition RF video shoot that is already out there! It was done in 2007, and both Bill Eadie and Barry Darsow appear together and talk about their WWF career in detail for 90 minutes. The best shoot I've ever seen.\n\nI actually heard WWE won the lawsuit, but Eadie ignored the ruling and continued to use the gimmick .\n\nYou know, I keep hearing people say, \"I heard this, I heard that\", or \"I'm guessing this, I'm guessing that\"...\n\nAt this point, the only official source is Bill Eadie himself, and according to him, the lawsuit was settled and he owns the Demolition name, and Vince does not. Eadie stated this very explicitly on more than one occasion.\n\nYou can \"believe\" Bill Eadie or not, but I'll take his word over any rumors or heresay floating around the internet.\n\nPost by dizzy on\n\nOne of the most disapointing things in my lifetime watching wrestling is that Demolition was never brought back for a 2nd run. Once they were gone they were gone. Thats unfortunate.\n\nIt's also unfortunate that they went out the way they did.\n\nOne of the things Ax said in the shoot interview was that Vince wanted the Road Warriors so badly that he didn't realize that Demolition had surpassed them in the WWF. Which was true -- the Legion of Doom was always overhyped in the WWF simply because they had been big stars before coming to the WWF.\n\nDemolition on the other hand, actually earned their stature in the WWF and became the company's biggest team. Ax and Smash ruled with an iron first between 1988 and 1990 and nobody could touch them. They were hugely popular with the fans (they got an ovation as big as Hogan and Warrior did at Wrestlemania VI).\n\nBut then when Hawk and Animal entered the WWF. They were brand new to that company but weren't required to get over on their own. They were already treated like superstars, and Demolition was quickly squashed down to being jobbers to get L.O.D. over. Then of course, they were relegated to the second rate Smash and Crush version.\n\nI guess the wrestling business, like life, isn't fair, but Demolition deserved a much better shake than that after having dominated the WWF for so long."
