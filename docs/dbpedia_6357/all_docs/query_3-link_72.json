        "text": "Asia is the largest of the worldâsÂ continents, covering approximately 30 percent of the Earthâs land area. It is also the worldâs mostÂ populousÂ continent, with roughly 60 percent of the total population.\n\nThe geographic term âAsiaâ was originally used by ancient Greeks to describe theÂ civilizations east of their empire. Ancient Asian peoples, however, saw themselves as a varied and diverse mix ofÂ culturesânot a collective group. Today, the term âAsiaâ is used as a cultural concept, while subregion classifications describe the distinct geopolitical identities of the continent. These classifications are Western Asia, Central Asia, Southern Asia, Eastern Asia, Southeastern Asia, and Northern Asia.\n\nToday, Asia is home to the citizens of Afghanistan, Armenia, Azerbaijan, Bahrain, Bangladesh, Bhutan, Brunei, Cambodia, China, Georgia, India, Indonesia, Iran, Iraq, Israel, Japan, Jordan, Kazakhstan, Kuwait, Kyrgyzstan, Laos, Lebanon, Malaysia, Maldives, Mongolia, Myanmar, Nepal, North Korea, Oman, Pakistan, Philippines, Qatar, Russia, Saudi Arabia, Singapore, South Korea, Sri Lanka, Syria, Tajikistan, Thailand, Timor-Leste (East Timor), Turkey, Turkmenistan, United Arab Emirates, Uzbekistan, Vietnam, and Yemen.\n\nAsiaâsÂ physical geography,Â environmentÂ and resources, andÂ human geographyÂ can be considered separately.\n\nAsia is home to the worldâs earliest civilizations. ItsÂ indigenousÂ cultures pioneered many practices that have beenÂ integralÂ to societies for centuries, such asÂ agriculture,Â city planning, andÂ religion. The social and political geography of the continent continues to inform and influence the rest of the world.\n\nCultural Geography\n\nHistoric Cultures\n\nTheÂ Fertile CrescentÂ is considered the birthplace of agriculture. Civilizations developed along a series ofÂ watersheds, starting with the Nile River valley and arching up the Mediterranean coast, eastward toward Iraq and southward along the Tigris and Euphrates rivers until reaching the Persian Gulf.\n\nNomadicÂ peoples settled along the lush river banks to harvest wild wheat and barley, becoming the worldâs first farmers. This represented a fundamental shift in the lifestyle of early humans, who until that point had survived by following their food as hunter-gatherers. Through agriculture, people learned to sustain themselves by manipulating the natural environment.\n\nAs more tribes settled and worked together, important agricultural innovations were developed, such as the wheel,Â irrigation, and hand tools. Farmers used these tools to tame wild grasses, such as wheat, barley, and lentils. Farmers also domesticated animals such as cows, sheep, and pigs.\n\nAgriculture made cities and civilizations possible by producing enough food for the community so not everyone had to provide for themselves. People not engaged in agriculture had time to develop writing, religion,Â taxation, andÂ trade. For instance, theÂ cuneiformÂ writing system has preserved the history of the metropolis of Ur, part of the Sumerian civilization, which developed around 2100 BCE.\n\nThe Indus Valley was another hotspot of early civilization. From 2600 BCE to 1700 BCE, settlements developed on the flood plain of the Indus River, stretching over a million square kilometers from northwestern India through Pakistan and Afghanistan.\n\nThe cities of the Indus Valley civilization established early forms of urban planning and construction. Buildings were well-organized and built out of durable materials such as brick and stone. Cities contained docks along the river, granaries, temples, residences, and warehouses. Cities were often surrounded by high walls, which offered protection from bothÂ natural disasters, such as floods, and invading armies.\n\nPlacing a high priority onÂ hygiene, cities like Harappa and Mohenjo-daro (both in modern-day Pakistan) developed drainage systems, wells, and water-storage systems that were the most advanced of their times. For example, wastewater was directed from a homeâs bathhouse to covered drains that lined major streets. Houses only opened to inner courtyards and smaller lanes. This privacy radically reduced the spread of disease. These efficient and sanitary systems greatly influenced future urban development.\n\nThe spread of religion is an important example of how cultural practices expand into distant territories through a variety of direct and indirect actions. Buddhism, for example, has its roots in Nepal and India in the late 6th century BCE. Well-establishedÂ maritimeÂ and land trade routes allowed Buddhist thought to spread to other Asian territories. Missionaries joined Buddhist merchants on their ships andÂ caravans, carrying with them religious manuscripts and images.\n\nBuddhist missionaries remained in market cities for extended periods of time, facilitating the exchange of ideas and symbols. Today, Buddhism is the majority religion throughout most of eastern Asia, from Japan in the north to Cambodia, Thailand, Myanmar, and Laos in the south.\n\nArt played an important role in the spread of Buddhism. Sculpture, paintings, and icons depicting Buddhist concepts and deities were easily understood and adopted by cultures outside Nepal and India. As Buddhist art was created in these specific cultural styles, the religion took on local significance in each region. Buddhism flourishes in part because it allowed its practitioners to express their devotion through creative means.\n\nAsiaâs rich cultural heritage has modernized, along with its developing economies. The continentâs growing middle class and increased investment from abroad support this modernization. Asian film, fashion, and music highlight the relationship between historic cultures and contemporary markets.\n\nIndia is the worldâs largest producer of films, producing more than 2,500 movies every year. Film production is so widespread in India that it is categorized regionally. Areas such as Mumbai, West Bengal, Andhra Pradesh, and Tamil Nadu produce distinct films that reflect regional language and culture. Government and private industry have invested heavily in Indiaâs film industry, and today more than 30 film production companies exist in the country. The worldâs largest film studio, Ramoji Film City, is in the city of Hyderabad. It offers more than 500 set locations and has the space to produce 60 films at the same time.\n\nIndian cinema is a major export. The largest film industry is centered around Mumbai, and nicknamed Bollywood. Bollywood films screen in more than 90 countries around the world, and earn millions of dollars, especially in the United States, the United Kingdom, Australia, and Singapore. The growing number of Indians working abroad has opened up new markets for Indian films. These so-called non-resident Indians (NRIs) account for roughly 12 percent of a filmâs totalÂ revenue.\n\nCentral Asiaâs tradition ofÂ textile-making is enjoying a period of revival in such countries as Tajikistan and Uzbekistan. After the fall of theÂ Soviet Union, these former Soviet republics used their cultural history to help define a new national identity. Vibrant hand-dyed textiles were an important part of this cultural tradition, especially in Uzbekistan.Â SuzaniÂ textiles played a central role in Uzbek family ceremonies and denoted a familyâs status.\n\nToday, workers dye, weave, andÂ embroiderÂ UzbekÂ suzaniÂ textiles by hand after a long period of industrial production. Craftswomen are updating traditional designs and using natural dyes, such as indigo, walnut, and pomegranate, to create eye-catching pieces for the contemporary marketplace. Uzbek suzanis are sold internationally. Fashion and home dÃ©cor companies from around the world have adoptedÂ suzaniÂ designs into their products. In order to support the growing demand, craftsmenâs associations and nongovernmental organizations have been created to promote Uzbek textiles\n\nSouth Korean pop music, nicknamed K-pop, integrates traditional Korean song with contemporary pop, hip-hop, electronic, and R&B sounds. K-pop has developed into a pop culture phenomenon in Asia and abroad. Musical producers invest heavily in girl groups, boy bands, and soloists. Performers are followed by millions of fans, mostly Asian young adults, who have adopted their style and fashion trends.\n\nK-pop producers and artists have invested heavily in broadening their appeal abroad. Korean artists tour with international headliners and work with producers such as American rappers Kanye West and will.i.am of the Black Eyed Peas. They also use Internet platforms, such as Facebook, Twitter, and YouTube, to reach a larger audience. As a result, K-pop has a strong following in the United States, Canada, Australia, and Europe.\n\nPolitical Geography\n\nPolitical geographyÂ is the internal and external relationships between a continentâs variousÂ governments, citizens, and territories. Asian governments and citizens have created and responded to political and social change in ways that have profoundly affected these relationships at both the local and international level. As the continent continues to increase its political and economic prominence, its policy decisions will hold greater weight for the global community.\n\nHistoric Issues\n\nOne of the oldest and most intensely debated political disputes continues to be negotiated in theÂ Levant, an area in the eastern Mediterranean. The Levant, part of the Middle East, has been continuously occupied for thousands of years by the historic cultures of Syria, Lebanon, Jordan, and Israel.\n\nThe Levant is sometimes called âThe Holy Land.â This small region is spiritually important to followers ofÂ Jewish,Â Christian, andÂ MuslimÂ faiths. These are the three most populous and influentialÂ monotheisticÂ religions in the world. All three faiths trace their origins to the Jewish patriarchÂ Abraham. For this reason, Judaism, Christianity, and Islam are known as the âAbrahamic religions.â\n\nThe religious conflict between Abrahamic religions in the Levant has endured for thousands of years. Christian leaders persecuted Jews in the region during the late Roman Empire. During the Middle Ages, European Christians sent soldiers on crusades to conquer and convert the Levantâs Muslim majority.\n\nThe most recent conflict in the Levant is between Israel and neighboring nations. Israel, the only Jewish-majority nation in the world, was established in 1948. Prior to 1948, the area was a British colony called Palestine. Many non-Jewish natives identify as Palestinians. Neighboring statesâincluding Jordan, Syria, Lebanon, and Egyptâaccepted Palestinian immigrants and rejected the new Israeli government.\n\nMajor warsÂ plagueÂ the region, including the Arab-Israeli War (1948), the Suez Crisis (1956), the Six Day War (1967), and the Yom Kippur War (1973). Smaller conflicts, including incidents ofÂ terrorism, are associated with Palestinian uprisings, orÂ intifadas. The First Intifada, which included nonviolent protests as well as armed assaults, took place in the late 1980s. The Second Intifada took place between 2000 and 2005.\n\nThe conflict in the Levant has resulted in Israel creating two Palestinian territories (the West Bank and the Gaza Strip) within its boundaries. Treaties, such as the Camp David Accords (which established a lasting peace treaty between Egypt and Israel) have attempted to negotiate a lasting peace in the Levant.\n\nThe colonization of Southeast Asia is another example of how historic political geography can influence an entire region.Â ColonialismÂ is foreign political rule imposed on a people. Chinese, Japanese, and European colonization of Southeast Asia lasted for more than 1,000 years. China, for instance, was the ruling power in Vietnam from about 110 BCE to 900 CE.\n\nColonial powers from Europe, the United States, and Japan imposed their rule on Southeast Asian peoples from the 1500s to the mid-1940s. While these powers had distinct motives, they were generally looking to expand their territory, increase trade, import cheap raw materials, and impose their cultural practices.\n\nThe Dutch and British established extremely powerful companies that oversaw trade and labor in their respective colonies. The Dutch East India Company, based in Indonesia, had the power to print its own money and engage in war. They enforced harsh labor practices on local peoples, who worked to collectÂ lucrativeÂ spices and extractÂ precious metals. These resources were then sold in Europe.\n\nSpanish and Portuguese colonists spread the Roman Catholic faith by converting indigenous peoples, especially in the Philippines. The French used their military to maintain control of their colonies, resulting in the deaths of hundreds of thousands of people.\n\nThe countries of Southeast Asia are now independent. However, their economies, politics, and culture still maintain aspects of the colonial period. For instance, the Vietnamese language is written with the Roman alphabet, not theÂ glyphs,Â ideograms, or indigenous alphabets of neighboring Asian nations. This is because the written Vietnamese language was established by the French, who use a Roman alphabet.\n\nAs with the colonial period, Asia was deeply affected by World War II and its aftermath. Japan was the most devastated Asian country in terms of loss of life and physical destruction. However, it also experienced a record period of economic growth after the war. Investment from the United States and innovative economic restructuring by the Japanese government stimulated this growth.\n\nJapanâs Ministry of International Trade and Industry coordinated partnerships, known asÂ keiretsu, between manufacturers, suppliers, distributors, and banks in order to streamline industry. The ministry also created a strong export economy, focusing on technology industries that still define Japanâs global image. Capital was invested in Japanâs infrastructure, especially in efficient transportation systems, communications, and technology. Japanâs intense public and private investment increased itsÂ gross domestic product (GDP)Â from $91 billion in 1965 to more than $1 trillion in 1980.\n\nCurrent Issues\n\nIndiaâs and Chinaâs economic growth has been profound in the last 20 years. Both countries have removed government controls, increased foreign trade, and built strong export-based economies. This economic growth has had both positive and negative effects.\n\nChina has the worldâs fastest-growing economy, increasing nearly 10 percent every year for the past 30 years. This is largely because China is the worldâs largestÂ manufacturer and exporter of goods. As a result of this growth,Â wages have increased rapidly, giving Chinese workers a better standard of living. More Chinese people have access to excellentÂ health care,Â electricity, and education. China has a strong presence in international politics and influences important debates, such as those surrounding terrorism and climate change. China has used its newfound wealth to invest around the world. China has invested billions of dollars in Nigeria, for instance, to extractÂ oil. Predicted to be the worldâs largest economy in the coming decades, Chinaâs economic decisions will greatly affect how and where future development occurs around the globe.\n\nBut Chinaâs rapid growth has caused a number of social, environmental, and economic problems. Rapid industrial growth in the cities has impoverished rural workers, who must migrate to congested urban areas to find jobs. Industrial activity has put stress on the countryâs energy and transportation systems and degraded air, water, and soil quality. Industrial growth also has major implications for globalÂ climate change, as China is the worldâs largest producer of carbon dioxide emissions.\n\nIndiaâs growth has been drastically different from Chinaâs. India is aÂ democracy, while China is aÂ totalitarianÂ state. This means that social and political reforms are debated more openly in India, and change is often more difficult because power resides inÂ coalitions instead of one political party.\n\nUnlike China, Indiaâs growth is largely a result of its rapidly growingÂ service industryânot its manufacturing sector. In particular, India has become a major exporter ofÂ information technologyÂ services. Its telecommunications industry, which focuses on phone and Internet services, added more than 200 million subscribers in 2010. The country also hosts seven of the worldâs top technologyÂ outsourcingÂ companies, which rely heavily on Indiaâs highly educated, English-speaking population.\n\nIndiaâs growth has caused hourly wages to double during the past decade, bringing more than 430 million Indians out ofÂ povertyÂ and creating an immense middle-class population. Much like China, Indiaâs urban infrastructure and global influence have also improved.\n\nDespite this economic growth, India remains socioeconomically divided. India still has the worldâs largest concentration of people living in extreme povertyâbelow $1.25 per day. The difference in revenue between Indiaâs more industrialized states and its poorer agricultural states has widened substantially. Much like China, Indiaâs urban infrastructure, education, and health systems are having difficulty adjusting to the large number of poor, rural migrants moving into cities.\n\nIn Asiaâs Arab region, conservative governments are under pressure from their citizens and the international community to enable political, economic, and social reform. While authoritarian rulers control the majority of these countries, their citizens broadly support democracy. In the so-called âArab Springâ of 2011, social and political groups across the region staged armed protests calling for democratic reform. Governments have responded to these protests with both military force and political compromise. Syria and Jordan exemplify this political change in Arab Asia.\n\nProtesters in Syria called for the legalization of political parties, the removal ofÂ corruptÂ officials, and the repeal of Emergency Law, which allows arrests without charge. In response to the protests, the Syrian government launched military campaigns to repress protesters. These campaigns have killed thousands of people. Hundreds of Syrians have been jailed. The international community has responded by placing economic and politicalÂ sanctions on the Syrian government.\n\nJordanians have staged weekly protests against corruption, rising prices, poverty, and unemployment. King Abdullah has responded to these protests by replacing his prime minister and forming the National Dialogue Committee. Made up of both government officials and opposition leaders, the committee is in charge of drafting reforms, including new laws for elections and political parties.\n\nThe implications of this complicated and often violent process of political reform are still too early to determine in Syria, Jordan, and other Asian states that have joined a common democratic cause. What is certain is that these changes will increase public participation in the political process.\n\nFuture Issues\n\nAsiaâs growing political and economic prominence will continue to place stress on both local and global processes. Great focus has been placed on how Asiaâs increased development has negatively affected the environment. National governments andÂ international organizations are working to protect local natural resources and the broader global climate.\n\nThe extreme loss of forest cover in Southeast Asia due to overharvesting of timber threatens the regionâs economy and biodiversity, as well as the worldâsÂ carbon budget. Between 1990 and 2010, Southeast Asiaâs forests contracted in size by roughly 33 million hectares (81.5 million acres), an area larger than Vietnam. By 2020, these forests are expected to shrink by an additional 16 million hectares (39.5 million acres).\n\nThis loss would mean an additional 8.72 gigatons of carbon dioxide would enter the worldâs atmosphere. It would destroy forests with important ecological value, such as Indonesiaâs lowland tropical forests. Furthermore, the loss would dramatically decrease the productivity of the regionâs wood industries, a main economic generator for many Southeast Asian countries.\n\nInternational organizations and regional and national governmental bodies are enforcingÂ sustainableÂ forestry practices in order to combat forest degradation. The Cambodian government, for example, has encouraged the planting of fast-growing trees, modernized wood-processing equipment, and banned the export of many types of logs. Myanmar (Burma) has developed a network of more than 600 community forest management agreements that bring local people and the government together. Organizations such as the Forest Stewardship Council and the Malaysian Timber Certification Scheme enable forest industries to pursue sustainable development. Roughly 3.5 percent of Southeast Asiaâs total forest area was sustainably certified in 2010.\n\nMaldives, a country of hundreds of islands andÂ atolls in the Indian Ocean, symbolizes the current and future effects of global climate change. Rising to only 2.3 meters (7.7 feet) above sea level at its highest point, Maldives has already felt the effects of rising sea levels. A 2004Â tsunamiÂ flooded the entire country, killing 82 people, displacing 12,000, and inflicting $375 million in damage.\n\nThe effects of global warming on Maldives will be more widespread during the coming decades. Along with rising sea levels, the country will beÂ susceptibleÂ to coastal erosion, higherÂ storm surges, and loss ofÂ biodiversity. This will drastically affect the countryâsÂ tourism-based economy. A loss of beachfront property coupled with warmer winters in the Northern Hemisphere would keep residents of Europe and North America from visiting the islands.\n\nThe Maldivian government has taken decisive steps to curtail the effects of climate change, commanding the attention of the international community. Former President Maumoon Abdul Gayoom supported the construction of the artificial island of HulhumalÃ©, which now houses a hospital, school, government buildings, and residences for 50,000 people. HulhumalÃ© sits on ground several meters higher than the rest of the country.\n\nIn 2009, Maldivian President Mohamed Nasheed held the worldâs first underwaterÂ cabinetÂ meeting in order to highlight the effects of climate change. At a table 6 meters (20 feet) below the waterâs surface, Maldivian leaders signed a document calling on all countries to cut their carbon dioxide emissions. President Nasheed also agreed to make Maldives the worldâs first carbon-neutral country by switching entirely to wind and solar energy within a decade. These acts have demonstrated that those who affect and are affected by climate change need to take decisive steps to create lasting environmental improvements."
