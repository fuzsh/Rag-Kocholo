        "text": "Rome, Open City\n\nMay 25 at 12:00pm\n\nEast Building Auditorium\n\nA chronicle of resistance set during the occupation, Rome, Open City (the title is taken from Rome’s status as an “open city” as of August 14, 1943) centers around a group of ordinary Romans who work together during the early months of 1944 to protect a fugitive antifascist leader from capture. Anna Magnani, one of the few professionals in the cast, is the film’s moral core and archetypal earth mother set to marry a resistance fighter after losing her first husband to the fascists. Steeped in the miseries and passions brought on by long-endured distress, the film (cowritten by Rossellini with Federico Fellini and Sergio Amidei) was hastily funded and crudely shot, not necessarily for stylistic reasons, though this style proved to be an advantage for the film’s ultimate neorealist reputation. (Roberto Rossellini, 1945, subtitles, 105 minutes)\n\nPaisan\n\nMay 27 at 12:30pm\n\nEast Building Auditorium\n\nIn a cycle of six chapters, Paisan tracks the progress of the Allies during the Italian Campaign, from the invasion of Sicily to crossing the Po River. The central motif — crushing struggles with poor communication and response — is sensitively played out despite the film’s rough-edged production. Paisan was widely seen at the time, and was later nominated for an Academy Award for original screenplay and for a BAFTA Award for best film of 1946. In Italy it proved to be the most popular new film of the 1945 – 1946 season. “The film is shot through with flashes of moral illumination and mutual understanding, fleeting moments of connection and compassion” — Nelson Kim. (Roberto Rossellini, 1946, subtitles, 134 minutes) Special thanks to Fondazione Cineteca di Bologna for loan of the restored digital print.\n\nGermany, Year Zero\n\nMay 27 at 3:30pm\n\nEast Building Auditorium\n\nThe final installment in the trilogy, Germany, Year Zero takes place in Berlin, where Rossellini shot on location to create a sense of hard realities encircling the devastated and defeated German nation. Graphic images of a bombed-out capital and a sympathetic portrait of the shattered lives of the children, symbolize the intense struggle for survival. “A vehemently subjective vision, the junction of Italian neorealism and German expressionism” — Fernando F. Croce. (Roberto Rossellini, 1948, subtitles, 78 minutes) Special thanks to Film Forum and to Cinecittà Luce,\n\nThis program is part of the 7th annual European Month of Culture."
