        "text": "Week three and four was focused on a look into the neorealist film style that was dominant in Italy following World War Two.\n\nThe first film we watched was Rome, Open City. This movie was based on real people and their stories during the Nazi occupation of Rome. The film is portrayed through the experiences of several very different characters including a priest, child, two resistance fighters, and two women with very different positions on the resistance (Pina and Marina). This was a highly tumultuous period of Italian history and the movie did a fantastic job of portraying that feeling. The film took a dark turn with the killing of one of the main characters, Pina. One thing I found interesting from our reading was learning that, due to budgeting constraints, this whole scene was filmed in just one day. One would not realize that without being told and as described by David Forgacs: “the effect is one of a live event captured on film” (Forgacs, 55). This scene, and learning of how it came to be, really helped me understand how important neorealism was to Italian culture during this time period.\n\nThe second film we watched was entitled Paisan and actually consisted of six short films all compiled into one. The general theme was that of human companionship. Once again following the neorealist film style, this film ignited a mix of different feelings with each “episode”. I tend to enjoy movies and tv shows that are less about happy endings and more about the way it really was (although it’s always nice when a realistic depiction of life ends happily). This is probably why I personally liked the third episode the most. This is because it seemed like something that could have, and probably did, happen somewhat regularly. This episode was about a drunken American tanker who went home with a prostitute. The pair ended up spending their time together, before he fell asleep, talking about a woman he had met when the Americans first arrived in Rome. He explains to her that he had hoped to find her again but could not because of the confusing layout of the city. After a while of talking, the woman realizes that she, coincidentally, is the very woman he was speaking of. She doesn’t reveal this to him because he continues on to bemoan that in all reality she had probably turned to prostitution as well. She tries to comfort him and convince him that she has not but he does not accept what she tells him. The woman decides to write her address on a piece of paper hoping that he will come to find her the next day and they might be happily reunited. The story ends abruptly when the soldier throws away the piece of paper, assuming it was the address of a whorehouse, and leaves with his unit. This story, while unfortunate, resonated with me because it’s possible to relate with both of the main characters. The period of history they were depicting was very rough on anyone who lived through. The woman is easy to relate to because, in her situation, she was doing what she had to in order to keep food on her table. The position of the American soldier is also easy to relate to because anyone in his situation would probably lose hope for finding love. I think the saddest part is that neither of them were really wrong.\n\nMovies are a way in which world events can be portrayed in a relatable way to an audience who may or may not have actually experienced it. While the reason behind the need for neorealism is obviously very sad (the destruction brought on by World War Two, the Nazi occupation, and even the Allied occupation), I think in retrospect neorealism is exactly the kind of film that needed to be prevalent at that time in order to help the average person most affected by the war be heard.\n\nThe first two weeks of this class included watching the movie Cinema Paradiso and the reading from Christopher Wagstaff on Cinema.\n\nWhat was most interesting to me, especially from the reading, was the historical background given on Italian Cinema. As a history major, I always find that kind of context very intriguing, and it has helped me to enjoy the films even more. Wagstaff explained how, all the way through the twentieth century, film played a crucial role in shaping Italian culture. From the early 1900s all the way through the close of the century, it is apparent through the reading that Italian Cinema has had a part in defining the social norms of Italy. It was saddening to read about how Cinema attendance began to decline as it was replaced by more personal methods of viewing, which came hand in hand with the government’s deregulation of television in 1976 (Wagstaff, 218). I found it interesting though how before television became a more at-home experience, it was still widely viewed in social settings such as bars or clubs (Wagstaff 218).\n\nAnother aspect of the historical background that I found particularly interesting was Italy’s seemingly constant competition with the American film giant, Hollywood. It seemed that this competition was both harmful and helpful to the Italian film industry. While it was irritating to read about how the Americans forced Italy to “abrogate all the measures that protected Italian films against competition on the domestic market, and dumped at low prices on the Italian market over 2,00 American films, while Cinecitta was used to house refugees.” (Wagstaff 219), it is apparent how the introduction of American films to Italian society later benefited the Italian industry. My father has always been into old western movies and I can remember growing up watching them with him explaining that they were often referred to as “spaghetti westerns” as many of them were actually Italian films. I actually got very excited when Wagstaff briefly referenced Clint Eastwood, who has always been one of my all-time favorite actors: “His film (Sergio Leone), Per un pugno di dollari (A Fistfull of Dollars ) starred a young American actor, Clint Eastwood…” (Wagstaff, 224).\n\nCinema Paradiso was a highly nostalgic film that demonstrated the importance of cinema in Italian society. It focused on the life of a boy, Toto, as he became engrossed with learning how to operate the local cinema. The town itself is not depicted as being special in any way, or at least no different from any other small-town setting in Italy at the time. As Toto grows up and experiences much of what many of us all experience – disaster, love, heartbreak, and moving on and growing up – the film centers around how he always maintained a deep love of the cinema. I believe part of why Toto loved the cinema so much was because of how important it was to his whole town. There were many scenes in which the cinema was shown to be a way of fellowship among friends, entertainment for everyone, and even a place to get into a little bit of mischief. Near the end of the movie, Toto returns to his hometown after having been absent for a long period of time. In a way, the destruction of the now old, abandoned Cinema Paradiso is sadder than even the death of his friend and mentor, Alfredo."
