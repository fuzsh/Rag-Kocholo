        "text": "This story is about diversity of an Italian American family from New Jersey in the 1950s during a time when adults were fearful of catching Polio and the prejudices against Italian Americans that affected their lifestyle. Holm’s inspiration was based on her Italian American upbringing with her mother being the character of Penny, capturing the time period of real things her family encountered. Readers will be drawn in to vivid characters and will understand why Penny longs for her families to mend their broken bond. The historical detail within the book helps readers visualize what the world was going through after World War Two and the challenges that Italian American encountered. Readers will learn that united love will conquer in the end\n\nTexts are cultural artifacts that reflect the thoughts and values of the composer’s context; they serve as a social barometer through which an individual can examine society’s changing ideals. This is evident in a comparative study of the novella Maestro by Peter Goldsworthy, and the film Pay It Forward, directed by Mimi Leder, By exploring the ways in which textual form reflects the context of these texts, audience members are able to draw distinct connections between the concerns expressed and the values of the time. The meaning of these texts can be shaped and reshaped by considering the nature of the connections between them — they both explore the multifaceted nature of transformations in character by contrasting the disparities and commonalities\n\nIn “The Destructors” the leader of the gang becomes fascinated with a house that has somehow survived the bombings of WWII. The author uses imagery throughout the story to draw the reader's attention to the moral of the story, provides a description of imagery in different parts of the text, and provides deeper insight about the characters. There are a few examples of imagery in this story.\n\nVittorio De Sica was one of the most influential and talented directors of the postwar Italian cinema and known to be an important figure in the neorealist movement that changed the cinema scene not only in Italy but in Europe and beyond. Considered to be one of De Sica`s best work, Umberto D. is a fine representation of neorealism. Because Umberto D. is an author-based cinema, the audience could see that De Sica`s visions, his values of truth and ethics are embedded in it.\n\nIn addition, the audience was also introduced to settings that avoided the usual associations of Rome to truly immerse the audience to the real life Italian culture. Especially in the last sequence of the film, everything seems to be continuously raw from the setting to the main actors and to the supporting actors in connection from the beginning of the film. In the last remaining shots, as the camera was following the two main characters, Antonio and Bruno, it was as if the they were the only ones that mattered; no more thoughts of the bike but just both of them as two human beings. Until, they blended with the other people, making them part of the reality\n\nAs you pass through the towns and hotels it is really detailed orientated. You can see the nature reclaiming this land that cities were once built on. Wildlife running free and plant life growing wild. You see giraffes, elk, rabbits and other wildlife. The scenery is truly beautiful, it is mind-blowing. You can see the birds flying and chirping, this scenery shows hope and faith for the future. It shows the ability for regrowth, renewal and a brighter future. It foreshadows the rebirth of mankind and the restoration of civilization. You truly have to stop and admire the scenery, also Ellie (the little girl) makes you stop and pet animals as she asks you questions about them. These destroyed cities show you how anything can be saved and restored. It symbolizes a brighter future, and hope for further generations. Although the beauty of the scenery is eye-catching, people would account this is a weakness if brutality is your sole purpose than you may find this feature over the top and maybe a bit\n\nVasco Pratolini was born on Via de’ Magazzini in Florence, Italy in 1913. Growing up poor between the two world wars, he grew to understand Florence and its inhabitants in a way that would later shine in nearly all of his novels and stories. Pratolini relies on making himself seen through his stories as well. A self taught writer, Pratolini grew up in a poor family. In his short story “The Removal”, Vasco describes the plight of he and his grandmother as they are forced out of their apartment when a wealthier couple decides to move in. This is just one example of how Pratolini’s stories sway towards the autobiographical. Two of Pratolini’s most famous works, Metello and Family Chronicle are representations of Pratolini’s morals and personal beliefs in Matello, and life experiences in Family Chronicle.\n\nFrom living a life of being molested as a kid, selling drugs, being in gangs and violence, Lecrae is truly an anomaly. Lecrae is a musician that has been trying to shine through the light of mainstream recognition. He has been labeled, and is labeled to this day, a christian rapper. He doesn’t like to be labeled as that because people envisage him as a bible thumper before they even listen to his music. He talks about real life situations in his life and the world. Lecrae is an amazing artist with an amazing message which makes him an influential artist to the world by really touching people’s hearts with his music. With a long journey from being in the ghetto, to finding God and becoming the most popular gospel rapper in America, this is Lecrae.\n\nBEEEEEEP!!!!!! SCREECH! HONK! These common sounds were heard throughout the bustling metropolis of Dhaka, Bangladesh, home to Shaan Rahman, a young and honest man. He was on his way back home after a long day at Dhaka University where he studies. “Aree bhai!” exclaimed Shaan to his driver. “Couldn’t you have taken a less crowded road?” Shaan became restless as the traffic kept building. The cars moved like a sloth moving across the forest floor. Many hours passed as Shaan and his driver trudged through the very populous city. Finally, Shaan reached home. Shaan’s jaw dropped when he saw what was covering his house as he got out of the vehicle. Strings of glistening and flickering lights created a jungle of vines crawling up the\n\nWithin a situation based around a real landscape there may be many conflicting opinions perspectives, which can be emphasized further by the specific media of production used. An example of this in filmic media is how Giosue and, to and extent, the audience views the concentration camp in Life is Beautiful. The happy atmosphere Guido creates in juxtaposition to the place around him is captured through film and creates the two significantly different views of the camp. The journey to the Interior uses textual media and describes in detail a hill landscape, which Atwood links back to her subconscious. ‘The hills which the eyes make flat as walls’. The description of the real hills as a landscape creates the two different perceptions of the story, one as a visual representation that the reader can picture, and the other as a metaphor for Atwood’s mind, which connect the readers with her on a profound level. The media of production helps to portray certain attitudes towards landscapes, connecting the audience emotionally with the story and\n\nWhen initially approaching the brief for this project I wanted to focus on a more immediate relationship with context of place thinking about my body and the connection between our physicality and the earth. However when unpacking what my sense of place and belonging to this country and this land is I could not escape the notion of ruin. This theme of ruin and ruination started to come through in my work last year. I am from Christchurch and experienced the earthquakes of 2010 and 2011. Since moving to Auckland the experience of this has slowly come to the surface. I am able to understand my relationship with my old home through finding a new home. Stepping away from the place of trauma has allowed me to process and digest the events that occurred in Christchurch in a way that I would not have been able to do in the city itself. This has manifested in my art, creating abstract prints that help me to express the idea of ruin, trauma and event. I have chosen to present my research as this piece of writing because I personally am able to explore these ideas and express them with more freedom in this format, I found myself struggling to address this in the more standard work booking manner that Elam often subscribes to."
