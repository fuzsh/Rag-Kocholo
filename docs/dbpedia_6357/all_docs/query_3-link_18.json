        "text": "Gender Stereotypes\n\nAmbivalent Sexism Theory (AST; e.g., Glick & Fiske, 1996) hinges on the tension between biologically obligatory male-female interdependence and essentially universal male dominance in societies. AST developed to explain how people manage this dilemma by holding prescriptive stereotypes about men and women, not just how the genders are (descriptive), but how they should be (prescriptive). Two forms of sexism follow, depending on whether women cooperate with prescriptive gender roles. (A parallel analysis holds for anti-male stereotypes, but sexism is more at issue for women because of male societal power; Glick & Fiske, 1999.)\n\nHostile sexism (HS) reflects the familiar form of stereotypes against women, mainly targeting women who do not cooperate with traditional forms of male-female interdependence: resenting women who violate prescriptive gender roles: by competing with men at work, by being sexually controlling, or by rejecting intimate heterosexual relationships. HS targets career women, feminists, and lesbians, for example (Glick et al., 1997), and it openly denigrates such challenging women. HS stereotypes uncooperative women as relatively competent but cold (Eckes, 2002).\n\nThe other form of prejudice, benevolent sexism (BS), is AST's innovation, mainly expressed as patronizing affection for women who cooperate with traditional male-female interdependence; they adhere to prescriptive gender roles: by remaining subordinate to men at work, by being sexually subservient to male requirements, or by embracing prescriptive heterosexual relationships. Subjectively positive for the perceiver, BS subordinates secretaries, cheerleaders, and housewives. Because BS beliefs report cherishing such women, putting them on a pedestal, BS seems benign, but it demonstrably undermines female autonomy and achievement (e.g., Dardenne, Dumont, & Bollier, 2007). BS stereotypes cooperative women as warm but incompetent.\n\nAs two modestly correlated dimensions, HS and BS serve complementary functions: HS punishes women who resist prescriptive gender interdependence, while BS rewards women who comply. This dynamic reinforces both male-female interdependence and male dominance, so it solves our human two-pronged predicament. As such, ambivalent sexism likely was not invented yesterday. (For precedents in the psychology literature, see Glick & Fiske, 1996.)\n\nWe cannot administer the ASI back in time—to see how timeless it might be—but we can compare more and less developed countries in the present. What is striking is the cross-national similarity, albeit with some diminished sexism as nations develop. Across 19 nations and about 15,000 respondents, HS and BS each show reasonable separation and internal coherence in by-country factor analyses and reliabilities (Glick et al., 2000). HS and BS correlate significantly less among men than among women. More sexist people and nations in general show less correlation, more independence of the two dimensions. Perhaps more egalitarian people and places recognize BS as sexism, so they reject both: HS together with BS.\n\nDistinct patterns replicate across countries: Men always score higher than women, especially on HS. The gender gap in BS is smaller because women do not reject it as much as they do HS. Across nations, BS predicts protective but demeaning stereotypes of women who comply with prescriptive gender roles (tender, warm, sweet, sensitive), whereas HS predicts resentment of women who resist prescriptive limitations (jealous, sly, touchy, selfish).\n\nBesides the HS-BS correlations, a few cultural differences do emerge: In more sexist countries, women accept BS relatively more than do women in more egalitarian countries. Perhaps when surrounded by HS, the BS pedestal looks good. If less surrounded by HS, women recognize BS as patronizing and reject it to a greater degree.\n\nMen's hostile sexism correlates with United Nations indices of gender development— women's health, education, and welfare—and gender empowerment—women being in elite professions and government positions. As the dominant group, men's hostility constrains women more than women's hostility to some women constrains either men or women. Male BS correlates with gender development indices as well, but less so. In maintaining male societal dominance, male hostility to female prescription-violators matters more than male benevolence toward female prescription-adherents.\n\nThe gender-development/sexism correlation means that the constraints of male-female interdependence, plus male societal dominance, especially shape less gender-developed societies. Ambivalent sexism's correlation with gender development suggests that this dynamic can change as male dominance decreases and economic development offers opportunities to men and women alike.\n\nBut the twin dimensions, HS and BS, will likely persist, for two reasons: Despite alternative reproductive technologies and childcare for hire, children usually result from and often thrive through parental interdependence, which is usually heterosexual. And as social role theory recognizes, male-dominant, traditional gender roles partly follow from biological factors such as male upper-body strength and female parental investment, as well as from more culturally malleable social structural factors (Eagly & Wood, 2013). Gender stereotypes reflect pervasive human contexts, so ambivalent sexism's patterns remain common across countries, although with cultural variations.\n\nAge Stereotypes\n\nPeople of all ages also depend on each other, and people routinely have family members across the age spectrum. Prescriptive stereotypes characterize ageism (North & Fiske, 2012, 2013a) for many of the same reasons that hold for prescriptive sexism. In the case of age, the interdependence tensions revolve around control over resources and the timing of when elders step aside for the next generation.\n\nPrescriptive stereotypes of older people mandate their resource sharing: Elders who comply are praised; elders who resist are derogated. The contested resource domains include orderly succession (family wealth, job seniority, political power), pooled consumption (healthcare costs, retirement subsidies), and generational identity (music, styles). The role of intergenerational tension appears in evidence of younger raters (as opposed to middle-aged or older ones) most resenting noncompliant elder targets (as opposed to noncompliant targets of other ages). Likewise, youth most reward compliant elders (versus other ages). Individual differences in prescriptive ageism (Succession, Identity, Consumption; North & Fiske, 2013b) predict polarized responses to complying versus resisting elders.\n\nThese prescriptive stereotypes also appear in the default elder stereotype, absent information about individual compliance. Just as the default woman is compliant, so is the default elder. General old-person stereotypes describe elders as doddering but dear: incompetent but warm (Cuddy, Norton, & Fiske, 2005), that is, not a threat. This ambivalent stereotype resembles the default female one, both driven by the prescriptions of interdependence that subordinate one group to the needs of the other, with some mandated reward contingent on cooperating, all in the context of status asymmetry.\n\nThis age-based interdependence appears pervasive across cultures, so our data find elders to be disrespected as incompetent, but liked as warm, in samples around the world (Cuddy & Fiske, 2002). The only samples that admire their old people are African Americans (Fiske, Bergsieker, Russell, & Williams, 2009) and Native Americans (Burkley, Durante, Fiske, Burkley, & Andrade, 2016).\n\nContrary to popular wisdom that Eastern cultures revere their elders, but as the ageist resource-tensions theory predicts, meta-analysis shows the derogation of elders everywhere and by perceivers of all ages (North & Fiske, 2015). Across 23 countries (21,090 participants), elders are most derogated in Asian cultures (especially East Asia, compared with South Asia), compared to Western ones. In the West, elders are most derogated in non-Anglophone Europe, least derogated in Anglophone Europe and other Anglophone Western regions. Consistent with the resource-tension perspective, ageism seems to be a function of a nation's growing elder population, controlling for industrialization. Resource tensions matter because we are intimately interdependent across age categories.\n\nTo be sure, North and I address only anti-elder stereotypes here, saving anti-youth stereotypes for future work. When mentioned, children are universally viewed as high warmth, low competence. But young people are sometimes just moderate on both dimensions (in Canada, England, Kenya, New Zealand, Sweden; Durante et al., 2017), perhaps collapsing over polarized subtypes that combine protected children and contemptible youth. Several youth subtypes at least sometimes appear simply negative (Emos, Goths, Boy Racers, all low-low in New Zealand, as are teens in the US). In other places, young people are the high-high hope for the future (Iraq, Pakistan, Turkey) (see also Kervyn et al., 2015 US data). More systematic work remains to be done.\n\nThe takeaway for elder stereotypes is how prevalent prescriptive ageism appears to be, and how much it reflects resource tensions resulting from cross-age interdependence. But regions do vary, depending on aging populations that strain resources. Like sexism, ageism is a near-universal stereotype, with cultural variations.\n\nClass Stereotypes\n\nSocial classes have predictable stereotypes that do not vary much by culture. As background, consider that a comprehensive map of stereotype content arrays each society's social groups in a warmth X competence space. Warmth (trustworthy, friendly) describes groups' stereotypic intents for cooperation. Competence (capable, agentic) describes their stereotypic ability to act on their intentions (Fiske, 2015; Fiske, Cuddy, Glick, & Xu, 2002). Across dozens of societies, these two dimensions differentiate among social groups (Cuddy et al., 2009; Durante et al., 2013; Durante et al., 2017): a country's own citizens and middle class are stereotyped as high on both, in contrast to the poorest people (refugees, undocumented immigrants, and homeless people), stereotyped as low on both dimensions. The Stereotype Content Model (SCM) innovation is the ambivalent combinations: Rich people for instance are stereotyped as competent but cold, and as noted, older people are stereotyped as warm but incompetent.\n\nThe same two social structural dimensions appear for class as for age and gender. Perceived warmth comes from interdependence: perceived cooperative or competitive and exploitative threat determine stereotypic high or low warmth (Fiske et al., 2002; Kervyn, Fiske, & Yzerbyt, 2015). Middle-class and old people seem warm because they are cooperative, but homeless people and rich people take away resources from others, so they do not seem so warm. In impressions, warmth perceptions (trustworthy, moral) appear to be primary in judgment speed (Willis & Todorov, 2006) and in accounting for variance (Wojciszke, Bazinska, & Jaworski, 1998).\n\nThe other main dimension, stereotypic competence, follows from status. All societies rank their members (Fiske, 2010), often by resources, such as income, wealth, education, job prestige, or titles. The status dimension confers competence on higher-class stereotypes and incompetence on lower-class ones (Fiske, 2011). This pattern holds across cultures: Perceptions of the rich as cold but competent are pervasive, as are perceptions of the poor as warm but incompetent (Durante, Tablante, & Fiske, 2017).\n\nWhy is this rich-versus-poor contrast so consistent? Logic parallel to pervasive patterns of sexism and ageism would suggest a role for prescriptive classism: The poor should know their warm but (in)competent place. Rich people have a stake in maintaining their advantage, so perhaps their rewarding compliance and punishing resistance would apply here, although the interdependence is not as intimate as for age and sex.\n\nConversely, feelings of justice may be served by granting competence to the rich but denying them warmth/honesty. Speculation aside, the poor but warm/honest stereotype and rich but cold/dishonest stereotype have been invoked in system justification (Kay & Jost, 2003) and particularly in supporting societal inequality (Durante et al., 2013).\n\nGranted, some cultural variants occur in class stereotypes. More unequal societies display more ambivalence, as if they have more explaining to do: Rich and poor are more divided, but that inequality may seem more acceptable because it is not just about status. Some poor seem stereotypically deserving (older people, those with disabilities), and some seem not (immigrants, welfare recipients) (Fiske et al., 2002). Likewise, some rich seem stereotypically deserving (doctors, professors), and some seem not (lawyers, CEOs) (Fiske & Dupree, 2014).\n\nMore equal societies show less ambivalence, enfolding together the ingroup poor (welfare recipients), the middle class, and all citizens into the high-high (warm, competent) cluster and excluding as low-low only the outgroup poor (asylum seekers, undocumented immigrants). Everyone else is in the homogeneous ingroup social safety net, where competition is not competent (Durante et al., 2013). The next section elaborates these points.\n\nEthnicity and Race in General\n\nAcross 38 countries and more than 4,000 respondents, Durante et al. (2017) mapped each country's own groups on stereotypic warmth and competence and assessed the degree of ambivalent stereotypes (mixed combinations). Most, or at least equal, numbers of groups land in the ambivalent clusters, compared with univalent ones. As noted, the warmth-competence tradeoff identifies stereotypically deserving poor (e.g., allegedly warm but incompetent disabled people and pitied ethnicities, such as Irish and Italians in the US, at some times; Bergsieker et al., 2012). And the tradeoff also differentiates them from the stereotypically undeserving poor (each nation's homeless, nomads, refugees, or undocumented migrants, which vary by country, but are seen as low on both dimensions; Mexican migrants in the US and Roma in Spain illustrate at this time). At the other extreme, the tradeoff identifies the deserving well off (usually the dominant ethnic group; Whites illustrate in the US and Spain), seen as high on both dimensions. And the tradeoff also differentiates them from the allegedly undeserving well off (usually outsider entrepreneurs; Asians illustrate in the US and Spain currently). Each country's specific history locates different ethnic groups in each stereotype quadrant (but see below for some sporadically similar patterns). Many racial, ethnic, and religious stereotypes are accidents of history.\n\nAs to what predicts ambivalence, as noted earlier (Durante et al., 2013), income inequality (Gini coefficient) correlates with a country's use of ambivalent stereotypes, as if inequality requires more explanation (Durante et al., 2017, replicates this effect with an expanded dataset). Under inequality, deserving and undeserving rich and poor may make the system seem fairer (the US and Latin American countries illustrate this pattern). Under income equality, in contrast, most groups lodge within a more unified national identity, everyone sharing the social safety net, except for resident foreigners (Switzerland and the Scandinavian countries illustrate). Fewer ambivalent stereotypes thus reflect national equality.\n\nThen, using the Global Peace Index, produced by the Institute for Economics and Peace, Durante et al. (2107) measured each nation's relative peace-conflict, discovering two ways to an unambivalent, unified national identity. First, peaceful, equal countries, such as Switzerland and Scandinavia, are unified by harmonious shared identities, favoring the in-group and excluding outsiders, such as refugees, nomads, and undocumented immigrants.\n\nThe other way to national unity is conflict (regardless of equality). In conflict-ridden war zones, such as the Middle East, groups band together against other groups for a united cause. In Pakistan, for instance, the in-group comprises Muslims in general and educated people, but Christians are foes. These stereotype patterns reflect conflict but enforce overall unity.\n\nCountries intermediate on peace-conflict (regardless of equality) include the United States and Latin America, with our mix of indigenous people and long-term flows of immigrants, which together produce more ethnic diversity. Mixed ethnicities and backgrounds challenge intergroup relations in these regions. Intermediate peace-conflict requires a more complex story that includes ambivalence. Nevertheless, if external conflict arises, the country unifies, as during a world war or major terror attack.\n\nIn sum, the ambivalence-inequality correlation is linear: more inequality, more ambivalence. The ambivalence-peace/conflict relationship is curvilinear: both the extremes of peace and conflict minimize ambivalence, but the intermediate levels show ambivalence in stereotype content. Ethnic, race, and religious stereotypes depend on historical moments more than on long-term patterns of interdependence and status."
