        "text": "NOTE: Paisà or paisàn (pai-zahn) is an American Italian slang word, meaning “buddy” or “compatriot”.\n\nNominated for both the Academy Award for Best Writing (Original Screenplay) and the BAFTA Award for Best Film from any source, Paisà/Paisan was the most popular Italian film at the box office in 1945-46 – though not in Italy (for reasons that may become clear).\n\nBosley Crowther of the New York Times warned that Paisà was not an ordinary film, “neither in form nor dramatic construction nor in the things it has to say.” But he ended his review by saying, “This is a film to be seen—and seen again.”\n\nPLOT\n\nThe film enmeshes scenes involving military personnel and civilians with documentary footage of the Italian Campaign during the liberation of Italy between 1943 and 1944. It presents six distinct and seemingly unconnected fictional episodes.\n\nSimply called ‘Episode I’, ‘Episode II’ etc., the action of the stories takes place, respectively, in Sicily (Episode I), Naples (Episode II), Rome (Episode III), Florence (Episode IV), a monastery in the Appenine Range (Episode V), and Porte Tolle in the Po delta (Episode VI).\n\nPRODUCTION\n\nAlthough director, Roberto Rossellini, was unable to obtain funding from international investors, he was successful in persuading MGM to take over distribution of the movie in the United States. This was extremely unusually for a film with much dialogue that was not in English.\n\nRosselini would become known as a leading exponent of a location centred film style (exemplified in this shot of post-war Florence), called Italian neo-realism – although at this time the term had not yet been coined.\n\nNEO-REALISM\n\nIt would be another 3 years before the term ‘neo-realism’ became a category that critics could apply as an umbrella term. It is controversial because the so-called neo-realist directors did not recognise it and nor does it constitute a school or a movement. Nevertheless Paisà/Paisan became a defining film of the neo-realist label – perhaps because it vividly represents the socio-economic reality of poverty and suffering in post-war Italy.\n\nBut in many ways Paisà already pushes what would later be seen as episodic tendencies of neo-realism to their logical conclusion. The narrative segments are linked by documentary footage in ways that blur the transition between documentary and fiction.\n\nIn this respect it is interesting to view the film as an extension/ articulation of Rossellini’s experience so far. Like Carmela (shown in this shot), for example, Rosselini had learned that treading a difficult path between power groups was an important life skill.\n\nINCEPTION\n\nRoberto Rosselini (1906 – 1977) was born into privilege with servants and a chauffeur to take him round the city in one of the first cars in Rome.\n\nHis wealthy father had many friends and the family home was often filled with a salon of visiting artists and intellectuals, who were often to be found discussing aesthetics and philosophy.\n\nMoreover, because his father’s construction company had built both the Corso and the Barberini cinemas in town, Roberto had a free pass and this enabled him to become immerse in the movies.\n\nWhen his father died (in 1932) his contacts at the Corso in the Spazio Etoile (shown below – it is now a Louis Vuitton shop) helped him find work in the film business. He started by doing odd jobs on the sets and by 1936 – no doubt because of his background – he had been given the chance to make his own films.\n\nHis first films were mainly fanciful short features but seemingly they got him noticed by those who mattered. He was soon introduced to the Cinema Magazine set, which included Luchino Visconti and Vittorio Mussolini, the son of Il Duce.\n\nThus Rosselini learning his craft in a Fascist state-sponsored film institute (along with the other filmmakers of his generation), making films like La nave bianca (The White Ship, 1941), which won the Cup of the National Fascist Party in Venice, and L’uomo dalla croce (The Man with the Cross, 1943), a tale of Italian victory released on the eve of Italy’s capitulation.\n\nThe German occupation of Rome in September, 1943 was followed by round-ups of citizens, a curfew, mass murder and Allied bombings. In the vicious winter that followed there was little food or heat and January, 1944 found Rosselini 50 pounds lighter. He had not reported to Venice to make more films for Mussolini and, with no ration card, he had been reduced to eating arugula growing between paving slabs at the roadside.\n\nOn hearing that Americans had landed only 40 miles away at Anzio, Rosselini hoped for a swift denouement, but months went by as he huddled in shelters with artists and writers, political thinkers and partisans dreaming of the new world that would be possible when peace came.\n\nBut it was not until June that he cycled down the city walls and encountered his first GI’s, who called him ‘Paisan’ – Italian American slang for ‘buddy.’\n\nIn Piazza del Spagna that night a script girl ran into the arms of a man who she later recalled as being “pale, thin as a poplar and smoking a Camel.” “We have to make a film,” he said. “Right now. All we have to do is look around us and we’ll find all the stories we need.”\n\nThe result was this film.\n\nACTORS AND STYLE\n\nNeo-realist film would later rejoice in using non-actors and it is true that characters like Carmela, in the first episode, and Cigiolani in the last were played by non-professionals. Nevertheless, although Rossellini would claim that “Paisan is a film without actors”, this is an exaggeration. Many of the American performers were professional (though largely unknown), and according to Federico Fellini (one of the film’s scriptwriters and an assistant director on the film), Rossellini at one point was hoping to attract Gregory Peck, Lana Turner and Paul Robeson.\n\nThe rough, outdoor style of this and many so-called neo-realist films can be explained in pragmatic terms. With the Cinecittà studios bombed and the Italian economy in tatters, films could no longer be made as they had been and so a semi-documentary aesthetic was a practical response to there being no Italian studio system.\n\nThe neo-realism Rossellini offers in these brusque, stories with off-hand endings, weak causes, incomplete, fragmentary motivations and failed communication, suggest an unbridgeable gap between humanity and the real: they effectively recognize a suffering to which humanity is condemned, causing some to call Rosselini a spiritual or even metaphysical filmmaker."
