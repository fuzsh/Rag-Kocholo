        "text": "This weekend, Rice Cinema and the Menil Collection will be joining forces for an outdoor screening of a film by someone who is considered the master of Italian neo-realist cinema.\n\nOn April 9, Roberto Rossellini’s 1946 film “Paisan” will be shown on the Menil’s front lawn. The second film in Rossellini’s “war trilogy,” nestled between his 1945 classic “Rome, Open City” and his 1948 melodrama “Germany, Year Zero,” “Paisan” (“fellow countryman” in Italian) is an episodic film. Made in the aftermath of World War II with a cast of actors and nonprofessionals, the movie consists of several stories where American soldiers and Italians try to communicate with each other during the Italian campaign, when Nazi Germany was losing against the Allies.\n\nThe screening — which was slated for February but got postponed due to you-know-what — is part of the closing weekend of the Menil Drawing Institute’s exhibition “Silent Revolutions: Italian Drawing From the Twentieth Century,” which is on view through April 16.\n\n“(Menil public-programs director) Lauren Pollock called me,” says Charles Dove, Rice Cinema programmer and film-studies professor. “They’ve been doing some outdoor screenings there and she wanted to do one with us. … We like to partner with them whenever we can. We’re closely related to them, obviously.”\n\nRice Cinema and the Menil have a relationship that spans decades. After all, Rice Media Center was established in 1970 by John and Dominique de Menil, the husband-and-wife philanthropists/art patrons. In fact, the de Menils invited Rossellini to Houston that same year to help them develop the film program.\n\n“It’s an interesting story,” says Dove, “and a lot of people don’t know he had come to Houston to work as a teacher. It’s good to publicize that, because he is one of the more important film directors — especially of that era, the postwar period.” (Dove divulged that his mother remembers him more as “the center of the Ingrid Bergman scandal, where she left her husband and ran off with him.”)\n\nOn April 10, Rice Cinema will have its own Rossellini screening, showing an hour’s worth of archival footage of the director speaking at Rice, which also includes him interviewing the de Menils. “He lived in Houston for several years,” says Dove. “We had (his daughter) Isabella here a few years back, and she talked about being a teenager in Houston and how strange that was for her.”\n\nIsabella would return to Rice to honor her father, who passed away in 1977 back in his hometown of Rome, a couple of times. First, she was here in 1987, to kick off a retrospective of her father’s films. In 2010, she returned to introduce her dad’s 1954 drama, “My Journey to Italy.” (This was part of that year’s Houston Cinema Arts Festival, where Isabella was the recipient of the fest’s first Levantine Films Cinema Arts Award.)\n\nWith Rice Media Center shutting down in June (Dove has to keep mum on the “big plans” Rice has involving it, but says Rice Cinema will be located to Sewall Hall at the end of the semester), this weekend can also be seen as a celebration of what the Rice Media Center and Rice Cinema have given to lovers of the cinematic arts over the years — and will continue to keep on giving. As Dove says, “We’re a program. We’re a part of the university, you know. We’re gonna survive.”\n\nCraig Lindsey is a Houston-based writer."
