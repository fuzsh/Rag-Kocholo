        "text": "507\n\nMove over cannoli, there’s a new kind of feast coming to New Jersey! “Paisan Con,” the state’s first Italian-American pop culture convention, invades Fairfield on April 13 and 14. This two-day extravaganza promises something for everyone who loves Italian-American heritage and entertainment.\n\nStars Align for Sopranos Fans and Beyond\n\nFans of The Sopranos won’t wanna miss this. Lorraine Bracco (Dr. Jennifer Melfi) and Federico Castelluccio (Furio Giunta) are just a taste of the stars scheduled to appear. Giants quarterback Tommy “Cutlets” DeVito, legendary Mets reliever John Franco, and Godfather actor Gianni Russo also join the fun.\n\nCelebrating More Than the Mob\n\nWhile The Sopranos might be a highlight, Paisan Con is about showcasing the full spectrum of Italian-American contributions to pop culture, sports and beyond. From food and music to fashion and art, the convention aims to celebrate the rich tapestry of Italian-American culture. That’s what makes this event so special.\n\nFairfield: The Heart of Jersey’s “Little Italy”\n\nWhy Fairfield? This Essex County town boasts the highest percentage of Italian ancestry in the U.S., making it the perfect place to honor Italian-American heritage. Paisan Con offers more than just meet-and-greets. Attendees can test their skills in a pasta-eating contest and a “meatball throwdown” (because is it gravy or sauce, really?). There will also be film screenings, art exhibits, and vendor booths.\n\nPaisan Con: More Than Just a Name\n\nThe name “Paisan Con” comes from “paesano,” the Italian word for countryman or friend. This event is all about celebrating the deep bonds within the Italian-American community.\n\nTickets on Sale Now!"
