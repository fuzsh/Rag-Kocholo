        "text": "Italian filmmaker Matteo Garrone's best-known works have focused on austere yet authentic portrayals of Italian society, including crime dramas Gomorrah (2008) and Dogman (2018), as well as the filmmaker's singular take on Pinocchio (2019). However, his latest film, Io Capitano, harkens back to his earliest work, the 1996 immigration docudrama Terra di mezzo, albeit from a new perspective.\n\n\"I chose Dogman and Pinocchio, but Io Capitano chose me,\" Garrone says. \"I put the service of the story in the hands of the people who usually don't have a voice. I had the idea to take a reverse shot of what we are used to seeing, so I put the camera on the other side and tried to tell the story from their point of view. I also decided to do that in a language I didn't know.\"\n\nIo Capitano is a Homeric fairy tale about two Senegalese boys who risk their lives on a perilous journey from their homes in Dakar to Italy. Eight years in the making and shot in Senegal, Italy, and Morocco, the film is inspired by the experiences of real-life immigrants who have made the treacherous journey themselves.\n\nWhen Io Capitano debuted at the 80th Venice International Film Festival, Garrone was awarded the Silver Lion for Best Director, while star Seydou Sarr won the Marcello Mastroianni Award for Best Young Actor. At the 96th Oscars, Io Capitano is nominated for Best International Feature Film â€” Garrone's first nomination.\n\n\"When you make a movie, the most important thing is reaching the most people,\" he says of the nomination. \"Because of the nomination, Io Capitano has been rereleased in Italy, and it will be released in 20 countries in Africa, which is very unusual. Also, because of that, they will see what the risk is when making this journey.\"\n\nAs different as Garrone's features have been, they all strive to capture reality and present it in a new and unique way. Below, he shares with A.frame five of the films that have most inspired his filmic sensibilities, including the two masters of Italian neorealism that he most admires."
