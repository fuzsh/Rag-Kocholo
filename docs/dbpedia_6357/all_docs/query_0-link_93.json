What makes a film a work of Realism cannot be found in the mannerisms of the actors, nor the style with which it has been shot and directed, but rather with the mode of representation that brings to light, or expresses, the affections that determine \"attitudes, or types of behaviour\" in an environment. This is why it as easy to call Rossellini’s classic work Realism as it is his history films.\n\n2. We should not be under the illusion that ‘Reality’ or the ‘Real’ can be directly represented. The ‘Real’ only has conventional existence; that is to say, it is constructed; it is the thin layer, rippling and amorphous, which covers our social existence.\n\n3. Representation always finds conceptual mediation through four forms, or four ‘aspects’ of reason: identity, analogy, opposition, and resemblance.\n\n4. It is not conceptual identity or Sameness of representation which produces pale or poor representations of Reality, so much as it is the vulgarisation of technique, or ‘academicism’.\n\n5. Thus, to approach filmmaking with the notion of Reality at the forefront of one’s mind, as opposed to what one knows and experiences as Reality (and how best to express it), is a mistake which can only lead to a bad film.\n\n6. Likewise, the great fallacy surrounding Reality and cinema is that the technology of the camera grants it easier access to reality than the other art forms. We shouldn’t conflate matter/material existence with ‘Reality’, even if they share the same ontological ground.\n\n…"
