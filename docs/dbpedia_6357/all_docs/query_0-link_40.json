We witness Pete going through the police academy and he rises through the ranks quickly to detective. He receives a caveat from a retired cop that he should watch his back and realize his fellow officers aren't as straight and narrow as he is. During a drug bust, Pete is faced with the ultimate choice - come to the dark side or become a statistic."
