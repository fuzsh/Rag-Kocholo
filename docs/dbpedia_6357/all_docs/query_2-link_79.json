        "text": "Paisà / Paisan (1946), directed by Roberto Rossellini.\n\nRoberto Rossellini (1906-1977) was important in the rise of Italian film in the mid-20th century. He started making films around age thirty, and had already made ten or more films – I’m not sure what length – by the time of Roma città aperta (1945). Some of these in the early 1940s are referred to as a ‘Fascist trilogy’, suggesting that Rossellini’s early work was happy to accommodate or collaborate with the Mussolini regime. But his fame derives mainly from later work, from the end of the war onwards. That includes films about the war, in the 1940s, and films more about other aspects of Italy, from the 1950s, including those with Ingrid Bergman who became his wife. Roma città aperta, as I’ve said, didn’t make a huge technical impression on me: its vaunted neo-realism was less different from classical US style than I might have expected. Paisà is the follow-up. Where Roma città aperta depicts life in Rome under Nazi occupation, Paisà shows Italy during the invasion by US (and occasionally UK) troops, fighting the Wehrmacht into retreat and relieving cities from Fascist rule. (The consistent implication is that this is ‘liberation’ from tyranny, but presumably many of these Italians had voted at least their local version of Fascism into power in the first place, and supported it; the picture must be more ambivalent.)\n\nOver two hours long, Paisà is highly episodic. It comprises six vignettes, written by six different writers including Klaus Mann (son of Thomas!), Federico Fellini (who seems to have collaborated much with Rossellini), and Alfred Hayes, author of the radical folk song ‘Joe Hill’. Quite a team, quite a project. The six stories are as follows. One (written by Klaus Mann): US troops land on the Sicilian coast and occupy a ruined tower, guided by young local woman Carmela. She is left with GI Joe, who is shot by a German sniper; she then sacrifices herself shooting one of the Germans, and the returning GIs wrongly view her as a traitor. The sense is of tragedy: her well-intended actions are never known and she dies wrongly accused. This conforms to a theme of cross-cultural communication and its difficulty: one GI, of Sicilian ancestry, can talk Italian, but others can’t; we see them trying to make the best assessment of what locals are saying; Joe tries to communicate across the divide with Carmela, a little like the British soldier and local Irish girl in Brian Friel’s Translations (1980). The Germans also speak their own language, which I receive in subtitles; their thoughts of Carmela are cruder than the Americans’.\n\nTwo: an African American Military Policeman, also called Joe (Dots Johnson), is careering drunkenly around Naples. He falls in with one of many local street urchins, Pasquale. In a fascinating scene they go to a puppet show where a white puppet, ‘Orlando’, is fighting a ‘Blackamoor’ (I think of the start of Woolf’s Orlando): black man Joe leaps to the stage and starts fighting the white puppet himself. Later the urchin steals his boots; finding him again, Joe travels to his derelict home and realises with pathos that the boy is an orphan, his parents killed by bombs. (Perhaps American bombs?) Three: Rome has been liberated by GIs – we see them arriving on newsreel footage. Six months later the mood has soured; drunken GIs hang out in bars and wonder why Roman women are less freshly enthusiastic than they were. One such woman, Francesca – a prostitute? A hanger-on? I can’t really tell – ducks the police and brings a drunken GI back to her place: for company I think, not money. He talks woozily – and we see the flashback – of how when the US troops arrived in Rome, he met a young Roman woman who gave him water, but never saw her again. Francesca realises that it was she. That she didn’t recognise him before, if this romantically meant so much, doesn’t make much sense (and the motif of non-recognition also applied in Part Two with the urchin). She leaves her address and waits for him: he doesn’t turn up, but leaves Rome the next day with cynical tone intact. The level of tragedy here is less than in the first story’s ending, but the tone is still of pathos, opportunity missed.\n\nFour: the Wehrmacht are struggling to defend Florence from US and British invasion, and from committed, gun-toting Italian partisans. Two British officers look at the city from a hill and calmly comment on its belltowers, comparing one church to Salisbury Cathedral: comic. Harriet (Harriet Medin: automatic naming seems to be going on here as it will in Rohmer) is an English nurse who has an unspecified bond with a Florentine painter, who is also mysteriously ‘Lupo’, ‘the wolf’ and the leader of the partisans (this all seems too much for one character to bear). Rashly she travels through the city with another partisan, Massimo, seeking to see his family. Their itinerary takes them, a bit thrillingly, through a tunnel which I think is the same as the Vasari Corridor; and, in picaresque manner, out through another partisan post. After a gunbattle, a wounded partisan tells Harriet that Lupo has been killed, which is dismaying for her. The pathos doesn’t work so well for a viewer, though, as we’ve never seen that character and have no sense of the substance of their relationship. The excitement in this section, rather, is about the strategic view of the city and its street-fighting men.\n\nFive, written by Alfred Hayes: a monastery has survived the war as German troops retreat. Three US Army chaplains stop at the monastery and ask to spend the night. They’re welcomed, until it’s mentioned that one is a Protestant and one Jewish. The monks demand that the Catholic chaplain seek to convert his colleagues. He declines, and talks to them in the same tone he’s had throughout: not just reasonable but rolling, verbose, even grandiosely humane. Actor William Tubbs catches this beatific tone well. The vignette is very peaceful – for once no shot is fired – and for a while it seems that no conflict will happen at all, until the religious divisions arise. The sixth and last tale presents itself as an untold story, as it involves secret forces: members of the US OSS, precursors of the CIA, are fighting alongside partisans in the delta of the River Po. The whole scenario is watery: boats on rivers amid high reeds; bodies floating; a German gunboat attacking the shore. This time, for once, the Allied side is defeated: the Germans capture most of them and throw overboard those partisans not covered as POWs by the Geneva Convention. And the whole film ends.\n\nApart from its episodic character, a notable formal feature of this film is its use of newsreel footage. Each of the six episodes, specifically shot by actors with Rossellini, is preceded by more impersonal footage from the real war: soldiers landing or advancing, tanks and transports moving, GIs arriving in Rome to floral tributes. Each vignette is thus situated as a local illustration of a historical action, and the range of locations is notable: Sicily, Naples, Rome, Florence, the monastery (unsure of this location), Po Delta on the Adriatic Sea. This gives the film a sweeping sense of geography and history on the march, which is exciting. It also plays into questions of realism. The newsreel is real (but staged, in some cases, as well as selected?). The Rossellini footage is neo-realist – well, it often feels more that way than Roma città aperta did to me, not least when dialogue is overlapping or muffled. A more unusual, very persistent feature of the film is conversation between people whose first languages are different, or who can barely speak each other’s languages at all. I watch with English subtitles for the Italian and German speech. Maybe many Italians did the reverse: those hardbitten wisecracking GIs, who sound so familiar to me, were the ones rendered through the distance of writing? It’s remarkable that a major Italian film should be so extensively not in Italian. It’s not just that the GIs’ words are literally not Italian, but that they bring their own style, habitus, idiom – in fact you could say it’s as if they’re in an American film, meeting people from an Italian film, on the same screen. Split into six parts, Paisà is an unusual war film, but it’s one of the best I can remember. It restores my interest in Rossellini."
