        "text": "I can't remember the last time I came out of an American movie feeling something more than the release of tension or the relief of a story neatly resolved by the hero.\n\nI started going to movies before the PG guidance code. A lot of European films were showing up is so-called art cinemas. A film that made a tremendous impression on me was Fellini's \"La Strada\", The Street.\n\nFilmed in Italy in 1954, black and white, borrowed cameras and dubbed sound. Anthony Quinn, Mexican by birth and already a famous star came over an did the movie for almost nothing.\n\nThis great film is a lasting work of art and an historical document of post war Italy. Still war ravaged Italy where nobody had a pot to pee in it shows real people that have nothing more than the clothes on their back trying to survive.\n\n[ame=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jeEhdEwPM2Q]Scorsese On La Strada - YouTube[/ame]\n\nHulo might have it for free, I'm not sure, but try to watch it and overlook the technical inadequacies because that is not what is important in this great film..\n\nWatch La Strada online | Free | Hulu\n\nI have seen Bicycle Thieves and I agree. People were so poor they pawned their bedding.\n\nBut a word about contemporary American cinema.\n\nThey are vivid with color, computer graphics depicting implausible special effects, extravagant plotlines and shallow characters. There are exceptions but it seems fewer and fewer. I passed by an octoplex and did not see one movie worth seeing. If I do see one it is amazing how quickly these pulp movies vanish from my memory. That's what we should call them, \"Pulp Movies\"\n\nI've met young people who won't watch a movie if it is in black and white. Maybe it is because visual entertainment is to zone-out on and not exercise the mind or the emotions.\n\nWell, Fellini was above, simply above [above all ...].\n\nHe lived movie as a different dimension, something may be beyond reality, even more than neorealism.\n\nPersonally I see \"Roma città aperta\", by Rossellini with Anna Magnani, as the symbol of that period. That was the era of \"Cinecittà\". US Majors came to Rome to make great movies [think to Cleopatras, Benhur ... Cinecittà in Rome knew its golden age in those years].\n\nItalians from that period remember overall great movies with De Sica [Vittorio] and Sophia Loren. A mention of Gina Lollobriggida is a duty here: she was so \"American\" that many Italians thought she was American ...\n\nAn other great example of Italian cinema of those years was\n\n\"I soliti ignoti\" by Monicelli [which I suggest to take a look].\n\nBut probably Monicelli made the masterpiece: \"La Grande Guerra\".\n\nSimply exceptional.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhvD9rGUnrE"
