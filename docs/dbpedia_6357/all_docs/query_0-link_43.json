        "text": "Rice Cinema will be set up at the Menil Collection for an outdoor screening of:\n\nPAISAN\n\nby Roberto Rossellini\n\nMenil Collection, Front Lawn\n\nFriday, April 9 // 8 PM ** DUE to rain rescheduled for\n\nSUNDAY, April 11 // 8 PM\n\nThe Menil Collection and Rice Cinema co-present an outdoor screening of Roberto Rossellini’s neorealist war drama, Paisan (1946, 126 minutes). Made in the aftermath of WWII and with an intermingled cast of actors and nonprofessionals, the film explores the struggles of different cultures to communicate, and of people to live their everyday lives in extreme circumstances.\n\nThe outdoor screening will take place on the front lawn of the Menil at 1533 Sul Ross Street, between Mandell and Mulberry Streets. Please bring your own picnic blankets or lawn chairs; seating is available on a first-come, first-served basis. Guests are required to abide by the Menil Collection’s COVID-19 safety protocols by maintaining social distance (at least 6 feet between each household) and wearing a face mask that covers your nose and mouth unless eating or drinking. Additional Menil green space policies apply. Further information regarding accessibility and parking can be found here. Please note that in the event of inclement weather, the program will be held on Sunday, April 11 at 8pm.\n\nPlan ahead and visit the Menil’s exhibition Silent Revolutions: Italian Drawings from the Twentieth Century, curated by Edouard Kopp and Irina Zucca Alessandrelli, before the screening by reserving your free timed entry. Silent Revolutions is the first large-scale survey of twentieth-century Italian drawings mounted in the United States. The exhibition, presenting works largely selected from the Collezione Ramo in Milan, features 70 drawings by Umberto Boccioni, Alighiero Boetti, Giorgio de Chirico, Lucio Fontana, Jannis Kounellis, Maria Lai, Carol Rama, and others. The works on view are augmented with several drawings from the Menil’s own collection.\n\nAdditional programming at Rice Cinema:\n\nA screening of rare archival footage of Roberto Rossellini speaking at Rice Media Center will be shown Saturday, April 10, at 8pm.
