        "text": "On Sunday (July 28), Christian Milian announced that she has a new bundle of joy on the way, and on Monday (July 29), the singer’s ex-husband, singer, songwriter, and producer The-Dream took to Instagram to publicly congratulate her.\n\nhttps://www.instagram.com/p/B0fcILHHUK4/\n\n“I’m Delighted to wait the arrival and Welcome the Beautiful Being that’s on the way for @christinamilian and @mattpokora. What most may not know is I’ve asked for this moment to be Realized more than I can count,” The-Dream wrote.\n\n“I have also made my best efforts at making sure whoever was in your life loved You and Adored You! I’ve Said if it’s Love do not hide it in the Dark let it inspire us in the light. I am so happy for You Tina most of all. ”\n\nThe “Purple Kisses” singer also mentioned how he’s happy that Milian no longer has to wait for another child.\n\n“Beyond this Business there is a common love that sometimes get left behind. A child itself can not Will that love but two people who love each other can will that love into a child. I told you recently and asked what are you waiting for.I’m glad the wait is over!” The-Dream wrote.\n\nThe Grammy Award-winning songwriter then gave Christina Milian a little relationship advice, before tagging her boyfriend and letting him know that he approves of him.\n\n“This time around Make sure no one comes in between your happiness and will to love and be loved! Love who you want and how you want! @mattpokora I believe in you based off of our convo she has the Right human being to stand beside,” The-Dream continued.\n\n“Sending You much Love and Joy! You both should be Elated and do not dismiss a moment of this journey it goes by at light speed it seems!” The-Dream concluded, before mentioning that he and his wife, both send the couple “infinite love.”\n\nThe-Dream and Christina Milian began dating in early 2009, following his divorce from R&B singer Nivea. The former couple tied the knot in September 2009 in Las Vegas, but five months later The-Dream filed for divorce from the “Dip It Low” singer, nine days before she gave birth to their daughter, Violet Madison Nash. The former couple both announced their split on July 12, 2010. Their divorce became final in October of 2011.\n\nIn early 2014, The-Dream began dating his current wife, LaLonne Martinez and the pair wed in July 2014. The-Dream and Martinez share four children together, while the singer shares three children with his other ex-wife, Nivea, and one child with ex-girlfriend Lydia Nam.\n\nGlennisha Morgan is a Detroit-bred multimedia journalist and writer.
