        "text": "Christina Milian stars in Netflix's newly released feel-good rom-com Falling Inn Love. And while her character finds a beau, what's her dating life like in real life?\n\nAs an outsider looking in, it's very clear that Christina Milian, 37, and her boyfriend Matt Pokora, 33, are head over heels for each other.\n\nThe couple have been dating since August 2017 after meeting at a restaurant in France, which she revealed on E! News's Daily Pop. When the manager of the restaurant they were both at suggested they talk since they're both musicians, she wasn't interested in talking to him. But after catching a glimpse of his handsome looks, she changed her mind.\n\n\"So we switched numbers, found out we had the same birthday that night, and it was like the stars aligned,\" she said. What else made their coupling seem like fate? Well, Milian said that later that night, Pokora told her about a gut feeling he had: that they'd one day welcome a baby. \"He told me, 'We're going to have a child together.' ... I've never had anybody say that to me,\" she said, explaining that after she revealed she already had a daughter, he said, \"Well, you don't have a son.\"\n\nFast forward to July, when Milian revealed on Instagram the two were expecting their first child together. On August 12, she posted a picture from the gender reveal announcing they were expecting a boy.\n\nTheir son will be little brother to Milian's 9-year-old daughter, Violet, with ex-husband The-Dream. When Pokora first met Milian, he also expressed wanting to be a part of Violet's life. \"From the beginning he was interested in meeting my daughter. He was on it. It was so nice. I've never seen anybody be like that,\" she added on Daily Pop.\n\nIt's clear the stars did align for Milian and Pokora. So, in honor of their relationship, let's take a walk down memory lane on how it all started.\n\nAugust 2017: Christina Milian and Matt Pokora start dating.\n\nLike previously mentioned, the couple met at a restaurant in France, which is where Pokora is originally from.\n\nThe French singer and songwriter, who's real name is Matthieu Tota, has released eight studio albums in his career. In 2016, he became a coach on The Voice Kids France and in 2011 won the inaugural season of France's version of Dancing with the Stars.\n\nHis latest album, , made it to number one on the French music charts when it was released in April 2019.\n\nNovember 2017: Milian and Pokora make their red carpet debut.\n\nMilian supported her boyfriend at the 2017 NRJ Music Awards (which is equivalent to the Billboard Music Awards) in France. This marked their first time walking a red carpet together.\n\nMid 2018: Pokora moves to L.A. to be closer to Milian.\n\nWhen the Falling Inn Love star appeared on The Real in August 2018, it was revealed that she was no longer in a long distance relationship with Pokora because he had recently moved to L.A. from France.\n\n\"We have the best time together. I could spend every day with him, every moment. It's been cool! We just have a good time,\" she said.\n\nIn a May 2019 interview with Hollywood Life, Milian echoed the same happy sentiment.\n\n\"I'm really happy with the type of person I'm with. He's honest, and we have a really great relationship. This is different than anything I've ever experienced and I'm really happy that the universe brought us together,\" she said.\n\nIn that same interview, Milian revealed she wanted to have more kids.\n\n\"I definitely want to have another child in the future. I don't know when it would be, but I kind of feel like because I know I want two, I know that whenever it happens, I'll be ready! I’ll let God handle that!\" she said.\n\nJuly 2019: Milian and Pokora announce they are expecting a child together.\n\nAfter almost two years of dating, Milian and Pokora announced they were going to be parents with the adorable pregnancy reveal the two posted on Instagram.\n\nAugust 2019: Pokora and Milian reveal the baby's sex.\n\nIt's as if Pokora knew the future because, as mentioned above, the first night they met, he told Milian he was going to give her a son. Now, almost two years later, the couple is indeed having a boy.\n\nWe can't wait to see what the two decided to name him!"
