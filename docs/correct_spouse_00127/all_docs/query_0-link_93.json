        "text": "Morning yall…sorry for the delay. Busy days….yall know how that goes.\n\nFirst, I would like to say a belated congrats to Mr. and Mrs. Carmelo and LaLa Anthony (FINALLY!!! Better late than never) and Martin Lawrence and his girlfriend on their marriages. I hope that it works better than this couple here….\n\nSmh so The-Dream and Christina Milian have split. Can’t say I’m surprised by this news. There have been rumors circulating for a while that something wasn’t right between them. Then yesterday, that pic with Dream rubbing all on whoever that chick was came out, and then this statement was given to Us Magazine:\n\n“Terius ‘The-Dream’ Nash is saddened to announce that his marriage to Christina Milian was unsuccessful. The couple reached this decision in late 2009, but decided to keep the news private in efforts to protect their baby daughter Violet. They ask for consideration and respect for their family moving forward.”\n\nChristina hit Twitter yesterday, and it seems she had a little bit of an issue with her soon to be ex-husband’s PDA.\n\nDidn’t they just get married in like September? Smh celebrity marriages sometimes. Quick to happen, quick to end. Hmmm…well apparently Mr. Nash didn’t develop a prenup for Christina, so yeah get your money girl! Especially since he doesn’t seem to be caring for your child all that much! Hopefully the divorce doesn’t get nasty, for Baby Violet’s sake.\n\nPEACE.\n\nMorning yall…sorry for the delay.

Hopefully the divorce doesn’t get nasty, for Baby Violet’s sake.\n\nPEACE.\n\nWell we have some new celeb babies to welcome into the world!\n\nR&B singer Christina Milian and her husband The-Dream (aka Terius Nash) now have a baby girl! Violet Madison Nash was born this past Friday, Christina’s rep confirmed to UsMagazine.com. Violet was delivered via c-section and weighed 6 lbs., 10 oz. Christina and The Dream were married last September. I must be one of the only people who wanted Christina and Nick Cannon to stay together LOL but The Dream and Christina make a cute couple I guess.\n\nKeyshia Cole and her fiance Cleveland Cavaliers player Daniel Gibson were also expecting. They were blessed with a baby boy Daniel Hiram Gibson Jr. on Tuesday at 11:54 p.m., weighing in at 7 pounds, 3 ounces. Keyshia was looking like she was ready to burst! She and Christina both!\n\nCongratulations to these first time mommies, the fathers and their families! Even though Keyshia cut hers off LOL Hey sometimes you gotta do what you gotta do in order to get some peace in your life. I feel you Keysh. Hopefully we can get some pics of the babies soon!!!\n\nPEACE.\n\n~Brittany Shawnté\n\nWell we have some new celeb babies to welcome into the world!\n\nR&B singer Christina Milian and her husband The-Dream (aka Terius Nash) now have a baby girl!

Christina Milian has confirmed that she and The-Dream will be walking down the aisle soon.\n\n“We don’t have plans yet — but it hasn’t [already] happened, that I can confirm,” Milian, 27, told Us Magazine at Saturday’s Venom Energy and Trainwreck party for music executive Billy Clark, of her upcoming wedding. “We just want to have our closest friends and family there; it’s not going to be too big.” The-Dream gave her a six-carat ring from Ivanka Trump’s jewelry line.\n\nAnd apparently, the couple is even thinking about kids. “I love kids, and [Christina] loves kids probably more than I do,” The-Dream told Us Magazine. The-Dream already has a daughter from his previous marriage with singer Nivea. This will be Christina’s first marriage.\n\nWell, congratulations you two! Hopefully this marriage works out! I think they’re cute together! And as far as kids, I’m sure they’ll be great parents. Congratulations!\n\nPEACE.\n\n~Brittany Shawnté"
