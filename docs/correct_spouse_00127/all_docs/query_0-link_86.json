        "text": "CHRISTINA Milian gave birth to a baby boy named Kenna with her partner Matt Pokora on Friday.\n\nThe singer and actress, 39, shared a sweet snap of herself cradling her \"blessed\" third child in hospital.\n\nChristina already has a one-year-old son Isaiah with Matt and a 10-year-old daughter Violet with ex-husband The-Dream.\n\nThe star wrote on Instagram: \"Kenna, Welcome to the world baby boy! Wow, what an adventure we’ve been on since the day he was conceived!\n\n\"I thank God everyday for blessing me with his super active energy (wonder where he gets it from?) and now to meet our healthy baby boy?!\n\n\"Thankful. Blessed.\"\n\nChristina - who announced her pregnancy in December - added: \"Now it’s party of 5 baby!\n\n\"Thank you my @mattpokora for being the best partner/dad/ best friend a woman could ask for. You’re a king in my eyes.\"\n\nMusician Matt also shared a black and white photo of himself cradling their newborn, and wrote alongside it in his native French.\n\nThe sweet caption translates to: \"Welcome my son… our little Kenna is doing well, and his mom, once again, was incredible. Everyone is doing fine. #blessed.\"\n\nChristian and Matt announced at the end of 2020 that they were expecting their second child with a sweet shoot on Instagram.\n\n“You and Me + 3 #morelove,\" Christina captioned a photo of the French singer kneeling down on a beach and kissing her stomach.\n\nIn the second, their son Isaiah rested his hand on her growing belly.\n\nAccording to French magazine Public, the couple got married shortly before they made the pregnancy announcement, although this has not been confirmed.\n\nIn Christina's birth post on Friday, she could be seen wearing a silver band on her wedding finger, while Matt sported a chunky jeweled ring on his left hand.\n\nThey started dating in August 2017 following a meet-up at a restaurant in France after a manager suggested the two musicians get to know one another.\n\nTwo years later, they revealed they were expecting their first child together, and Isaiah was born on January 20, 2020.\n\nChristina was previously married to The-Dream, with the two eloping in Las Vegas, Nevada in September 2009.\n\nThe duo separated just a few months later, before welcoming their daughter Violet in February 2010.\n\nTheir divorce was finalized in late 2011."
