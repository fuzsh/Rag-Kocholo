        "text": "American real estate investor and TV personality\n\nChristina Meursinge Hall (previously El Moussa & Anstead, née Haack; born July 9, 1983) is an American real estate investor and TV personality. She previously co-starred on HGTV's show Flip or Flop alongside her then-husband Tarek El Moussa and the HGTV show, Christina on the Coast. In 2023, she began starring in HGTV's Christina in the Country.\n\nHall was born in Anaheim, California.[1] She has a sister, Carly, who is ten years younger.[2][3] She went to school in southern California and graduated from Canyon High School in Anaheim, California in 2001 and began working in the real estate industry after graduating from San Diego State University.[4] In 2005, she first met future husband and business partner, Tarek El Moussa while the two were working as real estate agents at Prudential.[1][5][4]\n\nHall ran the real-estate agency Tarek and Christina: The El Moussa Group with her first husband Tarek in Orange County, California. The husband-and-wife team sold real estate in the southern California area.[6] When the housing market plummeted after the October 2008 stock market crash, their real estate business suffered. The El Moussas went from living in a $6,000-per-month house to a $700-per-month apartment in just a few years.[7]\n\nIn 2010,[8] the El Moussas, along with their business partner Pete De Best, bought their first investment property in Santa Ana, California for $115,000, selling the property for a profit of $34,000. The trio continued to flip houses, expanding their real-estate investing business into Arizona and Nevada.[9]\n\nThe El Moussa Group was dissolved in 2018. The business is now owned by Tarek and Associates, a sole venture of Tarek El Moussa.[10]\n\nIn 2011, Tarek El Moussa asked a friend to help him make an audition tape for HGTV. Pie Town Productions expressed interest in the tape. HGTV producers had also noticed the couple's Instagram profile, which featured before and after profiles of several renovation projects.[11]\n\nIn 2012, HGTV signed the couple to produce a show for the network.[12] In April 2013, Flip Or Flop debuted on the network. In a 2014 interview, Hall said, \"Each episode shows things that can go wrong, and do go wrong\".[13]\n\nIn June 2018, it was announced that Hall would be featured in her own spin-off show, Christina on the Coast.[14] The first episode of season 1 focused on Hall renovating her new post-divorce home, with the remaining seven episodes focusing on her renovating other people's homes.[15] Filming began in the fall 2018,[16] for a spring 2019 premiere.[17] The show's second season premiered on January 2, 2020, on HGTV.\n\nIn 2017, Hall presented at the Daytime Emmys.[18] On May 15, 2024, it was announced that Hall is set to star in a new competition reality series, The Flip Off for HGTV.[19] Hall appears in the series with husband Josh Hall, former husband Tarek El Moussa and his current wife Heather El Moussa.[19][20] The show follows the two couples in a competition to find, buy, renovate and flip a house for the biggest financial gain.[21] It is set to air in early 2025.[19]\n\nOn April 14, 2020, Hall released a nutrition book, The Wellness Remodel: A Guide to Rebooting How You Eat, Move, and Feed Your Soul, with certified nutritionist Cara Clark.[22] The book includes 60 healthy recipes.[22] In the book, Hall also discusses her health journey, including autoimmune disease diagnosis, struggles with infertility, and stress of going through a divorce while raising kids.[22]\n\nOn July 14, 2020, Hall announced she will be partnering with Spectra Furniture to create a furniture line for the brand. The new line, Christina HOME, debuted in October 2020.[23] In November 2021, Hall created a luxury vinyl flooring line, The Christina Collection, that features 21 different colors and styles.[24][25]\n\nList of product lines by Hall Year Title Brand Notes 2020 \"Christina Hall x The Lace Project\" The Lace Project Jewelry collection[26] 2020 \"Christina HOME\" Spectra Furniture Furniture line 2021 \"Christina Collection\" Vinyl flooring line\n\nDuring her career, Hall has been featured in numerous publications including Good Housekeeping, Elle Decor,[27] Runner's World[28] and the Orange County Register.[4] She has also appeared on the cover of HGTV magazine[29] and People.[30]\n\nIn October 2006, Hall began dating Tarek El Moussa, and the couple married in 2009.[4] Their daughter was born in 2010 and their son was born in 2015.[31] In 2013, Tarek was diagnosed with both thyroid and testicular cancer.[32] When doctors recommended radiation treatment, the couple decided to bank Tarek's sperm and try in-vitro fertilization to have a second child. The first attempt failed and Christina suffered a miscarriage on the second try. She became pregnant with their son in 2015.[33][2]\n\nIn May 2016, the couple separated after an incident at their Southern California home. Tarek was found by the police on a nearby hiking trail and was in possession of a handgun. He maintained he was never suicidal and had simply gone for a hike, taking a gun to protect himself from wild animals.[34] Tarek and Christina filed for divorce in 2017 and the divorce was finalized in January 2018.[35][36]\n\nIn November 2017, Hall began dating English television presenter Ant Anstead.[37] On December 22, 2018, she married Anstead at their Newport Beach, California home and officially changed her name to Christina Anstead.[38] She gave birth to their son, Hudson, on September 6, 2019.[39] They announced their separation on September 18, 2020, and she filed for divorce in November.[40] She also reverted to her maiden name of Christina Haack.[41] The divorce was finalized in June 2021.[42] On April 28, 2022, Anstead filed for full custody of Hudson, accusing Haack of exploiting their son on social media. A judge later ruled that the couple would continue \"to have joint legal and joint physical custody.\"[43][44]\n\nIn July 2021, People magazine announced that Haack was dating realtor Joshua Hall,[45][46] and the couple got engaged that September.[47][48] The couple had privately married in October 2021.[49] On April 5, 2022, media outlets reported that the couple married, and she changed her name to Christina Hall.[50] On September 3, 2022, the couple married a second time in Hawaii.[51] On July 8, 2024, the couple separated and subsequently filed for divorce.[52]\n\nIn December 2022, Hall said that she had undergone quantum biofeedback machine testing at an alternative medicine center,[53] and the results showed she had been diagnosed with \"mercury and lead poisoning\", which she believed was caused by remodeling and flipping \"gross\" houses. She also believed her illnesses might be attributed to breast implants. In addition, she said that she had been diagnosed with small intestinal bacterial overgrowth which she intended to treat with \"herbs\" and intravenous treatments.[54]\n\nAs herself Year Title Role Notes 2013–2022 Flip or Flop Co–host 146 episodes 2013–2014 Brother vs. Brother Judge 7 episodes 2015 Flip or Flop Follow-Up Host 3 episodes 2019 Buddy vs. Duff Special guest 2019–present Christina on the Coast Host 36 episodes; Also as executive producer 2021 Christina: Stronger by Design 4 episodes 2022 Christina in the Country Host 6 episodes; Also as executive producer 2023 Barbie Dreamhouse Challenge Contestant 3 episodes 2025 The Flip Off Upcoming series\n\nAnstead, Christina; Clark, Cara.
