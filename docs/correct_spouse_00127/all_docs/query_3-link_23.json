        "text": "If Christina Milian and Lil Wayne are dating, their union seems like a love quadrilateral gone terribly awkward, given their relationship pasts. And not everybody is feeling it.\n\nThe-Dream, Milan's ex-husband, definitely thinks the situation is strange. For starters, when Vlad TV asked him about the \"dynamic\" between him, ex-wife Nivea and Wayne, whom she has a child with, Dream replied, \"Super dynamic.\"\n\nHe also implied that Milian messed up the rotation by dating her ex-husband's ex-wife's child's father. \"I think that's what everybody was thinking when the news broke. Everybody was thinking of that but supposedly Christina,\" he said. \"She wasn't thinking of that at all. I have no idea how she could not be thinking of that.\"\n\nNivea posted a clip of Dream's comments on her Instagram account with the caption, \"Hmmm..drops mic. She's A #scarecrow!\" Nivea and Dream have three children together in addition to her son with Wayne. The Radio Killah married Milian a year or so after his divorce from Nivea.\n\nMilian, 32, has said that she and the 31-year-old rapper are only working on music together, despite posting subliminal messages that point to him being her new main squeeze. Among the many clues she's put out is a photo of two MCM bags with the hashtag #HisandHers.\n\nHer Instagram post caught the attention of Wayne's daughter, Reginae Carter, and she wasn't that impressed. Carter threw up a flick holding hands with her daddy writing, \"The real *His&Hers.* The Real Meaning of 'Mine.' His only 'Miss Carter.' Daddy's Little Girl.\"\n\nNevertheless, Milian isn't one to harp on the relationship hate. She shaved the initials \"TNT\" into the back of her head recently, which could stand for \"Tunechi and Tina,\" or \"Tina Turnup,\" the nickname Wayne gave her."
