        "text": "Christina Haack and Joshua Hall’s love story captivated fans before their surprising split in July 2024.\n\nFollowing her divorce from Ant Anstead, the Christina on the Coast star was spotted with a handsome stranger who Us Weekly subsequently confirmed was Hall. Soon after, Haack opened up about her new relationship in a lengthy Instagram post, noting she wanted to “protect” her new beau from all the hard parts of life in the spotlight.\n\n“I met Josh when I wasn’t in a state of fear or fight-or-flight. … The synchronicities hit us so hard and fast they were impossible to ignore,” she wrote in July 2021. “I felt immediately crazy protective over him and wanted to keep him for myself and get to know each other before the tornado (media attention) hit.”\n\nBefore her marriage to Anstead, Haack was married to her Flip or Flop costar Tarek El Moussa. The former costars share two children: daughter Taylor, born in 2010, and son Brayden, born in 2015. Haack also shares son Hudson, born in 2019, with Anstead.\n\n“I never thought I would have one divorce let alone two,” Haack wrote via Instagram in September 2020 to announce her second split. “I never thought I would have 2 baby daddies – but sometimes life throws us curve balls. Instead of getting stuck in these ‘setbacks’ I choose to look at these challenges as opportunities to grow. So while some may judge me and throw around rumors about me, most of you support me. And that says a lot about this world and where we are headed. I’m messy, I’m real and I’m working on healing. … We are all a work in progress.”\n\nIn July 2024, Us confirmed that Haack and Hall filed for divorce after two years of marriage.\n\nScroll to relive Haack and Hall’s relationship:"
