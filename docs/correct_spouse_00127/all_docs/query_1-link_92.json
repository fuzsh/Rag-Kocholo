I know that I just want to be able to experience each child, which is a gift. I definitely want to have another child in the future.\n\nI don’t know when it would be, but I kind of feel like because I know I want two, I know that whenever it happens, I’ll be ready! I’ll let God handle that!”\n\nThey recently tied the knot!\n\nAccording to reports, Pokora and Milian said \"I do\" just one day before their pregnancy announcement!
