The two have an infant daughter together.\n\nKessler said the divorce was resolved by mutual agreement.\n\nMilian is best known for songs such as “Dip it Low.” The-Dream, whose hits include “Shawty is a 10,” has produced for artists including Mariah Carey, Rihanna and Britney Spears; he won two Grammys for his work on Beyonce’s “Single Ladies (Put A Ring on It).”"
