Hall was a dwindling real estate investor before HGTV made Hall and her first husband the stars that they are today. Hall has since been a staple in the television channel, hosting the channel's Flip or Flop with her first husband, and starring in their own spin-off, Christina on the Coast.\n\nBorn Christina Meursinge Haack on July 9, 1983, in Anaheim, California, she is also a much looked-up to television stars on the internet. Hall's enviable lifestyle as a working woman, doting wife, and mom is an open book on her socials, garnering her the image of a lifestyle guru.\n\nChristina Hall's Conjugal Life with Her Third Husband, Joshua Hall!\n\nChristina changed her surname two times before adopting her current one. The HGTV star is still in her honeymoon phase with Joshua Hall, who she married in April 2022. Christina's love life has been constantly scrutinized since the beginning of her celebrity life and it is no different this time.\n\nDespite being a newly married couple, Christina and her third husband have cemented a pretty solid image, albeit some hate and trolls have been coming at the couple since day one. Many reproached the real estate investor for moving on from her second divorce too quickly.\n\n\"I normally turn off comments with Josh and will continue to do so if people are rude,\" Hall said while sharing how she deals with the negativity.

And while she was at it, Christina also let out the story of how she met him and fell for him. \"I met Josh when I wasn't in a state of fear or fight-or-flight,\" the television star as she went official with him.\n\n\"The synchronicities hit us so hard and fast they were impossible to ignore,\" Christina added. Over the next few months, Christina introduced Joshua to her kids and blended her family with Hall's. Amid the finalization of her second divorce in June, she and Josh celebrated the milestone with their dream vacation in Mexico.\n\nAlthough it is still too early to call Christina's third marriage a charm, the Flip or Flop star certainly believes that she has gotten it right this time. \"Some people are lucky enough to get forever the first time but no one should be shamed for things not working out,\" Christina wrote while calling Josh her \"ride or die\" and \"the one.\"\n\nAfter a whirlwind romance, the love birds announced their engagement in September 2021 and tied the knot on April 5, 2022. The duo's secret nuptial came to light after Christina, who was using her maiden name, Haack, changed her surname to Hall.\n\nThe Hall couple has their own reality show, 'Christina in the Country!\n\nThe spouses have since taken big steps as partners, be it by relocating to Newport, or starting a production company together. The blissful couple hosted a second wedding in September 2022 in Hawaii. The duo's latest joint venture is their show, Christina in the Country, which follows the Hall family navigating a serene family life in the countryside.\n\nThe Complete Truth About Christina Hall's Two Failed Marriages!\n\nChristina rose to fame with her first husband, Tarek El Moussa. The duo's personal and conjoint professional life was played out on HGTV shows for years. The reality series, Flip or Flop, first introduced the couple to its viewers. Christina and Tarek had a daughter, Taylor, at the onset of the show, and in 2015, they welcomed their son, Brayden.\n\nChristina and Tarek met with many adversities in the next few years, including Moussa's cancer diagnosis in 2013, and publicly fought through them. The duo announced their separation after seven years of marriage in 2016. The estranged couple's divorce was finalized in 2018 but they continued their professional ties, starring in the show.\n\nChristina and Moussa have since been outspoken about their post-divorce journey and also showed support for each other's new ventures. Moussa went on to marry his second wife, former Playboy model Heather Rae Young in 2012. When Christina married her second husband, English presenter Ant Anstead in 2018, Moussa gave his ex-wife a shoutout and accidentally revealed her kid's sex.\n\n\"Things are good today. She's remarried, she's actually pregnant â everybody knows that,\" the television presenter said. Moussa added, \"She's having a son. My kids are super excited. I'm excited for her new chapter in life.\"\n\nChristina and Anstead's marriage fell apart in September 2020, a year after her third kid, Hudson's birth in September 2019. The pair's nuptial ended on a bad note and Anstead even tried gaining the full custody of their son while calling Christina a bad mother.
