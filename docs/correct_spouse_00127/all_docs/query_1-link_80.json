        "text": "CHRISTINA Trevanion is best known from presenting TV shows about antiques, but behind the scenes she’s also a married mother-of-two.\n\nHere’s everything we know about her husband Aaron Dean and their children.\n\nWho is Christina Trevanion's husband Aaron Dean?\n\nChristina Trevanion keeps her personal life private, so very little is known about her husband.\n\nWe know the 43-year-old met her husband Aaron Dean while he was studying Fine Arts Valuation at Southampton Solent University.\n\nAfter graduating in 2002, Aaron spent a decade working as an auctioneer at Gorringe’s antique auctions in Lewes, Sussex.\n\nAaron made the move to television in 2013, as a valuer and researcher on BBC show Flog It!\n\nIn 2014, Christina and Aaron set up Trevanion & Dean, an auction house in Shropshire.\n\nChristina took on sole ownership of the joint venture in 2019 after Aaron left after five years, joining Adam Partridge Auctioneers in 2021.\n\nAt the time of his departure, Aaron said: “I am delighted that Christina is now taking over the business.\n\n“I’m excited to see it thrive under her leadership.\n\n“I’ve had a fantastic four years at Trevanion and Dean, full of laughter and fun, and it's time for me to move on”, he explained.\n\nThe business is now known as Trevanion Auctioneers and Valuers and is located in Whitchurch, near the Cheshire border.\n\nSince June 2023, Aaron has held a position at the Manchester Art Gallery.\n\nDespite keeping family life private, the Bargain Hunt presenter did give an insight into her family life this month just before Christmas in 2021, when she joked about divorce on X/Twitter.\n\nChristina tweeted: \"Has anyone ever cited 'putting up Christmas lights' on divorce papers? Asking for a friend/current husband.\"\n\nWhen did Christina Trevanion and her husband Aaron Dean marry?\n\nAccording to Christina's X/Twitter account, the pair tied the knot on New Year’s Eve in 2010.\n\nChristina wore a wedding dress by Jenny Packham, the designer loved by Princess Kate.\n\nShe was walked down the aisle by her father, David, who sadly died in 2013.\n\nThere is little else known about the wedding, as although Christina is on Instagram, her account is mostly dedicated to her professional work.\n\nHow many children do Christina Trevanion and Aaron Dean have?\n\nChristina and her husband share two daughters together.\n\nShe rarely shares any information on her family so it isn't known what the children are called or how old they are.\n\nBut Christina did reveal that she was keeping her young children well away from her antiques.\n\nSpeaking to Antique Collecting back in 2016, Christina was discussing her favourite pieces at home, explaining that she has \"an eclectic mix\" of antiques that she’s accumulated over the years.\n\nShe explained, \"[I have] an eclectic mix of inherited family pieces and treasured saleroom purchases, I have two small children and so my 18th-century teapot collection was packed away until they get a little older!\""
