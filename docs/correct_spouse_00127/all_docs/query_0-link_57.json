Pokora last year, but how many kids do they have together - and who is the father of Milian’s first child?\n\nHow many kids does Christina Milian have?\n\nChristina Milian has three kids.\n\nViolet\n\nChristina welcomed her first child into the world on February 26 2010 - a girl named Violet.\n\nViolet, whose full name is Violet Madison Nash, is the daughter of Milian and her ex-husband, rapper The-Dream.\n\nViolet is now 11 years old.\n\nAlthough she was Milian’s first child, The-Dream already had three kids with his ex-wife Nivea when Violet was born.\n\nToday, the rapper has 9 kids in total.\n\nIsaiah Pokora\n\nSeven years after the birth of her first child, Milian announced she was expecting again - this time with her now-husband, french singer Matt Pokora.\n\nOn January 20, 2020 their son Isaiah Pokora was born, making him just 1 year old today.\n\nKenna Tota\n\nKenna Tota is the newest addition to the Milian family - and he’s the singer’s second child with husband Matt Pokora.\n\nMilian’s second son, Kenna, arrived on April 23, 2021 - meaning he’s still just three months old!\n\nWho is Christina Milian’s husband Matt Pokora?\n\nChristina and Matt got together in August 2017, and married just over three years later in December 2020 - but not before welcoming their first son, Isaiah earlier that year.\n\nMatt is a french singer and songwriter, working under the stage name M. Pokora or Matt Pokora who currently acts as a coach on The Voice Kids France.\n\nBefore that, he was a member of French R&B group Mic Unity.\n\nHis real name is Matthieu Tota.\n\nHis father was professional footballer Andre Tota, and Matt revealed he had originally hoped to follow in his Dad’s footsteps before discovering a love of music.\n\nWho is Christina Milian’s ex-husband The-Dream?\n\nBefore meeting Matt, Christina was married to rapper The-Dream, who she shares daughter Violet with.\n\nThe two started dating in February 2009 and eloped in a Vegas chapel just over six months later.\n\nBut it wasn’t destined to be happily ever after - they separated three months later, before the birth of their daughter.\n\nTheir divorce was finalised in October 2011.\n\nChristina also dated comedian Nick Cannon and rapper Lil Wayne before settling down with husband Matthew."
