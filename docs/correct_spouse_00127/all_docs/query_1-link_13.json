        "text": "Christina Milian and Matt Pokora met at a restaurant in France in 2017. That first night he told her, \"We're going to have a child together.\" When she said she already had a daughter, he said, \"Well, you don't have a son.\"\n\nCut to July 2019, when the pair reveal on Instagram that they are expecting a child together. The following month they announced they were expecting a little boy.\n\nA prominent figure in the global music scene, Matt Pokora initially gained fame as a member of the French R&B group, Linkup. However, his solo career truly skyrocketed with chart-topping hits such as \"It's Alright\" and appearances on various talent shows as a coach or judge. Apart from Christina Milian, he has kept his romantic life relatively private, focusing on his ever-growing musical repertoire and fanbase.\n\nRumors started swirling about a relationship between Christina Milian and rapper Dave East after they both posted photos together at a strip club.\n\nDuring an appearance on The Breakfast Club in 2017, Dave East admitted the two had hung out, but said he was not interested in the paparazzi attention that comes with dating someone like Milian. So as soon as blogs started writing about their pairing, he was quick to send out a tweet to shut it down, essentially ending the relationship before it really had a chance to begin.\n\nDave East is a talented rapper hailing from Harlem, New York, who rose to prominence with his critically acclaimed mixtapes, Black Rose and Hate Me Now. He has since collaborated with big names in the hip-hop world such as Nas and Chris Brown, solidifying his place in the music industry. Known for his deep, storytelling lyrics, Dave East has managed to keep his personal life mostly under wraps, with his rumored romance with Christina Milian being one of the few instances where his love life made headlines.\n\nChristina Milian sparked dating rumors with NFL player Brandon Wilds in February 2017 after they were spotted getting cozy on a beach in California. Their seaside rendezvous featured hand-holding, playful banter, and intimate exchanges, signaling the possibility of a blossoming romance. Sadly, their relationship never took off, and the two eventually went their separate ways without public acknowledgment of their fleeting tryst.\n\nBrandon Wilds initially gained notoriety as a running back for the University of South Carolina before being signed by the New York Jets in 2016. While his football career hasn't quite reached the heights of his initial expectations, he remains an active athlete exploring opportunities within the sport. Apart from his brief rumored dalliance with Christina Milian, Wilds' romantic life has maintained a low profile, much like his steadily progressing career.\n\nChristina Milian and model Izzy Lopez were romantically linked in early 2015. The pair appeared to have a steamy connection, which was evident in a series of flirtatious Snapchat posts. Though it appeared the two were enjoying each other's company, their romance was short-lived, and they ultimately parted ways without much fanfare.\n\nIzzy Lopez is a striking model who rose to fame with appearances in various music videos and magazines. Known for his chiseled features and alluring presence, Lopez has captured the attention of many within the entertainment industry, including Christina Milian. Despite this brief romantic encounter, Izzy Lopez continues to focus on his thriving modeling career and has remained mostly tight-lipped about his personal life.\n\nOne of Christina Milian's most high-profile relationships was with rapper Lil Wayne, which began in July 2014 after they had collaborated on her single, \"Start a Fire.\" The couple frequently gushed about each other in interviews, publicly displaying their affection and support for one another. After dating for about a year, the couple ultimately ended their relationship in 2015 due to their demanding work schedules. They have since expressed their mutual love and respect for each other and remain friends.\n\nLil Wayne is undoubtedly one of the biggest names in the rap world, with a career spanning decades and a multitude of chart-topping hits such as \"Lollipop\" and \"6 Foot 7 Foot.\" He has been romantically linked to several high-profile women, including singer Nivea and actress Lauren London. Lil Wayne's storied love life is almost as impressive as his prolific music career, making him no stranger to the spotlight.\n\nChristina Milian briefly dated NFL player Shawn Costner in 2013 after they were introduced through mutual friends. Despite sharing a passion for sports and the entertainment world, the couple's relationship never fully blossomed. They eventually drifted apart but remained friendly, as evidenced by the occasional social media interaction.\n\nShawn Costner is a former NFL player who has played for both the Carolina Panthers and the Denver Broncos. While his professional football career may not have reached great heights, Costner's brief relationship with Christina Milian thrust him into the limelight. Costner has since retired from the sport and primarily focuses on his family life, keeping his romantic endeavors away from the public eye."
