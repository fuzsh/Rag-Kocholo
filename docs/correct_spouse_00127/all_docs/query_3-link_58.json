The long dry spells, the time spent in relationships going nowhere, and the endless weddings and holiday parties you have to go to alone. I know how confusing and painful it feels. And how that tiny voice inside of you whispers: \"What's wrong with me?\"\n\nActually, everything is right with you.\n\nAnd the more you connect with the part of you that feels radiant, whole, and worthy of a healthy partnership rooted in mutual love and devotion, the closer you get to it.\n\nI know because I walked this path myself, and my soulmate and sacred partner, Darrin, was waiting for me on the other end. Four years later, we are blissfully married and recently welcomed our spunky baby girl named Ruby into our lives.\n\nOpening to Sacred Love\n\nOnline Program\n\nJoin this life-changing journey, which guides you through 7 modules that offer a powerful combination of inner prep for live and outer steps toward love. That’s what it takes to welcome in the conscious partnership you’re longing for.\n\nYou’ll discover that your journey to love can be just as fun and exhilarating as your destination."
