        "text": "Lil Wayne and Christina Milian – in a love rectangle? According to The-Dream, that is exactly what is happening!\n\nWhen asked about the rumors and speculation that have recently been circulating Lil Wayne and Christina Milian, Grammy award winner The-Dream stated that a relationship between the two of them would be very hard to believe. He then went on to explain to Vlad TV that a relationship between Lil Wayne and Christina Milian would put them all inside of a love rectangle – instead of a love triangle.\n\nHow is that?\n\nKeep in mind that The-Dream and Christina Milian used to be married before a cheating scandal led to Christina filing for divorce from him. Therefore you should clearly be able to see how a love triangle would be formed there. However, long before The-Dream and Christina Milian were married, The-Dream was a husband and father of three kids that he shared with R&B singer, Nivea. Lil Wayne also has had a relationship in the past with Nivea, which led to her giving birth to a child with the Young Money rapper as well.\n\nTherefore, if the rumors about the relationship between Lil Wayne and Christina Milian are true, that means that Christina Milian is dating the man who has a child with the first wife of her ex-husband.\n\nAccording to SOHH, The-Dream feels like Christina Milian is clearly not thinking this all through if that is the direction in which she is heading in her “friendship” with Lil Wayne – especially when you take into consideration the love rectangle it creates:\n\nI think that’s what everybody was thinking when the news broke. Everybody was thinking of that but supposedly Christina. She wasn’t thinking of that at all. I have no idea how she could not be thinking of that.\n\nHow does Nivea feel about all of this? Well, the footage from the interview with VLAD TV in which The-Dream made the above statement was recently posted on her official Instagram profile along with the caption: “Hmmmm.. drops mic.. #She’sAScareCrow.”\n\nWhen asked about the rumors earlier this year, according to VIBE Magazine, Lil Wayne simply cracked jokes about dating Jennifer Lopez instead:\n\nI’m dating J.Lo, you ain’t heard? We’re going steady!\n\nOn the other hand, Christina Milian took a very different approach to the questions and allegations. When asked about the relationship by TMZ, Christina simply stated that she and Lil Wayne “make music together” for his highly-anticipated upcoming album, Tha Carter V.\n\nUnfortunately your browser does not support IFrames.\n\nChristina Milian — I’m NOT Banging Lil Wayne\n\nHowever, the pictures that have been circulating through the press and media of Lil Wayne and Christina Milian together show that they might be making a little more than just “music” with one another.\n\nWhat do you think? Are Lil Wayne and Christina Milian truly in a love rectangle with The-Dream and Nivea? Is Christina simply trying to use Lil Wayne to try and get the spotlight back on her own music career?"
