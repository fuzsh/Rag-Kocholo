        "text": "The HGTV star was famously married to her 'Flip or Flop' costar Tarek El Moussa before she wed TV host Ant Anstead. Her most recent husband Josh Hall filed for divorce in July 2024\n\nChristina Hall's breakup with Josh Hall marks her third high-profile split since the HGTV star stepped into the spotlight in 2013.\n\nThe Flip or Flop alum and the realtor were married for nearly three years before Josh filed for divorce due to \"irreconcilable differences,\" according to a filing obtained by PEOPLE.\n\nPrior to her relationship with Josh, Christina was famously married to her husband Tarek El Moussa — whom she costarred with on Flip or Flop — from 2009 to 2016. The pair shot to stardom after their HGTV show premiered in 2013, which made their sudden split all the more shocking to fans who had watched the couple build their careers and family — they share a daughter and a son — on TV for years.\n\nAfter her divorce from Tarek was finalized in January 2018, Christina then wed Wheeler Dealers co-host Ant Anstead that December. The duo were married for two years — during which they welcomed a son together — before they split up in November 2020.\n\nThe following July, PEOPLE confirmed that Christina had a new love interest in her life; two months later, the HGTV star revealed her engagement to Josh, a former police officer turned realtor. After they secretly tied the knot in 2021, Christina and Josh held another wedding ceremony for their close friends and family in Hawaii in September 2022.\n\nLess than three years later, however, the pair are calling it quits, marking Christina’s third divorce in less than 10 years.\n\nHere’s a closer look at Christina Hall's marriages with Tarek El Moussa, Ant Anstead and Josh Hall.\n\nTarek El Moussa: April 2009 - Dec. 2016\n\nTarek and Christina first crossed paths in 2005 while working as real estate agents at Prudential in California. Their relationship quickly evolved from colleagues to partners, and by October 2006, they were living together, Christina told Good Housekeeping in August 2017.\n\nThe couple married in April 2009, and welcomed their first child, daughter Taylor Reese, the following fall in September 2010. Christina and Tarek expanded their family a few years later and celebrated the arrival of their son, Brayden James, in August 2015.\n\nTheir shared passion for real estate led them to pitch a house-flipping show, which became HGTV's hit series Flip or Flop in 2013. The show, which blended Christina and Tarek’s passion for real estate with an intimate glimpse into their personal lives, went on for a total of 10 seasons.\n\nDespite their professional success, their personal life faced significant challenges. In May 2016, an altercation involving a gun at their home led to police intervention, though Tarek later clarified it was a misunderstanding.\n\nThe incident marked a turning point, and they announced their separation later that year, with Tarek filing for divorce in January 2017. After finalizing their divorce in January 2018, they continued to co-parent their children and work together on Flip or Flop until the show's end in 2022.\n\nIn May 2024, Christina and Tarek announced they were set to star in a new show, The Flip Off, alongside Christina's husband Josh and Tarek's current wife, Selling Sunset alum Heather Rae El Moussa. The HGTV series will feature both pairs as they compete against each other flipping homes. The show is set to premiere in 2025, though it's unclear how Josh and Christina's split will impact it.\n\nRelated: Christina Hall's 3 Kids: All About Taylor, Brayden and Hudson\n\nAnt Anstead: Dec. 2018 - Sept. 2020\n\nChristina began dating British TV host Ant Anstead in November 2017, and their relationship became public in January 2018. The pair tied the knot in a surprise winter wonderland-themed wedding at their Newport Beach home in December 2018.\n\nAnt and Christina welcomed their son, Hudson London, in September 2019. However, the bliss was short-lived, and by September 2020, Christina announced their separation after less than two years of marriage. Their divorce was finalized in June 2021, with both sharing joint custody of Hudson.\n\n\"Ant and I have made the difficult decision to separate. We are grateful for each other and as always, our children will remain our priority,\" Christina wrote in September 2020 on Instagram.\n\nIn the wake of their split, Ant told PEOPLE in June 2021 that the divorce ultimately gave him a newfound perspective.\n\n\"When my divorce went through, I packed up my clothes and moved. I walked away completely and left everything [at our family home],\" the TV host said at the time. \"I've realized how little I need, and what's important. I don't need anything but Hudson and my health.”\n\nFollowing his divorce from Christina, the British TV persona has been dating actress Renée Zellweger since June 2021.\n\nJosh Hall: Oct. 2021 - July 2024\n\nFollowing her split from Ant, Christina began dating Austin-based realtor Josh in July 2021, with sources saying at the time that the two had an “immediate, real connection,” adding that they’ve “enjoyed getting to know each other one-on-one without outside noise.\"\n\nTheir relationship quickly progressed, with Christina confirming their engagement in September 2021. They secretly married in 2021 before later celebrating with an intimate oceanfront ceremony in Hawaii in 2022.\n\nChristina and Josh often shared glimpses of their life together on social media and Josh made several appearances on Christina’s HGTV spinoff Christina in the Country during its first season in 2023.\n\nHowever, the two called it quits after less than three years of marriage. According to legal documents obtained by PEOPLE, Josh is requesting spousal support from Christina.\n\nFor more People news, make sure to sign up for our newsletter!"
