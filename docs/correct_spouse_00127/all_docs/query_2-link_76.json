        "text": "Christina Haack and her husband are the epitome of the saying, \"Teamwork makes the dream work.\" The Flip or Flop co-host tied the knot with realtor Joshua Hall in April 2022 and followed it up with an Insta-worthy wedding that fall in Hawaii.\n\nSince saying, \"I do,\" the two have been inseparable, especially when it comes to sharing screen time. Josh has been Christina's co-star as she flips, renovates, and decorates. Most recently, the couple embarked on their newest journey together as the television star began filming for season 4 of Christina on the Coast and new spin-off Christina in the Country.\n\nAs they wrapped up filming for the inaugural season in Tennessee, Josh took it upon himself to write the sweetest message reflecting on his shared career with Christina.\n\nHe began by writing, \"Another work trip in the beautiful state of Tennessee down. Being able to travel back and forth with my best friend working as a team and with an amazing crew of people spending time with family is second to none\" and ended by gushing that he and Christina have \"so much more in the works than I can explain just yet, but with our two brains working as one, we will never stop.\"\n\nThe two were all smiles as they channeled their inner cowboys while riding horses on the set of Christina in the Country. Josh went on to include photos of the show's crew, off-roading adventures, never-before-seen looks at the show's upcoming season, and an adorable family photo that included Christina's children...and possibly the fluffiest chicken we've ever seen.\n\nFlip or Flop fans immediately flocked to Josh's comment section in response to his message and said:\n\n\"Christina is living her BEST life and I‚Äôm here for it. I‚Äôve been watching her since S1 of FoF and she has never looked happier, more at peace or beautiful than now.\n\nKeep doing whatever is it that you‚Äôre doing Josh üòÇ‚ù§Ô∏è\"\n\n\"Josh, I love that you're so genuine and sincere. Congrats on finding each other. For you and Christina, there's nowhere to go but up!\"\n\n\" Can‚Äôt wait for what‚Äôs to come! Love you guys ‚ù§Ô∏è\"\n\nEven Christina took the time to write, \"Teamwork baby ‚ù§Ô∏è\" under her new hubby's post."
