A rep for The-Dream confirmed the news saying that \"Terius 'The-Dream' Nash is saddened to announce that his marriage to Christina Milian was unsuccessful. The couple reached this decision in late 2009, but decided to keep the news private in efforts to protect their baby daughter Violet. They ask for consideration and respect for their family moving forward.\"\n\nhttp://www.rapbasement.com/rap/071210-the-dream-splits-from-singer-christina-millian-spotted-with-another-woman-details-here.html\n\n___________________________________________________________________________________________________________________\n\nI always knew it was going to end soon, when she wakes up from the Dream and finds that ugly ass guy next to her in the bed, lol. He should be called \"the nightmare\" lol.\n\nI'm very biased on this becuz I've loved Christina Milian since 2001ish and I've disliked The-Dream since he first got popular (minus a few songs he's produced). All I know is this, Christina Milian is a 10...and The-Dream was just luckily. As fans, u can never know what goes on behind closed doors and famous people REALLY are but they never seemed like a legit couple. I love Christina's music and a handful of her movies...but her career isn't blazing hot at the moment. Maybe she needs 2 date non-industry guys...like me. :laugh:\n\nChristina, if you are reading this...message me.\n\nI just got this from AOL News' Boombox....I've never liked The-Dream...right now I think he's also one of the stupidest people ever. I mean, WHO CHEATS ON CHRISTINA MILIAN?!?! You can't cheat up from that. Which means he's an idiot who cheated down. This is how I felt when Eric Benet cheated on Halle Barry....except I like his music.\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nChristina Milian Says The-Dream Cheated During Their Marriage\n\nAs the story of The-Dream and Christina Milian's marital woes unfolds, the allegations against The-Dream continue to mount up.\n\nMilian claims that when the \"Radio Killa\" singer/producer publicly announced the end of their relationship recently, she was taken aback by the news since it was the first time she was hearing of it.\n\nDream allegedly filed for divorce back in February, when his wife was just nine days away from giving birth to their daughter, Violet. He stated the divorce was on the grounds that their relationship was \"irretrievably broken,\" but according to Milian, their relationship seemed back on, and they even had \"marital relations on numerous occasions.\"\n\nMilian claims that, while she was pregnant, The-Dream had her sign an agreement waiving any alimony or rights to his earnings. The 'Dip It Low' singer claims her judgment was clouded, due to being at the full term of her pregnancy.\n\nFinally, Milian says The-Dream cheated on her during their marriage, and conceded that, should the court grant the divorce, she would like it to be due to her husband's infidelity."
