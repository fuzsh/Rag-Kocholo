        "text": "According to TMZ, Christina Milian filed legal papers last week stating that when The Dream filed for divorce, the marriage wasn’t over as they had “Marital relations on several occasions”. In the document, Christina Milian admitted to signing a divorce settlement waiving her rights to alimony and ownership rights to each other’s properties, however she claims she only signed the docs because The Dream brought them to her bedside when she was 9 months pregnant. She was in no condition to comprehend exactly what she was signing.\n\nSo in a nutshell, she’s not entitled to alimony from the marriage! The Dream made sure to protect his assets, meanwhile she left the relationship with extra baggage and a baby. (who I hope doesn’t google this stuff when she gets older)\n\nSee, this is what happens when you only date a few months before getting married. Everything happened between these two way too fast. People should start taking vows a bit more serious!\n\nIt’s no doubt in my mind that The Dream did her dirty but my only question is; pregnant or not, who in the world would sign divorce papers without calling up an attorney? Something in the milk ain’t clean and I doubt this is the last we will be hearing of this story..\n\nVia: Necole Bitchie"
