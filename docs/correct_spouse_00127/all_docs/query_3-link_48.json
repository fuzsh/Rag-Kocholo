        "text": "Christina Hall is back for a new Christina on the Coast season, and HGTV has set the premiere date for Season 5. The interior designer returns on Thursday, July 11, at 9 p.m. ET/PT.\n\nHall and her team, which includes designer and project manager James Bender, return to transform outdated properties into dream homes by incorporating functionality and modern amenities, such as open floorplans, custom storage solutions, coveted indoor-outdoor living areas and spacious primary bedrooms featuring spa-inspired bathrooms.\n\nThe 11-episode season will also feature Hall’s husband, Josh Hall, as the busy mom of three, author, and entrepreneur celebrates milestone birthdays, her 40th and daughter Taylor’s 13th, and enjoys one-on-one time with son Brayden, completing finishing touches for a final reveal.\n\nChristina on the Coast’s season premiere, features Hall navigating her most challenging—and personal—client and project yet when she renovates her childhood home for her parents, Paul and Laurie. Multiple spaces will get much-needed upgrades, all while keeping the same footprint and existing hardwood floors that her parents cherish. Hall’s design expertise will help guide them on all the big decisions, including kitchen cabinets and counters, a unique marble backsplash for the reimagined built-in bar, and bold patterned wallpaper and hexagon tile for the powder bathroom.\n\nChristina on the Coast is produced by Glass Entertainment Group and Unbroken Productions."
