        "text": "Beauty and brains won’t save you from a cheating spouse. That’s one lesson singer Christina Milian learned from her 10-month long marriage to producer, Terius “The Dream” Nash.\n\nThe singer got up close and personal on actress Niecy Nash’s new Yahoo web series, “Let’s Talk About Love.”\n\n“Beautiful has nothing to do with [getting cheated on],” she says. “Know I’m a really good wife, I’m a really good girlfriend,” she adds. “I know we’re all supposed to take blame for certain things, but I have to say I’m pretty good at all those things.”\n\nPHOTOS: Celeb Moms: Christina Milian\n\nMilian divorced “The Dream” in late 2010 after he was caught frolicking on the beach with his assistant — just months after she gave birth to their daughter Violet. Milian eventually received a $4M divorce settlement.\n\nPHOTOS: Christina Milian’s Makeup Evolution\n\nNow happily single, and splitting custody of Violet, Milian admits the biggest lesson she’s learned is not to get overtaken by love. “Sometimes we get so carried away with love. We might even mistake somethings like lust.”\n\nAs soon as her divorce was finalized Milian was quoted saying “I feel brand new. I’m stronger for it and now I’m ready for the next phase of my life.”"
