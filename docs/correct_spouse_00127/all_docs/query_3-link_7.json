        "text": "Christina on the Coast star Christina Hall and husband Josh Hall are calling it quits after two years of marriage.\n\nAccording toPeople, Josh was the one to file for divorce due to \"irreconcilable differences.\" Christina has also reportedly filed.\n\nJosh is asking for spousal support from Christina. Legally, spousal support means that the spouse who earns much less than the other spouse will receive financial assistance after the split.\n\nNeither Christina nor Josh have spoken publicly on their family drama, though the reality star has pulled video from their wedding day from her Instagram page. The two were married in a private ceremony in 2022 after one year of dating. They do not have any children together, though Christina has three from previous relationships.\n\nThe couple originally started dating on the heels of her divorce from Ant Anstead in 2020. Anstead and Hall had been married less than two years, sharing son Hudson together. Anstead and Hall met in 2017 after being introduced through mutual friends.\n\n“Ant and I have made the difficult decision to separate,” Hall wrote at the time of that news breaking. \"We are grateful for each other and as always, our children will remain our priority. We appreciate your support and ask for privacy for us and our family as we navigate the future.\"\n\nIn addition to son Hudson, Christina also has two children with ex-husband Tarek El Moussa, daughter Taylor, 13, and son Brayden, 8. In 2024 the former couple compete against one another on an HGTV series called the Flip Off. They created the popular Flip or Flop series that first aired in 2013."
