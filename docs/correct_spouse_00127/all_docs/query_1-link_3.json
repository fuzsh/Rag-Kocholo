        "text": "Over the weekend, actress and singer Christina Milian and her French popstar beau Matt Pokora, announced that they are expecting their first child together. People, from famous friends and everyday folk, sent their well-wishes and good vibes to the 37-year-old and her partner, but no one went to greater lengths to send their love than Milian’s ex-husband, Terius “The-Dream” Nash.\n\nSurprisingly, the 41-year-old singer, songwriter and producer wrote a note on Instagram to Milian and Pokora, but addressed Milian specifically, celebrating the love that she’s found and saying that the love will be be put into the life of their unborn child.\n\n“I’m Delighted to wait the arrival and Welcome the Beautiful Being that’s on the way for @christinamilian and @mattpokora,” he wrote. “What most may not know is I’ve asked for this moment to be Realized more than I can count. I have also made my best efforts at making sure whoever was in your life loved You and Adored You! I’ve Said if it’s Love do not hide it in the Dark let it inspire us in the light. I am so happy for You Tina most of all. Beyond this Business there is a common love that sometimes get left behind. A child itself can not Will that love but two people who love each other can will that love into a child. I told you recently and asked what are you waiting for. ð­ I’m glad the wait is over! This time around Make sure no one comes in between your happiness and will to love and be loved! Love who you want and how you want! @mattpokora I believe in you based off of our convo she has the Right human being to stand beside. Sending You much Love and Joy! You both should be Elated and do not dismiss a moment of this journey it goes by at light speed it seems! âð½from @Thekingdream and @MrsNashxo we send you Infinite Love\n\nhttps://www.instagram.com/p/B0fcILHHUK4/\n\nNow, you can look at this note in one of two ways: as a harmless message from a former spouse-turned-co-parent-turned-friend simply sending positive energy to the mother of his daughter, or as an ex who wasn’t a good husband clearing his conscious now that his ex-wife is about to start a family with someone she loves. Whatever you make of it, The-Dream wasn’t all that concerned because he still put this out in the universe. For the record, Milian nor Pokora have publicly commented on his heartfelt post.\n\nChristina Milian and The-Dream were married from 2009 to 2011 and share daughter Violent Madison Nash, 9. Their marriage ended after she accused him of cheating on her a few days before she delivered Violet, and photos of the producer on the beach hugging on a woman who wasn’t Milian definitely seemed to confirm that. Still, he was the one who filed for divorce. These days, he’s remarried to Lalonne Martinez, whom he shares four children with. Milian has been with Pokora since 2017.\n\nInitially, The-Dream and Milian weren’t co-parenting well because she said he wasn’t present for Violet, but over the years, the star said she’d become good friends with her ex and his wife."
