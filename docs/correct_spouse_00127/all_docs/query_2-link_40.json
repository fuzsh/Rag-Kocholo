        "text": "Christina is a contestant on the new HGTV show, 'Barbie Dreamhouse Challenge,' which premieres on July 16\n\nChristina and Josh Hall were living the dream at the Barbie movie premiere on Sunday.\n\nThe couple stepped out on the pink carpet for a date night and celebration of Christina’s 40th birthday. The Christina on the Coast star is on HGTV’s upcoming Barbie Dreamhouse Challenge, a competition series where eight teams transform a mansion into an oasis fit for Barbie. Christina tells PEOPLE exclusively that she thinks she and teammate James Bender are going to win.\n\n“We got the dream closet, so I think we got the best room in the house, literally,” Christina, 40, says. “So you'll see, it's incredible. It's gorgeous — very glam.”\n\n“There's no one on earth I'd rather work with than her,” Bender says, adding, \"We share our brain, so we usually say the same thing at the same time,\" which helped them agree on most things throughout the process.\n\nRelated: See the Trailer for HGTV’s ‘Barbie Dreamhouse Challenge’ — Plus, Meet the Celebrity Judges (Exclusive)\n\nAs she aims to find a larger sense of calm in her life, Christina is entering her fifth season of Christina on the Coast, which she and her realtor husband, executive produce together. She also teased the return of another series that aired its first season in February.\n\nRelated: Christina Hall&#39;s Husband Josh Bought Her ‘Dream Car,’ a $240K Bentley, for Her Birthday: ’Not Bad’ (Exclusive)\n\n“It's fun getting to really be involved in the production side, and I so enjoy doing that show so much,” she admits. “So I'm grateful to be on the fifth season and hopefully starting Christina in the Country again soon.”\n\nAt the same time, she confesses that it is “way more work than I thought” to be in front of the camera and part of the production team simultaneously. Still, she says, “I like a challenge.”\n\n“Never focus on the negative, it’s all good,” Christina tells PEOPLE. “Everything’s going to be amazing.”\n\nJust before attending the premiere, Josh gifted Christina a $240,000 white Bentley convertible. \"Oh, just my dream car complete with a big red bow. Not bad, not bad,\" she told PEOPLE after being asked if she received any big presents on her special day.\n\nChristina showed off her sleek new ride — which appears to be a Continental GTC model — in a post on her Instagram Story. The car is parked top-down and decorated with the aforementioned red bow in the image. “Thank you @unbrokenjosh for the best surprise ever,” she wrote.\n\nJosh, 42, also paid tribute to Christina with a touching Instagram post on Sunday, calling her an “absolute stunner of a wife” as she celebrated her milestone birthday.\n\n“This woman has accomplished so much, inspired so many and continues to impress me daily,” the real estate agent turned TV producer wrote, alongside a photo of the couple. “I can’t say enough about what an absolute force she is and what she is capable of. Christina is about to make her 40s the best decade of her life and looking better than ever while doing it!\"\n\nHe added, \"I’m a lucky man and thank my lucky stars that she chose me to take this ride with her that is now our life. Ride or die, baby, love you more than anything.\"\n\nAs for entering a new decade, Christina says she hopes to leave her fast-paced life in her 30s.\n\n“I wanna just kind of like settle,” she says. “I feel like 30s are the hustle and the whirlwind and I feel like 40s, I just wanna take my time and just like, enjoy the moments.”\n\nRelated: Christina Hall’s Husband Josh Shows Off His Tattoos During Fourth of July Boat Day\n\nThe reality star’s husband agrees, saying his wife is “always right,” so he will start living by this sentiment as well.\n\nNever miss a story — sign up for PEOPLE's free daily newsletter to stay up-to-date on the best of what PEOPLE has to offer, from juicy celebrity news to compelling human interest stories.\n\n“I'm gonna follow this advice,\" he says. \"Run right next to her at a slower pace.\"\n\nBarbie Dreamhouse Challenge premieres Sunday, July 16 at 8 p.m. ET on HGTV.\n\nFor more People news, make sure to sign up for our newsletter!"
