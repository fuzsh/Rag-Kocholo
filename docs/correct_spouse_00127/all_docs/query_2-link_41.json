        "text": "Christina Hall has been happily married to her husband Josh Hall since 2022, and the pair love residing in their remodeled Newport Beach and Tennessee homes. However, prior to the Christina on the Coast star's current relationship, she was married to and lived with British star Ant Anstead from 2018 to 2021.\n\nThis pair also shared a home in Newport Beach, but after their split, Ant left the house and Christina eventually sold the property in July 2021. Speaking with People in June 2021 after their divorce was finalized, the For the Love of Cars host explained: \"When my divorce went through, I packed up my clothes and moved. I walked away completely and left everything there.\" He later began house hunting with the pair's son Hudson, eventually settling in a luxury Laguna Beach home.\n\nChristina meanwhile stayed in the property, but soon put it on the market. Listed for $6 million, prior to leaving the property Christina shared many insights into her life with her and Ant's son Hudson and her other two children Taylor and Brayden (who she shares with ex-husband Tarek El Moussa) on social media.\n\nAs a result, it's possible to look back on the pair's impressive former home, so join HELLO! as we look at all you need to know about the family's old property below.\n\nChristina and Ant's garden\n\nIt's safe to say Christina's old backyard was more like a holiday resort – complete with an immaculate lawn, giant pool with water slide, oversized LOVE letters and pergola with hanging lanterns. Christina and Ant purchased their four-bedroom farmhouse for $4.1 million according to a report by Orange County Register.\n\nChristina and Ant's former living room\n\nOne of the spaces that used to feature the most on Christina's social media was her and Ant's former open-plan living room. Much like her current living space in Newport Beach, the area was designed and curated to perfection with gorgeous monochrome features. The high ceilings and wood beams gave a nod to the property's farmhouse structure, but the interiors were stylishly modern.\n\nChristina completed the space with a formal cream sofa (which she designed herself) dressed with black and white printed cushions. Behind the sofa was also a farmhouse-style dining table and a very unique wine rack which filled the entire wall!\n\nChristina and Ant's former kitchen\n\nThis picture was taken before the star switched up her living room furniture, but it allowed fans to see inside her immaculate kitchen. The space was a real highlight of the family home thanks to its enormous marble island lined with barstools and minimalist white cupboards. Christina also brightened up her cooking area with pot plants and vases – but the style is most certainly pared-back chic.\n\nThe Ansteads' family bathroom\n\nOne of the property's bathrooms was revealed on Christina's Instagram when she took this fetching mirror selfie. The TV star kept up her monochrome style in this space too with geometric floor tiles, a round mirror above the sink and a vast marble shower area.\n\nChristina and Ant's former pantry\n\nA kitchen of such grandeur requires a suitably large pantry – and this walk-in cupboard is what dreams are made of. The star beamed proudly as she showed off her meticulously organised space, complete with wicker baskets and tidy containers.\n\nChristina's closet\n\nJust like her pantry, Christina's closet was spectacularly pristine. There were pigeonholes for her growing shoe collection and hanging rails for the couple's clothes – which appeared to be in muted colours just like her ultra-luxe home.\n\nChristina and Ant's son Hudson's nursery\n\nChristina once filmed a clip inside her son's beautiful nursery to show her fans the gorgeous décor. She captioned the post: \"Excited to share our little guy's nursery. Loving the boho vibes.\" Her followers could see the sweet wooden crib, star mobile and a macramé wall hanging – in the foreground there was also a gold footstool and hippo-shaped rocking horse.\n\nMore Homes\n\nSee more\n\nGalleryInside Ruth Langsford and Eamonn Holmes £3.5m marital home in Surrey amid shock divorce\n\nInside Ruth Langsford and Eamonn Holmes £3.5m marital home in Surrey amid shock divorce\n\nJennifer Garner gives epic house tour ahead of daughter Violet's emotional departure\n\nThe Hollywood star shares three children with ex Ben Affleck\n\nGeorge and Amal Clooney remodel $8.3m chateau to resemble dreamy Lake Como villa\n\nThe ER actor and his human rights lawyer wife Amal have multiple homes\n\nInside the late Ivana Trump's $19.5 million Versailles-inspired New York townhouse\n\nIvana tragically died in 2022 after falling down the stairs\n\nCarrie Johnson shows off ginormous family garden in £3.5 million mansion\n\nBoris Johnson and his wife moved into the property last year…\n\nPhilanthropist Nancy Davis unveils timeless Beverly Hills home\n\nThe oil heiress and philanthropist takes us inside her five-bedroom, six-bathroom home in Mulholland Estates\n\nStephen Mangan's private canal-side home in Primrose Hill is 'chaos'\n\nThe I'm Alan Partridge star lives with his wife Louise and three kids\n\nCarole and Michael's £4.7m 18-acre home is a private family haven - inside\n\nThe Berkshire home is where the Prince and Princess of Wales stayed with baby Prince George"
