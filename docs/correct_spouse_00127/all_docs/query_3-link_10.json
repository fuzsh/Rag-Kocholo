        "text": "Christina Hall deleted an Instagram photo from her wedding to Josh Hall hours after it was revealed that he filed for divorce.\n\nThe image, which showed the former couple holding hands at their 2022 nuptials in Hawaii, was removed by the HGTV star on Tuesday, per People.\n\nThe now-exes were beaming in the picture as they posed in front of the ocean at sunset.\n\n“My dream man on the dreamiest island. Maui holds a special place in my heart. What an amazing night filled with love,” the “Flip or Flop” alum, 41, captioned the snap from September 2022.\n\nChristina and Josh hosted the destination wedding for their friends and family after secretly tying the knot on Oct. 6, 2021.\n\nDespite scrapping the photo from the ceremony, the mom of three kept other photos with Josh, including a September 2023 photo of them on Fifth Avenue in New York City.\n\nNews of their breakup comes months after Josh posted a photo of himself and his estranged wife kissing in the ocean during a vacation in Cabo San Lucas, Mexico.\n\n“Still going strong,” he wrote at the time.\n\nThe realtor filed for divorce from Christina on Monday in Orange County, Calif., after nearly three years of marriage, per documents obtained by Page Six.\n\nHe listed their date of separation as July 8 and cited “irreconcilable differences” as the reason for their split.\n\nAccording to the documents, Josh wants the “Christina on the Coast” star to pay him alimony and is asking the court not to award her spousal support from him.\n\nWhile they don’t have a prenup, he is also requesting for their assets to be divided based on what they each owned before getting married.\n\nAdditionally, he is seeking all the rights to the HGTV and Discovery Network shows they produced together during their marriage.\n\nTheir home makeover show, “The Flip Off,” is set be released in 2025.\n\nMeanwhile, E! News reports Christina is asking the court to terminate spousal support for Josh in her divorce papers filed Monday.\n\nShe also listed their date of separation as July 7.\n\nChristina was previously married to Tarek El Moussa from 2009 to 2018. The exes share daughter Taylor, 13, and son Brayden, 8."
