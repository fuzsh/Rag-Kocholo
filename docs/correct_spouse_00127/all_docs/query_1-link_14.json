        "text": "When Christina Hall entered the HGTV scene, she did so as part of a couple with her Flip or Flop costar Tarek El Moussa. Naturally, their marriage was in the public eye—and their romantic lives have been under the spotlight ever since. After divorcing Tarek and British TV personality Ant Anstead, Christina married her current husband Josh Hall.\n\nThrough childbirths, name changes, and rumors, Christina’s relationship history hasn’t been easy to follow. If you’re eager to get a basic rundown, here’s a timeline of her public love life.\n\n2009: Christina Haack and Tarek El Moussa get married\n\nChristina and Tarek met in 2005 while working as real estate agents in California. Christina told Good Housekeeping that on the same day they started dating in 2006, they moved in together. The pair tied the knot in May 2009, which was four years before their HGTV show catapulted them to reality TV stardom.\n\n2010: Christina and Tarek welcome their first child\n\nThe couple welcomed their first child Taylor just over a year after they wed. Now, their almost 13-year-old daughter looks like Christina’s mini-me. Christina recently gave her a bedroom makeover, and Taylor’s been known to raid her mom’s closet.\n\n2013: Flip of Flop premieres on HGTV\n\nIn 2013, Christina and Tarek’s show Flip or Flop aired on HGTV. The home renovation show instantly became popular, lasting a total of 10 seasons.\n\n2015: Christina and Tarek welcome their second child\n\nChristina and Tarek welcomed their second child Brayden in 2015 after Christina underwent IVF, People reported. Like his sister, the now 8-year-old helps his mom with design projects and appears on her shows Christina on the Coast and Christina in the Country. Brayden and Taylor also appear on Tarek’s show called Flipping the El Moussas.\n\nDecember 2016: Christina and Tarek announce their separation\n\nIn May 2016, Christina and Tarek got into an explosive fight. Cops were called to their home in response to a “possibly suicidal male with a gun,” Us Weekly reported. About seven months later, the couple announced their separation. They acknowledged the incident in a statement to Us Weekly that read: “Like many couples, we have had challenges in our marriage. We had an unfortunate misunderstanding about six months ago and the police were called to our house in an abundance of caution. There was no violence and no charges were filed. We chose to get counseling to sort out our relationship. Together, we have decided to separate while we reevaluate the future of our marriage. During this process, we are committed to our kids and being the best parents we can be. We will continue to work through this process civilly and cooperatively, and plan to continue our professional life together.”\n\nJanuary 2017: Tarek files for divorce from Christina\n\nTarek filed for divorce from Christina in January 2017, according to People. Tarek’s lawyer also confirmed to the outlet that he requested spousal support from Christina. The filing came amid reports of alleged infidelity.\n\nOctober 2017: Christina starts dating Ant Anstead\n\nBefore her divorce from Tarek was finalized, Christina started dating British Wheeler Dealers star Ant Anstead. The duo was introduced through a mutual friend. Like Christina, Ant had two kids from a previous marriage. Christina shared a mushy Instagram post on their one-year anniversary in October 2018.\n\nJanuary 1, 2018: Christina and Ant go public with their relationship\n\nChristina and Ant kept their relationship private at first. It wasn’t until January 2018 that Christina casually confirmed her romance with Ant through a photo she posted on Instagram. In the now-deleted post, they were biking. A source then confirmed their relationship to US Weekly.\n\nJanuary 22, 2018: Christina and Tarek’s divorce is finalized\n\nChristina and Tarek’s divorce was finalized at the end of January 2018, a rep for Christina confirmed to Page Six. Despite their divorce, Christina and Tarek continued to film their HGTV show Flip or Flop together. After 10 seasons, the series finale aired in March 2022. They both discussed what it was like to film after their split in a joint interview and separately on their own social media.\n\nTarek recently announced in a voiceover video on Instagram that he goes deeper into their “very public” divorce in his upcoming book titled , which will be released in February 2024. \"I thought I was at the top of my game,\" he said. \"It was a massive struggle, but I built myself back up.\"\n\nTarek is now married to Selling Sunset's Heather Rae El Moussa, who he had another child with named Tristian Jay.\n\nDecember 22, 2018: Christina and Ant get married\n\nJust over a year after they started dating, Christina and Ant tied the knot. They never publicly announced their engagement. “We pulled off the perfect surprise wedding,” Christina told People of the winter wonderland-themed event that took place at their home in Newport Beach, California. “Seeing the happy tears of friends and family was priceless.”\n\nMarch 2019: Christina and Ant announce they’re having a baby\n\nChristina and Ant announced they were expecting a baby in now-deleted Instagram posts. Ant posted a photo of all four of their kids with a picture of the sonogram in the center. \"The kids are all so excited to meet their new sibling,\" Christina captioned her post, adding #gonnaneedabiggercar at the end.\n\nDuring a TMZ Live appearance, Christina’s ex Tarek accidentally revealed that Christina and Ant were expecting a baby boy. Shortly after, Christina’s publicist confirmed the news to People. “While Christina and Ant wished they could have shared the news themselves, they are very excited to welcome a baby boy in the fall,” they told the outlet.\n\nSeptember 2019: Christina gives birth to her third child\n\nChristina and Ant welcomed their son Hudson London Anstead in September 2019. Christina documented Taylor and Brayden meeting their little brother for the first time on her show Christina on the Coast.\n\nAnt revealed the backstory behind their son’s name to Entertainment Tonight, noting that the couple didn’t talk much about it. \"I know that parents expecting can obsess over it, but we never really sat down that often,\" Ant said to ET. \"We kind of arrived at Hudson together, because it's a name that we both love. It's also the name of a car, which is quite funny.\"\n\nLondon was selected for his middle name because it ties back to Ant’s British roots. \"I think a lot of burden is put on someone's middle name, but the reality is that you never use it,\" he added. \"So the middle name, for me, represents something memorable. A middle name is an opportunity to represent you, and what better name for an Anglo-American child than London?\"\n\nSeptember 2020: Christina and Ant announce their separation\n\nA year after they welcomed Hudson, Christina and Ant announced their separation. Ant shared a black-and-white photo of the pair on Instagram with the caption: “Anyone who really knows me knows that I don’t like to share private matters publicly. I have remained silent while holding on to hope. I never gave up on us. I pray Christina’s decision brings her happiness.”\n\nNovember 2020: Christina files for divorce from Ant\n\nIn early November, Christina's best friend Cassie Zebisch confirmed to People that the HGTV star had officially filed for divorce from Ant. Soon after, court documents obtained by In Touch showed that Christina was also seeking joint legal and physical custody of their then 14-month-old son Hudson. According to the documents, Christina and Ant both opted out of spousal support and agreed to pay their own attorney’s fees. Christina cited the reason behind their divorce as \"irreconcilable differences.\"\n\nMarch 2021: Christina starts dating Josh Hall\n\nChristina started dating real estate agent Josh Hall in early 2021. At the time, he was based in Austin. According to Us Weekly, they met at a real estate conference. They kept their relationship pretty quiet, so it’s unclear when exactly they started dating, but Christina did reveal on Instagram that they have been together since at least March 2021.\n\nJune 2021: Christina and Ant’s divorce is finalized\n\nNine months after announcing their separation, Christina and Ant’s divorce was finalized on June 21. In the filing, it was decided that the former couple would continue to share joint custody of their son. Just days later, TMZ reported that Ant had moved on with a somewhat surprising new love interest: Renée Zellweger.\n\nSeptember 2021: Christina and Josh announce their engagement\n\nWhile on a trip to Los Cabos, Mexico, Christina and Josh announced their engagement. Christina shared a series of photos on Instagram, the last of which showed off her ring.\n\nApril 2022: Christina and Josh get married\n\nChristina and Josh tied the knot in a private ceremony, E! News confirmed at the time. The couple didn’t immediately post about their marriage, but Christina changed her name on Instagram from Christina Haack to Christina Hall. The outlet also reported that Christina’s last name was also changed to Hall on her real estate license.\n\nIn a joint Instagram post in September 2022, the couple shared an image from their wedding that took place in Maui, Hawaii. Christina captioned it: “Shared vows in front of family and our close friends. Everything in life has led me to where I am right now, which is exactly where I want to be. My dream man on the dreamiest island. Maui holds a special place in my heart. What an amazing night filled with love.”\n\nIt's later revealed the couple actually wed in October 2021 (more on that below!).\n\nApril 2022: Ant files for full custody of son Hudson\n\nThe same month Christina and Josh wed, Ant filed for full custody of Hudson. Ant claimed Christina had been mostly absent from their son's life, according to documents obtained by TMZ, alleging that she had spent an \"average of nine full days each month over the last 20 months\" with him.\n\nAnt's emergency order for full custody was denied the same day \"because he failed to prove there were critical circumstances concerning the child and didn't give Hall enough notice,\" People reported.\n\nDuring their custody dispute, Ant also claimed that Christina exploited Hudson for paid promotions on social media. Per court documents obtained by E! News, Christina denied that she exploited their son and said that he appeared in a few of her own Instagram ads \"that each took less than five minutes to film.\"\n\nIn response to the filing, Christina told Us Weekly in a statement: “What Ant is doing deeply saddens me. If this was really about Hudson, as he says, this should have been handled privately with a private judge or mediation, as myself and my attorney have suggested. I have had my share of ups and downs but I am a good mom and I love my children with all my heart and I will always protect them.”\n\nNovember 2022: Christina and Ant settle custody battle\n\nChristina and Ant settled the custody battle in November 2022, agreeing to maintain joint legal and physical custody of Hudson. Some schedule changes were made to their initial 2021 agreement, according to court documents obtained by People.\n\nJuly 2024: Christina and Josh file for divorce\n\nAfter three years together, Christina and Josh both filed for divorce. According to paperwork obtained by TMZ and People, Josh filed for a dissolution of marriage due to irreconcilable differences. He also requested spousal support from Christina and asked the court to \"grant him all rights to any HGTV and/or Discovery Network shows or specials they produced during their marriage,\" per TMZ, which has left fans wondering about the fate of their upcoming show The Flip Off. Sources close to Christina tell the outlets that she has filed for divorce, too.\n\nAccording to E! News, the documents also revealed that the pair officially tied the knot in October 2021. That's six months before the couple announced their union on social media and one month after announcing their engagement."
