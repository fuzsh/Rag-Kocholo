Christina and her former HGTV costar, 41, later welcomed son Brayden, now 7, before they separated in 2016. Christina and El Moussa — who welcomed son Tristan Jay with wife Heather Rae El Moussa (née Young) in January — finalized their divorce in 2018.\n\nAfter her divorce from Tarek, Christina moved on with Ant Anstead, tying the knot in 2019 before their son Hudson, now 3, arrived. After Christina and Anstead’s own divorce in 2021, they were involved in a contentious custody battle. Anstead, 44, had claimed Christina’s use of Hudson in her TV shows and social media ads were exploitative, which she has since denied. They settled their court battle last year.\n\nChristina Hall and Joshua Hall’s Relationship Timeline\n\nRead article\n\nThe Christina on the Coast designer later found love with Josh and they secretly wed in April 2022.\n\n“At this point in my life, I really value privacy when I can get it. So Josh and I decided to do a courthouse ceremony, just the two of us,” she revealed during the first episode of Christina in the Country, which premiered on HGTV in December 2022. “Something private, just for us. And then later, we’ll do a reception for the kids and family.”\n\nIn order to view the video, please allow Manage Cookies\n\nChristina and Josh — who have since launched a joint production company — held a second wedding ceremony in September 2022 with all three of her children in attendance. Following their nuptials, Josh quickly stepped into a supportive parent role, even calling himself a “protector” of Taylor, Brayden and Hudson in his Instagram bio.\n\nChristina Haack's Blended Family Guide: Her Kids, Ex-Husbands and More\n\nRead article"
