The Be Cool star announced Saturday that she and boyfriend Matt Pokora welcomed their little boy.\n\nTaking to Instagram, Milian shared a glowing photo of her holding her newborn in the hospital room and gushed in the caption, “Kenna, Welcome to the world baby boy!”\n\n“Wow, What an adventure we’ve been on since the day he was conceived! I thank God everyday for blessing me with his super active energy (wonder where he gets it from?),” she laughed while including the looking eyes emoji. “And now to meet our healthy baby boy?! Thankful. Blessed.”\n\nShe sweetly signed off with, “Now it’s party of 5 baby! Thank you my @mattpokora for being the best partner/dad/ best friend a woman could ask for. You’re a king in my eyes.”\n\nPokora, a French singer/songwriter, also celebrated his newborn’s arrival on Saturday, sharing a black and white photo of him cradling his son and announced that little Kenna arrived on April 24.\n\nThe couple announced their little one’s impending arrival in December, with the “Party Up” singer revealing on Instagram via a silhouette showing off her growing stomach, “You and Me + 3.”\n\nThe two started dating in August 2017 and welcomed their first child, Isaiah, in January 2020.\n\nAside from one-year-old Isaiah, Kenna also has a big sister in Milian’s 10-year-old daughter, Violet Madison, whom she shares with ex-husband The Dream.\n\nView this post on Instagram\n\nA post shared by Christina Milian (@christinamilian)\n\nCopyright © 2021, ABC Audio.
