        "text": "Christina Hall (n√©e Haack) and her husband, Joshua Hall, have split and both filed for divorce after more than two years of marriage.\n\nChristina filed for a dissolution of marriage on Monday, July 15, according to paperwork obtained by Us Weekly. She cited irreconcilable differences as the reason for the split and listed the date of separation as July 7. Joshua also filed on Monday and listed the date of the split as July 8.\n\nChristina is asking the court to restore her last name to Haack, is requesting that neither party receive spousal support and wants Joshua to pay her lawyer fees. Joshua, meanwhile, is seeking spousal support from Christina and asked her to pay his attorney fees.\n\nThe couple met in 2021 after Christina‚Äôs tumultuous divorce from Ant Anstead. That July, Christina, 41, got candid in an Instagram post about her new relationship with Joshua, writing that she wanted to ‚Äúprotect‚Äù him from public scrutiny.\n\n‚ÄúI met Josh when I wasn‚Äôt in a state of fear or fight-or-flight. ‚Ä¶ The synchronicities hit us so hard and fast they were impossible to ignore,‚Äù she said at the time. ‚ÄúI felt immediately crazy protective over him and wanted to keep him for myself and get to know each other before the tornado (media attention) hit.\n\nIt wasn‚Äôt long before Christina responded to critics who chastised her for moving forward soon after her split from Anstead, 45.\n\nAfter months of speculation, Christina shared the news on Instagram in September 2021 that she and Joshua were engaged, posting a photo of a diamond ring during a vacation in Mexico. ‚Äú‚ù§Ô∏è‚ôæüîíüóù üíç,‚Äù she captioned the post.\n\nThe couple tied the knot in a secret ceremony in April 2022. The following October, they walked down the aisle a second time in Hawaii with Christina‚Äôs kids in attendance. (Christina shares daughter Taylor, 13, and son Brayden, 8, with ex-husband Tarek El Moussa and son Hudson, 4, with Anstead.)\n\n‚ÄúShared vows in front of family and our close friends,‚Äù Christina captioned a photo via Instagram at the time. ‚ÄúEverything in life has led me to where I am right now, which is exactly where I want to be. My dream man on the dreamiest island. Maui holds a special place in my heart. What an amazing night filled with love.‚Äù\n\nBefore the couple celebrated their one-year wedding anniversary in 2023, Joshua joked about a breakup via social media.\n\n‚ÄúHow long will this one last?‚Äù he jokingly captioned an Instagram carousel at the time, sharing snaps of the twosome.\n\n‚ÄúBetter be ‚ôæÔ∏è !!! ‚ù§Ô∏è,‚Äù she replied in the comments section.\n\nLater that year, Christina spoke exclusively to Us Weekly about relationships and coparenting with Tarek, who married Selling Sunset alum Heather Rae El Moussa (n√©e Young) in 2021.\n\n‚ÄúThings that I put up with in my 20s are things I‚Äôd never put up with in my 40s,‚Äù Christina told Us. ‚ÄúIn my relationship right now, we‚Äôre able to communicate, not get emotionally overwhelmed and speak nicely to each other. Some things come with maturity. It definitely helps.‚Äù\n\nChristina added, ‚ÄúHe‚Äôs protective, but not in a jealous or controlling way. I‚Äôm also a lot calmer than I used to be. Before, if someone pissed me off, I‚Äôd flip out.‚Äù"
