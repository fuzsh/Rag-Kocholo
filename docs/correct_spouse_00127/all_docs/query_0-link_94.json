        "text": "A double portion of congratulations are in order for singers Christina Milian and her now-husband Matt Pokora. On December 10, the couple announced on social media that they are expecting baby #2 together, but according to French magazine Public, the lovers shared nuptials just the day before the big announcement.\n\nThe famous couple, who are parents to 10-month-old Isaiah and Violet Nash, 10 (whom Christina shares with her ex-husband and music producer The Dream), reportedly married at the “town hall” in Paris where the current mayor of the arrondissement, or district, officiated their intimate wedding.\n\nIn a description that was translated to English, Christina Milian opted to keep her attire a bit more simple, donning a white satin dress. Reports state that the couple and their loved ones enjoyed a celebratory lunch at Les Jardins du Faubourg restaurant afterwards.\n\nThough the wedding made things official, the pair has been a happy family for years now. After meeting in Saint-Tropez, France in 2017, Christina Milian and Matt Pilots who share the same September 26 birthday, hit it off quickly. Matt Pokora also seamlessly gained a trust and relationship with Christina’s daughter Violet, teaching her his native French language, creating songs together, and taking her to school.\n\nThe family splits their time between France and Los Angeles, still managing to keep up with their equally busy schedules. Christina Milian, a successful singer and actress, just completed a Netflix film while Matt Pokora is an award-winning singer who often tours the world with his music.\n\nCongratulations to the family!"
