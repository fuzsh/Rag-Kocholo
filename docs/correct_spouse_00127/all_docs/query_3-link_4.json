        "text": "She flipped, now she flopped.\n\nHGTV star Christina Hall (née Haack), 41, is heading for a divorce from her third husband, Joshua Hall, 43, according to TMZ.\n\nPer the outlet, Hall filed for a dissolution of marriage Tuesday in Orange County, California, citing irreconcilable differences and listing July 8 as the separation date. He is also requesting spousal support.\n\nHaack reportedly filed for divorce on Monday, and it hasn’t been processed yet.\n\nThe couple have been married for nearly three years, as Haack married Hall, a real estate agent and former police officer, on Oct. 6, 2021.\n\nIn a 2022 episode of “Christina on the Coast,” Haack explained why they had a private wedding first.\n\n“At this point in my life, I really value privacy when I can get it,” she said. “So Josh and I decided to do a courthouse ceremony, just the two of us. Something private, just for us. And then, later, we’ll do a reception for the kids and family.”\n\nOn Labor Day weekend 2022, they had a bigger oceanfront ceremony in Maui, Hawaii.\n\nAt the time of their marriage, Haack posted on Instagram, “Shared vows in front of family and our close friends. Everything in life has led me to where I am right now, which is exactly where I want to be.”\n\nShe gushed: “My dream man.”\n\nThis will be Haack’s third divorce.\n\nPreviously, Haack was married to fellow HGTV star Tarek El Moussa from 2009 to 2018. The former couple has daughter Taylor, 13, and son Brayden, 8.\n\nTheir relationship ended with drama, as El Moussa wrote in his memoir that after a heated argument, he “went out to our backyard in Yorba Linda and hopped over the fence.”\n\nHowever, he said that Hall thought he was fleeing with a gun and called the cops.\n\nAccording to El Moussa, he wanted to exercise and scout the trails near their house. He said that he brought along a gun because they lived near Chino Hills State Park, California, which is a hotbed of mountain lions and bobcats.\n\nFrom 2018 to 2021, Haack was married to British TV host, car builder and motor specialist Ant Anstead, whom she has son Hudson, 4, with. Anstead has since moved on with actress Renée Zellweger.\n\nHaack met Hall after her divorce from Anstead. In an Instagram post in July 2021, she wrote that she wanted to “protect” Hall from public scrutiny.\n\n“I met Josh when I wasn’t in a state of fear or fight-or-flight … The synchronicities hit us so hard and fast they were impossible to ignore,” she wrote at the time.\n\n“I felt immediately crazy protective over him and wanted to keep him for myself and get to know each other before the tornado (media attention) hit.”\n\nAround their first wedding anniversary, Hall wrote “How long will this one last?” in an Instagram post.\n\n“Not long according to TMZ!” the most recent comment said.\n\nHaack previously starred in HGTV’s “Flip or Flop” with El Moussa, which ran from 2013-2022. The exes continued doing the show together even after splitting up.\n\nShe also appears in “Christina on the Coast” and “Christina in the Country,” which Hall co-starred in.\n\nAs of now, Hall and Haack are set to appear with El Moussa and his wife, “Selling Sunset” alum Heather Rae Young, on “The Flip Off,” which is expected in early 2025.\n\nThe Post reached out to HGTV for an update about the status of “The Flip Off.”"
