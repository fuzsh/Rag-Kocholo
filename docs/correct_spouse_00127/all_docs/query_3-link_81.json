Reality star Christina Hall and husband Josh Hall celebrated their marriage with friends and family in the stunning setting of Maui.\n\nThe pair who got married secretly in April celebrated their nuptials with an intimate oceanfront ceremony for friends and family at Merriman's Kapalua, Hawaii.\n\nToday's top videos\n\n'Shared vows in front of family and our close friends' the Flip or Flop star 39, captioned a photo on her social media.\n\nThe stunning snap showed the mum of three in a sheer nude gown with white floral embellishments as she embraced her realtor husband, 41, who wore a beige suit, with a breathtaking sunset in the backdrop.\n\n'Everything in life has led me to where I am right now, which is exactly where I want to be. My dream man on the dreamiest island. Maui holds a special place in my heart. What an amazing night filled with love' Christina continued.\n\nThe pair said 'I do' for the second time with all of the children present. She shares a daughter, Taylor, 11, and son Brayden, 7, with ex-husband Tarek El Moussa, to who she was married from 2009 to 2018.\n\nChristina also shares son Hudson, 2, with Ant Anstead, who she married in September 2019. They finalized their divorce in June 2021.\n\nBrayden and Hudson walked their mum down the aisle, standing either side of her, holding her hands, and were greeted by Josh, 41, who knelt down to greet the boys at the altar.\n\nAttended by 40 close friends and family, the ceremony featured hula dancers who performed during the reception."
