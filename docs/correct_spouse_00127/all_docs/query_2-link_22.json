        "text": "Mashonda Tifrere, Alicia Keys and producer Swizz Beatz aren’t the only celebrities who have this co-parenting thing down to the T. Christina Milian, ex-husband Terius “The-Dream” Nash and his wife Lalonne have such a positive co-parenting relationship, they did a small vacation together with their kids in Puerto Rico recently.\n\nChristina shared an image of herself with Lalonne, who was holding onto her youngest daughter, with the caption, “I’m having a blast raising these crazy little siblings together with you. This friendship/partnership is truly a blessing.”\n\nThe-Dream also captioned a photo of his three daughters, including daughter Violet with Christina, Maverick with Lalonne, and Navy with ex-wife Nivea, enjoying bonding time by saying, “Girl Time! Live from Puerto Rico when your sister come visit you on a island! That’s love!”\n\nLalonne and The-Dream have been married since 2014 and share three kids. He and Christina were married from 2009 to 2011, and following their split, co-parenting was pretty contentious. Thankfully though, Christina told the ladies of The Real recently that they’d come a long way and found themselves in a good place, and to have a friendship with Lalonne was a bonus."
