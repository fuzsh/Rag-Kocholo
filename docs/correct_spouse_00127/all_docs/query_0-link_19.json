What a blessing! Let’s do this babe @mattpokora ❤️!\" she captioned an Instagram post of herself holding a sonogram over her baby bump while standing beside Matt.\n\nThe first time dad, who is a French singer, also shared the news on Instagram, posting a black-and-white version of the photo with the caption, \"La relève est en route! 🙏🏼🙌🏼 Legacy on the way! 🙏🏼🙌🏼 #happyman @christinamilian ❤️.\"\n\nThe couple's bundle of joy will join Christina's nine-year-old daughter Violet Madison, whom she shares with ex-husband, The-Dream.\n\nThe legendary producer reacted to his ex-wife's big news in the most loving way on Monday (July 29), captioning Matt and Christina's Instagram announcement with a beautiful message of his own. \"I’m Delighted to wait the arrival and Welcome the Beautiful Being that’s on the way for @christinamilian and @mattpokora,\" he wrote. \"What most may not know is I’ve asked for this moment to be Realized more than I can count.
