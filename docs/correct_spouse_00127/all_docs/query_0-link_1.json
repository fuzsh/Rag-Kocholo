        "text": "After less than a year of marriage, The-Dream and Christina Milian have gone their separate ways.\n\nThe singer/songwriter and producer, whose real name is Terius Nash, confirmed his split from Milian today (July 12) to UsMagazine.com after photos surfaced of him being intimate with his assistant, Melissa Santiago, over the weekend.\n\nNash and Milian were married last September and welcomed a baby daughter, Violet, in March.\n\n“Terius ‘The-Dream’ Nash is saddened to announce that his marriage to Christina Milian was unsuccessful,” said his rep in a statement. “The couple reached this decision in late 2009, but decided to keep the news private in efforts to protect their baby daughter Violet. They ask for consideration and respect for their family moving forward.”\n\nOn June 29, Milian sent a Twitter message in support of her husband’s just-released album, “Love King.” “Everybody go pick up that LOVEKING album from THE-DREAM ASAP!” she tweeted. “Support my boo!”\n\nThe-Dream deleted his own Twitter account a few days earlier, after receiving criticsm for an interview with Parlour Magazine in which said he that wasn’t helping to raise his newborn daughter. “I don’t because my “helping out” turns into expectations,” he said. I’ll get Violet on a late night maybe one or two times, but after that, no. If Christina’s tired, call the nanny, call Violet’s granny. We got people.”"
