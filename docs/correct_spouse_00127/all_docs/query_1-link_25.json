(sic)\"\n\nAnd Paul, 30, wasn't shy when it came to gushing over his new spouse on social media either, as he also took to his photo sharing account to post a glowing tribute to his \"dream girl\".\n\nHe wrote: \"4 years ago today I met my dream girl in this room. 4 years later today I married my dream girl and best friend. Pretty sure I'm the proudest I've EVER been to be able to call the most bellissima person + woman I've ever known now my wife!!! Whoa. I thank God for the gift of her, our relationship, our bambino on the way, our family's love and support and this unforgettable year. And for friends and fam wondering... invites to an official shindig coming soon...now I'm going to go scream this news on rooftops across this town because I AM that guy. (sic)\"\n\nThe couple announced their engagement in June this year, and two months later in August, they revealed they are expecting a child together.\n\nThe 'Jar of Hearts' hitmaker shared a picture of her from a side profile to show of her growing baby bump, whilst her three-year-old niece Tesla is captured touching her swelling belly whilst smiling.\n\nAnd across the image it had the words \"Tesla's little cousin is coming soon (sic)\" emblazoned across the top with an arrow pointing to the brunette beauty.\n\nThe sweet image, which has been edited with a black and white filter, was posted on Christina's Instagram account, and has been captioned: \"guess what? (sic).\""
