        "text": "Renovation shows tend to focus on people working in pairs to get the work done — it's not like flipping a house is a one-person (or even a two-person!) job.\n\nHaving two people on a team allows them to bring different strengths to the renovation. Their bickering also makes for great TV drama (see: The Block).\n\nOften these shows are hosted by husband-and-wife duos who go on to become celebrities, such as Fixer Upper's Chip and Joanna Gaines, and Escape to the Chateau's Dick Strawbridge and Angela Adoree.\n\nRELATED: Flip or Flop's Tarek El Moussa turns hoarder house into a young family's dream home\n\nBut what happens when you're a husband-and-wife duo fronting a popular TV show and you break up?\n\nThis happened with Flip or Flop's Tarek El Moussa and Christina Anstead. They successfully managed to divorce and get back to business as usual, seemingly without a hitch.\n\nHere's how they navigate their personal and public lives, and why they're still able to work together on Flip or Flop (which you can watch on 9Now).\n\nWho are Tarek El Moussa and Christina Anstead?\n\nTarek, 39, and Christina, 37, are former real estate agents from Orange Country, California who married in 2009, when Christina was 26 and Tarek was 28.\n\nAfter the real estate crash in 2008 they started flipping homes in their area. A few years later, Tarek sent an audition tape to US network HGTV featuring a complete house flip. This led to the creation of Flip or Flop, which premiered in 2013.\n\nBy the time the show started the couple had a daughter, Taylor, who was born in 2010. Their son, Brayden, was born in 2015.\n\nWhat is Flip or Flop?\n\nFlip or Flop is a TV series that follows Tarek and Christina as they buy properties and flip them for resale. So far there have been eight seasons and 110 episodes, and it's been renewed for a ninth season.\n\nRELATED: 5 shows to watch if you cannot get enough of home design\n\nThey often buy homes 'sight unseen', which means they don't see the property before paying upfront in cash.\n\nChristina is usually the pair's design lead.\n\nThe show has been so successful that it's led to spin-offs in other parts of America featuring other couples, such as Flip or Flop Atlanta, starring real estate agent Anita Corsini and her contractor husband Ken, and Flip or Flop Nashville, with real estate agents DeRon Jenkins and Page Turner.\n\nThe episodes are around 22 minutes long and show a property's complete renovation.\n\nWhen did Tarek El Moussa and Christina Anstead split?\n\nTarek and Christina announced their separation in December 2016, after seven years of marriage.\n\nThey released a statement to People and mentioned there had been an incident at their home that involved the police.\n\n\"Like many couples, we have had challenges in our marriage,\" they said in the statement. \"We had an unfortunate misunderstanding about six months ago and the police were called to our house in an abundance of caution. There was no violence and no charges were filed.\n\n\"During the process, we are committed to our kids and being the best parents we can be. We will continue to work through this process civilly and cooperatively, and plan to continue our professional life together.\"\n\nThere were other factors that led to the breakdown of their marriage. In 2013, Tarek was diagnosed with thyroid cancer — a fan of the show, who happened to be a registered nurse, spotted a lump on his neck — and then testicular cancer. He's been in remission since 2014.\n\nThey struggled to conceive their second child (their first IVF attempt ended in miscarriage). Christina had Brayden in 2015 and returned to work after four weeks. She later admitted to People she should have taken more time off because \"it was too soon for me. I was overwhelmed. Tension between me and Tarek was high\".\n\n\"We weren't able to properly communicate anymore,\" Christina said. \"It got to the point where we weren't even driving to set together.\"\n\nHave Tarek El Moussa and Christina Anstead moved on?\n\nTarek and Christina are both in new relationships. Christina started dating British TV presenter Ant Anstead in November 2017, and by December 2018 they were married. In September 2019 they welcomed their first child together, a son named Hudson. (Ant had two children from his previous marriage.)\n\nTarek recently celebrated his own exciting relationship news: he's engaged. Tarek proposed to Heather Rae Young, a real estate agent on the Netflix show Selling Sunset (famous real estate agents must run in the same circles!), in July, after a year of dating.\n\nHe popped the question while they were on a boat trip, which is fitting because they met on his yacht during Fourth of July celebrations in 2019.\n\nHow has their divorce impacted the show?\n\nIt hasn't, really. The two try to keep their personal and professional lives private.\n\n\"We have so much fun on set and we look forward to continuing the show,\" Christina said on Good Morning America ahead of the eighth season's premiere. \"We met at work so we worked together before we ever started dating.\"\n\nThey even alluded to their divorce in a joking manner in the first episode of Season 8. They showed up to a property they had purchased sight unseen, and Tarek told Christina there was something interesting about this house.\n\n\"The guy that inherited the house said the old owner hated banks, hated credit cards, he only dealt with cash,\" Tarek explained. \"He said there's most likely money hidden around the house.\"\n\nAfter challenging themselves to find the money, Tarek added, \"And real quick, we're divorced now, so you don't get half.\"\n\n\"Uh, finders, keepers!\" Christina said.\n\nLater in the episode, Tarek opened up about their changed dynamic.\n\n\"A lot of things have changed with Christina and myself, but at the end of the day we want to be happy, we want to continue working together, and it's good for everybody just to have a bit of fun once in a while.\""
