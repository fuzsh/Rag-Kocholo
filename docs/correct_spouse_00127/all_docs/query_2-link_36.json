        "text": "christina haack/ instagram\n\nFollowing her divorce from Ant Anstead in June 2021, Christina Hall has found love — and marriage — again.\n\nPEOPLE broke the news that the HGTV star was dating someone new in the wake of her split from Anstead on July 6, 2021, when she and new beau Joshua Hall were pictured walking hand-in-hand at Los Angeles International Airport. The two were boarding a plane for a 38th birthday getaway for Christina. She later revealed that they had already been dating for several months at the time and noted they met in the spring of 2021.\n\nOn Sept. 20, 2021, the Christina on the Coast star confirmed she and Hall were engaged, posting several photos cozied up with the Austin-based realtor while celebrating his birthday in Mexico on Instagram. She sported a diamond ring in the pictures and captioned the post with five emojis: A heart, an infinity sign, a lock, a key and a ring. She later added a ring emoji to her bio.\n\nIn April 2022, PEOPLE confirmed the two tied the knot after dating for a year. TMZ was the first to confirm the news, with sources telling the outlet that they wed in California \"sometime over the last six months.\"\n\nOver Labor Day weekend in 2022, Christina and Joshua celebrated their nuptials with an intimate oceanfront ceremony for friends and family at Merriman's Kapalua in Maui, Hawaii. Christina posted about the special day on Instagram, captioning a photo of the couple, \"Shared vows in front of family and our close friends. Everything in life has led me to where I am right now, which is exactly where I want to be. My dream man on the dreamiest island.\"\n\nSo, who is the man in the designer's life? Here's everything to know about Joshua Hall and his relationship with Christina Hall.\n\nchristina haack/ instagram\n\nHe's a realtor based in Austin but has ties to California\n\nHall is a licensed realtor in Texas, where he works for a brokerage called Spyglass Realty. According to his realtor page, he specializes in buying and selling properties in the Greater Austin area and surrounding Hill Country. But he has a personal connection to Hall's home of Southern California.\n\nAfter visiting Austin and falling in love with all it has to offer, Hall moved to the city in 2017 from California, where he grew up.\n\n\"I just could not leave without buying a home of my own in this little slice of heaven,\" Hall wrote in his realtor bio, adding that he was born near Austin, at Ft. Hood Army base, where his father was stationed while serving in the military.\n\n\"As a youngster, my family was shuffled around the country for various military assignments before settling back into their hometown of Southern California,\" he wrote. \"It was there my parents raised my two younger sisters and me.\"\n\nRELATED: Christina Haack Shares First Photos of New Flame Joshua Hall from 'Romantic Dinner' on Vacation\n\nHis two younger sisters have also been in the spotlight\n\nJoshua is the older brother of Jessica Hall and Stacie Adams (née Stacie Hall), who have both been in the spotlight over the years.\n\nAdams gained fame for her role on The Hills, where she was known as \"Stacie the Bartender\" — the object of Spencer Pratt's flirtations, despite his being in a relationship with his now-wife Heidi Montag. Adams is now married with two kids but found herself in the spotlight in summer 2020 when her former roommate, Vanderpump Rules star Scheana Shay, revealed that she and Adams were once in a \"sexual throuple\" with John Mayer.\n\nHis other sister, Jessica — who is also married with two kids — is a former Playboy model, and has a history in television, getting her start as the host of the MTV reality series Burned. Fellow Playboy alum Kendra Wilkinson is one of Jessica's best friends and Jessica made regular appearances on Kendra and Kendra on Top. She also appeared on four episodes of The Hills alongside her sister and was one of the briefcase models on Deal or No Deal in 2005, according to her IMDb page.\n\nJessica is also the host of a podcast called Flashbacks, which she previously co-hosted with her friend, Selling Sunsest star Heather Rae Young — also a former Playboy model, who is currently engaged to Christina's first husband, HGTV star Tarek El Moussa.\n\nHe's been married before\n\nAccording to Jessica's Instagram, Hall got married in August 2016 to a woman named Chelsea. Jessica posted on Instagram to celebrate their one-year wedding anniversary in August 2017. It's unclear when Hall and Chelsea's marriage came to an end.\n\nJessica was one of the bridesmaids at the wedding and attended Chelsea's bachelorette party, as well. Wilkinson was also a guest and has been pictured with Hall at other events.\n\nRELATED VIDEO: Christina Haack Reveals She Smoked Psychedelic Toad Venom and Says It 'Reset My Brain'\n\nHe was a police officer for 16 years and was injured on the job\n\nAccording to Hall's realtor page, he began his real estate career later in life, after serving 16 years as a police officer in the state of California. His law enforcement career ended when he suffered an injury.\n\n\"While living in Southern California, I realized my passion was to help others and I became a Police Officer at the age of 21,\" he wrote. \"Before my 16-year career was cut short due to injuries sustained in the line of duty ultimately leading to early retirement, I took great pride in helping people with everyday difficulties and putting them at ease.\"\n\nHe added that his career in policing actually helped him on his path to becoming a realtor: \"With my previous career solving problems, helping others through difficult situations and my love for real estate, I made the decision to get my Texas real estate license,\" he wrote.\n\nRELATED: Christina Haack Has New Love Interest After Ant Anstead Divorce: 'An Immediate Real Connection'\n\nChristina Haack Instagram\n\nHe loves dogs\n\nMuch like his wife, Joshua seems to have a soft spot for canines — which is good news for Christina's two pups, Cash and Biggie!\n\nIn his realtor bio, Joshua said that in his spare time, he enjoys \"exploring with my two dogs, floating on one of Austin's many bodies of water or flying to rescue puppies from kill shelters.\"\n\nA white dog named Stella has turned up in Christina's Instagram Stories, showing Hall hanging out at her home.\n\nHe likes to keep his relationship private – but will speak up to support his wife\n\nOn April 13, 2022, Joshua posted a supportive message about Christina to Instagram. In his post, he shared two photos of him and his wife, hugging in front of a picturesque oceanfront pool.\n\n\"This woman I get to call mine is nothing short of incredible,\" he wrote in the caption. \"No one or no thing will keep her from achieving happiness/success. She doesn't need anyone's validation and certainly doesn't let anyone's disapproval affect what she does with HER life.\"\n\nHis message ended with a note about social media misconceptions. \"Reminder: social media is not reality,\" Joshua added. \"Some of the best moments are never captured by cameras and are not posted in any social media platforms. They are kept in private and are cherished together with those involved.\"\n\nHe enjoys family time\n\nIn May 2022, Christina shared a series of sweet photos from a family trip to La Jolla, Calif., with Joshua and her three kids, Brayden, Taylor and Hudson. She shares son Brayden and daughter Taylor with ex El Moussa, and son Hudson with ex Anstead.\n\nIn the photos, the group of five, plus their dog Stella, pose together while standing on a large rock in front of the ocean. The second picture also features Joshua's dad and stepmom.\n\nOther photos document Hall spending time with Christina and her children in Las Vegas, on Halloween and Christmas, at amusement parks and at home.\n\nHe's joining Hall on HGTV\n\nOn April 7, 2022, it was announced that Joshua will join Christina on her HGTV spinoff Christina in the Country, which will document their life in Tennessee, where Christina bought a vacation home last year.\n\nThe six-episode docu-series will premiere in late 2022. According to HGTV, the show will follow the designer and real estate pro as she expands her business and puts down roots with Hall and her three kids.\n\n\"I am so excited and grateful Christina in the Country has officially been picked up,\" Christina said in a statement shared with PEOPLE. \"I love that I get the best of both worlds—the coast and the country. It's an incredible opportunity to get to work in Tennessee, our home away from home.\""
