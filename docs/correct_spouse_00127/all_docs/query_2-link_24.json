        "text": "Three times is a charm for the Dream (real name Terius Youngdell Nash). This week, the singer/music producer stopped by Power 105’s The Breakfast Club, giving listeners a bit of insight on his personal relationships and ex’s (including Christina Milian and Nivea), noting exactly why his third marriage (he married Lalonne Martinez in 2014) is a perfect fit for him. The Dream also admits that a conversation has taken place between him and Lil Wayne (who is now dating Milian). Peep a few excerpts:\n\nIf he likes marriage:\n\nYeah, man you know I’m a hopeless romantic. I love being married. At least this time, I don’t have the drama around.\n\nWhat makes this marriage right:\n\nIt’s the non-drama. Like I don’t like call you to see where you’re at. I don’t do that. It’s that stuff. It’s that uneasy thing. Especially in this business. Like I need to be creative and do my thing. I don’t have that time for the nonsense.\n\nIf there’s less drama in his marriage because his wife isn’t in the industry:\n\nThat has a lot to do with it I think.\n\nHow he met his new wife:"
