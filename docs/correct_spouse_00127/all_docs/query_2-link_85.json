        "text": "Waiting for your permission to load the Instagram Media.\n\nSurprise! Christina Haack and Joshua Hall are married.\n\nTMZ reports they secretly tied the knot sometime in the last six months. Christina dropped a major clue when she updated her last name to Hall on her real estate license and her Instagram account! That‚Äôs right, her name is now Christina Hall.\n\nChristina and the real estate agent started dating last summer, and she opened up about their incredible connection in an Instagram post in July.\n\nChristina Haack Says Smoking a Bufo Toad Helped Reset Her Brain Before She Met Josh Hall\n\nView Story\n\n‚ÄúWhen we met this past spring, the synchronicities hit us so hard and fast they were impossible to ignore,‚Äù the 38-year-old wrote. ‚ÄúI felt immediately crazy protective over him and wanted to keep him for myself and get to know each other before the tornado (media attention) hit.‚Äù\n\nThe HGTV star went on, ‚ÄúWe‚Äôve had a few solid months of just us getting to know each other and I‚Äôve loved every second of it. So called ‚Äòfame‚Äô provides so many things but it comes with a cost. They build you up then tear you down.‚Äù\n\nBy September they were engaged. She confirmed the news with photos of the two enjoying a vacation at the Montage Los Cabos. She captioned the pic with several emojis, including an engagement ring emoji.\n\nChristina was previously married to Ant Anstead, and they share son Hudson, 2. Before that, she was married to Tarek El Moussa, and they have daughter Taylor, 11, and son Brayden, 6.\n\nIn fact, Christina and Tarek‚Äôs longtime HGTV show ‚ÄúFlip or Flop‚Äù just ended after 10 seasons.\n\nGetty\n\nWhy Tarek El Moussa & Christina Haack Are Reportedly Ending ‚ÄòFlip or Flop‚Äô\n\nView Story\n\nEl Moussa marked the series finale with a special Instagram message and shout-out to his ex-wife.\n\nThe exes were married from 2009-2018, co-hosting the show from 2013 through the final episode, which aired in March.\n\nTarek, 40, posted a carousel of throwback photos to commemorate the ending of the home renovation show, and reminisced about his journey.\n\n‚ÄúI can‚Äôt believe this journey started in May 2010 with a home video and a dream of flipping houses on tv‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs crazy to think 12 years later it‚Äôs coming to an end. I‚Äôve spent almost a third of my life committed to this show,‚Äù he said.\n\nEl Moussa later added, ‚ÄúA special thank you to @christinahaack for taking this journey with me. I think we did a pretty good job and I‚Äôm excited for what the future holds for both us and wish her nothing but the best! I would say I‚Äôm going to miss you guys but. I‚Äôm not going anywhereüòé. I can‚Äôt wait to show you what comes next!‚Äù"
