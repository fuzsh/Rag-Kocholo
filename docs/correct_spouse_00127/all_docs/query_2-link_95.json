        "text": "Christina Rouner\n\nActress\n\nI was born in Banglaore, India and moved home to this country when I was five. I grew up outside of Boston, riding horses and doing plays. I am the youngest of four and the only girl. When I was 14 one of my brothers died in a climbing accident in Alaska. That was a very formative event in my childhood. After high school I went to Yale as an undergraduate and majored in Medieval History. I lived in Paris for a year and a half during that time, working on a thesis and studying at the Sorbonne. Upon my return to Yale I met Athol Fugard who completely changed my idea of what I wanted to do with my life. I then went to Juilliard for drama school and have been living in New York ever since. I met my husband, Matthew Greer, while doing a production of Cymbelline. We were married in 2001 and now have two children, Miranda(12) and Spencer(8).\n\nI Dream Too Much is proudly sponsored by the Pantheon of Women."
