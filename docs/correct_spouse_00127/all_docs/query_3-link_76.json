        "text": "In case you woke up this morning suddenly curious about Christina Aguilera’s personal life, say hello to Matthew Rutler. Christina and Matthew have been together for well over a decade and met all the way back in 2009 on the set of Burlesque. You know how the story goes: He was a production assistant. She was a genie in a bottle. The rest is history. Christina has been in a committed relationship with Matthew ever since, and their vibes have remained adorable throughout. Like, try not to tear up at this video, just TRY.\n\nSo who is the man who captured Xtina’s heart? Some facts:\n\nHe’s an Executive at MasterClass\n\nGonna go ahead and assume he’s the person we can thank for getting Kris Jenner to spill her secrets (The Kardashians viewers know what I’m talking about). It’s unclear exactly what Matthew does in his role as executive other than make a ton of important decisions, but here he is celebrating MasterClass getting an Emmy nomination:\n\nP.S. Prior to MasterClass, Matthew (who is from New Jersey, for those wondering) did production assistant work on huge movies like The Proposal, The Social Network, and Something Borrowed.\n\nHe’s Obsessed With Xtina\n\nI mean, who isn’t? But this section is mostly an excuse for me to inundate you with a bunch of adorable Instagram posts from Matthew, so get ready:\n\nThey Started Dating Shortly After Her Divorce\n\nChristina filed for divorce from her then-husband Jordan Bratman in October 2010, and in December, she opened up to People about her relationship with Matthew, saying, “Matthew is a special person. We had a really strong friendship on the movie. He’s the kind of person you could spend hours on the phone talking to and all of a sudden it’s daylight. Once I filed for divorce, we started dating. I’m not trying to jump into anything. I just left a five-year marriage. I’m taking it slow and trying to be happy.”\n\nShe added that she’s in love, saying, “There’s a love there, yes. I’m having fun, I’m dating, and it’s something I haven’t had in a really long time.”\n\nHe Proposed on Valentine’s Day\n\nThe year? 2014. The social media vibe? Posting photos of your ring on Twitter, apparently!\n\nAnd speaking of Valentine’s Day, please take a moment to watch this gem from 2021. These two are clearly still so in love more than a decade later.\n\nAnd yes, their 2022 Valentine’s Day vibes were also impeccable:\n\nThey Have a Cute Daughter\n\nIn addition to Christina’s son Max, whom she shares with Jordan, she and Matthew have a daughter named Summer Rain. TBD if she’s friends with Stormi and other weather-adjacent celebrity babies.\n\nHe and Christina Are Still Engaged\n\nIt’s been almost a decade, but these two have yet to tie the knot—at least based on Matthew’s Instagram bio, which currently says, “Happily engaged.”\n\nBack in 2015, Xtina said she and Matthew aren’t in a rush to get married, explaining, “Having just moved into a beautiful new home we call the Sanctuary, having a baby, and now being excited to get back to work, I have my hands full and am not in a rush to set a date. I want to plan it and cherish the moment while not feeling rushed. So when the schedule is more clear and I can take some downtime again, I can focus on that. Our love is secure enough that we don’t need a wedding to prove our love and commitment.”\n\nOn that note, I’ll leave you with this:"
