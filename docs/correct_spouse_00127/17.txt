Singer Christina Milian's marriage to Grammy-winning producer The-Dream is over after just 10 months, his spokesperson has confirmed.

It comes just five months after the pair welcomed their first child, Violet Madison Nash.

The split was announced after photos surfaced of The-Dream - real name, Terius Hagert Youngdell Nash - holidaying with a mystery brunette.

The two were seen flirtatiously frolicking in the Caribbean surf.

In a cryptic message on her Twitter page yesterday, AM to PM singer Milian, 28, wrote: 'Whatever you think... believe it.'

It has also been claimed that the pair's marriage actually ended late last year, but they decided to keep it private to protect their daughter, who was born on February 26.

A spokesperson for the The-Dream, 29, told Us Weekly yesterday: 'They ask for consideration and respect for their family moving forward.'

The pair married in Las Vegas in September 2009 just weeks before announcing her pregnancy.

The-Dream, who co-wrote and co-produced Beyonce's hit song, Single Ladies, also has three children with ex-wife Nivea.

Milian started dating The-Dream in March 2009 - a month after ending her three year relationship with producer Andre Lyon.

She also had a high-profile two year romance with Mariah Carey's now-husband Nick Cannon, but it ended in 2005 after she accused him of cheating on her.
