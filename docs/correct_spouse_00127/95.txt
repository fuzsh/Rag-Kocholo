A judge has finalized singer Christina Milian’s divorce from singer-songwriter-producer The-Dream.

Milian’s attorney Randy Kessler said Monday that the judge in Atlanta signed the final paperwork this month.

Milian and The-Dream, whose real name is Terius Nash, were married in 2009 and separated in July 2010. The two have an infant daughter together.

Kessler said the divorce was resolved by mutual agreement.

Milian is best known for songs such as “Dip it Low.” The-Dream, whose hits include “Shawty is a 10,” has produced for artists including Mariah Carey, Rihanna and Britney Spears; he won two Grammys for his work on Beyonce’s “Single Ladies (Put A Ring on It).”
