Singer Christina Milian and singer/producer The Dream (real name Terius Hagert Youngdell Nash) got married at The Little White Chapel on the Las Vegas strip – the same venue where Britney Spears wed Jason Alexander in 2004.

According to their marriage license, the two were pronounced man and wife at midnight Friday, reports say. The Dream has been working on Milian's new album entitled Elope.

In July this year, Christina Milian confirmed that she and The Dream got engaged after dating for quite some time. At the time, she said she had not yet had wedding plans. "We don't have plans yet – but it hasn't [already] happened, that I can confirm," she said. "We just want to have our closest friends and family there; it's not going to be too big." There have been rumours that Milian is expecting but the couple have yet to confirm.

This is the second marriage for Dream, who was divorced R&B singer Nivea in 2007, and the first for Milian.

Do you think their marriage will last?
