Christina Milian’s brief marriage to music producer Terius “The-Dream” Nash was by no means, well, dreamy, and now she’s ready to dish the dirty details.

“I’ve been to hell and back, but I survived,” the singer, 29, tells the February issue of Latina of their messy split, which went public in July when the producer was photographed nuzzling his assistant in the Carribean.

Although he filed for divorce in February (days before she gave birth to their daughter Violet) she has insisted they continued to have marital relations.

“I tried to be someone I wasn’t because I wanted my marriage to work,” she tells the mag. “But ultimately, if it’s not working, it’s not working.”

As for the cheating scandal she admits, “I didn’t know anything. But looking back, my gut was telling me something was off. But I thought I could fix it.”

Now Milian, who says motherhood makes her “feel so much sexier than ever before,” is moving on and excited for what’s next.
