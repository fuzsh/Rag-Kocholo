Pop songstress Christina Milian is holding nothing back when talking about her brief marriage to producer Terius “The-Dream” Nash. In a cover story for Latina Magazine, Milian describes her messy divorce from the The-Dream as “going to hell and back.”

“I survived,” says the mom of 10-month-old baby Violet. As for her ex-husband’s cheating ways, the pint-sized singer says her intuition had been telling her something was going on all along.
