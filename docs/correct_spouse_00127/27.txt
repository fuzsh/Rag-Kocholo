Christina Milian wrote an e-mail to her ex-husband The-Dream’s mistress.

The mistress, named Melissa Santiago, used to be Christina’s friend, but began a relationship with The-Dream while he was still married.

In the e-mails back and forth, Milian mentions that Santiago’s actions we’re inappropriate and that she and Dream were still working on their broken marriage.

Santiago’s e-mail back details that Milian should have paid as much attention to her husband as she did to the photos that surfaced of them on the beach.
