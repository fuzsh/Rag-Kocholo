The Summer House. The summer house in which Long Day’s Journey into Night takes place still stands in New London, Connecticut. Owned by the Eugene O’Neill Theater Center, the house is decorated exactly as specified in the play.

Loss. Within a three-year period, all of O’Neill’s family members died. First, his father succumbed to a longstanding illness. Shortly thereafter, his mother died of a brain tumor (after eight years of sobriety). Having a hard time coping with these losses, his brother, Jamie, drank himself to death.
