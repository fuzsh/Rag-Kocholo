        "text": "A PENSIONER who was found dead inside an Edinburgh home has been pictured for the first time.\n\nMargaret Parker, 78, died following an alleged disturbance inside a house in Fernieside Crescent in Edinburgh.\n\nShe was pronounced dead at the scene.\n\nCops have confirmed a 36-year-old man has been arrested and charged in connection with her death.\n\nHe has also been charged in relation to the attempted murder of a 55-year-old woman and a 42-year-old woman during the same alleged disturbance.\n\nThe man is due to appear at Edinburgh Sheriff Court tomorrow.\n\nPolice Scotland are still probing the alleged incident.\n\nDetective Inspector Dougal Begg said: “Our thoughts are with the family and friends of Margaret Parker and everyone affected by this tragic incident.\n\n\"A continued police presence can be seen in the area as officers continue their enquiries into this isolated incident.”\n\nWe told how locals feared they'd heard gunfire as multiple loud bangs - believed to be a police tactical device - were captured on a Ring doorbell after armed cops swarmed the street at 8.25am.\n\nPolice confirmed that a woman was pronounced dead at the scene and a younger man had been arrested.\n\nMore than 20 emergency services vehicles swarmed the site, according to locals.\n\nAnd one resident caught the terrifying moment on their Ring doorbell camera.\n\nIn the footage, an officer can be seen walking through a garden before five bangs were heard.\n\nA few seconds later, a further six were recorded.\n\nPIRC has confirmed that it is assessing a referral in relation to an incident involving the death of Ms Parker.\n\nA PIRC spokesperson said: “The Police Investigations and Review Commissioner is currently assessing a referral from Police Scotland in relation to an incident involving the death of a 78-year-old woman in Edinburgh on 21 May 2024.”"
