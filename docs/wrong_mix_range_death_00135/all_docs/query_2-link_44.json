        "text": "The Story of Greyfriars Bobby\n\nThe best-known version of the story is that Bobby belonged to John Gray, Constable No 90 for the Edinburgh City Police. As a night watchman, Mr Gray was required to have a watch dog. He chose a Skye Terrier, who he called ‘Bobby’. After all he was a police dog!\n\nIn October 1857, the nights were cold and wet. Despite the autumn chill, Mr Gray and his faithful companion would patrol the streets of Edinburgh to keep the peace. During their chilling escapades, Mr Gray developed a nasty cough, which would later develop into Tuberculosis. As Mr Gray continued to get weaker and his health failed, Bobby remained by his side until his dying day."
