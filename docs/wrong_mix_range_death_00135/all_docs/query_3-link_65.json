        "text": "A CurtainUp Feature: Playwrights Album\n\nAn Overview of Eugene O'Neill's Career\n\nBy Elyse Sommer\n\nTopics Covered\n\nPersonal Statistics\n\nChronology of Produced Plays\n\nHonored Plays\n\nTrademarks Of Oneill's Plays\n\nLinks To Reviews & Books\n\nQuotes\n\nPersonal Statistics\n\nThere's a tendency to link famous people with an all-encompassing descriptive tag line. The tag most often given to Eugene (Gladstone) O'Neill is \"father of modern American playwriting.\" His claim to that tag stems from his being the first playwright to lend a serious and distinctive voice to contemporary themes and dramatize them against a background of twentieth Century America.\n\nEugene was the third son of an actor best known for touring in the melodrama, The Count of Monte Christo. Born on October 16, 1888 in a Broadway hotel (the Barrett House, which now houses a Starbucks but still features a plaque with his birth date next to the entrance) O'Neill seemed destined to be involved with the theater. He did in fact tour twice with his father's company, once as a stage manager and another time as a bit player, but this was not a case of a son proudly following in his father's footsteps. Young O'Neill hardly looked upon his father as a role model and family life generally was desperately unhappy and it was this unhappiness that fed the autobiographical aspects of his plays. The other great influence on his career stemmed from the three years following his brief stint at Princeton during which he worked as a seaman and roamed around Europe and South America. It was these experiences that seeded his dark sea dramas, notably Anna Christie.\n\nIt was at the end of these roving years and after a bout of tuberculosiss that O'Neill began writing seriously and playwriting, as the New York critic Brooks Atkinson put it became \"not so much his profession as his obsession.\" This \"obsessive\" intensity made his later family relations as fraught with problems as his earlier years. His first two wives and his children fell victim to his self-absorbed determination to let noone interfere with his writing. It was this same temperament, of course, which gave his plays their powerful emotions.\n\nO'Neill's career was well nourished from the start. Until his first Broadway play in 1920, (also first of four Pulitzers) Beyond the Horizon, his plays were produced to considerable acclaim at the Wharf Theater in Provincetown, MA and the Provincetown Playhouse in New York's Greenwich Village. Interestingly, he began with one-act plays and later became known for marathon-length works that required audiences to arrive late in the afternoon and return after a dinner break. Besides the three additional Pulitzers-- for Anna Christie (1922), Strange Interlude (1928) and Long Day's Journey Into Night (1958) -- O'Neill also won the Nobel Prize for Literature in 1936 as well as numerous other honors -- including having a theater named in his honor.\n\nUntil The Emperor Jones no American playwright had ever written a play with a major role for a black actor. The same kind of groundbreaking applies to All God's Chillun Got Wings with its integrated marriage plot.\n\nThe two other American drama greats who walk in O'Neill's footsteps are Arthur Miller and Tennessee Williams (see link to our Playwrights' Album below). His own theatrical forbear was a European playwright, August Strindberg.\n\nIn 1953, Eugene O'Neill succumbed to Parkinson's Disease. The curtain went down as it rose -- in a hotel. As is evident from the number of plays reviewed at CurtainUp during recent seasons, those who dismissed O'Neill's work as irrelevant to contemporary tastes were more than a little premature. In fact, there seems to be quite an O'Neill revival and our list is by no means complete.\n\nO'Neill's works were for several decades most closely linked to a triumvirate of theatrical talents. Two were actors -- Jason Robards and Colleen Dewhurst. One was a director, Jose Quintero whose own unhappy family history made him identify strongly with O'Neill whom he exalted.\n\nHis first two marriages to Kathleen Jenkins and Agnes Boulton (mother of Shane and Oona who married Charlie Chaplin) ended in divorce. His 1929 marriage to Carolotta Montgomery lasted until his death in 1953. Back to the top\n\nHonored Plays\n\nBesides winning the Nobel prize for literature,O'Neill won an unprecedented four Pulitzers: The first was in 1920 for Beyond the Horizon, just two years after the prize's initiation. He won the Pulitzer again in 1922 for Anna Christie, in 1928 for Strange Interlude, and posthumously in 1957 for Long Day's Journey Into Night.\n\nChronology of Produced Plays\n\n1916 and 1920 Provincetown Playhouse productions: Bound East for Cardiff, Thirst, Before Breakfast, Fog, The Sniper In the Zone, The Long Voyage Home, Ile, The Rope, Where the Cross Is Made, The Moon of the Carribbees, The Dream Kid, Exorcism. 1920. Beyond the Horizon, Morosco Theater. NYC.\n\n1920. Emperor Jones. Selwin Theater, NYC (a transfer uptown from the Provincetown Playhouse).\n\n1921. Anna Christie, Vanderbilt Theater, NYC. 1920-1928. O'Neill's plays continued to be produced downtown at the Provincetown Playhouse and the Greenwich Village Theater. They included: Exorcism, Diff'rent, The Straw, The First Man, The Hairy Ape, Welded, The Ancient Mariner-A Dramatic Arrangement of Coleridge's Poems, All God's Chillun Got Wings, S.S. Glencairn, Desire Under the Elms, The Fountain, The Good God Brown. 1928. Marco's Millions. The Guild Theatre. 1928. Strange Interlude. John Golden Theatre, NYC. 1928. Lazarus Laughed, Community Playhouse, Pasadena, CA. 1929. Dynamo, Martin Beck, NYC. 1928. Mourning Becomes Electra, Guild Theatre, NYC. 1933. Ah, Wilderness! Guild Theatre, NYC (note: O'Neill's only comedy and often thought to be the fantasy version of the Tyrones of Long Day's Journey Into Night ). 1934. Days Without End, Henry Miller Theater, NYC. 1946. The Iceman Cometh, Martin Beck, NYC. Jason Robards' interpretation of the quintessential pipe dreamer, Hickey, (directed by the director Jose Quintero who exalted O'Neill) was long considered without match. However, in 1998 Kevin Spacey brought new luster to the role in London. He won an Olivier award, increasing the buzz preceding the play's transfer to Broadway in April 1999. The play's essential plot first surfaced in a short story called \"Tomorrow\" in the June 1917 issue of the magazine Seven Arts -- twenty-two years before O'Neill wrote the play and and thirty years before its Broadway premiere.\n\n1947. A Moon for the Misbegotten, Harman Theatre, Columbus Ohio (and in 1956 at the Bijou, NYC. 1956. Long Day's Journey Into Night, Helen Hayes, NYC (premiered in Stockholm). 1957. A Touch of the Poet, Helen Hayes, NYC. (premiered in Stockholm). 1964. Hughie, Royale, NYC, (premiered in Stockholm in 1958). 1967. More Stately Mansions (premiered in Stockholm in 1962).\n\nBack to the top\n\nTrademarks Of O'Neill's Plays\n\nO'Neill's earliest works especially dramatized the individual's vulnerability in the face of destiny. In his sea plays this is symbolized by his characters' enslavement to the sea Another recurring theme centers on the destructive effect of denying of one's talents. Beyond the Horizon and A Touch of the Poet are prime examples. Except for his one comedy, Ah, Wilderness, O'Neill's plays are filled with gloom. His characters are invariably caught up in the grip of the struggle and suffering that make up the tragedies of every day life.\n\nBack to Top\n\nLinks To Plays By and About O'Neill and Books you Might Want to Read\n\nPlays\n\nAh, Wilderness!

They're done before you realize it, and once they're done they make you do other things until at last everything comes between you and what you'd like to be, and you've lost your true self forever.\n\n--- Mary Tyrone in Long Day's Journey Into Night.\n\nIt was a great mistake my being born a man. I would have been much more successful as a sea-gull or a fish. As it is, I will always ge a stranger who never feels at whome, who does not really want is not really wanted, who can never belong, who must always be a little in love with death!\n\n--- Edmund, the youngest Tyrone son and the playwright's alter ego, in Long Day's Journey Into Night.\n\nWell, spring isn't everything, is it, Essie?
