        "text": "You might associate beheading machines with the guillotine, made famous during the French Revolution. But the Scots invented another solution for mechanised beheading over 200 years earlier: The Maiden. You can see this fearsome object on permanent display in the Kingdom of the Scots gallery at the National Museum of Scotland.\n\nBetween 1564 and 1710 the Maiden was used to publicly behead over 150 criminals and political opponents of the crown.\n\nBefore 1564, beheading was usually done by axe or sword in Scotland, but this could be messy. An executioner would sometimes need several attempts before he was able to successfully sever head from body. Beheading machines were more efficient in this respect, but they also must have made these executions look more modern and awe-inspiring to the public attending these spectacles.\n\nExecutions took place in large open spaces. A platform was built for each execution so that people could see the Maiden more easily. Large crowds turned up to see others being punished for their crimes.\n\nExecutions using the Maiden are known to have taken place in Castlehill, Grassmarket and High Cross off the High Street in Edinburgh, just minutes from the site where the National Museum of Scotland now stands.\n\nThe condemned from all parts of Scotland were brought to Edinburgh to be executed. The records of the Judiciary Court of the time document various crimes that might result in a Maiden-aided beheading: these include murder, incest, stealing, treason, adultery, forgery and robbery.\n\nIronically, the person believed to have introduced the idea for a beheading machine to Scotland – James Douglas – was himself executed on 2 June 1581 by the Maiden. An extract from the records of the Scottish Judiciary at the time records his execution.\n\nJames Douglas, 4th Earl of Morton, ruled Scotland from 1572 to 1578 during the minority of James VI. He worked hard to maintain a friendship with England, dealing ruthlessly with Mary, Queen of Scots' supporters.\n\nHe was implicated in the murder of Mary's second husband, Lord Darnley, but wasn’t arrested until 1580 – 13 years after Darnley's death. His trial took place at Edinburgh's Tolbooth on 1 June 1581. The jury consisted mainly of Morton's enemies, including Lord Oglivie, who had previously been imprisoned by Morton.\n\nUnsurprisingly, Morton was found guilty and sentenced to be hanged. However, King James VI intervened and ordered execution by the Maiden."
