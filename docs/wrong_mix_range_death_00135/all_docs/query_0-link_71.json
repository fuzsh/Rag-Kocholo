        "text": "ADRIAN DEANE is FESTE in TWELFTH NIGHT at MARIN SHAKES\n\nThe 2023 Summer Season at Marin Shakespeare Company closes with TWELFTH NIGHT\n\nAdapted and Directed by Bridgette Loriaux\n\nAdrian Deane as Feste transports us into an almost otherworldly setting with her wit, shimmering presence, and almost magical control of any situation.\n\n-Jarion Monroe\n\nAlso outstanding is Deane’s Feste. Deane plays the fool with sensitivity and depth. Her remarkable talent for song and dance elevates an already excellent performance.\n\n—Beulah F. Vega, PacificSun\n\nAdrian Deane is a sober Feste the jester, fretful and compassionate, here made Viola’s confidante in lieu of one of the several minor characters cut out of this adaptation. Deane’s Feste also sings some powerful renditions of the play’s songs, in keeping with the melancholy vibe of David Warner’s haunting music.\n\n— Marin IJ, Sam Hurwitt\n\nAnd Adrian Deane’s gentle Feste is also delightful.\n\nThe amazing thing about Twelfth Night, I think, is the extraordinary growth arc experienced by each and every character, and, in this production, this is abundantly clear.\n\n—Charles Kruger, Theatrestorm\n\nAnother thrill of the show, which I saw Sunday, Aug. 13, at Forest Meadows Amphitheatre, is Bridgette Loriaux’s direction.\n\nIf eros is everywhere in Illyria, so is meanness. Director Loriaux is wise enough to let those two sit side by side without needing to resolve them. Some on the isle can walk off into the sunset hand in hand with their lovers; others can only look downward, legs dangling off the lip of the stage. But even for them, life isn’t over; there are many nights yet after the twelfth.\n\n— Lily Janiack, SF Chronicle\n\nO'Neill Staged Reading of \"The First Man\"\n\nLittle Known O’Neill Plays Continue to Receive Staged Attention at Danville’s Eugene O’Neill Foundation\n\nAdrian Deane as Lily\n\nThe Eugene O’Neill Foundation, Tao House presents a script-in-hand performance of O’Neill’s The First Man, directed by Eric Fraisher Hayes\n\nEugene O’Neill loved and hated many things in his life. New London, CT, the only “home” he knew growing up was no different. While the town provided him with a measure of security and sense of community, he clearly outgrew its puritan pretensions. In his play The First Man, he imagines himself an anthropologist who has traveled the world only to land back in the provincial town he grew up in. Scandals and intrigues lead to a showdown with his family and the community when an unexpected pregnancy unleashes a flurry of speculation and family members are forced to choose sides.\n\nDon’t miss your chance to see this rarely-produced O’Neill play this January.\n\nJanuary 13 @ 7:30 pm - 9:30 pm\n\nJanuary 14 @ 7:30 pm - 9:30 pm | With Dramaturgical Presentation by Beth Wynstra\n\nJanuary 15 @ 2:00 pm - 4:00 pm Matinee\n\nThe Museum of the San Ramon Valley 205 Railroad Ave., Danville, CA 94526\n\nSat., Jan. 14, 4:00 pm — Dramaturg Beth Wynstra gives a free presentation: “Survival of the Fittest: Eugene O’Neill’s The First Man and the Forces of Environment and Expectations,” Enjoy a great dinner after in downtown Danville and then come back and see a show! In her talk, Beth will explore the cultural context of O’Neill’s The First Man. Specifically, she will detail the powerful sway that societal norms for etiquette, marital roles, and family life had in early 20th-century America and the America of today. Culture and Culinary come together this January 14. Join us!\n\nExodus to Eden with Oakland Theatre Project (Early 2023)\n\nCo-Artistic Director Michael Moran brings Original Screenplay, Exodus to Eden, to life with Oakland Theater Project:\n\nAdrian Deane as Elisa\n\nFEB 3–26\n\nTHU / FRI / SAT / SUN\n\n7:30 PM\n\nPreviews: Fri, Feb 3 & Sat Feb 4 at 7:30 p.m.\n\nOpening Night: Sun, Feb 5 at 7:30 p.m\n\nThis contemporary epic, created specifically for Oakland Theater Project Company Members and artists, follows the journey of an exiled people across America, through environmental devastation and into their dreams. From a dispossessed family searching for a lost future, to The Man, to Angels, to a girl named Edén, this production features an unforgettable cast of characters and an ensemble of 17.\n\nInspired by The Grapes of Wrath, the Book of Exodus, and the company members of OTP, Exodus to Eden is set in a time after history ends, and before history begins again.\n\nSeeking hope in an era that feels often hopeless, the tale asks: What do we worship in America today? Can we change it? If so, what could we change it to that would renew our world?\n\nEugene O'Neill International Festival Oct. 13-16th, 2022\n\nAdrian Deane with the cast of WELDED at the Eugene O’Neill International Festival at St. Michael’s Church in New Ross, Ireland.\n\nHigh Praise for Deane from the New Ross Standard, and Project Muse, respectively:\n\nThough it has rarely been performed, it was very well received. US actress Adrian Deane was outstanding in the lead female role of Eleanor Cape.\n\n— New Ross Standard, David Loopy\n\nAnd what a part it is, requiring Eleanor to spin through a kaleidoscope of emotions at a dizzying pace. In lesser hands the dialogue could certainly seem “overwrought.” Indeed, during rehearsals of the premiere, Doris Keane pleaded with director Stark Young to let her withdraw from the play, saying she could not act the role (see Gelbs, 234). Deane, however, was up to the task.\n\nWhile hurdling through the scale of emotions at the breakneck pace the text requires, she struck each note resonantly and made the abrupt and extreme changes in pitch seem the inevitable results of her character and circumstance.\n\n— Daniel McGovern, Project Muse | Penn State University Press | Volume 43, Number 2, 2022 | pp. 224-226\n\nBy invitation, to open for the Eugene O’Neill International Festival | October 13th - 16th, 2022\n\nAfter a run with the Danville foundation, Eric F. Hayes takes WELDED to Sister-Theater St. Michaels in New Ross, Ireland.\n\nSource: https://www.independent.ie/regionals/wexford/lifestyle/eugene-oneill-festival-in-new-ross-is-an-outstanding-success-42076866.html\n\nNYC World Premier of 2 1/2 BREATHS\n\nFor the World Premier off-off-Broadway at The Chain Theater in Midtown Manhattan\n\nLoriaux House of the Arts presents:\n\nAdrian Deane and Ed Gonzalez Moreno in “2 1/2 BREATHS”\n\nThe Chain Theater, May 2022\n\nWritten and Directed by Bridgette Loriaux\n\nThis is the story of Aidan and Diana. A brief look into their mystical life, their devotion, and the quiet conversations we have with ourselves when no one is listening…or at least when we think no one is listening. What is our capacity to love? Do the relationships we build and the people we hold on ever so tightly to; transcend this material and sometimes brutal, unforgiving world? How do we grieve alone and how do we endure pain and loss physically, mentally, and emotionally when there are no more words? When there is nothing else to say? Come with us and take a choreographic expedition as we embrace, catch, and fall through worlds of time, space, and ecstasies to examine the resilience of our love and the human condition.\n\nAnd then some Discoveries of O'Neill\n\nAfter a lifetime (give or take) of ignorance, Deane has been gifted three back-to-back learning opportunities to discover America’s Pulitzer Prize Playwright, Eugene O’Neill.\n\nIt starts with Anna:\n\nAnna Christie\n\n‘Ghosts’ monologues were produced in Winter of 2021 and filmed for availability online\n\nGHOSTS OF TAO HOUSE\n\nmonologues from O’Neill classics\n\nBy Eugene O’Neill\n\nDirected by Eric F.

Jock-a-mo centers around the complexities of music appropriation, the intersectionality of racial and sexual oppression, and the generational divide.\n\nCASTING UPDATES through September 2020\n\nBLACK COMEDY, CORDELIA, AND JIMMY DEAN’S LOST MOTHER:\n\nCurrent Production and Future Casting Announcements!\n\nADRIAN DEANE is CLEA, the Mischievous Ex-Girlfriend, in Peter Shaffer’s BLACK COMEDY, at Douglas Morrisson Theatre in Hayward (Feb. 21st through Mar. 8th):\n\nADRIAN DEANE is CORDELIA, the Youngest Lear Sister in Matthew Well’s take on the moments immediately preceding the opening of Shakespeare’s KING LEAR, in QUEEN MAIR, at Central Works in Berkeley (May 9th through June 7th):\n\nADRIAN DEANE is MONA, in Ed Gaczyk’s COME BACK TO THE FIVE AND DIME, JIMMY DEAN, JIMMY DEAN, at Altarena Playhouse in Alameda (Aug 14th through Sep. 13th):\n\nCostuming by Kathleen Qiu\n\nBay Area Favorite, Kathleen Qiu, Adds to Her Design, Technique, Construction Portfolio:\n\nwith Photography by Sean Hung\n\nPHYSICS AND PIDOR -- Staged Readings of Two New Works\n\nCUTTING BALL THEATER’S VARIETY PACK PRESENTS:\n\nPIDOR AND THE WOLF\n\nBY SAM MAX / DIRECTED BY SUSANNAH MARTIN / CUTTING BALL THEATER\n\nFollowing her work in last year’s Variety Pack' SHORTCUTS (images below of Artaud’s SPURT OF BLOOD, directed by Artistic Director, Ariel Craft), Adrian Deane plays Peter’s Wife in the staged reading of Sam Max’s symphonic full-length PIDOR AND THE WOLF.\n\nPIDOR and the Wolf is a full-length play with music.

So perfectly do they inhabit and distinguish each specific character, that it is sometimes difficult to believe that there are only two actors onstage. Particular highlights include cross-gender cast examples such as Keane’s frat boy-aping Sebastian and Doyle’s imperious Olivia. I also commend Doyle’s British accents, which are some of the best I’ve ever heard from an American actor, to the extent that I was completely unsure of his native dialect until he thanked the audience at the end of the show.”\n\n“These interpolations and Shakespop mash-ups enhance the production’s irreverent tone and make it one of the most accessible Shakespeare productions at the Fringe.”\n\n“It must also be said that the plot, despite being conveyed by just two actors, is incredibly clear and well conveyed to the audience. There are moments when the comedy is stripped away and Keane & Doyle demonstrate their dramatic chops. For instance, during Keane’s delivery of Viola’s speech in Act 2 Scene 3 which concludes with her reply to Duke Orsino that she is ‘all the daughters of [her] father’s house’, there was a palpable, awestruck silence in the theatre, as Keane delivered the lines with beautiful sincerity and a clear, naturalistic tone. The best productions of Shakespeare’s comedies are those which recognise the need to lean into those serious moments of shade amidst the raucous light and 2Elfth Night is a perfect example of this.”\n\n“I would compel you to catch them at your earliest convenience and look out for their brilliant work. This is a company operating in the true, vaudevillian spirit of Monty Python, the Reduced Shakespeare Company and the National Theatre of Brent and their work presents Shakespeare as the playwright himself would surely have intended: fast, direct, involving and moving.”\n\nChristopher Gaunt The Wee Review — FOUR STARS:\n\n“They change characters seamlessly, using new voices, different mannerisms, and as-slick-as-possible costume changes. However, during all of this absurdity, they still keep to much of the same dialogue as the piece from which the story derives. Thus allowing for both Shakespeare novices, as well as frequent visitors’ of the Globe Theatre in London, to find joy in the production.”\n\n“The play finds a nice balance between interacting with the audience and showcasing the pair’s natural character acting and physical comedy. […] The joy and energy the pair bring to the performance provide the most delight for the audience. They seem to be having genuine fun telling this absurd rendition of a timeless story, whilst also giving it the grace it deserves, and ultimately providing laughter and smiles to everyone lucky enough to attend.”\n\nElaine Chapman Freelance Review — FOUR STARS\n\nNatalie HolmanThree Weeks Edinburgh — FOUR STARS:\n\n“Despite all the fun kerfuffle onstage, they do actually portray Shakespeare’s classic clearly and succinctly. ‘2Elfth Night’ is an enjoyable, comedic and engaging production suitable for all ages.”\n\nJasper Cresdee-Hyde Binge Fringe — FOUR STARS:\n\n“The interplay and chemistry between Keane and Doyle is tremendously fun; sure, they’re an established duo by this point, having been performing together since January 2017, but strong interactions aren’t necessarily a guarantee at the Fringe.”\n\n“Indeed, each are accomplished actors in their own right, weaving between a wide variety of characters effortlessly while being funny in the process.”\n\nTweet-Sized Reviews — FOUR STARS:\n\n“12th night by 2 people in an hour, feat. Audience participation, possibly recognisable tunes, several cups of water and of course, stripy yellow socks. Fast paced without losing the sweeter beats of the play, highly entertaining & worth a look!”\n\nBeth Hayward:\n\nWhat’s the recipe for a tasty Twelfth Night?\n\nTake a pair of clowns\n\nAdd various volunteer members of the audience.\n\nSprinkle with some silly props & costumes.\n\nLet simmer for an hour\n\nThen serve up the perfect Shakespeare comedy.\n\nGloriously inventive, gentle & funny. What a sweet treat to finish off my Edinburgh Fringe Fest FEAST!\n\nJo Walton:\n\nThis is just flat out hilarious. If you like Shakespeare's comedies at all, you should see this duo doing all the parts and still making everything work. A very judicious cut, some excellent acting and timing and audience participation.\n\nThomas N:\n\nIn a small room with barely 20 members of the audience, the acting duo flying through Twelfth Night at a breakneck pace populated it with a dozen characters, a whirlwind of flasks and wigs, and a charming stage manager. A hilarious show at a surprisingly low price\n\nAda Palmer:\n\nDelightful edit of the classic play, hilarious throughout and touching at the moments the story should be touching. Both performers showed virtuosity bringing so many different characters to life, and the direct engagement with the audience was warm and brilliantly coordinated. It can be hard editing a long play down to a Fringe-length cut, but this abridgment was expertly and prudently done, keeping all the treasured moments and making the story easy to follow even if one didn't know the play, but richer if one did. Delightful for Shakespeare buffs and novices alike!\n\nJack Clifford:\n\nThis was a really fantastic and fun way to spend our evening, the 2 man cast carry off all the characters incredibly well. Very energetic, exuberant and hilarious. Would thoroughly recommend.\n\nKatie Paterson:\n\nThe most fun I’ve ever had watching Twelfth Night. Expertly navigating the small space and the willing audience, Keane and Doyle rocket through characters, impressive verse speaking and hilarious characters, telling the story with wit and flair and a surprising amount of heart. Absolutely unmissable, and a treat for everyone whether they’ve seen the ‘unabridged’ version or not.\n\nDebbie Cannon:\n\nA simply wonderful, joyous hour. It takes real skill and talent (and energy) to make an hour of hilarious apparent chaos work, and these two performers have those in bucket-loads, holding everything lightly but tightly together. They take great care of their audience too, even while they’re carrying us along on their rollercoaster ride. I doff my pirate hat to them - they’re brilliant!\n\nEveryone in the audience was beaming with delight within minutes of the show starting. This is perfect Fringe theatre - go see!\n\nJoseph Ryan:\n\nNimble, adroit, heartening, and supremely inviting. The original play is well-rendered, whilst the performers' diligent pains to do so in no way dilute their own quirky verve. A simply lovely show.\n\nGiles Clifford:\n\nFantastic show - performers who just know instinctively how to use those words to create true comedy without losing their beauty. Hectic and mad and a treat to see. Do go to see it.\n\nChelsey-leigh Sutton:\n\nBrilliant. Witty. Smart and funny! I absolutely loved every minuet of this Shakespearean classic with a twist. Fantastic comedy duo!\n\nMax Silver:\n\nThese two performers are top class entertainers and comedians! If you are reading this whatever you do watch this show, you will regret not seeing this hilarious and joyful multi-roling extravaganza! I was in stitches from start to end and that is a very rare thing! Best show of the fringe so far.\n\nHolly Fairall:\n\nAbsolutely LOVED! Fantastic performers, best show I have seen at the Fringe this year!\n\nJoshua Kelly:\n\nAbsolutely fantastic, I thought I was going to disrupt the show from laughing too hard!\n\nBrightside Comedy:\n\nThese two are seriously hilarious, so much so that at one point our director was reduced to tears. One of the most enjoyable experiences we've had as a company this year at the fringe!\n\nHelen:\n\nFound this show by chance & was really impressed. The performers are really talented & funny. A quick reminder of the plot/characters in twelfth night would help appreciate the feat of 2 people playing all the major roles with the exception of the ones the audience help out with.\n\nThe snug is tiny & gets quite warm but we got fans as part of the participation. Great if you're got kids keen to participate. Amazing value at £5!\n\nEmily Carding:\n\nSuch a delight! A joyful show performed by two talented players, a real gem of a performance ️\n\nFinn Longman:\n\nAn impressive two-performer rendition of Twelfth Night with clever use of costumes and audience participation to fill in the gaps. Yeah, it's heavier on the 'comedy' side of things, but it was more Shakespearean than I expected -- a lot more of the original dialogue survived than you might think. I suspect if I didn't know Twelfth Night so well, I might have struggled a little more to follow it, but it was very entertaining nonetheless.\n\nDebbie Bird:\n\nAn outstanding piece. Funny, participatory, heart warming and endearing. I laughed, I got involved, I wanted them to be able to play all the roles. And Jacob the tech stole the show!\n\nJoe Janes:\n\nWow! High energy, inventive, fun, and very, very funny! Shakespeare shredded by a clown Cuisineart!\n\nKeane & Doyle NEVER DIE.... are 2Elfth Night\n\nComing this August, 2019 in Edinburgh, Scotland!

Like Rapunzel in her tower, Helen is waiting for someone—her husband Menelaus (captivating Steven Flores)—to rescue her.” ‘Helen’ Delves into Illusions of Beauty & War, at Yugen, S.F.\n\nGeorge Powell of For All Events writes, “[…] she deals with her enduring fame, […] At the same time […] feels caught in an information vacuum, unsure the seemingly endless war is actually over and unable to find out any substantive news on TV. […] These emotions are skillfully and convincingly portrayed by Adrian Deane as Helen […].” Thought-Provoking ‘Helen’ Delights Audiences at Theatre of Yugen\n\nJean Schiffman of San Francisco Examiner writes, “Adrian Deane is a graceful Helen, easily negotiating the play’s comedy as well as its quieter, deeply felt moments.” Theatre of Yugen’s ‘Helen’ Offers Funny, Feminist Perspective\n\nLily Janiak’s blurb in The SF Chronicle: ‘Helen’\n\nNews Collection - January 2019!\n\nStarting the New Year Strong\n\nTwo Readings, Photo Shoot Release, BATCC Nomination, and Helen Press Release'\n\nDarabi Photographi published the latest portrait collaboration with Adrian Deane.

She has to maintain a fervent curiosity when her interlocutors seem like they’d be just as content whether she kept talking to them or not, and when they display not a fraction of the interest in her work — medieval Spanish poetry — that she has in theirs. She has to get insecure and defensive about the value of the arts as compared with the value of science. And she has to become the good woman whose love, faith and strength, the play implies, propels a man to greatness.\n\nYet Deane does exquisite work with these thankless chores, elevating Jane to not just a three-dimensional character, but one of molten complexity. Deane has the power of transforming her expression completely without visibly moving a single facial muscle. It’s as if clouds of rage, hope, gratitude and genuine curiosity keep silently storming through, for an instant inflaming her eyes and flushing her cheeks, then ceding ground to the next passing weather system.”\n\nVictor Cordell from For All Events: ‘A Time for Hawking’.\n\n\"But Stephen’s alluring nemesis is Jane, played with stunning authority by a wonderful Adrian Deane. Proper and imperious, she is the immovable object that challenges Stephen’s beliefs. As a Spanish literature student, intellectually strong and undaunted by the scientists, she represents the perspective of the humanities. She asserts her own world view with confidence and questions what Stephen and Jayant accept as the truth and beauty of cosmology.\"\n\n“While the conversations drive forward the relationships of the three, more importantly, they are used to expound upon a number of the most important theories and theorists of physics. Surprisingly, their talk also touches on the topics of Indian religion and philosophy and Spanish poetry, as well as the concepts of learning, reconciliation of contradiction, and truth.”\n\nCharles Kruger from Theatrestorm: ‘A Time for Hawking’ Presented by Indra’s Net Theater.\n\n\"Indra’s Net Theater specializes in plays about science, usually original work, often from the hand of playwright/director Bruce Coughran. They consistently offer some of the best and most intellectually challenging theatre to be found in the Bay Area, and “A Time for Hawking” is no exception.\"\n\n“Playwright/director Bruce Coughran combines a poet’s gift for language with the insight of a scientist and the instincts of a showman. It is a tremendous trifecta, well displayed in this production.”\n\nIndra's Net Theater presents A TIME FOR HAWKING, a new play written & directed by Bruce Coughran.\n\nDecember 20, 2018 through January 13, 2019.\n\nTickets at:\n\nhttps://www.artful.ly/store/events/16092"
