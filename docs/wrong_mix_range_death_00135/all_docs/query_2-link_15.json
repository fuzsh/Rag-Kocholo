        "text": "For most of his time on Earth, Thomas Weir lived as an affluent and well-respected community member. He was devoted to his homeland and was a high-ranking member of the army, even serving in Ulster during the Irish Rebellion of 1641.\n\nWeir also professed his belief in the Presbyterian Church and would hold prayer sessions at his house, which often attracted large crowds, all eager to see the master public speaker at work.\n\nIn the later years of his life, however, Weir began to behave strangely, and it came as a great shock to the entire city when, after falling ill in 1670, he began to confess to a secret life. One of sin and evil.\n\nThe many horrific acts Weir confessed to were bestiality, incest, and witchcraft. His sister also admitted to these crimes and claimed that her brother had once travelled in a phantom coach driven by a demonic driver, such was his relationship with Satan. She also stated that her brother derived his satanic powers from the cane he carried with him everywhere he went.\n\nThose who encountered Weir during his lifetime would later claim that the cane would dance in front of him as he walked down the street, though if that were true, nobody would have been surprised when he confessed to being a follower of The Lord of Darkness.\n\nBut they were surprised, so surprised that the authorities initially refused to believe the man. However, his continued confessions to a life a sin proved too much to ignore and Thomas Weir was sentenced to death after a short trial.\n\nWeir’s house lay empty for many years as nobody wanted to live in the former home of such an evil individual.\n\nRegarded by many as the most haunted house in Edinburgh during the 1700s, an elderly couple purchased it at some point towards the end of the 18th Century but were driven out after just one night.\n\nAccording to the couple, they had encountered a series of demonic apparitions which made them rethink their investment.\n\nFor many years, it was believed that Weir’s house was demolished to get rid of the stigma surrounding the area. Still, recent evidence suggests it was just incorporated into another building, which is now the Quaker Meeting House. This would explain why many of the paranormal activity associated initially with Weir’s home now occurs at the meeting house.\n\nAmong various other spooky happenings, the staff at the meeting house have reported seeing Thomas Weir moving throughout the building, walking through walls searching for his former abode.\n\nWilliam Brodie is often compared to Thomas Weir by those familiar with Edinburgh’s paranormal side.\n\nLike Weir, Brodie was a well-respected member of society and was considered a master of his trade (manufacturing cabinets and the like). He was also the head of the Edinburgh Incorporation of Wrights and Masons, which repaired locks.\n\nAlso, like Weir, Brodie led a sinful secret life, which began when he copied the keys to a bank. Brodie went on to steal several hundred pounds from the bank, which he used to support his family, along with five mistresses (none of whom knew about each other).\n\nWilliam Brodie maintained his secret life (or lives) for quite a while, but authorities began to grow suspicious of him and were eventually tipped off to his side business.\n\nBrodie realised he needed to get out of Edinburgh before the police came looking for him and managed to make it as far as Amsterdam before being arrested and brought back to his home city for trial. He was found guilty and sentenced to death by hanging.\n\nIt was later said that Brodie attempted to survive the hanging by utilising his knowledge of carpentry and bribing the hangman.\n\nIf this is true, it did not go according to plan as Brodie was hung, buried, and his spirit soon began appearing in the area where he had his workshop and family home.\n\nReports of William Brodie appearing in Brodie’s Close persist today. Many who encounter his spirit claim that a demonic, fire breathing horse accompanies him as he strolls along.\n\nOf all Edinburgh’s haunted locations, the Edinburgh Vaults are by far the most popular, and the amount of paranormal activity reported herein is almost unheard of.\n\nThe vaults were first opened during the 18th Century when Edinburgh was in a period of unprecedented growth.\n\nThe vaults were initially intended to house taverns, cobblers, and other above-board but ironically underground businesses. However, things began to go awry around 1795 when flooding led to a mass exodus, and the Vaults fell into a state of abandonment.\n\nEventually, the vaults became home to some less-than-legal practices, including brothels.\n\nMany of the city’s poor were forced to take up residence in the vaults, and it has been reported that notorious serial killers Burke and Hare would visit one part of the vaults to find their victims and use another part of the vaults to store their bodies.\n\nThough this claim is unsubstantiated, the level of paranormal activity that occurs here daily suggests that there have indeed been some evil dealings beneath Edinburgh over the past couple of centuries.\n\nMuch poltergeist activity has been reported in the vaults, particularly in one room today in a state of perpetual darkness as any lightbulb installed in the past would instantly explode.\n\nAn investigation of the wiring turned up no logical explanation for the repeated rejection of light. The consensus among the paranormal community is that it was caused by the same spirit known to push and pull anybody who dares to venture into its part of the vault.\n\nLocated twelve miles south-east of Edinburgh, lies the 15th century Borthwick Castle. The castle has a rich history, having served as a refuge for Mary, Queen of Scots, during the 16th century.\n\nOne of its finest and best preserved 15th century keeps, it’s also on of Scotland’s most haunted.\n\nThis imposing fortress is home to no less than five ghosts, one of the most famous being that of Mary Queen of Scots. Her spirit is said to wander the through the structure in the dead of night, wearing a page boy outfit – the disquise she used in an attempted escape from the castle.\n\nAnother ghost at Borthwick Castle is that of a lady who haunts the Red Room. The story goes that she became pregnant at the hands of one of the Lords of the castle and was stabbed straight through her pregnant belly with a swordand left to die in that very room.\n\nAs one of Scotland’s most haunted castles, visitors staying at Borthwick have reported feeling constantly watched and some have even experienced sudden and extreme nausea, which terrifies them."
