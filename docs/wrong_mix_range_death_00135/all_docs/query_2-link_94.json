        "text": "The Witchcraft Act 1563 resulted in approximately 4,000 innocent people being accused of witchcraft. Confessions were routinely obtained by torture and around 2,500 of those accused were convicted and executed, normally by way of strangulation and then burning at the stake. Scotland killed five times as many people as witches than elsewhere in Europe. 85% of those accused were women.\n\nMany markers, stones and memorials across Scotland remember the local people who were sent to their brutal deaths prior to the repeal of the the Witchcraft Act in 1736.\n\n1. Witches Well, Castle Esplanade, Edinburgh\n\nA cast iron fountain honours the hundreds of innocent people burned at the esplanade for the crime of witchcraft. During the 16th century, more women were murdered at this site than anywhere else in Scotland.\n\nMore info\n\n2. Gallow Green, Paisley\n\nIn 1696, 4 women, a man & 2 children were strangled and burned at this site after being found guilty of witchcraft. Another man hung himself in jail before the sentence could be carried out.\n\nThe well is all that remains today.\n\nMore info\n\n3. Maxwellton Cross Memorial, Paisley\n\nThe ashes of all seven were buried at Maxwellton Cross which is now a busy intersection. The grave was marked with a horseshoe to keep the witches curse at bay.\n\nMore info\n\n“Pain Inflicted, Suffering Endured, Injustice Done.”\n\n4. Witches Stone, Bo’ness\n\nIn 1648 six women were burned as witches in Carriden, possibly at the spot where the Witches Stone still stands not far from the old graveyard at Carriden House.\n\nMore info\n\n5. Witches Stone, Spott, East Lothian\n\nIt marks where Marion Lillie, the Rigwoodie Witch, was burnt about 1698 and serves to commemorate other ‘witches’ who were hunted in this district.\n\nMore info\n\n6. Statue in Prestonpans, East Lothian\n\nA memorial to the 81 alleged witches tortured and executed in Prestonpans. Their innocence was publicly declared in 2004.\n\nMore info\n\n7. Culross Plaque, Fife\n\nAn estimated 380 people in Fife (mostly women) were accused of witchcraft. The plaque faces the Town Hall where 32 accused women were held.\n\nMore info\n\n“Innocent victims of unenlightened times”\n\n8. Valleyfield Wood Plaque, Fife\n\nDedicated to Lilias Adie 1640-1704 who died awaiting trial.\n\nMore info\n\n“An ordinary woman accused of “lying with the devil””\n\n9. Torryburn Plaque, Fife\n\nThe plaque overlooks the beach where Adie’s body was buried in the intertidal mudflats of Torryburn beach under a heavy sandstone slab to prevent the devil reanimating her.\n\nMore info\n\n10. Witches Maze, Tullibole Castle, Crook of Devon\n\nMaze of beech hedges with a pillar in the middle, etched with the names of the eleven victims of the witch trials in 1662.\n\nMore info\n\n11. Maggie Wall Monument, Dunning, Perthshire\n\n“Maggie Wall burnt here 1657 as a witch”. Yet mysteriously, there is no record of a woman named Maggie Wall being tried as a witch, and very little information on the monument either.\n\nMore info\n\n12. Witches Stone, Monzie, Crieff\n\nKate McNieven is supposedly the witch who gave her name to the stone, although there are some doubts about when she was burned, or even her existence. She was rumoured to be a healer who sometimes turned into a bee.\n\nMore info\n\n13. Grissel Jaffray Mosaic, Dundee\n\nBoth Jaffray and her husband were accused of witchcraft and may have been targeted for being Quakers. In 1669 Jaffray was strangled and burned at the stake. Her husband was set free.\n\nMore info\n\n14. Forfar Witch Memorial\n\nThe memorial stone is simply dedicated to the “Forfar Witches”, and features 22 dots that represent each of the women who were killed for the “abominable cryme of witchcraft.”\n\nMore info\n\n“Just people”\n\n15. Gallus Quines & Deeds Not Words street art, Aberdeen\n\nThe witchcraft panic of 1597 lead to the execution of 30 people in Aberdeen. This mural is next to St Nicholas Church which was used as a prison for the accused witches.\n\nMore info\n\n16. Witches Stone, Forres\n\nThe plaque reads: “From Cluny Hill, witches were rolled in stout barrels through which spikes were driven. Where the barrels stopped they were burned with their mangled contents. This stone marks the site of one such burning.”\n\nMore info\n\n17. Witch Memorial Plaque, Kirkwall, Orkney\n\nAt least 19 women and one man, accused of worshipping the occult, went on trial in the county between 1594 and 1645, with nine of them sentenced to death by hanging or at the stake.\n\nMore info\n\n“They wur cheust folk”\n\n18. Witches Stone, Dornoch\n\nJanet Horne was the last person to be executed legally and burned for witchcraft. Most likely suffering from dementia, Janet was stripped, tarred and burned alive. The date on the stone, 1722, is disputed and should probably be 1727.\n\nMore info\n\nAlthough witchcraft has been legally abolished, the cult of the witch is so dear to humanity that it is, in some aspects, prevalent today as it was some centuries ago.\n\nTJ Salmon, 1913"
