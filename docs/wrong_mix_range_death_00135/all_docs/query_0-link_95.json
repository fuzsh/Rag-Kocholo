        "text": "Related Papers\n\nJournal of dramatic theory and criticism, 2019\n\nDownload\n\nThe Eugene O'Neill Review, 2023\n\nEugene O’Neill was constantly experimenting with theatrical styles and genres. From naturalism to expressionism, his plays both follow the tenets of each of these forms while containing a throughline that is, for lack of a better word, O’Neillian. This article argues that O’Neill’s stage directions contain pertinent information with regard to what aspects of these dramatic styles O’Neill is adhering to and what parts of his own style he has not relinquished. By looking at Bound East for Cardiff, The Hairy Ape, and Hughie in contrast to other plays written around the same time period in those specific genres, it becomes clear that O’Neill uses stage directions for the purpose of transmitting dramatic style. Like the Hairy Ape himself, O’Neill both belongs and does not belong to each of the dramatic styles he used for his plays, and this “failure” is perhaps his greatest achievement.\n\nDownload\n\nEugene O'Neill Review, 2018\n\nEugene O’Neill’s complex, lengthy, and precise stage directions have long garnered attention from scholars and performers alike. And yet the voices that so often claim these words prescribe actions to be taken by actors do not take into account the variety of ways that O’Neill’s stage directions function in terms of actual theatrical productions. This article analyzes two particular techniques O’Neill utilized to write stage directions that practically enable a wide variety of performance possibilities. The first category, spoken stage directions, relates the thought asides in plays such as Strange Interlude, to the lengthy stage directions in his other plays, arguing that they function similarly for an actor. The second category, affective stage directions, shows how O’Neill’s words function as a conduit to the emotion, tone, and mood of a character and/or scene and the actor(s) performing.\n\nDownload\n\nTheatre Topics, 2007\n\nDownload"
