        "text": "You can see that Thomas Riddell jnr was an adventuring sea captain. Who died younger: Harry Potterâs nemesis Voldemort or our sacred Thomas Riddell?\n\nRepeat after me \"I am a wizard not a baboon with a stick\" ð\n\nWhoâs killed more?\n\nWhere did Thomas Riddle grow up?\n\nWell I guess we shouldnât expect too much, Potter the boy who fell off the back of a broom ð¤\n\nPotterâs touched in the head, Iâve seen more liveliness in Merlinâs saggy left testicle ð¥\n\nAt Hogwarts Tom found his world. Disowning his Muggle past, Tom embraced a new identity. How is Tomâs Wizard supremacist name pronounced?\n\nHold your Hippogriffs! â Potterâs not the swiftest wand in Ollivanders.\n\nItâs a wonder Potter hasnât poisoned himself. We can all be thankful that delight awaits â³\n\nVoldemort spent his whole life striving to conquer the âidiot humiliationâ of death. He slaughtered a unicorn to try and restore himself. Broke into the Chamber of Secrets riding on the back of Quirrellâs head to steal Philosopherâs Stone & win immortality.\n\nThe saga is driven by Tomâs thirst for eternal life, a deliberate contrast to Dumbledoreâs attitude âTo the well-organized mind, death is but the next great adventure.â\n\nCan you guess Voldemortâs Boggart, the wardrobe dwelling creature that takes the shape of a witchâs or wizardâs worst fear?\n\nYou think Voldmor feared Harry? He hated Dumbledoreâs pawn perhaps, but mostly he was puzzled by him.\n\nDumbledore was a powerful adversary, the champion of liberalism, to be managed and outmaneuvered. He left Tomâs boots quake free ð¿\n\nTo my mind the most unusual things about Voldemort is he had empathy.\n\nGeneral Tagge: But thatâs impossible! How will the Emperor maintain control without the bureaucracy?\n\nGovernor Tarkin: The regional governors now have direct control over their territories. Fear will keep the local systems in line. Fear of this battle station. [ the Deathstar ]\n\nPowerful line Fear. But Fear - whereâs the subtly? Whereâs the finesse?\n\nVoldemort mastered people through empathy, preying on their fears and desires. In the Order of the Phoenix this heightened skill is called Legimency, the ability to reach in and decode peoplesâ minds; uncontrolled emotions render targets an open book.\n\nBut Tomâs empathy is clearest in the Chamber of Secrets, when Tom Riddleâs diary learns Ginny Weasleyâs secrets as she confides in it. It uses her fears and desires and shame to manipulate her.\n\nIn some respects itâs similar to how The One Ring allows Sauron to look into Frodo, but Riddleâs diary is more fully developed with the idea pivotal to the plot.\n\nWhose diary was Tomâs diary inspired by?\n\nJKR: \"My sister used to commit her innermost thoughts to her diary. Her great fear was that someone would read it. Thatâs how the idea came to me of a diary that is itself against you. You would be confiding everything to pages that arenât inanimate.\"\n\nRowlingâs mother loved to read, their childhood cottage was stuffed with books. In fact one of Rowlingâs relatives was a reader for a publisher, and the Rowlings received yet-to-be published manuscripts from her.\n\nOne of Rowling greatest regrets is never telling her mother she had begun Harry Potter, and that she was never lived to see her success.\n\nNot to our knowledge. She entertained her sister with stories and hungered for a large family like the Weasleys. She had a school friend with a large family, so Rowling had no illusions, the poverty of the Weasley family is based on her friendâs situation.\n\nRowling liked to invent games and play them with her sister Di, who she bullied if she didnât play them to her satisfaction. She said a larger family would be more people to boss around.\n\nVoldemort is âthe one wizard who went as bad as you can goâ. He has refined methods of torture and kills casually; he is without remorse. Can you tell me which tree his wand is taken from?\n\nHis wand, matched to him by Ollivander, is made of Yew, whose sap is poisonous and fatal to humans, it is supposed to endow itâs possessor with the power of life and death. Yew wood continues to be poisonous after a tree has died. Thereâs a circle of growthless ground surrounding his grave, perhaps Tom was buried with his wand.\n\nWas Harryâs wand. He shared a wand core with Tom, a Phoenix feather from Fawkesâ tail. But Rowlingâs choice of wood was a deliberate contrast to Voldemortâs wand. Rowling said \"European tradition has it that the holly tree (the name comes from âholyâ) repels evil\".\n\nShe said that wands of Holly are matched to wizards \"engaged in some dangerous and often spiritual quest\"\n\nTomâs mother was from an ancient pure blood wizard family the Gaunts. Who in particular did they like to marry?\n\nNobody much liked Tomâs mother Merope, not even her own father. She drugged Muggle Tom Riddle snr, the love of her life, with a love potion. She was a black sheep ð\n\nð You lost a Galleon & found a knut. -145 + 1 points.\n\nGreat sizzling dragon bogies, how is it possible to be this hopeless?\n\nTheir cousins, to keep their bloodline pure. Prince Charlesâ ears anyone?\n\nViolence flourished through the generations due to their habit of marrying their own cousins, Tom believed âMagic is Mightâ.\n\nTom murdered his grandfather, a bovine-brained Muggle. What was his grandfatherâs job?\n\nYour body should just quit, pointless sloshing around those dungbrains all day ð©\n\nðª If I were you Iâd chop that Dunderhead right off, save you a great deal of trouble and embarrassment.\n\nYouâve made a pilgrimage to the resting place of the worst wizard of modern times, perhaps we should learn some Dark Magic. How many forbidden curses are there?\n\nOrdinarily Iâd suspect you were under control of the Imperius Curse, but no Legilimency can penetrate a bone head ð\n\nOnce again Potter proves the value of a cauldron with holes, you fill him with valuable ingredients and they just shoot straight out ð¸\n\nTom spent his summers at Woolâs orphanage London. Whereâs Tomâs favourite station?\n\nWhat can we expect? Of a boy too solid to apparate a meter.\n\nð¸ Potter, some words of advice, donât leave anything behind. The only way youâre coming back next year, is as somebodies pet. Itâs perhaps fortunate that Longbottomâs always losing his.\n\nWell I think it is often the case that the biggest bullies take what they know to be their own defects, as they see it, and they put them right on someone else and then they try and destroy the other and thatâs what Voldemort does - JKR\n\nSo you made an event out of it.\n\nTut, tut, you think youâre clever?\n\nIt can be better.\n\nEdinburgh is JK Rowlingâs home, Harry Potter is in the rock, the magical world opens up down every twisted alley. Transmute your passion into an experience, come on a loving Potter tour. Or...\n\nNicolsons\n\nWhile youâre near, ~7 minutes walk, retire for a restorative hot chocolate or expresso in Rowlingâs fondly remembered Nicolsons."
