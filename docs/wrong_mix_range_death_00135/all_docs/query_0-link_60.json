Abstract This study involves the process of schizoanalysis, the production of desire, and desiring machine in the play of Eugene O’Neill, Strange Interlude. Emancipation of desire from the shackles of society and capitalism is shown in it. The rhizomatic study of desire, love, and past memories is also the focus of this study with special reference to the rhizome theory of Gilles Deleuze and Felix Guattari. Keywords: schizoanalysis, desire, desiring machine, rhizomatic, rhizome theory, past memories Introduction Eugene O'Neill is a postmodernist play writer. He is famous for his autobiographical plays. Desire under Elms, Long Day's Journey into Night, and Strange Interlude are his famous plays. O'Neill has been elaborated in different ways by the critics. Dreams, myths and art have intimate relation to each other and only a best artist can elaborate them in his work skillfully. O'Neill has used these images in his plays in the form of primordial scenes. Greek myths and themes like Oedipus complex, a resentful and unforgiving father, a struggling hero who is also a loving son and a caring mother who is always seeking a revenge for wrong deeds done to her by others, are frequently used in his plays. O'Neill also takes the reader to the realm of unconscious and sub consciousness by using Freud's notion of repression. Autobiographical elements can also be traced in his plays. Christian dogmas and beliefs have also been dominant themes in most of his plays. Labyrinth, the most dominating images in postmodern literature has been quite ensnaring for both authors and the readers and we can easily portray his play Strange Interlude in the light of labyrinth. Rhizome also works like a labyrinth without a beginning or an\n\nJohn Foundation Journal of EduSpark ISSN 2581-8414 (Print) ISSN 2582-2128 (Online) International Journal of Multidisciplinary Research Studies A Quarterly Peer Reviewed /Refereed Multidisciplinary Journal Vol.2, Issue.4, October –December 2020 2 end. It does not follow any fixed direction rather it moves everywhere. The use of this rhizomatic labyrinth in literary work is called philosophical labyrinth. A rhizome in a story helps its readers to comprehend it in multiple ways and move forward with the twisted ways of the inner conflicts of the characters. Rhizome in Strange Interlude is a way to experience the world with the help of its characters and becomes a tool to follow the map of an individual’s experiences, people and their mutual interactions. It also encourages the readers to see the matters from different angles. In postmodern literature, it is not only the world, the events or experiences that are Rhizomatic but also the human individual. The way he connects with the society multiplies, gets broken and takes a new start. Deleuze and Guattari gave their concept of schizoanalysis in their book, “Anti - Oedipus: Capitalism and Schizophrenia”, to liberate desire. According to this concept desire always creates the real. It is not fixed in identity and nature. Their aim was to deconstruct a consciousness (Cooper 03). Schizoanalysis is actually the production of desire. Deleuze and Guattari, in their second volume \"A Thousand Plateaus: Capitalism and Schizophrenia\", reveal rhizome through the narratives of novels and short stories in literature. They exhibit it to be the attribute of being human to find escape ways from nullity and worthlessness of “unending growth and decay of life” (4), while getting more lost in this rhizomatic labyrinth of time and space. This rhizomatic thinking suggests that human being can not only be transformed by feelings, emotions and cultural experiences but also by chaos, disorder, and fluid expressions. We can see rhizomatic labyrinth in the play Strange Interlude through presenting the theme of love, desire and memories of the past. O’Neill also seems to emphasize the prevailing condition of the society which dominates a man and urges him/her to act against the will. Eugene O’Neill has always tried to question the position of man in this universe. He presents the man entangled in the labyrinth of power in Emperor Jones, of desire in Desire under Elms and of love and the past in Strange Interlude. The central theme of O’Neill’s plays is the difficult and unending plight in which a man is entangled and cannot come out of this problem in his life. Eugene O’Neil has"
