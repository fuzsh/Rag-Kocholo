        "text": "Profile\n\nTheater demands that both the maker and the audience engage in the moment and in the imagination. And whether I’m directing Shakespeare, Chekhov, a devised piece or working with New School students at the ‘I HAVE A DREAM’ Theater & Education Afterschool Programs, I find the making of theater asks all of us to collaboratively grapple with impossible but real, essential & generative questions.\n\nWorking in an array of disciplines as a writer, director, and collaborator -- my professional work and teaching have focused on -- theater as a medium for engaged dialogue; the “everyday practice of the actor”; taking on classics through a global lens (particularly Shakespeare); transformative arts education, and theater & environmental advocacy.\n\nI recently wrote and directed the documentary play Gage County NE with community members in Beatrice, Nebraska which is featured in each episode of HBO’s Mind Over Murder true-crime series directed by filmmaker Nanfu Wang. The series has been nominated for multiple awards and the play Gage County NE is highlighted in numerous reviews including the Wall Street Journal, NPR, The Guardian and American Theater Magazine.\n\nI also directed the documentary film, Remembering Shakespeare, which explores new ways of thinking about memory and Shakespeare’s words in our digital age where memory itself is at risk http://www. rememberingshakespearefilm. com/ My chapter, “If It Live In Your Memory” appears in The Whirlwind of Passion: New Critical Perspectives on William Shakespeare (Cambridge Scholar’s Press). I recently directed the short whimsical film Menstrual Rosary with a score by Stefania de Kenessey which has won citations and awards at an array of film festivals worldwide.\n\nI have written, devised, and directed theater pieces which have performed at Lincoln Center's Walter Reade and Bruno Walter Theaters, The New Victory @ 42nd Street, Jefferson Market Playhouse, the Washington Square Hotel, WNYC’s Jerome L Greene Performance Space, the New York & Edinburgh Fringe Festivals. I wrote and directed FROM THE FIRE, which won three Edinburgh Fringe Festival’s UK/Music Theater Awards: Best Music, Best Production and Best New Musical and a WNET Public Television documentary of FROM THE FIRE was nominated for a NY Emmy award.\n\nI am an Associate Professor of Theater at Lang College/The New School and am currently the director of the Lang College Theater Program which was named one of the top Civic Engagement and Social Justice theater programs in the US by American Theater Magazine. I also currently direct the Lang First Year Program and coordinate the ‘I Have a Dream’ Theater & Education Program. I previously was on the faculty at NYU’s Tisch School of the Arts, NYU’s Playwrights Horizons Studio and NYU’s Kanbar School for Film & Television. I received Lang College Faculty Advisor Excellence Award (2016) and the New School’s Excellence in Teaching Award (2018). I also received a Periclean Faculty Leadership Award and have served in the national Pericles Faculty Leadership cohort (2020-2022) and served as a mentor for the Mellon Initiative for Inclusive Faculty Excellence. I am currently a Lang College representative on the New School University Faculty Senate.\n\nPortfolio\n\nwww.ceciliarubino.com\n\nwww. rememberingshakespearefilm.com\n\nDegrees Held\n\nMFA, Yale School of Drama;\n\nBA, Magna cum laude, Williams College\n\nProfessional Affiliation\n\nThe Association for Theater in Higher Education\n\nThe Dramatist Guild\n\nThe Remember the Triangle Shirtwaist Coalition\n\nBoard Member of Piper Theater, Brooklyn\n\nRecent Publications\n\nRECENT PUBLICATIONS\n\nRubino, Cecilia. “If It Live in Your Memory” chapter in The Whirlwind of Passion: New Critical Perspectives on William Shakespeare.
