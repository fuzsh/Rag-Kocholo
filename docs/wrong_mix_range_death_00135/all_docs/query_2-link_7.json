        "text": "Edinburgh is a mystical city with an impressive collection of intriguing graveyards and churches, but there are none quite as captivating as Greyfriars Kirkyard, which we discovered during our visit one cold autumn afternoon.\n\nBefore my trip to Edinburgh, I was shamefully ignorant to the story of Greyfriars Bobby… That was until I took one look at his magnificent statue, researched his story, and spent the majority of our stroll around the Kirkyard fiercely trying to convince myself that I wasn’t crying.\n\nThe grave that inspired Tom Riddle? Forget it! There is a more alluring tale to be told within the mysterious depths of Greyfriars, and although I am a huge fan of all things Harry Potter, I actually found myself yearning to delve deeper into Bobby’s story more than any other.\n\nBobby, born in 1856, was a Terrier who spent over 14 years guarding the grave of his beloved owner. John – a dedicated nightwatchman for the Edinburgh City Police Force – carried out his duties with his trusty companion night after night. After John’s untimely death in 1858, Bobby refused to leave his master’s grave until the day he died himself.\n\nThe rumours about this little dog began to spread far and wide, and Bobby soon had quite the fan base. In 1867, the Lord Provost of Edinburgh presented him with his very own collar. This gesture signified that Bobby was a licensed dog, meaning that he was protected against the new law that had recently been enforced, which stated that all unlicensed dogs would be destroyed.\n\nBobby passed away in January 1872 and as a final token to his loyalty, was buried close to his master in the Kirkyard. A granite fountain with a statue can be found opposite Greyfriars Kirkyard – a permanent memorial to this faithful pup.\n\nWhere to pay tribute to Bobby in Edinburgh\n\n1.Greyfriars Kirkyard\n\nBobby’s grave can be found immediately inside the gate of Greyfriars Kirkyard. He was buried close to his much-loved John, ensuring that the pair’s astonishing bond would never be broken. It is not uncommon for doting visitors to leave sticks, dog toys and flowers on his grave.\n\nThe engraving on the headstone reads: Greyfriars Bobby – died 14th January 1872 – aged 16 years – Let his loyalty and devotion be a lesson to us all.\n\n2. Greyfriars Bobby statue\n\nLocated just in front of the entrance to the Greyfriars Kirk, this monument pays tribute to Bobby in the form of an adorable statue.\n\nHundreds of fans flock here every day to pay their respects, all eager to get a closer look at their doggy hero.\n\n3. The Museum of Edinburgh\n\nHoused within the 16th century Huntly House, one of the most historic buildings on the Royal Mile, The Museum of Edinburgh tells the tale of Edinburgh through the ages through a variety of fascinating exhibits.\n\nIt is here that you’ll find the collar that was given to Bobby in 1867 by the Lord Provost.\n\n4. Greyfriars Bobby’s Bar\n\nExploring can be tiring work – rest weary legs and refuel at the Bobby-inspired Greyfriars Bobby’s Bar on Candlemaker Row.\n\nOpened daily, they serve a variety of beers, wines and spirits, as well as classic pub dishes.\n\nCara Jasmine Bradley is a creative writer from Manchester, who combines her love of travelling with her passion for writing. As well as travel articles, Cara is also particularly keen on writing children’s fiction."
