        "text": "It is easy to sympathise with Eugene O’Neill’s wish that his most autobiographical work should be locked away and not produced until 25 years after his death. Even in today’s confessional culture, the deeply personal portrait of a family tearing itself to pieces in a fog of addiction and half-remembered dreams feels uncomfortably close to the knuckle. Running in some versions to more than four hours, the play’s chain of quarrels can become relentless. Yet Tony Cownie’s production for the Lyceum is so beautifully paced and finally so moving that it completely catches you up in its emotional atmosphere.\n\nCownie and the quartet of actors playing O’Neill’s doomed Irish-American family succeed in making you feel the tragedy on view, not least in their disquieting portrayal"
