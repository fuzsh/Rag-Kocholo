        "text": "In late June 1836, a group of boys headed out to the slopes of Arthur’s Seat in Edinburgh to hunt for rabbits. What they found there has remained a baffling mystery ever since.\n\nIn a secluded spot on the north-east side of the hill, the boys discovered a small cave in the rock, hidden behind three pointed slabs of slate. Concealed within were 17 miniature coffins.\n\nEight of these coffins survive to the present day, and are on display in the National Museum of Scotland. Few objects in our collection excite as much intrigue. Who made the intricate carved figures? Who did they represent? Who placed them in their secret sepulchre… and why?\n\nAlmost 200 years after their discovery, we attempt to unravel the mystery of the miniature coffins.\n\nHonorific burial\n\nAfter this initial flurry of media interest, the Arthur's Seat coffins passed into the hands of private collectors, reappearing in 1901, when eight were donated to the Museum of the Society of Antiquaries of Scotland, and from there to National Museums Scotland. What happened to the remaining nine? The Scotsman tells us that \"a number\" were destroyed by the boys, although we don’t know how many – certainly no more have come to light since.\n\nOn surveying the evidence from The Scotsman, Edinburgh Evening Post and Caledonian Mercury, cuttings from which were donated with the coffins, the Society concluded that \"the intention [of the coffins] seems to be to symbolise honorific burial\".\n\nBut the mystery has not been allowed to rest there.\n\nA very curious mystery\n\nFive years later, in 1906, The Scotsman published another bizarre story about the coffins. A ‘lady residing in Edinburgh’ had told the paper that her father (‘Mr B.’) had sometimes been visited at his business premises by a ‘daft man’. On one occasion, the man had drawn on a piece of paper a picture of three small coffins, with the dates 1837, 1838 and 1840 written underneath.\n\n\"In the autumn of 1837, \"The Scotsman explains, \"a near relative of Mr B’s died; in the following year a cousin died and in 1840 his own brother died. After the funeral, the daft deaf mute appeared again, walked into Mr B’s office and 'glowering' at him vanished never to return.\"\n\n\"Is it not just possible,\" the article goes on to ask, \"that this man was the maker of the Arthur’s Seat coffins, \"driven mad by the loss of his treasures\" ? Or was the whole story \"nothing but coincidences\"?\n\nA weird twist to the tale indeed.\n\nFast-forward to 1976 and Walter Hävernick, the Director of the Museum of Hamburg History, had come up with a new theory. Referring to a German seafaring superstition of keeping mandrake roots or dolls in tiny coffins as talismen, he postulated that the coffins were a hoard of lucky charms, hidden in the hillside by a merchant, to be sold to sailors.\n\nBut while the use of charms persisted in Scotland well into the 19th century, no evidence of this particular seafaring tradition has been found.\n\nThe Scottish charms below can be seen alongside the Arthur’s Seat coffins in the National Museum of Scotland.\n\nCelebrated as the seat of the Scottish Enlightenment, transformed by the creation of the Georgian New Town and, in 1822, graced by the first visit of a reigning monarch since 1650, Edinburgh had much to boast about in the early 19th century.\n\nYet this bright, sophisticated, intellectual hotbed of a city also had a dark side, highlighted by the sharp division between the elegant, well-to-do New Town and the more densely populated, overcrowded Old Town.\n\nBy the early 1800s, Edinburgh was renowned as a centre of medical excellence, its reputation as a place to study the healing arts second to none. Key to this education was an understanding of anatomy – yet a vital component of its study was becoming increasingly hard to come by for staff at the city’s medical schools: cadavers for dissection. With more and more students thronging the anatomy theatres and fewer criminals meeting their end on the gallows (the usual source of bodies for the dissecting table), the supply was no longer meeting the demand.\n\nUnscrupulous criminals saw a gap in the market, and the practice of ‘bodysnatching’ – digging up dead bodies from churchyards and selling them to anatomists – soon became rife across the country.\n\nYet the corpses sold by the infamous ‘bodysnatchers’ Burke and Hare to the renowned Edinburgh anatomist and lecturer Dr Robert Knox came not from grave robbing but from murder.\n\nIrish immigrants Burke and Hare began their murderous career almost by accident, when an elderly lodger in Mrs Hare’s boarding house in the West Port died, owing money. To recoup the losses, Burke and Hare sold the body to Dr Robert Knox, for use in his anatomy school in Surgeons Square.\n\nAnd so began a vicious killing spree that lasted 10 months, during which Burke and Hare murdered at least 16 victims and earned around £150-£250,000 in today's money. At first they chose their victims carefully, choosing travellers who were unlikely to be missed, but as time went by the pair got sloppy, killing local figures who were instantly recognisable when dissection was about to take place.\n\nIt was only a matter of time before the law caught up with them, and in November 1828, the murderous duo were arrested. Due to lack of evidence, a conviction could only be secured if one of the suspects would accept and offer to turn King's evidence and confess in return for immunity from prosecution. Burke's partner Helen McDougal and Mrs Hare refused and the offer was then made to Hare who accepted. 9.30am on Christmas morning, 1828, Willaim Burke was found guilty of murder. On 28 January 1829, he was hanged in Edinburgh’s Lawnmarket before a crowd of thousands.\n\nThe day after William Burke was hanged, his body was taken to the anatomy room of the University of Edinburgh. There Alexander Monro dissected and lectured upon his brain. To calm the unrest from the many students and townspeople unable to attend the dissection, Burke's body was laid on the dissection table while students filed past that afternoon. Thousands of the public were admitted the next day.\n\nSince the coffins found their way into the museum collections, they have been on display almost constantly, and continue to fascinate visitors today. One such visitor was the author Ian Rankin, who references the coffins in his Inspector Rebus thriller The Falls (2001).\n\nIn the introduction to the book, he explains how a member of staff alerted him to their presence:\n\n\"Plenty of people over the years have come up to me with their excited notions of plots for my next book. I’ve found precious few of them to be helpful, or viable, but I was intrigued by these ‘little dolls’… which is how I made the acquaintance of the Arthur’s Seat coffins… As soon as I saw them, I knew they would make a great story, especially as no one had come up with an incontrovertible interpretation of their meaning. In other words, there was a story to tell about them…\"\n\nIn 2006, the novel was adapted for television and replicas of the coffins were made for filming. The replicas can normally be seen in the Scotland: A Changing Nation Gallery in the National Museum of Scotland, but they occasionally replace the originals when they're needed for display elsewhere\n\nAttached was a label, quoting the chilling climax of Robert Louis Stevenson’s short story ‘The Body Snatcher’ (1884), which weaves elements of the Burke and Hare story into a chilling supernatural tale.\n\nAnd so the story stands: a mystery that will probably never be unravelled, but which has captured the imagination of countless visitors to the National Museum of Scotland.\n\nDead and buried? Not quite."
