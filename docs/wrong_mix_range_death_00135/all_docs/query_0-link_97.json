        "text": "ABOUT THE SHOW\n\nOnce confined only to heated discussions amongst doctoral students, the New York Neo-Futurists unleash O'Neill's stage directions from their dissertation prison, transforming O'Neill's eloquent yet obsessive and often controlling stage directions into rip-roaring physical comedy.\n\nNow a Broadway mainstay, Eugene O'Neill was once considered an experimental, downtown playwright. His plays defied the melodramatic conventions of the day and much of his work premiered with the Provincetown Players on MacDougal Street. The New York Neo-Futurists return O'Neill to his experimental roots with The Complete & Condensed Stage Directions of Eugene O'Neill, Volume 1: Early Plays/Lost Plays. This first in a series chronicles O'Neill's early stage directions (1913-1917), and includes two of his \"sea plays\" (including Bound East for Cardiff) as well as more obscure early works such as his first play, the one-act A Wife for a Life, as well as his epic farce Now I Ask You."
