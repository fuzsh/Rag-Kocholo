        "text": "I have an inward treasure, born with me, which can keep me alive\n\nif all extraneous delights should be withheld; or offered only\n\nat a price I cannot afford to pay”\n\n—–Charlotte Bronte, Jane Eyre\n\nBeyond the Horizon: from another production, probably Andy and Robert as the play opens\n\nDear friends and readers,\n\nSix years past 1914 (when the 19th century ended) 1920 Eugene O’Neill’s Beyond the Horizon was performed. It is genuinely revolutionary. This early play by O’Neill plays is the first to have characters bring out the ravaging truths of their experiences with one another and the world we have been since used to (so commonplace it’s easy to think of lots of plays which do this, e.g., Who’s Afraid of Virginia Woolf has this at its center and nowadays movies too). To celebrate this unusual revival they had snacks, cyder punch (delicious) and snacks.\n\nI recommend the play to all in the DC area beyond the well-meant (I’ve no doubt) performance. Nonetheless, it’s worrying or dismaying if you think about it, for the gifted, intelligent, sensitive character O’Neill meant us to sympathize with, value is regarded sheerly as an object of pity. Nowhere does it come across that he has something worthwhile in him. What is happening in our culture that this is so. For Bronte and those who have loved the book: Jane Eyre is not an object of pity (or scorn as in the review of the book by a woman who was deeply resentful of this governess), but admiration. The horizon is pictured for us in the art work but at no point does anyone in the play suggest you might reach it imaginatively.\n\nThus this blog:\n\nLast night the Admiral and I had braved the fierce cold to go to see this play done marvelously well at the Arlington American Century Theater.\n\nGunston Arts, where this group performs\n\nThe building houses another theater as well as a middle school during the day. It’s been getting deserved good reviews; in last night’s severe cold last night, they had a full theater. Kathleen Akerley the director (she’s also a fine actress). Beautifully directed to create to mood (essential to all O’Neill’s plays). Andrew Drewe and Felipe Cabezas where particularly moving, rousing as the two brothers.\n\nWhat was interesting to us was the ambivalent attitude of director and actors towards Robert. In the play Robert is your intellectual, ever reading (always with his “nose in a book” is the way it’s put), writes poetry and as the play opens in spring he is set to leave the family farm to go on a ship with an uncle. Unfortunately, his brother, Andy, who would make a wonderful farmhand, is in love with Ruth (a cousin) and upon discovering Ruth loves Robert, Andy after grieving intensely, decides he must leave the farm to Ruth and Robert. Robert is all loving and fine in spirit and could not imagine betraying his father to leave the farm if Andy leaves it, so he stays and gives up his chance to see the world, to travel which he would have appreciated.\n\nAndy flees as far as Europe, and to the US north midwest where he is a successful business too. His letters show he takes only a practical view of where he goes, his aim to accumulate money. Three years later in the fall Andy returns to find Robert and Ruth desperate. Robert and Ruth have a child, Mary — a brilliant use of a puppet is made. The puppet was made handled so realistically, it felt like she was this clinging loving but difficult child. Robert appears to love and cherish her far more than Ruth. Unknown to him, Ruth has fallen out of love with Robert: she despises his intellectual attainments, his books, writing stories. She wants Andy but he no longer wants her. Ruth never tells Andy but lets him go almost immediately. He was going to help them but he does not at all.\n\nFive years later he returns to find his parents dead and Robert mortally sick, the farm mortgaged and in a terrible state. Robert is dying and Andy brings him a doctor at long last. No one else had. A mother-in-law (Ruth’s mother) is one of these people with a corrosive tongue and it’s her money that has kept them alive and with the farm. The baby Mary died too. Robert asks only that Andy take Ruth for his wife when he dies in a moving scene — at sunrise — and that Andy stay and keep and make a success of the farm.\n\nAfter some intense soul-searching and wrenching dialogues with Ruth Andy will comply.\n\nAt no point does anyone regard Robert as having anything in him really worthwhile. Robert’s desire to be a writer is something everyone else humors. Yes it might bring in money is the feeling. Ruth is bored by Robert’s reading after all; she at least cooks supper, cleans, mends shirts and were she a man would work hard on the farm.\n\nIt made me feel the same kind of ambivalent self-dislike I find in Trollope’s texts towards writers operating here. O’Neill as implied author allows the hard critique of this man — whom surely he identified with. This is his nightmare, the farm and world he escaped.\n\nJim says that the extant criticism of the play veers between finding Roger to be an anguished sympathetic icon (with the farm and wife “the enemies of” his “promise”) or looking at Ruth as a long-suffering wife who’s been given a raw deal in life. Ackerly had Andy speak in harshly blaming words to Ruth, so harsh we rejected it, but she did not allow Robert really to present himself as loving his books, as finding fulfillment there, only as lost because he couldn’t farm or be a business man. Ackerly’s choices, the production as a whole, sympathized with Robert but only as an object of pity.\n\nShe built up a slow lingering mood of elegiac and angry feeling. The set was an wooden structure which allowed us to be outside at sunset when the play opened, inside most of the rest of the time, and outside at sunrise when it closed. The acting was just superb: Amy Quiggins vanished into her parts first as Mrs Atkins, Ruth’s mother, and then Ruth at the close of the play; Ashley DeMain was a superlative puppeteer. The women exchanged roles, suggesting how individuals don’t count so much as generations, but again here we were not valuing the individual life’s fulfillment.\n\nThe contrast to be brought out is with Susan Glaspell’s work — O’Neill’s contemporary and often his producer. Be it her The Inheritors (a strong social critique in the spirit of Ibsen’s Enemy of the People) or even more The Verge, which latter is written out of Bronte spirit strongly. Austen’s critique of her world is muted but I think the protest and valuation of such an individual there.\n\nFrom a recent production at Provincetown of The Verge\n\nGlaspell’s The Inheritors\n\nJim and I have now seen a number of O’Neill’s plays: a couple of years ago here in the DC area: Strange Interlude (done beautifully by the Washington Shakespeare Company), Mourning Becomes Electra (I forget where), Desire Under the Elms (ditto), about 10 years ago The Iceman Cometh (NYC, with James Earl Jones, weeping weeping weeping). This is the only one where conventional behaviors were presented so flatly. It’s as if O’Neill is writing out of the father’s point of view who dies early on because his sons either don’t want to or can’t keep up this farm.\n\nFrom the same production as my first photo: presumably Ruth and her dying baby girl, Mary\n\nThis not to say the play wasn’t performed in a way that felt illuminating and the deeply anguished emotions were cathartic. This is only third play we’ve gone to this year; the Mary Stuart was as good as anything we’ve seen in a long time. The Richard III meant well but while it went against the grain of Shakespeare’s conception, it did not lose his savage condemnation of politicians. At the WSC Schiller’s Mary Stuart and Shakespeare’s Richard III) were sharp critiques of the politics of out time.\n\nThis one exposed our own desperate blind muddle — those of us who want to live an examined fulfilling life. The hard scrabble life of a New England farm can become a metaphor for what we are being increasingly driven to just to survive monetarily.\n\nEllen"
