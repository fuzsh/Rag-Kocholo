        "text": "Evening Standard Theatre Award winner and Olivier nominee Laurie Kynaston (Spring Awakening, The Son) has joined the cast of the upcoming West End revival of Eugene O'Neill's Long Day's Journey Into Night, which will begin previews at Wyndham’s Theatre March 19.\n\nKynaston, who can currently be seen in Netflix's hit series Fool Me Once as well as The Doll Factory for Paramount+, replaces Anthony Boyle, who has withdrawn due to personal reasons. (Olivier-winning Harry Potter stage star Boyle had previously stepped in for the originally announced Alex Lawther.)\n\nKynaston will star alongside Emmy winner Brian Cox (Succession) as James Tyrone, Golden Globe and Emmy winner Patricia Clarkson (Sharp Objects) as Mary Tyrone, BAFTA nominee Daryl McCormack (Bad Sisters, Good Luck to You, Leo Grande) as James Jr., and Louisa Harland (Derry Girls) as Cathleen.\n\nJeremy Herrin’s new production will also have design by Lizzie Clachan, lighting design by Jack Knowles, sound design by Tom Gibbons, movement by Polly Bennett, voice by Hazel Holder, and casting by Jessica Ronane. The associate director is Justina Kehinde.\n\nOpening night is scheduled for April 2, and performances will continue through June 8.\n\nO’Neill’s drama depicts a summer day in the life of the Tyrones, closely based on O’Neill’s own dysfunctional family.\n\nLong Day's Journey Into Night premiered on Broadway in 1956, subsequently winning the 1957 Tony Award for Best Play and the 1957 Pulitzer Prize for Drama.\n\nSecond Half Productions produces."
