It’s gloomy. The play has 4 long acts, (3.5 hours) it’s all talking and no action - in fact minimal movement .\n\nIt’s fair to say it is Patricia Clarkson as Mary, the wife and Mother, who has just returned from a sanatorium and is fast tumbling back into her addiction, who is palpably vulnerable and completely shines in this production. \n\n#longdaysjourneyintonight #eugeneoneill #playwright #jeremyherrin #director #jackknowles #lighting #lizzieclachan #design #costume #tomgibbons #sound #wyndhamstheatre\".",
