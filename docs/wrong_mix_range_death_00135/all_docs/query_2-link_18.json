        "text": "Descend into a section of Edinburgh’s legendary Underground City, where a population once lived in utter misery. Forgotten for centuries and only recently unsealed, this part of the vaults is known as Damnation Alley. With good reason.\n\nBlack as Satan’s jammies, with a fascinating history to match, these dark chambers are stalked by a malevolent presence known as the South Bridge Entity. Its story is brought vividly to life in the book The Town Below The Ground: Edinburgh’s Legendary Underground City. Signed copies are available after the tour.\n\nThe South Bridge Vaults. They’re darker than you think.\n\nOur walks are written and researched by historical author and award winning novelist, J A Henderson – who has written books on the Underground City, The Mackenzie Poltergeist and Haunted Edinburgh. Our guides are a mixture of historians and professional entertainers, picked for their ability to improvise, entertain and make each tour unique and individual.\n\nThis is history brought to life through storytelling, rather than simply walking around and pointing out historical facts. As a result we have enjoyed years of rave media reviews. City of the Dead has been named “Britain’s Best Ghost Walk” by Scare.com, Yahoo! Travel and Virgin Media and is the only Scottish attraction to be short listed for the prestigious Screamie Awards (3 times!) and the Luxury Travel Awards. We also won Scare Tours ‘Best Ghost Tour’ award."
