        "text": "Hidden on the side of a hill in Danville, Tao House overlooks the San Ramon Valley and Mount Diablo. Here Eugene O’Neill - considered by critics to be America’s Shakespeare - lived and wrote his most celebrated play, “Long Day’s Journey Into Night.” O’Neill is the only American playwright to receive a Nobel Prize for literature as well as an unprecedented four Pulitzer Prizes.\n\nAfter he left Tao House, he never wrote again.\n\nToday, Tao House is a National Historic Site, open to the public for touring and special programs.\n\nBordered by regional parkland, the 158 acres look much the same as when O’Neill lived there.\n\nIn the late 1930s and early 1940s, the Bay Area was rural, with ranches, orchards and small towns. Two-lane roads wound through the hills and valleys. A dirt road led up to what O’Neill called “The Old Ranch.” So it was, of sorts, a 5,200-square-foot home with a barn, chickens, almond and walnut orchards, and fruit trees planted by the writer.\n\n“It is absolute country,” O’Neill wrote a friend, “… without a taint of suburbia … yet only three-quarters of an hour motor ride from Frisco.”\n\nTao House is well preserved. Its lines, a simple L-shape, were meant to combine Chinese and California ranch styles, with two stories of heavy basalt bricks painted white, encircled by porches and patios and crowned by a dark Chinese tile roof. The front gate is black and adorned with Asian letters the O’Neills translated to mean “the right way of life.” It opens into a garden courtyard, with a brick walkway that winds from the house down the hillside to a swimming pool where O’Neill swam almost daily after writing.\n\nThough touring Tao House is free, getting there is complicated because the road now cuts through a gated community of upscale homes. Visitors must make reservations with the National Park Service for a shuttle. But once there, they have access to the home, now a museum, and its magnificent grounds.\n\nThe O’Neills’ life force seems missing from the museum, as if time simply blew it away. Left are artifacts of their existence: blue ceilings, white walls, pictures of O’Neill’s wife, the beautiful actress Carlotta Monterey, and of O’Neill himself, a slender, dapperly dressed, dignified-looking man with white hair at his temples and large brooding eyes.\n\nThere amid furniture and photos are suggestions of sound: a radio and the player piano O’Neill called Rosie; and of their lifestyle: a map from which O’Neill followed the events of World War II. There is Monterey’s bedroom, her Louis Vuitton trunk, the special niche and Gumps bed for their beloved Dalmatian, Blemie.\n\nGone are the smells of food cooking and noisy chickens in the barn, but Blemie’s bones remain. His grave sits on the hill, under a black walnut tree behind the barn. Engraved on the headstone is his formal name, “Silverdene Emblem.” And just outside the gravesite is Blemie’s last will and testament, written by O’Neill to comfort Monterey.\n\nWhile this rural setting inspired O’Neill’s work, it did not take away the pain of his subject matter.\n\nThough “Long Day’s Journey Into Night” comprises one day and night, it captures gut-wrenching histories, hopes and failures of O’Neill’s alcoholic actor father, his drug-addicted mother, his alcoholic brother and himself. (O’Neill suffered from alcoholism but quit drinking as a young man and never resumed.)\n\nHe knew this was his best play, but its creation was so painful that Monterey said he wept as he wrote. Some evenings at Tao House, she simply held him.\n\nBoth O’Neill and Monterey became interested in Eastern philosophy early in life, particularly in Taoism. They designed their new home according to feng shui, a Chinese concept of arranging structures and colors to be in harmony with cosmic energy.\n\nAs the main supervisor of construction, Monterey wanted Tao House to be a little Asian and a little Spanish and to hold their 8,000 books and her 300 pairs of shoes. Her main mission, however, was to create a secluded place for the “master” to work, a place he could be uninterrupted and concentrate. O’Neill also penned his acclaimed “A Moon For the Misbegotten” and “The Iceman Cometh” here, among other important works.\n\nHis office upstairs is the best-restored room - two desks so he could work on more than one play at a time, bookcases filled with works by his favorite authors, a line of pencils and, from his window a view of Mount Diablo. O’Neill sequestered himself here daily, composing only by hand.\n\nThe author suffered from neuritis, depression, periodic flu attacks, prostate problems and Parkinson’s-like hand tremors that made writing difficult. Still, he kept at it.\n\nEach morning, Monterey sharpened a dozen pencils, laid them on his tablet and left him alone. Later she would transcribe his work.\n\nIn time, as O’Neill’s tremors worsened, his writing grew so tiny that Monterey used a magnifying glass to read it. Examples of the dramatic changes in his penmanship lay in his study for visitors to see.\n\nO’Neill hoped his home in Danville would make a difference in his health. He wrote to a friend, “We have a beautiful site in the hills of the San Ramon Valley, with one of the most beautiful views I’ve ever seen. This is the final home and harbor for me. I love California. Moreover, the climate is one I know I can work and keep healthy in.”\n\nBut Tao House witnessed O’Neill’s failing health and the disaffection of his three children (from two previous marriages). Both sons suffered from addiction. The oldest, Eugene Jr., committed suicide before O’Neill died, as did his son Shane after O’Neill’s death.\n\nEnraged that his daughter, Oona, at 18 married Charlie Chaplin (who was more than 30 years her senior), O’Neill disowned her. Oona had eight children and a long marriage to Chaplin, but after he died in 1977, she also fell into addiction.\n\nWith the coming of World War II, the O’Neills’ longtime driver and friend, Herbert Freeman, joined the Marines. The war made keeping staff at Tao House impossible. For a time the couple relied on help from Danville residents, but eventually Monterey’s arthritis made their beloved home too much for her to manage.\n\nThe couple sold Tao House in 1944 and moved to the Huntington Hotel in San Francisco, then to New York the following year to help with production of his plays. “The Iceman Cometh” opened in 1946 to great reviews. “A Moon for the Misbegotten” followed in 1947 but was not well received.\n\nO’Neill had stipulated that “Long Day’s Journey Into Night” not be performed until 25 years after his death. Monterey, however, overrode that order, and the play opened to rave reviews in Stockholm on Feb. 10, 1956. Nine months later, it opened at the Helen Hayes Theatre in New York to mostly favorable reviews.\n\nThe last 10 years of O’Neill’s life were fraught with struggle, hospitals, a separation from Monterey and their reunion. At age 65, O’Neill died Nov. 27, 1953, in room 401 of the Sheraton Hotel on Bay State Road in Boston.\n\nRecalling that he had been born in a Times Square hotel, O’Neill whispered to Monterey just before he died: “I knew it. I knew it. Born in a hotel room, and God damn it, died in a hotel room.”\n\n“The Ranch” sold to a family in 1944. In the 1960s, when a developer tried to buy and subdivide the land, neighbors set up a foundation and stopped it. In 1975, Tao House was designated a National Historic Site, with the foundation working to preserve it as a place to “celebrate and promote the vision of America’s foremost playwright.”\n\nThroughout the year, the foundation offers a rich variety of programs, including retreats and the performance of O’Neill’s plays. Students also study the art of playwriting, and there is an artist-in-residence program.\n\nSandy Sims is a freelance writer living in San Jose."
