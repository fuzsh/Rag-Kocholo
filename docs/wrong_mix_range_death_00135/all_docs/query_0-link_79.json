        "text": "Abstract\n\nThis study involves the process of schizoanalysis, the production of desire, and desiring machine in the play of Eugene O’Neill, Strange Interlude. Emancipation of desire from the shackles of society and capitalism is shown in it. The rhizomatic study of desire, love, and past memories is also the focus of this study with special reference to the rhizome theory of Gilles Deleuze and Felix Guattari.\n\nKeywords\n\nschizoanalysis, desire, desiring machine, rhizomatic, rhizome theory, past memories\n\nWorks Cited\n\nAbbott, Michael. “The Curse of the Misbegotten: The Wanton Son in the Plays of Eugene O’Neill and Sam Shepard.” The Eugene O’Neill Review, vol. 18, no. 1/2, 1994, pp. 193–198.
