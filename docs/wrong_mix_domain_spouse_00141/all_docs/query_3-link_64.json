        "text": "Britney Spears’ ex-husband Kevin Federline is plotting to take the entertainer back to court for an increase in his child support checks, RadarOnline.com has learned.\n\nAccording to sources close to the situation, K-Fed, who shares sons Jayden James and Sean Preston with Britney, has had talks with his lawyers about the situation.\n\nAt the moment, Spears pays Federline $40k per month in child support. The amount was based on the parties sharing joint custody of the kids. However, Spears and her sons have been estranged for a bit and they recently moved to Hawaii with Federline, his wife and their children.\n\nSources told TMZ that Federline believes his child support should be higher since he has the kids 100% of the time.\n\nAs we previously reported, in May, Federline threatened to take Spears back to court if she didn’t sign off on him and their kids moving to Hawaii.\n\nHis lawyer, Mark Vincent Kaplan, claimed Federline’s wife Victoria Prince had a job offer and they needed to move quickly. The lawyer claimed Spears had not seen her children in over a year.\n\nAs we first reported, Spears’ powerhouse lawyer Mathew Rosengart fired off a letter to Federline’s attorney blasting his threats.\n\nAll this comes months after Federline claimed his move to Hawaii had nothing to do with some plot to increase his child support.\n\nHawaii allows parents to collect child support for children up to the age of 23 if they are enrolled in school. California only allows child support until the kid turns 18.\n\n“A lot of people say a lot of stupid things,” Federline said about the theory.\n\nLast month, Spears’ fans spread rumors that Federline was moving to the Aloha State so he could extend the number of years that she has to pay him child support."
