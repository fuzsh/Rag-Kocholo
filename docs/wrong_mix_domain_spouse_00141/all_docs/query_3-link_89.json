        "text": "(The Worst Albums Of All Time, Pt 2)\n\nI am going to need some potent inebriation for this article, one that, if I am to write comprehensively about the worst albums ever, requires my attention.\n\nThe sad man with the Monster Energy hat in the image above is Kevin Federline, former spouse of Britney Spears. He is known as a dancer, rapper, model, actor, and subject for every tabloid to tee off for some extra cash. As is customary with every story involving Britney Spears’ surrounding family, one of the most depressing topics that I will never expand upon here.\n\nIn case you, dear reader, are unaware, Kevin Federline shares custody with the children of Spears, a 16 year old named Jaden and 17 year old named Preston. Federline gained full custody of the children when Spears was placed under conservatorship in 2008.\n\nBut that aspect has already been covered en masse. What I am going to do with this article is get more positive for a minute here. Because Kevin Federline deserves just as much musical attention as his ex. Hell, he deserves even more attention.\n\nThe deep poeticism of his rapping cannot be overstated. When I hear how he is hated among America, I can absolutely see why. No wonder he has so many AR’s and so much money. No wonder he gets permission to wave his middle finger around. His sense of flow and rythym, his poignant originality…it makes me want to do this.\n\nFor I, too, love violence and money.\n\nNo I don’t. And I don’t understand this album. Playing With Fire by Kevin Federline, ladies and gentlemen. If you want to see the ultimate example of celebrity gone wrong, if you feel the urge to bathe in tabloid excess, this is the record for you. God save us.\n\nWHAT THE HELL WAS HE DOING?\n\nHaving married Britney Spears in 2004, Kevin Federline was tired of being in her shadow. Which, while it seemed selfish, made sense if one realized that, in 2004, Britney Spears was, for better or for worse, at the top of the pop landscape.\n\nFederline, formerly Spears’ backup dancer-yes, you read that right-wed the singer in a year where that marriage was the least notable thing Spears had done or had happen to her. Amidst not just the chart-topping hits like Toxic that Spears was putting out, Spears was getting herself into all kinds of headline-dominating trouble.\n\nAfter being married to Jason Alexander for 55 hours, Spears seemed to have the entire attention of the media on her every move-be it her pussycat doll outfit on her birthday, her first frolick with Federline during the spring, or her simplest cat purchase.\n\nWhether Federline felt jealous is anyone’s guess-nonetheless, he decided that he wanted to record an entire album himself. And thus…Britney Spears financed the album, releasing his creativity unto the masses (Oh, the irony).\n\nFederline strikes one as craving attention. Either that, or he has something missing in his soul. And I do not just mean the fact that he was jealous of Spears’s recording output-which, let’s face it, is devastatingly mediocre. Federline left a pregnant wife and child for the singer. People consistently murmured about his selfishness and toxicity behind the scenes.\n\nStephen Thomas Erlewine puts it best in his review: “gossip mavens reveled in his loutish behavior, which was the only accomplishment outside of paternity he could call his own.” Thus, Federline was desparate to not just be the side tabloid junkie of Spears’s loneliness. He wanted to make something of his own.\n\nAnd we are left with a musical output that reeks of unwanted attention-grabbing.\n\nFIRST SINGLES\n\nThe first single, “Y’all Aint Ready”, released in 2005, and established Federline as a rich wannabe.\n\nHe certainly has a mild sense of rhythym: the beat on this song is a decent tinge of suspense music mixed with what sounds like the remnant of Afrobeat. I’d probably listen to the instrumental alone and survive. Unfortunately, we have to try and make sense of Federline’s lyrics as well, a patently uninspired dosage of bragging.\n\nApparently, he is our “daddy”, and we don’t have a clue about his skill. I wonder what Federline’s father thinks of his mean antics behind the scenes of his fame. Federline also tells us he has multiple clones of famed Opera singer Luciano Pavarotti following him for magazines every day of the week. Whether he meant paparazzi, or doesn’t understand vocabulary, is an open question.\n\nThis only got worse, as Federline released a song that will get me canceled for writing about it. Ladies and gentlemen, the greatest rip-off of Brazilian Funk you will ever listen to, “PopoZaõ.\n\nCalling this Brazilian Funk is generous. It sounds more like what a computer spits out using the powers of artificial intelligence when it is told to play Brazilian Funk. The shouts and cymbals do not sound real in the slightest, and the actual instrumentation is pathetically unoriginal. And then, Federline unleashes the most depressing rapping you will ever hear. He makes Will I Am weep. Seriously.\n\nI don’t know whether Federline tries to deliver an actual innuendo, or if he simply wants to dance in a club like every lewd 2000s pop star, but he fails at both tasks miraculously with such lines as “toy all your thing on me, baby,” and rhymes kitty, titty, and city in the same line. Not to mention he fails to deliver anything beyond one verse and a repetitive chorus.\n\nUnfortunately, Federline debuted another song, Lose Control, at the Teen’s Choice Awards, forcing his sad, decrepit sound onto the ears of millions of high schoolers the globe over. This would be the first song off of his album; one that certainly played with the fire of millions of burning rap mixtapes screaming in horror and agony before his feet.\n\nPLAYING WITH FIRE-FEDERLINE BURNS MUSIC TO THE GROUND\n\nAfter an introduction that repeats the strange father trope by introducing children asking their grandfather to recount Kevin Federline, he responds with an album that is obnoxious, repetitive, and as trite as they come.\n\nThe World Is Mine introduces us to more computer-generated clanking hip hop, while Federline proclaims how he doesn’t care what we think of him. Given the quality of this song, that is probably a good thing. It doesn’t get better on America’s most hated; Federline continues to brag about saying “fuck the globe”, and sabotages his own attempt at self motivation with forced lines about drugs.\n\nPerhaps the most stunning thing about how the album starts is that it’s mostly boring. For as much as these descriptions that I write are vivid and quite entertaining (I hope), the songs blend into each other. They consist of the same cliches about how great Federline is, using the same tired rap techniques, over and over again.\n\nIn fact, this is why the album is so awful: Federline resorts to trodden, ill-advised ground over and over and over again in order to get his vague point across. “Snap” is just a copy of every Snoop Dogg groove ever, filled with Federline calling his haters chicken heads. Lose Control gets slightly interesting with a loud piano blast, and then ruins its own potential with an obnoxious turn-of-the-aughts get-wasted party anthem.\n\nFederline also seems to focus on how great it is that he is married to Britney Spears. Like, a lot. To the point where it’s disturbing, where a certain term for these men involving mining for gold nuggets might apply. While name-dropping Spears would be fine if he was talking about his deep love, he seems to just brag about her in blowhard, selfish terms, proclaiming his love of gained wealth.\n\nAnd then, of course, Federline turns right around and shoots for all of the stereotypes of how male rappers talk about women-only without any of the character irony at all. On “Dance With a Pimp” (save me), he talks about going to a bar like Urban Meyer to…you know. (I sense a repeated theme amongst rich men with marital problems).\n\nAnother surprise: the album gets repetitive the longer it goes. Federline retrods the same themes of bragging and how bad he is and how your envy should be out the roof on “A League Of My Own”. Meanwhile the instrumentation is a tired trap beat that sounds far too much like earlier songs to be included.\n\nOne of the few points of originality we get to in the second half of the record is when Britney herself shows up on “Crazy.” Even then, the results are intensely disturbing. Britney seems to buy into Federline’s gold-digging hook line and sinker, shrilly proclaiming of how she must be insane for marrying him. Where we could see a sign of decent connective collaboration, we instead get what may or may not be an attempt at irony that instead comes off as pretentious.\n\nFederline does occasionally get decent flow going, but shoots himself in the foot with lines that are flat out cringe-inducing: Playing With Fire seriously HAD to feature a line about Bisquick clogging up the stereo. It also might be a terrible attempt at a sexual innuendo, which I never want to think about again if so.\n\nUltimately, the album starts off by being bad, and doesn’t change the formula even slightly. And to make matters worse, it comes across as a sad copy of what Federline seems to think the faint tip of West Coast Hip Hop is-none of the meaning, only the sex and drugs and money.\n\nIN CONCLUSION\n\nFederline is a problematic figure who never should have been in a recording studio. He constantly cliches and strongmans his way through every line on this record, and there is no end in sight to the torment until the album ends.\n\nUnfortunately, this album is a cautionary tale on the power of celebrity. Whatever Spears was thinking, the man that she married turned out to not be a source that helped her get better, instead capitalizing on the money and fame.\n\nSpears and Federline went on to divorce after Spears had her second child in 2006, per Business Insider. This preceded a complete public breakdown from Britney, who was eventually put under a 13 year conservatorship by her father. Federline fought for full custody of the children amidst the negotiations, and won, yet allowed Spears visits.\n\nThe good news is that Federline appears to be making a genuine attempt to be a good dad, as Insider also talked about him and Spears collaborating on trying to raise the children-even with their respective new partners in tow. Whatever Federline had done to smash apart his image during the album seems to have moderated itself.\n\nNonetheless, we are still left with this album. And dear god, is it a lesson in how to not make rap."
