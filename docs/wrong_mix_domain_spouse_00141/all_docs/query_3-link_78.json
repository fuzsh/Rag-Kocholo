        "text": "A lot of undue fuss has already been made about Britney spouse and would-be rap star Kevin Federline's upcoming appearance on CSI: Crime Scene Investigation, but I couldn't help but yelp with glee when I received the below images in my electronic inbox a few moments ago.\n\nI think they speak for themselves.\n\nEven with his jaunty cap and vacantly menacing expression, there's no missing real acting talent at work here.\n\nHere's what the CBS press machine had to say about the episode:\n\n\"The CSI team investigates a series of brutal tourist beatings that take place within the span of a few hours throughout the Las Vegas area, on CSI: CRIME SCENE INVESTIGATION, Thursday, October 12 (9:00-10:00 PM, ET/PT) on the CBS Television Network. Kevin Federline guest stars as Cole Tritt, an arrogant teenager who harasses Nick and Warrick at a crime scene.\"\n\nIf that's not enough to tempt you into watching, you can check out a preview clip of the soon-to-be-classic episode here. It's a sleezy wannabe \"acting\" at its very finest.\n\nI don't know about you, but something tells me this might just be the most hilarious episode of CSI yet.\n\nLabels\n\nLost fans: you don't have to make your way to the island via Ajira Airways in order to ask a question of the creative team or the series' stars. Televisionary is taking questions from fans to put to Lost 's executive producers/showrunners Damon Lindelof and Carlton Cuse and stars Matthew Fox (\"Jack Shephard\"), Evangeline Lilly (\"Kate Austen\"), and Michael Emerson (\"Benjamin Linus\") for a series of on-camera interviews taking place this weekend. If you have a specific question for any of the above producers or actors from Lost , please leave it in the comments section below . I'll be accepting questions until midnight PT tonight and, while I can't promise I'll be able to ask any specific inquiry due to the brevity of these on-camera interviews, I am looking for some insightful and thought-provoking questions to add to the mix. So who knows: your burning question might get asked after all.\n\nEvery story begins with thread. It's up to the storyteller to determine just how much they need to parcel out, what pattern they're making, and when to cut it short and tie it off. With last night's penultimate season finale of Lost (\"The Incident, Parts One and Two\"), written by Damon Lindelof and Carlton Cuse, we began to see the pattern that Lindelof and Cuse have been designing towards the last five seasons of this serpentine series. And it was only fitting that the two-hour finale, which pushes us on the road to the final season of Lost , should begin with thread, a loom, and a tapestry. Would Jack follow through on his plan to detonate the island and therefore reset their lives aboard Oceanic Flight 815 ? Why did Locke want to kill Jacob? What caused The Incident? What was in the box and just what lies in the shadow of the statue? We got the answers to these in a two-hour season finale that didn't quite pack the same emotional wallop of previous season\n\nI may just have to change my original \"What I'll Be Watching This Fall\" post, as I sat down and finally watched CBS' new crime drama Smith this weekend. (What? It's taken me a long time to make my way through the stack of pilot DVDs.) While it's on following Gilmore Girls and Veronica Mars on Tuesday nights (10 pm ET/PT, to be exact), I'm going to be sure to leave enough room on my TiVo to make sure that I catch this compelling, amoral drama. While one can't help but be impressed by what might just be the most marquee-friendly cast in primetime--Ray Liotta, Virginia Madsen, Jonny Lee Miller, Amy Smart, Simon Baker, and Franky G all star and Shohreh Aghdashloo has a recurring role--the pilot's premise alone earned major points in my book: it's a crime drama from the point of view of the criminals, who engage in high-stakes heists. But don't be alarmed; it's nothing like NBC's short-lived Heist . Instead, think of it as The Italian"
