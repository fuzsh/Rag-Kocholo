        "text": "Re: I'M BORED...THAT MUST MEAN CELEB GOSSIP TIME!!!\n\nUHHHHOHHHHH!! NO PRE-NUP!!\n\nSimpson was back in L.A. on Sunday and life seemed to continue much as it had before the breakup announcement: She hit a tanning salon and showed off her diamond ring-free finger to paparazzi.\n\nLachey, 32, meanwhile, indulged in some testosterone-fueled activities on Turkey Day, with 'Extra' reporting that the sometime ESPN commentator watched football with his pals in L.A.\n\nThis guy time comes on the heels of his recent 'boys' weekend' in Miami Beach, where, according to People, he and recently separated buddy A.J. DiScala 'unwittingly' wandered into a salacious soiree hosted by Hustler publisher Larry Flynt and hirsute porn veteran Ron Jeremy (they quickly exited). Lachey also chatted up a 'pretty blonde guest' at another bash, says the mag.\n\n'Nick seems relieved that it's all finally out in the open,' a snitch tells the apparently now plugged-in Star. 'I think he feels he can now start getting on with his own life at last. He's really sad that things didn't work out between them but it hasn't been working for a very long time and it's probably been torturous to keep things together for so long.'\n\nAccording to the insider, 'As far as Nick is concerned he's going to keep things very clean and he's adamant that he's not going to get involved in any mud slinging and name calling. He just wants to be able to move on to living the rest of his life with as much dignity as he can.'\n\nDignity may be in short supply given Lachey's upcoming plans. The Hollywood Reporter says he's just signed on to star in an in-development WB sitcom, playing a newly married baseball player. No word on whether his small-screen bride will be blonde, buxom and unable to tell the difference between seafood and poultry.\n\nMeanwhile, there's already speculation as to how the nixed 'Newlyweds' are going to divvy up their assets. If there's no prenup, as has been reported, they will have to split everything 50-50.\n\nWhile this arrangement worked out fine for Brad Pitt and Jennifer Aniston, whose holdings were about equal, Simpson, 25, with her cosmetics and clothing empires (and her ability to carry off an itty-bitty bikini on the big screen), is said to be worth millions more than her less-marketable (but far more thrifty) hubby.\n\n'... A while back, Joe was complaining to everyone who would listen about all the alimony Jessica would have to pay Nick,' an insider told Us.\n\nRe: I'M BORED...THAT MUST MEAN CELEB GOSSIP TIME!!!\n\nI agree....she is an attention whore...\n\nEver since they did the newlywed show she ate up the attention and he just wanted to site back and enjoy life for what it was\n\nI happen to like Jess- but she was far to young to marry and they were at very different points in there lives- almost a 10 year age difference\n\nI probably would have behaved the same way if fame and fortune hit me so quick and so young\n\nand her father is NO help and Nick is no angel-\n\nI feel bad for both of them-\n\nRe: I'M BORED...THAT MUST MEAN CELEB GOSSIP TIME!!!\n\nPosted by Beth1210\n\nI agree....she is an attention whore...\n\nEver since they did the newlywed show she ate up the attention and he just wanted to site back and enjoy life for what it was\n\nI happen to like Jess- but she was far to young to marry and they were at very different points in there lives- almost a 10 year age difference\n\nI probably would have behaved the same way if fame and fortune hit me so quick and so young\n\nand her father is NO help and Nick is no angel-\n\nI feel bad for both of them-\n\nI agree w/ the latter. Until we too have had ourselves in that position we can't really speak about their attitudes towards life. She is still young, and not that smart so to say. If all of that fame, and fortune came my way I can say I wouldn't be that way, but I won't really know until it happens to me.\n\nBut their situation truly is sad, but thats Hollywood for you. Your realationship is always under the radar\n\nRe: I'M BORED...THAT MUST MEAN CELEB GOSSIP TIME!!!\n\nPosted by smurray\n\nPosted by Beth1210\n\nI agree....she is an attention whore...\n\nEver since they did the newlywed show she ate up the attention and he just wanted to site back and enjoy life for what it was\n\nI happen to like Jess- but she was far to young to marry and they were at very different points in there lives- almost a 10 year age difference\n\nI probably would have behaved the same way if fame and fortune hit me so quick and so young\n\nand her father is NO help and Nick is no angel-\n\nI feel bad for both of them-\n\nI agree w/ the latter.

Your realationship is always under the radar\n\nYep, that's so right.\n\nRe: I'M BORED...THAT MUST MEAN CELEB GOSSIP TIME!!!\n\nRioting in Paris Subsides: It's definitely been a bad week for Paris Hilton. First there was that late-night fender bender with beau Stavros Niarchos trying to drive with a jacket over his head. And now the Star is reporting that things are splitsville for Hilton and her billion-heir beau. The last straw may have been the $100,000 bill Stavros had to pay at the Hard Rock Hotel in Las Vegas for trashing his hotel room. Paris reportedly was hanging with Kelly Osbourne upstairs in Stavros' suite when a pillow fight got out of hand. Somehow, a table got thrown and broke a sprinkler head, which wound up damaging four rooms. Star's snoopers say Stavros is tired of Paris always pushing to 'party hard like rock stars.' Meanwhile, the Enquirer is reporting that Stavros has had his allowance cut off by papa Philip Niarchos until he dumps Paris. All of this may help explain why Paris, according to news reports, already has a new pet: a monkey-like kinkajou named Baby Luv. But even this liaison is proving problematic.\n\nThe kinkajou reportedly bit and scratched Paris' face while they were shopping for lingerie in a Hollywood boutique. We're just guessing here, but we think Baby Luv may have been displeased with the lingerie Paris chose for him.\n\nRe: I'M BORED...THAT MUST MEAN CELEB GOSSIP TIME!!!\n\nBritney Spears is reportedly looking to powers beyond to solve her marital woes. She’s said to have consulted a psychic.\n\nThe singer sought help from the supernatural after her hubby, Kevin Federline, reportedly refused to see a therapist.\n\n“She’s willing to have a third party arbitrate the problems,” a friend told the upcoming issue of Life & Style Weekly, but her spouse of 15 months allegedly refused, saying, “That’s for crazy people. If you want to see a shrink, go by yourself.”\n\nSo Brit went to the psychic. “She wants to know if Kevin will cheat, if they’ll have another child and if the marriage will last,” the pal said. Spears, who is said to be up for a role in Broadway’s “Sweet Charity,” also asked the psychic if it would be a good idea to find a role in the play for her hubby, according to the mag. The psychic said that would just mean more problems. Spears’ rep didn’t return calls for comment.\n\nIn happier news, Spears reportedly went on a shopping spree in ABC Carpet in Manhattan and dropped $30,000 at Michal Negrin’s jewelry shop there in less than a half an hour. “She was sweet and polite,” a store employee reported. “She just went in and out.”"
