        "text": "run through Feb. 13, 2008\n\nMarc Jacobs: Now Appearing in Comments Sections!In the wake of last week’s madness, Times fashion critic Cathy Horyn had a moment to catch her breath just long enough to nurse her flu and reflect on the direction of New York fashion. On her blog, she mentioned that illness had kept her from the Temple of Marc — an admission, it seems, that was enough to garner a response from the man himself.\n\nvideo look book Feb. 13, 2008\n\nFashion Week Exhausting Even to ‘Teen Vogue’ EditorToward the end of Fashion Week, Amy Larocca crossed paths with Mary Kate Steinmiller, an editor at Teen Vogue. A Fashion Week veteran, Steinmiller claims that “you don’t even realize you’re going from show to show because there’s so much adrenaline.” However, she did concede that wearing heels for days at a time was rough: “Tomorrow, it might be a flat day.” See whom Steinmiller spotted at Miss Sixty by watching the Video Look Book.\n\nrun through Feb. 11, 2008\n\nGet in Bed With Thom BrowneWere you cold sleeping last night? Are your pockets deep? If so, consider getting in bed with Thom Browne. The designer is looking for a financial partner, according to WWD. He’s not saving money on his fashion shows, nor would we want him to. After all, as Amy Larocca put it, “they are the only shows we’ve ever been to in which the audience frequently laughs out loud.” Browne’s spring/summer ‘08 show featured lifeguards and palm trees, and his fall ‘08 line, as Cathy Horyn wrote, “offered the long-awaited thrill of seeing two men share the same trouser leg.” WWD takes care to note that Browne isn’t acting out of financial desperation (Browne also designs the Black Fleece capsule collection of men’s and women’s clothes for Brooks Brothers, and his signature collection is sold at Bergdorf Goodman). Nevertheless, cold, wealthy folk looking for something original to put their money into could do a lot worse. Thom Browne said ‘Open’ to Financial Partnership [WWD]\n\nloose threads Feb. 11, 2008\n\nFashion Week Starts in London; Marc Jacobs Dances Dirty With Two People at His After-Party• New York said farewell to Fashion Week, but don’t be sad! It’s not really over — it just moved to London, where shows began yesterday on a sober note, signified by the appointment of the prime minister’s wife as spokesperson. Look for slideshows on nymag.com soon. [Guardian]\n\nparty lines Feb. 9, 2008\n\nHow Marc Jacobs Started (Almost) on Time, and Why Rachel Zoe Was LateMarc Jacobs kicked off last night’s show punctually at 7:20 p.m.  we told you on time was the new trend!  leaving the likes of Nina Garcia to tiptoe in halfway through, and Rachel Zoe to throw a screaming tantrum when she was completely shut out. We just happened to be chatting with Jacobs at the after-party at 24 Lexington Avenue when Zoe showed up to tell him the whole sorry tale.\n\nshow & tell Feb. 8, 2008\n\nRachel Zoe Throws a Tantrum at Marc JacobsA spy at Marc Jacobs reports the following: Rachel Zoe was seen screaming and cursing because she couldn’t get into the Marc Jacobs show. She tried to fight her way in through the bouncers, but they pushed her back. She ran off to her Town Car while the other celebs enjoyed mini-bottles of Moët and an on-time show inside.\n\nshow & tell Feb. 8, 2008\n\nSpecial Moments Backstage at Sean JohnWe had a lot of downtime backstage at the Sean John show, which gave us a good chance to hang out with the male models and drink Bellinis (we know, life is hard). Nearby was a makeshift “stage”: bright lights and a backdrop, evidently where Diddy had been doing his interviews earlier.\n\nrun through Feb. 8, 2008\n\nBreaking: The K-Fed Has Landed at Fashion Week!Hot on the heels of yesterday’s rumors that Kevin Federline would be sitting in Marc Jacobs’s front row, we have now spotted K-Fed at the Sean John show at Cipriani 42nd Street. If we were the betting kind — and our twelve-step sponsor says we are — we’d say Sean John is just K-Fed’s warm-up act (with all due respect to Mr. Combs). If he’s here, it all but confirms that El Fed will be sweating out the six-hour wait at Marc Jacobs. As any self-respecting tabloid fixture would!\n\nnew york fugging city Feb. 8, 2008\n\nPETA Finally Gets Aggressive at Donna KaranWhen we emerged from the cab at the Donna Karan show on Friday afternoon, we finally got our first gander at some PETA protesters. There were only two of them, but they had gone all out, as apparently Donna Karan is currently PETA’s Public Enemy Number One, judging from how people are breaking into her house and whatnot.\n\nvideo look book Feb. 8, 2008\n\n‘Times’ Fashion Editor Gets Off Herrera’s BlacklistNew York Times fashion editor Karla Martinez was looking forward to the Carolina Herrera show when Amy Larocca and our cameras saw her earlier this week. “We haven’t been invited for the two years that I’ve been [at the Times],” she said. “I think there were some bad reviews that had been written in the past.” Scandalous! Watch the Video Look Book for more hard truths about Fashion Week.\n\nrun through Feb. 8, 2008\n\nFashion World Responds to Marc Bribery Scandal With Resounding ShrugWhile most of the Regular World got their off-brand panties in a bunch over the allegations that the superintendent of the 69th Regiment Armory took a hefty amount of bribes from the likes of Marc Jacobs so that the designer could hold his shows (including tonight’s) in the dramatic space, the Fashion World could barely manage a yawn.\n\nshow & tell Feb. 8, 2008\n\nSlightly Different Universe at Custo BarcelonaHaving spent most of our week clustered amongst French folk, we welcomed the change to hang with their fun southern neighbors from Spain at yesterday’s Custo Barcelona show. As we don’t speak Spanish, we were sadly unable to understand any of the conversations happening around us, but actions speak louder than foreign languages.\n\nshow & tell Feb. 8, 2008\n\nCelebs and Alumni Pick Their Winner at ‘Project Runway’ FinaleEvery year we wonder: Is this when people stop caring about Project Runway? Judging from the clamor in and around the tents this morning (we could hear them shouting, “Rami! Rami!” from a block away), we believe the answer is no.\n\nmodel tracker Feb. 8, 2008\n\nAli Stephens Is Thursday’s Top ModelThursday’s catwalks were full of unexpected moments. Karen Elson took a tumble closing Zac Posen and Diddy helped her up. Aussie Abbey Lee flashed her nipple piercing beneath a sheer top at an otherwise demure Calvin Klein show. Former cross-country runner Ali Stephens opened Klein for an impressive debut on Stateside runways. She’s our top girl to watch this week and takes Thursday herself. Kendall Herbst\n\nloose threads Feb. 8, 2008\n\nPETA Invades Donna Karan’s Apartment; More Black Models on the Runway• PETA says it managed to get an operative into Donna Karan’s home yesterday. The young woman tricked her way past Karan’s assistant by using a fashionable outfit and a tray of soy lattes. When Karan showed up, the infiltrator put on a DVD of animals being harvested for their pelts. [NYP] • Runway model vet Karen Elson fell down as she closed Zac Posen’s show, and Sean “Diddy” Combs and Caroline Trentini helped her up. [The Cut]\n\nrun through Feb. 8, 2008\n\nFashion Week Show-Hopping Wears on Anna and SuzyFor all of Fashion Week’s pretty clothes, we’re exhausted, and our under-eye circles are kinda ugly. But at least we’re not the only ones feeling a bit worn out. “You’re running all over town, and nobody’s thinking through how much time you spend in a taxi or car,” said Vogue queen bee Anna Wintour at Thursday’s 3.1 phillip lim show.\n\nnew york fugging city Feb. 8, 2008\n\nWe’re Forced to Get on Our Knees at HilfigerBecause it took us 45 minutes to get to Lincoln Center in rush-hour traffic, we might have been a little late for Tommy Hilfiger. And because we might have been a little late for Tommy Hilfiger, we might have missed the chance to sit in our actual assigned seats. This may be how we ended up loitering in a glass-enclosed balcony, fighting for a spot past the folks in standing room who’d gotten there at a reasonable hour. And that’s how we found ourselves at our lowest Fashion Week point, both emotionally and physically: kneeling on the carpet, peering through people’s legs down at the front row below.\n\nnew york fugging city Feb. 8, 2008\n\nPlimpton’s Cute, Posey’s Ragged, and Price’s ScaredIt’s not often that we completely geek out for a celebrity, but when it happens, it’s generally only because we bump into someone from an Aaron Spelling drama and become embarrassingly unable to contain ourselves (like when we saw Nat From the Peach Pit at our grocery store and called out to him in the parking lot, which is practically against the law in California). Tragically, after a bottle of complimentary Prosecco at Cynthia Rowley’s show on Thursday, one such moment occurred in which our cool vanished like the Great Wall of China under David Copperfield’s mischievous hand.\n\nrun through Feb. 7, 2008\n\nModel Falls! And Diddy Helps a Damsel in DistressWe almost made it through Fashion Week without a model fall. The surprise, when one finally came at Zac Posen, was that it wasn’t a newbie who took the plunge, but runway vet Karen Elson — as she was closing the show, no less. Brazilian bombshell Caroline Trentini helped her up, with help from Sean John (as Diddy/Puffy/Sean Combs is now calling himself) who chivalrously stepped onto the runway to extend a hand. Maybe he’s a gentleman after all. Elson later came out smiling with Posen for his bow. —Kendall Herbst\n\nreviews Feb. 7, 2008\n\nSubdued, Modest Chic at Calvin KleinFrancisco Costa, the designer at Calvin Klein, takes his mandate as New York’s minimalist-in-chief quite seriously. His commitment to the line is admirable: Each of the looks in today’s collection could’ve been cut with laser. The palette was navy, black, and gray; any bits of flash were subdued, in some cases beneath a layer of sheer cashmere.\n\nnew york fugging city Feb. 7, 2008\n\nAli Larter: Half a Shirt Short, and Moody to BootLindsay Lohan was rumored to appear at the Calvin Klein show on Thursday, but we saw neither hide nor hair of the leggings-loving former redhead. Tragic, yet not surprising: LiLo seems like the sort to ditch. We also wondered if we’d see Kate Bosworth, since she’s appearing on CK billboards all over town.\n\nrun through Feb. 7, 2008\n\nBreaking: No Celebs at Posen? Seriously?That’s the word in the tents right now, anyhow. Apparently he wants to lose the flash factor and have tonight be about the clothes. Now that’s just crazy talk. The show’s supposed to start at 8 p.m. (or, y’know, 8:45). More as we know it.\n\nreviews Feb. 7, 2008\n\nCritics Hail Marchesa and Marc by Marc JacobsPerhaps giddy from the unseasonable weather, critics were warm to Michael Kors and Rodarte and practically red-hot with lust for Marchesa and Marc by Marc Jacobs. Consider these adjectives (used in reviews) in order of increasing positivity: “almost camp,” “high-polish,” and “exuberant.” Find out which designer drove critics to the thesaurus in our review roundup.\n\nparty lines Feb. 7, 2008\n\nDonna Karan Is a Proactive ParanoiacDiane Von Furstenberg and Narciso Rodriguez were glowing and ready to party at last night’s Gucci/Madonna-hosted benefit for UNICEF and Raising Malawi at the U.N. But then, their shows were already over. Donna Karan was less sanguine. Her show isn’t until tomorrow, and, like a fretful mother, she worried about being away from her collection for too long. “I’m nervous,” Karan said.\n\nrun through Feb. 7, 2008\n\nToday in Marc Jacobs Rumors: K-Fed to Sit Front Row?!There may be a bribery scandal floating around the 69th Regiment Armory, but Marc Jacobs’s show will still go on tomorrow night at the scene of the crime (bets are still out, however, on how many hours late he’ll start). As Marc is the show of the week, rumors are flying about the blogosphere like they’re, dare we say, going out of style. Cathy Horyn heard that Sonic Youth would be playing at the show and found it hilarious (why that’s so funny, we have no idea).\n\nshow & tell Feb. 7, 2008\n\nBright Colors, Cool Necklaces, and Happy Vibes at Zero Maria CornejoThere was something really special about Zero Maria Cornejo’s show yesterday afternoon, held in the designer’s new, unfinished store on Bleecker Street. We were far away from the tents, it was balmy outside, and inside, the white-box space was simple and lovely, with daylight streaming in the windows. We were already feeling fuzzy, and that was before the clothes even appeared — though once they did, we were a little mesmerized."
