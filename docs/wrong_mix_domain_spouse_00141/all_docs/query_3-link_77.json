        "text": "Britney Spears dances in new Instagram video\n\nBritney Spears is reportedly \"relieved\" that her eldest son, Sean Preston Federline, is about to turn 18 in two weeks.\n\nOnce Sean comes of age, the Toxic singer will no longer be oligated to pay her ex-husband Kevin Federline a vast amount in child support anymore for the teenager.\n\nA source told the Daily Mail: \"Britney is relieved that Sean is turning 18 on September 14 because she is tired of paying Kevin the insane amount of money he is getting.\"\n\nThey added: \"Britney is happy to help Sean and Jayden. There is nothing she wouldn't do for her sons. But this would go directly to them after they turn 18 instead of Kevin.\"\n\nThe source also said that friends of Spears believe \"it's time for Kevin to get a job.\"\n\nREAD MORE 'Clues' on Britney's wedding day hinted at divorce from Sam just a year later\n\nEarlier this year, Federline moved with Sean, Jayden and his other four kids to Hawaii, where his current wife, Victoria Prince, reportedly got a teaching position at the University of Hawaii.\n\nIn California, a parent stops paying child support when their child graduates high school, or turns 18 - whichever comes first.\n\nHowever, child support laws differ in Hawaii; a parent can collect child support until the kid turns 23 if their child is enrolled in a college or a vocational school.\n\nSean graduated high school in June.\n\nHowever, under the revised statute 576B-611 (2016) if child support was established in another state then the state in which it was established has exclusive jurisdiction, stating verbatim: \"In a proceeding to modify a child support order, the law of the state that is determined to have issued the initial controlling order governs the duration of the obligation of support.\"\n\nDon't miss...\n\nBritney Spears 'rejects lucrative Insta deals' but still posts raunchy videos [REPORT]\n\nBritney Spears gets tattoo on ring finger - but many fans miss 'hidden' video [LATEST]\n\nBritney Spears slaps butt in naughtiest vid yet with intriguing 'liars' caption [INSIGHT]\n\nSo, Spear's child support payments for Sean will end on September 14.\n\nShe will still be required to pay child support for Jayden, 16, until he turns 18 on September 12, 2024.\n\nSpears married Federline in 2004 and divorced him three years later in 2007.\n\nHe was not able to get spousal support due to an iron-tight prenup.\n\nA year after their divorce, Spears had a mental breakdown that had her locked into a conservatorship under her 71-year-old dad, Jamie, from 2007 until 2021.\n\nAs a result, Federline got sole physical and legal custody of the Sean and Jayden.\n\nIn May 2018, he requested an increase in child support for both of their sons by $40,000 a month - from $20,000 to $60,000.\n\nJamie rejected Federline's initial request.\n\nThe case was then sealed and it is not known if Federline ever recieved an increase.\n\nCourt documents at the time stated that Spears paid an extra $15,000 a month for school and extracurricular activities, bringing the total payments made to her ex-husband each month to $35,000.\n\nSo, for the past 15 years, the singer has been paying a minimum of $420,000 a year to Federline.\n\nThe documents also said that she paid Jamie $128,000 a year to act as her conservator and $384,126.38 for other expenses, including bills and food.\n\nAt the time, her net worth was determined to be $56.5 million."
