        "text": "LAHAINA, HAWAII: Britney Spears’s ex Kevin Federline, 45, was seen strolling on the idyllic beaches of Hawaii with his current wife Victoria Prince, 40, amid the decrease of child support amount from the Grammy-winning songstress.\n\nFederline, who moved his family to Hawaii in June, was seen for the first time since their relocation to the island state.\n\nKevin Federline and Victoria Prince’s relationship\n\nFollowing the split of Federline and Spears in 2007, the basketball player and background dancer met Prince in 2008.\n\nPrince, who was a force to reckon with in volleyball, soon started dating Federline and the couple welcomed their first child - a daughter Jordan Kay Federline, 12, in 2011.\n\nThe couple tied the knot in an intimate ceremony in 2013 and welcomed their second daughter Peyton Marie Federline, nine, in 2014.\n\nPrince is now fully dedicated to the upbringing of Federline’s children and often shares sneak peeks from her domestic life on her Instagram.\n\nPer Daily Mail, Federline and Prince were seen enjoying a PDA-packed stroll on the beach in Hawaii.\n\nWhile the former background dancer was seen wearing a black t-shirt with captions supporting the fire-ravaged town of Lahaina, the mother of two was seen flaunting her athletic figure in a blue-patterned bikini top paired with a black bikini bottom.\n\nThe loved-up couple was also seen locking lips passionately during their outing.\n\nKevin Federline is allegedly looking for an increase in child support\n\nApart from his two daughters with Prince, Federline is the father of two sons with Spears - Sean Preston Federline, 18, and Jayden James Federline, 17.\n\nEarlier this month, it was reported that as Sean Preston was turning 18 on September 14, Spears no longer had to pay Preston’s child support to Federline.\n\nThis would have brought the amount down to $20,000 from the earlier sum of $40,000 as Jayden has still not turned 18.\n\nAn insider close to the ‘Toxic’ singer told Daily Mail at the time, “Britney is relieved that Sean is turning 18 on September 14 because she is tired of paying Kevin the insane amount of money he is getting.”\n\nThey continued, “This would go directly to them after they turn 18 instead of Kevin,” referring to Britney’s two sons with whom the singer has been estranged for more than a year.\n\nThe source added that Britney’s friends believe “it's time for Kevin to get a job.”\n\nHowever, soon after, there was a rumor that Federline was looking forward to “ask for an increase in child support” from the ‘Oops…I did it again’ singer.\n\nA source told TMZ that he is “thinking of going to court” for an increase in the support amount.\n\nWhile Preston’s child support has presumably ended, Jayden’s support amount will stay intact till June 2025 when he graduates from school."
