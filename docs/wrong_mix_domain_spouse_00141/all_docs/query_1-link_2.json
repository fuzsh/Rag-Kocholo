I despise celebrity. I think it's ridiculous. It's so disgusting to me.\n\n\"When you see things in your private life torn apart it just makes you really sad, not sad for Britney Spears and Jessica Simpson. They want it, they have no right to complain because they've asked for it completely.\n\n\"I never asked for it. All I've wanted to do is write songs.\""
