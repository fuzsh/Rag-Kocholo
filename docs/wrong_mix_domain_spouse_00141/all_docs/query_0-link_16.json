        "text": "2005: Hollywood buzz recap\n\nThe year of 2005 kicked off with a bang in terms of celebrity caused buzz from break-ups, making-ups to typical celeb screw-ups keeping the gossip and rumour mills rolling and the tabloid press in very good business.\n\nCompiled by Rikaza Hassan\n\nOrlando Bloom and Kate Bosworth were reported to have split up after dating for nearly three years (more on that later). Destiny's Child's Kelly Rowland?s March wedding was reportedly postponed though she is yet to get married with the end of the year having already cometh.\n\nKelis and Nas got married after two years of dating, Michael Jackson?s trial began on the last day of the month (he was acquitted of the charges and Sony is reportedly coming to his aid to pay off his debts) and most intriguingly, a petition was launched to stop Ashlee Simpson from ever singing live again after her lip synching debacle of 2004 on the site www.stopashlee.com though it didn?t exactly work out for the petitioners since Ashlee went on to sing live before the end of the year.\n\nOne of the most significant and very long-lasting episodes in terms of the gossips also began anew with Jennifer Aniston and Brad Pitt confirming their separation of paths, putting an end to their four year long marriage.\n\nIt also brought forth a frenzy of rumours about the reason for their split: was Brad Pitt cheating on Jen with the oh-so hot Angelina Jolie since they began work together on Mr.& Mrs. Smith in 2004?\n\nJennifer promptly filed divorce papers in March which Brad readily signed, officially getting their divorce done with in October of last year.\n\nThe Bradgelina pair however continued to deny any romantic involvement between the two (at the end of the year they are still to release an official statement that says otherwise) though they were caught in the act, so to speak, when they registered in a single double room, posing as a married couple (Mr. and Mrs. Pilaf?) right after denying the affair during a publicity interview for their movie which premiered in June.\n\nAngelina went on to add to her adopted family by adopting then 6-month old Zahara Marley Jolie from Ethiopia, accompanied by Brad of course, who is also assisting her in her more charitable efforts (helping victims of the Pakistani quake, for instance). The African trip didn't fare that well with Pitt however with Brad admitting himself to hospital with severe stomach pains.\n\nBradgelina continued with their mooning, riding similar BMW bikes to go grocery shopping ? Brad even showed himself to be the man when he helped Jolie when her bike cropped up some troubles.\n\nAs Jolie and Pitt continued on what is alleged to be their very, very steamy sex life, Angelina treated little Maddox to a Mohawk hair cut, took him with her on her trips to less unfortunate regions and made statements to the press that she would not feed her kids with lies about the existence of Santa Claus or the Easter Bunny.\n\nAs for all the people out there seriously pissed off about their favourite pin-ups getting together and looking oh! so perfect together, for all those people praying that they break up nasty and soon, both Jolie and Pitt filed papers early last December to recognize Brad Pitt as the adoptive father to both of Jolie's kids and to change their last names to the hyphenated 'Jolie-Pitt'. It not only strengthened the seriousness of their relationship but also fueled rumours of a wedding in the near future.\n\nSimple Life star Nicole Ritchie found herself engaged to DJ boyfriend Adam Goldstein as well as a pink sapphire and diamond ring on her finger in February, while co-star Paris Hilton's cell phone got hacked into with all her phone numbers and e-mails being posted on the internet (definitely better than sex tapes I should think).\n\nTwo Months later the two former best friends saw the end of their friendship, swearing never to be friends again, though Paris' plans to kick Nicole out of the show did not work out. Paris went on to get engaged to Paris Lastis whose parents are as equally loaded as Hilton's.\n\nOctober however saw Hilton not only break up with her fianc, and start dating Mary-Kate Olsen?s ex (apparently Paris had a part to play in their break-up as well) but also auctioned off her engagement ring before the month was over to help victims of Hurricane Katrina, though it sold for only $2 million, less than half of what the other Paris paid for it. The end of the year also saw the end of her engagement and the fourth season of Simple Life will see the two heiresses play housewives to various families.\n\nBritney Spears marriage was reported to be on the rocks due to hubby Kevin Federline's excessive spending sprees but Brit set quiet the rumour mills, at least for awhile, by announcing her pregnancy.\n\nShe went on to give birth to a healthy baby boy, sold off the family pictures for a lump sum but soon after fought over Federline's spending. Britney threatened to take away his Porsche and threw him out of their house, but they got back together after Kevin promised to be good. Britney is now suing the US Weekly for $20 million on charges of falsely reporting that the couple had made a sex tape and were worried about its release.\n\nChristina Aguilera managed to up Britney once more with her relatively more conservative and prettier engagement to music executive boyfriend of two years, Jordan Bratman and her consequent nupitals in November. The celeb who can actually sing confessed that she found the moment overwhelming and that she has plans to have kids, the proper way that is.\n\nMarch saw Katie Holmes announce her split with fianc, since December 2003, Chris Klein before she started dating the 16 years older Tom Cruise. The month of June saw Katie get engaged to Cruise, gush about her new found love, get dropped from the sequel to Batman Begins and begin her conversion to Tom?s religion of Scientology.\n\nThe pregnant Holmes who is expecting her child somewhere in the end of January or beginning of February also had to sign a pre-nuptial agreement much to her blind surprise. Tom Cruise went on to buy an expensive sonograph machine so that the TomKat duo could check their baby whenever they felt like it at their home, coming under fire from the medical community. TomKat also paid a visit to friends Will Smith and his wife in Miami where Tom reportedly told reporters who besieged the two that they had got married in the night of the 15th of December.\n\nThe former Mrs. Pitt excited much sympathy from all as she seemed to be taking up the divorce pretty hard until she was spotted making out with her co-star Vince Vaughn that is. The two were spotted on many a hotel balcony and other hideaways kissing, hugging and Aniston even straddling Vaughn.\n\nThe two have denied the relationship as usual, but as for if this is just a rebound thing or the real deal for Jen, no one knows. Another Jennifer, the Alias one this time told the press of her intentions to quit acting, got married to fellow Daredevil actor Ben Affleck (Bennifer II?) and gave birth to their first child last month.\n\nWhile Affleck?s ex and now Mrs. Anthony had rumours laying her with child, the Jenny from the Block star is yet to show even a small bump in the abdominal region after months of speculation.\n\nThe Orlando Bloom-Kate Bosworth relationship tantalized us from the start of 2005 with the consecutive rumours flying around of their split and getting back together. The pair however may have got engaged however as The Sun reported the two lovers were spotted shopping for diamond rings together. Bosworth apparently chose a ring that cost more than $100,000.\n\nThe Simpson-Lachey union however did not fare as well. After rumours of rifts between the pair with Nick reportedly partying around and gambling in casinos, bad-mouthing his wife to whores while Jessica?s career soared and she spent increasing amounts of time away from him, the two confirmed their separation in late November last year and Simpson filed for divorce on the 16th of December.\n\nIn other news, Justin Timberlake and Cameron Diaz were reported to be engaged after Diaz was spotted wearing a flashy diamond ring. Diaz however went on to suffer from injury when she fell off her dresser, cutting her head in the process and requiring 19 stitches. The now recovered actress is planning a back packing trip to India with Kate Winslet this year in preparation for their next movie Holiday.\n\nKate Winslet also lost a lot of pounds and all of her voluptuous curves last year, looking withered and ugly, in an effort to beat her insecurities of being fat and get better movie offers reserved only for thin actresses.\n\nLindsay Lohan who usually manages to outrun the paparazzi in pursuit of her was caught in two car crashes last year due to the vociferous driving of the paparazzi. Lohan also lost a lot weight towards the latter year and got herself a boob job in an attempt to continue ot be on the top of the hot list. It is reported that Lindsay now has boobs up to her neck.\n\nBlack Sabbath vocalist Ozzy Osbourne's wife Sharon had breast enhancement surgery, going from a 32C to a 34DD only to announce that she will be reducing them to their old size due their weight and discomfirt.\n\nRenee Zellwegger got married to country singer Kenny Chesney in May after four months of dating, only to file for divorce in Septmber citing fraud though no specifics were revealed.\n\nHer ex and lead singer of White Stripes, Jack White wed model Karen Elson after only five weeks of dating and have already adopted a child. Demi Moore and Ashton Kutcher confirmed their marriage by the selling of their wedding pictures to OK! Magazine, Sherly Crow got engaged to seven time Tour de France winner Lance Armstrong and Scarlett Johansson moved in with Pearl Harbor star Josh Hartnett.\n\n2005 also saw Matt Damon get engaged to girlfriend Luciano Barroso and the couple is expecting their first child together later this year. Gwen Stefani is expecting her first child with husband Gavin Rossdale, Charlize Theron has turned down offers to play the Bond girl alongside Daniel Craig following Angelina Jolie and Scarlett Jahansson in the new movie Casino Royale.\n\nAnd to end it all, singer Moby has reserved a place on the space flight by Virgin Atlantic which will take place in the year 2010.\n\nThat basically wraps it up for the buzz in celebtown for the year 2005. Not to worry though as celebrities are bound to create pull more stunts, make stupid statements to the press and of course get married and divorced as many times as possible and the Oomph! magazine will be bringing it all right to your doorsteps."
