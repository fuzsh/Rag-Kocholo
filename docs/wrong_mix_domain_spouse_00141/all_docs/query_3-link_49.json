        "text": "As Britney Spears was checking out of rehab for the second time in a week Wednesday, her estranged husband was making plans to go to court amid a custody dispute over their two children.\n\nKevin Federline and his lawyer were scheduled to appear at a downtown courthouse Thursday for an emergency hearing, Superior Court spokesman Allan Parachini told the Associated Press. It was not known what issue Federline planned to raise.\n\nFederline and Spears have two sons, five-month-old Jayden James and 17-month-old Sean Preston.\n\n\"Our best information is he will be here; she won't,\" said Parachini. \"But anything is possible.\"\n\nFederline filed papers seeking spousal support and sole custody of the children after Spears sought to end their two-year marriage last November. A temporary court order issued Feb. 1 granted the couple joint custody until the end of this month.\n\nParachini said Federline's lawyer would try to persuade a Superior Court commissioner that the matter is urgent enough to be handled on an expedited basis.\n\nThe move comes amid increasingly bizarre behaviour by Spears, which culminated with her reportedly checking into and out of two rehab centres last week and shaving her head bald on Friday.\n\nSpears, 25, left the Promises Malibu Treatment Center on Wednesday, according to The Insider TV news magazine, less than a day after arriving at the facility that specializes in treating drug and alcohol abuse.\n\nLast week she reportedly sought treatment at a centre in the Caribbean but also checked out after a day.\n\nOK! magazine reported it has learned Spears fled rehab because she was worried Federline would move to obtain permanent custody of the couple's children while she was undergoing several weeks of treatment.\n\nFederline's agent, Allison Joyce, said the 28-year-old aspiring rapper and former backup dancer would have no comment.\n\nOf late, Spears has engaged in increasingly strange behaviour, showing up in public in skimpy outfits and sometimes minus her underwear.\n\nThen came what the tabloids have called a meltdown weekend when she arrived at a Los Angeles hair salon on Friday, grabbed an electric razor and shaved her head bald. Afterward, she visited a tattoo parlour where she had a pair of red-and-pink lips inked onto her wrist. Then she went out clubbing with friends before entering rehab at Promises on Tuesday.\n\nAfter leaving Promises on Wednesday, Spears attempted to keep a low profile but the celebrity website TMZ.com posted video of her wearing a wig and leaving what it said was a lawyer's office.\n\nSpears, whose 1999 debut album \"â€¦ Baby One More Time,\" sold more than 13 million copies, hasn't released a new album since 2003. Before her troubles began she had promised one this year."
