        "text": "Country star Blake Shelton filed for divorce from fellow singer-songwriter Miranda Lambert, his wife of six years, in July 2015. Pop star Gwen Stefani filed for divorce from rocker Gavin Rossdale, her husband of 13 years, in August 2015. By October 2015, Shelton and Stefani were an item, and they've been rubbing their relationship in the world's face ever since.\n\nAccording to TMZ, sources close to Rossdale claim the Bush frontman thinks the \"Make Me Like You\" singer accused him of cheating on her with the family nanny to distract the public from a potential affair with of her own with Shelton. Meanwhile, a source close to Lambert told E! News, \"She was not surprised to hear of the romance between Blake and Gwen. They were always pretty flirty. Miranda and Blake were on the rocks on and off and knew that this could always be a possibility.\"\n\nActor Wilmer Valderrama and pop star Demi Lovato had been together for nearly six years when they posted identical breakup announcements in June 2016. Lovato had made it clear pre-split that she was ready to accept a ring from the That '70s Show (1998-2006) star, but less than two months later, he was spotted on a date with Friday Night Lights (2006-09) star Minka Kelly. That wasn't the first time he'd allegedly rebounded with Kelly: Us Weekly reported that the two previously got together when he and Lovato were \"on a break\" in 2012.\n\nKelly wasn't just an alleged rebound chick for Valderrama. She also supposedly hooked up with Grey's Anatomy (2005-) star Jesse Williams almost immediately after he split from his wife of five years in April 2017.\n\nA source told Page Six that Kelly and Williams may have been involved while he was still married. \"They started seeing each other last year. He ended things with his wife this year,\" the source said. \"People know [about the relationship], but weren't saying anything because he was still married... He's going to wake up and be like, 'What did I do?' He has two children. This isn't Hollywood, where you can say 'cut.' [He and Minka] are in lust.\"\n\nHowever, a source close to the actor insisted he and Kelly never hooked up until a whopping three months after he and his wife separated. Either way, that's pretty quick.\n\nAnna Faris had two rapid-fire rebounds in a row, and at least one of them led to a divorce.\n\nIn her 2017 memoir Unqualified (via Us Weekly), Faris revealed that meeting actor Chris Pratt on the set of Take Me Home Tonight (2011) led to her divorce from first husband Ben Indra. \"The reality is that if I hadn't met Chris, my first marriage probably would have lasted until I found a different someone else. Chris was my cattle prod. I needed someone to come along and show me something different than the relationship I knew,\" she writes.\n\nShe wrote about her quick rebound with Pratt, calling it \"hot and heavy in a way that I'd never experienced before. You might think that, fresh off an almost decade long relationship, I would be hesitant to move on to the next, but I couldn't have fallen more headfirst into my feelings for Chris.\"\n\nFaris and Pratt, who share son Jack, announced their own separation in August 2017, after eight years of marriage. True to form, Faris reportedly moved on in September 2017 with cinematographer Michael Barrett.\n\nIn September 2010, less than three months after finalizing his divorce from Oscar-winner Sandra Bullock (which was infamously triggered by his cheating), People reported that Jesse James had rebounded with L.A. Ink (2007-11) reality TV star Kat Von D.\n\nVon D and James were engaged by January 2011, but it wouldn't last. In September 2011, before they walked down the aisle, James and Von D split for good. Von D later revealed that it was because James may not have been quite ready to stop sowing his wild oats post-Bullock. She alleged that he cheated on her with a whopping 19 different women.\n\nReese Witherspoon rebounded from her 2006 divorce from Cruel Intentions (1999) co-star Ryan Phillippe with her Rendition (2006) co-star Jake Gyllenhaal, but sources close to the Oscar winner said she may have moved too fast post-divorce and had to slow things down.\n\n\"As much as everyone thinks they're right there, they're really not near the whole marriage thing,\" a source told People in 2008. \"Jake would marry her tomorrow, but Reese doesn't want to go there yet, even though he would like to... There's a huge attraction between them, and they've becomes a team, partners, but Jake can be a little overbearing at times, and Reese is really happy with life right now.\"\n\nIn late November 2009, People reported that Witherspoon split from Gyllenhaal for good, but she moved on from him rather quickly too. By January 2010, she and talent agent Jim Toth went public with their own romance, and they got engaged after less than a year together. Toth and Witherspoon married in March 2011.\n\nTalk about wasting no time. In September 2013, the Daily Mail reported that on the same day actor Liam Hemsworth and then-fiancee Miley Cyrus announced their split, he was spotted in a hot and heavy make out session with actress Eiza Gonzalez.\n\nThe hookup didn't last long, however. In November 2013, a source told Hollywood Life, \"Liam told Miley he's not seeing Eiza anymore. He found out that she was tipping off photographers; she was totally using him! Miley is thrilled obviouslyâ€”it's street justice, especially after Eiza was so cocky about things.\"\n\nCyrus and Hemsworth have since reunited.\n\nIn December 2010, Deadpool (2016) star Ryan Reynolds filed for divorce from Lucy (2014) leading lady Scarlett Johansson. By February 2011, she was all over Oscar-winner Sean Penn. The new pair flaunted their PDA in a whirlwind, worldwide romance, from an impromptu trip to Mexico in March 2011 to holding hands at the White House Correspondents Dinner that April.\n\nBy June 2011, Us Weekly reported that Penn and Johansson had called it quits, with a source dishing that Penn didn't want anything \"serious,\" claiming, \"Scarlett pursued him.\"\n\nJennifer Aniston and Vince Vaughn co-starred in The Break-Up (2006), which likely should have been an omen that their own romance may not last.\n\nAniston, who fresh off her highly publicized divorce from actor Brad Pitt, acknowledged the poor timing of her romance with Vaughn in the November 2005 issue of Elle (via Today). \"I adore [Vaughn], but I don't want to be a rebound girl. I feel like it will happen when it happens.\"\n\nDespite her hesitation, People reported that the couple did date for about a year before amicably calling it quits in December 2006.\n\nSelena Gomez dated The Weeknd (real name Abel Tesfaye) from January 2017â€”when he was rebounding from his long-term relationship with model Bella Hadidâ€”until late October 2017. When the new debuted, a source told Hollywood Life, \"The Weeknd still has feelings for Bella... He's trying to move on and Selena is certainly at the right place at the right time.\"\n\nThat may have been a sign that these pop stars were moving a little too fast, but don't feel too sad for Gomez. The very week that their breakup went public, she was spotted getting awfully close to her infamous on-again-off-again ex, the notorious Justin Bieber. A source told Us Weekly, \"[Gomez] was happy with The Weeknd, but Justin always has the biggest piece of her heart.\"\n\nAn insider told E! News that Gomez's latest ex feels somewhat slighted. \"Abel is upset about Selena hanging out with Justin, especially twice in the same week.\" Take that with a grain of salt because TMZ photographed The Weeknd having a grand old time with a mystery woman at a club. We suspect a rebound rematch has begun.\n\nThree months after filing for divorce from husband Paul Nassif, The Real Housewives of Beverly Hills star Adrienne Maloof revealed that she was dating Sean Stewart, son of rocker Rod Stewart.\n\nAside from the speed at which Maloof moved on from her ex-husband, issues with the relationship may have stemmed from the notion that their new love was basically Rod's song \"Maggie May\" come to lifeâ€“Sean is nearly 20 years her junior.\n\nThe pair split after less than a year together. The Daily Mail reported that Sean insisted they separated on good terms, yet he also accused Maloof of feeding false stories about him to the press, including the idea that Maloof broke his heart. Ouch.\n\nAlmost immediately after pop star Britney Spears and dancer Kevin Federline divorced in 2007, she had a brief two-week fling with music producer J.R. Rotem, Us Weekly reported. From the sounds of it, the \"Baby One More Time\" singer dodged a bullet, because after it was over, TMZ reported that Rotem shared a lot of disrespectful, vulgar TMI about their intimate life with the press. Girl deserves better!\n\nThat wasn't Spears' only rebound romance. In March 2013, Us Weekly reported that just two months after her broken engagement to talent agent Jason Trawick, she rebounded with former bartender David Lucado. They split in August 2014.\n\nReality star Kylie Jenner had an on-again-off-again romance with rapper Tyga from 2014 to April 2017, when they reportedly split for good. That's when she started dating rapper Travis Scottâ€“rumor had it to make her ex jealous.\n\n\"Travis and Kylie have been friends for a while and they all hang out,\" a source told People. \"When she and Tyga are having drama, she tries to make him jealous by hanging out with other guys. When Kylie is happy, they're happyâ€”but it's never that simple. There's always some kind of drama with Kylie and Tyga.\"\n\nJenner and Tyga allegedly ended their relationship because she didn't want to commit, but thenâ€“poof!â€“she was suddenly carrying Scott's child. \"Kylie broke up with Tyga partly because she felt too young to get serious,\" an insider told People. \"Now she's having a baby with a guy she just started dating. People around her are really surprised. It happened really fast.\"\n\nOscar-winner Renee Zellweger dated White Stripes rocker Jack White for nearly two years before they split in late 2004. Six months later, she was married to country singer Kenny Chesney, but it wouldn't last. People reported that the union was annulled after just four months.\n\nOne month after Zellweger and Chesney tied the knot, White had a rebound wedding himself, walking down the aisle with model Karen Elson. He and Elson separated in 2011 and finalized their divorce in 2013.\n\nSongstress Taylor Swift and DJ Calvin Harris, her boyfriend of more than a year, seemed blissfully happy when she co-chaired the 2016 Met Gala, and though he didn't join her there, Page Six reported they were still together at the time and that Harris was even ring shopping.\n\nHowever, Swift was spotted dancing with actor Tom Hiddleston at a Met Gala after-party, and she and Harris announced their split just days later. In June 2016, less than two weeks after her and Harris' breakup, Swift went on a worldwide PDA tour with Hiddleston. A source told E! News that Swift \"felt rejected by Calvin,\" which led to her rebound with The Avengers (2012) star, adding, \"She wanted to feel special again. She likes Tom a lot and is excited about being with him.\"\n\nThat excitement apparently faded fast. By September 2016, People reported that she and Hiddleston were done.\n\nA month later, People reported that Swift had been spotted with current beau, actor Joe Alwyn.\n\nIn July 2008, New York Yankees star Alex Rodriguez divorced his wife and mother of his two daughters, Cynthia Scurtis, and embarked on a highly publicized affair with Madonnaâ€”who was at the tail end of her own marriage to director Guy Ritchie, according to People.\n\nThat fling didn't last long, however, and A-Rod was soon spotted with actress Kate Hudson in May 2009. Some Yankee fans even considered her a good luck charm that helped the team win the 27th World Series. By December 2009, that romance was over too, allegedly because Rodriguez wasn't over the Queen of Pop. A source told Us Weekly (via the Daily Mail), \"[Hudson] gave A-Rod three chances to stop contacting Madonna... She said that if Madonna is what A-Rod wants then she can have him.\"\n\nJust weeks later, Rodriguez began dating actress Cameron Diaz, reportedly causing a feud between Diaz and Hudson. Diaz and Rodriguez dated for about a year before splitting amicably in September 2011.\n\nJennifer Lopez has a reputation as a serial rebounder. She bounced back from the end of her long-term relationship with Sean \"Diddy\" Combs in 2001, diving in with backup dancer Cris Judd, whom she married that same year.\n\nWhen she and Judd split in 2002, she immediately began dating Gigli (2003) co-star Ben Affleck. They got engaged the same year, but split in 2004, before walking down the aisle.\n\nLopez then hooked up with Latin music superstar Marc Anthony for just six months before marrying him. They welcomed twins Max and Emme in 2008.\n\nIn 2011, Lopez and Anthony separated. She started dating backup dancer Beau \"Casper\" Smart the same year.\n\nLopez and Smart split in late August 2016, and by December 2016, she was already linked to rapper Drake.\n\nShe and Drake split in February 2017. The next month, she reportedly began dating the aforementioned Rodriguez. Phew! (To be fair, when you look like J.Lo, no one expects you to be single for long.)"
