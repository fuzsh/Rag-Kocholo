        "text": "Kevin Federline's lawyer wants Britney Spears to pay some of her ex-husband's legal expenses in their divorce case, court documents show.\n\nAttorney Mark Vincent Kaplan said in an Aug. 26 declaration that Federline has \"no net income\" after various expenses, and that his spousal support of $20,000 a month ends in November. Spears, meanwhile, brings in an average monthly income of $737,868.\n\nSpears is \"clearly the 'monied party' \" in the dispute and should pay $50,000 for Federline's litigation expenses, Kaplan argued.\n\nTimeline: Britney's Meltdown\n\nAn after-hours message left Thursday with Spears' attorney was not immediately returned.\n\nSpears married Federline in October 2004, eight months after her first marriage to childhood friend Jason Alexander was annulled. She cited irreconcilable differences when she filed for divorce from Federline on Nov. 7, 2006.\n\nPhotos: K-Fed Gets A Text Message\n\nThe couple's divorce became official July 30.\n\nSince February, Spears, 25, and Federline, 29, have shared custody of their sons, 23-month-old Sean Preston and 11-month-old Jayden James.\n\nA hearing is scheduled for Sept. 17, but an attorney for Spears has requested a continuance until November."
