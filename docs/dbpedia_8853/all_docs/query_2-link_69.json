        "text": "With this historically based 7-day Vietnam trip, you will delve deep into Vietnamâs turbulent past and the fascinating story of Ho Chi Minh. The city of Ho Chi Minh is commonly referred to as the southern capital of Vietnam and boasts an array of venerated landmarks. An exclusive tour of the city will lead you to the Ho Chi Minh City Museum and the Reunification Palace, which are eminent locations that will allow you to uncover the finer details of the countryâs past.\n\nThe following day, you will learn intriguing facts about the Vietnam War and meander the intricate web of tunnels known as the Cu Chi Tunnels. You will then cruise along the Mekong Delta in a traditional wooden sampan boat to a riverside village. Here, you will have endless opportunities to tuck into award-winning Vietnamese cuisine at celebrated restaurants and roadside markets.\n\nYour tour through Vietnam will continue with an airplane transfer to Hue, which is a city that once stood as the seat of the Nguyen Dynasty and where Ho Chi Minh spent his youth studying at a distinguished academy. You will traverse the landscape that surrounds Hue shortly during a guided expedition across the Hai Van Pass to a secluded beach. Here, you can have the day to unwind on sun-kissed shores. Afterward, you will visit Hueâs Ho Chi Minh Museum and the home of the respected hero.\n\nThe booming capital of Vietnam, Hanoi, will be the last stop on your expedition. You will transfer to the city for a guided tour at Hanoiâs Old Quarter. Afterward, you can continue to Hoan Kiem Lake to unwind with incredible views before concluding your trip at the stately Ho Chi Minh Mausoleum. Here, the body of the former president is housed and praised by hundreds of people every day. You can then enjoy one last morning under the warm embrace of the Vietnam sun before transferring to the airport for your flight home."
