        "text": "Founded in 1009 by the Ly dynasty, the city of Thang Long became the capital of Vietnam. From there, it became an important administrative and cultural center for Vietnam until 1802 when it was moved south to Hue. Initially known as Thang Long (meaning “the river where there is a bridge to heaven”), Hanoi was officially founded in 1831 by the Nguyen dynasty.\n\nAfter the Vietnam War (1959 – 1975), Hanoi became the capital of a Socialist Republic of Vietnam and lasted during the War (1955 – 1975). When North and South Vietnam were reunified in 1975, Hanoi became the capital of a Socialist Republic of Vietnam. From 1975-2002, there was a period of violent conflict known as The First Indochina War (1946 – 1954).\n\nThe culture of Vietnam is one of the oldest in the world and has changed considerably over the past nearly 4,000 years. Trieu, Dinh, Ly, Tran, and Le Dynasties are included in the history of Vietnam. about at the same time as the Chinese dynasties of the Han, Duong, Tong, and Nguyen. Some people claim that Chinese culture has influenced Vietnamese culture, yet a study demonstrates that Vietnamese culture has its own distinctive characteristics and has developed in a manner that is similar to that of China.\n\nTaking a leisurely stroll across the Hoan Kiem Lake is a perfect way to explore Hanoi. Locals will tell you that the mythological turtle still swims here, although you can also spot real-life turtles here when you visit. The views across the lake are worth a visit too – it’s one of the most stunning spots in Hanoi.\n\nThe Temple of Literature in Hanoi is a stunning example of ancient architecture and an absolutely must-see for tourists. The temple was originally built in dedication to Confucius, but now numerous chapels and annexes have been added over the centuries. It’s located in Hanoi’s Old Quarter and makes an excellent travel destination for anyone wanting to experience some history with their sightseeing."
