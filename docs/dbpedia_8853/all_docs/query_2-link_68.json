Continue southwards to eventually arrive in one of Vietnam’s most atmospheric towns – Hoi An.\n\nDay 7 Hoi An\n\nExplore Hoi An’s well-preserved ancient town, a former trading port which once welcomed Chinese, Dutch, French, Japanese, Portuguese and Arab merchants from the 16th to the 18th Century.

On this journey through the countryside, stop at a cricket farm where these insects are raised to eventually become tasty snacks.
