        "meta_description": "This essay argues that Dick is as much a chronicler of human feelings as he is a prophet of futuristic strangeness. Dick writes in an emotionally heightened way, explores the nature of human feeling, and uses the portrayal of feeling as a way of engaging with his readers, setting out a philosophical and moral agenda in a singularly intense and driven way. Focusing closely on four scenes from three novels, the essay shows how Dick’s interest in emotion and emotional response offers a powerful social and political critique of his society and its persistent tendency to foster human alienation. The essay offers a broadly humanistic reading, shaped in the agendas set by Dick’s biographers, and inflected by cultural materialist and feminist thinking. It is designed to be useful to the general as well as the scholarly reader.",
