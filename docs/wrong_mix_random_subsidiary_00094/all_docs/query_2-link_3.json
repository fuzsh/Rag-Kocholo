        "text": "Science fiction is clearly the most visible and influential contemporary form of futurist thinking in the modern world. Why is science fiction so popular? As I will argue, one main reason for the popularity of science fiction is that it resonates with all the fundamental dimensions of the human mind and human experience. It speaks to the total person about the future. At the outset, let me provide a working definition of science fiction. Although not all science fiction deals with the future, its primary focus has been on the possibilities of the future. In this regard, science fiction can be defined as a literary and narrative approach to the future, involving plots, story lines and action sequences, specific settings, dramatic resolutions, and varied and unique characters, human and otherwise. It is imaginative, concrete, and often highly detailed scenario-building about the future set in the form of stories. In this paper I describe the historical development of science fiction as an approach to the future tracing its origins to science and evolutionary theory, secular philosophy, technological forecasting, mythology, and the philosophy of Romanticism. Within this historical review, I consider the rich array of futurist themes and issues examined in science fiction. I also describe the diverse functions and innumerable strengths of science fiction as a mode of future consciousness.\n\nThis thesis proposes a critical framework by which science fiction can be read as an indicator of significant trends and debates in science and culture. It takes as its starting point Brian Aldiss&#39;s statement that science fiction&#39;s purpose is to articulate in fictional form a definition of humanity and its status in the universe that will stand in the light of science. Science fiction exists as a means by which scientific concepts are constructed as cultural interpretations, and as both have changed significantly over the period from the emergence of the genre in the mid nineteenth century through the twentieth century, analysis of science-fictional forms and practices can reveal the processes of their evolution. A critical framework is constructed based on Aldiss&#39; definition, identifying first, a construction of selfhood and spatiality - physical and metaphysical - as being fundamental, and secondly, identifying the emergence and evolution of major &#39;Orders&#39; that..."
