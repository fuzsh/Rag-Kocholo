        "text": "Heart of Art\n\nDenver's Golden Triangle Creative District neighborhood brims with more than 30 art galleries and artists' studios showcasing the innovative wares of nationally renowned talent and regional up-and-comers. First Friday Art Walk, a shuttled gallery tour that takes place the first Friday of each month, is a terrific way to tour art marts like Walker Fine Art. The Golden Triangle art galleries are bordered by Speer Boulevard, Colfax Avenue and Lincoln Street. Shuttle tours begin at the Osage Street Light Rail Station.\n\nColorado State Capitol Tour\n\nThe Colorado State Capitol, modeled after the Capitol Building in Washington, D.C., is a stunning spectacle embellished with stained glass depicting events and people inherent to Colorado, coupled with gorgeous Colorado white granite, rose onyx and yule marble. To see if you've got what it takes to adjust to the altitude, climb the 99-step spiral staircase to an open-air deck affording jaw-dropping views of the city skyline and Rocky Mountains. The Corinthian-styled building, famed for its gold-plated dome rising 272 feet above the ground, offers temporary exhibits, visitor galleries and complimentary tours, Monday through Friday.\n\nTattered Cover Book Store\n\nNo visit to Denver would be complete without a journey through the Tattered Cover Book Store, one of the top independent booksellers in the country. This astounding literary marvel boasts several metro Denver locations, but the store in the renovated Lowenstein Theater on a burgeoning stretch of East Colfax is the talk of the town. Grab a latte from the in-house java joint, plop down in one of the overstuffed chairs or sofas to wrap your hands around the latest bestseller, or attend a free book signing or author lecture from big names like John Gray, Al Gore, Annie Leibovitz and Garrison Keillor. Tattered Cover's newest location is at Denver Union Station.\n\nUnited States Mint Tour\n\nTo see where your currency is conceived (sorry, no free handouts), follow the money trail to the Denver U.S. Mint. The free, 45-minute tours are led by knowledgeable guides and provide a fascinating look into the history of coinage. Both kids and adults will love getting up close and personal with the shiny pocket change that streams off the production lines. Tours are available Monday through Thursday (excluding Federal holidays). All visitors must be 7 years and older. See the mint's latest policies.\n\nDenver Central Library\n\nDenver Central Library has an impressive art gallery on the seventh floor. The library is best known, perhaps, for its Western History Collection, which covers the earliest explorations, Spanish land grants, Native American history, the gold rush era and the present day with a particular focus on the Rocky Mountain West.\n\nFree Festivals Year-round\n\nDenver's festivals are fun and often completely free. You'll be exposed to only-in-Denver sights, sounds and tastes. Don't miss the Cherry Creek Arts Festival, held every summer, or the Colorado Dragon Boat Festival in Sloan's Lake Park in July. Learn more about Denver's festivals.\n\nGet Cultured\n\nThe Denver Center for the Performing Arts – home to the Newton Auditorium, Temple Buell Theatre, Ellie Caulkins Opera House, Garner Galleria Theatre and a wealth of smaller stages – hosts several free performances throughout the year. There are rules, of course: No advanced reservations are accepted; seating is general admission; children under six years old are not allowed; and tickets are only available on a first-come, first-served basis on the day of the performance. Despite the regulations, it's worth braving the lines to experience some of the best theater in the country.\n\nRed Rocks Park & Amphitheatre\n\nCarved from towering red rock monuments, Red Rocks Park & Amphitheatre is one of the world's most renowned concert venues. When there's no concert, the free Visitor Center has a museum and Performers Hall of Fame, while the surrounding park has hiking trails that weave in, around and over the colorful red rocks.\n\nHammond's Candy Factory\n\nAnyone with even the smallest sweet tooth will love this free tour, which gets you behind the scenes at Hammond's, a company that has been making candy in Denver since 1920. You'll come away with a newfound respect for the candy industry, plus plenty of free samples.\n\nCity Park Jazz\n\nFor more than 20 years, the bandstand at City Park has played host to some of Denver's greatest live jazz performances – and they've all been completely free. During the summer months, bring out your beach chair or picnic blanket and get ready for a foot-tappin' good time.\n\nChildren's Museum of Denver at Marsico Campus Joy Park Free Nights\n\nJoy Park and Adventure Forest are open for FREE on the third Friday of each month from May to September from 4 – 8 pm (or dusk). Reservations are required to guarantee entry.\n\nDikeou Collection\n\nThere's nowhere else you're going to see a pair of inflatable, 16-foot-tall rubber bunnies, right? One of The Mile High City's most fascinating art locales, The Dikeou Collection is a private collection of contemporary art, with photography, drawings, sculptures and installations by more than 25 artists from around the world. Free and open to the public, Wednesdays, Thursdays and Fridays, 11 a.m. to 5 p.m. or by appointment."
