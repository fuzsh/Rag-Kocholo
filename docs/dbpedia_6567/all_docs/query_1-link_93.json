        "text": "I can’t remember another movie that I had never heard of, was recommended to me decades after its release, and that I loved nearly as much as Red Rock West (1993). From the minute I read the brief synopsis of the plot, I was stoked: A Marine veteran (Nicolas Cage) with a bum leg drives 1,200 miles across the United States for a job that his buddy set up for him. Upon arrival, he finds it was actually just an interview, and once the supervisor finds out about his leg, he realizes that he’s out of luck. As the Marine wanders into a local establishment, barely able to scrape two nickels together for a cup of coffee and a few gallons of gas, the proprietor mistakes him for a hired gun he was expecting to arrive the week prior. That synopsis is not giving anything away about what happens over the next 90 minutes or so, but how great of a set up is that for a movie? Add to that a very reserved single guitar providing the backing music for much of the early film, and it really pulls you in with anticipation for what’s coming next.\n\nPart of what had me so excited about this one was the cast. not only Cage, who has been a favorite of mine since Raising Arizona (1987) – which also starred the lovely and talented Holly Hunter – but a supporting cast that features the legendary Dennis Hopper, the beautiful Lara Flynn Boyle, and a name that, while not as familiar as the other three, was one of the most prodigious and recognizable actors from the 90’s, the late JT Walsh. If you were watching movies during that decade, you have no doubt seen JT Walsh many times, most typically playing a baddie and doing a tremendous job. Also joining the ensemble is country star Dwight Yoakam. The first time I recall seeing Yoakam in a feature film was Sling Blade (1996), so it was fun seeing him show up here in a smaller role as an interstate trucker. The synergy among this group exemplifies the adage that “the whole is greater than the sum of the parts”, and I can’t imagine the film without any one of them.\n\nI actually was very torn and undecided as to whether I wanted to write about Red Rock West for one simple and inexplicable reason: There really isn’t anywhere to see it. You can’t see it on any of the subscription streaming services. You can’t purchase it via any of the streaming services. You can’t rent it on demand from anywhere. The only place I’ve found that you can obtain it is a used DVD copy off of eBay or Amazon. And even then, my 2003 DVD release that I bought off of eBay was full screen (not wide screen), in stereo (no surround sound), and no extras. Although many don’t realize it, Netflix does still have a DVD rental service as part of their company (you have to add it to your streaming plan and pay extra), but while the title shows up in the search, it does not seem to be available as a rental. So as much as I feel bad for hyping up a movie to this degree when it’s one that is nearly impossible to find, in the event you are able to grab a copy, you will be rewarded with one of the best films of the 1990’s, in my humble opinion.\n\nScore: 9.2/10\n\nStarring: Nicolas Cage, Dennis Hopper, Lara Flynn Boyle, and Craig Reay\n\nSuggested By: @JSWriter65\n\nTo see our movie reviews, check here; to see our TV series reviews, check here."
