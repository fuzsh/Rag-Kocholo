        "text": "Michael (Cage) is an honest down-on-his-luck drifter who always seems to be in the wrong place at the wrong time. He spends his last five bucks on enough gas for his car to get him to the little town of Red Rock, where he hopes to find a job. Upon arriving, he goes to the local bar where the owner, Wayne (Walsh), seeing his Texas liscense plates, mistakes him for a Texan named Lyle he has hired for a job who didn't show up on time. Michael, desperate for money, pretends to be Lyle only to discover that the job he's been hired for is to kill Wayne's wife, Suzanne (Flynn Boyle). Michael takes the money, but instead of killing Suzanne he tells her about Wayne's plan. Suzanne pays him double what Wayne paid for him to go back and kill Wayne. Michael takes her money as well and then tries to get out of Red Rock, but every time he tries to leave he only gets deeper into trouble, especially when the real Lyle (Hopper) shows up.\n\nThis is a good movie and I really don't have anything to complain about. I don't have anything to rave about either. I enjoyed watching it and everyone involved did a decent job, but it was an average film, no better, no worse."
