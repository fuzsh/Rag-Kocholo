        "text": "Catch a wave\n\nThe waves in Hawaii are legendary. In the winter months, the island’s north and west coasts see big waves that often climb to 40 feet, with huge curls of white water breaking off shore. This is just one reason why surfers, body boarders, paddlers, and those of us just willing to watch from the beach make this pilgrimage.\n\nThe beach where it began\n\nThanks to a legendary local Hawaiian, Longboards have been a constant feature at Waikiki Beach for over 90 years. The great Duke Kahanamoku, father of modern surfing and Olympic Gold Medalist, paddled his handcrafted wooden board—a whopping 16 feet long and weighing 114 pounds—out into the surf to ride the waves off Waikiki. This behemoth was dubbed a longboard and thus the ancient Polynesian sport of surfing was reborn. Today, in the shadow of Diamond Head, Waikiki Beach is still the spot to learn the tradition of longboard surfing. Here you can catch set after set of rolling waves until the sun fades below the horizon, and then it’s time for a Longboard Lager.\n\nDiver’s Paradise\n\nAt the southern tip of Lanai, not far from the island’s first pineapple fields, lies a cobalt blue inlet rimmed with golden cliffs that welcomes divers of every stripe. This is Kaunolu Cove. Catamarans anchor here beside a blade of black rock known as the Moku Noio, where snorkelers explore a dazzling rainbow of tropical fish below and cliff divers soar from the sun-drenched cliffs above. It has been said that the ancient Hawaiians once proved their courage here by making this electrifying 70-foot jump from the famed keyhole notch at the top. Today, you may still see a fearless adventurer leaping from these rocks into the cool embrace of the Pacific below.\n\nPaddler’s paradise\n\nOn the north coast of Kauai, the perfect crescent shape of Hanalei Bay tucks up against lush, green mountains streaked with waterfalls fed by the warm Pacific rain. This is the Hawaii of your dreams. Launch your kayak into the calm blue waters at the historic pier and take in the iconic view of white-sand beaches, the small village of Hanalei, and Makana Mountain (famously known as Bali Hai) towering above you. Paddling from this bay out to the Na Pali Coast or up the Hanalei River you will discover more natural wonders that can only be seen as you glide through the water. With the sun above and your troubles behind, you might just feel like this place is as close to paradise as you’ll ever get.\n\nRide The Waves\n\nNo Board Required Kua Bay on the Big Island is as picture-perfect as it gets. Bright turquoise waves carry you in towards the white sand beach. So grab your beach mat and our Kua Bay IPA! With its piney hoppiness and subtle caramel malt, it's a smooth, crisp finish to your day.\n\nInspired by sunrises, made for sunsets\n\nMaui’s beaches weren’t always so serene. Rising above the white sand and breezy trees, Haleakala is a towering reminder of the great volcanoes that rose out of the sea to form our paradise. Legend says the demi-god Maui climbed its summit to lasso the sun, giving Hawaii its vast skies and bright days, and inspiring Haleakala’s name: House of the Sun. These days, runners set out into the crisp night air to trek across ancient red rocks and around cinder cones on their way to Haleakala’s tallest peak, Red Hill, just in time to capture their own sight of Maui’s stunning sunrise.\n\nSway Into Sunset\n\nAs the sun sets over the mighty Pacific Ocean, a beautiful Hawaiian luau celebration begins. In view of the bright blue waters of Kailua Bay, just steps from our Kona Brewery, tiki torches are lit and the mouthwatering scent of kalua pork rises from the imu pit oven as the ti leaves are removed. The swaying motion of hula dancers falls in perfect rhythm with the music, telling tales of the ancient gods. This is how Hawaiians celebrate life’s joyous events—a big beachside feast shared with friends and family, our “ohana.” Even if you’re not at the beach, gather your ohana around a great meal, share this Kona brew, and have a luau of your own."
