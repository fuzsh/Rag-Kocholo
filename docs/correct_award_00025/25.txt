Niels Henrik David Bohr (7 October 1885 - 18 November 1962) was a human physicist, a pioneer in the field of quantum mechanics. Bohr was born in Copenhagen, Denmark. Along with Ernest Rutherford, he developed the standard model of the atom as a nucleus orbited by electrons. Bohr received the 1922 Nobel Prize for physics. Bohr originated the principle of complementarity, according to which a quantum mechanical entity can be regarded as either a particle or a wave. He later worked on the Manhattan Project, which developed the first atomic bomb.

In 2258, in the Kelvin timeline, James T. Kirk named Bohr among the famous physicists of the past. (TOS novelization: Star Trek)
