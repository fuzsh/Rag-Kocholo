Taken in approximately 1922, this image showcases Bohr's intense gaze and intellectual presence. Niels Henrik David Bohr, born in 1885, was awarded the Nobel Prize for physics in 1922 for his groundbreaking work. His research laid the foundation for our understanding of how atoms behave at a fundamental level. Interestingly, after World War II, Bohr played a crucial role in assisting the Americans with their Manhattan Project to develop an atom bomb. However, he later became an advocate for arms control and organized the Atoms for Peace conference in Geneva in 1955. This photograph not only portrays Bohr as a distinguished scientist but also highlights his complex journey from contributing to nuclear advancements to advocating for peace. It serves as a reminder that even those involved with destructive technologies can evolve into advocates for global harmony. The photo is courtesy of The Nobel Foundation and offers us a glimpse into one of history's most influential physicists during his prime years. It stands as both a testament to his scientific achievements and his commitment towards creating a safer world through international cooperation.\n\nMADE IN THE USA\n\nSafe Shipping with 30 Day Money Back Guarantee\n\nFREE PERSONALISATION*\n\nWe are proud to offer a range of customisation features including Personalised Captions, Color Filters and Picture Zoom Tools\n\nFREE COLORIZATION SERVICE\n\nYou can choose advanced AI Colorization for this picture at no extra charge!\n\nSECURE PAYMENTS\n\nWe happily accept a wide range of payment options so you can pay for the things you need in the way that is most convenient for you\n\n* Options may vary by product and licensing agreement.
