This way of living, in fact, only really stems from none other than the archnemesis of all progress and evolution: fear.\n\nAtomic Mimesis\n\nThe ideal of creating something with novel utility is a matter of fact that demands awareness, anything less would be less than ideal. Tempering the imaginary from the useful is a tug-o-war in our \"echo\" system of an ecosystem. Is anyone listening to the redundancy our ways?"
