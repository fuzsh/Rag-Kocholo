        "text": "Source – Go “en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Niels_Bohr”\n\nNiels Henrik David Bohr was a Danish physicist who made foundational contributions to understanding atomic structure and quantum mechanics, for which he received the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1922\n\nBorn: October 7, 1885, Copenhagen\n\nDied: November 18, 1962, Copenhagen\n\nEducation: Trinity College, Cambridge, University of Copenhagen, University of Cambridge\n\nAwards: Nobel Prize in Physics, Copley Medal, Franklin Medal\n\nThus Spoke Bohr :\n\nPrediction is very difficult, especially if it’s about the future.\n\nYour theory is crazy, but it’s not crazy enough to be true.\n\nEinstein, stop telling God what to do!\n\nIt is wrong to think that the task of physics is to find out how Nature is. Physics concerns what we say about Nature.\n\nAn expert is a man who has made all the mistakes which can be made, in a narrow field.\n\nWe are all agreed that your theory is crazy. The question which divides us is whether it is crazy enough to have a chance of being correct. My own feeling is that it is not crazy enough.\n\nA physicist is just an atom’s way of looking at itself.\n\nIf quantum mechanics hasn’t profoundly shocked you, you haven’t understood it yet.\n\nHow wonderful that we have met with a paradox. Now we have some hope of making progress.\n\nNever express yourself more clearly than you are able to think\n\nEverything we call real is made of things that cannot be regarded as real.\n\nEvery great and deep difficulty bears in itself its own solution. It forces us to change our thinking in order to find it.\n\nThere are trivial truths and the great truths. The opposite of a trivial truth is plainly false. The opposite of a great truth is also true\n\nWhen it comes to atoms, language can be used only as in poetry. The poet, too, is not nearly so concerned with describing facts as with creating images.\n\nRead more at http://www.brainyquote.com/quotes/authors/n/niels_bohr.html#GpzyEAsapmYg5fqY.99"
