        "text": "Here are some common questions we receive from table leaders, and some suggestions for how to maintain best practices and grow in life and leadership.\n\nOne issue Christians have in responding to “woke” leadership is that some of it sounds vaguely like what Jesus would do. After all, Jesus did ransack the temple once, turning over the tables of money changers and railing against the religious profiteers of the time.\n\nHe was between eight and nine years old when he ascended to rule a kingdom. Reigning from 1332 to 1323 BC, King Tut became leader of ancient Egypt. A Pharaoh was a statesman, religious leader, military commander, administrator and steward of the land.\n\nJesus and His disciples traveled and ministered together, day and night, for three years. We don’t know of all the meals they had together, the conversations as the walked from town to town, or what Jesus said when they fished, and started campfires, and woke up in the mornings.\n\nA loving God is Someone we all want. Because though God is love and God does love, by no means is His love unconditional. Rather, love is God’s nature, and God loves for His own glory and purposes."
