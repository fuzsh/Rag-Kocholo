Niels Bohr developed the Bohr model of the atom in 1913 to explain the hydrogen spectrum. In his model, electrons orbit the nucleus in discrete energy levels rather than following classical physics. When electrons jump between these quantized energy levels, they absorb or emit photons of specific frequencies corresponding to the lines of the hydrogen spectrum. Though not fully accurate, Bohr's model was pivotal in applying quantum theory to atomic structure and earned him the 1922 Nobel Prize in Physics. It helped establish the foundations of quantum mechanics and atomic physics.",
