Niels Bohr, Danish physicist, c1922

Niels Bohr, Danish physicist, c1922. Niels Henrik David Bohr (1885-1962) is best known for his work on quantum mechanics and atomic structure, for which he was awarded the Nobel Prize for physics in 1922. He later assisted the Americans with the Manhattan Project to build the atom bomb, but after the Second World War he became a strong advocate for arms control, organising the Atoms for Peace conference at Geneva in 1955.

EDITORS COMMENTS

This print captures the brilliant mind of Niels Bohr, a Danish physicist who made significant contributions to the field of quantum mechanics and atomic structure. Taken in approximately 1922, this image showcases Bohr's intense gaze and intellectual presence. Niels Henrik David Bohr, born in 1885, was awarded the Nobel Prize for physics in 1922 for his groundbreaking work. His research laid the foundation for our understanding of how atoms behave at a fundamental level. Interestingly, after World War II, Bohr played a crucial role in assisting the Americans with their Manhattan Project to develop an atom bomb. However, he later became an advocate for arms control and organized the Atoms for Peace conference in Geneva in 1955. This photograph not only portrays Bohr as a distinguished scientist but also highlights his complex journey from contributing to nuclear advancements to advocating for peace. It serves as a reminder that even those involved with destructive technologies can evolve into advocates for global harmony. The photo is courtesy of The Nobel Foundation and offers us a glimpse into one of history's most influential physicists during his prime years. It stands as both a testament to his scientific achievements and his commitment towards creating a safer world through international cooperation.
