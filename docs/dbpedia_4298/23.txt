John Addison emerged as a leader during his time at Primerica, the largest independent financial services and marketing organization in North America, shortly after his hire in the early 1980s. He was an integral part of their growth and helped to navigate the company as they expanded across the nation. Johnâ€™s leadership was again pivotal during years following an acquisition by Sandy Weill and what became Citigroup. John was named president in 1995 and Co-CEO in 1999.

In addition to his stellar reputation as a businessman, John has made a name for himself as a top-rated speaker, renowned for using his down-home delivery and humor to provide insight and wisdom on leadership, personal development and success. John served as Leadership Editor for SUCCESS magazine, where he wrote regular columns and blogs for the national newsstand publication and website. John is a highly sought-after keynote speaker. He was honored by the University of Georgia Alumni Association as one of the Bulldog 100. He is a 2019 inductee into the Direct Selling Hall of Fame.

Today, John is more focused on his passion for helping people become the best they can be than ever before. He believes the biggest crisis in the world today is the lack of leadership and is on a mission to help cultivate the necessary skills in those who would take up that mantle. He truly understands how to inspire and motivate, and wants to share his insight to help others achieve the success they crave.
