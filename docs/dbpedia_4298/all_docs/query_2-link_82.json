        "text": "1628. Colonel John Addison (54) (172)(217) (20) died in 1708 in England. He was born in County Westmoreland. John Addison came from Cumberlandshire in northwestern England and emigrated to Maryland in 1667, settling in Charles County. When Prince George's County was formed in 1695, his estates were included in that county.\n\nJohn Addison had wide-spread interests and established a powerful family in Prince George's County politics. As well as owning extensive land, he was a merchant and Indian trader, He was a part owner of the ship Liverpool Merchant, which was seized, along with its cargo, for violations of the Navigation Acts.\n\nHe was a member of the Council of Maryland in 1692-93 and was Chancellor and Keeper of the Great Seal of the Province from 1696 to 1699. He was a Captain in the Militia of Charles County in 1692 and was named colonel in command on July 30, 1694. He was also placed in command of Prince George's County militia on Aug 17 1695.\n\nHe later returned to England and there died intestate, leaving his wife and son in America. At his death, his personal estate was appraised at nearly two thousand pounds, including fourteen slaves and one indentured servant and not including nearly a thousand pounds on account with with several London merchants. In addition he held 6,487.5 acres of land. He was married to Rebecca Wilkinson on May 21 1677.\n\n1629. Rebecca Wilkinson (217) (20) died before Sep 14 1726 in Somerset County, Maryland. Rebecca Wilkinson's marriage to Colonel John Addison (No. XXX) alienated her children from her first marriage, with the exception of her youngest child, Barbara, who was a posthumous child and only an infant on her mother's remarriage.\n\nThere is no doubt that Colonel Addison profited from his marriage to the widow Dent and obtained a great deal of Thomas Dent's property.\n\nIn her will, Barbara does not mention her children by Thomas Dent, other than her daughter Barbara, who was made executrix and redisuary legatee. Nor did the Dent chiuldren ever refer to their half-brother, Col. Thomas Addison (No. XXX). Children were:\n\n814 i. Colonel Thomas Addison."
