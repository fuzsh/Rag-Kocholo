John loved to tell stories to his grandchildren about the Indians of the area and of family adventures as they moved to the Bradford County area.\n\nb. A great story teller. As a historian, he knew many of the local families and used to incorporate them into his stories. His granddaughter, Margaret (Biles) Bryant remembered being spell bound by his stories while sitting on his knee.\n\nc. Margaret also remembered being amazed when her grandfather Biles would reach into the sugar bowl, take a spoonful and put it directly into his mouth. And he got away with it! Marian Biles similarly recollected: Grandpa often took a spoon of sugar fro the sugar bowl (quite often!!!). Mother told me firmly that I must never do that  at home or away!!!  unless I had need of some with my meal!!!, and dont question what Grandpa does!!!\n\nd. Per Marian Biles: After marriage Grandpa may have resided in the old sheep house (before it became a sheep house). A number of young couples stayed there. A long time ago an old German cabinet maker had lived there. He made a cherry dresser, which some of the Strunk family now have. He also mad another just like it for Mary Bunnell Biles, which we have of pine. Grandpa went to school at Factoryville, I dont know when or how long. He was going to school at Towanda when Dad was born in 1989. They lived on 3rd Street (up the hill from the main route though town. Jacob P. Biles died in March 1890, and then they moved back to the farm. Uncle Elmore said that he was born at Kerrick Hill (I suppose for Sarah to be with her mother.)\n\ne. Marian Biles on disposition of Johns genealogical records: I really didnt begin to get all his material. I think Grandma or (more likely) her cousin, Jennie Arnout, who cared for Grandma when she was older for a time, allowed the stamps to be sold for most of the old letters. I did not get them back because I didnt know what became of them until a few years ago. Also, Uncle Bob took things (I got most of them). Uncle Elmore took things and Aunt Ruth cleaned the house. I suspect the letters that were returned to her (without stamps), judging from an old letter I found and something Raymond said, were in four grocery bags. All I got were in the trunk, which was all that were mentioned to me. I went to get them, but many were gone. All the ones [letters] I have had stamps on them yet. Jennie Arnout took some about Irvine family, and a notebook fixed for my mother. I got the letters (or at least some letters) from her, but she wouldnt part with the book - so much for that. I did see the book. It was well put together, but I didnt have time to copy or even read all of it.\n\nf. John A. Biles was a Justice of the Peace in Bradford County, Pennsylvania from at least 1920 to 1924.\n\ng. John A. Biles initiated the 1st Biles Reunion in 1900, a tradition that continued, with few exceptions, thereafter."
