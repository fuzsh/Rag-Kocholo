        "text": "La-La Land Records and Universal Studios proudly present the twentieth title within the acclaimed Universal Pictures Film Music Classics Collection – TORN CURTAIN, a remastered and expanded limited edition CD release of the original motion picture score to the 1966 dramatic thriller directed by the legendary Alfred Hitchcock, and starring Paul Newman and Julie Andrews. This special release, produced in partnership with Universal Music Enterprises, showcases the original film score, composed and conducted by John Addison (THE ENTERTAINER, TOM JONES) as well as the film’s unused score recording by Bernard Herrmann (VERTIGO, PSYCHO).\n\nWith ’60s era pop sensibilities infused throughout, composer John Addison’s score to TORN CURTAIN marked a musical departure for Hitchcock, providing a notable contemporary style and sound for its time. Addison’s work lends a bright sense of fun and romance to the film, in addition to expertly satisfying the story’s requirements for drama and suspense. Composer Bernard Herrmann’s final work for Hitchcock is a darker, more traditional affair, demonstrating the renowned maestro’s excellence in the grand tradition of his previous collaborations with the director.\n\nProduced, edited and mastered by Mike Matessino from high resolution transfers of pristine 3-track stereo vault masters, this special presentation features Addison’s score sounding better than ever, and expanded by almost double the running time of the 1966 Decca album. Herrmann’s unused score presents all material he captured during his one day of recording for the film. Herrmann’s material here is expanded by more than eight minutes beyond what was previously released in 1999. Limited to 3000 units, this CD release includes exclusive, in-depth liner notes by author Jeff Bond and sharp art direction by Dan Goldwasser.\n\nMUSIC COMPOSED AND CONDUCTED BY JOHN ADDISON\n\nSCORE PRESENTATION\n\n1.
