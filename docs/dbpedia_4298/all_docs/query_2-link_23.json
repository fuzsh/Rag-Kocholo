Addison has published widely in the major economics and labor economics journals, including the Journal of Business, Review of Economics & Statistics, American Economic Review, Journal of Human Resources, Journal of Labor Economics, and Industrial and Labor Relations Review. He is the author/editor of a number of labor economics texts, including The Market for Labor: An Analytical Treatment (with W.
