        "text": "John Addison is currently the president and chief executive officer of Addison Leadership Group and Leadership Editor of Success Magazine for which he writes a monthly column. During his more than 25-year tenure at Primerica Inc., he rose in management and served as Co-chief executive officer from 1999 to 2015. Addison was critical in steering the company through many changes, including Primericaâ€™s separation from Citigroup in 2010, which resulted in one of the most successful IPOs of the decade. A world-class speaker and motivator, Addison shares his business acumen and leadership insights through speaking engagements and consulting opportunities. He chronicles those motivational forces in his book, Real Leadership: 9 Simple Practices for Leading and Living with Purpose (McGraw-Hill; March 2016).
