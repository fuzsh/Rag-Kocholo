        "text": "John A. Addison\n\nAddison was one of the first settlers south of Miami, at a place on the Biscayne Bay which later became known as Cutler. He was a squatter who settled on land that was part of the Perrine Grant and also was part of the Seminole's \"Big Hunting Grounds.\" He probably established his homestead in 1864, or at least sometime between 1861 and 1866. His wife was Mary Townsend Addison (1834-1906). His neighbor was another early settler and squatter, William Fuzzard, who lived about a mile away. In 1886-1887, he was listed as a banana grower and starch manufacturer. When visited by the Ingraham party in 1892, he was engaged in agriculture, growing pineapples, oranges, lemons, limes, mangos, guavas, and alligator pears. In 1897, S.H. Richmond's survey of the proposed town of Cutler included an avenue called Addison's. In 1898, a settlement with the U.S. Government and Perrine's heirs led to Addison receiving 80 acres of land. In time, his land became known as Addison's Hammock and later became part of the Charles Deering Estate. Addison served as a scout in the Third Seminole War in the Mounted Volunteers.\n\nBirth: 1827\n\nDeath: 1911, Florida\n\nName Variations:\n\nJ.A.
