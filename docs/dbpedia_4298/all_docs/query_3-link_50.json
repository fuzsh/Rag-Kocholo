It’s a painting of the headquarters of General Grant from the Civil War. I like it because it’s one of those paintings where there’s a million tiny little details, and the longer you look at it, the more you find, and it’s definitely the kind of painting that once upon a time, I would have just walked right by in the gallery being like, ‘Ah, I don’t know, that doesn’t seem like there’s a lot going on there.’ And then you stop and you look at it for a minute and you go, ‘Is that a marching band? What’s happening over the wire? Why are there all of those fires?’ It’s sort of a lot of short stories within this much larger work.\n\nDonoma Fredericson ’23\n\nMy favorite piece is “Movement: Seas after Hurricane Red, Green and White, Figure in Blue” by John Marin. This is an oil painting made in 1947…The piece is pretty abstract so before reading its title I honestly didn’t know what, if any, scene it was supposed to depict. Though looking at it afterwards, the water becomes obvious and it’s hard to see anything except the sea. The composition is somewhat unconventional, featuring thick, visible brush strokes. There’s also a considerable blank border on the canvas between the paint and its frame. Ironically, this became my favorite painting at the Addison because I found it calming to look at despite how hectic the scene itself is. The color palette and thick brush strokes make it fun to explore visually. This painting was a gift to the Addison from Norma B. Marin. I don’t tend to attribute any particular meaning to this piece, but think of it with more of a personal connection of being representative of a space I can go to calm down and reflect."
