        "text": "Leadership is a dynamic enterprise. By that I mean it evolves over time, and different times call for different approaches. But I genuinely believe if you want to be a leader for the long term, responsibility is number one.\n\nI was fortunate enough to be with the same company for 34 years. I spent 5 of those as President and the next 15 as co-CEO. There were times when everything was going unbelievably well, and everything was growing—incomes to the field, sales, and profits were increasing. Then we went through some of the most challenging economic times that any financial services company had ever experienced. What we now call the Great Recession was the great recession for most businesses, but for housing, real estate, and financial services, it was the Great Depression. We managed and led the company successfully through that nearly impossible period because we believed in long-term leadership. What I call Leadership with a capital L.\n\nYou can clearly see the difference between short-term and long-term leadership when you look at sports. There are some people who, as head coaches, are known for their personality and their track record. They’ll show up in a team, and they’ll make a tremendous improvement in the team with their style. Early on, the team will get a lot better. Then after three years or so, the coach has worn out their welcome and their effectiveness is done. If what you’re looking for is massive improvement just next year, these coaches and leaders are a great choice.\n\nBut if you’re looking for somebody who’s going to build you a long‑term successful program, they’re not your choice.\n\nI was not one of these people who wanted to be a job hopper and go from one company to the next company to the next company, run my little bag of tricks for two to three years, and then move on to the next. I wanted to be a part of a company like a family, to be a steward for the business. I had a long-term vision, not a fast-track style. To me, that’s real leadership. That’s what I talk about in my book as big “L” Leadership versus small “L” leadership.\n\nOf all the qualities real leadership requires, responsibility is number one if you’re going to set yourself apart as one of these long-term leaders. Somebody has to take responsibility for the decisions. If you as the leader can follow Harry Truman’s adage of “The buck stops here,” you can:\n\n· Build trust. An environment where people know they can trust you is essential to making any progress in business. Or life.\n\n· Live the company values. If people can tell that you genuinely have the best interest of the team and organization at heart, they’ll see the company values lived out in front of them and be more likely to do the same.\n\n· Praise your people. If you can take responsibility when things are going badly, it leaves room to give credit to your people when things are going well. Don’t claim credit for success and blame others for failure."
