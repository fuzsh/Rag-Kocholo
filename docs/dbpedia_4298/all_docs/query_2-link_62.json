        "text": "Today’s guest is the president and chief executive officer of AddisonLeadership Group, as well as the Leadership Editor for Success magazine. John Addison is joining us and he’s out with a new book entitled, “Real Leadership: 9 Simple Practices for Leading and Living with Purpose.” Previously John worked at Primerica Inc., for more than 25-years, rising through the ranks to become co-chief executive officer from 1999 to 2015. He was critical in steering the company through many changes, including the company’s separation from Citigroup in 2009, which resulted in one of the most successful IPOs of the decade. Now, John is a world-class speaker and motivator who shares his business acumen and leadership insights.\n\nIn today’s episode we spend a good 20 minutes going over the recipe for leadership today. We talk about how it’s not that different than what it was generation to generation, three generations ago. That even with the current market and all of the technology, at the end of the day, being a leader boils down to just a few things. Then we dive into some of the money questions that I want to learn from all of my guests and so I learn through that conversation that John was raised by depression era parents. So, what did that teach him and how did that somehow maybe even create challenges for him?\n\nIf you’d like to learn more about John Addison visit his website johnaddisonleadership. com or follow him on Twitter @JohnAddisonGA.\n\nOne of my favorite quotes from the interview: “The ability to connect with, communicate with, and influence people is a critical skill to leadership.” – Click To Tweet\n\nYou might also like…"
