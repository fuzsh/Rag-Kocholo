        "text": "The Addison family has a rich history in Maryland dating back to the 17th century.\n\nColonel John Addison, son of Lancelot Addison (1604-1703) and Dorothy (Danvers) Addison, was born in Westmoreland County, England, on the border of Scotland. He had three brothers. Thomas and Henry Addison were merchants; Anthony Addison was rector of Abingdon, Oxford, England, and Chaplain to the Duke of Marlborough.\n\nJohn Addison emigrated from England in the early 1670's. On May 21, 1677, John Addison married Rebecca (Wilkinson) Dent, (daughter of the Reverend William Wilkinson, and widow of Thomas Dent). With the exception of her youngest child, Barbara, who was only an infant when her mother remarried, Rebecca's marriage to John Addison alienated the Dent children: William, Peter, George, Thomas, and Margaret Dent. There is no doubt that Colonel Addison profited from his marriage to the widow Dent and obtained a great deal of Thomas Dent's property. John and Rebecca had one child: Thomas.\n\nJohn Addison established a powerful family in Prince George County politics. He was a merchant, Indian trader, and owned extensive land. He was also part owner of the ship \"Liverpool Merchant\", which was seized along with its cargo for violations of the navigation acts. Addison took a leading role in the Maryland Protestant Revolution of 1689. The Revolution lasted only a short time and ended in July, 1690. John Addison served as a member of the Associator's Convention (the Assembly elected under their regime) and the Grand Committee of Twenty (their executive committee). The goal of the Protestant Associators was the overthrow of the proprietary officers (Calverts). From 1690 to May 1692 there was an interim government of Protestant Associators. From1692 to 1715, Maryland was under crown rule (as King William and Queen Mary had declared it a royal colony) with Sir Lionel Copley as governor, thus ending Maryland's status as a proprietary province.\n\nJohn Addison later returned to England, leaving his wife and son in America, and died there around 1706. He passed on to his son, Thomas, his large estate acquired in England and America. Rebecca survived her husband by 20 years.\n\nThe Addison family has a rich history in Maryland dating back to the 17th century.\n\nColonel John Addison, son of The Reverend Lancelot Addison (1604-1703) and Dorothy (Danvers) Addison, was born in Westmoreland County, England, on the border of Scotland.

He married Rebecca Dent, daughter of the Rev. William Wilkinson (Cong. Lib.E. 186, 3, M 25) and widow of Thomas Dent, Esq.; they had issue, one son. At the formation of Prince George's County in 1695, his estates were included in the new county.\n\nHe was member of the Council of Maryland, 1692-93; Chancellor and Keeper of the Great Seal of the Province, 1696-99; Captain 1692; Commissioned July 30, 1694 Colonel, commanding the Militia of Charles County and placed in command of Militia of Prince George's County, Aug.17, 1695. (Service of Ancestors, Colonial Wars.).\n\nLineage information at http://freepages.genealogy.rootsweb.com/~paxson/southern/addison.html\n\nslave holdings\n\nfrom Addisons from Maryland posted 2002\n\nThe Addison Family\n\nNorbeck, Montgomery County Maryland\n\nFor as long as any living relative can remember, the Addison family has lived near Norbeck, which is a small town 15 miles north of Washington DC in Montgomery County, Maryland. The Norbeck region was first settled by freedmen and run-away slaves. Here they cleared the trees and started small farms. They lived in harmony with the few Indians who still hunted in the wilderness north of the nation's capital during the 19th century. After the Civil War, the former slaves were allowed to apply for the deed of the property they were living on. This is how the Addison family obtained their property in Norbeck.\n\nAlthough there are no written records, it is believed that the Addisons from Norbeck are direct relatives of the slaves from the Addison Plantations in Prince George's County, Maryland. In 1675, John Addison came to America from England. He settled in Maryland and acquired large holdings of land from Lord Baltimore. On these lands he planted tobacco which he exported to England at a great profit. In order to grow more tobacco, he needed a large work force. He bought many Africans to work his plantation. In 1700, slaves were 11 percent of the population of Prince George's County and by 1790 they comprised 52 percent of the population. John Addison's son, Thomas, expanded the Addison plantations to become the largest land holders in the county. But by the turn of the century in 1800, the large plantations were sold off and became small farms. An owner of a small plot only used one or two slaves to work the land. As a result, many slaves either were freed or ran away from the plantation.\n\nThese former slaves moved to the wilder regions of Maryland and intermingled with the native Indians. The Addison Plantations were only 10 miles south of what would become the District of Columbia. Even until the mid-1800's, the area north of the District remained wooded and uninhabited. It was this remote area of Maryland where the freedmen and run-away slaves migrated and where they could live off the land and be free.\n\nMany of the former slaves took their master's name since they had no family name that could be remembered from when they lived in Africa. It is believed that the Addisons of Norbeck left the Addison plantations sometime in the late 1700's. The family roots probably started here in America in the late 1600's as slaves of the Addison family as they built their large land holdings. The Addison Plantations are long gone, the family home burned down and only Addison Road in Prince George's County reminds us of the Addisons from England. But in Montgomery County, the Addsion family from Norbeck is still alive and well! They have endured.\n\nReference: Along the Potomac Shore in Prince George's County, Tanta-Cove garden club, 1992.\n\n=\n\nfrom Glimpse of Pr. George Past By Ovetta Wiggins Washington Post Staff Writer Wednesday, July 30, 2008\n\nA button, a bottle, a toothbrush and 300,000 other ordinary relics from colonial-era plantation life on the banks of the Potomac are now historical artifacts, to be examined, admired and cataloged by those who take stock of bygone days.\n\nThe items are coming home to the place where they were discovered more than two decades ago, the spot beside the river once known as Oxon Hill Manor or the Addison plantation.\n\nMarveling at the preservation of some of the items, Samford held up an onion-shaped glass bottle, dating to the early 1700s. Next to it was a piece of a metal bottle cap inscribed with the letter \"A.\" Another bottle seal plainly reads \"Addison.\"\n\nThe Addisons, apparently wealthy English merchants, used slave labor to grow tobacco, oats and corn on property beside the Potomac that John Addison bought and began expanding in 1687. His descendants sold the land to Zahariah Berry in 1810, and it passed through various hands before the manor house burned down in 1895.\n\nGEDCOM Source\n\nPublic Member Trees Ancestry.com Ancestry.com Operations, Inc.
