Constance of Aragon

Queen consort of Hungary, Germany and Sicily and Holy Roman Empress

Born 1179 – Died 1222

Claim to Fame: Married a 14 year old at age 30 and ruled as regent of Sicily from 1212–1220.

Constance was the daughter of Alfonso II of Aragon and Sancha of Castile.

Constance was married in a political alliance to King Emeric of Hungary, producing a son, Ladislaus. After the death of Emeric, the crown of Ladislaus was usurped by his uncle, forcing Constance to bravely escape with her son to Vienna.

Sadly, Ladislaus soon died and Constance returned to Aragon. At the age of thirty, she was strategically married off to King Frederick II of Sicily, who was only fourteen. Nonetheless, a child was born two years later.

From 1212, Frederick was crowned King of Germany and then Holy Roman Emperor. As this resulted in Frederick’s long absences, Constance competently acted as regent of Sicily for eight years.
