Her mummified corpse was exhumed in 1900.\n\nGisela was first married at 12 or 13 to Bruno I, Count of Brunswick, and secondly to Ernest I, Duke of Swabia. After Ernest’s death, she became regent for their son but was removed on grounds of being too closely related to her late husband.\n\nShe married a third time in 1016 or 1017to Conrad II, who became Holy Roman Emperor in 1027. Highly ranked individuals took exception to the marriage as they believed Gisela and Conrad were too closely related, the Archbishop of Mainz refused to crown her, and Conrad was forced into temporary exile. The issues were eventually resolved and Gisela was crowned Empress of Germany.\n\nGisela played an active part in politics, the church, raising her children and improving her husband’s empire.\n\nShe died of dysentery in 1043 and was interred in the Imperial Cathedral of Speyer, Germany. I visited Speyer in 2012 and saw the Romanesque crypt where she is entombed (pictured above). Her tomb was opened in 1900 and Gisela’s mummified body was found to be 172 cm (5’ 8”) tall, with long blond hair."
