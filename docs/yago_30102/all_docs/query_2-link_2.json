After the death of Emeric, the crown of Ladislaus was usurped by his uncle, forcing Constance to bravely escape with her son to Vienna.\n\nSadly, Ladislaus soon died and Constance returned to Aragon. At the age of thirty, she was strategically married off to King Frederick II of Sicily, who was only fourteen. Nonetheless, a child was born two years later.\n\nFrom 1212, Frederick was crowned King of Germany and then Holy Roman Emperor. As this resulted in Frederick’s long absences, Constance competently acted as regent of Sicily for eight years."
