        "text": "It’s early April, so it must be almost time for another of Karen and Simon’s ‘Club’ weeks! On Monday 15th, the #1937Club will begin – a week-long celebration of books first published in 1937. These ‘Club’ events are always great fun, and I’m looking forward to seeing all the various tweets, reviews and recommendations flying around the web.\n\nPerhaps unsurprisingly, given my fondness for mid-20th-century lit, I’ve reviewed a few 1937 books over the years. So, if you’re thinking of taking part in the Club, here are my recommendations.\n\nLa Femme de Gilles by Madeleine Bourdouxhe (tr. Faith Evans)\n\nProbably my favourite of the five novels featured here, although all have something interesting to offer. Elisa is devastated when she realises that her husband, Gilles, has become entangled with her attractive younger sister, Victorine. Beautifully written in a sensual, intimate style, La Femme de Gilles is a very compelling novella with a powerful ending. The writing is spare but very emotive – Bourdouxhe holds the reader close to Elisa’s point of view giving us near-complete access to her inner thoughts and feelings. A timeless story of desire, selfless love, and the pain these things can bring. Highly recommended, particularly for fans of writers such as Simenon, Anita Brookner and Jean Rhys.\n\nThese Names Make Clues by E. C. R. Lorac\n\nAn intriguing mystery by one of my favourite women writers from the Golden Age of crime fiction, now back in print as a British Library Crime Classic. A treasure hunt party in a well-to-do London house, various literary pseudonyms, a sudden blackout and two dead bodies all come together to form a complex puzzle for Chief Inspector Macdonald to solve. As the story unfolds, the action shifts from London to the Berkshire countryside, widening the novel’s scope. Fans of cryptic crosswords and anagrams will likely enjoy this one, especially given the relevance of the novel’s title.\n\nAfter Midnight by Irmgard Keun (tr. Anthea Bell)\n\nThis book was published while Keun was living in exile in Europe after leaving Germany in 1936. Deceptively straightforward and engaging on the surface, the novel is actually a very subtle and insightful critique of the Nazi regime, written by an author who had experienced the challenges of navigating the system first-hand. It’s an excellent book, drawing the reader in from its striking opening line.\n\nYou can open an envelope and take out something which bites or stings, though it isn’t a living creature.\n\nAfter Midnight also provides a genuine insight into a country on the brink of self-destruction. Keun is particularly illuminating on how easily a society can shift such that the unimaginable becomes a reality as a new world order is established.\n\nMona Lisa by Alexander Lernet-Holenia (tr. Ignat Avsey)\n\nSome of you may be familiar with Alexander Lernet-Holenia’s intriguing novella I Was Jack Mortimer, a fast-moving, offbeat crime story set in 1930s Vienna. Nevertheless, there’s more to this author than that mystery suggests. Mona Lisa is a charming tale about love, life, and the search for beauty, told with much verve and wit. I thoroughly enjoyed this story of the captivating power of art and how we project our own emotions and feelings onto the images we see before us. Highly recommended, especially if this description appeals.\n\nJourney by Moonlight by Antal Szerb (tr. Len Rix)\n\nThis marvellous novel was a pre-blog read for me, so I haven’t written about it before. Nevertheless, several other reviewers have, so do check out their reviews – you can find Max’s and Karen’s posts by clicking on the links. When I think of this novel, it’s the nostalgic, dreamlike atmosphere that comes to mind. There’s a lot more to Journey by Moonlight than that, of course, but the evocative mood is the first thing I recall. Various train journeys across Italy also feature prominently. I’d really like to reread this at some point, even if it doesn’t happen next week!\n\nSo there we are, a few recommendations for next week’s #1937Club! Do let me know your thoughts on these books if you’ve read any of them. Or maybe you have plans of your own for the week – if so, feel free to mention them here.\n\nIt’s always a pleasure when a new reissue from the British Library Crime Classics series drops through the door, and Ethel Lina White’s wonderfully suspenseful novel The Wheel Spins proved no exception to this rule. Many of you will be very familiar with the story as it formed the basis for Alfred Hitchcock’s hit film The Lady Vanishes (1938), starring Margaret Lockwood, Michael Redgrave and Dame May Whitty. If anything, White’s novel is more sinister than Hitchcock’s adaptation, as a young Englishwoman’s sanity is called into question during a nightmarish train journey across Europe, with language issues adding to the general confusion.\n\nWhite’s heroine is the disillusioned socialite Iris Carr, who has been holidaying with a group of friends in the depths of Eastern Europe. Through their selfish, rowdy behaviour, Iris’ pals have managed to alienate the other English guests at their hotel – all of whom consider themselves respectful members of their communities. Nevertheless, while Iris is perceived to be ‘vain, selfish and useless’, she is in fact more compassionate and generous than her prickly exterior suggests.\n\nHaving fallen out with one of the other girls in her crowd, Iris decides to remain at the hotel for a couple of days, just for some peace and quiet, when her friends depart. But with no one else to guide her, she manages to get lost during a walk in the mountains – a thoroughly unsettling experience that presages some of the horrors to come…\n\nWhile waiting for her train to Trieste, Iris is struck by a violent pain – presumably due to sunstroke – and she loses consciousness for a few moments. Left feeling dazed and confused by the experience, she only just manages to board her train before it leaves the station. Here, Iris is thrust into a stuffy compartment full of unfamiliar faces, the most unwelcoming of which belongs to an imposing woman in black, who seems to be eyeing her with ‘a fixed stare of hostility’. The only friendly presence is the lady sitting opposite Iris – a non-descript, middle-aged Englishwoman, Miss Winifred Froy, dressed in a tweed suit and matching hat.\n\nUnder normal circumstances, Iris would have little time for a frumpy chatterbox like Miss Froy, who is returning to England following a stint as a governess for a prestigious family. But still feeling headachy after fainting at the station, Iris is more than happy to accompany Miss Froy to the dining car for tea, hoping it will perk her up.\n\nAfter returning to her compartment with Miss Froy, Iris falls asleep…but when she wakes up, her new friend is nowhere to be seen. In fact, everyone else in the carriage claims not to have seen Miss Froy at all, denying the very existence of another English lady in their compartment. In short, this is all very perplexing for Iris, who remains convinced that Miss Froy was sitting opposite her in the carriage only a short time before.\n\nA frantic search for Miss Froy swiftly follows as Iris becomes increasingly concerned that something underhand is afoot. If anything, the presence of a rather sinister-looking doctor in the adjacent carriage only adds to her sense of unease, especially as his patient’s face is covered in bandages.\n\nFollowing an appeal for help in the dining car, Iris is joined in her quest by a young English engineer, Max Hare, who is travelling back to England with a friend – a professor who happens to speak the local language. While Hare is willing to believe Iris – at least at first – the professor is more sceptical, especially when he questions the other passengers in Iris’ carriage.\n\n[Iris:] “Are you telling me I invented her?” she asked angrily.\n\n[The Professor:] “I hardly know what to think.”\n\n“Then I’ll tell you. All these people are telling lies.”\n\nEven as she spoke Iris realised the absurdity of her charge. It was altogether too wholesale. No rational person could believe that the passengers would unite to bear false witness. The family party in particular looked solid and respectable, while the father was probably the equivalent to her own lawyer. (p. 105)\n\nRight on cue, the sinister doctor appears, claiming Iris’ sunstroke has induced a state of delirium. In other words, Iris simply imagined Miss Froy, who was nothing more than an illusion in her mind.\n\nBut Iris remains convinced that Miss Froy actually exists and is hidden away somewhere on the train – possibly something to do with the rather imposing woman in black travelling in her compartment. The plot thickens when ‘Miss Froy’ miraculously reappears – only it’s not the Winfred Froy who was there before, but some strange imposter dressed in her clothes!\n\n…she [Iris] had begun to regard all the officials as being tools of the baroness. A mysterious power was operating on a wholesale scale, to her own confusion. In proof of this, opposite to her was the horrible changeling who wore Miss Froy’s clothing. Yet the incident was inexplicable, since she could find no motive for such a clumsy subterfuge (p. 132)\n\nAll the other English passengers on the train fail to come to her rescue when Iris tries to enlist their help. Firstly, she hasn’t endeared herself to these fellow travellers through her earlier self-centred behaviour at the hotel. Secondly, each person has their own private reasons for wanting to get back to England as soon as possible – and any delays to this leg of the journey, such as a search for a missing passenger or a similar mystery, could disrupt their plans. It’s an ironic critique of these seemingly upstanding pillars of society, highlighting the hypocrisy they willingly display.\n\n“I have no recollection of your companion. Some one may have been with you, but I was not wearing my glasses.”\n\n“Neither was I,” remarked Miss Flood-Porter. “So you can understand that we shall not be able to help you. It would be against our principles to identify some one of whom we were not sure.”\n\n“Most unfair,” commented Miss Rose. “So, please, don’t refer to us. If you do, we must refuse to interfere.” (p. 119)\n\nThe more Iris searches for Miss Froy, the more distressed and determined she becomes. Consequently, she makes a complete nuisance of herself, alienating the professor and worrying Max Hare in the process – to the point where her sanity is called into question as she persists in her quest. The last thing Iris wants is to be taken under the wing of the sinister doctor; who knows what might happen to her then?\n\n…he [the professor] could have no idea of the hell of fear into which he plunged her. She was white to her lips as she shrank into the corner of the carriage. She was afraid of him–afraid of every one in the train. Even Hare seemed to have entered into the conspiracy against her. The whole world appeared roped into a league that threatened her sanity. (p. 231)\n\nThe Wheel Spins is a very atmospheric, suspenseful read – another hugely enjoyable entrant in the entertaining BLCC series. As the train speeds through the European countryside, White does an excellent job of dialling up the tension, using foreshadowing and other techniques to hint at the trouble ahead. The glimpses of villages slipping by outside as the train hurtles towards its destination add to the novel’s woozy atmosphere, mirroring Iris’ disturbed state of mind.\n\nShe was scarcely conscious of slides of twilight scenery streaming past the window, or of the other passengers. A village shot out of the shadows and vanished again in the dimness. She caught the flash of a huddle of dark roofs and the white streak of a little river, which boiled under a hooded bridge. (p. 93)\n\nWhile certain aspects of the story were changed to streamline the film, White’s novel is still very much worth reading. If anything, I found it more frightening than Hitchcock’s adaptation, which I adore for its charming blend of mystery and wit. (Charters and Caldecott were excellent additions to the screen version, proving popular enough to reappear in other films and radio shows following the adaptation’s success.) There’s also another novel by White, Fear Stalks the Village, in the BLCC series – definitely something to look forward to in the months ahead!\n\nIn his introduction to this entertaining Golden Age mystery, Martin Edwards explains that the book’s author, Billie Houston, was best known as one half of a successful vaudeville act in the 1920s. It’s a background Houston puts to good use, peppering her novel with some well-judged humour amid the darkness swirling around the crime. First published in 1935 and recently reissued as part of the British Library’s Crime Classics series, Twice Round the Clock was Houston’s only novel, written between her appearances on stage. As other reviewers have noted, it’s a shame she never went on to write more books because her first foray into crime writing seems very promising indeed. Twice Round the Clock is an atmospheric country house murder mystery, the kind of thriller where almost everyone’s a suspect, and the victim himself is universally disliked. It’s an ideal read for a bitterly cold weekend…\n\nThe novel opens with a short prologue to set the scene. Just before 4 am on the night of a violent storm, Bill Brent is woken by a scream and the sound of glass breaking beneath his room in Treeholme, Horace Manning’s house. After making his way downstairs to the study, Brent finds a dead body slumped across the desk with an ivory-handled carving knife sticking out of its back. The victim is Brent’s host for the night, Horace Manning, an eccentric, reclusive scientist with a noticeable sadistic streak. Outside, the storm continues to rage – an inconvenience that has forced Brent and the other guests to spend the night at the Manning residence following a tense celebratory dinner.\n\nBrent is soon joined in the study by Dr Henderson, who has also been disturbed by the scream; but when the pair try to call the police, they discover the phone line is dead – either brought down by the storm or sabotaged on purpose, the exact cause is unclear. So, with the scene set for a tantalising mystery, the narrative rewinds to 4 pm the previous afternoon, revealing various events leading up to Manning’s death…\n\nHere, we are introduced to the cast of characters that ultimately find themselves stranded at Treeholme for the night. First amongst them is Tony Fane, who drives to Treeholme to ask Manning for his daughter’s hand in marriage. Given that Manning strikes the fear of God into everyone he encounters – his daughter Helen included – Tony can’t quite believe it when the old man says yes. In fact, Manning goes as far as to invite Tony’s family and close friends over for a celebratory dinner that evening, much to everyone’s surprise. Nevertheless, all this is delivered in such a creepy manner that the reader suspects something untoward is afoot…\n\nWhat was there about this man which was so elusive? What exactly was the strange impression he made, the undefinable effect he had upon one? Was it something in those eyes which were never more than half-open? Or something in the little smile which played about the corners of the tight-lipped mouth; or in those long, tapering fingers which, at times, seemed to move like tentacles with an intelligence of their own; something perhaps in the curious habit he had of stroking his cheek with one long, thin finger… (pp. 23–24)\n\nSo, dining at Treeholme that night, we have: Helen Manning and her fiancé, Tony; Tony’s sister, Kay, an impetuous, forthright young woman who says exactly what she thinks; Tony’s friend, Teddy Fraser, who only has eyes for Kay; Sir Anthony Fane, Tony and Kay’s blustering father; Lady Fane, who defers to her husband, Sir Anthony, on most matters; Bill Brent, Sir Anthony’s solid, dependable secretary; and Dr Henderson, a family friend and the local GP. Not forgetting Horace Manning, of course, who despite being a leading scientist, is possessed of a cruel, vindictive streak.\n\nThe whole evening has a sinister atmosphere, heightened by Manning’s creepy behaviour and malevolent experiments involving a deadly gas, which he outlines to his guests during a tour of his lab. Consequently, the diners are left with no illusions about their host’s capacity for cruelty, laying bare his twisted state of mind. Meanwhile, a storm is brewing outside, adding a touch of Gothic melodrama as it erupts overheard…\n\nSleepwalking servants, midnight assignations and other disturbances add to the action as the night unfolds, casting doubt on various members of the party, particularly after the discovery of Manning’s body. Moreover, with the phone lines down and no easy way of getting outside help, Bill Brent adopts the role of amateur detective, hypothesising about various scenarios based on the guests’ personalities and movements while also looking for clues.\n\nThe book takes its name from the timeframe for the story, which runs from 4 pm on the afternoon of the fateful dinner to 4 pm the next day. Huston makes good use of the ticking of the clock as the narrative unfolds, breaking her story into hourly segments covering the twelve hours before the murder and the twelve hours after. This structure helps to give the novel a sense of momentum, adding to the tension and suspense. While the characters are all reasonably familiar types, Houston draws them with enough care and attention to engage the reader. Kay is by far the most interesting figure here, a sharp, quick-witted young woman with the capacity to disrupt.\n\nKay swung two shapely, silk-clad legs over the side, heaved the rest of herself after them, and surveyed the house while she finished her cigarette.\n\n“The ogre’s castle,” she remarked, dropping the ash from her cigarette into the hat which Mr Fraser was holding in his hand. (p. 57)\n\nThe plot gets a little far-fetched towards the end, with elements of espionage, concealed identities and family secrets adding to the mix. Nevertheless, it’s all delivered in such an engaging manner that questions about credibility feel somewhat secondary to the reader’s enjoyment. All in all, this is a very atmospheric mystery with touches of Gothic horror and melodrama to heighten the mood. There’s also a sprinkling of romance between Bill Brent and Kay Fane to add to the intrigue.\n\n(My thanks to the publishers for kindly providing a review copy.)\n\nFor those of us in the Northern Hemisphere, January really is the longest month. Here we are, not even halfway through, and it already feels as though it’s been dragging on for weeks…\n\nAs Johanna Thomas-Corr said in her recent piece in The Sunday Times, ‘if ever there were a month to hibernate with a stack of books it would be January‘. Books are a source of solace for many of us, helping us through the coldest, darkest months of the year, both seasonally and more personally. So, if you’re in need of a little brightness to cut through the gloom, here are my favourite comfort reads – ten books to savour to banish the blues.\n\nCrampton Hodnet by Barbara Pym\n\nNo self-respecting list of comfort reads would be complete without Barbara Pym and her perceptive, wryly amusing observations on the foibles of village life, especially for spinsters. She excels in the type of book where characters worry about offending someone at the church jumble sale and what to serve the vicar when he comes over for tea. Published posthumously in 1985, Pym wrote this delightful comedy of manners in the late 1930s, just after the outbreak of WW2, but it never saw the light of day until after her death. Set in the respectable circles of North Oxford, the novel introduces us to a world of charming curates, mildly ridiculous academics, amorous students, and gossipy women. Probably the funniest Pym I’ve read to date, it’s a novel that deserves to be much better known.\n\nCrossed Skis by Carol Carnac\n\nThis delightful mystery, written by Edith Caroline Rivett – who also published books under the pen name E. C. R. Lorac – has to be one of the most enjoyable entrants in the British Library’s Crime Classics series so far. Set in the snowy Austrian resort of Lech am Arlberg and a foggy central London in the middle of winter, Crossed Skis weaves together two connected narratives to very compelling effect. The novel opens with a party of sixteen holidaymakers – eight men and eight women – journeying from London’s Victoria Station to the Austrian Alps for a combination of skiing, mountain walking and dancing. There’s a lovely ‘jolly-hockey-sticks’ boarding-school-style atmosphere within the group as the travellers bunk up alongside one another in their couchettes on the train. This enjoyable mystery has just the right amount of intrigue, and the winter holiday setting is perfect for January.\n\nThe Enchanted April by Elizabeth von Arnim\n\nJohanna included this novel on her list, and rightly – it’s a classic comfort read! The premise is wonderfully simple but full of potential. Four very different English women who barely know one another come together to rent a medieval castle on the Italian Riviera for the month of April. Each woman is looking for an escape of some sort, whether it’s from the drabness of London life, a stifling marriage, ghosts from the past or a plethora of dashing suitors. Without wishing to give away too much about the ending, this charming story has a touch of the fairy tale about it as the four women are transformed in various ways by their time at San Salvatore. A truly magical read, guaranteed to lift the spirits – an enchanting experience indeed!\n\nMiss Pettigrew Lives for a Day by Winifred Watson\n\nAnother sparkling read that taps into the ‘transformation’ theme with plenty of humour and verve! Set in London in the 1930s, Watson’s book captures an extraordinary day in the life of Miss Guinevere Pettigrew, a rather timid, down-at-heel spinster who has fallen on hard times. It’s a lovely take on the classic Cinderella story as Miss Pettigrew finds herself drawn into a new world, a place of adventure, excitement and new experiences. A charming novel, full of warmth, wit and a certain joie de vivre – one to read or revisit if you’re in need of a treat. The dialogue is particularly sharp and witty, very reminiscent of the Hollywood screwball comedies of the 1930s and ‘40s.\n\nTea is so Intoxicating by Mary Essex\n\nOstensibly the story of a couple’s troublesome quest to open a tea garden in an insular English village, this delightful novel touches on various areas of British life in the years immediately following WW2. More specifically, it is a book about class, social attitudes, the pettiness of village life, and perhaps most importantly, the failure to recognise one’s own limitations. The couple in question are David and Germayne Tompkins, who are relative newcomers to Wellhurst in Kent, the sort of village where everyone knows everyone else’s business. David is one of those men with big ambitions but precious little skill or knowledge to put his grand ideas into practice. Naturally, the tea garden is doomed from the start; the villagers are opposed to the idea, viewing the Tompkinses as outsiders who have no right to be opening a commercial venture in their back garden, especially one with the potential to attract all manner of hikers and bikers to the village. As the novel plays out, we see just how much of a mess David gets himself into as preparations for the ‘Cherry Tree Cot’ tea garden lurch from one catastrophe to another. Another novel that deserves to be much better known!\n\nHow to Cook a Wolf by M. F. K. Fisher\n\nInitially published in 1942 and subsequently updated in the 1950s, How to Cook a Wolf is a terrifically witty discourse on how to eat as well (or as decently) as possible on limited resources. The ‘wolf’ of the book’s title is the one at the door – a metaphor for hunger, particularly when money and other supplies are very tight. In her characteristically engaging style, Fisher encourages us to savour the pleasures of simple dishes: the delights of a carefully cooked omelette; the heartiness of a well-flavoured soup; and the comforting taste of a baked apple with cinnamon milk at the end of a good meal. The writing is spirited and full of intelligence, a style that seems to reflect Fisher’s personality as well as her approach to cooking, making this guide to keeping appetites sated a joy to read.\n\nThe Fortnight in September by R. C. Sherriff\n\nDuring a trip to Bognor in the early 1930s, R. C. Sherriff was inspired to create a story centred on a fictional family by imagining their lives and, most importantly, their annual September holiday at the seaside resort. While this premise may seem simple on the surface, the novel’s apparent simplicity is a key part of its charm. Here we have a story of small pleasures and triumphs, quiet hopes and ambitions, secret worries and fears – the illuminating moments in day-to-day life. By focusing on the minutiae of the everyday, Sheriff has crafted something truly remarkable – a novel that feels humane, compassionate and deeply affecting, where the reader can fully invest in the characters’ inner lives. It’s a gem of a book, as charming and unassuming as one could hope for – a throwback perhaps to simpler, more modest times. Kazuo Ishiguro has cited this as a favourite life-affirming read, and it’s easy to see why.\n\nLolly Willowes by Sylvia Townsend Warner\n\nFirst published in 1926 to great success, Lolly Willowes is now regarded as something of an early feminist classic. The novel tells the story of Laura (Lolly) Willowes, an unmarried woman of semi-independent means who struggles to break free from her conservative family to create a life of her own in the lush and seductive countryside of Buckinghamshire. While the story starts out in relatively conventional territory, about halfway through it morphs into something more magical, subverting the reader’s expectations with elements of fantasy and wonder. I’m trying to keep my description of this one reasonably brief to avoid any spoilers, but it’s a lovely story of a woman’s need for independence, to carve out a life of her own without the interference of those who think they know better.\n\nGrand Hotel by Vicki Baum (tr. Basil Creighton)\n\nRegular readers of this blog will know how much I love a good hotel novel, and Vicki Baum’s Grand Hotel is probably the quintessential example. This engaging, cleverly crafted story revolves around the experiences of six central characters as they brush up against one another in this glamorous Berlin setting. There are moments of significant darkness amid the lightness as Baum skilfully weaves her narrative together, moving from one individual to another with consummate ease – her characterisation is particularly strong. At the novel’s centre is the idea that sometimes our lives can change direction in surprising ways as we interact with others. As these characters come and go from the hotel, we see fragments of their lives – some are on their way up and are altered for the better, while others are less fortunate and emerge diminished. A thoroughly captivating gem with an evocative Weimar-era setting!\n\nI Capture the Castle by Dodie Smith\n\nAnother entry from Johanna’s list, but it’s such a classic comfort read that it would be remiss of me to overlook it here. In this utterly charming, quintessentially English novel, we follow the highs and lows of six months in the life of seventeen-year-old Cassandra Mortmain, one of the most delightful narrators you are ever likely to encounter in literature. In essence, the novel is a coming-of-age story, complete with plenty of agonising over various romantic entanglements along the way. Cassandra’s eccentric but penniless family provide much of the novel’s humour, living as they do in a dilapidated country castle in the mid-1930s, while two dashing Americans provide a touch of glamour. This captivating, slightly bittersweet novel might seem frothy on the surface, but it’s deeper and more insightful than the initial levity suggests.\n\nSo, there we are. Do let me know your thoughts on these choices, and feel free to suggest a favourite comfort read of your own – I’m sure there are many more for us to discover!\n\nOn Monday 16th October, Karen and Simon will be kicking off the #1962Club, a week-long celebration of books first published in 1962. Their ‘Club’ weeks are always great fun, and I’m looking forward to seeing all the various tweets, reviews and recommendations flying around the web during the event.\n\nPerhaps unsurprisingly, given my fondness for fiction from the mid-20th century, I’ve reviewed several 1962 books over the years. So if you’re thinking of taking part in the Club, here are my favourites. It really was a stellar year for books!\n\nThe Cry of the Owl by Patricia Highsmith\n\nA novel powered by Highsmith’s trademark interest in decency and morality, The Cry of the Owl appears to start in traditional psychological thriller territory, only to shift towards something a little more existential by the end. The story centres on Robert, a deeply lonely man who finds some comfort from naively observing a girl through her kitchen window as she goes about her domestic routine. What really makes this novel such a compelling read is the seemingly unstoppable chain of events that Robert’s relatively innocent search for solace kicks off. We are left with the sense of how powerless a man can feel when his actions are judged and misinterpreted by the supposedly upstanding citizens around him, especially when fate intervenes.\n\nEleven Kinds of Loneliness by Richard Yates\n\nProbably one of my all-time favourite collections of stories, alongside those by Edith Wharton, Elizabeth Taylor and William Trevor. Yates’ canvases may be small and intimate, but the emotions he explores are universal and recognisable. Here are the frustrations and disappointments of day-to-day life, the loneliness that stems from rejection, acute uncertainty, and deep feelings of worthlessness. A superb set of stories for lovers of character-driven fiction – quite varied in style despite the overarching theme.\n\nWe Have Always Lived in the Castle by Shirley Jackson\n\nI first read this novella for a previous Halloween, and it proved to be a highly appropriate read for the season – atmospheric, unsettling and sometimes quite humorous in a darkly comic way. What really sets this magical book apart from so many others is its highly distinctive style, much of which stems from the curious nature of the narrator’s voice, that of young Merricat Blackwood. It’s a book with much to say about our suspicions, prejudices and, perhaps most importantly, our treatment of people who seem unusual or different from ourselves. The sense of being an outsider – or society’s mistreatment of the outsider – is a prominent theme.\n\nThe Little Virtues by Natalia Ginzburg (tr. Dick Davis)\n\nA marvellous collection of essays by this brilliant Italian writer – erudite, intelligent and full of the wisdom of life. Ginzburg wrote these pieces individually between 1944 and 1962, and many were made available through Italian journals before being collected here. Nevertheless, I *think* it qualifies for the Club as the collection, titled Le Piccole Virtù, was first published in Italian in 1962. In her characteristically lucid prose, Ginzburg writes of families and friendships, virtues and parenthood, writing and relationships. And while we might not necessarily agree with everything Ginzburg sets out in her essays, there is no denying her commitment to the principles she shares and the reasoning behind them. There is so much wisdom and intelligence to be found in these pieces. A fascinating collection to savour and revisit, a keeper for the bedside table as a balm for the soul.\n\nThe Light of Day by Eric Ambler\n\nJules Dassin filmed this wonderfully entertaining crime caper as Topkapi (released in 1964), and I can highly recommend both! The Light of Day is one of Ambler’s ‘fish-out-of-water’ stories, in which unsuspecting civilians, often short of money, find themselves caught up in various conspiracies. In this instance, the naïve everyman is Arthur Simpson, a petty thief who gets roped into driving a high-class American car from Athens to Istanbul, no questions asked. Naturally, the whole pursuit is as dodgy as hell, with poor Simpson getting sucked into the ensuing crime as the novel unfolds. A fabulous read with some great characters to boot!\n\nThe Skin Chairs by Barbara Comyns\n\nBarbara Comyns’ fiction continue to be a source of fascination for me, characterised as they are by her unique worldview, a surreal blend of the macabre and the mundane. The Skin Chairs is a magical novel in which a bright, curious girl must navigate some of the challenges of adolescence. It is by turns funny, eerie, poignant and bewitching. What Comyns captures so well here is how children can often be excellent, intuitive judges of character without fully understanding the complexities or underlying motivations at play. A spellbinding read that reminds me a little of Angela Carter’s The Magic Toyshop and Shirley Jackson’s We Have Always Lived in the Castle – and I can’t recommend it more highly than that!\n\nCassandra at the Wedding by Dorothy Baker\n\nCassandra, a graduate student at Berkeley, drives home to her family’s ranch for the wedding of her identical twin sister, Judith, where she seems all set to derail the proceedings. This brilliant novel features one of my favourite fictional women. If you like complex characters with plenty of light and shade, this is a novel for you. Cassandra is intelligent and precise, with the capacity to be charming and witty. But she can also be manipulative, reckless, domineering, self-absorbed and cruel. In short, she is a mass of contradictions, behaving abominably at times – and yet she also elicits my sympathies.\n\nThe Garden of the Finzi-Continis by Giorgio Bassini (tr. William Weaver)\n\nAn evocative, achingly poignant story of a privileged Jewish family from Ferrara in Northern Italy in the run-up to the Second World War. This haunting novel encapsulates the loss of so many things: the loss of a love that was never meant to be fulfilled; the destruction of a sheltered world of innocence and sanctuary; and perhaps most tragically of all, the sweeping away of virtually a whole generation of humanity. While the overall mood and tone remain dreamlike and elegiac, Bassani never lets us forget the terrible impact of events to come. Gorgeous and heartbreaking in equal measure.\n\nThe Spoilt City by Olivia Manning\n\nThe second instalment in Olivia Manning’s remarkable Balkan Trilogy, a series inspired by some of her own experiences during the war. How to do justice to such a deeply rewarding series of novels in just a few sentences? It’s nigh on impossible. All I can do is urge you to read these books for yourself if you haven’t already. Ostensibly a portrait of a complex marriage unfolding against the backdrop of the looming threat of war, this largely autobiographical series is rich in detail and authenticity, perfectly capturing the tensions and uncertainties that war creates. As ever, Manning excels at creating flawed and nuanced characters that feel thoroughly believable. A transportive read with a particularly vivid sense of place.\n\nDue to a Death by Mary Kelly\n\nI think this might be the bleakest book I’ve encountered in the British Library Crime Classics series – absolutely brilliant, but as dark as a desolate wasteland on a cold winter’s day. The novel’s setting is Gunfleet, a fictional town inspired by Greenhithe in the marshlands area of Kent. It’s the perfect backdrop for Kelly’s story, a slow-burning tale of hidden affairs, family tensions and existential despair. This is a beautifully written, intelligent drama featuring realistic, complex characters with secrets to conceal. In terms of style, the book reminds me of some of Margaret Millar’s fiction – maybe Patricia Highsmith’s, too. Either way, this is an excellent book, shot through with a sense of bleakness that feels well suited to the chilly weather to come.\n\nFlesh by Brigid Brophy\n\nBrophy’s engaging novel concerns itself with a young couple’s relationship – a sexual awakening of sorts played out against the bohemian backdrop of 1960s London. When we are first introduced to Marcus, he appears to be a shy, socially awkward, gangly young man struggling to find his place in the world. But by the end of the narrative, he is transformed – infinitely more comfortable with himself and his relationships with others. The woman who brings about this fundamental change in character is Nancy, a self-assured, sexually experienced young woman Marcus meets at a party. This is a smart, sexy, thoroughly enjoyable novel by Brigid Brophy, an author who seems ripe for rediscovery, particularly in the current era of women’s empowerment. As in her marvellous novella The Snow Ball, Brophy demonstrates her natural ability to riff with the creative arts, this time alluding to Rubens’ women as symbols of sexuality.\n\nA Murder of Quality by John Le Carré\n\nSomewhat atypical in style for a le Carré, Quality is a murder mystery as opposed to a spy novel, the type of detective story that wouldn’t be entirely out of place amongst the British Library Crime Classics. The book can also be viewed as a barbed commentary on the English class system — particularly boarding schools with their cruelty and elitist attitudes. (Le Carré’s main setting is a public school.) What the author captures so brilliantly here is the snobbishness within the school environment, the internal politics between the masters and, perhaps more tellingly, between their wives. This is a very well-written, satisfying mystery with just enough intrigue to keep the reader interested – needless to say, there is more to the case than meets the eye. Moreover, it’s a darkly humorous book – worth reading for the satirical sideswipes at the upper classes, particularly the public-school set.\n\nSo there we are, a dozen choices for next week’s #1962Club! Do let me know your thoughts on these books if you’ve read any of them. Or maybe you have plans of your own for the week – if so, feel free to mention them here.\n\nA year or so ago, I read and loved Due to a Death, a brooding psychological mystery by the English crime writer Mary Kelly. The Spoilt Kill was published a year before Due to a Death, and it shares something of the same mood – a doomed, fatalistic tone that runs through the book. In short, it’s another triumph for this underappreciated writer, a brilliant literary mystery with shades of Dorothy B. Hughes.\n\nSet in the Staffordshire Potteries in the early 1960s, The Spoilt Kill is narrated by Hedley Nicholson, a private investigator in his mid-forties. Someone has been leaking the new designs at Shentall’s, a traditional, family-run pottery manufacturer in the area, resulting in cheap, copycat versions of their ceramics appearing overseas. With the US representing a lucrative market for pottery, the firm’s MD, Luke Shentall, has hired Nicholson to investigate the situation, preferring a more discreet approach than involving the police. In order to carry out his investigations, Nicholson is posing under the guise of a writer, tasked by Luke to capture the firm’s story in an updated promotional brochure – a cover story that enables Nicholson to go poking around the factory asking probing questions without raising too many suspicions.\n\nThe stealth, the pains taken, the risks to livelihood that were involved all added up to one word; money. For all Luke’s information about staff and access and cameras, it was money that I had chiefly to look for; money needed or money spent; someone poor, desperately, habitually, or suddenly; or someone merely greedy; or extravagant. That was why I wanted to see the salary sheets. As for wages – time enough to think about them when I’d fruitlessly exhausted the staff. A great thing was to remember that nothing was impossible; nothing, and no one. (p. 47–48)\n\nThe nature of the leaks suggests the culprit is someone with early access to the designs, a factor that narrows the suspects down to a handful of individuals – chief amongst them Corinna Wakefield, a talented artist who produces the firm’s new designs. Moreover, Corinna is one of the few ‘outsiders’ at Shentall’s. A former textiles designer from Manchester with no previous links to the pottery business or the local area, she rarely mixes with the others at the factory, setting her apart from those with generations of family loyalty to the firm.\n\nAs Nicholson’s investigation gets underway, the situation is further complicated by two significant factors. Firstly, the world-weary Nicholson finds himself developing feelings for Corinna, an attractive thirty-five-year-old widow with a somewhat shady, mysterious past. Consequently, Nicholson feels torn between his duty to Luke Shentall and his growing personal feelings towards a leading suspect in the case. Secondly, during one of the regular guided tours of the factory, a dead body is discovered in one of the vaults for liquid clay, raising the possibility of foul play in an already tense environment…\n\nKelly has chosen an unusual structure for her mystery, starting with a ‘What Happened’ section describing the discovery of the body – by Corinna, as it happens. Interestingly, Kelly doesn’t reveal the identity or gender of the deceased at this point, leaving the reader in the dark until the middle of the novel. The second section details ‘What Happened Before’ the dead body is discovered, allowing us to get to know various other key players in the mix, most of whom are potential suspects. Finally, we have the ‘What Happened After’ section, outlining the subsequent developments and the solutions to the crimes.\n\nWhat’s particularly impressive here is the characterisation. Both Nicholson and Corinna are very skilfully drawn, each with their own hopes, disappointments and preoccupations that gradually reveal themselves over time. Moreover, as in Due to a Death, Kelly infuses The Spoilt Kill with a strong sense of despair. There is a doomed, fatalistic feel to Nicholson and Corinna’s relationship throughout, however strongly the reader might hope for a more optimistic outcome. Moreover, the secondary characters are also neatly captured, from the henpecked accountant Colin Dart and his demanding wife, Gillian, to the brusque, insensitive accountant Dudley Bullace.\n\nGillian! She was an icicle, a narrow brittle icicle wrapped in a tightly belted scarlet raincoat that exactly matched her lipstick and flattered her crisp black hair and blue eyes. She was in her middle twenties, good looking in an orthodox way, though you wouldn’t have turned to look twice at her; a shell on the beach, one of thousands. (p. 49)\n\nKelly’s prose style is very literary with a distinctly noirish feel, perfectly capturing the stark beauty of the industrial landscape undercut with a seam of darkness, hinting at the sense of menace lurking within.\n\nThen in the floor of the pit, the pure industrial landscape of the iron and steel and the gas works and the ceramic colourists – black chimneys, level crossings without gates, heaps of slag and coke and scrap, a goods train clanking under a bridge, its engine pushing fat rolls of gritty steam into the sulphurous air. And through the middle of everything lay the Trent–Mersey canal, a motionless strip of water, black and glistening like a slug’s back. (p. 104)\n\nThe resolutions, when they come, are eminently credible and believable – more so than usual for this type of crime novel when complex, convoluted solutions are frequently deployed. They’re also very much in keeping with the character traits Kelly develops over the course of her narrative, illustrating how any of us could be driven to act rashly or foolishly in the heat of the moment.\n\nSo, in summary then, The Spoilt Kill is a top-notch, noirish mystery with an emphasis on characterisation, psychological motivations, atmosphere and mood. Fans of Dorothy B. Hughes and Margaret Millar would likely enjoy this one – a deserving winner of the CWA Gold Dagger on its original release.\n\nThe Spoilt Kill is published by the British Library as part of their Crime Classics series. My thanks to the publishers for kindly providing a review copy.\n\nIn recent years, the British Library has been doing a sterling job with its reissues of various vintage mysteries by the English crime writer Edith Caroline Rivett. While many of these novels were written under Rivett’s main pen name E. C. R. Lorac, others were published in the guise of Carol Carnac – including the excellent Crossed Skis, a fabulous winter holiday read.\n\nCrook O’ Lune (aka Shepherd’s Crook) is another splendid addition to the list, an absorbing slow-burn mystery with an excellent sense of place. The setting is the fictional farming community of High Gimmerdale, which Lorac based on the parish of Roeburndale in the Lancashire fells, an area she knew very well. It also features her regular detective, Chief Inspector Macdonald, who continues to impress with his sharp mind, likeable manner and thorough investigative skills.\n\nWith an eye on his future retirement plans, Macdonald is staying with friends in Lancashire’s Lune Valley while he searches for a small dairy farm to buy. During the trip, an investigation with links to the past arises, and Macdonald gets drawn in…\n\nGilbert Woolfall, a middle-aged businessman from Leeds, has recently inherited Aikengill, a remote farmhouse in the local area. While Gilbert has always been a town man, he finds himself increasingly tempted by the prospect of making Aikengill his home, especially given the beauty of the local area. Moreover, the property has been in the Woolfall family for centuries and was lovingly refurbished by the previous owner, Gilbert’s Uncle Thomas; so, the emotional pull of the property’s heritage is proving difficult for Gilbert to resist.\n\nBut with the other half of his mind he [Gilbert] was aware that something deep down inside him responded to the remoteness and serenity of the place, something tugged at him, told him he belonged here, as his forefathers had done and that if he sold that ancient house which Uncle Thomas had left him in his will, he’d know for the rest of his life he’d made a mistake, as well as lost an opportunity. (pp. 18–19)\n\nNevertheless, before finalising his decision, Gilbert is keen to work through his late uncle’s vast store of papers on the Woolfall family history. Who knows what he might discover as he continues to dig?\n\nWhile Gilbert is mulling things over, Lorac introduces a few other interested parties – each with an eye on the new owner’s decision, one way or another. First up, there’s Betty Fell, a strapping lass from a family of local farmers. Betty hopes to marry her young man, Jock Shearling, a local farmhand, but the prospect of living with either set of parents is not particularly appealing. So, she asks Gilbert if she and Jock can stay in a wing of the house and look after the place in his absence. In effect, Betty would act as Aikengill’s housekeeper while Jock could look after the land.\n\nThen there’s the Rector, the disagreeable Simon Tupper, who seems to think Gilbert’s uncle should have left the Church some money in his will. Gilbert knows of some suspicions regarding the Church’s misallocation of a previous stipend – a provision for a perpetual curate in the area, originally dating back to the Woolfalls’ ancestors in the 17th century. This ‘hocus-pocus’ about the grant appears to be the reason for the lack of any Church bequest in Uncle Thomas’s will. Finally, there’s Daniel Herdwick, owner of the neighbouring farm. He wishes to buy Aikengill as he already has grazing rights to the estate’s land.\n\nGilbert is minded to take up Betty Fell’s offer to take care of the place while he decides what to do long term. He knows it might take a year or two to make a final decision, and the house will need looking after in his absence – especially as the current housekeeper, Mrs Ramsden, is moving to Dent to take care of her cousin. However, before any plans can be finalised, a tragedy occurs. A fire breaks out in the Aikengill cellar, destroying the contents of the property’s study and killing Mrs Ramsden – possibly unintentionally, as the house was presumed to have been unoccupied on the night in question.\n\nNaturally, Chief Inspector Macdonald gets involved in the case – firstly as a consultant to the local police and subsequently on a more formal basis. The ensuing investigations take Macdonald through the hills and dales of the fells, giving Lorac ample opportunities to showcase her skills in capturing the beauty of the local area. What makes this story particularly engaging is how beautifully Lorac portrays the farming community and the local landscape. She writes lovingly about the details of day-to-day rural life, the rhythms of working the land, and the blend of beauty and ruggedness in the terrain.\n\nIt was a glorious spring evening, the sun still gilding the crests of the high fells, though the valley was already in shadows. At first, the steep narrow road ran between hedgerows in which the first blackthorn was spreading a mist of white, and the willow catkins were blobs of gold, but after a couple of miles the hedgerows gave way to dry-stone walls, the arable land dropped behind, and the road rose even more steeply to the open fellside. (p. 16)\n\nThe narrative is punctuated by some lovely descriptions of the Lancashire landscape, and Lorac’s knowledge of the practicalities of sheep farming also comes through, giving the story a strong sense of authenticity. (The Aikengill mystery is further complicated by the apparent theft of some sheep from Herdwick’s flock – a series of incidents that may or may not be connected to the fire) The post-war atmosphere, complete with shortages and black-market trading, is also nicely evoked.\n\nAnother area where Lorac excels is the characterisation. In Macdonald, Lorac has created a character with a deep understanding of country folk, particularly their strong sense of community and suspicion of strangers. The number of key players/suspects is relatively small, and Lorac fleshes them out beautifully through a combination of dialogue, behaviours and descriptive passages. As this mystery is a slow burner, we get to know the characters really well, despite a few obligatory red herrings here and there.\n\nMoreover, the solution is not overly complex or convoluted. Much of it rests on Uncle Thomas’s investigations into the Woolfall family history, some of which seem tantalisingly out of reach for the reader. (If you’re someone who likes to spot the clues and piece everything together yourself before the investigator reveals all, you might be a little frustrated with this one. I’m not sure there’s enough here to actually solve the puzzle in full without a little more info on Uncle Thomas’s papers.) Nevertheless, when the solution is finally laid out, it feels entirely plausible and in keeping with the novel’s tenor – so, no complaints on that front from me.\n\nIn summary then, this is a very absorbing mystery with a well-developed set of characters and a marvellous sense of place. Another winner from E. C. R. Lorac, one of the stars of the British Library Crime Classics series – my thanks to the publishers for kindly providing a review copy.\n\nOver the past few years, the British Library has been doing a splendid job in reissuing various vintage mysteries by the English writer Edith Caroline Rivett – mostly under her main pen name E. C. R. Lorac, but also the excellent Crossed Skis, which Rivett wrote as Carol Carnac. First published in 1936, Post After Post-Mortem is another very enjoyable addition to the list – an intriguing, complex mystery with a psychological edge.\n\nCentral to this novel are the Surrays, a highly successful family of intellectuals from Oxfordshire. Each of the five Surray children is a high achiever in their chosen field, from the eldest, Richard, the brilliant psychiatrist, to the youngest, Naomi, who has just been awarded a First in Classics. The middle daughter, Ruth – a critically-acclaimed writer – is as prolific as the other Surrays, with several books under her belt. Having just completed her latest manuscript, Ruth is thinking of taking a little break from the stresses and strains of a literary life. So, when a family birthday prompts the Surray clan to gather at their Oxfordshire home of Upwood, Ruth decides to stay with her parents once the gathering is over.\n\nRichard, however, is a little worried about Ruth’s mental well-being, having spotted the signs of potential trouble ahead. As such, he is hoping that Ruth will accompany their mother, Mrs Surray, on a walking holiday in Europe. However, before their plans can be finalised, there is a literary gathering at Upwood – an event that turns to tragedy when Ruth is found dead in her bed the following morning.\n\nAt first, the cause of death appears to be a clear case of suicide. A box of sleeping tablets is found on Ruth’s bedside table, along with a suicide note and a newly altered will (signed but not witnessed). It seems that Ruth had been under significant strain before her death, and Richard is especially keen to avoid any additional distress for the family through undue speculation about the circumstances. After all, what’s the point in delving into Ruth’s past history or her state of mind in the weeks leading up to the tragedy when the cause of death seems so unequivocal?\n\nRichard Surray’s one desire at that moment was the instinct of a physician to prevent the spread of a deadly disease. He feared desperately that other lives might be involved in this web of emotional confusion, as he foresaw fresh misery—for his mother and father and sister—if certain possibilities were made public, were dragged into the searchlight of popular curiosity… (p. 58)\n\nWith no other pertinent information emerging at the Inquest, the Coroner concludes that Ruth died from an overdose of barbiturates, noting a verdict of suicide in the records. Case closed, or so it seems. However, when Richard returns to his rooms in Bloomsbury, he finds a letter from Ruth, posted on the night of her death, in which she appears quite jolly and upbeat, full of grand plans for the week ahead. Hardly the kind of note that someone would have written had they been on the verge of taking their own life.\n\nAfter some soul searching and wrestling with his conscience, Richard decides to show the letter to a trusted acquaintance, Chief Inspector Macdonald, a familiar figure to regular readers of Lorac’s mysteries. Naturally, when Macdonald sees the letter, his suspicions are aroused, and in time he is officially appointed as lead detective in the case…\n\n“…You [Richard] argue—quite rightly, to my thinking—that something happened to her [Ruth] after she had written that letter to you. It might have been something which altered her whole outlook, and caused her to commit suicide. It might be something totally different which alters the entire case, so that the verdict of suicide is no longer tenable. One thing is certain—the evidence produced [at the Inquest] was incomplete and consequently misleading. It has to be reconsidered.” (p. 80)\n\nThe deeper Macdonald delves into Ruth’s life and movements before her death, the more he feels that vital information is being withheld, most notably by various members of the Surray family. On the one hand, it could be argued that Richard is trying to protect his mother, Mrs Surray, from further distress; but on the other, he (or another member of the family) might be concealing something for more sinister reasons.\n\nShe [Mrs Surray] had resented the Chief Inspector’s presence and the reiteration of those questions which she had answered already, and she resented the implication of his presence that there was more to be told than had been told. Trying to keep a firm hand on nerves that were beginning to torture her, she admitted that Macdonald was considerate and courteous and capable—and in spite of it she hated him, and unfortunately she had let him see it. (p. 122)\n\nAs Macdonald’s investigations proceed, it becomes clear that Ruth had fallen for the rather unsuitable Keith Brandon in the months before her death. Brandon – an explorer and serial womaniser at heart – had subsequently turned his attention to Ruth’s younger sister, Naomi, now conveniently out of the picture in the Hebrides. Did this spurning of affection for Brandon prompt Ruth to commit suicide, or was she killed deliberately – either by Brandon or by another player in the mix?\n\nSuspicion also falls on the attendees at the literary party at Upwood on the night of the tragedy. Ruth’s publisher, Vernon Montague, stood to gain from her death, having been named as her literary executor in the freshly-altered will. Also in attendance at the event were Geoffrey Stanwood, a humble novelist whose work Ruth had been championing after a chance discovery, and Charlton Fellowes, a young essayist whom she had not previously met. Interestingly, Naomi was also staying at Upwood over the weekend in question, although not present at the literary gathering itself.\n\nAs this slow-burning mystery unfolds, further sinister events occur, including a fire, two poisonings and an ‘accident’ involving two of the potential suspects, giving Macdonald plenty to get his teeth into. As ever with Lorac’s Macdonald mysteries, we see plenty of dogged policework in the investigations; and while the Chief Inspector shows as much understanding and compassion towards the Surray family as possible, he never allows these considerations to distract from uncovering the truth.\n\nInterestingly, there’s quite a strong focus on characterisation in this one. We learn more about Ruth as the mystery unfolds – a reticent, highly-strung woman who had hidden quite a lot of herself from the world, despite her career as a prolific writer. Richard, too, comes in for quite a lot of scrutiny, especially as his motives for the suppression of key information are explored. He seems to think that brilliant, intellectual women are more fragile and prone to living on their nerves than their male counterparts – a view that tips into sexism at times.\n\nThere are also some interesting asides about the ethics of the posthumous publication of a writer’s unfinished works, to the point where I began wonder if Lorac was conveying some of her own views on the subject through Ruth’s thoughts and actions.\n\nAll in all, then, a very solid, leisurely mystery with some interesting characters and motivations at its heart. The solution, when it comes, is quite an intriguing one, albeit a little obscure – not something I would have worked out for myself without Macdonald’s explanation, but technically possible nonetheless!\n\nPost After Post-Mortem is published by the British Library; my thanks to the publishers for kindly providing a review copy.\n\nOver the past few years, the publishing arm of the British Library has been carving out a very successful niche for itself, reissuing a whole host of treasures from the Golden Age of crime fiction. The Edinburgh Mystery and Other Tales of Scottish Crime is part of their occasional series of anthologies, bringing together a range of short stories connected to Scotland. Some of the mysteries are by Scottish writers, while others are set in the country itself, ranging from city-based tales, such as the titular piece, to mysteries rooted in more remote areas such as the Highlands and Islands.\n\nAs ever with these anthologies, some entries are stronger than others; and while the quality of stories feels more variable here than in some of the BL’s other themed anthologies, the best stories are very good indeed. Hopefully this review will give you a flavour of what to expect, should you decide to read the book.\n\nThe titular story, written by Baroness Orczy, is one of the more compelling mysteries in the collection – a case involving the proposed transfer of a significant fortune, some property, and a particularly splendid set of diamond jewels. There’s also a whiff of disapproval about a forthcoming wedding, a match frowned upon by certain sectors of Edinburgh society.\n\n“In Edinburgh society comments were loud and various upon the forthcoming marriage, and, on the whole, these comments were far from complimentary to the families concerned. I do not think that the Scotch are a particularly sentimental race, but there was such obvious buying, selling, and bargaining about this marriage that Scottish chivalry rose in revolt at the thought.” (p. 48)\n\nThis is a very absorbing murder mystery with a surprise or two up its sleeve, a most enjoyable and intriguing read.\n\nWhile Josephine Tey’s Madame Ville d’Aubier is one of the shortest pieces in the collection, it certainly leaves a strong impression on the reader. In this enigmatic tale, a couple decide to get away from their home in Paris for the day, ultimately ending up in a sleepy village in the country. Tey excels at conveying the deeply unsettling atmosphere of her setting, a rather unwelcoming baker’s shop where they are met with a frosty reception.\n\nAnd all at once I wanted to get out of the place. Something I did not understand was happening here. The air was thick with it, bulged with it as air does before an explosion. We were being crushed and pressed down by the potency of someone’s misery, and it was as if at any moment that pressure of misery might burst the thing that held it. I wanted to get away before something happened. (p. 160)\n\nMichael Innes’ The Fishermen is one of those good old-fashioned ‘is-it-suicide-or-could-it-be-murder?’ mysteries featuring a small number of potential suspects, each with a possible motive for the deadly deed. Set during a fishing trip in the Scottish Highlands, this is an ingenious mystery with a theatrical flavour as the victim is a playwright. Another enjoyable tale and a worthy addition to the collection.\n\nOf the stories from lesser-known writers, J. Storer Clouston’s A Medical Crime is well worth highlighting – a neat little mystery involving a series of burglaries, each including the theft of a medically-related item. Carrington – Clouston’s shrewd private investigator – devises a clever way of identifying the perpetrator, complete with a little twist at the end for an extra flourish.\n\nAugustus Muir’s The Body of Sir Henry is a particularly creepy story set on a dark, rainy night in a remote part of the Scottish Borders. There are some wonderfully atmospheric passages here, even if the tale’s outcome proves relatively easy to guess.\n\nA woman sat there, with dark furs round her face, and I’ll never forget her expression. It was one of unspeakable horror. Beside her, a man lay huddled stiffly back on the cushions. Right up to his chin he was covered with a travelling rug. He was elderly and had thick grey hair. His skin was chalk white, and his eyes were wide open and staring straight upward. The light didn’t seem to dazzle them. It would have dazzled mine if I had hadn’t had my back to it. But one quick glimpse at him was enough to tell me the important thing. The man was dead. (p. 145)\n\nP. M. Hubbard’s The Running of the Deer is an excellent story, one of my favourites in the collection. Set on a county estate in the Scottish Highlands, this is a story of jealousy, desire and a regulated deer cull that ends in tragedy – not just for the hinds but for a hunt supervisor too. This gripping mystery has a suitably ambiguous ending, raising crucial questions about the incident concerned.\n\nThe Scottish Highlands also feature in H. H. Bashford’s The Man on Ben Na Garve, another standout entry in this anthology. When Wentworth witnesses a seemingly innocent meeting between two men in a remote part of the Scottish countryside, he thinks little of it. A few months later, however, he chances upon a report of a man’s death in that very spot on the day in question – possibly related to the incident he observed, but possibly not. Should he tell the police what he saw that day or keep quiet? A dilemma that leaves Wentworth pondering what to do for the best. This is an excellent story, complete with a couple of unexpected twists at the end – I enjoyed this one a lot!\n\nAlso worthy of a mention is The Alibi Man by the Glaswegian writer Bill Knox, an utterly terrifying tale of revenge, kidnapping and dodgy alibis. Moreover, it all feels frighteningly plausible and contemporary, despite its 1960s setting. A very chilling little piece.\n\nFor readers who prefer lighter mysteries, John Ferguson’s The White Line should fit the bill – a hugely enjoyable story of two rivals vying for a lady’s hand. With its cruise ship setting, this delightful tale offers much in the way of glamour, gossip and romance. Another winner.\n\nLess successful for me were the following stories, including some by relatively well-known crime writers. G. K. Chesterton’s The Honour of Israel Gow, which I didn’t particularly care for despite its spooky Castle setting, and Footsteps by Anthony Wynne, another mystery with a creepy atmosphere and promising premise, only for it to stumble with an overly complex plot. Cyril Hare’s forgettable Thursday’s Child and Margot Bennet’s rather slight The Case of the Frugal Cake could easily be skipped, while the style of Jennie Melville’s Hand in Glove didn’t particularly appeal.\n\nSo, while this collection is perhaps more uneven in quality than some of the BL’s other themed anthologies, the ten or so most successful stories are very good indeed, making it worth dipping into for the highlights alone. Moreover, these anthologies are a great way of sampling a wide range of vintage crime writers to see which styles appeal. There’s quite a variety of approaches here, so while some stories will hit their marks, others may not – which is all part of the fun, I guess!"
