He was the son of Ramon Berenguer IV of Barcelona and Petronilla of Aragon and the first King of Aragon who was also Count of Barcelona. He is thus sometimes called, like his successors, especially by Catalan historians, the \"count-king\". He was also Count of Provence from 1167, which he acquired from the heiress Douce II, until 1173, when he ceded it to his brother Berenguer. His reign has been characterised by nationalistic and nostalgic Catalan historians, as l'engrandiment occitÃ nic or \"the Pyrenean unity\": a great scheme to unite various lands on both sides of the Pyrenees under the rule of the House of Barcelona.[2]\n\nContents [hide]\n\n1 Reign\n\n2 Literary patronage and poetry\n\n3 Marriage and descendants\n\n4 References\n\n5 External links\n\nReignBorn Raymond Berengar (Ramon Berenguer) at Huesca, he ascended the united throne of Aragon and Barcelona as Alfonso, changing his name in deference to the Aragonese, to honour Alfonso I.\n\nFor most of his reign he was allied with Alfonso VIII of Castile, both against Navarre and against the Moorish taifa kingdoms of the south. In his Reconquista effort Alfonso pushed as far as Teruel, conquering this important stronghold on the road to Valencia in 1171. The same year saw him capturing Caspe.\n\nApart from common interests, kings of Aragon and Castile were united by a formal bond of vassalage the former owed to the latter. Besides, on January 18, 1174 in Zaragoza Alfonso married Infanta Sancha of Castile, sister of the Castilian king.\n\nAnother milestone in this alliance was the Treaty of Cazorla between the two kings in 1179, delineating zones of conquest in the south along the watershed of the rivers JÃºcar and Segura. Southern areas of Valencia including Denia were thus secured to Aragon.\n\nDuring his reign Aragonese influence north of the Pyrenees reached its zenith, a natural tendency given the affinity between the Occitan and Catalan dominions of the Crown of Aragon. His realms incorporated not only Provence, but also the counties of Cerdanya and Roussillon (inherited in 1172). BÃ©arn and Bigorre paid homage to him in 1187. Alfonso's involvement in the affairs of Languedoc, which would cost the life of his successor, Peter II of Aragon, for the moment proved highly beneficial, strengthening Aragonese trade and stimulating emigration from the north to colonise the newly reconquered lands in Aragon.\n\nIn 1186, he helped establish Aragonese influence in Sardinia when he supported his cousin Agalbursa, the widow of the deceased Judge of Arborea, Barison II, in placing her grandson, the child of her eldest daughter Ispella, Hugh, on the throne of Arborea in opposition to Peter of Serra.\n\nAlfonso II provided the first land grant to the Cistercian monks on the banks of the Ebro River in the Aragon region, which would become the site of the first Cistercian monastery in this region. Real Monasterio de Nuestra Senora de Rueda was founded in the year 1202 and utilized some of the first hydrological technology in the region for harnessing water power and river diversion for the purpose of building central heating.\n\nHe died at Perpignan in 1196.\n\nLiterary patronage and poetryHe was a noted poet of his time and a close friend of King Richard the Lionheart. One tensÃ³, apparently composed by him and Giraut de Bornelh, forms part of the poetical debate as to whether a lady is dishonoured by taking a lover who is richer than herself. The debate had been begun by Guilhem de Saint-Leidier and was taken up by Azalais de Porcairagues and Raimbaut of Orange; there was also a partimen on the topic between Dalfi d'Alvernha and Perdigon.\n\nAlfonso and his love affairs are mentioned in poems by many troubadours, including Guillem de BerguedÃ (who criticized his dealings with Azalais of Toulouse) and Peire Vidal, who commended Alfonso's decision to marry Sancha rather than Eudokia Komnene that he had preferred a poor Castilian maid to the emperor Manuel's golden camel.\n\nMarriage and descendants\n\nAlfonso and Sancho, surrounded by the women of court. From the Liber feudorum maior.Wife, Sancha of Castile, daughter of king Alfonso VII of Castile, b. 1155 or 1157, d. 1208\n\n1.Constance, married Emeric of Hungary and later Frederick II, Holy Roman Emperor\n\n2.Eleanor, married Raymond VI of Toulouse\n\n3.Peter the Catholic, successor\n\n4.Douce (DolÃ§a), nun\n\n5.Alfonso, Count of Provence\n\n6.Ferdinand, Abbot of Montearagon, d. after 1227\n\n7.Ramon Berenguer, d. in the 1190s\n\n8.Sancha of Aragon, married Raymond VII, in March 1211. They had one daughter, Joan, and were divorced in 1241.\n\nNote on Wife: Sancha + of CASTILE\n\nSancha of Castile (21 September 1154/5 â 9 November 1208) was the only surviving child of King Alfonso VII of Castile by his second queen, Richeza of Poland, who was the daughter of Vladislav II, Duke of Silesia.\n\nOn January 18, 1174 she married King Alfonso II of Aragon at Zaragoza.\n\nA patroness of troubadours such as Giraud de Calanson and Peire Raymond, the queen became involved in a legal dispute with her husband concerning properties which formed part of her dower estates. In 1177 she entered the county of Ribagorza and took forcible possession of various castles and fortresses which had belonged to the crown there.\n\nAfter her husband died at Perpignan in 1196, Sancha was relegated to the background of political affairs by her son Pedro II, and she retired from court, withdrawing to the abbey of Nuestra Senora, at Sijena, which she had founded. There she assumed the cross of the Order of St John of Jerusalem which she wore till the end of her life. The queen mother entertained her widowed daughter Queen Constanza of Hungary (1179-1222) at Sijena prior to her leaving Aragon for her marriage with the emperor Frederick II in 1208. She died soon afterwards, aged fifty-four, and was interred before the high altar of the church at Sijena.\n\n[edit] IssueSancha and Alfonso had 9 children, but only seven would survive into adulthood:\n\nConstance of Aragon, married King Imre of Hungary and later, Frederick II, Holy Roman Emperor\n\nLeonor, married Count Raymond VI of Toulouse\n\nPeter II of Aragon (I of Barcelona), b. 1174, killed at the Battle of Muret, September 12, 1213\n\nDolÃ§a (nun)\n\nAlfonso II, Count of Provence, b. 1180, d. 1209\n\nFernando, Abbot of Montearagon, d. after 1227\n\nRamon Berenguer, d. in the 1190s"
