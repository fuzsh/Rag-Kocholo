        "text": "For other people named Constance of Sicily, see Constance of Sicily (disambiguation).\n\nFor other people named Constance of Aragon, see Constance of Aragon (disambiguation).\n\nConstance of Sicily (1304/1306–after 19 June 1344) was the oldest daughter of Frederick III of Sicily and his wife Eleanor of Anjou. She was married three times. From these marriages she gained various titles such as Queen of Cyprus, nominal Queen of Jerusalem and Queen of Armenia.\n\nContents\n\n1 Family\n\n2 Life\n\n3 Ancestry\n\n4 References\n\nFamily\n\nConstance was one of the older of the eight children born to her parents. Her siblings included: Elizabeth, Duchess of Bavaria, Peter II of Sicily, Manfred of Athens and William II of Athens.\n\nConstance's maternal grandparents were Charles II of Naples and his wife Maria of Hungary, daughter of Stephen V of Hungary and Elizabeth the Cuman, who was daughter of Köten.\n\nHer paternal grandparents were Peter III of Aragon and another Constance of Sicily, daughter of Manfred of Sicily, son of Frederick II, Holy Roman Emperor and Bianca Lancia.\n\nLife\n\nConstance was originally betrothed to Prince Robert, youngest son of Philip IV of France and Joan I of Navarre.[1] The engagement was probably broken when Robert died young in 1307.\n\nConstance was firstly married on 16 October 1317 to Henry II of Cyprus and Jerusalem, who was son of Hugh III of Cyprus. By this marriage Constance was Queen consort of Cyprus and Jerusalem. They were married for seven years until 31 August 1324 when Henry died. They had no children.\n\nOn 29 December 1331 Constance married her second husband Leo IV, King of Armenia. The Papal Dispensation was issued the same day. Leo was strongly pro-Western and favoured a union of the Armenian and Roman churches, which deeply displeased the native barons. His marriage to Constance further aroused anti-Western sentiment. Constance was Leo's second wife, his first wife Alice of Korikos and her father Oshin were murdered on Leo's orders because Oshin had murdered Leo's aunt Princess Isabella to remove her from possibly inheriting Armenia.\n\nOn 28 December 1341 Leo was murdered by his own barons. It was the day before the couple's tenth wedding anniversary. They had no children.\n\nConstance married her third and final husband John of Lusignan in 1343. This marriage was also childless, and Constance died sometime after 19 June 1344. John remarried to Alice of Ibelin, by whom he had a son and heir, Jacques.\n\nAncestry\n\nAncestors of Constance of Sicily, Queen of Cyprus\n\n16. Peter II of Aragon 8. James I of Aragon 17.
