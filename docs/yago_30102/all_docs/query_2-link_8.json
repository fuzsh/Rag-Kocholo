        "text": "Louis VII (1120 – September 18, 1180), called the Younger, or the Young was King of the Franks from 1137 to 1180. He was the son and successor of King Louis VI of the Franks (hence the epithet “the Young”) and Duchess Eleanor of Aquitaine, one of the wealthiest and most powerful women in western Europe. Duchess Eleanor of Aquitaine was the eldest child of be Guillaume X, Duke of Aquitaine, and Aénor de Châtellerault.\n\nShe became duchess upon her father’s death in April 1137, and three months later she married Prince Louis, son of her guardian King Louis VI of France. Shortly afterwards, Louis VI died and Eleanor’s husband ascended the throne, as King Louis VII of the Franks making Eleanor Queen Consort. The marriage temporarily extended the Capetian lands to the Pyrenees.\n\nAs part of the Second Crusade in 1147, King Louis VII stayed at the court of King Géza II of Hungary on the way to Jerusalem. During his stay in the Holy Land disagreements with his wife led to a deterioration in their marriage. She persuaded him to stay in Antioch but King Louis VII instead wanted to fulfil his vows of pilgrimage to Jerusalem. He was later involved in the failed siege of Damascus and eventually returned to France in 1149.\n\nLouis’ reign saw the founding of the University of Paris. He and his counsellor Abbot Suger, pushed for greater centralisation of the state and favoured the development of French Gothic architecture, notably the construction of Notre-Dame de Paris.\n\nKing Louis VII marriage with Eleanor of Aquitaine was annulled in 1152 after no male heir was produced. Immediately after their annulment, Eleanor married Henry Plantagenet, Duke of Normandy and Count of Anjou, to whom she conveyed Aquitaine, which following Henry’s ascension to the English throne as King Henry II of England he created an Angevin Empire.\n\nLater, King Louis VII supported King HenryII’s rebellious sons to foment further disunity in the Angevin realms.\n\nKing Louis VII went on to marry his second cousin, Infanta Constance of Castile, but still failed to produce a male heir. Infanta Constance of Castile was a daughter of King Alfonso VII of Castile and León and Infanta Berengaria of Barcelona, but her year of birth is not known.\n\nInfanta Constance died in childbirth with their second daughter.\n\nWhen King Louis VII’s second wife, Infanta Constance of Castile, died in childbirth in 1160, he was devastated and became convinced that he would die young as well, fearing that the country would fall into chaos as he had no male heir. As he was desperate for a son, the 40 year-old King Louis VII married 20-year-old Adela of Champagne five weeks later, on November 13, 1160.\n\nAdela of Champagne was the third child and first daughter of Theobald II, Count of Champagne and Matilda of Carinthia, and had nine brothers and sisters. Adela of Champagne was named after her paternal grandmother Adela of Normandy, a daughter of William the Conqueror, King of England, and Matilda of Flanders who later became the countess of Blois, Chartres, and Meaux by marriage to Count Stephen II of Blois. Adela of Normandy was the mother of King Stephen of England and Bishop Henry of Winchester.\n\nAdela of Champagne’s coronation was held the same day. She went on to give birth to Louis VII’s only son, later King Philippe II Augusté of France and to the future Byzantine Empress Agnes.\n\nAgnes of France first married Alexios II Komnenos, Byzantine Emperor from 1180 to 1183. In the Byzantine Empire Princess Agnes of France was renamed Anna. In 1183 Maria of Antioch was displaced by a new power behind the throne, Andronikos I Komnenos. Andronikos was crowned co-ruler with Emperor Alexios II; then, in October of the same year, he had Emperor Alexios II strangled. Anna was now 12, and the approximately 65-year-old new Byzantine Emperor Andronikos married her. The union remained childless.\n\nEmperor Alexander II of Russia and Empress Maria Alexandrovna had grown fond of Dagmar, and they wanted her to marry their new heir, Tsarevich Alexander Alexandrovich. In an affectionate letter, Emperor Alexander II told Dagmar that he hoped she would still consider herself a member of their family.\n\nEmpress Maria Alexandrovna tried to convince Louise of Hesse-Cassel to send Dagmar to Russia immediately, but Louise insisted that Dagmar must “strengthen her nerves… [and] avoid emotional upsets.” Dagmar, who sincerely mourned Nicholas, and Tsarevich Alexander Alexandrovich, who was in love with his mother’s lady-in-waiting Mariya Meshcherskaya, and attempted to renounce his place as heir to the throne in order to marry her, were both initially reluctant. However, under pressure from his parents, Tsarevich Alexander Alexandrovich decided to go to Denmark.\n\nIn June 1866, Tsarevich Alexander Alexandrovich arrived in Copenhagen with his brothers Grand Duke Vladimir Alexandrovich and Grand Duke Alexei Alexandrovich. While looking over photographs of Nicholas, Alexander asked Dagmar if “she could love him after having loved Nixa, to whom they were both devoted.” She answered that she could love no one but him, because he had been so close to his brother.\n\nTsarevich Alexander Alexandrovich recalled that “we both burst into tears… [and] I told her that my dear Nixa helped us much in this situation and that now of course he prays about our happiness.” On June 17, he proposed to her during a picnic to the beach at Hellebæk by the coast of the Øresund strait near Elsinore and received a yes.\n\nThe engagement was announced on June 23rd at Fredensborg Palace. Both Dagmar and Alexander quickly embraced the prospect of marrying each other, and were soon described as genuinely enthusiastic.\n\nIn the time leading up to Dagmar’s departure to Russia, many festive events took place in Copenhagen, On September 22, 1866, Dagmar left Copenhagen on board the Danish royal yacht Slesvig escorted by the armoured frigate Peder Skram, and accompanied by her brother, Crown Prince Frederik.\n\nHans Christian Andersen, who had occasionally been invited to tell stories to Dagmar and her siblings when they were children, was among the crowd which flocked to the quay in order to see her off. The writer remarked in his diary, “Yesterday, at the quay, while passing me by, she stopped and took me by the hand.\n\nMy eyes were full of tears. What a poor child! Oh Lord, be kind and merciful to her! They say that there is a brilliant court in Saint Petersburg and the tsar’s family is nice; still, she heads for an unfamiliar country, where people are different and religion is different and where she will have none of her former acquaintances by her side.”\n\nDagmar was warmly welcomed in Kronstadt by the emperor’s brother Grand Duke Constantine Nikolayevich of Russia and escorted to St. Petersburg, where she was greeted by her future mother-in-law and sister-in-law on September 24th.\n\nThe weather on this September day was almost summery with temperatures of more than 20 degrees, which was noted by the poet Fyodor Ivanovich Tyutchev in the welcome poem dedicated to the arrival of the princess: The sky is light blue… On the 29th, she made her formal entry in to the Russian capital dressed in a Russian national costume in blue and gold and traveled with the Empress to the Winter Palace where she was introduced to the Russian public on a balcony.\n\nCatherine Radziwill described the occasion: “rarely has a foreign princess been greeted with such enthusiasm… from the moment she set foot on Russian soil, succeeded in winning to herself all hearts. Her smile, the delightful way she had of bowing to the crowds…, laid immediately the foundation of …popularity”\n\nIn the following weeks, Dagmar was educated in Russian court etiquette. She converted to Russian Orthodoxy on October 24, 1866 and became Grand Duchess Maria Feodorovna of Russia the following day. However, at the Russian court, where French was practically the first language, she was often called “Marie”.\n\nThe lavish wedding took place on November 9 , 1866 in the Imperial Chapel of the Winter Palace in Saint Petersburg. Financial constraints had prevented her parents from attending the wedding, and in their stead, they sent her brother, Crown Prince Frederik. Her brother-in-law, Prince Albert Edward of the United Kingdom, the Prince of Wales, had also travelled to Saint Petersburg for the ceremony; pregnancy had Prevented Princess Alexandra, the Princess of Wales, from attending.\n\nAfter the wedding night, Tsarevich Alexander Alexandrovich wrote in his diary, “I took off my slippers and my silver embroidered robe and felt the body of my beloved next to mine… How I felt then, I do not wish to describe here. Afterwards we talked for a long time.”\n\nFrom The Emperor’s Desk: Before I address the wedding of Princess Dagmar of Denmark and Emperor Alexander III of Russia, I will cover Dagmar’s engagement to Alexander’s brother, Nicholas Alexandrovich, Tsesarevich of Russia.\n\nPrincess Dagmar of Denmark [Maria Feodorovna] (November 26, 1847 – October 13, 1928), known before her marriage as Princess Dagmar of Denmark, was Empress of Russia from 1881 to 1894 as the wife of Emperor Alexander III.\n\nShe was the fourth child and second daughter of King Christian IX of Denmark and Louise of Hesse-Cassel, the daughter of Prince Wilhelm of Hesse-Cassel and Princess Charlotte of Denmark, a daughter of Frederik, Hereditary Prince of Denmark and Norway, and Sophia Frederica of Mecklenburg-Schwerin. Her\n\nPrincess Charlotte of Denmark’s father was a younger son of King Frederik V of Denmark and Norway, while her mother was a daughter of Duke Ludwig of Mecklenburg-Schwerin.\n\nAt birth she had two older siblings, Prince Christian Frederik of Denmark and Norway (who later became King Christian Frederik of Norway in 1814 and was King Christian VIII of Denmark from 1839) and Princess Juliane Sophie. She later had a younger brother, Prince Frederik Ferdinand.\n\nGrowing up, she was known by the name Dagmar. Most of her adult life, however, she was known as Maria Feodorovna, the name which she took when she converted to Russian Orthodoxy immediately before her 1866 marriage to the future Emperor Alexander III. Within her family, she was known as “Minnie” throughout her life.\n\nAt the end of 1863, as the daughter and sister of the kings of Denmark and Greece and sister-in-law of the Prince of Wales, Dagmar was now considered one of Europe’s most coveted princesses. She received a proposal from Crown Prince Umberto of Italy, but was reluctant to marry him because she found him unattractive.\n\nHer mother was also reluctant to support such a marriage as she saw a greater status in the prospect of Dagmar marrying into the Russian imperial family. Due to the rise of Slavophile ideology in the Russian Empire, Alexander II of Russia searched for a bride for the heir apparent, Nicholas Alexandrovich, Tsesarevich of Russia, in countries other than the German states that had traditionally provided consorts for the tsars.\n\nPrincess Dagmar was one of the candidates, and as early as 1860 the emperor had made his first inquiries about a possible engagement. There were also already family ties between the two families, as Dagmar’s uncle, Prince Friedrich Wilhelm of Hesse-Cassel, had been married to the Emperor’s sister, Grand Duchess Alexandra Nikolaevna of Russia.\n\nIn 1864, the Russian Empress Maria Alexandrovna announced that her son would visit Denmark, and during the summer Nicholas, or “Nixa” as he was known in his family, arrived at Fredensborg Palace, where the Danish royal family was staying. Nicholas had never met Dagmar, but had for a number of years collected photographs of her, and both families wanted the marriage. When they met, Dagmar and Nicholas were mutually attracted, and Nicholas wrote to his mother:\n\nI came here as if in a fever (…) I can not describe to you what came over me, when we approached Fredenborg and I finally saw the sweet Dagmar. How can I describe it? She is so beautiful, direct, intelligent, experienced, and yet shy at the same time. She is even more beautiful in reality than in the pictures we have seen so far.\n\nAfter returning to Russia to obtain his father’s permission, Nicholas proposed to Dagmar on September 28, 1864 in the Bernstorff Palace Gardens and received a yes. The engagement was announced at Bernstorff Palace later the same day. Her future mother-in-law Maria Alexandrovna (Marie of Hesse and By Rhine) gave her a six-strand pearl necklace and Nicholas gave her a diamond bracelet. In total, the betrothal gifts Dagmar received from her future in-laws cost 1.5 million rubles.\n\nThe engagement was popular in both countries and at the same time ensured the Danish royal family even better connections. The engagement took place right during the Second Schleswig War between Denmark on one side and Prussia and Austria on the other, and during the peace negotiations after the war in October 1864, Dagmar unsuccessfully asked her future father-in-law to help Denmark against Prussia over the disputed territory of Schleswig-Holstein.\n\nIn a letter, she asked Emperor Alexander II of Russia: “Use your power to mitigate the terrible conditions which the Germans have brutally forced Papa to accept… the sad plight of my fatherland, which makes my heart heavy, has inspired me to turn to you.” It is believed that she did it with the consent of her parents, but it is not known if it was at their request. Her appeal was in vain, but from that moment on she became known for her anti-Prussian views.\n\nDeathbed of Tsarevich Nicholas.\n\nAs Nicholas continued on his journey to Florence, Dagmar and Nicholas exchanged daily love letters for months. When he grew ill, Nicholas sent fewer letters and Dagmar teasingly asked him if he had fallen in love with “a dark-eyed Italian”. In April, Nicholas grew gravely ill with cerebrospinal meningitis.\n\nEmperor Alexander II of Russia sent a telegram to Dagmar: “Nicholas has received the Last Rites. Pray for us and come if you can.” On April 22, 1865, Nicholas died in the presence of his parents, brothers, and Dagmar. His last wish was that Dagmar would marry his younger brother, the future Alexander III.\n\nDagmar was devastated by Nicholas’ death. Nicholas’ parents struggled to “pull Princess Dagmar away from the corpse and carry her out.” She was so heartbroken when she returned to her homeland that her relatives were seriously worried about her health. She had already become emotionally attached to Russia and often thought of the huge, remote country that was to have been her home.\n\nMany were sympathetic towards Dagmar. Princess Mary Adelaide of Cambridge wrote of “poor dear Minny’s sorrow and the blight which has fallen upon her young life.” Queen Victoria wrote “how terrible for poor Dagmar… the poor parents and bride are most deeply to be pitied.”\n\nPrincess María de las Mercedes of Orléans (June 24, 1860 – June 26, 1878) was Queen of Spain as the first wife of King Alfonso XII of Spain. She was born in Madrid, the daughter of Prince Antoine of Orléans, Duke of Montpensier, and Infanta Luisa Fernanda of Spain.\n\nHer father, Prince Antoine of Orléans, Duke of Montpensier, was her first cousin once removed, and the youngest son of King Louis-Philippe of France and his wife Maria Amelia Teresa of the Two Sicilies, the tenth of eighteen children of King Ferdinand I of the Two Sicilies and Archduchess Maria Carolina of Austria.\n\nHer mother, Infanta Luisa Fernanda of Spain, was the younger daughter of King Fernando VII of Spain and his fourth wife and niece, Maria Christina of the Two Sicilies, the daughter of King Francis I of the Two Sicilies by his second wife, Infanta Maria Isabella of Spain, the youngest daughter of King Carlos IV of Spain and his wife Maria Luisa of Parma. Infanta Maria Isabella of Spain was the sister King Fernando VII of Spain, the father of Infanta Luisa Fernanda of Spain.\n\nInfanta Luisa Fernanda of Spain elder sister was Queen Isabella II of Spain.\n\nBorn at the Palacio Real in Madrid on June 24, 1860, Mercedes was the sixth of her parents’ nine children. Her mother’s elder sister, Queen Isabella II, and brother-in-law, King Francisco, served as Mercedes’ godparents at her christening, when she was given the names: María de las Mercedes Isabel Francisca de Asís Antonia Luisa Fernanda Felipa Amalia Cristina Francisca de Paula Ramona Rita Cayetana Manuela Juana Josefa Joaquina Ana Rafaela Filomena Teresa Santísima Trinidad Gaspara Melchora Baltasara et omni sancti.\n\nAlthough Mercedes was patrilineally a French Princess, she was also a Spanish infanta and spent the first eight years of her life in Spain. Her childhood was spent at the Palace of San Telmo in Andalusia, her father’s rumoured aspirations to obtain his sister-in-law’s crown periodically rendering him unwelcome at the royal court in Madrid.\n\nMarriage and reign\n\nWhen Queen Isabella II was deposed in 1868, Mercedes’ family left Spain for exile. It was reportedly during that banishment in 1872 that she met her first cousin Infante Alfonso, Prince of Asturias, also living in exile. Queen Isabella II opposed a marriage between the two due to the hostilities between Mercedes’ father and the former Queen.\n\nUpon restoration, King Alfonso XII of Spain married María de las Mercedes at the church of Atocha in Madrid on January 23, 1878, following a huge ball in December 1877. Allegedly, the King’s choice dashed the hopes of his still-exiled mother Queen Isabella for Alfonso’s marriage to Infanta Blanca de Bourbon, daughter of his Carlist rival Infante Carlos, Duke of Madrid.\n\nInfanta Blanca of Spain (1868 – 1949) was the eldest child of Infante Carlos, Duke of Madrid, Carlist claimant to the throne of Spain and his wife Princess Margherita of Bourbon-Parma. Blanca was a member of the House of Bourbon and – according to the Carlists – an Infanta of Spain by birth.\n\nIn 1889 she married Archduke Leopold Salvator of Austria. The couple had ten children. The family left Austria after the end of the Monarchy and finally settled in Barcelona. When the male line of Blanca’s family died out at the death of her uncle, Alfonso Carlos, Duke of San Jaime, some of the Carlists recognized her as the legitimate heiress to the Spanish throne.\n\nQueen Mercedes helped build a new temple after the Church of Santa María de la Almudena was demolished in 1868.\n\nDeath\n\nShortly after their honeymoon, it became evident that Queen Mercedes suffered from typhoid fever. The marriage would last only six months, during which she reportedly had a miscarriage. She died due to the fever on June 26, 1878, just two days after her 18th birthday.\n\nWhen the King’s minister Cánovas del Castillo suggested that he take a new wife, King Alfonso XII acquiesced, choosing Mercedes’ sister Infanta María Cristina. For a few months he courted Infanta María Cristina, who was willing to replace her late sister, but it soon became clear that she was suffering from tuberculosis. Maria Cristina died at the age of 26 on April 28, 1879 in her native Seville\n\nIn late 1879, the King married Archduchess Maria Christina of Austria-Teschen; a daughter of Archduke Charles Ferdinand of Austria (grandson of Emperor Leopold II) and his wife, Archduchess Elisabeth Franziska of Austria, the daughter of Palatine Joseph of Hungary, Archduke of Austria (1776–1847) and his third wife Maria Dorothea of Württemberg (1797–1855).\n\nPalatine Joseph of Hungary, Archduke of Austria, was the ninth child and seventh son of Holy Roman Emperor Leopold II, Grand Duke of Tuscany and Infanta Maria Luisa of Spain, daughter of parents, King Carlos III of Spain, King of Naples and Sicily, and Maria Amalia of Saxony.\n\nThe eldest child, of King Alfonso XII and Archduchess Maria Christina of Austria-Teschen was Infanta María de las Mercedes (1880 – 1904) was named in honour of Queen Mercedes. She was Princess of Asturias, the heir presumptive to the Crown of Spain, for all 24 years of her life.\n\nHad her younger sibling, unborn at the death of King Alfonso XII, been a daughter, Mercedes would have been Queen of Spain. The sibling proved to be a boy, King Alfonso XIII, a King upon his birth in 1886, and Mercedes turned out not to be queen.\n\nShe resumed the position of heir presumptive, which she held until her own death, and was succeeded in it by her own infant son Prince Alfonso of the Two Sicilies, King Alfonso XIII having not yet married and fathered a legitimate child.\n\nMercedes married in Madrid on February 14, 1901, to her second cousin, Prince Carlo of Bourbon-Two Sicilies, a nephew of the King of the then-defunct Kingdom of the Two Sicilies, who was elevated to the rank of Infante of Spain. The marriage was highly controversial due to her father-in-law’s ties with the Carlists. She died three years later from complication while giving birth to her third child.\n\nMarie Antoinette (November 2, 1755 – October 16, 1793) was the last Queen of France and Navarre before the French Revolution. She was born an Archduchess of Austria, and was the penultimate child and youngest daughter of Roman Emperor Franz I, former Duke of Lorraine and his wife Archduchess Maria Theresa of Austria, Queen of Bohemia, Hungary and Croatia in her own right.\n\nMarie Antoinette was earlier in life known by the German version of her name, Maria Antonia, and was raised together with her sister, Archduchess Maria Carolina, who was three years older, and with whom she had a lifelong close relationship.\n\nHer sister Maria Carolina also married a Bourbon Prince, and was was Queen of Naples and Sicily as the wife of King Ferdinand IV-III, who later became King of the Two Sicilies. Maria Carolina was also the de facto ruler of her husband’s kingdoms,\n\nMarie Antoinette had a difficult but ultimately loving relationship with her mother, who referred to her as “the little Madame Antoine”.\n\nMarie Antoinette spent her formative years between the Hofburg Palace and Schönbrunn, the imperial summer residence in Vienna, where on October 13, 1762, when she was seven, she met Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart, two months her junior and a child prodigy.\n\nMarie Antoinette formally renounced her rights to Habsburg domains, and on April 19th when she was married, by proxy, to the Dauphin of France at the Augustinian Church in Vienna, with her brother Archduke Ferdinand standing in for the Dauphin.\n\nShe became Dauphine of France in May 1770 at the age 14 upon her marriage to Prince Louis-Augusté de Bourbon of France heir apparent to the French throne. On May 10, 1774, her husband ascended the throne as King Louis XVI of France and Navarre and she became Queen.\n\nKing Louis XVI reigned as King of France and Navarre until September 4, 1791, when he received the title of King of the French, and continued reigning as King until the monarchy was abolished.\n\nMarie Antoinette’s position at court improved when, after eight years of marriage, she started having children. She became increasingly unpopular among the people, however, with the French libelles accusing her of being profligate, promiscuous, allegedly having illegitimate children, and harboring sympathies for France’s perceived enemies—particularly her native Austria.\n\nThe false accusations of the Affair of the Diamond Necklace damaged her reputation further. During the Revolution, she became known as Madame Déficit because the country’s financial crisis was blamed on her lavish spending and her opposition to the social and financial reforms of Turgot and Necker.\n\nSeveral events were linked to Marie Antoinette during the Revolution after the government had placed the royal family under house arrest in the Tuileries Palace in October 1789. The June 1791 attempted flight to Varennes and her role in the War of the First Coalition had disastrous effects on French popular opinion.\n\nOn August 10, 1792, the attack on the Tuileries Palace forced the royal family to take refuge at the Assembly, and they were imprisoned in the Temple Prison on August 13th.\n\nOn that same day, August 10, 1792, in the context of civil and international war, King Louis XVI was suspended and arrested at the time of the Insurrection. One month later, the monarchy was abolished and the First French Republic was proclaimed on 21 September 1792.\n\nThe former King became a desacralized French citizen, addressed as Citizen Louis Capét in reference to his ancestor Hugh Capét. Louis was tried by the National Convention (self-instituted as a tribunal for the occasion), found guilty of high treason and executed by guillotine on January 21, 1793. Louis XVI was the only king of France ever to be executed, and his death brought an end to more than a thousand years of continuous French monarchy.\n\nEarly on October 16, 1793 Marie Antoinette was declared guilty of the three main charges against her: depletion of the national treasury, conspiracy against the internal and external security of the State, and high treason because of her intelligence activities in the interest of the enemy; the latter charge alone was enough to condemn her to death.\n\nAt worst, she and her lawyers had expected life imprisonment. In the hours left to her, she composed a letter to her sister-in-law Madame Élisabeth, affirming her clear conscience, her Catholic faith, and her love and concern for her children. The letter did not reach Élisabeth. Her will was part of the collection of papers of Robespierre found under his bed and was published by Edme-Bonaventure Courtois.\n\nPreparing for her execution, she had to change clothes in front of her guards. She wanted to wear a black dress but was forced to wear a plain white dress, white being the colour worn by widowed Queens of France. Her hair was shorn, her hands bound painfully behind her back and she was put on a rope leash.\n\nUnlike her husband, who had been taken to his execution in a carriage (carrosse), she had to sit in an open cart (charrette) for the hour it took to convey her from the Conciergerie via the rue Saint-Honoré thoroughfare to reach the guillotine erected in the Place de la Révolution (the present-day Place de la Concorde).\n\nShe maintained her composure, despite the insults of the jeering crowd. A constitutional priest was assigned to her to hear her final confession. He sat by her in the cart, but she ignored him all the way to the scaffold as he had pledged his allegiance to the Republic.\n\nMarie Antoinette was guillotined at 12:15 p.m. on October 16, 1793. Her last words are recorded as, “Pardonnez-moi, monsieur. Je ne l’ai pas fait exprès” or “Pardon me, sir, I did not do it on purpose”, after accidentally stepping on her executioner’s shoe.\n\nMarie Tussaud was employed to make a death mask of her head. Her body was thrown into an unmarked grave in the Madeleine cemetery, located close by in rue d’Anjou. Because its capacity was exhausted the cemetery was closed the following year, on March 25, 1794.\n\nThe phrase “Let them eat cake” is often attributed to Marie Antoinette, but there is no evidence that she ever uttered it, and it is now generally regarded as a journalistic cliché. This phrase originally appeared in Book VI of the first part of Jean-Jacques Rousseau’s autobiographical work Les Confessions, finished in 1767 and published in 1782. Rousseau ascribes these words to a “great princess”, but the purported writing date precedes Marie Antoinette’s arrival in France. Some think that he invented it altogether.\n\nBoth Marie Antoinette’s and Louis XVI’s bodies were exhumed on January 18, 1815, during the Bourbon Restoration, when Prince Louis Stanislas de Bourbon, Count of Provence ascended the newly reestablished throne as King Louis XVIII of France and of Navarre. Christian burial of the royal remains took place three days later, o January 21, in the necropolis of French kings at the Basilica of St Denis.\n\nOne interesting fact about Duke Friedrich II of Württemberg is that he was known for his size, at 2.12 m (6 ft 11 in) and about 200 kg (440 lb).\n\nIn 1800, the French army occupied Württemberg and Duke Friedrich II and Duchess Charlotte of Württemberg fled to Vienna to the court of Holy Roman Emperor Franz II. The following year, Duke Friedrich II concluded a private treaty that ceded Montbéliard to France and brought him Ellwangen in exchange two years later.\n\nIn 1803 came the great Reichsdeputationshauptschluss which was basically a reorganizing of the territories of the Empire through secularization and mediatization. Sometimes referred to in English as the Final Recess or the Imperial Recess of 1803. This resolution was passed by the Reichstag (Imperial Diet) of the Holy Roman Empire on March 24, 1803. It was ratified by Emperor Franz II and became law on April 27th. It proved to be the last significant law enacted by the Empire before its dissolution in 1806.\n\nDuke Friedrich II then assumed the title Prince-Elector of Württemberg on February 25, 1803, and he was the first and only Prince-Elector of Württemberg from 1803 to 1806, before the raising of Württemberg to a kingdom in 1806 with the approval of Emperor Napoleon I.\n\nIn exchange for providing France with a large auxiliary force, Napoleon recognized the Prince-Elector as King Friedrich of Württemberg on December 26, 1805. Princess-Electress Charlotte became Queen of Württemberg when her husband formally ascended the throne on January 1, 1806.\n\nThe newly elevated King of Württemberg’s alliance with France technically made him the enemy of his father-in-law, King George III (now King of the United Kingdom of Great Britain). King George III, incensed by his son-in-law’s assumption of the Royal title and his role as one of Napoleon’s most devoted vassals, accordingly refused to address his daughter as “Queen of Württemberg” in correspondence.\n\nIn 1813, King Friedrich changed sides and went over to the Allies, where his status as the brother-in-law of the Prince Regent (later King George IV) helped his standing. After the fall of Napoleon, he attended the Congress of Vienna where his position as King of Württemberg was confirmed. King Friedrich of Württemberg died childless on October 30, 1816.\n\nHe was succeeded by his eldest son Prince Friedrich Wilhelm of Württemberg, (known as “Fritz” until the beginning of his reign) by his first wife, Duchess Augusta of Brunswick-Wolfenbüttle (1764–1788) eldest child of Charles Wilhelm Ferdinand, Duke of Brunswick-Wolfenbüttle and Princess Augusta of Great Britain, the elder sister of George III of the United Kingdom. She was named in honour of her mother and grandmother. Augusta was the eldest of seven children, and her younger sister, Princess Caroline, would marry the future George IV of the United Kingdom.\n\nAlthough in King Friedrich’s declining years, he and his son no longer had any political and personal conflicts, Prince Friedrich Wilhelm was eager to display a new era of political change and power. As such, he did away with his first name of Friedrich and chose his second name of Wilhelm as his regnal name. He could have just as easily reigned as King Friedrich II of Württemberg.\n\nDowager Queen\n\nThe Dowager Queen Charlotte of Württemberg continued to live at the Ludwigsburg Palace, near Stuttgart, and received visits from her younger siblings, Prince Edward, the Duke of Kent, Prince Augustus Frederick, the Duke of Sussex, Prince Adolphus Frederick, the Duke of Cambridge, the Landgravine Princess Elizabeth of Hesse-Homburg, and Princess Augusta Sophia. She was a godmother (by proxy) at the christening of her niece, Princess Alexandria Victoria of Kent (the future Queen Victoria of the United Kingdom), in 1819.\n\nIn 1827, Charlotte returned to Britain for the first time since her wedding in 1797. By that time, the sixty year old princess was very heavy and wanted to have surgery for dropsy in England. Steam propulsion had just been introduced on the Rhine, and ensured that the voyage back home would be convenient.\n\nOn May 31 she embarked on the new steamboat Friedrich Wilhelm. After descending the Rhine the steamboat arrived at Bath on the Western Scheldt. Due to her weight, Charlotte had to be lifted aboard Royal Sovereign on a chair that was hoisted. Due to bad weather, Royal Sovereign then had to leave Bath, and anchor near Vlissingen.\n\nOn June 5, Dowager Queen Charlotte was in Greenwich. In London, she resided at St James’s Palace, where she received many visits from her family. Her brother, now King George IV, made a final visit from Windsor Castle on October 6th.\n\nOn Tuesday October 9th, Charlotte left England on board Royal Sovereign, but a storm forced her back into Harwich. On the 14th, Royal Sovereign anchored before Klundert on the Hollands Diep. After spending the night on board, Charlotte embarked on the steamboat Stad Nijmegen.\n\nOn October 19, she arrived in Frankfurt, where she met King Wilhelm I of Württemberg and Queen Pauline of Württemberg and her brother Prince Adolphus Frederick, the Duke of Cambridge.\n\nQueen Pauline of Württemberg was born in Riga, one of the five children of Duke Ludwig of Württemberg and his wife, Princess Henriette of Nassau-Weilburg. Her siblings included Maria Dorothea, Archduchess of Austria; Amelia, Duchess of Saxe-Hildburghausen; Elisabeth Alexandrine, Princess of Baden, and Duke Alexander of Württemberg himself the founder of the Teck branch of the family.\n\nOn October 24th Dowager Queen Charlotte was back at Ludwigsburg Palace. The next year on October 6, 1828 Charlotte died at Ludwigsburg Palace and is buried in its royal vault.\n\nCharlotte, Princess Royal (September 29, 1766 – October 6, 1828), was Queen of Württemberg as the wife of King Friedrich I. She was the eldest daughter and fourth child of King George III Great Britain and his wife, Duchess Charlotte of Mecklenburg-Strelitz, the youngest daughter of Duke Charles Ludwig Friedrich of Mecklenburg, Prince of Mirow (1708–1752), and his wife Princess Elisabeth Albertine of Saxe-Hildburghausen (1713–1761). Mecklenburg-Strelitz was a small north-German duchy in the Holy Roman Empire.\n\nCharlotte was officially designated as Princess Royal on June 22, 1789. The title had been vacant since 1757 with the death of the last holder, Sophia Dorothea of Hanover, the only daughter of Georg Ludwig, Prince-Elector of Hanover, later King George I of Great Britain, and his wife, Sophia Dorothea of Celle. She was detested by her elder brother, King George II of Great Britain. She was the mother of King Friedrich II the Great of Prussia.\n\nAfter the birth of three sons in a row, her parents were delighted to have Princess Charlotte in the nursery. Like all of her siblings, Charlotte was inoculated, in her case, in December 1768 along with her brother William. As the eldest daughter of the monarch, Charlotte was assumed to be destined for an important marriage on the continent, and her education was considered to be of the utmost importance, beginning when she was only eighteen months old.\n\nThough she was the eldest daughter, Charlotte was constantly compared to her sister Augusta Sophia, only two years younger than she. When Augusta was a month old, Lady Mary Coke called her “the most beautiful baby I have ever seen” while Charlotte was “very plain”. Passing judgement once again three years later, Charlotte was now “the most sensible agreeable child I ever saw, but in my opinion far from pretty” while Augusta was still “rather pretty”.\n\nAlthough the Princess Royal was never as beautiful as her younger sister, she did not share in Augusta’s primary flaw: painful shyness. Charlotte also had a stammer that her attendant Mary Dacres tried to help her young charge manage. In 1770, the cluster of the three eldest princesses was completed with the birth of Princess Elizabeth, the seventh child.\n\nMarriage\n\nOn May 18, 1797, the Princess Royal was married at the Chapel Royal, St James’s Palace, London, to Hereditary Prince Friedrich of Württemberg, the eldest son and heir apparent of Friedrich II Eugene, Duke of Württemberg and his wife, Margravine Sophia Dorothea of Brandenburg-Schwedt, a daughter of the Hohenzollern Prince, Margrave Friedrich Wilhelm of Brandenburg-Schwedt and Princess Sophia Dorothea of Prussia.\n\nMargravine Sophia Dorothea of Brandenburg-Schwedt’s mother, Princess Sophia Dorothea of Prussia, was a sister of Friedrich II the Great of Prussia, and thus a granddaughter of Princess Sophia Dorothea the only daughter of King George I of Great Britain.\n\nThe younger Friedrich succeeded his father as the reigning Duke of Württemberg on December 22, 1797. Duke Friedrich II had two sons and two daughters by his first marriage to the late Princess Augusta of Brunswick-Wolfenbüttel, the daughter of Duke Charles II of Brunswick-Wolfenbüttel and Princess Augusta of Great Britain (the elder sister of George III) and thus Charlotte’s first cousin; Princess Augusta was also the elder sister of Caroline of Brunswick-Wolfenbüttel, the estranged wife of the future George IV (then Prince of Wales).\n\nThe marriage between Duke Friedrich II and the Princess Royal produced one child: a stillborn daughter on April 27, 1798.\n\nWith the death of Queen Barbara Radziwiłł, five months after Catherine’s coronation and under distressing circumstances, compelled Sigismund to contract a third, purely political union with his first cousin, the Austrian Archduchess Catherine, to avoid an Austro-Russian alliance.\n\nArchduchess Catherine was also the sister of his first wife, Elizabeth. Catherine, unlike previous queens, was considered dull and obese. Sigismund Augustus found her immensely unattractive despite accepting the marriage and organizing a pompous wedding ceremony on July 30, 1553.\n\nOn the other hand, Catherine showed resentment towards Sigismund because of how he treated her sister and first wife, Queen Elizabeth. She accused him of negligence and indifference during her sudden illness, which caused premature death. The correspondence between the two remained purely formal and political for the remainder of their lives.\n\nUnderstandably their marriage was not happy and they had no children together.\n\nAs the couple were somewhat distant, the marriage continued for a few more years.\n\nIn February 1554, the royal couple separated for the first time. Catherine was in Parczew while Sigismund attended general Sejm in Lublin. According to royal secretary Michał Trzebuchowski, the queen was very upset by the separation and kept crying. When Sigismund visited his wife on April 9–10, Catherine informed him that she was pregnant.\n\nAt the end of April, the royal couple traveled to Lithuania and on May 25 reached Vilnius where with short breaks Catherine lived for nine years. It is unclear whether it was a miscarriage, false pregnancy, or an intrigue, but there was no birth in October 1554.\n\nIn July 1564, Ferdinand I, Holy Roman Emperor, died and was succeeded by his son as Holy Roman Emperor Maximilian II. The new emperor sent his diplomats Andreas Dudith and Wilhelm von Kurzbach to try to reconcile the couple, or if that failed, to convince Sigismund to allow her to leave Poland. The plan for Catherine to leave was discussed in May 1565.\n\nInitially Sigismund refused, fearing that it would only increase the anti-Polish sentiment in the Habsburg court, but later changed his mind because he believed that Catherine’s departure would make it easier to obtain a divorce. In late 1565, she departed to Wieluń, but Polish nobles interfered and her departure to Vienna was delayed until October 8, 1566.\n\nIt seems that Catherine accompanied her husband to general sejm in spring 1555 and to the per procura wedding of Sophia Jagiellon and Heinrich V, Duke of Brunswick-Lüneburg in January 1556. She also continued to mediate between her husband and her father, carried frequent correspondence with Albrecht, Duke of Prussia, and was known for generally favorable views on Protestantism.\n\nIn January 1565, Sigismund complained to papal nuncio Giovanni Francesco Commendone that marriage to Catherine was sinful because she was a sister of his first wife, that she hated Poland, that she caused the miscarriage in 1554, and that he was physically disgusted by his wife due to her epilepsy. Due to Habsburg influence, Pope Pius IV did not allow the divorce.\n\nIn 1565, Catherine returned to Austria. Catherine did not receive a warm welcome in Vienna as she was blamed for the failed marriage. Emperor Maximilian II extended her stay and wanted to meet with Sigismund personally to discuss the issue, but he refused.\n\nIn March 1567, Andreas Dudith relayed that Sigismund categorically refused to live with Catherine (reportedly, he once said that he would gladly become a monk if that meant he could get rid of Catherine) and that he would not protest if Catherine remained in Austria.\n\nIn a letter written to Albrecht, Duke of Prussia, a day before her departure, Catherine expressed her resolve to one day return to Poland.\n\nKing Sigismund II Augustus would not specify where Catherine should live if she returned to Poland and would not allot money for her court, in effect precluding her from returning. In June 1567, Catherine became seriously ill with what doctors called melancholia. After recovering, in October, she moved to Linz to live out the remaining five years of her life.\n\nAccording to a witness, Catherine lived like a widow. She received 28,000 guldens annually from Sigismund for her court of more than fifty people. She was visited by her family, she studied the Bible and other theological works, and established a garden for medicinal herbs which produced various herbal remedies.\n\nIt seems that she still wanted to return to Poland: she tearfully asked Giovanni Francesco Commendone for help when he visited her twice and kept writing letters to her husband. In her last will, she asked her husband for forgiveness and left him all the jewellery she had received from him. The majority of her money was left for charity.\n\nCatherine died on February 28, 1572 and was buried in castle’s chapel. When Rudolph II, Holy Roman Emperor, ordered reconstruction of the castle, her body was moved to the St. Florian Monastery on September 22, 1599. A funeral was not organized until September 22, 1614 during the reign of Emperor Matthias. The surviving sarcophagus was built in 1781.\n\nArchduchess Mary of Austria (September 15, 1505 – October 18, 1558), also known as Mary of Hungary, was Queen of Hungary, Bohemia and Croatia as the wife of King Louis II of Hungary, Bohemia and Croatia, and was later governor of the Habsburg Netherlands.\n\nArchduchess Mary of Austria was the fifth child of King Felipe I of Castile and Queen Joanna of Castile. King Felipe was born a member of the House of Habsburg as Archduke Philipp of Austria the son of Maximilian I, Holy Roman Emperor, by his first wife Mary, Duchess of Burgundy. Archduke Philipp succeeded his mother as reigning Duke of Burgundy.\n\nArchduchess Mary’s mother, Queen Joanna of Castile, was the daughter of Queen Isabella I of Castile and King Fernando II of Aragon. Infanta Joanna was married by arrangement to the Austrian Archduke Philipp the Handsome on October 20, 1496.\n\nFollowing the deaths of her elder brother Infante Juan of Castile, elder sister Infanta Isabella, and nephew Infante Miguel da Paz, Prince of Portugal, between 1497 and 1500, Infanta Joanna became the heir presumptive to the crowns of Castile and Aragon. When her mother died in 1504, she became Queen Regnant of Castile.\n\nHer father, King Fernando II of Aragon, proclaimed himself governor and administrator of Castile. King Fernando II of Aragon was also King of Castile from 1475 to 1504 (as King Fernando V). He reigned jointly with Isabella over a dynastically unified Spain; together they are known as the Catholic Monarchs.\n\nKing Fernando II-V of Castile and Aragon is considered the de facto first king of Spain, and was described as such during his reign, even though, legally, Castile and Aragon remained two separate kingdoms until they were formally united by the Nueva Planta decrees issued between 1707 and 1716.\n\nQueen Joanna’s siblings were Infanta Isabella, Queen of Portugal; husband of King Manuel I of Portugal, Infante Juan, Prince of Asturias; Infanta Maria, Queen of Portugal; the second wife of King Manuel I of Portugal,and Infanta Catherine, Queen of England and Lady of Ireland; first wife of King Henry VIII of England and Ireland.\n\nArchduchess Mary’s birth was very difficult; the Queen’s life was in danger and it took her a month to recover. On September 20, she was baptized by Nicolas Le Ruistre, Bishop of Arras, and named after her paternal grandmother, Mary of Burgundy, who had died in 1482. Her godfather was her paternal grandfather, Holy Roman Emperor Maximilian I.\n\nOn March 17, 1506, Emperor Maximilian I promised to marry her to Prince Louis of Bohemia, Hungary and Croatia the first son of King Vladislaus II of Bohemia, Hungary and Croatia and his third wife, Anne of Foix-Candale.\n\nAt the same time, the two monarchs decided that Archduke Ferdinand of Austria (future Emperor Ferdinand I) a brother of Archduchess Mary would marry Vladislaus’ daughter Princess Anne as stipulated by the First Congress of Vienna in 1515. At the time Archduke Ferdinand was a governor on behalf of his brother Emperor Charles V.\n\nAfter King Vladislaus II’s death in 1516, the minor King Louis II ascended to the throne of Bohemia, Hungary and Croatia. King Louis II was adopted by the Holy Roman Emperor Maximilian I in 1515. When Maximilian I died in 1519, Louis’s cousin Georg, Margrave of Brandenburg-Ansbach, became his legal guardian.\n\nAlso in 1515 Archduchess Mary married King Louis II of Bohemia, Hungary and Croatia. Their marriage was happy but short and childless. Upon her husband’s death following the Battle of Mohács in 1526, Queen Mary governed Hungary as regent in the name of the new king, her brother, Archduke Ferdinand I of Austria.\n\nAs Louis II’s brother-in-law Louis II, Ferdinand inherited and ruled as King of Bohemia, Hungary and Croatia (1526–1564). These Kingdoms formed a major part of the Habsburgs hereditary lands outside of the Holy Roman Empire and along with the Archduchy of Austria would form the Austrian Empire in 1804.\n\nFollowing the death of their aunt, Archduchess Margaret in 1530, Mary was asked by her eldest brother, Emperor Charles V, to assume the governance of the Netherlands. Archduchess Margaret was the second child and only daughter of Hoy Roman Emperor Maximilian and Duchess Mary of Burgundy.\n\nMargaret was named after her step-grandmother, Margaret of York, (1446 – 1503) was by marriage Duchess of Burgundy as the third wife of Charles the Bold. She was a daughter of Richard, 3rd Duke of York, and Cecily Neville, and the sister of two kings of England, Edward IV and Richard III.\n\nEmperor Charles V also asked Queen Mary to take over the guardianship over his nieces, Dorothea and Christina of Denmark, daughter’s of King Christian II of Denmark and Norway and Archduchess Isabella of Austria, sister of Holy Roman Emperor Charles V.\n\nIn 1532, Francesco II Sforza, Duke of Milan, proposed a marriage with Princess Christina of Denmark and Norway, who was then 11 years old. Charles agreed to the marriage and allowed its immediate consummation. Mary determinedly opposed this decision, explaining to Emperor Charles that Christina was too young for consummation of the marriage.\n\nEmperor Charles ignored her, but she nevertheless managed to delay the marriage. She first told the Milanese envoy that her niece was ill and then took her to another part of the Netherlands for “serious affairs”. Christina was finally married on September 28, 1532, but Mary managed to postpone her departure until March 11, 1533.\n\nPrincess Christina and Francesco had no children. Francesco II Sforza died in October 1535, leaving her widowed when she was thirteen. On July 10, 1541, Christina married François, Duke of Lorraine in Brussels. François had been betrothed to Anne of Cleves, who became the fourth wife of Henry VIII of England.\n\nAs governor of the Netherlands, Mary faced riots and a difficult relationship with the Emperor. Throughout her tenure she continuously attempted to ensure peace between the Emperor and the King François I of France.\n\nAlthough she never enjoyed governing and asked for permission to resign several times, the Queen succeeded in creating a unity between the provinces, as well as in securing for them a measure of independence from both France and the Holy Roman Empire. After her final resignation, the very frail Queen moved to Castile, where she died.\n\nArchduchess Maria Anna of Austria (September 7, 1683 – August 14, 1754) was Queen of Portugal as the wife of King João V of Portugal. She served as the regent of Portugal from 1742 until 1750 during the illness of her husband. She was born an Archduchess of Austria.\n\nBorn Maria Anna Josepha Antonia Regina, she was the eleventh child and seventh daughter of Leopold I, Holy Roman Emperor (1640–1705) by his third wife, Eleonor Magdalene of Neuburg (1655–1720), the oldest of 17 children born from Philipp Wilhelm, Count Palatine of Neuburg and Duke of Jülich-Berg and his second wife, Landgravine Elisabeth Amalie of Hesse-Darmstadt.\n\nOn her father’s side her grandparents were Wolfgang Wilhelm, Count Palatine of Neuburg and his first wife, Magdalene of Bavaria. On her mother’s side, her grandparents were Georg II, Landgrave of Hesse-Darmstadt and Sophia Eleonore of Saxony.\n\nTwo of her brothers, Archduke Joseph and Archduke Charles later became emperors, Joseph I and Charles VI (the last male Habsburg). Through Emperor Charles VI she was an aunt of Empress Maria Theresa, Queen of Bohemia, Hungary and Croatia and Archduchess of Austria and the only woman to ever rule the Habsburg dominions in her own right.\n\nDuring his life, King Pedro II had worked a long time to secure Infante João a marriage with an Austrian archduchess in order to guarantee Portugal’s alliance with the Habsburgs. King Pedro II died in his sleep on December 9, 1706 and Infante João succeeded as King João V of Portugal.\n\nKing JoãoV continued these negotiations and finally succeeded in negotiating a deal. On 27 June 1707, Fernão Teles da Silva, Count of Vilar Maior, signed a marriage contract with Holy Roman Emperor Joseph I that made official a match between King João V and the emperor’s sister, the Archduchess Maria Anna of Austria. The contract also set the archduchess’s dowry at 100,000 crowns, a vast sum for the day.\n\nThe armada that Portugal sent to escort Maria Anna from the Low Countries to Lisbon arrived in the Tagus river estuary on October 26, 1708. On October 27, 1708, Archduchess Maria Anna married King João V of Portugal (1689–1750) to seal the alliance between the two countries against France and Spain during the War of Spanish Succession\n\nThe flagship, in which Archduchess Maria Anna travelled, berthed at the docks of the private garden of Ribeira Palace, where Infante João and a party of the kingdom’s richest and most powerful nobles met the new queen for the first time. The marriage celebrations lasted until December 27; they were sumptuous and very costly.\n\nBy late 1710, João and Maria Anna had not produced an heir to the throne. It had been two years since the couple had been married, and the court was starting to question the future of the House of Braganza. In early 1711, the King met with Franciscan Cardinal Nuno da Cunha e Ataíde, High Inquisitor of the Portuguese Inquisition, who told him that if he promised God to build a Franciscan convent in Mafra, God would deliver his long desired heir.\n\nAccordingly, King João promised such a convent if Maria Anna became pregnant before the end of 1711. King João’s wish would come true later that year when Maria Anna gave birth to a daughter, Infanta Maria Barbara, on December 4, 1711.\n\nJoão and Maria Anna had a successful marriage, but lived largely separate lives. Maria Anna devoted herself to preserving the decorum of the royal court and her own religious interests, while João concerned himself with whatever pleased him at the moment.\n\nKing João kept many mistresses throughout his royal career, including Filipa de Noronha, Paula de Odivelas, Luísa Inês Antónia Machado Monteiro, Madalena Máxima de Miranda, Inácia Rosa de Távora, and Luísa Clara de Portugal.\n\nAs Queen, Maria Anna reformed the court and its customs to follow the traditions and customs of the traditional Queens of Portugal. Her greatest influence on the court and Portuguese nobility as a whole was the increase of segregation between men and women, as well as between servants and masters. Like João, Maria Anna had an exuberant taste, best shown in her famous parties: she would invite the nobility from all over the country and hold a magnificent festival, often lasting several days.\n\nRegency\n\nIn 1742 Maria Anna became regent after her husband had suffered a stroke and became partially paralyzed. When João V died on July 31, 1750, their eldest son José I of Portugal inherited the throne.\n\nShe died in the Palace of Belém on August 14, 1754. After her death, she was buried in Lisbon, but her heart was brought to Vienna and buried there in the imperial crypt.\n\nIssue\n\nMaria Anna and King João V had six children with her husband, four of whom survived infancy.\n\n1. Infanta Barbara of Portugal (1711 – 1758), became Queen of Spain as the wife of Fernando VI of Spain (1713–1759).\n\n2. Infante Pedro of Portugal (1712 – 1714), Prince of Brazil, died in infancy.\n\n3. José I, King of Portugal (1714 – 1777), married Infanta Mariana Victoria of Spain (1718–1781).\n\n4. Infante Carlos of Portugal (1716 – 1736), died before his parents.\n\n5. Pedro III, King of Portugal (1717 – 1786), married his niece Maria I, Queen (regnant) of Portugal (1734–1816).\n\n6. Infante Alexandre of Portugal (1723 – 1728), died young."
