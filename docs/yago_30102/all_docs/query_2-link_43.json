        "text": "THe beginning of Nations, those excepted of whom sacred Books have spok'n, is to this day unknown. Nor only the beginning, but the deeds also of many succeeding Ages, yea periods of Ages, either wholly unknown, or obscur'd and blemisht with Fables. Whether it were that the use of Letters came in long after, or were it the violence of barbarous inundations, or they themselves at certain revolutions of time, fatally decaying, and degenerating into Sloth and Ignorance; wherby the monuments of more ancient civility have bin som destroy'd, som lost. Perhaps dis-esteem and contempt of the public affairs then present, as not worth recording, might partly be in cause. Certainly oft-times we see that wise men, and of best abilitie, have forborn to write the Acts of thir own daies, while they beheld with a just loathing and disdain, not only how unworthy, how pervers, how corrupt, but often how ignoble, how petty, how below all History the persons and thir actions were; who either by fortune, or som rude election had attain'd as a sore judgment and ignominie upon the Land, to have cheif sway in managing the Commonwealth. But that any law, or superstition of our old Philosophers the Druids forbad the Britans to write thir memorable deeds, I know not why any out of CÃ¦sar should allege: he indeed saith, that thir doctrine they thought not lawful to commit to Letters; but in most matters else, both privat, and public, among which well may History be reck'nd, they us'd the Greek Tongue: and that the British Druids who taught those in Gaule would be ignorant of any Language known and us'd by thir Disciples, or so frequently writing other things, and so inquisitive into highest, would for want of recording be ever Children in the Knowledge of Times and Ages, is not likely. What ever might be the reason, this we find, that of British affairs, from the first peopling of the Iland to the coming of Julius CÃ¦sar, nothing certain, either by Tradition, History, or Ancient Fame hath hitherto bin left us. That which we have of oldest seeming, hath by the greater part of judicious Antiquaries bin long rejected for a modern Fable.\n\nNevertheless there being others, besides the first suppos'd Author, men not unread, nor unlerned in Antiquitie, who admitt that for approved story, which the former explode for fiction, and seeing that oft-times relations heertofore accounted fabulous have bin after found to contain in them many footsteps, and reliques of somthing true, as what we read in Poets of the Flood, and Giants little beleev'd, till undoubted witnesses taught us, that all was not fain'd; I have therfore determin'd to bestow the telling over ev'n of these reputed Tales; be it for nothing else but in favour of our English Poets, and Rhetoricians, who by thir Art will know, how to use them judiciously.\n\nI might also produce example, as Diodorus among the Greeks, Livie and others of the Latines, Polydore and Virunnius accounted among our own Writers. But I intend not with controversies and quotations to delay or interrupt the smooth course of History; much less to argue and debate long who were the first Inhabitants, with what probabilities, what authorities each opinion hath bin upheld, but shall endevor that which hitherto hath bin needed most, with plain, and lightsom brevity, to relate well and orderly things worth the noting, so as may best instruct and benefit them that read. Which, imploring divine assistance, that it may redound to his glory, and the good of the British Nation, I now begin.\n\nThat the whole Earth was inhabited before the Flood, and to the utmost point of habitable ground, from those effectual words of God in the Creation, may be more then conjectur'd. Hence that this Iland also had her dwellers, her affairs, and perhaps her stories, eev'n in that old World those many hunderd years, with much reason we may inferr. After the Flood, and the dispersing of Nations, as they journey'd leasurely from the East, Gomer the eldest Son of Japhet, and his off-spring, as by Authorities, Arguments, and Affinitie of divers names is generally beleev'd, were the first that peopl'd all these West and Northren Climes. But they of our own Writers, who thought they had don nothing, unless with all circumstance they tell us when, and who first set foot upon this Iland, presume to name out of fabulous and counterfet Authors a certain Samothes or Dis, a fowrth or sixt Son of Japhet, whom they make about 200 years after the Flood, to have planted with Colonies, first the Continent of Celtica or Gaule, and next this Iland; Thence to have nam'd it Samothea, to have reign'd heer, and after him lineally fowr Kings, Magus, Saron, Druis, and Bardus. But the forg'd Berosus, whom only they have to cite, no where mentions that either hee, or any of those whom they bring, did ever pass into Britain, or send thir people hither. So that this outlandish figment may easily excuse our not allowing it the room heer so much as of a British Fable.\n\nThat which follows, perhaps as wide from truth, though seeming less impertinent, is, that these Samotheans under the Reign of Bardus were subdu'd by Albion a Giant, Son of Neptune; who call'd the Iland after his own name, and rul'd it 44 years. Till at length passing over into Gaul, in aid of his Brother Lestrygon, against whom Hercules was hasting out of Spain into Italy, he was there slain in fight, and Bergion also his Brother.\n\nSure anough we are, that Britan hath bin anciently term'd Albion, both by the Greeks and Romans. And Mela the Geographer makes mention of a stonie shoar in Languedoc, where by report such a Battel was fought. The rest, as his giving name to the Ile, or ever landing heer, depends altogether upon late surmises. But too absurd, and too unconscionably gross is that fond invention that wafted hither the fifty daughters of a strange Dioclesian King of Syria; brought in doubtles by som illiterat pretender to somthing mistak'n in the Common Poetical Story of Danaus King of Argos, while his vanity, not pleas'd with the obscure beginning which truest Antiquity affords the Nation, labour'd to contrive us a Pedigree, as he thought, more noble. These Daughters by appointment of Danaus on the marriage-night having murder'd all thir Husbands, except Linceus, whom his Wives loialty sav'd, were by him at the suit of his Wife thir Sister, not put to death, but turn'd out to Sea in a Ship unmann'd; of which whole Sex they had incurr'd the hate: and as the Tale goes, were driv'n on this Iland. Where the Inhabitants, none but Devils, as som write, or as others, a lawless crew left heer by Albion, without Head or Governour, both entertain'd them, and had issue by them a second Breed of Giants, who tyranniz'd the Ile, till Brutus came.\n\nThe Eldest of these Dames in thir Legend they call Albina; and from thence, for which cause the whole scene was fram'd, will have the name Albion deriv'd. Incredible it may seem so sluggish a conceit should prove so ancient, as to be authoriz'd by the Elder Ninnius, reputed to have liv'd above a thousand years agoe. This I find not in him; but that Histion sprung of Japhet, had four Sons; Francus, Romanus, Alemannus, and Britto, of whom the Britans; as true, I beleeve, as that those other Nations whose names are resembl'd, came of the other three; if these Dreams give not just occasion to call in doubt the Book it self, which bears that title.\n\nHitherto the things themselvs have giv'n us a warrantable dispatch to run them soon over. But now of Brutus and his Line, with the whole Progeny of Kings, to the entrance of Julius CÃ¦sar, we cannot so easily be discharg'd; Descents of Ancestry, long continu'd, laws and exploits not plainly seeming to be borrow'd, or devis'd, which on the common beleif have wrought no small impression: defended by many, deny'd utterly by few. For what though Brutus, and the whole Trojan pretence were yeelded up, seeing they who first devis'd to bring us from som noble Ancestor were content at first with Brutus the Consul; till better invention, although not willing to forgoe the name, taught them to remove it higher into a more fabulous Age, and by the same remove lighting on the Trojan Tales in affectation to make the Britan of one Original with the Roman, pitch'd there; yet those old and inborn names of successive Kings, never any to have bin real persons, or done in thir lives at least som part of what so long hath bin remember'd, cannot be thought without too strict an incredulity.\n\nFor these, and those causes above mention'd, that which hath receav'd approbation from so many, I have chos'n not to omitt. Certain or uncertain, be that upon the credit of those whom I must follow; so far as keeps alooff from impossible and absurd, attested by ancient Writers from Books more ancient I refuse not, as the due and proper subject of Story. The principal Author is well know'n to be Geoffrey of Monmouth; what he was, and whence his authority, who in his Age, or before him, have deliver'd the same matter, and such like general discourses, will better stand in a Treatise by themselvs. All of them agree in this, that Brutus was the Son of Silvius; he of Ascanius; whose Father was Ãneas a Trojan Prince, who at the burning of that City, with his Son Ascanius, and a collected number that escap'd, after long wandring on the Sea, arriv'd in Italy. Where at length by the assistance of Latinus King of Latium, who had giv'n him his Daughter Lavinia, he obtain'd to succeed in that Kingdom, and left it to Ascanius, whose Son Silvius (though Roman Histories deny Silvius to be Son of Ascanius) had maried secretly a Neece of Lavinia.\n\nShe being with Child, the matter became known to Ascanius. Who commanding his Magicians to enquire by Art, what sex the Maid had conceiv'd, had answer, that it was one who should be the death of both his Parents; and banish'd for the fact, should after all in a farr Country, attain to highest honour. The prediction fail'd not, for in travel the Mother di'd. And Brutus (the Child was so call'd) at fifteen years of Age, attending his Father to the Chace, with an arrow unfortunately kill'd him.\n\nBanish'd therfore by his kindred, he retires into Greece. Where meeting with the race of Helenus King Priams Son, held there in servile condition by Pandrasus then King, with them he abides. For Pirrhus in revenge of his Father slain at Troy, had brought thither with him Helenus, and many others into servitude. There Brutus among his own stock so thrives in vertue and in Arms, as renders him belov'd to Kings, and great Captains above all the Youth of that Land. Wherby the Trojans not only beginn to hope, but secretly to move him, that he would lead them the way to liberty. They allege their numbers, and the promis'd help of Assaracus a Noble Greekish Youth, by the Mothers side a Trojan; whom for that cause his Brother went about to dispossess of certain Castles bequeath'd him by his Father. Brutus considering both the Forces offer'd him, and the strength of those Holds, not unwillingly consents.\n\nFirst therfore having fortifi'd those Castles, he with Assaracus and the whole multitude betake them to the Woods and Hills; as the safest place from whence to expostulate; and in the name of all sends to Pandrasus this Message; That the Trojans holding it unworthy thir Ancestors to serv in a Foren Kingdom had retreated to the Woods; choosing rather a Savage life then a slavish; If that displeas'd him, that then with his leave they might depart to some other soil.\n\nAs this may pass with good allowance, that the Trojans might be many in these parts, for Helenus was by Pirrhus made King of the Chaonians, and the Sons of Pirrhus by Andromache Hectors Wife could not but be powerful through all Epirus, so much the more it may be doubted, how these Trojans could be thus in bondage, where they had Freinds and Country-men so Potent. But to examin these things with diligence, were but to confute the Fables of Britan, with the Fables of Greece or Italy; for of this Age, what we have to say, as well concerning most other Countries, as this Iland, is equally under Question. Be how it will, Pandrasus not expecting so bold a message from the Sons of Captives, gathers an Army. And marching toward the Woods, Brutus who had notice of his approach nigh to a Town call'd Sparatinum, (I know not what Towne, but certaine of no Greek name) over night planting himself there with good part of his men, suddenly sets upon him, and with slaughter of the Greeks pursues him to the passage of a River, which mine Author names Akalon, meaning perhaps Achelous, or Acheron; where at the Ford he overlaies them afresh. This victory obtain'd, and a sufficient strength left in Sparatinum, Brutus with Antigonus, the Kings Brother, and his Freind Anacletus, whom he had tak'n in the fight, returns to the residue of his freinds in the thick Woods. While Pandrasus with all speed recollecting, besieges the Town. Brutus to releive his men beseig'd, who earnestly call'd him, distrusting the sufficiency of his force, bethinks himself of this Policy. Calls to him Anacletus, and threatning instant death else, both to him and his freind Antigonus, enjoyns him, that he should goe at the second howr of night to the Greekish Leagre, and tell the Guards he had brought Antigonus by stealth out of Prison to a certain woody Vale; unable through the waight of his Fetters to move furder; entreating them to come speedily and fetch him in. Anacletus to save both himself and his freind Antigonus, swears this; and at fit howr setts on alone toward the Camp; is mett, examin'd, and at last unquestionably known. To whom, great profession of fidelity first made, he frames his Tale, as had bin taught him: and they now fully assur'd, with a credulous rashness leaving thir Stations, far'd accordingly by the ambush that there awaited them. Forthwith Brutus dividing his men into three parts, leads on in silence to the Camp; commanding first each part at a several place to enter, and forbear Execution, till he with his Squadron possess'd of the Kings Tent, gave Signal to them by Trumpet. The sound whereof no sooner heard, but huge havock begins upon the sleeping, and unguarded Enemy; whom the besieged also now sallying forth, on the other side assaile. Brutus the while had special care to seise and secure the Kings Person; whose life still within his Custody, he knew was the surest pledge to obtain what he should demand. Day appearing, he enters the Town, there distributes the Kings Treasury, and leaving the place better fortify'd, returns with the King his Prisner to the Woods. Strait the antient and grave men he summons to Counsell, what they should now demand of the King.\n\nAfter long debate Mempricius, one of the gravest, utterly dissuading them from thought of longer stay in Greece, unlesse they meant to be deluded with a suttle peace, and the awaited revenge of those whose freinds they had slain, advises them to demand first the Kings Eldest Daughter Innogen in mariage to thir Leader Brutus with a rich dowry, next shipping, mony, and fitt provision for them all to depart the Land.\n\nThis resolution pleasing best, the King now brought in, and plac'd in a high Seat, is breifly told, that on these conditions granted, he might be free, not granted, he must prepare to die.\n\nPrest with fear of death, the King readily yeelds: especially to bestow his Daughter on whom he confess'd so Noble and so Valiant: offers them also the third part of his Kingdom, if they like to stay; if not, to be thir Hostage himself, till he had made good his word.\n\nThe Mariage therfore solemniz'd, and shipping from all parts got together, the Trojans in a Fleet, no less writt'n then three hundred fowr and twenty Sail, betake them to the wide Sea; where with a prosperous course two daies and a night bring them on a certain Iland long before dispeopl'd and left wast by Sea-Roavers; the name wherof was then Leogecia, now unknow'n. They who were sent out to discover, came at length to a ruin'd City; where was a Temple and Image of Diana that gave Oracles: but not meeting first or last, save wild Beasts, they return with this notice to thir Ships: Wishing thir General would enquire of that Oracle what voiage to pursue.\n\nConsultation had, Brutus taking with him Gerion his Diviner, and twelv of the ancientest, with wonted Ceremonies before the inward shrine of the Goddess, in Verse, as it seems the manner was, utters his request, Diva potens nemorum, &c.\n\nGoddess of Shades, and Huntress, who at will\n\nWalk'st on the rowling Sphear, and through the deep,\n\nOn thy third Reigne the Earth look now, and tell\n\nWhat Land, what Seat of rest thou bidst me seek,\n\nWhat certain Seat, where I may worship thee\n\nFor aye, with Temples vow'd, and Virgin quires.\n\nTo whom sleeping before the Altar, Diana in a Vision that night thus answer'd, Brute sub occasum Solis, &c.\n\nBrutus far to the West, in th' Ocean wide,\n\nBeyond the Realm of Gaul, a Land there lies,\n\nSea-girt it lies, where Giants dwelt of old,\n\nNow void, it fitts thy people; thether bend\n\nThy course, there shalt thou find a lasting seat,\n\nThere to thy Sons another Troy shall rise,\n\nAnd Kings be born of thee, whose dredded might\n\nShall aw the World, and Conquer Nations bold.\n\nThese Verses Originally Greek, were put in Latin, saith Virunnius, by Gildas a British Poet, and him to have liv'd under Claudius. Which granted true, adds much to the Antiquitie of this Fable; and indeed the Latin Verses are much better, then for the Age of Geoffrey ap-Arthur, unless perhaps Joseph of Exeter, the only smooth Poet of those times, befreinded him. In this, Diana overshot her Oracle thus ending, Ipsis totius terrÃ¦ subditus orbis erit, That to the race of Brute Kings of this Iland, the whole Earth shall be subject.\n\nBut Brutus guided now, as he thought, by divine conduct, speeds him towards the West; and after som encounters on the Afric side, arrives at a place on the Tyrrhen Sea; where he happ'ns to find the Race of those Trojans who with Antenor came into Italy; and Corineus a man much fam'd, was thir Cheif: though by surer Authors it be reported, that those Trojans with Antenor, were seated on the other side of Italie, on the Adriatic, not the Tyrrhen shoar. But these joyning Company, and past the Herculean Pillars, at the mouth of Ligeris in Aquitania cast Anchor, Where after som discovery made of the place, Corineus Hunting nigh the shoar with his Men, is by Messengers of the King Goffarius Pictus mett, and question'd about his Errand there. Who not answering to thir mind, Imbertus, one of them, lets fly an Arrow at Corineus, which he avoiding, slaies him: and the Pictavian himself heerupon levying his whole Force, is overthrown by Brutus, and Corineus; who with the Battell Ax which he was wont to manage against the Tyrrhen Giants, is said to have done marvells. But Goffarius having draw'n to his aid the whole Country of Gaul, at that time govern'd by twelv Kings, puts his Fortune to a second Trial, Wherin the Trojans over-born by multitude, are driv'n back, and beseigd in thir own Camp, which by good foresight was strongly situate. Whence Brutus unexpectedly issuing out, and Corineus in the mean while, whose device it was, assaulting them behind from a Wood, where he had convayd his men the night before: The Trojans are again Victors, but with the loss of Turon a valiant Nefew of Brutus; whose Ashes left in that place, gave name to the City of Tours, built there by the Trojans. Brutus finding now his powers much lessn'd, and this yet not the place foretold him, leavs Aquitain, and with an easie course, arriving at Totness in Dev'nshire, quickly perceivs heer to be the promis'd end of his labours.\n\nThe Iland not yet Britain but Albion, was in a manner desert and inhospitable; kept only by a remnant of Giants; whose excessive Force and Tyranie had consum'd the rest. Them Brutus destroies, and to his people divides the Land, which with som reference to his own name he thenceforth calls Britain. To Corineus, Cornwal, as now we call it, fell by Lot; the rather by him lik't, for that the hugest Giants in Rocks and Caves were said to lurk still there; which kind of Monsters to deal with was his old exercise.\n\nAnd heer, with leave bespoken to recite a grand Fable, though dignify'd by our best Poets; while Brutus on a certain Festival day solemnly kept on that shoar, where he first landed, was with the people in great jollity and mirth, a crew of these Savages breaking in upon them, began on the suddain another sort of Game then at such a meeting was expected. But at length by many hands overcome, GoÃ«magog the hugest, in higth twelv Cubits, is reserv'd alive; that with him Corineus, who desir'd nothing more, might try his strength; Whom in a Wrestle the Giant catching aloft, with a terrible hugg broke three of his Ribs: nevertheless Corineus enrag'd, heaving him up by main force, and on his Shoulders bearing him to the next high Rock, threw him headlong all shatter'd, into the Sea, and left his name on the Cliff, call'd ever since LangoÃ«magog, which is to say, the Giants Leap.\n\nAfter this, Brutus in a chosen place builds Troia nova, chang'd in time to Trinovantum, now London: and began to enact Laws; Heli being then high Preist in JudÃ¦a: and having govern'd the whole Ile 24 Years, dy'd, and was buried in his new Troy. His three Sons, Locrine, Albanact, and Camber divide the Land by consent. Locrine had the middle part LoÃ«gria; Camber possess'd Cambria, or Wales; Albanact, Albania, now Scotland. But he in the end by Humber King of the Hunns, who with a Fleet invaded that Land, was slain in fight, and his people driv'n back into LoÃ«gria. Locrine and his Brother go out against Humber; who now marching onward, was by them defeated, and in a River drown'd, which to this day retains his name. Among the spoils of his Camp and Navy, were found certain young Maids, and Estrildis, above the rest, passing fair; the Daughter of a King in Germany; from whence Humber, as he went wasting the Sea-Coast, had led her Captive: whom Locrine, though before contracted to the Daughter of Corineus, resolvs to marry. But beeing forc'd and threaten'd by Corineus, whose Autority, and power he fear'd, Guendolen the Daughter he yeelds to marry, but in secret loves the other: and oft-times retiring, as to som privat Sacrifice, through Vaults and passages made under ground, and seven years thus enjoying her, had by her a Daughter equally fair, whose name was Sabra. But when once his fear was off by the Death of Corineus, not content with secret enjoyment, divorcing Guendolen, he makes Estrildis now his Queen. Guendolen all in rage departs into Cornwall; where Madan, the Son she had by Locrine, was hitherto brought up by Corineus his Grandfather. And gathering an Army of her Fathers Freinds and Subjects, gives Battail to her Husband by the River Sture; wherin Locrine shot with an Arrow ends his life. But not so ends the fury of Guendolen; for Estrildis and her Daughter Sabra, she throws into a River: and to leave a Monument of revenge, proclaims, that the stream be thenceforth call'd after the Damsels name; which by length of time is chang'd now to Sabrina, or Severn.\n\nFifteen Years she governs in behalf of her Son; then resigning to him at Age, retires to her Fathers Dominion. This, saith my Author, was in the daies of Samuel. Madan hath the praise to have well and peacefully rul'd the space of 40 years; leaving behind him two Sons, Mempricius, and Malim. Mempricius had first to doe with the ambition of his Brother, aspiring to share with him in the Kingdom; whom therfore at a meeting to compose matters, with a treachery which his cause needed not, he slew.\n\nNor was he better in the sole possession, wherof so ill he could endure a Partner, killing his Nobles, and those especially next to succeed him; till lastly giv'n over to unnaturall lust, in the twentith of his Reigne, hunting in a Forest, he was devowr'd by Wolves.\n\nHis Son Ebranc, a Man of mighty strength and stature, Reign'd 40 Years. He first after Brutus wasted Gaul; and returning rich and prosperous, builded Caerebranc, now York; in Albania Alclud, Mount Agned, or the Castle of Maydens, now Edinburgh. He had 20 Sons and 30 Daughters by 20 Wives. His Daughters he sent to Silvius Alba into Italy, who bestow'd them on his Peers of the Trojan Line. His Sons under the leading of Assaracus thir Brother, won them Lands and Signories in Germany; thence call'd from these Brethren Germania: a derivation too hastily suppos'd, perhaps before the word Germanus, or the Latin Tongue was in use. Som who have describ'd Henault, as Jacobus Bergomas, and Lessabeus, are cited to affirm that Ebranc in his Warre there, was by Brunchildis Lord of Henault put to the worse.\n\nBrutus therfore, surnamed Greenshield succeeding, to repair his Fathers losses, as the same Lessabeus reports, fought a second Battail in Henault, with Brunchild at the mouth of Scaldis, and Encamp'd on the River Hania. Of which our Spencer also thus Sings.\n\nLet Scaldis tell, and let tell Hania,\n\nAnd let the Marsh of Esthambruges tell\n\nWhat colour were thir Waters that same day,\n\nAnd all the Moar twixt Elversham and Dell,\n\nWith Blood of Henalois which therin fell;\n\nHow oft that day did sad Brunchildis see\n\nThe Greenshield dy'd in dolorous Vermeil, &c.\n\nBut Henault, and Brunchild, and Greenshield, seeme newer names then for a Story pretended thus Antient.\n\nHim succeeded Leil, a maintainer of Peace and Equity; but slackn'd in his latter end, whence arose som civil discord. He built in the North Cairleil; and in the daies of Solomon.\n\nRudhuddibras, or Hudibras appeasing the commotions which his Father could not, fownded Caerkeynt or Canturbury, Caerguent, or Winchester, and Mount Paladur, now Septonia or Shaftesbury: but this by others is contradicted.\n\nBladud his Son built Caerbadus or Bathe, and those medicinable Waters he dedicated to Minerva; in whose Temple there he kept fire continually burning. He was a man of great invention, and taught Necromancie: till having made him Wings to fly, he fell down upon the Temple of Apollo in Trinovant, and so dy'd after twenty years Reigne.\n\nHitherto from Father to Son the direct Line hath run on: but Leir who next Reign'd, had only three Daughters, and no Male Issue; govern'd laudably, and built Caer-Leir, now Leicestre, on the Bank of Sora. But at last, failing through Age, he determines to bestow his Daughters, and so among them to divide his Kingdom. Yet first to try which of them lov'd him best (a Trial that might have made him, had he known as wisely how to try, as he seem'd to know how much the trying behoov'd him) he resolves a simple resolution, to ask them solemly in order; and which of them should profess largest, her to beleev. Gonorill th' Eldest, apprehending too well her Fathers weakness, makes answer, invoking Heav'n, That she lov'd him above her Soul. Therfore, quoth the old man overjoy'd, since thou so honourst my declin'd Age, to thee and the Husband whom thou shall choose, I give the third part of my Realm. So fair a speeding for a few words soon utter'd, was to Regan the second, ample instruction what to say. She on the same demand spares no protesting, and the Gods must witness, that otherwise to express her thoughts she knew not, but that she lov'd him above all Creatures; and so receavs an equal reward with her Sister. But Cordelia the youngest, though hitherto best belov'd, and now before her Eyes the rich and present hire of a little easie soothing, the danger also, and the loss likely to betide plain dealing, yet moves not from the solid purpose of a sincere and vertuous answer. Father, saith she, my love towards you is as my duty bids; what should a Father seek, what can a Child promise more? they who pretend beyond this, flatter. When the old man, sorry to hear this, and wishing her to recall those words, persisted asking, with a loiall sadness at her Fathers infirmity, but somthing on the sudden, harsh, and glancing rather at her Sisters, then speaking her own mind, Two waies only, saith she, I have to answer what you require mee; the former, Your command is, I should recant; accept then this other which is left mee; look how much you have, so much is your value, and so much I love you. Then hear thou, quoth Leir now all in passion, what thy ingratitude hath gain'd thee; because thou hast not reverenc'd thy aged Father equall to thy Sisters, part in my Kingdom, or what else is mine, reck'n to have none. And without delay gives in marriage his other Daughters, Gonorill to Maglaunus Duke of Albania, Regan to Henninus Duke of Cornwall; with them in present half his Kingdom; the rest to follow at his Death. In the mean while Fame was not sparing to divulge the wisdom and other Graces of Cordeilla, insomuch that Aganippus a great King in Gaul (however he came by his Greek name) seeks her to Wife, and nothing alter'd at the loss of her Dowry, receavs her gladly in such manner as she was sent him. After this King Leir more and more drooping with Years, became an easy prey to his Daughters and thir Husbands; who now by dayly encroachment had seis'd the whole Kingdom into thir hands: and the old King is put to sojorn with his Eldest Daughter, attended only by threescore Knights. But they in a short while grudg'd at, as too numerous and disorderly for continuall Guests, are reduc'd to thirty. Not brooking that affront, the old King betakes him to his second Daughter: but there also discord soon arising between the Servants of differing Masters in one Family, five only are suffer'd to attend him. Then back again he returns to the other; hoping that she his Eldest could not but have more pity on his Gray Hairs: but she now refuses to admitt him, unless he be content with one only of his followers. At last the remembrance of his youngest Cordeilla comes to his thoughts; and now acknowledging how true her words had bin, though with little hope from whom he had so injur'd, be it but to pay her the last recompence she can have from him, his confession of her wise forewarning, that so perhaps his misery, the prooff and experiment of her Wisdom, might somthing soft'n her, he takes his Journey into France. Now might be seen a difference between the silent, or down-right spok'n affection of som Children to thir Parents, and the talkative obsequiousness of others; while the hope of Inheritance over-acts them, and on the Tongues end enlarges thir duty. Cordeilla out of meer love, without the suspicion of expected reward, at the message only of her Father in distress, powrs forth true filial tears. And not enduring either that her own, or any other Eye should see him in such forlorn condition as his Messenger declar'd, discreetly appoints one of her trusted Servants, first to convay him privately toward som good Sea Town, there to array him, bathe him, cherish him, furnish him with such Attendance and State, as beseemd his Dignity. That then, as from his first Landing, he might send word of his Arrival to her Husband Aganippus. Which don with all mature, and requisite contrivance, Cordelia with the King her Husband, and all the Barony of his Realm, who then first had news of his passing the Sea, goe out to meet him; and after all honourable and joyfull entertainment, Aganippus, as to his Wives Father, and his Royall Guest, surrenders him, during his abode there, the power, and disposal of his whole Dominion: permitting his Wife Cordeilla to go with an Army, and set her Father upon his Throne. Wherin her piety so prosper'd, as that she vanquish'd her impious Sisters with those Dukes, and Leir again, as saith the story, three years obtain'd the Crown. To whom dying, Cordeilla with all regal Solemnities gave burial in the Town of Leicestre. And then as right Heir succeeding, and her Husband dead, rul'd the Land five years in peace. Until Marganus and Cunedagius her two Sisters Sons, not bearing that a Kingdom should be govern'd by a Woman, in the unseasonablest time to raise that quarrel against a Woman so worthy, make war against her, depose her, and imprison her; of which impatient, and now long unexercis'd to suffer, she there, as is related, killd her self. The Victors between them part the Land: but Marganus the Eldest Sisters Son, who held by agreement from the North-side of Humber to Cathness, incited by those about him, to invade all as his own right, warres on Cunedagius, who soon met him, overcame, and overtook him in a Town of Wales, where he left his life, and ever since his name to the place.\n\nCunedagius was now sole King, and govern'd with much praise many years; about the time when Rome was built.\n\nHim succeeded Rivallo his Son, wise also and fortunat; save what they tell us of three daies raining blood, and swarmes of stinging Flies, whereof men dy'd. In order then Gurgustius, Jago or Lago, his Nefew; Sisilius, Kinmarcus. Then Gorbogudo, whom others name Gorbodego, and Gorbodion, who had two Sons, Ferrex and Porrex. They in the old Age of thir Father falling to contend who should succeed, Porrex attempting by treachery his Brothers life, drives him into France; and in his return, though aided with the force of that Country, defeats and slaies him. But by his Mother Videna who less lov'd him, is himself, with the assistance of her Women, soon after slain in his Bed: With whom ended, as is thought, the Line of Brutus. Whereupon, the whole Land with civil broils was rent into five Kingdoms, long time waging Warr each on other; and som say 50 Years. At length Dunwallo Molmutius the Son of Cloten King of Cornwall, one of the foresaid five, excelling in valour, and goodliness of person, after his Fathers decease, found means to reduce again the whole Iland into a Monarchy; subduing the rest at opportunities. First, Ymner King of Loegria, whom he slew; then Rudaucus of Cambria, Staterius of Albania, confederat together. In which fight Dunwallo is reported, while the Victory hung doubtfull, to have us'd this Art. He takes with him 600 Stout men, bids them put on the Armour of thir slain Enemies; and so unexpectedly approaching the Squadron, where those two Kings had plac'd themselvs in fight, from that part which they thought securest, assaults, and dispatches them. Then displaying his own Ensignes which before he had conceal'd, and sending notice to the other part of his Army what was don, adds to them new courage, and gains a final Victory. This Dunwallo was the first in Britain that wore a Crown of Gold; and therfore by som reputed the first King. He established the Molmutine Laws, famous among the English to this day; written long after in Latine by Gildas, and in Saxon by King Alfred: so saith Geofrey, but Gildas denies to have known aught of the Britans before CÃ¦sar; much less knew Alfred. These Laws, whoever made them, bestow'd on Temples the privilege of Sanctuary; to Cities also, and the waies thether leading, yea to Plows granted a kind of like refuge; and made such riddance of Theeves and Robbers, that all Passages were safe. Forty Years he Govern'd alone, and was buried nigh to the Temple of Concord; which he, to the memory of peace restor'd, had built in Trinovant.\n\nHis two Sons, Belinus and Brennus, contending about the Crown, by decision of Freinds, came at length to an accord; Brennus to have the North of Humber, Belinus the Sovrantie of all. But the younger not long so contented, that he, as they whisper'd to him, whose valour had so oft repell'd the invasions of Ceulphus the Morine Duke, should now be subject to his Brother, upon new Designe sails into Norway; enters League and Affinitie with Elsing that King; which Belinus perceaving, in his absence dispossesses him of all the North. Brennus with a Fleet of Norwegians, makes towards Britain; but encounter'd by Guithlac the Danish King, who laying claim to his Bride, pursu'd him on the Sea, his hast was retarded, and he bereft of his Spouse: who from the fight by a sudden Tempest, was with the Danish King driv'n on Northumberland, and brought to Belinus. Brennus nevertheless recollecting his Navy, lands in Albania, and gives Battell to his Brother in the Wood Calaterium; but loosing the day, escapes with one single Ship into Gaul. Mean while the Dane upon his own offer to become tributary, sent home with his new prise, Belinus returns his thoughts to the administring of Justice, and the perfeting of his Fathers Laws; and to explain what High-waies might enjoy the foresaid privileges, he caus'd to be drawn out and pav'd fowr main Roades to the utmost length and bredth of the Iland, and two others athwart; which are since attributed to the Romans. Brennus on the other side solliciting to his aid the Kings of Gaul, happ'ns at last on Seginus Duke of the Allobruges; where his worth, and comliness of person, wan him the Dukes Daughter and Heir. In whose right he shortly succeeding, and by obtain'd leave passing with a great Host through the length of Gaul, gets footing once again in Britain. Nor was Belinus unprepar'd, and now the Battell ready to joyn, Conuvenna the Mother of them both all in a fright, throws her self between; and calling earnestly to Brennus her Son, whose absence had so long depriv'd her of his sight, after imbracements and teares, assails him with such a motherly power, and the mention of things so dear and reverend, as irresistibly wrung from him all his enmity against Belinus.\n\nThen hands are joyn'd, reconciliation made firm, and Counsel held to turn thir united preparations on Foren parts. Thence that by these two all Gallia was overrun, the story tells; and what they did in Italy, and at Rome, if these be they, and not Gauls, who took that City, the Roman Authors can best relate. So far from home I undertake not for the Monmouth Chronicle; which heer against the stream of History carries up and down these Brethren, now into Germany, then again to Rome, pursuing Gabius and Porsena, two unheard of Consuls. Thus much is more generally beleev'd, that both this Brennus, and another Captain, Britomarus, whom the Epitomist Florus and others mention, were not Gauls but Britans; the name of the first in that Tongue signifying a King, and of the other a Great Britan. However Belinus after a while returning home, the rest of his daies rul'd in Peace, Wealth, and Honour above all his Predecessors; building som Cities, of which one was Caerose upon Osca, since Caerlegion; beautifying others, as Trinovant, with a Gate, a Hav'n, and a Towr, on the Thames, retaining yet his name; on the top wherof his Ashes are said to have bin laid up in a Golden Urne.\n\nAfter him Gurguntius Barbirus was King, mild and just, but yet inheriting his Fathers Courage; he subdu'd the Dacian, or Dane, who refus'd to pay the Tribute Covnanted to Belinus for his enlargement. In his return finding about the Orkneies 30 Ships of Spain, or Biscay, fraught with Men and Women for a Plantation, whose Captain also Bartholinus wrongfully banish't, as he pleaded, besaught him that som part of his Territory might be assign'd them to dwell in, he sent with them certain of his own men to Ireland, which then lay unpeopl'd; and gave them that Iland to hold of him as in Homage. He was buried in Caerlegion, a City which he had wall'd about.\n\nGuitheline his Son, is also remember'd as a just and good Prince, and his Wife Martia to have excell'd so much in wisdom, as to venture upon a new Institution of Laws. Which King Alfred translating, call'd Marchen Leage; but more truly therby is meant, the Mercian Law; not translated by Alfred, but digested or incorporated with the West-Saxon. In the minority of her Son she had the rule, and then, as may be suppos'd, brought forth these Laws, not her self, for Laws are Masculin Births, but by the advice of her sagest Counselors; and therin she might doe vertuously, since it befell her to supply the nonage of her Son: else nothing more awry from the Law of God and Nature, then that a Woman should give Laws to Men.\n\nHir Son Sisilius coming to Yeares, receav'd the Rule; then in order Kimarus, then Danius or Elanius his Brother. Then Morindus, his Son by Tanguestela a Concubine, who is recorded a man of excessive Strength, Valiant, Liberal, and fair of Aspect, but immanely Cruell; not sparing in his Anger, Enemy, or Freind, if any Weapon were in his hand. A certain King of the Morines, or Picards, invaded Northumberland; whose Army this King, though not wanting sufficient numbers, cheifly by his own prowess overcame: But dishonour'd his Victory by the cruel usage of his Prisners, whom his own hands, or others in his presence put all to several Deaths: well fitted to such a bestiall Cruelty was his end; for hearing of a huge Monster that from the Irish Sea infested the Coast, and in the Pride of his Strength foolishly attempting to set manly valour against a Brute vastness, when his Weapons were all in vain, by that horrible mouth he was catch't up and devour'd.\n\nGorbonian the Eldest of his five Sons, then whom a Juster man liv'd not in his Age, was a great builder of Temples, and gave to all what was thir due; to his Gods devout Worship, to men of desert honour and preferment, to the Commons encouragement in thir Labours, and Trades, defence and protection from injuries and oppressions; so that the Land florish'd above her Neighbours, Violence and Wrong seldom was heard of: his Death was a general loss: he was buried in Trinovant.\n\nArchigallo the second Brother follow'd not his Example; but depress'd the ancient Nobility; and by peeling the wealthier sort, stuff'd his Treasury, and took the right way to be depos'd.\n\nElidure the next Brother, surnam'd the Pious, was set up in his place; a mind so noble, and so moderat, as almost is incredible to have bin ever found. For having held the Scepter five Years, hunting one day in the Forest of Calater, he chanc'd to meet his deposed Brother, wandring in mean condition; who had bin long in vain beyond the Seas, importuning Foren aides to his Restorement: and was now in a poor Habit, with only ten followers, privatly return'd to find subsistence among his secret freinds. At the unexpected sight of him, Elidure himself also then but thinly accompanied, runns to him with open Arms; and after many dear and sincere welcomings, convaies him to the City Alclud; there hides him in his own Bed-Chamber. Afterwards faining himself sick, summons all his Peers as about greatest affairs; where admitting them one by one, as if his weakness endur'd not the disturbance of more at once, causes them willing or unwilling, once more to swear Allegiance to Archigallo. Whom after reconciliation made on all sides, he leads to York; and from his own Head, places the Crown on the Head of his Brother. Who thenceforth, Vice itself dissolving in him, and forgetting her firmest hold with the admiration of a deed so Heroic, became a true converted man; rul'd worthily 10 Years; dy'd, and was Buried in Caerleir. Thus was a Brother sav'd by a Brother, to whom love of a Crown, the thing that so often dazles, and vitiats mortal men, for which, thousands of neerest blood have destroy'd each other, was in respect of Brotherly dearness, a contemptible thing.\n\nElidure now in his own behalf re-assumes the Government, and did as was worthy such a man to doe. When providence, that so great vertue might want no sort of trial to make it more illustrious, stirs up Vigenius, and Peredure his youngest Brethren, against him who had deserv'd so nobly of that relation, as lest of all by a Brother to be injur'd. Yet him they defeat, him they Imprison in the Towr of Trinovant, and divide his Kingdom; the North to Peredure, the South to Vigenius. After whose Death Peredure obtaining all, so much the better us'd his power, by how much the worse he got it: so that Elidure now is hardly miss't. But yet in all right owing to his Elder the due place wherof he had depriv'd him, Fate would that he should die first: and Elidure after many years Imprisonment, is now the third time seated on the Throne; which at last he enjoy'd long in Peace; finishing the interrupted course of his mild and just Reign, as full of vertuous deeds, as daies to his end.\n\nAfter these five Sons of Morindus, succeeded also thir Sons in order. *Regin of Gorbonian, Marganus of Archigallo, both good Kings. But Enniaunus his Brother taking other courses, was after six years depos'd. Then Idwallo taught by a neer Example, Govern'd soberly. Then Runno, then Geruntius, He of Peredure, this last the Son of Elidure. From whose Loyns (for that likely is the durable, and surviving Race that springs of just Progenitors) issu'd a long descent of Kings, whose names only for many successions, without other memory, stand thus registr'd, Catellus, Coillus, Porrex, Cherin, and his three Sons, Fulgenius, Eldadus, and Andragius, his Son Urianus; Eliud, Eledaucus, Clotenus, Gurguntius, Merianus, Bleduno, Capis, OÃ«nus, Sisillius, twentie Kings in a continu'd row, that either did nothing, or liv'd in Ages that wrote nothing, at least a foul pretermission in the Author of this, whether Story or Fable; himself wearie, as seems, of his own tedious Tale.\n\nBut to make amends for this Silence, Blegabredus next succeeding, is recorded to have excell'd all before him in the Art of Music; opportunely, had he but left us one Song of his 20 Predecessors doings.\n\nYet after him nine more succeeded in name; His Brother Archimailus, Eldol, Redion, Rederchius, Samulius, Penissel, Pir, Capoirus; but Cliguellius, with the addition of Modest, Wise and Just.\n\nHis Son Heli Reign'd 40 Years, and had three Sons, Lud, Cassibelaun, and Nennius. This Heli seems to be the same whom Ninnius in his Fragment calls Minocan; for him he writes to be the Father of Cassibelan. Lud was he who enlarg'd, and wall'd about Trinovant, there kept his Court, made it the prime City, and call'd it from his own name Caer-Lud, or Luds Town, now London. Which, as is alledg'd out of Gildas, became matter of great dissention betwixt him, and his Brother Nennius; who took it hainously that the name of Troy thir ancient Country should be abolish'd for any new one. Lud was hardy, and bold in Warr, in Peace a jolly Feaster. He conquer'd many Ilands of the Sea, saith Huntingdon, and was buried by the Gate which from thence wee call Ludgate. His two Sons, Androgeus, and Tenuantius, were left to the tuition of Cassibelan; whose bounty, and high demeanor so wraught with the common people, as got him easily the Kingdom transferr'd upon himself. He nevertheless continuing to favour and support his Nefews, conferrs freely upon Androgeus, London with Kent, upon Tenuantius, Cornwall: reserving a superiority both over them, and all the other Princes to himself; till the Romans for a while circumscrib'd his power. Thus farr, though leaning only on the credit of Geffrey Monmouth, and his assertors, I yet for the specify'd causes have thought it not beneath my purpose, to relate what I found. Wherto I neither oblige the beleif of other person, nor over-hastily subscribe mine own. Nor have I stood with others computing, or collating years and Chronologies, lest I should be vainly curious about the time and circumstance of things wherof the substance is so much in doubt. By this time, like one who had set out on his way by night, and travail'd through a Region of smooth or idle Dreams, our History now arrivs on the Confines, where day-light and truth meet us with a cleer dawn, representing to our view, though at a farr distance, true colours and shapes. For albeit, CÃ¦sar, whose Autority we are now first to follow, wanted not who tax'd him of mis-reporting in his Commentaries, yea in his Civil Warrs against Pompey, much more, may wee think, in the British affairs, of whose little skill in writing he did not easily hope to be contradicted, yet now in such variety of good Authors, we hardly can miss, from one hand or other, to be sufficiently inform'd as of things past so long agoe. But this will better be referr'd to a second discourse.\n\nThe End of the first Book.\n\nThe Second Book.\n\nI Am now to write of what befell the Britans from fifty and three years before the Birth of our Saviour, when first the Romans came in, till the decay and ceasing of that Empire; a story of much truth, and for the first hunderd years and somwhat more, collected without much labour. So many and so prudent were the Writers, which those two, the civilest and the wisest of European Nations, both Italy and Greece, afforded to the actions of that Puissant Citty. For worthy deeds are not often destitute of worthy relaters: as by a certain Fate great Acts and great Eloquence have most commonly gon hand in hand, equalling and honouring each other in the same Ages. 'Tis true, that in obscurest times, by shallow and unskilfull Writers, the indistinct noise of many Battels, and devastations, of many Kingdoms over-run and lost, hath come to our Eares. For what wonder, if in all Ages, Ambition and the love of rapine hath stirr'd up greedy and violent men to bold attempts in wasting and ruining Warrs, which to posterity have left the work of Wild Beasts and Destroyers, rather then the Deeds and Monuments of men and Conquerours. But he whose just and true valour uses the necessity of Warr and Dominion not to destroy, but to prevent destruction, to bring in liberty against Tyrants, Law and Civility among barbarous Nations, knowing that when he Conquers all things else, he cannot Conquer Time or Detraction, wisely conscious of this his want as well as of his worth not to be forgott'n or conceal'd, honours and hath recourse to the aid of Eloquence, his freindliest and best supply; by whose immortal Record his noble deeds, which else were transitory, becoming fixt and durable againt the force of Yeares and Generations, he fails not to continue through all Posterity, over Envy, Death, and Time, also victorious. Therfore when the esteem of Science, and liberal study waxes low in the Common-wealth, wee may presume that also there all civil Vertue, and worthy action is grown as low to a decline: and then Eloquence, as it were consorted in the same destiny, with the decrease and fall of vertue, corrupts also and fades; at least resignes her office of relating to illiterat and frivolous Historians; such as the persons themselvs both deserv, and are best pleas'd with; whilst they want either the understanding to choose better, or the innocence to dare invite the examining, and searching stile of an intelligent and faithfull Writer to the survay of thir unsound exploits, better befreinded by obscurity then Fame. As for these, the only Authors wee have of Brittish matters, while the power of Rome reach'd hither, (for Gildas affirms that of the Roman times noe Brittish Writer was in his daies extant, or if any ever were, either burnt by Enemies, or transported with such as fled the Pictish and Saxon invasions) these therfore only Roman Authors there bee, who in the English Tongue have laid together, as much, and perhaps more then was requisite to a History of Britain. So that were it not for leaving an unsightly gap so neer to the beginning, I should have judg'd this labour, wherin so little seems to be requir'd above transcription, almost superfluous. Notwithstanding since I must through it, if ought by diligence may bee added or omitted, or by other disposing may be more explain'd, or more express'd, I shall assay.\n\nJulius CÃ¦sar (of whom, and of the Roman Free State, more then what appertains, is not here to be discours'd) having subdu'd most part of Gallia, which by a potent faction, he had obtain'd of the Senat as his Province for many years, stirr'd up with a desire of adding still more glory to his name, and the whole Roman Empire to his ambition; som say, with a farr meaner and ignobler, the Desire of Brittish Pearls, whose bigness he delighted to ballance in his hand, determins, and that upon no unjust pretended occasion, to trie his Force in the Conquest also of Britain. For he understood that the Britans in most of his Gallian Warrs had sent supplies against him, had receiv'd fugitives of the Bellovaci his Enemies; and were call'd over to aid the Citties of Armorica, which had the year before conspir'd all in a new Rebellion. Therfore CÃ¦sar, though now the Summer well nigh ending, and the season unagreeable to transport a Warr, yet judg'd it would be great advantage, only to get entrance into the Ile, knowledge of the men, the places, the ports, the accesses; which then, it seems, were eev'n to the Gauls thir Neighbours almost unknown. For except Merchants and Traders, it is not oft, saith he, that any use to Travel thether; and to those that doe, besides the Sea Coast, and the Ports next to Gallia, nothing else is known. But heer I must require, as Pollio did, the diligence, at least the memory of CÃ¦sar: for if it were true, as they of Rhemes told him, that Divitiacus, not long before a Puissant King of the Soissons, had Britain also under his Command, besides the Belgian Colonies which he affirms to have nam'd, and peopl'd many Provinces there, if also the Britans had so frequently giv'n them aid in all thir Warrs, if lastly, the Druid learning honour'd so much among them, were at first taught them out of Britain, and they who soonest would attain that Discipline, sent hether to learn; it appears not how Britain at that time should be so utterly unknow'n in Gallia, or only know'n to Merchants, yea to them so little, that being call'd together from all parts, none could be found to inform CÃ¦sar of what bigness the Ile, what Nations, how great, what use of Warr they had, what Laws, or so much as what commodious Havens for bigger Vessels. Of all which things as it were then first to make discovery, he sends Caius Volusenus, in a long Galley, with command to return assoon as this could be effected. Hee in the mean time with his whole power draws nigh to the Morine Coast, whence the shortest passage was into Britain. Hether his Navy, which he us'd against the Armoricans, and what else of Shipping can be provided, he draws together. This known in Britain, Embassadors are sent from many of the States there, who promise Hostages, and Obedience to the Roman Empire. Them, after Audience giv'n, CÃ¦sar as largely promising, and exhorting to continue in that mind, sends home, and with them Comius of Arras, whom he had made King of that Country, and now secretly employ'd to gain a Roman party among the Britans, in as many Citties as he found inclinable, and to tell them, that he himself was speeding thether. Volusenus with what discovery of the Iland he could make from aboard his Ship, not daring to venture on the shoar, within five daies returns to CÃ¦sar. Who soon after, with two Legions, ordinarily amounting, of Romans and thir Allies, to about 25000 Foot, and 4500 Horse, the Foot in 80 Ships of burden, the Horse in 18, besides what Gallies were appointed for his chief Commanders, setts off about the third watch of night with a good Gale to Sea; leaving behind him Sulpitius Rufus to make good the Port with a sufficient strength. But the Horse whose appointed Shipping lay Wind-bound 8 mile upward in another Hav'n, had much trouble to Imbark. CÃ¦sar now within sight of Britain beholds on every Hill multitudes of armed men, ready to forbid his landing; and Cicero writes to his friend Atticus, that the accesses of the Iland were wondrously fortify'd with strong workes or moles. Heer from the fowrth to the ninth hour of day he awaits at Anchor the coming up of his whole Fleet. Mean while with his Legatts and Tribuns consulting, and giving order to fitt all things for what might happ'n in such a various, and floating water-fight as was to be expected. This place, which was a narrow Bay, close inviron'd with Hills, appearing no way commodious, he removes to a plain and open shoar 8 Mile distant; commonly suppos'd about Deal in Kent. Which when the Britans perceav'd, thir Horse and Chariots, as then they us'd in fight, scowring before, thir main powr speeding after, som thick upon the shoar, others not tarrying to be assail'd, ride in among the Waves to encounter, and assault the Romans eev'n under thir Ships; with such a bold, and free hardihood, that CÃ¦sar himself between confessing and excusing that his Souldiers were to come down from thir Ships, to stand in water heavy arm'd, and to fight at once, denies not but that the terrour of such new and resolute opposition made them forget thir wonted valour. To succour which he commands his Gallies, a sight unusual to the Britans, and more apt for motion, drawn from the bigger Vessels, to row against the op'n side of the Enemy, and thence with Slings, Engines and Darts, to beat them back. But neither yet, though amaz'd at the strangeness of those new Sea Castles, bearing up so neer, and so swiftly as almost to overwhelm them, the hurtling of Oares, the battring of feirce Engines against thir bodies barely expos'd, did the Britans give much ground, or the Romans gain; till he who bore the Eagle of the Tenth Legion, yet in the Gallies, first beseeching his gods, said thus alowd, leap down Souldiers, unless ye mean to betray your Ensigne; I for my part will perform what I ow to the Commonwealth and my General. This utter'd, over-board he leaps, and with his Eagle feircly advanc'd runs upon the Enemy; the rest hartning one another not to admit the dishonour of so nigh loosing thir cheif Standard, follow him resolutely. Now was fought eagerly on both sides. Ours who well knew thir own advantages, and expertly us'd them, now in the shallows, now on the Sand, still as the Romans went trooping to thir Ensignes, receav'd them, dispatch'd them, and with the help of thir Horse, put them every where to great disorder. But CÃ¦sar causing all his Boats and Shallops to be fill'd with Souldiers, commanded to ply up and down continually with releif where they saw need; Whereby at length all the Foot now dis-imbark't, and got together in som order on firm ground, with a more steddy charge put the Britans to flight: but wanting all thir Horse, whom the winds yet withheld from Sailing, they were not able to make poursuit. In this confused fight ScÃ¦va a Roman Souldier having press'd too far among the Britans, and besett round, after incredible valour shewn, single against a multitude, swom back safe to his General; and in the place that rung with his praises, earnestly besought pardon for his rash adventure against Discipline: which modest confessing after no bad event, for such a deed wherin valour, and ingenuity so much out-weigh'd transgression, easily made amends and preferr'd him to be a Centurion. CÃ¦sar also is brought in by Julian, attributing to himself the honour (if it were at all an honour to that person which he sustain'd) of being the first that left his Ship, and took Land: but this were to make CÃ¦sar less understand what became him then ScÃ¦va. The Britans finding themselvs maister'd in fight, forthwith send Embassadors to treat of peace, promising to give Hostages, and to be at command. With them Comius of Arras also return'd; whom hitherto since his first coming from CÃ¦sar, they had detain'd in Prison as a spy: the blame wherof they lay on the common people; for whose violence and thir own imprudence they crave pardon. CÃ¦sar complaining they had first sought peace, and then without cause had begun War, yet content to pardon them, commands Hostages: wherof part they bring in strait, others farr up in the Country to be sent for, they promise in a few daies. Mean while the people disbanded and sent home, many Princes and cheif men from all parts of the Ile submit themselvs and thir Citties to the dispose of CÃ¦sar, who lay then encamp'd, as is thought on Baram down. Thus had the Britans made thir peace; when suddenly an accident unlook'd for put new counsels into thir minds. Fowr daies after the coming of CÃ¦sar, those 18 Ships of burden, which from the upper hav'n had tak'n in all the Roman Horse, born with a soft wind to the very Coast, in sight of the Roman Camp, were by a sudden tempest scatter'd and driv'n back, som to the Port from whence they loos'd, others down into the West Country; who finding there no safety either to land or to cast Anchor, chose rather to commit themselvs again to the troubl'd Sea; and, as Orosius reports, were most of them cast away. The same Night, it being full Moon, the Gallies left upon dry Land, were unaware to the Romans, cover'd with a Spring-tide, and the greater Ships that lay off at Anchor, torn and beat'n with Waves, to the great perplexity of CÃ¦sar, and his whole Army; who now had neither Shipping left to convay them back, nor any provision made to stay heer, intending to have winter'd in Gallia. All this the Britans well perceaving, and by the compass of his Camp, which without baggage appear'd the smaller, guessing at his numbers, consult together, and one by one slily withdrawing from the Camp, where they were waiting the conclusion of a peace, resolve to stop all provisions, and to draw out the business till Winter. CÃ¦sar though ignorant of what they intended, yet from the condition wherin he was, and thir other hostages not sent, suspecting what was likely, begins to provide apace, all that might be, against what might happ'n: laies in Corn, and with materials fetch'd from the Continent, and what was left of those Ships which were past help, he repairs the rest. So that now by the incessant labour of his Souldiers, all but twelv were again made serviceable. While these things are doing, one of the Legions being sent out to forrage, as was accustom'd, and no suspicion of Warr, while som of the Britans were remaining in the Country about, others also going and coming freely to the Roman Quarters, they who were in station at the Camp Gates sent speedy word to CÃ¦sar, that from that part of the Country, to which the Legion went, a greater dust then usual was seen to rise. CÃ¦sar guessing the matter, commands the Cohorts of Guard to follow him thether, two others to succeed in thir stead, the rest all to arm and follow. They had not march'd long, when CÃ¦sar discerns his Legion sore overcharg'd: for the Britans not doubting but that thir Enemies on the morrow, would be in that place which only they had left unreap'd of all thir Harvest, had plac'd an Ambush; and while they were disperst and busiest at thir labour, set upon them, kill'd som, and routed the rest. The manner of thir fight was from a kind of Chariots; wherin riding about, and throwing Darts, with the clutter of thir Horse, and of thir Wheels, they oft-times broke the rank of thir Enemies; then retreating among the Horse and quitting thir Chariots, they fought on Foot. The Charioters in the mean while somwhat aside from the Battell, set themselvs in such order, that thir Maisters at any time oppress'd with odds, might retire safely thether, having perform'd with one person both the nimble service of a Horse-man, and the stedfast duty of a Foot Souldier. So much they could with thir Chariots by use, and exercise, as riding on the speed down a steep Hill, to stop suddenly, and with a short rein turn swiftly, now running on the beam, now on the Yoke, then in the Seat. With this sort of new skirmishing the Romans now overmatch'd, and terrify'd, CÃ¦sar with opportune aid appears; for then the Britans make a stand: but he considering that now was not fitt time to offer Battell, while his men were scarce recover'd of so late a fear, only keeps his ground, and soon after leads back his Legions to the Camp. Furder action for many days following was hinder'd on both sides by foul weather; in which time the Britans dispatching Messengers round about, to how few the Romans were reduc'd, what hope of prise and booty, and now if ever of freeing themselvs from the fear of like invasions heerafter by making these an example, if they could but now uncamp thir Enemies, at this intimation multitudes of Horse and Foot coming down from all parts make towards the Romans. CÃ¦sar foreseeing that the Britans, though beat'n and put to flight would easily evade his Foot, yet with no more then 30 Horse, which Comius had brought over, draws out his men to Battell, puts again the Britans to flight, poursues with slaughter, and returning burns and laies waste all about. Whereupon Embassadors the same day being sent from the Britans to desire peace, CÃ¦sar as his affairs at present stood, for so great a breach of Faith, only imposes on them double the former hostages, to be sent after him into Gallia: And because September was nigh half spent, a season not fit to tempt the Sea with his weather-beat'n Fleet, the same night with a fair wind he departs towards Belgia; whether two only of the Britan Citties sent Hostages, as they promis'd, the rest neglected. But at Rome when the news came of CÃ¦sars acts here, whether it were esteem'd a Conquest, or a fair Escape, supplication of 20 days is decreed by the Senate, as either for an exploit done, or a discovery made, wherin both CÃ¦sar and the Romans gloried not a little, though it brought no benefit either to him, or the Commonwealth.\n\nThe Winter following, CÃ¦sar, as his custom was, going into Italy, when as he saw that most of the Britans regarded not to send thir Hostages, appoints his Legats whom he left in Belgia, to provide what possible Shipping they could either build, or repair. Low built they were to bee, as therby easier both to fraught, and to hale ashoar; nor needed to be higher, because the Tyde so often changing, was observ'd to make the Billows less in our Sea then those in the Mediterranean: broader likewise they were made, for the better transporting of Horses, and all other fraughtage, being intended cheifly to that end. These all about 600. in a readiness, with 28 Ships of burden, and what with adventurers, and other hulks above 200, Cotta one of the Legates wrote them, as AthenÃ¦us affirms, in all 1000, CÃ¦sar from Port Iccius, a passage of som 30 mile over, leaving behind him Labienus to guard the hav'n, and for other supply at need, with five Legions, though but 2000 Horse, about sun sett hoysing sail with a slack South-West, at midnight was becalm'd. And finding when it was light, that the whole Navy lying on the current, had fal'n of from the Ile, which now they could descry on thir left hand, by the unwearied labour of his Souldiers, who refus'd not to tugg the Oare, and kept course with Ships under sayl, he bore up as neer as might bee, to the same place where he had landed the yeer before; where about noon arriving, no Enemy could be seen. For the Britans, which in great number, as was after know'n, had bin there, at sight of so huge a Fleet durst not abide. CÃ¦sar forthwith landing his Army, and encamping to his best advantage, som notice being giv'n him by those he took, where to find the Enemy, with his whole power, save only ten cohorts, and 300 Horse, left to Quintus Atrius for the guard of his Ships, about the third watch of the same night marches up twelv mile into the Country. And at length by a River commonly thought the Stowre in Kent, espies embattail'd the British Forces. They with thir Horses and Chariots advancing to the higher Banks, oppose the Romans in thir March, and begin the fight; but repuls't by the Roman Cavalrie give back into the Woods to a place notably made strong both by Art and Nature; which, it seems, had bin a Fort, or Hold of strength rays'd heertofore in time of Warrs among themselvs. For entrance, and access on all sides, by the felling of huge Trees overthwart one another, was quite barr'd up; and within these the Britans did thir utmost to keep out the Enemy. But the Souldiers of the seventh Legion locking all thir Sheilds together like a rooff close over head, and others raysing a Mount, without much loss of blood took the place, and drove them all to forsake the Woods. Pursuit they made not long, as beeing through ways unknow'n; and now ev'ning came on, which they more wisely spent, in choosing out where to pitch and fortify thir Camp that night. The next Morning CÃ¦sar had but newly sent out his men in three bodies to poursue, and the last no furder gon then yet in sight, when Horsemen all in Poste from Quintus Atrius bring word to CÃ¦sar, that almost all his Ships in a Tempest that night had suffer'd wrack, and lay brok'n upon the shoar. CÃ¦sar at this news recalls his Legions, himself in all hast riding back to the Sea-side, beheld with his own Eyes the ruinous prospect. About forty Vessels were sunk and lost, the residue so torn and shak'n as not to be new rigg'd without much labour. Strait he assembles what number of Ship-wrights either in his own Legions or from beyond Sea, could be summon'd; appoints Labienus on the Belgian side to build more; and with a dreadful industry of ten days, not respiting his Souldiers day or night, drew up all his Ships, and entrench'd them round within the circuit of his Camp. This don, and leaving to thir defence the same strength as before, he returns with his whole Forces to the same Wood, where he had defeated the Britans: who preventing him with greater powers then before, had now repossess'd themselvs of that place, under Cassibelan thir cheif Leader. Whose Territory from the States bordering on the Sea was divided by the River Thames about 80 mile inward. With him formerly other Citties had continual Warr; but now in the common danger had all made choise of him to be thir Generall. Heer the British Horse and Charioters meeting with the Roman Cavalrie fought stoutly; and at first, somthing overmatch'd they retreat to the neer advantage of thir Woods and Hills, but still follow'd by the Romans, make head again, cut of the forwardest among them, and after some pause, while CÃ¦sar, who thought the days work had bin don, was busied about the entrenching of his Camp, march out again, give feirce assault to the very Stations of his Guards and Senteries, and while the main cohorts of two Legions that were sent to the Alarme, stood within a small distance of each other terrify'd at the newness and boldness of thir fight, charg'd back again through the midst, without loss of a man. Of the Romans that day was slain Quintus Laberius Durus a Tribune: the Britans having fought thir fill at the very entrance of CÃ¦sars Camp, and sustain'd the resistance of his whole Army entrench'd, gave over the assault. CÃ¦sar heer acknowledges that the Roman way both of arming, and of fighting, was not so well fitted against this kind of Enemy; for that the Foot in heavy Armour could not follow thir cunning flight, and durst not by ancient Discipline stirr from thir Ensigne; and the Horse alone disjoyn'd from the Legions, against a foe that turn'd suddenly upon them with a mixt encounter both of Horse and Foot, were in equall danger both following and retiring. Besides thir fashion was, not in great bodies, and close order, but in small divisions, and open distances to make thir onset; appointing others at certain spaces, now to releev and bring of the weary, now to succeed and renew the conflict; which argu'd no small experience, and use of Armes. Next day the Britans afarr off upon the Hills begin to shew themselves heer and there, and though less boldly then before, to skirmish with the Roman Horse. But at Noon CÃ¦sar having sent out 3 Legions, and all his Horse, with Trebonius the Legat, to seek fodder, suddenly on all sides they set upon the Forragers, and charge up after them to the very Legions, and thir Standards. The Romans with great courage beat them back, and in the chace, beeing well seconded by the Legions, not giving them time either to rally, to stand, or to descend from thir Chariots as they were wont, slew many. From this overthrow, the Britans that dwelt farder off, betook them home; and came no more after that time with so great a power against CÃ¦sar. Whereof advertis'd he marches onward to the Frontiers of Cassibelan, which on this side were bounded by the Thames, not passable except in one place and that difficult, about Coway stakes neer Oatlands, as is conjectur'd. Hither coming he descries on the other side great Forces of the Enemy, plac'd in good Array; the bank sett all with sharp stakes, others in the bottom, cover'd with water; whereof the marks in Beda's time, were to be seene, as he relates. This having learnt by such as were tak'n, or had run to him, he first commands his Horse to pass over; then his Foot, who wadeing up to the neck went on so resolutely, and so fast, that they on the furder side not enduring the violence, retreated and fled. Cassibelan noe more now in hope to contend for Victorie, dismissing all but 4000. of those Charioters, through Woods, and intricate waies attends thir motion; where the Romans are to pass, drives all before him; and with continuall sallies upon the Horse, where they least expected, cutting off some and terrifying others, compells them soe close together, as gave them no leave to fetch in prey or bootie without ill success. Whereupon CÃ¦sar strictly commanding all not to part from the Legions, had nothing left him in his way but empty Fields and Houses, which he spoil'd and burnt. Meane while the Trinobantes a State, or Kingdome, and perhaps the greatest then among the Britans, less favouring Cassibelan, send Embassadors, and yeild to CÃ¦sar upon this reason. Immanuentius had bin thir King: him Cassibelan had slaine, and purpos'd the like to Mandubratius his Son, whom Orosius calls Androgorius, Beda Androgius; but the youth escaping by flight into Gallia, put himself under the protection of CÃ¦sar. These entreat that Mandubratius may be still defended; and sent home to succeed in his Fathers right. CÃ¦sar sends him, demands 40 Hostages and provision for his Armie, which they immediately bring in, and have thir Confines protected from the Souldier. By their example the Cenimagni, Segontiaci, Ancalites, Bibroci, Cassi (so I write them, for the modern names are but guess'd) on like terms make thir peace. By them he learns that the Town of Cassibelan, suppos'd to be Verulam, was not farr distant; fenc't about with Woods and Marshes, well stuff't with men and much Cattel. For Towns then in Britain were only Wooddy places Ditch't round and with a Mud Wall encompass'd against the inrodes of Enemies. Thether goes CÃ¦sar with his Legions, and though a place of great strength both by art and nature, assaults it in two places. The Britans after some defence fled out all at another end of the Town; in the flight many were taken, many slain, and great store of Cattel found there. Cassibelan for all these losses yet deserts not himself; nor was yet his authoritie so much impair'd, but that in Kent, though in a manner possest by the Enemie, his Messengers and commands finde obedience anough to raise all the people. By his direction, Cingetorix, Carvilius, Taximagulus and Segonax, fowr Kings Reigning in those Countries which ly upon the Sea, lead them on to assault that Camp wherein the Romans had entrench'd thir Shipping: but they whom CÃ¦sar left there, issuing out slew many, and took Prisners Cingetorix a noted Leader, without loss of thir own. Cassibelan after so many defeats, mov'd especially by revolt of the Citties from him, thir inconstancie and falshood one to another, uses mediation by Comius of Arras to send Embassadors about treatie of yeilding. CÃ¦sar who had determin'd to Winter in the Continent, by reason that Gallia was unsettl'd and not much of the Summer now behind, commands him only Hostages, and what yearly Tribute the Iland should pay to Rome, forbidds him to molest the Trinobants, or Mandubratius; and with his Hostages, and great number of Captives he puts to Sea, haveing at twise embark't his whole Armie. At his return to Rome, as from a glorious enterprise, he offers to Venus the Patroness of his Family, a Corslet of British Pearles.\n\nHowbeit other antient writers have spok'n more doubtfully of CÃ¦sars Victories heer; and that in plaine termes he fled from hence; for which the common verse in Lucan with divers passages heer and there in Tacitus is alleg'd. Paulus Orosius, who took what he wrote from a Historie of Suetonius now lost, writes that CÃ¦sar in his first journey entertain'd with a sharp fight, lost no small number of his Foot, and by tempest nigh all his Horse. Dion affirms that once in the second expedition all his Foot were routed; Orosius that another time all his Horse. The British Author, whom I use only then when others are all silent, hath many trivial discourses of CÃ¦sars beeing heer, which are best omitted. Nor have wee more of Cassibelan, then what the same storie tells, how he warr'd soon after with Androgeus, about his Nefew slain by Evelinus Nefew to the other; which business at length compos'd, Cassibelan dies, and was buried in Yorke, if the Monmouth Booke Fable not. But at CÃ¦sars coming hither, such likeliest were the Britans, as the Writers of those times, and thir own actions represent them; in courage and warlike readiness to take advantage by ambush or sudden onset, not inferiour to the Romans, nor Cassibelan to CÃ¦sar, in Weapons, Armes, and the skill of Encamping, Embattailing, Fortifying, overmatch't; thir Weapons were a short Speare and light Target, a Sword also by thir side, thir fight sometimes in Chariots phang'd at the Axle with Iron Sithes, thir bodies most part naked, only painted with woad in sundrie figures, to seeme terrible, as they thought, but poursu'd by Enemies, not nice of thir painting to run into Bogs, worse then wild Irish up to the Neck, and there to stay many daies holding a certain morsel in thir mouths no bigger then a bean, to suffice hunger; but that receit, and the temperance it taught, is long since unknown among us: thir Towns and strong holds were spaces of ground fenc't about with a Ditch and great Trees fell'd overthwart each other, thir buildings within were thatch't Houses for themselves and thir Cattell: in peace the Upland Inhabitants besides hunting tended thir flocks and heards, but with little skill of Countrie affaires; the making of Cheese they commonly knew not, Woole or Flax they spun not, gard'ning and planting many of them knew not; clothing they had none, but what the skins of Beasts afforded them, and that not alwaies; yet gallantrie they had, painting thir own skins with severall Portratures of Beast, Bird, or Flower, a Vanitie which hath not yet left us, remov'd only from the skin to the skirt behung now with as many colour'd Ribands and gewgawes; towards the Sea side they till'd the ground, and liv'd much after the manner of Gaules thir Neighbours, or first Planters: thir money was brazen pieces or Iron Rings, thir best Merchandise Tin, the rest trifles of Glass, Ivorie, and such like; yet Gemms and Pearles they had, saith Mela, in some Rivers: thir Ships of light timber wickerd with Oysier betweene, and coverd over with Leather, serv'd not therefore to tranceport them farr, and thir commodities were fetch't away by Foren Merchants: thir dealing, saith Diodorus, plaine and simple without fraude; thir civil Government under many Princes and States, not confederate or consulting in common, but mistrustfull, and oft-times warring one with the other, which gave them up one by one an easie Conquest to the Romans: thir Religion was governd by a sort of Priests or Magicians, call'd Druides from the Greek name of an Oke, which Tree they had in greate reverence, and the Missleto especially growing theron. Plinie writes them skill'd in Magic no less then those of Persia: by thir abstaining from a Hen, a Hare, and a Goose, from Fish also, saith Dion, and thir opinion of the Soules passing after Death into other Bodies, they may be thought to have studied Pythagoras; yet Philosophers I cannot call them, reported men factious and ambitious, contending somtimes about the archpriesthood not without civil Warr and slaughter; nor restrein'd they the people under them from a lew'd, adulterous and incestuous life, ten or twelve men absurdly against nature, possessing one woman as thir common Wife, though of neerest Kin, Mother, Daughter, or Sister; Progenitors not to be glori'd in. But the Gospel, not long after preach't heer, abolish'd such impurities, and of the Romans we have cause not to say much worse, then that they beate us into some civilitie; likely else to have continu'd longer in a barbarous and savage manner of life. After Julius (for Julius before his Death tyrannously had made himself Emperor of the Roman Common-wealth, and was slaine in the Senate for so doeing) he who next obtain'd the Empire, Octavianus CÃ¦sar Augustus, either contemning the Iland, as Strabo would have us think, whose neither benefit was worth the having, nor enmitie worth the fearing; or out of a wholsome state maxim, as some say, to moderate and bound the Empire from growing vast and unweildie, made no attempt against the Britans. But the truer cause was partly civil Warr among the Romans, partly other affairs more urging. For about 20 Years after, all which time the Britans had liv'd at thir own dispose, Augustus in imitation of his Uncle Julius, either intending or seeming to intend an expedition hither, was com into Gallia, when the news of a revolt in Pannonia diverted him: about 7 year after in the same resolution, what with the unsettl'dness of Gallia, and what with Embassadors from Britain which met him there, he proceeded not. The next year, difference arising about Covnants, he was again prevented by other new commotions in Spaine. Nevertheless som of the British Potentates omitted not to seek his friendship by guifts offerd in the Capitol, and other obsequious addresses. Insomuch that the whole Iland became eev'n in those daies well known to the Romans; too well perhaps for them, who from the knowledge of us were so like to prove Enemies. But as for Tribute, the Britans paid none to Augustus, except what easie customes were levied on the slight commodities wherewith they traded into Gallia.\n\nAfter Cassibelan, Tenantius the younger Son of Lud, according to the Monmouth Storie was made King. For Androgeus the Elder, conceaving himself generally hated, for sideing with the Romans, forsook his claime heer, and follow'd CÃ¦sars Fortune. This King is recorded Just and Warlike.\n\nHis Son Kymbeline or Cunobeline succeeding, was brought up, as is said, in the court of Augustus, and with him held friendly correspondences to the end; was a warlike Prince, his chief seat Camalodonum, or Maldon, as by certain of his coines yet to be seen, appears. Tiberius the next Emperor, adhering alwaies to the advice of Augustus, and of himself less careing to extend the bounds of his Empire, sought not the Britans; and they as little to incite him, sent home courteously the Souldiers of Germanicus, that by Shipwrack had bin cast on the Britan shoar. But Caligula his Successor, a wild and dissolute Tyrant, haveing past the Alpes with intent to rob and spoile those Provinces, and stirr'd up by Adminius the Son of Cunobeline; who by his Father banish'd, with a small number fled thether to him, made semblance of marching toward Britain; but beeing come to the Ocean, and there behaveing himself madly, and ridiculously, went back the same way: yet sent before him boasting letters to the Senate, as if all Britain had bin yeilded him. Cunobeline now dead, Adminius the Eldest by his Father banish'd from his Country, and by his own practice against it, from the Crown, though by an old coine seeming to have also reign'd; Togodumnus, and Caractacus the two younger, uncertaine whether equal or subordinat in power, were advanc'd into his place. But through civil discord, Bericus (what he was furder, is not known) with others of his party flying to Rome, persuaded Claudius the Emperor to an invasion. Claudius now Consul the third time, and desirous to do something, whence he might gain the honour of a Triumph, at the persuasion of these fugitives, whom the Britans demanding, he had deny'd to render, and they for that cause had deny'd furder amity with Rome, makes choise of this Iland for his Province: and sends before him Aulus Plautius the PrÃ¦tor, with this command, if the business grew difficult to give him notice. Plautius with much ado persuaded the Legions to move out of Gallia, murmuring that now they must be put to make Warr beyond the Worlds End, for so they counted Britain; and what welcom Julius the Dictator found there, doubtless they had heard. At last prevail'd with, and hoyssing saile from three several Ports, lest thir landing should in any one place be resisted, meeting cross winds, they were cast back and disheartn'd: till in the night a meteor shooting flames from the East, and, as they fansi'd, directing thir course, they took heart againe to try the Sea, and without opposition landed. For the Britans haveing heard of thir unwillingness to come, had been negligent to provide against them; and retireing to the Woods and Moares, intended to frustrate and wear them out with delaies, as they had serv'd CÃ¦sar before. Plautius after much trouble to find them out, encountring first with Caractacus, then with Togodumnus, overthrew them; and receaving into conditions part of the Boduni, who then were subject to the Catuellani, and leaving there a Garrison, went on toward a River; where the Britans not imagining that Plautius without a bridge could pass, lay on the furder side careless and secure. But he sending first the Germans, whose custome was, arm'd as they were, to swim with ease the strongest current, commands them to strike especially at the Horses, whereby the Chariots, wherein consisted thir chief art of fight, became unserviceable. To second them he sent Vespatian, who in his later daies obtain'd the Empire, and Sabinus his Brother; who unexpectedly assailing those who were least aware, did much execution. Yet not for this were the Britans dismaid; but reuniteing the next day fought with such a courage, as made it hard to decide which way hung the Victorie: till Caius Sidius Geta, at point to have bin tak'n, recover'd himself so valiantly, as brought the day on his side; for which at Rome he receav'd high honours. After this the Britans drew back toward the mouth of Thames, and acquainted with those places, cross'd over; where the Romans following them through bogs and dangerous flats, hazarded the loss of all. Yet the Germans getting over, and others by a bridge at some place above, fell on them again with sundry Alarmes and great slaughter; but in the heat of pursuit running themselves again into Bogs and Mires, lost as many of thir own. Upon which ill success, and seeing the Britans more enrag'd at the Death of Togodumnus, who in one of these Battels had bin slain, Plautius fearing the worst, and glad that he could hold what he held, as was enjoyn'd him, sends to Claudius. He who waited ready with a huge preparation, as if not safe anough amidst the flowr of all his Romans, like a great Eastern King, with armed Elephants marches through Gallia. So full of perill was this enterprise esteem'd, as not without all this Equipage, and stranger terrors then Roman Armies to meet the native and the naked British valour defending their Country. Joyn'd with Plautius who encamping on the Bank of Thames attended him, he passes the River. The Britans, who had the courage, but not the wise conduct of old Cassibelan, laying all Stratagem aside, in down right manhood scrupl'd not to affront in op'n field almost the whole power of the Roman Empire. But overcome and vanquish'd, part by force, others by treatie com in and yeild. Claudius therfore who took Camalodonum, the Royal Seat of Cunobeline, was oft'n by his Armie saluted Imperator; a Militarie Title which usually they gave thir Generall after any notable exploit; but to others not above once in the same Warr; as if Claudius by these Acts had deservd more then the Laws of Rome had provided honour to reward. Haveing therefore disarm'd the Britans, but remitted the confiscation of thir goods, for which they worship'd him with Sacrifice and Temple as a God, leaving Plautius to subdue what remain'd; he returnes to Rome, from whence he had been absent only six moneths, and in Britain but 16 daies; sending the news before him of his Victories, though in a small part of the Iland. To whom the Senate, as for atchievements of highest merit, decree'd excessive honours; Arches, Triumphs, annual Solemnities, and the Sirname of Britannicus both to him and his Son.\n\nSuetonius writes that Claudius found heer no resistance, and that all was done without stroke: but this seems not probable. The Monmouth Writer names these two Sones of Cunobeline, Guiderius, and Arviragus; that Guiderius beeing slaine in sight, Arviragus to conceale it, put on his Brothers Habillements, and in his person held up the Battel to a Victorie; the rest, as of Hamo the Roman Captaine, Genuissa the Emperors Daughter, and such like stuff, is too palpably untrue to be worth rehersing in the midst of Truth. Plautius after this, employing his fresh Forces to Conquer on, and quiet the rebelling Countries, found worke anough to deserve at his returne a kind of Tryumphant riding into the Capitol side by side with the Emperour. Vespatian also under Plautius had thirtie conflicts with the Enemie; in one of which encompass'd and in great danger, he was valiantly and piously rescu'd by his Son Titus: two powerfull Nations he subdu'd heer, above 20 Townes and the Ile of Wight; for which he receav'd at Rome Tryumphal Ornaments, and other great dignities. For that Cittie in reward of vertue was ever magnificent: and long after when true merit was ceas'd among them, lest any thing resembling vertue should want honour, the same rewards were yet allow'd to the very shadow and ostentation of merit. Ostorius in the room of Plautius Vice-prÃ¦tor, met with turbulent affaires; the Britans not ceasing to vex with inrodes all those Countries that were yeilded to the Romans; and now the more eagerly, supposing that the new Generall unacquainted with his Armie, and on the edge of Winter, would not hastily oppose them. But he waighing that first events were most available to breed fear or contempt, with such cohorts as were next at hand sets out against them: whome having routed, so close he followes, as one who meant not to be everie day molested with the cavils of a slight peace, or an emboldn'd Enemie. Lest they should make head againe, he disarmes whom he suspects; and to surround them, places many Garrisons upon the Rivers of Antona and Sabrina. But the Icenians, a stout people untouch'd yet by these Warrs, as haveing before fought alliance with the Romans, were the first that brook'd not this. By their example others rise; and in a chosen place, fenc't with high Banks of Earth, and narrow Lanes to prevent the Horse, warily Encampe. Ostorius, though yet not strengthn'd with his Legions, causes the auxiliar Bands, his Troops also allighting, to assault the rampart. They within though pester'd with thir own number, stood to it like men resolv'd, and in a narrow compass did remarkable deeds. But overpowerd at last, and others by thir success quieted, who till then waverd, Ostorius next bends his Force upon the Cangians, wasting all eeven to the Sea of Ireland, without foe in his way, or them, who durst, ill handl'd; when the Brigantes attempting new matters, drew him back to settle first what was unsecure behind him. They, of whome the chief were punish'd, the rest forgiv'n, soon gave over, but the Silures no way tractable, were not to be repress'd without a set Warr. To furder this, Camalodonum was planted with a Colony of Veteran Souldiers; to be a firme and readie aid against revolts, and a means to teach the Natives Roman Law and Civilitie. Cogidunus also a British King, thir fast friend, had to the same intent certain Citties giv'n him: a haughtie craft, which the Romans us'd, to make Kings also the servile agents of enslaving others. But the Silures hardie of themselves, rely'd more on the valour of Caractacus; whome many doubtfull, many prosperous successes had made eminent above all that rul'd in Britain. He adding to his courage Policie, and knowing himself to be of strength inferior, in other advantages the better; makes the Seat of his Warr among the Ordovices; a Country wherein all the odds were to his own partie, all the difficulties to his Enemie. The Hills and every access he fortifi'd with heapes of Stones, and guards of men; to com at whom a River of unsafe passage must be first waded. The place, as Camden conjectures, had thence the name of Caer-Caradoc on the West edge of Shropshire. He himself continually went up and down, animating his Officers and Leaders, that this was the day, this the field either to defend thir Libertie, or to die free; calling to mind the names of his glorious Ancestors, who drove CÃ¦sar the Dictator out of Britain, whose valour hitherto had preserv'd them from bondage, thir Wives and Children from dishonour. Inflam'd with these words, they all vow thir utmost, with such undaunted resolution as amaz'd the Roman Generall; but the Souldier less waighing, because less knowing, clamourd to be led on against any danger. Ostorius after wary circumspection bidds them pass the River: the Britans no sooner had them within reach of thir Arrowes, Darts and Stones, but slew and wounded largly of the Romans. They on the other side closeing thir ranks, and over head closeing thir Targetts, threw down the loose rampires of the Britans, and persue them up the Hills both light arm'd and Legions; till what with gauling Darts and heavie strokes, the Britans who wore neither Helmet nor Cuirass to defend them, were at last overcome. This the Romans thought a famous Victorie; wherein the Wife and Daughter of Caractacus were tak'n, his Brothers also reduc'd to obedience; himself escapeing to Cartismandua Queene of the Brigantes, against faith giv'n was to the Victors deliverd bound: having held out against the Romans nine year, saith Tacitus, but by truer computation, Seaven. Whereby his name was up through all the adjoyning Provinces, eev'n to Italy and Rome: many desiring to see who he was, that could withstand so many years the Roman Puissance: and CÃ¦sar to extoll his own Victorie, extoll'd the man whom he had vanquish'd. Beeing brought to Rome, the people as to a Solemn spectacle were call'd together, the Emperors Guard stood in Armes. In order came first the Kings Servants, bearing his Trophies won in other Warrs, next, his Brothers, Wife, and Daughter, last himself. The behaviour of others through fear was low and degenerate: he only neither in countenance, word, or action, submissive standing at the Tribunal of Claudius, briefly spake to this purpose. If my Mind, CÃ¦sar, had bin as moderate in the highth of Fortune, as my Birth and Dignitie was eminent, I might have come a friend rather then a Captive into this Cittie. Nor couldst thou have dislik'd him for a confederate, so noble of descent, and ruling so many Nations. My present estate to me disgracefull, to thee is glorious. I had Riches, Horses, Armes, and men; no wonder then if I contended, not to loose them. But if by Fate, yours only must be Empire, then of necessitie ours among the rest must be subjection. If I sooner had bin brought to yeild, my misfortune had bin less notorious, your Conquest had bin less renown'd; and in your severest determining of me, both will be soon forgott'n. But if you grant that I shall live, by me will live to you for ever that praise which is so neer divine, the clemency of a Conqueror. CÃ¦sar mov'd at such a spectacle of Fortune, but especially at the nobleness of his bearing it, gave him pardon, and to all the rest. They all unbound, submissely thank him, and did like Reverence to Agrippina the Emperors Wife, who sat by in State; a new and disdained sight to the manly Eyes of Romans, a Woeman sitting public in her Female pride among Ensignes and Armed Cohorts. To Ostorius Tryumph is decreed; and his Acts esteem'd equall to theirs, that brought in Bonds to Rome famousest Kings. But the same prosperitie attended not his later actions heer. For the Silures, whether to reveng thir loss of Caractacus, or that they saw Ostorius, as if now all were done, less earnest to restrain them, besett the Prefect of his Camp, left there with Legionarie Bands to appoint Garrisons: and had not speedie aid com in from the neighbouring Holds and Castles, had cutt them all off; notwithstanding which, the PrÃ¦fect with 8 Centurions, and many their stoubtest men were slaine: and upon the neck of this, meeting first with Roman Forragers, then with other Troops hasting to thir relief, utterly foyl'd and broke them also. Ostorius sending more after, could hardly stay thir flight; till the waighty Legions coming on, at first poys'd the Battel, at length turn'd the Scale: to the Britans without much loss, for by that time it grew night. Then was the Warr shiverd as it were into small frayes and bickerings; not unlike sometimes to so many robberies, in Woods, at Waters, as chance or valour, advice or rashness, led them on, commanded or without command. That which most exasperated the Silures, was a report of certaine words cast out by the Emperor, that he would root them out to the verie name. Therefore two Cohorts more of Auxiliars, by the avarice of thir Leaders too securely pillageing, they quite intercepted: and bestowing liberally the Spoils and Captives, whereof they took plentie; drew other Countries to joyne with them. These losses falling so thick upon the Romans, Ostorius with the thought, and anguish thereof ended his daies; the Britans rejoycing, although no Battel, that yet adverse Warr had worne out so great a Souldier. CÃ¦sar in his place ordaines Aulus Didius: but ere his coming, though much hastn'd, that the Province might not want a Governour; the Silures had giv'n an overthrow to Manlius Valens with his Legion, rumor'd on both sides greater then was true, by the Silures to amate the new Generall; by him in a double respect, of the more praise if he queld them, or the more excuse if he fail'd. Meane time the Silures forgett not to infest the Roman pale with wide excursions; till Didius marching out, kept them somwhat more within bounds. Nor were they long to seek, who after Caractacus should lead them; for next to him in worth and skill of Warr, Venutius a Prince of the Brigantes merited to be thir chief. He at first faithfull to the Romans, and by them protected, was the Husband of Cartismandua Q. of the Brigantes, himself perhaps reigning elsewhere. She who had betray'd Caractacus and her Countrie to adorne the Tryumph of Claudius, thereby grown powerfull and gratious with the Romans, presuming on the hire of her treason, deserted her Husband; and marrying Vellocatus one of his Squires, conferrs on him the Kingdome also. This deed so odious and full of infamie, disturb'd the whole State; Venutius with other Forces, and the help of her own Subjects, who detested the example of so foule a fact, and withal the uncomeliness of thir Subjection to the Monarchie of a Woeman, a peece of manhood not every day to be found among Britans, though shee had got by suttle train his Brother with many of his kindred into her hands, brought her soon below the confidence of beeing able to resist longer. When imploring the Roman aid, with much adoe, and after many a hard encounter, she escap'd the punishment which was readie to have seis'd her. Venutius thus debar'd the autority of ruling his own Houshold, justly turnes his anger against the Romans themselves; whose magnanimitie not wont to undertake dishonorable causes, had arrogantly intermeddl'd in his domestic affaires, to uphold the Rebelion of an adultress against her Husband. And the Kingdome "
