Absztrakt

The first known Hungarian marriage contract is dated to the turn of the twelfth and thirteenth centuries, when King Emeric (1196-1204) married Constance of Aragon, in 1196. According to this marriage contract, the king gave his wife two counties together with all their belongings (taxes, costumes etc.). In addition of leaving the country after the king's death she had to be payed 12000 marks as a compensation. Although the marriage contract is without doubt the most valuable source of the Hungarian queen's possession, there are some other references about her significant though limited power in Hungary. For example the wealthy market place of Asszonyvasara (Forum Reginae). Although the Hungarian king took care of his wife's revenue, never allowed her much economic or political power. Nevertheless this kind of contract came in fashion because of her influence: the second marriage contract was made in the royal court, between a Hungarian noble and a lady, who came from Aragon and was the favourite lady of the queen's escort. After Emeric's sudden death Constance had to escape from Hungary with her 5 year old son King Ladislas III (1204-1205). The child died in Austria, and Constance married Frederic II in 1209. She ended her life in 1222 as Empress Constance without the royal marks of the first Hungarian marriage contract.
