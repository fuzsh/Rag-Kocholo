        "text": "author unknown\n\nYou say you will never forget where you were when\n\nyou heard the news On September 11, 2001.\n\nNeither will I.\n\nI was on the 110th floor in a smoke filled room\n\nwith a man who called his wife to say ‘Good-Bye.’ I\n\nheld his fingers steady as he dialed. I gave him the\n\npeace to say, ‘Honey, I am not going to make it, but it\n\nis OK..I am ready to go.’\n\nI was with his wife when he called as she fed\n\nbreakfast to their children. I held her up as she\n\ntried to understand his words and as she realized\n\nhe wasn’t coming home that night.\n\nI was in the stairwell of the 23rd floor when a\n\nwoman cried out to Me for help. ‘I have been\n\nknocking on the door of your heart for 50 years!’ I said.\n\n‘Of course I will show you the way home – only\n\nbelieve in Me now.’\n\nI was at the base of the building with the Priest\n\nministering to the injured and devastated souls.\n\nI took him home to tend to his Flock in Heaven. He\n\nheard my voice and answered.\n\nI was on all four of those planes, in every seat,\n\nwith every prayer. I was with the crew as they\n\nwere overtaken. I was in the very hearts of the\n\nbelievers there, comforting and assuring them that their\n\nfaith has saved them.\n\nI was in Texas , Virginia , California , Michigan , Afghanistan .\n\nI was standing next to you when you heard the terrible news.\n\nDid you sense Me?\n\nI want you to know that I saw every face. I knew\n\nevery name – though not all know Me. Some met Me\n\nfor the first time on the 86th floor.\n\nSome sought Me with their last breath.\n\nSome couldn’t hear Me calling to them through the\n\nsmoke and flames; ‘Come to Me… this way… take\n\nmy hand.’ Some chose, for the final time, to ignore Me.\n\nBut, I was there.\n\nI did not place you in the Tower that day. You\n\nmay not know why, but I do. However, if you were\n\nthere in that explosive moment in time, would you have\n\nreached for Me?\n\nSept. 11, 2001, was not the end of the journey\n\nfor you. But someday your journey will end. And I\n\nwill be there for you as well. Seek Me now while I may\n\nbe found. Then, at any moment, you know you are\n\n‘ready to go.’\n\nI will be in the stairwell of your final moments."
