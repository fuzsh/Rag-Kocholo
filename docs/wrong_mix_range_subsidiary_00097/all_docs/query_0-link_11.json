This year, we are excited to be celebrating 17 years of Customer Service Experience Transformation. Customers have more channels and more choices than ever before. We are in a new C to B world where the customer’s in the driver’s seat. Over the last decade, the focus has shifted to the customer. However, is simply prioritizing the customer good enough anymore? Today, customers expect service on their own terms – whenever they need, in whatever digital channel they want. Expectations have grown and the key word is EFFORTLESS. For a brand to truly differentiate by leveraging customer experience, effortless has to be at its very foundation. Therefore, customer experience has shifted its end goal from personalizing to predicting customer needs. This transition is easier said than done, and it’s certainly not a one size fits all approach. CCW will provide you with the tools and insight needed to super-charge your service and set you on the path to predicting customer needs and driving loyalty. Discover how to create the right environment to execute an effortless customer experience. We look forward to seeing you in Las Vegas and if you have any questions, please don’t hesitate to reach out to the CCW team. All the best, Lisa Schulman Executive Program Director Call Center Week #CallCenterWeek WE LIVE IN AN AGE WHERE CONVENIENCE IS KING. P.S. Do YOU have a story to tell?

He then joined Zappos as an advisor and investor, and eventually became CEO, where he helped Zappos grow from almost no sales in 1999 to the multi-billion dollar company it is today. Back in 2009, the company was acquired by Amazon in 2009 in a deal valued at $1.2 billion on the day of closing. Tony has remained as CEO of Zappos, which operates independently of Amazon, and continues to help build Zappos as a company dedicated to customer service, company culture, and community. Tony’s book, Delivering Happiness, was published in 2010, and outlines his path from starting a worm farm to life at Zappos. Tony shows how a very different kind of corporate culture is a powerful model for achieving success and happiness. “Delivering Happiness”, debuted at #1 on the New York Times Bestseller list. In addition to his responsibilities as CEO of Zappos.com, Tony helped start Downtown Project (www.downtownproject.com), a group committed to helping transform downtown Las Vegas into the most community-focused large city in the world. This transformation includes the relocation of the Zappos offices from Henderson, Nevada to what was the old City Hall in downtown Las Vegas. 1. completely changing the way that something is done, thought about, or made 2. a person or thing that dramatically changes the course, strategy, character, etc., of something Noun [geym cheyn-jer] GAME CHANGER\n\n17. www.callcenterweek.com17 ANNOUNCING OUR HEADLINER KEYNOTE Chip Conley Founder, JOIE DE VIVRE HOTELS, Global Head of Hospitality Strategy, AIRBNB Best-Selling Author of Peak - How Great Companies Get Their Mojo from Maslow Founder and former CEO of Joie de Vivre (JDV), author, speaker.

Tony is applying his very successful Zappos corporate culture model (recognized multiple times by FORTUNE as one of the top 100 best places to work) to help build the most community-focused large city in the world in the place you would least expect it: Downtown Las Vegas. Research has shown that every time the size of a city doubles, productivity and innovation per resident increases by 15%, but when companies get bigger, productivity per employee generally goes down. With his new $350 million Downtown Project, Tony is creating a unique hybrid of corporation, community, and city to drive productivity and innovation both for Zappos as well as the city itself.
