The foundation performs acts of care and kindness through the following programs: Bear-Able Gifts (largest distributor of gifts to children with cancer in the U.S.); Toxic-Free Kids (educates families on the dangers of environmental toxins); New Era Cancer Research Fund (funds research for less toxic, minimally-invasive pediatric-cancer treatments); International Aid (provides medications and supplies to clinics in developing and impoverished countries); Helping Hands Fund (provides emergency financial assistance to families); and Camp Scholarships (allows children in remission to reconnect with activities they love). With a national pediatric-hospital partner network of 215+ locations, the foundation directly helps more than 15,000 children affected by cancer and their families every year.

Within our grasp is the opportunity to end 30 years of suffering and death due to HIV/AIDS. Individuals and communities around the world have been mobilized toward prevention, and existing treatment can prolong life for many years. While we celebrate these successes, we reject any modicum of complacency. Now is the time to double down and finish the job. The world is fighting AIDS today just as it had previously fought to eliminate smallpox. For centuries, smallpox was a feared scourge that killed nearly half of those infected and maimed those that survived. A worldwide campaign to end the disease began in earnest in the late 1960s and by 1980 smallpox was officially eradicated. Planet Aid anticipates the day when AIDS, too, will be stopped. To this end, we have been helping mobilize communities around the globe to increase HIV/AIDS prevention and care. With this special issue of the Planet Aid Post, we focus on the battle ahead. We also extend a warm welcome to those joining us on the forefront of this work,\n\nPlease Support The Chase After a Cure for Childhood Cancer\n\nPlease Support The Chase After a Cure for Childhood CancerGoing Places, Inc\n\nChase After a Cure (CAAC) was started in 2009 by Summerville, S.C., resident Whitney Ringler and her family after her son, Chase, was given a 30 percent chance of survival after being diagnosed with Stage 4 neuroblastoma, a cancer of the nerve tissue of the sympathetic nervous system. Chase survived this aggressive form of cancer and now his family works tirelessly on behalf of childhood cancer research. CAAC raises awareness about childhood cancer, specifically neuroblastoma, and funds childhood cancer research at the Medical University of South Carolina Children’s Hospital. Cancer is the No. 1 cause of disease-related death among children. About 13,500 children between birth and age 19 are diagnosed with cancer each year. Just at the Medical University of South Carolina, about 70 children are diagnosed with pediatric cancer annually. Compared to adult cancer, childhood cancers are rare. Even though childhood cancer incidence rates continue to increase slightly each year, they still represent less than 1 percent of all new cancer diagnoses. That means funding for childhood cancer research is limited. In particular, neuroblastoma – which has one of the lowest survival rates – receives very little attention because the population base with this form of cancer isn’t profitable enough for pharmaceutical companies to develop new treatments. While childhood cancer may impact a smaller population, it impacts the young lives of those diagnosed at 100 percent.

Hydrogen ions are nothing but protons which can bind to proteins and alter their characteristics. All the enzymes present in the body are proteins and an alteration in these enzyme systems can change the homeostatic mechanisms of the body. Hence, a disturbance in acid-base balance can result in malfunction of the various organ systems. The normal pH of blood is 7.35-7.45. Acidosis is defined as a pH Less than 7.35. Conversely, when the pH is more than 7.45, alkalosis is said to exist. Acidosis and alkalosis are of two types each: respiratory and metabolic. An increase in carbon dioxide (CO2 ) levels increases the plasma [H+ ] and decreases the pH (respiratory acidosis). Similarly, a decrease in plasma carbon dioxide levels reduces the [H+ ] and increases the pH (respiratory alkalosis). A decrease in [HC03 -] reduces the pH and is called metabolic acidosis. Similarly, an increase in [HC03 -] increases the pH and produces metabolic alkalosis. The pH is regulated in the human body mainly by two organs: the respiratory system and the renal system. The arterial carbon dioxide levels are regulated by the respiratory system. Any increase in carbon dioxide levels stimulates the respiratory centre in the medulla thus augmenting respiration, alveolar ventilation and elimination of extra CO2 levels. A decrease in CO2 levels may reduce the stimulus to breathe and cause hypoventilation. This response is limited by hypoxia as the hypoxic drive stimulates the patient to maintain respiration. Respiratory response to changes in CO2 level occurs very fast. The plasma bicarbonate levels are regulated by the kidneys. Any decrease in [HC03 -] stimulates the kidney to retain and synthesise bicarbonate. High [HC03 -] results in elimination of more bicarbonate in urine. In general, the pulmonary response to a change in acid-base status is faster and occurs immediately. However, renal regulation takes time, a few hours to days. Kidneys filter and reabsorb all the bicarbonate in the urine. When necessary, kidneys can also produce extra bicarbonate through the glutamine pathway. When an acid-base disorder occurs, the initial disturbance that occurs is termed the primary disorder. The body attempts to normaliZe the pH by certain compensatory mechanisms resulting in a secondary disorder, e.g. primary metabolic acidosis results in an increase in hydrogen ions and a consequent decrease in bicarbonate ions. To compensate for this, the patient hyperventilates and reduces the arterial carbon dioxide levels, thus moving the pH back to normal ( compensatory respiratory alkalosis )\n\nOsvaldo Bernardo Muchanga- MALE CIRCUMCISION, ITS Vs SOCIOCULTURAL BELIEFS (C...\n\nOsvaldo Bernardo Muchanga- MALE CIRCUMCISION, ITS Vs SOCIOCULTURAL BELIEFS (C...Osvaldo Bernardo Muchanga\n\nMALE CIRCUMCISION consists of the surgical act of removing the foreskin (skin that covers the glans of the penis), leaving the glans more prominent and better cleanable. MALE CIRCUMCISION itself has medical as well as sociocultural implications, as it has been proven to be an act that can minimize SEXUALLY TRANSMITTED INFECTIONS (STIs), especially HIV, but it also represents the SOCIOCULTURAL IDENTITY of some people, respectively. Now, in a SERO-EPIDEMIOLOGICAL PROFILE like that of Mozambique where the prevalence of HIV is around 12.5% which corresponds to approximately 2 million people living with HIV, where the province of GAZA is the most seroprevalent with a positivity rate of 21% (INSIDA, 2021), it is extremely necessary to THOROUGHLY scrutinize all possibilities for preventing or minimizing the spread of HIV and other STIs.\n\nKayakalp Clinic Best Sexologist of patna\n\nKayakalp Clinic Best Sexologist of patnaKayakalp Clinic - Best Sexologist In Patna\n\nकायाकल्प क्लिनिक: पटना के अग्रणी सेक्सोलॉजिस्ट और स्किन केयर विशेषज्ञ पटना का एक शानदार स्वास्थ्य सेवा प्रदाता, कायाकल्प क्लिनिक, आपके स्वास्थ्य और त्वचा की देखभाल में विशेषज्ञता प्रदान करता है। हमारे नवीनतम तकनीकी समाधानों और अनुभवी विशेषज्ञों के साथ, हम पुरुष और महिलाओं के स्वास्थ्य सम्बंधित मुद्दों को हल करते हैं। यहां पर हम प्रदान करते हैं: Expert Treatment for Sex Issues at Kaya Kalp Clinic in Patna -best sexologist in patna Dealing with sex-related problems?
