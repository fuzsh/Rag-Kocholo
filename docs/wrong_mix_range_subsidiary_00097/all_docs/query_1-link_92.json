The stockholders of Endocardial Solutions adopted a merger agreement whereby ESI became a wholly owned subsidiary of St. Jude. In conjunction with the completion of this transaction, St. Jude will record a special charge of approximately $11 million in the first quarter related to purchased in-process R&D."
