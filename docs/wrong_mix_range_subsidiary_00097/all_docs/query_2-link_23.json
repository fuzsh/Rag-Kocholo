        "text": "2. Establishment- When late entertainer Danny Thomas opened the doors to St. Jude Children’s Research Hospital in 1962, he was not just changing the lives of those children who would walk through its doors. He was changing lives across the world. Danny Thomas a struggling young entertainer with a baby on the way, visited a Detroit church and was so moved during the Mass, he placed his last $7 in the collection box. When he realized what he’d done, Danny Thomas prayed for a way to pay the looming hospital bills. The next day, he was offered a small part that would pay 10 times the amount he’d given to the church. Danny Thomas had experienced the power of prayer. Two years later, Danny Thomas had achieved moderate acting success in Detroit, but he was struggling to take his career to the next level. Once again, he turned to the church. Praying to St. Jude Thaddeus, the patron saint of hopeless causes, Danny Thomas asked the saint to “help me find my way in life, and I will build you a shrine.”\n\n3. St. Jude Children's Research Hospital 262 Danny Thomas Place, Memphis, TN 38105\n\n4. The mission of St. Jude Children’s Research Hospital is to advance cures, and means of prevention, for pediatric catastrophic diseases through research and treatment. Consistent with the vision of our founder Danny Thomas, no child is denied treatment based on race, religion or a family's ability to pay.\n\n5. The foremost responsibilities are to the children with catastrophic diseases, their families, and to the donors that have committed their personal resources toward the Mission. To fully meet these responsibilities, St. Jude is committed to an explicit set of values. These values are the standards of behavior that they use to guide their daily actions and decisions. They will ensure that these standards of behavior are adhered to through ongoing training of all personnel working at St. Jude, and by annually evaluating the executive leadership, faculty and staff in their adherence to these values.\n\n6. St. Jude’s vision is to be the world leader in advancing the treatment and prevention of catastrophic diseases in children. This vision will be pursued by providing outstanding patient care; by conducting basic, translational and clinical research designed to elucidate biological mechanisms, understand disease pathogenesis, improve diagnosis, enhance treatment outcome, prevent diseases and minimize adverse consequences of treatment; and by educating health care and scientific research professionals. Through these efforts they seek to cure and aggrandize the quality of life for an increasing proportion of children who come to them for treatment, and by expanding and sharing knowledge, to advance treatment of children with catastrophic diseases worldwide, while developing strategies to prevent catastrophic diseases in children.\n\n7. St. Jude is the only pediatric cancer research center where families never pay for treatment not covered by insurance. No child is ever denied treatment because of the family’s inability to pay.\n\n8. Benevolent and dedicated staff, Senior Team Management and Executive Committee. Research Resources - Well-equipped facilities staffed with highly trained specialists are widely available to clinical and basic science investigators to support the design, implementation, analysis, interpretation, and reporting of research.

Commitment to donors that every dollar donated will be wisely spent toward achieving the Mission of advancing cures, and means of prevention, for pediatric catastrophic disease through research and treatment. Disseminate knowledge on how to get involved in the process of getting rid of the plethora of illness.\n\n10. St. Jude recently completed an extensive expansion program that bolstered the hospital’s research and treatment efforts, more than doubling the size of its original campus. The expansion included the Children’s GMP, LLC, currently the nation’s only pediatric research center on-site facility for production of highly specialized treatments and vaccines; an expanded Department of Immunology; and a new Department of Chemical Biology and Therapeutics for discovery of new drugs. St. Jude now has 2.5 million square feet of research, clinical and administrative space dedicated to finding cures and saving children.\n\n11.
