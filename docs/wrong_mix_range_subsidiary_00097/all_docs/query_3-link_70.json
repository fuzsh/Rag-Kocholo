        "text": "Features\n\nFaculty, staff and students can access their email in a browser with Outlook on the web or a desktop or mobile email client\n\nFree Microsoft 365 software: All current students as well as eligible CU Boulder faculty and staff can download the latest versions of Microsoft 365 software, including Outlook, for free\n\nEmail and shared calendaring comes with up to 100GB of storage space, and message size up to 150MB\n\nGlobal address list including name, department and phone information for all faculty, staff and students\n\nAccommodates multiple personal calendars, group calendars, and resource calendars for scheduling of rooms, equipment, and more\n\nImproved anti-SPAM, anti-malware, and phishing protection with Microsoft Defender Quarantine\n\nLog in to email & Multi-Factor Authentication\n\nLog in to email in a browser: Go to https://outlook.office.com/mail/ to log in to Outlook on the web.\n\nConfigure email client: If you prefer to use the Outlook mail app, follow configuration tutorials for Windows computers, Mac computers, iOS, or Android.\n\nLogin credentials: When prompted to log in, use your IdentiKeyUsername@colorado.edu email address and IdentiKey password.\n\nPlease note: Only IdentiKeyUsername@colorado.edu will work for logging in to Microsoft 365 applications, not the common preferred email send address format of first.last@colorado.edu (shown below).\n\nMicrosoft Multi-factor authentication: CU Boulder faculty, students, and staff are required to log in to Microsoft 365 using Multi-factor authentication (MFA). MFA increases account security by requiring multiple forms of verification to prove your identity when signing into an application. Visit OIT's MFA page for more information, set up instructions, and frequently asked questions. You should only have to do this when first logging in on a new device for Microsoft applications.\n\nOutlook on the Web\n\nMicrosoft offers a web browser-based email and calendaring client through the university's Microsoft 365 subscription called Outlook on the web. If you have previous experience using a browser-based email program like Gmail, Outlook on the Web is the most similar experience. For users new to Outlook, we recommend visiting Microsoft's Getting Started guide for basic instructions.\n\nVisit the Outlook on the web page for the full list of Email and Calendaring tutorials compiled by OIT for campus users.\n\nBest Practices\n\nOIT has put together Best Practices for those that use the delegation feature to manage their calendar in Outlook. Visit the Calendaring Best Practices page for more.\n\nOutlook for Windows, Mac or Mobile\n\nOIT recommends that users who would like to use a mail client choose Outlook on their desktop and/or mobile device. Refer to the following tutorials to help set up your email client:\n\nOther Email Clients\n\nYou may also use other email clients that support Microsoft's \"Modern Authentication\" technology. When you log into a client that supports Modern Authentication, you should be directed to a Microsoft 365 login page to enter credentials; you should not be asked to save those in the client itself.\n\nOlder clients may not support Modern Authentication and will not be able to connect; for more information on this change, please refer to Microsoft's Improving Security statement.\n\nEmail Client Standards\n\nMicrosoft Outlook/Exchange Online is the default email and calendaring solution for all CU Boulder faculty, staff and students. OIT highly recommends the use of either the Outlook desktop or mobile application or Outlook Web Access for email and calendaring on macOS/iOS. OIT has provided documentation to configure the Apple Mail client for Exchange, but cannot support the application past this initial configuration because the vendor does not consistently adhere to Microsoft's standards. In addition, OIT does not have the means or access to receive escalated support from the vendor.\n\nWarning: If you have delegates assigned to your inbox or calendar, or you are a delegate of someone elseâ€™s inbox or calendar you must use a Microsoft Outlook client or application. Using the Apple Mail app in this manner can result in mailbox and calendaring corruption for both you and the delegate.\n\nDelivery Location"
