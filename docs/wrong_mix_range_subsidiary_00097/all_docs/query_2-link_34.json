        "text": "Driven by the mission of advancing cures for pediatric catastrophic diseases, St. Jude Children’s Research Hospital unites the brightest minds in science and medicine with world-class resources. The knowledge generated by the groundbreaking research at St. Jude is translated directly into clinical progress, improving outcomes for patients. The annual scientific report—Translating Science Into Survival—spotlights key breakthroughs from the last year highlighted by work that accelerates scientific discovery. We dive deep into four features: using CRISPR gene editing, understanding and preventing infectious diseases, how protein structure guides therapeutics, and the molecular make up of brain tumors. “In our 62-year history, we have made tremendous progress in curing the incurable, treating the untreatable, decreasing the side effects of therapy, and accelerating the adoption of diagnostic and therapeutic approaches globally to improve cure rates,” said James R. Downing, MD, President and CEO. “The work described in the Scientific Report underscores the unique scientific culture at St. Jude and illustrates how it drives our faculty and staff to tackle the most challenging problems and answer the most complex questions.” To learn about the ways St. Jude continues to change the future of research and treatment, read the 2024 Scientific Report. https://ow.ly/Bhrg50SHrCR\n\nWhile pediatric cancer survival rates in the U.S. now exceed 85%, the global five-year survival rate is less than 20%. Complications from infectious diseases cause more than half of all pediatric cancer deaths worldwide. “The crux of the issue is that there are not enough infectious diseases specialists in all of these settings,” said Sergio Licona, MD, MBA, coordinator of the St. Jude Infectious Diseases Transversal program, which is dedicated to developing expertise worldwide to overcome infectious disease challenges. “So, we need creative ideas on how to address the need and scale them up.” The program addresses the gap in infectious disease specialty care in two ways: training and community-building. Training includes such as courses on infection prevention and control for infection preventionists and leadership in infectious diseases for physicians caring for infections. This intensive training is delivered yearly by collaborative institutions that are close to home to encourage local participation and spread knowledge. Since many hospitals lack dedicated infectious diseases specialists, training even one provider can have a major impact. For community building, the program is developing the Global Infectious Diseases (ID) Network, which keeps people in contact with St. Jude and each other after completing the training program. As problems in resource-limited settings are different from those in wealthier countries, such a peer network can be an invaluable source of practical information. “Decreasing infection risk and impact is the first step to provide safe cancer care. Our focus is to create effective, sustainable, scalable processes that reduce the incidence and impact of infectious diseases and childhood catastrophic diseases, especially in underserved areas.” Explained Miguela Caniza, MD, MPH, Infectious Diseases Transversal Program director, St. Jude Global and St. Jude Departments of Global Pediatric Medicine and Infectious Diseases member.

The Biohackathon offers the chance for participants to collaborate with peers and explore a field outside of their normal expertise. You will meet with over 200 computational experts in bioinformatics, biostatistics, imaging, data science and software engineering that will offer their expertise to solve some of the institution’s greatest questions and challenges. One former participant said of their experience, “I was trusted with a vital contribution and, having faith in my team, I trusted their guidance when it seemed I would fail. They pulled me through, and we had a pleasant result. I needed that experience.” Don’t miss this chance to innovate, learn and collaborate at the BioHackathon at St. Jude. https://ow.ly/cycm50SEv12\n\nInspired by her own core values and gratitude for their service, Sarah Currie leads over 800 nurses and advanced practitioners working to fulfill the mission of St. Jude. Currie has spent her whole life helping the most vulnerable – from fixing broken bird wings as a child to delivering and inspiring holistic bedside care for pediatric patients. After completing her training at the Kent School of Nursing, she found her purpose working in neonatal intensive care units (NICU) on both sides of the pond. “I have always thought of nursing as an art and a privilege. To meet patients where they are, and render aid and comfort to help them manage whatever life transition is ahead of them.” As Chief Nurse at St. Jude, Currie is responsible for setting and executing the vision for nursing care across clinical areas of the hospital. The lifetimes of experience collectively shared by her team members are driven by a philosophy of care defined by excellence, hope, passion, and dignity. “I cannot think of any other way I would rather spend my days than working with our wonderful team, pursuing the inspirational mission of St. Jude Children’s Research Hospital.” Learn more about how Sarah Currie is inspiring and leading the next generation of nurses in the latest investigator Insights on St. Jude Progress. https://ow.ly/6ta550SAysO\n\nResearch shows that pediatric patients genetically prone to cancer benefit from early surveillance. A compelling case is raised to advocate for early and regular surveillance in children with genetic predispositions to cancer in a study recently published in JAMA Oncology, Kim Nichols, MD, St. Jude Division of Cancer Predisposition director, Department of Oncology, with colleagues Alise Blake and Melissa Perrino. Nichols provides a deeper look into the importance of early tumor detection for achieving the best outcomes in young patients. The study discovered that early intervention often detects asymptomatic, early-stage tumors, sometimes even during the initial testing phase or within two years of starting surveillance. This is significant because early-stage tumors are typically more treatable and can be completely removed through surgery, improving the chances of successful outcomes. The research supports the effectiveness of current screening methods and recommends that healthcare providers should begin surveillance immediately upon identifying a cancer-predisposing syndrome, without waiting for patients to complete therapy for prior cancers. This approach could appreciably improve early detection and treatment success. The implications of this study extend beyond clinical practice. It can be challenging for providers to get insurances companies to pay for early screenings. This study may be the start to providing insurance companies with the evidence needed to cover the tests for children with a predisposition, to ensure that these vital screenings are accessible for families who need them. Nichols looks forward to including a wider range of patients in this study and exploring the psychological impacts of surveillance.

This is particularly true for antiviral therapy for HIV. The newest generation of HIV therapy focuses on long-acting injectable medication, which provides a treatment regimen that is easier for patients to stick with. St. Jude is at the forefront of clinical research to bring these treatments to children and young adults. St. Jude has a long history of working with the National Institutes of Health (NIH)-funded International Maternal Pediatric Adolescent AIDS Clinical Trials (IMPAACT) Network. Aditya Gaur, MD, St. Jude Division of HIV Medicine director co-led the IMPAACT 2017 study, whose primary goal was to determine the safety of these medicines and drug exposure in adolescents aged 12 to 18. Results from the Phase 1/2 clinical trial show that a long-acting, injectable treatment regimen is safe for use in this age group. “A few decades from now, we will reflect and say this was another milestone in how we addressed the management of HIV,” said Aditya Gaur, MD, St. Jude Division of HIV Medicine director. “Long-acting HIV treatment adds yet another treatment option for people living with HIV.” Findings from the first study cohort, published in The Lancet HIV, showed no serious adverse effects in these patients. These interim findings informed the approval of this combination of long-acting medications for adolescents by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and Canada Health. “At an individual level,” Gaur concluded. “It’s most rewarding to hear the testimonies of the adolescents who shared what it meant for them not to have to take daily oral medications and to experience some relief from the feeling of stigma.” Learn more about the study on Progress: https://ow.ly/E20x50StLI7\n\nCongratulations to Pat Keel, EVP-Chief Administrative and Financial Officer, for being honored on the Becker’s Healthcare 2024 “CFOs to know” list.
