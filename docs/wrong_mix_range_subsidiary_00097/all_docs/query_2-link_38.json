        "text": "Story\n\nIn 2017, Alexis received the devastating diagnosis of a metastatic brain tumor. Initially, she was treated at our local children’s hospital, but due to the rarity and aggressive nature of the disease, her care was transferred to St. Jude Children’s Hospital for specialized treatment. Over the course of nearly 3 years, Alexis’s cancer journey involved radiation, inpatient and outpatient chemotherapy, physical therapy, and countless tests and scans to monitor her condition. Tragically, Alexis passed away in October 2019.\n\nTo know Alexis was to love her. She radiated brightness, humor, creativity, and had an enormous heart. Her impact extended beyond our family—she left an indelible mark on everyone who crossed her path, including the dedicated doctors, nurses, therapists, and fellow St. Jude families. As the harsh reality settled in, Alexis confided in April and I about her aspirations. She wanted to help other children on similar cancer journeys and give back to the medical team that had inspired her.\n\nFor April and I, fulfilling Alexis’s wish is more than a parental duty; it’s a profound commitment. Just as her birth challenged us as new parents, learning to navigate life without her has been our most arduous daily struggle. Our deepest hope is that no parent should ever have to face a world without their child. This unwavering belief fuels our ongoing support for St. Jude’s Children’s Research Hospital. Their mission—to discover cures and save lives—drives us forward.\n\nChildhood cancer is unlike any other disease. It inflicts devastating blows, evokes fear, and leaves families reeling. Yet, amidst the nausea, pain, hair loss, and exhaustion of treatment, there shines an incredible amount of love and hope. The same hope and love that Alexis, April, and I experienced continue to sustain us today. And now, we strive to extend that same beacon of hope to others on a similar journey.\n\nThis October, on the 5th anniversary of Alexis’s passing, I am embarking on a personal challenge: to climb Mount Kilimanjaro while raising funds for St. Jude’s Children’s Research Hospital. I invite you to join me in this endeavor and help me achieve my goal. The love and hope that was extended to our family during our difficult times now inspire me to give back. St. Jude’s is an incredible institution where 82 cents of every dollar donated directly supports critical services for children and their families. These services include treatment, housing, food, and travel assistance. By contributing, you’ll not only help me reach my goal but also provide hope to parents facing similar challenges. Knowing that there are compassionate individuals out there supporting their families and, most importantly, their children, can make all the difference. Let’s come together and make a positive impact. Your support matters, and together, we can make a difference in the lives of these brave children and their families."
