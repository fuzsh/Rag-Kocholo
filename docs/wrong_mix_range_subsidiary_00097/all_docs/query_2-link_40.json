        "text": "How to work with the Catholic Saint San Judas Tadeo\n\nBefore beginning to work with any Saint or Deity you must first know the background of the energy you are invoking. This is not intended to exhaustive, comprehensive, or to be your only source, however, it should be sufficient to get you acquainted and familiar with the energy.\n\nWho is San Judas?\n\nSan Judas Thaddeus is one of the 12 Apostles to serve with Our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ. They were close relatives, which is why they have similar facial features. Typical imagery of St. Jude often includes a flame above his head, which represents his presence at Pentecost, when he accepted the Holy Spirit alongside the other apostles.\n\nWhat is Saint Jude known for and What does San Judas Tadeo do?\n\nFor many years, he was confused with Judas Iscariot, who betrayed Our Lord and as a direct result of such confusion Judas Thaddeus was falsely despaired because of Judas Iscariot's great sin. When San Judas was finally petitioned for help he was beyond eager to show his gratitude and came through for his petitioners in impossible ways.\n\nWhich has made San Judas Tadeo known as the patron saint of impossible causes. He is also the ruler of the threshold (emotional, mental, volatile aspects) and as such can makes him an excellent deity to be called upon as a guide through difficulties.\n\nWhy is St. Jude the saint of lost causes\n\nThe story goes that Saint Bridget of Sweden, the patroness of Europe, wrote that Jesus advised her to turn to Saint Jude Thaddeus for favors that seemed hard to fulfill. This is how he became the patron saint of impossible causes.\n\nHis popularity as a saint in Mexico rose during the 1980s. San Judas' notoriety is unrivaled only that of La Virgen de Guadalupe & the folk saint La Santa Muerte can compete with the love that the Mexican people have for San Juditas.\n\nIs San Judas Tadeo a Narco Saint?\n\nOver time the term \"lost causes\" became loosely interpreted by the people to mean society's rejects (personas pérdidas al camino de dios ) such as criminals, drug dealers, thieves, etc.\n\nIn 2008 the Archdiocese of Mexico City released a statement concerning the unorthodox practices of those seeking his assistance in ways that are against christian morals. Stating that the people copied his image from those depicted in Italy and changed his staff from his right side to his left side.\n\nIn Catholicism the left hand is considered to be symbolic of evil. Within Western esotericism, the left-hand path and the right-hand path stand as contrasting methodologies in the realm of magic. In certain interpretations, the left-hand path aligns with malevolent black magic, while the right-hand path aligns with benevolent white magic.\n\nTherefore, some believe that when St. Jude is represented with the staff in his left hand, he is open to prayers and petitions (mischievous) that he would never consider with the staff at his right because it is not within the morals of the Catholic church.\n\nSan Judas carries a staff or sometimes an axe, symbolizing his martyrdom when his head was tragically severed. However, many interpret his staff as a sign of his readiness to take decisive action for his faithful followers. Within the diverse devotees of Mexico and in the United States, encompassing delinquents, addicts, thieves, and an array of individuals on the fringe of society, San Judas has been embraced and believed to extend his protection to even those deemed most unworthy. It's a belief that he shields even the most marginalized thieves, ensuring them a shielded path through adversity or the grasp of the law.\n\nSaint Jude can be effectively petitioned for help with hopeless cases, to help someone get off drugs, to help criminals stay out of jail and, help someone get out of jail among many others.\n\nThe archdiocese commemorates the feast day of Saint Jude while emphatically asserting that Judas Thaddaeus is not a patron of delinquency or drug trafficking, and bears no association with Santa Muerte in any manner.\n\nUnveiling the Hidden Realities of San Judas Tadeo...\n\nWhile the church has not officially confirmed this, there is a belief that they embrace the veneration of San Judas as a means to engage younger generations and counter the veneration of La Santa. The archdiocese not only celebrates the saint's day but also emphasizes that Judas Thaddaeus is not a patron associated with delinquency, drug trafficking, or any connection to Santa Muerte.\n\nAccording to a researcher at UNAM, it's believed that the Church employs this form of veneration as a way to counter the reverence given to Santa Muerte.\n\nSan Judas Tadeo's exceptional ability to fulfill petitions of great significance and his gentle nature make seeking his guidance a preferred choice over that of La Santa Muerte. San Judas willingly extends his help to those who might be marginalized by society and to those whose actions might challenge traditional church morals.\n\nFurthermore, he possesses the ability to grant seemingly impossible requests, a realm for which Santa Muerte is also invoked. San Judas embodies a much more compassionate deity compared to La Santa, who can exhibit a more intense and vengeful disposition when provoked (given her embodiment of death itself). She does not take kindly to empty promises and unfulfilled commitments.\n\nWhy is San Judas the Saint of Money Problems?\n\nThe profound fervor for this saint in Mexico and among Mexican-American's remains an enigma, yet some attribute it to his remarkable appearance. Adorned with a golden medallion gracing his neck, depicting the face of Christ, many of his devotees interpret it as a symbol that of a gold coin, turning to him as the patron saint to seek solace in matters of monetary and financial hardship.\n\nWhat Candle Colors Should Be Offered to San Judas\n\nWhen petitioning a saint is is best to know the colors associated with each saint to best help you invoke their energy.\n\nThe candle colors that you may offer St. Jude should be green, white, and red, seven colors, and or pink and green.\n\nWhat does the Color of the San Judas Tadeo Candle mean, and what color should the candle be for the Just Judge?\n\nThe color of the San Judas candle plays a significant role. The choice of color may vary depending on the specific intention of the petition.\n\nFor example:\n\nRed San Judas Candle: Symbolizing energy, strength, passion, physical health, love, personal relationships, and understanding with others. It is used to seek protection against enemies and ill-intentioned individuals.\n\nWhite Just Judge Candle: Used to invoke divine help in legal and judicial situations.

It is believed that the San Judas listens to the petitions of those who use this candle, guiding them towards fair and equitable solutions in work-related matters.\n\nPink and Green San Judas Candle: Use to assist you in gaining employment.\n\nSeven color candle: The seven-color candle is a candle that has seven layers of different colors, each with a special meaning.

Using the San Judas candle with faith and devotion will enhance the likelihood of achieving the best results.\n\nWhat is the meaning of each candle color?\n\nMeaning of each candle color: Below, we explain the meaning of each layer of the seven-color candle:\n\nRed: Represents the passion and energy necessary to achieve our goals.\n\nOrange: Symbolizes creativity and joy, as well as material prosperity.\n\nYellow: Represents wisdom and intelligence, as well as light and mental clarity.\n\nGreen: Symbolizes nature and harmony, as well as personal and spiritual growth.\n\nBlue: Represents tranquility and inner peace, as well as communication and the expression of our feelings.\n\nIndigo: Symbolizes intuition and extrasensory perception, as well as a connection with the divine.\n\nViolet: Represents transmutation and transformation, as well as the development of spirituality.\n\nWhen is San Judas Tadeo's Feast Day\n\nHis Feast day (sort of like a birthday) is October 28th and his day of the week is Sunday, which is the day of the week that is ruled by the Sun.\n\nWhat are San Judas Tadeo offerings\n\nHe is a simple saint that does not need much outside of being publicly thanked for his help.
