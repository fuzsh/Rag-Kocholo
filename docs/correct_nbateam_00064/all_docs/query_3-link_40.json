        "text": "Gloria Govan, former Basketball Wives star and wife of former NBA player Derek Fisher, has been sued by Silver Leaf Events and her company RLNTLSS Brands for alleged unpaid bills related to her cannabis business.\n\nThe lawsuit accuses the defendants of breach of contract, fraud, intentional misrepresentation, and conspiracy to engage in unfair business practices.\n\nSilver Leaf Events, owned by Amanda Tingler, was introduced to Govan in January 2023 and proposed to help with a video project for her cannabis business.\n\nGovan agreed to move forward with the proposal and requested an official contract. Silver Leaf sent over the contract in April 2023, requiring Govan to pay $15,000.\n\nHowever, the company claims Govan never did and received a run-around for weeks.\n\nThe company expressed concerns about payment and claims that Govan continued to make promises of payment but never followed through.\n\nThe suit in full\n\n\"[Silver Leaf] worked on the project through the end of April while regularly collaborating with GLORIA GOVAN and getting things ready with the brands and production team for filming,\" the suit said.\n\n\"[Silver Leaf] filmed the content for the project, as directed by GLORIA GOVAN, on April 19, 2023.\n\n\"That morning, prior to filming, [Silver Leaf] sent GLORIA GOVAN a text message reminding her to sign the contract and to please send payment immediately.\n\n\"GLORIA GOVAN messaged [Silver Leaf] back saying that she was going to send money on Zelle for $7500.00 of the amount that was owed for production of the first episode.\n\n\"Again, Defendants sent no payment for this amount to [Silver Leaf].\n\n\"GLORIA GOVAN then stated that she could only send $1,000.00, but she would send more in \"installments\" as they moved forward with the project.\n\n\"[Silver Leaf] reasonably believes that Defendants manipulated Ms. Tingler and forced them to take on costs related to their business with no intention of paying for the work performed or the production costs.\""
