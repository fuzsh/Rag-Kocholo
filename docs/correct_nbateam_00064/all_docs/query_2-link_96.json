        "text": "When Dennis Rodman found out that Derek Fisher was chasing a potential NBA comeback, he thought one thing: “He needs the limelight, right?”\n\nThe 42-year-old Fisher posted workout footage last week, which didn’t exactly inspire NBA GMs to pick up their phones.\n\nRodman, who played with Fisher during the lockout-shortened 1998-99 season, did not mince words to TMZ about his former teammate.\n\n“Just give it up man,” Rodman said. “Just do your job as a family guy. As a Christian guy, you always say it, ‘Do your job.’ Take care of your shit.”"
