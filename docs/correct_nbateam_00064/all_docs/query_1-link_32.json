        "text": "Derek Fisher, who recently completed his 18th NBA season as a player, was officially introduced as the coach of the New York Knicks Tuesday.\n\nFisher just retired from the Oklahoma City Thunder after a run to the Western Conference finals. He finished his career with 11,000 points and five championships. He won the titles with Knicks president Phil Jackson, as a member of the Los Angeles Lakers.\n\n\"I like the fact that he is current with the players,\" Jackson said. \"This is a generation that is little bit different than the one I grew up with. Guys that were listening to Grateful Dead are not doing that anymore. Derek has kind of gotten into that beat.\"\n\nFisher's deal, worth a reported $25 million over five years mirrors that given to Steve Kerr by the Golden State Warriors. Kerr had been on the Knicks radar until his deal was announced on May 20.\n\nFisher has no coaching experience. The Brooklyn Nets hired Jason Kidd last season under similar circumstances. Kidd retired after a 19-year playing career and after a slow start, led Brooklyn to the Eastern Conference semifinals.\n\n\"I have not been a head coach in the NBA or college or high school, but I am experienced,\" Fisher said. \"Basketball is a game that I am experienced in playing, understanding, leading in, guiding in, helping another group of people achieve the greatest gift in the world as a professional athlete and that's being a champion. That I have experience in. And that is the experience that I plan on sharing with these players.\"\n\nFisher was the president of the National Basketball Players Association from 2006-13.\n\nAmong the main reasons Jackson tabbed Fisher is because of his familiarity with the triangle offense, the strategy taught by long time Jackson assistant Tex Winter. Winter and Jackson combined to win nine NBA titles, six with the Chicago Bulls and three with the Lakers.\n\n\"It's one (triangle offense) I am well versed in,\" Fisher said. \"I love the triangle system. I believe with the roster we have, we can utilize it to be more efficient; more effective.\"\n\nFisher also played in a league record 259 career playoff games, and forged a reputation as a great communicator.\n\nLast week Charley Rosen, who served as an assistant coach under Jackson with the CBA's Albany Patroons, and co-authored More Than a Game with Jackson, told USA TODAY Sports, \"When he (Fisher) first came to the Lakers he was the only person who could relate to Kobe Bryant.\"\n\nThe Knicks are now hoping he can ply those skills towards forging a positive bond with free agent Carmelo Anthony.\n\nAfter being spurned by Kerr, Jackson seemed keenly focused on landing Fisher. So much so he was fined $25,000 by the league for tampering with the then Oklahoma City Thunder guard.\n\nOther names which surfaced included Mark Jackson, Fred Hoiberg, Jim Cleamons, Bill Cartwright, and Kurt Rambis. Rambis and Cartwright still may land on New York's bench, as assistants.\n\nFisher inherits a team which finished 37-45 last season, and with a roster in need of a complete overhaul.\n\n\"I am not as down on the roster and the team as some of you in the room are,\" Fisher said. \"I think there are some things that we can do with this team that can be special right now, not years from now.\""
