        "text": "GREENBURGH – It probably won't be the last time Phil Jackson unveils a backup plan.\n\nThere wasn't a single awkward moment Tuesday as the Knicks president officially introduced Derek Fisher — who is the 26th head coach in franchise history, at the MSG Training Facility. And the clear second choice made a good first impression, showing off the savvy that made the 39-year-old a popular leader on the court and in the locker room over 18 NBA seasons.\n\nYes, the lack of experience did come up a number of times, but this is a role he started rehearsing for long before Jackson made a job offer.\n\n\"I have rarely been the best player, the most talented, the highest jumper, the best shooter on a basketball team,\" Fisher said. \"So right away, as a young person, I immediately had to start thinking about the game of basketball and how it was played. Where I could find my advantages. How I could be most effective, even though I wasn't the most gifted or talented.\n\n\"The only reason that I've been around for 18 years is that I've thought the game as a coach.\"\n\nJackson went looking for a disciple with fresh legs who firmly believes in the old-school principals of system basketball. Steve Kerr was the obvious choice. And when he turned Jackson down in order to stay in California and take over a Golden State Warriors team that is ready to contend, Fisher was next on the list of likely candidates.\n\nTerms of the deal were not disclosed, but according to Yahoo! Sports, he will get $25 million over the next five years.\n\n\"I like the fact that he is current with the players,\" Jackson said with a grin. \"This is a generation that is little bit different than the one I grew up with. Guys that were listening to the Grateful Dead are not doing that anymore. Derek has kind of gotten into that beat. And he's hip-hop ready to get going with these guys and their language.\"\n\nJackson and Fisher were part of five NBA titles in Los Angeles with the Lakers.\n\nThe Knicks went 37-45 this past season, missing the playoffs just a year after winning the Atlantic Division. Jackson was introduced as team president by owner James Dolan on March 18, and quickly pulled the chair out from under Mike Woodson.\n\n\"I have not been a head coach in the NBA, or college, or high school, but I am experienced,\" said Fisher, who's played in more NBA playoff games than anyone in NBA history. \"Basketball is a game that I am experienced in playing, understanding, leading in, guiding in, helping another group of people achieve the greatest gift in the world as a professional athlete and that's being a champion. That, I have experience in.\"\n\nIt remains to be seen whether all of the championship pedigree will help convince the only marquee name on the roster, Carmelo Anthony, to stick around past the end of the month.\n\n\"(We) plan to meet with Carmelo and his people in the near future,\" Jackson said. \"And we want to express to him, again, our desire to have him back on the team.\""
