        "text": "The Los Angeles Sparks announced on Tuesday that they have dismissed head coach and general manager Derek Fisher.\n\nAssistant coach Fred Williams will take over on the bench as interim head coach while the team engages in a search for a new general manager.\n\nFisher joined the franchise as head coach in 2018. The Sparks named him general manager in 2020. He worked in both roles prior to his departure on Monday. He addressed his departure in a joint statement alongside the Sparks.\n\nThe Sparks are off to a 4-7 start, good for fourth place out of six teams in the Western Conference. They went 54-46 during Fisher's head coaching tenure and made the playoffs twice, while winning just one postseason game.\n\nFisher played 18 NBA seasons from 1996-2014, winning five championships with the Los Angeles Lakers. After retiring, he spent two seasons as head coach of the New York Knicks from 2014-16 before his firing midway through his second season and return to Los Angeles to take over the Sparks."
