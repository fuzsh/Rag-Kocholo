        "text": "? Jason Richardson scored 30 points and Derek Fisher had 21, including five 3-pointers, to lead the Golden State Warriors to a 117-110 victory over the Seattle SuperSonics on Wednesday night.\n\nDale Davis had a season-high 16 points and 10 rebounds off the bench for Golden State, which ended a three-game losing streak. Speedy Claxton added 17 points for the Warriors.\n\nThe Sonics lost their second straight home game, but still finished with a 10 1/2-game lead in the Northwest Division at the All-Star break at 35-16. The Warriors have a 15-38 record going into the All-Star break that included losing streaks of nine, six and six games.\n\nSeattle was led by its two All-Stars, Ray Allen and Rashard Lewis, with 26 and 17 points, respectively. But Allen had only four points in the second half on 2-for-8 shooting.\n\nWith 37 points — 14 by Richardson, and including seven 3-pointers — the Warriors tied their highest scoring quarter of the season in the third period. An alley-oop dunk by Davis on a pass from Claxton with 3:11 gone in the period gave the Warriors a 65-62 lead and ignited the team’s bench.\n\nGolden State led by as many as 12 points in the quarter, and was ahead 89-79 at the end of the third period.\n\nIn the final quarter, the Warriors stayed in front of the Sonics, who climbed to within 110-106 on a 3-pointer by Antonio Daniels with 44.6 seconds left. Richardson hit a 12-footer with 24.4 seconds to go to put Golden State ahead 112-106.\n\nThe Sonics held a 58-52 lead in the first half and led by as many as 12 points.\n\nNotes: The Sonics did not have forward Danny Fortson for the third straight game. Fortson, a key bench player for Seattle, missed the game because he flew to Pittsburgh to be with his ill grandmother. He was scheduled to return against Golden State after a two-game suspension for throwing a chair against Sacramento last Thursday night."
