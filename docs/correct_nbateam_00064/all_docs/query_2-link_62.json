        "text": "“He wants to win, wants to be successful,” Fisher told reporters of Anthony. “The time I had the visit with him I just shared with him we’ll be a better basketball team because we’ll play the game a better way, play as a team, play with a system and format to allow the game to be easier for him for him and his teammates.\n\n“I’m not sure if it hit home,” Fisher added. “I guess we’ll find out. Hopefully we’ll find out soon.”\n\nA source with knowledge of Anthony’s thinking said late Monday night that no team has been ruled out and that the decision remained “up in the air.”"
