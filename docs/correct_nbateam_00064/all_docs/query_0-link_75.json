        "text": "Fisher, who had no comment on the wreck when reached by ESPN, won five titles as a point guard for the Lakers and also played for the Golden State Warriors, Utah Jazz, Dallas Mavericks and Oklahoma City Thunder. He served as president of the NBA Players Association during his career, which endured a rocky last couple years, including an attempted forced resignation, before his term ended in 2013. He was also fired by his mentor, Phil Jackson, as coach of the Knicks in February 2016.\n\nPerhaps most famously, Fisher feuded with Matt Barnes, the then-husband of Govan and his former Lakers teammate, in a physical dispute that ended with Barnes, then playing for Memphis, suspended for two games.\n\nFisher and Govan reportedly have been dating since October 2015."
