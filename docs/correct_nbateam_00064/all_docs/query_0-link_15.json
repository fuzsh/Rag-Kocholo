        "text": "For the last week, current and former NBA stars have been weighing in on who would win the hypothetical matchup between these current Golden State Warriors and the early 2000s Los Angeles Lakers.\n\nIf you’ll recall, the 2000-2002 Lakers were the last teams to win three consecutive NBA titles, something that the Warriors are trying to accomplish this year.\n\nThe crux of the debate essentially boils down to the age-old unstoppable force versus immovable object debate. Shaquille O’Neal was one of the most unstoppable offensive weapons in NBA history and the Warriors of today have never had to consistently double and triple team someone like this. The Warriors shooting could potentially counter-balance any kind of damage O’Neal could bring as the Lakers never dealt with a team that was as deadly from the perimeter during any of their runs.\n\nWho would win, no one knows, but everyone has an opinion. Ex-Lakers guard Derek Fisher said that there are legit arguments for both sides (the conversation begins around the 3-minute mark).\n\nFisher says that there is no way that the Warriors would be able to defend a prime Shaq, pointing out that he essentially demolished both Tim Duncan and David Robinson in a 4-game Lakers sweep. But he did say that those Lakers teams would not be able to run up and down the court with these Warriors, and if the game was played under today’s rules, the Warriors would absolutely win.\n\nThis is the easy way out, but at least, unlike some other stars, Fisher does recognize that this Warriors team is unique and could probably go toe-to-toe with pretty much any team in the history of the league with their shooting and nearly unmatched talent."
