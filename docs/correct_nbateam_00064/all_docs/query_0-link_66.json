        "text": "SHERMAN OAKS — Former Los Angeles Laker and ex-New York Knicks head coach Derek Fisher was arrested on suspicion of drunken driving after his vehicle overturned Sunday on Highway 101.\n\nFisher’s lone passenger, Gloria Govan, escaped injury; she is the ex-wife of Golden State Warrior Matt Barnes and a former star of the “Basketball Wives” reality TV show.\n\nThe crash took place a little after 3 a.m. on the westbound freeway, approaching the Interstate 405 interchange. Fisher, 42, was driving a 2015 Cadillac, the California Highway Patrol reported.\n\nFisher was driving in the number four lane, approaching the 405 interchange, when he allowed the vehicle to veer right and onto the paved right shoulder, the CHP said. The Cadillac continued across the right shoulder and hit the raised concrete curb and wood/metal guardrail, on the shoulder.\n\nThe impact caused the vehicle to overturn, and it came to rest on its roof, blocking two lanes.\n\nFisher and Govan, 32, were helped out of the vehicle and they both reported no injuries.\n\nDuring the investigation, officers discovered that Fisher had been drinking, the CHP said. He was arrested without incident on suspicion of driving under the influence of alcohol.\n\nFisher, a resident of Tarzana, was the Knicks coach from 2014-2016 and played 18 years in the National Basketball Association. He spent a majority of his career with the Lakers and was an integral part of five NBA championships with the team.\n\nGovan, also a resident of Tarzana, was once married to current Golden State Warrior and former UCLA Bruin forward Matt Barnes. 37, from 2013 to 2016. They had twin boys that were born in 2008.\n\nFisher and Govan had been dating as far as October 2015, when Fisher, at 6-foot, 1-inches tall and Barnes, at 6-foot, 7-inches tall, had allegedly got into some form of an altercation at Govan’s home on Oct. 3, 2015, the New York Post and US magazine reported.\n\nFisher and Barnes had been Laker teammates for two seasons, from 2010 to 2012."
