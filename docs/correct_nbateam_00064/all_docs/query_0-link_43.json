        "text": "The Utah Jazz are more focused on finishing than retaliation. Utah's 115-101 win over the Golden State Warriors on Sunday night turned ugly as the Jazz pulled away at the end. One flagrant foul and a collision between the two team leaders set up some tension for today's Game 5 in Utah. But there is enouh riding on the game that could put Utah in the Western Conference finals and end the Warriors' playoff run that neither team was dwelling on what happened Sunday at Golden State.\n\n\"The fans here in Salt Lake City, the fans in Oakland have seen great games, great competition,\" said Utah guard Derek Fisher, who crashed hard to the floor after running into Baron Davis well away from the ball late in the game Sunday. \"There's no sense messing that up by doing things that are out of character.\"\n\nAt Monday's practice, Fisher had no visible marks or hard feelings against Davis, his former teammate in Golden State.\n\nAnd any ill-will between Mehmet Okur and Golden State's Jason Richardson, who was kicked out of the game with 37 seconds left for clotheslining Okur to keep him from an easy dunk, had also faded.\n\nUtah leads the series 3-1 and can clinch it today at home, where the Jazz are 5-0 in the playoffs. So revenge won't be part of the game plan. Golden State, meanwhile, will be playing just to extend the series to Game 6 back in Oakland and aren't likely to be losing their cool again with the season on the line.\n\n\"They haven't hard-fouled us, and I'm not going to hard-foul them,\" Golden State coach Don Nelson said.\n\nRaptors' Colangelo Honored\n\nNEW YORK - Bryan Colangelo, the Toronto Raptors' president and general manager, was chosen as the NBA's Executive of the Year for the second time Monday.\n\nColangelo received 20 votes to nine for Houston Rockets general manager Carroll Dawson, who finished second in the voting of 45 league executives. Colangelo also won the award in 2004-05 with the Phoenix Suns, and his father, Jerry, won the award four times.\n\nSECOND ROUND (Best of 7) Sunday Chicago 102, Detroit 87 (Detroit leads series, 3-1) Utah 115, Golden State 101 (Utah leads series, 3-1 Monday Cleveland 87, New Jersey 85 (Cleveland leads series, 3-1) Phoenix at San Antonio, late Today (TV: TNT) Chicago at Detroit, 8 p.m. Golden State at Utah, 10:30 p.m.\n\nPLAYOFF SCHEDULE"
