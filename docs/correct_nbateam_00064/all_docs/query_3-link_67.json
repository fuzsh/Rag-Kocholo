        "text": "Jonathan Givony\n\n@DraftExpress\n\nMatt Williams\n\n@DraftExpress\n\nOverview: A veteran lefty point guard who has transitioned back into a role player after spending a few years as strictly a shooting specialist. Personality and effort level makes him a crowd favorite. Doesnt have amazing athleticism, but has solid quickness for a player his age. Very strong for a point guard. Shoots the ball extremely consistently with deep range. Deadly from three and from the stripe. A good passer, but isnt asked to be a stereotypical point guard in the Triangle offense, with Lamar Odom and Kobe Bryant also being able to bring the ball the floor. Plays remarkably solid defense, and always gives everything he has on that end. Took some time to become the player he is today after spending four years at the University of Arkansas at Little Rock. Displays a very good work ethic. Provides a great locker room presence, and is a great leader. Does a lot of good things off the floor. Gives back to the community.\n\nOffense: A great shooter who does a good job running the point and moving the ball in the flow of the triangle offense. Gets most of his touches as a spot up shooter, but is also capable of pushing the break and running the pick and roll. Very efficient. Great catch and shoot player, one of the leagues best. Very impressive shooting stroke. Displays great elevation, range, and arc. Equally consistent shooter off the dribble. Very good from mid-range. Good ball handler, but doesnt get all the way inside the paint all that often. Not a good finisher at all once there. Tremendous foul shooter. Gets to the line at an average clip. Very smart player. Doesnt get his teammates open, but will move the ball well. Not turnover prone. Brings a veteran presence to an offense. Very clutch. Great asset due to his efficiency, experience and perimeter shooting ability.\n\nDefense: One of his teams best defenders due to his mix of experience, effort, and smarts. Isnt the biggest or quickest player, but displays solid lateral quickness. Hawks the ball extremely well despite not being as fast as many of the players he defends. Very quick hands. Will strip the ball when his man exposes it. Will capitalize on inexperienced players. Does a tremendous job rotating to stop drives and recovering when the ball is skipped. Great at stepping in and taking charges. Competes on every possession, making him a very formidable defensive matchup."
