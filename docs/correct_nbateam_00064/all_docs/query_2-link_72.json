        "text": "The Oklahoma City Thunder welcomed Derek Fisher’s second arrival because of his playoff experience and locker room presence stemmed from five NBA championships he won with the Lakers.\n\nPublished reports indicated the Dallas Mavericks, including owner Mark Cuban, feel otherwise. Fisher asked for his release there about two months ago, citing undisclosed family issues and want to heal his injured knee.\n\n“I felt strongly about the decision on a personal level,” Fisher said following the Thunder’s 108-104 win Sunday over the Clippers at Staples Center. “It wasn’t anything about Dallas, Mark or the team that I was not happy about. Just personally I didn’t enjoy being away from my family at the time.”\n\nFisher, 38, didn’t play against the Clippers, his second game sine joining Oklahoma City. How many years does the 17-year veteran plan to play?\n\n“I don’t really have a plan necessarily to retire or a plan to play until a particular year,” Fisher said. “I’m focused on these next few months to help this team and then go from there based on what happens.”"
