        "text": "Derek Fisher and Gloria Govan are officially husband and wife.\n\nThe former Knicks coach (currently coach of the L.A. Sparks) and the “Basketball Wives LA” star tied the knot on Saturday at Cielo Farms in Malibu, California, after the COVID-19 pandemic forced the couple to postpone their April nuptials.\n\nFisher and Govan shared details about their wedding day with People, which obtained the first photos of the newlyweds.\n\nGovan wore a plunging, curve-hugging gown by Monique Lhuillier that featured lace panels and beading around the waist. Her bridesmaids donned dresses by Dessy Collection, while Fisher’s groomsmen sported suits by Octavius Perry.\n\nGovan donned an up-do for the big day, courtesy of Karla Daniels. David Rodriguez was the makeup artist responsible for Govan’s glowing look.\n\nFisher proposed to Govan — the ex-wife of retired NBA champion Matt Barnes — in 2018, after the pair dated for more than three years.\n\n“We got engaged in 2018, and we eagerly started planning the wedding, but, unfortunately, like many, we had to cancel our big day,” Govan told People. “There were times we thought we should have a Zoom wedding instead of waiting but quickly realized our families being a part of the big day was important and our kids, who are just as excited as we are.”\n\nGovan and Barnes’ twin sons, Carter and Isaiah, were both present at the wedding. Fisher is a father of four.\n\n“For Derek and me, our wedding has been about unity and a blending of families,” Govan said.\n\nGuests in attendance were treated to four different signature cocktails themed around the blended Fisher-Govan family.\n\n“After the pandemic, we realized how important family really is. We could have easily eloped or filled out the paperwork and gotten it over with. But sharing this moment and event with those closest to us took priority over taking the easy route. We kept our guest list limited to those closest to us,” she explained.\n\nGovan’s brother Eric Govan officiated the ceremony, which took place under a gorgeous floral arch and scenic mountain views.\n\nGovan, whose divorce from Barnes was finalized in 2016, noted this is the second marriage for both her and Fisher. The WNBA coach divorced his wife Candace in March 2015.\n\nBarnes and Fisher made headlines in 2015 due to an altercation over Govan’s relationship with the former Knicks coach. Barnes recently clarified that he’s now “cool” with Fisher.\n\n“The most exciting part about this time around is all the growth we bring to the relationship,” Govan told the magazine. “The trials and tribulations we’ve experienced have played a huge part in who we are in our relationship today. From the start, we’ve been very honest about our expectations from our friendship to marriage.”\n\nAfter the “I dos,” guests enjoyed food from Trés LA Group’s Rob Pausmith and cake by Susie Cakes. I Do Coffee presented a coffee bar at the reception. DJ Malski provided music at the post-wedding party.\n\nFisher and Govan plan to honeymoon in Thailand in October after the WNBA season concludes.\n\n“After almost two years of waiting, here we are — and we couldn’t be happier,” Govan said."
