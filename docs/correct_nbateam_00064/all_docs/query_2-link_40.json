        "text": "Derek Fisher's consecutive games played streak now stands at one.\n\nAfter appearing in 537 straight games, Fisher had his league-leading streak snapped Sunday when he did not play in a game against Phoenix when he was still with Houston.\n\nBecause Fisher and the Rockets had yet to agree on a buyout, the NBA deemed Fisher eligible Sunday and ruled it as a missed game since he was still under contract, according to a league spokesman.\n\nFisher on Wednesday signed with the Thunder and made his debut the same night against the Los Angeles Clippers.\n\nOddly enough, Thunder guard Russell Westbrook now holds the longest consecutive games played streak among active players with 293. Westbrook has yet to miss a game since he was drafted fourth overall out of UCLA in 2008. Westbrook also has started 276 consecutive games.\n\nTwo weeks ago, Westbrook was third on the active list behind Fisher and former Charlotte forward Boris Diaw. But the Bobcats, who have since bought out Diaw, removed Diaw from the rotation on March 6, snapping his streak of 384 straight games.\n\nFisher, meanwhile, was traded from the Lakers to the Rockets at last week's deadline and was interested in continuing his 16-year career with a championship contender rather than with the Rockets.\n\n“In my mind, it's alive,” Fisher said of his streak prior to making his Thunder debut Wednesday. “But I'm sure in the NBA record books it's probably gone. But as far as I'm concerned, I was always, and am, and even tonight, physically able to play.”\n\nPrior to Friday's games, Westbrook led second-placed Portland guard Wesley Matthews by 83 games on the active consecutive games played list. Philadelphia guard Jrue Holiday was third with 189 consecutive games. Lakers forward Pau Gasol ranked fourth with 172 straight games, and Chicago's Kyle Korver was fifth with 164 consecutive games played.\n\nFormer forward A.C. Green is the NBA's all-time leader in consecutive games played with 1,192, a streak that spanned 15 seasons from 1986 to 2001."
