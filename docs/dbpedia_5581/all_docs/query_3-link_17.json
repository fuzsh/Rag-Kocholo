        "text": "Although in its simplistic sense globalization refers to the widening, deepening and speeding up of global interconnectedness, such a definition begs further elaboration. ... Globalization can be located on a continuum with the local, national and regional. At one end of the continuum lie social and economic relations and networks which are organized on a local and/or national basis; at the other end lie social and economic relations and networks which crystallize on the wider scale of regional and global interactions. Globalization can be taken to refer to those spatio-temporal processes of change which underpin a transformation in the organization of human affairs by linking together and expanding human activity across regions and continents. Without reference to such expansive spatial connections, there can be no clear or coherent formulation of this term. ... A satisfactory definition of globalization must capture each of these elements: extensity (stretching), intensity, veloci...\n\nGlobalisation is a multidimensional process which is present in many spheres and which is defined in many ways: it has developed with different degrees of intensity since the end of the 19th century and took on a particular importance in the closing decades of the 20th centur. Globalisation creates both opportunities and threats for its participants. One of the tendencies that has been getting stronger in the world for at least a quarter of a century is a progressive socio-economic differentiation and the splitting of the world into two separate blocks: the world of poverty and the world of riches. The social structure is undergoing changes. The distances between the individual segments of the market and those who are left outside the market are growing. The benefits from economic growth are not being spread equally.\n\nIs global exchange globalisation? Objects have always been passed on over long distances, but what does this mean? Historians, especially historians of economy, use the term ‘globalisation’ quite differently today: Is the early modern European expansion into Africa, America and Asia already to be understood as globalisation, or is only the imperialist seizure in the 19th century CE to be described as such? Was the 19th century CE perhaps even more globalised than the 21st century CE? Or can the expansion of the Roman Empire, or even the Empire of Alexander the Great, be understood as a globalisation process? What about the Persian Empire that preceded it?"
