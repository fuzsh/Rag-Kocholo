Consequently, my profuse thanks are due to Barry Langford for supervising the project with ceaseless support, enthusiasm and rigour over several years. I am also indebted to Christopher Frayling for his invaluable feedback and encouragement, to the ever-helpful staff at the BFI Library for their patient retrieval of countless obscure journals and to the Humanities and Arts Research Centre at Royal Holloway, University of London for funding my studies. I am most thankful to Jenna Steventon , Liza Thompson, Pat FitzGerald and all at I.B.Tauris for indulging my interests and permitting me this opportunity to disseminate them. Furthermore, my gratitude must be extended to Mark Glancy for opening my eyes to the study of film many moons ago. Elements of Chapters Two and Four of this book have previously been published in both The Italianist, 30 (2) and Scope: An Online Journal of Film and Television Studies, 15. I would therefore like to thank their editors for providing important forums for the germination of this volume. Every effort has been made to contact copyright holders. Any errors or omissions brought to the attention of the publishers will be made good in future editions. Such a brief note as this is an entirely inadequate medium through which to thank my parents, John and Joyce, for thirty-three years of unconditional love, intellectual stimulation and constructive criticism. A familial rock and moral anchor (not to mention a source of proof-reading) more reliable this eternal student cannot envisage. Finally, this book is dedicated to my partner Kirsty, without whose remarkable forbearance, loving disposition, insatiable good humour and aptitude for Italian it would not have been completed.\n\nIntroduction\n\nThe purpose of this book is twofold. Firstly, I aim to demonstrate how and why radicalised Italian film-makers identified in the Western genre an apt vehicle for communicating revolutionary political views in the national and international contexts of the late 1960s. Secondly – and more importantly – I seek to tell a story, charting the brief but intriguing lifespan of a group of films loved by fans but neglected by critics and scholars alike. The category of film-making now known the world over as the ‘Spaghetti Western’ was produced on a truly industrial scale, with almost five hundred Western films emerging from the Italian studio system between 1962 and 1980.1 In the milieu of popular Italian cinema of the era, where formulaic cycles (known locally as filoni 2) would ebb and flow with the perceived whims of popular taste, this constitutes not only a vast collection of films, but a remarkable longevity. Various trends therefore emerged, flourished and expired within the Spaghetti Western format itself, from slapstick comedies to baroque tales of intrigue and horror film hybrids. It is the task of this book to chart the lifespan of one such trend: that which appropriated the Italian Western with the intention of disseminating Far Left political doctrine between the years 1966 and 1970. In this period Damiano Damiani, Sergio Sollima, Sergio Corbucci, Giulio Questi and Giulio Petroni each directed films whose locales – though lifted directly from Hollywood – barely concealed bravura, and at times militant, denunciations of advanced capitalism. The Spaghetti Western as a whole has long been a favourite of cult film buffs, and increasingly enjoys a mainstream renaissance as audiences and critics reassess its influential place in film history (largely due to the internationally celebrated films of the now-canonised Roman director Sergio Leone). In the academic sphere, too, this once-scorned category of\n\n2\n\nRadical Frontiers in the Spaghetti Western\n\nfilm-making has come to inform fields from transnational popular culture to Italian studies, through the valuable works of Dimitris Eleftheriotis,3 Christopher Wagstaff 4 and, most notably, Christopher Frayling.5 Yet, while this filone’s visibility in Film Studies departments steadily increases as it becomes admitted into the pantheon of Italian cinema, there remains a scholarly void surrounding the politically-committed variations summarised above. Academic discussion of Italy’s 1960s political auteurs abounds (Rosi, Pontecorvo, Bellocchio to name but three), yet the complex relationship of the Italian Western to the political ferments of its era has gone almost entirely unnoticed.6 This book is the first extended analysis of these militant trends, and therefore seeks to fill this gap. As the plural noun in my title ‘Radical Frontiers’ indicates, the analysis identifies a variety of borderline exchanges which together construct this account of transcultural borrowing, political re-interpretation and generic mutation. The text is structured around an organising principle that the post-war transatlantic relationship was less one of domination by American-led modernity than one of negotiation and cultural blending: what the historian James Clifford dubs ‘cultural import-export’.7 Italian reworkings of the Western genre’s ideologies naturally provide the study with its foremost case in point. The films which form my primary source material are thus interpreted as neither rejections nor imitations of Hollywood’s cultural reach; more, by refocusing the Western through the lens of Italy’s revolutionary ‘New Left’ in and around the tumultuous events of 1968, they register processes of appropriation and re-inscription which characterised significant portions of Italian culture in this era. I show how, in this new political context, the Hollywood genre’s obsessive focus on the legitimacy of violence took on fresh meanings and appealed to new audiences. My first chapter sets the cultural-political scene of post-war Italy from which these films emerged, progressing through a steady arc of contextualisation from the broad to the particular: that is, from concerns spanning Italian culture to those of a specifically cinematic nature. By opening with an emblematic case-study of Steno’s satirical film Un americano a Roma (1954), I frame the book’s subject matter within the fraught debates of the era concerning Italy’s intimate encounter with US popular culture. After summarising and appraising the well-trodden arguments around transatlantic influence, I demonstrate how the increased cultural borrowing in this period frequently resulted in creative re-working. Though so-called ‘Americanisation’ was condemned by many on the political Left, appropriation and resistance characterised this imaginary ‘America’ upon which contemporary Italian mores were projected, but also contested.\n\nIntroduction\n\n3\n\nTurning to the Italian film industry as a key factor in this argument, I then repudiate the era’s widespread perceptions of a politically-engaged native cinema set against an anodyne, imitative genre cinema. Instead, the growth of the Roman studio system is analysed as a dynamic factor in these processes of cultural blending, from which the Italian Western emerged organically. As the chapter closes by introducing this filone’s political offshoot, I ask why, as Americana came to symbolise and fuel aspirant postwar notions of modernity, the Western film took on a singular resonance amongst militant constituencies. The cultural and political coordinates surrounding the emergence of the book’s key films thus detailed, my second chapter focuses on the Hollywood Western itself, assessing why this genre above all others came to be requisitioned for radical leftist ends in 1960s Italy. The previous chapter’s discussion of creative appropriation is now focussed specifically on this cinematic category. Through an examination of the Western’s history as both a popular format and an ideological vehicle, I arrive at the cultural ‘moment’ of the late 1960s, where key aspects of the genre are shown to possess compelling parallels with the concerns of Italian militants. I argue firstly that the Western’s archetypes, from their origins in the late nineteenth century, display notable concordances with dominant modes of representing the Italian South. The Wild West’s status as a contested terrain for American national identity was therefore equally a mythic space with resonance within the Italian popular imagination. The genre’s appropriation by radical audiences, for whom issues of banditry and redemptive violence held an additional fascination and urgency, is interpreted from within this preexisting framework. It is in the issue of violent action and its legitimisation that I identify the foremost point of contact between the Hollywood Western’s established structures and the concerns of Italian militants in the second half of the 1960s. The Spaghetti Western is frequently accused of evacuating the genre’s emphasis on violence of its moral imperative. The next two chapters illustrate how ideological re-inscriptions sought to replenish it. Chapter Three defines and analyses the first of two strands of politicallyengaged Italian Westerns addressed by this book: what I dub the RSA, or ‘Repressive State Apparatus’, variant. The key films analysed in this chapter are Se sei vivo, spara!/Django Kill! (Giulio Questi, 1967), La resa dei conti/The Big Gundown (Sergio Sollima, 1967), Faccia a faccia/Face to Face (Sollima, 1967) and Il grande Silenzio/The Great Silence (Sergio Corbucci, 1968). The primary political function I identify in this group of films is an attempt to expose brutal mechanisms lying behind modern-day Western society. I demonstrate\n\n4\n\nRadical Frontiers in the Spaghetti Western\n\nthese films’ close engagement with preoccupations characteristic of Italy’s radical New Left, particularly concerning latent domestic fascism and the oppressive ‘system’. The first half of the chapter is a wide-ranging analytical survey of antecedents and offshoots of this trend within the wider Spaghetti Western, revisiting famed and obscure films alike to demonstrate the gradual and organic emergence of this radicalised inclination. My appraisal considers the extent to which the trend emerged from film-makers with traumatic experiences of the Second World War and the Resistance against Nazism, positing that their films’ ideological function is twofold: they seek simultaneously to evoke the horrors of the nation’s past and to expose continuing threats in its present. The chapter’s focus then shifts to a close analysis of narrative and cinematography in two films which offer emblematic expressions of this trend’s outlook: La resa dei conti and Faccia a faccia. I show how, with a meticulous manipulation of dramatic irony, revelation and point-ofview, Sergio Sollima attempts to position his audience to communicate his political agenda. Faccia a faccia in particular, through a philosophical subtext pertaining to the historical theses of Friedrich Nietzsche and Walter Benjamin, displays a level of sophistication rarely associated with the Italian Western. Ultimately, however, I argue that this film’s political incoherence renders Sollima’s intended messages problematic. In its ambivalence to the ethics of violence, it inadvertently reflects ideological contradictions within late 1960s protest movements, which would lead some factions towards armed struggle as the 1970s dawned. Chapter Four defines and analyses the second trend of politicallyengaged Italian Westerns, which I dub the ‘insurgency’ variant. The key films analysed here are Quien sabe?/A Bullet for the General (Damiano Damiani, 1966), Corri, uomo, corri/Run, Man, Run (Sergio Sollima, 1968), Il mercenario/ The Mercenary (Sergio Corbucci, 1968), Tepepa (Giulio Petroni, 1969) and Vamos a matar, compañeros (Corbucci, 1970; henceforth Compañeros). Set in the revolutionary ‘Mexico’ of the popular imagination, these films’ endorsements of violent peasant insurrection against the Western world are as bravura as they are obvious. My analysis, however, additionally identifies how they seek to wage a cinematic campaign against the representational practices of Hollywood. I begin by surveying the allegorical motif of the border crossing as repeatedly depicted in US cinema during the Cold War. Here, the presence of white adventurers in Mexico is met with gratitude and cordiality by oppressed peasants. I then argue that it is precisely this mode of representation which is engaged by the key films examined in the chapter, through close examination\n\nIntroduction\n\n5\n\nof camerawork, narrative and performance. On the surface these radicalised films reformulate the Hollywood Western into an oppositional format in remarkably explicit terms. They appropriate the commonplace depiction of aspirant Third World peasants and benevolent American interlopers, seeking quite literally to turn the film camera around and applying the Western’s emphasis on regenerative violence to the postcolonial theses of Frantz Fanon. Far from rejecting the ideological functions of the Hollywood Western, however, these films in fact work with the genre’s traditions, inadvertently giving the reader a glimpse into the transatlantic dynamics of popular Italian film-making of the era. Not only do their methodologies betray an ambiguous outlook on Italy’s post-war encounter with US popular culture; their failure to put forward consistent ideological positions frequently tends towards banality and over-simplification (a charge most pertinently levelled at Corbucci’s Il mercenario (1968) and Compañeros (1970)). These intentions and ambiguities outlined and discussed, Chapter Five assesses the films’ legacies in global popular culture, which have diverged markedly from that which their makers intended. My focus here shifts to the US film industry – where the Spaghetti Western’s legacy is at its most globally visible – and the timescale of the book now widens considerably, to chart the myriad strands of influence these eccentrically radicalised films can be seen to have exerted. While the previous two chapters have shown filmmakers seeking to steer the viewer towards specific political viewpoints, I now show audiences once again engaged in processes of cultural borrowing to construct their own meanings from these imports. This transatlantic relationship, however, is the reverse of that depicted in Chapter One – this time US audiences appropriating Italian popular culture – and the book’s central concern turns to gauging the political and cinematic impact of the films previously assessed. My analysis focuses, firstly, on one decisive factor in their artistic failure. These films’ international releases came at a time when violence of a stylistic kind was the hot topic of debate, as Hollywood’s Production Code was giving way to a new wave of brutal cinema. I assess the implications of the violence depicted in these Italian Westerns, both through analysing patterns in contemporary critical reception, and through a contrast with the stylistics being simultaneously pioneered within Hollywood’s own emergent counterculture. Arthur Penn’s Bonnie and Clyde (1967), Sam Peckinpah’s The Wild Bunch (1969) and Don Medford’s The Hunting Party (1971) in particular provide this segment with gory, graphic counterpoints to the surprisingly sanitised and bloodless depictions of death to be found throughout the Spaghetti Western. I argue that this stylistic divergence holds\n\n6\n\nRadical Frontiers in the Spaghetti Western\n\na key to understanding why, though the Hollywood Western itself became increasingly appropriated for radical ends in the 1970s, the belligerent militancy evident within the Italian films mostly failed to translate into global popular culture. On one hand, I demonstrate that these films’ postmodern re-workings of Hollywood did connect with certain disenfranchised groupings in the USA, identifying in ‘blaxploitation’ a strand of influence which retains the postcolonial meanings intended by the Italians. I show, however, that this ‘grindhouse’ association has itself contributed to a politically anodyne reception in contemporary US cinema. Appropriated and admired by Quentin Tarantino, Robert Rodriguez and Sam Raimi, these supposedly radical works have become assimilated into ‘cool’ pop culture and transformed into violent, but not political, films. To conclude, Chapter Six situates these films’ approaches to genre cinema within the varied cultural outlooks of the European New Left. I argue that they belong firmly within a spectrum of late 1960s political cinema and attest to the diversity of attitudes towards political dissemination amongst radical groups. Through a comparison of cinematic technique with the work of Jean-Luc Godard, I repudiate assertions that such popular political films as those addressed by this book were diametrically opposed to more experimental forms in this era. Ultimately, however, I show that their entwinement with (and reliance upon) genre convention was their undoing. Their simultaneous attempts to destroy the authority of a Hollywood format and to inscribe new authoritative structures into that same paradigm prove contradictory. As Chapter Five demonstrates, they themselves have become reformulated by disparate audiences, and emptied of their intended political imperatives. I leave these films as illuminating yet ambiguous case studies of transatlantic borrowing, which underline to the reader the key role of an audience in the negotiation of cultural meaning. It is my intention that this volume should offer the reader a fresh, compelling and nuanced perspective on the political coordinates of European cinema and the Hollywood Western alike. Its scholarly focus incorporates discourses and arguments pertaining to auteur theory, trash cinema, transculturation, structuralism and postmodernism. Yet these are mere academic adornments to the book’s true purpose: that of looking again at a group of stylistically eccentric and riotously entertaining films whose very flaws render them fascinating objects of study for student and film buff alike. While this is no work of enthralled hagiography (the fundamental incoherence of the films’ agendas is a central concern throughout), it is born of a profound fondness for the lesser-known contributions to a filmic\n\nIntroduction\n\n7\n\ncategory so often dominated by the aegis of Sergio Leone. I hope that this enthusiasm is discernible in my writing. I must make a couple of points for the sake of consistency, brevity and clarity. Western movies produced or co-produced by Italian studios in the 1960s and 1970s have been variously referred to as ‘Spaghetti Westerns’, ‘Euro Westerns’, Westerns all’italiana and even ‘Macaroni Westerns’. Though Christopher Frayling quite reasonably justifies his own use of the originally pejorative ‘spaghetti’ moniker by identifying in it a symbolic cultural hybridity,8 in the majority of cases I opt instead for the neutral and descriptive ‘Italian Western’. I frequently add an extra prefix to categorise ‘political’ or ‘militant’ Italian Westerns, distinguishing my key group of films from the bulk of this larger filone. Additionally, since Chapters Three and Four analyse two distinct trends within this group, I require a further division between the ‘RSA’ (‘Repressive State Apparatus’) narrative and the ‘insurgency’ narrative. Lastly, I wish to make clear my partial use of the Italian language. Throughout the book I translate films’ Italian dialogue into English as faithfully as possible, only mentioning the Italian where I feel clarification of meaning is required. Likewise, I translate Italian interviews and Italian critics’ analyses into English. Conversely, however, I refer to Italian films by their Italian titles. This too is primarily for clarity’s sake, since most Italian Westerns have been subsequently released in cinemas, as well as on television, VHS and DVD, under numerous English language titles. To cite just one example, Giuliano Carnimeo’s Una nuvola di polvere … un grido di morte … arriva Sartana (1970) was released internationally under the titles Cloud of Dust … Cry of Death … Sartana is Coming, Gunman in Town and Light the Fuse … Sartana is Coming. For the sake of consistency, this policy applies equally to films whose English titles are the better known: The Good, the Bad and the Ugly remains Il buono, il brutto, il cattivo.\n\n1 Imagining America: US Influence and American Mythology in Post-War Italy\n\nLate at night, a lone figure darts between pillars and doorways to a portentous backing track. Approaching footsteps from the shadows augur a meeting in the deserted street. The ‘gun’ drawn in anticipation, however, is make-believe, for I describe a scene not from Hollywood film noir, but from Un americano a Roma: an Italian comedy directed by Steno in 1954. Nando Moriconi (Alberto Sordi) is returning home from his local cinema where, jostling for position with equally wide-eyed children, he has just seen the latest Hopalong Cassidy Western. The thrill of Wild West shoot-outs and vast desert landscapes contrasts markedly with the tenements and narrow cobbled streets of the Roman district of Trastevere; yet Nando is immersed in his private world of Hollywood mythology, and projects his fantasies onto this familiar locale. The spell is abruptly broken when a policeman approaches and the music cuts out, since Nando’s ‘America’ is no more than a phantasm of the movie screen. I open with this arresting and memorable vignette because it foregrounds cultural factors which would play key roles in the emergence and development of my central subject matter, and which form the basis of this chapter. Steno’s film – dubbed by David Ellwood ‘a milestone in the history of Italian identity’1 – parodies and anticipates significant transformations brought about by Italy’s post-war alignment with the American sphere of influence. Simultaneously, however, it depicts this flow of transatlantic borrowing as a process of negotiation and reinterpretation, instead of mere imitation.\n\n12\n\nRadical Frontiers in the Spaghetti Western\n\nNando Moriconi, though infatuated with the United States as a vibrant and modern alternative to a dreary post-war Europe, is not a passive member of the cinema audience, gazing longingly at America and its mythologies. Once he leaves the picture house he attempts to re-mould the semantic structures of Americana to formulate his own identity, with comic consequences. His incomprehension of US culture, for example, is ably symbolised by his meal of bread, milk, yoghurt and mustard, which he imagines is an American dish and which proves so inedible he is forced to turn back to the familiar spaghetti and wine. With such vivid symbolism, Un americano a Roma captures the disorientation discernible through much of Italy’s cultural output of the 1950s and 1960s, and I shall refer back to the emblematic scene on which this chapter begins at various points through the course of the book. The films which will form the primary focus of this volume are ineluctably tied to these pre-existing processes of creative participation in the meanings of transatlantic formats. Though the notion of militant leftwing Italian Westerns may at first seem offbeat, eccentric or even downright ludicrous, this was an entirely logical, obvious and perhaps necessary conceit given the cultural-political conditions of the films’ time and place. Their anti-imperialist stances and intended rejection of Occidental capitalism ostensibly place them at odds with the very concept of the ‘West’. It is my contention, however, that they are in fact entwined in a dialogue with the traditions and ideologies of the Hollywood Western. In order to analyse the complexities of this argument beyond reductive notions of imitation or rejection, it is essential that I chart both the cinematic and the wider cultural milieus which fostered these films. It is for this reason that the following two chapters assess their historical, political and cultural antecedents before I embark on the more textual and cinematic analysis at the book’s core. My intention is that, through this methodology, these two chapters will allow the reader to arrive at the cultural ‘moment’ of the films’ production and release, firstly through assessing the fraught debates surrounding ‘Americanisation’ in post-war Italy. I shall then refine this issue to focus on the cinema industry and then, in Chapter Two, specifically on the Western genre, to chart the myriad processes of transcultural borrowing which meet in the films of Damiani, Sollima et al. ‘Americanisation’ in Post-War Italy By the 1950s, Gertrude Stein’s 1935 declaration that ‘the twentieth century has become the American century’2 had a prescience which was all too apparent to many cultural critics in Europe. The growing hegemony of\n\nImagining America\n\n13\n\nthe United States had been preoccupying intellectuals for decades (William Stead, for example, published The Americanization of the World as early as 1902). In the post-war years, however, concerns over the degradation of traditional culture brought about by US-led modernity intensified considerably. The influx of Hollywood films, the perceived pell-mell adoption by youth culture of transatlantic fashions and the continued presence of US troops on European soil led many to express a sense that indigenous culture was being overwhelmed. Intellectuals from across the political spectrum – notably Orwell, Leavis, Marcuse and Sartre – engaged in earnest condemnations of American cultural imperialism, as US hegemony in the West became ever more apparent in the 1950s. A dystopian vision of a conformist mass culture sweeping away European traditions, foretold by Orwell renaming Britain ‘Airstrip One’ in Nineteen Eighty-Four,3 was dubbed ‘admass’ by JB Priestley. Palpable in both terms is a sense of horror at the standardisation awaiting the world in the second half of ‘the American century’. Seminal theorists of early British cultural studies such as Richard Hoggart, Raymond Williams and EP Thompson were among the most vociferous of these critics. Hoggart’s The Uses of Literacy, in studying the ‘candy-floss world’4 of mass consumerism, laments the debasement of working-class culture caused by the ‘spiritual dry-rot’ of homogeneous Americanisation. His despair at British youth, whose ‘clothes […] hairstyles […] facial expressions all indicate [they] are living […] in a mythworld compounded of a few simple elements which they take to be those of American life’,5 demonstrates Nando Moriconi’s affectations to be signs of the times well beyond the borders of Italy. These most rigorous of British critiques came chiefly from within the broad church of socialist thinking that formed the nascent New Left (Thompson, for example, was a member of the Communist Party of Great Britain until 1956, while Hoggart was a member of the Labour Party). In Italy, however, the foremost contemporaneous and analogous stance came specifically from the Italian Communist Party (PCI). This, indeed, reflected the PCI’s considerably more influential status amongst national Communist parties as a mass movement, which broadly spoke for the political Left in national discourse prior to the mid 1960s.6 The PCI’s post-war ethos drew largely from the writings of the party’s founder Antonio Gramsci and from the legacy of the wartime Resistance to Nazism, but was also built on a vehement opposition to American influence. In 1948, a hard-line attitude towards American culture was announced by deputy leader Pietro Secchia:\n\n14\n\nRadical Frontiers in the Spaghetti Western\n\nThe great American trusts send us not only their riflemen, their spies, their agents, and organizers of sabotage and betrayal, but inundate our country with their books, their films, and their lowbrow ideological rubbish that should serve to weaken, disorient, and corrupt our people.7 ‘Americanisation’ (that is, the emulation and adoption of habits and values associated with the USA) thus became a distinctly pejorative term in post-war Europe, implying pollution and corruption. Rob Kroes defines it as a word which ‘normally serves in a discourse of rejection to point to the variety of processes through which America exerts its dismal influence on European cultures. [This view] reduces the complex processes of cultural influence […] to the stark binary form’.8 The issue, indeed, was not as clearcut as Hoggart or Secchia supposed. Even within the PCI itself, the wider membership engaged in debates surrounding the political implications of US-led consumerism and mass culture for much of the 1950s. As we shall see, they did not universally accord with the leadership’s hostility. US Influence and Italy’s ‘Economic Miracle’ David Forgacs suggests that ‘Americanisation is, in part at least, a symptom of anxieties about one’s own national identity’.9 It follows that countries lacking a strong national culture are among the most susceptible to the superimposition of American imports, and post-war Italy was a case in point. Shortly after the War, former Prime Minister Francesco Saverio Nitti described the unified state of Italy as ‘the eggshell holding the national Humpty Dumpty together, a make-believe country that never obtained the complete […] support of all its incredulous citizens’.10 Despite the concerted efforts of the Fascist regime to shift loyalties from the family to the state, regional identity remained the dominant pole of attraction for many, especially in the South, and a unified national culture was largely absent outside the Catholic Church and the national football team. In 1956, local dialects were the prevalent form of everyday communication for 82 per cent of the population11 and Italy did not possess a genuinely ‘national’ press.12 Added to this, the rapid modernisation of the economy in the 1950s arrived late when compared to northern European nations such as Britain or Germany so that Italy became simultaneously an underdeveloped and an industrialised nation.13 Stephen Gundle argues that Italy was the most receptive European country to American imports precisely because uneven economic development, combined with rapid industrialisation in the 1950s,\n\nImagining America\n\n15\n\ncoincided with this absence of a genuine secular culture common to all.14 This left a considerable void in the field of mass communications media, and weakened the nation’s ability to filter foreign imports. Moreover, postwar Christian Democrat (DC) governments were content to see this void filled by American models, not least because of the covert role these played in discrediting their rivals, the PCI. American cinema in particular had been a source of fascination for Italian audiences since the 1920s, but in the immediate post-war period this intensified considerably. The Americans – an occupying force in a devastated country – monopolised the market and implemented the Motion Picture Export Association of America’s ‘dumping’ policy, releasing a six year backlog of Hollywood films. In the first year after the Fascist embargo on Hollywood output was lifted (1946), foreign (mostly American) imports received 87 per cent of box-office receipts.15 US films, actors and lifestyles thus became increasingly integrated into the popular Italian psyche, and this influx was purposefully tailored. Of all the Western European nations Italy, as a liminal economy with a strong left-wing sub-culture, was both a potential bridgehead and a key focus for US anxiety over encroaching communist influence. This, as well the lure of a lucrative export market, motivated the USA to play an active role in the nation’s processes of modernisation since, conversely, the potentialities of renewed European prosperity as a Cold War weapon were tangible. The domestic market thus became replete with films expounding the virtues of the American lifestyle in time for the DC’s 1948 election victory over the PCI.16 In 1949, the government opted to join NATO, committing Italy to play a central role in supporting US foreign policy. The country’s subsequent modernisation along American lines, in part facilitated by the European Recovery Programme (ERP), provided the USA with the propaganda victory it had sought in its efforts to create a free market economy in Western Europe. The arrival of television in Italy in 1954 was a watershed in the fostering of consumer aspiration, fundamentally advancing the nation’s linguistic unification and heralding the start, in the domestic sphere, of what would become known as the ‘Economic Miracle’. The state broadcaster RAI followed a strict Catholic moral code and a DC party line, while enticing glimpses of the outside world presented Italians with a life of consumerism based broadly around the ‘American Dream’. This was at its most pronounced in such programmes as the hugely popular quiz show Lascia o raddoppia?, and the daily half hour advertisement slot Carosello. Paolo Scrivano records that the first TV sets to appear were labelled ‘American’,\n\n16\n\nRadical Frontiers in the Spaghetti Western\n\nthus linking post-war symbols of modernity with the transatlantic brand and its aspirational subtext.17 As had previously been the case elsewhere, television was at first, like cinema, a collective form of entertainment. Bars, clubs and even the PCI’s Case del popolo (‘houses of the people’) purchased sets. In the five years between 1956 and 1961, however, the number of television licences in Italy increased more than sevenfold.18 Though still far behind the UK,19 let alone the USA, this statistic demonstrates the rate at which American models of consumption were becoming steadily more domesticated during the Economic Miracle. On the face of it these processes saw Italians become healthier, more prosperous and more cosmopolitan.20 Car ownership helped to break down regional barriers, as the nation’s post-war development broadly signalled a transition from an agrarian economy to an urbanised, mobile and industrial one with a global outlook. The economic, political and cultural influences of the USA have therefore long been recognised as the most important factors in the transformation of post-war Italy, and the nation’s rapid development of the 1950s indeed owed much to American models of modernity. Recent analysis, however, has highlighted the extent to which neither the reach nor the exact nature of this phenomenon are easily defined. In analysing the trends characteristic of Italian domestic life during the Economic Miracle, Scrivano writes: A multifaceted process characterized by contradictory meanings, Americanization took various forms and developed in highly differentiated ways. Indeed, it is difficult to gauge the extent to which American models were ever simply adopted: closer analysis reveals that such influences were subject to repeated misinterpretation, negotiation and even resistance.21 That this was a relationship of ambiguity more than one of linear displacement is illustrated by the limitations of the economic transformation fostered by the so-called ‘Miracle’. To be sure, American imports had a significant impact on every stratum of Italian society but, as Scrivano concludes, ‘modernization and Americanization did not necessarily coincide’.22 The economic realities of the era indeed depict a considerably less inexorable process. Though this intimate encounter with transatlantic culture had a profound effect on the lives of those in the South of Italy, this was more an Americanisation of consciousness and of aspiration than it was one of lifestyle. For many southerners, indeed, consumption was less a reality than a spectacle. Disparities between the industrial North-West and\n\nImagining America\n\n17\n\nthe rural South grew more pronounced during these years, and by the late 1950s the mass media had developed faster than had the economy. Paul Ginsborg depicts an emblematic scene of the era, as southerners could only sit and literally watch the transformations unfolding in mobility, consumerism and fashion: In the evenings, in the piazzas of the southern cities […] the television of the local bar transmitted images from the North, images of a consumer world, of Vespas, portable radios, football heroes, new fashions, nylon stockings, mass-produced dresses, houses full of electrical appliances, Sunday excursions in the family FIAT.23 Chronic rural unemployment and the pull of northern prosperity on display so graphically saw a considerable exodus ensue, both from the countryside into the cities, and from the South into the North-West.24 This influx of southern labour caught northern cities unawares. By the late 1960s, Turin alone had received nearly a million migrants in 15 years, and the newcomers were often deprived of basic sanitation and services. Southern cities, too, experienced considerable growth. The government provided subsidies to industrialise Naples, Bari, Catania and Palermo, but the rapidity of change led to overpopulation, with urban centres growing outwards in uncontrolled sprawls. Enduring poverty, state corruption and forced migration were the experiences many southerners had of the Economic Miracle. That Italy’s economy ‘Americanised’ in these years is evident but, as Martin Clark argues, the ambiguity of this process is equally plain to see: ‘The Northern [cities] became North American: commercial complexes surrounded by industrial estates. The Southern ones became South American: administrative centres surrounded by shanty towns.’25 Beneath the veneer of modernisation lay persistent, and exacerbated, uneven development: a far cry from the homogeneous ‘admass’ feared by many European intellectuals. By 1960, with this ‘Miracle’ in full swing, ambivalence towards the transformations in Italian society was becoming prominent on the cinema screen. In that year, Federico Fellini’s La dolce vita depicted a vacuous, media-driven culture overwhelming traditional ways of life, registering the contemporary trauma beneath the affluent façade. A young Umbrian waitress with whom Marcello (Marcello Mastroianni) converses has been forced to move to the city so her father can earn money. She confesses to crying with homesickness every time she sees a car with an Umbrian registration, indicating both the breakdown of regional identity and the ubiquity, by the early 1960s, of automotive transport. Pierre Sorlin contrasts\n\n18\n\nRadical Frontiers in the Spaghetti Western\n\nLa dolce vita with Luchino Visconti’s Rocco e i suoi fratelli – released within a few months of each other in 1960 – as social documents of this dualism lurking beneath the Economic Miracle.26 Fellini’s film shows the decadence of the modern city into which Visconti simultaneously places an impoverished Sicilian family, torn apart by desperation. The South of Italy in particular thus found itself being shoehorned into the ethos of an affluent consumer society, and socio-economic inequalities intensified as a foreign model of modernity took root. It is therefore unsurprising that metaphors of imperialism, repression and invasion were so commonly used amongst those for whom American ideologies were anathema (the PCI, for example, launched its defence of traditional Italian popular culture with a resolution entitled ‘Against Imperialist and Clerical Obscurantism’27). Indeed, there is some credence to the argument that Italy’s alignment with America in the post-war years was imposed as much as it was invited. US troops arriving on southern Italian soil in 1943 symbolised a world of prosperity in marked contrast to many of their hosts’ poverty-stricken lives. Italy experienced a more conspicuous and extended presence of American troops than any other European nation during and after the War, and a culture of occupation grew as Allied forces moved northwards. GIs distributed cigarettes and food to the people, took advantage of local prostitutes, erected American road signs and established a lingua franca merging English and Italian. In short, as Anna Maria Torriglia puts it, ‘Americans provisionally transformed Italy into their own land’.28 One scene from Roberto Rossellini’s Roma città aperta (1945) anticipates the innate ambivalence towards Italy’s liberators, even while the War still raged. On the one hand, America and Americans were mythologised as representatives of a distant utopia, soon to bring the bounties of modernity to a nation on its knees. On the other, their overwhelming power was a tangible and daunting reality, and in 1945 Italy’s uncertain future was to be decided by foreign forces. Returning from a scene of mass looting in wartorn Rome, the neighbourhood police sergeant (Eduardo Passarelli) asks, hopefully: ‘Pina, do you think Americans really exist?’ Pina (Anna Magnani) looks up, as a point-of-view shot focuses on a bombed-out building. With a look of resignation on her face, she replies: ‘It seems so.’ From 1948, the Marshall Plan’s media campaign actively set out to construct a culture of consent, including mobile puppet shows to persuade Italian families of the virtues of American ways of life. Ginsborg describes this political intervention as ‘breath-taking in its size, its ingenuity and its flagrant contempt for any principle of non-interference in the internal affairs of another country’.29 Intense political pressure was exerted by the\n\nImagining America\n\n19\n\nAmerican ambassador in Rome, James Dunn, and by Secretary of State George Marshall, threatening to suspend aid if the PCI won the 1948 elections. The 1953 elections saw a repeat performance, with ambassador Clare Boothe Luce issuing dire warnings of the consequences for Italy’s future if the DC were to lose. From a military and political perspective (as well as an economic one in the case of the South), it can therefore be said that Italy had been colonised by the American sphere of influence. This was also the case in much of Western Europe, where dissenting voices similarly used the language of imperial domination. Raymond Williams, for one, declared Britain to be ‘at certain levels […] culturally an American colony’.30 Both this comment and the PCI’s proclamation of resistance against ‘imperialism’ express a sense of unilateral coercion, and of domination and displacement of the native culture. The relevance of such a lexicon when referring to the cultural relationship between America and Europe is, however, ambiguous. Michel de Certeau also uses colonial relations as a paradigm for assessing Americanisation, but arrives at a different conclusion: ‘Users make […] innumerable and infinitesimal transformations of and within the dominant cultural economy in order to adapt it to their own interests and their own rules.’31 Even if Italy was an American colony, the natives appropriated, subverted and adapted ‘America’ as much as ‘America’ foisted itself upon them. This notion of exchange, dubbed ‘cultural import-export’ by James Clifford,32 offers a firm riposte to assertions of linear subordination such as those expressed by Hoggart and Williams in Britain, and influential PCI members in Italy. Transatlantic Borrowing and the Italian Communist Party In truth, the PCI was divided in its response to the increasing influence of US popular culture in Italy, and trends of appropriation and adaptation within the party itself were testament to the inherent attractiveness of these novel imports.33 On the one hand, Hollywood and other forms of commercial mass culture which were proliferating in this period were seen to be exerting an irredeemably corrupting influence on the working classes. Writing in the party’s weekly magazine Vie Nuove in 1946, Lucio Lombardo Radice wrote: Poor quality, insignificant, and unintelligent literature is unfortunately very widespread among workers: American-style children’s comics, with ‘strip cartoons’ and the most hideous, idiotic, and monstrous adventures, the sports press of whatever standard and shoddy, cheap\n\n20\n\nRadical Frontiers in the Spaghetti Western\n\nfilms. […] In this way their resistance is at least partially side-tracked and their capacity for struggle worn down.34 The PCI’s leader Palmiro Togliatti remained committed to the notion that genuine ‘popular culture’ comprised provincial traditions, community activities and educational enlightenment (in much the same way as Hoggart viewed the British working classes’ communal customs). This outlook owed much to the leadership’s adherence to the memory and writings of Antonio Gramsci. Posthumously published on Togliatti’s initiative between 1948 and 1951, Gramsci’s Prison Notebooks show an awareness of the problems facing the PCI’s cultural outlook, addressing the historic failure of Italian intellectuals to bridge the gap between themselves and ‘the people’. Forgacs, however, writes that Gramsci’s work was ‘barely touched by an awareness of the new communications media [and] acted in the main as a conservative, retarding influence on the party’s cultural work in the 50s and early 60s’.35 While Italy looked to the future, the PCI followed a policy of demonising popular media of cultural expression such as television and genre cinema.36 In this drive for a progressive popular culture book clubs, reading groups and mass theatre societies were founded. Case del popolo arranged debates, meetings and film clubs, and the festa dell’Unità became a central event in local party efforts to promote community life and solidarity. As we have seen, the PCI was the parliamentary spearhead of a large and influential communist sub-culture. From 1948 its leadership attempted to mobilise this significant support base to champion politically-committed ‘neorealist’ Italian filmmaking over Hollywood imports. Writer and director Carlo Lizzani wrote that the aim of this movement was one of ‘reawakening the critical spirit of the popular masses, directing their tastes and preferences […] in order to subtract as much as possible the masses from the noxious influence of a cinema shot through with vulgarity, banality, and gangsterism’.37 On the other hand, there was simultaneously a growing awareness within sections of the PCI that such a prescriptive outlook would jeopardise the party’s impact upon civil society. Defending sympathetic presentations of American films in Vie Nuove, deputy editor Michele Pellicani argued in 1949: ‘As Marxists we combat capitalist society but – as long as this is the society in which we live – we cannot ignore its laws. […] We cannot put ourselves outside reality.’38 As Forgacs states, opposing attitudes viewing mass media as bourgeois propagators of false consciousness indoctrinating the people ‘contained very little notion that “the people” might already be “within” culture, still less that they themselves produce valid forms of cultural expression’.39 Hoggart portrayed a working class who ‘take up\n\nImagining America\n\n21\n\n[Americanisms] just as they appear and use them in the manner of the child in the fairy-tale, who found toys hanging from the trees and lollipops by the roadside’.40 So too the comments already cited from Secchia, Radice and Lizzani disregarded consumers’ tendencies to negotiate with cultural imports, creating a hybrid modern identity. Though the PCI leadership’s ideological revulsion for Americana largely precluded their appreciating the fact, ‘Americanisation’ offered vitality, novelty and escape. The party membership was no different from the rest of the populace in this respect. Nor was such appropriation by any means restricted to the PCI’s rank and file, since intellectuals within the party – notably Elio Vittorini and Cesare Pavese – also openly emulated US culture. Vittorini began his career as a translator, diffuser and advocate of American literature. During the Fascist era he was a leading propagator of the literary ‘American myth’ of an unreconstructed land of freedom. His translations frequently contained editorial cuts, ‘improving’ the source material or, as Torriglia puts it, ‘appropriating America and adapting it to an Italian sociocultural code, thereby stressing his own “fictional” contribution to the shaping of the myth’.41 In the aftermath of the War, Vittorini rode a wave of cultural renewal amongst intellectuals, condemning European culture from Ancient Greece onwards and advocating a rebuilding along American lines. In 1948, Togliatti closed down Vittorini’s journal Il politecnico over this very issue, but the appeal of America could not be suppressed so easily. Observing the PCI’s activities in the 1950s, indeed, one can see that the communist sub-culture was widely engaged in appropriating aspects of American popular culture. Though Radice had expressed abhorrence for ‘American-style comics’, in 1950 the party commissioned L’Unità journalist Gianni Rodari to oversee the publication of a weekly children’s comic book of fantasy and adventure stories. Il pioniere maintained a socially conscientious party line and was distributed in Case del popolo to children enrolled in the PCI’s after-school program. Throughout the 1950s, in an attempt to cultivate an alternative popular culture to one of American derivation, the party held annual ‘Miss Vie Nuove’ beauty contests and dance evenings with transatlantic rhythms. Towards the end of that decade the leadership was forced to concede more ground to popular tastes, inviting television personalities to party festivals and utilising the format of the photo-romance magazine for electoral material. Gundle describes these as ‘a striking example of how the rituals and aspirations engendered by Hollywood were absorbed by the Communist subculture’.42 That the PCI – the most disciplined and widespread organisation expounding anti-American messages in Italy – could not persuade much\n\n22\n\nRadical Frontiers in the Spaghetti Western\n\nof its own membership to acquiesce on this issue gives some indication of the seductiveness of American culture in post-war Europe. Though communist critics such as Antonello Trombadori condemned De Santis’s Riso amaro (1949) for assimilating aspects of US popular culture, the vibrant mythologies of that very culture continued to exert considerable appeal. In 1954 (appropriately enough, the year Un americano a Roma was released) Giuseppe Turroni interviewed a 23 year old PCI member who admitted preferring Westerns and adventure films to the neorealist cinema championed by his party, which was ‘too intellectual and difficult’.43 As is so vividly satirised in Steno’s film, the ‘America’ with which young Europeans were becoming increasingly fascinated had little to do with the realities of contemporary life in the USA, and a lot to do with the output of Hollywood. The Wild West in Italian Culture Dick Hebdige suggests that, for young working-class males, ‘American popular culture – Hollywood films, advertising images, packaging, clothes and music – offers a rich iconography, a set of symbols, objects and artefacts which can be assembled and re-assembled by different groups in a literally limitless number of combinations’.44 This second-hand, imaginary conception of US culture and society implies that, for many, the ubiquity of Hollywood imagery had distilled ‘the USA’ into a collection of instantly recognisable and available symbols of modernity, insubordination and emancipation.45 One did not have to look far to find such sentiments being expressed in Italy. Cesare Pavese, for example, described American culture in the postwar years as ‘a kind of great laboratory where […] we pursued […] [the] task of creating a modern taste, style and world’.46 His metaphor succinctly expresses the sense that exciting new concoctions were being formulated and blended by Europeans to create a brave new world. In the 1950s, very few European residents had actually crossed the Atlantic (neither Vittorini nor Pavese had, and the comedy behind Nando Moriconi’s delusions relies on his ignorance of American life). That Americana became a touchstone for European youth culture is therefore due largely to the inherently mythic nature of that very entity: namely, ‘America’ itself. As Jean Baudrillard wrote on visiting the USA: ‘I was here in my imagination long before I actually came here.’47 The Wild West was, and is, at once the most recognisable and the most escapist manifestation of this American imaginary. Famously described by André Bazin as ‘the American film par excellence’,48 it is a Western which inspires Nando Moriconi’s flight of fancy in the narrow streets of Rome.\n\nImagining America\n\n23\n\nSimultaneously a genre which exploits the excitement and the spectacle of the cinema screen, and which acts (ostensibly at least) as a synecdoche for the ‘American Dream’ itself, the Western functioned above all other American mythologies as a symbol of emancipation. The vast deserts and windswept plains of the mythic West depicted individual opportunity and mobility inconceivable to many in post-war Europe. Luchino Visconti’s film Bellissima (1951) registers the lure commanded by the genre in Italy through a poverty-stricken mother (Anna Magnani) who is infatuated with the bounties on offer from the film industry. Her cry of ‘guarda guarda’ while watching Howard Hawks’s Western Red River (1948) expresses more than just wide-eyed admiration for Montgomery Clift. The romance of the big screen merges with a desire for the freedom of the mythical America on show. As Red River’s score segues into a shot of Cinecittà studios’ imposing façade, we see hordes of Italians desperate to play a part in this modernity, literally queuing to get in.49 It is perhaps tempting to interpret this aspirational engagement with American mythology in terms similar to those employed by David Brauer in reference to later trends of UK Pop Art: ‘a relationship […] analogous to standing outside the toy shop with one’s nose pressed against the glass’.50 As a symbolic description of the cinema screen through which Europeans gazed longingly at the excitement of a world so near and yet so far, this would be a convenient conceit. It is, however, inadequate to describe the complex interaction with these mythic structures in post-war Italy. Just as British Pop Art would in fact deploy Americana highly selectively, so Italy’s relationship with American mythologies – and specifically with the Western – is more appropriately seen as a process of cultural blending. As we shall see, this was most clearly demonstrated in the 1950s and 1960s by the domestic film industry. Precedents outside the cinematic medium, however, can be traced back as far as the early twentieth century, when Giacomo Puccini appropriated the myth of the Wild West for Italian opera in La fanciulla del West (1910). Puccini’s opera was billed as ‘a perfect fusion of the old world and the new’ prior to its New York premiere, for which the Metropolitan Opera House was bedecked with both the Italian tricolour and the Stars and Stripes. It would however become the subject of cultural controversy on both sides of the Atlantic. US critics, expecting a faithful representation of American customs, were dismayed at the inauthentic and exotic treatment afforded Californian culture. A reviewer in the Evening World wrote:\n\n24\n\nRadical Frontiers in the Spaghetti Western\n\nThere is nothing American about the score of La fanciulla del West except a suggestion of ragtime, and the suave, mellifluous Italian phrases fall strangely upon the ears from the mouths of the rough and uncouth miners in a camp of forty-niners in California.51 Conversely, when the production reached Rome in 1911 it was the centrepiece of the fiftieth anniversary celebrations of the Kingdom of Italy, and billed as a sign of the quality of contemporary Italian music. The musical establishment, however, expressed dismay that the country’s pre-eminent composer was neglecting Italian subject matter and imitating modern fashions. In 1915 one Florentine critic wrote (in an early example of disapproval at Hollywood’s influence upon Italian culture) that La fanciulla del West was ‘a rather tedious medley of Viennese operetta with a dash of Wagner and authentic north-American film music’.52 Italy’s relationship with the ‘America’ of the Western myth was, at least amongst the cultural elite, therefore one of adaptation and fusion more than linear imitation from its earliest incarnation. The setting of the ‘Wild West’ was a contentious repository for issues concerning national identity, on both sides of the Atlantic. Alexandra Wilson argues of the reaction afforded Puccini’s production: It tells us more about the inferiority complexes of contemporary Americans and Italians than […] about Puccini’s opera itself. The USA and Italy were both relatively new nations craving a sense of common culture, and Fanciulla was dragged into the project to invent two very different national identities.53 Recalling Forgacs’s suggestion that ‘Americanisation is […] a symptom of anxieties about one’s own national identity’54 we can see that, in 1910, this was a two-way process. Italian critics were already wary of ‘Americanisms’ corrupting their nation’s popular culture, but so too did American critics disapprove of their national foundation myth being corrupted and misinterpreted by foreign influences. Admittedly, by the post-war era this relationship was considerably less equal, and the appropriation of the Western myth in Italy reflected the imbalance; this time in the popular culture of the news stand, with the comic strip Tex Willer. Italian comics, or fumetti,55 had been used for propaganda purposes by the Fascist regime in such publications as Il giornale dei balilla and La piccola italiana. In 1939, foreign comics had been banned from publication. When the regime fell, and Hollywood films were released\n\nImagining America\n\n25\n\nin a deluge, so too American comics – Dick Tracy, The Phantom, Flash Gordon and Prince Valiant, among others – entered the Italian market en masse. The comics industry experienced a boom, and locally-authored fumetti imitating the motifs of American culture did not take long to exploit the situation. Milanese comic book author Gian Luigi Bonelli published Western fumetti entitled I tre Bill, Yuma Kid, Hondo and Rio Kid in 1948. In September of that year he and illustrator Aurelio Galleppini released the first fumetto featuring Tex Willer. Texas Ranger, defender of the weak and righteous dispenser of frontier justice, Willer’s adventures were ostensibly imitative and affectionate nods to the instantly recognisable locale of Hollywood’s Wild West. The landscape through which Tex Willer travels, however, shows this romantic evocation of a mythic America being absorbed into a more parochial representation, and adapted to the local market. The vast landscapes of the American West were by this time indelibly etched into the popular imagination on both sides of the Atlantic. John Ford’s repeated and spectacular framings immortalised the distinctive buttes of Monument Valley, continuing an aesthetic tradition stretching back to the vivid descriptions of James Fenimore Cooper and the paintings of Frederic Remington and Charles Russell. Galleppini’s decision to eschew this universally recognisable imagery in favour of the mountains, valleys and gorges of the Dolomites, Trentino and his native Sardinia was therefore significant. Though on one hand Tex Willer displays a fascination with the Western myth in post-war Italy, it also betrays a sense, however subconsciously, of disorientation and a desire to situate this imaginary ‘America’ in a familiar locale. Pertinently, Stuart Hall writes: When we think of or imagine cultural identity, we tend to ‘see’ it in a place, in a setting, as part of an imaginary landscape or ‘scene’. We give it a background, we put it in a frame, in order to make sense of it.56 The sense of displacement by transatlantic models in the post-war era is therefore expressed through adapting and localising the Western’s traditional iconography. We shall see that, even when US popular culture was seemingly imitated by Italians, it was frequently relocated culturally (and in the case of Tex Willer, physically). The myth of the Wild West remained highly attractive throughout Europe during the 1950s, and by 1960 the second most popular European cartoon character after Tintin was the cowboy Lucky Luke. Tony Judt comments that in West Germany, ‘millions […] learned about cowboys\n\n26\n\nRadical Frontiers in the Spaghetti Western\n\nfrom paperback novels written by local authors who had never been to America. […] America, real or imagined, was becoming the natural setting for light entertainment of all genres’.57 In Italy, even Carlo Lizzani, who in 1948 had roundly condemned American genre cinema, was by the 1960s making Westerns. As La fanciulla del West and Tex Willer suggest, however, this was by no means a one-way process of displacement, in which Italians uncritically imitated Hollywood’s motifs. Italian appropriation of the Western, as with that of American popular culture more generally, was one of cultural relocation. Unsurprisingly, this point is most vividly illustrated by developments within the Italian film industry. Here, issues concerning fascination with America, ‘colonisation’ by America (and the various implications of this terminology) and of appropriation and adaptation of ‘America’ and its mythological structures converge most clearly. Transatlantic Appropriation in the Italian Film Industry In 1953, William K. Everson observed with some amusement an emergent craze in European cinema: since the end of the War, Italians, Germans and even Russians had started to produce home-grown Western movies.58 As Christopher Frayling has outlined in detail, Italians had in fact been making Westerns ever since Vincenzo Leone – father of Sergio – made La vampira Indiana in 1913.59 In 1942, while the Fascist regime was still intact, local interpretations of the West, influenced by Puccini’s, emerged with Carl Koch’s Una signora dell’Ovest and Giorgio Ferroni’s Il fanciullo del West. Everson’s article refers to Italian versions of Wild Bill Hickok in what Frayling refers to as ‘carbon-copies of Hollywood “B” features’.60 The very existence of these films, as well as the ongoing popularity of the Tex Willer fumetti, gives us an indication of the Western myth’s uninterrupted appeal in Italy. Given the ubiquity of Hollywood imagery in Italy from the 1920s onwards, and especially the deluge of American films after 1946, such imitative phenomena were perhaps to be expected. The subsequent boom in Western production which occurred in the 1960s, however, was peculiar for its remarkable scale. Three Westerns were made in Italy in 1961, one in 1962 and five in 1963. In 1964, 32 were released, and by 1968 the annual rate had risen to 73.61 Though many of the films of this explosion – especially some of the earliest ones – did their utmost to resemble the American product, we shall see that this exponential growth cannot adequately be explained in terms of transatlantic influence alone. This is not to say that the Italian film industry in this period was free from pressures exerted by Hollywood; quite the opposite, but by the 1950s this\n\nImagining America\n\n27\n\nrelationship had become one of exchange (both financial and cultural) more than domination. We have seen that Italian society negotiated with American cultural imports with a mixture of enthusiasm, bewilderment and hostility as it recovered in the post-war years. So too the domestic film industry’s rehabilitation occurred through processes of imitation and appropriation, but also resistance to Hollywood practices and formats. Indeed, cinema itself became one of the most contentious sites of the cultural and political debates surrounding the increasing influence of American culture on Italian life. In the immediate post-war years, the direction of the film industry was high on the agenda for the major political parties. For their part, the PCI extended their drive to persuade workers that art, literature and philosophy were superior to capitalist mass culture into both a denunciation of Hollywood cinema – whose proliferation was an increasing concern – and a promotion of the socially conscientious works of the ‘neorealist’ trend. This campaign was predicated on the notion that such native film-making was an expression of a genuine Italian political culture, in opposition to the anaesthetising effects exerted upon the proletariat by Hollywood. In 1948, the party’s cultural commission was founded in a resolution entitled ‘For the preservation of Italian culture’, while L’Unità published a collective manifesto entitled ‘Defend our cinema!’62 Such a perspective was perhaps understandable given the intentions of the occupying Americans after the War. The Allied Military Government inaugurated the flood of Hollywood films in 1946, and set up the Film Board to address the future of the Italian cinema industry. At the Board’s opening meeting its president Admiral Stone announced: The so-called Italian cinema industry was invented by the fascists. Therefore it must be suppressed, as must be the instruments that incorporated this invention. All of them, Cinecittà included. […] Anyway, Italy is a farming country, what does it need a cinema industry for? 63 The occupying forces thus aimed quite openly to monopolise the market with American films, and to dominate native industries throughout Western Europe. Rome’s Cinecittà studios – the largest and most modern in Europe – had been bombed by the advancing Allies and plundered by the retreating Germans, and were used as refugee accommodation as hostilities ceased. Resourceful Italian directors such as Roberto Rossellini (who took to the ruined streets to shoot Roma città aperta (1945) with salvaged film stock)\n\n28\n\nRadical Frontiers in the Spaghetti Western\n\nwere understandably championed as a politically enlightened alternative to Hollywood by politicians for whom American cinema represented cultural atrophy. As we have already seen, for its part the DC was happy to see American films flood into the country, helping to foster a consensus which viewed the United States as the touchstone for Italy’s post-war recovery. The emergent trend of ‘neorealist’ films, full of the miseries of working-class life, on the other hand, were viewed with undisguised hostility for their subversive representations of Italian society. Giulio Andreotti, as Under-Secretary for Entertainment from 1947 to 1953, oversaw the refurbishment of Fascist laws to hand considerable control over cinema to the government. Scripts, budgets and personnel had to be vetted before a film could secure loans from the state, or even gain distribution and exhibition licences. The Church also exerted a strong influence over the exhibition sector, controlling the output of rural parish cinemas. Neorealist tales of poverty and crime were seen to be thoroughly inappropriate while, as Gundle writes, ‘upbeat American comedies and Westerns were deemed eminently suitable for family audiences and were often preferred to Italian films for showing in the parish cinemas’.64 Andreotti was unequivocal in his vision of Italian cinema’s way forward: ‘Less rags, more legs.’65 That these stark oppositions were drawn by the main political parties is symptomatic of the polarisation of Italian (and world) politics as the Cold War intensified. In truth, however, the picture was not as black-and-white as this dispute suggested. To analyse the issue (as did influential figures in both major political parties) as a dichotomy of socially progressive Italian ‘art’ cinema and escapist American ‘genre’ cinema was to make a series of erroneous presuppositions: firstly, that genre cinema was inherently a transatlantic borrowing; secondly, that popular genres were devoid of political meaning; thirdly, that the worlds of ‘art’ and ‘popular’ cinema were mutually exclusive; and fourthly, that the success of genre cinema in the 1950s and 1960s amounted to a displacement of native creativity by US models. I do not wish to dwell unduly on the party political squabble whose dualistic stances invited such readings. By addressing these issues one by one, however, the remainder of this chapter will briefly survey the history of Italian cinema to arrive at the Spaghetti Westerns of the 1960s. This genre, perhaps above all others, suggests that the post-war relationship between the Italian and American film industries was one of cultural exchange.\n\nImagining America\n\n29\n\ni) Genre Cinema’s Italian Roots Viewing ‘genre’ or ‘entertainment’ cinema as an Americanism, as many in the PCI did, was a fundamental misreading of the history of Italian filmmaking. Before the Great War, Italy dominated the world market with spectacular films for a mass audience such as Giovanni Pastrone’s La caduta di Troia (1910) and Cabiria (1914), Mario Caserini’s Gli ultimi giorni di Pompeii (1913) and Enrico Guazzoni’s Quo Vadis (1913). These ‘sword and sandal’ historical epics were trailblazers in the early days of cinematography. Cabiria in particular, employing lateral tracking shots and unprecedented special effects, was an innovative contribution to cinematic language before the advent of Hollywood’s hegemony. As the reaction to La fanciulla del West indicates, the cultural relationship between Italy and the USA at this time was one of exchange, and Pastrone’s film directly and immediately inspired DW Griffith. Viewing Cabiria convinced Griffith that feature-length films could be financially viable in America, and in the same year he displayed this debt to Italian cinema with his biblical epic Judith of Bethulia (1914).66 Intolerance (1916), too, borrowed heavily from Cabiria in its Babylon sequence. ii) Italian Genre Cinema and Politics US influence on Italian cinema increased exponentially after the Great War. Before we address the issue of political engagement in Italian genres, we must therefore take into account this shift in the transatlantic relationship from one of equality to one of subordination. That Italians had instigated popular genres did not mean that they continued to exert command over their output, and the Americans soon monopolised the ‘sword and sandal’ film. The decline of the Italian film industry in the 1920s, indeed, was largely due to the domination of Hollywood. In 1923 Fred Niblo came to Rome to shoot Ben Hur with American money then completed the project in America, sapping the Italian industry of funds. There is disagreement over the precise statistics, but there is no doubting that film production in Italy declined alarmingly from a position of strength in 1920 so that, by the decade’s end, annual output was in single figures.67 Meanwhile, 80 per cent of releases on the Italian market in the 1920s were from Hollywood.68 Until the mid 1930s the Fascist regime was content to indulge a growing fascination with Hollywood products, which were highly profitable and broadly thought to be a pacifying influence against subversive tendencies. This is not to say that Mussolini wholly overlooked the political potential of cinema, but newsreels and documentaries inserted as ‘B’ features alongside more popular films were the regime’s preferred form of propaganda. Indeed, this tactic – appeasing the public taste for Americana while hoping\n\n30\n\nRadical Frontiers in the Spaghetti Western\n\nthat they would pay attention to the ideological accompaniment – was one also favoured by both Josef Göbbels and Lenin. When, in 1937, Mussolini officially opened the imposing Cinecittà69 studio complex in Rome’s Via Tuscolana, a giant banner draped across the building’s façade announced ‘la cinematografia è l’arma più forte’ (‘cinematography is the most powerful weapon’), paraphrasing a quotation attributed to Lenin.70 During the Russian Civil War of 1918–22 the Bolsheviks had invented the agitka: a short propagandist film, taken around the countryside by train to spread the word to the illiterate masses. Lenin saw that Russia’s huge peasant class was both passive and pliable. In such a multilingual culture where religious iconography played a significant role, the moving image was seen to be a potent instrument. In Italy where, as late as 1951, the illiteracy rate in the largely agrarian South was 24.8 per cent,71 Lenin’s views on cinema’s political power were potentially resonant. The grandeur of Cinecittà’s opening ceremony, however, was testament to Mussolini’s penchant for spectacle and rhetoric more than a genuine advocacy of these sentiments: a grandiloquent declaration of the regime’s volte-face in the mid 1930s in its attitude towards the domestic film industry and the impact of Hollywood imports. In 1935, the Centro Sperimentale film school was opened and the Venice Film Festival introduced an award reserved exclusively for Italian films. Cinecittà was the centrepiece and symbol of this renewed drive for a strong national industry, free of American influence. In 1938 Hollywood films were banned from distribution. From its inception, however, Cinecittà was intended to be a replica of Hollywood’s studio system, producing mass-appeal genre films. American practices and models of modernity were therefore emulated and adapted to the native culture, even by a government which outwardly sought to nullify them.72 Despite the bombast and ceremony of this drive for cinematic autarchy, the potential of genre cinema as a ‘powerful weapon’ was not appreciated much beyond the symbolic purpose of strengthening the national industry. Doubtless, this was largely due to the difficulties of persuading a public fascinated by American popular culture to sit through doctrinaire polemics, but also betrayed Mussolini’s dismissive attitude towards the political possibilities of genre cinema. It is perhaps no surprise, then, that seemingly innocuous formula films of the Fascist era, such as Alessandro Blasetti’s La corona di ferro (1941), managed to smuggle subversive content beneath the government’s radar by virtue of their ‘popular’ tag. As we have seen, though American genres came to dominate output in the 1920s, Italy itself had a rich history of ‘genre cinema’. Looking back through\n\nImagining America\n\n31\n\nthis history, we see a tradition that had in fact been addressing local mores or confronting political issues from its inception. Cabiria itself was co-written by the ultra nationalist author Gabrielle d’Annunzio. The film’s depiction of the Second Punic War between Rome and Carthage had topical ideological overtones, released as Italy conquered the North African provinces of Cyrenacia and Tripolitania. When a minor character from Cabiria – the slave Maciste, played by Bartolomeo Pagano – then became immensely popular in a series of films celebrating his superhuman strength, he was recruited into the government’s drive to rally the Italian people in the Great War (Maciste alpino (1916) depicts the muscle-bound superhero single-handedly defeating the Austrian army). In the Fascist era, too, though largely overlooked by officialdom, genre cinema offered a vehicle for political theses. Angela Dalle Vacche highlights the continuity of imperialist ambitions through comparing Cabiria with Carmine Gallone’s similarly allegorical Scipio Africanus (1937), released during Mussolini’s Abyssinian adventure.73 Marcia Landy records that La corona di ferro, in depicting a tyrant’s abuse of power just after Italy had entered the Second World War on Mussolini’s whim, was condemned by Josef Göbbels for its pacifist stance: The potential for such a [political] reading was not lost on him. […] The adoption of a genre mode with its penchant for fantasy does not preclude the film’s critique of the present. By combining spectacle with the thematic treatment of power, the film’s politics are less censurable.74 While overt criticism of the regime was often met with imprisonment, apparently harmless films like La corona di ferro and Ferdinando Poggioli’s Le sorelle materassi (1944) were able to secrete their satire from Mussolini’s cultural radar. Clearly, the notion that genre cinema was intrinsically a politically vacuous art form was dubious to say the least. Nevertheless, after the War, Mussolini’s view of feature films would be echoed by Giulio Andreotti, who saw cinema’s function as being one of ‘calming the spirits’.75 So too did the PCI consider popular cinema to be an ideologically soporific influence. As we have seen, the politically-committed works of the ‘neorealist’ trend were adopted by the PCI and reviled by the DC in equal measure, viewed by both as the antithesis to Hollywood genres. In this way, the PCI’s campaign in defence of native working-class culture was translated into the cinematic medium. The third issue raised by this dispute – the extent to which ‘art’\n\n32\n\nRadical Frontiers in the Spaghetti Western\n\ncinema and popular genres could be viewed as separate entities – is brought into focus by the very films championed by the Communists. iii) The Blurred Boundaries of Neorealism In 1945 scriptwriter Cesare Zavattini declared that, in 20 years of Fascism, Italian studios ‘have not even produced one film, I insist: not even one’.76 This is indicative of a trend amongst critics, politicians and film-makers who wished to escape the nation’s recent traumas by declaring a rupture in Italian cinema, condemning ‘Fascist’ films as irredeemably corrupt (and even, it seems, dismissing their very existence). A new progressive aesthetic, addressing the German occupation, the Resistance, the hunger and the unemployment of the War and its aftermath through documentary realism was seen by those within the Left as the means to start afresh. Italian cinema was to be reclaimed from the discredited regime. Subsequent critical analyses, however, have highlighted the extent to which this ‘neorealism’, as it would later become known, was neither a rupture from the past nor a movement at variance with the world of ‘genre’ cinema. Indeed, it was never a ‘movement’ at all, but a heterogeneous trend of films which broadly portrayed social deprivation from a leftist political stance. Pierre Leprohon emphasises that ‘the seeds of realism had […] been germinating for many years before the fall of the regime allowed them to burst into full flower’.77 Stylistically, if not politically, neorealism owed much to Fascist-era film-making. The state-run production house Istituto Nazionale LUCE had been perfecting documentary techniques since 1922 and, while the regime was still intact, Alessandro Blasetti, Luchino Visconti and Roberto Rossellini had experimented with non-professional actors, onlocation shooting and documentary footage. All of these would later be ascribed as key features of the post-war neorealist trend. Sorlin argues that, ‘as soon as one looks for precise criteria, Neorealism vanishes’,78 since there is little consensus over what exactly the word means, or which films make up the trend’s canon. If – as is commonly assumed – the foregrounding of non-professional actors is a criterion, for example, then Rossellini’s Roma, città aperta must be excluded for its employment of comic stars Anna Magnani and Aldo Fabrizi. More importantly for the purposes of this volume, if evidence that Hollywood genres had influenced a film precludes it, then neorealism becomes a very sparse category indeed. Many of the most successful examples displayed precisely such transatlantic hybridity. Wagstaff, Bondanella and Wood list such borrowings, including Senza pietà’s (1948) use of gangster film motifs, the film noir elements of Gioventù perduta (1949), the adoption of the Western’s archetypes in In nome\n\nImagining America\n\n33\n\ndella legge (1949) and Il cammino della speranza (1950) and the melodrama intrinsic to the plots of many ‘neorealist’ films such as I ladri di biciclette (1948) and Riso amaro (1949).79 The latter film in particular drew a severe reaction from the Left both for this assimilation of genre cinema and for its indulgence in erotic titillation by employing a former Miss Italy (Silvana Mangano) in the lead role (the critic Guido Aristarco lamented that ‘workers cannot be educated with the legs of Silvana’80). The term neorealismo rosa (‘pink neorealism’) was coined to categorise a popular81 category of film which merged the proletarian focus of neorealism with techniques of melodrama to dilute the revolutionary agenda and increase an audience’s emotional investment. This blending of ‘art’ and ‘genre’ cinema which characterised the Italian industry’s output in the 1950s and 1960s is often viewed as the ‘crisis of neorealism’, whereby the movement capitulated in the face of the public’s desire for Hollywood products.82 The process, however, can equally be seen in terms of continuity and evolution, when viewed from the perspective of Italian genre cinema itself. Marcia Landy, for example, identifies a continuum from popular pre-war cinema such as Blasetti’s and Poggioli’s films, through neorealism and into the 1950s, of social criticism in both ‘art’ and ‘genre’ cinema. Her argument refutes analyses approaching the two spheres in oppositional terms: ‘The ethical and investigative spirit of neorealism was not abandoned; rather there was a greater exploration of the conditions and nature of realism in more complex and philosophical terms, often in the vein of comedy and satire.’83 The flowering of the commedia all’italiana (‘comedy Italian style’) from the mid 1950s owed much to the ‘pink neorealist’ precedent earlier in the decade. It combined, as Ellwood writes in reference to Un americano a Roma, ‘the post-war neo-realist tradition of Rossellini and De Sica and a much older music hall and comic magazine tradition of slapstick’.84 Comedies by Steno, Luigi Comencini, Mario Monicelli and Dino Risi thus merged ‘high’ and ‘low’ Italian culture to satirise the system presiding over the Economic Miracle and the emergent individualism of the new Italy. By the 1950s, then, Italian genre cinema had absorbed influences wholly separate from transatlantic borrowings. The rich and varied history of a national cinema interrogating and reflecting contemporary preoccupations in fact converged with the ubiquitous American formats. Certainly, the film industry itself did not view the matter in dualistic terms of ‘high’ and ‘low’ culture. Though it is commonly thought that neorealism was a deeply unpopular category of film-making, the box-office figures suggest that it held its own in the domestic market. Roma città aperta\n\n34\n\nRadical Frontiers in the Spaghetti Western\n\nfor example, topped the charts for 1945–46. Out of the 53 Italian films released in 1946–47, Il bandito came fourth, Vivere in pace sixth, Paisà ninth and Il sole sorge ancora twelfth. Still, by 1949, In nome della legge was coming third.85 As the volume of American imports and Italian productions both increased, neorealism’s share of the home market did indeed dwindle. By the mid 1950s, however, an Italian film could make up to 40 per cent of its receipts from the export market, and it was the critically lauded, prize-winning works of neorealism which had opened the door to such profits.86 In economic terms, a dichotomy between ‘high’ and ‘low’ culture was therefore an irrelevance, since Italian films all belonged to the same marketing strategy. This export-driven outlook saw Italy transform, in the words of Christopher Wagstaff, ‘from a producer of essentially “Italian” films for an art house public to a major exporter of popular genre films for a mass audience’.87 It is therefore clear that the sectarian disputes which surrounded Italian cinema in the post-war years encouraged a dichotomous view at variance with the underlying realities of the industry and its production practices. Firstly, popular genre cinema of this era should not be interpreted exclusively in terms of transatlantic influence, since it fused this with a rich continuum of Italian formulae. Secondly, while US genres came to dominate output and the major Italian political parties from the 1920s onwards consistently viewed these as politically anodyne, this concealed a tradition of ideological engagement dating back to the earliest days of the Italian industry. Thirdly, the widely respected films emerging from post-war Italy were not produced in a vacuum, and frequently displayed narrative, ethical and industrial affinities with those films commonly labelled ‘popular’. These historical and cultural factors converged in the emergence of a new wave of genres (known locally as filoni) in the 1950s. It is to this phenomenon that I now turn, in order to analyse the final issue under consideration in this chapter: was the proliferation and success of these formulaic, internationally-oriented films a sign that Italian culture had been displaced by a globalised outlook and homogeneous ‘Americanisation’? Or are these films a sign that, just as post-war Italian society’s ‘Americanisation’ was neither universal nor a case of mere imitation, so too the film industry’s experience was one of negotiation and appropriation? iv) Industry, Filoni, and Spaghetti Westerns Though the DC broadly welcomed the influx of American cinema in the post-war years, the government’s policies were by no means subservient to Hollywood’s desires and Andreotti was fully aware of the economic\n\nImagining America\n\n35\n\nadvantages of a strong local industry. In 1949 screen quotas were introduced, stipulating that for 20 days each quarter every cinema had to show Italian films. Additionally, legislation was passed insisting that all future revenues in the Italian market from American films must be reinvested in Italy. The bare statistics paint a picture of remarkable recovery, which mirrored that of the economy. Cinema attendance across the Western world haemorrhaged between 1946 and 1955, yet in the same period both Italian audience figures and the number of commercially operating cinemas in the country nearly doubled.88 In 1952 Italy became Europe’s leading centre of film production, and by the 1960s the nation’s output rivalled that of Hollywood itself. 89 The Italian cinema industry in the 1950s and 1960s operated, despite Mussolini’s efforts, on a very different model from the Hollywood studio system. A fragmented approach to film-making saw production, distribution and exhibition operating as separate sectors, each aiming to reach as wide an audience as possible to exploit popular trends for maximum profit. Filoni broadly appealed to the ‘mass’ audience (that is, one which traverses all social classes), via three exhibition sectors: prima visione (‘first run’ cinemas in large cities), seconda visione (showing the same films on their ‘second run’ and a selection of cheaper films) and terza visione (the thousands of ‘third run’ open-air, parish or independent cinemas, largely in rural areas). Though economic factors had brought the worlds of ‘art’ cinema and ‘genre’ cinema into the same marketing strategy, competition from American imports also helped polarise film-making into high-budget and low-budget outputs, even within individual filoni. An entire production sector therefore arose which was aimed exclusively at seconda and terza visione outlets. This ‘popular’ audience (that is, a working-class one) would therefore be consuming many films which had never been released in large cities, and which were tailored to offer formulaic entertainment to guarantee returns.90 The vast terza visione sector was not only a significant sub-culture of Italian film distribution, but also a sphere whose preferences were often at variance with mainstream culture in the 1950s. Gundle illustrates the more parochial outlook inherent to this category of film-going by analysing the extent to which the Hollywood star system was emulated in Italy. American stars had been a source of fascination and aspiration since the 1920s, and provided models of modernity to which many Italian actors aspired. Silvana Mangano, for instance, was labelled a ‘Rita Hayworth of the Italian periphery’ by Giuseppe De Santis,91 anticipating Jean Baudrillard’s observation that ‘American is the original version of modernity. [Europeans] are the dubbed or subtitled version’.92 Alongside such emulation, however, were those, such as the unmistakably Italian Anna Magnani, who bore little resemblance to\n\n36\n\nRadical Frontiers in the Spaghetti Western\n\ntransatlantic models. She was described as ‘a star for the audiences of thirdrun cinemas’.93 Gundle explains that such domestic stars ‘appealed not because they were distant but because they were close to their audiences. They […] provided symbols of continuity with the past combined with varying elements of change during a period of immense, disorienting social and economic development’.94 Much as Tex Willer betrayed unease at a perceived displacement of native culture in the post-war years, so the popular audiences of the terza visione sector were not entirely in thrall to American models. With this industrial context in mind, Angela Dalle Vacche differentiates filoni from Hollywood ‘genres’ as ‘well-planned investments of the industry into a regulated, but also stimulating, oscillation between repetition and difference, convention and invention’.95 The singular form filone literally translates as ‘tradition’ or ‘vein’, but also hints at ‘filo’, meaning ‘thread’. Unlike a Hollywood genre, which is defined by a common theme, historical period or iconography but whose constituent parts are often diverse, filoni relied on rapid repetition and imitation of successful formulae: what Wagstaff dubs ‘safe bets’ for the industry.96 Roman studios – most notably Cinecittà and Elios – responded to the hegemony of Hollywood by churning out as many films, and making as much money, as was possible from variations on a popular theme before it lost its mass appeal. Between the early 1950s and the late 1960s, a succession of these cheaply-made, short-lived and often overlapping generic cycles proliferated. Comedies, spy stories, farces, peplums97 and Westerns flooded the market in turn, often on the back of a popular American genre or film. International co-production, mostly with France, Germany and Spain, also gave filoni the means to compete with Hollywood in two markets at once.98 In producing hastily-shot, low budget formulae aimed at the mass and the popular audiences, the domestic and the export markets, Roman studios were certainly emphasising the ‘industry’ in ‘film industry’. Pier Paolo Pasolini, indeed, described Cinecittà’s assembly line as ‘the belching stomach of Italy’.99 As the filone phenomenon’s reactive nature demonstrates, behind the resurgence of the domestic industry lay a complex relationship between Italy and the USA. Though the infrastructure was divergent from the American model, filoni showed that production practices in certain sectors were becoming more streamlined and efficient. Frayling demonstrates that the revolution in consumerism since the arrival of television in 1954 was palpable in such films’ assembly line circumstances:\n\nImagining America\n\n37\n\n[They] resembled those of Hollywood ‘B’ features, or even TV series: shooting schedules which seldom over-ran a five- or six-week norm; budgets averaging below $20,000; the more solid sets used over and over again; only two or three ‘takes’ per shot; post-synchronised sound and dialogue tracks […] and the same pieces of action footage frequently turning up in ‘disguised’ form.100 While mainstream analysis of the American Western tends to overlook Republic’s ‘B’ features of the 1930s, Peter Stanfield has demonstrated how their interplay of Western iconography and Depression-era maladies kept the genre afloat by addressing the immediate concerns of lower-class audiences in rapidly-produced series following familiar heroes.101 The quick production turnover of the filoni similarly offered a potential responsiveness to topical themes which prestige productions could not match. As the terza visione sector’s emphasis on comforting familiarity suggests, these Italian films represent an equivalent underbelly, pulling in audiences with regular instalments of popular heroes’ adventures. Frayling’s comparison with television is also pertinent. Christopher Wagstaff insists that, when analysing such formulaic cinema, the assumptions of traditional film theory alone – that the individual film, as the object of the viewer’s attention, is the unit worthy of study – are not sufficient. He advocates practices more commonly associated with television studies concerning the social function of cinema-going, as a model offering a more faithful deconstruction of the terza visione sector’s ongoing dialogue with provincial audiences.102 Elsewhere, Wagstaff points out that television viewers did not identify individual hour-long ‘Kojak’ episodes by their titles, but knew them as weekly appointments with the iconic hero.103 International filone distribution followed this pattern, so that individual films were tailored to suit the demands of different export markets. For example, Giacomo Gentilomo’s Peplum Maciste e la regina di Samar (1964) was marketed in America as Hercules Against the Moon Men. Maciste and Hercules were interchangeable heroes – both taciturn, muscular and clad in loincloths – but Hercules was the more popular in America, and therefore the ‘safest bet’ for the Italian exporters. Investment, as well as distribution, showed that the influence of America was still strong. Though the 1949 legislation locked earnings from foreign films released in Italy into local film production, this did not discourage Hollywood exploitation of the market. Instead, it forced American distributors to seek loopholes. A gamut of Italo-American co-productions over the ensuing 15 years saw Italy’s position in world cinema boom, while\n\n38\n\nRadical Frontiers in the Spaghetti Western\n\noffering considerable profits to Hollywood through ‘exporting’ the films back to America. Roman studios thus attracted large numbers of American actors and directors taking advantage of cheap, technically-skilled native crews and a ready-made industry infrastructure in a phenomenon dubbed ‘Hollywood on the Tiber’. Del Buono and Tornabuoni argue that the Americans enjoyed ‘the ease of living in a colony as if they were the bosses, and with greater freedom than in the controlled, moralist and McCarthyist Hollywood of the era’.104 Once again, we find the language of imperialism employed to describe the cultural relationship between Italy and America. So too, Michel de Certeau’s extension of this colonial conceit, whereby locals engage with and appropriate the dominant culture’s mythic structures, again applies. The above argument underlines the fact that conditions back in California were not entirely favourable for American film-making at the time. The Paramount decision of 1948 had broken up the major studios’ monopolisation of production and marketing. Declining cinema attendance was jeopardising domestic profits, while output was falling. US producers therefore needed to sell their films in Europe, whose markets were growing just as those in America declined. From 1950 onwards American films acquired 50 per cent of their earnings abroad, and Italy’s rapidly growing industry was a high priority.105 In other words, the Americans needed the Italians as much as the Italians needed them. US influence in the film industry, as in society, remained the most significant catalyst for change, but the relationship was not one of domination. Areas in which the industry appeared to imitate transatlantic habits in fact displayed, time and again, processes of cultural blending. The filoni of the 1950s and 1960s are the single most illustrative example of this. As the major US studios scaled down their output, the fusion of cultures in ‘Hollywood on the Tiber’ scored significant box-office successes with such ‘runaway’ productions as Mervyn LeRoy’s Quo Vadis (1951), Robert Wise’s Helen of Troy (1955) and William Wyler’s Ben Hur (1959). Budding Italian film-makers learnt their trade on these films’ sets alongside giants of the US industry (Sergio Leone, for example, worked on all three of the above ancient epics). The Italian peplum, with its irreverent, humorous take on Hollywood’s earnest grandeur, was therefore the archetypal filone, fusing the iconography of the ‘sword and sandal’ spectacles of early Italian cinema with contemporary Cinecittà/Hollywood epics, whose skilled local second unit crews it borrowed. The craze began with Pietro Francisci’s melting-pot of disparate Greek and Roman myths, Le fatiche di Ercole (1957). Both this and its sequel, Ercole e la regina di Lidia (1958), proved highly popular both\n\nImagining America\n\n39\n\ndomestically (especially in the terza visione sector) and abroad.106 Success spawned imitation, and the peplum remained an extremely lucrative formula into the early 1960s. Eccentric hybrids sent interchangeable muscle-bound heroes such as Ercole/Hercules, Samson, Ursus and (directly from Cabiria) Maciste into Norse sagas, pre-Revolutionary France and eighteenth-century Scotland, displaying the versatility (not to mention the humour) of this filone. The peplum ran out of steam when a series of financial disasters for Cinecittà peaked with Robert Aldrich’s Sodom and Gomorrah (1961) going wildly over budget and becoming beset by recriminations between the American director and his Italian crew (including second unit director and up-and-coming peplum-maker Sergio Leone). The film’s Italian producer Goffredo Lombardo recalled of the Americans: ‘They treated us with a certain disdain, as if we were underdogs, from a lower caste. When Italian film culture started to show signs of life, they did all they could to kill it stone dead.’107 ‘Hollywood on the Tiber’ imploded, and as American financiers pulled out, Cinecittà faced mass unemployment and an uncertain future. Though, in the 1960s, Italy had almost equal attendance figures to the combined markets of France, Germany and Britain,108 cinema began steadily to lose its monopoly on popular leisure to television from the beginning of the decade. At first, the number of operating cinemas dropped back only slightly,109 but annual attendance was decreasing at a more marked rate, while television was becoming ever more popular.110 Erosion of big city audiences in particular alarmed the industry, and a new filone was required to alleviate the crisis. The early 1960s therefore saw thrillers, Gothic horrors, swashbuckling adventures and Viking sagas, among countless other actionpacked formulae and hybrids, attempt to capture the imagination of the mass audience. The Roman studios’ future was heralded by the success in Italy of two European Westerns co-produced by Rialto Film of Hamburg and Jadran Film of Zagreb: Der Schatz im Silbersee (1962) and Winnetou I (1963). Adapted from the German novels of Karl May, directed by the Austrian Harald Reinl, shot in Yugoslavia and starring the American ex-Tarzan Lex Barker, these films displayed the profitable potential of an international ‘Wild West’. The production of American Westerns was in decline, but the genre had retained its appeal in the European marke"
