        "text": "STOCKHOLM â€” Ever since the idea of nations and nationality gained serious popularity in the 18th and 19th centuries, peoples across the world have asked themselves that most basic of questions: Who are we? For Swedes, the answer has, for the last 50 years, included some kind of notion of collectivist semi-socialism, with their country the epitome of a high- tax, strong-state, cradle-to-grave welfare society.\n\nBut that self-image is being turned on its head. A recently published and widely discussed book, provocatively titled \"Is the Swede a Human Being?\" (\"Ar svensken manniska?\"), contends that Swedes are the opposite of collectivists: they are deeply individualistic.\n\nThe authors, Lars Tragardh and Henrik Berggren, both historians, argue that Swedes are more individualistic even than Americans, those notional world champions of rugged, swaggering individualism. The welfare state, they say, is the prime proof of this.\n\n\"The main purpose of the Swedish system has been to maximize the individual's independence,\" Tragardh, who has spent most of his life in the United States, said in an interview. \"The picture of a collectivist animal is completely wrong; the modern Swede is a hyperindividualist.\"\n\nUnlike other classics in the \"who are we\" genre, like Luigi Barzini Jr.'s \"The Italians,\" the book by Tragardh and Berggren is not a collection of anecdotes and historical events. Nor is it an academic analysis of how modern Sweden came into being.\n\nInstead, it is a mix of literary history, political science and the sociology of love. The philosophers Immanuel Kant and Jean-Jacques Rousseau play prominent parts, as do Swedish authors and social engineers like Erik Gustaf Geijer and Alva Myrdal.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
