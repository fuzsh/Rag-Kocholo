For example, both organizations have contributed prize money to the John Ciardi Award for Lifetime Achievement in Poetry. This annual prize of $1,000, which is awarded through Italian Americana, recognizes an ItalianAmerican poet who has not only published books of poetry but who has also written critical essays and promoted the reading of poetry. Past honorees include Felix Stefanile, Lewis Turco, Jonathan Galassi, Sandra Gilbert, Jay Parini, Kim Addonizio, Daniela Giosefﬁ, and Lawrence Ferlinghetti. We would like to single out a woman who has worked for both NIAF and the Order Sons of Italy, for her competence, integrity, and devotion to things Italian American. That woman is Dona DeSanctis. She is always on the front lines—as was her late husband—in working to further the ideals of Italian-American culture. The journal owes a great deal to the vision of Joseph DeAngelis, the former Speaker of the House of Representatives of Rhode Island. When Italian Americana lost its support at Queens College, the journal, as a result of Mr. DeAngelis’s efforts, was able to resume publication at the University of Rhode Island / Providence. My gratitude to Richard Gambino, the founder of the journal, for trusting me to continue his journal, is boundless. To former dean Walter Crocker at URI / Providence, for having me publish out of the university, and to current viceprovost John McCray, for continuing this undertaking, my humble thanks. No book of this sort would be possible without the gifted authors who found their way to Italian Americana. I am in awe of their talent. Nor would this book be possible without Robert Oppedisano’s belief in the project. He was a dream to work with. ix\n\n................. 17066$\n\n$ACK\n\n08-13-08 15:35:47\n\nPS PAGE ix\n\nx acknowledgments\n\nLast, but hardly least, my thanks go to my family: to my parents, who understood the power of a good education; to my grandmother, some of whose great courage rubbed off on me; to my brother Tom and his wife, Lorrie, for all their support over the years; to my children, Ed and Sally, who continue the best of the tradition, and their children, Bennett, Max, Harry, Zachary, Sam, and Charlie, who bring such energy and joy into my life; and to my dear husband, Birge, who accompanies me on this journey of Italian-American culture. Carol Bonomo Albright Fi rst a nd f ore most I want to thank Carol Bonomo Albright for the opportunity to work with her on this project. I have encountered or reencountered a body of work that I have been thrilled to read, reread, consider, think about, enjoy, and help to contextualize. It has been a deep pleasure. Carol holds up an important corner of our Italian-American intellectual life, in our community and with her tireless work on Italian Americana. Without Robert Oppedisano, Wild Dreams: The Best of Italian Americana simply wouldn’t be. His strong and positive response to our proposal meant the world to Carol and me. Both Nick Frankovich and Mary-Lou Elias Pen ˜ a provided us with kind, helpful, quick, professional attention throughout this project. Carol Bonomo Albright and I thank both of them. Daria Masullo, my dear friend and quasi-nipota, took the manuscript over this summer and made it into a polished whole. Personally I want to thank Edi Giunta for creating a joyous Italian world for so many of us. Her generosity of spirit brings intellectual riches, friendship, and joy wherever she is. My life is better for having Edvige Giunta as my dear friend. My lunches with Maria Laurino have made my life larger and better, with our hours of talk of books, ﬁlms, writing, and especially of raising our sons. But most of all I want to acknowledge my wonderful family: my husband, Bill, without whom I could not have brought this book to completion, and James, whose writing and work I am watching arrive in the world alongside his father’s and mother’s.

This historical and cultural journal followed the wave of interest in Italian Americans that had been building in the previous decade and that became particularly strong that year owing to Gambino’s book, Blood of My Blood: The Dilemma of the Italian-Americans. He elucidated the culture of the family and community in the lives of Italian Americans and wove personal experiences ‘‘typical and illustrative of the Italian-American saga’’ through his historical and sociological scholarship (vii). He particularly feared that young Italian Americans, not knowing the foundations of their heritage, had no means of achieving an authentic identity. Blood of My Blood received rave reviews from the New York Times Book Review, the New Republic, and other inﬂuential papers and magazines. As the New York Times Book Review wrote, ‘‘With greater impact than any other nonﬁction book on the subject has achieved to date, it weaves together the history, sociology and psychology of ﬁrst, second, and third generation Italian-Americans.’’ Michael Novak commented, ‘‘It sets the cultural agenda for the seventies.’’ Like any classic, Blood of My Blood remains pertinent today. With the rise of the civil rights movement and the great popularity of the television program Roots, based on the book by Alex Haley, ethnics began to explore their own heritage and were willing to talk publicly about it—something new to Italian Americans whose parents urged them to keep everything about the family in the family. Additionally, by then Italian Americans in sufﬁcient numbers had received Ph.D.s and were represented in the academy. Already in the late 1960s, a small group of Italian-American scholars had met at the initiative of Rudolph Vecoli to discuss forming an academic association devoted to ItalianAmerican studies. This resulted in the founding of the American Italian Historical Association (AIHA) in 1969. 1\n\n................. 17066$\n\nINTR\n\n08-13-08 15:35:53\n\nPS PAGE 1\n\n2 introduction\n\nThe time seemed right to ride the crest of this wave and publish a journal devoted to the Italian-American experience, wherein Italian Americans would record and document their history, literature, and culture. The journal, Italian Americana, was housed at Queens College, where Gambino taught, and was not at ﬁrst connected to AIHA. From its beginning, Italian Americana brought out not only the historical articles and book reviews that other such newly initiated ethnic journals published but also included ﬁction, memoirs, and poetry. Gambino reasoned that this latter trio of genres ﬁlled out in a human way what history teaches us about a group. In a word, literature puts meat on the bones of history. In 1989 the two remaining founders of Italian Americana turned over the publication and editorship of the journal to me, Carol Bonomo Albright. It was to be published in cooperation with the University of Rhode Island, which, through the ofﬁce of the then–Rhode Island Speaker of the House, Joseph DeAngelis, had received a modest legislative grant to fund publication. Professor Bruno Arcudi, the other founding member, would continue at the journal as associate editor. John Paul Russo was, and remains, book review editor. Later I invited Dana Gioia to be poetry editor. He served from 1994 until 2003, when he stepped down to become chairman of the National Endowment for the Arts. Mr. Gioia selected the poems published during those years, while Michael Palma, his successor, is responsible for selecting the poems after 2003. The date at the beginning of each selection in this anthology refers to the year Italian Americana published the piece. After an intermittent publishing schedule and a three-and-a-half-year hiatus, Italian Americana resumed publication in the fall of 1990. I gladly continued Gambino’s policy of presenting history, ﬁction, memoirs, poetry, and reviews, adding a play and an opera libretto, together with an interview of the composer of the opera (which went on to win a National Opera Association competition). The opera reﬂected Italian Americans’ expanding entry into all the arts occurring during the years in which Italian Americana was publishing. Meanwhile, AIHA had grown to include all disciplines connected with Italian Americans, including literary analysis. In the late 1980s, led by Professor Richard Juliani, the board of AIHA decided that the journal under my editorship would be published in cooperation with the association but would receive no funding from it. The publication of the twenty-ﬁfth volume, in the magazine’s thirty-third year of its existence, should be recognized not only to celebrate its occurrence but also to provide an opportunity to reﬂect on the past and the changing nature of Italian-American literature. While Italian Americana has published hundreds of works, including historical articles as well as literature, I felt that this anthology should reprint in one volume a sampling of Italian-American literature exemplifying the best work the journal has published, great literature that could easily be included in ethnic studies and American literature as well as composition and writing courses, and that would be of interest to the general public.\n\n................. 17066$\n\nINTR\n\n08-13-08 15:35:53\n\nPS PAGE 2\n\nintroduction\n\n3\n\nNot only have programs in Italian-American studies spread across the country, they are also now moving across the ocean to what our ancestors called ‘‘the other side’’—Italy. The general public, I am sure, will ﬁnd the literature compelling, not only because everyone loves a good story, well told (and which can be read on a number of levels), but also because, with society’s growing emphasis on diversity, readers will perceive an authentic experience of what it means to be Italian American in the twenty-ﬁrst century, in all its various manifestations. The authors in this anthology are some of the people who shaped such a literature. By juxtaposing canonical writers like John Fante with emerging writers in this volume, we not only illustrate the dynamic process by which a literature is formed but also demonstrate a solid tradition that has continued within an evolutionary ﬂowering. But beyond describing this evolutionary process, from its beginnings the authors displayed, in referring to Europe and Italy in particular, a cosmopolitanism that American authors rarely reﬂect. Dana Gioia discusses this quality most especially in Italian-American poetry in his article ‘‘What Is ItalianAmerican Poetry?’’ in the Academy of American Poets newsletter. Both these characteristics, evolution and cosmopolitanism, are seen in Ben Morreale’s ‘‘The Prince of Racalmuto’’ and Michael Maschio’s ‘‘The Actor Prepares.’’ Evolutionary differences are seen in the treatment of the same subject matter, that of identity. The early authors do not question their Italian identity, while today’s authors, in their search for integration, must recover its meaning. The Prince of Racalmuto tries to maintain an identity while suffering its loss in grappling with three languages: standard Italian, Sicilian, and English. This trifurcation, together with the protagonist’s hatred of Mussolini for closing off his option of returning to Italy, is literally driving him insane. By way of contrast, present-day author Michael Maschio’s suburban-bred narrator needs to recover the Italian part of his identity—he achieves this through his relationship with his immigrant grandfather—and to integrate it into his all-American persona. Called the Actor, the narrator frames his search for identity metaphorically. Cut off from his heritage, he ‘‘acts’’ an inauthentic role. Tellingly, the Actor refers to a Sean O’Casey play and to Stanislavski’s method. Maschio’s story cannot but make us reﬂect on the kind of literature that future generations of Italian-American authors, who will not know an original immigrant, will produce. Another evolution seen in the most recent Italian-American literature is the use of avant-garde modes of expression. We have included in this anthology two authors who write in this manner. Though the authors are third-generation (Caponegro) and second-generation (Palermo Stevenson) Italian Americans, their mode of expression perhaps points the way to one kind of Italian-American literature that will develop further in the future. Both stories, Mary Caponegro’s acclaimed ‘‘The Etruscan Catechism,’’ with its look at pre-Roman culture— Caponegro became intrigued by the Etruscans during her stay at the American Academy in Rome—and the other, by Rosalind Palermo Stevenson, ‘‘The Guest,’’\n\n................. 17066$\n\nINTR\n\n08-13-08 15:35:53\n\nPS PAGE 3\n\n4 introduction\n\nwith its modernist approach to Mussolini, nonetheless reﬂect their ItalianAmerican backgrounds. At the other extreme of expression is Tony Ardizzone’s prizewinning ‘‘Lamb Soup,’’ written in the style of a folktale with proletarian undertones. Using a fable form in lieu of an avant-garde mode, the story equally demonstrates high creative experimentation within a framework of continuity with the Southern Italian folk tradition. Salvatore La Puma also experiments in much of his ﬁction, sometimes using magical realism, as does Paola Corso. Feminist themes, exempliﬁed most directly by Louisa Ermelino, Tony Ardizzone, Kenny Marotta, Christine Palamidessi Moore, and Paola Corso, are also a new development. These authors present not only female protagonists but also ones who construct their own futures. This ties in with another major change in the Italian-American literary landscape: Many more women are writing and getting published. The emergence of the comic spirit seen in Kenny Marotta’s ‘‘Permanent Waves’’ also marks a fast-growing trend in Italian-American literature—a literature so often ﬁlled in its early manifestations with the miseria of the immigrants. Rita Ciresi in ‘‘Big Heart’’ and Tony Zurlo in ‘‘Marco Marcoroni,’’ a satiric parody of academia, continue that comic vein. With the exception of Ann Hood’s memoir, the memoirs in this volume act as glosses on the classics of Italian-American literature: Jerre Mangione bears witness to the deathbed of one of the two uncles who reigned supreme over the spirited table of Mount Allegro; William Foote Whyte, while not Italian American himself, reports on his Italian-American cornerboy informant for his sociological study, Street Corner Society; Christina Bevilacqua interviews Camille Paglia, who responds in her intellectually provocative manner in the aftermath of the publication of her book Sexual Personae; and Dennis Barone identiﬁes and provides a photo of the real-life counterpart of the young Jewish intellectual in Pietro di Donato’s Christ in Concrete, while my story, with a boiling vat causing a character’s death, references this same novel. A word needs to be said about the basis for our selections: Our ﬁrst and foremost consideration was aesthetic excellence; next we considered stylistic variety, ranging from traditional storytelling and poetic expression to the avantgarde; historical signiﬁcance was also considered; and ﬁnally we included a range of subject matter—among others, intergenerational conﬂict as seen in Joseph Papaleo’s ‘‘Sizes’’; loss of innocence in Albert Di Bartolomeo’s ‘‘Against Gravity’’; women as practitioners of the oral tradition in Joanna Clapps Herman’s ‘‘Perfect Hatred’’; religious subversion in John Fante’s ‘‘My Father’s God’’ and spiritual redemption in Antonio Costabile’s folktale; moral considerations in Philip Cioffari’s ‘‘Sanctifying Grace’’; and maternal love in Paola Corso’s ‘‘Unraveled.’’ One last consideration was, alas, space restrictions, which prevented us from including more of the works that Italian Americana published in its ﬁrst\n\n................. 17066$\n\nINTR\n\n08-13-08 15:35:54\n\nPS PAGE 4\n\nintroduction\n\n5\n\ntwenty-ﬁve volumes. Only the possibility of a future anthology eases that limitation. —Carol Bonomo Albright\n\nPoetry—The Aesthetic of Alto Basso As I hav e wo rke d on this collection with Carol Bonomo Albright, I have come to think of this cultural heritage as alto basso, the simultaneous expression of the high and the low. Italian Americans lay claim to this high aesthetic and to the archetypal ordinary. In their lives and art they call upon and refer to a classical tradition—from Greek temples and ruined theaters (and the raw emotions of their severe drama), epic storytelling, mouth to ear, and the voice of opera, their native creation, that is heard in the tiniest Italian town square as well as on the radio in their American kitchens. Add to these their long history with the Church, which gave southern Italy Greek and Latin liturgies, art, and music, and they take the everyday to high ground. Dana Gioia is the former poetry editor of Italian Americana—indeed, the man responsible for bringing many of the poems collected here into print. In his poem ‘‘Planting a Sequoia,’’ a family with earth on their hands calls on an ancient Sicilian ritual of planting a tree for a ﬁrstborn with a lock of his hair. Earthbound, they hold on to where they came from, but here they plant not a ﬁg or olive or lemon tree but a giant, terribly American sequoia. An air of loss pervades this elegy: the loss of one’s ancestral home and a past way of life, but most of all the loss of a ﬁrst-born child brings a sweep of terrible beauty to the poem. In reading the last line, ‘‘Silently keeping the secret of your birth,’’ we feel the devastation of this planting and undoing. In Robert Viscusi’s ‘‘Autobiography,’’ Italy is perfectly monumentalized as an immense, intrusive elephant living in the family home. ‘‘We painted her sides with huge pink ﬂowers . . . rented her out for parties / wrote papers about her in school.’’ But she, this Italy, this elephant, made practical, made use of, made into art, will never die—not for the Viscusi family or for any Italian Americans. Italian-American authors, such as those collected here, live in the continuous present with Italy. She’s their history, their burden, their God, that which transports them. She is ‘‘a fossil, like leaves in coal’’ (Joseph Salemi); ‘‘[her] songs stay with you, still’’ (Gerard Mancini). Alas, she is also ‘‘a gnarled, spindly intruder, / the transplanted heart/ of an old conjure woman’’ (Peter Covino). John Ciardi’s poem ‘‘Tea at Aunt’s’’ and Jay Parini’s ‘‘Grandmother in Heaven’’ make poetry through incantation. The lists of their living and of their dead are raised through the device of the Homeric catalog: ‘‘Mrs. Clossen died of cancer . . . Mabel Sinclair’s girl Kathleen / . . ./ . . . / she married that boy that used to bring / The paper—you remember him’’ (John Ciardi). ‘‘Her little Gino, who went down the mines /and whom they had to dig all week to ﬁnd; / that willow,\n\n................. 17066$\n\nINTR\n\n08-13-08 15:35:54\n\nPS PAGE 5\n\n6 introduction\n\nTony, who became so thin’’ (Parini). Each poem brings together the living and the dead and places them onto the same breathing plane. This is normal for Italian Americans: the living and the dead, the blessed and the damned, the ancient and the modern, side by side, or perhaps at one with one another. In George Guida’s poem ‘‘Mother,’’ a classic Italian mother, moved by something she’s seen on the History Channel, has been transformed into an amalgam of a Buddhist, a Shinto priestess, and a televisionist who, with the fervor that only an Italian mother can call up, has turned to ancestor worship. ‘‘‘Wipe your feet, and keep quiet,’ she said / ‘I’m worshipping Great Aunt Tessie.’’’ No normal modern demarcations, borders, categories do for Italians. Although Italian Americans write poetry and create art, their strength is that art and life are not separate. As Kevin di Camillo is driving his Alfa Romeo around Nantucket ‘‘roads smoked with sand. Maria was with me / listening to the only music: Verdi’s operas.’’ At the end of this poem, he, the Alfa Romeo, Maria, and Verdi lift up and ‘‘drive towards the sun, the ocean, Italy.’’ Cars have an aesthetic of design along with Verdi’s aesthetic. It’s important to have the name of their loved one in the poem. And when all of this rises in the poetry, out of this ordinary comes a lift toward the gods and inevitably toward that sacred horizon, Italy. In Sandra Gilbert’s poem ‘‘In the Golden Sala,’’ ‘‘the great sala of the ruined palazzo’’ has ‘‘gold leaf, gold moldings, shredding tapestries with gold threads.’’ But the palazzo is in ruins: Clothes hang on the line of the terrace; animals wander in and out of this grand palazzo while a baby is born into splashing water in the ‘‘light of Agrigento.’’ In Italian hands, inhabiting the ordinary becomes a ﬁne art. It is precisely what they are loved for: ‘‘These people know how to live!’’ The world ﬂocks to Italian shores precisely to see some of the most important art and culture that exist in the West—and to have a perfectly made cup of coffee. This juxtaposition and intertwining of these two, the high aesthetic and the low everyday, are apparent in the poetry you will read here. Side by side, we ﬁnd angels and animals, the sacred and the profane, damnation and ecstasy. The alto cultural heritage ranges from Alexander Theroux’s references to the Aghlabites’ mosques to Gerard Mancini’s mention of Aeneas, Sybil, Keats, Bernini’s fountain, and Montale’s poetry, to Mary Jo Salter’s Madame Butterﬂy and Lewis Turco’s quotation from Don De Lillo’s novel Libra. For Italian Americans, artistic life has not been partitioned off and placed in a museum-ready world, but lives in their bones. The opera of the everyday is also a commonplace for them. Not only are Verdi and Puccini playing in the background, but there also exists the melodrama of women clutching their breast, of men posturing, and people swooning with love. As Camille Paglia has said, ‘‘the vendetta, the loyalty, the blood brother. . . . There’s something Italian, Italian American . . . that has a ﬁerce attack quality to\n\n................. 17066$\n\nINTR\n\n08-13-08 15:35:54\n\nPS PAGE 6\n\nintroduction\n\n7\n\nit.’’ All of this is part of the air Italian Americans breathe. And so when they write they call upon all of this. In these poems there is ﬁre and ice, then waters and wind, the elements made into words that beat in Italian Americans. The ﬁre and ice are an intense core of their work. But there are winds and waters to refresh and calm Italian Americans enough to love and write, and think and assemble anthologies. —Joanna Clapps Herman\n\n................. 17066$\n\nINTR\n\n08-13-08 15:35:54\n\nPS PAGE 7\n\n................. 17066$\n\nINTR\n\n08-13-08 15:35:54\n\nPS PAGE 8\n\nANCE STOR S\n\nPROSE\n\n................. 17066$\n\nPRT1\n\n08-13-08 15:35:57\n\nPS PAGE 9\n\n................. 17066$\n\nPRT1\n\n08-13-08 15:35:58\n\nPS PAGE 10\n\nMy Father’s God John Fante Fiction (1975)\n\nUp on th e de ath of old Father Ambrose, the Bishop of Denver assigned a new priest to St. Catherine’s parish. He was Father Bruno Ramponi, a young Dominican from Boston. Father Ramponi’s picture appeared on the front page of the Boulder Herald. Actually there were two pictures—one of a swarthy, shortnecked prelate bulging inside a black suit and reversed collar, the other an action shot of Father Ramponi in football gear leaping with outstretched hands for a forward pass. Our new pastor was famous. He had been a football star, an AllAmerican halfback from Boston College. My father studied the pictures at the supper table. ‘‘A Sicilian,’’ he decided. ‘‘Look how black he is.’’ ‘‘How can he be a Sicilian?’’ my mother asked. ‘‘The paper says he was born in Boston.’’ ‘‘I don’t care where he was born. I know a Sicilian when I see one.’’ His brows quivered like caterpillars as he studied the face of Father Ramponi. ‘‘I don’t want any trouble with this priest,’’ he brooded. It was an ominous reminder of the many futile years Father Ambrose had tried to bring my father back to the church. ‘‘The glorious return to divine grace,’’ Father Ambrose had called it. ‘‘The prodigal son falling into the arms of his heavenly father.’’ On the job or in the street, at band concerts and in the pool hall, the old pastor constantly swooped down on my father with these pious objurations Reprinted by permission of HarperCollins.\n\n11\n\n................. 17066$\n\n$CH1\n\n08-13-08 15:36:18\n\nPS PAGE 11\n\n12 m y f a t h e r’s god\n\nwhich only served to drive him deeper among the heathens, so that the priest’s death brought a gasp of relief. But in Father Ramponi he sensed a renewal of the tedious struggle for his soul, for it was only a question of time before the new priest discovered that my father never attended Mass. Not that my mother and we four kids didn’t make up for his absences. He insisted that it had to be that way, and every Sunday, through rain, sleet and snow he watched us trek off to St. Catherine’s ten blocks away, his conscience vicariously soothed, his own cop-out veiled in righteous paternalism. The day after the announcement of Father Ramponi’s appointment, St. Catherine’s School droned like an agitated beehive with rumors about our new priest. Gathered in clusters along the halls, the nuns whispered breathlessly. On the playground the boys set aside the usual touchball game to crowd into the lavatory and relate wild reports. The older boys did all the talking, cigarettes dangling from their lips, while second graders like myself listened with bulging eyes. It was said that Father Ramponi was so powerful that he could bring down a bull with one punch, that he was structured like a gorilla, and that his nose had been kicked in on an historic Saturday afternoon when he had torn apart the Notre Dame line. We younger kids stiffened in fear and awe. After the gentle Father Ambrose, the thought of being hauled before Father Ramponi for discipline was too ghastly to contemplate. When the ﬁrst bell rang we rushed to our classrooms, dreading the sudden, unexpected appearance of Father Ramponi in the halls. At 11:30, in the midst of arithmetic, the classroom door opened and our principal, Sister Mary Justinus, entered. Her cheeks shone like apples. Her eyes glittered with excitement. ‘‘The class will please rise,’’ she announced. We got to our feet and caught sight of him in the hall. This was it. The awesome Father Ramponi was about to make his debut before the second-grade class. ‘‘Children,’’ Sister Justinus ﬂuttered. ‘‘I want you to say ‘Good morning,’ to your new pastor, Father Bruno Ramponi.’’ She raised her hands like a symphony conductor and brought them down briskly as we chanted, ‘‘Good morning, Father,’’ and the priest stepped into the room. He moved forward to stand before us with massive hands clasped at his waist, a grin kneading his broken face. All the rumors about him were true—a bull of a man with dark skin and wide, crushed nostrils out of which black hairs ﬂared. His jaw was as square as a brickbat, his short neck like a creosoted telephone pole. From out of his coat sleeves small bouquets of black hair burst over his wrists. ‘‘Please be seated,’’ he smiled. The moment he uttered those three words the myth of his ferocity vanished. For his voice was small and sibilant, surprisingly sweet and uncertain, a mighty lion with the roar of a kitten. The whole class breathed a sigh of deliverance as we sat down.\n\n................. 17066$\n\n$CH1\n\n08-13-08 15:36:18\n\nPS PAGE 12\n\nJohn Fante\n\n13\n\nFor twenty seconds he stood there lost for words, his large face oozing perspiration. With the uncanny intuition of children we were on to him, knowing somehow that this colossus of the gridiron would never loose his terrible wrath upon us, that he was as docile as a cow and harmless as a butterﬂy. Drawing a handkerchief from his pocket, he dabbed at his moist neck and we grew uneasy and embarrassed waiting for him to say more, but he was locked to the spot, his tongue bolted down. Finally Sister Justinus came to his rescue, breaking the silence with a brisk slap of her hands. ‘‘Now children, I want each of you to rise and give Father your name so that he can greet you personally.’’ One at a time we stood and pronounced our names, and in each instance Father Ramponi nodded and said, ‘‘How do you do, Tom,’’ or ‘‘How do you do, Mary,’’ or ‘‘How do you do, Patrick.’’ At my turn I rose and spoke my name. ‘‘Paisan,’’ the priest grinned. I managed a smile. ‘‘Tell your folks I’ll be around to meet them soon.’’ Even though he told most of the students the same thing, I sat there in a state of shock. There were some things I could tell my father, and others I preferred to delete, but there was one thing I didn’t dare tell him—that a priest was coming to visit him. With my mother it didn’t matter, and upon hearing that Father Ramponi was coming she lifted her eyes to heaven and moaned. ‘‘Oh, my God,’’ she said. ‘‘Whatever you do, don’t tell your father. We might lose him for good.’’ It was our secret, my mother’s and mine, and we paid the price, especially Mama. All that was required of me was to keep the front yard clean, raking the October leaves and sweeping the front porch every day. She took on the rest of the house alone, and in the days that followed she washed the walls and ceilings, she washed the windows, she laundered and ironed the curtains, she waxed the linoleum, she dragged the frazzled rugs out to the back yard, ﬂung them over the clothesline and beat them with a broom. Every evening, home from work, my father strode through the house and paused, the smell of ammonia in his nostrils as he looked around and found some small new change. The gas heater in the living room polished and shining, its chrome gleaming like a band of dazzling silver, the furniture luminous as dark mirrors, the broken rocker repaired, the worn needlepoint replaced with a piece of blue wool from an old coat. He crossed the linoleum that sparkled like a sheet of ice. ‘‘What’s happening?’’ he asked. ‘‘What’s going on around here?’’ ‘‘House cleaning,’’ my mother said, her face careworn, her hair coming loose from the bun in back, her bones aching. He frowned at her curiously. ‘‘Take it easy. What’s the good of a clean house if you end up in the hospital?’’\n\n................. 17066$\n\n$CH1\n\n08-13-08 15:36:18\n\nPS PAGE 13\n\n14 m y f a t h e r’s g od\n\nDays passed and November showed up, bringing the ﬁrst snow of winter. But Father Ramponi did not visit us. I saw him almost every day at school and he always tossed a word or two my way, but he made no mention of the visit. The snow fell steadily. The streets disappeared. The windows frosted. My mother strung clotheslines around the stove in the living room, in order to dry the washing. The cold weather conﬁned the little ones indoors. Crayons were crushed underfoot, toys kicked beneath the furniture. My brother spilled a bottle of ink on the linoleum, my sister drew a pumpkin face with black crayon on the best wall in the front room. Then she melted the crayon against the side of the hot stove. Mama threw up her hands in defeat. If Father Ramponi ever visited us, he would have to take us for what we were—just plain, stupid peasants. The snow was my father’s deadly enemy, burying his job in desolate white mounds, engulﬁng brick, cement and scaffolding, robbing him of his livelihood and sending him home with an unopened lunch pail. He became a prisoner in his own house. Nor was he the loving husband a woman could enjoy through long winter days. He insisted on taking command of a ship that was already on course through rough waters. Lounging in the kitchen he watched my mother’s every move as she prepared meals, ﬁnding fault with everything. More salt, too much pepper, turn up the oven, turn down the oven, watch the potatoes, add some onion, where’s the oregano, fry some garlic, and ﬁnally, ‘‘Let me do that!’’ She ﬂung down her apron and stalked out of the kitchen to join us in the living room, her arms folded, her eyes blazing. Oh God! If Father Ramponi didn’t arrive soon she would be driven to the rectory to see him herself. Our house on Sunday morning was chaos. I can still see my frantic mother dashing from bedroom to bedroom in her pink slip, her braided hair piled atop her head, as she got us dressed for ten o’clock Mass. She polished our shoes, fashioned knots in our neckties, sewed buttons, patched holes, prepared breakfast, ironed pleats in my sister’s dress, raced from one of us to the other, picking up a shoe on the way, a toy. Armed with a washcloth, she inspected our ears and the backs of our necks, scraping away dirt, my sister screaming, ‘‘You’re cruel, cruel!’’ Lastly, in the ﬁnal moments before we departed, she slapped talcum powder over her face and came out to the front room where my oblivious father sprawled reading the Denver Post. She turned her back for him to button up her dress. ‘‘Fix me.’’ Chewing a cigar, he squinted as the curling smoke blurred his eyes and he worked the buttons through the holes with blunt ﬁngers. It was the only contribution he made to those hectic mornings. ‘‘Why don’t you come to Mass with us?’’ she often asked. ‘‘What for?’’ ‘‘To worship God. To set an example for your children.’’ ‘‘God sees my family at church. That’s enough. He knows I sent them.’’\n\n................. 17066$\n\n$CH1\n\n08-13-08 15:36:19\n\nPS PAGE 14\n\nJohn Fante 15\n\n‘‘Wouldn’t it be better if God saw you there too?’’ ‘‘God’s everywhere, so why do I have to see Him in a church? He’s right here too, in this house, this room. He’s in my hand. Look.’’ He opened and closed his ﬁst. ‘‘He’s right in there. In my eyes, my mouth, my ears, my blood. So what’s the sense of walking eight blocks through the snow, when all I got to do is sit right here with God in my own house.’’ We children stood listening enthralled at this great and refreshing piece of theology, our collars pinching, our eyes moving to the window as the silent snow drifted down, shivering at the thought of plowing through the drifts to the cold church. ‘‘Papa’s right,’’ I said. ‘‘God is everywhere. It says so in the catechism.’’ We looked imploringly at my mother as she put on her wool coat with the rabbit fur collar, and there was a sob in my sister’s voice as she begged, ‘‘Can’t we all just kneel down here and pray for awhile? God won’t mind.’’ ‘‘You see!’’ my mother glared at my father. ‘‘Nobody prays here but me,’’ he said. ‘‘The rest of you get going.’’ ‘‘It’s not fair!’’ I yelled. ‘‘Who’re you?’’ ‘‘I’ll tell you who I am,’’ he said threateningly. ‘‘I’m the owner of this house. I come and go as I please. I can throw you out any time I feel like it. Now get going!’’ He rose in a towering fury and pointed at the door, and we ﬁled out like humble serfs, heads bowed, trudging through snow a foot deep. God, it was cold! And so unfair. I clenched my ﬁsts and longed for the day I would become a man and knock my father’s brains out.\n\nIn the s eve nth week of his pastorate Father Ramponi ﬁnally visited our house. He came in the darkness of evening, through a roaring storm, his arrival presaged by the heavy pounding of his overshoes on the front porch as he kicked off the clinging snow. It shook the house. My father sat at the dining room table drinking wine and I sat across from him, doing my homework. We both stared as the wine in the carafe tossed like a small red sea. Mama and Grandma came startled from the kitchen. We heard the rap of knuckles on the front door. ‘‘Come in!’’ my father shouted. Father Ramponi loomed in the doorway, hat in hand, so tall he barely made it through the door. Had the President of the United States entered, we could not have been more surprised. ‘‘Good evening,’’ he smiled. ‘‘Whaddya say there,’’ Papa said, too astonished for amenities as Father Ramponi walked deeper into the house. All atwitter, my mother’s face tingled with excitement as she hurried to take the priest’s overcoat. He laid it across her arms like a massive black rug, so large that it dragged over the ﬂoor as she hauled it away to the bedroom.\n\n................. 17066$\n\n$CH1\n\n08-13-08 15:36:20\n\nPS PAGE 15\n\n16 m y f a t h e r’s g od\n\nBy now the rest of us were on our feet, staring at the towering priest. Everything shrank proportionately, the room, the furniture, and the members of our family. Suddenly we were a tribe of pygmies confronted by a giant explorer from the outside world. As they shook hands, Father Ramponi lowered a friendly paw on Papa’s shoulder and spoke in his high, gentle voice. ‘‘They tell me you’re the ﬁnest stonemason in Colorado. Is it true?’’ My father’s face blossomed like a sunﬂower. ‘‘That’s the truth, Father.’’ ‘‘Fine, ﬁne. I like a man who’s not ashamed of his worth.’’ Reeling with ﬂattery, Papa turned and ordered the room cleared. ‘‘Everybody out!’’ With grand pretensions of authority Mama herded us into the living room, which didn’t in the least add to the privacy since the two rooms were separated by French doors, only there weren’t any doors. Just the hinges. The doors were out in the garage, for reasons nobody ever questioned. We kids ﬂung ourselves on the ﬂoor near the stove and Mama settled into the rocking chair. Presently Grandma appeared, a black shawl around her shoulders, the rosary twined in her ﬁngers, and she too found a chair. No more than four feet away, Papa and Father Ramponi had the entire dining room to themselves. Those were the days of Prohibition and Papa’s routine with guests never changed. Every caller was invited down into the earthen cellar where four ﬁftygallon barrels of wine were stored—a hundred gallons matured, and a hundred in the fermentation process. Through the trapdoor in the pantry he and Father Ramponi disappeared into the cellar. We listened to them down there under the house, their voices mufﬂed, their laughter rumbling in the ground. Patiently we waited for them to reappear, like an audience expecting the return of the players to the stage. As they came back Papa carried a fresh pitcher of wine, the beaded foam still bubbling. They sat at the table beneath light pouring down from a green metal shade. Papa ﬁlled two tumblers with wine and Father Ramponi lit a cigarette. Raising his glass, the priest proposed a toast. ‘‘To Florence, city of your birth.’’ Pleased but dubious, my father shook his head. ‘‘I come from Abruzzi, Father. From Torcelli Peligna.’’ It surprised Father Ramponi. ‘‘Is that so? Now where did I get the idea you were a Florentine?’’ ‘‘Never been there in my life.’’ ‘‘Maybe your relatives came from there.’’ ‘‘Maybe,’’ Papa shrugged. ‘‘You look like a Florentine.’’ ‘‘You think so?’’\n\n................. 17066$\n\n$CH1\n\n08-13-08 15:36:20\n\nPS PAGE 16\n\nJohn Fante 17\n\n‘‘A true Florentine, a craftsman in the tradition of that great city.’’ He drained his tumbler. We watched Papa expand with a sense of importance. It was as if Father Ramponi had sprinkled him with a holy water of magic powers. From that moment he was Father Ramponi’s pigeon, eating corn from the good priest’s hand. Then the subject matter changed quickly, and the real reason for the priest’s visit became apparent. ‘‘Nick,’’ he said with a new familiarity, his voice softer than ever. ‘‘Why is it that I never ﬁnd you at Mass on Sunday morning?’’ Mama and Grandma nodded at one another smugly. My father was a long time answering, kneading a kink in his neck, smiling as he sensed a trap. ‘‘I been thinking about that,’’ he said. ‘‘Thinking about it?’’ ‘‘About going.’’ ‘‘You should. As an example to your children.’’ There was an uncomfortable silence. My father put the tip of his ﬁngernail in the wine glass and twirled it absently. ‘‘We’ll talk about it some other time,’’ he said. ‘‘Come to the rectory tomorrow,’’ Father Ramponi suggested. ‘‘I’m gonna be pretty busy tomorrow.’’ ‘‘How about the day after tomorrow?’’ ‘‘I’m pretty busy, Father.’’ ‘‘In this wretched weather?’’ ‘‘Lots of ﬁguring to do. Getting ready for spring.’’ ‘‘Shall we make it next week?’’ Papa frowned, rubbed his chin. ‘‘Too far ahead. You never know, one day to the next.’’ The priest sighed, lifted his hands. ‘‘Then I leave it entirely up to you. When would it be most convenient?’’ My father found a cigar butt in the ashtray and went to a lot of trouble scraping and lighting it. ‘‘Let me think about it, Father.’’ He produced clouds of smoke that hid his face. Then, to everyone’s surprise, he said, ‘‘Let’s make it tomorrow.’’ Mama’s gulp of delight sounded like a shout. Father Ramponi rose and offered his hand. He was smiling in triumph and my father shook hands and squinted at him skeptically. Having committed himself, he seemed to regret it. ‘‘Two o’clock tomorrow?’’ Father Ramponi asked. ‘‘Not possible,’’ Papa said. ‘‘Three, then? Four?’’ ‘‘Can’t make it.’’ ‘‘Would you prefer to come in the morning?’’ ‘‘How can I come in the morning? You don’t understand, Father! I got things to do, people to see. I’m a busy man. All the time. Day and night!’’\n\n................. 17066$\n\n$CH1\n\n08-13-08 15:36:20\n\nPS PAGE 17\n\n18 m y f a t h e r’s g od\n\nThe priest did not press it. ‘‘I leave it up to you. Come when you can.’’ Papa nodded bleakly. ‘‘We’ll see. I can’t promise anything. I’ll do the best I can.’’ Th e ver y ne xt d ay my father began a series of talks at the rectory with Father Ramponi. The meetings left him in a somber mood, and a brooding calm settled over our house. We tiptoed around him, we talked in whispers. During meals he was completely silent, tearing bread and holding it uneaten in his hand. Even my little sister felt his melancholy. ‘‘Are you sick, Papa?’’ she asked. ‘‘Shhh!’’ Mama said. My father exhaled a sigh and stared, his forkful of macaroni dangling limply in midair. Every day he wore his Sunday clothes with a white shirt and a necktie. So intent was his concentration that he stopped talking altogether and merely gestured when he had some request. A wave of his hand could clear the room. A nod at his feet summoned his slippers. A ﬂat stare and talking ceased among us. Moving furtively in the background, my mother and grandmother watched him with sympathetic, adoring eyes. The man of the house was in crisis, grappling with the devil, and the decision was in doubt. Every night at bedtime we left him alone in the dining room, seated under the light, sipping wine and writing on a jumbo school tablet with a stubby pencil. A week of this, and suddenly the saturnine atmosphere of our home was shattered and my father was himself again. We awoke to hear him in the front yard, shoveling snow. Mama called him to breakfast. He bounded into the house with scarlet cheeks and purple ears, his eyes snow-bright as he slapped his hands hungrily and sat down before his scrambled eggs. One mouthful and he scowled. ‘‘Can’t you even fry eggs?’’ he said. We were happy again. Papa was complaining like his old self. As I prepared for school, my mother followed me into the living room and brought my mackinaw from the closet. She buttoned me up while my father stood watching. He had a bulky envelope in his hand. ‘‘Give this to Father Ramponi,’’ he said, handing it to me. I said okay and folded it to the size of my pocket. ‘‘Not like that,’’ he said, taking it from me. He opened the mackinaw and stuffed the envelope under my T-shirt. ‘‘Guard it with your life,’’ he warned. ‘‘What the heck is it?’’ ‘‘Never mind. Just give it to Father Ramponi.’’ ‘‘Tell him,’’ Mama said. ‘‘So he’ll know how important it is.’’ ‘‘You talk too much!’’ he snapped. ‘‘It’s your father’s confession,’’ Mama said. I suddenly felt it there against my ﬂesh, and sucked in my stomach. It was incredible, impossible, sacrilegious.\n\n................. 17066$\n\n$CH1\n\n08-13-08 15:36:21\n\nPS PAGE 18\n\nJohn Fante\n\n19\n\n‘‘You can’t write your confession!’’ I wailed. ‘‘You have to tell it. In the confessional!’’ ‘‘Who says so?’’ ‘‘It’s the rule. Everybody knows that!’’ ‘‘He won’t get me in that confession box.’’ ‘‘It’s the rule!’’ I cried, ready to burst into tears. ‘‘Mama! Tell him, please! He doesn’t understand!’’ ‘‘That shows how much you know,’’ Papa said. ‘‘He told me to write it: so what do you think of that!’’ I searched my mother’s face for the truth. She smiled. ‘‘Father Ramponi said it was all right this way.’’ I looked at my father accusingly. ‘‘Why can’t you be like everybody else?’’ ‘‘No, sir. You can’t get me in that box!’’ Dazed and angry and disgusted, I walked out into the cold morning, my lunch pail rigid in one hand, my books in the other, my father’s cold envelope freezing my stomach. Who the hell did he think he was? Why didn’t he take his damned confession to the priest himself? Why should I be forced to walk the streets with it? They weren’t my sins, they were his, so let him carry them to the priest. The frozen air took my breath and whirled it into ostrich plumes and I walked afraid, like a glass vial, fearful of spilling my burden. I knew my father had not been to confession for thirty years, not since he was a boy of my age. All of this wickedness, every human being he had injured, every sin against God’s commandments were congealed in a block of ice burning against my stomach as I crossed town, under dripping maple trees, around grey mounds of mudsplattered snow, my toes picking their way with the delicacy of bird’s feet, across the town, the awful responsibility of my burden hurting my ﬂesh, too sacred, too heavy for my life.\n\nAs I rea che d St. Catherine’s Father Ramponi drove up and parked in front of the stone steps leading to the main entrance. I waited for him to step out, pulling the envelope from under my shirt as the bell sounded and stragglers raced up the stairs. ‘‘Oh, yes,’’ he smiled, taking the envelope. ‘‘Thank you.’’ He seemed in a great hurry and at a loss as to what to do with the envelope. Opening the car door, he tossed the envelope on the seat and dashed away, taking the stairs three at a time. I watched in dismay as he disappeared. How could he do such a thing? That document was no triﬂing thing. It was my father’s confession, a matter sacred to God, and there it lay on the car seat, cast aside like a rag. What if someone came by and ﬁlched it—one of the older boys? The school was full of thieves who stole anything not nailed down. Suddenly I was in a panic as I imagined the confession being passed around, being read in the lavatory,\n\n................. 17066$\n\n$CH1\n\n08-13-08 15:36:21\n\nPS PAGE 19\n\n20 m y f a t h e r’s g od\n\ntouching off raucous laughter spilling into the halls, the streets, as the whole town laughed at my father’s sins. Guard it with your life, my father had warned, and guard it I did. For three hours I posted myself beside Father Ramponi’s car, my feet numbed with cold, my ears burning like ice cubes as I stayed out of school and scorned the wrath of Sister Justinus. At last the noon bell sounded and the students burst from the doors and down the stairs. I concealed myself as Father Ramponi appeared. He slid under the steering wheel and drove away, and the minuscule pinching pain in my stomach vanished at last. That night Father Ramponi made his second visit to our house. It was very late and Papa was turning out the lights when the priest knocked. Papa welcomed him and they came into the dining room. Through the open bedroom door I saw them as I lay beside my sleeping brother. Father Ramponi stood huge as a black bear under the green lampshade. Then my father noticed the open bedroom door and he closed it, and I was in darkness save for a ribbon of light under the threshold. I slipped out of bed and peered through the keyhole. Papa had seated himself before the wine, but Father Ramponi was still on his feet. He drew the envelope from his overcoat and tossed it on the table. ‘‘You deceived me,’’ he said quietly. My father lifted the envelope and tested it in his ﬁst. ‘‘It’s all there, Father. I didn’t forget a thing.’’ ‘‘It’s long enough, God knows.’’ ‘‘Some things I wrote, they were very hard, but it’s all there, over thirty years, the bad things in a man’s life.’’ ‘‘But you wrote it in Italian. . . .’’ ‘‘What’s wrong with that?’’ Father Ramponi sank gloomily into a chair, his hands thrust deeply into his overcoat pockets. ‘‘I don’t speak Italian,’’ he sighed. ‘‘Or read it. Or write it. Or understand it.’’ My father stared. ‘‘Bruno Ramponi, and you don’t speak Italian? That’s terrible.’’ The priest sank deeper in his chair and covered one eye. ‘‘It simply never entered my mind that you’d make your confession in Italian.’’ ‘‘The Pope speaks Italian,’’ my father said. ‘‘The cardinals, they speak Italian. The saints speak Italian. Even God speaks Italian. But you, Father Bruno Ramponi, don’t speak Italian.’’ A moan from the priest. He pushed the envelope toward my father. ‘‘Burn it.’’ ‘‘Burn it?’’ ‘‘Burn it. Now.’’\n\n................. 17066$\n\n$CH1\n\n08-13-08 15:36:21\n\nPS PAGE 20\n\nJohn Fante 21\n\nIt was an order, angry and incontrovertible. My father rose and took the envelope into the kitchen. I heard the lid of the stove open, then close, and then he returned to the dining room where Father Ramponi now stood and draped a purple stole around his neck. ‘‘Please kneel for penance and absolution,’’ he said. My father’s joints cracked like sticks as he knelt on the linoleum. He clasped his hands together and lowered his eyes. Father Ramponi made the sign of the cross over him and murmured a Latin prayer. Then he touched my father’s shoulder. ‘‘As a penance, I want you to say The Lord’s Prayer once a day until Christmas.’’ My father lifted his eyes. ‘‘Until Christmas, Father? That’s sixty days.’’ ‘‘You can say it in Italian.’’ It pleased my father and he lowered his eyes. Father Ramponi absolved and blessed him, and the little ceremony was concluded. My father got to his feet. ‘‘Thank you, Father. How about a glass of wine?’’ The priest declined. They moved toward the front door. Suddenly my father laughed. ‘‘I feel good,’’ he said. ‘‘Real good, Father.’’ ‘‘Next time I’ll expect you to come to the church for your confession.’’ ‘‘We’ll see, Father.’’ ‘‘And I’ll expect you at Mass Sunday.’’ ‘‘I’ll try and make it, Father.’’ They said good night and the door closed. I heard Father Ramponi’s car drive away. My father returned to the dining room. Through the keyhole I watched him pour a glass of wine. He raised it heavenward and drank. Then he turned out the light and all was darkness.\n\n................. 17066$\n\n$CH1\n\n08-13-08 15:36:21\n\nPS PAGE 21\n\n22 the a ctor prepares\n\nThe Actor Prepares Michael Maschio Fiction (1994)\n\nFo r ins tan ce, the Actor awakes to an empty bed. He has been drifting in and out of consciousness and has followed the dead-end trails of every dream he might have dreamt reluctantly, even heartlessly. At the moment, he cannot sleep: his mind is attentive, less restless than focused, like a microscope or camera lens, ready to render the angles of his life to death if need be. A voice within reminds him, ‘‘You’re alone.’’ The Actor’s response is a mumbled ‘‘I don’t care,’’ while he stands and looks down at the messed side of his double bed. He wants to be alone—he tells himself this surely and assumes that he will take advantage of his solitude to assess his career, which has spanned eight years, as well as to ﬁnd a way to come to terms with Leigh, his lover of three. But he does not have time—it is almost ten o’clock and his scene partner, Carol, will soon arrive—and he has yet to make his living room into the set of Sean O’Casey’s burlesque Bedtime Story, from which they will rehearse a scene for their acting class.

Blinking, he wanders into the living room and throws a white sheet over the coffee table, to make it a bed, thumbtacks a dark sheet over the kitchen doorway, to make it a front doorway, arranges pots squarely on the kitchen table, to make it a stove, and puts two kitchen chairs together, to form a couch. The Actor will play John Jo Mulligan, a bachelor, and Carol, recently a mother, will play Angelica Nightingale, a gay lass. According to O’Casey, she has spent the night or part of it and the ensuing action centers around her leaving before dawn; however, Angelica’s love is unrequited. She wants their intimacy to be discovered. Spiteful, she sings, ‘‘I don’t care what becomes of me, I don’t care cos’ I’m on the spree,’’ at the top of her lungs, ﬂustering John Jo, who is to be portrayed cyclically—as ﬂattered, ambivalent, uninterested and expedient. Yet, at the moment, the Actor is mad. He does not know Carol well but knows that she works and acts and is married and wonders if her husband is taking care of her baby. He surveys his apartment: a cracked ceiling, an aqua rug, two dying plants, one plastic shade, and concludes that he does not want to be a house husband—he does not want to be a husband at all. He loathes thinking of himself as being anything but an actor; but he is losing his conﬁdence gradually, unmistakably, senses its diminution as discontent and regrets it. He lowers the shade and lights a candle. Its ﬂame blackens the wick, yet barely grows while he feels himself slide, or fall, into character: his heart picks up pace, he holds his breath, expectant. The doorbell buzzes. ‘‘Come in, lass,’’ he tells Miss Nightingale, and sees, when she does so, clutched in her hand, a yellow, white, orange and blue bouquet.\n\n................. 17066$\n\n$CH1\n\n08-13-08 15:36:22\n\nPS PAGE 22\n\nMichael Maschio 23\n\n‘‘For me?’’ he asks. Carol is taken aback by the sound of his voice—by its bright tone, which belongs to John Jo Mulligan. She blushes, purses her lips and ﬂutters her lashes, in character, before nodding yes. But while John Jo Mulligan starts to deliver his next line, the Actor plainly sees Carol as Carol-being-insincere: her emotions are false, her ﬂowers are for their scene. The Actor’s concentration breaks. He feels beside himself: twenty years younger or ﬁfty years older, less shocked than disillusioned—retroactively disillusioned. That condition, that circumspect burnout, makes sense to him and is seconded by losses—loss of youth, time, love. He is sweating. A cold point emanates from his spine and expands into a chill, which spreads to all of his skin, not to change, but to reclaim his facade. He wants to go back to his bedroom. He has a line to deliver. He clears his throat, parts his mouth, but can say nothing.\n\nIt is we ll k now n that Brando rode the subways to study people, so as to perfect his craft. At noon, the Actor takes the N train from the Theater District, where he lives, to Bensonhurst, where his grandfather has lived for forty years. During his ride the Actor eats his breakfast: a bagel and an apple, reads unsolicited mail and studies the script of The Daring and the Deceitful, the soap opera for which he will play a bartender. In real life, the Actor is a bartender—part-time, at the Lincoln Center Grill. He met Leigh there three years ago—along with the opera crowd, she and two friends came in, sat at the bar and drank margaritas. Leigh did not drink, she talked to the Actor—about the ballet she had just seen, about her apartment on Riverside Drive, about East Lyme, Connecticut, where she had grown up, about her mother, a title searcher turned real estate lawyer, and her father, also a lawyer, living in California. When she left, she left her phone number on her check. The Actor was breathless. Leigh was persistent. She moved in at the end of that year and appeased his pride by letting him pay the larger share of the rent until his trust ran out. Today, the Actor avoids her calls (she is in Dallas working on a bankruptcy proceeding), in order to ﬁnd within himself another character: Willie, a gay-basher who, in an upcoming NYU ﬁlm, comes to terms with his identity. But the Actor is forcing the part: he can neither alter his perspective nor redirect his emotions away from himself or his failure, which he feels is real—indeed, he feels that he has jeopardized everything he started with when he embarked on his career during his last year at Yale. Since then he has spent his days looking for work, his nights temping and his late nights preparing spaghetti dinners, watching reruns of the local news and falling asleep to the munch and beep of garbage trucks. Each morning he awakens late, rushes through a rehearsal, a shower and a meal before he runs out in black boots or work boots or penny loafers or whatever the audition requires. And each afternoon, after he has been told that he is not right for the part, he goes to the YMCA, plays basketball with kids half his age, showers,\n\n................. 17066$\n\n$CH1\n\n08-13-08 15:36:22\n\nPS PAGE 23\n\n24 the a ctor prepares\n\nbuys a hero and returns to his apartment to sit in front of the TV and tell himself there is no purpose to his routine, no end, just this day and the next. As a result, the Actor is mean when he is not distant or sulking. He reads great plays incessantly, thinks about writing his own one-man show or starting a theater company—he researches the government grants for which he is eligible, but usually ends up napping with his papers spread about his bed. At the moment, he bows his head. He would like to be taken to a trading post, where he can swap his method for an attainable goal and a good start, have his slate wiped clean and be allotted the time he has lost. He would like it all done privately, too, so that no one would ever know and he could forget. He closes his eyes, lets his senses drift. The sound of the subway train, the thrust and unsettling kachungt, surrounds him, conﬁnes him, as if he is a prisoner or an exile—he knows better how he got where he is than how he can get out. The train goes over the bridge. Light, in random blocks, falls across his chest, drawing his attention. Squinting, he looks through the dirty window, across the water: blue, calm and rippled uniformly—looks at the farther and larger Twin Tower, candle-like, where his father works. Less like a son than like a brother, or, say, like a friend, the Actor thinks about being like his father. He would be a lawyer then, work with people his own age, for people with families, make money. But because he is disdainful instinctively or habitually of the work, he believes being a lawyer is playing a part. His acting teacher, Stanislavski, once said, ‘‘You must live the part.’’ ‘‘How wise is it to live a bad part?’’ the Actor wonders. He has no answer. Rather, he has his experience. And before he can compare that to the ‘‘bad part,’’ or even stand to change his seat, the train goes into the tunnel and he notices his reﬂection in the dark glass. There, he looks different: his hair appears jet black and matted but is really brown and ﬁne, his pupils have either expanded or the whites have receded into the circles surrounding his now colorless eyes; his nose, normally prominent, dominates his cheeks, which look glued on and pale. He believes he is distorting himself purposely, testing himself: his tolerance for himself, his ability to rationalize or transform that which appears distasteful and ugly. The belief that his life will be different if he changes is supplanted by the reality that his life will continue to change if he stays the way he is. He wants to pause, cease and desist, declare a truce between his thoughts and experiences so that he can formulate a recovery, a rescue plan, write his own self-help book or pamphlet, so to speak. The train stops. Before him, a young mother holding her daughter’s hand barely makes it into the subway car, but leaves her other child, an older girl, on the platform. The doors will reopen, the Actor is sure. But they do not reopen. So he stands. But the train moves, making him stumble while he sees, through the gray window, the girl on the platform freeze, her ﬁnger in her mouth, the sudden draft in the station making her hair ﬂutter. He is speechless—he steps toward her, but then she is gone—or he is gone, into the tunnel.\n\n................. 17066$\n\n$CH1\n\n08-13-08 15:36:23\n\nPS PAGE 24\n\nMichael Maschio 25\n\nMeanwhile, beside him, the smaller girl is screaming, ‘‘Let me go, let me go, let me go!’’ while her mother pulls her off the ﬂoor and into a seat. Also in the car are two men, old and raptly interested, looking at the Actor in particular. He feels he has to do something. The woman is oblivious to her crisis. The Actor touches her arm, tells her what has happened and offers to go back. But she takes her daughter and moves to the other end of the car. The Actor is stunned. He thinks that she just does not understand—that she just does not realize what she has let happen. At the next stop he follows her off. But she walks quickly to a far bench, where she sits and waits for the next train. The Actor: hunched, mouth agape, mind locked into readiness, feels two-dimensional. He tries to compose himself: to relax the muscles of his face, arms and legs, slow his heartbeat, breathe regularly. But he becomes self-conscious and tense, static and jittery in tandem spurts. He half-turns, as if he will turn in place (to take a second look), but sprints up to the street instead and continues back toward the previous station, as if racing: arms bent at their elbows sharply, knees rising straight and high, until he loses his sense of direction and stops, catches his breath and lets himself hate the woman for not having let him help her. It feels good to hate her, good in his heart, then bad—very bad. The Actor believes that he is guilty. He becomes nauseous. He steps right, and then left and then right until he loses his strength, bows his head and feels the high sun thicken his hair, making his head feel heavy and his body feel small. The Actor was born in Brooklyn, but moved to the suburbs when he was four; therefore, he is lost, or thinks he is lost or feels lost emotionally. His spirit is low. Dejected, he looks at the two-story, two-family houses: close together, row upon row of red brick, for as far as he can see. Strangely, the uniformity, the nascent familiarity, clears his mind, while his heart, which has been running, slows to a regular beat. He feels ﬁne, balanced, yet light on his feet, as if drugged or sedated. In seconds, from someone, he ﬁnds out where he is, and then walks past the houses, wondering how much one might cost.\n\nOn the s et o f The Daring and the Deceitful the Actor serves white wine to Gwen, a model, and former model in real life. She thanks him, takes a sip and places her drink on the bar. Then Dex grabs her arm. Dex is a real estate mogul. ‘‘What did you do?’’ he demands. She got pregnant—by him, on purpose, he suspects. He wants her to get an abortion. However Dan, the actor who plays Dex, cannot convey a sense of urgency. His hair sprayed, his ﬁt frame wrapped in an Armani suit, in real life he is a family man from Brooklyn who started acting just that year. He has taken a liking to the Actor. ‘‘All you need is a break,’’ he’s told him. Meanwhile, frustrated, her heart pounding beneath her leather jacket, her eyes glassy and deﬁant, Gwen does not answer Dex’s question directly. Rather, looking up at him, she pauses for a close-up, which fades to a commercial.\n\n................. 17066$\n\n$CH1\n\n08-13-08 15:36:24\n\nPS PAGE 25\n\n26 the a ctor prepares\n\nThe Actor thinks the scene went well. But the director, wearing a red jumpsuit and cowboy boots, is unsatisﬁed with the sequence. She tells Gwen to ﬂirt with the bartender for a beat, so as to add fuel to Dex’s ﬁre. ‘‘Should I say something?’’ the Actor wonders. It is not his place to speak, but he feels at ease behind the bar. ‘‘Yes,’’ the director says. ‘‘You smile . . . and you take her order and make her drink . . . be sure you make a good impression on her—You’re not really a bartender, you’re trying to become a pilot—and you serve her, and lean toward her . . . and you whisper . . . something. But make sure we don’t pick it up—and then, Gwen, you smile, and . . . no, you blush. And then we cut to Dex and let the tension build.’’ Being an extra, the Actor wants a line. ‘‘Dex is gonna threaten her. I could sense that and give him a standofﬁsh look, or I could ask Gwen, ‘Is he with you?’ or ‘Do you know this guy?’ And she’ll say, ‘You mean Mr. Dexter Bondsman? He’s my ﬁance´,’ even though they’re not engaged—but everyone knows that she wants to marry him, so it’ll make matters worse and build tension.’’ Without further consideration, the director decides that Dex will become disgusted when he sees Gwen ﬂirting with the bartender. Subsequently, Gwen will leave her drink, run after Dex, grab his arm, turn him about and force him into a public kiss. ‘‘It’s about time we saw something like that,’’ the director comments.\n\nAt his g ran dfa ther ’s h ous e, having eaten his ﬁll of macaroni, the Actor is slouched on the couch, watching the Yankees game. Quietly, even derisively, he delivers stray lines until he notices, on the coffee table and beside the phone, a stack of photographs, warped, or cupped like hands. Shufﬂing through them, he recognizes his extended family, gathered around a tree, before a small house, all on a vast, undeveloped ﬁeld. There is the patriarch: Great-Grandfather Finale, six feet tall, white mustachioed, pipe in mouth—he retired when he was forty and lived off of his children until he was ninety. Thinking about that makes a wound, long closed, open inside the Actor’s heart. He adjusts his pose, holds the photograph at a distance, then close to his eyes for contrast. But his eyes close and across his mind a stage, low to the ground and dark, becomes apparent. There, the Actor sees himself encircled by a spotlight, poised to deliver the line, ‘‘The readiness is all.’’ But this image of himself playing Hamlet is tiresome and, he concludes, beyond his grasp. Presently, he is unwilling to see silver linings: he knows that he will never be able to take care of his father and that he is living off of his girlfriend. Ashamed, he dislikes himself, his apartment, his resume, his scene partner, as well as Brando, Robert De Niro and Kenneth Branagh. He would like to clear his mind, to empty it or shake it up, so that memories and wishes would merge, his body being a laboratory and he a scientist who has botched an experiment. He looks at the photograph—at his grandfather: about age thirty (his\n\n................. 17066$\n\n$CH1\n\n08-13-08 15:36:25\n\nPS PAGE 26\n\nMichael Maschio 27\n\nage), a ﬁlterless cigarette, a crooked smile. When his grandfather got the chance, he sold his summerhouse in order to create a trust for the Actor. ‘‘I am I,’’ Stanislavski once said, ‘‘but if I was (ﬁll in the blank), then I would (ﬁll in the blank).’’ Using this formula, known as The Magic If, the Actor considers: what if I had been my grandfather . . . then I would not have sold our house . . . then I could live there . . . marry Leigh. His hand is supporting his head while he considers this—he looks interrupted or frozen like a video image on pause. His grandfather comes in, smiling, his teeth out, his glasses off, a cup of espresso in each hand. Yet his long smile ﬂattens quickly when he sees his eldest grandson locked into glum inattentiveness. It bafﬂes him, makes him wonder why such a smart, handsome boy is letting some silly thing get the better of him. He wants to know what’s wrong and does not hesitate to ask, ‘‘What’s wrong?’’ The Actor breaks his pose, takes a cup of espresso and bluffs by telling his grandfather the score of the game. But then he has nothing to say. So he picks up another photograph and recognizes himself, standing beside a tree. ‘‘The man had no recollections of the place at all. He remembered only the emotions he left,’’ Stanislavski, in reference to his theory of Emotion Memory, once said. Recalling it now, the Actor feels secure, cared for. ‘‘I was at our summerhouse?’’ he asks and does not know that he has spoken aloud. ‘‘That’s you, Tony.’’ His grandfather points to the photograph. But that is not Tony. Rather, Tony is holding the photograph, he is not in the photograph—he understands this intellectually. Yet he is connected to the photograph emotionally, or he is connected to his emotions. He looks at his grandfather and thinks about his grandmother, who, one morning, less than a year ago, was unable to get out of bed. She complained. His grandfather called the hospital. She refused to go. When the ambulance arrived, she was embarrassed for the paramedics. She sat in the back, but stopped breathing before long—and could not be resuscitated. Tony tells himself, ‘‘It’s terrible for Grandpa to have to live without Grandpa,’’ but then corrects himself, ‘‘I mean Grandma,’’ yet thinks his initial mistake was closer to the mark. He believes that he has been living without himself. ‘‘Are you staying tonight?’’ his grandfather asks. Tony said that he would, but does not know if he should. He withholds his answer, puts the photograph in his breast pocket and tells his grandfather that he has to make a telephone call. After many rings, Leigh answers. Tony apologizes. ‘‘I woke you up. I didn’t know if you were home yet.’’ ‘‘I saw what you left me,’’ she says. ‘‘What?’’ ‘‘I put them in water. Where did you buy them?’’\n\n................. 17066$\n\n$CH1\n\n08-13-08 15:36:25\n\nPS PAGE 27\n\n28 the a ctor prepares\n\n‘‘When did you get home?’’ ‘‘A little while ago,’’ she yawns. She must be under the covers, talking on the cordless phone, Tony assumes. But he is wrong—she is in their living room, standing, legs crossed, in the dark, by the open window, wearing nothing at all, twirling, beneath her small nose, the petals of an orange ﬂower that his scene partner, Carol, brought over that morning. Without a doubt, Leigh thinks the ﬂower is for her, from him. ‘‘When’re you coming home?’’ In his mind, Tony is home. ‘‘I’m leaving now.’’ ‘‘Wake me up.’’ Tony barely hears her words. Rather, he realizes that he will stop acting—not quit, but move on—and not backwards, looking back like a novelist, but forward, looking ahead—less like a visionary than a ‘‘normal’’ person. In his opinion, he has not been that for a long time—and he wants it—the normalcy, the I’m-withyou-ness that he despised unwisely when he started to remake himself. He loves Leigh and he loves, too, the person who loves her—he is that person. He understands this now and decides that he will try to remain that person. But then his heart tightens. He is afraid that he will never see Leigh again. Sharply, he tells her, ‘‘Don’t go to sleep without me,’’ and ﬁnally lowers his voice to say, ‘‘All day I’ve missed you.’’\n\n................. 17066$\n\n$CH1\n\n08-13-08 15:36:26\n\nPS PAGE 28\n\nCarol Bonomo Albright 29\n\nThe Night Maggie Saw God and Sal Barnum Too Carol Bonomo Albright Fiction (1994)\n\nMa ggie , Pe ggy, Mar gie . These were all names Michela had assumed in her quest to become American. Born Michela Guerrisi, she said, ‘‘I died. I wanted to hide under my desk and never come out when my teacher called my name for the roll in school.’’ But she didn’t die—though in her own mind, she always remained ‘‘in-between.’’ And within that in-betweenness there was one night when Maggie saw God and Sal Barnum too. Maggie had gone to Parrazza’s funeral home on Bleecker Street, where the southern Italians were buried from, for Vito’s wake. On the day he died, Vito was helping a ragman deliver his merchandise to a factory, which was understaffed because people were dropping like ﬂies from the ﬂu. The ragman, arms outstretched, head down, forced to stare at the cobblestones he walked on, maneuvered his cart from behind. The faded wagon was piled high with rags, slabs of cardboard, felt, bits and pieces of stuff, too dirty to know what the original was. Today the wagon was so overloaded that he couldn’t put it down without toppling half its contents. The ragman turned his head towards the sidewalk and saw Vito, a well-built kid in his twenties. ‘‘Hey, kid, I give you a penny. You come ’ere help me.’’ Vito agreed. It was better than staying upstairs and stringing tags, a thousand for twenty cents, which his mother would want him to do, along with his two brothers and sister, when she got home from work. The whole family poked a short piece of thin string, which they then knotted, through a hole on price tags for clothing. Not that he minded so much, but since Jesse was no longer being sent to the movie house during the day to tell the rest of them the story at night, the tag-stringing had grown boring. True, Lucy was pretty good at telling ghost stories, but this offer seemed like an easy penny to make—outside, where he wanted to be anyway. Vito thought he might see Maggie on Thompson Street. Maybe she hadn’t gone to work yet at Reo Cars. She was a looker. Mary Pickford, they called her in the neighborhood. She took his breath away. Vito, alongside the ragman, walked from Canal to Eighth Street without incident and without seeing Maggie. They avoided Washington Square Park and snaked their way up Sullivan and MacDougal instead, passing St. Anthony’s Church. Vito liked St. Anthony’s, especially the lower church with its ﬂickering candles in the red glass containers, its statues in their niches, six on either side of the altar, its paintings on the walls. Vito himself had drawn some pictures. He\n\n................. 17066$\n\n$CH1\n\n08-13-08 15:36:26\n\nPS PAGE 29\n\n30 the night maggie saw g od and sal barnum too\n\ndrew one of St. Michael, the archangel, who when you died, weighed your good and bad deeds on his scale to decide if you belonged in heaven or hell. But he had put Maggie’s face on the picture he drew. Vito thought Maggie held his fate in the balance. A smile from her sent him to heaven. Though Maggie was quiet and had a sweet smile, she had courage too. Hadn’t she been the ﬁrst Italian to be hired as a secretary by Reo Cars uptown? Vito knew the archangel wouldn’t mind having Maggie’s face on the drawing. It was only the face Vito had changed. He kept the hair the same—long and wavy like Maggie’s. Vito liked to draw. The ﬁsh man with the basement store, he drew as St. Peter—even though the ﬁsh man wasn’t Catholic. After all, St. Peter was a Jew once too. Vito didn’t know anyone who was a carpenter, so he put a pickax in St. Joseph’s hands and drew his Uncle Tedor’s face. Vito sometimes thought his mother had an extra set of eyes outside her head, so St. Lucy with her eyes on a platter had his mother’s face. And Pino with the fruit and vegetable pushcart on Spring Street, Vito dressed as St. Francis, walking in the ﬁelds among the olive trees and artichokes. Maggie’s mother Teresina, who made her own wine and anisette, he drew as St. Theresa of the Little Flower and the midwife ’Magala became St. Anne. Gabriel, the other archangel holding a balance, Vito painted with the face of the butcher, Biaggio the bulldog—his big thumb pressing down heavily on the scale. Vito’s mother laughed when she saw that picture instead of yelling at him for wasting his time drawing and dreaming. He and the ragman continued their walk uptown. They stopped at the curb by the entrance to the building. ‘‘Help me get this up the curbstone,’’ the ragman mumbled through his gray beard, dotted with specks of dust. Vito walked to the front of the wagon, bent over, and hunched his shoulders under its bottom. As the ragman pushed, Vito lifted with his shoulders and back. He heaved. The ragman pushed one more time. The wagon teetered. They steadied it, lifted and pushed again; the wheels rose over the curb. They quickly steered the wagon into the main room of the factory and started to unload it. Two temporary employees weighed the rags; the boss paid the ragman. Vito got his penny. The factory owner offered Vito a nickel to wash the rags before shipping them out. Vito whistled. A nickel was two hundred strung tags. He agreed. Actually, he didn’t mind working. It would all help put Dominic through medical school. Dominic was the smart one . . . remembered everything he learned. Any work Vito got helped the whole family. He climbed the stairs and stood on the narrow platform surrounding the large vat, grabbed the paddle and began to walk along the platform, stirring and agitating the bubbling water and rags as the boss had shown him. It was harder work than he thought. The rising steam enveloped him. He was sweating heavily. He peered down into the soapy water. Pieces of cloth, their colors just becoming visible—maroon, tan, blue—bobbed up and down. Vito put the paddle down, wiped his brow and leaned over the vat from the waist—the upper half of his\n\n................. 17066$\n\n$CH1\n\n08-13-08 15:36:27\n\nPS PAGE 30\n\nCarol Bonomo Albright 31\n\nbody hanging over the rim of the vat—staring intently at one glittering piece of cloth. It would make a pretty bow for Maggie’s hair. The penny in his shirt pocket fell out. He had worked hard for that penny. Dominic would appreciate it. Vito grabbed for it but he lost his footing on the soapy, wet ﬂoor. He tried to right himself, grabbing for the rim. It slipped from his grasp; his ﬁngers stretched and hooked again. At lunc hti me the boss came by on his way to eat. ‘‘Where the hell is that kid?’’ he muttered, staring up at the platform. By the time they found him—he had never learned to swim and besides the water was boiling hot—Vito was dead. His mother’s boss called her away from the table where she was packing chocolate-covered cherries to identify him. She put down the half-ﬁlled box and wiped her hands on her green apron. Gondolpha, a coworker who was wrapping her 8,347th piece of hard candy of the day, gave a quick twist to the cellophane and shelved her box to accompany Magdalena. Following the paesan, who came over to say he thought it was Vito who was in an accident, they trudged over to the building, looked at the body, half blue from drowning and half red from the boiling water, with harlequin patches of cloth rags clinging to it. His mother screamed and scratched at her face, then fainted. The paesan went to get Dominic to claim Vito’s body and make arrangements with the undertaker. Vito’s body lay on the platform surrounding the tub. Dominic, staring in anguish at his brother, waited for the undertaker to arrive. Dominic stepped closer to look at Vito’s ﬁngers, which had drawn so many pictures. He lifted one of his brother’s hands gingerly, shuddered slightly, and then held it in both his own. He rubbed the now cold skin as tears fogged his glasses. He removed his glasses and wiped his eyes with the back of his hand. He let out a thin sigh. His breath seemed to be caught in his chest, beating against his ribs. A ﬂy buzzed by Dominic’s ear. He swatted at it, but missed, coming down heavily on the side of his head. His ear rang; his heart pounded like a volcano. With a heavy step, he moved back from Vito to make way for the undertaker, but he didn’t let go of Vito’s hand. He walked alongside his brother, rhythmically patting Vito’s hand, then caressing it. He choked back a sob, until the gray dusk became night. W h e n M a g g i e joined the mourners at Parrazzo’s, she paid her respects to Vito’s mother and to Lucy, whom she had gone to school with at PS 8. She was about to offer her condolences to Dominic, but she faltered, startled: he stared intently at the casket and seemed not to know where he was. His glasses, slightly askew on his face, magniﬁed his red-rimmed eyes. Maggie turned and kneeled in front of the casket and said a prayer—not only for Vito but for Dominic too. His poor mother, she thought. Vito dead and Dominic looking more dead than alive.

Maggie knew Ralphie, Magdalena’s husband, angry in the morning, angry at night when he returned home, cursing along the hallways as he lumbered to their ﬁfth-ﬂoor apartment. Why do the good always die? Maggie wondered. Maggie made way for the paid mourners, three women in black, hired in case no one showed up for the wake. She sat in the last row of folding chairs and watched the others who came to pay their respects. And that was when she saw a god and Sal Barnum too. His name wasn’t really Sal Barnum. It was Salvatore Barone, also known as Sal Barnum, a Castle Garden ofﬁcial’s best transcription of his father’s name when he entered New York in 1883. Sal wore a navy blue suit. His auburn hair was smoothed back, sleek. She saw him in proﬁle, with a cigarette between his lips. The small mole on his straight nose made him look distinguished. She didn’t realize she was staring at him. She had been brought up not to look at boys. Her mother beat her once because she thought Maggie was wearing rouge, but she wasn’t: she always had a high complexion. She caught herself staring and forced her eyes away from this man who looked like a god to her. As Sal rose from the kneeler, he too walked to the last row of chairs. He sat next to Maggie and nodded to her. ‘‘I hope my cigarette doesn’t bother you.’’ Maggie assured him it didn’t. They sat for a while longer. He couldn’t think of anything else to say. Her looks were making him tongue-tied. Rose, her older married sister, lived in his building so he knew Maggie even though he had never spoken to her before. Rose was a beauty too. Olive skin with cheeks a rosy tinge that made her name appropriate. But Maggie was something else: blonde, fair, high cheekbones, a serenity in her hazel eyes that made you want to know more about her and the mysteries she held. When she rose from her chair and smoothed her skirt, Sal stood up too. He put out his cigarette and turned to face her, peering into her eyes. She gave just a hint of a shy smile. Was that an invitation? ‘‘I live in the same building as your sister Rose,’’ he began. ‘‘Can I walk you home?’’ She nodded. He took out another cigarette and tapped it on its silver case. ‘‘Sure you don’t mind?’’ He held the cigarette in his lips, unlit, until they reached the sidewalk. Then he stopped, cupped his hand over the tip and lit up. The orange-red glow of the cigarette burned bright in the darkness. The night air was pleasant and the sky was particularly inky. Fireﬂies had drifted away from the park to send out their light to attract a mate. Sal and Maggie walked along silently, his heart pounding. She mumbled something about how in the daytime the ﬁreﬂies kept cool in the trees in the park. He murmured his agreement, though what he agreed to he didn’t know. He was so nervous he was having trouble hearing. Or was it that his heart was pounding so loud. He could barely keep his cigarette from shaking and moved it swiftly from hand to hand. The burning tip streaked across the night like the glow of a ﬁreﬂy in motion.\n\n................. 17066$\n\n$CH1\n\n08-13-08 15:36:29\n\nPS PAGE 32\n\nCarol Bonomo Albright\n\n33\n\n‘‘Look at that sliver of moon,’’ he began. ‘‘It sure is beautiful.’’ Maggie nodded. ‘‘That’s why the ﬁreﬂies are out. . . . It’s a dark night and they’re here where it’s darker than in the park with its lamplights,’’ she said. Their elbows touched; they continued strolling along in silence for a while, taking pleasure in being together and in the ﬁreﬂies. The streets were mostly deserted except for an occasional neighbor sitting on a stoop enjoying the nighttime breeze and the evening hush. Sal and Maggie could hear faint strains of the aria, Mi chiamano Mimi, ﬂoating through an open window. Maggie hummed along softly. Sal cleared his throat. ‘‘It’s too bad about Vito,’’ Sal said. ‘‘He was a hard worker. Who knows what he would have become?’’ He stared at the ground, thinking about Vito’s lost future. He shook himself out of his reverie and then added, ‘‘His brother Dominic wants to be a doctor. But tonight he looked more like he needed one.’’ Sal felt he was rambling. They had reached Thompson Street where Maggie lived. ‘‘Isn’t that the tenement where Fiorello La Guardia lives?’’ Sal asked, pointing to the one next door to Maggie’s building. Maggie said yes. ‘‘He’s for people like us,’’ she said. ‘‘He’s making a name for himself . . . got elected to Congress.’’ ‘‘Who would have guessed it,’’ Sal responded, ‘‘with a name like that, Fiorello? These names we have, they don’t sound American. I dropped the ‘e’ off Salvatore to make it more American. And even though I was registered in school as Sal Barnum, I knew my name was Barone. I wouldn’t change that.’’ Just as they reached the stoop of Maggie’s tenement, Rocco seemed to come out of nowhere. Sal jumped back and made way for him. He quickly removed his hat in an exaggerated tip to Rocco. ‘‘Maggie, I’ve been looking for you. Your mother said you’d be along any minute.’’ He muscled Sal out of the way. Sal took another step back, faltered and dropped his half-smoked cigarette. ‘‘Maggie,’’ Rocco whispered, ‘‘I got something for you.’’ He followed her up the steps. Sal hung back. Rocco stood a step below Maggie, his back to Sal. Maggie’s face was visible over Rocco’s head. She was looking intently at whatever it was Rocco was holding. ‘‘Oh no,’’ Sal heard Maggie saying. ‘‘That’s awfully nice of you, Rocco, but what would I do with something like that?’’ She smiled sweetly. Rocco moved up a step, on the same level now as Maggie. As he turned sideways, Sal could see the small jewelry box in his hand. ‘‘Here,’’ he said emphatically, ‘‘take it. Whadaya mean, what would you do with it? You’d put it on your ﬁnger.’’ Maggie protested. Sal took the stairs two at a time. ‘‘Isn’t that your brother Louie out the window?’’ he asked. They all looked up. Sal put himself between Maggie and Rocco, careful to give him no offense. All three peered at the third story of the building.\n\n................. 17066$\n\n$CH1\n\n08-13-08 15:36:30\n\nPS PAGE 33\n\n34 the n ight maggie saw god and sal barnum too\n\nLouie was indeed there. Maggie waved. Rocco retreated. Sal moved closer to Maggie. The ﬁreﬂies glowed against the red brick building. He cupped his hands and caught one. He held it over her slim ﬁngers like a living jewel, the heart of God beating between them. He wanted that moment to go on forever and only reluctantly let the ﬁreﬂy go. Sal took Maggie’s hands and enclosed them. His hands were trembling just a bit, but they were trembling. ‘‘You did a very brave thing, coming between me and that Rocco—and him a married man. You were smart about it . . . the way you said my brother was watching from the window. Not even Rocco would be disrespectful to a girl in front of her brother.’’ Sal said nothing. He motioned Maggie to keep her hands cupped. Then he caught another ﬁreﬂy and put it in her hands before opening the door for her. ‘‘I enjoyed our walk together.’’ ‘‘Oh, I did too,’’ Maggie said. ‘‘So much. Thanks for walking me home.’’ Sal was encouraged. ‘‘Maybe we could go out another time . . . I know a nice restaurant.’’ Maggie said she’d like that a lot. He assured her he’d be in touch. Maggie whispered a good night. Her throat felt dry. She had always wanted to hold a ﬁreﬂy, to see its light close up. Nobody had ever done that for her. She gazed at the ﬁreﬂy, glowing with life. Then she peeked out of the doorway and watched Sal walking down the street until he faded into the darkness, no longer visible. But it seemed to Maggie as if he had never left her and never would leave her. The ﬁreﬂy was the proof of the beauty in her life, a gift from heaven. The wind came up, swirling the street debris of cloth scraps in ever faster and tighter circles and twists and chasing the ﬁreﬂies back to the park with its trees, banging the cellar door and rattling the bakery store window until rain beat against the pavement. Maggie took the ﬁreﬂy upstairs and placed it in a jar. The rain had abated a bit, falling more gently than before. She opened the window, unscrewed the lid of the jar and let the glowworm ﬂy free to join its mates. As she watched its little light blinking in the navy sky, she was sure that her action would please Vito, and he’d be happy to know too that on this night Maggie had met Sal ‘‘Barnum’’ Barone and would no longer feel in-between.\n\n................. 17066$\n\n$CH1\n\n08-13-08 15:36:31\n\nPS PAGE 34\n\nJoseph Papaleo\n\n35\n\nSizes Joseph Papaleo Fiction (1994)\n\n‘‘ I don ’t c are what you heard your girlfriend Mary told you. I don’t think the Escort or the Chevette or the Rabbit or even the Cockroach, and I don’t care what else you call them in Japanese, is not the right size, any of them.’’ ‘‘But I want a small car, Pa. You understand, I want a small car and not a big bazoom—though if you wanted to buy me a Merc, I wouldn’t ﬁght you.’’ ‘‘You, my dear, you think everything is the style and the color. Even the size to you is the style. But I am not talking about what’s in style. I am talking about a chassis, a protection in the car you drive that’s not just the pieces pasted together. Gabeesh?’’ ‘‘Yes, I gabeesh,’’ she said, her voice going down. Her father did not pick up the appeasement in the tone and kept on. ‘‘A small car is like a paper tiger, you know what I mean? Pretty on the outside and tissue paper if you hit a dog.’’ Her father assumed a stance. She knew it was his way of making the mood lighter. Denise examined him. She looked away from the wrinkles around his chin, like small knife cuts—the way a sheet of typing paper makes a cut. She watched the driveway lined with cars, her mother’s large Mercury, Johnny’s Camaro, and, at the end, her father’s big black Mercedes. Her father was pacing before her like the dog when it wanted to go out. She saw his tuxedo jacket pulling at his sides, as if he had two hip guards in place there. But he looked handsome in his white jacket. He had that look. He loved to go formal. ‘‘Where is it you went out today?’’ she asked. ‘‘Today was the ﬁrst Cotillion at the club.’’ The words were uncomfortable for him. ‘‘Your mother’s vice president this year, so I had ’a look dressy. I didn’t have a choice. It was daylight on the lawn.’’ ‘‘Don’t kid me, you love it,’’ Denise said. He walked across the kitchen to his daughter and leaned down, almost touching her face: ‘‘And how come you know everything, you little peanut?’’ She put her right ﬁnger on his nose. ‘‘Because I’m smarter than you, that’s why. Didn’t you know women are the superior breed?’’ ‘‘That’s what they tell me. Except with cars. How long before you all become automotive engineers?’’ He walked to the refrigerator and opened the brown door. ‘‘Will you tell me if your mother still does any shopping around here? I can’t ﬁnd a glass of mineral water in here.’’ She saw his face lit up, left her chair and pushed him away from the door. ‘‘I knew it would be right in front of your nose. What is this green bottle?’’\n\n................. 17066$\n\n$CH1\n\n08-13-08 15:36:32\n\nPS PAGE 35\n\n36 sizes\n\n‘‘The San Pellegrino.’’ ‘‘The San Pellegrino.’’ Her repetition made her father smile like a boy, and she continued. ‘‘Listen, you are damn lucky I didn’t ask you for a Mazda RX or a 280Z.’’ Her father sat where she had been sitting and watched her pour a glass full of the water. ‘‘You bet your sweet life,’’ he said. ‘‘And you would get a Jap car over my dead body. This much I’ll tell you right now. Nobody will take me on that trip again.’’ He had the glass in the air and was shaking it for emphasis. ‘‘There’s one mechanic who ﬁxes it, he’s in South Jersey, and the parts—they’re in Poughkeepsie. For ten times the price of what we got here.’’ ‘‘But I still don’t want a big load. I haven’t starting smoking cigars yet, you know.’’ She moved back by instinct and let her weight fall back on the sink. Mr. Polero drank his water slowly and made her sweat. Then he said, ‘‘And now I got another comedian in the family. Listen to me, Joan Rivers. A medium car is not a big load, you know. Take a two-door. Go out and see some Chevvies. Take a look inside. GM is a sensible car.’’ Denise walked to the white archway that led to the dining room and the hallway. ‘‘And some little ones are sensible, too. Didn’t Johnnie have a Fiat Brava a long time?’’ ‘‘Him? Him you don’t look at. And the Fiat Brava they don’t even dare import anymore. But your brother and his friends, they can handle a breakdown on the road, they can tune a car, they can change points on the spot. For you, you want a dependable, solid thing in your hands.’’ ‘‘All right. But I read up on the Escort and the Lynx, which is the Mercury version. They have heft.’’ Her father assumed the pose again: she called him Mussolini many times when he was like this. ‘‘Heft?’’ he said. ‘‘And where did you learn that one?’’ ‘‘Wouldn’t you like to know?’’ Denise said. ‘‘Look, Denise, do me a favor, will you? Don’t get me too excited for once? And listen to me once in a while, at least about men things. Like maybe I had more experience in cars than your friend Mary has. And that I buy ten trucks at a time for my stores and maybe through the years I learned a little about cars you don’t have to read up on?’’ ‘‘I showed you the Consumer’s Guide, Pa. And I asked you to discuss it. They have testers, engineers or whatever. Remember what they said ﬁrst about the Honda, and then everybody who bought one said the same thing.’’ ‘‘And I’m telling you years of experience is worth more than some little magazine you buy. Don’t you think those magazines take a little payoff from a company now and then to help the sales?’’ ‘‘You said that about Ralph Nader, also without any facts. These organizations get letters every day from car owners—about what the cars do—and then they test—and test—’’\n\n................. 17066$\n\n$CH1\n\n08-13-08 15:36:32\n\nPS PAGE 36\n\nJoseph Papaleo 37\n\n‘‘Denise, I swear to you.’’ Mr. Polero stood up and placed his glass neatly on the cloth and looked at it. He said, slowly looking up, ‘‘Denise, let me tell you, I do not shoot my mouth off. I have talked many years with mechanics, friends of mine. I have thirty years of retailing under my belt. I talk when I know about something. The question I ask of you is why don’t you trust me?’’ She had begun to pace as he had earlier. ‘‘Because this is not a trust thing, Pop. You haven’t yet said one bad factual thing about a small car. Not one thing. Give me a list of things that show they are worse than mid-size, for example. That’s all I ask, give me a list. But your mind was made up in nineteen seventyone. Nothing good could come out after then. So you don’t even look at the little cars of today; you just condemn them.’’ ‘‘So is that what you think I am? He who condemns without looking?’’ ‘‘No, I don’t think that. I’ve been your daughter twenty-three years. And just go ask Momma.’’ ‘‘Ask your mother what? Ask the lasagna expert about compact and mid-size cars? Sometimes you make me sick, you know that? Y"
