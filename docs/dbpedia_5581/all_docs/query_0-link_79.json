        "text": "Every nation gets the leader it deserves. And Italy deserves Berlusconi. The Italian Premier is bully, braggart and buffoon rolled into one. He stands accused of avoiding paying millions in taxes and his government is pushing through an immunity law to save him from corruption charges. Now in his new role of leading the European Union he has sparked an international row with his Nazi jibe against a German MEP.\n\nYet, Silvio Berlusconi mirrors perfectly his countrymen's view of themselves. It pains me, half-Italian, to say this. But look at the evidence.\n\nThe British since Shakespeare's time have cherished Italy and Italians for their sunny climate and disposition, boundless artistic heritage, delicious food and sensual lovers. But, as contemporary chroniclers of Italian life from Luigi Barzini Jr to Tobias Jones have noted, ask any Italian what they think of their country and you will hear only criticisms: it is inefficient, polluted, cramped; the people are backward, lazy and arrogant.\n\nIt's a self-hatred that stems from a history of invasions which required demeaning compromises on the part of the locals; the bitter division between a prosperous north and a struggling south; the suspicion that Italy is a pretend nation, 'a geographical expression' cobbled together into a fragile unit by exalted idealists little more than 100 years ago. Add to this bleak picture the disastrous war record since unification, and the dark days of fascism, and you can see why, on those rare state occasions when the national anthem, 'Fratelli d'Italia', is played, Italians refuse to rise to their feet, but instead fidget, whisper and look embarrassed.\n\nToday's Italian culture doesn't exactly inspire citizens with pride; rather, it provides escapism or self-lacerating critiques. Italians watch an average four hours of TV a day (Berlusconi owns three of the main channels) and, apart from American imports, they will feast on banal quiz shows starring half-naked girls, and cookery programmes spiced with inane jokes. Bestsellers feature tales of drugs, Mafia, and corruption, and sport titles such as Italia Sporca (Dirty Italy) and Italia Ladra (Thieving Italy).\n\nEven the country's unrivalled cultural heritage fails to promote any sense of proud nationhood: the great visual masterpieces focus on God, Madonnas and - later - individuals; Dante's La Divina Commedia focuses on heaven, hell and Florentine politics. Italians' own favourite literary classic, I Promessi Sposi (The Betrothed) is a love story set in medieval times; and the most memorable character to emerge from Italian fiction is Carlo Collodi's Pinocchio, a lying puppet.\n\nFrom Pinocchio to Mussolini and now Berlusconi: it's a logical progression of lies, boasts and posturing. Pinocchio pretended that he was a real child; Mussolini that he was the leader of an invincible army; Berlusconi that he is the Condottiere who galvanises his people into claiming a seat at high table in the international arena.\n\nItalians, practised in this kind of carrying on, shrug cynically. What can you expect of a fellow Italian but that he should embarrass you in public? He'll blow hot, then cold, puffing himself up with self-importance: but in the end, nothing changes. For even Berlusconi is not much worse than what came before him: there were no heroes to mourn, and no halcyon days to recapture with his overthrow. Recognising this, Italians embrace their future with fatalism. It means they'll put up with a jerk who insults a nation in their name - but under the circumstances, their resignation is far less devastating than any fond hope of a better tomorrow.\n\nThe lady first\n\nMeeting Bill Clinton when you're eight and a half months pregnant makes you feel like the little boy who is handed a delicious-looking ice cream cone - only to find out it's made of plastic: you can't do a thing. Blocked by your huge stomach, every notion of flirting is frustrated - and you have to make do with watching everyone else at it. It was Hillary Clinton's book launch, and the event provided an interesting study in power politics. Hillary and Bill arrived together but spent the evening apart. She, radiating confidence and ambition, took centre stage, speaking briefly about her delight in her book's reception - and even cracking a few self-deprecating jokes about competing with Harry Potter's publication ('No, no, really, I don't mind his success'). He, looking thin and sipping Coke, was relegated to signing his wife's book and chit-chatting with fans. These were principally female: a Lady Derry, falling out of a full-length pink ballgown; a giggling woman who wouldn't stop taking snaps of the President; and a seasoned journalist who introduced herself to him, shook his hand, and then wouldn't let go. At the end, though, British politics took over. Philip Gould strode across the lawn of Kensington Palace, talking into his mobile; coming from the opposite end of the lawn, Alastair Campbell was talking into his mobile; and walking between them was Ben Bradshaw, also deep in conversation with his mobile. Their paths crossed, but not one of them looked up or acknowledged the others. New Labour at it.\n\nMary, Mary, very contrary\n\nMary Archer, the ice queen, lost it. Or at least, she mouthed the word 'bitch' in public. The incident made headlines even in the broadsheets - and reminded me of another ice queen who suddenly snapped. Anna Ford famously threw a glass of wine at Jonathan Aitken, after he fired her unceremoniously from Breakfast TV. It remains the anecdote that everyone remembers about the newsreader - and it rescued her reputation from blandness. The Anna whom everyone regarded as a bit of a goody-two-shoes had shown that she had red hot blood coursing in her veins. I suspect the 'b' word will do the same for Lady Archer. No more boring sobriquets such as 'fragrant' and 'blindly loyal' for our Mary; from now on, this lady wants to be known as feisty, fiery and fearsome. And what Mary wants, Mary usually gets."
