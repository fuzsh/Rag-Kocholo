BRIEFER MENTION 20 NOTES 21 LIST OF NEW BOOKS 21 THE JAUNDICED EYE. It has long been the fashion for writers of our English race, from the vantage-ground of a conservatism assumed (without very close in- quiry) as our peculiar birthright, to speak in slighting or scornful terms of the fickleness of the multitude as exemplified in the history of other peoples. Ancient Athenians and modern Frenchmen have served alike to point the moral, and the study of their history gives repeated warning of the dangers that flow from instability of purpose. It is only the firmly-anchored char- acter that may withstand the tempests of passion. and hold to its moorings despite the angry onset of winds and waves. There is much, indeed, in the recorded experience of both England and America to warrant our complacency in this respect, and we have achieved many victories of civilization in peaceful ways when a more tur- bident stock would have thought bloodshed the necessary accompaniment and consecration. But a nation, no less than an individual, has a character that is subject to modifications, and these modifications, insensible in their daily or yearly effect, may in time come to acquire a cumulative impetus that will prove formidable, and will threaten what have hitherto been thought to be the very bulwarks of the nation's life. Principles and ideals that have stood in seeming integrity for generations may succumb to corrosive influences that have been working upon them in silence and concealment until the column has become a shell and the corner-stone a honeycomb. We had some startling revela- tions in this sense a few years ago, when we discovered that the Declaration of Independence was to be held as naught in the presence of the opportunity to subjugate a foreign people, and that the Monroe Doctrine had suffered a sea- change, being transformed from a statement of mutual international obligations into an arrogant pronouncement of national selfishness. With these and other developments of recent years in mind, we may hardly lay to our soids the flat- tering unction that we are immune to the temptations that lead other nations into the paths of vainglorious folly. Colonel Higginson once informed us that the possession of an added drop of nervous fluid marked our national differentiation from the parent stock, and made us a superior people. We may admit the added element without being altogether sure that its physiological action is for good. There are some indications, in fact, that it makes for instability and bad temper and irrational conduct. If we are lacking in the power to see life steadily and see it whole, to that extent we become prone to prejudice and deaf to the counsels of sobriety. And grave problems are pressing upon us, quite as grave as any we have faced in the past, which demand for their solution the unprejudiced outlook and the sober judgment. We are called upon to 6 THE DIAL [Jan. 1, grapple with corruption in business and politics, with social injustice, and with the ethical an- archy that attends the breaking up of outworn religious systems. To work regeneration in these departments of activity is our twentieth- century task, and it is as big a task as we have ever been called upon to undertake. Our chief danger will be found in the spirit of recklessness, for the eagerness of unbalanced reformers for immediate residts is likely to destroy the good with the bad, and to set back our civilization in the very name of progress. A foreigner who should judge us by our news- papers, and especially by such of our newspapers as have the largest circidation, would be bound to set us down as one of the most emotional of peoples in our dealings with the graver issues of life. The success of those journals is so clearly due to their sensational appeal, their cheap sentimentalism, and their flattery of the mob, that it becomes pertinent to ask if they have not gauged their public with a fair degree of discernment. This impression finds further emphasis in the very marked recent tendency of our weekly and monthly periodicals to aban- don their old-time traditional dignity and copy the sensation-mongering methods of the daily press. And when we find the novelists marking out their course upon the same lines, we may feel pretty sure that a new social force is at work, likely in the long run to have very con- siderable consequences. It is of the novelists that we wish particularly to speak, for so many of them have turned tractarian of late that the most fetching title is nowadays more likely than not to label some social nostrum or other, or to return an indict- ment of some phase of our national life, or to preach, with hardly an effort to disguise it, some new doctrinaire gospel. An excellent example is Mr. Herbert Quick's \" The Broken Lance,\" which keeps within the lines of legitimate fiction until the reader is fairly committed, and then becomes an exhibition of the peculiar form of monomania known to readers of single-tax liter- ature. The adoption of a new form of taxation is to prove the panacea for all the ills of society ; and those ills, of course, are skilf idly aggravated to make the application of the remedy seem the more urgent. Another illustration is found in \" The Convert,\" by Miss Elizabeth Robins, who finds the primal source of all wrong (as far as women is concerned) in the fact that the strong and selfish sex insists upon keeping political rights within its own control. The exploitation of dishonesty in business and financial affairs (with the strong implication that nothing but dishonesty is to be found in those quarters) has now for several years been a favorite theme of the novelists, who explain the inner workings of bank and railway and insurance corporations, of market manipulators, and of industrial establishments, with a thorough- ness that quite convinces the average reader that the real thing is under his observation. It is particularly noble of these novelists thus to waste themselves upon precept when they might be enjoyed in practice, for even the profits accruing from a \" best seller \" are trifling in comparison with the profits of the enterprises under their con- sideration, and it is quite evident that commercial success would be in their grasp if only they cared to reach for it. No one so familiar with the ways of thievery could fail to hold his own in the game of wits which these writers assume all business to be. Political corruption is another hard-worked theme of these reformers by example. Their method, with slight variations, is to show us the successful politician surrounded by his hench- men, and, by means of intimidation or bribery, holding the public in the hollow of his hand. When this picture is drawn in detail, the modern David appears upon the scene, and the pebble from his sling does the rest. Goliath is laid low, and the situation receives peculiar piquancy if he has a daughter whom David loves. The federal judge (who is in reality the most inde- pendent official in our entire system) is a favor- ite victim of the sort of novel now in question, and the villainy which his mask of dignity con- ceals is relentlessly exposed. All this muck-raking has two unfortunate consequences. It presents as a whole a picture of our national life that is absolutely untypical, however exactly an occasional instance may exemplify it. The foreign observer, reading of this welter of corruption and crime in which our novelists so delightedly plimge us, get an impression as false as that which we, for exam- ple, get of French life from the study of modem French fiction. Taking a more practical view of this consequence, it may be remarked that the foreigner, reading a lurid account of our meat-packing industry, renounces our steaks and sausages; reading of our insurance \"graft- ers,\" he cancels his policies in American com- panies; and reading of our piratical railway fmanciers, he dumps his stocks on the market. The other consequence, and the more serious of the two, is that the novelists who thus lend themselves to sensationalism are deliberately 1908.] THE DIAL putting themselves into alliance with the yellow journalism which is our chief national disgrace, and are fomenting the evil passions of greed and envy which already show ominous signs of breaking bounds and sweeping away the old landmarks of law and justice. If we cannot exhibit more restraint, even in our popular literature, than we have shown of late, we may as well give up our pretension of superior national poise and sobriety. Impulse and recklessness could not much further go than we have already allowed them to go in the late onslaught upon our social system. Under the specious plea of attacking privilege, funda- mental right is being assailed on every hand, to say nothing of the many special assaults upon individualism. The tyranny of the majority, of which Herbert Spencer made such dire prophecies, gets worse and worse, and every ex- tension of this despotism is made in the name of philanthropy. But, as Ibsen said, and Emerson long before him, all these things * aimed at by half-educated reformers are the merest externals, and could accomplish, even were they turned in the right direction, no real regeneration. \" I do not wish to remove from my present prison to a prison a little larger,\" said Emerson, \" I wish to break all prisons.\" There is nothing that we more need as a nation than a stout reaffirmation of the first principles of individualism, a substitution of clear vision for the present jaundiced gaze of too many among us, and a new realization of the fact that reforms made by precipitation or violence are apt to cost more than they are worth. THE TWO WORLDS. Has anyone ever made a census of the beings born of words — counted the population of that kingdom of the imagination which hovers above our heads in air, or invisibly occupies the spaces of the earth ? A \" Who's Who \" of the gods and godesses, heroes and heroines, villains and merrymen of literatme, would be a huge affair. All the Mythological Dictionaries, all the lists of folk-lore creations, would have to be emptied into it. All the inhab- itants of Playland and Poemland and Novelland would have to be mustered and marshalled in its pages. To the ordinary well-read man, the world of fiction is like the sky on a clear night. A few thousand bright stars are visible, while countless others are unseen or show only in the congregated gleam of the Milky Way. One curious result of such an enumeration would be to reveal that in some directions the people of fancy overcount reality. It is safe to say that there are two thousand novels published and plays brought out in England every year. It is also reasonable to estimate that each one of these productions con- tains, on an average, two members of the nobility among its characters. This would be more than ten times the membership of the House of Lords. And as the Active creation of titles has been going on for generations, the actual holders of hereditary honors in England must have been overwritten many hundred times deep. England would have to be enlarged to the size of Africa, to hold all the estates the wizards of the pen have crowded into it. And the great poets, artists, soldiers, statesmen, and financiers who have been projected by the literary imagination would make a population for a consider- able city. The shining ones of life are the favorites of fiction, and every real personage of this kind must go attended by a crowd of airy phantoms of himself, whereas the average or less than average citizen has not one chance in ten thousand of being confronted by his ghost-like similar. It is impossible really to separate the creations of the Historical Muse from those of her more imagina- tive sisters. Clio wears the same clothes and uses the same instrument of expression as Melpomene or Erato. They all depend on words to convince or inspire mankind. We say, indeed, that history is true and literature is fiction ; but in the first place this is a large and unestablished claim ; and in the second place, literature, being as a rule wrought by the g^\"eater hands, makes a deeper and more lasting impression on us. Achilles is more dazzlingly splen- did than Alexander; Trimalchio is more real than Tiberius. But the two forms of human record are everlastingly confused. Fiction deals largely with the personages and facts of history, and history borrows the interpretive and dramatic devices of lit- erature. Historic evidence, indeed, is hardly more than a jest. That certain incidents occurred and certain people lived in the past is sure; but the causes and details of those incidents and the motives and personalities of those actors are wrapped in obscurity and open to the interpretation of every new historian. Literature is defined as an imitation of life, and its world is usually conceived as a sort of a mirage of reality. In recent times, the nearer it can get to the prose and placidness of ordinary life, the better it is thought to succeed. But even in the hands of the most accomplished apostle of ennui, literature, by reason of its necessary concentration and selectiveness, is different from life. It is life reflected in the medium of a single artist's brain — colored by his moods, changed by his passions and prejudices, charged with the impressions of all he has learned of the past, imitative of the work of preceding artists. Books beget books, and char- acters create characters. The Poor Parson in Chaucer, Fielding's Parson Adams, the Vicar of Wakefield, My Uncle Toby, Dominie Sampson, and Mr. Pickwick are in lineal descent. No two writers give us the report of the same life in the same way. 8 THE DIAL [Jan. 1, French life as depicted by Hugo and Dumas is a contradiction, a destroying contrast. The New England scenes of Hawthorne and of Mrs. Freeman are equally things apart. Literature surely depends more upon the author's gift of vision, his inner per- sonality, and his skill in language, than it does upon the raw materials of nature and humanity upon which he works. Real life, indeed, is hardly more than the peg upon which he hangs the draperies of his thought. It follows that the laws of real life are inappli- cable to literature. I do not mean by *' laws \" the actual possibilities and certain consequences of human action, — though literature can transgress those also, — but the rules and conventions of good behavior. Spenser passes for a moral poet, but he draws the picture of a sensual paradise which if it could be realized in our midst would be shut up by the police. Sophocles is the most noble-minded of the Greeks, but in his (Edipus he tells a story so shocking that it could hardly be whispered about in ordinary con- versation. The peculiar sphere of literature, indeed, is the outrS, the violent, the exceptional, the unre- strained. It deals by preference with passions, vices, crimes, which we try to restrain in real life. And it pictures these in the most vivid way, isolating and toning up to them ; whereas in life they are so largely diluted with commonplace as to be hardly noticed. Of course, literature also deals with the noble and the virtuous side of life, and perhaps this side is the corrective of the other. But if it obeyed the laws we draw up to guide life, it would deal with good alone. Yet in the larger view I do not believe its exploitation of evil does any harm. An imaginative boy will go through a course of reading in English literature, — will follow the fortunes of the rakes and roues of Elizabethan and Restoration comedy, will take purses with Claude Duval and gallop the roads with Dick Turpin, — and come through the ordeal more pure and honest than an unlettered youth who has only known the expe- riences of practical life. The imaginative boy has common-sense. He does not take the apparitions of fancy for the solid appearances of the world. We all need stimulus and intoxication, and when we can get these things from literature we can largely dis- pense with them in life. The whole domain of fairy-tale, folk-lore, mythological legend, and outrS invention, is a play or game of mankind by which it tries to divert its mind from its cares and dul- nesses. It is a make-believe by which it seeks to impose on its own credulity an impossible ideal of its own power and achievements. Yet the action and reaction of life and literature are as sure as the tides. Sometimes life, by means of dsemonically gifted personages or overwhelmmg successions or combinations of events, draws litera- ture after it, — makes poets its slavish and usually insignificant copyists. Sometimes great figures, tre- mendous actions, are projected, \"all made out of the Carver's brain,\" and influence men at once or perennially. Men like Pericles, or Augustus, or Louis XIV. impose themselves on literature, dictate the tastes and forms which the artists must follow. Women like Cleopatra, or Mary Queen of Scots, carry after them a still longer train of poet-worship- pers. Great events like the Persian War, the con- quests of Caesar, or the Crucifixion, employ the pens of multitudes. On the other hand, great embodi- ments of humanity risen from some unknown depth of dreaming thought — Job, Prometheus, Don Quixote, Hamlet, to name no others, — create action in their turn, become bone of the bone, flesh of the flesh of the world. Werther, a projection of Goethe's per- sonality, swept half Germany off its feet by its revolt and sentimentality. And it is impossible to say how much the spirit of Napoleon, and hence the fates of nations, was influenced by Macpherson's Ossian. Of course, if we accept the dictum, which is at the root of modern science and philosophy, that \"there is nothing in the mind but what the senses put there,\" we must refer the creations of the mind back to experience, and so make literature and life one. But the dictum is not true. The eternal laws of thought are in the mind, and the germs of origination and difference. If this were not so, all minds would be pretty much alike ; for they all go through pretty much the same experience. Is literature, then, a creation? M. Rodin, the great French sculptor — I do not say realistic sculptor, for he is too universal for such a label — brushes the idea aside with the remark that \" none but fools imagine we create.\" Is that so? There is M. Rodin's Balzac. Without denying its power, all opinion asserts that the statue is not like Balzac, or anybody else. For any resemblance to reality, M. Rodin might just as well have carved a chimera or a snark. If, then, a man produces something which was never in the world before, and which but for him would never have existed, is it not very near to our idea of creation ? Art springs from the marriage of experience and revery. It is true that if a man goes on copying and reproducing the work of past artists, his efforts will lack that freshness and newness which are the signs of creative work. But he will also lose this freshness and newness if he copies, without inspiration, the frail, dull figures of humanity. To my mind, M. Rodin's statues are the most ideal of modern times — - the ones most informed with thought, inspired beyond the semblance of life. I am disposed to think that the highest kind of creative intellect does not allow itself to be much dis- turbed by reality. The man himself may be pitch- forked into all kinds of action, but he does not take experience greedily or readily. A few forms or movements of life he seizes upon, and with these he retires into his cave, and, brooding over them — aerating them with his own imaginations, twisting and twining them into a thousand shapes — he finally produces the new thing which we recognize as the work of genius. Solitude is the prerequisite for all great work. It is only the warrior who sulks in his tent who can turn the tide of battle with a single shout. Charles Leoistabd Moore. 1908.] THE DIAL CASUAL COMMENT. An English Hall of Fame now threatens to cause as much discussion and fault-finding as has the similar temple to renown in this comitry. The dome of the re-decorated and recently re-opened British Museum reading-room is divided into twenty spaces, of which a clock occupies one, while to the nineteen others are assigned nineteen names — \" the greatest and most representative in English literature \" — chosen by the Museum trustees. The names raised to lasting honor in that stately dome are — Chaucer, Caxton, Tindale, Spenser, Shakespeare, Bacon, Milton, Locke, Addison, Swift, Pope, Gibbon, Wordsworth, Scott, Byron, Carlyle, Macaulay, Tennyson, and Browning. Glaring omissions will at once be noted by everyone, but no two amended lists will exactly agree. In general, the exclusion of novelists will excite comment and criticism. Scott, to be sure, is snatched from oblivion; but only because he wrote some excellent poetry before he produced still better prose. The trustees regard fiction as \" less import- ant than anj-^ other branch of literary art.\" Exemplary Britons ! Tindale and Locke and Addison are duly grate- ful: before a bench of judges more appreciative of the flower of imaginative literature their claims might have suffered. But even counting out Fielding, Dickens, and Thackeray, we note with some surprise and regret the absence of Goldsmith, Johnson, Burns, Shelley, and Keats, not to speak of Dryden, Bunyan, Burke, and Ruskin. Still, we are thankful, on the whole, that the responsibility of selecting the nineteen greatest names in English literature was not placed upon our shoulders. • • • Whittier relics at Haverhill were on exhibition in abimdance at the celebration there of his hundredth birthday ; but the most interesting display of Whittierana was at the public library, in the building that the poet himself helped to dedicate thirty-two years ago when he wrote for the occasion his now famihar poem, \" The Library,\" which was set to music by B. J. Lang and sung at the dedicatory exercises. Except one private collec- tion, the Haverhill accumulation of Whittier books and manuscripts and other matter is probably the largest in existence. It contains more than three hundred items, including of course most of the editions of the poet's writings and (most valuable of all) a file of the \" Haver- hill Gazette,\" to which Whittier contributed the greater number of his early poems, often under anassumed name. How many of his obscurely published poems have never been collected or even identified, no one can tell; but their number must be large. The entire collection at the Haverhill library, with its suggestion of much still imcoUected matter, impresses the observer with the modest Quaker poet's great and ready productivity. Verse must have been, indeed, from his very youth, the most natural medium of expression to this American poet. ... Genius in distress is always a moving spectacle — except, perhaps, when the sufferer comes knocking at our own door with a petition for relief. A story now current concerning the unfortunate poet Francis Thompson, whose death was recently reported from London, has elements of pathos and also a touch of the marvellous, the supernatural, and the ghostly. Prob- ably the tale has lost nothing in the telling, but it is said that poor Thompson, whose fortunes once reached so low an ebb that he even resorted to match-selling and to cab-calling at theatre doors to keep body and soul together, at last became so discouraged that he decided to end his wretched existence. Saving up his pitiful little earnings until he had enough money to buy a dose of laudanum, he retired with his precious pur- chase to his chosen hamit in C event Garden Market and proceeded to drink the poison; but he had taken only half when, according to his own account, his hand was arrested, and lo! Chatterton stood by his side dissuad- ing him from the rash deed. The would-be suicide gave heed, recalling how barely the other had missed the aid and comfort that were on their way to him even as he was drinking that fatal dose of arsenic and water in the attic chamber of No. 39 Brooke Street. And so, in Thompson's case, it proved that an editor who had published some of the poet's verses and wished to pay him, liad that very day succeeded in tracing him to the chemist's shop where the laudanum had been bought. The story, whether fact or fiction, makes one regret that its hero did not live to enjoy an honored old age, and also illustrates anew the old adage that it is always darkest just before dawn. ... The perennial book-pilferer, a hardy perennial if there ever was one, continues to vex the authorities of open-shelf libraries. Our largest public library, that of Boston, loses somewhat over a thousand volumes yearly through theft — all the branch libraries being included in making up this total. But since some hundreds are annually returned as surreptitiously as they were bor- rowed, the final showing is less disheartening than are the figures published at the end of each year. Thus, of books reported missing at the central library, 240 were unostentatiously replaced on the shelves in 1902, 389 in 1903, 336 in 1904, 304 in 1905, and 251 in 1906. Moreover, there is some comfort in the official assurance \"that the books taken are principally of the cheaper sort, that many of them are books taken by children, and that in numerous instances they are taken not primarily by theft, but through informal or irregular borrowing, in disregard of the proper rules relating to charging upon a library card. It is also clear, from our experience, that many books taken from the open shelves, no doubt with the intention of returning them, never are returned; probably being thrown aside or forgotten by the irresponsible persons who took them.\" The irregular borrowing of a book for purposes of reading or study is a venial offence compared with the taking of a rare edition to fill a gap in one's private collection, or with appropriating an expensive volume in order to raise money by its sale. ... The popular patronage of public libraries appears to be fully twice as great in this country as in Great Britain — a gratifying testimonial to the practical efficiency of our highly-developed system of library management. Mr. J. Duff Brown has made a digest of the reports of three hundred public libraries in the United Kingdom ; and from this digest we learn that t)f the population supplied with free libraries only about six per cent have registered as borrowers, only two and one-half per cent visit the reading rooms, and the average number of books drawn annually by each borrower} is three. While no corresponding statistics of our own libraries are available, yet the figures published by several of them separately make a comparatively cred- itable showing. Thus, according to late reports, the number of registered borrowers in Boston is about thir- teen per cent, in Brooklyn about seventeen, in Queens- 10 THE DIAL [Jan. 1, borough and in Louisville the same, in Grand Rapids sixteen, in Bridgeport ten, while in some of the smaller commiuiities the percentage rises to forty and fifty. Even the lowest of these figures is far above the British average ; but after all it is to be regretted, and also to be wondered at, that it is not higher. If all who refused to avail themselves of their publie-hbrary privileges were to miite and to vote a suspension of the public appro- priation for library support, what a cloud of intellectual darkness would overspread the land ! An octogenarian Shakespeare scholar whom many will delight to honor with at least a silent tribute of admiration and good will as he enters on his ninth decade of useful years, is Dr. William J. Rolfe, of Cambridge — our Cambridge, the public library of which has just issued a forty-page bibliography of Rolfiana, if we may coin the word. In a chronological arrange- ment are given the books and other published writings of Dr. Rolfe, the articles written about him, and addi- tional miscellaneous matters. It is interesting to learn that this veteran of the pen began to write at fourteen, his first pieces being short reports for Lowell news- papers. From 1850 to 1868 be devoted the best of his energies to teaching. Cambridge has been his home since 1862, and for the last foi'ty years he has been mainly engaged in editorial and other hterary work, and in lecturing, holding for the last four years the presidency of the Emerson College of Oratory, in Boston. Best known to the general public as the editor of Shakespeare's plays in most handy and serviceable form, he enjoys among the learned the reputation of a leading Shakespeare scholar. \" We camiot hold mor- tality's strong hand,\" but we can hope its touch may not for many a year be laid on that busy pen. • • • Mr. James's revision of his early novels is awaited with curiosity. The announcement that he was to re-write them so far as it should be found necessary in order to bring them into harmony with his later man- ner, w^as a rather extraordinary bit of literary news. The desirability of a uniform edition of his motley-clad works, with a preface from his own hand to each vol- ume, is felt by librarians and booksellers as well as by would-be private possessors of his complete writings; but not a few readers, recalling the simple charm of \" Daisy Miller \" and \" Roderick Hudson,\" will cherish a hope that these and other early romances of his may not be retold in the maimer of \" The Ambassadors \" or « The Golden Bowl.\" \" Who am I tliat I should tam- per with a classic ? \" asked a young author when requested to revise a bit of his own work. There are those who would resent the re-clothing of \" Daisy Miller \" in more studied and elaborate dress very much as the yomig folk of all Christendom would cry out against any recasting of the tale of \" Little Red Riding Hood.\" Let Mr. James respect the classics, even those from his own pen. ... Volunteer work in library inspection is pro- ducing good results in Massachusetts, that one State in the Union whose every town enjoys free-library privi- leges. The idea was conceived by Mr. Tillinghast, chairman of the public library commission, that a corps of volunteer, unpaid inspectors, men and women disin- terestedly desirous of improving the free libraries in their neighborhood, and possessed of the requisite qualifications for the work, would effect more for the cause than the same number of paid employees, and at the same time would save to the public a considerable sum that could better be spent in carrying mto effect such plans of enlargement and improvement as they might find reason to recommend. This work of inspec- tion, which is said to cost the State of Wisconsin about $15,000 a year, is now engaged in by fifteen or twenty efficient volunteers in Massachusetts, all bending their efforts to the same end and following the same general rules, with gratifying results already manifest. In further support of the new plan, it is said that visits of hired officials are not so cordially received by librarians as those of persons giving their time and thought solely for the good of the libraries. ... A FAVORITE New England story-writer who, with Miss Sarah Orne Jewett and Mrs. Mary E. Wilkins Freeman, has the happy knack of presenting Yankee character and Yankee eccentricity in most lifelike guise, has recently passed one of the more important milestones set up along the road to remmd us of our mortality. Miss Alice Brown has no silly sensitiveness on the score of her age — there is convincing evidence to prove this — but let it here suffice that she has lived an aliquot part of a century, and we hope she may live the remaining part or parts, to continue to delight the world with the products of her fertile pen. In this hope the readers of \" Rose MacLeod,\" her serial story now appearing in \" The Atlantic,\" are surely with us. ... Competition in book circulation among libraries is not always a laudable rivalry. It might, conceivably, lead very easily to the fostering of a sort of sham circu- lation; that is, attaches and friends of the library would find no difficulty in swelling the circulation statistics of an ambitious librarian by drawing books oftener and in greater numbers than their actual needs required. The Examining Committee of the Boston Public Library reports that competition in this matter among the branch libraries is too keen, and recommends that only the total circulation of all the branches be published. Emphasis ought really to be placed on the quality rather than the quantity of the reading. Portable reading-rooms are among the innovations recommended in the Boston Public Library's interesting \" Fifty-fourth Annual Report.\" The city already has portable school-houses, and \" travelling libraries \" were long ago sent abroad on their beneficent journeys through the land; and now it is believed that portable reading-rooms \" would prove serviceable in outlying and in tenement districts.\" This plan, the reverse of lead- ing the horse to the watering-trough, has much to com- mend it. The proposed structures, besides tending to counteract the allurements of drinking-saloons and other low resorts, would presumably serve as distributing stations of books for home use. • • . New editions of « Alice in Wonderland \" are falling thick and fast from the press. From London alone word comes of five such issues — all due to the recent expiration of the 42-years copyright which the book has enjoyed under the law. Whether any healthy, normal child under the age of fifteen can see aught but foolishness in this delicious masterpiece, will never be positively determmed; but certain it is that fun-loving adults will always keep a warm place ui their hearts for Alice. She ought now to make hosts of new friends among the purchasers of inexpensive uncopyrighted books. 1908.] THE DIAL 11 t Hito lS00ks. The IjEtters of a Witty Parsox.* In an early unpublished letter, Lowell de- clared that nature had originally intended him for the church, but that in mixing the ingre- dients she had added a little too much humor and so spoiled him for pulpit purposes. Dean Hole, of pleasant memory, famous in both his spoken and his written word for the merry humor that enlivened his utterances, appears to have let no consciousness of his own drollery deter him for one moment from donning the clerical robe. In him, however, it is rather the keenly-flashing wit than the subtly indescribable but never unrecognizable touch of humor that provokes one's mirth ; but, for that matter, per- haps the same could be said of Lowell. Be that as it may, the selection from the Dean's letters that Mr. Dewar has edited, with a brief memoir, contains some very enjoyable specimens of the writer's playful fancy, and gives us a charming sketch of him in undress to place beside the more formally finished portrait of the \" Memories \" and the \" Little Tour in America \" — though the likeness there shown conveys no suggestion of stiilness or ceremony. The friendship between the Dean and his present editor appears to have grown out of a common love of nature and an interest in flori- culture ; this is to be inferred from three letters addressed to Mr. Dewar and included in the volume. The prefatory memoir is so good that one wishes it were longer. Making no attempt to give a biography of the man, it touches lightly and gracefully, with illustrative anecdotes, on the more prominent traits of the Dean's char- axjter. His unfailing quickness of wit is seen in the following incident : \" Once he called on Mr. George Allen at Sunnyside, Orpington, with some inquiry about Ruskin's work, * The Seven Lamps of Architecture,' which had lately been republished. As he left the hall, he struck smartly with his head a hanging lamp. The last thing that, as a rule, comes off a man's tongue in a case like this is a witty remark; but Hole instantly remarked with good humour, ' If I am not careful, there will only be Six Lamps left ! ' \" In choosing the letters for publication, the editor has shown wisdom in picking with a spar- ing hand and also in not including letters merely because they were written to persons of distinc- tion. Hole was on the friendliest terms with all sorts and conditions of men, and his informal •The Letters of Samuel Reynolds Hole, Dean of Rochester. Edited, with a Memoir, by George A. B. Dewar. niustrated. New York: The Macmillan Co. letters to old-time country cronies are more characteristic and entertaining than his decanal epistles to \" My dear Lord Bishop \" or other dignitary of church or state. The letters have little value as \"side-lights\" to history, and seldom refer to any absorbing social or political question of the hour ; they touch not on any controversies between the various sections of the church, high and low, broad and narrow ; they are not tinged with the slightest shade of odium theologicum, though their writer was well known to have the courage of his convictions ; and they do not afford the briefest peep behind the scenes in church politics or polemics. All this is plainly stated at the outset, and if the editor may occasionally be charged with going to the other extreme in serving up matter that savors of the tasteless and trivial, he at least gives us a good picture of his author's unfailing lightness of heart and frolicsomeness of mood up to the very year, if not day and hour, of his death, — a cheer- ing example of \" an old age serene and bright \" that never outgrew the appeal of things inno- cently amusing. Something of the perennial boyishness of genius was his. \" Quick, impid- sive, ready to kindle up, and as ready to forgive, with an imboimded relish for life and for its humours and sympathy with its light and shade — that was the boyishness of him, and it wielded its instrument in the quick-flashing wit which sometimes took form in anecdote, and sometimes flitted by in the turn of a phrase, or a lialf- noticed word.\" Thus was he described by a friend who knew him well. A letter to John Leech, written in 1859, soon after the appearance of \" A Little Tour in Ireland,\" which Hole wrote and Leech illus- trated, is among those in lighter vein. The two men were affectionate friends, and upon Leech's early death the other wrote a memoir of the lamented artist. The letter begins : \" I have received a cheque from Bradbury & Evans for £105, with an allusion to future favors. I have thanked them sincerely, but my chief thanks and theirs (as I told them) are due, of course, to you. For they know, and I know, and you know, and all the world knows, that ' A Little Tour in Ireland ' would in all probability have made a Little Ditto to the Trtmk- makers, had it not been illustrated by John Leech — Grod bless him. . , . And so, my friend, with the de- lightful document on ' Smith, Payne, & Smith ' before me, I see thro' the signature of ' Bradbury & Evans ' the name of John Leech, and to him I tender my most genuine gratitude.\" Hole's \" Book about Roses,\" which was pub- lished in 1869, must be familiar to rose-lovers. In the following extract from a letter to the Rev. C. C. Ellison — whom his correspondent 12 THE DIAL [Jan. 1, salutes variously as \" Dear Elli \" and \" My dear Charlie \" and \" Dear Old Charlie \" — the \" rosarian \" speaks : \" 1 am much pleased to hear of yom* good conduct, as one of my pupils, and of your obtaining a prize. Continue m the paths of virtue and industry, wheeling ft upon them large quantities of farm-yard manure to your rose-trees, and you must ultimately win the highest and most honourable of titles, the title of a good Rosarian. May the aphis of difficulty and the mildew of disap- pointment always disappear before the syringe of your assiduity and the sulphur of your perseverance.\" A story told by Dean Hole in Chicago, in the course of his American tour of a dozen years ago, will be recalled by the letter next quoted. Its subject is a dog with a taste for religious literature. The animal had invaded a young curate's study and devoured half his sermon, so that when the curate came to deliver it he found himself brought to a premature close, which he afterward apologized for to one of the churchwardens, whereupon the warden said : \" I should be much obliged if you could get our Rector one of the breed.\" To a brother clergyman asking what happened to the dog after his strange meal, the Dean, a great dog- lover, replies : \" You will be pleased to hear that when the dog had inwardly digested the sermon which he had torn, he turned over a new leaf. He had been sullen and morose, he became < a very jolly dog.' He had been selfish and exclusive in his manger, he generously gave it up to an aged poodle. He had been noisy and vulgar, he became a quiet, gentlemanly dog, he never growled again; and when he was bitten he always requested the cur who had torn his flesh to be so good, as a particular favour, to bite him again. He has established a Re- formatory in the Isle of Dogs, for perverse puppies, and an infirmary for Mangy Mastiffs in Houndsditch. He has won 26 medals from the Humane Society for res- cuing children who have fallen into the canal. He spends six days of the week in conducting his brothers and sisters, who have lost their ways, to the Dogs' Home, and it is a most touching sight to see him leading the blind to church from morning to night on Smidays.\" To his son Hugh, a young giant of six feet and five inches, who distinguished himself in various capacities during the recent war in South Africa, the clerical father writes in a tone of delightful comradeship. Here, for instance, is the opening of a letter of Oct. 6, 1897, which the editor leaves to explain itself : \" I am delighted, my dear Son, with your very inter- esting letter, and I congratulate you heartily on your magnificent right and left in the pursuit of friendships, Nansen and Ibsen, two of the most famous men of their day. All must admire Nansen's heroism, and Ibsen's intellectual power ; and it does one good to be with such men, though m some points, in which they are not experts or students, we may have no sympathies. I anticipate a great enjoyment in hearing, viva voce, more details of yonr singular and exciting intercourse. We shall be ' Arcades ambo, et cantam [misprint for cantare] et respondere parati,' when we meet, seeing that we have been in half-a-score houses within the last 3 months, and with all sorts and conditions of men.\" As a specimen of the Dean's more serious style — for he could be deeply serious and pro- foundly impressive when occasion demanded — let us quote a sentence from a letter wi-itten to the Bishop of Rochester three months before the writer's death. \" As the Sun and the Showers have clothed our Kent Orchards with garments of praise, and made the buds of our garments to grow, so your words of warm and refreshing sympathy, from the comfort wherewith you are comforted of God, make my faith glad with the blossoms of hope, and quicken my prayers for those fruits of the Spirit, and those flowers of Eden, which will be restored in the new heaven and the new earth, where dwelleth Righteousness.\" A friend, quoted in the \" Memoir,\" says of Dean Hole : \" It is difficult to convey just that impression of ' distinction ' or nobleness which was exactly what no one could help receiving from his presence. But it would have been difficidt — and disagreeable — to bring any- thing mean, or unchivalrous, or unworthy, into his presence.\" These words may be fitly sup- plemented by Hole's definition of a gentleman ; it gives at least a glimpse of the ideal after which he had modelled his own character. \" There is no such thing as a gentleman by birth. No public schools, no universities, no study of elegant literature, no intellectual attainments, no accomplish- ments, no titled playmates can confer the gift. The real elements, the truthfulness which cannot he, the uprightness which will not stoop, the courtesy which considers all, the honour which cannot be bribed, the command of the passions, the. mastery of the tem- per— these can only be learned from God.\" Some good pictures accompany the reading matter ; also an occasional pen-and-ink sketch by the Dean's own hand — so variously accom- plished was he. The frontispiece portrait of him and the view of the rosary at Caunton, with the vicar-gardener standing in its midst, are espe- cially pleasing. The only thing calling for a word of adverse criticism in the volume is the ungenial stiffness of its binding, which will far sooner break than bend its obstinate ba«k. Percy F. Bicknell. We noticed some weeks ago the posthumous collec- tion of the poems of George Henry Miles. Mention was made in that volume of \" A Review of Hamlet \" by the same author — a contribution to Shakespearian criticism that attracted much attention at the time when it was written, and that had a marked influence upon Edwin Booth in his interpretation of the Dane. The essay is now republished by Messrs. Longmans, Green, & Co., and proves to be a subtle and keenly intelligent analysis of the great tragedy. 1908.] THE DIAL 13 The Heart of Hamlet's Mystery.* Mr. Churton Collins has remarked that most attempts to pluck out the heart of Hamlet's mystery have thrown more light upon the char- acter of the interpreter than upon the subject. This no doubt explains the tendency of modem criticism to emphasize the subjective difficulties in the way of Hamlet's accomplishment of his task. We like to think of ourselves as dark- ened by a fine melancholy, or paralyzed by an austere intellectuality, or perplexed by a too exacting conscience. Like Coleridge, we are oppressed by the sense of our own impotence, and our criticism becomes an elegy of our thwarted purposes. Like Mr. Collins, we per- ceive in many of the finest types of modem civilization the taint of an immoral aestheticism, and our criticism becomes a warning against the immoderate worship of beauty. To this school of critics, the theory of Werder seems a paradox. The most psychological play of Shakespeare he interprets as a tragedy of circumstance. The most vacillating of heroes he declares to be the incarnation of steady purpose. The all but utter failure of Ham- let's mission he regards as a triumph of foresight. In the hero's tragic death he sees, not the result of thinking too precisely on the event, but the penalty of instinctive and ill-considered action. His theory was first expounded in a course of lectures at Berlin in 1859-60. Though it was conceived independently, it had been anticipated by J. L. Klein in 1846 and by George Fletcher in 1845. Dr. Fumess refers to it with approval in the Variorum Hamlet, and it has been accepted by Hudson and Rolfe. It is briefly this : Hamlet's problem is to avenge his father's murder, but so to avenge it as to make the justice of his act evident to all. The confession of Claudius, therefore, not his death, is the first necessity. To kill the King would be to kill the only proof of his crime. From this point of view the play becomes a struggle between Hamlet's instinctive and almost overmastering impulse to slay, and his deliberate conscientious self-restraint until he shall have forced the criminal to convict him- self. In the murder of Polonius, instinct tri- umphs over reason and conscience ; and hence arise all the evils of the latter part of the play — the madness of Ophelia, the death of the Queen, and the death of Hamlet himself. Nevertheless, •The Heart op Hamlet's Mystery. By Karl Werder. Translated from the German by Elizabeth Wilder. With In- troduction by W. J. Rolfe. New York : G. P. Putnam's Sons. the poisoned cup and rapiers, the King's conspiracy with Laertes, are a confession ; and though Hamlet's lips are sealed by death, Horatio lives to tell his story and to heal his wounded name. It is this struggle that gives significance to Hamlet's self-reproaches. After the interview with the players, he is thinking of the contrast, not between the actor's passion and his own inertness, but between his thirst for revenge and the necessity of inaction. In the most famous of the soliloquies, the point of his reflection is that conscience, which in his bitterness he calls cowardice, keeps him from suicide as from vengeance. And in the com- ment on Fortinbras' venture, he is thinking of the prince's freedom to act and his own enforced delay. It is all plausible enough ; but then, so mani- fold is the suggestiveness of the play that almost any theory can be made plausible. For the same reason, there is no theory against which strong objections cannot be urged. Our wisest course is to adopt the theory that on the whole best represents our own experience with Hamlet, without too close attention to the objections that can be produced against it. Against Professor Werder's theory, as a whole, we have nothing to say, except that it does not represent our experience with Hamlet. Against details of it, there are some objections that are perhaps not idle. Like most students of the play, he makes far too little of its history, of the traditional material that is imbedded in it ; far too little, also, of Shakespeare's care- less acceptance of such material, with little or no effort to motivate it. Reflections of this sort should temper our deliverances upon the assumed madness, and our efforts to acquit Hamlet of blame for the death of his two school- fellows. Marvellous as the motivation of this play is, a motivation that we can see in process of development, there is a limit to it fixed by the dramatist's fatigue or lack of time. Hence, in part, the mystery of the play. As usual, the commentator seems to us to have forced his own interpretation upon certain passages in defiance of the plain sense. Hardly anything in the earlier scenes is more striking than Hamlet's physical revulsion from his mother's marriage, which, to an audience with centuries of Catholicism in their blood, would have seemed very like incest. Yet Professor Werder never refers to this, and explains the horror of the first soliloquy as due to a pre- sentiment of the murder. It is not true that \" Hamlet breathes no word of complaint of hav- 14 THE DIAL [Jan. 1, ing suffered \" from Claudius' usurpation. No other interpretation is possible of \" A cutpurse of the empire and the rule, That from a shelf the precious diadem stole, And put it in his pocket \" (3.4.99-101) ; and \" Popp'd in between the election and my hopes\" (5.2.65.) The Ghost, says Professor Werder, \" does not blame Hamlet for his delay, as the critics have done \"; and he quotes, in confirmation of his statement, — \" Do not forg'et. This visitation Is but to whet thy almost blunted purpose \" (3.4.110, 111.) The series of questions on page 69 is typical of the attitude of many students toward Shake- speare's \"feigned histories.\" Why, Professor Werder asks, was the time out of joint ? Why were there no wise counsellors, no noble war- riors, at the court of Claudius ? Did the elder Hamlet outlive all the better element of his court ? and is this the reason why Claudius re- mained in undisputed possession of the throne ? Such questions are a tribute to the poet's power of creating an illusion, but they do not indicate a fruitful critical method. An interpretation of this kind, however plausible, seems to us to pluck out the heart of Hamlet's mystery indetid, to rob it of much of its stimulating and moving quality. If it is cor- rect, the play is less profound, less poignant, less modem than we have thought, and we have shed our tears in vain over the wreck of precious and splendid things that were not fitted to survive. Charles H. A. Wager. ENGiiASTD's American Provinces and HER Imperial. Control,.* The third volume of Professor Osgood's notable work, \" The American Colonies in the Seventeenth Century,\" rounds out, after an interval of three years, that part of the classi- fication of the Colonies which the writer omitted from consideration in his first instalment of two volumes. A word is needed, perhaps, to remind one of this classification, in order that the purpose of the work may be fully understood. Instead of treating the Colonies from a purely chronological standpoint, or, on the other hand, taking up successively each Colony or group of Colonies in geographical order, ProiEessor Osgood has developed in earlier monographs and now in this extensive treatise the idea that the true * The American Colonies in the Seventeenth Century. By Herbert L. Osgood, Ph.D. Volume III., Imperial Control ; Beginnings of the System of Royal Provinces. New York: The Macmillan Co. method of approach is to classify the Colonies according to their internal governmental struc- ture, and then to trace the development of each of the groups thus set apart. Following out this plan, Professor Osgood substitutes for the old simple division into Royal, Charter, and Pro- prietary Colonies, a more complex analysis into Corporate Colonies and Provinces, then divid- ing the latter class into Royal and Proprietary Provinces. In his earlier papers he showed the sharp distinction that must be observed between the structure of the Corporate Colony — exem- plified in Connecticut, Rhode Island, and Mas- sachusetts before 1684 — and the Provinces ; and he furthermore maintained the essential oneness in principle of the Proprietary Province — whether the proprietor were an individual, a group of individuals, or a company — and the Royal Province. But parallel with the classification into Corporations and Provinces is another, which divides the Colonies into those which enjoyed the advantages of charters and those which did not : for Corporations and Proprietary Pro- vinces alike had charters, while Royal Provinces, except Massachusetts after 1691, had none. These two canons of division influence one another ; and in the two volumes first issued it was the Chartered Colonies, Corporations, and Proprietary Provinces that were compared. The field left to this third volume is consequently the Royal Province ; and thus Virginia after 1624, the dissolution of the Massachusetts Bay Company, the beginnings of royal government in New Hampshire and New York, the admin- istration of Governor Andros in the Eastern Provinces, together with the revolutionary move- ments which in 1689 appeared in New York, in Massachusetts, and in Maryland, — these parts of Colonial history are developed with the same clearness and wealth of details that char- acterized the earlier portion of the work. The institutional life of the Royal Province is not treated under such separate heads as the Land System, the Official System, the Financial System, Ecclesiastical Relations, etc., as were used in t"
