        "text": "By Damiano Beltrami\n\nIf you want to join the ranks of professionisti – professional journalists in Italy – you can work for 18 months as a so-called praticante, an apprentice in the newsroom of a newspaper (one whose editor-in-chief is a professional journalist). But it usually takes family connections to get that gig. About 90 percent of aspiring journalists take the other route – attending one of 17 certified journalism schools for 18 months, roughly six of which are for internships.\n\nThat’s not easy either. You have to pass an admissions test to get in. Once you do, tuitions range from 5,000 to 20,000 Euros or so – a lot of money for Italy, especially since few substantial scholarships are available.\n\nAfter you’ve completed the 18 months of preparation, you take an exam in Rome organized by the Ordine dei Giornalisti (ODG). The exam is made up of two parts: a written test and an oral test. You take the written test in a hangar-like building on the outskirts of Rome. When I took it in January 2007, 800 fellow applicants showed up. We used old typewriters because the ODG didn’t want to buy, say, 50 computers and have 16 exam sessions. (In 2008 they finally switched to computers.)\n\nThe written test has three parts. You have to write an op-ed piece choosing from a range of topics – politics, business, national news, culture, science, technology, sports or entertainment. You have to sum up a long report in 30 lines, each line with 60 characters including spaces. Finally you have to answer six questions about legal and ethical issues, the history of Italian journalism and Italian journalistic jargon. You have eight hours to do all this.\n\nIf you pass the written test, you have to take an oral exam in which you’re asked more legal and ethical questions connected to recent news stories. You prepare by studying a few recommended books, but the questions can be totally random, ranging from how the Italian parliamentary system works to the name of Giuseppe Garibaldi’s favorite lover. The latter question was actually posed to a guy who took the oral test in my session. Unfortunately, he failed.\n\nA lot of writers for Italian publications are not professionisti, but pubblicisti – contributors who are not fulltime journalists. These may be columnists or other occasional writers. For example, a professor of political science at the Università La Sapienza in Rome might write editorials for Corriere della Sera, a leading Italian daily. In order to become a pubblicista, you have to demonstrate that you have written for a newspaper, magazine or an officially recognized online publication for at least two years, that you produced at least 60 articles and you were paid for your work (although the rules do not specify how much).\n\nEverybody recognizes that this system is outmoded. The Ordine dei Giornalisti was founded in 1963, succeeding the Albo Professionale, an association of journalists set up in 1925, during the fascist era. Today, the ODG would argue that Italy still needs it to weed out unethical reporters or journalists who don’t understand the rules of privacy or other professional issues. Of course, that fails to acknowledge that Italy has plenty of ethically challenged reporters even with the old licensing system in place.\n\nWhat if a young journalist simply refuses to jump through these hoops? Such a renegade could never be hired to work for a national newspaper. In theory you could start up your own online news site. I though about doing this myself with a team of two or three other excited and tech-savvy lads. But there are a few problems.\n\nMost important, you’re not allowed to link to original content. If you start generating something like 100,000 visitors a day, major newspapers can sue you. Italian newspapers are not like the “Santa Claus New York Times,” which lets anyone link to its site. If you came up with something like the Huffington Post in Italy, the main newspapers and trade unions would do everything they could to stop you.\n\nIn any case, the number of Italians who use the Internet, including social networks like Facebook and Twitter, is still low compared to the online population in the United States. Bloggers are around, but only one is really successful – Beppe Grillo, a comedian.\n\nIn a way, Italy’s outmoded licensing system somehow fits the character of the people. As Luigi Barzini Jr., an Italian journalist who lived most of his life in the United States, wrote in his 1964 book “The Italians: A Full Length Portrait”: “The Baroque is the mood in which most Italians live.” When you can draw a straight line from A to B, we prefer to draw a curve.\n\nDamiano Beltrami writes for the Huffington Post, the leading Italian business newspaper Il Sole-24Ore, and the magazine IL. He lives in New York City."
