        "text": "One of Hollywood's finest character / \"Method\" actors, Eli Wallach was in demand for over 60 years (first film/TV role was 1949) on stage and screen, and has worked alongside the world's biggest stars, including Clark Gable, Clint Eastwood, Steve McQueen, Marilyn Monroe, Yul Brynner, Peter O'Toole, and Al Pacino, to name but a few.\n\nWallach was born on 7 December 1915 in Brooklyn, NY, to Jewish parents who emigrated from Poland, and was one of the few Jewish kids in his mostly Italian neighborhood. His parents, Bertha (Schorr) and Abraham Wallach, owned a candy store, Bertha's Candy Store. He went on to graduate with a B.A. from the University of Texas in Austin, but gained his dramatic training with the Actors Studio and the Neighborhood Playhouse. He made his debut on Broadway in 1945, and won a Tony Award in 1951 for portraying Alvaro Mangiacavallo in the Tennessee Williams play \"The Rose Tattoo\".\n\nWallach made a strong screen debut in 1956 in the film version of the Tennessee Williams play Baby Doll - Begehre nicht des anderen Weib (1956), shined as \"Dancer\", the nattily dressed hitman, in director Don Siegel's film-noir classic Der Henker ist unterwegs (1958), and co-starred in the heist film Sieben Diebe (1960). Director John Sturges then cast Wallach as vicious Mexican bandit Calvera in Die glorreichen Sieben (1960), the western adaptation of the Akira Kurosawa epic Die sieben Samurai (1954). Misfits - Nicht gesellschaftsfähig (1961), in the star-spangled western opus Das war der wilde Westen (1962), the underrated WW2 film Die Sieger (1963), as a kidnapper in Der Millionenraub (1964), in the sea epic Lord Jim (1965) and in the romantic comedy Wie klaut man eine Million? (1966).\n\nLooking for a third lead actor in the final episode of the \"Dollars Trilogy\", Italian director Sergio Leone cast the versatile Wallach as the lying, two-faced, money-hungry (but somehow lovable) bandit \"Tuco\" in the spectacular Zwei glorreiche Halunken (1966) (aka \"The Good, The Bad and The Ugly\"), arguably his most memorable performance. Wallach kept busy throughout the remainder of the '60s and into the '70s with good roles in Mackenna's Gold (1969), Zapfenstreich (1973), Testament in Blei (1974), Die Tiefe (1977) and as Steve McQueen's bail buddy in Jeder Kopf hat seinen Preis (1980).\n\nThe 1980s was an interesting period for Wallach, as he was regularly cast as an aging doctor, a Mafia figure or an over-the-hill hitman, such as in The Executioner's Song (1982), Verfeindet bis aufs Blut (1985), Archie und Harry - Sie können's nicht lassen (1986), Nuts ... Durchgedreht (1987), Die Spur führt zurück (1990) and as the candy-addicted \"Don Altabello\" in Der Pate 3 (1990). At 75+ years of age, Wallach's quality of work was still first class and into the 1990s and beyond, he has remained in demand. He lent fine support to Vendetta: Secrets of a Mafia Bride (1990), Teamster Boss: The Jackie Presser Story (1992), Naked City: Justice with a Bullet (1998) and Glauben ist alles! (2000). Most recently Wallach showed up as a fast-talking liquor store owner in Mystic River (2003) and in the comedic drama King of the Corner (2004).\n\nIn early 2005, Eli Wallach released his much anticipated autobiography, \"The Good, The Bad And Me: In My Anecdotage\", an enjoyable reading from one of the screen's most inventive and enduring actors.\n\nEli Wallach was very much a family man who remained married to his wife Anne Jackson for 66 years. When Wallach died at 98, in 2014, in Manhattan, NY, he was survived by his wife, three children, five grandchildren and several great-grandchildren.\n\nHandsome bodybuilder Steve Reeves certainly had an enviable Herculean physique, and made plenty good use of it in Europe during the late 1950s and early 1960s portraying some of filmdom's most famous bronzed gods. Reeves was originally a Montana boy born on a cattle ranch in 1926. His destiny was revealed early in the game when, at the age of six months, he won his first fitness title as \"Healthiest Baby of Valley County.\" His father Lester died in a farming accident when Steve was just a boy, and his family moved to Oakland (California). He first developed an interest in bodybuilding while in high school.\n\nSteve joined the Army in his late teens where his job was loading boxcars and trucks. He also worked out loyally at the gym during his free time and the combination helped develop his body quite rapidly. Following Army service (he served for a time in the Pacific), he decided to pursue bodybuilding professionally. In 1946, at the age of 20, he won \"Mr. Pacific Coast\" in Oregon, which led to his titles of \"Mr. Western America\" (1947), Mr. America\" (1947), \"Mr. World\" (1948) and, ultimately, \"Mr. Universe\" (1950).\n\nWith all the body-worshiping publicity he garnered, he decided to travel to New York to study and pursue acting. He subsequently returned to California...and Hollywood. There were not huge opportunities for a muscleman in Tinseltown other than providing pectoral background. Steve was, however, considered for the lead role in Cecil B. DeMille's biblical costumer Samson und Delilah (1949), but refused when told by the legendary director he would have to lose some of his musculature (about 15 lbs.). The part instead went to Victor Mature. Steve did manage to snag the role of a detective in infamous director Edward D. Wood Jr.'s Jail Bait (1954). Small parts on TV also came his way, but they too were mostly posing bits or walk-ons. To the Hollywood power players, Steve was just a body. Whether he could act or not was not a concern or selling point. Fans just wanted to see him take his shirt off.\n\nDown on his luck, Steve's fortunes change when Italian film director Pietro Francisci saw him play Jane Powell's boyfriend in the feature film Athena (1954) and persuaded him to go overseas to star in Die unglaublichen Abenteuer des Herkules (1958) (US title: \"Hercules\"). Though critics dismissed the film as \"muddled mythology\" while denigrating its cheapjack production values (including a poorly-dubbed sound track), the public went crazy over the sword-and-sandal epic and, in particular, Steve's marvelous beefcake heroics. He became an \"overnight\" star. Sequels followed, none any better or worse, with him going through the paces as a number absurdly-muscled biblical and mythological figures. An able horseman, he also performed many of his own stunts. Moreover, he paved the way for other pumped-up acting hopefuls (Ed Fury, Mark Forest, Reg Park) to seek their fame and fortune in Italy as a feature-length Samson, Ursus or Colossus. Nobody, however, came close to topping Steve in popularity.\n\nA shoulder injury forced Steve's retirement, spending the remainder of his life promoting steroid-free bodybuilding while living on a ranch and breeding horses. The more recent bodybuilders of fame such as Arnold Schwarzenegger and Lou Ferrigno, both Hercules impersonators of yore, have given Steve significant credit for their respective acting successes. Married twice, Steve died in Southern California of lymphoma on May 1, 2000, at age 74.\n\nHandsome American leading man Guy Madison stumbled into a film career and became a television star and hero to the Baby Boom generation. As a young man he worked as a telephone lineman, but entered the Coast Guard at the beginning of the Second World War. While on liberty one weekend in Hollywood, he attended a Lux Radio Theatre broadcast and was spotted in the audience by an assistant to Henry Willson, an executive for David O. Selznick. Selznick wanted an unknown sailor to play a small but prominent part in Als du Abschied nahmst (1944), and promptly signed Robert Moseley to a contract. Selznick and Willson concocted the screen name Guy Madison (the \"guy\" girls would like to meet, and Madison from a passing Dolly Madison cake wagon). Madison filmed his one scene on a weekend pass and returned to duty. The film's release brought thousands of fan letters for Madison's lonely, strikingly handsome young sailor, and at war's end he returned to find himself a star-in-the-making. Despite an initial amateurishness to his acting, Madison grew as a performer, studying and working in theatre. He played leads in a series of programmers before being cast as legendary lawman Wild Bill Hickok in the TV series Adventures of Wild Bill Hickok (1951). He played Hickok on TV and radio for much of the 1950s, and many of the TV episodes were strung together and released as feature films. Madison managed to squeeze in some more adult-oriented roles during his off-time from the series, but much of this work was also in westerns. After the Hickok series ended Madison found work scarce in the U.S. and traveled to Europe, where he became a popular star of Italian westerns and German adventure films. In the 1970s he returned to the U.S., but appeared mainly in cameo roles. Physical ailments limited his work in later years, and he died from emphysema in 1996. His first wife was actress Gail Russell.\n\nDean Reed was born September 22, 1938, in Denver Colorado. He went to Hollywood where he signed a record contract with Capitol Records in 1958, but his third single, \"Our Summer Romance\" was so popular in South America he went to tour there. More popular than Elvis Presley, he stayed to enjoy his incredible fame in Chile, Peru, Argentina. He made albums, starred in movies and had his own television show in Buenos Aires. He was known as Mr. Simpatia because he worked free in barrios and prisons and protested US policy, nuclear bomb tests etc. His politics moved to the left but he never joined the Communist party. He was deported from Argentina in 1966 and ended up in Rome, where he made \"spaghetti westerns\" for several years. He made his first concert tour of the Soviet Union in 1966 and became a mega star there and in Eastern Europe. He continually got into trouble with US State Department for protesting Vietnam War and attending International Peace Conferences. He moved to East Germany (GDR) in 1973, made numerous albums, starred in several films, and wrote and directed his own.\n\nHis last visit to the States in late 1985 encouraged him to dream of making a career for himself back home, especially if he could return with his current project in hand, a movie about the war between AIM and the FBI at Wounded Knee, 1973. A GDR/Soviet Union co-production, the film had taken years to get off the ground. Just days before shooting was due to start in the Crimea, Dean Reed's body was found in the lake near his home outside of East Berlin. He had been missing for several days. Many close to him in the GDR suspected suicide; his family and friends in America believed he was murdered.\n\nEdd Byrnes was born Edward Byrne Breitenberger on July 30, 1932 in New York City, the son of Mary (Byrne) and Augustus \"Gus\" Breitenberger. Edd shared an impoverished and unhappy childhood with brother Vincent and sister Jo-Ann. Their mother worked hard at various jobs to keep the family together because her alcoholic husband was often absent from the scene.\n\nWhen Edd was fifteen, his father was found dead in a basement. Edd then dropped his surname (Breitenberger) in favor of \"Byrnes\", based on the name of his maternal grandfather, Edward Byrne, a New York City fireman. He found escape from family problems at the movies and at the gym, where he developed an athletic body. At age 17 he was approached by a man who offered to take free \"physique\" photos of him. According to his 1996 autobiography, \"Kookie No More\", this led to a few years of \"hustling\" older, well-to-do men, despite the fact that Edd was heterosexual. One of these men acted as Edd's mentor, introducing him to fashion and culture and encouraging his hopes for an acting career.\n\nAfter doing some summer-stock work and a few bit parts on TV, Edd drove to California in 1955, arriving in Los Angeles on the day James Dean died in a car crash. He managed to get a few minor parts in films and then won a role in a new TV series, 77-Sunset-Strip (1958), which premiered in September 1958. Efrem Zimbalist Jr. and Roger Smith starred as private eyes but Edd, playing a hip-talking parking-lot attendant named \"Kookie\", won the most attention. Viewers quoted his dialog, (\"Baby, you're the ginchiest!\"), and young males imitated the way he wielded his ever-present comb. His fan mail soon reached an astonishing 15,000 letters a week and his single with Connie Stevens, \"Kookie, Kookie, Lend Me Your Comb\", became a top-5 hit. Edd chafed, however, at the restrictions in his Warner Brothers contract, which forced him to turn down roles in Frankie und seine Spießgesellen (1960), Land der 1000 Abenteuer (1960) and Rio Bravo (1959).\n\nHe walked off the \"77 Sunset Strip\" set and in the ensuing months began to drink heavily and visit a psychiatrist, who administered drugs to him. His contract dispute was eventually settled, though not much to his advantage, and when he returned to \"77 Sunset Strip\" his role was upgraded from \"sidekick\" to \"partner\" and he wore a suit and tie. Audience reaction was not good, ratings dropped, and the show was canceled. The hip-talking, hair-combing image clung to him, however, and Edd felt he lost the lead in Patrouillenboot PT 109 (1963) because President John F. Kennedy didn't want to be played by \"Kookie\". A few more movies and TV appearances followed, but his career had passed its peak before he turned 30.\n\nIn 1962, he married long-time girlfriend Asa Maynor. Their son, Logan, was born on September 13, 1965. Edd and Asa's marriage ended in divorce in 1971, partially due to his substance abuse. In 1982, he succeeded in going \"clean and sober\" but never remarried. Byrnes died on January 8, 2020, aged 87, in Santa Monica, California.\n\nInternationally-known actor Brett Halsey, one of Hollywood's busiest and handsomest actors of the mid-to-late '50s and early '60s, was born Charles Oliver Hand to a builder/contractor in Santa Ana, California on June 20, 1933. Interested in performing from childhood (he appeared in local community and church plays), the young man found a modest \"in\" when he was hired as a teenage page at CBS Television studios. A chance meeting with the legendary Jack Benny and wife Mary Livingstone who taped \"The Jack Benny Show\" at CBS led to his being accepted to study at Universal-International's training school that also included at the time future Universal stars Clint Eastwood and David Janssen. These intense studies eventually led to a contract offered by the studio.\n\nBefore deciding to pursue acting full time, the young teenager joined the Navy and enjoyed a brief stint as a deejay. Once signed with Universal, the studio decided to take advantage of Brett's esteemed ancestry (as the nephew of famed WWII Admiral William \"Bull\" Halsey) and changed the young nascent actor's stage name to the more marquee-friendly \"Brett Halsey.\" He gained extensive experience apprenticing in a string of Universal bit parts, glimpsed in such standard filming as Walking My Baby Back Home (1953), Der Mann vom Alamo (1953), Der eiserne Ritter von Falworth (1954), Ma and Pa Kettle at Home (1954) (as one of the young Kettle brood), Die Rache des Ungeheuers (1955) (as a victim) and _The Girl He Left Behind (1956). Eventually Brett's camera-worthy dark-haired good looks, penetrating blue eyes and earnest 'matinee idol' demeanor found their way front-and-center on TV drama (\"Brave Eagle,\" \"Mackenzie's Raiders,\" \"Gunsmoke,\" \"Perry Mason,\" \"Highway Patrol,\" Harbor Command\" and \"Sea Hunt\").\n\nIn the late 1950s, Brett increased his cinematic visibility with the growing interest of low budget \"juvenile delinquent\" films. Several of Brett's features, such as _Hot Rod Rumble (1957) with 'Leigh Snowden', Roger Corman's cult classic The Cry Baby Killer (1958) with Jack Nicholson, High School Hellcats (1958) and _Speed Crazy (1959), the last two co-starring Yvonne Lime, have since attained camp and/or cult status. He ended that series of filming with The Girl in Lovers Lane (1960) with Joyce Meadows.\n\nKeeping in step with the then-popular trend of showcasing cool, hunky \"beefcake\" talent in TV adventure series with interesting or exotic locales, such as when Edd Byrnes combed his way to teen idol status on \"77 Sunset Strip,\" Van Williams and Troy Donahue checked into \"Surfside Six\" and Robert Conrad spruced up \"Hawaiian Eye,\" Brett fell into a co-starring role with Barry Coe, Gary Lockwood and former child star Gigi Perreau in the one-season adventure series Unter heißem Himmel (1961), as a free-lance magazine writer looking for action in Honolulu. For his work, he earned a Golden Globe Award for \"New Star of the Year\".\n\nFollowing co-star/featured work in the war films Zur Hölle und zurück (1955), The Last Blitzkrieg (1958)_ and Jet Over the Atlantic (1959), the sci-fi thrillers Die Rückkehr der Fliege (1959) (with Vincent Price) and Auf U-17 ist die Hölle los (1959), the large-scale ensemble sudsers Alle meine Träume (1959) and Return to Peyton Place (1961)_, the crime drama Begierde im Staub (1960) and the horror opus Das Gift des Bösen (1963), the 28-year-old Brett decided to follow a number of other young vital and promising American actors who wished to take advantage of career opportunities opening up overseas in Italy. What was originally a one-time acting job in Italy led to a decade-long stay in films. Often billed as \"Montgomery Ford,\" Brett starred as several sword-and-sandal type heroes in including the spectacles Die sieben Schwerter der Rache (1962) [The Seventh Sword], Mit Faust und Degen (1963) [The Magnificent Adventurer] and Der Rächer von Venedig (1964) [The Avenger of Venice]. He also settled comfortably into the fashionable international spy, \"spaghetti\" western and giallo genres with a slew of work including Das verräterische Auge (1965) [Spy in Your Eye], Agentenfalle Lissabon (1965) [Espionage in Lisbon], L'heure de la vérité (1965) [The Hour of Truth], Uccidete Johnny Ringo (1966) [Johnny Ringo], Der Kongreß amüsiert sich (1966) [Congress of Love], 3 notti violente (1966) [Web of Violence], Bang Bang (1967), Heute ich... morgen du! (1968) [Today We Kill...Tomorrow We Die], Tutto sul rosso (1968) [All on the Red], Lonesome - Der Zorn Gottes (1968) [Wrath of God], Kidnapping! Paga o uccidiamo tuo figlio (1969) [Twenty Thousand Dollars for Seven], 3 Halunken und ein Halleluja (1970) and Vier Mal heute Nacht (1971) [Four Times That Night].\n\nIn the early 1970s, Brett returned to the United States and planted himself squarely into TV work again, particularly in daytime drama. He appeared with regularity on General Hospital (1963), Henderson (1951), Love Is a Many Splendored Thing (1967), and, his last, a two-year stint (1980-82) on Schatten der Leidenschaft (1973). Halsey continued sporadically in films as well, such as the comedy Wo tut's weh? (1972) starring Peter Sellers, Ratboy (1986), Der Pate 3 (1990) and Beyond Justice (1991), while also finding steady work on the small screen - \"Alias Smith and Jones,\" \"Toma,\" \"The Love Boat,\" \"The Bionic Woman,\" \"Charlie's Angels,\" \"Fantasy Island,\" \"The Dukes of Hazzard,\" \"Buck Rogers in the 25th Century,\" \"Columbo,\" \"Matt Houston\" and \"Cagney & Lacey\".\n\nAt age 80+, the stalwart character actor continues to be seen from time to time with recent roles in the films Hierarchy (2009), The Scarlet Worm (2011), Club Utopia (2013) (in which he held a leading role), and Risk Factor (2015). Also known at one time as a film acting teacher, Halsey also writes novels (\"The Magnificent Strangers\") and screenplays while making occasional guest appearances at film festivals. One biography: \"Brett Halsey: Art or Instinct in the Movies,\" which chronicles the actor's prolific career, was published in 2008. At various times, he has lived out of the country in Costa Rica, Canada and Italy.\n\nBrett is the father of five children. In 1954, he married imported Universal starlet Renate Hoy, an actress who won the \"Miss Germany\" beauty contest that same year. Together they had two children, the late Charles Oliver Hand, Jr. (a.k.a. punk rock performer \"Rock Halsey\" and/or \"Rock Bottom\") and Tracy Leigh. The couple divorced five years later. His second marriage (1960-1962) to exotic James Bond (\"Thunderball\") vixen Luciana Paluzzi, an Italian beauty, produced son Christian, who is a producer (\"American Psycho\"). Halsey and Paluzzi co-starred in Rückkehr nach Peyton Place (1961) during their brief union. A third union (1964-1976) to German actress Heidi Brühl, best known here for her US role in the 1975 Clint Eastwood film \"The Eiger Sanction,\" produced two more children: Clayton, a TV video editor (\"Big Brother\"), and Nicole. Halsey is presently wed to Victoria Korda, granddaughter of British filmmaker Alexander Korda.\n\nJack Palance quite often exemplified evil incarnate on film, portraying some of the most intensely feral villains witnessed in 1950s westerns and melodrama. Enhanced by his tall, powerful build, icy voice, and piercing eyes, he earned two \"Best Supporting Actor\" nominations early in his career. It would take a grizzled, eccentric comic performance 40 years later, however, for him to finally grab the coveted statuette.\n\nOf Ukrainian descent, Palance was born Volodymyr Ivanovich Palahniuk (later taking Walter Jack Palance as his legal name) on February 18, 1919 (although some sources, including his death certificate, cite 1920) in Lattimer Mines, Pennsylvania (coal country), one of six children born to Anna (nee Gramiak) and Ivan Palahniuk. His father, an anthracite miner, died of black lung disease. Palance worked in the mines in his early years but averted the same fate as his father. Athletics was his ticket out of the mines when he won a football scholarship to the University of North Carolina. He subsequently dropped out to try his hand at professional boxing. Fighting under the name \"Jack Brazzo\", he won his first 15 fights, 12 by knockout, before losing a 4th round decision to future heavyweight contender Joe Baksi on December 17, 1940.\n\nWith the outbreak of World War II, his boxing career ended and his military career began, serving in the Army Air Force as a bomber pilot. Wounded in combat and suffering severe injuries and burns, he received the Purple Heart, Good Conduct Medal, and the World War II Victory Medal. He resumed college studies as a journalist at Stanford University and became a sportswriter for the San Francisco Chronicle. He also worked for a radio station until he was bit by the acting bug.\n\nPalance made his stage debut in \"The Big Two\" in 1947 and immediately followed it understudying Marlon Brando as Stanley Kowalski in the groundbreaking Broadway classic \"A Streetcar Named Desire\", a role he eventually took over. Following stage parts in \"Temporary Island\" (1948), \"The Vigil\" (1948), and \"The Silver Tassle\" (1949), Palance won a choice role in \"Darkness of Noon\" and a Theatre World Award for \"Promising New Personality.\" This recognition helped him secure a 20th Century-Fox contract. The facial burns and resulting reconstructive surgery following the crash and burn of his WWII bomber plane actually worked to his advantage. Out of contention as a glossy romantic leading man, Palance instead became the archetypal intimidating villain equipped with towering stance, imposing glare, and killer-shark smile.\n\nHe stood out among a powerhouse cast that included actors such as Richard Widmark, Zero Mostel and Paul Douglas in his movie debut in Elia Kazan's Unter Geheimbefehl (1950), as a plague-carrying fugitive. He was soon on his way. Briefly billed as Walter Jack Palance before eliminating the first name, the actor made fine use of his former boxing skills and war experience for the film Okinawa (1951) as a boxing Marine in Richard Widmark's platoon. He followed this with the first of his back-to-back Oscar nods. In Maskierte Herzen (1952), only his third film, he played rich-and-famous playwright Joan Crawford's struggling actor/husband who plots to murder her and run off with gorgeous Gloria Grahame. Finding just the right degree of intensity and menace to pretty much steal the proceedings without chewing the scenery, he followed this with arguably his finest villain of the decade, that of sadistic gunslinger Jack Wilson who takes on Alan Ladd's titular hero, played by Mein großer Freund Shane (1953), in a classic showdown.\n\nThroughout the 1950s, Palance doled out strong leads and supports such as those in Der unheimliche Untermieter (1953) (his first lead), Hollywood-Story (1955) and the war classic Ardennen 1944 (1956). Mixed in were a few routine to highly mediocre parts in Flug nach Tanger (1953), Attila, der Hunnenkönig (1954) (as Attila the Hun), and the biblical bomb Basilus - Held von Rom (1954). In between filmmaking were a host of television roles, none better than his down-and-out boxer in Requiem for a Heavyweight (1956), a rare sympathetic role that earned him an Emmy Award.\n\nBack and forth overseas in the 1960s and 1970s, Palance would dominate foreign pictures in a number of different genres -- sandal-and-spear spectacles, biblical epics, war stories and \"spaghetti westerns.\" Such films included Austerlitz - Glanz einer Kaiserkrone (1960), Die Mongolen (1961), Barabbas (1961), Il criminale (1962), Die Verachtung (1963), Mercenario: Der Gefürchtete (1968), Marquis de Sade: Justine (1969), The Desperados (1969), Halleluja... Amigo (1972), Chatos Land (1972), Blut eines Bullen (1976), Willkommen in dieser blutigen Stadt (1977). Back home, he played Fidel Castro in Che! (1969) while also appearing in Monte Walsh (1970), Oklahoma, wie es ist (1973) and Das gnadenlose Spiel (1975).\n\nOn the made-for-television front, Jack played a number of nefarious nasties to perfection, ranging from Mr. Hyde (Die seltsame Geschichte von Dr. Jekyll und Mr. Hyde (1968)) to Dracula in Dracula (1974) to Ebenezer Scrooge in a \"Wild West\" version of the Dickens classic Weihnachten im wilden Westen (1998). He also played one of the Hatfields in The Hatfields and the McCoys (1975). Jack switched gears to star as a \"nice guy\" lieutenant in the single-season TV cop drama Bronk (1975). In later years, the actor mellowed with age, as exemplified by roles in Out of Rosenheim (1987), but could still display his bad side as he did as an evil rancher, crime boss or drug lord in, respectively, Young Guns - Sie fürchten weder Tod noch Teufel (1988), Batman (1989) and Tango und Cash (1989). Into his twilight years he showed a penchant for brash, quirky comedy capped by his Oscar-winning role in City Slickers - Die Großstadt-Helden (1991) and its sequel. He ended his film career playing Long John Silver in Die Schatzinsel (1999).\n\nHis three children by his first wife, actress Virginia Baker -- Holly Palance, Brooke Palance, and Cody Palance -- all pursued acting careers and appeared with their father at one time or another. A man of few words off the set, he owned his own cattle ranch and displayed other creative sides as a exhibited painter and published poet.\n\nHis last years were marred by both failing health and the 1998 death of his son Cody from melanoma. He was later diagnosed with pancreatic cancer and died at the Santa Barbara County home of his daughter, Holly Palance, in 2006.\n\nFarley Earle Granger was born in 1925 in San Jose, California, to Eva (Hopkins) and Farley Earle Granger, who owned an automobile dealership. Right out of high school, he was brought to the attention of movie producer Samuel Goldwyn, who cast him in a small role in The North Star (1943). He followed it up with a much bigger part in The Purple Heart (1944) and then joined the army. After his release he had to wait until Nicholas Ray cast him in the low-budget RKO classic Sie leben bei Nacht (1948) with Cathy O'Donnell, and then he was recalled by Goldwyn, who signed him to a five-year contract. He then made Cocktail für eine Leiche (1948) for Alfred Hitchcock and followed up for Goldwyn with Betrogene Jugend (1948) with David Niven, Evelyn Keyes and Teresa Wright. Other roles followed, including Roseanna McCoy (1949) with Joan Evans, Unser eigenes Ich (1950) with Ann Blyth and Side Street (1949), again with Cathy O'Donnell. He returned to Hitchcock for the best role of his career, as the socialite tennis champ embroiled in a murder plot by psychotic Robert Walker in Der Fremde im Zug (1951). He then appeared in Fünf Perlen (1952) with Jeanne Crain, Hans Christian Andersen und die Tänzerin (1952) with Danny Kaye, War es die große Liebe? (1953) with Leslie Caron and Small Town Girl (1953) with Jane Powell. He went to Italy to make Sehnsucht (1954) for Luchino Visconti with Alida Valli, one of his best films. He did a Broadway play in 1955, \"The Carefree Tree\", and then returned to films in Nackte Straßen (1955) with Anthony Quinn and Anne Bancroft and Das Mädchen auf der Samtschaukel (1955) with Joan Collins and Ray Milland. Over the next ten years Granger worked extensively on television and the stage, mainly in stock, and returned to films in Rogue's Gallery (1968) with Dennis Morgan. He then returned to Italy, where he made a series of films, including Herausforderung zum Grand-Prix (1970) with 'Anne Baxter (I)', Der Mann aus El Paso (1973) with Richard Crenna and Arnold (1973) with Stella Stevens. More recent films include Forke des Todes (1981), Death Mask (1984), The Image-Maker (1986) and The Next Big Thing (2001). Since the 1950s he has continued to work frequently on American television and, in 1980, returned to Broadway and appeared in Ira Levin's successful play \"Deathtrap\". In 2007 he published his autobiography, \"Include Me Out: My Life from Goldwyn to Broadway\" with Robert Calhoun. A longtime resident of New York, Granger has recently appeared in several documentaries discussing Hollywood and, often, specifically Alfred Hitchcock."
