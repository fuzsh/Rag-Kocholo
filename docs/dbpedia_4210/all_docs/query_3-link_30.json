        "text": "The Eastern Front: A History of the First World War\n\nby Nick Lloyd\n\nThe Eastern Front is the second book in British military historian Nick Lloyd's trilogy about the First World War (the first book was about the Western Front). The book is around 500 pages long but it's highly readable. In it, Lloyd looks at the 'greater' Eastern front: from Riga in the Baltic down to Thessaloniki in the Aegean. This is a less well-known story to English readers than the battlefields of France and Belgium, and the focus on the war from the point of view of the Austro-Hungarian and Russian empires makes for very interesting reading. Russia lost more than 2.3 million soldiers in the war; the Austro-Hungarians over 1.1 million, only to collapse in 1918—with, as Lloyd writes in the preface, \"the disintegration of both empires creating a human catastrophe of almost unimaginable proportions.\"\n\nNote: if you're interested in reading about the Eastern Front in English, see also books by Alexander Watson, such as The Fortress.\n\nRead expert recommendations\n\n1177 BC: A Graphic History of the Year Civilization Collapsed\n\nby Eric Cline & Glynnis Fawkes (illustrator)\n\n1177 BC: A Graphic History of the Year Civilization Collapsed is a graphic adaptation of a 2014 book by American historian and archaeologist Eric Cline. It's a very lively and highly enjoyable way to find out what was happening and what life was like in the Aegean and Eastern Mediterranean in the Late Bronze Age. It covers the 15th to the 12th centuries BC and shows us both what we know about it, and how we know it (Egyptian steles play a big part). Also out in April, 2024, is After 1177BC, a follow-up book subtitled The Survival of Civilizations, about what happened after the Bronze Age collapse chronicled in 1177BC.\n\nRead expert recommendations\n\nAn African History of Africa: From the Dawn of Humanity to Independence\n\nby Zeinab Badawi\n\nAn African History of Africa is by Zeinab Badawi, a well-known British journalist who is now the president of SOAS, part of the University of London. The book follows on from a TV series, and Badawi visited some 34 countries as part of her research. The aim was to tell local history from the point of view of African historians, thinkers, and storytellers. Badawi herself was born in Sudan and grew up speaking Arabic at home, but moved to the UK aged two.\n\nRead expert recommendations\n\nThe Lumumba Plot: The Secret History of the CIA and a Cold War Assassination\n\nby Stuart A. Reid\n\nThe Lumumba Plot by Stuart Reid is about what happened when the Congo (now called the Democratic Republic of the Congo, but also called Zaire in the past) became independent from Belgium in 1960. The democratically elected prime minister, Patrice Lumumba, was killed in 1961, paving the way for the dictatorship of Mobutu Sese Seko. Reid follows the story of Lumumba, but also a cast of other characters, including Dag Hammarskjöld, the UN Secretary-General who was killed in a plane accident while on a peace mission in the Congo the same year. It's a well-told story, and a good way to learn about this period of history, which many people who have read Barbara Kingsolver's bestselling novel, The Poisonwood Bible, may be curious about (Kingsolver spent two years in the Congo as a child, in the early 1960s).\n\nRead expert recommendations\n\nVenice: The Remarkable History of the Lagoon City\n\nby Dennis Romano\n\nVenice: The Remarkable History of the Lagoon City is a new history of Venice by Dennis Romano, a historian at Syracuse University who has authored a number of books on the city. It's a long book (just over 600 pages) but covers the entire history of the city, from its mythic beginnings, through to the present with sections on medieval times, the Renaissance, 'old regime' Venicee as well as modern and contemporary Venice.\n\nRead expert recommendations\n\nThe New Roman Empire: A History of Byzantium\n\nby Anthony Kaldellis\n\nThe New Roman Empire by Anthony Kaldellis, a professor of Classics at the University of Chicago, is a one-volume work, 918 pages long, that covers the entire history of Byzantium and what we know about it to date. Excluding the subtitle, the book actually avoids the words Byzantium and Byzantines as \"misleading modern terms,\" but this is the period between Emperor Constantine's move of the Roman capital to the city that is now Istanbul in 330, and its fall to the Turks in 1453. This is a serious work of history, hard to hold in your hands if you're reading it in bed, but accessible to the layperson. It's an interesting empire to study the governance of because, as Kaldellis points out in the introduction, \"Though other phases of Roman history are studied more, this was the longest one. The eastern Roman empire, known colloquially to its inhabitants as Romanía, was one of the most durable states the world has ever seen.\"\n\nRead expert recommendations\n\nPax: War and Peace in Rome's Golden Age\n\nby Tom Holland\n\nPax: War and Peace in Rome's Golden Age by British historian Tom Holland is now out in both in the US and the UK. It's the third book in a trilogy that started with Rubicon, about Julius Caesar and the last years of the Roman Republic, and then went on to Dynasty, covering the rule of the Julio-Claudian family, the emperors we know so well: Augustus, Tiberius, Caligula, Claudius and Nero. Pax starts with the funeral of Nero's pregnant wife, covers the years when the Roman Empire was at its largest under Trajan, and ends with Hadrian (whose beautiful villa in Tivoli you can still visit).\n\nRead expert recommendations\n\nThe Earth Transformed: An Untold History\n\nby Peter Frankopan\n\nThe Earth Transformed is by Peter Frankopan, a professor of global history at the University of Oxford and a specialist on Byzantium. However, in The Earth Transformed he tells the story not of political dynasties and wars but of the world's climate. Frankopan is a nice writer so this is a good way to get up to speed on the world's climate history, though it is long—650 or so pages—so it's more compendium of information than quick summary.\n\nRead expert recommendations\n\nThe World: A Family History of Humanity\n\nby Simon Sebag Montefiore\n\nThe World: A Family History by Simon Sebag Montefiore is a doorstopper of a book but a fabulous way to read about world history on a truly global scale across thousands of millennia. What holds it together is a focus on families, starting with the first footprints of a family ever found right the way through to the Trump family. As Sebag Montefiore explains at the beginning, this a work of synthesis, based on his reading and travels over the decades, written up during the Covid lockdowns. It's a really remarkable work of popular history, and a lot of fun to read.\n\nRead expert recommendations\n\nPeerless among Princes: The Life and Times of Sultan Süleyman\n\nby Kaya Şahin\n\nA new biography of Süleyman (often called 'the Magnificent' in the West, but not in this book), the Ottoman sultan who ruled from 1520 to 1566. He was one of the most powerful men in the world but to the modern reader, his life seems utterly tragic. The book is by Kaya Şahin, a historian at Indiana University, who is able to bring his knowledge of Turkish sources to the story. Another aim of the book is \"to restore Süleyman's place among the major figures of the sixteenth century\"—which also included Henry VIII, Charles V and Francis I (Europe), Ivan IV (Russia), Babur and Akbar (India), Shah Ismail and Shah Tahmasb (Iran).\n\nRead expert recommendations\n\nThe Caliph and the Imam: The Making of Sunnism and Shiism\n\nby Toby Matthiesen\n\nTo understand world politics, it's important to understand the Middle East, and to understand the Middle East, it's worth understanding Sunnism and Shiism. The Caliph and the Imam by British historian/political scientist Toby Matthiesen looks at the history of these two branches of Islam from 632, when the Prophet Muhammad died and views differed on who should be his successor. Sunni stands for 'The People of the Tradition and the Community,' and supported four caliphs; Shia stands for 'Party of Ali', supporters of Ali as the sole successor. The book is above all a call for a less simplistic approach to sectarian differences as an explanation of problems in the Middle East. For, as Matthiesen writes, \"sectarian identity is most salient when political powers instrumentalize it\" and it's the interaction of doctrinal and political tensions that leads to conflict.\n\nRead expert recommendations\n\nIron and Blood: A Military History of the German-Speaking Peoples since 1500\n\nby Peter Wilson\n\nFor those of you interested in Prussian/German/Austrian military history—you know who you are—Peter Wilson, author of an excellent book on the 30 Years War—has a new book out that covers half a millennium of it. This is an excellent, accessible account, even just the title clarifying a misquotation many of us learned in school (Otto von Bismarck spoke of iron and blood, not blood and iron, in his famous 1862 speech, a reference to an 1813 poem).\n\nRead expert recommendations\n\nEmperor of Rome\n\nby Mary Beard\n\nEmperor of Rome by British classicist Mary Beard covers a number of emperors. According to a synopsis first reported in The Bookseller, \"it's much more than the usual emperor-by-emperor collection of biographies...For most Romans, one ruler was much like another and she takes a thematic approach instead – looking at the fact and fiction of these rulers, asking what they did and why, and how we have got such a lurid view of them. The themes are autocracy, corruption and conspiracy – and also the day-to-day practicalities of the emperors’ lives (who did the cooking, or took the dictation?).\"\n\nRead expert recommendations\n\nThe Scythian Empire\n\nby Christopher Beckwith\n\nIn The Scythian Empire Christopher Beckwith, Distinguished Professor in Central Eurasian Studies at Indiana University, makes the case for the Scythian Empire as \"one of the least known but most influential realms in all of world history.\" Scythian was an old Iranic language, and 2,700 years ago, speakers of the language were active around Asia on horseback. Beckwith makes the case that this was the largest empire the world had seen up to that point; even if you disagree it's an interesting read about a period many of us know little about.\n\nRead expert recommendations\n\nFemina: A New History of the Middle Ages, Through the Women Written Out of It\n\nby Janina Ramirez\n\nFemina is a really interesting book about medieval women and history by Oxford-based historian Janina Ramirez. The title is revealing in itself: ‘FEMINA’ was what Ramirez found scribbled in library catalogues alongside texts known to be written by a woman. It's likely they were considered less important and hence not preserved. In the book, Ramirez introduces various medieval women and what we know about them, authors of famous texts like Julian of Norwich or the Loftus Princess, who lived in the 7th century when Christianity was just coming to England and we know only from her bones and her pendant. As Ramirez writes at the opening of the book, \"Far from being 'unrecoverable,' developments in archaeology, advancements in technology and an openness to new angles have made medieval women ripe for rediscovery.\" Ramirez is a very engaging writer and knows just how to pique your interest (she also presents history on TV).\n\nRead expert recommendations\n\nWomen and the Crusades\n\nby Helen J. Nicholson\n\nWomen and the Crusades is by Helen Nicholson, Professor of Medieval History at Cardiff University in the UK. It's an analytical book, looking at the entire period of the Crusades, from the 11th to the 16th century. As anyone who has read \"The Wife of Bath\" in The Canterbury Tales knows, medieval women enjoyed going on pilgrimages, including to the Holy Land, so it's not surprising to find them engaged in crusading efforts. The book is one way to find out about both medieval women and the Crusades.\n\nRead expert recommendations\n\nIndia After Gandhi: The History of the World's Largest Democracy\n\nby Ramachandra Guha\n\nA new edition (the 3rd) of India after Gandhi by Indian historian Ramachandra Guha is due out in 2023. It's already available in India, but won't appear until July in the UK. This is one of the best books on modern India—according to people we've interviewed on Five Books—and well worth reading for Guha's historical perspective on the latest political developments.\n\nRead expert recommendations\n\nThe Holocaust: An Unfinished History\n\nby Dan Stone\n\nThe Holocaust: An Unfinished History is a book about the Holocaust by Dan Stone, Professor of Modern History and Director of the Holocaust Research Institute at Royal Holloway (part of the University of London). As a Holocaust specialist, he is able to explain what the Holocaust was and where we're at with our understanding of it—both in terms of scholarship and popular consciousness. This is a book for anyone who has felt uncomfortable at the number of novels and movies about the Holocaust aimed at a popular audience which, while sad, completely gloss over the horror of what happened.\n\nRead expert recommendations\n\nThe Story of Russia\n\nby Orlando Figes\n\nThe Story of Russia is a highly readable account of the whole of Russian history, from the early days of the Rus to the current war in Ukraine, in fewer than 300 pages. Historian Orlando Figes, author of our most recommended book on Russian history—A People’s Tragedy: The Russian Revolution—shows how that history is essentially a story. This is no different from any other country's national history, constantly changing to reflect current concerns, but it is a story many Westerners are unfamiliar with and crucial to understanding Russia today.\n\nRead expert recommendations\n\nKennan: A Life between Worlds\n\nby Frank Costigliola\n\nKennan: A Life between Worlds is an excellent biography of George Kennan, the American diplomat and Russophile who first raised alarm bells about Stalin after World War II, authoring an anonymous article in Foreign Affairs and \"The Long Telegram\". His biographer Frank Costigliola brings to life a man who loved Tolstoy and Chekhov, was devastated at never knowing his mother, and spent most of his life opposing the policy of containment towards the Soviet Union that he's best known for.\n\nRead expert recommendations\n\nVictory at Sea: Naval Power and the Transformation of the Global Order in World War II\n\nby Paul Kennedy and Ian Marshall (illustrator)\n\nPaul Kennedy, a historian at Yale and author of the iconic The Rise and Fall of Great Powers, charts the rise of America as a global superpower. The book grew out of a plan to accompany the watercolours of the late Ian Marshall (the illustrations are a key part of the book) but ended up arguing for the key role of US naval supremacy, which was absolute by the end of World War II. \"At no other time in history did the naval balances of power change as much,\" he argues.\n\nRead expert recommendations\n\nThe Last Emperor of Mexico\n\nby Edward Shawcross\n\nThe surreal story of Ferdinand Maximilian (1832-1867), the Habsburg archduke and younger brother of Emperor Franz Josef of Austria who was executed after a brief reign as Emperor of Mexico. In addition to the inherent interest of this strange tale, the book is also a nice introduction to a period when Mexico—which had been the centre of the Spanish empire in the Americas for three centuries—became independent but also lost ground to the emerging power of the United States.\n\nRead expert recommendations\n\nEthel Rosenberg: An American Tragedy\n\nby Anne Sebba\n\nThis is a biography of Ethel Rosenberg, the first woman executed in the United States not for the crime of murder, and mother of two small children, aged 10 and 6. Always paired with her husband as 'the Rosenbergs'—executed in New York State for spying for the Soviet Union—in this book Anne Sebba brings Ethel's own story to life, from her dreams for becoming a singer when she was young to the last hugs before she was put to death. As Sebba flags at the beginning, \"Ethel Rosenberg was not, I believe, a spy.\" She was a committed communist, loyal to her husband and not well-turned out (because the couple were poor) or emotional on the witness stand. That, apparently, was enough for her to end up on the electric chair, where even her electrocution was botched. Like so many Cold War stories, it's a brutal one.\n\nRead expert recommendations\n\nThe Middle Ages: A Graphic History\n\nEleanor Janega and Neil Max Emmanuel (illustrator)\n\nThe Middle Ages: A Graphic History is by Eleanor Janega, a medieval historian who teaches at a number of London universities and blogs at going-medieval.com and Neil Emmanuel, an illustrator who also worked on Time Team, Britain’s longest-running historical TV show. It's a lovely breeze through a millennium of history, focusing mainly on Europe and the Near East (according to the book, the medieval period in China ended in 960, which means China became 'modern' about 600 years before Europe did). It's a lot of fun and you learn a lot in a couple of hours.\n\nRead expert recommendations\n\nRiver Kings: A New History of the Vikings from Scandinavia to the Silk Roads\n\nby Cat Jarman\n\nThat many of the things we thought we knew about the Vikings is wrong was revealed to us in our Five Books interview about the Vikings with medieval historian Eleanor Barraclough in 2016. With our interest in Vikings awakened, it was exciting to see a book called River Kings: A New History of the Vikings from Scandinavia to the Silk Roads published in February 2021. River Kings is by archaeologist Dr Cat Jarman, who is a senior adviser to the new Museum of the Viking Age in Oslo. Specifically, she is a bioarchaeologist, which means she uses forensic tools—like isotope analysis, carbon dating, and DNA analysis—to try and figure out what happened to bodies buried more than a millennium ago. The book is absolutely mesmerizing, both about the techniques she deploys, and the story she tells about the Viking skeletons she uses those techniques on.\n\nRead expert recommendations\n\nNuclear Folly: A History of the Cuban Missile Crisis\n\nby Serhii Plokhy\n\nIn Nuclear Folly: A History of the Cuban Missile Crisis, Harvard historian Serhii Plokhy turns his attention to events in the 1960s which nearly led to nuclear armageddon between the US and the USSR. Plokhy's last book, on the Chernobyl disaster, was so brilliant that it won the UK's Baillie Gifford Prize, awarded for the best nonfiction book of the entire year. There are a number of books on the Cuban Missile Crisis told from the American side—starting with Robert F Kennedy's own memoir of that scary period—Thirteen Days—but Plokhy, who is a historian of the Ukraine, offers a more international perspective, including previously classified KGB documents.\n\nWe spoke to Serhii in December 2020 about the best books on Russia, selected annually by the judges of the Pushkin House Book Prize.\n\nRead expert recommendations\n\nLiving I Was Your Plague: Martin Luther's World and Legacy\n\nby Lyndal Roper\n\n\"Living I Was Your Plague, O Pope, dead, I will be your death\" are the words Martin Luther wrote on the wall, in chalk, the night before he died. They were the epitaph he wanted to be remembered by. This book, by Lyndal Roper, Regius Professor of History at the University of Oxford, is based on the Lawrence Stone Lectures delivered at Princeton University. In some ways, the book is a reflection on her biography of Luther, which was shortlisted for the 2017 Wolfson Prize, and has been recommended on Five Books as one of the best books on the Reformation. She further examines his anti-Semitism. It's also about how he shaped his public image, through, for example, his collaboration with the artist Lucas Cranach the Elder, whose distinctive artwork contributed \"perhaps more to the Reformation's success than anything apart from Luther's own writings\"\n\nRead expert recommendations\n\nA World Beneath the Sands: The Golden Age of Egyptology\n\nby Toby Wilkinson\n\nA World Beneath the Sands by Cambridge Egyptologist Toby Wilkinson tells the story of our encounter with ancient Egypt, from the Greeks and the first time a celebrity tourist—Julius Caesar—went down the Nile to the 20th century. He focuses on a \"heyday of Egyptology\" bookmarked by two epoch-making events: the decipherment of hieroglyphics, thanks to the Rosetta Stone, in 1822 and the discovery of Tutankhamun's tomb a century later.\n\nOur interview with Toby on Ancient Egypt is one of our most-read interviews on Five Books.\n\nRead expert recommendations\n\nFears of a Setting Sun: The Disillusionment of America's Founders\n\nby Dennis Rasmussen\n\nIn Fears of a Setting Sun: The Disillusionment of America's Founders, political theorist Dennis Rasmussen—whose research focuses on the virtues and shortcomings of liberal democracy and market capitalism—looks at the fears the Founding Fathers of the United States had about the future of democracy.\n\nWe spoke to Dennis about the best Adam Smith books and his previous book, The Infidel and the Professor, was one of our best philosophy books of 2017.\n\nRead expert recommendations\n\nOn the Ho Chi Minh Trail\n\nby Sherry Buchanan\n\nThe Ho Chi Minh Trail was the quasi-mythical network of roads, paths and tunnels that North Vietnam used, in its war against South Vietnam and the Americans, to transport military supplies to its supporters in the South, the Viet Cong. On the Ho Chi Minh Trail is a travelogue, charting American journalist, author and publisher Sherry Buchanan's trip down the trail in 2014, collecting the stories of the young women who played a vital role in keeping the trail open despite the constant American bombing. The book includes pictures of Vietnamese war art, maps and an itinerary (in case you want to follow in her footsteps!) and brings all of the author's knowledge of Vietnam to bear. It includes a photo of the author meeting with Võ Nguyên Giáp, the mastermind behind Vietnam's victory against both the French and the Americans, in 2006.\n\nRead expert recommendations\n\nEurasian Crossroads: A History of Xinjiang\n\nby James Millward\n\nIt's hard not to be aware of what is going in Xinjiang (literally 'new province') in western China where concentration camps are making a comeback. It's where the Uyghurs live, a generally Muslim ethnic minority who have never appreciated being ruled from Beijing. Historically, relations between the Uyghurs and Beijing have tended to go downhill when the centre is too controlling, and the last two decades have been a disaster. In this updated edition of Eurasian Crossroads James Millward, a leading American historian of the region, explains the historical context of a situation we all have a responsibility to be aware of.\n\nRead expert recommendations\n\nThe Age of Wood\n\nby Roland Ennos\n\nAt Five Books, we love global history and that means we do have a weakness for books that take one element/material/thing and tell its story across time and space. Roland Ennos, a Professor of Biomechanics at the University of Hull, has focused on a material that has never taken its rightful place in the nomenclature of ages we've lived through (Stone Age, Bronze Age, Iron Age), possibly because the Wood Age is still ongoing.\n\nRead expert recommendations\n\nFour Hundred Souls: A Community History of African America, 1619-2019\n\nby Ibram X. Kendi and Keisha N. Blain (editors)\n\nFour Hundred Souls is about African American history, from 1619—when the White Lion, the first African slave ship, arrived in Virginia—to the present, but it's also a really interesting book for anyone fed up with the standard historical narratives we learn in school. The book is a series of essays by historians and journalists, activists and poets. Altogether, it brings together 90 Black voices in 80 chronological chapters.\n\nWe spoke to Keisha N Blain, co-editor of the book, about Black women's history.\n\nRead expert recommendations\n\nThe Boundless Sea: A Human History of the Oceans\n\nby David Abulafia\n\n***Winner of the 2020 Wolfson History Prize***\n\nThe Boundless Sea is a fascinating book which tells the human story through our relation to the oceans—from the early settlement of the Polynesian islands of the Pacific 3,000 years ago to the present day. Extraordinary in its scope and fascinating in its detail, Abulafia ends with a plea for the sea to be protected as a UNESCO World Heritage site. According to Paul Lay, editor of History Today, “David Abulafia is a remarkable historian and this is, I think, his masterpiece.\"\n\nEditor's note: due to its size, it may be worth getting The Boundless Sea as an ebook, especially if you use an iPad or other tablet, and can still see the book's photos (many of sea-faring vessels) in full-colour.\n\nRead expert recommendations\n\nProvidence Lost: Cromwell's Last Year\n\nby Paul Lay\n\n\"The reason I wrote the book—which is called Providence Lost: The Rise and Fall of Cromwell’s Protectorate—is because the period has relatively little purchase with the wider public unlike, say, the Tudors or the Victorians or the Normans. That situation is particularly puzzling because there has been so much great scholarship on this period over the last two decades\"—Paul Lay, Five Books interview, December 2019.\n\nPaul Lay, editor of History Today, recommended the best history books of 2020 for us (and the best history books of 2018 and 2019 as well).\n\nRead expert recommendations\n\nThe Wolfson History Prize is the UK's most prestigious history book prize.
