        "text": "“Also known as ‘slow slicing’ or ‘death by a thousand cuts,’ Lingchi involved the removal by knife of flesh from the body in small pieces and small, non-deadly cuts to limbs and torso. After chunks of flesh had been removed from all of the limbs, they were amputated from the living torso. The executioner made sure not to bleed the victim too much in order to prolong death until the final cuts to the throat or heart were made. Lingchi was brutal and slow, and a punishment that carried on into the afterlife, where it was said that a person killed by lingchi would not be whole after death. According to Sir Henry Norman in his book The People and Politics of the Far East, the executioner sliced off pieces by ‘grasping handfuls from the fleshy parts of the body, such as the thighs and the breasts…then the limbs are cut off piecemeal at the wrists and the ankles, the elbows and knees, the shoulders and hip. Finally, the victim is stabbed in the heart and his head cut off.’ Lingchi was one of those brutal torture methods that were photographed in the 1800s with the advent of the camera, so there are a lot of scary photos of this one!”\n\nWow. Pretty terrifying huh? This was exactly the same feeling I had, when looking back at new US president Donald Trump’s early days in office. It seemed that there was no stopping the setback after debacles that his administration seemed to be constantly stumbling over. No sooner had Russia been implicated in helping him win the election, when his national security adviser had to be let go because of unauthorized dealings with the Russians and other foreign governments. And then he had his “repeal and replace” move against Obamacare repudiated by his own party. And just to add spice to the dish, his pal Steve Bannon was replaced – on his order no less – as the national security adviser. Like the Chinese envisaged in the gruesome “lingchi,” it seemed that the new administration was inching to a slow and painful process of self-extermination.\n\nAmerica seems to love tax cuts. The underlying theory is that this would reallocate money from the hands of government (who don’t know how to spend it wisely) to the hands of the private sector (who do know how to spend it wisely), thus benefitting the economy as a whole. Sounds simple, and yet it really does define what America is all about – a private sector-led free enterprise economy."
