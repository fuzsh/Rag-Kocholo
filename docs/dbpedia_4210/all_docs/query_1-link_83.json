        "text": "July 13, 2017\n\nWhile some chapters were a few pages long, the majority of the \"ways to go\" were maybe just a page in length-some even only a paragraph.\n\nThe chapters or the short descriptions on the types of death and torture instruments are in alphabetical order-some examples on what to expect is info on death by axe, the iron maiden, scaphismus, twenty-four cuts, and so forth.\n\nWas a quick and interesting read-overall, was just wanting more out of it.\n\nNovember 13, 2019\n\nA horrific testament to human ingenuity and/or barbarity depending on your point-of-view.\n\nJune 12, 2007\n\nSometimes I think that not everyone shares my macabre sense of humor, and then I feel slightly bad about laughing out loud while reading books like this in public. In my defense, this book is written in a darkly humorous tone, so it's hard not to laugh.\n\nExecution: The Guillotine, the Pendulum, the Thousand Cuts, the Spanish Donkey, and 66 Other Ways of Putting Someone to Death, by Geoffrey Abbott, is broken into 70 small sections, each with a different method of execution. Abbott describes each method, and then gives a short historical background and usually a primary source example. Most of them I'd heard of before, but others, like the Spanish Donkey and the Dry Pan, were new to me.\n\nWhat I like about this book, other than introductions to new methods of execution, is that it's broken up into convenient, small sections. It's actually the perfect bathroom book - you need to read this one bit at a time to really absorb the information (and picture it, curiously, with the face of someone you can't stand superimposed over the victim). The drawback of this is that it doesn't offer quite as much historical information as I would like, and I was also a bit disappointed that Abbott doesn't seem to use endnotes or footnotes (which is only to be expected by a mass-market publisher). He does provide a select bibliography (some of which the nerd in me is delighted to see that I've already read!) and cool appendices with executioner terminology and even an 1884 application to be an executioner. The tone of the book is humorous, but doesn't necessarily come down on either side of the capital punishment issue, which is refreshing compared to books by, say, Richard J. Evans (scholarly author), who seems to think that his reader needs to be reminded of how! horrible! executions! are! every page or so.\n\nI definitely recommend this book for the macabre goth kid in your family, and the history nerd, but probably not that person you always suspected would suddenly snap and kill their friends or family.\n\nSeptember 8, 2018\n\nThis is a brilliant little encyclopedia of extermination methods, be them well known and infamous or obscure and horrifying. Each chapter undergoes a similar pattern of description, method of use, and examples (both successes and failures, some of which appear in Abbott's \"The Executioner Always Chops Twice\"). Most of the chapters are very short, some not even a paragraph, and those that are exceedingly lengthy are so for good reason, such as the guillotine and hanging. It's grisly and descriptive, yet also humorous at times, which is a nice if unexpected touch for a book of this nature. All in all, I found this to be quite enjoyable and lived up to the expectations I had.\n\nFebruary 18, 2022\n\nThe subject is fascinating (regardless of your views on capital punishment), but after a while the steady diet of gore begins to pall. Of course in real life it wouldn't become passe, except perhaps to a psychopath, but on the pages of a book it does.\n\nStill, Abbott is a good, entertaining writer, and I'm not sorry I read the book.\n\nNovember 3, 2017\n\nInteresting anecdotes but found much of the information on Wikipedia afterward\n\nSeptember 27, 2018\n\nProposed alternate title: A History of People Suck. No way a book about executions should be this entertaining.\n\nOctober 22, 2018\n\nThe content obviously being intriguing I really thought this book would be more fun to read, but it ended up being sooo slow and a real chore to get through.\n\nNovember 6, 2021\n\nInformative and eery, quick read. The only thing that got me was that there are no footnotes.\n\nMay 19, 2016\n\nOverwhelmingly disappointing.\n\nFor one, Abbot focuses mainly on executions used in Europe, mainly Spain, France, and England. China is mentioned in one entry: Death by a Thousand Cuts with, admittedly, quite a bit of detail. The United States is also mentioned in the more modern methods, gas chamber, lethal injection, etc. But outside a few throw away lines about \"tribes in Africa\", Abbott has very little on the methods of execution in South America, Asia, Africa, Australia or really anywhere that isn't Spain, France or England.\n\nAlso a lot of the entries are short. Very short. After the 15 page history on of the Axe, we come to the Bastinado, a very interesting execution method where Executioners tap lightly on their victims feet until they die. Definitely more interesting than the axe in my opinion (which, again, got 15 pages.) If you would like to know more, well the entry is about half a page long, and around four paragraphs.\n\nAnd that is true of many executions in the book, street, with some just getting a few sentences on their page. Not only that, but Abbott decided he needed five variations of the guillotine (the diele, the guillotine, the Halifax gibbet, and the mannaia) and then only went into detail about the Halifax and the guillotine, giving the others less than half a page each.\n\nI was really hoping for something well rounded and was very disappointed by how unbalanced the book is.\n\nDecember 15, 2012\n\nThere were many parts of this book that were fascinating, unfortunately there were also many segments that went on for way too long. For example, they might spend 30-50 pages describing the guillotine and giving examples of when it was used, and then spend only a paragraph on some really interesting form of execution. Part of this is because more is known about forms of death like the guillotine and hanging than some of the more interesting ones, but that just means the book should be shorter. Still, it was worth reading.\n\nOctober 5, 2020\n\nA fun creepy book about the different forms of execution from ancient times to current, interesting tales of famous and botched executions as well as stories of executioners. My only gripe would be that there wasn't as much details on the lesser known forms of execution which were ones I wanted to know more about.\n\nNovember 17, 2007\n\nI cannot believe some of the ways in which society has chosen to dispatch its unwanted members. This book is an incredibly well researched, albiet disturbing list of the many methods of torture and execution used all over the globe.\n\nSo far, it is proving to be an excellent read, but I can really only read portions every once in awhile-it's not really the book that I can imagine tearing through in one sitting...\n\nApril 2, 2008\n\n66 awful ways people were executed. It is appallingly graphic. The author was a Yeoman Warder at the Tower of London and lived with his wife on the grounds. His is a very chatty, informal style and he includes personal opinions and jocular remarks in the work. He does a nice job of estimating how many miscreants were burnt alive, guillotined, etc.\n\nApril 29, 2012\n\nAn encyclopedic look at the various ways that people have been executed throughout history.\n\nI've always been a little bit morbid, so this was right up my alley. I enjoyed it for the most part, although it does get a little dry with certain entries, as the first-hand accounts get a little boring at times.\n\nOctober 8, 2015\n\nEesch. Yes, this book is exactly what you think it is. You know how people can make just about any awesome thing they can think of? Well, they can make any terrible thing too.\n\nIt was a good and interesting read though, apart from the copious grammatical and other errors (Raleigh, North Virginia, I ask you?)\n\nFebruary 23, 2021\n\nI checked this book out from my local library after another book of his was suggested to me. They did not have that book at the time, but I found this one. People came up with some really creative ways to torture and punish someone. I wonder how many confessions they got were true and how many were just made to get the torment to stop.\n\nDecember 6, 2008\n\nI am so deranged! I was fascinated by the more obscure means of execution such as being sewn up in a donkey corpse and left in the sun to rot. The human mind apparently has no limit to the creativity of killing one and other.\n\nRead\n\nApril 5, 2009\n\nFor anyone who's ever been fascinated with or mildly amused by the various and real historical methods by which people met their ends. The chapters are short. It's a dip-able book. Much easier to digest than that horrible \"1000 Ways To Die\" television program!\n\nNovember 9, 2011\n\nFun, little read that runs the gamut and really covers alot of truly horrible ways to die as well as some high points(?) during the type of execution. This book provides a wealth of information, background and brings love some of the people that either lived or died by the methods covered\n\nDecember 15, 2015\n\nI found this book a bit annoying, he dwelt way too much on the methods we already know a lot about, and too little on the things we aren't as familiar with. I didn't find it necessary to know the history of each executioner, and what they had for breakfast.\n\nJune 21, 2007\n\nNot as interesting as I had hoped. Too much detail on the things we've heard about, and not enough on the lesser-known ones.\n\nWant to read\n\nDecember 28, 2007\n\nJust got this for Christmas...sort of an inside-family-joke thing.\n\nFebruary 1, 2008\n\nSuper entertaining and quite informative! \"Essential reading for all gore junkies\" pretty much says it all.\n\nMarch 31, 2008\n\nThis book was weird, creepy, and hilarious. Check it out.\n\nOctober 13, 2008\n\nOverly dry at times, overly repetitive at others, and sometimes he forgets to explain things I'd really love him to explain, but still interesting reading.\n\nRead\n\nJuly 31, 2010\n\nIt was really interesting. I love reading/learning about different historical eras. It was interesting to finally understand the punishments I have so often read about."
