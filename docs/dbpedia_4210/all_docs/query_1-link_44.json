        "text": "LET THE LORD SORT THEM\n\nThe Rise and Fall of the Death Penalty\n\nBy Maurice Chammah\n\nIn 1972, the Supreme Court meted out a death sentence. The condemned was the death penalty itself. The American apparatus of state killing was effectively shut down, the punishment judged too final given the flawed human beings who gave it. But this death wasn’t final. A bipartisan band of bloodlust resurrected the death penalty, needling the annual count back up to a peak of 98 executions in 1999. From there, the death penalty began again to die. This time, it wasn’t a high edict that doomed it, but the unsung, helter-skelter, hydra-headed, revolution-by-a-thousand-cuts process through which real change often comes.\n\nThe journalist Maurice Chammah’s sober, densely reported first book, “Let the Lord Sort Them,” promises a history of “the rise and fall of the death penalty.” But as it tells that focused tale, it becomes — almost unwittingly — a case study that speaks more broadly to our current moment, about building monumental change brick by brick.\n\nHow? Not through big ideas in Washington, D.C., but through tedious grass-roots whittling. Not through purity tests but through unlikely coalitions of the righteous, the tainted and the grappling. Not by raising an issue’s visibility but by keeping its profile down.\n\n[ This book was one of our most anticipated titles of January. See the full list. ]\n\nIn a season of American life when so many want to get big things done and few seem to get anywhere, this story of the slow slaying of the death penalty — one that flies against many of my own intuitions — serves as a vaccine against the virus of fatalism.\n\nLike much that seems immovable, the death penalty is ancient. But it appears on the way out now, and, as Chammah, a staff writer for The Marshall Project, shows, it was on the wane once before, in the years leading up to the Supreme Court’s 1972 blow: “The news of American military atrocities in Vietnam — along with the discovery of German death camps a generation before — gave new power to the argument that governments should be restrained in their power over life and death.”\n\n[ Read an excerpt from “Let the Lord Sort Them.” ]\n\nWhen the Supreme Court finally ruled in 1972, in Furman v. Georgia, it didn’t declare execution unconstitutional in principle. Rather, a divided court found capital punishment to be ruled by caprice, irregularity and discrimination, and thus, as Justice Potter Stewart put it, a “cruel and unusual” violation of the Eighth Amendment.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
