        "text": "Before English speakers adopted the phrase “death by a thousand cuts” as an idiom to mean any failure resulting from many minor problems, it was one translation of the Chinese execution method, Lingchi chusi.\n\nIn Taylor Swift’s 2019 song “Death By A Thousand Cuts,” she metaphorically compares the phrase to the pain of saying goodbye. However, the origins of the phrase are quite a bit more literal.\n\nLingchi chusi\n\nLingchi chusi was one form of capital punishment used in China between 900 AD and 1905, when it was finally outlawed.\n\nAccording to Death by a Thousand Cuts (2008) by Timothy Brook, Jerome Bourgon, and Gregory Blue, Lingchi chusi or “to put to death by lingchi” has been translated to “death by slicing,” “the lingering death,” and of course “death by a thousand cuts.”\n\nBut, according to Brooks et al., it would be a mistake to consider death by a thousand cuts torture. Instead, torture is reserved for those acts that inflict pain to elicit information.\n\nInstead, the execution method should be considered torment, as its only goal is to inflict suffering before death."
