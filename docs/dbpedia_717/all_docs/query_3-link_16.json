        "text": "OVERVIEW\n\nThe health of Americans is shaped in neighborhoods and communities outside the healthcare system. This chapter highlights the relationship between health and the communities where people live, grow, learn, work, and age. It presents examples of how public policies and vital conditions—like affordable housing, quality education, and meaningful work—create thriving communities for children and families. Mobilizing resources and investments to create high-opportunity neighborhoods is a winning strategy to fix the U.S. health disadvantage.\n\nKEY TAKEAWAYS\n\n➤\n\nLow-opportunity neighborhoods are plentiful across the United States and are often found in proximity to high-opportunity neighborhoods.\n\n➤\n\nLow-opportunity neighborhoods lack the vital conditions necessary for health, wealth, and well-being, and they diminish the life chances of the people who live in them, particularly children.\n\nCompared with children in higher opportunity neighborhoods, children in lower opportunity neighborhoods attend preschool and graduate from high school at lower rates, have fewer green spaces, experience more days of extreme heat, and are more likely to lack health insurance and to live in homes with incomes below the federal poverty level.\n\nAcross the United States, differences in life expectancy between high- and low-opportunity neighborhoods can be as high as 25 years.\n\n➤\n\nLack of educational opportunities (from early child development to higher education) and lack of economic opportunities (jobs, job skills, career pathways, and family-sustaining incomes) contribute to the U.S. health disadvantage.\n\n➤\n\nThe intertwined health and economic disadvantages are substantial for business and society.\n\nA Tale of Two Communities\n\nImagine a community where children have access to a high-quality preschool. When these young children get older, they attend excellent schools in their neighborhood.1 Student achievement in reading and math is high in these schools, and superb high school graduation and college enrollment rates signal to youth that education is valued and attainable. The community is home to community centers, parks, and green spaces and offers easy access to healthy food retailers and other resources, such as banks and childcare. The community also enjoys an environment with low levels of pollution, high rates of employment and civic engagement, and low rates of poverty and crime. Parents of these children enjoy good jobs and short commute times to work. Communities with these characteristics are known as high-opportunity neighborhoods.\n\nCompared with families living in lower opportunity communities, families living in high-opportunity neighborhoods have more economic resources and reap significant, but often underappreciated, benefits, such as being able to spend more time raising children and less time commuting to work or working multiple jobs. An advantaged community is not defined only by the above features, but many would agree that such a community offers enhanced opportunities for children to grow and develop into healthy and productive adults. Many high-opportunity neighborhoods exist in the United States, and many children grow up and thrive in these types of communities.\n\nHowever, many communities across the country look different. If preschools exist, they are poor quality. Student achievement in neighborhood schools is low, and norms and expectations about high school graduation and college attendance are weak. Green spaces and healthy food retailers may not exist or may be rare, and levels of environmental pollution are high. Employment options are few, transportation is unreliable, and the rates of crime and poverty are high. Communities with these characteristics are known as low-opportunity neighborhoods. Children who grow up in low-opportunity neighborhoods often face more challenges than their peers who grow up in high-opportunity neighborhoods. As a result, these children can grow into less healthy, less educated adults.\n\nThese descriptions match two actual neighborhoods that are adjacent to each other in a U.S. metropolitan area (see Box 2.1). The differences in the opportunities available to children in these two communities play out in many neighborhoods across the nation, and these differences have serious consequences for the abilities of children to achieve their full potential. Health and life expectancy differences between low-and high-opportunity neighborhoods—even those in close proximity to each other—are stark.\n\nHealthy community environments are essential to support the development of human capital. Such environments contribute to a productive workforce and strong local markets.\n\nNeighborhood, as an environment, provides a critical context in which children can develop in healthy ways, and it influences the life chances of children as they grow into adults. The family environment imparts another strong influence on the development of children, but families function in a context established by a community’s ability (or not) to provide resources and conditions that shape health. Healthy community environments are essential to support the development of human capital. Such environments contribute to a productive workforce and strong local markets.\n\nBOX 2.1A TALE OF TWO REAL COMMUNITIES LESS THAN 3 MILES APART (REPRESENTATIVE OF MYRIAD SIMILAR COMMUNITIES ACROSS THE UNITED STATES)\n\nView in own window\n\nNeighborhood A (high opportunity)Neighborhood B (low opportunity)\n\nHow Communities Affect Health\n\nThe striking contrast between the two communities described in Box 2.1 is a powerful example of the large differences in conditions that promote health across the country, differences that sometimes exist between neighborhoods that are next to each other. Neighborhood features influence health and well-being through biologic and social mechanisms. For example, high levels of pollution may lead to a higher prevalence of childhood asthma, and high levels of crime or disrepair may increase the risk of physical injury and personal stress. On the other hand, the presence of healthy food retailers gives opportunities for residents to consume healthier foods, and green spaces provide opportunities for residents to engage in physical activities and to achieve a greater sense of well-being.\n\nSocial and environmental conditions in the neighborhoods in which children live and grow shape their health and affect their life chances. Although families certainly go beyond their neighborhoods to find resources and amenities, their immediate living environment is a powerful influence on children’s prospects in adulthood. Children who grow up in high-opportunity neighborhoods, like Neighborhood A in Box 2.1, have better chances of living long, healthy, and productive lives as a result of specific characteristics, such as better schools, positive social networks, safer environments, and less exposure to adverse behaviors. Supportive institutions, such as high-quality early education centers, positively influence child development and parents’ abilities to work and their stress levels and parenting behaviors. Children’s access to good schools can influence their decisions about the future, such as choosing to pursue higher education and working hard to attain that goal. Social networks, social cohesion, and social control affect health indirectly by influencing social factors that affect health. For instance, peer influences and role models affect youth development and outcomes later in life related to education, employment, and income. Absence of these features diminishes life chances for children who grow up in neighborhoods like Neighborhood B in Box 2.1. Children, families, and neighborhoods win or lose depending on the resources and conditions around them in the community. Society at large and government and businesses also win or lose as access to nearby resources fosters or diminishes opportunities for human potential.\n\nThe community level is not immune from outside influences. For instance, economic forces (e.g., regional housing and labor markets) and federal, state, and local policies (e.g., land use zoning, public school funding) that operate above the community level ultimately shape the community’s infrastructure and resources. The history of redlining illustrates the potent impact that decisions by public and private actors can have on community investment or disinvestment, and thus on community resources and characteristics (Box 2.2).\n\nBOX 2.2WHAT WAS REDLINING?\n\nRedlining was a broad and far-reaching legal discriminatory practice that led to negative and long-lasting decisions to underinvest in minority communities. Communities that were redlined experienced decades of disinvestment and neglect. In 1933, in order to avert housing foreclosures during the Great Depression, Congress created the Home Owners’ Loan Corporation (HOLC) to refinance mortgages that were in default. In 1935, to develop a national mortgage lending market, which had previously been based entirely on local knowledge and relationships, the Federal Home Loan Bank Board asked HOLC to create “residential security maps” in 239 cities.\n\nThe maps indicated various levels of security for real-estate investments. These maps had a large influence on the level of investment in communities. Different colors on the maps reflected the estimated level of risk of making loans in those neighborhoods. Areas colored yellow were characterized by “obsolescence and infiltration of lower grade population,” and areas colored red were considered “hazardous” and described by HOLC as “characterized by detrimental influences to a pronounced degree, undesirable population, or an infiltration of it.” HOLC recommended lenders either not make loans in these areas or grant loans on a very conservative basis. Notably, the risk level of an area closely mirrored the racial composition of its residents, as neighborhoods with predominantly minority, immigrant, or mixed populations universally received higher risk scores. For example, the inhabitants of a “hazardous” D-rated neighborhood in Brooklyn, New York, (colored red in the map) were listed as clerks and laborers with 30% foreign-born of Jewish-Irish predominance. Clarifying remarks about the map stated, “Colored infiltration is a definitely adverse influence on neighborhood desirability although Negroes will buy properties at fair prices and usually rent rooms.” As a result, these scores and descriptions strongly reinforced disinvestment in such communities.\n\nCurrent geographic patterns of concentrated disadvantage and prevalence of health problems closely follow the redlining maps of the past. Communities that were redlined in the 1930s share many of the same traits as neighborhoods like Neighborhood B around the country today (and would benefit from investment attention).\n\nToday, on average, formerly redlined areas are 28% Black, and 8% of African-Americans live in formerly redlined neighborhoods. Thus, addressing the needs of only the formerly redlined neighborhoods would likely miss many of the people who most directly experienced the decades of disinvestment. Tackling place-based inequities is only one facet of tackling race-based inequities. Finally, many rural and smaller communities (including some that have grown tremendously since the 1930s) were not included in the HOLC maps. Although redlining—based on those HOLC maps—is an important part of the history of neighborhood disinvestment, it is not the whole story.\n\nRedlining is just one example of the serious consequences that policy decisions have on the well-being of communities. Concentrating investments (by businesses and employers, community development corporations, large investment firms, and others) in low-opportunity neighborhoods can help to reverse the long-standing history of discrimination and disinvestment and the resulting economic and health disparities found in low-opportunity neighborhoods. Such investment, this report argues, will improve neighborhood conditions; increase opportunities; and strengthen health, wealth, and well-being for residents and communities.\n\nHow Health Differs Across Communities\n\nNeighborhood A and Neighborhood B, as detailed in Box 2.1, represent two extremes of the considerable variability in resources and conditions available for healthy living in the United States. These extremes—as well as conditions in the middle—exist in virtually every U.S. city, metropolitan area, suburban area, and rural area. An examination of this variation provides insight into the experiences of people living in different communities and into the costs to society of community environments that do not support healthy living.\n\nOne approach to quantifying the enormous variation is the Child Opportunity Index (COI) 2.0, a composite measure of child neighborhood opportunity for virtually all U.S. census tracts including urban, suburban, and rural areas. COI 2.0 combines information on 29 indicators in three domains: Education, Health and Environment, and Social and Economic. The COI was created after ranking all 72,000 neighborhoods in the United States. The neighborhoods were divided into five levels of child neighborhood opportunity: very low, low, moderate, high, and very high.\n\nshows selected indicators for children by level of child neighborhood opportunity. The intertwined health and economic disadvantages facing children who grow up in neighborhoods like Neighborhood B across the country are indeed severe.\n\nFigure 2.1\n\nFeatures of neighborhood opportunity for the average child based on selected COI 2.0 indicators for the 100-largest U.S. metropolitan areas. Note: COI = Child Opportunity Index.\n\nHealth and life prospects also differ substantially between residents of very-low and very-high-opportunity neighborhoods. Across the 100-largest U.S. metropolitan areas, life expectancy differs by 7 years between residents in very-low- and very-high-opportunity neighborhoods (75 vs. 82 years life expectancy) ( ). Throughout the United States, differences in life expectancy across census tracts, which in some cases are just a few miles apart, can be as high as 25 years ( ).\n\nFigure 2.2\n\nChild neighborhood opportunity level and average life expectancy at birth in the 100-largest U.S. metropolitan areas. Notes: Life expectancy is the average number of years a person can expect to live at birth for individuals born in a given neighborhood (more...)\n\nFigure 2.3\n\nLife expectancy at birth for U.S. Census Tracts, 2010–2015.\n\nImplications of Health Inequities for Communities\n\nWhere people live profoundly shapes their health, opportunities, and longevity. Nearly 10 million children live in very-low-opportunity neighborhoods within the 100-largest U.S. metropolitan areas. The majority of African American (66%) and Hispanic (59%) children live in very-low- or low-opportunity neighborhoods. Conversely, the majority of non-Hispanic White (66%) and Asian (62%) children live in high- or very-high-opportunity neighborhoods, reinforcing racial/ethnic differences in health outcomes and economic opportunities (calculations are based on data from the COI 2.0).\n\nThe costs of highly unequal access to neighborhood opportunity include reduced human capital, reduced economic productivity, lower educational achievement, less participation in the labor force, and lower potential for higher incomes as adults. Disparities in educational achievement are linked directly to levels of child neighborhood opportunity. Children with similar family structures, family incomes, and levels of parental education are more likely to drop out of high school and to have a teenage pregnancy if they grow up in high- versus low-poverty neighborhoods. Access to neighborhood opportunity also affects a person’s ability to climb the socioeconomic ladder. Socioeconomic mobility refers to the place in the household income distribution that people attain as adults compared with the place in the income distribution that their parents attained. A child growing up in a home at the 25th percentile of parent income in a low-opportunity neighborhood will likely have an annual income at 35 years of age that is $17,000 less than the income of a child who grew up with similar family characteristics but in a high-opportunity neighborhood ($29,000 vs. $46,000 annual income, in 2019 dollars, representing a 37% reduction in annual earnings, with associated implications for consumption of goods and services) ( ).\n\nFigure 2.4\n\nChild neighborhood opportunity level and socioeconomic mobility by adult household income (U.S. dollars) at 35 years of age among children growing up in households at the 25th percentile of the parent income distribution in the 100-largest U.S. metropolitan (more...)\n\nThe costs of highly unequal access to neighborhood opportunity include reduced human capital, reduced economic productivity, lower educational achievement, less participation in the labor force, and lower potential for higher incomes as adults.\n\nSocioeconomic mobility in the United States has declined steadily. The proportion of children earning more than their parents fell from 90% for children born around 1940 to 50% for children born around 1980. Restoring economic opportunity for more Americans would result in an increase in those with higher incomes and in higher standards of living, more consumption, and more social cohesion—all of which have enormous implications for economic prosperity. Improving neighborhood opportunity may be a promising strategy for promoting socioeconomic mobility.\n\nSummary\n\nThe health and social costs of living in a low-opportunity neighborhood radiate throughout the economy, reducing labor force productivity and availability and limiting consumption. Smart investments by leaders and decisionmakers at the federal, state, and local levels and by businesses and investors hold significant potential for enabling more children to thrive and become healthy and productive adults by both improving conditions in low-opportunity neighborhoods and creating real options for individuals and families who dream of moving to higher opportunity neighborhoods. (Chapter 4 describes examples of such community investment and introduces the community actors who facilitate such investments.) The payoff of creating or improving access to higher neighborhood opportunity accrues to children and can improve their life prospects as adults, and accrues to society as a whole in the form of improved health status, lower healthcare costs, higher productivity, and greater economic mobility.\n\nAccomplishing these gains will require addressing vast inequities across neighborhoods and investing in the broader conditions of the everyday lives of Americans. Chapter 3 argues why it is part of the purpose of business to do so, while Chapter 4 sets out options for investing in communities for business leaders to consider.\n\nAPPENDIX ATOOLS AND RESOURCES\n\nAppendix A identifies tools and resources addressing topics explored in Chapter 2. The tools and resources were created by such businesses and organizations as Aspen Institute, Child Welfare Information Gateway, U.S. Economic Development Administration, and others.\n\nPARTNERSHIP FOR THE BAY’S FUTURE: A High-Impact Model for Investment\n\nView in own window\n\nCommunity Challenge | Because of the success of the Bay Area of Northern California as a hub of technological innovation, land and housing costs have risen substantially in Silicon Valley. There, two breadwinners working full-time at $15 an hour—or $62,000 a year, which is close to the U.S. median household income—can afford to live in only 5% of Bay Area neighborhoods. This situation strains the health and well-being of lower- and middle-income families; major employers, including the “tech giants,” also feel the pressure. These employers recognize that their operations require a diverse labor market (e.g., maintenance technicians, administrative assistants, food-service workers) and that a community becomes unlivable for everyone when it cannot provide quality affordable housing for teachers, first responders, nursing assistants, transit operators, and others. Because the Bay Area expects nearly 1 million new jobs in the next 20 years, quality affordable housing for people from a variety of incomes is essential to continued growth.\n\nAction Taken | Partnership for the Bay’s Future is a novel collaborative that addresses these concerns, beginning with the urgent need for housing. The partnership includes local tech companies Facebook and Genentech, the managed care organization Kaiser Permanente, financial services giant JPMorgan Chase, as well as the San Francisco Foundation, the Ford Foundation, Local Initiatives Support Corporation, and others. With a combination of equity and loans, the partners have capitalized a new investment fund of more than $300 million, which is attracting additional fund investors with competitive returns.\n\nThe goal is to pool $500 million and, through a variety of new financing products, invest those funds across five Bay Area counties to preserve existing and build new affordable homes, help middle-income workers with housing costs, and fast-track the process of providing safe and stable homes to those experiencing homelessness in the Bay Area.\n\nThe fund offers small- and medium-sized community development corporations lines of longer term credit typically available only to large developers. The fund’s first transaction offered a revolving line of credit that helped the East Bay Asian Local Development Corporation, a community development corporation with deep roots in the community, quickly buy property for six projects over 5 years.\n\nKey Takeaway | The Partnership for the Bay’s Future illustrates the enormous promise of investment partnerships among public, private, and nonprofit stakeholders. Investment partners need not become developers or housing finance experts. Instead, community development financial institutions bring the infrastructure and know-how to manage the complex investment fund and connect with longtime Bay Area partners to ensure projects reflect the priorities of residents and community leaders. The Partnership also includes a regional policy component where interested businesses bring their power to advocate and to convene stakeholders in the public, private, and nonprofit sectors across municipal boundaries. Their common cause: The need for tens of thousands of preserved, expanded, and newly built affordable homes—the very foundation of health and economic vitality for individuals, families, and communities. While this progress represents only a tiny fraction of the Bay Area’s housing need, the Partnership for the Bay’s Future is a potential model for corporations and organizations nationwide to preserve and expand affordable housing. Wherever the availability of quality affordable housing is limited, such partnerships can address that lack of availability and be a first, critical step toward enhancing community health and economic prosperity.\n\nInvestments to create a robust business environment can powerfully improve the health and well-being of communities and strengthen business opportunities. Likewise, initiatives aiming to improve health can meaningfully contribute to a vibrant local business ecosystem. However, this synergy exposes a lesson and aspiration: Investors, philanthropists, public sector leaders, and communities must work together to realize the greatest return from their investments. Time spent stewarding these collaborations—including aligning goals and establishing mechanisms for coordination and accountability—will yield dividends in the form of stronger and more resilient businesses and communities."
