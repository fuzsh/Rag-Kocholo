        "text": "If you think you live in a safe neighborhood, you might be right, or you could be dreadfully mistaken. Fortunately, figuring out how to check neighborhood safety doesn’t have to be a guessing game based on perceptions, rumors and outdated information.\n\nBy using one of the many web-based tools that provide hard data on crime and other safety-related issues in neighborhoods all over the nation, you no longer have to guess, “how safe is my neighborhood?”.\n\nMost of the time, all you’ll need to do is enter your zip code or find your neighborhood on a map. Some, but not all, require a subscription or payment. In any case, you’ll know within minutes whether your neighborhood (or your soon-to-be neighborhood if a move is on the agenda) meets your safety requirements.\n\n“Awareness is your best defense [against crime],” a spokesperson for Family Watchdog, a website that provides information regarding where sex offenders and other convicted criminals reside, tells Forbes Advisor.\n\n“If you are buying a home and you have small children, do you want to live near a sex offender? If you are the survivor of a crime, do you want to live in an apartment complex with people who [have] committed that [same] type of crime?” the spokesperson adds.\n\nWe looked at several of these tools and identified a few choice options for figuring out whether your neighborhood is a common target for package thieves and late-night prowlers, a safe haven or somewhere in between.\n\nNeighborhood Scout\n\nAccessing Neighborhood Scout’s data requires a subscription, and at $49.99 for one month of access, it isn’t exactly easy on the wallet. However, the reports you get in return for your investment are very comprehensive, with information on everything from school quality and diversity to home prices, demographics and employment statistics.\n\nCrime-wise, the 30-plus page report details the actual number of crimes that occur annually in a specific neighborhood—you can either give them an address or select a neighborhood from a map. It also provides a crime “index” that tells you how safe your neighborhood is compared to other neighborhoods (a crime index of 39, for example, means that your neighborhood is safer than 39% of neighborhoods in the United States).\n\nFamily Watchdog\n\nFree and to-the-point, Family Watchdog provides an actual street address for registered sex offenders and people convicted of sexual battery. It also indicates whether the crime at hand was an offense against a child and whether that offense occurred at the offender’s home or somewhere else.\n\nAll you have to do is enter your address or zip code, and a map pops up with a distinctive icon for each type of offense (you can also sign up for notifications, so you’ll know immediately if an offender moves in or out of the neighborhood).\n\nFamily Watchdog gets the information they share from state and territorial registries, and maps are updated daily (as needed), a company spokesperson says.\n\nCrime and Place\n\nFor $4.99 a month or $49.99 for one year, Crime and Place is a mobile app that tracks your location and provides a “crime score” based on where you are at any given moment, as well as the number of violent crimes and robberies that have recently occurred near, said location.\n\nOther features include a five-year “crime forecast,” an interactive map with the ability to configure settings to closely suit your needs. The downside, however, is that Crime and Place is an iOS app, so you need an iPhone in order to access it. And, while they do offer a free one-week trial, some of the information (like the crime forecast) is inaccessible without a subscription. However, we like that you can take it with you wherever you go and access the information any time without entering a zip code or opening up a website.\n\nNextdoor\n\nUnlike the other tools on our list, Nextdoor is a neighborhood-based social media app. It does not provide crime stats or safety scores. Instead, it provides direct feedback from the people who live in the neighborhood via posts and shared links. (You join a Nextdoor group based on your address).\n\nIf a resident wakes up one morning to discover that all the tires on the block have been slashed, for example, they can post about it on NextDoor so other neighbors know to keep an eye on their own tire situation.\n\nHow do you know the people posting are legitimate neighborhood residents? Well, there is probably at least some margin of error when it comes to keeping imposters out, but everyone who joins must be invited by an existing member and provide an address that falls within the neighborhood’s boundaries.\n\nNational Sex Offender Public Website\n\nNSOPW is a government-run website that allows users to find information on registered sex offenders throughout the United States (including those in American Samoa, Puerto Rico, Guam, the Northern Mariana Island and the U.S. Virgin Islands).\n\nThe website is searchable by entering the name of an offender, a zip code or a specific address (if you enter an address, you’ll receive a list of offenders located within a certain radius of that address). Search results come in the form of offenders’ names, with links to corresponding municipal or state law enforcement websites where you can get more information.\n\nGenerally, though, you’ll receive street addresses for local registered sex offenders—allowing you to avoid buying a home right next door to someone convicted of sex crimes before it is too late.\n\nPRO TIP: Be aware that the level of detail varies, depending on where the individual was convicted).\n\nAugurisk Now\n\nAugurisk Now was launched at the tail end of 2020 and uses artificial intelligence to help evaluate the level of safety in your neighborhood (or any neighborhood).\n\nThis tool is available online, in Google Play or as an iOS app, and works to give users a “localized crime risk assessment”—a.k.a. a crime score—if and when you step into a dangerous area, theoretically providing you with the opportunity to turn back around if you inadvertently find yourself touring real estate listings in a high-crime neighborhood, assuming you have location services enabled. (The company says their accuracy level is 77%)."
