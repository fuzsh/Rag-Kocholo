The data we display will always be the most current available.\n\nHow Can I Get My Agency Online?\n\nSharing crime data with the community is a choice each department makes. If you believe your agency should join this nationwide effort please contact the public information officer at your local law enforcement agency to let them know about CrimeMapping.com. Hearing from a member of the community that they serve will have a greater impact than hearing from us.\n\nCreate Personalized Alerts\n\nYou can create multiple alerts that track crime and/or sex offender movement in any area of interest. Simply define an area of interest, verify that the local law enforcement agency for that area is providing data to CrimeMapping.com and choose which types of crimes and/or sex offenders you are interested in. You will receive an email when new activity occurs."
