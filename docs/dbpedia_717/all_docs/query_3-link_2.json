        "text": "Site: Atrium Health\n\nFocus Area: Neighborhood Characteristics\n\nMeasure: Poverty Rate\n\nThis content presents an example of how one health care site, Atrium Health, used data on the health equity indicator, poverty. Poverty is most commonly defined as the lack of resources necessary to meet basic human needs.172 Poverty has been linked to several adverse health outcomes, such as infectious disease, maternal and infant mortality, diabetes, kidney disease, CVD, and many others. The effect of poverty is observed not only at the individual level but also at the community level. Several studies have reported that the county-level poverty rate is a strong predictor of heart failure, coronary heart disease, and CVD mortality.173,174,175 Atrium Health used poverty rates to measure poverty. Poverty rate is defined as the proportion of families (people/households) living with incomes below the federal poverty level. For more information on the poverty rate measure, please see the poverty indicator in the Neighborhood Characteristics Indicator Profile.\n\nThe description of Atrium Health’s data analysis methods, data sources, challenges, and facilitators summarized below reflects insights gathered during the Health Equity Indicators for CVD Pilot Study conducted between January and April of 2022.\n\nHealth Equity in Action: Atrium Health\n\nAtrium Health is a hospital network spanning the Carolinas, Alabama, and Georgia and comprising 40 hospitals and more than 70,000 employees. Atrium Health partners with more than 50 community organizations to support a community health worker program, mobile primary health care units, and other programs specifically tailored to the populations of focus, including those with food insecurities and lack of access to primary care. One initiative is the COVID-19 Isolation Motel (IM), a program Atrium Health operated in collaboration with the Mecklenburg County Public Health Department in North Carolina for patients with COVID-19 or those exposed to SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, who could not isolate or quarantine. The program aimed to address social needs, including housing and medical care access. Atrium Health agreed to work with CDC to pilot some health equity indicators to support its work in addressing the social service needs of its population of focus.\n\nOverview of Atrium Health’s data collection methods\n\nIndicator: Poverty\n\nMeasure: Poverty Rate\n\nData Collection Method: Secondary data collection\n\nData Source: American Community Survey (ACS)\n\nData Availability: Census-tract\n\nApplication/Use: Assessment of neighborhood poverty levels in a sub-population of COVID-19 patients.\n\nData Collection and Analysis Method. As part of the pilot of select health equity indicators, Atrium Health tested the poverty indicator to study poverty rates among patients within their COVID-19 Isolation Motel (IM). The team used the Brown Longitudinal Tract Database (LTDB), sourced from the American Community Survey (ACS), to analyze the poverty measure. Specifically, Atrium Health identified census tracts where 20% or more of the population is living in poverty.\n\nTo assess health inequities among COVID-19 patients and support their ongoing analysis of IM patient data, Atrium Health extracted LTDB data across multiple time periods at the census-tract level. Using patient addresses captured through the patient intake process, the team geocoded addresses to census tracts and linked the patient data with the LTDB data.\n\nAnalysis results indicate that of the 184 IM patients who were not experiencing homelessness, 84 (45%) lived in census tracts with poverty rates above 20% between 2015 and 2019 and 117 (64%) resided in census tracts with poverty rates above the 20% threshold between 2008 and 2012. About one-fifth (21%) of IM patients lived in census tracts that consistently reported poverty across multiple ACS and the decennial census (2000 decennial census, 2008–2012 ACS, 2015–2019 ACS).\n\nAtrium Health plans to use data visualizations in various partner meetings to report these findings to demonstrate the social determinants of health factors that affect the patient population the IM serves. Given the link between COVID-19 and CVD following diagnosis,176 this analysis has potential for broader application to assessing the relationships between poverty and CVD.\n\nFacilitators. Atrium Health noted that leadership buy-in and financial support were crucial to ensure that they had the staff to analyze data. Specifically, Atrium Health had a dedicated Impact Evaluation and Grants Management team lead data analysis, under the leadership of the Division of Community & Social Impact. The team’s expertise in health equity research, data analytics, and health informatics was a major facilitator for linking data across different data sets and completing the analysis within the desired time frame. The team can apply this experience to develop evaluation and data collection protocols for Atrium Health’s other health equity programs.\n\nChallenges and Limitations. The COVID-19 pandemic affected data quality and accuracy, specifically lag time for updating public data. However, the team did not encounter any other major barriers to using secondary data from the ACS for this analysis.\n\nFuture Plans. Atrium Health expressed interest in taking advantage of its business intelligence tools and databases of patient health care utilization, demographics, and health outcomes for future health equity analysis work. The team also noted their plans to leverage geographic indicators to support the strategic deployment of place-based resources into communities with the greatest needs and where those resources will have the most significant impact. Geographic indicators can also be used to enhance clinical and community-based program evaluation by providing information on environmental exposures to social and health risk factors and helping to measure the impact of programming on the population of focus.\n\nHealth Department: Los Angeles County Department of Public Health\n\nFocus Area: Neighborhood Characteristics\n\nMeasure: Park Access\n\nThis content presents an example of how one health department, the Los Angeles County Department of Public Health (LACDPH), used data on the health equity indicator physical activity environment. Key aspects of the built environment, such as proximity to parks and open space, positively impact the frequency and intensity of participation in physical activity.177,178,179\n\nResearch has consistently shown that lack of physical activity is associated with a spectrum of chronic conditions, including cardiovascular disease (CVD), obesity, diabetes, osteoporosis, and psychological disorders.180 LACDPH leveraged the park access measure as a factor for informing and implementing key health interventions.181 Park access is defined as the portion of a city’s or a local jurisdiction’s population living no more than a 10-minute walk to a park.182 For more information on the park access measure, please see the Physical Activity Environment indicator in the Neighborhood Characteristics Indicator Profile.183\n\nRepresentatives from LACDPH participated in a subject matter expert panel to provide input for the development of CDC’s Health Equity Indicators for CVD toolkit. To support this work, LACDPH shared this example of how their Chronic Disease and Injury Prevention division accessed and analyzed data—including data sources, challenges, and facilitators—on park access. Their approach and lessons learned are summarized below.\n\nHealth Equity in Action: Los Angeles County Department of Public Health\n\nLACDPH serves more than 10 million residents, of whom 48.4% are Hispanic/Latino, 28.3% are White, 14.4% are Asian American, and 8.5% are Black/African American. LACDPH is committed to developing and implementing policies and programs that support the department and the overall county government’s priority to advance health equity. For example, LACDPH’s Center for Health Equity assists other programs within the department in addressing health disparities. As part of this effort, LACDPH worked with the county’s Department of Parks and Recreation to implement the Parks After Dark (PAD) program, an initiative designed to serve as a place-based strategy for building resilient communities that re-envisions parks as community hubs. In addition to PAD, LACDPH is developing a Park Rx program under the oversight of the Join Us in Moving People to Play (JUMPP) Coalition.184 Park Rx is an initiative that educates and encourages medical providers to connect patients to parks; in doing so, these providers can help patients enjoy physical activity and mental health benefits from visiting parks. A number of years ago, LACDPH also received funding from the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation to promote park access by increasing physical activity opportunities through shared use agreements. These agreements are developed and executed when government entities, or sometimes private and/or nonprofit organizations, agree to work with schools to open campus facilities or provide open space for community use.\n\nOverview of LACDPH's data collection methods\n\nIndicator: Redlining\n\nMeasure: HOLC Risk Maps\n\nData Collection Method: Secondary data analysis\n\nData Source: Home Owners’ Loan Corporation (HOLC) maps\n\nData Availability: Census tract\n\nApplication/Use: Spatial analysis of redlining data overlaid with chronic disease prevalence data at the census tract level.\n\nData Collection and Analysis Methods. LACDPH used public data from the Los Angeles County Geographic Information System (GIS) Repository to overlay data layers by Service Planning Area (SPA) boundaries and by park locations. The department also used public data from the Public Health Alliance of Southern California’s Healthy Places Index (HPI) to visualize socioeconomic gaps across Los Angeles County. Collectively, these analyses generated socio-geographic information that LACDPH and its partners used to help identify locations where PAD and other public health programming could be implemented to help communities that lack access to health-promoting resources (Figure 1). The HPI is a composite score ranging from 1 to 99 that ranks the well-being of neighborhoods in terms of social conditions and health. The HPI consists of 23 indicators across eight domains: clean environment, economics, education, health care access, housing, neighborhood, social condition, and transportation. Higher HPI values indicate less healthy community conditions. LACDPH divided HPI scores into four quartiles and mapped these scores at the census-tract level.\n\nChallenges and Limitations. The COVID-19 pandemic affected the timeline and level of LACDPH programming in the community; specifically, the health crisis delayed the continuation of shared use agreements, because most schools were closed, and delayed the launch of the Park Rx program. In addition, LACDPH noted that safety presents a constant barrier to park access and programming in a number of low-income areas.\n\nFigure 1. Map of Park Locations and HPI by SPA in Los Angeles County\n\nImage description: A colored map of the Healthy Places Index and park locations by service planning areas in Los Angeles County in 2022. The points represent park locations. Parks indicated by turquoise (n = 6), yellow (n = 10), and magenta (n = 13) points were Parks After Dark locations. Grey points indicate all other park locations. The boundaries indicate the eight service planning locations, and the color-coded shading represents the Healthy Places Index at the census-tract level. The Healthy Place Index color scale is divided into four quartiles that range from dark orange, representing the most disadvantaged census tracts, to light orange, light blue, and blue, which represents the least disadvantaged census tracts. Census tracts shaded in light gray did not have Healthy Place Index data available.\n\nHealth Department: Minnesota Department of Health (MDH)\n\nFocus Area: Neighborhood Characteristics\n\nMeasure: Social Vulnerability Index (SVI)\n\nThis content presents an example of how one health department, the Minnesota Department of Health (MDH), used data on the health equity indicator social environment. Neighborhood social environment refers to the physical, material, social, and socioeconomic conditions in a given community. Disadvantaged or socially vulnerable neighborhoods are usually characterized by high concentrations of poverty, high rates of unemployment, and limited material resources and services, such as poorer access to quality housing, health care, healthy food, community resources, and recreational facilities. MDH used the Social Vulnerability Index (SVI) to assess the social environment. Social vulnerability refers to the potential negative effects on communities caused by external stresses on human health.185 The SVI measures the extent to which a community is resilient to external stressors by using 15 social factors from across four themes: socioeconomic status, household composition and disability, minority status and language fluency, and housing type and transportation.186 Living in a stressful neighborhood environment contributes to physiologic, neurologic, and psychological dysfunction that adversely affects cardiovascular health.187,188 One study on the relationship between SVI and cardiovascular risk found that Black/African American women living in the top 10% of most socially vulnerable neighborhoods were three times more likely to have hypertension than those living in less vulnerable neighborhoods.189 For more information on the SVI measure, please see the Social Environment indicator in the Neighborhood Characteristics Indicator Profile.\n\nRepresentatives from MDH participated in a subject matter expert panel to provide input for the development of CDC’s Health Equity Indicators for Cardiovascular Disease (CVD) Toolkit. As part of this process, MDH shared the following example of how they accessed and analyzed data on social environment, including data sources, challenges, and facilitators. Their approach and lessons learned are summarized below.\n\nHealth Equity in Action: Minnesota Department of Health (MDH)\n\nMDH is based in St. Paul, Minnesota, and serves approximately 5.7 million residents, of whom 76.3% are White, 6.9% are Black/African American, 6.1% are Hispanic/Latino, 5.2% are Asian American, and 1.0% are American Indian/Alaska Native. MDH has a number of initiatives to advance health equity, such as the Eliminating Health Disparities Initiative, which funds innovative community-led grants to address health inequities for Minnesotans of color and American Indians across eight priority health areas, including CVD and diabetes. MDH also implemented a COVID-19 vaccine strategy aimed at reducing inequities in COVID-19 illness in communities with high social vulnerability. MDH’s COVID-19 response included community outreach to disseminate culturally relevant, linguistically appropriate, accurate, and timely messages related to COVID-19, including vaccines and testing. Specifically, MDH created a new Cultural, Faith, and Disabilities Branch to facilitate community engagement and reach diverse Minnesota communities, including communities of color, American Indian residents, LGBTQIA+ residents, residents with disabilities, and faith-based communities.\n\nOverview of MDH’s data collection methods\n\nIndicator: Social Environment\n\nMeasure: Social Vulnerability Index\n\nData Collection Method: Secondary data analysis\n\nData Source: CDC/ATSDR SVI\n\nData Availability: Census tracts\n\nApplication/Use: Association between SVI quartiles and COVID-19 vaccine inequity at ZIP code level.\n\nData Collection and Analysis Methods. MDH accessed SVI data from CDC and the Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry (ATSDR). MDH divided the overall SVI score into quartiles to identify and prioritize communities with the greatest need. The team recalculated the SVI score for ZIP codes, rather than census tracts, using a crosswalk file from the Department of Housing and Urban Development. The team further calculated COVID-19 hospitalization and death rates to identify and compare the ZIP codes with the highest social vulnerability and highest COVID-19 burden within Minnesota. The analysis also compared results by region and visualized variation in SVI across the state. Specifically, MDH stratified the SVI data by the seven-county Twin Cities metropolitan area (i.e., Minneapolis, St. Paul, and surrounding counties) and by Greater Minnesota and displayed results in choropleth maps. For various reasons, residents of the Twin Cities metro area have had historically different health outcomes from those of the residents of other regions of Minnesota (also called Greater Minnesota).\n\nFindings. The analysis found that Minnesotans living in the ZIP codes with the most vulnerable SVI quartiles had a greater burden of COVID-19 hospitalizations and deaths, as well as lower vaccine coverage. Residents in ZIP codes of high social vulnerability had consistently lower access to vaccines.\n\nThis analysis informed MDH’s strategy for vaccine prioritization. ZIP codes with SVI quartiles corresponding to the greatest social disadvantage were prioritized for initial vaccine distribution, resulting in the allocation of 40% of vaccine doses to these high-SVI ZIP codes. Likewise, high-SVI ZIP codes were also prioritized for COVID-19 educational outreach through focused initiatives from the Cultural, Faith, and Disabilities Branch of the MDH COVID-19 response. Given the link between COVID-19 and CVD,190 this analysis has potential for broader applications in assessing the relationship between vaccine access and CVD.\n\nFacilitators. Community vaccination sites were vital to close the gaps in vaccination rates by reducing community barriers to accessing COVID-19 vaccines. Additionally, strong support from the governor and collaborations with other state agencies and health systems greatly facilitated the MDH COVID-19 response and health equity efforts. MDH worked with the Electronic Health Record (EHR) Consortium, a collaborative of 10 large health care systems in the state, to track equity in its vaccine campaign using the SVI. MDH also utilized expertise from other state agencies and brought in the Medicaid medical director from the Minnesota Department of Human Services to serve as the Assistant Commissioner for Vaccine Equity. Overall, the public health emergency furthered MDH’s commitment to address health inequities and led to the formation of the new Health Equity Bureau, which will continue and expand health equity work across the agency.\n\nChallenges and Limitations. While there were no challenges in accessing and downloading the SVI data, analyzing the SVI data required additional data manipulation due to the unit of analysis. SVI data are only available at the census tract and county levels; however, most health data at MDH are at the ZIP code level. Cross-walking the SVI data from census tracts to ZIP codes was methodologically challenging and time-consuming. Another limitation with the unit of analysis is that populations within ZIP codes can be highly heterogenous, which may obscure certain communities that have small populations but have high social needs. Additionally, the lack of familiarity with SVI was a barrier when communicating research results. The analysis team at MDH noted that communicating the concept and measurement of social vulnerability was challenging both internally within MDH and externally with community partners and community members."
