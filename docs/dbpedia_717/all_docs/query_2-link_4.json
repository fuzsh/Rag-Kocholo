        "text": "Buying a new home is an exciting journey! You’ve likely considered the amenities you want in your first home, and you probably have an idea of what city/region you want to live in, but there’s more to it than that. Even if you have a general location in mind, it’s important to dig deeper into the different areas of any city. If you're grappling with what to look for in a neighborhood, here are some crucial factors to contemplate while scouting for your dream location.\n\n1. Neighborhood Safety\n\nThe safety of a neighborhood is a very important factor when looking to buy a house, especially if you have children. Here are some things you can look into to help you get a better sense of whether or not a neighborhood feels safe:\n\nCrime statistics: Every area will have some criminal activity from time to time, so don’t be overly discouraged if you can't find a completely crime-free area. There are plenty of reputable online resources to check crime maps, but the most accurate data will likely come from the criminal reports on the city’s website or directly from local law enforcement. Also, consider how it might change based on seasonality. For example, if you are house hunting in the winter, the month-over-month report for the colder months may be different than what it is over the summer when there are events and activities bringing more people to the area.\n\nNeighborhood watch: Is there a neighborhood watch group established in the area? This may not be a deal breaker, but it’s something some families value. Ask local law enforcement or one of the residents. You might also see a street sign indicating it is a neighborhood watch area.\n\nStreet lighting: Adequate street lighting can help many people feel safer in a neighborhood.\n\nTalk with neighbors: If you see someone walking their dog, mowing the lawn, or just grabbing their mail, introduce yourself by telling them you may be interested in moving to the neighborhood. Residents can tell you firsthand whether or not they feel the area is safe.\n\nOf course, these aren’t the only ways to determine the safety of a neighborhood, and you should always trust your instincts. If it doesn’t feel right, keep searching for the neighborhood that makes you feel secure. Spending time in a neighborhood you’re looking at is a good idea, too.\n\n2. Nearby Necessities\n\nFood, medications, and toiletries are necessities for daily life. If convenience is important to you, you may want to consider choosing a location that’s close to where you will be running a majority of your errands.\n\nMap out where the neighborhood is in relation to the nearest pharmacy, grocery, and department stores. Are they conveniently close, or will your trip to the store require more time or effort?If these stores are not necessarily close to your home but are on your way to/from work, school, or daycare, that is also something that may factor into your decision.\n\n3. School District\n\nWhether you're planning to have kids in the near future, you just had your first child, or you have a few youngsters in school already, finding a well-performing school district is something many families prioritize when looking for the right location to live. How do you determine if a school district is \"good\" or not?\n\nTest scores and data: State test scores can be an indicator of whether a certain school district is performing at, below, or above the state average. Minnesota Report Card provides graduation rates, MCA and MTA test scores, and information about access for English language learners, demographics, and more.\n\nProgramming: School programming can be a big deal for some families. If the adults in the house work full time during the day, after-school programs can be a big help in the few hours after school before the workday ends. For families with children who have special needs, it is very important to choose a district that has the resources to give them proper accommodations, extra support, etc. If your student does well in many classes, you may want to see if the district you're considering offers Advanced Placement (AP) classes or college-level courses that can go toward continued education after high school.\n\nExtracurricular activities: Maybe your child loves writing or performing in musicals. Does the school have a newspaper? What about a science/math/art/book club?Finding a district that caters to your children's interests and strengths will help toward their success.\n\nSports programs: Maybe you assume all school districts offer high school football, have a swimming team, and are competitive in lacrosse. But maybe the district you're looking into is too small or lacks the funding to support specific sports. Double-check to see what athletic programs are offered.\n\nPTO: If open parent and teacher communication and cooperation is important to you, ask about its Parent Teacher Organization or Association (PTO/PTA). Is there one? How many people actively participate? How often do they meet? What types of topics are discussed when they do meet? Is it an open and welcoming group?\n\n4. Nearby Parks, Walking Paths, or Dog Parks\n\nEven if you’re looking to buy a home during the winter season, it is still important to check out the outdoor amenities a neighborhood has to offer. You may want to consider taking a drive or walk around the area, and checking for things like:\n\nSidewalks: This may seem like an obvious one, but well-maintained sidewalks make a neighborhood more accessible for people with disabilities and/or no alternative route of transportation.\n\nParks: This may be important for you, your children, and even your dog.Is there one within walking distance,or is it a short drive away? What amenities does the park have? If it's not something you would visit, it might not matter, or it might deter you from buying a house in that neighborhood.\n\nWalking trails: Maybe you take your dog for a walk every morning before you go to work, or you enjoy a family stroll after dinner. Look around for nearby walking trails or locate a city trail map.\n\n5. Commute to Work\n\nAs gas prices continue to climb, many people would greatly appreciate a shorter commute. Also pay attention to the routes you can take to get there–just because the distance is shorter in mileage does not necessarily mean it will take less time with traffic and construction.If driving yourself isn’t an option, or one you prefer to avoid, look into transportation options such as metro transit buses or light rail.\n\n6. Activities in the Area\n\nAside from the necessities you need to survive, does your potential new neighborhood have what you need to thrive? If you’re someone who enjoys going out or getting takeout, scope out the nearby restaurant scene. If you enjoy spin classes or yoga, check to see if there’s a gym or studio nearby. If you’re a big reader, see if there’s a library or bookstore close by.\n\nOther Things to Remember\n\nThe same features that make a neighborhood desirable can also raise the demand for (and prices of) homes in that area. If this happens to you while searching for a home, you may need to take a step back and rethink your approach. Prioritizing your \"must-haves'' during your home search will make the decision process much easier down the road. You should also work with your realtor and get an idea of how competitive the housing market is in that area. Are people waiting months, a year, or even more to buy homes in that community?\n\nIt's helpful to determine whether you love the house or the neighborhood. If it’s the neighborhood you love, and the house price is too high, you have a few options. First, you can try to find a smaller home in the area that you can afford. If that's not an option, you can also go back to your \"must-haves\" list and see if there are any amenities/finishes/etc. that you're willing to give up to find a home in that neighborhood.\n\nIf it’s the home you love, understand that you can pay the same amount for very different houses depending on the community you’re looking in. Try to identify what it is you love about the house. Chances are, there's a home in a neighborhood nearby that’s less expensive, but has a similar neighborhood feel and community amenities.\n\nRemember to take your time searching and don't be afraid to drive around the area, talk to neighbors, and ask questions. You want to be comfortable when making a big decision like where to buy a house, and you want to be confident in your choice. Make sure to have honest, open conversations with people you trust during the homebuying process such as family members, your realtor, or a financial coach. They can help set realistic expectations and offer advice and opinions when you're making a decision."
