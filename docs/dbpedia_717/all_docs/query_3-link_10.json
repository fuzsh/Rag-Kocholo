However, few studies have examined relationships between neighborhood characteristics and transport walking accounting for a complex suite of personal factors. This study employed a structural equation modeling approach to examine associations between neighborhood characteristics and transport walking behaviors by accounting for residential preferences, self-assessed factors that affect decision to walk for transportation, and socio-demographics; and to examine whether neighborhood effects were modified by walking attitude and residential preferences. Based on a cross-sectional phone and mail survey of 2,848 residents of New York City, Baltimore, Chicago, Los Angeles, St. Paul, and Winston Salem in 2011-12, we found neighborhood characteristics had significant independent associations with transport walking, even after adjusting for residential preferences and other personal factors. Neighborhood effects on transport walking did not differ significantly by walking attitude or residential preferences. Our findings highlight the importance of neighborhood effects in promoting transport walking, and suggest that while residential preferences are important factors, they do not obviate the neighborhood effects on transport walking.\n\nKeywords: neighborhood effects, transport walking, residential self-selection, walking attitude, structural equation modeling\n\n1. Introduction\n\nThere is growing interest in transport walking due to its potential to increase physical activity and to reduce reliance on motorized vehicles. Many environmental factors and personal factors that could influence transport walking have been identified. Regarding neighborhood environments, availability of or access to suitable walking environments is considered an important factor for transport walking. Environments supportive of walking include functional infrastructure (e.g., walking surfaces, paths, sidewalks), close proximity to destinations (e.g., shops, jobs, schools, transit stops, family and friends), and the mixing of various uses of land (Cervero and Duncan, 2003; Cervero et al., 2009; Christiansen et al., 2016; Duncan et al., 2010; Kerr et al., 2016; Knuiman et al., 2014; Larranaga et al., 2016; Nathan et al., 2014; Rodriguez et al., 2009). A few other domains have been associated with more walking: aesthetic qualities of the environment (Harvey and Rodriguez, 2017; Hoehner et al., 2005; Saelens and Handy, 2008), safety from automobile traffic, and concerns about excessive noise, and personal safety and crime (Craig et al., 2002; Grow et al., 2008).\n\nSocio-demographics--age, sex, education, and income–strongly determine walking (Giles-Corti and Donovan, 2002). Desire to exercise, travel time and financial cost, perceptions of distance to destinations, and perceptions of safety along walking route may affect transport walking (Joh et al., 2011; Laatikainen et al., 2019; Ramezani et al., 2019; Van Dyck et al., 2011a; Van Dyck et al., 2009; Yang and Diez-Roux, 2017). (In this paper, we refer to the later as ‘self-assessed factors that affect decision to walk for transportation’.)\n\nCritical literature reviews on the effects of built environment on travel behaviors have noted the importance of self-selection bias (Cao et al., 2009; McCormack and Shiell, 2011; Mokhtarian and Cao, 2008; Mokhtarian and van Herick, 2016). Preferences for neighborhood choices or travel activities could partially determine residential location decisions (Khattak and Rodriguez, 2005; Li et al., 2019) and subsequently affect the propensity to walk (Bagley and Mokhtarian, 2002). Indeed, a number of studies found that residential preferences/travel attitudes explained part of the variation in transport walking (Cao, 2015; Cao et al., 2006; De Vos et al., 2012; Handy et al., 2006; Kajosaari et al., 2019). However, this literature has a number of limitations. First, many empirical studies did not have rich data for controlling this bias. Most studies proxied self-selection via a single domain for residential preferences (the reason for moving to/staying at the current neighborhood or hypothetical preference for a neighborhood type) (Cho and Rodriguez, 2014; Frank et al., 2007; Owen et al., 2007; Van Dyck et al., 2011b), or inferred self-selection via travel preferences/attitudes (Kajosaari et al., 2019; Van Dyck et al., 2009; Yang and Diez-Roux, 2017). A couple of studies had rich data on residential preferences and travel preferences/attitudes but transport walking was limited to shopping trips (Cao et al., 2006; Handy et al., 2006) and/or results had limited generalizability due to the research focusing on a limited geographic area (a single city or a single section of a state) (Cao et al., 2006; Handy et al., 2006; Kamruzzaman et al., 2016). Second, some studies have investigated the effects of dissonance/consonance between residential preferences and neighborhood characteristics on transport walking. However, most have focused on a single neighborhood feature (e.g. neighborhood walkability only (Frank et al., 2007; Kajosaari et al., 2019; Owen et al., 2007; Van Dyck et al., 2011b; Van Dyck et al., 2009)) or a generalized neighborhood type (such as urban and suburban neighborhoods (Cho and Rodriguez, 2014; De Vos et al., 2012)).\n\nMore work is warranted that can expand this important area of research. The current study will examine the associations between neighborhood environment and transport walking and will attempt to bridge the research gaps in the following ways. We will 1. examine multiple neighborhood domains (walkability, safety from crime, and aesthetics); 2. assess transport walking in a few ways (not limited to destination type); 3. adjust for a complex suite of personal factors (residential preferences, self-assessed factors that affect decision to walk for transportation, and sociodemographic characteristics); 4. investigate if the relationships between neighborhood characteristics and transport walking differs by walking attitude and residential preferences; 5. utilize a structural equation modeling approach that can test effects of neighborhoods on walking while simultaneously modeling multiple related pathways that determine residential location and walking; 6. apply the research to a large sample of residents in urbanized areas in multiple regions across the US.\n\n2. Methods\n\n2.1. Conceptual framework\n\nThis study aimed to (1) examine the associations of neighborhood characteristics with transport walking behaviors while accounting for residential preferences, self-assessed factors that affect the decision to walk for transportation, and sociodemographic characteristics; and (2) investigate if the relationships between neighborhood characteristics and transport walking differed by walking attitude and residential preferences accounting for a complex suite of personal factors.\n\nThe conceptual framework for this study is shown in . We assumed that socio-demographic characteristics influenced residential preferences, self-assessed factors, and neighborhood characteristics (Li et al., 2019; Liao et al., 2015), which all affected decisions to walk for transportation. The influence of socio-demographics is in part due to socio-demographic restrictions on where one lives, such as neighborhood affordability. We assumed that residential preferences had an antecedent influence on neighborhood characteristics. This causal direction is the prevailing assumption behind the residential self-selection bias arguments (Baar et al., 2015; Bagley and Mokhtarian, 2002; Cao et al., 2007; Van Dyck et al., 2009). Finally, we assumed that sociodemographic characteristics, self-assessed factors, residential preferences, and neighborhood characteristics all impacted transport walking behaviors.\n\n2.2. Data\n\nThe primary data source was the Community Survey (CS), a cross-sectional phone and mail survey of residents living in select areas of New York, Baltimore, Chicago, Los Angeles, St. Paul MN, and Winston Salem NC conducted during August 2011-May 2012 ( ). The primary purpose of the survey was to obtain information on the characteristics of neighborhoods which would subsequently be linked to a different cohort study (Echeverria et al., 2004; Mujahid et al., 2007). Census tracts were first selected in the cities/neighborhoods where the MESA cohort participants lived, and then a random list of residents was generated. The sampling goal was set as at least 10 participants per tract for the tracts where the MESA cohort participants resided. The inclusion criteria were participants were at least 18 years old and lived in the selected tracts. To encourage participation, residents in the selected tracts received advance letters about the research project; participants received $2 incentives for mail questionnaires, and $10 incentives for completed telephone interviews. A total of 4212 participants completed the survey either by mail or telephone, representing a 33.7% overall response rate. The distribution of participants per tract is: median 14 participants (Q1: 12, Q4: 25). The survey asked participants to report their sociodemographic information, self-assessed factors that affected their decision to walk for transportation, reasons for moving to/staying in their current neighborhoods, perception of their neighborhoods, and transport walking behaviors.\n\n2.3. Variables\n\nDue to the large number of variables considered, variables were grouped into sets numbered 0 to 5; the same numbering scheme is followed in all figures and tables.\n\n2.3.0. Sociodemographic characteristics\n\nSocio-demographic variables included age, gender, race/ethnicity, education, annual household income, and years lived in current neighborhood (See below). For annual household income, participants were asked to choose from eight categories with lowest category less than $8,000 and highest category $100,000 or more. Income was aggregated into four categories such that each had approximately 25% of the sample. Missing values for income were retained as a dummy category for analysis to preserve sample size and improve study power. For length of time living in current neighborhood, participants were asked to choose from six categories: less than 1 year, 1-4 years, 5-10 years, 11-15 years, 16-20 years, and more than 20 years.\n\nTable 1.\n\n0.

Self-assessed factors that affect decision to walk for transportation\n\nThe Community Survey included 10 statements about neighborhood and personal characteristics that may affect the decision to walk for transportation. For each statement, participants were asked to indicate the degree of importance (4-level ordinal scale, ranging from 1: “Not at all important” to 4: “Very important”). Principal Component Analysis (PCA) was used to identify items that should be grouped together to form scales. The threshold to retain items was a loading of at least 0.5 on only one scale. Ultimately, three scales were identified that utilized 9 survey questions. Scale 1 roughly represented importance of the ‘favorable walking environment and desire to get exercise’ (4 items, pleasant surroundings; neighbors/others walk; friends/family walk; desire to get exercise); Scale 2 termed as ‘trade-off between financial cost and time’ (2 items, the cost compared to other types of transportation; the time it takes compared to other types of transportation (inverse coded)); and Scale 3 roughly represented the importance of ‘safe sidewalk without heavy traffic’ (3 items, importance of safety along the walking route; presence of sidewalks; presence of heavy traffic (inverse coded)). Subsequently, each participant’s score was their mean response across items within a scale and verified decisions via Cronbach alpha coefficients (Tavakol and Dennick, 2011) (See Supplement Table 1 and table footnote). The substantive direction for Scale1 and Scale 3 was that higher value indicated higher level of importance. For Scale 2, higher value indicated financial cost was more important than time while low value indicated time was more important than financial cost.\n\n2.3.2. Residential preferences\n\nIn the present study, the term “residential preference” refers to reasons for moving to or staying in the current neighborhood. To assess residential preferences, the Community Survey contained 15 items regarding reasons to move to or stay in the current neighborhood (described in a prior work ). Participants were asked to indicate the degree of importance on a 5-point scale ranging from “Not at all important” to “Very important”. Similar to the method described in section 2.3.1 above, we used PCA to identify which survey items to combine into each scale. We then averaged the scores of each item within the group and verified decisions via Cronbach alpha coefficients (see footnote in Supplement Table 2; and details were described in a prior work). Two walkability preference scales were identified that utilized 11 survey questions. Scale 1 roughly represented a preference for “walkable & accessible neighborhoods” (7 items, easy to walk to places and easy access to urban amenities and shopping places); and Scale 2 roughly represented a preference for “safety from crime, auto-inviting, & attractive neighborhoods” (4 items, attractiveness, low crime, and easy access to highway, and convenient parking) (See Supplement Table 2 and footnote for PCA results). Subsequently, each participant’s scale was derived by averaging items that were grouped together based on the PCA. The substantive direction for the residential preference scales was that higher value indicated higher level of importance.\n\n2.3.3. Neighborhood characteristics\n\nNeighborhood characteristics were derived by aggregating community perceptions of neighborhood characteristics (rather than objective measures). To keep the terminology in the paper simple, we refer to these measures as “neighborhood characteristics”. Data on neighborhood characteristics came from survey questions that asked each participant about attributes of their “neighborhood”. The survey defined neighborhood as “the area within about a 20-minute walk or about 1-mile from your home”. Subsequently, participants’ answers were combined in such a way that they represented the community’s perception of the neighborhood environment rather than an individual’s perception of their environment. Below is a brief description of this method; details were reported in prior work (Echeverria et al., 2004; Mujahid et al., 2007). First, participants were asked to respond to 20 items about their neighborhood and to indicate the degree of agreement on a 5-point Likert style scale ranging from Strongly Disagree to Strongly Agree. Second, we used PCA to identify three scales utilizing 13 items to represent neighborhood walkability, safety from crime, and aesthetics, and verified decisions via Cronbach alpha coefficients (see Supplement Table 3 and footnote for PCA results). The threshold to retain items was a loading of at least 0.5 on only one scale. Third, for each participant, items within each scale were averaged (Mujahid et al., 2007). Fourth, scales for all participants’ living within a 1-mile area were averaged. Finally, participants were assigned the community average within a 1-mile buffer around their residence. Community averages were possible because there was a high density of Community Survey respondents within a 1-mile buffer: median 45 persons (Q1: 21, Q3: 96). By deriving a community average, each participant’s survey data were transformed into their community’s perception of the neighborhood (AKA community ‘assessment’ or community ‘rating’), thus avoiding same-source bias (Raudenbush and Sampson, 1999) (See discussion for strengths at Section 4.4 and limitations of this measure at Section 4.5). Population density within each participant’s 1-mile buffer neighborhood was derived from Census 2010 block data. For blocks that were partially contained within the buffer of each participant, the population was apportioned based on area in and out of the buffer.\n\n2.3.4. Primary outcomes: Transport walking variables\n\nTwo variables were derived to measure Community Survey participants’ transport walking behaviors.\n\n2.3.4.1. Total transport walking minutes per week\n\nTotal transport walking minutes per week was derived by multiplying responses to two questions that asked the number of days per week and number of minutes per day for transport walking. The variable was strongly right skewed so it was log-transformed for analysis.\n\n2.3.4.2. Unwilling to walk for transportation\n\nThe survey included four questions that asked what was the longest one-way trip (in minutes) that participants were willing to walk to four different destinations: work or school, grocery shopping, other shopping, and other errands. Participants chose from seven categories for each destination: 5 minutes, 10 minutes, 15 minutes, 20 minutes, 30 minutes, ‘I do not go to work/school/do grocery shopping’, ‘I am not willing to walk for work/school/shopping/ others’. We transformed the minutes into a continuous variable and assigned the last category as 0 minutes. As not all destinations were relevant for all participants, we used the maximum value of walking minutes (‘maximum minutes’) among the four destinations to represent the longest each participant would be willing to walk for transportation. In order to discriminate between walkers and non-walkers, we utilized the distribution of the data to define ‘unwilling to walk for transportation’ as maximum minutes < 15 minutes. This threshold represented the lowest 17th percentile of the sample distribution. Among those ‘unwilling to walk for transportation’, average walking minutes was much less than 15 minutes (see Results section 3.1).\n\n2.3.5. Walking attitude\n\nWalking attitude was derived from one survey statement ‘I like walking’. Participants were asked to indicate the degree of agreement on a 5-point Likert scale ranging from ‘Strongly Disagree’ to ‘Strongly Agree’. Favorable attitude toward walking was defined as “strongly agree” or “agree” and unfavorable was all other responses.\n\n2.4. Analytical sample\n\nThere were 4212 participants in the survey. We excluded a total of 1364 participants due to missing neighborhood characteristics (n = 7), residential preference scales (n = 105), sociodemographic covariates (n =404), transport walking (n = 723), walking attitude (n = 20), and self-assessed factors that affect decision to walk for transportation (n = 103). The final sample for analysis consisted of 2848 participants (1096 in Los Angeles; 318 in Chicago; 389 in Baltimore; 224 in St. Paul; 594 in New York; 227 in Winston Salem). The demographic characteristics of the participants in the final sample were similar to those in the excluded subset, except that excluded participants were slightly older, less likely to be White, had lower education and lower income. Nevertheless, participants who were retained were diverse in age, race/ethnicity, education and income, and roughly approximated the population of census areas from which they came (See Supplement Table 4).\n\n2.5. Statistical methods\n\n2.5.1. Structural equation modeling\n\nWe employed a structural equation modeling (SEM) approach (Baar et al., 2015; Bagley and Mokhtarian, 2002; Cao et al., 2007; Ewing et al., 2016; Lin et al., 2017; Silva, 2014) to test effects of neighborhoods on walking while simultaneously modeling multiple related pathways that determined residential location and walking ( ). As shown in , we determined sociodemographic variables as exogenous variables (similar to independent variables in a regression model) and set transport walking behaviors, neighborhood characteristics, residential preferences, and self-assessed factors that affected decision to walk for transportation as endogenous variables (See Supplement Table 5). In SEM an endogenous variable can be an explanatory variable in one equation and an outcome in another. In the diagram, an endogenous variable has arrows pointing to it, while an exogenous variable has no arrow pointing to it.\n\nThe SEM was implemented in M-plus 8.1 (Muthén and Muthén, 1998-2017). We used Maximum Likelihood Estimation with robust standard error (MLR) to estimate the model parameters as this estimation procedure is robust to non-normality in continuous outcomes (Raykov and Marcoulides, 2006) and can accommodate binary outcomes via logit regression (Feingold et al., 2019; Mitra and Saphores, 2019).\n\nGoodness-of-fit statistics were used to assess whether the structure of the model was appropriate for the data. The goodness-of-fit for a SEM depends on the degree of agreement between the model-implied covariance matrix and the covariance matrix of the observed data (Raykov and Marcoulides, 2006). If these two covariance matrices are close, then the model fits the data well. We employed a group of well-known fit indices to evaluate the model fit: Chi-square, χ2 /df ratio, Standardized Root Mean Square Residual (SRMR), Tucker-Lewis Index (TLI), Comparative Fit Index (CFI), and Root Mean Square Error of Approximation (RMSEA). For the linear model, we used these indices to evaluate the goodness-of-fit. For logistic regression, assessment of fit is more limited. Fit statistics available for the logit distribution regression are only −2LL, AIC, BIC; these have no external target value to indicate acceptable fit.

Effect modification\n\nWe tested whether the effect of neighborhood characteristics (walkability, safety from crime, aesthetic quality) on transport walking behaviors differed by subgroups: (a) favorable and unfavorable attitude toward walking and (b) stronger or weaker residential preferences. Testing heterogeneity of effects was done via nested model comparisons: a fully constrained model (all coefficients were the same across groups, the null hypothesis) was compared to an unconstrained model which allowed coefficients to be different across groups (sometimes referred to as ‘multiple-group analysis’). The Chi-square difference was then used to test whether the unconstrained model improved fit relative to the fully constrained model (Cheung and Rensvold, 2002). Nonsignificant Chi-square difference (p > 0.05) indicates the unconstrained model does not improve the fit and the coefficients across groups are not significantly different (Raykov and Marcoulides, 2006). For these analyses, residential preference variables were only tested if they had close conceptual alignment with the neighborhood characteristic (i.e., effect modification by residential preference for walkable & accessible neighborhoods was examined for neighborhood walkability, etc.). Each residential preference scale was categorized into two groups: stronger preferences defined as above median vs. weaker preferences defined as below median. We first constrained all coefficients across groups to be the same; then we unconstrained the coefficients for each of the neighborhood characteristics only.\n\n2.5.3. Scale and log interpretation\n\nTo aide interpretation of the survey scales, in some instances we converted the scale to percent of maximum possible score (POMP) by the following formula: 100*(raw – min) / (max – min). The primary justification for this is that the scales had different ranges (self-assessed factors that influence decision to walk for transportation ranged from 1 to 4, residential preferences ranged from 1 to 5, and neighborhood characteristics ranged from 1 to 5). To aide interpretation, the model beta coefficients will be back-transformed into percentage (Exp(β) *100 = percent).\n\n3. Results\n\n3.1. Descriptive statistics for sample characteristics\n\nshows the descriptive statistics of the study sample. The sample was 60% female, and on average were age 49 years (standard deviation [SD] = 17), had 14 years of education (SD = 3), and had $56,608 annual household income (SD = $36,653).\n\nRegarding self-assessed factors that were important when deciding to walk for transportation, most participants thought ‘safe sidewalk without heavy traffic’ was important (mean 3.15 [possible range 1 to 4], POMP 72%), followed by ‘favorable walking environment and desire to get exercise’ (mean 3.0, POMP 67%). Fewer participants rated ‘trade-off between financial cost and time’ as important (mean 2.35, POMP 45%).\n\nMost participants preferred to live in neighborhoods that were ‘safe from crime, auto-inviting, & attractive’ (mean 3.83 [possible range 1 to 5], POMP 71%); preference for ‘walkable & accessible’ neighborhoods was slightly lower (mean 3.32, POMP 58%).\n\nAs judged by their neighbors, participants tended to live in areas that were walkable and attractive (neighborhood walkability mean 3.68 [possible range 1 to 5], POMP 67%, and neighborhood aesthetic quality mean 3.58, POMP 65%). Neighborhood safety from crime was slightly lower (mean 3.25, POMP 56%). Participants lived in areas with high population density (median population density per square mile was 9631 (IQR = 11628)).\n\nSelf-reported weekly transport walking had a median of 75 minutes per week (interquartile range: 210 minutes) and most participants (85%) reported they ‘liked to walk’. Seventeen percent of participants were ‘unwilling to walk’ for transport for longer than 15 minutes to any destination. Among these, the median number of acceptable minutes they were willing to walk was 5 minutes vs. 17 minutes for the rest of the sample.\n\n3.2. Interpretation of standardized direct, indirect, and total effects for SEM results\n\nshows the standardized direct effects of neighborhood characteristics and person-level factors on total transport walking minutes per week (log scale, ) and the willingness to walk for transport (binary, logit scale, ), as estimated from the SEM. The SEM met criteria values indicating that the model fit the data well (e.g., SRMR and RMSEA < 0.05). shows the standardized direct, indirect, and total effects of neighborhood characteristics and person-level factors on transport walking. All effects were adjusted by sociodemographic characteristics. The standardized direct and total effects from the SEM including sociodemographic characteristics are shown in Supplement Table 6.\n\n3.2.1. Neighborhood characteristics and transport walking\n\nLiving in a neighborhood with better walkability was associated with more transport walking whereas better safety from crime was associated with less transport walking. Having one SD higher score on neighborhood walkability was associated with 27% more minutes of weekly transport walking (exp(β = 0.24), p < 0.01; although no association was observed with being unwilling to walk for transportation). An SD increase in the score of neighborhood safety from crime was associated with 75% fewer minutes of weekly transport walking (exp(β = −0.29), p < 0.001) and 16% higher odds of being unwilling to walk for transportation (OR 1.16, CI: 0.95 to 1.43, p = 0.18). Neighborhood aesthetic quality was not associated with weekly minutes of transport walking or being unwilling to walk for transportation.\n\n3.2.2. Associations of ‘residential preferences’ and ‘self-assessed factors’ with transport walking\n\nParticipants with stronger preference for living in a walkable neighborhood walked more for transportation and participants with stronger preference for safe from crime/auto inviting/attractive neighborhoods walked less. For example, having one SD stronger preference for walkable & accessible neighborhoods was associated with 77% more total transport walking minutes (exp(β = 0.57), p < 0.001) and 38% lower odds of being unwilling to walk for transportation (OR 0.62, 95% C.I. = 0.54, 0.71, p < 0.001). Having one SD stronger preference for safe, auto-inviting, & attractive neighborhoods was associated with 78% fewer total transport walking minutes (exp(β = −0.25), p < 0.001) and 43% higher odds of being unwilling to walk for transportation (OR = 1.43, 95% C.I. = 1.24, 1.65, p < 0.001). Indirect effects of residential preferences on total transport walking were small in magnitude but had the same direction as direct effects and were statistically significant for preference for walkable & accessible neighborhoods (β = 0.06, p < 0.001) and safe, auto-inviting, & attractive neighborhoods (β = −0.04, p < 0.001). Total effects were the sum of direct and indirect effects thus had the same direction as the direct effects.\n\nRegarding ‘self-assessed factors that affect decision to walk for transportation’, participants walked more if they assigned more importance to financial cost than time. For example, one SD increase in the scale of ‘trade-off between financial cost and time’ was associated with 25% more minutes of weekly transport walking (exp(β = 0.22), p < 0.001) and 17% lower odds of being unwilling to walk for transportation (OR = 0.83, 95% C.I. = 0.74, 0.93, p < 0.01). The importance of ‘favorable walking environment and desire to get exercise’ was associated with 12% lower odds of being unwilling to walk for transportation (OR = 0.88, 95% C.I. = 0.79, 0.99, p < 0.05) but no association was observed for weekly transport walking minutes. Importance of ‘safe sidewalk without heavy traffic’ was not associated with weekly transport walking minutes or being unwilling to walk for transportation.\n\n3.2.3. Associations between residential preferences and neighborhood characteristics\n\nThere was concordance between participants’ residential preferences and the qualities of the residential neighborhoods where they lived. Participants with stronger preference for walkable & accessible neighborhoods were more likely to live in a walkable neighborhood (neighborhood walkability β = 0.14, p < 0.001), and less likely to live in a safe neighborhood (neighborhood safety β = −0.09, p < 0.001). Participants with stronger preference for safe from crime/auto-inviting/attractive neighborhoods were inclined to live in safe and attractive neighborhoods (neighborhood safety β = 0.14, p < 0.001 and neighborhood aesthetic quality β = 0.09, p < 0.001).\n\n3.3. Differences of neighborhood effects by walking attitude and residential preferences\n\nChi-square tests for interactions are shown in Supplement Table 7 and stratified analyses are shown in Supplement Figure 1. There was no interaction between neighborhood characteristics and walking attitude or between neighborhood characteristics and residential preferences. However, there was an interaction between unfavorable walking attitude and neighborhood safety from crime (for total transport walking p = 0.002, and for unwilling to walk for transportation p=0.07) and between unfavorable walking attitude and neighborhood aesthetics (for total transport walking only, p=0.02). The association between neighborhood safety from crime and transport walking was attenuated for persons who had an unfavorable walking attitude.\n\n4. Discussion\n\nThe primary aim of this study was to examine associations of neighborhood characteristics with transport walking behaviors while accounting for residential preferences, self-assessed factors that affect decision to walk for transportation, and sociodemographic characteristics. While many previously observed associations between neighborhood characteristics and transport walking were also seen in this study, a novel finding in this study was that the associations persisted even after accounting for residential preferences and multiple other personal factors. As may be expected, residential preferences were also associated with transport walking, whereas they did not obviate the associations between neighborhood characteristics and transport walking. Regarding our secondary aim, there was no strong evidence showing that the effects of neighborhoods on transport walking differed by walking attitude or residential preferences.\n\n4.1. Neighborhood characteristics and transport walking\n\nEven after accounting for multiple personal-level factors including residential preferences, participants who lived in a more walkable environment engaged in more transport walking per week. Walkable neighborhoods with features like the presence of sidewalks, high residential density, high network connectivity, high accessibility to amenities, and mixed land use were found to encourage people to participate in more transport walking independent of residential preferences (Cao et al., 2007; Frank et al., 2007; Van Dyck et al., 2011b). Further, we found that the effect of neighborhood walkability on transport walking did not differ by whether participants’ liked walking. This result has important policy implications as it suggests that walkable neighborhoods can promote transport walking regardless of residents’ attitudes toward walking.\n\nParticipants who lived in a neighborhood with higher safety from crime had less transport walking per week. This result is inverse our hypothesis and does not align with findings reported in a few studies (Datar et al., 2013; Joh et al., 2011). However, a couple of studies have also reported this counter-intuitive result (Gauvin et al., 2008; Humpel et al., 2004). One potential explanation is that neighborhood safety is negatively correlated with higher population density and residents in areas with higher population density walk more for transportation (Handy et al., 2006). Although we adjusted for population density and for neighborhood walkability in our models, residual confounding cannot be ruled out (Foster and Giles-Corti, 2008).\n\n4.2. Differences of neighborhood effects by walking attitude and residential preferences\n\nIn general, our finding indicates that the effects of neighborhood characteristics on transport walking do not differ significantly by walking attitude or residential preferences. It suggests that neither walking attitude nor residential preferences explain or moderate the associations between neighborhood characteristics and transport walking. This finding accords with previous results showing that residential preferences are overridden by neighborhood locations in high density regions(Cho and Rodriguez, 2014; Van Dyck et al., 2011b). In contrast, it differs from findings in some studies suggesting that residential preferences have greater impact on transport walking (De Vos et al., 2012; Kajosaari et al., 2019). Such divergence may be due to different contextual characteristics in different countries as reported in a previous study (Kerr et al., 2016). More evidence on the moderating effects of residential preferences/walking attitude across various geographic contexts is needed to facilitate comparisons. Nevertheless, our finding highlights the importance of neighborhood characteristics in promoting transport walking for everyone regardless of their attitude toward walking or residential preferences.\n\n4.3. Residential preferences, self-assessed factors, and transport walking\n\nParticipants with stronger preference for walkable and accessible neighborhoods walked more for transport, whereas those with stronger preferences for safe/auto-inviting/attractive neighborhoods walked less for transport. These results are in line with prior work that reported positive correlations between preference for walkable neighborhoods and transport walking (Frank et al., 2007). Participants engaged in more transport walking if they assigned higher importance to the low cost of walking or lower importance of the time it took to walk. This result is in line with previous work that found people who were less concerned with travel time walked more (Bagley and Mokhtarian, 2002). Note that our results indicated that the self-assessment of safe sidewalks without heavy traffic for transport walking decisions was not associated with transport walking, which differed to some extent from a previous study showing that the presence of heavy traffic reduced walking to store (Cao et al., 2006). Such difference may be due to different purposes of transport walking, suggesting the need for improving nuanced understanding on the effects of personal factors on different subtypes of transport walking. Nevertheless, our findings are important because they suggest that if research fails to account for the direct pathways between residential preferences, and transport walking and between self-assessed factors and transport walking, then the effect of neighborhood factors on walking may be overestimated (Cao, 2015; Handy et al., 2006).\n\n4.4. Aggregating community perceptions/ratings of neighborhood conditions\n\nThis study used aggregated perceptions of neighborhood environment rather than objective measures to represent neighborhood characteristics. Aggregate community perceptions/ratings of neighborhood conditions have been used in several studies (Auchincloss et al., 2013; Lättman et al., 2016) and have many advantages. They can efficiently assess many different features of neighborhoods and can assess dimensions that are difficult -- if not impossible -- to measure using secondary data on commercial establishments or other GIS data. They can be deployed in many study sites in a standardized manner whereas GIS data can be difficult to standardize across sites. They are able to capture resource access, quality, usability, and community norms. For example, it is very hard to obtain information on neighborhood ‘noise’ (“There is a lot of noise in my neighborhood”) and whether walking is normative in the neighborhood (“I see other people walking in my neighborhood”). A strength of the current study was that neighborhood amenities were assessed by averaging responses for many people in the neighborhood (median of 45 respondents were in a 1-mile buffer). Thus, results were not likely systematically biased by the correlation between self-perceived community-level amenities and self-reported behaviors.\n\n4.5. Limitations\n\nThis study also has some limitations. First, we did not incorporate objective neighborhood characteristics. While perceived neighborhood measures have advantages, a potential weakness is that they can be difficult to describe and, in some circumstances, may be harder to translate the research findings into actionable urban planning policies. Besides, the neighborhoods were defined as “the area within about a 20-minute walk or about 1-mile from your home” by the survey questions. Empirical evidence indicates that the associations between built environment and travel behaviors may vary depending on various definitions of the spatial scales (Li et al., 2018; Perchoux et al., 2015). Future research can include both perceived and objective measures (Cao et al., 2006) and extend neighborhood boundaries from residential locations to activity spaces to provide more comprehensive measures (Kajosaari et al., 2019). Second, the scale measuring neighborhood safety from crime missed other safety issues like safety from traffic, which may bias the effects on transport walking (Foster and Giles-Corti, 2008). This may partially explain the counter-intuitive finding in our study regarding the association between neighborhood safety and transport walking. Third, we defined ‘unwillingness to walk for transportation’ using a cut-point that represented the lowest 17% of time that participants’ were willing to walk for transport (unwilling to walk more than 15 minutes to any destination). The definition of this variable was not perfect; however, it likely represented participants who were averse to walking for transport given that the median these participants were willing to walk was only 5 minutes.\n\n5. Conclusions\n\nThis study contributes to the literature in several ways. First, incorporating a complex suite of personal factors that are related to transport walking provides a deeper insight into residential self-selection effects. Second, disentangling the effects of multiple personal factors from neighborhood effects on transport walking with the aid of SEM supports the idea that it is essential to control for residential self-selection bias when examining neighborhood built/social determinants of transport walking. Finally, our findings highlight the importance of the spatial and social neighborhood environment on transport walking and suggest that while residential preferences and other personal characteristics are important factors, they do not obviate the neighborhood effects on transport walking. The policy implication is that developing walkable neighborhoods may promote transport walking which could have promising health benefits such as increasing population physical activity levels and reducing reliance on motorized vehicles.\n\n​\n\nNeighborhood effects on transport walking were examined by accounting for residential preferences, self-assessed factors that affect decision to walk for transportation, and sociodemographics\n\nNeighborhood characteristics had significant associations with transport walking, even after adjusting residential preferences and multiple other personal factors\n\nNeighborhood effects on transport walking did not differ by walking attitude or residential preferences\n\nWhile residential preferences and other personal factors are important, they do not obviate neighborhood effects on transport walking\n\nFootnotes\n\nDeclaration of interest: none\n\nPublisher's Disclaimer: This is a PDF file of an unedited manuscript that has been accepted for publication.
