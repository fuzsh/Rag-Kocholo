        "text": "Perfect Neighborhood: 8 Tips To Find it\n\nOne of the most important things you must take into account when shopping for a new home is the neighborhood you’ll be moving into. There are many things you must take into consideration when shopping for the perfect neighborhood. Most people spend more time outside of their homes that in them, including children and teenagers. We’ve put together a list of 8 helpful tips to help you find a new neighborhood that is perfect for your family, just to make sure you don’t miss any major points.\n\nDefine Your Perfect Neighborhood\n\nOne thing you always have to know is what you’re looking for. Different families have different needs, so the standards may vary. There are always basic things you want to check i.e. security, education and accessibility. However define what your family needs and what is important to you to get a clear picture of what the perfect neighborhood may be.\n\nDecide What Your Perfect Home Needs\n\nIn addition to the neighborhood you also want to visualize your perfect home. Do you like having meals outdoors? Hosting evening events? Or maybe you want a dog so you need a bigger backyard? All these things will help you define what your neighborhood needs to have. If you want your house to have a feature that neighborhood policies don’t accept it’s better to find out sooner rather than later.\n\nHistoric or Newly Settled?\n\nAlways keep in mind the age of your perfect neighborhood. Newly settled neighborhoods are more likely to be quiet and have the best infrastructure. Older neighborhoods usually have better public transport, are closer to schools, parks, supermarkets, medical centers and entertainment areas. It depends if you like new and quiet or historic and populated. More neighbors usually mean lesser chances of break-ins so you might want to keep that one in mind.\n\nChildren & Education\n\nFor families that have children, or are planning to have children this is a very big one. Always check school ratings for the areas you are planning to move into. If you’ve managed to narrow down your decision to two neighborhoods this may very well be the tie breaker.\n\nCrime Rates, Parks & Recreation\n\nYou obviously want to keep an eye out for crime rates and know how to read them. Don’t look a simple statistic and discard neighborhoods right away. The fact is that there is crime everywhere, so make sure serious crimes are not a big problem in that area and you’ll be alright. At the same time, you want to check how close parks and recreation areas are to your house if you like taking walks or bringing your kids to the part.\n\nTalk to Your Future Neighbors\n\nYou always want to talk to your immediate neighbors when you are shopping for a house. Not only will it build a relationship between you and your potential neighbors but it will show that you are about safety and becoming part of the community instead of simply moving in.\n\nHospitals & Healthcare\n\nIt’s important to have access to medical facilities and health clinics. Even if the nearest hospital or health clinic is not particularly close you at least want to make sure you know how to get there as quick as possible.\n\nShopping Centers & Entertainment\n\nAlthough this is not a major point you still want to know what shopping centers and entertainment areas are close to your house. It will give you a better picture of the traffic you will be experiencing, both vehicle and pedestrian.\n\nStay tuned for more information on tips for finding the perfect home.
