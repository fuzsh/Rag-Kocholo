It is not the same as a homeowners' association, you do not have to pay dues and you do not have to own a house to belong. Anyone who lives, works, or owns property in Citrus Heights can get involved.\n\nCitrus Heights is divided into 11 neighborhoods with 9 different neighborhood organizations representing each area, with areas 7, 8, and 9 being combined. Each neighborhood organization has its own board and members that meet on a regular basis to share ideas and work toward the betterment of the community."
