It was easy to feel comfortable hiring my neighbourâs daughter to watch my son after school.â - Patrick\n\nâThis year for Spring Cleaning, we wanted to sell old appliances, tools, clothing and electronics on Nextdoor Finds. In no time, our neighbours stopped by to make a deal and take things off our hands. It was easier than anything else, and it feels good knowing our old stuff has found a new home in the neighbourhood.â - Dan\n\nOUR PURPOSE\n\nAt Nextdoor, we believe that by bringing neighbours together, we can cultivate a kinder world where everyone has a neighbourhood they can rely on.\n\nYOUR PRIVACY\n\nNextdoor is a trusted environment where all neighbours are verified, making it safe to share online the kinds of things you'd be okay sharing with your neighbours in person.\n\nHere's how:\n\nâ¢ Every neighbour verifies their address\n\nâ¢ All members go by their real names, just like in person\n\nConnect with us:\n\nhttps://www.facebook.com/nextdoor\n\nhttps://twitter.com/nextdoor\n\nhttps://instagram.com/nextdoor\n\nContinued use of Location Services running in the background can dramatically decrease battery life.

But I doubt it. Since installing this app a couple of years ago. Iâve not been able to shut my account down. I have had hundreds of spam/fishing scam emails that I never used to get since installing this app. I have also had an increase in cold callers ringing my phone during my work hours and two attempts at accessing my bank account through digital transactions claiming to be the Apple App Store. A while ago I tested a theory and went onto the Nextdoor app and spent around 30 minutes just browsing all the hate racism and negativity thatâs posted on it. After leaving the app I opened my emails to find I had to log into my email account as it had flagged six failed attempted logins whilst I was in the app. Shortly after I received a notification of a failed charge to my iTunes account for Â£12:99. It was listed as an itinerary nes purchase. So I contacted Apple support who\n\nCould find no record of any charge to my account. I now have Apple investigating what data is shared and sold by the Nextdoor app. The charge to my account was not a one off. It has happened a number of times but I never realised it could have been linked to the app until I started to put 2 and 2 together and finally realised it was only happening when this app is active.\n\nDeveloper Response ,\n\nHi Stu, thanks for sharing your feedback. We'd love to learn more about what we can do to make your experience on Nextdoor better - please don't hesitate to update your review here with more info, or let us know directly by writing in, here: https://nxdr.co/apps. Thanks again!\n\nRp809 ,\n\nDisappointing and depressing to find out who you live amongst\n\nDonât think Iâve written an app review before, such is my disappointment with this app. I live in a nice area; I was hoping that it would be heartwarming to see how my community join together and a good way to get involved with the community or find people with similar interests but frankly wish I hadnât joined because Iâve discovered how sneery and judgemental some of my neighbours are at heart. The amount of neighbours who jump to conclusions and think the worst of people in our community are too widespread. It largely becomes a wingeing forum. Iâve mostly been just a passive observer but sometimes I pick people up on their comments and then itâs a pile-on to me. This also occurred when Iâve posted a question - the arrogant and demeaning replies left me feeling negative. Iâve not seen overtly racist comments. The for sale listings were fine (unlike in some other reviews) but you can get that functionality on other common platforms. I suppose the only positive was the lost and find- frequently lost bank cards or keys or pets finding their way back to their owner. All in all the negatives far outweigh the positives and made me sad that these are people I live amongst, so Iâve deleted the app and deactivated the account. Iâm feeling better already; I guess ignorance is bliss. Weâll just have to hope we donât lose bank cards or keys!\n\nDeveloper Response ,\n\nHi neighbour,\n\nThank you for your review.\n\nWe're sorry to hear about the negative posting in your area, along with posts that go against the guidelines. It's a real shame when this happens because we want the platform to be a useful and helpful tool to bring your community together.\n\nNextdoor do not moderate content centrally, with nearly three million neighbours we rely on neighbours and leads to report any violations to us directly.\n\nIf you do notice any violation of our Community Guidelines, you can either report content, report neighbour or get in touch with us directly here; Bit.ly/contactNextdoor and we promise to help you as soon as possible.\n\nHopefully we can help resolve any issues you are having and it would be great to see you give Nextdoor another try and connect with your neighbours!\n\nMollie, Nextdoor Support"
