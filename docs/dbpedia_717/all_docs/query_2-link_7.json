        "text": "2. Visit at different times\n\nThe neighborhood you think you’re moving into could be completely different in the evening or on weekends. If you live close enough to visit your prospective neighborhood often, check it out at different times to see what it's really like.\n\nYou may learn that every weekend, parents park their cars in front of your house while their child’s sports team practices nearby, or you may find that you have to fight traffic to get into your subdivision during rush hour. These are good things to know before you move.\n\n3. Check the area’s affordability\n\nOnce you know where you want to live, make sure you can afford it. The Living Wage Calculator can give you an overview of expenses such as food, transportation, and child care based on your location. You can also see which cities are the most affordable by reading our list of Cities with Low Living Costs.\n\nTo compare your current cost of living to other areas, check out CNN’s Cost of Living Calculator. The calculator shows how much money it takes to live a comparable lifestyle in another city and the difference in prices for groceries, utilities, and more.\n\nKeep in mind that state taxes can also take a big bite out of your income. Find out what the sales tax and income tax rates are before you move to a different state.\n\n4. Research the schools\n\nGood schools are a priority if you have children. For general information, including student/teacher ratios and enrollment statistics, go to the National Center for Education Statistics website.\n\nYou can get a more detailed look at local schools at Greatschools.org, where you’ll find parent and student reviews. The website also “grades” schools based on how well students perform.\n\nAfter you’ve done your online research, schedule a tour of the schools you’re considering. Some schools will put you in contact with other parents who can answer any additional questions you may have.\n\n5. Consider your commute\n\nIt doesn’t matter how much you love your new home if you can’t get to where you need to go without pulling your hair out. Before you commit to an area, use an online map, like Google Maps, to check real-time traffic flow along your commute during peak hours. Most online maps will also have an option that shows public transit routes, including stops.\n\nIf you’d rather walk where you’re going, visit WalkScore.com. The website rates communities’ walkability based on a score up to 100. You’ll also find a bike score there as well as information on public transportation.\n\nAre you a bicycle commuter?\n\nIf you’d rather ride your bike to work than drive, walk, or take public transport, you might be interested in our guide to cities with the most bicycle commuters. In the article, we also talk about bike safety laws in different cities.\n\n6. Get the lowdown on crime statistics\n\nNobody wants to live in an area where there’s rampant crime. The easiest way to learn about local crime is to Google search for crime reports in your area. You can also use Safewise's Safest Cities in America report to narrow down your neighborhood.\n\nWhen you know where you’re moving, you can stop by the local police station to discuss any specific concerns you have."
