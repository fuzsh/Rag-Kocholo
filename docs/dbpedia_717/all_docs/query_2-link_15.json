        "text": "Is Your Neighborhood Safe? 7 Tools to Help You Find Out\n\nBy Katie McEntire\n\n7 min read\n\nSafeWise experts have years of firsthand experience testing the products we recommend. Learn how we test and review.\n\nHere are 7 tools to help you research the safety of your neighborhood\n\n: Best for state-wide research\n\n: Best for a holistic picture of safety\n\n: Best neighbor-to-neighbor app\n\n: Best for avoiding sex offenders\n\n: Most user-friendly tool\n\n: Best for making your family safer\n\n: Best for exploring new neighborhoods\n\nProtect your property\n\nSign up for our weekly newsletter to get the latest deals, home security tips, and in-depth reviews.\n\nBy signing up, you agree to our Terms and Conditions and Privacy Policy.\n\nBefore you research, consider bias\n\nSafety is subjective. What you consider a \"safe\" neighborhood, someone else may not. We chose a range of tools to include the different dimensions of neighborhood safety. From crime reports to school ratings, safety is a complicated, multi-layered concept.\n\nWhile reading this article, consider how you use neighborhood safety tools. Are you using them to build or divide your community? When you find problems, look for solutions. Remember that community safety comes from putting in work.\n\nBiases against race, sex, and class aren't always easy to spot, especially in ourselves. So it's important not to make assumptions about a those you don't recognize in your neighborhood.\n\nThere's more to neighborhood safety than crime statistics\n\nCrime is just one piece of the puzzle that makes a neighborhood safe. And many statistics are subject to what police and law enforcement report to federal institutions like the FBI and Bureau of Justice. Crime statistics like these also rely on citizens reporting crimes, and not all crimes or scary incidents are reported and tracked.\n\nThe elements listed below can make a neighborhood safer, but aren't usually included in municipal reports.\n\nAmple street lighting\n\nSafe sidewalks and bike lanes\n\nAccessible emergency and fire services\n\nFire hydrants that are close to homes\n\nActive, well-funded schools\n\nAccess to medical care\n\nClean parks\n\nAnd there are plenty of ways to make a neighborhood safer. Here are some neighborhood safety tips.\n\nFind safety and security resources where you live\n\nAlabama\n\nAlaska\n\nArizona\n\nArkansas\n\nCalifornia\n\nColorado\n\nConnecticut\n\nDelaware\n\nFlorida\n\nGeorgia\n\nHawaii\n\nIdaho\n\nIllinois\n\nIndiana\n\nIowa\n\nKansas\n\nKentucky\n\nLouisiana\n\nMaine\n\nMaryland\n\nMassachusetts\n\nMichigan\n\nMinnesota\n\nMississippi\n\nMissouri\n\nMontana\n\nNebraska\n\nNevada\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nNew Jersey\n\nNew Mexico\n\nNew York\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nOhio\n\nOklahoma\n\nOregon\n\nPennsylvania\n\nRhode Island\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nTennessee\n\nTexas\n\nUtah\n\nVermont\n\nVirginia\n\nWashington\n\nWest Virginia\n\nWisconsin\n\nWyoming\n\nNeighborhood research tools\n\nAlong with these safety resources, apps like NextDoor and Ring's Neighbors app serve as neighborhood noticeboards for lost and found items, community questions, and even classified listings.\n\nBuild an A-team\n\nLearn more about community-building in our piece about staying safe in your neighborhood.\n\n1. FBI Crime Data Explorer: Best for state-wide research\n\nImage: SafeWise\n\nThe Federal Bureau of Investigation Crime Data Explorer compiles crime reports from all over the country. While the tool doesn’t portray crime mapping by address, you can find crime data for your state, your city, or a location you might want to move to in the future. The data is divided by crime type, including violent crime, hate crime, property crime, and arrests.\n\nIf you love data and charts, this is an easy website to get lost in. The FBI provides methodologies for its reporting and includes stats on anything from hate crimes to property damage.\n\nWhere people feel safest in the U.S.\n\nIs your state on the list? Check out our report The State of Safety in America.\n\n2. AreaVibes: Best for a holistic picture of safety\n\nImage: SafeWise\n\nAreaVibes provides crime maps and details about property crime and violent crime, but it also scores communities on other factors such as cost of living, education, health, housing, and amenities. Based on the statistics in that area, towns are given an F to A+ score.\n\nWe love this tool because it takes a more zoomed-out approach to \"neighborhood safety.\" If you're focused on crime, you can check out a breakdown that includes the numbers of violent and property crimes reported, along with a heatmap of areas where incidents were reported.\n\nIf you're interested in seeing how your neighborhood ranks on other factors, you can dive into similar statistics for livability.\n\n3. Ring's Neighbors App: Best neighbor-to-neighbor app\n\nRing Video Doorbell\n\nStarting from\n\n$99.99\n\n*Amazon.com list price as of post date (MT). Read full disclaimer.\n\nThe Neighbors App by Ring (known for its Ring doorbell cameras and Ring Alarm home security system) aims to be an online neighborhood watch program. You don’t have to be a Ring customer to use the app. It’s free to download and use no matter what security system or devices you own.\n\nNeighbors uses reports by people in your neighborhood and local law enforcement to alert you to suspicious activities and crime events in your area. You can also anonymously contribute your tips.\n\nNeighbors isn’t just a neighborhood crime app, though. Some neighborhoods use the app to band together and keep safe during natural disasters or organize neighborhood watches. You can also submit or look for information on lost pets.\n\nUse Ring Pet Tag with Neighbors App!\n\nThe Ring Pet Tag attaches to your pet's collar and has a unique QR code that connects to the Neighbors app. If your fur baby escapes, anyone who finds them can contact you using that QR code. The code reveals your pet's profile, which includes things like their name, owner, and how to contact you.\n\n4. Family Watchdog: Best for avoiding sex offenders\n\nImage: SafeWise\n\nFamily Watchdog maps the addresses of registered sex offenders in your neighborhood or near your child’s school. Just type a location or address into the website’s search box, and Family Watchdog generates a map pinpointing the address of nearby registered sex offenders. If you’re looking for a specific individual, you can search for them by name.\n\nColor-coded icons correspond to various sex crimes, including crimes against children, sexual battery, and rape. Click the icon, and you’ll see a picture of the offender, learn their aliases, and find out what sex crime they’ve been convicted of.\n\nYou can sign up for alerts whenever a registered sex offender moves in or out of your neighborhood through the website. In addition to detailed information about offenders, this online tool offers personal safety tips, facts about sexual abuse, and a comprehensive blog and newsletter.\n\nFamily Watchdog is a free service, but you’ll be sent off-site to a subscription service if you want detailed background reports about any offenders.\n\nImage: SafeWise\n\n5. SpotCrime: Most user-friendly tool\n\nImage: SafeWise\n\nSpotCrime maps crimes on-site and delivers crime alerts to your email. It gathers data from more than just law enforcement agencies. It also collects information from news reports and user tips. You can even see a list of missing persons, crime stats, and cold cases in your area.\n\nOne of SpotCrime's best features is how user-friendly and highly visual it is, giving you a quick look at crime information in your neighborhood. Crimes are represented by icons that make it easy to see what activity takes place in your neighborhood.\n\nWhen you click on an icon, you get the crime title, when and where it took place, and a link that directs you to the source where the data came from.\n\n6. Life360: Best for making your family safer\n\nScreenshots: SafeWise\n\nLife360 is a phone app with heaps of safety features for your entire family. From location services and check-in features for the kids to digital safety features that cover ID theft, data breaches, and credit monitoring, it does a great job of rolling multiple services into one giant app.\n\nWhile a free plan is available, you'll need a subscription to get the most out of it. The free plan includes crash detection and an SOS button for anyone in your circle. But the good stuff starts at around $14.99/month.\n\nLife360's Gold and Platinum plans include features like a free Tile tracker, driver safety reports, towing services, and localized crime reports.\n\n#7. Ozzi: Best for traveling to new neighborhoods\n\nHonorable mention: Anjel Tech body camera app\n\nIf you're concerned with violence in your neighborhood affecting you or your family, check out Anjel Tech. This bodycam app uses your phone's camera to livestream an incident and alert loved ones as soon as you press the button. So whether you're nervous during a traffic stop or encounter a threat in public, you can share the whole thing as it happens.\n\nLearn more in our interview with Anjel Tech founder James Samuel.\n\nHow to prevent break-ins\n\nWherever you live, feeling safe in your home can bring greater peace of mind and happiness. Check out our home security checklist to make sure your home is as protected as possible.\n\nYou may also want to consider a monitored home security system or security cameras to help protect your loved ones and valuables. Just seeing a security camera or home security sign or sticker can deter a would-be intruder. And monitored systems can call for law enforcement if a break-in does occur.\n\nAffordable DIY home security\n\nSimpliSafe home security\n\n4.25\n\nMonitoring starts at\n\n$19.99\n\n/mo\n\nNo contracts\n\nDIY installation\n\nGood for renters\n\nInfo current as of post date.

Some systems can be armed from an app or put on an arming schedule to make things easier.\n\nPlacement: Place cameras so they get a good view of doorways and windows.\n\nSensors: Be sure to install window and door sensors throughout your home, not just at the front door. No matter where the intruder enters, you want the alarm to sound and scare them away.\n\nSecurity signs: Place yard signs and window stickers prominently so they will catch the attention of potential intruders.\n\nFor more, check out our burglary prevention guide and our guide to outsmarting burglars.\n\nBest home security systems\n\nPlay Video\n\nSubscribe to our YouTube channel and learn how to protect your home, loved ones, and belongings.\n\nCompare the best home security systems\n\nBrand\n\nInstallation\n\nMonthly cost\n\nBest for\n\nStarter equipment price\n\nContract required\n\nSmart home compatibility\n\nLearn more\n\nProfessional$29.99/mo.Best professional home security$599.00No *Amazon,\n\nGoogle,\n\nZ-WaveView packagesProfessional$28.99/mo.Most trusted security brand$0.00YesAmazon,\n\nGoogle,\n\nZ-WaveView packagesDIY or Pro$17.99/mo.Best customer ratingQuote required\n\nOnline quizNo *Amazon, GoogleView packagesDIY$20.00/moBest budget-friendly pick$199.99NoAmazon, Google, Z-WaveView on AmazonDIY or Pro$19.99/mo.Best DIY home security$245.00NoAmazon,\n\nGoogleView packages\n\nInfo current as of post date.
