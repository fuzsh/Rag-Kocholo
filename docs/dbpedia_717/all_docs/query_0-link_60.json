        "text": "PRIVATE WALKING TOUR | 3 hours | 110 € | Discover Sarajevo with a local private guide. The multi-ethnic city of Sarajevo is a treasure trove of historical sites. There are a lot of unique places you will visit on this 3-hour walking tour. The three events which are most commonly associated with the capital of Bosnia and Herzegovina are:\n\nthe start of WWI with the assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand and his wife Sophie in 1914,\n\nhosting the Winter Olympics in1984, and\n\nthe siege in the mid-90s during the Bosnian war (1992 - 1995).\n\nFor centuries Sarajevo is also known for its coexistence of different religions whose monuments and churches we will visit on this city tour. The fact is that within a city block of 300 meters, you can find a Mosque, an Orthodox church, a Catholic church, and a Synagogue.\n\nIn the famous Bascarsija - Sarajevo's old bazaar and the historical and cultural centre of the city, built in the 15th century, you can drink tap water from the famous Sebilj and try unique Bosnian coffee called 'kahva'.\n\nPicturesque neighbourhood Alifakovac with a beautiful cemetery is one of the oldest urban settlements in Sarajevo. Many painters, photographers, and writers were inspired by this wonderful place.\n\nVisiting Sarajevo means witnessing the greatest sorrow and success of modern civilization. Sarajevo is a city in which people keep coming back. A magnificent bastion of multicultural gloss.\n\nFor those who are more interested in experiencing Sarajevo's surrounding mountains, we recommend our hiking excursion: Skakavac Waterfall Hike\n\nRecommended accommodation: Guesthouse Kandilj\n\nJust some of the highlights of this tour\n\nBascarsija – this part of the city was founded in1462 when the Ottomans established the Bosnian Sanjak. The first bey was the Isa-beg Isakovic, who constructed an inn and several shops on the north bank of the Miljacka River. In time, the number of inns and shops increased in this part of Sarajevo, and the Bascarsija expanded. In the 16th century, there were 80 different crafts and over 12.000 shops. Although the Bascarsija decreased in size, it has retained its authenticity for more than 600 years. Bascarsija is a significant part of Sarajevo's identity, a tourist attraction with many traditional meat, pie and kebab shops (burek & cevapcici!), patisseries and traditional restaurants that offer specialities from Bosnia and Herzegovina.\n\nOld Orthodox Church, located in the Old Town of Sarajevo, is one of the oldest and most valuable cultural, historical and architectural monuments of Sarajevo and one of the oldest religious buildings in the area. It was first mentioned in Ottoman sources dating to 1539, but it is assumed that it was built on the foundations of an even older church. Its interior is a treasury of extraordinary examples of wood and stonemason craft and the art of icon painting. The belfry was added in 1883 and reconstructed in 1960 when it gained its current appearance. Inside the church is a museum with a valuable collection of icons from the 13th to 19th century, numerous manuscripts, and liturgical and artistic exhibits.\n\nGhazi Husrev Bey’s Mosque is one of the most significant religious monuments of Islamic architecture in the Balkans, built-in 1530. The mosque was designed by Adzem Esir Ali from Tibris, one of the greatest architects of Istanbul, and built by masters from Dubrovnik, then very famous for their building skills. It became one of the symbols of great importance for the urban development of Sarajevo and the first mosque in the world that received electric lighting in 1898.\n\nFranciscan Church of Saint Anthony of Padua is a Roman Catholic church that, along with the adjoining Franciscan monastery, became a national monument of Bosnia and Herzegovina. After several Catholic churches were built from 1697 – 1881 in this place, the last one, an example of Gothic Revival architecture, was built in 1912, designed by Josip Vancaš. Unique among the numerous churches in Sarajevo, the Church of Saint Anthony of Padua claims to be the \"church of all Sarajevans\", boasting regular Muslim and Eastern Orthodox attendees.\n\nThe Old Jewish Temple - also known as the Old Synagogue and the Great Temple (Il Kal Grandi), is the oldest place of worship for Jews in Sarajevo. It was built in the 16th century in the city's part called Velika Avlija, a small Jewish neighbourhood in Sarajevo’s Bascarsija. After several fires, the temple’s current appearance dates from 1813. In 1966 it became the Jewish Museum of Bosnia and Herzegovina and an annexe of the Museum of Sarajevo, representing the great exhibitions of Jewish history in Sarajevo and Bosnia through the centuries. The Old Jewish Temple became a national monument of Bosnia and Herzegovina in 2003."
