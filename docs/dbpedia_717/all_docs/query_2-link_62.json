        "text": "Perhaps the biggest difference is the layout and atmosphere. As the name suggests, a small house neighborhood consists of individual houses, with a maximum of 12 elders living in each house.\n\nThe houses themselves have a similar layout to a traditional residential house, with a modern kitchen, spacious living area, a separate den/rehabilitation area, and private suites with private bathrooms for each elder.\n\nNursing homes, on the other hand, are usually laid out in a more institutional manner, with more separation between different areas. Residents’ suites are often shared by more than one resident and are grouped together in one concentrated area, such as a hallway. Likewise, common areas are shared by many residents at a time, and the kitchen and food preparation area is off-limits to residents and visitors.\n\nThere are other differences besides just the physical layout, though. Philosophy of care, decision making, and staffing are just a few. Download our free guide, “Small House… Big Difference,” to learn more."
