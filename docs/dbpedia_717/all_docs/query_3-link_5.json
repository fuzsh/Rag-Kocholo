        "text": "If you’re searching for a new apartment, one of your top concerns should be the neighborhood in which it’s located. While you’ll definitely need to think about the size of the apartment, as well as its layout, aesthetics, and amenities, the neighborhood will come to define how you live, how you travel to and from your apartment, and more.\n\nSo, what makes a neighborhood “ideal,” and what features should you be looking for?\n\nThe Role of Subjective Choice\n\nThe “perfect” neighborhood doesn’t exist, and for a very simple reason: people have different preferences. To some, the perfect neighborhood is one where all the homes are close together, so neighbors can see each other, interact with each other, and build a community together. To others, the perfect neighborhood is one where the homes are spread apart, so you can have more privacy and solitude. While there are some general features that most people agree on (for example, low crime rates are better than high crime rates), you should understand that much of your decision will be based on your personal preferences.\n\nThat said, we’ve assembled a list of priorities and factors most important to consider for your decision.\n\nLocation\n\nFirst, you’ll need to consider the overall location of the neighborhood. Is this close to where you work, or close to where you want to go to school? Is it close enough to the city that you can get there with a short drive, but far enough away that you don’t have to deal with issues related to the city? This is one of those variables that means different things to different people, so make sure you consider the location carefully.\n\nAccessibility and Walkability\n\nHow easy is it to get to this neighborhood? For example, are there public transportation access points nearby? What about the roads—does this neighborhood have a multitude of well-maintained roads nearby? Is it close to a highway so you can get where you’re going faster? An accessible neighborhood can make your life easier in many ways.\n\nSimilarly, how walkable is this neighborhood? Are there plenty of well-maintained sidewalks you can use for exercise or transportation? Are they well-lit at night, and protected from traffic?\n\nCrime Rates\n\nCrime rates are a variable that just about everyone can agree on. The lower the crime rate in a given neighborhood, the better. No neighborhood is exempt from crime, so even a near-perfect track record doesn’t mean you’re 100 percent safe; however, you’ll rest much easier at night knowing you’re in a well-protected neighborhood. Make sure you look up both overall crime statistics and violent crime statistics, as they may differ.\n\nSchool Districts\n\nIf you have children, you’ll definitely want to think about the schools associated with this neighborhood. Different schools can provide very different opportunities for your kids; if they get a good education, they’ll be much better equipped to live a productive, happy life. Of course, even if you don’t have kids, you’ll want to think about school districts. Good school districts tend to attract attentive, responsible parents, and tend to positively influence property values at the same time.\n\nOutdoor Activities\n\nWhat kinds of outdoor activities are available in this neighborhood? Depending on your personality, you may thrive on time spent outdoors. For example, is there a playground where your children can release some energy and meet and play with other neighborhood kids? Is there a walkable trail where you can run, walk, or bike for some exercise? Is there a wooded area or a nature reserve nearby? Is there a community pool you’ll have access to?\n\nPopulation Density\n\nYou’ll also want to think about the population density of this neighborhood. For some people, high population density is a good thing; it means you’ll never feel lonely, and you’ll have plenty of opportunities to interact with your neighbors. It can also make the neighborhood feel cozier and more alive. By contrast, a low population density can also be favorable to some; they may prefer more personal space and the perception of greater privacy.\n\nAesthetics\n\nNext, consider the aesthetics of the neighborhood, including the types of homes available there. This is largely a question of personal taste; some people love the polished, sleek look of modern architecture, while others prefer the unique nature of older homes. Walk or drive through the neighborhood and consider how you feel when you look around; is this a place that feels like home?\n\nAmenities\n\nIf you’re moving into an apartment community, you’ll also need to consider the amenities available to you. What kinds of perks or bonuses are available to the people who live here? Is there a park, dog park, community pool, or a fitness center to which you’ll have access?\n\nNearby Businesses\n\nThink about the types of businesses that exist in and around your neighborhood. For example:\n\nRestaurants. Are there places to go out to eat? Can you see yourself becoming a regular at any of these restaurants?\n\nBars and clubs. What’s the nightlife like? Are there opportunities to socialize with other people?\n\nGyms.Are there gyms or fitness centers nearby to help you stay in shape?\n\nShopping.What kinds of shopping options are available? Are you able to get to a grocery store quickly for some last-minute supplies? What about department stores and other types of stores? Are there convenient options in driving distance?\n\nFuture Value\n\nFinally, carefully consider the long-term prospects of this neighborhood. Does it look like this neighborhood is going to become more popular in the next several years? Will there be more job opportunities and better amenities on the horizon?"
