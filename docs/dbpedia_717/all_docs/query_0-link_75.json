        "text": "Alifakovac Neighborhood in Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina, Bosnia\n\n0 0\n\nrank #2 ·\n\nAlifakovac is a neighborhood in Babića bašća local community, municipality of Stari Grad, Sarajevo. As one of the oldest urban settlements in Sarajevo, it is situated on the spine of the northern end of the slope Trebević, on the lowest hill in the row at the last meander of Miljacka, before it pours out of its narrow canyon. Ever since people settled this part of land roads to Tsargrad, across the Kozja ćuprija, went through it. An abandoned village by the road was found in the 15th century by the Ottomans when they conquered Bosnia. It is believed that there was a smaller necropolis of stećci, which with the arrival of Ottomans became again an active cemetery. Today it is one of the biggest and most beautiful cemeteries in Sarajevo.\n\nBabića bašća Place in Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina, Bosnia and Herzegovina\n\n0 0\n\nrank #3 ·\n\nBabića bašča (Babić's garden) is a local community within the municipality of Stari Grad, Sarajevo. It's one of the oldest neighborhoods in the city of Sarajevo. It derives its name from a garden that was the property of a certain Babić family, and it was located in a street that now has the same name as the local community. The reason why it's named after a garden is that because almost all houses had gardens in their courtyards and in summer, many people who traveled through Sarajevo in the past, described Sarajevo as a green oasis surrounded by hills, making those gardens something as a symbol of the city. The street and old cemetery Alifakovac is located here and therefore the neighborhood is locally and throughout the city known as Alifakovac. It borders the local communities of Baščaršija, Vratnik and Mošćanica to the north, Hrid – Jarčedoli to the south, Bistrik to the west and the Entity of Republika Srpska to the east. The local community counts a population of 1,496."
