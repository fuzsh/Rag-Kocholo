If you open Google maps and search \"Pekara Sarajevo\" (pekara is the Bosnian word for bakery), you'll be confronted with a sea of red pins, and these are just the ones registered with Google - many aren't. I would say that you haven't really been to Bosnia and Herzegovina if you don't eat at least one thing from a bakery there at least on one occassion.\n\nBosnian bakeries have a range of baked goods. If you've got the appetite, you'll want to at least try all of the types of pita/burkek (except the meat one if you are vegetarian), kifle, and freshly baked somun, a traditional Bosnian flat bread. Watch a short video which includes a section on somun bread here to learn more about it."
