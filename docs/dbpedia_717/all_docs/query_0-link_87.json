        "text": "6.8K\n\nI’ve never been to Sarajevo, so last week I’ve been doing my homework to find out what’s interesting to see over there, which are the best places to eat traditional food and how to get to the “soul” of Bosnia & Herzegovina capital town. So far I understood that to get a sense of the spirit enlivening Sarajevo you should visit it adopting the sabur lifestyle; sabur means to live with patience, calmness and hush. So, even if I did draw few itineraries, I guess I will be mostly taking my time slowly drinking Turkish coffee in some traditional place, wandering around timeless alleys from Ottoman or Austro-Hungarian ages, visiting the multitude of Mosques, Synagogues and Churches that made Sarajevo earn the epithet of “Jerusalem of Europe” and enjoying a panoramic view whenever there will be the occasion to (as I read that you will see a new kind of beauty in this city if you admire it from above).\n\nI want to thank all my Bosnian friends for the endless emails and for answering to all my questions.\n\nAnd, by the way, I’m still open to more suggestions, so don’t be shy and let me know what do you like to do in Sarajevo! :-)\n\n31st of December:\n\nI will arrive at Sarajevo Airport around 3pm. I booked a hotel in Baščaršija, the central neighbourhood with a Turkish atmosphere, so I will start my sightseeing from there, heading towards the Tourist Information Centre to get as many maps and brochures I can! From there I will go visit the Gazi Husrev Bey Mosque and shop at the indoor bazaar. Then, wandering around Baščaršija characteristic alleys, I will reach Željo Restaurant to eat the best ćevapi in town and enjoy more traditional food. At the moment I don’t have any special plans for NYE, so I guess after dinner I will just have a walk to admire the Baščaršija Mosque and the OldOrthodox Church by night and come back to the hotel to write and most of all to rest!\n\nTourist Information Center (Sarači 58)\n\nThe Gazi Husrev-bey Mosque (Sarači 8)\n\nGazi Husrev Bey’s Market\n\nŽeljo Restaurant (Kundurdžiluk 17)\n\nBaščaršija Mosque (Bravadžiluk)\n\nOld Orthodox Church (Mula Mustafa Bašeskije)\n\n1st of January:\n\nI expect many places to be closed for holiday, thus on 1st of January I will go to public places, graffiti areas and buildings I’m interested to see only from the outside. I will start the day with a coffee at legendary Zlatna Ribica (or -if it’s closed- I will go at the panoramic cafeteria at the last floor of the Hotel Hecco Deluxe), then I will go graffiti hunting around the Youth Theatre and I will walk along Maršala Tita Street until the Alipašina Mosque, stopping to admire the National Bank building, the The Building of the BiH Presidency, the Eternal Flame and to drink a coffee at the Austro-Hungarian cafeteria Imperijal. I will look for more graffiti at the HastaHana Skate Park and reach the river from where I will start a panoramic walk admiring Sarajevo bridges, but not before drinking one last coffee at the Art Gallery/Café Boris Smoje.\n\nZlatna Ribica (Kaptol, 5)\n\nHotel Hecco Deluxe (Ferhadija 2)\n\nThe Sarajevo Youth Theatre (Kulovica 8)\n\nThe Building of the BiH Presidency (Maršala Tita 16)\n\nNational Bank (Maršala Tita, 25)\n\nMinistry of Finance and Eternal Flame (Maršala Tita, 62)\n\nImperijal (Maršala Tita, 56)\n\nAlipašina Mosque\n\nHastaHana Skate Park\n\nGallery and Cafeteria Boris Smoje (Radiceva 11)\n\nBridges:\n\nFestina Lente (designed by three students from the Arts Academy next to the bridge)\n\nSkenderija bridge (supposedly designed by Gustav Eiffel)\n\nArs Aevi bridge (the one designed and financed by Renzo Piano)\n\nRimski most\n\nLatinska Cuprija (Latin bridge)\n\nSeher-Cehajina Cuprija\n\nCozja Cuprija (the Goat’s bridge)\n\nFor lunch I will get the best Pita in Sarajevo at the restaurant Buregdzinica Bosna, and then I will admire the nearby beauties of the Austro-Hungarian heritage along the river, first of all the Vijecnica (National Library). After a coffee at the Baghdad Cafè I will walk through Stari Grad (the old town) to see the church Sv. Ante Padovanskog (Franjevacka), the Hadzijska Dzamija and the Careva Dzamija (the Emperor’s Mosque). On the way there is also a cool place for a beer-stop: the amazing wooden pub Pivnica HS close to the Sarajevska Pivara (Bosnian brewing company). And I will say goodbye to this wonderful first day of the year from the panoramic terrace of Park Prinčeva!\n\nBuregdzinica Bosna (Bravadziluk)\n\nVijecnica (Obala Kulina bana)\n\nBaghdad Cafè (Bazardzani 2)\n\nSv.

Then I guess I will spend the whole day in Skenderija, visiting its many art galleries and art museums. In the evening I will go visit the Jewish Cemetery (the second largest Jewish cemetery in Europe, after the one in Prague –which I found breathtaking!) and admire the sunset from the Vraca Memorial Park.\n\nAshkenazi Synagogue (Hamdije Kreševljakovića 59)\n\nShatro Graffiti Shop (Hamdije Kreševljakovića 61)\n\nGalerija Paleta (Hamdije Kreševljakovića 13)\n\nGlavna Posta – General Post Office (Čobanija most)\n\nPravni Fakultet (Obala Kulina Bana 7)\n\nAcademy of Fine Arts (Obala Maka Dizdara 3)\n\nCharlama Depot Art Gallery (Terezije bb – inside the shopping centre)\n\nContemporary Arts Museum Ars Aevi (Terezije bb)\n\nGradska galerija Collegium Artisticum (Terezije bb)\n\nJewish Cemetery (Kovačići)\n\nVraca Memorial Park\n\n3rd of January:\n\nAfter a cup of tea at the Tea House “Franz & Sophie”, I will go visit the Bosniak Institute, the Katedrala and the Sephardic Synagogue with its Jewish Museum. Wandering around the fancy neighbourhood of Ferhadija I will find the huge chessboard, the “multicultural man” (a statue to peace) and keep wandering looking for an abandoned synagogue on the hill behind Ferhadija. Then I will go visit the Ortodox Cathedral, check the upcoming events at the Art Cinema Kriterion (maybe there is something interesting for the next days!) and the current exhibitions at the Umjetnicka Galerija (National Gallery). If during the day I’d be hungry, I can grab something to eat at the main city market Markale nearby.\n\nFranz & Sophie (Petrakijina 6)\n\nBosniak Institute (Mula Mustafe Bašeskije, 21)\n\nKatedrala (Trg Fra Grge Martica 2)\n\nSephardic Synagogue and Jewish Museum (Mula Mustafe Baseskije 40)\n\nOrtodox Cathedral (Trg Oslobodenja)\n\nArt Cinema Kriterion (Obala Kulina Bana 2)\n\nUmjetnicka Galerija (Zelenih Beretki 8)\n\nMarkale (Mula Mustafe Baseskije)\n\nIn the afternoon I would like to explore the less touristic neighbourhood of Vratnik: the Arapova Mosque and the Lučevica Mosque, the Kula Ploče Tower and the Širokac Kula Tower, the Kovači martyr’s memorial cemetery and wait for the sunset from the Žuta Tabija (Yellow Bastion), enjoying the amazing view.\n\nArapova Mosque (Požegina bb)\n\nLučevica Mosque (Očaktanum 78)\n\nKula Ploče Tower (Ploča bb)\n\nŠirokac Kula Tower\n\nKovači cemetery (Širokac)\n\nŽuta Tabija (Jekovac)\n\n4th of January:\n\nOn the 4th of January I would like to explore the very less touristic districts, starting from the panoramic view from the top of the Avaz Twist Tower, a graffiti hunting in Ciglane (I got a hint saying to look for “elevators”!) and a lunch at the wonderful Avlija Restaurant. In the afternoon I will be wandering around another authentic neighbourhood called Bjelave which is full of very interesting buildings, such as the Consulate of Britain, the Vrhbosnanska Bogoslovija, Svrzo House, the University of Islamic Sciences and the Jahja Paša Mosque. And when I will need to recover from the cold hanging a nice cup of tea I will stop at the Tea House Cajdzmica Dzirlo. For dinner I will be at the famous Kod Kibeta Restaurant.\n\nAvaz Twist Tower (Tešanjska 24)\n\nCiglane neighbourhood\n\nAvlija Restaurant (Sumbula Avde 27)\n\nConsulate of Britain (Petrakijina 11)\n\nVrhbosnanska Bogoslovija (Josipa Štadlera)\n\nSvrzo House (Glodzina 8)\n\nUniversity of Islamic Sciences (Cemerlina 54)\n\nJahja Paša Mosque (Cemerlina bb)\n\nCajdzmica Dzirlo (Kovaci Cilcma 6)\n\nKod Kibeta Restaurant (Vrbanjuša 164)"
