My Great Great Grandfather Josiah Benjamin Adam Bland, who arrived in SA and married Catharina Frederika du Plessis, of French Huguenot and Boer descent. Their daughter Helena Aletta Bland married Irishman John George Cheere Emmett. Their daughter Annie Francis Bland Emmett married Louis Botha.

Louis Botha, born in Greytown, was to become a Boer General, along with his brother in law, Cheere Emmett of Vryheid. Later Louis Botha was to become the first Prime Minister of The Union of South Africa in 1912.

The images in this post are from a group, Vryheid, Good Old Vryheid, which shows Generals, Louis Botha and Lucas Meyer with their wives, posing with bandoliers over their shoulders and sporting their rifles.

The remaining images are portraits of Annie and Louis Botha that can be found at Botha House on the KZN South Coast, and a portrait image of Annie in my possession. Annie was my Grandfatherâ€™s cousin.

Thanks to Vryheid, Good Old Vryheid for supplying the top image.
