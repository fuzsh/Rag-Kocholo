        "text": "Amidst the pressures of war, if having to sort out a rebellion by a large number of your own people, command a force to conquer German South West Africa and oversee countrymen serve in Central and East Africa and Europe is not enough, there is a little matter of a daughter getting married.\n\nThis was certainly not something I expected to discover in war-time Colonial Office correspondence. Yet, in CO 551/84 16355, there is correspondence marked Private and titled Message from SofS on Marriage of General Botha’s Daughter. The summary continues:\n\n‘Botha’s youngest daughter is to be married on Saturday at 2 o’clock. Sure it would give him pleasure if you could telegraph your best wishes direct to him or through me so as to reach him Saturday.’\n\nCorrespondence within the file has David Davies letting Bonar Law’s assistant JCC Davidson know that he can ‘add the Prime Minister’s congratulations to Mr Bonar Law’s.’\n\nThe telegram which was sent at 11.30am on 7 April 1916 read:\n\n‘Please convey to General Botha expression of my sincere congratulations on the occasion of his youngest daughter’s marriage. The Prime Minister also requests me to forward his best wishes for the future happiness of bride and bridegroom.’\n\nMinnie Frances Botha, born 24 January 1894 in Vryheid, was to marry Hubert Gordon Reid, born 9 December 1882 in Swellendam, on 8 April 1916 at Groote Schuur in Cape Town.\n\nHubert changed his name to Hubert Gordon Botha-Reid and together with Minnie, they had four children, the eldest Annie Frances born on 19 April 1917. Two and a half years after the birth of this grandchild, Prime Minister Louis Botha died from the influenza. His daughter Minnie died 10 August 1972 and son-in-law Hubert 25 May 1944.\n\nThis was certainly not the only wedding to take place during war, but it is one of the few to feature in official correspondence before the actual day and not as part of a pension claim or the reason for a woman resigning her post. (And 80 years to the day, another wedding took place – in Boksburg, South Africa. Who would have thought…) Not all war time weddings lasted or were happy, and one can only hope the Botha-Reids enjoyed their 28 years of marriage despite the two world wars which impacted so on their relationship.\n\nReferences:\n\nhttps://www.wikitree.com/wiki/Botha-697"
