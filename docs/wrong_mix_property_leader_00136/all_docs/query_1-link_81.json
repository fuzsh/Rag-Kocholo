        "text": "10 Our survey of the secondary literature clearly demonstrates that historians who refer to the Natives Land Act neglect to write about the exception clause in the Act, with one exception: B. Spies, J. Brits and A. Grundlingh explicitly refer to the exception clause in H. Giliomee and B. Mbenga (eds.), New History of South Africa (Cape Town, 2007), 233. Among earlier historians, only one, C. W. de Kiewiet, cited the government's ‘discretionary power’ to allow land purchases by Africans, but he did not identify the appropriate clause in the Land Act. Saul Dubow discusses land policy in the early 1920s, describes the concern of Native Affairs Department officials about providing more land for Africans and refers to an important late 1921 memorandum allowing more land to be sold to Africans. However, he missed the exception clause and any buying data. Robert Morrell writes about Africans in the eastern Transvaal purchasing land, but does not explain why this was legally possible. Martin Chanock implies that purchases were possible when he states that prices for farms were rising, but provides no further information. Even Marian Lacey, who wrote extensively on land policy, did not refer to the exception clause or discuss the process by which Africans gained government permission to buy or lease a piece of land. Finally, A. J. Christopher's examination of land policies in southern Africa between 1860 and 1960 focuses overwhelmingly on European settlement patterns and colonial government policies and only alludes to the Natives Land Act.

In addition, Keegan called the Act the ‘most important legislative intervention’. T. J. Keegan, ‘The Sharecropping economy, African class formation and the 1913 Natives’ [sic] Land Act in the Highveld Maize Belt', in Shula Marks and Richard Rathbone (eds.), Industrialisation and Social Change in South Africa (London, 1982), 203. Kruger referred to the Act as the ‘most important legal enactment of those early years’. D. W. Kruger, The Making of a Nation (Johannesburg, 1969), 60. See also: Michael Robertson, ‘Segregation land law: a socio-legal analysis’, in Hugh Corder (ed.), Essays on Law and Social Practice in South Africa (Cape Town, 1988), 285–317; and Daniels, Rudolph, ‘The agrarian land question in South Africa in its historical context’, American Journal of Economics and Sociology, 48 (July 1989), 327–38CrossRefGoogle Scholar.\n\n20 For the labor argument, see ibid. 285–317; Lacey, Working for Boroko, 19; William Beinart, Twentieth Century South Africa (Oxford, 1994), 52–4; on capitalist motives, Lacey, Working for Boroko; Wolpe, H., ‘Capitalism and cheap labour power in South Africa: from segregation to apartheid’, Economy and Society, 1 (1972), 425–56CrossRefGoogle Scholar; on anti-squatting, see T.

Davenport and Christopher Saunders, South Africa: A Modern History (New York, 2000), 271–2, and Beinart and Delius, ‘Introduction’, 14. A more detailed analysis of the motives of the promoters of the Land Act can be found in Feinberg, ‘The Natives Land Act of 1913 in South Africa’.\n\n29 Editorial, ‘Native and Asiatic Bills’, Friend, 2 May 1913. The Friend was a Free State newspaper, published in Bloemfontein. A contemporary and member of the Native Affairs Commission, C. T. Loram, writing twenty years later, talks about the link between land and segregation: ‘Inasmuch as South Africa has embarked upon the policy of the territorial segregation of the races the Native Question is to-day [1932/3] the land question’. Loram, C. T., ‘Native progress and improvement in race relations in South Africa’, Journal of the Royal African Society, 32 (Jan. 1933), 74Google Scholar. Among historians, Maylam writes that the Land Act ‘entrenched the principle of territorial segregation’. Furthermore, he states that ‘territorial separation had been at the top of the union government's segregationist agenda’, and adds that the 1936 Native Trust and Land Act ‘confirmed the policy of territorial segregation’. Maylam, South Africa's Racial Past, 149, 152, 232. Davenport and Saunders, too, emphasize the segregation goal (but also consider opposition to sharecropping as important). They refer as well to the ‘introduction of territorial separation with the passage of the Native [sic] Land Act’. Davenport and Saunders, South Africa: A Modern History, 271, 272; 598. Wickins states that one of the ‘principal objectives’ was ‘territorial segregation with respect to landholding’. Wickins, ‘The Natives Land Act of 1913’, 123–4. See also Cell, The Highest Stage of White Supremacy; Kallaway, P., ‘F. S. Malan, the Cape liberal tradition, and South African politics, 1908–1924’, Journal of African History, 16 (1974), 118Google Scholar.\n\n30 Wickins, ‘The Natives Land Act of 1913’, 127; Keegan, T. J., ‘Crisis and catharsis in the development of capitalism in South African agriculture’, African Affairs, 84 (July 1985), 386CrossRefGoogle Scholar. See also Shula Marks and Richard Rathbone, ‘Introduction’, in Marks and Rathbone, Industrialisation and Social Change in South Africa (London, 1982), 24, where they write that the Act ‘definitively limit[ed] the amount of land available for African land purchase’; and M. Robertson, ‘Dividing the land: an introduction to apartheid land law’, in Christina Murray and Catherine O'Regan (eds.), No Place to Rest: Forced Removals and the Law in South Africa (Cape Town, 1990), 125, who stated emphatically that the Land Act ‘forbids Africans from holding any rights to land outside those [areas] set aside for them’.\n\n34 We should note that Native Commissioner reports and letters to NAD officials urging approval of purchase requests rarely suggest that the purchase should be approved because the white seller no longer wished to live near Africans. What was sometimes discussed were the dire financial straits the seller faced and the necessity to conclude the transaction quickly so that the buyers would not lose their down payment and other money given to the seller. Officials of the NAD, under Hertzog, often asked the white neighbors if they approved of a sale, and the responses were mixed. In addition, there is evidence that NAD officials told white opponents of a particular sale that the government would not act on their objections because to do so would contradict government land policy in the late 1920s. NASA, NTS 3456, 107/308, Secretary for Native Affairs to Secretary for Lands, 5 Sept. 1927.\n\n39 The percentages have been rounded off. The sellers of farms to African buyers were mainly individual white landowners, some of whom sold more than one portion of a farm. There were approximately 288 white sellers, including 32 women. Contrary to the perceptions of some historians, very few businesses sold farms to Africans (15 or 16). In addition, we should emphasize that Africans rarely sold land which they had purchased. The Parliamentary data yielded the following information: between 1913 and 1936, 28 African-owned farms or portions of farms were sold to whites: 1 was sold by the sheriff, and 1 portion was sold to a Mission. These sales represent a very small percentage of loss to African owners.\n\n40 Marian Lacey is one of the few historians who writes that Prime Minister Hertzog may not really have been the extremist that he is accused of being. Lacey says that Hertzog ‘was merely paying lip service to the principle of complete territorial segregation laid down in 1913’, claiming that he ‘had no intention of carrying out the reserve policy by segregating Africans and whites territorially’. Finally, Lacey asserts that segregation under the new Natives Land Act Amendment Bill 1926 ‘was not envisaged’ because the additional land for Africans was ‘totally inadequate’. Working for Boroko, 21, 22, 26. We wish to thank T. R. H. Davenport for urging us to re-examine this book.\n\n45 University of Cape Town Archives, Herbst Collection, BC 79, D 22.1, memorandum of a meeting on 5 Dec. 1921. The full quote reads: SMUTS: ‘remarked that, as he had stated in Parliament, … he was not convinced of the desirability of pressing forward the policy of territorial segregation to a sudden or hasty consummation. The matter was of enormous importance. He felt that, whatever it might be proper to decide in regard to the proposals brought forward by the Native Affairs Department, it would be unwise to adopt any measure which was equivalent to segregation out-of-hand’.\n\n46 The report is among the papers of the secretary for Native Affairs at the time. The contents suggest that the memorandum may have been written for Hertzog who also held the portfolio of minister of Native Affairs. University of Cape Town, Herbst Collection, ERG [E. R. Garthorne,], ‘Native segregation’, 7 Oct. 1924. The full quotations include the following: ‘Having regards to the ultimate goal of racial segregation … It is thought that in the course of time native areas would thus be evolved without bitterness or serious antagonism’, 9; ‘initial steps might be taken towards the ultimate objective of segregation … Much must necessarily be left to the future for adjustment in the light of experience yet to be gained’, 11.\n\n54 NASA, NTS 3624, 1131/308, report by two members of the Native Affairs Commission to Minister of Native Affairs, 8 Nov. 1935. Referring to Elandsfontein 374, they wrote: ‘The sale of this land would tend to intensify the existing evil of isolated areas of Native owned land amidst European settlements’. See also NTS 3579, 780/308, Secretary for Native Affairs [Smit] to Secretary for Justice [C. H. Blaine], 14 May 1937. This letter concerned a section of the Native Trust and Land Act; Smit refers to ‘including the elimination of “black spots” in purely European areas’. In another part of the letter, Smit wrote: ‘In many cases such native owned properties are islands in the European areas and are far removed from either scheduled or released areas’. Note that the word ‘islands’ was already being used in documents dated 1917 and 1926. House of Assembly, Debates, Second Parliament, Second Session, 20 Apr. 1917, 172, statement by L. E. Roux van Niekerk; NASA, GG 976, 19/933, GG to Secretary of State, 4 June 1926."
