        "text": "Pretoria - It will a great honour to look after \"first lady\" Marike de Klerk's grave.\n\n\"She is lying here with Louis Botha. We will guard her grave as closely as his,\" said Emmanuel Matolela, a security guard who does night duty at the Rebecca Street cemetery in Pretoria, following De Klerk's burial there on Saturday.\n\nGeneral Louis Botha, statesman and militarist, was buried in the cemetery after his death in 1919 of pneumonia.\n\nMatolela was selling flowers with a friend Tsepo Motsuenyane at the cemetery on Saturday.\n\n\"I heard she would be buried here so we bought extra flowers. Tsepo went to buy more roses at a flower market auction in Johannesburg,\" Matolela said.\n\n\"I though there would be more flowers, especially at the gate,\" said Ria Joubert, a Pretoria West resident. \"My parents are buried here. I will take De Klerk flowers\".\n\nAfter the funeral - during which members of the National Intelligence Agency stood guard, ensuring that only close friends and family attended the ceremony - Joubert went to have a look at De Klerk's grave.\n\nHein Wentzel of Kilner Park did buy a bouquet of flowers from the colourful stall across the cemetery. He placed it on the bonnet of the hearse shortly before it drove through the cemetery gates.\n\n\"I loved her. I never met her, but she always seemed to have an aura of gentleness. I found her death dreadfully tragic,\" Wentzel said with tears in his eyes.\n\nHendrik Swartz of Pretoria West, his wife Daphnie and their children Hendrik (7) and Lee-Ann (10) were waiting outside the gate in the hopes of catching a glimpse of FW de Klerk.\n\n\"Her murder is pathetic. If the former state president's (former) wife is no longer safe, what about my wife?\" Swartz wanted to know.\n\nThe De Klerk family and friends quickly drove through the gates in a procession of no more than 15 cars. The cars left the cemetery one after the other, with FW de Klerk and his wife Elita (Georgiades) leaving last.\n\nA memorial service was conducted afterwards at the Gereformeerde Kerk Wapadrant.\n\nThe few wreaths on De Klerk'ss grave conveyed messages from the NNP, the Afrikanerbond and De Klerk's friend, Ester Jonker.\n\nLynette Kopp of Arcadia, who specially went to see the grave, said her first impulse had been that De Klerk had committed suicide, since it was 'clear from interviews that she was suffering\"."
