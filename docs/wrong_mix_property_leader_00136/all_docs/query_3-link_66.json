Reminiscent of the writings of Edward Said, Neville Alexander, Frantz Fanon, and Amilcar Cabral. It deconstructs the facade of the two-state solution and proposes an alternative one. Strongly recommended\n\nI started reading the book and I didn't love it at first but as I read more, I started to really enjoy it. I think Holly Webb writes very creative books. I loved this specific book because I also like wildlife and saving animals.\n\nEvery page is magical. The characters, the story line. The author transports you into a world of magic and the powers it holds to alter life. I didn't want thisvery original story to end and be brought back to real life."
