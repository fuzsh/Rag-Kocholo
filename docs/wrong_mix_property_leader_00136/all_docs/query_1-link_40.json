        "text": "South Africa's obsession with race is hardly a secret. Just five years ago, it was illegal for blacks and whites to marry or make love.\n\nPolice were authorized to check sheets for signs of sex between couples of different colors; the sound of creaking bedsprings could become courtroom evidence.\n\nEven when the 1949 Prohibition of Mixed Marriages Act was abolished in 1985, the state continued to harass legally married mixed couples who tried to live together in neighborhoods still segregated by a different set of apartheid rules.\n\nAgainst this background, public reaction to the romance between anti-apartheid cleric Allan Boesak and television producer Elna Botha is rather bizarre.\n\nBoesak, the married president of the World Alliance of Reformed Church, is \"colored\" (mixed-race). Botha, the married niece of former Minister of Home Affairs Stoffel Botha, is white. Yet in all the furor over last month's revelation of their adulterous affair, local newspapers conspicuously failed to mention this fact.\n\nBoesak announced his resignation from the church at his Sunday sermon on July 8. He asked his parishioners for their understanding for the breakup of his 21-year-old marriage and an affair about which he said there was \"nothing immoral.\"\n\nBotha's husband Colin Fluxman, who is a radio personality and news anchorman, read the news on television early the next morning, but was unable to complete the item about Boesak's resignation.\n\nThe response to the affair raises the question of whether skin color is becoming less important as Pretoria tries to edge away from institutionalized racism.\n\nMarriages across the color line are still rare here. Apart from the legal minefield faced by such couples _ such as how to educate their children when public schools are still segregated _ many white South Africans still reject the idea.\n\nTake, for example, reaction to the engagement of convent-educated Afrikaner Margaret le Roux to black Anthony Khama, son of the late Botswanan president Sir Seretse Khama. Whites in le Roux's conservative mining town of Rustenburg were so outraged by the couple's plans that they launched a hate campaign against anybody linked to the family.\n\nAlthough le Roux's father said he gave the couple his blessing (\"Anthony's a real gentleman _ and anyway, he's not black but a very highly educated colored man,\" said farmer Louis le Roux), rumor-mongers suggested le Roux's mother had committed suicide over the match. Le Roux's sister-in-law suffered a nervous breakdown after her family threatened to ostracize her if she attended the wedding and a former boyfriend of the bride-to-be received obscene calls over a relationship that ended 12 years ago.\n\nTrudi Reddy, a white Afrikaner married to Indian television reporter San Reddy, experienced similar abuse after her wedding. \"Strangers told me that I may as well become a prostitute,\" Reddy recently told a columnist for the Johannesburg-based Sunday Times. \"San got phone calls from people who said \"we're going to rape your wife to show her what white men can do'. My family wants nothing to do with me and I was forbidden access to my child (from a previous relationship) unless I left San.\"\n\nGiven these pressures, it is hardly surprising that the number of racially mixed marriages is small.\n\nWhy, then, was the Boesak-Botha relationship treated so circumspectly?\n\n\"There's a very simple and straightforward answer,\" says University of Cape Town psychology professor Don Foster.\n\nFoster believes South Africans _ able to deduce the race of a person from his name, address or accent _ are already so preoccupied with color it was redundant to spell out the racial connotations of the affair.\n\n\"It is not in the interests of the government or its mouthpieces (in the Afrikaans press) to make blatant statements about racism, particularly when you're dealing as sophisticated a figure as Dr. Boesak. Everybody knows Dr. Boesak is not white and in a climate where symbolic racism is dominant, the racial cues are so prominent that all you have to do is signal softly that (Botha) is the niece of a former Afrikaans cabinet minister.\"\n\nThese considerations may well have contributed to the gentleness of Boesak's treatment in a society so puritanical it still bans Playboy magazine. \"Colored\" members of his Dutch Reformed Mission Church congregation _ strongly supportive of his role in the struggle for human rights _ allowed him to reconsider his resignation as a minister in their church.\n\nAnd when Boesak did finally terminate his clerical career last week with a confirmation of his resignation and the announcement of a pending divorce from his wife Dorothy, the scandal prompted little opposition to his intention of entering full-time politics.\n\nBoesak and Botha have both said they planned to continue their relationship.\n\n\"(Boesak's) involvement with a woman other than his wife is no reason for his political role to end,\" editorialized the liberal Cape Times.\n\nNevertheless, Afrikaans graffiti on walls near Boesak's home indicates a comeback may not be that easy. \"Boesak: sell-out of apartheid,\" says one message. \"We don't want you,\" says another. If nothing else, the slogans make it clear that changes to the country's political system are unlikely to eradicate the South African fixation with skin color anytime soon."
