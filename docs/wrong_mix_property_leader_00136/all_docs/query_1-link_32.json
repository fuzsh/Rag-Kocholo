        "text": "(Child1) Ménage à trois Between 11 June 1683 and 1700 Maria Kickers and Jan Cornelisz were legally married, but at the same time, from at least 1687 Frederich Both and Maria were lovers, apparently with the agreement of Jan. During divorce proceedings in 1700 Maria conceded that eight of her children, that is Theunis Botha, Willem Bootha, Catrijna Both, Cornelia Botha, Anna Bota, Maria Botha and Johannes Botha were fathered by Frederich Both(a) with the apparent encouragement (aanleijding) of her spouse, Jan Cornelisz, at the time. All of these offspring subsequently used the surname Both(a). However, in 1689 two women alleged that Theunis, Maria's oldest child, was fathered by Ferdinandùs Appel. This is born out by modern DNA tests, which have shown that direct patrilineal descendants of Theunis tested positive for the same Y-DNA haplogroup as direct patrilineal descendants of Appel.7 NotesA DNA study has found that male descendants of Maria Kickers are from two different Y-chromosome DNA haplogroups. Known descendants of Theunis Botha share the same Y-chromosome DNA as a direct descendant of Ferdinandùs Appel — while descendants of the other sons have different Y-chromosome DNA — most likely that of Frederich Both. This evidence supports an allegation made by two women in 1689 that Theunis — Maria's oldest child — was fathered by Appel. Maria subsequently testified that all her children were fathered by Both and not her husband Jan Cornelisz aka Jan Bombam. Read the attached article by Jaco Greeff who did the DNA study."
