        "text": "Chapter 42\n\nFollowing David Cameron’s concession on the referendum issue, the Prime Minister no doubt hoped that he had bought himself some respite from his twin headaches of Europe and UKIP. To be sure, the government certainly had plenty of other issues on its plate. The disturbing rise of the Islamic State (IS) group in Iraq, and then into Syria, was forcing western leaders to once again turn their attention to the Middle East. Despite protests from the left that the previous bombing campaign against Assad had helped to create the power vacuum that had allowed IS to expand so rapidly in the first place, the UK was quick to join other nations in approving airstrikes against the jihadist insurgency in both countries, with the government and the two main opposition parties all throwing their support behind military action against the group in a Commons vote.\n\nThe Tories could take comfort from the improved performance of the UK economy. But George Osborne was determined that the uncertainty created by the possibility of EU withdrawal should not be allowed to throw the recovery off course. Having ultimately lost the argument within the cabinet on the referendum, the Chancellor sought to make up for this setback by pursuing other means to make Britain an attractive place to business. Infrastructure formed a major part of this, as Osborne made every effort to bring in foreign investment into existing initiatives such as the Hinkley Point Nuclear Power Station, as well as giving the go ahead for new projects too. The most prominent of these was the third runway at Heathrow. The issue was a long running one that went back well into the previous decade, but successive governments had been reluctant to address it, in large part because of the opposition of many MPs and residents who lived in the area to the expansion. Indeed, David Cameron himself had said in 2009 that “The third runway at Heathrow is not going ahead, no ifs, no buts.”\n\nRespect's MP for West Ham Murad Qureshi (centre) joins Labour's John McDonnell and activists in protesting against the third runway at Heathrow\n\nHowever, now that the Conservatives were in government, this stance had softened somewhat, and the report of the Airports Commission, set up in 2011 to explore the options for increasing Britain’s airport capacity, which was strongly supportive of a new runway at Heathrow, swung the case decisively for the pro-expansion voices within the government. However, Tory opponents to the proposals were still numerous enough to ensure that the Prime Minister guaranteed a free vote on the bill when it came to parliament. Whilst this managed to prevent ministerial resignations, it was not enough for Zac Goldsmith, the Tory backbench MP for Richmond Park. Goldsmith was a staunch environmentalist and had long since pledged to resign his seat and fight the ensuing by election on an Independent, anti-Heathrow platform if expansion was ever approved. Goldsmith proved to be as good as his word, and he stood down the day after the government announced its approval for a third runway. After the Conservative Party announced it would not field a candidate against Goldsmith, the race looked to be a straight fight between Goldsmith and the deflated Liberal Democrats, now led by David Laws, who had recently beaten out Alistair Carmichael for the party leadership.\n\nThe drive to improve infrastructure was accompanied by attempts to lessen the burden of regulation on business. The focus of these efforts largely fell on employment legislation, and especially the trade union movement. Efforts to weaken the power of the unions had been central to the mission of the Thatcher government, and now her successors within the Conservative Party felt that it was time for her reforms to be taken one step further. In September, the government published the first draft of its Trade Union Bill. The proposals made for difficult reading for all in the labour movement. A minimum turnout threshold of 50% was to be applied in strike ballots, with a fourth month time limit for industrial action to take place after a ballot in favour. The ban on the use of agency workers to cover for those on strike was to be lifted, and picketing rules were also to be reformed. Perhaps most importantly for both Labour and Respect, the bill proposed reforming the political levy so that payment would be on an ‘opt in’ basis, rather than the current system, where workers had to consciously decide to opt out. This meant that both parties would stand to lose many of the donations they received from their affiliated unions- a significant source of income. The criticism from the opposition was sharp. Even David Miliband, who, like his immediate predecessors, had been keen to disassociate himself from the trade union movement, vigorously opposed the bill as it made its way through the Commons. However, the absence of a significant rebellion on the government side ensured that the bill passed the lower chamber unamended.\n\nZac Goldsmith speaks at a rally against the third runway at Heathrow, shortly after resigning his Richmond Park seat to fight a by election on the issue\n\nAs per usual, the Tories could expect a tougher fight in the Lords. The governments review of the functions of the upper house had led to a minor cutback in the power of peers to influence the legislative process, as well as ensuring it would remain unelected, as the date for electing the first democratically chosen ‘Senators’ under Gordon Brown’s reforms had been pushed back from 2014 to 2016 to coincide with the next general election. By doing this, the government aimed to prevent a mid-term protest vote from frustrating the ability of a government to pass its agenda through Parliament. Although it lacked the mandate of the Commons, the Lords was still able to have some influence when it came to altering aspects of several bills, of which the Trade Union Act was a prime example.\n\nThe most notable concession that peers were able to extract came on the political levy, where the Lib Dems united with Labour to ensure that the ‘opt in’ rules would be limited to new members. Also included was the promise of an independent review of electronic voting for strike action to alleviate the problems posed by the turnout threshold. However, the initial proposals still remained largely intact, and would weaken further what were already some of the most relaxed employment laws in the western world.\n\nDespite the progress that the government had been making on economic matters, the Conservatives still seemed unable shake the insurgency to their right, which posed a clear threat to their chances of re-election. Indeed, after the European Elections, the UKIP surge went into overdrive, with the party reaching as high as 20% in some polls. The Newark by election result, where Conservative Robert Jenrick prevailed over UKIP’s Roger Helmer by a margin of 8%, would come as a huge relief to the Tories, but it did little to disrupt the momentum of the upstarts.\n\nThe Conservative failure to stem the flow of support to UKIP was not for want of trying. Cameron’s landmark referendum pledge was accompanied by numerous other attempts to burnish his eurosceptic credentials. Former Tory leader and prominent opponent of the European project Michael Howard was announced as the UK’s next EU commissioner, to howls of discontent from opposition benches. Cameron would also try, and spectacularly fail- to block the candidacy of Jean Claude-Juncker as the next President of the Commission, claiming the former Prime Minister of Luxembourg was too federalist. On the domestic front, the government tried to tap into the same English Nationalist sentiment that UKIP seemed to be appealing too by pushing through ‘English Votes for English Laws’ legislation, which handed more power to English (and occasionally Welsh) members in devolved areas of legislation. All of these measures, to one extent or another, were aimed at tackling the increasing movement toward UKIP in the polls, but they appeared to have little effect.\n\nIndeed, at the same time as the Tories were pushing these measures in government, UKIP seemed to moving into the next stage of its political development. On the 4th August, British politics was rocked by the announcement that Diana Coad, MP for Stourbridge, was defecting from the Conservatives to UKIP. Photos of Nigel Farage standing alongside his party’s newest recruit, beaming from ear to ear, were soon plastered across the front page of nearly every national newspaper. It was without a doubt a major blow to the Tories. UKIP’s upturn in the polls had led to months of speculation as to whether eurosceptic MPs might cross the floor to join the party, just as Labour left wingers had done for Respect ten years previously. UKIP had technically already had its first MP, thanks to Bob Spink’s brief defection during the previous parliament, but it was clear that Coad’s change of allegiance was of far more significance. Few doubted that more Tory MPs would soon follow her out of the door. The question was just how large the right wing exodus would ultimately be.\n\nStourbridge MP Diana Coad faces the press shortly after her defection to UKIP\n\nOver the next two months, Coad would be followed by Mark Reckless (Rochester and Strood) Gordon Henderson (Sittingbourne and Sheppey) and Phillip Hollobone (Kettering). The euphoric mood of the UKIP Conference in Doncaster that year contrasted with an altogether more sombre atmosphere at its Conservative counterpart in Birmingham. Pundits and party figures questioned just how many more parliamentarians were contemplating following their former colleagues into Nigel Farage’s party. Some even began to question whether the government’s majority, once 24, now just 12, could be in jeopardy.\n\nThere were marked parallels between the rise of Respect in 2004 and that of UKIP almost exactly a decade later. Indeed, Farage often talked of emulating the tactics of his left-wing counterparts in establishing UKIP as a permanent force in UK politics, and it is quite possible that the modest success of Respect in 2004 encouraged more Tories to cross the floor than otherwise might have been the case. Despite coming from opposing poles of the political spectrum, both parties had harnessed a wave of anti-establishment feeling and the charisma of a popular leader to secure a strong result in the European Elections, before channelling their momentum into establishing a parliamentary presence through defections from the more radical wing of one of the major parties.\n\nThe Conservative response to the defections mirrored Labour’s in 2004. Prominent Tories called on their former party colleagues to do the ‘honourable thing’ and resign to fight a by election, so that their constituents might approve their change of allegiance. Wary of the potential of a by election loss to disrupt their forward momentum, UKIP initially emulated Respect and refuse to take the bait. Coad, Reckless, Henderson and Hollobone all refused to stand down from their seats until the next election.\n\nBut the party’s fifth recruit in the Commons, Douglas Carswell, felt that he could only reconcile his decision to leave the Conservative Party with his conscience if he first stood down and called a by election in his Clacton constituency. At first UKIP were resistant to Carswell's insistence on making his defection contingent on his own resignation. Although they were confident of winning the ensuing by election, given that Clacton was already their number one target seat in the country, they feared that Carswell’s resignation could set a dangerous precedent that would deter those Tory eurosceptics sitting on less comfortable territory from crossing the floor. But the Clacton MP stood his ground, and finally, in late September, he became the latest addition to UKIP’s rapidly expanding parliamentary contingent.\n\nUKIP's fifth defector, Douglas Carswell, announces his change of allegiance at a press conference with UKIP leader Nigel Farage\n\nThe Clacton by election was soon scheduled for the first Thursday of November. The contest added extra intrigue to Carswell’s defection, not only because he had taken a step that his four other parliamentary colleagues had refused to in triggering the by election in the first place, but because it was thought that he would become the first UKIP MP to be directly elected to the Commons. But events would conspire to deny him this honour.\n\nChapter 43\n\nIf one was asked to find two parliamentary constituencies that were the polar-opposite of each other, there would scarcely be a better pairing than that of Richmond Park, and Heywood and Middleton. One was a leafy suburb in the south of London, wealthy, but also socially liberal, and overwhelmingly supportive of Britain’s membership of the EU. The other was typical of Labour’s northern, post-industrial heartlands, with an electorate that was largely white, working class, and socially conservative. And yet on the 9th October, the by elections that took place in these two constituencies would go some way to illustrating the deepening divides in UK politics that threatened to tear apart the voting coalitions of both of the major parties.\n\nThe stark contrast in the profile of the two seats was reflected in the dynamics of each contest. Richmond Park was thought of as a straight fight between a theoretically Independent, but Conservative backed Zac Goldsmith, and the Liberal Democrat candidate Robin Meltzer. In Heywood and Middleton, Labour’s Liz McInnes was thought to be confident of fending off a challenge from UKIP’s John Bickley. None of the four parties involved seriously harboured ambitions of winning both seats. As for ‘The Alternative’, the fifth player in British politics, Andrée Frieze of the Green Party was fighting Richmond Park, and Clive Searle of Respect was fighting Heywood and Middleton, but neither were thought of as likely to come remotely near victory.\n\nIndeed, the alliance hadn’t even bothered to field a candidate in the Heywood and Middleton in 2011. Activists in both seats mooted the possibility of standing down in favour of the candidate best placed to defeat the right-wing candidate. These suggestions were ultimately rejected both by party leaders and the local branch parties, largely because of the reluctance to endorse a candidate from a party led by Laws or Miliband, neither of whom came from the right wings of their parties. If either Labour or the Lib Dems leaned further to the left in this period, perhaps things would have been different, but as things were, there was a decisive lack of solidarity between the three groups, and the age-old idea of a ‘progressive alliance’ linking them together seemed more and more distant.\n\nRichmond Park had flipped back between yellow and blue since its creation in 1997, when it had been won by the Liberal Democrats. In 2011, the Conservatives were able to take the constituency back as Zac Goldsmith, a millionaire journalist and environmental activist, was able to unseat the incumbent Lib Dem, Susan Kramer. Now, the Lib Dems were hopeful that local clean air campaigner Robin Meltzer would be able to flip Richmond Park back into their hands. Goldsmith hoped that his double-digit cushion from 2011, coupled with his status as a popular local MP who was making a principled stand on the hot button issue of a third runway- would prevent him from falling prey to the infamous Lib Dem by election machine that had deprived his Tory colleagues of so many seats in the past.\n\nFor the Liberal Democrats, the contest was pivotal. They had spent much of the past few years drifting backward in the polls, amidst the rise of UKIP, and the resurgence of Labour and the Respect-Green alliance. It was hoped that David Laws could bring a dynamism that had eluded the party under the leadership of Lynne Featherstone. But Laws did not have much time to settle into his new post before Goldsmith’s resignation presented him with his first major electoral test. Not since the Eastbourne by election nearly 25 years previously had the stakes been so high for the Lib Dems. A win could launch the party back into the national spotlight and give them the momentum they needed to make gains off the Tories at the next election. Converseley, a loss could do serious damage to Law’s leadership when it had barely begun, and might consign the party to permanent decline.\n\nDavid Laws addresses the 2014 Liberal Democrat Party Conference in Bournemouth\n\nUnsurprisingly, this urgency was reflected in the resources devoted to Richmond Park. Thousands of Lib Dem activists descended on south London. Households were bombarded with endless campaign material, with some residents complaining of receiving as many as 17 different leaflets over the course of just over a month.\n\nThroughout the campaign, Goldsmith was dogged by his refusal to rule out re-joining the Conservatives if re-elected. This played into the hands of his opponents, who used this as a pretext to turn the by election into a referendum on the Conservative government, criticising Goldsmith’s support for cuts to public services, and his euroscepticism, a liability in a constituency that was thought to be largely pro-EU. On Heathrow, the Lib Dems pointed out that they had long opposed a new runway at both a local and national level, and so if anything, they had more credibility on the issue than the incumbent. This effectively neutralised the question for many voters. Initial private polling was said to indicate overwhelmingly support for Goldsmith, particularly due to his position on Heathrow. But in the month leading up to polling day, it became clear that this support was evaporating in the face of a strong campaign effort from the Lib Dems, who were growing more and more confident of victory by the day.\n\nFormer Party Leader Paddy Ashdown campaigns with Lib Dem Candidate Robin Meltzer in the Richmond Park by election\n\nJust as the campaign in Richmond Park was getting under way, 200 miles north, the UKIP bandwagon had rolled into Heywood and Middleton. It was a constituency that had been solidly Labour, even when the party was led to its worst post war result in 1983. Given that the polls were still indicating that Labour was on course to return to government in 2016, the seat should have been an easy hold, at least on paper. UKIP were expected to be their nearest challengers, but few expected them to go from comfortably losing their deposit in 2011 (when they won 3.1% of the vote) to winning the seat less than four years later.\n\nHowever, the momentum behind them was undeniable. The upsurge in support for Nigel Farage’s party had allowed it to win a plurality of votes at the recent European Parliament Elections. What was more, although UKIP was starting from a low base of support in the constituency, the sizeable BNP and Conservative vote gave it plenty of scope to expand. The party had also demonstrated its ability to win over disaffected working-class Labour voters, who were sceptical about large scale immigration and the European Union, and disillusioned with the two major parties. This demographic made up a sizeable chunk of the Labour base in a constituency like Heywood and Middleton, and it was vulnerable.\n\nUKIP’s campaign was highly populist in nature. Nigel Farage appeared regularly in the seat in the month leading up to the by election, urging the people of Heywood and Middleton to deliver a message to the ‘liberal elite’ that led the Labour Party by sending a UKIP MP to the House of Commons. UKIP’s local campaign was bolstered by the string of recent defections to them at the national level, and UKIP’s new MPs were regularly seen accompanying Nigel Farage and the candidate, John Bickley, at party events around the constituency. Labour had entered the campaign cautiously confident of holding off the UKIP threat, but as the weeks went by, the party’s internal data showed that it was in trouble, with more and more voters minded to support for Bickley over McInnes.\n\nNigel Farage and John Bickley park their tanks on Labour's lawn in Heywood and Middleton\n\nPublic polls provided by Lord Ashcroft and Survation suggested Labour had a decent cushion- but as the constituency went to vote the 9th October, the Labour camp was in a far more pessimistic mood.\n\nAs the polling stations closed in both Richmond and Heywood and Middleton, the early signs from both counts did little to ease jangling nerves for any of the four parties involved. Both by elections were thought to be tight. Reporters from across the national media provided hours of speculation, but the first definitive result came from Richmond Park. Just a few minutes short of 2 o’clock in the morning, the returning officer announced that Robin Meltzer was to be the new local MP. At long last, the Liberal Democrats had something to cheer about. But the outcome also had a wider significance. Laws’ leadership had gone through its early trial by fire and come out stronger on the other side. The victory didn’t deliver a significant polling bounce, but it did restore morale with party ranks, and raised hopes that the next general election could be more than just a case of damage limitation.\n\nMeltzer had prevailed over Goldsmith by a margin of just over a thousand votes. The gap was not a large, but looked like a vast chasm compared to the margins involved in the Heywood and Middleton contest. As the count in Richmond finished, the Greater Manchester constituency was in the process of a recount. It was clear that UKIP had performed well above expectations. The grins on the faces of their party activists contrasted with the abject despair evident in the Labour team as the night progressed. Finally, over an hour after news of the Lib Dem gain down south had filtered through, the final tallies were reported.\n\nBy just 253 votes, John Bickley had edged out Liz McInnes, and against all expectations, would become UKIP’s first directly elected MP. The result sent shockwaves through British politics. Up until that point, many had assumed that UKIP was primarily a threat to the Conservatives rather than Labour. Bickley’s victory blew that theory clean out of the water, and laid bare the deep frustration that had been building in the party’s post-industrial heartlands for some time. The statistics only served to undermine the remarkable result. UKIP had achieved a swing of over 20% from Labour, and had gone from 3.1% of the vote at the 2011 General Election to 38% three and a half years later. The key to the party’s dramatic leap forward largely rested on uniting Conservative, BNP, and socially conservative ex-Labour and Liberal Democrat voters under one roof.\n\nBut an underrated factor was also the strong Respect showing. After the previous year’s success in the nearby Manchester Central constituency, Paul Hilder had been given free rein to organise the effort in Heywood and Middleton ahead of the next General Election. The party’s campaigning chief saw it as an ideal chance to experiment with new methods aimed at reaching out beyond the party’s traditional base of ethnic minorities and the young, both of which were thin on the ground in the seat. The Respect campaign largely focused on reaching out to a range of disparate groups who had grievances with the status quo under the Tories nationally and Labour locally, highlighting the large-scale cuts and outsourcing that had taken place in public services, and attempting to appeal to working class voters by putting forward plans to tackle the area’s post-industrial decline.\n\nThese efforts would yield 8.7% of the vote, good enough for fourth place behind the Tories. Whilst this wouldn’t set the world alight by any means, it was a creditable outcome given that the seat had appeared so hopeless for the party in past general elections that neither Respect nor the Greens had thought it worth fielding a candidate. More importantly, it was likely to have been enough to allow UKIP to come through the middle and claim victory. The election of Bickley to parliament meant that despite the better than expected performance, Respect still came out of the contest with a bitter taste in its mouth, and with considerable bad blood between themselves and the Labour Party.\n\nUKIP’s shock win in Heywood and Middleton likely ranks as one of, if not the biggest by election surprise of all time. It drowned out most of the press coverage of what was an impressive Lib Dem win in Richmond Park, and brought the spotlight onto an increasingly under fire David Miliband. The double digits polling leads of his first few years at the helm seemed a distant memory. The party still maintained a recognisable polling lead, but the loss to Bickley was so humiliating that question marks began to be raised over the Labour leader’s future.\n\nHowever, as with his predecessor Gordon Brown, any mutterings against Miliband remained largely off the record. The leader of the opposition’s addressed a meeting of his parliamentary party the following Monday, and was said to have displayed both contrition and determination when he addressing the shock defeat of four days previously, promising to find out why Labour failed to defend the seat, and to use the lessons learned to tackle the threat of UKIP in countless other Labour seats like Heywood and Middleton up and down the country. The performance did enough to dampen down any rumours of an impending coup. Aside from a handful of serial rebels on the party’s left, Labour MPs overwhelmingly believed Miliband should stay on for the time being. Still, there was little doubt that he had emerged from the whole experience as a diminished figure in the eyes of both parliamentarians and the wider public.\n\nNigel Farage congratulates John Bickley on becoming UKIP's first directly elected MP in Heywood and Middleton\n\nWhilst Labour were foundering, UKIP were going from strength to strength. The party rode the momentum from its first by election victory to a second one in Clacton the following month, as Carswell was returned for his new party with over 65% of the vote. There were now 6 UKIP MPs in the House of Commons, enough to bring them level with the Respect contingent. Polling projections suggested they could be joined by dozens of colleagues come the next election. Concern in Labour and Tory circles was now starting to turn into outright panic.\n\nBut for all the speculation about how high UKIP could rise, they would go no further. The end of 2014 represented the party’s peak in the polls, and one they would gradually come down from in the run up to the 2016 election. The momentum that it had accumulated in the final half of the year would soon dissipate, as the party was hit by a several scandals involving its MEPs and Councillors. At the same time, winnable by elections and defections would dry up. The actions of Douglas Carswell surely played a part in this. Though the Clacton by election had provided UKIP with another astounding success, it had also set a precedent. Other MPs that were considering joining the party now felt that they would be obligated to follow Carswell’s lead and resign to fight a by election, often in areas that were a lot less favourable to the eurosceptic party than Clacton. In this way, the short-term boost of another by election victory in Clacton was likely outweighed by the longer-term consequences it would have for UKIP."
