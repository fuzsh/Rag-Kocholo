        "text": "ABSTRACT The lead item in the Coalition women&amp;#39;s policy for the 2013 federal election was the return of the Office for Women to the Department of Prime Minister and Cabinet. Since 2004 it had been located 20 kilometres from the heart of government, relegated to a line department dealing with family and community services. Did its return from exile indicate a renewed commitment to whole-of-government gender assessment of policy? This paper assesses the directions taken by women&amp;#39;s policy under the Rudd and Gillard Governments as compared with the new Coalition Government. It examines machinery of government arrangements for gender mainstreaming at national and intergovernmental levels. The paper concludes with analysis of why Australia&amp;#39;s major parties now more readily articulate gender equality objectives in areas such as international peacekeeping and development assistance than in domestic economic and social policy outside the gender-based violence area."
