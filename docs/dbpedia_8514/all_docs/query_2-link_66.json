        "text": "14:50 GMT - AFP is closing its live report on the British general election after David Cameron's Conservatives emerged victorious, defying opinion polls to win a clear majority. Here's a brief summary of the political drama: - nationalists win a historic landslide in Scotland, delivering a crushing blow to the opposition Labour party in its former stronghold. Nicola Sturgeon's party takes 56 out of 59 seats. - the leaders of Labour, the Liberal Democrats and the anti-EU UK Independence Party (UKIP) all step down after suffering major losses - Cameron pledges to form a majority government in Westminster and give Scotland \"the strongest devolved government anywhere in the world\" - nationwide predictions of a close contest between Labour and the Conservatives turn out to be wide of the mark, prompting an inquiry into polling - Cameron confirms his intention to deliver an in-out referendum on Britain's future in Europe, as the election leaves Britain's future in the EU wide open. 14:29 GMT - Last seat - The final seat in the election is declared: the Conservatives complete their nationwide victory with a win in the Cornish constituency of St Ives. It brings the final tally to: Conservatives 331; Labour 232; SNP 56; Lib Dems 8; DUP 8, and other parties 15. 14:23 GMT - Danish PM - Danish Prime Minister Helle Thorning-Schmidt congratulates her husband Stephen Kinnock on winning a Labour seat in Britain's election. \"I'm so happy on Stephen's behalf. He's done so well and the result is really great for him. All the work he has put into it has paid off,\" she tells Danish daily Berlingske. Kinnock, the 45-year-old son of Britain's 1980s Labour Party leader and longtime European Commissioner Neil Kinnock, won a seat representing the coal-mining town of Aberavon in south Wales. 14:20 GMT - Polling inquiry - The British Polling Council says it is setting up an independent inquiry into \"apparent bias\" in the final opinion polls which were wide of the mark. \"The final opinion polls before the election were clearly not as accurate as we would like, and the fact that all the pollsters underestimated the Conservative lead over Labour suggests that the methods that were used should be subject to careful, independent investigation,\" the council said in a statement. 14:14 GMT - VE Day - Away from political events, Britain is marking the 70th anniversary of Victory in Europe Day (VE Day), with Cameron heading from Downing Street to the Cenotaph for the commemorations. He is flanked by outgoing party leaders Nick Clegg and Ed Miliband as the trio lay wreaths at the war memorial. 14:01 GMT - Tusk - President of the European Council Donald Tusk congratulates Cameron and stresses the importance of Britain's role in Europe in ensuring a \"common sense agenda\". \"I count on the new British government making the case for the United Kingdom's continued membership of the European Union. In that I stand ready to help,\" he says. \"I am deeply convinced that there is no better life outside the European Union, for any country.\" - Europe - 13:55 GMT - EU reaction - Here's more on the reaction of the EU, which earlier said key principles in talks with Britain were \"non-negotiable\": Margaritis Schinas, a spokesman for European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker, says the European Commission is \"ready to work constructively\" with the new British government. He ruled out any altering of the four key treaty principles of free movement of goods, services, capital and people, adding: \"First we want to see and receive the UK proposals on reform, and of course in the spirit of openness, friendliness and constructive spirit... we are ready to discuss those in our quest for a fair deal with Britain.\" 13:45 GMT - Independence - Malcolm Harvey, of Aberdeen University, thinks it unlikely the SNP will push for another quick referendum on independence. He says their priority will be to push for increased spending powers, adding: \"This is a chance for them just to chip away at that so that when it comes eventually the step to independence would be that bit smaller\". 13:33 GMT - System 'under pressure'? - Nick Anstead, a lecturer at the London School of Economics, says this election highlights the \"fundamental nature of the British election system\": \"Vote doesn't necessarily equal seat. It's about where those votes are. UKIP got a lot of votes and one seat, the SNP got a lot of votes but because they were geographically distributed in their favour they won a lot of seats. \"This raises the question of whether or not the election system will come under pressure. I think probably not now. because the Conservative party, which is strongly in favour of our kind of election system, has a majority.\" 13:24 GMT - Scottish referendum? - Murray Pittock, a professor at the University of Glasgow, believes there is \"a big appetite\" among SNP members and supporters for another independence referendum, but says: \"The figures show that once again it would be very tight and that the 'yes' vote would probably lose marginally, or might lose marginally.\" He adds: \"The SNP will keep an eye on changing political circumstances. If the Conservative party, for example, impose austerity on Scotland and don't give Scotland the powers and the ability to draw on its own resources to meet its different domestic policies then that might be a reason for (Nicola Sturgeon's) attitude to change about the referendum.\" - Scotland - 13:08 GMT - SNP advantage - Malcolm Harvey of Aberdeen University says the SNP will be looking to take full advantage of their stunning election win in Scotland. \"The SNP will obviously play on that they have won the election in Scotland -- the Conservatives only have one seat -- that on that basis the government doesn't have any legitimacy in Scotland,\" he predicts. \"That said the size of the Conservative majority is potentially going to be quite important... when you get midway through a parliament, you get by-elections, you have got the Tory awkward squad, Europe which can divide the Conservatives. If the Conservative party starts to fracture then you could see the SNP try and take advantage of that\". 13:01 GMT - EU issue - Christopher Howarth, a senior political analyst with Open Europe, says Cameron now faces three tests: securing the reforms he wants, persuading his MPs, and persuading the public. He is optimistic Cameron can persuade European partners of the need for reform as long as the PM doesn't go in \"banging the table for UK exceptionalism\". But: \"If he asks for too much, he might not get what he wants and look like a failure.

He tells the BBC: \"Certainly taking the results in so far, we've now got over 550 of them, our best guess is now that the Conservatives will get around 329 seats. \"It's been pretty clear for most of the night that David Cameron was certainly going to remain as prime minister but it now looks as though he won't even have to rely on the DUP. That said, however, we should bear in mind that he will have a very small majority.\" 06:15 GMT - Majority - Earlier we reported that the Conservative party is forecast to be one seat short of a clear majority, with a predicted 325 seats.

They just held onto Ceredigion in Wales. 00:34 GMT - Labour blow - The Conservatives have held onto Nuneaton in central England, and even increased their majority, despite Labour's fierce campaign there. Earlier polls had suggested Labour could win, lending credence to the television networks' exit poll showing a large national Conservative lead. 00:26 GMT - Kiss of death - While analysts may have different takes on the various permutations of coalition government possible, one thing is clear: joining forces with a large party could be lethal for a smaller one. The Lib Dems were riding high after the 2010 election, but their partnership with the centre-right Conservatives has proven poisonous, with voters accusing the left-leaning party of betrayal. 00:11 GMT - Labour's lament - Labour party grandee and former party leader Neil Kinnock was dismayed by the early exit poll: \"If it continues like this, it's one of great disappointment. Not so much for the party, but for what it means. \"Millions of people in Britain needed a government that would be committed to housing, to the health service to jobs and fresh opportunities for the youngsters. \"And if that government is not at the end of the day formed, then I think that Britain will pay a very severe price for the division in our society and the weakness in our economy.\" 00:07 GMT - Tooting toots - Tooting has declared, and Labour's Sadiq Khan has held on. In what is turning out to be a theme for this election, the Lib Dems were down 11 percent of their haul in 2010. 00:00 GMT - Story so far - Eight constituencies have declared, and so far there have been no big surprises among the winners. However, the big shock has been the collapse in Lib Dem support. The party has haemorrhaged votes and even suffered the ignominy of losing its deposit in two constituencies. An early exit poll put the Conservatives on 316 seats, just shy of a majority, and Labour on 239 seats. 23:46 GMT - Lib Dem collapse - Newcastle upon Tyne has just declared, and while Labour's hold on the constituency is not surprising, the Lib Dem result will bitterly disappoint the party. The party's share of the vote fell 22 percent, pushing it to fourth place. It came second in 2010. 23:42 GMT - Lib Dem blow - In a huge embarrassment to the Lib Dems, which for the last five years have ruled in coalition government with the Conservatives, the party has lost its deposit in at least two constituencies. The deposit for UK parliamentary elections is currently 500 pounds, which must be returned if a candidate fails to win five percent of the vote -- usually the fate of smaller, fringe parties. 23:39 GMT - - Lib Dems tumble - - 23:35 GMT - Second Conservative win - Justine Greening has just won in Putney, the first London seat. What is striking is the collapse in support for the Lib Dems there, down about 11 percent. 23:21 GMT - Fragmented politics 2 - A corollary of the success of smaller parties is the likelihood of renewed calls for a proportional representation (PR) voting system. The current system is first past the post, which tends to favour larger parties. The British public rejected changing to the PR system in a 2011 referendum, but attitudes may have changed since then. 22:52 GMT - Fragmented politics - A key feature of the this election is the expected success of smaller parties, particularly the SNP and UKIP. That makes coalition governments, once a rarity in Britain, more likely in future. Depending on which analysts you read, that could result in more consensual politics, or more unstable, fractious rule. 22:52 GMT - First Conservative win - Officials have just declared the first win for the Conservatives, Justin Tomlinson in Swindon North. Big cheers and a big smile. Four results through so far: three for Labour and one for the Conservatives. 22:51 GMT - Voter anger - Reports have come in that voting in some constituencies could be inaccurate due to problems with voter registration and ballot papers, AFP's Naomi O'Leary reports. Freya a 27-year-old TV producer voting in Hackney South and Shoreditch, arrived to the polling station to be told someone else had already voted in her name. \"I showed up with my polling card and they already had a pencil mark next to my name. They said that someone had voted under my name so they didn't know what to do,\" she said. 22:50 GMT - Newspaper front pages - Some initial front pages have come through and, as expected, the right-leaning Sun is gloating over forecasts of a Conservative win, while the left-leaning Mirror laments. The Sun has splashed the slogan \"Swinging the blues,\" over a picture of a smiling David Cameron, standing next to his wife Samantha. The Conservative party colour is blue. \"Cameron will hold on to power, say exit polls\" read the pro-Conservative Daily Telegraph, with a photograph showing a smiling Cameron. The left-leaning Mirror's front page is totally black, apart of from the following question in white typeface: \"Five more damned years?\" 22:48 GMT - Sterling ticks higher - The pound has strengthened somewhat, a move pundits put down to increased certainty after an initial exit poll put the Conservatives -- generally favoured by business -- ahead with 316 seats. 22:44 GMT - First election scalp? - Reports say senior Liberal Democrat lawmaker and chief secretary to the treasury has lost his seat. Watch this space ... 22:35 GMT - Question of legitimacy - With an exit poll pointing to no party with a clear majority, there is already talk that a party with fewer seats could seize power through forming the largest voting bloc in parliament. That has already raised questions of legitimacy - should a party with fewer seats hold sway over a larger party? 22:17 GMT - Cameron knife-edge - Labour finance spokesman Ed Balls says the BBC/Sky/ITV exit polls is a \"big surprise\" and is sceptical about its accuracy. \"Even if the exit poll is right, that means the Conservative-Liberal Democrat coalition majority has gone from 72 to zero. \"David Cameron's ability to hang on in Downing Street is on a knife edge.\" 22:16 GMT - Swings for UKIP - Although Labour may have won in the three seats declared so far, these were safe seats where the incumbents already had large majorities. However, the big news is the swing to UKIP in two of the three seats, where the party came second ahead of the Conservatives. 22:12 GMT - Two more for Labour - The next two seats have been declared, and they're both for Labour: one in Sunderland Central and the other in Sunderland West, both in northeast England. 22:04 GMT - Story so far - Polling has closed about 90 minutes, and initial exit polls suggest a huge lead for the Conservatives. Here's the story so far: - A BBC/Sky/ITV exit polls puts the Conservatives way ahead on 316 seats and Labour on 239 seats. That leaves the Conservatives within touching distance of 326, the number needed for majority rule. - The same exit poll forecasts electoral catastrophe for the Lib Dems, putting them on only 10 seats, down from 57. - The poll also confirms widely forecasted huge gains for the Scottish National Party. It says the party is set for 58 seats, all but one of Scotland's 59 seats. - A different poll, this time by pollster YouGov, puts the Conservatives on 284 seats, Labour on 263 seats, SNP on 48 seats, and Lib Dems on 31 seats. 21:48 GMT - City workers celebrate - Workers in the City, London's financial hub, cheered exit polls showing the Conservatives as the largest party. \"Why would you change? The economy is doing well after five years with the Conservatives,\" said City worker Grant, laughing. However, others are reserving judgement: \"It's still too close to call!\", said Chamary, a female City worker, pointing out that the Conservatives are likely to fall short of a majority on their own. 21:48 GMT - Hat and kilt eating - Lib Dem grandee Paddy Ashdown, looking at an exit poll that forecasts his party losing 47 seats, tells the BBC's Andrew Neil: \"If this exit poll is right Andrew, I will publicly eat my hat on your programme.\" Meanwhile, Alastair Campbell, former communications chief for Labour leader Tony Blair, says he'll eat his kilt if the first exit polls are correct. 21:47 GMT - Different poll - Another poll, this one by pollster YouGov, puts the Conservatives on 284 seats, Labour on 263 seats, SNP on 48 seats, and Lib Dems on 31 seats. The earlier poll was by television networks BBC, Sky and ITV. 21:47 GMT - Huge caution - SNP leader Nicola Sturgeon says on Twitter the exit polls should be treated with \"HUGE caution\". She added: \"I'm hoping for a good night but I think 58 seats is unlikely!\" 21:45 GMT - First result through - Huge cheers for Labour's Bridget Phillipson as the first constituency result comes through in Sunderland. Phillipson won comfortably with 21,218 votes in the safe Labour seat of Houghton and Sunderland South, way ahead of her nearest challenger on 8,280 votes. 21:43 GMT - Voting hiccups - Several local councils are under pressure due to mistakes in the voting process, AFP's Naomi O'Leary reports. Darlington council had to apologise after the name of a UKIP candidate was left off 89 ballot papers. Scores of people were unable to vote in Hackney after they registered to vote close to the deadline, and a technical error meant their forms could not be processed. 21:15 GMT - Clegg finished? - Patrick Dunleavy, professor of political science of the London School of Economics, told reporters: \"The coalition has proved existentially dangerous for the Liberal Democrats. Their whole existence as a party is now in severe jeopardy. \"If the exit poll is right, Clegg is finished as the Liberal Democrat leader, that's for sure. If you were a 10-MP party, there would be no way you could realistically negotiate with the Conservatives on 316. There's just no possibility of a coalition there.\" 21:03 GMT - Lib Dem disaster? - If initial exit polls are to be believed, the Liberal Democrats, or Lib Dems, face electoral disaster and are forecast to lose 47 seats. 21:00 GMT - SNP tremors - With a forecast of 58 seats after the first exit polls of today's election, the SNP volcano does indeed seem set to erupt. The party won only six seats in 2010, but now it seems set to make an almost clean sweep of Scotland's 59 seats, mostly at Labour's expense. - Exit poll analysis - 20:55 GMT - Truly knife-edge - Parties need 326 out of parliament's 650 seats to be able to pass laws without being defeated by their opponents. If the exit polls are correct, then the Conservatives on 316 seats and the Lib Dems on 10 seats could allow them to repeat the coalition that has ruled for the last five years. But only just.... 20:45 GMT - Exit poll in - The first exit poll after polling stations closed puts the Conservatives on 316 seats, Labour on 239 seats, the SNP on 58, the Lib Dems on 10 seats and UKIP on 2 seats. 20:45 GMT - EXIT POLLS PUT CONSERVATIVES AS LARGEST PARTY WITH 316 SEATS - Exit poll! - 19:01 GMT - Exit polls due soon - Polls close in a few minutes, so sit tight for the first exit polls due soon after. 17:17 GMT - High stakes - The election could claim some major scalps, with even some big name politicians at risk of losing their posts. UKIP leader Nigel Farage, whose jocular every-man persona has helped propel his anti-Europe, anti-immigration party from obscurity to a national contender, says he will quit if he does not win in South Thanet. Senior Liberal Democrat and Chief Secretary to the Treasury Danny Alexander is in danger of losing his seat, as is fellow Liberal Democrat Simon Hughes, Minister of State at the Ministry of Justice. 17:08 GMT - Financiers fret - In London's financial hub near the Tower of London, business men and women sip drinks and watch election coverage on a large-screen TV, AFP's Patrice Novotny reports. The Conservatives have traditionally been friendlier to big business than left-leaning Labour, but some firms fear that a Conservative win could herald Britain's exit from the European Union, a vital marketplace for British exports. The Conservative Party has struggled to reconcile and its pro and anti-Europe wings, and has promised a referendum on EU membership in 2017. - Election jitters - 16:48 GMT - Separate Scotland? - The SNP won six seats in the last parliamentary election, and forecasters say that number could increase almost tenfold after polling ends today. The party's main aim is for an independent Scotland, and analysts say a strong parliamentary presence could give it enough clout to push for another vote on the issue in future. 16:08 GMT - The Scottish question - Scotland has loomed large over this election, with the Scottish National Party (SNP) expected to all but obliterate Labour in what was once its stronghold. The SNP has long campaigned for independence, but last year Scottish voters decided to stay within the United Kingdom after a bitter referendum. However, the party has since seen its popularity and membership surge. Some views from Scottish voters on AFP's YouTube channel: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9cTrh3LNW8c - Scots vote - 14:49 GMT - Make or break - This general election has been derided as sterile and boring by many pundits as party leaders and their aides carefully control public appearances to avoid gaffes. However, the ballot could have huge repercussions for Britain's place in Europe, given the Conservatives have pledged to hold a referendum on whether to leave the European Union in 2017. 14:49 GMT - Weird polling stations - More than 45 million Britons are eligible to vote at polling stations located everywhere from shipping containers to churches, funeral parlours to pubs, a school bus, a windmill, a lido and a football ground. 14:49 GMT - Haggling looms.... - The end of voting is hardly the end of the story, with days or even weeks of negotiations expected after the polls close. Neither of the two main parties is expected to win a clear majority in Britain's 650-seat House of Commons, so a period of horse-trading is likely to begin as they try to form coalitions with smaller parties. 14:49 GMT - Final countdown - With less than two hours to go until polls close, competing parties aren't wasting a minute. The Labour party has tweeted an image of a clock counting down, while the Conservatives have tweeted a message touting their economic credentials. The Liberal Democrat (Lib Dem) leader Nick Clegg has tweeted about a \"Final last push\". 14:49 GMT - Neck and neck - Despite weeks of campaigning, television debates, radio interviews, and a slew of slogans and promises, the latest polls before today's election have refused to budge. Britain's two main parties, the Conservative Party and Labour were still virtually tied with around a third of the vote. The Liberal Democrats, the Conservatives' coalition partners, and the insurgent UK Independence Party were within spitting distance of each other, but both were barely breaking into double digits. 14:48 GMT - WELCOME TO AFP'S LIVE REPORT on Britain's knife-edge general election, which could put the country's membership of the European Union in doubt and could have profound implications for Scotland's future. Voters face a choice between Prime Minister David Cameron's centre-right Conservatives and Ed Miliband's centre-left Labour in the closest vote in decades. But while the leaders of both main parties insist they can win a clear majority in the 650-seat House of Commons, they will almost certainly have to work with smaller parties to form a government. Stay with AFP for all the latest news as the results come in."
