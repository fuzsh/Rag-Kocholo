        "text": "2023 marked the 10th anniversary of same sex marriage being legalised in England and Wales, and March 2024 is exactly a decade since the first wedding took place. To celebrate this momentous occasion, comedian, presenter and writer Tom Allen is pulling out all the stops to arrange a dream wedding for one gay couple.\n\nAdam and Dan are getting married, and Tom wants to get his full fairy godmother on to make it a wedding to remember. He enlists the help of celebrity friends including dancer Oti Mabuse, stylist Nick Hems, baker John Whaite and iconic Murder on the Dancefloor songstress Sophie Ellis-Bextor, who assist with everything from the entertainment to the outfits.\n\nAs Tom helps the lucky couple arrange the wedding of the year, he reveals the extraordinary story of the fight for equal marriage, meeting the LGBTQ+ trailblazers who helped make this day possible including Sandi Toksvig, Peter Tatchell, Lynn Sutcliffe and Sarah Hews. He also meets some of the political figures who were instrumental in the passing of the bill, including Dame Angela Eagle, Lynne Featherstone, and Lord David Cameron.\n\nIn the one-off film for BBC One and iPlayer, Tom will reflect on his own experiences of growing up gay as he considers how far LGBTQ+ rights have advanced. It will culminate in the wedding of the happy couple, in a joyous celebration of love, community and hard-won equality.\n\nTom Allen says: \"When I was growing up, the idea that gay people could be accepted by society, never mind get married was as mad as a sack of chihuahuas. Now every year, thousands same sex couples get married, and thatâs certainly something to celebrate. Now two people can say they love each other in front of their friends and families and have it recognised by all of us in society, and thatâs a wonderful thing.â\n\nAT2\n\nInterview with Tom Allen\n\nWhy did you want to throw one lucky couple the wedding of their dreams?\n\nWell firstly, I really enjoy telling people what to do. Any kind of high ceremony is very much my bag. I also thought it would be a great way to understand, first hand, the importance of what marriage actually is. Yes, weddings are ceremonies, heavy in symbolism and tradition, but they genuinely matter to people because they mean that a couple is recognised in law and that society deems them important. There have been times where, as a gay man, I have wondered, 'Well why do we need to be equal like this, when we can be... better?' but with something like marriage, it's a ritual that dates back thousands of years and so in being allowed to take part in it in the eyes of society and in the eyes of the law means more than just 'a wedding'. It's a much more profound symbol - a statement that we as gay people, are actually equal to others, worthy of relationships and deserving of the same rights as everyone else. In partaking in marriage we are part of the rest of the world and the history of humankind. Maybe that seems like a grand statement but for so much of history, queer people have been made to feel less than everyone else or outside of society. I think it has had a huge impact on mental health, self-esteem and our sense of self. So bringing same sex marriage into law has been hugely important.\n\nWhy was it important to also meet the trailblazers and people who paved the way to same sex marriage?\n\nIâve always loved learning about the past, no matter how recent it might be - after all, a society which doesnât learn its history is condemned to repeat it. I think talking to the people who helped bring about this change was a way to publicly acknowledge what theyâd done. With the activists, they often suffered a huge amount of prejudice and resistance. Iâve never been a fan of trite sayings and phrases like, âLove is Loveâ or, âLove Winsâ because I think it's much more important to see how history is seldom a straight line but instead fraught with steps forward and steps back all at the same time. Meeting the people who paved the way allowed me to see how difficult it had been. Complex matters require complex solutions if the long term goal is to be achieved and I think in our world today, we need to remember this now more than ever.\n\nWhat moved me the most was how the Marriage (Same Sex Couples) Act 2013, which made the marriage of same sex couples lawful in England and Wales, brought people together from different sides of the political divide. Despite the opposition from various corners, MPs and activists found a pragmatic way to come together to achieve their aim. In these polarised times, it felt very hopeful. So maybe the saying is right actually - love does win.\n\nWhat do you hope audiences take away from this documentary?\n\nI hope it's a sense of hope about what can be achieved when people work together. I hope it's an understanding of how difficult it has been, and continues to be, for queer people to exist in the world. Beyond that, I also hope it's a sense of gratitude for how far we have come, and to not take that for granted.\n\nHow have things changed in the last ten years, and how have they not?\n\nIt was upsetting to see footage of the parliamentary debates at the time and to see how open people were about their disdain for equality for same sex couples - I think, happily, I'd put it out of my mind how humiliating it was to have other people opine about what they thought we, as gay people, were entitled to. It was truly amazing to see how far things have come. However, I don't for a moment ignore how same sex relations and just being queer at all continue to be illegal for many around the world. For them, the idea of gay marriage might feel very far removed indeed. So as a world I hope we can continue to work together to achieve equality for all.\n\nMeet the happy couple: Adam Johnson and Dan Mackey\n\nTell us about yourselves, and how you metâ¦\n\nA&D: We first met in 2009 as 22 and 25 year olds through our mutual friend James (our best man on the wedding day) at a disco night held by our wedding DJ Boogaloo Stu.\n\nWe love living in the UKâs gay capital down in Brighton, (when we were younger, we both dreamt of one day living here). To complete our family we added our pug \"Egg\" in 2016. Both of us share a love of creativity and are always looking for the next adventure. Adam was a contestant on The Great Pottery Throwdown, most days we can be found together doing pottery, or craft in our little home studio that we sell online. We spend the whole day with each other almost seven days a week and we love it!\n\nD: I came out when I was 18 to my Mum with a letter after I struggled to say what I wanted in person. After that moment I regained the confidence and happiness I had lost being a closeted gay teen. Iâm very proud of being gay and the LGBTQ+ communityâs ability to be supportive, compassionate and creative.\n\nA: Coming out for me was a surreal situation. I was 22 when I was in a bad accident that left me in a coma in hospital. I woke up to find my family, friends and the guy I was seeing at the time all together, so my secret was out.\n\nWhy did you want to take part in this documentary?\n\nA: In our lifetimes we have seen a lot of important changes and the legalisation of gay marriage was a big one. This documentary celebrates an important moment for the LGBTQIA+ community and gave Dan and I the opportunity to share our love for each other in a loud and proud way. During my childhood as a queer kid I didnât think I had a future or that this would be possible. The programme is a chance to be visible and to celebrate together our desire to be within a society that chooses love over hate, where all couples in love are seen as equals.\n\nD: We have been together for 10 years and engaged for eight of those, so it felt like the perfect time to mark an event 10 years in the making (in all aspects). Weâre proud of being part of the LGBTQ+ community and the fight for equal rights. Being a gay couple, our love towards each other and acts of affection like holding hands or a kiss canât go unnoticed yet - whether itâs from people who hate it or support it, which is sometimes tough. Equal rights donât always feel safe or comfortable - so we wanted to put on a wedding thatâs unapologetically queer and visible. Celebrating how far we have come and how bright the future together will be.\n\nWhen dreaming of your big day, what most excited you?\n\nA: My dream day is one that reflects who me and Dan are, while bringing our family, friends and community together. It needed to be a celebration of queerness and we didnât want to be in dark suits or for there to be outdated traditions. We wanted to pledge our vows on a day which was colourful and where every single person would be comfortable. Both of us love anything handmade so we loved adding the personal touches which were everywhere! We painted our shoes ourselves, we built our own wedding arch, crafted every table display from pieces we already owned, painted flamingos for the lawn and our friends grew mushrooms for the bouquets.\n\nD: Both Adam and I love being creative and getting stuck in, making a dreamlike day come to life where we could break traditional wedding rules. As Iâm someone thatâs obsessed with cakes and desserts I was excited to be able get help to dream up a unique cake just for our wedding. The flavours, decoration and scale of this cake screams camp and fits our queer celebration.\n\nIn the documentary you talk about growing up before same sex marriage was legal. How has society changed?\n\nA: Growing up in a small town where the government spread messages of fear and division was horrible. Section 28 and its effects terrified me as a child and made me scared of being myself. Repressing a part of yourself means your friends and family donât get to meet the real you until you \"come out\" and for me that was when I was 22. 22 years not feeling like you can be totally yourself within the society you live in is not something I would wish upon anyone. To be able to finally be myself, love Dan and join our families by marriage surrounded by open hearts has been something that for a long time felt impossible.\n\nD: We both grew up in a time where we were led to be shameful of being gay. That section 28 was happening in those formative years at school made being gay feel impossible and lonely. I remember before I came out being very low and looking for a cure for being gay (I didnât know that it was conversion therapy at the time). Back then I couldnât imagine then finding a man I could completely love so much and being able to marry him. Lots has changed for the good but conversion therapy is sadly still legal which still makes lives tougher.\n\nWhat does this wedding mean to you?\n\nA: For me and Dan to be allowed a day where we can make a promise of love to each other and legally marry means everything. When we said our vows with our family and friends in such a public way it filled my soul with profound pride! It makes me hopeful for all queer people and shows that love always wins.\n\nBeing husbands is important as it means if anything were to happen to me, then Dan would be my legal next of kin and thatâs something that used to worry me.\n\nI remember a time when the TV filled me with fear and terror about being myself so it feels momentous to be able to have a chance and share a moment of love and hope for equality on the BBC.\n\nD: Iâm lucky to be close to my family so being able to stand in front of them with Adam and get married was a proud moment. Especially when so many people around the world still canât do this legally or have to distance themselves from family to live authentically. We got to create a safe queer bubble with the people we are closest to. It made me understand why weddings are magic moments where everyone feels loved up.\n\nMeet the contributors\n\nSandi Toksvig OBE\n\nSandi is a broadcaster, writer and activist for gender and LGBTQIA+ equality.
