        "text": "The Lib Dem MP, elected to her second term on May 6, will be a part of the new Government and taking over from Labour MP David Lammy, who represents Tottenham, who will now be in opposition.\n\nLabour supporters in Haringey, trade unionists and Mr Lammy himself, have said that Ms Featherstone is now the only hope for a borough which, they claim, has always lost out under a Tory government, now headed by Prime Minister David Cameron with Lib Dem leader Nick Clegg as his deputy.\n\nMs Featherstone said she was up to the challenge, and expressed her dismay that her party was not able to strike a deal with Labour, who sit closer ideologically, which she blamed on the divisions within the outgoing party.\n\nDespite this, she said, she was optimistic about the coalition, which she said would not compromise her mission to fight for the best deal for her constituents, and said she would \"certainly be willing\" to work with David Lammy on issues that affected their neighbouring constituencies.\n\nSpeaking of the coalition, Ms Featherstone said: \"There will be some things that will be unpalatable. There are clear differences between our two parties such as our position on our role in Europe.\n\n\"Nick Clegg has struck a very good deal. We will deliver the key pledges in our manifesto such as raising the tax threshold for the lowest earners up to £10,000 and fairer funding for our schools. There is also some positive steps towards electoral reform. These are reasons why people voted Lib Dem, and we are able to honour that. No deal would have been struck if those things weren't on the table.\"\n\nShe added: \"The main thing to remember is that this is not a Tory government, this is a coalition government. Having a Lib Dem voice in Government means we will be able to temper and take the edges off the Tory policies that people might be most afraid of. I am hopeful will see an influence of the best of the Lib Dem policies, and less of the worst Tory policies.\"\n\nThroughout the negotiations, the MP said her party had been informed \"magnificently\" with serious discussion among her colleagues, culminating with unanimous support for the coalition.\n\nShe said: \"Many of us are still not sure how this will change our day-to-day life in parliament, but I have been elected to represent the people of Hornsey and Wood Green and will continue to fight for fairness and for the protection of front line services. It is so important that in Haringey, a borough that has so many needs, still has a voice in Government. That is my mission.\"\n\nMs Featherstone, one of the few elected Lib Dems in the capital and one of its most popular, said she had hoped there might be an offer of a cabinet post, but acknowledged that positions had gone to the most experienced Lib Dem heavyweights.\n\nShe had been the leader of the opposition in Haringey Council before becoming an MP.\n\nMr Lammy, currently settling into his Tottenham office, said he was sceptical about the influence the Lib Dems would have, but would be watching the Government very closely.\n\nHe said: \"Many of us remember what Tottenham was like under the Tories in the Eighties, and it wasn't good. The Labour government made vast improvements to the lives of ordinary people and helping to address the distribution of wealth. I hope Lynne Featherstone, who is now a part of the new Government, will make good on her promises to fight for frontline services and secure fairer funding for our schools.\n\nThe MP added: \"I relish the opportunity to be a backbench opposition MP. I may not have been as present in Tottenham as I would have liked in the past, but I was always representing Tottenham parliament and pushing for measures to improve the lives of my constituents.\n\nPaying tribute to the former PM and party leader Gordon Brown, who resigned on Tuesday, Mr Lammy said: \"Right now people might call him the least successful PM we've ever had, but history will not look back on him that way. He will be remembered as one of the most successful chancellors of the 20th century.\n\n\"Anyone who walks into one of the fantastic children's centres introduced under Labour, and not the cramped nurseries found on the top of a tower block we used to have, needs to thank Gordon Brown. For the past 20 years, he was a vital member of the party, and his contribution should not be undermined.\""
