        "text": "I went yesterday to give the oration at the planting of a Wild Cherry Tree in memory of Joan Schwitzer who was a historian and Founder Member of the Hornsey Historical Society and of the Friends of Hornsey Church Tower.\n\nI had met Mat Schwitzer only recently when my office told me that I had to go to his house for a ‘chat’. All I can say is that we had a very pleasant half an hour philosophical discussion over a whole range of issues – and that whilst Mr Schwitzer may be old – he is very, very charming and persuasive. Hence I found myself in St Mary Churchyard giving the oration!\n\nAnd I was really delighted and honoured to be able to do so – as Joan was an exceptional women who was part of the Big Society long before David Cameron was born. I paste below the oration – albeit that in speaking it was not precisely as written.\n\nJoan’s family were all there – and with a loving husband of 62 years, Mat, four children, six grandchildren and aunts, uncles and cousins – their presence and the planting of a tree in her memory was a very fitting and very fine tribute to an outstanding woman and member of our local community.\n\n– a Cherry tree has to be the loveliest way to commemorate her\n\n– Very honoured to be here today and to speak and remember the life and wonderful influence of Joan\n\n– I met Mat only recently when he invited me to his house – for a chat\n\n– Of course Mat is a complete charmer – as you can see by my being here today, and as I sat in his front room which was Joan’s front room and the family house for decades it was clear to me that here had lived, not only a happy family and a couple whose relationship had been longlasting – but a woman who acted on her convictions that what you do and how you are in life matters\n\n– Joan was an active member of the liberal party – and campaigned during most of the local and national elections in the 60s and 70s\n\n– She continued to the end of her life to be interested and concerned and active on issues important to her. She and I were in communication over Trident in the year before she died. It’s not a huge success – but since then although we have not managed to scrap Trident the decision to renew is at least kicked back for five years.\n\n– Joan and Mat’s grandson Edward did work experience in my office in the summer of 2008 – and earlier this year I was judging a debateing competition and one of the competitors came up to me in a break and said he had done work experience for me – it was of course – Edward.\n\n– Who went on to win the London national and international conpetitions and presented with silver mace by ironically Charles Kennedy after the final in Glasgow .\n\n– And today I meet Joan’s children for the first time – and to you and to Mat I say your mother was an extraordinary woman – I didn’t know her – but it is clear from speaking to people about coming here to day that she was much loved by this community as well as you her family\n\n– Only this week, I went to give the prize to the winner of my xmas card competition where local primary school children paint a card and one becomes my Christmas card.\n\n– And I met the winner, amazing name, Zoom Rockerman and his parents – and his mother is helping at the Hornsey Historical Society and I mentioned that I was doing this today – and she just went into a tribute to Joan – to her work for the society – to her as a person\n\n– The love, respect and warmth for Joan is the real tribute to her life – a life well lived. Clearly an exceptional woman – with an independent mind. She was the embodiment of what the world needs now – a parent who loves their family, bring them up with encouragement to be who they want to be – but have that outward looking perspective too – that what goes on in the world matters and that it is all of our responsibility to make the world work and to make the world a better place.\n\n– She taught at St Michael’s school, helping with special needs children – and I grew up next door to St Michaels in a block of flats called Highpoint. And whilst today they are regarded as quite posh – historically speaking – they were developed as worker flats for the Gestetner company staff. Designed by Lubetkin and if you ever go around the back identical to the penguin pool at London Zoo – designed by the same famous modernist architect. I wish Joan had written a history of that block too.\n\n– She was of course, passionate about local history and indeed wrote a history of st Michaels School itself.\n\n– And then of course – there is the Hornsey Historical Society – that I referred to before. In its founding she planted an acorn – and needless to say – that is today a sturdy oak tree.\n\n– The British Association for Local History presented Joan with an award for personal achievement.\n\n– I can only really read out what the Society itself said of Joan\n\nWe all gained immensely from her change of direction to local history. Joan Schwitzer served as chairman from 1974 to 1985 during which time she used her abilities, enthusiasm and energy to make the society an active force in the borough and in local history circles. As one of her referees has written, Joan had the vision to see that in order for the Society to play a significant role it needed to have both a regular publication and its own premises. Another comment labels the latter as ‘her greatest achievement’. In the face of considerable opposition, she used her negotiating skills and her diplomacy to seize the opportunity to lease (at a peppercorn rent) from the local council a small redundant nineteenth century school building, then serving as a bus shelter. After organising and encouraging other members to fund-raise and volunteer in other ways, the Old Schoolhouse in Tottenham Lane has become a centre for the Society, for housing exhibitions, archives, publications storage, a shop, local history evening classes and oral history sessions.\n\nI could go on as there is a mountain of praise for Joan from many quarters. But I want to look at her life from my perspective for a moment – I am Minister for Equalities – and Joan’s life is a truly inspiring message for women today. It was a different era – but she was clearly an environmentalist – composting long before most people even heard of the word and using a bicycle as her preferred mode of transport. She was passionate about world issues – nuclear energy and nuclear weapons.\n\nBut it was, from what I have learned about Joan’s life, her commitment to community, to causes that was so deeply ingrained as part of her being that seems to have been a mission in her life.\n\nJoan was a pioneer of the early days of oral histories and there is a sizeable bank of recorded interviews that are a resource for historians today – and are part of the archives collection at the Old Schoolhouse today.\n\nIn this current climate, where there will be hardship and loss, it is that sense of something beyond our own four walls to which we can contribute – something outside of our own situations – that perhaps is the positive that we can hang on to.\n\nWe in Haringey and Hornsey have always had community. There are many many good people who strive and work and volunteer to make life better for others around them – who fight for causes against the odds, who believe in a society where people are the most important asset on this earth – and buildings – of course!\n\nJoan Schwitzer was clearly an outstanding member of our community who led by example, shared her enthusiasms and gave so much to us.We are grateful for her life so well lived.\n\n62 years together – Mat and Joan. I am not sure how one bears the loss of a beloved partner after that length of time together – but it is the price you pay for having a lifelong love – a price worth paying.\n\nTo Mat and to the children and grandchildren family and friends – whilst you must all miss Joan terribly – you can be very proud of the woman she was.\n\nToday is International Day for the Elimination of Violence against Women – and the day that the coalition government published our cross-government plans to tackle violence against women and girls.\n\nThe Home Secretary has allocated more than £28 million for specialist services to tackle violence against women and girls – running up to 2015. These specialist services which support victims of sexual and domestic violence will continue to receive central Home Office funding – including local domestic and sexual violence advisors, services for high risk domestic violence victims , national helplines and work to prevent forced marriage.\n\nThis is my portfolio too (as of about six weeks ago) and this cross-government vision and long term priorities for tackling violence against women and girls will be followed up by a full plan of action next spring. There are four key areas that we will focus on. The prevention of violence including reducing repeat victimisation, the provision of support, the bringing together of groups to work in partnership and action to reduce risk by ensuring that perpetrators are brought to justice.\n\nFor the first time the strategy brings together work to tackle violence against women in the UK with details of the international approach to tackle this global problem. In fact that includes my own appointment, announced today, as Overseas Champion to lead on the UK’s international work.\n\nThis is a departure from the narrow focus of previous strategies – where whilst continuing the pressure to bring perpetrators to justice – we put a big emphasis on changing and challenging behaviours and attitudes. We need early intervention – making sure young people understand the importance of healthy relationships and respecting the right to say no.\n\nWe put emphasis too on the importance of training for professionals and front line staff to spot early signs and risk factors of domestic and sexual violence, child sex abuse and harmful practises – including a new e-learning training course for GPs on violence against women and children.\n\nThere are new powers to help domestic violence victims break the cycle of abuse including piloting in three areas Domestic Violence Protection Orders (DVPO). Until now – post a domestic violence incident – it has been the abused partner and the children who have had to leave the home and seek refuge elsewhere. These civil orders enable the police to use their judgement to issue a DVPO where it is then the perpetrator of the violence post an incident who has to leave the vicinity. This is decided at super-intendent level and is for 48 hours at which point it can be extended to between 14 and 28 days – subject to a magistrate’s decision. This applies equally to men as to women.\n\nInternationally it’s about supporting innovative new projects in the poorest countries and working with international organisations and governments overseas to promote women’s rights globally and reduce the impact of conflict on women and girls.\n\nDomestic violence is sadly an everyday occurrence. Last year there were more than one million female victims of domestic violence in England and Wales – nearly two women each minute. And every week two of those women lose their lives. Each year 300,000 women were sexually assaulted and 60,000 women were raped. It is a shaming indictment of the way we are.\n\nThis is a priority for the coalition government – and for me!\n\nFirstly apologies as this post is out of time sequence as Social Enterprise Day was last Thursday – but social enterprise is such an important component of the power shift that will come about in the next few years that I wanted to note it here.\n\nNick Hurd – Minister for Civil Society – who is leading on Social Enterprise and the Voluntary Sector’s transformation into the Big Society asked ministers to go out on Thursday to visit a local Social Enterprise.\n\nSo – naturally – I visited the Selby Centre. This is an amazing model of how this new Big Society might work. Sona Mahtani – who is the amazing woman who runs the whole thing (and injects her energy and enthusiasm tirelessly) – had gathered various of the enterprises who operate from the Selby Centre so that they could all tell me what they do and what their vision was for the future of their social enterprise.\n\nWhat an impressive group. There was Gareth – who had started a school for young ones because he wanted young black children to achieve. They all go on to other schools ultimately where there results have been staggering – and he is now thinking about perhaps going the Free School route. There was a recycling wood enterprise and coming in I saw one of their products – a bench and table – of such beauty and skill you can’t imagine. They skill young people – several of whom are ex-offenders – and then they are able to seek work. There was a group who support people with disabilities into work. There was another that helped with language and basic IT skills – training to work – and much more. Selby is host to around 1500 people each day who come there to the various activities that go on there.\n\nI was so impressed with what was going on I actually spoke to Nick Hurd the very next day about coming to visit the Selby Centre if possible (I’m sure everyone will want him to come to their operation) but I hear so often the refrain that the Big Society will be alright in middle-class areas where the chattering classes will know how to do it – but poorer areas will be left out. The Selby Centre absolutely contradicts this. In fact – it’s the direct opposite – where people have come together to make things happen for themselves in this area of high diversity and relative disadvantage. I was blown away by the commitment and determination in that room.\n\nThanks to everyone who gave up their time to meet me and demonstrate so clearly – that the Big Society already exists – it just needs more encouragement and support. Funding is the key issue – and in the two years between now and the Big Society Bank taking off – there is a transition fund of £100million (but that is for sums of £50,000 and upwards). Elizabeth Henry (the CEO of Race on the Agenda) who is on the Board of Selby raised the fact that there is a community fund being created for smaller sums. There is also a £1.4billion regional fund and the govenrment has commissioned work to reduce the amount of bureaucracy involved for these small social enterprises to cut down on red tape.\n\nThis is just the beginning."
