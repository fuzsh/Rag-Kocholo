        "text": "EXCLUSIVE INTERVIEW: PM warns deadlock in the result would bring UK to a 'juddering halt'\n\nLooking ahead: David Cameron talks to the Standard today Picture: Jeremy Selwyn\n\nDavid Cameron today warns that Britain risks “juddering to a halt” if the general election ends in unprecedented deadlock.\n\nThe Prime Minister appealed to voters to back him as the only leader capable of winning a Commons majority on May 7. He told the Evening Standard: “I think there is a risk to Britain from, as I put it, if government comes to a shuddering halt you can find parts of the economy coming to a juddering halt.”\n\nWith Labour set to lose most of its 41 Scottish MPs in an SNP bloodbath, experts say the outcome could leave no party able to muster a stable majority, even in coalition. Mr Cameron said: “We were lucky in a way, in 2010, that it was possible to put together a strong government relatively quickly. But there’s absolutely no guarantee that can happen again with all the uncertainties and instabilities of what’s happening in Scotland.”\n\nToday the two main parties clashed over tax and spending. Ed Miliband accused the Tories of a “secret plan” to slash tax credits for working families. The Premier pledged a law to guarantee no tax hikes for five years.\n\nIn his interview, the Prime Minister dropped his biggest hints yet that he sees Boris Johnson as a Conservative leader-in-waiting. He said Mr Johnson would serve “at the highest level” and it was “good” that mayors become prime ministers in other countries.\n\nHe also hinted Mr Johnson could get the infrastructure job in Cabinet that he has lobbied for.\n\nThe Prime Minister made a plea for the extra 23 seats he needs for a majority, warning that there was no guarantee of a quick resolution if the election fails to produce a decisive winner\n\nHe fielded questions about Heathrow, his retirement, City fears of a “Brexit”, and “Milifandom”. Mr Cameron’s plea for the extra 23 seats he needs for a majority came after he toured Kelvin Hughes, a radar company in Enfield.\n\nHe said it was exactly the sort of firm that needed strong government: “This is a business that wants us to get out there and help sell its wares.”\n\nAfter another fiery speech in shirt-sleeves, he conceded he needed to let people see how “passionate” he was more often: “Sometimes we need to lift our head up from under the car bonnet and shout about how great the car is.”\n\nAsked what job the Mayor of London may get if elected as an MP, and after his second term ends in 2016, Mr Cameron said: “I haven’t got a specific job in mind but Boris has got a huge amount of talent and a great track record of running London. I think he can make a contribution at the highest level.”\n\nAn economic brief or something like party chairman? Choosing his words, he said Mr Johnson had “big vision about projects that can really transform a city and a country” and “we want to make sure we’ve got his vision and expertise harnessed to the government.”\n\nIt will be read by the Mayor’s supporters as a hint of the infrastructure role he has been lobbying for.\n\nUnprompted, the PM later returned to the subject: “Coming back to Boris, I think it is quite exciting that someone who has been Mayor of the greatest city on earth wants to come back into the House of Commons and serve at the national level. You often see that in other countries.”\n\nHe added hypothetically: “You see the mayor of Stockholm becomes the Swedish prime minister, or what have you, this is good.”\n\nMr Cameron attempted to reassure Londoners on his policy positions, including concerns in major firms that he has opened the risk of a British exit from the EU by pledging an in-out referendum. He argued that doing nothing to address concerns about the EU would create a bigger risk of “Brexit”, while many firms were saying “this guy has a plan ... let’s get on with it, let’s get a good deal and have the referendum”.\n\nAsked if Ed Miliband’s opposition to a referendum was resonating with the City, he retorted that the Tories were getting more business backing than at any election in memory. “Labour really struggled to produce business leaders to say Ed Miliband should be trusted with the economy,” he added.\n\nOn Heathrow, his position has moved from opposing a third runway to saying maybe. Wasn’t that bound to unnerve west Londoners? Mr Cameron pleaded that the Davies Commission, due to report in July, would be even-handed: “I think ... there’s a fair process taking place with a very talented individual ... determined to look at the evidence.”\n\nAsked to explain why he values the very rich, including non-doms, he said: “What I value is people making a contribution. Look, I want the rich to pay more tax, right? Under this government they are. The richest one per cent of earners pay 27 per cent of total income tax. That’s more than when Ed Miliband and Ed Balls sat in the Treasury.”\n\nHe cited capital gains tax, stamp duty re-forms, and the tax on mansions bought through companies, as measures that have plucked more from the wealthy.\n\nAfter calling his new pumped-up style “bloody lively” this week, did he get into trouble at home for swearing? “Err, Samantha is very forgiving,” he said guiltily. “My children are very well behaved, they know what these words are, and if ever I use one at home they chastise me.”\n\nHis older children Nancy and Elwen appear to be disciplinarians. “They probably get it from me; they are strong willed, quite opinionated. I encourage that.” The PM said an election victory was “do-able” but people were only just “engaging, understanding the risks”.”\n\nWas he jealous of Milifandom, the apparent craze among teenage girls for the Labour leader? Mr Cameron claimed he had “not had time to explore that front” , but strongly recommended a Conservative Friends of India musical tribute on YouTube as “a real treat”.\n\nHe insisted he would serve “a full second term” and asked if he would still be PM in May 2020 he replied: “We will cross that bridge when we get to it.”\n\nRead More\n\nElection 2015: 'Vote Name Surname,' east London Tory's campaign leaflet urges\n\nGeneral election constituency focus: Muswell Hill, where voters say Lib Dem Lynne Featherstone is fantastic - but they can't back her\n\nGeneral election constituency focus: Boris Johnson takes command in the Uxbridge Battle of Britain bunker\n\nThank you for registering\n\nPlease refresh the page or navigate to another page on the site to be automatically logged in"
