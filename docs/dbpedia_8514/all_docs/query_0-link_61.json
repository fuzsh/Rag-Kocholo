        "text": "The one-time BBYO leader, Grant Shapps, has been appointed Housing Minister in David Cameronâ€™s new government.\n\nMr Shapps, who represents Welwyn and Hatfield, is a former vice-chairman of the Conservative Party. He will be part of the Department for Communities and Local Government, headed by Eric Pickles.\n\nOliver Letwin, once Shadow Chancellor when Michael Howard led the party, has been made Minister of State for Policy, and will attend cabinet meetings when required.\n\nOn the Opposition benches, former Foreign Secretary David Miliband has announced his intention to run for Labour leader in a contest which could become a family affair.\n\nHis younger brother, Ed Miliband, former Energy and Climate Change Secretary, may also join him in the leadership race.\n\nThe Milibands are the sons of prominent Jewish Marxist historian Ralph Miliband, who was forced to flee his native Poland to Belgium and then London to escape the Nazi invasion.\n\nEd Miliband has apparently already warned his mother, Marion Kozak, that he may stand against his brother.\n\nWHO ARE THE JEWISH MPS?\n\nCONSERVATIVE\n\nJohn Bercow\n\nJonathan Djanogly\n\nMichael Ellis\n\nMichael Fabricant\n\nRobert Halfon\n\nRichard Harrington\n\nOliver Letwin\n\nJulian Lewis\n\nBrooks Newmark\n\nSir Malcolm Rifkind\n\nLee Scott\n\nGrant Shapps\n\nLIBERAL DEMOCRATS\n\nLynne Featherstone\n\nJulian Huppert"
