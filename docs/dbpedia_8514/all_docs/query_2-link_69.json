        "text": "Thank you for your response (and support) Lena.\n\nJust to re-assure you: I would never have permitted any son of mine to be circumcised as a child (adults have choice) unless there was pressing medical reason; and as I said, I agree absolutely that there are fundamental human rights issues here, a well as medical ones.\n\nSo my comment about difference is not based on ‘ignorance’; but it is based on mortality rates.\n\nNO baby or child should ever be subjected to unnecessary risk of illness or death, or to possible later avoidable problems of a personal / sexual nature, and my assessment (as a non-medic) is that MGM does carry a degree of risk, even though some medical authorities promote it as a requirement for future disease prevention.\n\nMale circumcision may possibly have been advantageous historically (I’m not at all sure, even then..) in the desert where sand is plentiful and water is not, but there are much, much ‘better’ ways to tackle any disorders of the male sexual organs now.\n\nMortality rates for MGM are mercifully very low – though let me emphasise again that even one single child, boy or girl, imperilled is *infinitely* too many – but for FGM, death rates are appallingly high – it amounts to ‘culturally’ imposed regular murder.\n\nMGM, wrong though it is, is usually – though sadly I know not always – a controlled, sanitized and routinized ‘procedure’; FGM is undertaken in dreadful, unhygienic and very dangerous conditions. That’s the reason I say they are not comparable.\n\nYou have written thoughtfully and courteously, but I am constantly attacked (and it can be really nasty and troll-ish) by those who want to say, ‘What about the men?’, but there is no need for that at all.\n\nMy concern is simply that most people don’t understand how cruelly young girls’ lives are routinely destroyed by FGM: they think FGM is, in their words, ‘just a nick’ and that it’s nothing more. They think too that they know about MGM (they probably don’t) and they almost certainly know a lot of men who had it done and seem unconcerned, but as you say, things are not that simple.\n\nMGM is I understand the most common surgical procedure in the USA – where doctors are paid to do it directly and there is no NHS – but it is mercifully quite unusual now in Britain, at least outside a few communities, though most boy children in my generation had it done even in the UK, and it diminished as a practice just a few decades ago. I don’t know the data for Denmark, so if you’d like to add further information as Comment under my MGM posts, also on this website, that would be very helpful:\n\nFemale Genital Mutilation: The Difficult Debates\n\nThe Other FGM Debate: Is Male Circumcision Also Child Abuse?\n\nI don’t think I belittle MGM by pointing out the horrendous mortality / morbidity rates (both for the girls themselves and, later, for their babies)associated with FGM; I certainly don’t intend to!\n\nOnce again, I agree with (and support) you on the subject of MGM and have said so many times, on Twitter and elsewhere as well as here. That is why I have also addressed MGM on this website. My focus for now is FGM because most people won’t / can’t bear even to think about it, and so many little girls die as a result, but I also tweet information from MGM / intactivist organisations in the UK, USA etc to help their cause along.\n\nAs it happens, I have a daughter and no sons, but I would never have allowed any son of mine to be circumcised. I hope that settles your mind about my support for your position on MGM!\n\nThank you for your comments, and very best wishes,\n\nHilary\n\nPS Could I ask that, if you – or others – would like to continue this conversation, you do so via the posts above, specifically on MGM? (I will move any further remarks on MGM which appear via this link to the appropriate MGM post, for clarity of the various threads on this website.) Thanks again."
