        "text": "WHILE YOU WERE SLEEPING: Colorado’s Supreme Court ruled Donald Trump is “disqualified from holding the office of president” after he “engaged in insurrection” over the 2020 election result. His campaign is now filing a “swift” appeal that could elevate the whole saga to the U.S. Supreme Court. Get your popcorn and read my Stateside colleagues here.\n\nGood Wednesday morning. This is Dan Bloom.\n\nDRIVING THE DAY\n\nNIGHTMARE AFTER CHRISTMAS: Just when you thought it was safe to slide off into recess, news arrives (again) of a tricky by-election for Rishi Sunak — that restive MPs will (again) use as a proxy for the PM’s performance entering an election year.\n\nBone out: It’s on in Wellingborough after suspended Conservative Peter Bone — who a panel found broke bullying and sexual misconduct rules — was ousted in a recall petition.\n\n**A message from Kenvue: Kenvue is the world’s largest pure-play consumer health company by revenue. We realise the power of everyday care and are committed to putting people first. We’re passionate about innovation, making an impact, and using our leading science and knowledge to support improvements in public health, including through smoking cessation.**\n\nMark your diaries: The writ can only be moved once the Commons returns on January 8. If the Conservatives (who control the timing) decide to go as early as possible, the by-election could be on February 8, Playbook is told.\n\nNOT ANOTHER ONE! At first glance the Northamptonshire seat is true-blue — Bone won it from Labour with a 687 majority in 2005, which he beefed up to 18,540 by 2019. But given the 18 percent swing that Labour needs is less than it got in Tamworth, Selby and Mid Bedfordshire, pressure will be on leader Keir Starmer to pull off another “shock” win.\n\nLowering expectations: One Tory MP tells Playbook: “In other by-elections we didn’t have the data. Peter has worked the seat really hard, so we shouldn’t have that problem. But I still think we’ll lose it. People just aren’t coming out, and it’s not ‘we hate the party but we like Rishi’ any more. They don’t like him either.” The Conservatives are yet to select a candidate.\n\nStoking expectations: Labour is running at it hard — picking its candidate in a blink-and-miss-it 24-hour application process last month, sending frontbenchers including Rachel Reeves to the doorstep, and already choosing shadow minister Toby Perkins to manage the campaign, focused on knife crime, NHS and potholes. His frontbench colleague Jonathan Ashworth is due on the ground with media in tow today. But …\n\nClose to the Bone: Only 13.2 percent of eligible voters signed the recall petition, fewer than in Peterborough, Brecon and Rutherglen (which, TBF, all involved MPs with criminal convictions — not the case here). The Economist’s Matthew Holehouse chatted to some of the signers and tweets that they were “mostly under 40” and “never fans of Bone.”\n\nSo let’s ask him: Polling guru John Curtice tells Playbook it is both an uphill battle for Labour … *and* they might expect to win it. He says the 18 percent swing needed is more than shown in current polling — but would reflect recent by-election results and continue to establish a pattern of a “vulnerable” government. If, on the other hand, the Conservatives hold it with a swing of 10 percent to Labour, “they would be doing very well,” Curtice adds.\n\nCROSS BONE: Bone himself didn’t rule out running as an independent (which he’s allowed to do) in a statement that called allegations against him “totally untrue.” He said he will have “more to say” in the new year.\n\nBone of contention: Bone said the result shows “86.6 percent of the electorate did not want to remove me.” Someone tell this guy about evidence of absence.\n\nSpotted: Bone in conversation with allies in PCH two hours before the petition shut.\n\nBONE IDLE: The Lib Dems fought hard in Mid Beds 30 miles away, but here the party has only 7.9 percent of the vote (to Labour’s 26.5 percent). A party strategist tells Playbook “this one’s for Labour” and insiders feel “we need to start focusing more on our target seats,” instead of chasing long-shot by-elections, as the general election gets closer.\n\nSnap profile: Labour has selected Gen (short for Genevieve) Kitchen, 28, who works raising six-figure gifts from big donors for charities like Sarcoma U.K. The daughter of two Royal Navy personnel grew up in Potterspury in next-door seat South Northamptonshire, where she was one of the party’s youngest general election candidates in 2019. Back then she was one of 193 candidates who pledged to “campaign to remain in the EU” if there was a confirmatory referendum. Four years is a long time in politics, eh?\n\nWHAT IT’LL ALL MEAN: In the long term, not much, says Curtice — it’s only one by-election. But in the short term it’ll be read as yet more evidence of the overall direction — proof of whether a hard focus on immigration and “long-term decisions for a brighter future” can turn the electorate back to the Tories. Or as Curtice puts it: “The problem they face is that the opinion polls suggest we’ve had umpteen initiatives since September, not one of which has made the slightest bit of difference.”\n\nMeanwhile: Remember Bone helped Sunak keep up a majority of 44 in the Rwanda bill vote. Every little helps the rebels. But that’s one for another day.\n\nMEANWHILE IN DOWNING STREET\n\nHOLIDAYS ARE COMING: With life-or-death issues ever swirling (see below), Sunak took a brief break on Tuesday night … to have a blast at a British Film Institute reception in Downing Street. The Star Wars fan held Luke Skywalker’s lightsaber, and had his love of schmaltz indulged via music from Love Actually on the staircase. One attendee said actor Joanna Scanlan (The Thick of It’s useless spinner Terri Coverley) was “a hit” with those members of the No. 10 press team who weren’t at their Christmas dinner. Write your own jokes …\n\nSpeaking of jokes: Sunak told attendees he was “pleasantly surprised” to be confused with pointy-jawed 27-year-old actor Timothée Chalamet — “at least, I think that’s why they shouted Wonka at me in the street.”\n\nEven funnier? The PM told producers and studio execs Britain’s the place to invest because “we’ve got low taxes.” For creative industries, mind. Don’t mention fiscal drag …\n\nHangover for teetotal PM: Sunak is holding a meeting of his “business council” in Downing Street today (he returns to Yorkshire at the end of the week). Past attendees have included Aviva, Sainsbury’s, BAE Systems and AstraZeneca.\n\nA MUCH BIGGER HANGOVER: The crisis in the Red Sea — where Houthi rebels in Yemen have stepped up attacks on commercial vessels — risks rocketing up news lists and the PM’s agenda in the lead-up to Christmas (POLITICO explainer here). Royal Navy Destroyer HMS Diamond joined a U.S.-led task force to protect merchant shipping on Tuesday, and HMS Lancaster is in the area and could follow. But already there is talk that it won’t be enough.\n\nNext step? Bloomberg’s Kitty Donaldson and team report that the U.S. “and its allies” are considering possible military strikes against Houthi rebels. The Telegraph hears similar.\n\nAll geopolitics is local: With BP halting all shipments of oil and gas through the Red Sea, and the International Chamber of Shipping suggesting the alternative is a 5,000-mile detour, Downing Street said on Tuesday afternoon “it is too early” to predict any impacts on the economy in the U.K. Gulp.\n\nISRAEL/GAZA CRISIS: The U.N. Security Council is now due to vote on a resolution to halt hostilities from 4 p.m. U.K. time today, after it was delayed again amid wranglings over the text.\n\nOn the ground: Foreign Secretary David Cameron is visiting Jordan and Egypt to talk about humanitarian support for Gaza, after urging Israel to take a “much more surgical, clinical and targeted approach” in dealing with Hamas. The Guardian splashes on the Hamas-run Gaza health ministry warning Palestinian deaths have neared 20,000.\n\nAlso wading in: Ex-PM Tony Blair, who Foreign Office Minister Andrew Mitchell told MPs is expected to meet Israeli PM Benjamin Netanyahu “shortly.” It gets pick-up in the Times.\n\nHolding the line: Cameron and Sunak both pushed the newish wording of a “sustainable cease-fire” — which means Hamas freeing hostages, and not being able to launch attacks from underground tunnels.\n\nCOMING DETRACTIONS: Another thing on the PM’s mind will be MPs putting on their thinking caps about his Rwanda bill as they head off to recess, ahead of a date-TBC committee stage in the new year. For a taste of the danger ahead, Sunak need only look to Paris. Centrist President Emmanuel Macron’s government is in crisis after toughened-up immigration reforms passed through parliament overnight — but with the help of far-right leader Marine Le Pen, who called them an “ideological victory.”\n\nLes Une Nations: Health Minister Aurélien Rousseau handed in his resignation shortly before 1 a.m. and five other ministers met to discuss whether to resign jointly, my Brussels Playbook colleague Jakob Hanke Vela emails to say. Details of the law and what it means for Macron from POLITICO’s Clea Caulcutt here, with the BBC reporting it still hangs in the balance as the French president could go back to the drawing board.\n\nA detail in the meantime: The Times picks up on Home Secretary James Cleverly’s evidence to a Lords committee on Tuesday night, where he accepted the “initial tranche” of people sent to Rwanda will have to be a number “manageable” to the country’s government. Which raises the prospect that, even if flights to Rwanda are successful, only a relatively small number of people will have been put on them by election time.\n\nBUT AT LEAST … The PM can check off a 90-minute grilling by parliament’s Liaison Committee without having made major news.\n\nSketch-writers’ verdict: The Times’ Tom Peck says Sunak turned from “tetchy Rishi” to “arrogant nerd” … the Guardian’s John Crace (who is trying to make “Rish!” happen) says “in every smile there’s the trace of contempt” … and the Mail’s Quentin Letts is more miffed by the “windy has-beens” who interrogated the PM. Oh, and the i rounded up six questions he couldn’t answer (including if there are any planes to take people to Rwanda).\n\nSTEP INTO RECESS\n\nCOVID INQUIRY DUMP: With such a rush of government docs in the run-up to Christmas, another source of news went relatively overlooked. The COVID inquiry uploaded more than 700 pieces of evidence (!!!) to its website on Monday.\n\nGetting stuck in: The Times’ Chris Smyth has a big round-up of some of the news lines, including that Sunak considered giving everyone in Britain a pre-paid debit card … Care Minister Helen Whately asked in March 2020 “do we really want to be discharging patients with COVID into a care home” … and Liz Truss praised working from home.\n\nNot to mention … Commons leader Penny Mordaunt said “key WhatsApp messages” to and from Boris Johnson went, er, “missing from my phone” around the time the ex-PM changed his number. The Times’ Aubrey Allegretti has tweeted more about *that* saga.\n\nThere’s more: The i’s Jane Merrick has spotted Boris Johnson referred to getting “bludgers and skivers” back into the office. Will we see more of this sort of thing as hacks dig further into the documents over Christmas?\n\nTRANS REACTION: Of the many government updates pre-recess, none are so pored over as the long-delayed guidance to schools on how to handle pupils questioning their gender. Downing Street will be relieved at approving leader columns in the right-leaning Times, Telegraph, Mail and Sun, though the Mail and Sun anchor their coverage on bitter divides over the policy, called “cruel and unworkable” by left-wing Labour MP Kate Osborne.\n\nTwin track: Women and Equalities Minister Kemi Badenoch makes the Mail splash with an op-ed that says “teaching children that you can be born in the ‘wrong’ body is harmful” and “we should be wary of those who speak casually about ‘trans children.’” Education Secretary Gillian Keegan — who jointly drew up the guidance amid claims in the summer of splits with Badenoch — has an op-ed in the Sun too (striking a less strident note).\n\nCALLING TIME: Scotland’s Social Justice Secretary Shirley-Anne Somerville will give a statement to MSPs after 2 p.m. — and is expected to drop any further legal challenges against Westminster for blocking the SNP’s gender recognition reforms (via PA). Scottish Finance Secretary Shona Robison, who appeared to confirm the climbdown on the BBC last night (five minutes in), is on Times Radio at 7.20 a.m.\n\nELSEWHERE: Despite widespread media coverage, plenty of other things will end up being a little lost in the noise. In two days alone we’ve had Michael Gove’s housing speech … MPs’ proposed pay rise … a £3.3 billion offer to restore Stormont … and the local government finance settlement that includes 5 percent council tax rises and “the real pain” starting in 2025 (h/t IFS). The Mirror team has a round-up of seven bits, including the coroners’ court backlog and “a huge gaffe which effectively cut expected schools funding by £370million,” complete with rhyming couplets and a mocked-up image of the PM as a bin man.\n\nSLOW PROGRESS I: More than 30 cross-party MPs wrote to Foreign Secretary David Cameron urging him to get new transparency rules for crown dependencies and overseas territories “over the line,” “with no further delay.” A WMS on Tuesday said there would be more work in 2024.\n\nSLOW PROGRESS II: A bill to compensate victims of the Post Office Horizon scandal passed through the Commons, though Computer Weekly reports that only 11 members of a specific campaign group have received full compensation.\n\nHOME ALONE: The Telegraph has trawled through occupancy data and found three-quarters of government offices were emptier in the first week of December than a fortnight earlier. Now do journalists.\n\n**Reach the heights of the Alps and global policymaking conversations with us at Davos.

Don’t miss out - register today.**\n\nTODAY IN WESTMINSTER\n\nPARLIAMENT: In recess until January 8.\n\nNEWS JUST IN: CPI inflation was 3.9 percent in November, down from 4.6 percent in October, according to ONS stats out just now. Chancellor Jeremy Hunt should be issuing a quote and recording a pool clip shortly. No prizes for guessing whether he’ll mention Sunak’s pledge to halve inflation this year (the only one of his five that he’s definitely met).\n\nNot so fast: Stephen Millard of the National Institute of Economic and Social Research messages in to argue that — by setting a 5-ish percent target this year — the PM “hindered” the Bank of England’s ability to hit its actual 2 percent target and “likely increased the persistence of inflation this year.”\n\nSpeaking of which: New BOE Deputy Governor Sarah Breeden used her first speech to say “our job isn’t done” until inflation hits 2 percent and interest rates will have to stay higher for longer, the Times reports.\n\nSTRIKES HIT: Junior doctors in England have just begun a three-day walkout over pay.\n\nIt keeps coming: Another six days of action are planned from January 3. With Health Secretary Victoria Atkins not countenancing talks unless strikes are called off, and the British Medical Association refusing to cancel them, what chance is there of breakthrough in Christmas week?\n\nStrong words galore: Atkins said overnight the strikes risk “significant disruption” and urged BMA reps to “come back to the negotiating table as we were making good progress” … the BMA said it’s spent two weeks waiting for Atkins’ “final offer” but “we are still yet to hear it” … and the Times noses on a letter by charities including Age U.K. that says thousands of elderly patients could end up “stranded in hospital.”\n\nNot to mention … This won’t exactly help the PM’s so-far-failed pledge to bring down NHS waiting lists.\n\nTHEATER OF WAR: The Commons Defense Committee is looking for its third chair in five months after Robert Courts joined the government, and there are two confirmed candidates so far — former Paymaster General Jeremy Quin, and one-time prime ministerial hopeful Rehman Chishti. Quin’s pitch is here.\n\nHOME, DEAR: The ONS house price index is out at 9.30 a.m.\n\nSUNLIT UPLANDS: The British Chambers of Commerce’s latest survey claims 60 percent of firms that export to the EU are finding it harder than a year ago — via the Guardian.\n\nSILENCE, PLEASE: My colleague Esther Webber has a long-read out today on the chilling effect our libel and privacy laws have on reporters. Speaking to lawyers, editors and journalists who’ve faced defamation action, she writes that together these aspects of English law have contributed to “open secrets” in British public life: people whose names are well known within their sphere for alleged misconduct, but who cannot be exposed because of the onerously high burden of legal proof.\n\nFeaturing you-know-who: As part of the piece, she follows the Sunday Times in naming Andrew Rosindell as the MP who has been under arrest on suspicion of rape and other offenses since May 2022. During this time he has stayed away from parliament as part of a “gentlemen’s agreement,” but has continued to claim expenses, accept donations from supporters and go on freebie trips worth £8,548 in total, to Bahrain, India, Italy and Poland.\n\nRosindell says: The MP for Romford denies all wrongdoing and has not been charged.\n\nINTO THE ARCHIVES: Three days after the Sunday Times predicted the Conservatives’ focus will turn to controversial cases Keir Starmer defended as a barrister, the Telegraph has interviewed Wendy Ballard. She survived a firebombing of her home, only to see the attacker secured early release by Starmer, and tells the paper: “What Starmer did had a terrible impact on my family.”\n\nGRUDGE MATCH: London’s Labour Mayor Sadiq Khan is in another dispute with Tory ministers — this time Michael Gove and Grant Shapps, who the Telegraph hears are looking at ways to send cars that’d be scrapped under the Ultra-Low Emissions Zone to Ukraine. City Hall is insisting it can’t be done without a change to the Greater London Authority Act, which a “source close to” Shapps calls “hiding behind a technicality.”\n\nMore of this sort of thing: Transport Secretary Mark Harper will be pointing at a north London road later with Khan’s Tory rival Susan Hall. They’ll be talking about a government announcement of £235 million for London roads (over 11 years) from redirected HS2 funds, via the Standard. It’s almost like there’s a mayoral election in May.\n\nSTILL DIGGING: The Guardian has named three lawyers who acted for Michelle Mone. One apologized; another instructed (who else?) a lawyer to respond on his behalf.\n\nWHAT THE GOVERNMENT WANTS TO TALK ABOUT: Nearly 12 million pensioners receiving up to £600 each in Winter Fuel Payments and Pensioner Cost of Living Payments. Sunak has an op-ed about it in the Express — which makes the splash, and also says “we’ve got to move on from the spending, high-borrowing, high-tax approach.” One can dream.\n\nEVERYBODY NEEDS GOOD NEIGHBORS: U.K. intelligence officers raised security concerns about a Moscow-owned flat overlooking MI6’s headquarters, reports the i’s Richard Holmes in the paper’s splash.\n\nDUG INTO A HOLE: Digger firm JCB sacked a “small but significant” number of staff after a “series of investigations into substance misuse,” according to an internal message seen by the Guardian’s Anna Isaac.\n\nWHAT LABOUR WANTS TO TALK ABOUT: Party analysis claiming more than 270,000 young people referred for mental health care last year waited longer than three months, or saw their referral closed with care. Via TES.\n\nDON’T DO ACID, KIDS: The Technology department has put out some pretend “leaked” footage of Chief Scientific Adviser Angela McLean … *checks notes* …. explaining to DSIT Secretary Michelle Donelan how Father Christmas delivers presents using fragile quantum entanglement. The Sun’s Ryan Sabey got the scoop on that one.\n\nJoke’s on them: We all know Father Christmas is magic!\n\nBEYOND THE M25\n\nBUDGET BLOWBACK: Scotland’s budget — with a 45 percent tax band for those earning £75,000 — gets loads of pick-up including the FT front page. The Institute for Fiscal Studies says the SNP-run government will have to look further than income tax to “continue raising revenue” from richer Scots, while the Joseph Rowntree Foundation described the Scottish child payment’s £1.70 increase as a “missed opportunity” — via PA.\n\nWhat the papers say: The Scottish papers largely slate the budget with the Daily Record leading on “All pain no gain” … the Herald’s website has “Devastating” regarding the £200 million cut to the housing budget … the Scotsman’s website leads on the tax band introduction … while even the independence-supporting National splashes with “Difficult decisions.”\n\nMEANWHILE IN WALES: The Labour-run Welsh government announced public spending cuts with business rate relief reduced from 75 percent to 40 percent affecting pubs, shops and restaurants — PA has more. Chief Secretary to the Treasury Laura Trott said “Labour in Wales have today done what Labour always do in power — raised taxes.”\n\nVOLCANIC VISION: Iceland’s Foreign Minister Bjarni Benediktsson voiced concern for a “critical power plant” as he marked 24 hours since the volcanic eruption. Sky News has a great set of photos and videos while CNBC has breathtaking aerial footage.\n\nUKRAINE UDPATE: Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said his military has asked for 450,000 to 500,000 men to join the fight against Russia, via the Telegraph. Russian President Vladimir Putin claimed attempts to defeat his country had failed with the war moving in Russia’s favor, via the Times.\n\nTop read — Ukraine’s fallen hero: Sergei Bubka was Ukraine’s most iconic sportsman. Now, the legendary pole vaulter is facing accusations he’s a Russian collaborator, reports Daria Meshcheriakova for POLITICO.\n\n**A message from Kenvue: Kenvue is deeply committed to our purpose of helping people realise the extraordinary power of everyday care. We feel we have a great opportunity to help smokers become tobacco and nicotine-free and our national Smokefree Families campaign aims to help reduce the number of babies born into smoking households in the UK. Working across multiple channels, Smokefree Families will facilitate collaboration with policymakers, help empower pregnant women and their significant others in their quit journey and assist healthcare professionals to support pregnant women and their significant others to quit smoking for good.**\n\nMEDIA ROUND\n\nWork and Pensions Secretary Mel Stride broadcast round: GB News (6.45 a.m.) … Times Radio (7.05 a.m.) … Sky News (7.15 a.m.) … LBC (7.35 a.m.) … Today program (7.50 a.m.) … BBC Breakfast (8.10 a.m.) … GMB (8.30 a.m.).\n\nShadow Education Secretary Bridget Phillipson broadcast round: Times Radio (7.50 a.m.) … Sky News (8.10 a.m.) … LBC (8.50 a.m.).\n\nAlso on Times Radio Breakfast: Scottish Finance Secretary Shona Robison (7.20 a.m.) … NHS England National Medical Director Stephen Powis (7.45 a.m.) … Tory MP and doctor Dan Poulter (8.10 a.m.) … NHS Providers Deputy Chief Executive Saffron Cordery (8.45 a.m.).\n\nAlso on Sky News Breakfast: Tory peer and Trade Envoy to Ukraine Catherine Meyer (9.30 a.m.).\n\nAlso on Nick Ferrari at Breakfast: Lib Dem PPC Max Wilkinson (7.15 a.m.) … Tory London Mayoral candidate Susan Hall (8.05 a.m.) … Labour Muslim Network Chair Ali Milani (8.20 a.m.).\n\nTODAY’S FRONT PAGES\n\nPOLITICO UK: How British libel law lets bad people get away with bad things.\n\nDaily Express: PM’s battle cry “we’ve got to move on from high taxes.”\n\nDaily Mail: Kemi — teaching children you can be born in the “wrong” body is harmful.\n\nDaily Mirror: My mum should not have to die alone at Dignitas.\n\nDaily Star: Inbetweener Jay — my monkey terror.\n\nFinancial Times: Activist Cevian bets €1.2 billion on UBS doubling its valuation in three years.\n\ni: MI6 security alert over flat owned by Russian neighbors.\n\nMetro: Epstein friends named on January 1.\n\nThe Daily Telegraph: U.S. draws up plan for strikes on Houthis.\n\nThe Guardian: Pressure on Israel rises as Gaza deaths near 20,000.\n\nThe Sun: Andrew grope case bombshell.\n\nThe Times: Elderly “will bear brunt of strikes at Christmas.”\n\nLONDON CALLING\n\nWESTMINSTER WEATHER: Light cloud and a moderate breeze.
