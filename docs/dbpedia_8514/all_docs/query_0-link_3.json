        "text": "Lynne Featherstone is to replace Norman Baker as the Lib Dem minister in the Home Office, the party has said.\n\nMr Baker quit on Monday, saying he found it a \"constant battle\" working with Home Secretary Theresa May.\n\nMs Featherstone worked with Mrs May in the Home Office for two years and has been a minister for international development since 2012.\n\nThe home secretary said she was \"delighted\" with the appointment and said she wished Mr Baker well.\n\nMr Baker criticised the way Mrs May ran her department and accused the Conservatives of a \"lurch to the right\" after stepping down as minister for crime prevention.\n\nWorking in the Home Office was like \"walking through mud\" and a \"constant battle\", he said.\n\nThe Conservatives have disputed this and questioned Mr Baker's own performance in the job.\n\nBusiness Secretary Vince Cable said his experience of coalition government was \"very different\" to Mr Baker's and said he had a \"cordial, business-like relationship\" with Mrs May.\n\nMs Featherstone said she was \"very happy to be returning to the Home Office\".\n\nShe added: \"I have always had a very constructive relationship with Theresa May and I look forward to working with her again.\"\n\nMrs May said: \"I'm delighted to welcome Lynne Featherstone back to the Home Office. I greatly enjoyed working with her as a minister here at the start of the Parliament, and am glad to have the chance to do so again.\n\n\"I would also like to take this opportunity to thank Norman Baker for his work as crime prevention minister and to wish him well for the future.\""
