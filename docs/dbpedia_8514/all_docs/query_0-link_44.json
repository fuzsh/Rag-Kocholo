        "text": "The Prime Minister posted this picture online this morning with the message: \"Here's to a brighter future for everyone\"\n\nRobin de Peyer8 May 2015\n\nDavid Cameron was this morning on the verge of returning to Downing Street after a dramatic night of election results.\n\nExit polls suggesting the Conservatives would emerge as comfortably the largest party in the Commons appeared to be being borne out in results overnight.\n\nSome forecasters were suggesting Mr Cameron's party could win an outright majority of 326 seats in what would be the biggest polling upset since 1992.\n\nIt came as Prime Minister David Cameron held his seat in Witney with a majority of 22,740. In his victory speech, he said his aim was to \"govern on the basis of governing for everyone\" in Britain and to \"bring our United Kingdom together\" by implementing devolution reforms in Scotland and Wales.\n\nThe Prime Minister and wife Samantha return this morning to Downing Street\n\nHe said he would pursue a One Nation agenda \"if I am fortunate enough to form a government in the coming days\".\n\nThe Tories were celebrating swings in key target seats as questions mounted over Ed Miliband's future as Labour leader and Boris Johnson completed a sensational Commons return after romping to victory in Uxbridge and South Ruislip.\n\nChancellor George Osborne was also re-elected in Tatton with 59 per cent of the vote.\n\nHe declared: \"Five years ago I made a commitment to work with the British people to turn Britain around. And we have made great progress.\n\nDavid Cameron: smiled as he held his seat in Witney\n\n\"Tonight, the British people have asked us to finish the job and that is what we will now set about doing.\"\n\nIn a night of drama:\n\nThe Lib Dems saw catastrophic losses with senior figures Simon Hughes, Vince Cable and Lynne Featherstone all losing their seats\n\nThe SNP made sweeping gains in Scotland and could win almost every seat north of the border as Labour big hitters were among the victims\n\nLabour had a disastrous night, making some gains in London but losing key seats elsewhere in the country\n\nGeorge Galloway lost in Bradford West, paving the way for him to run for Tower Hamlets Mayor\n\nA clearly crestfallen Ed Miliband came close to conceding defeat in a speech after holding his seat of Doncaster North, describing the election as \"very disappointing and difficult\" for Labour and saying that \"the next government\" would have a huge responsibility to hold the United Kingdom together.\n\nRead More\n\nHunt says £100k personal donation to local Tory party shows ‘commitment’ to area\n\nBudget ‘won’t make a dent’ in financial challenges, Stormont minister says\n\nEx-rough sleeper tells minister not enough being done to help people on streets\n\nSponsored\n\nCelebrate Art of London’s collaborations with women artists\n\nMr Miliband made no comment about his own position as he left for Westminster, though senior figures including veteran former minister Jack Straw said he would have to \"make up his mind about his future\" as party leader.\n\nMr Miliband said: \"This has clearly been a very disappointing and difficult night for the Labour Party.\n\n\"I want to say to all the dedicated and decent colleagues in Scotland who have lost their seats that I am deeply sorry for what has happened. And I also want to say that the next government has a huge responsibility. It has a huge responsibility in facing the very difficult task of keeping our country together.\n\n\"Whatever party we come from, if we believe in the United Kingdom we should stand up for people in every part of our United Kingdom because I believe that what unites us is much, much more than what divides us.\"\n\nThe Liberal Democrats saw huge losses as big hitters including Simon Hughes, Vince Cable and Lynne Featherstone lost seats in London.\n\nNick Clegg held his seat in Sheffield Hallam with 40 per cent of the vote but admitted it had been a \"cruel and punishing\" night for his party and cast doubt on his future as Lib Dem leader.\n\nEd Miliband won in Doncaster North with 52 per cent of the vote. He said: \"This has clearly been a very difficult and disappointing night for the Labour Party.\"\n\nAnd Nicola Sturgeon's SNP made major gains in Scotland as high-profile Labour figures lost out to the nationalists.\n\nScottish Labour leader Jim Murphy lost his East Renfrewshire seat to the SNP's Kirsten Oswald, and Labour's election guru Douglas Alexander lost out to 20-year-old university student Mhairi Black.\n\nDespite the bleak overall picture - which sparked speculation about Ed Miliband's future role in the party - Labour made some gains in London.\n\nVeteran Liberal Democrat MP Simon Hughes lost out to Labour's Neil Coyle having held the seat for 32 years and Lynne Featherstone was beaten by Catherine West in Hornsey and Wood Green.\n\nDespite holding off a Labour challenge to retain his Sheffield Hallam seat, Mr Clegg said there would be \"implications\" for his position as leader.\n\n\"It is now painfully clear that this has been a cruel and punishing night for the Liberal Democrats,\" he said.\n\nNick Clegg's Lib Dems saw sweeping losses across the UK\n\n\"The election has profound implications for the country and it obviously has profound implications for the Liberal Democrats.\n\n\"I will be seeking to make further remarks about the implications of this election, both for the country and for the party I lead.\"\n\nCreate a FREE account to continue reading\n\nRegistration is a free and easy way to support our journalism.\n\nJoin our community where you can: comment on stories; sign up to newsletters; enter competitions and access content on our app.\n\n* FIRST NAME\n\n* LAST NAME\n\n* EMAIL\n\nYour email address\n\n* PASSWORD\n\nMust be at least 6 characters, include an upper and lower case character and a number\n\n* YEAR OF BIRTH\n\nYou must be at least 18 years old to create an account\n\n* Required fields\n\nI would like to be emailed about offers, events and updates from Evening Standard.
