        "text": "The Chamber is well used to extraordinary displays of boorishness during prime minister's questions but even hardened MPs were taken aback by David Cameron's performance on Wednesday, when (to recap, in case you have somehow missed a moment that within minutes was swamping the Twittersphere and within an hour had spawned nearly 400 news stories) he was challenged by Angela Eagle, shadow chief secretary to the treasury.\n\nIt was not a particularly earth-shattering challenge – he had said former Labour MP Howard Stoate (whom he was enlisting in his increasingly ragged defence of Andrew Lansley's NHS reforms) had been defeated by a Tory at the last election; she was pointing out, in the vociferous way required when a roomful of supposed adults is shouting at each other like sleep-deprived six-year-olds, that Stoate had in fact retired, rather than been defeated, in order to return to his job as a GP. \"Calm down, dear,\" said Cameron, failing only to pat her gently on the head as he said it. \"Calm down. Calm down and listen to the doctor.\"\n\nIn terms of levels of offensiveness, where to start? The imputation that Eagle, being a woman, was just being hysterical, over-emotional? The further imputation that nothing she said was therefore worth listening to? The belittling \"dear\"? The arrogant superiority? The paternal order to listen not just to him, but to \"the doctor\", these men who know best? Frankly, he only failed to pat her gently on the head.\n\n\"Calm down,\" he said yet again, in case anyone had missed it. They most definitely hadn't: even the Daily Telegraph, which could not resist an en passant dig at the \"frighteningly feminist\" Eagle, noted that: \"The wind whistled around the Commons chamber in the seconds after he said it.\" There was some laughter: George Osborne, unsurprisingly, guffawed, but Nick Clegg, sitting to the prime minister's right, went completely, unsmilingly still, as though by doing so he could somehow will himself invisible, or at least somewhere else.\n\nOn the benches opposite there was fury, and immediate calls for him to apologise. \"I am not going to apologise,\" replied Cameron. \"You do need to calm down.\" Only intervention by the Speaker made him retreat to his seat.\n\nThe waves of comment started instantly, though they pushed in various directions. For some – including Downing street aides, it was just a joke — \"a popular advert and a humorous remark [in danger of being] over-analysed.\" Michael Winner – whose catchphrase it became, after he repeated it ad nauseum in adverts for the insurance company Esure – was predictably tickled. \"David Cameron's actually used this phrase before – he said it in the House of Commons last year. I remember feeling pleased when I saw him say it at the time, and I'm pleased to hear him use it again now. It's just a harmless phrase I wrote for an advert 10 years ago, and it's entered into the national consciousness – I get people shouting it at me in the street or in restaurants, all the time, and I don't mind in the least. The Labour party are saying it's disrespectful to women, but what planet are they on? It's just a jolly statement, a bit of fun – and we need fun more than ever in these dour times. I really can't imagine why Harriet Harman, or anyone else, would object to it.\"\n\nBut many felt differently. \"It was very patronising and I think he ought quickly to say he's sorry and move on,\" says Caroline Lucas, the Green MP who entered parliament for the first time (for herself and her party) a year ago. \"But I think it tells you more about the culture of the House of Commons than about David Cameron, to be fair to him. If someone said that in any workplace people would be shocked, but there is a culture, particularly in the chamber, whereby people are pretty rude to one another, and there is an environment of sexism. I think it turns a lot of women off, and his comments were a step over the mark really. But I wouldn't pick him out more than other men.\"\n\nWhat does it say about Cameron himself, though? \"I think you see far more about what he's actually like by looking at his policies, when you see how they're targeting the poorest, and women most of all. I'm not excusing him – but he's certainly not alone in that kind of attitude, unfortunately. But I think we should look at his policies.\"\n\n\"What does anyone expect from the man who is cutting Sure Start, playgrounds, child benefit, etc?\" echoed a poster on Mumsnet, which was afire with commentary, ranging from \"Storm, meet teacup. Calm down. Not everything is overt sexism designed to push women back into the kitchen,\" to less printable reactions. \"When did he ever think women were important?\"\n\nMany others, however, were not shy about concluding that this was a definitive moment when his carefully cultivated persona of caring, sharing, socially up-to-date conservative was stripped away. Or, as Labour backbencher Chuka Umunna instantly tweeted: \"The mask slips.\"\n\n\"David Cameron's contemptuous response to Angela Eagle MP at prime minister's questions today shows his patronising and outdated attitude to women,\" says Harriet Harman. \"Women in Britain in the 21st century do not expect to be told to 'calm down dear' by their prime minister.\"\n\n\"He used the phrase on purpose to put her down,\" adds feminist campaigner Julie Bindel, \"to make sure she knew he's got power over her. It's not an accident, and it's not the same at all as if a woman says it to a woman or man says it to a man. Cameron hates strong women, and Angela Eagle is a strong woman and a feminist who obviously doesn't suffer fools. She hasn't got to where she is today as an out lesbian without being strong – it really takes some guts. They always get horrific misogyny. This isn't the the first time it's happened to her but it's the first time in PMQs.\n\n\"And Cameron is a very traditional man who has not absorbed feminism or its messages at all. The women in his cabinet [Lynne Featherstone and Theresa May, specifically] are there as a concession and as window dressing. Winner was only using a phrase that has been used for time immemorial. It's the clean version of 'all you need is a good fuck', or 'don't worry your little dykey head about this, it's for the big dicks to sort out' – that's what he's saying, in his oh-so-polite old Etonian way. It's total and utter misogyny.\"\n\nBut for some it betrays something else, too. It has been noted before, not least by Ed Miliband, who called it Cameron's \"Flashman routine\", that the prime minister can resort too easily to bullying, or cheap shots. \"When he doesn't have an argument, he'll throw an insult.\"\n\nAnd, like much bullying, it comes out of a kind of weakness. \"It's awfully paternalistic, and politically incredibly stupid,\" says psychotherapist and writer Susie Orbach, \"but what this portrays, or betrays, is that he's flustered, not her. You don't say that kind of thing unless you're flustered. He's trying to silence her, because he's got all shook up.\" Round one to Eagle, then?"
