Ricky Warwick's enlisted time with New Model Army was brief, as the aggressive guitarist had his own band to command. General Warwick wasted no time assembling The Almighty after busting free from NMA. Signed to Polygram a year following their formation, The Almighty entered Abbey Road Studios in1989, where the group laid down the tracks for their debut. Produced by John Williams, the resulting eleven song "Blood, Fire & Love" album, packs muscle and grit. The harmonized vocals, Tony Iommi inspired riffing and to-the-point song structures are all here. It is understandable that the band was called "The european answer to Alice in Chains". Digitally remastered re-issue incl.. 7 live bonus tracks.
