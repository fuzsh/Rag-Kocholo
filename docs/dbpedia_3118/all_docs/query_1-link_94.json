        "text": "Prayers Offered at the Meetings of\n\nXavier's Board of Trustees\n\nAutumn Months\n\nAs we prepare to enter the Fall season, let us talk a moment to reflect on the bountiful graces God has provided us.\n\nO God of Creation, you have blessed us with the changing of the seasons.\n\nAs we welcome the autumn months,\n\nmay the earlier setting of the sun\n\nremind us to take time to rest.\n\nMay the brilliant colors of the leaves\n\nremind us of the wonder of your creation.\n\nMay the steam of our breath in the cool air\n\nremind us that it is you who give us the breath of life.\n\nMay the harvest from the fields remind us of the abundance we have been given and bounty we are to share with others.\n\nMay the dying of summer's spirit remind us of your great promise that death is temporary and life is eternal.\n\nWe praise you for your goodness forever and ever.\n\nAdapted and offered by Paul Verst, original author unknown\n\nOpening a Board Retreat\n\nLet us pray,\n\nGood and Loving God, our source of love, light, and wisdom.\n\nBless us as we begin this vital strategic work on behalf of Xavier’s students.\n\nIt is our privilege and our responsibility to support, foster, and advance the mission of Xavier University.\n\nGive us foresight, by which we plan for the future,\n\nGive us confidence to discover and explore new possibilities,\n\nGive us wisdom to discern what is right and good and just,\n\nSend your creative spirit upon us.\n\nWe ask for your guidance and grace,\n\nTo use our talents for the advancement of the University.\n\nWe ask this in your Holy Name.\n\nAdapted and offered by John Maydonovitch\n\nA Welcome For New Trustees\n\nFather,\n\nThank You for every seat that has been filled here, today. For each mind and heart that fills the presence of this room, we thank You. Only You truly know what we are setting out to accomplish today. We have an idea, a vision, hints, and daily instructions. We have talents, abilities, and time to work. However, only You can see in perfect detail the end of every beginning. Every project, every season, every life. Nothing is ever in vain, for even mistakes and missteps are used for good. Help us to listen, before speaking. Help us to fully understand. Help us to value and appreciate the ones we are about to meet.\n\nFather,\n\nWe pause to give thanks for the blessings of this meal. May the food and our conversation celebrate God's goodness and inspire us to greater service. We thank You, Lord, for gathering us here to share this day and this meal.

Bless us, these gifts and fill us with gratitude and love as we celebrate in Your name. Amen.\n\nWritten and offered by Ivy Banks, J.D.\n\nAug. 2022\n\nCovid Theology of the Body Remix\n\nDear Risen Lord,\n\nToday we pray You unmask the gift that is manifest in every life.\n\nLet us celebrate the joy of being children of God and the dignity of each Unique and Unrepeatable life made in his image and likeness.\n\nInject in us the humbleness to know we are loved by you beyond measure.\n\nInfect us with the passion and courage to share God’s love with everyone around us.\n\nWe pray for immunity to evil; especially to hate , prejudice, negativity and despair.\n\nHelp us use our gifts to be a part of your mission.\n\nLet us be superspreaders of love.\n\nWritten and offered by Tim Reillly\n\nInspired by the Universal Apostolic Preferences\n\nI wanted to start with a very brief capture of why Xavier is so important to me as a person of the Islamic faith. One of my first memories as a child growing up in Lahore, Pakistan was a beautiful catholic family where the father was a colleague with my dad at the major university there having completed their PhDs together at Indiana University. Those deep seeded fond memories have been reinforced by seeing more closely the work and the values of the Jesuits. Though it was with much reflection, it was without hesitation that both of our boys with full blessings chose to go to St. Xavier high school to be for and with men for others. Knowing Father Graham, working with the Brueggeman Center and getting to know a number of people at Xavier has only reinforced the connection of common values and much of my desired mission in life. In trying to summarize the connection of these common values and desired work with my faith of Islam, I had to look no further than the universal apostolic preferences for the next decade at Xavier.\n\nI begin this prayer in the name of God the most merciful, the most beneficient-\n\nOh dear God\n\nAs we at Xavier strive \"To show the way to God through spiritual exercise and discernment\", I am reminded of my favorite saying of the prophet Muhammad.\n\nGod says:\n\n\"I am just as My servant thinks I am, and I am with him if He remembers Me. If he remembers Me in himself, I too remember him in Myself; and if he remembers Me in a group of people, I remember him in a group that is better than them; and if he comes one span nearer to Me, I go one cubit nearer to him; and if he comes one cubit nearer to Me, I go a distance of two outstretched arms nearer to him; and if he comes to Me walking, I go to him running.\"\n\nAs we at Xavier are asked \"To walk with the poor, the outcast of the world, those whose dignity has been violated in a mission of reconciliation and justice.\"\n\nLet us remember what we have and who we are due to God's blessings and mercy.\n\nLet us remember that it is our obligation to serve those in need as they may be more loved by God than us.\n\nIn Chapter 4 of the Quran titled Women we are told \"O ye who believe! Stand out firmly for justice, as witnesses to God, even as against yourself, or your parents, or your kin, and whether it be (against) rich or poor: for God can best protect both.\"\n\nOh Dear God,\n\nAs Xavier ambassadors we strive \"To accompany young people in the creation of a hope-filled future.\"\n\nLet us remember that we were once young and relied on the love, compassion and support of those older to lift us up, give us hope and show us a path to a brighter future. God reminds us not to be empty vessels of prayer and chapter 107 of the Quran says:\n\n\"Have you considered him who denies the religion?\n\nIt is he who mistreats the orphan.\n\nAnd does not encourage the feeding of the poor.\n\nSo woe to those who pray.\n\nThose who are heedless of their prayers.\n\nThose who put on the appearance.\n\nAnd without the assistance.\"\n\nOur Gracious God,\n\nWe see many signs that compel us \"To collaborate in the care of our common home\"\n\nLet us remember that God created nature in a balance (\"al-mizan\") and mankind's responsibility is to maintain this fragile equilibrium through wise governance and sound personal conduct.\n\nThe Quran also describes the believing men and women as those who \"walk on Earth in humility.\" (Q 25:63)\n\nLet us remember that even the Earth has inalienable rights endowed by its Creator.\n\nIn closing, let us remember those loved ones that have passes too quickly for even the short time on this Earth.\n\nWe in Islam say \"inna lilla wainna illaihi rajaioon\", \"From God they came and until God they return!\"\n\nLet us remember, our dear colleague Jodi Allan, to those innocent people that tragically died at the hands of those who are charged to protect them and the 500,000 lives (grandfathers, grandmothers, parents, children, daughter, sons and friends) that perished during this year of an unprecedented pandemic. May God have his just mercy on all of them.\n\nMay we remember their legacy by seeking God's guidance and striving to create a better world for not just our children but all of our children to come.\n\nAmen Amen\n\nAuthored and presented by Ms. Shakila Ahmad, 2/25/21\n\nBack to Top\n\nA Coronavirus Prayer\n\nLoving God, Your desire is for our wholeness and well being.\n\nWe hold in tenderness and prayer the collective suffering of our world at this time.\n\nWe grieve precious lives lost and vulnerable lives threatened.\n\nWe ache for ourselves and our neighbors, standing before an uncertain future.\n\nWe pray: may love, not fear, go viral.\n\nInspire our leaders to discern and choose wisely, aligned with the common good.\n\nHelp us to practice social distancing and reveal to us new and creative ways to come together in spirit and in solidarity.\n\nCall us to profound trust in your faithful presence,\n\nYou, the God who does not abandon.\n\nOffered by Mike McCaw\n\nBack to Top\n\nWhat I've Experienced Over the Last Year\n\nDear God - What I have experienced over the last year has challenged my strength - physically, emotionally and spiritually - it had my questioning “why me?”, it had me asking what the hell? - am I allowed to use hell in a prayer - oh well... I guess I just did - but what I’ve learned from it is amazing.\n\nMost importantly what I’ve learned is that people - many, many, many, many people - are really, really, good. My family was there for me in ways I never thought I’d need. My love for them has grown deeper than I ever thought was possible. I learned I married the right guy and that he really meant in sickness and in health. I learned there is nothing better in life than having 4 sisters to surround you with love when you need it.\n\nAnd then there were the many friends and colleagues including many in this room - friends I hadn’t talked to in 30 years and friends that I talk to every week - they found ways through their notes, their texts, their phone calls, their visits to make me laugh, cry, make fun of myself, and realize how truly blessed I am - and most importantly to remind me that people are good - really .. really good ...they care, they love, they support, they help.\n\nI’m not usually one who has asked for a lot of help in my life - I thought I had it mostly figured out. I was tough, I was strong. So, my second big learning has been learning how to let go and ask for help - especially from you God – it is profound. It’s changed my life and the way I think about things, the way I think about life. We are meant to ask for help. We are meant to give help. It’s not a weakness, it’s a strength.\n\nI also learned that prayers work. I’m so thankful for all the people who have said prayers for me ... many that I don’t even know! It’s amazing how many people are willing to put you on their prayer list. Even now that I’m better people still say... well I’m still saying prayers for you. And I’m sooooo appreciative. There is something really cool about prayer power\n\nI’m not going to lie - the last year has been scary - it’s still scary - and if you believe the internet - which no one sick should ever rely on - the odds aren’t great. I’m a very objective, data based practical person. You can’t deny the facts.......the odds aren’t great. But God...I believe more than I’ve ever believed before... that you have a plan. And so I surrender myself to you. I will follow your will. I will put all my energy into how to make this a great thing - for me, for my family, for my friends, for my colleagues - and frankly ... to anyone that will listen. I promise to love every day…every minute. I promise to be grateful for the people I’ve met, the experiences I’ve had, the beautiful places I’ve gotten to witness. Every day is a day to be lived to the fullest! To love, to laugh, to care, to give, to be thankful and to praise you God!\n\nAnd so, while it’s very easy from afar to think that’s what happened to me is a bad thing - I like to think of it as the best thing, the very best thing ...that has ever happened to me. What I’ve learned about myself, about others and mostly about you, God - is simply ...the very best.\n\nSo during this advent season let us all remember that people are good, really, really good. Let us remember that the love and caring we give others matters so much more than we realize …so give more. Let us remember that prayers work. Say more. Let us show gratitude. Gratitude is a gift. Let us realize that we all have things in our lives that are scary – look to God for strength and comfort. And let us thank God for every minute of every day that we get to live life! AMEN!\n\nWritten and Offered by Jodi Allen\n\nBack to Top\n\nThank You For This Day\n\nGood and Gracious God,\n\nWe thank you for this time and for this beautiful day in Cincinnati,\n\nWe ask you to bless us with your spirit of wisdom as we discuss our strengths and our weaknesses here at Xavier,\n\nHelp us as Trustees to always keep in mind our Jesuit and Catholic mission,\n\nand illuminate us with the spirit of Ignatius,\n\nHelp us as we truly find God in all things,\n\ncelebrate our diversity despite our differences,\n\nand boldly steward Xavier toward a bright and healthy future.\n\nWe pray all of this in the name of the God who created us, who redeems us, and who sanctifies us, in Jesus’ name. Amen.\n\nAuthored and Offered by Fr. John Thiede, SJ\n\nBack to Top\n\nPrayer for Gratitude\n\nMorning reflection: One of the habits of Jesuit grads that came up yesterday was gratitude so as we quiet ourselves I would like to prayerfully move us into the fourth week of the Exercises. I invite us to close our eyes and put ourselves in God’s presence. ...\n\nIn a spirit of gratitude we call to mind something from our time yesterday or this morning that we are grateful for ... a new insight, someone’s reflection, a person who inspires up ... take a few seconds to pray for that moment, person, thing ....what happened to our hearts in this moment of gratitude ... did we give thanks to God for this moment, person, event .. And for those who are able we pray together the Ignatian suscipe prayer ... Take Lord, Receive all of our liberty, our memory, our understanding, our entire will ... Give us only your love, and your grace, that’s enough for us, Dispose of all of our gifts and talents according to your will ... in gratitude, Amen.\n\nAuthored and Offered by Fr. John Thiede, SJ\n\nBack to Top\n\nToday's Accomplishment\n\nFather,\n\nThank you for every seat that has been filled here, today.
