        "text": "The omnipotence of God can be defined as the perfect ability of God to do all things that are consistent with the divine character. Open theists see God as one who is influenced as God interacts with human beings in time and space (temporally). Thus, for Open Theists, God is affected and influenced by the world. This paper revisits the historical, biblical and theological grounds for the doctrine of omnipotence with the aim of re-establishing the relevance of divine omnipotence. Using a literary investigation this article traces the developments of the doctrine of God's power from the Early Church Fathers to the Reformers to establish whether the articulation of God's power within Open Theism resonates with Orthodox Theology and Evangelicalism.\n\nThe special issue \"The omnipotence of God\", will contain articles in English or Polish, and will be focused on the topic of the omnipotence (allmightness) of God of philosophical theism and monotheistic religions or the power of gods of polytheism, discussed in systematic or historical method. The interested contributors are highly encouraged to submit their articles to the editor of the issue via e-mail at konferencja.o.mocy.Boga@gmail.com and CC to executive editor at redakcja@filo-sofija.pl. The Journal has e-published digital PDF copies hosted online at http://www.filo-sofija.pl/index.php/czasopismo/index Readers can freely access or cite the articles. The accepted papers are published online within one week after the completion of all the necessary publishing steps.\n\nThe notion of omnipotence has proved to be quite recalcitrant to analysis. Still, during the last three decades or so, there has resurfaced a clever argument to the effect that, whatever omnipotence is, it cannot be exemplified in God: an allegedly impeccable and all-perfect being. Scrutinizing this argument, however, I find it less than convincing. Moreover, and more importantly, I venture a positive account of my own: a non-technical and distinctively metaphysical definition of omnipotence which, if true, sidesteps quite a number of well-known pitfalls. Also, by way of introduction, I review some earlier attempts.\n\nPhilosophical consideration of divine power in monotheistic context has traditionally focused on the coherence or otherwise of the concept of omnipotence and increasingly elaborate attempts to define and delineate what God can and cannot do. In this paper I consider whether understanding of God's omnipotence as 'God can do everything' is an accurate and helpful way to understand the concept of divine power as attested in the Christian tradition. I aim to demonstrate that the Judeo-Christian belief in God as the Supreme Power can be held without succumbing to 'death by thousand qualifications' associated with the treatment of omnipotence as 'God can do everything'. I will not be considering the related questions of creation, miracles, problem of evil, etc. due to space constraints even though systematic treatment of divine power would require their consideration alongside discussion of divine power.\n\nTwo notions are discussed in this article, namely, the (unity of the) Trinity and God’s omnipresence. These two notions are deeply embedded in the Christian faith system and religion – they actually form both the basis and point of departure for the Christian religion. The aim of this article is to revisit the (Early Church and present) dogma of the Church about the Trinity and omnipresence of God as a result of the heresies and apologies linked to this dogma, and to rethink the notion of the concept ‘Trinity’ linked to God’s omnipresence. The historical method is used in the discussion of the (primary) sources and to reach the outcome."
