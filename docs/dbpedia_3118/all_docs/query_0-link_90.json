Well, that doesn't surprise me\n\nYou could come up and stay here a while, back off from the killing wheel\n\nI used to think it was me who'd somehow sold out\n\nor given in on some almighty cause,\n\nBut what difference would it make? It feels good to be out here.\n\nCh: I'm never going back there\n\nI'm never going back to the bad old world\n\nPublished by Attack Attack Music/Warner Chappell Music Ltd"
