        "text": "The New Model Army\n\nI had rather have a plain, russet-coated Captain, that knows what he fights for, and loves what he knows, than what you call a Gentleman and is nothing else.--Oliver Cromwell\n\n1645-England. The English Civil War is now in its third year, a conflict ever increasing in its cruelty, dividing the country into factions, even within the nominal two major foes, the Royalists and the Parliamentarians. Edward Montagu, the Earl of Manchester, had been engaging his Royalist opponents with flagging efforts, ultimately desiring peace and reconciliation, much to the frustration of his subordinate, Oliver Cromwell, as well as other members of the Parliamentary forces. With the indecisive result of the Second Battle of Newbury, the underlying tensions of the numerous Parliamentary commanders resulted in bareface and open arguments and bitter disagreement with how the service was being run.\n\nHow military bodies were organized previously was based entirely upon locale, and were brief in contract of service, often just a few months and were not professional at all. With the passing of the Self-Denying Ordnance, which barred any member of the House of Commons as well as the House of Lords from holding military office (Cromwell, his son-in-law Henry Ireton and two local commanders were the only exceptions to this rule), Parliament set to work forging a professional meritocratic army.\n\nThe Captain-General was Sir Thomas Fairfax, nicknamed Black Tom for his swarthy complexion and black hair, and the Sergeant-Major General of the Foot was Sir Philip Skippon, with Oliver Cromwell being made Lieutenant General of Horse. Sir Thomas Fairfax had distinguished himself by impressive bravery and skill in battle, having been severly wounded at Marston Moor, and Sir Philip Skippon was a professional soldier who had fought overseas and was a veteran of 18 years of combat.\n\nWith 22,000 troops at its disposal, the New Model Army set to work, drilling relentlessly and establishing a solid reputation for iron discipline and efficiency. The administration of the army was made more centralized, allowing for better allotment of both pay and rations, which boosted morale. Combining with greater skill within the organization of the Army was the promotion based more on skill rather then birth. This is not to say that it became entirely free of political appointments, but more and more the New Model raised soldiers who were skilled and valued, thirsty for promotion and determined to fight for the \"Good Old Cause\".\n\nThe elite force within the Army was the Horse, which favoured a single ......plate overtop a \"buff coat\" which allowed for a good combination of protection and mobility. Tactically they fought with shock tactics, disregarding the popular method of caracole (which comprised of approaching an enemy and firing their pistols at a slight angle, moving to the rear to reload, and repeating the exercise repeatedly). Prince Rupert, the foremost Royalist commander nicknamed them the Ironsides for their almost mythical efficiency, slicing into the enemy. During such engagements they would demonstrate further New Model Army discipline by not pursuing fleeing formations outright, unlike their Royalist counterparts who would waste hours hunting down fugitives from the fighting.\n\nThe Foot was comprised of the dual core of pikemen and musketeers, the pikemen covering the musketeers slow reloading time and leading the attack against other infantry. There were two musketeers for every pikeman, allowing for a relatively great rate of fire, but musketeers were capable and often used for specialized tasks, able to break from the pike core and attack independently if necessary. Musketeers wore no armour, red coats and bandoliers with twelve packets of ammunition nicknamed the Twelve Apostles.\n\nNaseby\n\nThe time eventually came for the New Model Army to test their mettle against their Royalist foes, at such an opportunity would present itself at a place called Naseby, 1645. Despite their training, the Royalist forces were all veterans, and fighting was initially very hard for the New Model Army, the Royalist centre able to concentrate both horse and foot fire, with one powerful volley and then the grim work of close quarters combat. Sir Philip Skippon was wounded in the fighting, taking a bullet wound that hit him under the ribs, but did not retreat so as not to cause panic, but the men were pressed back as the fighting got bloodier and bloodier.\n\nHenry Ireton on the Parliamentarian left cut into their opponents cavalry, the fighting savage, with Ireton being wounded multiple times and ultimately unhorsed and captured, with the rest of the his horse fleeing against the marauding Cavaliers. Pursuing their quarry, the Royalists encountered the Parliamentary baggage train where the baggage troops refused to surrender. However, Prince Rupert had expended almost all of his forces to try to destroy the left and so flank the enemy, and had ultimately failed, and Cromwell on the Parliamentarian Right swooped in with fresh troops. Rallying some of Ireton's men as well, Cromwell attacked the back of the enemy force, with New Model dragoons slamming into the right wing of the Royalists.\n\nAssaulted from multiple sides, the core of the army began falling apart, with only Prince Ruperts Bluecoats holding off as long as they could, until Fairfax personally led a regiment to completely surround them, capturing their standard himself as the Bluecoats fell to the swords.\n\nThe Royalist force was utterly broken and fleeing for its life, 500 of its officers were dead and 5000 were captured, and Charles I was never again able to raise regiments to such a high standard as the ones he lost at Naseby. A year after this momentous victory for the New Model Army (who sang Psalms and Isaiah both during and after the battle), the First English Civil War would be over.\n\nLater Actions\n\nKept intact after the First Civil War, the New Model Army was able to spring into action when war broke out again, crushing the Second Civil War in a year, conducting brutal suppressions of rebellion in the north part of the country and destroying a Scottish invasion army at Preston in 1648.\n\nAfter the Second Civil War, the New Model Army crossed the sea to begin the Cromwellian conquest of Ireland, a truly grim chapter in an already cruel conflict which claimed about 30% of the Irish population due to starvation, disease, battles and massacres, the starvations induced by soldiers to break the resisting Irish. It was a hated station for service, with soldiers drawing lots as to who would go across the sea.\n\nAfter fighting in the Third and final Civil War, the New Model Army mostly policed Lord Protector Cromwell's kingdoms, putting down rebellions here and there, the Republican ideals previously hailed were now sidelined in the political makeup of Cromwell's Commonwealth. With his death and his sons removal from power, the New Model Army was broken up when George Monck, one of their commanders, brought about the Restoration of the Monarchy, Charles II returning to rule. Only Monck's Regiment and the Regiment of Curiassiers survived, becoming the Coldstream Guards and the Royal Horse Guards respectively.\n\nLegacy\n\nIn its lifetime from 1645 to 1660, the New Model Army went from a highly idealistic, highly disciplined force seeking to curtail absolutism, to defending a dictators reign. The political divisions of the Army led it to implode towards the end, almost beginning a whole new series of warfare fighting for the corpse of the Protectorate. In Ireland, the memory of its actions still remains strong in the national identity, with events like the massacre at Drogheda and Cromwell a reviled figure. In its native land, the Army and its reputation, as well as the conflicts it fought in, retreat from the public memory, one of the nations most important events and developments now becoming obscured in the mists of time.\n\nFor years, the New Model Army was the paragon of military discipline, drill, and efficiency and an example of the benefits of meritocracy, with butcher sons commanding regiments and commoners becoming men of influence. Even if for a brief time, they were soldiers fighting for the Good Old Cause."
