        "text": "The Annotated Army Song Book Part 1\n\nSongs for the Soldiers\n\nThe National Committee was charged to publish an official songbook to be distributed to song leaders, officers, and soldiers. The purpose was to familiarize the soldiers with army songs and encourage their singing. Thus, the first song book was published in the fall of 1917. In this page, you will find all the songs in the songbook with descriptions on how they relate to the American war effort.\n\nInitially entitled Songs of the Soldiers and Sailors U.S., the first edition was a collection based on those that “were then popular in the camps, together with others of sure appeal and true value.”15 The song leaders wanted more songs published with music notation since the first edition only included text.16 They asked Lee Hamner, leader of the military entertainment committee of CTCA, for a revised edition. In 1918, the second edition was published and was renamed Army Song Book. Songs were chosen in accordance with the song leader’s reports about a song's popularity. Songs chosen “endeavored to include a fair proportion of songs according to the following classification: national and patriotic songs, folk songs, popular songs of the day, and hymns.”17 Lyrics expressed six recurring themes: “patriotism, God and religion, love and women, rustic home and nostalgia, the soldier routine, and death.”18\n\nLoosely bound in khaki colored paperback, this 3 ½” x 5” 100-page song book is small enough to fit in a soldier’s uniform pocket. There are eighty-two songs, seventy-nine of which are simple melodic lines with lyrics. “The Star-Spangled Banner” and “Under the Stripes and Stars” contain simple harmonizations while meter and key signatures are indicated for each selection. Style symbols are predominantly reserved for phrase markings. The songs are categorized into four types: 18 national and patriotic songs, 14 folk songs, 36 popular songs, and 14 hymns. Most songs were taught to the soldiers, but the following eight were selected that all men were to learn: “America,” “The Star-Spangled Banner,” “The Battle Hymn of the Republic,” “Old Black Joe,” “Swanee River,” “My Old Kentucky Home,” “Roll, Jordan, Roll” and “La Marseillaise,” the French national anthem.19 Including a foreign anthem represented the War Department’s goal of unifying soldiers from diverse backgrounds - fellow Americans with foreign heritage and the Allied forces. “La Marseillaise” was so popular that Music in the Camps published a phonetic spelling of the French text to help song leaders with the pronunciation.20\n\nThe subject of the songs clearly represented the objectives of the CTCA: to encourage men to fight efficiently.21 The CTCA wanted to create a singing crusade of soldiers and that America was sending soldiers to “a war against militarism, a war to redeem a barbarous Europe, a crusade.”22 America’s focus was to win the war. For the first time, the government recognized the importance of music as a medium for propaganda and as a tool for training. According to the Commission’s report, the soldiers were “grabbing” or “eating up” the songs in the book.23 Clearly, soldiers loved singing, but these reports were published by the National Committee that had an incentive to be biased since they wanted their programs to be successful and favored positive stories for publishing. What then did the soldiers sing?\n\nTo find out, ask a veteran. Check out John J. Niles' The Songs My Mother Never Taught Me.\n\nWhere applicable, click on the link below each score to access a recording of the song.\n\nNotes:\n\n15. Camp Music Division, p.12\n\n16. Chang, p.35\n\n17. Camp Music Division, p.42\n\n18. Reed, p.118\n\n19. Chang, p.38\n\n20. Music in the Camps, Nos. 41 and 42\n\n21. The initial reason for including singing and other CTCA activities into military training was to provide troops alternatives with constructive recreational activities and discourage them from enlisting the services of prostitutes. The effectiveness of this program is still under debate, but the significance of the singing program should not be underestimated. After all, veterans claimed in interviews after WWI that the singing experience was appreciated by many soldiers and there was no harm in encouraging them to sing.\n\nFor more information on camp music singing, this article by Morgan-Ellis discusses Warren Kimsey's career as the first song leader assigned to Camp Gordon, an army training camp. Morgan-Ellis, Esther M. \"Warren Kimsey and Community Singing at Camp Gordon, 1917-1918.\" In Journal of Historical Research in Music Education Vol. 39, no. 2 (2018): 171-94.\n\nhttp://www.library.ucsb.edu/OBJID/Cylinder8575\n\nO say can you see, by the dawn's early light,\n\nWhat so proudly we hailed at the twilight's last gleaming,\n\nWhose broad stripes and bright stars through the perilous fight,\n\nO'er the ramparts we watched, were so gallantly streaming?\n\nAnd the rockets' red glare, the bombs bursting in air,\n\nGave proof through the night that our flag was still there;\n\nO say does that star-spangled banner yet wave\n\nO'er the land of the free and the home of the brave?\n\nOn the shore dimly seen through the mists of the deep,\n\nWhere the foe's haughty host in dread silence reposes,\n\nWhat is that which the breeze, o'er the towering steep,\n\nAs it fitfully blows, half conceals, half discloses?\n\nNow it catches the gleam of the morning's first beam,\n\nIn full glory reflected now shines in the stream:\n\n'Tis the star-spangled banner, O long may it wave\n\nO'er the land of the free and the home of the brave.\n\nO thus be it ever, when freemen shall stand\n\nBetween their loved homes and the war's desolation.\n\nBlest with vict'ry and peace, may the Heav'n rescued land\n\nPraise the Power that hath made and preserved us a nation!\n\nThen conquer we must, when our cause it is just,\n\nAnd this be our motto: ‘In God is our trust’\n\nAnd the star-spangled banner in triumph shall wave\n\nO'er the land of the free and the home of the brave!\n\nWhen the United States joined the war in 1917, the country did not have a national anthem. Congress only recognized the “Star Spangled Banner” as the national anthem in 1931. Written by Francis Scott Key during the War of 1812 while he was aboard the HMS Tonnant negotiating the release of three American prisoners, the \"Star-Spangled Banner\" was the product of Key's inspiration as he watched the British bombardment of Fort McHenry on the night of September 13 – 14, 1814. At dawn, when the bombardment stopped, Key saw the American flag still waving atop Fort McHenry and realized that the fort was still in American hands. He was inspired to write a poem describing his experience entitled, “Defense of Fort McHenry” that was published in Baltimore on September 17, 1814. Set to a popular tune of the day, “To Anacreon in Heaven,” Key used this same tune as the setting for his 1805 song “When the Warrior Returns” to celebrate the return of American soldiers from the First Barbary War.\n\nPrior to America’s entry into World War I, H.C. Colles published an article in 1915, “National Anthems: Their Birth and Parentage” which discussed a compilation of national anthems from the Allied perspective. No part of the article, however, mentioned the “Star Spangled Banner” even in passing. America had yet to proclaim its official national anthem. With the rise of nationalism across the globe, the business of creating national tunes was becoming crucial for citizens to identify with. Indeed, Oscar Sonneck, the head librarian of the music division of the Library of Congress, issued an “Exhaustive Official Inquiry” regarding America’s national songs in 1909. This report was revised and issued again in 1914 entitled \"The Star-Spangled Banner\" and a review of the report was published in the Musical Times in March 1915 by Frank Kidson.\n\nThe song gained popularity throughout the 19th century and bands performed it during public patriotic events. A plaque at Fort Meade, South Dakota, claims that soldiers stationed at the fort began using the “The Star-Spangled Banner” as a national anthem during parade drill as early as 1892. In 1899, the U.S. Navy officially adopted the song as its fight song. In 1916, during a time of upsurge in patriotic song production, President Wilson signed an executive order designating “The Star-Spangled Banner” as the national song for all official military use.\n\nAlthough many people called for the designation of a national anthem, there were people who objected the “Star Spangled Banner.” They argued that the tune was not suitable as a national anthem. One of the most vocal critics was Kitty Cheatham who privately published a pamphlet in 1918 entitled, Words and Music of “The Star-spangled Banner” Oppose the Spirit of Democracy Which the Declaration of Independence Embodies. She argues that the words were inappropriate in the present conflict because it was written at a time “when disruption threatened to separate nations and in which sentiments are opposed to the oneness we must finally attain, viz., the inseparable unity of Great Britain and America.” She further notes that the words were set to music originally used as a drinking-song. Published during a time when prohibiting the sale of alcohol was being debated (Wartime Prohibition Act and the 18th Amendment), this pamphlet would have resounded well to moralists who favored banning the sale of liquor. Her entire argument was concluded in one sentence, “This country will not be free until she expresses herself in her own anthem, which will be born of American high ideals.\"\n\nDespite calls for deposing the “Star Spangled Banner” as a national anthem, the song enjoyed continued popularity throughout the war. This issue was heavily debated during the Harding and Hoover administrations and was officially recognized by Congress as the national anthem in 1931. As requested by the Commission on Training Camp Activities, Frederick Converse collaborated with John Alden Carpenter in completing an orchestral arrangement of the Star Spangled Banner. Carpenter also weighed in on the argument over authenticity when he explained to Carl Engel that the Committee on Army and Navy Camp Music ruled out “historic authenticity, for the simple reason that the American People have no interest whatever in ‘authenticity’ and will proceed to sing the song the way they are used to singing it regardless of every document that can be produced to the contrary.” Premiered by the Boston Symphony Orchestra on August 26, 1918, the arrangement by Converse and Carpenter was used also by other orchestras during the war and was still being used by the Boston Symphony as late as 1942.\n\nhttp://www.library.ucsb.edu/OBJID/Cylinder0077\n\nMy country, ' tis of thee,\n\nSweet land of liberty, of thee I sing;\n\nLand where my fathers died!\n\nLand of the pilgrims' pride!\n\nFrom ev'ry mountainside Let freedom ring!\n\nMy native country, thee,\n\nLand of the noble free, Thy name I love;\n\nI love thy rocks and rills,\n\nThy woods and templed hills;\n\nMy heart with rapture thrills, like that above.\n\nLet music swell the breeze,\n\nAnd ring from all the trees sweet freedom's song;\n\nLet mortal tongues awake;\n\nLet all that breathe partake;\n\nLet rocks their silence break, the sound prolong.\n\nOur fathers' God, to thee,\n\nAuthor of liberty, to thee we sing;\n\nLong may our land be bright\n\nWith freedom's holy light;\n\nProtect us by thy might, great God, our King.\n\nThe lyrics for “America” or “My Country ‘Tis of Thee” was written by Reverend Samuel Francis Smith and set to a pre-existing tune in 1831. First published in 1832, the song was frequently played in the absence of a national anthem. The origin of the song’s melody is disputed, but it is commonly accepted that the tune originated from Europe. Before the melody made its way to the United States, it was already being played in England as early as 1744 as “God Save the King.” By the 1790s, the melody was being used as the Danish national anthem “A Song to be Sung by the Danish Subjects at the Fete of their King, to the Melody of the English Hymn.” The melody was also used as the national anthem in other countries including Prussia and Liechtenstein.\n\nThe first documentation of this song in the American British colonies dates from 1761 with the lyrics of “God Save the King” with slightly modified lyrics. It became known as “Whitefield’s Tune,” published in Urania, a collection of sacred songs compiled by James Lyon.\n\nAfter independence from Britain, the melody was kept intact and the words were adapted for American patriotic use. As he arrived in New York City for his first inauguration in April 1789, George Washington was greeted by crowds singing this tune with different lyrics.\n\nHail, thou auspicious day!\n\nFor let America\n\nThy praise resound.\n\nJoy to our native land!\n\nLet every heart expand,\n\nFor Washington's at hand,\n\nWith glory crowned.\n\nThrice beloved Columbia, hail!\n\nBehold before the gale\n\nYour chief advance.\n\nThe matchless Hero's neigh;\n\nApplaud him to the sky,\n\nWho gave you liberty,\n\nWith gen'rous France.\n\nIn 1831, Samuel Francis Smith wrote the words, that eventually became a tradition to be recited in U.S. schools. His friend, Lowell Mason, had some German school music books that had this tune (Heil dir im Siegerkranz) and asked Smith to either translate the German or write a new text for it. Smith wrote the new lyrics and Mason debuted it at a children’s service at the Park Street Church in Boston, Massachusetts on July 4, 1831.\n\nThe tune for this song would have been familiar to both Allied and Central Powers during the war. The soldiers would have sung this song since childhood. It is interesting to note that there were no protests in singing this song or including it in the song book even though the Germans utilized it as well.\n\nhttps://www.loc.gov/item/ihas.200000012\n\nhttp://www.library.ucsb.edu/OBJID/Cylinder0587\n\nMine eyes have seen the glory of the coming of the Lord\n\nHe is trampling out the vintage where the grapes of wrath are stored\n\nHe hath loosed the fateful lightning of His terrible swift sword\n\nHis truth is marching on\n\n(Chorus)\n\nGlory, Glory, hallelujah!\n\nGlory, glory, hallelujah!\n\nGlory, glory, hallelujah!\n\nHis truth is marching on\n\nI have seen Him in the watch-fires of a hundred circling camps\n\nThey have builded Him an altar in the evening dews and damps\n\nI can read His righteous sentence by the dim and flaring lamps\n\nHis day is marching on.\n\n(Chorus)\n\nGlory, Glory, hallelujah!\n\nGlory, glory, hallelujah!\n\nGlory, glory, hallelujah!\n\nHis truth is marching on\n\nI have read a fiery gospel writ in burnished rows of steel\n\n\"As ye deal with my contemners, so with you my grace shall deal\"\n\nLet the Hero, born of woman, crush the serpent with his heel\n\nSince God is marching on\n\n(Chorus)\n\nGlory, Glory, hallelujah!\n\nGlory, glory, hallelujah!\n\nGlory, glory, hallelujah!\n\nHis truth is marching on\n\nHe has sounded forth the trumpet that shall never call retreat\n\nHe is sifting out the hearts of men before His judgment-seat\n\nOh, be swift, my soul, to answer Him!

James Freeman Clarke when she first heard the soldiers singing \"John Brown's Body.\" Clarke suggested that Howe adopt the song and write better lyrics for it. Howe relates in her memoir what happened the following morning:\n\n“I went to bed that night as usual, and slept, according to my wont, quite soundly. I awoke in the gray of the morning twilight; and as I lay waiting for the dawn, the long lines of the desired poem began to twine themselves in my mind. Having thought out all the stanzas, I said to myself, \"I must get up and write these verses down, lest I fall asleep again and forget them.\" So, with a sudden effort, I sprang out of bed, and found in the dimness an old stump of a pen which I remembered to have used the day before. I scrawled the verses almost without looking at the paper.” (Howe, p. 275.)\n\nLittle did she know that those words would be enshrined in American history.\n\nThe “Battle Hymn of the Republic” is a call to arms and vividly portrays how America fights wars. As a crusader’s cry, this song has been used in grave crises and crucial social movements. However, the song had the greatest resonance when used in wartime. During World War I, the song again reverberated around the nation and added the words: \"We have heard the cry of anguish from the victims of the Hun.\" The “Battle Hymn of the Republic” is a mirror of American society.\n\n(Howe, Julia Ward.

The High School Journal. 2 (5): 152) and reached extreme popularity during the Lincoln administration. The song was eventually adopted as the standard tune of the U.S. Marine Corps Band.\n\nThe originality of the song is debated. Although commonly credited to David T. Shaw, Thomas A’Beckett claimed to have rewritten Shaw’s lyrics before the song was copyrighted. In 1843, Shaw, a singer from Philadelphia, wrote a patriotic poem and commissioned A’Beckett, another musician, to put the words to music. A’Beckett disliked the poem and rewrote the words as he set them to music. Shaw premiered the song soon afterwards and was warmly received by audiences. However, he alone was credited as both composer and lyricist while A’Beckett only as the arranger. A’Beckett contested the authorship and published his own version afterwards.\n\nWhile A’Beckett may have authored “Columbia, the Gem of the Ocean,” he was accused of plagiarizing Stephen Joseph Meany’s “Britannia, the Pride of the Ocean” Meany wrote “Britannia, the Pride of the Ocean” in 1842, but A’Beckett claimed that Meany plagiarized his song instead. Nonetheless, both songs bear similarity.\n\nDuring World War I, this song was used by the Four-Minute Men, volunteers for the propaganda effort who brought messages of patriotism to people on the home front. This song was used as an interlude during public gatherings and in local theaters for audiences to actively participate. The Four-Minute Men stressed the effectiveness of group singing declaring that “the Singing Army, whether it be a fighting army or a working army, cannot be beaten.” This song was also quoted by Charles Ives in his Second Symphony, “A Symphony: New England Holidays,” and Piano Sonata No. 2. composed in 1915.\n\nThe United States in the First World War: An Encyclopedia p.236\n\nhttp://www.library.ucsb.edu/OBJID/Cylinder6576\n\nYes, we'll rally round the flag, boys, we'll rally once again\n\nShouting the battle cry of freedom\n\nWe will rally from the hillside, we'll gather from the plain\n\nShouting the battle cry of freedom!\n\n(Chorus)\n\nThe Union forever!

Hurrah, boys, hurrah!\n\nDown with the traitors, up with the stars;\n\nWhile we rally round the flag, boys, rally once again\n\nShouting the battle cry of freedom!\n\nPopularly known as a Civil War era song, “The Battle Cry of Freedom” was written by George Frederick Root as a response to President Lincoln’s call for troops and to advocate the causes of the Union and abolitionism. Although intended for the Union, it was very popular that it was adapted by H.L. Schreiner and W.H. Barnes for the Confederacy. During its popularity, the song was used as a presidential campaign song starting with the Lincoln-Johnson ticket in the 1864 presidential election and after the Civil War.\n\nHenry Stone, a Union war veteran, recalls in a report from 1887 how popular this song was among Union soldiers:\n\nA glee club came down from Chicago, bringing with them the new song, \"We'll rally 'round the flag, boys\", and it ran through the camp like wildfire. The effect was little short of miraculous. It put as much spirit and cheer into the army as a victory. Day and night one could hear it by every camp fire and in every tent. I never shall forget how the men rolled out the line, \"And although he may be poor, he shall never be a slave.\" I do not know whether Mr. Root knows what good work his song did for us there, but I hope so.\n\nThis song was also very popular with civilians and it is reported that Root and Cady, the most popular music publisher during the Civil War, had 14 printing presses running at the same time and could not keep up with the demand. It is estimated that around 700,000 copies were put into circulation by the end of the war.\n\nWith freedom as the main subject, this song would have resonated with many Americans during the World War I. Given its popularity before and during the war, many soldiers sent to the front would have been raised hearing this song and thus, very familiar with it.\n\nHenry Stone, The Century Illustrated, \"Memoranda on the Civil War: A Song in Camp\" (1887)\n\nhttp://www.library.ucsb.edu/OBJID/Cylinder16605\n\nAllons enfants de la Patrie, Arise, children of the Fatherland,\n\nLe jour de gloire est arrivé!

Water our furrows!\n\nComposed during the French Revolution by Claude-Joseph Rouget de Lisle, “La Marseillaise” secured its popularity in France and was recognized as the national anthem by the National Convention in 1795. After briefly losing its status during Napoleon’s reign, the song was reinstated as France’s national anthem in 1879.\n\nThe lyrics are clearly a call to arms and reflect the invasion of France by foreign adversaries, specifically Prussia and Austria. These countries were at war with France at the time the song was written. On the night of April 25, 1792, only a few days after France declared war on Austria, P.F. Dietrich, the mayor of Strasbourg, asked his guest Lisle to “write for us a song that will rally our soldiers from all over to defend their homeland that is under threat and you will have won the nation.” Lisle responded by writing “La Marseillaise.” Originally entitled “Chant de guerre de l’armée du Rhin” (War Song of the Army of the Rhine), the anthem came to be known as “La Marseillaise” because of its popularity with volunteer army units from Marseille. Indeed, Dietrich recognized that France needed a marching song that could raise the morale of the soldiers.\n\nIn the context of World War I, “La Marseillaise” was a rallying cry for cohesion. Prior to the war, the role of the song had a different function. “La Marseillaise” was used in the French Revolution as a political song, but prior to World War I, workers preferred “L’Internationale” composed in 1888. Changes were also observed from Russia. From February to November 1917, “La Marseillaise” was used as the official anthem of the Russian provisional government until the Bolsheviks replaced it with “Internationale.” With France facing increasing tensions from the Central Powers, the French education minister, Maurice-Louis Faure, made it compulsory for “La Marseillaise” to be taught in schools. The song became known as a pledge of French political unity against German aggression during the war. According to a report, the song was sung both in the trenches and civilian areas, café terraces, theaters, and official ceremonies. Intent on keeping this fervor, the ashes of Lisle were exhumed from the cemetery of Choisy-le-Roi, paraded across the streets of Paris, and eventually interred under the Dôme des Invalides in Paris following a formal ceremony on July 14, 1915.\n\nhttps://www.britannica.com/topic/La-Marseillaise\n\n\"La Marseillaise\" (in French).

Even Germany adopted the song for its own national use. During the war, British tommies singing this song were joined by American doughboys whose “My Country Tis of Thee” had the same tune and Germans had an identical tune with their own “Heil di rim Siegerkranz” (“Hail thee in victor’s crown”). Interestingly, during World War II, “Roll out the barrel” was similarly sung on both sides of the front. Although Nazis claimed it as a German folk song, the lyrics could be traced back to Tin Pan Alley.\n\nThe origins of this song are unclear, but it is known that the song was performed publicly in 1745 in two theaters in London. Given its rising popularity, Beethoven published seven variations of the theme in 1807 along with five variations of “Rule Britannia.” Thus, both British and German troops were familiar with the tune well before World War I. With its prayer-like quality, “God Save the King” gave the soldier a chance to reflect on his role of defending his cultural traditions, family, and country.\n\nNettl, Paul.

He was killed in action near Lierre but had written the first two versions of the song. The first version was sung on September 12, 1830 at the Theatre de la Monnaire in Brussels when Belgium was still part of the Kingdom of The Netherlands under the rule of the House of Orange and pledged loyalty to the King. The lyrics of the song included an imagery that portrayed Belgium as a ripening fruit on the tree of liberty. The second version was written during the street fighting in which Belgium won its independence. While keeping the imagery of the tree, the ruling House of Orange is severely criticized:\n\nOff freedom’s tree Orange is hacked.\n\nIn 1860, the statesman Charles Rogier wrote a new text which omitted all references to Holland and replaced it with lyrics that focused on telling the glory of Belgium. At the end of every stanza, he wrote, “Le Roi, la loi, la liberte” (“For King and law and Liberty”). The melody written by Campenhout was retained and the anthem was officially recognized in this form. The version in the Army songbook is from 1860.\n\nNettl, Paul. National Anthems. 2d, Enl. ed.

Garibaldi proclaimed himself dictator and overthrew the Bourbons in Naples. Since then, the song has been known in Italy as the “Inno di Garibaldi.”\n\nAs opposed to the previous national anthems, the Garibaldi hymn was sung out of national fury. Foreign intruders were made well aware about the people’s determined opposition. Hurling the catchphrase of the song, “Va fuora d’Italia” (“Get out of Italy”) at the intruders, the fiery march was an important element to galvanize national unity against foreign invasions. The opening phrase, “All armi” (“To arms”) seems to help the overall message of collective military unity.\n\nNettl, Paul. National Anthems. 2d, Enl. ed.

Farwell’s musical training was unorthodox, and he did not intend to make music as a career. However, while studying electrical engineering at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in 1893, he became convinced that being a professional musician was his destiny. After graduation, Farwell studied music with George Whitefield Chadwick and Homer Norris and traveled to Europe to study with Engelbert Humperdinck and Hans Pfitzner in 1897. He later studied counterpoint with Alexandre Guilmant in Paris. In 1899, he returned home to America and was appointed as lecturer at Cornell University from 1899 to 1901. It was here that he encountered Alice Fletcher’s compilation of Indian Story and Song from North America. This book sparked his interest in Native American themes.\n\nAlthough his early compositions contain traces of German Wagnerian styles, this was soon to change. He soon adopted a more personal style ranging from experimentation to using bold harmonies that led people to compare his compositions to that of Charles Ives. In 1901, he established the Wa-Wan Press, a self-publishing company, to publish his Native-American inspired compositions. As early as 1901, he hoped that publishing this genre would allow a classical music revolution to begin that would rebel against “German domination” of the nation’s music. He thought that the American public “saw everything through German glasses” and “a revolt against this domination was an absolute historical necessity.” Although Wa-Wan Press would eventually be acquired by G. Schirmer Music Publishing, it was with this anti-German spirit that led him to write “March, March” in 1916.\n\nFarwell also served as the chief music critic for Musical America from 1909 to 1914 and was appointed in 1910 as Supervisor of Municipal Concerts by New York Mayor William J. Gaynor. During this time, he composed music for community pageants and outdoor events that reflected his idea of a new American art form. Surely, he was aware of the growing public opinion to support the war. The U.S. Army then hired Farwell during World War I to serve as the Army’s first consultant on group singing.\n\nhttps://www.loc.gov/item/ihas.200035729/\n\nCulbertson, Evelyn Davis (Summer 1987). \"Arthur Farwell's Early Efforts on Behalf of American Music, 1889-1921\".

He joined the Massachusetts State Guard Company C on August 2, 1917 and was commissioned as second lieutenant. Eventually, he was transferred to the Thirteenth Infantry Regiment, Third Brigade where he was honorably discharged as captain.\n\nIn December 1917, Converse was called to New York to attend a meeting of the National Committee on Army and Navy Camp Music. He was appointed to serve on the committee in January 1918 and tasked to organize and encourage singing in the camps. He helped compile and publish the Army Song Book. He was active in issuing the weekly bulletin Music in the Camps and helped reorganized the military bands. Thus, he was instrumental in deciding what songs to include in this song book.\n\nAs requested by the Commission on Training Camp Activities, Converse collaborated with John Alden Carpenter in completing an orchestral arrangement of the Star Spangled Banner. Premiered by the Boston Symphony Orchestra on August 26, 1918, this arrangement was used also by other orchestras during the war and was still being used by the Boston Symphony as late as 1942. He also arranged an orchestral version of America for the Boston Pops Orchestra that was later recorded with Arthur Fiedler conducting.\n\nWhile Converse composed several patriotic songs during the war, “Under the Stars and Stripes” and “The Service Stars Are Shining” remained the two most popular. As attested by Mrs. Converse’s diary entry on May 27, 1918 before the concert, Converse had “his ‘Stars and Stripes’ sung by a chorus of 100 at the Pops tonight and is to conduct it himself.”\n\nFrederick Shepherd Converse (1871-1940): His Life and Music\n\nThe Annotated Army Song Book Part 2\n\nO beautiful for spacious skies,\n\nFor amber waves of grain,\n\nFor purple mountain majesties\n\nAbove the fruited plain!\n\nAmerica!

In her memoir, she recalls how her trip led her to encounter the Chicago World’s Fair and the Colorado Springs - experiences that are reflected in the grandeur lyrics of the song. Silas G. Pratt, the first composer to set the lyrics to music published the song in 1895. Although many people enjoyed the lyrics, there were calls to revise it. They felt that the music did not match the eloquence of the lyrics. Consequently, many other composers tried to set the lyrics to their own music and the song was repeatedly revised with Bates’ permission to fit their own music. The song was not associated with one tune. The lyrics today are usually set to Samuel A. Ward’s “Materna” composed in 1882.\n\nThe version in the Army Song Book was written by Will C. Macfarlane, an organist and composer of Portland, Maine. Ms. Bates says in her memoir that Macfarlane’s version was played on the city chimes of Springfield, Massachusetts and was received with “widest acceptance. This spirited march was also arranged for band music and hymn singing. Both hymn and march versions are said to have been used in war-recruitment and patriotic meetings.\n\nPrior and during the war, the beginning of the fourth stanza, “O beautiful for patriot dream” was changed to “O beautiful for patriot drum” in reference to the military. In a copy from a church leaflet, the stanza was also changed to “O beautiful for patriot dress.” In Bates’ memoir, she recalls that the song was popular in church services. The mention of “patriot dress” may refer to the new uniform the soldiers were wearing. One can imagine the climactic effect this stanza would have produced when recalling how people must have felt bidding their young soldiers farewell.\n\n“America the Beautiful” also expresses a love of home that includes patriotic references. As the song progresses, soldiers are called to defend the homeland: “Oh, beautiful for heroes proved In liberating strife, Who more than self their country loved, And mercy more than life!” This would have led soldiers to believe that their love of home justified their efforts of defeating Germany and preventing the enemy to attack the homeland.\n\nhttp://museumsonthegreen.org/wp-content/uploads/Katharine-Lee-Bates-describes-how-she-wrote-America-The-Beautiful-after-1922-signed.pdf\n\nhttps://digitalcommons.library.umaine.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1437&context=mmb-me\n\nhttp://www.loc.gov/jukebox/recordings/detail/id/7689\n\n1.

In the quiet hours Of the starry night\n\nDream the dreams of far away Home fires burning bright.\n\n(Refrain)\n\nFor the long, long road to Tipperary Is the road that leads me home\n\nO’er hills and plains, By lakes and lanes, My Woodlands! My Cornfields! My Country! My Home!\n\nThis song was composed by John Alden Carpenter, a member of the National Committee on Army and Navy Camp Music. Educated at Harvard by the conservative German-influenced composer John Knowles Paine, Carpenter abandoned the German style and became known as a conservative composer influenced by 20th-century French and German music. He later explored on combining his impressionistic compositional style with jazz rhythms. His “Concertino for Piano and Orchestra” composed in 1917 and ballet “Krazy Kat: A Jazz Pantomime” completed in 1922 incorporate jazz rhythms with traditional conventions of harmony.\n\nCarpenter composed two songs to support the war effort: “The Home Road” and “Khaki Sammy.” Howard Pollack’s book John Alden Carpenter: A Chicago Composer briefly discusses the inspiration for “The Home Road.” “On a hot summer’s night in 1917 (presumably in Charlotte, Vermont), he watched a seven-piece band followed by a group of young inductees marching along with their suitcases in hand. At first, he found the procession amusing, but then he sobered at the thought of what lay ahead for the recruits and immediately wrote the words and music to ‘The Home Road.’”\n\nThe refrain,” “the long, long road to Tipperary,” refers to the 1912 English music hall popular song. “It’s a long, long way to Tipperary,” a well-known song among British and American soldiers. Perhaps Carpenter heard this song being played by the newly recruited soldiers during their march that summer night in 1917. Although not a direct quotation, Carpenter kept the words while modifying the melodic shape.\n\nThere are three versions of the song: a preliminary untitled sketch with only a melodic line with one verse, a fair copy entitled “Land of Mine,” also just one verse that was published on August 4, 1917. Schirmer however published a version with two verses dated July 1917. The July date Schirmer adopted may refer to its original composition rather than the actual publishing date. Schirmer’s edition was chosen for the Army Song Book.\n\nExamining the three versions reveal rhetorical musical differences. While the sketch begins “Sing a song of freedom! Sing a song of joy! Sing a song of victory, as our boys march by,” the song in the Army Song Book reads, “Sing a hymn of freedom! Fling the banner high! Sing the songs of liberty, Songs that shall not die.” Changing “sing a song of joy!” to \"fling the banner high!\" shifts the focus from the bystander watching the parade to the active duty soldier. \"Song of freedom\" is also changed to \"hymn of freedom\" giving the song a more patriotic communal feel.\n\nThese changes may have been done to tailor the song to the objectives of the singing army. Similarly, the fair copy reads, “My Cornfields! My Rivers!” While providing references to country and home, the asymmetrical cadence lets the song’s climax fall on “Rivers.” By changing the phrase to “My Woodlands! My Cornfields!” the emphasis is now on “Cornfields.” This change portrays the American landscape as an untouched place that soldiers dreamed to return to, a place in stark contrast to the European battlefields destroyed by the war. “The Home Road” not only provide soldiers references to look forward going home, but also serve as a reminder of the causes they were fighting for and the protection of the American homeland from the destruction they witnessed on the battlefield.\n\nJohn Alden Carpenter: A Chicago Composer.

Benson. Originally composed without words, Edgar composed the melody in 1901 as the Trio for his “Pomp and Circumstance March No. 1.” The premier performance was done at Queen’s Hall during the London Promenade Concert. Conducted by Henry Wood, he remembered that the piece was very much appreciated by the audience and they “rose and yelled … the one and only time in the history of the Promenade concerts that an orchestral item was accorded a double encore.” (Henry Wood, My Life of Music, p.154). Soon, the trio caught the attention of the soon-to-be-crowned King Edward VII who suggested to Elgar that adding words to the trio would make a great song. Elgar enlisted the help of Arthur C. Benson, a prolific writer and poet, to provide the lyrics. In time for Edward VII’s coronation in August 1902, Elgar and Benson finished the Coronation Ode and placed the “Land of Hope and Glory” as the climax and finale. The song evolved into a patriotic song ever since it was premiered and many lobbyists today are calling to replace the current national anthem, “God Save the Queen” with this song.\n\nThe song was introduced to America soon after its premiere. In 1905, Elgar was invited by his friend, Samuel Sanford, to receive an honorary doctorate at Yale University. At the end of the graduation ceremony, Sanford directed the band to play “Pomp and Circumstance” as the recessional music. The faculty was delighted with the music and later adopted it for future graduations. Princeton soon followed the practice in 1907.\n\nAs with the previous selections featuring foreign national anthems, the goal of including “Land of Hope and Glory” in the Army Song Book would have been to unify the Allied forces. The song continued to be very popular in Britain. At the Grand Patriotic Concert held at the Royal Albert Hall in October 1914, Clara Butt, a popular singer, sang this song as the finale with Elgar as the conductor. Audiences jumped to their feet waving Union Jack flags. The upper portion of the concert flyer includes a quotation of the fifth stanza of the second verse. “Land of Hope and Glory” proved to be a popular song during the war.\n\nhttps://www.pri.org/stories/2016-06-17/wild-english-roots-song-youll-hear-every-graduation-summer\n\nhttps://www.royalalberthall.com/about-the-hall/news/2014/august/music-at-the-royal-albert-hall-during-the-first-world-war/\n\nWe gather together to ask the Lord’s blessing;\n\nHe chastens and hastens His will to make known;\n\nThe wicked oppressing cease them from distressing,\n\nSing praises to His Name, He forgets not His own.\n\nBeside us to guide us, our God with us joining,\n\nOrdaining, maintaining His kingdom divine,\n\nSo from the beginning the fight we were winning;\n\nThou, Lord, wast at our side, all glory be Thine!\n\nWe all do extol Thee, Thou Leader in battle,\n\nAnd pray that Thou still our Defender wilt be.\n\nLet Thy congregation escape tribulation:\n\nThy Name be forever praised! O Lord, make us free! Lord, make us free!\n\nOriginally a Dutch Christian hymn written in 1597 by Adrianus Valerius as “Wilt heden nu treden,” this song was composed to celebrate the Dutch victory over the Spanish forces at the Battle of Turnhout. The melody, however, is borrowed from a familiar Dutch folk melody. Overcoming religious oppression, the Dutch Protestants celebrated their victory over the Catholic Spanish forces by adopting a folk tune and setting a religious text. This would have been forbidden under the Spanish rule and seen as an act of defiance.\n\nAlthough foreign in origin, the song has strong connections to American culture that can be traced back to two origins. As suggested by Melanie Kirkpatrick, “it’s tantalizing to think that the English Pilgrims – in exile in Holland, the only place where could worship freely – may have been familiar with ‘Wilt heden nu treden.’” This is because many of the pilgrims spoke Dutch and were Dutch citizens. The second origin may have been attributed to the Dutch settlers who brought it with them to America as early as the 1620s. Although the piece contains religious references, it is important to note that this hymn would not have been sung in Dutch Protestant churches since they saw this as idolatry. They only allowed psalms to be sung in the church.\n\nHowever, in 1937, the Christian Reformed Church in North America composed of Dutch immigrants made the controversial decision to include it in the hymnal.\n\nPerhaps attesting to its popularity, the translated “We Gather Together” was chosen as the first hymn in the hymnal. It was already popular in school songbooks prior to the decision of the Christian Reformed Church. The Methodist-Episcopal Church adopted this song in 1935.\n\nThe English translation came from the American composer, Theodore Baker. In 1894, he arranged it for a choir and translated it as a “Prayer of Thanksgiving.” Thus, the piece was associated with Thanksgiving among the non-Dutch speaking communities and public schools at the turn of the 20th-century in America. Both associations with war and Thanksgiving helped spread the popularity of the piece. Michael Hawn, professor of sacred music at Southern Methodist University’s Perkins School of Theology, said that “by World War I, we started to see ourselves in this hymn.” He continued that “people take stock of themselves at Thanksgiving...we’ve all survived some turbulent times.” The popularity of this song would have achieved a number of objectives. First, the association with Thanksgiving would have reminded soldiers of their families, their homes, and their country – entities that they have vowed to protect from destruction. Second, the song’s popularity would have resonated in the Belgian Dutch-speaking community on the Western Front and allowed the Americans and Belgian resistance to unite in their war efforts.\n\nWhile the hymn’s original purpose referenced “the wicked oppressing” of the Spanish Catholics, the soldiers would have viewed the hymn in the context of World War I as a plea to be defended against the German army.\n\nKirkpatrick, Melanie (November 22, 2005). \"A Hymn's Long Journey Home: The surprising origins of \"We Gather Together,\" a Thanksgiving standard\".

Batt'ry Halt!\n\nThe “U.S. Field Artillery March” is a patriotic military march written by John Philip Sousa in 1917. U.S. Army Lieutenant George Friedlander of the 306th Field Artillery asked Sousa, who served in the U.S. Navy, to compose a march for his regiment based on “The Caisson Song” thinking that the song was originally from the Civil War. Mistakenly presuming the composer was dead and the song in public domain, Sousa agreed, changed the harmonic structure, set a different key, made it more march-like, and added more material. Both Sousa and Friedlander were later surprised to learn that the composer, artillery First Lieutenant Edmund L. Gruber, was still alive and that the song was composed in 1908 when Gruber was stationed at Fort Stotsenburg in the Philippines during the American occupation following the Philippines-American war.\n\nThe lyrics for “The Caisson Song” was written by Lieutenant Robert M. Danford. It was a recount of the difficult march encountered by Gruber and Danford through the Zambales Mountains of Luzon, Philippines. Gruber scouted the area with a small detachment to select the best route for his battalion. Climbing higher to get a better view, he looked back at the marching companies and heard one of the section chiefs shout to his drivers, “Come on! Keep ‘em rolling!” Since the song stated that “the caissons go rolling along,” this phrase referenced the artillery rather than the men. Caisson, a two-wheeled cart designed to carry artillery and ammunition, was pulled by horses. The version in the Army Song Book was arranged by Robert Lloyd for piano and voice in 1918. Viewed as an instant success in the army, this song would have been popular among the soldiers and thus included in the song book.\n\nThis song inspired “The Army Goes Rolling Along” which would later be adopted as the official song of the U.S. Army. Interestingly, Gruber was the descendant of Franz Gruber, composer of “Silent Night,” the song sung during the Christmas Truce of 1914.\n\nhttps://www.loc.gov/item/ihas.200000019/\n\nBierly, Paul. The Works of John Philip Sousa, pp. 93-94 (Integrity Press, 1984)\n\nOh, they said the coast artillery would never go to war,\n\nAnd all that they were fit for was to hang around the shore.\n\nBut when in France they needed men to shoot the tens and twelves.\n\nWhy, they cabled to the President to send our loyal selves.\n\n(Chorus)\n\nThen, it’s home, boys, home, it’s home that we should be.\n\nIt’s home, boys, home, when the nation shall be free.\n\nWe’re in this war until it ends, and Germany will see\n\nThat the end of all the Kaisers is the Coast Artillery.\n\nWhen British Tommies took the field to stop the barb’rous Hun,\n\nThey found their light artillery was beaten gun for gun.\n\nSo Marshall French got on the wire and quickly told the king\n\nThat the garrison artillery would be the only thing.\n\n(Chorus)\n\nSo, limber up the sixes and tens and other guns,\n\nAnd bracket on the O.T. line until you get the Hun.\n\nThere may be many plans and schemes to set this old world free,\n\nBut you’ll find in every one a part for the coast artillery.\n\n(Chorus)\n\nThis song is adopted from the Irish tune “Rambling Wreck of Poverty” or “The Son of a Gambolier” which has served as an inspiration for Georgia Tech’s school song, “I’m a Rambling Wreck From Georgia Tech” and Woody Guthrie’s “Biggest Thing That Man Has Ever Done.” Charles Ives also adapted this tune as part of his song cycle Five Street Songs.\n\nThe subject of this song has little to do with the American army. Marshall French, mentioned in verse three was the First Earl of Ypres who commanded of the British Army from 1914 to 1915 and earned the title of earl for his efforts on the Second Battle of Ypres in May, 1915. Since America entered the war in April 1917, the American coast artillery was not involved in the Second Battle of Ypres.\n\nThis song would have appealed to Irish-American soldiers and other soldiers would have viewed the song as a collage of the leaders: president, king, and kaiser. However, the mention of “home” in the chorus would have appealed collectively to the soldiers as a reassurance that they were heading home once victory was won and “the nation shall be free.”\n\nReveille:\n\nI can't get 'em up,\n\nI can't get 'em up,\n\nI can't get 'em up this morning;\n\nI can't get 'em up,\n\nI can't get 'em up,\n\nI can't get 'em up at all!\n\nCorporal's worse than the privates,\n\nSergeant's worse than the corporals,\n\nLieutenant's worse than the sergeants,\n\nAn’ the Capt’ns worst of all.\n\nMess Call:\n\nSoupy, soupy, soup, without a single bean;\n\nPorky, porky, pork, without a streak of lean;\n\nCoffee, coffee, without any cream (or the weakest ever seen.)\n\nStable Call:\n\nCome all who are able and go the stable,\n\nAnd water your horses and give them some corn.\n\nFor if you don’t do it the colnel will know it And then you will rue it assure as you’re born.\n\nTaps:\n\n1.

Peaceful dreams\n\nThese short tunes comprise a collection of trumpet or bugle calls designed to announce both scheduled and non-scheduled events in a military setting. Historically used to communicate with troops during battles, the bugle was eventually used also to indicate the change in daily routines of the camp. Since there are no moveable valves in the bugle, the notes on all the calls come from a single overtone series. Although there are no official lyrics for these trumpet calls, soldiers eventually added their own lyrics.\n\nReveille: This call was used to wake military personnel at sunrise at which time the U.S. flag is raised and all U.S. military personnel are required to stand at attention outdoors in uniform and salute the flag.\n\nMess Call: As implied by the lyrics, this call is played as signal to personnel mealtimes which is used for all meals.\n\nStable Call: Used by Cavalry forces, this call was played as signal to those tending the stables that the horses needed to be fed and watered. It was also during this time that the horses were groomed and the stables cleaned.\n\nTaps: This was played as the last call for the day and signaled that unauthorized lights be extinguished. The call was also used to signal the completion of a military funeral ceremony and the end of war. On November 11, 1918 at 11AM, General Pershing ordered Hartley Edwards, lead bugle of the drum and bugle corps, to play Taps that signaled the end of World War I.\n\nhttp://www.library.ucsb.edu/OBJID/Cylinder15884\n\nWay down upon de Swanee Ribber,\n\nFar, far away,\n\nDere's wha my heart is turning ebber,\n\nDere's wha de old folks stay.\n\nAll up and down de whole creation\n\nSadly I roam,\n\nStill longing for de old plantation,\n\nAnd for the old folks at home.\n\n(Chorus)\n\nAll de world am sad and dreary,\n\nEb-rywhere I roam;\n\nOh, darkeys, how my heart grows weary,\n\nFar from de old folks at home!\n\nAll 'round de little farm I wander’d\n\nWhen I was young,\n\nDen many happy days I squander’d,\n\nMany de songs I sung.\n\nWhen I was playing wid my brudder\n\nHappy was I;\n\nOh, take me to my kind old mudder!\n\nDere let me live and die\n\n(Chorus)\n\nOriginally composed as a minstrel song by Stephen Foster in 1851, “Swanee River” or “Old Folks at Home” captured the American spirit of the 19th century with its distinct dialect spoken by African-American slaves. The song was a tribute to Suwanee River, a major river running through South Georgia into Florida.\n\nWritten from the perspective of a slave, the narrator expresses his “longing for de old plantation.” Although the theme is about the desperation of family separation due to the practice of slave owners selling a slave to another plantation, this phrase has often been misunderstood as romanticizing slavery. Indeed, Foster wrote that “One reviewer called the ‘homely tune’ a ‘catching, melodic itch of the time’….. and nearly everyone scratched, be they Irish or German immigrants feeling homesick for the old country, frontiersmen or forty-niners pining for the folks they had left behind in the East or African Americans forcibly separated from their birthplaces and families. ‘Old Folks at Home’ was all things to all people” (Emerson p.182).\n\nMany people would have been familiar with this song. The song became so popular that it attracted tourists to visit Suwanee River in Florida to view the symbolic and idyllic home described in the lyrics. It was even included in several songbooks prior to the war. From 1935 to 2013, “The Swanee River” was the official state song of Florida.\n\nThis Dixie song would not only have evoked nostalgia and homesickness to soldiers in the trenches, but would have also appealed to most soldiers from the Southern states. Foster’s songs were so popular that many of his songs were published as song sheets. In 1951, the U.S. Congress paid tribute to Foster by designating his songs, “Old Black Joe,” “My Old Kentucky Home,” and “Old Folks at Home” as “national expressions of democracy” and declared Stephen Foster as the “Father of American folk music.” All three songs were included in the Army Song Book.\n\nReinventing Dixie: Tin Pan Alley's Songs and the Creation of the Mythic South.

Foster, a supporter of the North during the Civil War, is heavily influenced by Charles Shiras, a friend who led abolitionist activities in Pennsylvania. With this mindset, Foster would humanize his characters in his songs that convey a message that people, regardless of ethnicity or class share a longingness of family and home. His songs in the Army Song Book would have resonated with the soldiers the importance of home, family, and compassion for their comrades in the battlefield.\n\nhttp://www.library.ucsb.edu/OBJID/Cylinder0078\n\nThe sun shines bright in the old Kentucky home.\n\n'Tis summer, the darkies are gay,\n\nThe corn top's ripe and the meadow's in the bloom\n\nWhile the birds make music all the day.\n\nThe young folks roll on the little cabin floor,\n\nAll merry, all happy, and bright.\n\nBy’n by hard times comes a-knocking at the door,\n\nThen my old Kentucky home, good night.\n\n(Chorus)\n\nWeep no more my lady, O weep no more today!\n\nWe will sing one song for the old Kentucky home,\n\nFor the old Kentucky home, far away.\n\nThey hunt no more for the 'possum and the coon,\n\nOn the meadow, the hill and the shore,\n\nThey sing no more by the glimmer of the moon,\n\nOn the bench by the old cabin door.\n\nThe day goes by like a shadow o'er the heart,\n\nWith sorrow where all was delight.\n\nThe time has come when the darkies have to part,\n\nThen my old Kentucky home, good night!\n\n(Chorus)\n\nAlso known as “Poor Uncle Tom, Good Night,” this song by Foster was written in 1852 as a response to Harriet Beecher Stowe’s novel, “Uncle Tom.” Aligned with his support for the Abolitionist movement, Foster wrote the lyrics so that the narrator laments his imminent move away from home and looks fondly back on his life in Kentucky before being sent away to slavery. The song carries overtones of death as the slave forecasts overwork and brutal mistreatment in the “land where the sugar canes grow.” His master sold him to a plantation in the Deep South.\n\nAs soon as it was first published in 1852, the song grew popular quickly and sold thousands of copies within days of its release. The issue of equality in American social and political hemispheres evolved rapidly in the years leading to the Civil War and the years prior to America’s entry into World War I.\n\nAmerica’s idea of equality, an element that was still in its infancy in World War I, was noted by the abolitionist Frederick Douglass, “My Old Kentucky Home awakens the sympathies for the slave, in which anti-slavery principles take root, grow, and flourish.”\n\nThis song was adopted as the official state song of Kentucky in 1928.\n\nhttp://www.library.ucsb.edu/OBJID/Cylinder5177\n\nI wish I was in de land ob cotton, Old times dar am not forgotten,\n\nLook away!

Look away! Look away! Dixie Land.\n\nDen hoe it down an’ scratch your grabble, To Dixie Land I’m bound to trable\n\nLook away! Look away! Look away! Dixie Land.\n\n(Chorus)\n\nDaniel Decatur Emmett in 1859 wrote this song for a blackface minstrel show that would become popular in the North. Although Emmett was an abolitionist, “Dixie” would later be associated with the Confederacy and the South.\n\nThe song acknowledges that blacks long to be in “de land ob cotton,” and like many minstrel songs, the song reinforces the image of African-Americans as happy yet enduring the hardships of slavery. The song carries an ironic tone – why will the narrator, a slave, be happy to remember the “Old times dar am not forgotten?” Allowing Southerners to believe the black man as happy despite slavery would have let soldiers on both sides laugh at the whole situation. Soldiers in the trenches would have felt something similar to this. It is not difficult to speculate that these horrible conditions encountered would have shared light-hearted moments with their comrades by singing this tune. This song would have appealed to a diverse audience.\n\nThe song was popular prior and during the war. The earliest known recording of this song was performed by Billy Murray, in a duet with Ada Jones, in 1916.\n\nThe Annotated Army Song Book Part 3\n\nhttp://www.library.ucsb.edu/OBJID/Cylinder9291\n\nCarry me back to old Virginny.\n\nThere's where the cotton and corn and taters grow.\n\nThere's where the birds warble sweet in the spring-time.\n\nThere's where this old darkey's heart am long'd to go.\n\nThere's where I labor’d so hard for old massa,\n\nDay after day in the field of yellow corn;\n\nNo place on earth do I love more sincerely\n\nThan old Virginny, the State where I was born.\n\n[Refrian]\n\nCarry me back to old Virginny.\n\nThere's where the cotton and the corn and taters grow;\n\nThere's where the birds warble sweet in the spring-time.\n\nThere's where this old darkey's heart am long'd to go.\n\n“Carry Me Back to Old Virginny” was written by James A. Bland, an African-American minstrel performer in 1878. As with the previous pieces, the lyrics contain several pseudo-African American colloquialisms that are racially sensitive including personal experiences as seen in this song where the singer expects to meet his “Massa...where the cotton and the corn and taters grow.” However, this time, the songwriter is an African-American. This gives listeners a chance to hear a song from the perspective of black Americans. The song tells of a slave who wants to return home to Virginia where he was born, a narrative that would have evoked nostalgia among soldiers as they looked forward to homecoming day.\n\nMinstrel songs, where this song was popularized, were often met with controversy. While integrationists saw these shows as a misleading picture of showing happy slaves while poking fun at them at the same time, segregationists thought these shows broke social norms as they depicted runaway slaves. With audiences in the shows knowing that the composer is black, the issue of race would have played an important role in popularizing this song.\n\nNevertheless, the song was popular prior to America’s entry into World War I and was commonly used in the repertoire for minstrel performances. In 1915, Alma Gluck and Len Spencer recorded this song and because of its popularity, it became one of the most recorded songs of the pre-war era. “Carry Me Back to Old Virginny” became the official song of Virginia in 1940.\n\nMusic of the First World War p.97 By Don Tyler\n\nA History of the Minstrel Show (2000) By Frank W.

Oh, mourners, you ought,\n\n5. Oh, seekers, you ought t’have been there\n\n6. Oh, mothers, you ought\n\n7. Oh, children, you ought,\n\nWritten as a spiritual by Charles Wesley in the 18th century, this song was sung at religious camp meetings as part of the Second Great Awakening. In the 19th and early 20th century, the song was mostly popular among African-Americans.\n\n“Roll, Jordan, Roll” reflects the Biblical story of Joshua and the Israelites crossing the River Jordan into the Promised Land of Israel. Black slaves during the Civil War felt similarly as many of them sought refuge in their promise land, the free North where slavery was outlawed. Similar to the Israelites, slaves had to cross the Mississippi or Ohio Rivers to cross into the North. In James Cone’s book, Black Theology and Black Power, he suggests that referencing the River Jordan not only expressed freedom, but death – a death that was seen as a liberation from the harsh realities of slave life.\n\nDuring the Civil War, spirituals were considered to be “code songs,” songs that contain lyrics referencing the Underground Railroad as a way to escape slavery. Songs used biblical imagery and the expression of desire to be free from bondage in the lyrics contain codes to help slaves find a way to escape to the slave-free North. The slave master however has no grasp of its interpretation. Given its popularity, the genre of spirituals influenced the creation of blues. After the Civil War, large numbers of rural blacks began moving to urban cities such as New Orleans. They developed the blues, a fusion of ragtime and spirituals.\n\nDuring the war, the song was popular among black soldiers. However, with some modifications. Arthur Little, commander of the regimental band, attested that when they were passing through Vitryle-Francois in France, the black soldiers sang:\n\nRoll, Jordan, roll – roll, Jordan, roll –\n\nSoldier, you’ll be called on\n\nTo shake that thing you’re sittin’ on,\n\nThere’s a battle being fought in the Argonne,\n\nRoll, Jordan, roll\n\nPray for forgiveness, Pray for forgiveness –\n\nPray for forgiveness –\n\nThat’s all a poor black sinner can do\n\nIn France, black regiments were under the French command. African-American spirituals were used to console recuperating French and later American soldiers returning from the front. The French welcomed spirituals as a way to express sentimentalism and hope.\n\nThese songs evoke spiritual meaning to the soldiers. Originally used in religious camp meetings and popularized later on by slaves, spirituals functioned as a common ground for both social classes and as a social commentary for the people singing the song.\n\nNelson, Peter.

Since chariots or horse travel were mainly used by white people during the Civil War and even during World War I, the mere mention of chariot in the context of a spiritual, which was popularized by slaves, creates an interesting contradiction of themes. Simply, how will the lowest social class be able to ride in the highest social form of transportation? In the context of military organization, it is not too far to think that many privates, to whom the Army Songbook was intended, would have had the ambition to achieve a higher rank.\n\nHowever, there is an underlying ironic message in verse 1.\n\nI looked over Jordan, and what did I see?\n\nComing for to carry me home,\n\nA band of angels coming after me\n\nComing for to carry me home.\n\nAs mentioned in the previous song, the mention of Jordan expresses both death and homecoming. Verse 1 seems to express death rather than an ambition to achieve a higher rank. This song may have had this dual feeling of returning home to their families as well as dying in battle with “a band of angels coming after me, coming for to carry me home.”\n\nSince 1988, this song has been the favorite of English rugby fans.\n\nhttp://www.library.ucsb.edu/OBJID/Cylinder1968\n\n1.

Indeed, the harpist Melville Clark recalls that President Wilson, who was an avid singer oftentimes asked Clark to play this song; “soon the president began to sing in a clear, lyric tenor voice.”\n\nPresidential Praise: Our Presidents and Their Hymns By C.

Well known especially in the English-speaking world, it has traditionally been associated with New Year’s Eve, funerals, and occasions that evoke farewell or symbolize endings and new beginnings.\n\nTo illustrate the international popularity of the song, a letter from Sir Edward Hulse of the Scots Guards remembers how the British and German soldiers joined together to sing \"Good King Wenceslas,\" \"The Tommies Song,\" \"Annie Laurie,\" and \"Auld Lang Syne\" during the Christmas Day Truce of 1914. Even before the war, the song was popular enough for George M. Cohan, the composer of “Over There,” to quote the melody of the first lines of “Auld Lang Syne” in the second to the last line of the chorus of “You’re a Grand Old Flag” in 1906 for his stage musical “George Washington, Jr.”\n\nGiven its Scottish origins, this song would have appealed to Scottish-American soldiers. In the context of the war, the song would also have given the sense of hope to all the soldiers with its association of ending the war and the beginning of a new life when they return home.\n\nOne doesn't do tantrums and tiaras – Telegraph\".

In 1883, John Philip Sousa remarked that “Annie Laurie\" was one of the most beautiful folk songs. He was inspired to write a march based on it. Unfortunately, Sousa’s piece was soon forgotten.\n\nLike “Auld Lang Syne,” Annie Laurie was an international favorite. Private William Quinton of the British Army recounts the Christmas Truce:\n\nWe could see what looked like very small coloured lights. What was this? Was it some prearranged signal and the forerunner of an attack? We were very suspicious, when something even stranger happened. The Germans were actually singing! Not very loud, but there was no mistaking it. Suddenly, across the snow-clad No Man’s Land, a strong clear voice rang out, singing the opening lines of “Annie Laurie.\" It was sung in perfect English and we were spellbound. To us it seemed that the war had suddenly stopped! Stopped to listen to this song from one of the enemy.\n\nAmerican composers, J. Will Callahan and F. Henri Klickmann released “They All Sang ‘Annie Laurie’ (the song That Reaches Ev’ry Heart)” in 1915.\n\nPaul E. Bierley, The Works of John Philip Sousa (Westerville, Ohio: Integrity Press, 1984), 43.

The lyrics clearly show that the song deals with separation or death. There is a common misinterpretation that this song portrays the unfortunate separation of two lovers. Rather, this song was written as a lament responding to the loss of the Jacobite rebels after the Battle of Culloden. During the Jacobite Uprising of 1745, captured rebels were brought to London to be executed after a show trial. Their heads were set upon pikes and exhibited on a procession back home to Scotland. The procession was on the “high road” while relatives and friends who accompanied the executed to London returned back to Scotland along the “low road,” the ordinary road travelled by commoners. Soldiers serving in the trenches would have easily related to the hope of homecoming this song intends to convey as well as the underlying theme of despairing about death.\n\nLeslie Howard interview https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=4766584\n\nhttp://www.library.ucsb.edu/OBJID/Cylinder0373\n\nScots, wha hae wi’ Wallace bled!\n\nScots, wham Bruce has aften led!\n\nWelcome to your gory bed,\n\nOr to victory!\n\nNow’s the day and now’s the hour,\n\nSee the front of battle hour!\n\nSee approach Edward’s pow’r,\n\nChains and slavery!\n\nWha will be a traitor knave?\n\nWha can fill a coward’s grave?\n\nWha sae base as be a slave?\n\nLet him turn and flee!\n\nWha for Scotland’s king and law,\n\nFreedom’s sword will strongly draw,\n\nFreeman stand, or freeman fa’,\n\nLet him follow me!\n\nBy oppression’s woes and pain!\n\nBy our sons in servile chains!\n\nWe will drain our dearest veins,\n\nBut they shall be free!\n\nLay the proud usurpers low!\n\nTyrants fall in ev’ry foe!\n\nLiberty’s in ev’ry blow!\n\nLet us do, or die!\n\n“Scots Wha Hae” was written by Robert Burns in 1793 based on a speech given by Robert Bruce before the Battle of Bannockburn in 1314 that called the Scots to fight against King Edward II of England.\n\nDuring the war, this song was “seen to be supporting, not necessarily the Scots in the war, but the British war effort,” says Dr. David Goldie, an expert in Robert Burns’ influence on World War I and a senior lecturer at Strathclyde University. Goldie further says “People were able to use the sentiments of the Battle of Bannockburn, a battle in which the Scots had fought the English and actually turn it on its head and used it as a way of suggesting that if people could harness this patriotic spirit for the British cause then all would be well.” Burns’ influence on World War I could also be seen in British recruitment posters from 1915 that often quote his poems. In an effort to consolidate the Allied effort, this song was a rallying cry for the Allies to fight as a single unit, not only for the Scottish soldiers.\n\nFrom the social perspective, Goldie extends Burns’ influence to the civilian population saying, \"Scots Wha Hae\" was both a Scottish patriotic and a patriotic hymn to the working man and the independence of the working man but it could also be seen to represent the independent spirit that Britain was showing against Germany.”\n\nhttps://www.bbc.com/news/uk-scotland-30904019)\n\n1.

The lyrics describes that the love of the speaker for someone will continue despite aging and even after death.\n\nMoore’s first words, “Believe me,” asks the reader for trust and the first four lines set the scene. The lyrics imply that the subject spoken of is very beautiful, but the speaker understands that beauty could “flee” from his arms. He demonstrates the depth of his love as being more substantial than the visible charms of the subject. Words such as “fairy gifts” set the imagery of this song as magical – a love that transcends boundaries, thus having no regard for physical elements that might interfere with the relationship of the speaker and the subject.\n\nThe second set of four lines is a direct response to the first verse and sets up a hypothetical situation that even though “thy loveliness fade as it will,” the speaker’s love centers not on beauty. Line 13 in the second verse seems to be the climax and the comma after “No” as well as the leap of a perfect 5th interval dispels any doubts that the reader may have had in the past. The speaker argues “The heart that has truly loved, never forgets” and reiterates his love for his beloved.\n\nThe lyrics of this song would have meant multiple things to the soldier in the trenches. Away from his family and country, the disgruntled soldier may have viewed the beloved in this song as his love for America despite the political ugliness that tainted the country. Given that the army often had trouble keeping American soldiers away from brothel houses, another possible interpretation could be that this song may have encouraged soldiers to remain faithful to their wives and sweethearts they left back home.\n\nhttp://courses.wcupa.edu/fletcher/britlitweb/smcelroya.htm\n\nhttp://www.loc.gov/jukebox/recordings/detail/id/2599\n\n1.

The tune is widely used as a regimental march in the British Army and Commonwealth. While being associated with Wales, the tune is performed differently throughout the regiments. In the Welsh Guards, the tune is played as a slow march, the Royal Welsh use it as a quick march, and the Royal Canadian Hussars stationed in Montreal, Canada uses it as a regular march.\n\nApparently, the song was popular during World War I. During the Second Christmas Truce in 1915, British Private Robert Keating wrote in his diary:\n\n\"Here we were Welsh and Scots all clustered around the burning brazier which was placed on the outer parapet. The Germans were sending up star lights and singing - they stopped, so we cheered them and we began singing Land of Hope and Glory and Men or Harlech... we stopped and they cheered us. So we went on till the early hours...\"\n\nThe patriotic lyrics clearly call for a consolidated effort to “Fight for father, sister, mother” and that “Each is bound to each as brother.” Simply remembering their history, the Welsh would have easily remembered their resistance to the Normans and their defiance at Harlech. These events are similar to the plight of Belgium – the reason Britain entered the war. Belgium, a small country like Wales, is now defenseless against the aggression from its powerful, bullying neighbor, Germany. Recalling their fight for independence from Great Britain, Americans would have seen themselves similarly in this situation and have sympathy for the Belgian cause.\n\nThe Annotated Army Song Book Part 4\n\nFlag of honor, flag of daring,\n\nFlag of legions onward faring,\n\nFlag our hands and hearts are bearing,\n\nLead to victory!\n\nFrom the dyes of battle glory,\n\nFoam and wave of ocean’s glory\n\nAnd the stars that tell thy story\n\nFreemen fashioned thee.\n\nFlag of love unbounded!\n\nFlag of hopes unsounded!\n\nHow float thy bars, how gleam thy stars,\n\nBy Heavens stars surrounded!\n\nWe thy sons shall fail thee never!\n\nTime nor tide our faith shall sever!\n\nAll for thee, and thousand forever,\n\nFlag of victory!\n\nBy the standards that have shown thee,\n\nBy the battles that have known thee,\n\nBy the heroes that have flown thee,\n\nGuide us in the fight!\n\nBless the soldier in his sleeping;\n\nHush the mother in her weeping;\n\nHold the helpless in thy keeping,\n\nWarder of the Right!\n\nBy the guns that scarred thee,\n\nBy the guns that guard thee,\n\nThine eagles soar\n\nFrom war to war,\n\nBut never stain has marred thee!\n\nWe thy sons shall fail thee never!\n\nTime nor tide our faith shall sever!\n\nAll for thee, and thou forever,\n\nFlag of victory!\n\nUsing the same melody of “Men of Harlech,” George Sterling dedicated this song to the 81st Field Artillery Regiment of the U.S. Army in 1917. The recently organized artillery group was originally from the 23rd Cavalry from Chickamauga and later served in Brittany, France during World War I.\n\nSterling, a poet from California, wrote the lyrics at the suggestion of Captain Davies. A newsletter from The Cambrian in 1918 states that this song “won the first prize for the Eighty-first Regiment” although it is not clear what kind of competition the author was referring to. Further, the newsletter suggests that this song be “sung in every Welsh home, church, or society.”\n\nThis song may be an example of an effort to create a unified Allied force by adopting a well-known Welsh tune. Changing the lyrics makes American soldiers easily relate to its meaning. With the indication to sing it con fuoco (with fire), marching to this song is unavoidable.\n\nThe Cambrian.

The lyrics are changed to fit the war effort. The absence of the music score may indicate that there was no need to include it because of its overwhelming popularity.\n\nThe melody was originally written as an instrumental work by Louis Ganne, a French composer. Rising to prominence before and during the war, the song was recorded by Conway’s Band in 1917 led by Patrick Conway. This band was also known as The Ithaca Band that specialized in patriotic songs, similar to John Philip Sousa’s band. The melody was a staple in the repertory of wind and brass bands that was used to begin an event. Later, this song was transcribed into braille music during the war.\n\nWith the words “On the Way to France,” this song created an inherent connection between American and French troops. The lyrics express strong “Yankee” support for France.\n\nhttps://blogs.loc.gov/nls-music-notes/2017/03/ganne-alford-holst-and-others-music-of-world-war-i/\n\nhttp://www.library.ucsb.edu/OBJID/Cylinder4137\n\nOver there, over there,\n\nSend the word, send the word over there,\n\nThat the Yanks are coming, the Yanks are coming,\n\nThe drums rumtumming ev'ry where.\n\nSo prepare, say a pray'r.\n\nSend the word, send the word to beware,\n\nWe'll be over, we're coming over,\n\nAnd we won't come back\n\nTill it's over over there!\n\nArguably the most popular song during World War I, George M. Cohan’s “Over There” was written on April 6, 1917 as a response to the United States’ declaration of war on Germany. It was designed to call young American men to enlist in the army and fight the “Hun.” The song was heavily reprinted that by the fall of 1917, two million copies of sheet music had been sold. It appeared in many different covers. Given its popularity, the song helped shift public opinion to pro-war and galvanized the public into action to help the war effort. Prior to this, the U.S. maintained a neutral stance.\n\nCohan's daughter Mary tells how her father composed this song. She remembers how her father proclaimed to his family that he just finished a new song. Wearing a kitchen pan on his head, Cohan began to mark time and marched with a broom in hand for a gun. She further relates, \"We kids had heard, of course, that the United States was at war, and how here was Dad acting just like a soldier. So I began to sob, and I threw myself down, hanging for dear life to his legs as he marched, begging him, pleading with him not to go away to the war. I kept clinging to him until he stopped.\"\n\n“Over there” can be considered as one of the greatest wartime propaganda songs. It was made famous by the singer Nora Bayes and was recorded several times by Enrico Caruso. Further, Louis Delamarre wrote a French translation of the song alongside the English original that appealed to both American and French audiences. However, by 1918, Americans would realize that “Over there” was an artifact, written during a more innocent and naïve time. The levels of bloodshed and cruel devastation by the war operated by machines had reached unimaginable levels. By the time the war ended in 1918, more than a hundred thousand Americans had lost their lives. In 1940, President Franklin D. Roosevelt awarded Cohan the Medal of Honor for his contribution to the war effort in World War I. Cohan’s clever response was “Funny about them giving me a medal. All I wrote was a bugle call” as he referred to the melody of the refrain mimicking a military bugle call.\n\nPegler, Martin (2014). Soldier's Songs and Slang of the Great War.

Migrating to Boston from Ireland in 1848, Gilmore showed his admiration for America by composing patriotic songs and was dubbed \"Father of the American Band.\" He was often compared to John Philip Sousa. Gilmore was made Grand Master of the Union Army in 1863, the same year he composed this song. Besides leading the band and composing songs, Gilmore was also ordered to reorganize the state military bands. His band was attached to the 24th Massachusetts Infantry.\n\nAlthough Gilmore claimed that he adapted the song from an African-American spiritual, the melody of the song is very similar to the Irish song “Johnny, I Hardly Knew Ye” which was considered a protest song against Irish conscription into the British Army. The song has sentimental lyrics:\n\nWhere are your legs that used to run, huroo, huroo,\n\nWhere are your legs that used to run, huroo, huroo,\n\nWhere are your legs that used to run when first you went for to carry a gun?\n\nAlas, your dancing days are done, och, Johnny, I hardly knew ye.\n\nInterestingly, there are no negative references in Gilmore’s version and the song is only used as a motivation song "
