Even before the war was over, scholars in the North and South began to analyze and interpret the reasons behind the bloodshed.\n\nThe scholars immediately disagreed over the causes of the war and disagreement persists today. Many maintain that the primary cause of the war was the Southern states’ desire to preserve the institution of slavery. Others minimize slavery and point to other factors, such as taxation or the principle of States' Rights.\n\nIn 2011, at the outset of the sesquicentennial, a Pew Research Center poll found that Americans were significantly divided on the issue, with 48% saying the war was \"mainly about states' rights,\" 38% saying the war was \"mainly about slavery,\" with the remainder answering \"both equally\" or \"neither/don't know.\"\n\nOne method by which to analyze this historical conflict is to focus on primary sources. Every state in the Confederacy issued an “Article of Secession” declaring their break from the Union. Four states went further. Texas, Mississippi, Georgia and South Carolina all issued additional documents, usually referred to as the “Declarations of Causes,\" which explain their decision to leave the Union.\n\nTwo major themes emerge in these documents: slavery and states' rights. All four states strongly defend slavery while making varying claims related to states' rights. Other grievances, such as economic exploitation and the role of the military, receive limited attention in some of the documents. This article will present, in detail, everything that was said in the Declarations of Causes pertaining to these topics.\n\nSlavery\n\n1) Each declaration makes the defense of slavery a clear objective.\n\nRead More\n\n2) Some states argue that slavery should be expanded.\n\nRead More\n\n3) Abolitionism is attacked as a method of inciting violent uprisings.\n\nRead More\n\n4) Mississippi and Georgia point out that slavery accounts for a huge portion of the Southern economy.\n\nRead More\n\nStates' Rights\n\n1) The states argue that the Union is a compact, one that can be annulled if the states are not satisfied with what they receive in return from other states and/or from the federal government.\n\nRead More\n\n2) The states argue that the North's reluctance to enforce the Fugitive Slave Act of 1850 (mandating that fugitive slaves be returned to the South) means that the compact is no longer satisfactory.\n\nRead More\n\nOther Grievances\n\n1) All of the states negatively mention Abraham Lincoln's election and his suspected abolitionist leanings.\n\nRead More\n\n2) Georgia accuses Northern manufacturing interests of exploiting the South and dominating the federal government.\n\nRead More\n\n3) Texas expresses dissatisfaction with federal military protection."
