        "text": "In advancing the kingdom of God we are to influence the earth for Christ. The Church must be a positive agent of change and transformation in the community. We are a Governmental Church – The saints must rise and taking their place in the society as God’s agent.\n\nThere is what is known today as the Seven (7) Mountains of Influence, and the nations of the earth is changed and transformed through these Seven (7) Mountains.\n\n1. Family\n\n2. Religion – (Spirituality)\n\n3. Business – (Economy, Finance)\n\n4. Politics – (Government)\n\n5. Education\n\n6. Media – (Communication)\n\n7. Arts – (Entertainment, Celebration, Sports)\n\nThese Seven (7) Mountains of Influence are considered to be cultures that mold the way we think and influences our lives on a daily basis, and if we are to make any significant impact and change in the community as a Church, then we must engage these Seven (7) Mountains of societal spheres, and influence them for Christ and His kingdom, by so doing we can bring change and transformation to a nation.\n\n“Tell him this is what the LORD Almighty says: ‘Here is the man whose name is the Branch, and he will branch out from his place and build the temple of the LORD. It is he who will build the temple of the LORD, and he will be clothed with majesty and will sit and rule on his throne. And he will be a priest on his throne. And there will be harmony between the two” – (Zachariah 6:12-13 NIV).\n\n“You let them become kings and serve God as priests, and they will rule on earth” – (Revelation 5:10 CEV).\n\nThe priesthood is your ministry to God, and His people, but the kingship is the administration of God’s government and authority in you, and through you in the market-place and in these mountains. There has to be a balance and co-existence of harmony between both offices/ministries in order to build the house of God. We must assume our role as priests, and take our place on the throne as kings to rule. The priest will seat on the throne as king – (We are priests in the ministry, and kings in the market-places.\n\nFrom a spiritual point of view, mountain(s) are considered to be government, authority, rulership, principalities, dominion and a place, or position of influence.\n\nThe strategy for the Church to be able to influence these spheres (7 Mountains) and bring transformation to our society is through the marketplace (workplace), because 90% of our time is spent in these spheres, and if we can build and equip the saints to take their positions in the society, and see their workplace as part of their God given assignment, then the Church can begin to positively influence these spheres and occupy places as the principles of the kingdom is being released.\n\nThis is not something that can be done by one person or one local fellowship in a twinkling of an eye. It will take a process of time, but it requires revelation and understanding for the involvement of a corporate people with a kingdom mindset to engage these Seven (7) spheres.\n\n(1). Family .\n\nIt is a fundamental group typically consisting of two parents (father and mother) or more people (children inclusive) who are the vital organs sharing the same goals and values and having long-term commitments to one another and usually residing in the same dwelling place. This is an inclusive concept of masculine and feminine – father, mother, sons and daughters.\n\nThe family is the first institution established by God through the covenant of marriage. One of His aims was that the family grows to become a peculiar tribe of people who are separated to be His treasured possession.\n\n“We are a people holy to the LORD your God. The LORD your God has chosen you to be a people for his treasured possession, out of all the peoples who are on the face of the earth. It was not because you were more in number than any other people that the LORD set his love on you and chose you, for you were the fewest of all peoples, but it is because the LORD loves you….” – (Deuteronomy 7:6 -8 ESV).\n\nThe order of God’s dealing with creation, and the administration of His purposes in the earth is first with an individual through whom He establishes a family, and that family becomes the corporate body that He uses to impact the nations – the earth realm, to establish His purpose. This is clearly seen in the promise to the patriarch Abraham as it relates to his family and the nations.\n\n“Now the LORD had said unto Abram, ……..I will make of thee a great nation, and I will bless thee, and make thy name great; and thou shalt be a blessing…..and in thee shall all families of the earth be blessed” – (Genesis 12:1-3).\n\n“The LORD said to Himself, “I should tell Abraham what I am going to do, since his family will become a great and powerful nation that will be a blessing to all other nations on earth.” – (Genesis 18:17-18 CEV).\n\nThe promise of God to Abraham was so weighty, yet his greatness and the fulfillment was not in himself, but in his seed (Son), to whom the promise was given, and who becomes the instrument of releasing God’s fullness and blessings upon the earth.\n\n“Behold, I will send you Elijah the prophet before the coming of the great and dreadful day of the LORD. And he shall turn the heart of the fathers to the children, and the heart of the children to their fathers, lest I come and smite the earth with a curse” – (Malachi 4:5-6).\n\nFamily is of important interest to God. His aim is to restore families, and this will break the curse of fatherlessness that is upon the nations.\n\nThe devil knows this that is why there has been an intensive attack against the original institution of marriage (Man and woman), and against the family at large. Divorce, gay, lesbianism and all forms of family abuse are all strategies of the enemy to destroy the family.\n\nThe Church must have a clear understanding of this and become involved in the restoration of the values of godly families, so we can empower the saints through an exemplary lifestyle and raising strong families that will boldly influence this mountain of family. Let us model Christ in the family.\n\nOur influence in the society is greatly dependent on the influence of the family values that is instilled in us. When men rises to become true fathers, and women rises to become true mothers to protect and establish godly values it will cause us to measure up to something.\n\n(2). Religion – (Spirituality):\n\nIt has been defined as a collection of cultural systems, beliefs, and world views that establishes symbols that relate humanity to spirituality and, sometimes to moral values.\n\nReligion has often been said to be man’s way in attempt to reach God, which is rooted in external works (human efforts). The Church is not a religion rooted in external works, but it is a relationship based on faith, which is an internal attitude (Christ works). It is God’s way reaching out to mankind through relationship with Jesus Christ. What really matters is for people to be in right relationship with God, and to let this be the primary purpose of their lives.\n\n“Faithful is the God by whom you were called into fellowship with His Son Jesus the Messiah, our Lord” – (1Corinthians 1:9 CEV).\n\n“For it pleased the Father that in Him (Jesus) should all fulness dwell; And, having made peace through the blood of His cross, by Him (Jesus) to reconcile all things unto Himself; by Him (Jesus), I say,whether they be things in earth, or things in heaven. And you, that were sometime alienated and enemies in your mind by wicked works, yet now hath He reconciled” – (Colossians 1:19-21).\n\nThe word “Christian” has never been the original intent of the name given by God to the early disciples and the apostles of Jesus Christ to define who they were in their relationship with Him. The name “Christian” was first given to them by the Gentiles and religious sets who were in Antioch, an ancient Greek city.\n\n“…..And the disciples were called Christians first in Antioch” – (Acts 11:26).\n\nThe early disciples and apostles of Jesus Christ were originally known as people of the way (Followers of the Way of Christ) – John 14:6, Acts 9:2; Acts 19:8-9, 23; Acts 22:4; Acts 24:22.\n\nIn the sight of God, our Father, we are known and called ‘sons of God’.\n\n“But as many as did receive Him (Jesus) to them He gave authority to become sons of God—to those believing in His name (Jesus)” – (John 1:12 YLT).\n\n“For as many as are led by the Spirit of God, they are the sons of God” – (Romans 8:14).\n\n“But when the fulness of the time was come, God sent forth His Son, made of a woman, made under the law, To redeem them that were under the law, that we might receive the adoption of sons. And because ye are sons, God hath sent forth the Spirit of His Son into your hearts, crying, Abba, Father. Wherefore thou art no more a servant, but a son; and if a son, then an heir of God through Christ” – (Galatians 4:4-7).\n\n“Behold, what manner of love the Father hath bestowed upon us, that we should be called the sons of God: therefore the world knoweth us not, because it knew Him not. Beloved, now are we the sons of God, and it doth not yet appear what we shall be: but we know that, when He (Jesus) shall appear, we shall be like Him (Jesus); for we shall see Him (Jesus) as He (Jesus) is” – (1 John 3:1-2).\n\nThe world has called us Christians and defined us as a religion based on their belief system that is rooted in humanism. They have no knowledge of Christ, hence they don’t know us.\n\nChristianity (if i may use this word for the sake of this book) is considered to be a religion based on the world’s perspective; but in its purest form, our spirituality is NOT a religion. If there be any form of religion (human effort) that is to be reckoned with our spirituality which is undefiled to God and the Father, it is, “to visit the fatherless and widows in their affliction, and to keep oneself unspotted from the world” – James 1:27.\n\nIn modern era, religion has become a mountain that governs many aspect of human existence, and it has been implicated in all sorts of conflict and violence globally. We cannot deny the fact that we have not been affected by the effects of religion, either positively or negatively. There is a present awakening of religion among the nations considering the violent activities of terrorism and human barbarism that is done in the name of religion.\n\nOur spirituality must influence this mountain of religion to shape the mindset of humanity through a righteous judgment of peace, because we are a mountain called by God to be a spiritual government over all the mountains.\n\nZion is a mountain. Zion is God’s dwelling place. We (the Church) are the dwelling place of God. We are His tabernacle. We are Zion. We are a mountain!\n\n“His abode has been established in Salem, His dwelling place in Zion” – (Psalm 76:2 ESV).\n\n“For the LORD hath chosen Zion; He hath desired it for His habitation. This is my rest for ever: here will I dwell; for I have desired it” – (Psalm 132:113-14).\n\n“The LORD said unto my Lord, Sit thou at my right hand, until I make thine enemies thy footstool. The LORD shall send the rod of thy strength out of Zion: rule thou in the midst of thine enemies” – (Psalm 110:1-2).\n\nZion is the governmental seat of God. A place of rulership. Zion is God’s habitation (God’s House – His Church) that is established on the mountain above the hills where His laws shall proceed from to rule the nations.\n\n“So shall ye know that I am the LORD your God dwelling in Zion, my holy mountain: then shall Jerusalem be holy, and there shall no strangers pass through her any more. And it shall come to pass in that day, that the mountains shall drop down new wine, and the hills shall flow with milk, and all the rivers of Judah shall flow with waters, and a fountain shall come forth of the house of the LORD, and shall water the valley of Shittim” – (Joel 3:17-18).\n\n“But in the last days it shall come to pass, that the mountain of the house of the LORD shall be established in the top of the mountains, and it shall be exalted above the hills; and people shall flow unto it. And many nations shall come, and say, Come, and let us go up to the mountain of the LORD, and to the house of the God of Jacob; and he will teach us of his ways, and we will walk in his paths: for the law shall go forth of Zion, and the word of the LORD from Jerusalem” – (Micah 4:1-2).\n\n“For this Agar is mount Sinai in Arabia, and answereth to Jerusalem which now is, and is in bondage with her children. But Jerusalem which is above is free, which is the mother of us all” – (Galatians 4:25-26).\n\nIn consideration of the above scriptures in reference to Jerusalem, It is important to note that Galatians Chapter 4 makes it clear that there are two (2) Jerusalem’s. The first one is referred to as the physical Jerusalem in the Middle East which now is, and is in bondage with her children.\n\nWe are not of the first Jerusalem. We are of the second Jerusalem which is above and free, which is the mother of us all. This second Jerusalem is the holy city, the great city of God, the new heavenly Jerusalem.\n\n“But ye are come unto mount Sion, and unto the city of the living God, the heavenly Jerusalem, and to an innumerable company of angels, To the general assembly and church of the firstborn, which are written in heaven, and to God the Judge of all, and to the spirits of just men made perfect” – (Hebrews 12:22-23).\n\n“Him that overcometh will I make a pillar in the temple of my God, and he shall go no more out: and I will write upon him the name of my God, and the name of the city of my God, which is new Jerusalem, which cometh down out of heaven from my God: and I will write upon him my new name” – (Revelation 3:12).\n\n“And I John saw the holy city, new Jerusalem, coming down from God out of heaven, prepared as a bride adorned for her husband….And there came unto me one of the seven angels which had the seven vials full of the seven last plagues, and talked with me, saying, Come hither, I will shew thee the bride, the Lamb’s wife. And he carried me away in the spirit to a great and high mountain, and shewed me that great city, the holy Jerusalem, descending out of heaven from God” – (Revelation 21:2, 9-10).\n\nInterestingly, the angel of the Lord said to John, come let me show you the bride, the Lamb’s wife. You would expect that the angel will show John a woman, because the bride must be a person, but rather the angel carried John away in the spirit to a great and high mountain, and showed Him a place, that great city, the holy Jerusalem, descending out of heaven from God.\n\nThe bride, the Lamb’s wife is NOT a place, but a person; and here this person is defined with the characteristics as that great city, the holy Jerusalem, descending out of heaven from God. This in itself changes the whole perception from a place to a person – (a corporate people in Christ that is the Body of Christ).\n\nThe Church is the bride, the Lamb’s wife. The Body of Christ/Bride are those who have confessed and received Jesus Christ as their Lord and personal savior, and have received eternal life. Christ, the Bridegroom, has chosen the Body of Christ (the Church) to be His bride as He did this sacrificially and lovingly – (Ephesians 5:25-27, 2 Corinthians 11:2).\n\nLet us be an example and a true expression of the Body of Christ as we build accurately and influence this mountain of religion, as it has been prophetically spoken that we will be the mountain on top of all mountains.\n\n(3). Business – (Economy, Finance).\n\nOne of the challenge we have encountered as a Body has been the ignorance that prevails within the Church regarding ‘kingdom economics’. The global elite govern the world with the strategy of controlling every financial institutions and enslaving us to debts through our mortgage, bonds, loans etc. Their goal is also to enslave governments as they finance political campaigns and seek to control the government and thereby enslaving a whole nation.\n\nWe have a heavenly system that is not of this world, which gives us unreserved access into the supernatural economy of God that prevails above all other economy and systems, and it allows us to live in peace and prosperity. The challenge here is that we don’t know how to access the economy of God, or we are not accessing it to the fullness of God’s potential for us. This has resulted to a beggarly mentality that continues to enslave the Church and rob us of our destiny and the actualization of our assignment on earth.\n\n“….. For the children of this world are in their generation wiser than the children of light” – (Luke 16:8).\n\nThe parable of the dishonest manager was the fact that he knew how to manipulate his system to profit his own interest against the day of his adversity, and his lord commended him – Luke 16:1-12.\n\nThe problem with the Church is that we are not raising faithful stewards, hence the true riches is not entrusted to us. We are found wanting! The children of this world are said to be wiser than the children of light, because they know that we have a system from above which is in a higher order that supersedes theirs, but we have left this higher order and seek to operate with their worldly system which is of no profit to our assignment. We cannot apply the system of this world and expect a supernatural result.\n\nOver the years there have been prophetic declarations of Isaiah 60:1-7, about the transfer of wealth, and the camels which are coming with kings riding upon it with treasures of the earth. As much as this is true, but the reality is that the mountains of business, finance, economy etc will not be influenced by the Church if we only prophesy, pray and then seat down. There has to be a strategic development of the Joseph’s technology and mindset to train, equip and empower the saints with this grace to engage this mountain of business (Finance, Economy). A whole new generation of kingdom leaders and saints must be raised up in the market-place and the economic world that will strategically develop godly principles to influence and occupy this mountain.\n\nJoseph the Jewish lad who was sold as a slave by his brothers was made the governor over the land of Egypt – Genesis 42:6. He controlled the economy of Egypt in the midst of famine and opened the storehouses to the nations, preserved the heritage of God’s people and brought unity among his brothers. In the midst of challenges, he went through the process of development to make his dream become a reality. From his lowest position in the pit and in prison he rose to occupy a seat in the King’s palace in a foreign land. He gained favour with God and with those in authority.\n\n“And they went up out of Egypt, and came into the land of Canaan unto Jacob their father, And told him, saying, Joseph is yet alive, and he is governor over all the land of Egypt. And Jacob’s heart fainted, for he believed them not. And they told him all the words of Joseph, which he had said unto them: and when he saw the wagons which Joseph had sent to carry him, the spirit of Jacob their father revived: And Israel said, It is enough; Joseph my son is yet alive: I will go and see him before I die” – (Genesis 45:25-28).\n\nThis question stands before us today; where are the Josephs of our day who will administrate and be in command of the economy?\n\nThis must be a corporate effort of the body, and not just an individual. The Church must learn to work together in unity, and as a team to achieve this goal of ruling in the economic mountain.\n\n“The LORD shall command the blessing upon thee in thy storehouses, and in all that thou settest thine hand unto; and He shall bless thee in the land which the LORD thy God giveth thee” – (Deuteronomy 28:8).\n\nIt is time to set our hand in business, and the Lord shall bless us in the land to rule on this mountain.\n\n(4). Politics – (Government).\n\nThe truth remains that the Church must change her perspective regarding politics and government, or we will become irrelevant in today’s world.\n\n“When the [uncompromisingly] righteous are in authority, the people rejoice; but when the wicked man rules, the people groan and sigh” – (Proverbs 29:2 Amplified Bible).\n\n“Then God blessed them and said, “Be fruitful and multiply. Fill the earth and govern it. Reign over the fish in the sea, the birds in the sky, and all the animals that scurry along the ground” – (Genesis 1:28).\n\nGod’s purpose for our dominion mandate was not to rule over humans, but over the creation order. We were authorized by God to maintain order in the earth. The desire to rule over other people is from man’s fallen nature, and this continues to be the driving force behind our present day government as the people are being controlled and exploited for personal gains.\n\nThe fundamental purpose of government is suppose to be the maintenance of basic order, and to provide a system in which every individual have the liberty to access basic human rights with equality with regards to God’s will and principles. When this is uncompromised in government, then the people will rejoice.\n\nThe question is, how can the righteous be in authority when they are not involved in politics or government?\n\nIf we cannot train and position the saints in places of influence and governmental authorities then the wicked will continue to rule, and we will be subject to the ridicules of the enemy and unlawful decisions that will be established, even to the detriment of our faith. This is without doubt, as we can see among the nations instituting and legalizing homosexual rights, and how the Church is being forced to compromise their belief in God’s word against this abominable act.\n\nWhen Haman stood as an enemy against the Jews and plotted to destroy them, nothing would have been able to avert the destruction that was coming, if Queen Esther had not stood in the King’s inner court to mediate for salvation – Esther 4:10-17. She desecrated the laws of the King’s palace and stepped into the inner court to meet with the King declaring “…if I perish, I perish”. The only reason Esther stood in this position was because she was prepared by Mordecai to take it, even though she was a Jew and it was not her right to do so. Mordecai recognized that she was prepared in her royal position for such a time as this.\n\nThis question stands before us today; have we as a Church prepared our Esther’s who will stand in their place of governmental authorities for times such as this?\n\n(5). Education.\n\nThe importance of education and the role it plays in the development of the human character, and the influence it has on our world cannot be overemphasize, because this is the premise that forms the very essence of all our actions. What we do and become is what we know and have learned. Education is a self-enlightening process. It leads to enlightenment, either spiritually or physically.\n\n“The direction in which education starts a man will determine his future in life” – plato.\n\nAnother important aspect of education is that it is very crucial to the whole development of man, and it helps to shape and build our character.\n\n“The function of education is to teach one to think intensively and to think critically. Intelligence plus character – that is the goal of true education” – Martin Luther King, Jr.\n\n“Education is the most powerful weapon we can use to change the world” – Nelson Mandela.\n\nEducation provides us with knowledge about our world. It lays the foundation for a stronger nation, because education is the brain of a nation.\n\nThe day a man stops to learn is the day he starts to die. Education is life, but the question is, what are we being educated in?\n\nDrug abuse, gangsters, prostitution, crime, unemployment and most barbaric actions are tied to lack of proper godly education which has shaped the mindset of our generation.\n\n“Education is simply the soul of a society as it passes from one generation to another” – G. K. Chesterton.\n\nWe cannot deny the fact that education shapes the mind of many generations as it influences their behavior and what they become.\n\nThis therefore makes the mountain of education an important sphere that we must influence to be able to dominate and rule. It begins from the basis – the family!\n\n(6). Media – (Communication).\n\nThe Media is the main means of mass communication that reaches a large audience, whether written, broadcast or spoken – (television, radio, newspapers, magazines, internet, movies and advertisements and so forth). It is a significant force that has the capacity to create the cultures that always influences and defines the character of a people geographically. The media is a stronghold that influences and controls the minds of people.\n\nThe works of darkness, illuminati, baphomet, wickedness, idolatry, heresies, sexual immoralities and abominable acts, such as gay marriages, lesbianism and witchcraft is being widely promoted and accepted as a culture, and even praised and glamorized on movies, television, social medias and so forth.\n\n“Wherein in time past ye walked according to the course of this world, according to the prince of the power of the air, the spirit that now worketh in the children of disobedience” – (Ephesians 2:2).\n\nMedia is air-(waves) and it is a spirit. Air is symbolic of the spirit. Satan is known as the prince of the power of the air (media), the spirit that controls people to make them walk in disobedience. Satan is a ruler and authority of the air – airwaves.\n\nThe media continues to be the platform to promote the dark side of the kingdom of darkness and to keep people captive to the course of this world.\n\n“While the women went on their way, some of the soldiers guarding the tomb went back to the city and told the chief priests everything that had happened. The chief priests met with the elders and made their plan; they gave a large sum of money to the soldiers and said, “You are to say that his disciples came during the night and stole his body while you were asleep. And if the Governor should hear of this, we will convince him that you are innocent, and you will have nothing to worry about.” The guards took the money and did what they were told to do. And so that is the report spread around by the Jews to this very day” – (Matthew 28:11-15 GNT).\n\nThe chief priests and the religious sects took counsel and gave a large sum of money as bribe to the soldiers, which is sufficient to propagate a false report until this day, to deny the truth about Jesus Christ our Lord and Savior who rose from the dead on the third day, and He is alive.\n\nBillions of dollars is invested in media to control the air-waves to propagate lies and false reports, because anything that can be on the media will be accepted by the people and be sold to them.\n\nDoes this matter to us as a Church that this mountain of media and communication is also available to us in many ways, and we can influence this mountain of media through a large sum of money if we invest to propagate the gospel of the kingdom of God through the right channels.\n\nWhy do we waste our energy and time fighting against one another on the media and give ourselves to foolishness, when we can utilize that platform and channel our energy for Christ and His kingdom!\n\n(7). Arts – (Entertainment, Celebration, Music, Sports etc).\n\nTo many, Arts – Entertainment, Sports, Music etc has become an idol that has captivated many hearts, and it does influences their behavior and attitude towards one another.\n\nYouths, and adults alike are influenced by the music industry. It plays into the soul, and it can open people to a certain dimension and realm of influence and control in their spirit.\n\nI believe as a Church we need to explore this mountain and be creative to release a pure Spirit.\n\nIf there is anything that is needed to fulfill this mandate, it is GRACE. It will take the grace of God for a people to walk in this place and position, and to finish this work and make a significant impact for the Lord and His kingdom.\n\nThe Spirit of grace is being poured out upon the Church. Great grace is given to enable us as we labour in the market-place. There is no limit to what the grace of God will do as He makes the impossible to become possible.\n\n“Who are you, O great mountain, before Zerubbabel you shall become a plain! And he shall bring forth the capstone with shouts of “Grace, grace to it!” – (Zachariah 4:7).\n\nThe capstone is a ministry with a finishing mentality. There is a capstone ministry that is a finishing anointing that operates with the grace of God to overcome and finish God’s purpose. This capstone – finishing ministry will shout Grace, Grace to it.\n\nWhen we shift focus from only revelation knowledge acquisition to implementation of revelation knowledge then we can begin to see a transformation in these mountains, and raise creative and empowered dominion citizens who are ruling and influencing their world for Christ.\n\nGod has given us a governmental authority. Let us therefore take our place and position. Let’s be His government upon these mountains by His grace, and let His kingdom come and let His will be done on earth as it is in heaven."
