        "text": "14th New York Infantry Regiment's Civil War Newspaper Clippings\n\nFIRST IN THE FIELD.—The Citizens' Corps, (minus the few who are out of town taking leave of friends,) mustered at their Armory last night, were inspected by Brigadier-General White, the oath of allegiance administered, and the Company mustered into service for two years, if not sooner discharged. (April 23, 1861)\n\nAfter this ceremony the numerous spectators were dismissed and the Company proceeded to the election of officers—it being necessary that the names of those elected Captain, 1st Lieutenant, and Ensign, should be forwarded with the muster-roll to Headquarters. The following were elected—the Captain unanimously, and the remainder nearly so:\n\nCaptain—James McQuade.\n\n1st Lieutenant—Thomas M. Davies.\n\nEnsign—R. D. Crocker.\n\n1st Sergeant—John F. McQuade; George W. Cone; 3d, D. J. B. Marchisi; 4th, J. A. Curry.\n\n1st Corporal, H. P. Perry; 2d, S. Stocking;\n\n3d, J. H. Douglas; 4th, James Miller.\n\nThe names of the commissioned officers, with the muster-roll, were forwarded, and the commissions and marching orders are expected to-day.\n\nThe boys are all in fine spirits, proud of their officers, proud of themselves, and their only anxiety is to see that the reputation of the Corps shall stand as high in actual service as in the annals of parade days and musters.\n\n—The Seymour Artillery Volunteers, of whom thirty-seven were yesterday enrolled, have chosen for Captain, LEWIS MICHAEL; for First Lieutenant, ALFRED SEARS; Ensign, EDWARD WARR. They will parade this morning at 10 o'clock in Zouave uniform. They propose to unite with the Corps in the same regiment.\n\nVolunteers.—There are now six companies who take their meals at the City Hall. All persons who desire to furnish provisions will leave their orders with Commissary W. W. LONG at the City Hall, and not at Headquarters as here before. A large amount is needed for to-day; and probably for two or three days longer.\n\n—Capt. H. R. LAHE, of Lowville, was in town yesterday morning on his way to Albany, with a full roll of seventy-seven Lewis County boys, to offer their services in the Volunteer Militia of this State. He is making an effort to get into the Corps Regiment.\n\n—Co. E of the Corps Regiment yesterday elected the following officers:\n\nCaptain, M. McQuade, Jr.; Lieutenant, R. J. Cantwell; Ensign, Cassarinus B. Mervine; 1st Sergeant, D. W. Manning; 2d do. Patrick Sweetman; 3d do. Thos. Gray; 4th do. Geo. Higham; 1st Corporal, J. C. Eames; 2d do.\n\nGeo. W. Lewis; 3d do. A. W. Clark; 4th do. Chas. Bradley.\n\nThirty-eight men of this Company, will leave for Albany at 10 o'clock to-day.\n\n—A company from Norwich of seventy-five men, Capt. TYRRELL, to join the Corps Regiment, will arrive here this afternoon. They tarried at Hamilton last night. The Home Guard are expected to turn out as an escort, and to meet at the armory at the signal of three guns. It is expected the Old Band will furnish the music.\n\nVOLUNTEERS.—Another Company for the Corps Regiment has been formed at Syracuse. Geo. WHITE went up Thursday and mustered them into service, and they elected SAMUEL L. Thompson Captain; HENRY GOSS Lieutenant, and GEORGE G. MORGAN Ensign. The Syracuse Courier announced that they were to go to Albany yesterday afternoon, but they didn't do it.\n\n—Capt. M. McQuade, Jr., is again receiving recruits at the Utica Citizens' Corps Armory.\n\nThe Corps Volunteers at Albany.\n\nTo the Editor of the Utica Morning Herald:—\n\nHEADQUARTERS, April 29th.\n\nSince my last letter considerable excitement has been created in our midst, partly on account of the food which was given us, and on account of a row which occurred at the Adams House this afternoon. In regard to the provisions, the feeling among our companies from Utica had become quite strong, and Sunday evening it reached a culminating point. A squad composed mainly of Companies A and B, marched from our quarters to the Adams House, where the meals are provided, all resolved in their minds that if there was no improvement in the food, they would earnestly protest against any more of the same sort. All quietly sat down, but the supper was extremely unsatisfactory, and every man rose to his feet and marched out. It was a fortunate thing for Mr. Roessle, that our boys are advocates of law and order, and that it was Sunday evening, else he would have had a large lot of disabled crockery on hand; but the men held their tempers with commendable firmness, and only broke one plate and spilled a few cups of coffee. After matters had quieted down somewhat, Messrs. Roessle, Quarter Master Van Vechten, the steward, waiters, Albanians, etc., Capt. McQuade, and a number of the Corps and Continentals, went back into the dining room and held an earnest consultation together. Several speeches were delivered, addressed chiefly to Mr. Roessle, and their purport was that if he did not cease speculating on us Volunteers, sudden and decided action would be taken in the matter. Mr. Roessle said something in reply, but it was not extremely satisfactory, and the protestations were continued until Mr. Van Vechten assured us that we should hereafter fare better. To bind the bargain a dozen or so from Utica, sat down and had a good meal after the new style.\n\nThis morning the breakfast was miserable again, although better than it had been. All marched out again and paid for their meals at saloons and hotels. As a visible improvement had been made, all expected a very good dinner to-day; but while getting ready to march from our quarters to dinner, Capt. McQuade entered and informed the company that we would not go to dinner, as one of the companies quartered at the lower barracks had mutinied, broken everything in the dining room, pitched one of the waiters out of the window, breaking his leg, and severely bruised several more of the waiters. As trouble was expected, Capt. M. detailed a squad of thirty men, half from the Continentals, and marched them to the lower quarters on Broadway. Capt. McQuade was then given command of the lower quarters, consisting of the Adams' House, and several other large rooms adjoining in the same block, and mounted guard at the different entrances.\n\nThe company which had the row was one which arrived here Sunday morning from Owego, Tioga county, consisting of 77 men, with the President of the village, Capt. Catlin in command. They are a good company. They went down to dinner this noon, and in the course of the meal a difficulty occurred between one of the negro waiters and Capt. Catlin, the latter not receiving all the courtesy due him. The result was that Capt. C. knocked the waiter down, and his men resented the insult by \"cleaning out\" the whole establishment. They had become a good deal dissatisfied with the rations, and it took but a word to raise their blood, although the dinner provided to-day was very good indeed, consisting of baked beans and pork, potatoes, beef, soup, bread and seasoning. But they were excited by the insult given to their Captain, and they literally smashed everything. Scarcely a whole dish was left from a full set for about two hundred men. The tables were ripped up and overturned, windows broken, and everything turned up-side down. The three dining rooms presented a sorry sight after the row. Soup and water were spilled over the floor; meat, potatoes, tumblers, pitchers, mustard, pepper and salt, castors and broken crockery lay scattered about—an indescribable wreck. Capt. Catlin soon gathered his men and marched back to his quarters. Gen. Rathbun, Major DeForrest and Mayor Thatcher were promptly on hand, and Capt. Catlin was arrested and taken to a station house. His hands were badly cut by a knife which the waiter drew on him. He was also partially intoxicated, and when arrested was at the bar of the Delavan drinking a glass of brandy. He is not fit to command a company, and although President of Owego, he was so much intoxicated while drilling his men that he could not walk straight.\n\nNeither our officers nor men countenance such proceedings as those of to-day, although they have felt very indignant towards Mr. Roesslle of the Delavan for not furnishing better fare. In justice to Quarter-Master Van Vechten, I would say that the dinner furnished to-day was such as no one ought to object to, and doubtless all would have gone off smoothly, but for the unfortunate difficulty between Capt. Catlin and the waiter.\n\nThe man whose leg is broken is the steward, Alexander Nichols. He has been carried home.\n\nWhile I write, a strong guard from the Corps and Continentals, under command of Capt. Mc- Quade, is stationed at the quarters. No danger, however, is apprehended at present, nor at all, unless some new trouble arises, which is not probable.\n\nCapt. Michel of the Seymours, was the recipient yesterday of a beautiful sword, presented by Oriental Lodge, Free and Accepted Masons, of Utica.\n\nYours, for our country. D. F. R.\n\nThe Corps in Albany—No better proof is needed of the high estimation in which the Corps is held at Albany, than the fact that the Governor called on them to do guard duty and keep in restraint their riotous fellow soldiers; this, too __er the members of the Corps had of themselves __en much worse treated than the rioters.\n\nThe Corps Volunteers at Albany.\n\nTo the Editor of the Utica Morning Herald:—\n\nHEADQUARTERS U. C. C.,\n\nALBANY, May 1.\n\nThe military spirit is still alive here, and among most of the volunteers is growing stronger each day. Still the gloomy weather of yesterday and the evening before had quite a material effect on the spirits of our men, causing some of them to sit around on mattresses and benches and think sadly of the loved ones' at home, and the pleasant accommodations they had left to endure the hardships and fatigues, the uncertainties and tiresome detentions of a soldier's life. There were, it is true, some homesick ones. Nor is it strange, for the excitement and the pleasant weather which for a few days sustained the spirits of our men, are both gone, and they have only the amusements of the moment, or the strong sense of duty which impelled most of our men to volunteer in the service, to keep their spirits up. But with such dismal weather as we have to-day, it is hard for one to keep his temper and feelings in jubilant condition. Besides, much anxiety is expressed by nearly all to leave Albany and march to the seat of war. This state of uncertainty and suspense is decidedly unfavorable to a patient state of mind.\n\nQuite a large number of troops are quartered here, and they are constantly arriving. The great heart of the loyal North at every throb sends forth a body of willing, eager patriots, ready to redeem the honor of their land, by spilling, if need be, their last drop of blood beneath the stars and stripes, and spending the last breath in a viva for the glorious old flag. Yesterday, Capt. Michael McQuade's company arrived from Utica, and are quartered in the same building with the rest of the Corps regiment. The company under command of Capt. Tyrrell, from Norwich, a re also in the building, making all together six companies. This forenoon we had a dress parade in front of the quarters, which was considered very good indeed. The men have had considerable drilling, and as a general thing are remarkably apt at learning the movements, both in the march and in the manual, although we have but very few guns at present with which to learn the manual. Next week, however, and perhaps before, we shall have both uniforms and arms, and then we will be ready for anything. I am unable to say when the troops from Utica will leave this town, but I hope it will be very soon. A short but thorough campaign would, I think, but suit the spirit of our men and the needs of the times. As far as I am able to learn we will probably go to Maryland or Virginia, there to hold the rebels in check, and prevent their base, tyrannical feet from defiling the free soil of the North. It will never answer to allow our free borders to be made the scene of bloodshed and rapine. These curses must, if they fall at all, be visited upon the ground of the traitor. They, and they alone should suffer from the blighting influence of the civil war which their rebellious arms have entailed upon the country, and in their own territory we are ready to meet the dastards , and mete out to them just and deserved punishment.\n\nA little better satisfaction is given in the matter of victualling since so much excitement has been created about it. The food is still of the plainest character, and none too clean and delicate in its serving, but it is an improvement upon the old style—no thanks to Mr. Roessle, though. He was compelled to do better, or he would have had no soldiers to feed, since the Owego company, under Capt. Catlin, gave the mess room and its colored denizens such a dressing out, the proprietor of the Delavan has been conscious that the soldiers he feeds are not all base plebeians to be trod upon and insulted with impunity. None of us are sorry that Capt. Catlin of Oswego acted the part he did, for it has helped to produce better meals. Capt. C., who appears a perfect gentleman now that he has recovered from the liquor which heated his brain on the day of the row, expresses himself heartily sorry that such a proceeding should have taken place, and has since shown himself willing and anxious to redeem his name from the blemish which this affair cast upon it.\n\nNo complaint has since been heard of the behavior of himself or men, and in all probability there will be none hereafter.\n\nThe Burgesses Corps left here last evening. The Company numbered about eighty, of which number there was only one private of the old Burgesses Corps. This is rather a hard rub on the old Corps, who have always been considered so fine a company. Most of the officers are from the old company, making altogether fifteen members from the old Burgess Corps who have volunteered.\n\nI know of no sickness among the Oneida county men. Our joker, Harris, was sent up to the Hospital, but returned yesterday, and gave a side-splitting account of his adventures at \"the place,\" and how he got out. He was very lonesome up there, and could not bear to be separated from his company. His sickness was of short duration, but an account of what he saw and did would fill two columns; and it should be heard to be relished. More anon.\n\nYours for our country, D. F. R.\n\nThe Corps Volunteers at Albany.\n\nHEADQUARTERS U. C. C.,\n\nALBANY, May 2.\n\nTo the Editor of the Utica Morning Herald:—\n\nThe grand feature of our life in the quarters to-day has been a delicious lunch from Utica, directed to Lieut. Crocker, of the Corps. It came down this morning, in baskets—two good bushels of such edibles and niceties as our Utica ladies know so well how to prepare, and they were received with such smiles of welcome as can only rest on the faces of hungry and grateful volunteers like ourselves. We learned from a private source that the kind donors are young ladles of Utica, and from the same mysterious source we discovered their names to be Annie Peckham, Nellie Gillmore, Emma Cassidy, Sarah Reed and Emma Reed. We beg their pardon for publishing names, but a deed so kind and so gratefully received may not pass unnoticed. Had our lady friends looked in upon us when the tables were spread, and the boys seated around to eat the cold meats, pies, cakes, relishes, etc., which their hands had furnished, they would have beheld a pleasing sight, and one which would at least partially have repaid them for their trouble. All had expected to march down to the hated Adams House for dinner, but the sight of the fat baskets lugged in from the cars dispelled all thoughts of cadness, and threw over each and every face a glow as pleasant as the sunshine left after the passing shadow of a summer cloud. Tables were hauled into order, cloths, napkins, etc., spread, and the victuals arrayed in most tempting order. Then, without extended or tiresome ceremony, all partook.—The most extravagant expressions of satisfaction were made by all in regard to the \"style\" of the dinner, and unnumbered praises bestowed upon the fair donors. All unite in returning thanks for the kindness of their friends. May they live to see their loved land more than ever blessed, and all their friends returned to them with abundant honors and glory.\n\nThe sun again shines brightly to-day, and in conjunction with the good dinner from home, has put the best of spirits into the hearts of the men, and inspired them with new and stronger courage. None are sick, though some are ailing a little. Captain Harrer, of the German Rifles, is not well.\n\nThe prospect is good at present for the speedy completion of our Regiment. We have now six companies, and more are expected immediately. The rural districts are just awaking, and send in their contributions of tough and manly yeomanry by almost every train. Capt. A. J. Barney, of Belleville, to-day, reported a company of 91 men ready for action, and Capt. S. J. Mendell, of Adams, a company of 81 men.—Orders have been telegraphed to-day for the inspection of these companies, and they will probably very soon join us here. Capt. Michael McQuade, Jr.'s company has been accepted, as has also the Boonville company, under command of Capt. Miller.\n\nTo-morrow, I understand, we will be quartered at the Barracks, some two miles from Stanwix Hall. What our living will be up there I cannot say, but understand that we will not be allowed to fare worse there than we have here. Yesterday fifty muskets were sent to us, and with these we are drilling in the manual. If nothing happens to hinder, we will be a Regiment by the latter part of next week—then, ho, for the sunny South!\n\nYours for the country, D. F. R.\n\nTHE FOURTEENTH REGIMENT.—Yesterday's New York Times has the following:\n\nThe Fourteenth Regiment, New York State Volunteers, Col. McQuade, will arrive in this City at 10 o'clock to-morrow morning. A very beautiful regimental standard for this regiment was furnished by Tiffany & Co., on Saturday, to the order of gentlemen of our city. It is of the dimensions proscribed by State military regulations—six feet by four and a half, and its material a rich, dark blue silk, heavily fringed in yellow. The staff is of lancewood, mounted in fire-gilt, tipped with a silver spear head, and so constructed as to fold together when not in use. The device of the flag, elegantly embroidered, represents the military arms borne by our New York contingent, the shield containing in one-half the State arms, and in the other the bars of the Federal coat. Over the shield is the State crest, the eagle perched on the globe, and beneath it a graceful garter inscribed Excelsior. Under this motto is the Regimental designation, Fourteenth Regiment, New York Volunteers.\n\nThe Fourteenth Regiment has been encamped some weeks at Albany. It is mainly composed of Oneida county men, Utica, Rome, and other towns of the neighborhoods contributing companies. One company, and one that is sure to be efficient, however, is made up entirely of stalwart Welshmen, whom the storm of war has seduced from their farms on the hill-sides of Steuben. The regimental roll shows ten companies, of sixty-four men each, with the officers and drum corps, making up the regulation number—seven hundred and eighty. The Colonel commanding is James McQuade, of Utica, till now Captain of the well-known \"Citizen's Corps,\" of that city. The Lieut.-Colonel and Major went through the Mexican war. The above named company, which was originated in 1836, under the patronage and instruction of the late Bevet-Major E. K. Barnum, at that time situated in the regular service, at Utica, has long held a most honorable position among the independent military organizations of the State, and now volunteering for the war, worthily flanks a regiment, of which it has been in some manner the nucleus.\n\nThe Fourteenth is entirely made up of serviceable material, its members generally being well to-do specimens of the farming population of Oneida. The time it has been in camp has not only availed to insure a more than ordinary discipline, but likewise to provide all things essential in the way of furniture and general equipment, so that it is perhaps in better marching order than any corps as yet numbered in the Empire State quota. Two regiments from the same county have preceded it, by way of Elmira. Besides this, the same good county has already given seven commanders of regiments to the cause of the Union.\n\nThe Fourteenth Regiment will reach the city by Tuesday's morning boat from Albany. At the landing it will be received by some three hundred natives of Oneida county, now resident in New York. Since the programme of receptions and presentations has been under way, it may be remarked that such an astonishing number of Oneida-born folk has been discovered in our midst, as to warrant the belief that more residents of this metropolis are from that county than from any other in the United States. Measures have already been taken to form a permanent association of the New York sons of Oneida. The Marshal on Tuesday is to be Col. W. W. Backus, the first Captain of the \"Utica Citizens' Corps.\" The regiment will march to the Park, where it will be reviewed by Maj.-Gen. Dix and the Mayor, after which the colors will be presented by Charles Tracy, Esq. Among the sons of Oneida in the escort, the City clergy will be represented by Rev. Dr. Burchard, Rev. Dr. Whedon, Rev. T. L. Harris and others; the legal fraternity by Judges Capron and Maynard, Wm. Curtis Noyes, S. M. Blatchford, Greene C. Brenson, Luther S. Marsh, Charles P. Kirkland, etc.; the editorial by Messrs. Porter and Wilder, of the Post; Eton Comstock, of the Journal of Commerce; Rowley, of Brooklyn; C. Edwards Lester and L. N. Fowler; while the less distinguished men of miscellaneous classifications are too numerous to mention.\n\nCo. D. Fourteenth Regiment.—The company enlisted here by M. McQuade, Jr., as Captain, has been disbanded at Albany, that officer having previously resigned, as we are informed. Lieut. R. J. CANTWELL, on whom then the command devolved, feels aggrieved that the company should be broken up, and charges that it was done in consequence of pique and bitterness on the part of the Colonel towards himself. The body of the company join in the following card of endorsement of Lieut. CANTWELL:\n\nBARRACKS, May 20th, 1861.\n\nWe, the undersigned, members of Company D of the 14th Regiment, under Col. McQuade, do hereby affix our respective names to the following statement, viz:\n\nIt having been reported at Head Quarters at Albany, and at Utica, \"the place where we enlisted to serve our respective officers,\" reports derogatory to R. J. Cantwell; being members under his commission, we are taken not only with surprise but with indignation, to know that such a report has been thought of much less believed; and not only will we serve him here, but we are willing to serve under him as our leader in this war for one, two or three years, he being the only commissioned Officer who has stuck by us at all times, and under all circumstances, since we left Utica. We respect him as a true soldier, and a man true to himself, his country, and the men entrusted to his care. The balance of the Commissioned Officers will meet their just deserts by their own conscience, when they come to their \"sober\" thoughts, and think of their career since they left Utica.\n\nD W Manning, his\n\nA G Bice, James X Whalen,\n\nHenry Reynolds, mark\n\nJohn P Mason, John Patterson,\n\nJohn C O'Neil, Evan Evans,\n\nThomas H Gray, John C Evans,\n\nOwen Derley, Watt M O'Kenzie,\n\nJob Mahany, John Hays,\n\nJas Devin, Charles H Terry,\n\nFrank McGuire, John L Buchanan,\n\nC S Mason, Harlow S Tyler,\n\nGeorge Clifford, John Riley,\n\nN Fitzgerald, John M Howes,\n\nGeorge W Lewis, Gaius J Jones,\n\nRichard P Prichard, Chas A Nims,\n\nJohn Hompsom, John Sherman,\n\nJoseph Mullen, C G Dimbleby,\n\nVolney Eaton Waffle, John Dally,\n\nWilliam A Brown, Horace Chase,\n\nGeo Higham, George Crawford,\n\nGeorge Ferguson, Peter Morris.\n\nJoel Omans,\n\nCard from Lieut. R. J. Cantwell.\n\nTo the Editor of the Utica Morning Herald:—\n\nAn article appeared editorially in the Evening Telegraph of the 22d inst., clothed in language more befitting a billingsgate pauper than an Editor or Correspondent, and was intended, as I have since learned, to be a reply to a card published in the Herald of the same date, over the signatures of forty members of Company D, denying the false reports that were being circulated, derogatory and defamatory of my character as officer of that company, which was voluntary on their part, unsolicited and entirely unknown by me until I received it, accompanied with a request that it should be published in the daily papers of this city; and as false reports were freely circulated through this city and at Albany, by Col. McQuade, and the few that comprise the body guard of that most worthy officer, calculated to injure me in the estimation of those unacquainted with the facts; and feeling under obligation to them for this testimonial of their kind regards, I caused the same to be published. I did not intend to give it further consideration, but as reports of a \"bread pudding\" nature were constantly reaching me from head quarters, I have concluded to state a few facts connected with camp life in Albany, and the manner in which business is transacted by the head and front of the 14th Regiment.\n\nFirstly: I volunteered my services as a private in Co. A, or rather as a member of the U. C. C., before we left this city for Albany. Col McQuade told me that he intended forming a Regiment, and that he had a good position in reserve for me, and wished me not to accept any company office that might be offered. Notwithstanding this fair proposal on his part, after we went into quarters at Albany I returned to Utica on a visit, and while here was unanimously elected Lieutenant of Company D, without his knowledge or consent, and returned to Albany, after an absence of three days, with fifty-four as good soldiers as ever shouldered a musket. Immediately on my return I met Col. McQuade, who renewed his assurances, and with his patronizing air applauded my success.\n\nIn order that this company should be accepted immediately, and insure to him three more votes for Colonel, he promised to fill up the company himself on the next day, which he did with a few names of members from other companies, and the balance with names of volunteers rejected by the examining surgeon, that were remaining in Albany at the time. These men, as far as service in Company D was concerned, might as well have been John Doe and Richard Roe, for I am certain they never came under my supervision while in command of the company. Company D was accepted, although the handwriting of the \"Colonel\" was visible in the signatures of one-third of the names. This roll is now on file in the Adjutant General's office, and shows for itself. After he was elected Colonel, and had no further use of the officers for his personal promotion, he desired the company should be disbanded and distributed throughout other companies that were a few short of their complement. To this I took objection, and to which I attribute the first step towards engendering the displeasure of this self-sacrificing soldier.\n\nAfter giving my individual attention to the wants of my men and to the labor incumbent upon me as acting Captain and Lieutenant, during my stay in Albany, it became necessary for me to return to Utica on business of importance to myself and office with which I had been connected for the past seven years. I met Col. McQuade and told him I desired to return to Utica for a day or two, as business called me there. He told me if I went I need not return, and his manner of speech was such as to convey anything but a friendly feeling with it, which I think was an assumption of authority and a step beyond the ridiculous. I came to Utica, leaving Capt. M. McQuade, Jr., in charge, transacted my business, telegraphed the Colonel that I would return the next day, which I did, and found that upon receipt of my dispatch, he had gone to the barracks and informed the commissioned officers of Company D that I would return the next day. These officers immediately resigned—wherefore I know not, unless it was the good position he held in reserve for me was promised them. He then informed the company that as their Captain and Ensign had resigned, and their Lieutenant had deserted, he, upon the authority in him vested, did then and there declare Company D disbanded.\n\nSince then the position to which Ensign Merviue was to have been promoted has been given to John F. McQuade, (brother of the Colonel) and Ensign M. has been assigned a noncommissioned office. \"Consistency! thou art a jewel.\" On my arrival at Albany I was met by the Colonel, and informed that Company D had been disbanded, and upon my demanding an explanation, was politely informed that if I deigned to address any conversation to his highness, he would \"slap my chops,\" which, upon being invited to do, he ran up the white feather, and concluded that \"discretion was the better part of valor,\" and this being Sunday, he probably betook himself to humiliation and prayer.\n\nThis is but a plain statement of the manner in which I deserted from the McQuade Regiment, and this, too, after the Colonel having told a gentleman from this city, in the dining hall of the Delavan House, that he did not intend that I should go with the Regiment in any form; that he could and did intend to disband Company D, and that I, having been Lieutenant, could not consistently go as a private, and would return home. This conversation took place two weeks previous to the disbanding of the company, which but shows a foregone conclusion; and for all this I am stigmatized as a deserter, a milk-sop, coward, public defamer, and writer of people's names—the latter probably infers to the roll of Company D, now on file in Albany above referred to. But the source from which these epithets emanate is unworthy of notice, and has been from its infancy.\n\nI have thus far refrained from any allusion to outside matters connected with the affairs of the Regiment, but \"when forbearance ceases to be a virtue,\" I will let the curtain fall, that the Colonel may \"see himself as others see him. R. J. CANTWELL.\n\nTHE VOLUNTEERS.—The morning train from Boonville, yesterday brought down a splendid company of men, under command of Captain MULLER, numbering 89. They were headed by the Boonville Brass Band, who patriotically tendered their services as escort to this city.—Boonville turned out en masse to bid them farewell; Hon. RICHARD HULBERT made a soul-stirring speech, and Mr. CHARLES WHEELOCK presented each man with a copy of the Testament—earnestly recommending its daily use.—The generous ladies of Boonville have volunteered to furnish the whole company with shirts, which will be sent to Albany. On their arrival in town they marched to the Corps' Armory, were inspected and sworn in by Gen. WHITE, after which they elected officers. The following is the roll of officers and men:\n\nOfficers.\n\nCaptain, Chas F Muller 4th Sergeant, Geo Pike\n\n1st Lieut, Wm A Rowen 1st Corporal, E H Sawyer\n\nEnsign, Delos Cramer 2d Corporal, Myron Blake\n\n1st Sergeant, Geo E Buss 3d Corporal, J Hanserman\n\n2d Sergeant, Wm Yule 4th Corporal, Luke Jones\n\n3d Sergeant, Chas W Seeley\n\nPrivates.\n\nJ W Bateman Chas C Johnson J Tweedle\n\nJ Otis Butts Robert M Jones Newton J Titus\n\nKarl Batemann John Kirchner A M Van Antwerp\n\nAlbert Badou John Loren Richard Vickers\n\nByron S Bonney Wm Leo Cephas Wood, Jr.\n\nPeter Benson Philander Lane Peter A Waggoner\n\nWm Barker John W Miller A Walter\n\nJacob Beebee W W Mather Hiram Whitney\n\nElijah M Brown Geo W Semmers H Wheeler\n\nRichard Cark Livingston Meeker Aaron Woodcock\n\nWilliam Cark Joel A Merrills Albert Walker\n\nWilliam Clancey Mathew Maloney Wm Yule\n\nLeonard Doig Israel L Mullens Robert Yule\n\nDelevan Devoe C Manning M Obercitzer, Jr.\n\nJohn Dennis John O'Brien H Griffith\n\nAlex De Peyster Geo Pike John A Gronk\n\nAlex R Edgehill John H Putham Daniel Sullivan\n\nJohn Farrell C N Phelps Geo E Blake\n\nCharles Francis Newton _hilbrich Geo Widington\n\nClinton G Grant H H Rockwell Harry W Sedrance\n\nMiles Gookins James Ryan Geo Klink\n\nEdward Galvin Wm Radley Geo Phelps\n\nWm Hinton Wm A Rowan Wm J Williams\n\nEzra T Hartley Geo Ransher J W Bellinger\n\nWm Hubbard F Rathka Henry Clark\n\nEdwin Higby T Shultz John Joslin\n\nJacob Hanserman D S Stanbury C Seeley\n\nJames H Jackson\n\nThey left for Albany on the 4 P.M. train where they are to join the Corps Regiment, and be known as Company G. The Home Guard turned out in respectable array and escorted them to the Depot, where their departure was witnessed by a large crowd.\n\nNEW YORK STATE TROOPS.\n\nBATAVIA, May 15, 1861.\n\nThe third company of volunteers from Genessee county, commanded by Capt. W. L. Cowen, left here at six o'clock P. M. for Albany.\n\nThe Fourteenth Regiment.\n\nHEADQUARTERS 14TH REGIMENT,\n\nALBANY, May 21st, 1861.\n\nTo the Editor of the Utica Morning Herald:—\n\nMuch to the disappointment of all interested in the 14th Regiment, H. W. Slocum declined the office of Lieutenant Colonel, to which position he was elected last week. The cause of his declination was a previous appointment as Colonel of one of the Elmira Regiments. A second election was held yesterday morning, and Major Skillin elected Lieut. Colonel, and Lieut. Charles B. Young, of New York, Major. The capabilities of Lieut. Col. Skillin are well known. He will make a good and faithful officer. Maj. Young served as Lieutenant in the New York Mexican Volunteers, under Col. Henry S. Burton, and in that position distinguished himself as an officer. He was thirteen months in actual service on the Pacific coast, his detachment being the only one that saw service in that quarter. During the campaign, Major Young occupied responsible positions, and in all cases discharged his trust satisfactorily. He was Adjutant of his Regiment during the last eight months of his service. All seem satisfied with the choice which has been made, and I doubt not that Major Young will prove himself worthy of the honor conferred on him.\n\nOnly part of our uniforms have as yet been received. Quartermaster Bates, by driving matters, has secured the first that will be ready.—The uniform will probably consist of a gray jacket and overcoat, light blue pants, and blue fatigue cap. It makes a neat and durable uniform, but if the gray suit is decided upon, it will be several days before all the uniforms will be ready, as but few have been manufactured.\n\nThe staff officers will be sworn in to-day.\n\nChaplain Hewes preached last Sunday evening at the Green Street Church. His sermon was patriotic, and listened to by a large number of volunteers. Port-Chaplain Rogers, of this city, preached at the barracks Sunday afternoon.\n\nThe members of Company A wish to acknowledge the receipt of a large and delicious invoice of provisions from their friends in Utica, Whitesboro, Oriskany, etc.\n\nCapt. Brazie, of Company B, was last week the recipient from his friends in Utica, of a large and beautiful ornamental fruit cake, with his name inscribed upon it. It was as agreeable to the taste as to the eye. While we remain in Albany, our friends are not likely to forget it.\n\nAs a general thing the men are enjoying good health; and if any should be unwell, they will be well cared for by our surgeons, Churchill and West, who are here ready to render medical aid to all who require it.\n\nWe have not yet received marching orders, and the probabilities are that our Regiment will remain here several weeks.\n\nYours for our country, D. F. R.\n\nBanner Presentation to the Fourteenth Regiment at Albany, Yesterday.\n\nALBANY, May 24.\n\nBy Telegraph to the Utica Morning Herald:—\n\nThe barracks was a scene of excitement today. The 14th Regiment, for the first time, made a dress parade from different points. The suit is a very dark blue, and consists of overcoat, jacket and trousers, with woolen underclothes. After the dress parade, before the companies were dismissed, Messrs. BARNARD and LANE, in behalf of the ladies of Utica, presented Col. MCQUADE the. magnificent banner we have been hearing so much about.\n\nJudge SMITH of Utica, accompanied the presentation with a speech, short but eloquent, and brimming with patriotic sentiments. Colonel MCQUADE, in behalf of the Regiment, gracefully thanked the fair donors, and gave his pledge that it should never fall into the hands of the enemy. The banner was unfurled and floated in the stiff, south wind that was blowing at the time. So will it wave in every southern breeze, while ever borne by the, 14th, determined, carrying with it the undisputable prestige of right, freedom and victory.\n\nA goodly number are present from Utica—among the ladies, Mrs. JAMES MCQUADE. Immediately after the banner was presented, Cos. A and B marched to the front and faced center of the line, when Hon. A. HUBBELL presented Capt. BRAZIE and Lieut. DAGGETT, of Company B, each with a handsome sword, from their friends in Utica. The presentation was accompanied with appropriate remarks both by the donor and recipients. All then assisted in singing the Star Spangled Banner at the conclusion of which Col. MCQUADE proposed three cheers for the ladies of Utica, and forth they came, so loud and hearty that they might have terrified the whole host of Southern traitors and assassins. Rousing cheers were also given for Gen. RATHBONE, the Colonel and the flag.\n\nDuring the parade the news arrived of Col. ELLSWORTH'S death by assassination, the aggressive movements into Virginia, and that the 14th would probably soon be ordered to the seat of action. The former part of the intelligence caused all hearts to burn with just indignation, and a deep desire to punish the dark crime while the latter was hailed with joy, and every one expressed himself ready to march on the morrow, if necessary. The death of Col. ELLSWORTH is the general subject of conversation here to-night, all surmising a terrible vengeance at the hands of his Fire Zouaves.\n\nVery important military dispatches are expected from Washington to-night. I would not be surprised if we were ordered to march to Washington tomorrow.\n\nYours for our country, D. F. R.\n\nThe Fourteenth Under Orders.\n\nALBANY, June 13.\n\nCol. McQuade's and Col. Jackson's Regiments, stationed at the Industrial School Barracks, have received orders to hold themselves in readiness to march at a moment's notice.—They are anxiously awaiting the order for departure.\n\nTHE FOURTEENTH REGIMENT ORDERED TO THE SEAT OF WAR!—The following is a dispatch received by T. R. McQuade, Esq., last evening. The precise time of marching is not given, but it will be soon:\n\nALBANY, June 13th, 1861.\n\nThe Fourteenth Regiment having been ordered to proceed at once to the seat of war, all furloughs are hereby countermanded. All members must report at Headquarters before Friday, June 14th, at four o'clock, p. m., or be treated as deserters. By order,\n\nJAMES MCQUADE, Colonel.\n\nDEPARTURE OF THE FOURTEENTH.—At three o'clock yesterday afternoon, Col. MCQUADE'S Regiment left the Industrial School Barracks, where they have been so long pining in restless inaction. They were escorted by Company B., and the Cadet Zouaves, of Albany, and by a hundred or more of Uticans, and numerous citizens from other localities which have furnished companies for the Fourteenth. The people of Albany turned out by thousands to witness the military display, and cry huzza to the brave departing soldiers. The Albany Journal says of the appearance of the troops: \"In their dark blue uniform and full accoutrements, with their new muskets, and soldierly bearing, they looked formidable, and massive. Col. MCQUADE has a noble command, and he will lead it bravely to battle.\n\nFourteenth Regiment at the Seat of War.\n\nThe following clever and interesting letter, reaches us under the frank of Congressman Van WYCK, of this State:\n\nWASHINGTON, June 22.\n\nTo the Editor of the Utica Morning Herald:\n\nPremising that you have heard all about our reception in New York long ere this, I will omit any description of it, save to say that it was flattering and agreeable to all interested in the Fourteenth. We are now in Washington.\n\nEN ROUTE TO THE CAPITAL.\n\n… on the course of the Fourteenth from New York to Washington. We left the metropolis at half-past 3 p. m. Tuesday, rushed at the heels of the iron horse through the classic regions of New Jersey, passing Princeton; the lordly Delaware; Trenton, where the haughty Hessians yielded to a handful of frozen, foot-sore, but God-protected patriots led by our country's Father; past Bordentown, made memorable as the residence for many years of Joseph Bonaparie and other eminent Frenchmen; and passing within sight of William Penn's former residence, on the opposite side of the river. Our route through Jersey is full of historic interest, and at least one of the party enjoyed the ride. The country, especially the lower part, is very fertile and well cultivated, the cars running for miles through luxuriant clover eadows, thrifty peach orchards, and thick waving grain fields. It is a great country, too, for vegetables, supplying the New York and Philadelphia markets with early luxuries.\n\nIt was near 9 o'clock when we arrived at Philadelphia. The men were fatigued, hungry and thirsty, and expected to remain so till they reached Washington. But such was not the idea of the ladies of the town. The moment we reached Camden, a signal was given, and forthwith tables were spread in a building fitted up for the purpose close by the depot, and the entire regiment feasted on delicious ham sandwiches and coffee, dealt out mainly by ladies, who manifested the utmost interest in the welfare of the men. In return, the men gave cheers upon cheers for the ladies and philanthropic men of Philadelphia. And this is not a single case.—Every regiment that passes through the city, at whatever time of night or day, is served in the same manner by these patriotic ladies. Let Philadelphia be remembered as filled with men and women whose hearts are gushing with kindness and good will, and whose hands are ready to obey their noble impulses. Remember Philadelphia! The supper was not all. While the men were refreshing themselves, an immense crowd had gathered along the railroad, all apparently eager to say a word of cheer or speak a goodbye. In this crowd the women far outnumbered the men, and were perfectly enthusiastic. It was after 12 o'clock when the long, heavy train started out of the depot, and then came a scene which is only paralleled by the parting scene at Utica, yet of a different nature. In this there were no tears shed—all was wild enthusiasm.—The moon shone brightly in a scene that more resembled some eastern carnival that the departure of a regiment of volunteers. At one end of the train a chorus of our vocalists were singing national songs, surrounded by a crowd of pleased listeners; at the other end, where the men were getting aboard, ladies were giving away aprons, handkerchiefs, pin-cushions, and all sorts of mementoes for the men to bear with them as keepsakes, and asking no remuneration therefor, only to be remembered by the recipients. Kisses—I never saw the market so easy in all my experience. They were given away as if valueless. For full half an hour some of our men, forgetful of past vows, received volley after volley without filtering or showing any signs of discouragement. Our gallant Major—who, by-the-bye, is the most \"gallant\" Major alive—proved himself a man of iron endurance by attending to at least a hundred \"fair ladyes.\" When at last the train moved away from the depot, it had to slowly plow its way through the surging mass of men and women that heaved back and forth with extended hands and vociferating throats. The side of the train fairly bristled with extended arms grasping hands that were reached in hundreds up for a parting shake. It seemed as if the road was lined for miles with people awaiting the pas-sage of the train. Cannon were fired all the way along through Philadelphia, and not a rod was passed that was not alive with fluttering handkerchiefs and resonant with ringing cheers from stentorian lungs. All this excitement, be it remembered, was between the hours of 12 and 1 in the night, and in a city where regiments are constantly passing through. Is there not something of the French in the American character, which only required such a war as the present to be developed? Where else such outbursts, save in France or America? And who shall say their names will not be synonyms of military power.\n\n\"THROUGH BALTIMORE.\"\n\nAbout 9 o'clock Thursday we approached the famous town of Baltimore. The first noticeable objects after leaving Havre de Grace, were Federal pickets, mounted and on foot, stationed along the railroad; then wrecks of burned bridges and locomotives, destroyed by the secessionists before driven away by the Federal arms; deserted residences; scattering negroes, who timidly cheered us as we passed along, lifting their hats with an air that said they would if they dared. Very slowly our train entered Baltimore, cheered as it came in by all who had pluck enough. Passing one immense iron foundry, the whole party of workmen came out in their red flannel shirts, and swinging their brawny brown arms in the air, gave cheers, long and lusty, for our regiment. Ah, those dusty, work-begrimed faces, with eyes that burn like the furnaces they rule, there is no mistaking them. They were not born and reared among the vaunted chivalry of the South; their muscles are hardened till they rival the tempered steel, and could smite a Beauregard dead at a single blow; but one of their hearts bums with more true chivalry than could be sifted out of all secessiondom. They were not afraid to show their colors any more than a lot of sailors whom we passed shortly after, as they stood aboard their vessel and held aloft the stars and stripes, cheering us with true sailor heartiness. But as we neared the center of the town, passing between rows of dirty houses, the windows of which were crammed with forlorn looking women and myriad children of all colors, some shouting for Jeff. Davis, and others for the Regiment, all signs of either approbation or dislike gradually diminished, and we were viewed in silence by a ragamuffin crowd. It is very likely that the white tents of the Federal troops encamped within sight of the depot, had much to do with the quiet of our reception in Baltimore. The Regiment was soon formed in regular line, and with drums beating took up its march through Baltimore for the other depot I could not help contrasting our reception in Baltimore, with the one at Philadelphia the previous night. Here, not a word was spoken. All the way to the depot we were followed by a large crowd, but not a cheer for the Flag or the Regiment. Surly looking fellows, whom I took to be \"plug uglies,\" kept close to the line of march, eyeing us all the way with a regular hangdog scrutiny, as if calculating how many thousand of their tribe it would take to whip us. Once in a while a man would step to the ranks and inquire what Regiment this was, but all the way prevailed the same ominous silence. No \"stars and stripes,\" nor flags of any sort, no cheers for either side, but all the way through a silent scrutiny of our men. We were not molested in any manner, but I have not the slightest doubt that were the Federal troops withdrawn, a Northern regiment would have to fight its way through Baltimore. It is the sink-hole of villains and treason-working traitors, and should be treated as one of the enemy's strongholds. Once through the vile town, we sped on our way rejoicing, yet hardly realizing, that we had really passed through Baltimore. From Baltimore to Washington, scarcely a mile of ground was passed that did not reveal a camp of Federal troops, their white tents shining through trees, cresting hilltops and spotting valleys. We reached Washington about 1 o'clock.\n\nAT THE CAPITAL.\n\nOn reaching Washington we discovered that Quartermaster Bates had secured a temporary camp on the grounds of President Lincoln, close by the White House, and to this delightful spot the Fourteenth was at once marched. This was a special favor, for which the Regiment is indebted to Mr. Bates, and to the same energetic officer they are also indebted for an extra good supply of camp equipage and for their present magnificent camp ground.\n\nBy 7 o'clock in the evening, the Regiment being sufficiently rested, and having been inspected by President Lincoln, marched out of the city about one mile to the place where we are now encamped. We are delightfully located in a wood, on the southern slope of a hill, on the grounds of Col. Stone, a burly, clever man, with a large leghorn hat. This is the same ground occupied by the New York Seventh at one time, and has become interesting from being the scene of a skirmish in the early part of the war. A small brick dwelling on the ground is full of bullet marks, and the trees in some parts of the wood are also marked with bullets. On the grounds is a fine spring with a pump, which supplies the Regiment with excellent water—a very good thing in camp life. We are surrounded by Regiments. Our nearest neighbors are the Ninth N. Y. City Regiment, the Eighteenth New York, a Maine Regiment, an Ohio Regiment, and Col. Christian's Regiment, the Twenty-\n\nSixth, which later arrived to-day from Elmira. Half-a-dozen other regiments are within sight, but I have not learned where from as yet.\n\nCAMP LIFE.\n\nCould some of our Utica artists who have a particular eye for the picturesque but look in upon us, they would find ample employment for pencil or brush, and perhaps for their cacchiunatory muscles. The encampment taken as a whole—the white tents mingling with the deep green of the trees above and around them—is striking, (no pun) and romantic, but once descend into details—once get a clear, microscopic view—and the enchantment vanishes, or at least assumes another form. Could some of our Utica friends behold some of their Fourteenth friends huddling about the Quarter-Master's Provision Depot, and finally, in triumph lugging off a chunk of salt pork or beef, they would, I think, be more struck with the novelty than the romance of the sight. Yet they might well envy us the appetite with which said salt beef or pork is eaten, cooked not quite so delicately as Utica kitchens were wont to prepare us food. All sorts of men are turned cooks. Even your humble servant had the honor of making some beef steak and a cup of tea, to-day, which were pronounced \"good\" by Surgeon Churchill and Major Young. So I am vain enough to imagine that I could \"keep a hotel,\" under certain circumstances. It is astonishing how proud it makes a man to feel that he can cook a meal of victuals in good style. The best man in the Regiment is he who can best handle a frying-pan, with a steak in it. As a general thing, I believe, the men get along well cooking their own rations, though there are some grumblers, as there must be for variety. The allowance to day consisted of fresh beef, with a small bit of salt pork, bread, coffee and sugar, and salt. Those who have any money can for a few pennies buy enough luxuries to make a very nice meal, and those who live on the bare rations ought not to lose flesh.\n\nWAR AND RUMORS OF WAR.\n\nThe secessionists are but a few miles from here, and we hear daily rumors of their movements across the river. To-night, however, on dress parade, more serious news came. An aid of General Sandford, Col. Hamilton, rode up on a panting horse, while the Regiment was on parade. He brought intelligence that Beauregard was approaching Washington with 20,000 men. Orders were given for the Regiment to hold itself in readiness to march on five minutes' notice. Should such an order come, not a man will be found unprepared or unwilling.\n\nA REBEL IN THE CAMP.\n\nSome excitement was created to night in the camp by the report that a spy had got into the camp, and had been inquiring into business that did not belong to him. He went into Captain Thompson's company, and that officer, suspecting something wrong, called a guard and ordered his arrest, but before the guard arrived the illustrious stranger had vanished. Every effort was made to find him, but he was gone entirely. The camp is on the alert, and double guard is posted. Scouts are busy on every hand, and just this moment a party passed my tent, in the moonlight, remarking to the sentinel that there was a spy somewhere in the camp, and cautioning him to keep special watch. I only hope they'll catch the sneak. It really begins to look like war.—We are prepared.\n\nThe weather was very warm yesterday—thermometer up to 100; but the men did not suffer much. The nights are glorious. The moon is full, and such a scene as it shines on here is perfectly enchanting. There is just excitement enough in camp to make one wakeful, and the night is so lovely that he cannot regret his wakefulness. Several times to-night (it is now midnight) I have heard sentinels discharge their pieces in neighboring camps, whether from real or fancied danger, I know not. It sounds like the \"rude alarm of war,\" whether it be or not.\n\nYours, for our country, D. F. R.\n\n\"D. F. R.'S Spy Caught.\"\n\nSee Our Letter from the Fourteenth, on the Preceding Page. WASHINGTON, June 24.\n\nA detachment of the New York 14th Regiment arrested a spy this morning, who had full details of the number of troops, position and strength of the batteries around Washington. There was also found upon him a sketch of a plan of attack upon the city. He had the position of all the mounted cannon in the city.\n\nThe scouts of the New Hampshire 2d Regiment wounded a man this morning, who was approaching the lines, and observing carefully the position of the camps and batteries. He pretended to be unable to speak English at first, but recovered his knowledge of the language as soon as he was shot.\n\nAnother dispatch says:\n\nSeveral members of the New York 14th Regiment to-day arrested a suspected spy, among whose effects at the boarding house were plans of camps on the Virginia side, the position of batteries and the number of troops, and other valuable information. He was turned over to the military authorities.\n\nUtica Morning Herald\n\nand Daily Gazette.\n\nThe Fourteenth Regiment at Washington.\n\nWASHINGTON, D. C., July 8, 1861.\n\nTo the Editor of the Utica Morning Herald:\n\nThe Fourteenth Regiment, Colonel James McQuade commanding, is at last fairly settled in camp; and now that it is \"at home,\" is not only ready but anxious to receive \"calls.\" Not a man is here who does not long to hear the order to march into Virginia sounded. Leaving out the \"panics,\" for which our regiment is unrivaled, life begins to grow monotonous. All wish a change, and I imagine no more welcome sound could break on the ears of the majority of us than the midnight booming of the three alarm guns, summoning every soldier to arms, and perhaps to bloody tussle with the rebels. We have attained such a state of discipline and daring that the littlest man in camp can look and laugh \"grim-visaged war\" in the face.\n\nALIMENTATION.\n\nAt present the attention of the men is mainly devoted to the question of rations—a question, too, of large importance, and upon which very much might be said. I will, however, enter into detail only so far as to give the bill of fare furnished by the U. S. Government. I copy it from the printed regulations issued this campaign to the Subsistence Department by Simon Cameron, Secretary of war, It may be of interest to those desirous to know just how their brothers, sons or husbands are faring. The following is the daily ration allowed to each man: Of pork, 12 ounces, or of beef 1 1/2 lbs.; bread, 1 lb.; of beans, 64-hundredths of a gill, or rice 1 ounce and 6-tenths, or dessicated potatoes 1 ounce and 5-tenths, or prepared mixed vegetables 1 ounce; coffee, 1 and 6-tenths ounces; sugar, 2 and 4-tenths ounces; vinegar, less than half a gill; about one-half an adamantine candle; 64-hundredths of an ounce of soap; 16-hundredths of an ounce of salt. Tea is allowed on special requisition, and fresh beef not less than two days in a week, nor more than five. Such has been the draft on Government by troops, that often even these articles could not be furnished when needed by the regiments. In the basement of the Capitol, huge ovens are kept hot night and day, baking from 25,000 to 30,000 loaves of bread daily, yet often falling behind the demand.\n\nMuch aversion is felt by the men against eating pork, and it is not strange, for the wallowing, grunting, filthy scavenger of a beast is totally unfit for human food, and should be shunned whenever possible. The fare at the best is rough, and none who are dainty will do to \"go for a soldier.\" They might subsist on \"Adams House\" delicacies, but here they had better not come. A large number of the men are suffering from bowel complaints, occasioned either by the change of climate and water, or the food, or else all combined.\n\nTHE FOURTH IN WASHINGTON.\n\nThe greatest, and in fact the only remarkable feature of Independence Day in the Capital of the United States of America, was the parade of the New York State troops in Washington, under Gen. Sandford. It took place early in the forenoon, being all concluded by 10 o'clock. It was a proud sight for a Yorker to behold. At least fifteen thousand men passed in review before Gen. Scott, the President and his Cabinet—tread firm and bayonets glittering—all but a tithe of what the Empire State can and will do if requested. Gen. Scott was overheard by watchful ears to pay the Fourteenth a compliment. Fearing that you will not hear of it unless I tell it, I trust my Regimental egotism will be pardoned, when I say that the old veteran viewed us keenly from under his portentous eyebrows as we passed, then turning to Abraham Lincoln remarked: \"That's a fine marching regiment.\"\n\nThis is considered a very long feather. All day long the streets swarmed with soldiers, and the Capital was alive with them. They flocked thither to \"see Congress\" and the noble pile wherein that august body deliberates. The crowd in the House was fairly smothering, and the Senate Chamber was beset by thousands of eager individuals with straining eyeballs. To the mass the sights were entirely new, and were viewed with insatiable interest. And well might they be. The Capitol is worthy to excite admiration and wonder, with its magnificent marble, its grand stairways, sculptured columns and massive arches, mosaics, mirrors, labyrinthine halls and passages; its paintings and its statuary; its relics, mementoes and memories; and over all, its stately magnitude, so grand, so proud, so firm. The Rotunda, within which one feels so small, attracted many visitors. Here are historic pictures and portraits of emminent [sic] Americans.—Among the portraits is one of Buchanan, which, if its ears could hear, would wither at the execrations cast upon it by the soldiers, who only pause before it long enough to free their minds. Some rude person, not content with verbal expressions of contempt, has hurled a quid of tobacco against the canvass, the result of which is two brown streaks down across the forehead of the old Public Functionary, making him appear as if perspiring in great agony over the recollection of some of his past misdeeds. Next to this portrait is a painting, which more than any other has attracted my attention. It represents the embarkation of Pilgrims from Delft-Haven, Holland, in 1620. The scene is on the deck of the vessel, just before leaving. The group, consisting of about twenty persons, are in the attitude of prayer. In the center, with an open Bible before him, kneels the grey-haired minister, the father of the flock, with his hands meekly clasped imploring the Divine protection, while around him are the fathers and sons, husbands, wives and daughters of the heroic band. The figures in the group which especially pleased me, were those of Miles Standish and his wife Rose. In him the artist has most truthfully conceived and depicted the stern Puritan; in her face and expression he has thrown the soul of a trustful, devoted and devotional wife. There is in the attitude of Rose the most beautiful blending of the elements of religion and love.\n\nIn the evening there were displays of fireworks, but none that would compare with those annually let off in Utica. Yet all about the city, on every hill, from hundreds of camps, burned fires and darted rockets. The night was full of baleful lights and shadows. It did not seem to me like a Fourth of July, full of joyous exultations. Every red fire that blazed, blazed fiercely; every rocket that pierced the clouds hissed war; the trembling fires from roman candles told only of tumultuous feelings that held sway in thousands of armed breasts; the very sky seemed lit with lurid lights; while the comet burned like a flashing falchion, overhanging with threatening poise the war-distracted land. Occasionally the air would move with the dull, heavy boom of cannon from away down the Potomac, growling deep threats of vengeance and destruction from their iron throats. The intermediate stillness of the air seemed to embrace some indefinable horror, a vague foreshadowing, that made the soul stand back, afraid. To me the night was a solemn one, and I dreamed of shadowy armies, millions of moving men, black smoke, and thundering cannon.\n\nA SOLDIER'S LIFE.\n\nSoldiering is not play. It is not softening and refining to the disposition and habits of a man. It is one long, stern lesson of discipline, both physical and moral. He who can not endure the bodily stress is unfit for a warrior, and should return honorably to the pursuit of peaceful labors. Upon every one falls, too, a strict and trying moral discipline. A soldier's life, though adopted from the purest motives, is best fitted to call out all that is evil in a man's nature, and blunt the excellent qualities he may possess. The restraints of society are not about him. He is but one in a great crowd, and wrong doing does not stand out so plainly, does not look so repulsive as when he was surrounded by kindred who would look with downcast faces upon the smallest deviation from the path of virtue. I have penned these lines knowing that they may reach those who have brothers and sons in the army, and knowing that they may arouse painful apprehensions in their breasts; but they will not be causelessly aroused. \"Demoralization\" is a word often used in connection with the army, and justly. While some depart from honor's side, there are many who nobly stand by their principles as bravely as by the flag under which they fight. Such will return from the war with a moral stability that will resist any attack. Yet I can not forbear speaking this word of warning to those who may be forgetful of the trials they are really undergoing. Sisters and mothers can not utter an admonition in their letters to loved ones here, that will not find an acceptable and grateful resting place in the heart of a brother or a son. Temptations come here in almost impenetrable disguises.\n\nGeneral items of interest are rather scarce here just now. Our old friend, Carlincourt is here, still building balloons in the air. He is in the employ of the Government, and is to use his balloon for reconnoitering the enemy's position. His enterprise is very favorably looked upon by Gen. Scott.\n\nMr. F. M. Ellis, of New Hartford, Oneida county, has recently been employed by Gen. Mansfield, to act in the secret service. Mr. Ellis possesses the peculiar requisites for such a post—ready talent, experience in the country, and courage. He has already rendered himself serviceable to Government.\n\nThe telegraph keeps you well posted in military movements, so I will not dilate thereon, except to say that many regiments have crossed the river within a few days, and are constantly moving. As to political prospects and Congressional affairs, you will be too thoroughly posted for me to inform you anything new.\n\nMovements are on foot in Syracuse, started by Capt. Thompson, of Company H, to engage a band for our Regiment.\n\nI close this letter hoping that my next date will be in Virginia.\n\nOur camp was visited yesterday by Hon. Roscoe Conkling and T. S. Faxton. They received many warm greetings.\n\nYours, for our country, D. F. R.\n\nThe Fourteenth Regiment.\n\nCAMP DOUGLAS, WASHINGTON, July 16.\n\nTo the Editor of the Utica Morning Herald:\n\nI learn from Utica that the sympathies of some of our good people have been aroused by unfounded rumors to the effect that the men of this regiment are not well provided for. In order to save the expenditure of sympathy where there is no particular cause for it, I desire to say that the rations furnished to the men are abundant and of the best quality. They have fresh bread every day (brought into camp warm,) fresh beef three times a week, salt beef, salt pork, bacon, codfish, biscuit [sic], desiccated potatoes, mixed vegetables, fresh vegetables, beans, rice, vinegar, coffee, tea and sugar. The men, in fact, have more than they can eat. One of the captains informs me that his company sold a barrel of pork saved from their overplus rations, and other companies have disposed of their extra rations in the same way. When we first arrived in camp, the men being entirely unaccustomed to the preparation of food for themselves, undoubtedly concocted mixtures which were somewhat unpalatable; experience, however, has obviated this difficulty, and nobody now complains, except perhaps, a few who are too indolent to cook their food.\n\nThe health of the men is good. They were troubled with diarrhea to a considerable extent soon after our arrival, but have nearly all recovered, and there has not been a death in the regiment since we left Albany. Several men who were found incompetent to discharge military duty from various causes, most of which existed before their enlistment, have been discharged from the service. The men are generally contented and happy, notwithstanding the efforts of mischievous outsiders to breed discontent among them. Panics are now of a mushroom character. I understand, also, that rumors are afloat in Utica that there have been other troubles in the regiment. The only one that I know of was a slight difficulty growing out of an order issued by the Colonel preventing the Sutler from selling lager beer. The men were then afflicted with diarrhea, and the Colonel agreeing with me that it was injurious, ordered that the sale should be discontinued. During the illness and absence of the Colonel, some of the bad men of the regiment (and I am glad to say they are few in number,) tried to compel the Sutler to procure lager or liquor, which he refused to do. I merely write this letter so that our friends at home may not be unnecessarily troubled on our account, and for their information I have no objection to your publishing it.\n\nVery respectfully, ALONZO CHURCHILL.\n\nWe, the undersigned, Captains in the Fourteenth Regiment N. Y. S. V., fully concur in the sentiments expressed in the above letter.\n\nWASHINGTON, D. C., July 16, 1861.\n\nHORACE R. LAHE, Co. I.\n\nTHOMAS M. DAVIES, Co. A.\n\nW. R. BRAZIE, Co.

Goss signed the above in the absence of Capt. Thompson, who is home on leave.\n\nTHE FOURTEENTH REGIMENT.\n\nWASHINGTON, July 16th, 1861.\n\nTo the Editor of the Utica Morning Herald:\n\nI am tired of dating my letters at Washington. Nothing would afford me more pleasure than to inform the many who watch our movements with deepest interest, that the Regiment of which I am a component part, is marching against Jeff. Davis and his rebel crew. This I cannot do now. We are still in our camp on Meridian Hill, close by the Capital. Why we do not go with the crowd, is more than I can tell. Every day regiments cross the Potomac, leaving us behind. Some have gone over without stopping in Washington at all. Our men are well disciplined, and are fairly pining away for a brush with the enemy. In every respect we are capable to go into action, and I can only wish that we had a brave foe to encounter. This chasing the white-livered \"chivalry\" from pillar to post will be no more like war than driving hogs. I am not anxious to bathe my hands in the blood of these \"brothers,\" who have brought such deep and dark disgrace upon themselves and their long-forgiving Northern kin, but I would have justice dealt them; and moreover I am ashamed of them that they so poorly support their boast, and ashamed that such cowards should call themselves Americans. I am sorry ...en, or be they braggarts, be they of the same ...ame, or be they as they would wish to be, anther nation, bearing no relationship to Northern boors, they have fulfilled the part of traitors. As such we look upon them, and as such ours is the unpleasant task of flogging them, or chasing them, as the case may be. If they are \"our brothers,\" as some hypocritical Congressmen pathetically assert, it is not our fault. We can only regret being so poorly related. Where is the pater familias who would allow Sambo, his son, whom he has always patted on the head, to whom he gave the nicest chunk of the old farm, who has always had the pick of everything, yet who has greedily taken these gifts and cursed his sire because he did not give him all—where is the \"old gentleman\" who would not, on learning that the ungrateful wretch of a son had conspired to burn up the house through spite, take him by the nape of the neck and boot him till he repented. Or where is he who would look quietly on and witness the destruction of his family through the treacherous scheming of one base brother? Could they who have come to the Capital to defend its honor have their own way, the treason-spitting Vallandighams, Burnetts, Powells, Bayards, &c., who disgrace its halls by their presence, would be pitched out of the window \"neck and heels,\" no matter how loudly they might screech the word \"brother!\" Devils and Secessionists often assume the guise of saints to work their mischief in.\n\nI cannot believe that we shall much longer remain here, and can only account for our tarrying thus long by assuming that it has been a part of Gen. Scott's plan to keep a certain number of troops here, and that we have been among the unfortunate ones. The regiment is drilled constantly, and has attained a very marked degree of perfection in battalion evolutions, the manual, and the skirmish drill, the latter a feature of military exercise that has particularly met the approbation of the men. The general health of the regiment is much improved, very few remaining on the sick list at present. In this connection I would say that the hospital department has been well organized and perfected, and received many compliments from visitors. In this department is especially felt the good service rendered by Utica ladies, in furnishing stores and little comforts for the sick. The hospital tent is fitted up with straw mattresses, an article almost indispensable, yet which we would have been without but for the thoughtful care of our dear feminine friends. The men are rapidly becoming acclimated, and as their health improves, a corresponding improvement is observable in their dispositions. They feel a deeper interest in the regiment, and are less inclined to grumble when things do not go just right. There has been a great deal said about the regiment only being enlisted for three months. It is a mistake. We are in for two years. A few discontented spirits there are who would gladly go home at the end of that time, satisfied with the aid they have rendered their country; but I believe the regiment, as a whole, is unanimous for the war. They enlisted to fight, and will not turn back till the work is done. When they have helped to conquer a peace; when the land shall be ridded of traitors, and tyrants driven into the Gulf; when \"naked rebellion, with the torch and ax,\" shall be crushed utterly; when the chief conspirators shall have dangled in the Southern breeze; when the flag floats free from Maine to Louisiana; when law and order, liberty and right prevail South as well as North, then will they willingly, gladly return home—private and high private, Corporal, Captain and Colonel—relinquishing the sword and bayonet as easily as they took them up, and engaging, as of yore, in the peaceful pursuits of citizens.\n\nThere are few new phases of camp life. The weather has for the last few days been delightful. Regiments are constantly leaving and coming in all about us, filling the highways with their covered baggage wagons, and the air with their shouts and music. Blackberries are \"thick\" and luscious in the fields and along the skirts of the woods, affording rare dessert for the soldiers, who pick them by the bushel. They eat them with nice fresh milk, which is procured from obliging cows that pasture in the neighborhood. The men have a habit of \"foraging,\" which brings to camp many delicacies—but its morality is another question. I am told there are hundreds of acres of land about Washington that produce nothing but blackberries. They are the only cheap article in market, selling for a \"fip\" (sixpence) a quart. In the city, the streets are as lively as ever. Willard's Hotel, which is just now the very center of excitement, is crammed night and day, so that one can hardly find standing room. Here concentrate all military men, hither flock news-seekers, and public men of all kinds. All seem full of business and enthusiasm, discussing war news with great earnestness.\n\nQuartermaster Bates, of our Regiment, has resigned. Mr. Bates has filled the office of Quartermaster in an honorable manner, and has discharged the most arduous duties in such a manner as to deserve great credit. The Regiment has, to my certain knowledge been better provided for than two-thirds of those here, and will certainly miss the services of Mr. B. The position, however, is proverbially a thankless one, and he who occupies it is not to be envied. Mr. Bates will be succeeded by Mr. Brodhead, formerly of Baggs' Hotel, Utica, who will be an efficient officer in this department, having had some experience in the business. It is the intention of Mr. Bates to return to New York and complete the organization of a battery of flying artillery, toward which he has long had an eye. This is a branch of the service that needs strengthening, and is a department of military in which most brilliant success may be attained. That Mr. Bates is fitted for the position, I believe his actions will show.\n\nA little incident occurred a day or two since, that did my heart good. The chief actor on the occasion was Capt. Cowan, Company D, of the Fourteenth Regiment, well known as a former resident of Utica, and lately of Batavia. Capt. C. is a man below the medium height, with jet black hair and beard, bronzed complexion, thin and spare in flesh, but possessed of iron nerve and muscle. He was in the city, busily engaged getting some men discharged who had been pronounced by the Inspector unfit for military duty, and feeling the pangs of hunger, stepped into a restaurant for a lunch. There were several rough looking fellows inside, who eyed him fiercely when he entered. Not noticing them, however, the Captain took his seat at at a small table, directly opposite two or three of them, and quietly called for his lunch. He had hardly seated himself before the villains, who proved to be secessionists, commenced casting slurs upon the volunteer soldiers from the North, and especially insinuating against the officers. The Captain was accompanied by only one man, and he an invalid, and therefore the cowardly wretches were in their glory. He listened quietly but with boiling blood to the insulting language of the rascals, till at last, emboldened by the silence of Capt. C., one who sat across the table from him ventured on a personal insult. This was more than Capt. Cowan's Scotch blood could stand. Quick as thought he seized an earthern [sic] bottle that stood on the table, and rising from his seat, dealt the cowardly traitor such a stunning blow upon the forehead that the blood spattered out, and he fell to the floor senseless. The force of the blow shattered the heavy bottle, and left only the neck in Capt. C.'s hand. But quickly picking up another of the same sort, he stood at bay an instant, expecting the rest of the crew to attack him. It seemed, however, that their pluck was gone, for they paid not further heed to the Captain, but hurriedly ...is their demolished comrade. Perceiving this, Capt. C. quietly paid his bill, and walked off unmolested. A few lessons of this sort administered to secessionists in Washington would do much to quiet their treasonable utterances.\n\nThe Twenty-Sixth Regiment, Col. Christian, will, at the end of three months from the time it was sworn in, be disbanded. As many of the men are unwilling to be soldiers any longer, Col. C. is preparing to raise a new regiment for the war. Those who remain of his present regiment will form the nucleus of a new one.\n\nThe intelligence of the constant successes of our troops that arrives almost daily is received here with rejoicing, and a universal confidence prevails that our arms are destined to meet with unbroken success all through the campaign. Still, much impatience is manifested that the war is not pushed forward more rapidly. The action and temper of Congress are, as far as I have been, able to learn, received with unconditional approbation by Union men.\n\nCol. McQuade has been suffering lately from the effects of the fever with which he was prostrated before leaving Utica. He has fully recovered now, however, with the exception of a sore throat, and is engaged daily drilling the Regiment.\n\nAmong the many visitors to our camp, I was pleased to greet our friend Alvin White, of Utica. He came to visit his son, and see the land of the secessionists.\n\nThe city of Utica, I believe, is furnishing more officers than any place of its size in the Union. R. C. Enright, I have just learned, has been appointed Major in the Third New York Irish Regiment. The Regiment, mainly through the exertions of Roscoe Conkling, has been accepted, and will soon enter the service. Major Enright is posted in military matters, and will make an efficient officer.\n\nWashington is crowded with distinguished visitors.\n\nLetters to the Fourteenth will be received at Washington at present, and even after we cross the river into Virginia, they will be directed as heretofore until further notice. Yours for our country, D. F. R.\n\nTHE FOURTHEENTH REGIMENT.\n\nWillard's Hotel,\n\nWASHINGTON, JULY 19TH, 1861.\n\nTo the Editor of the Utica Morning Herald:\n\nWe are all excitement here. Every one is talking about the war news from Manassas Junction. Messengers have been coming in all day from the other side, bearing intelligence from Gen. McDowell's column. Before this will reach you, full particulars of the conflict will have been telegraphed. The news that our troops have after a prolonged and bloody fight, captured Manassas Junction, and that Beauregard has retreated, is received here with a stern sort of joy. We are told that four regiments of our brave fellows are cut to pieces—two New York, one Massachusetts and one Wisconsin, regiments.—This is sad indeed, and it stirs one's heart terribly to think that so many noble hearts should be stilled by the dastardly rebels. The stories say that our men fought like lions till the day was theirs, and the glorious Stars and Stripes waved over the late stronghold of the secessionists. But the slaughter has been immense. Among the troops quartered here there prevails the strongest desire to listen over and join their brothers in arms. The general opinion here is, that the troops will be pushed directly on to Richmond, and that Virginia will soon be cleared of rebel troops.\n\nSince writing the above, I have learned that the stories relative to the capture of Manassas, are not entirely reliable. Undoubted authority, (the War Department) says, however, that there has been a signal victory achieved at Bull's Run, and that the taking of Manassas is expected within a few hours.\n\nIn the 14th there has been considerable excitement for a few days. We have been hourly expecting marching orders, the Colonel having been instructed to hold his Regiment in readiness for any emergency. This morning a fine band came from Batavia, and has joined the Regiment. It was procured by the efforts of Capt. Cowan, and will add immensely to the spirit, style, and spunk of the 14th. Yesterday the U. S. Paymaster commenced paying off the regiment. He paid companies A, B, and C, and the Staff; and to-morrow will finish the rest.\n\nAnother good bit of news for you is that we are to have the Enfield rifle. The regiment will be supplied from the lot of 5,000 which left New York city yesterday. I need not assure you that the men are willing enough to make the exchange, although target practice has shown the old musket to be more reliable than it was supposed to be. It is suspected that very soon after our new rifles are received we will have orders to march.\n\nThe provision panic has pretty much frittered itself away, notwithstanding severe efforts to keep it up by evil disposed persons. The men have had not only the regular army allowance of rations, but quite a number of extras; such as salt herrings, codfish, onions, and split peas, which are not included in the regular ration. While some regiments here in Washington have been put off with hard biscuit five or six days in succession, we have only had one day's ration of it, and we have had fresh meat every other day nearly all the time since we have been here. The truth is, most of the trouble has been caused by a few individuals who have an especial talent for making trouble. I learn through private letters that some of those sick persons who have returned home are circulating reports corroborating the lies that have been told concerning our late Quartermaster. All statements to the effect that he has not performed his duty while in that position are false. The regiment fared as well under his care as it could possible have fared, unless under the charge of an old hand at the business, I do not known of a single instance when he failed to act fully up to his duty, unless prevented by the lack of stores in the government warehouses.\n\nMr. Brodhead has entered upon the discharge of his duties, but it will take several days for him to get fairly worked into the harness.\n\nThe health of the Regiment is good. For over a week we have had most delightful weather. The air has been cooled by frequent showers, and the sun has moderated his fierce heat so much that it is not unpleasant to go out at midday.\n\nYours for our country,\n\nD. F. R.\n\nUtica Morning Herald\n\nAND DAILY GAZETTE.\n\nTHE FOURTEENTH REGIMENT.\n\nARLINGTON HEIGHTS, Va.,\n\nJuly 27, 1861.\n\nTo the Editor of the Utica Morning Herald:\n\nAgain we have pitched our tents. This time our tent-pins are driven into the \"sacred soil\" of Virginia, and there I think they will stick until every rebel tent-pin is withdrawn from the territory of the Old Dominion. We are encamped not far from Fort Corcoran, on Arlington Heights. All about us the hand of the engineer has been busy fortifying the Heights that overlook Washington, completely commanding the city. Forts have been built, breastworks thrown up, and cannon planted on every commanding spot. Forests have been leveled wherever they obstructed the range of batteries, and roads cut in every direction to facilitate the movement of troops. And the labor is still going on. Night and day regiments of men are toiling with the ax, pick and spade. In one night this week our men cleared several acres on timber land. It is intended that Arlington Heights shall be made impregnable, for were they once gained by our enemy, Washington would be lost. I have no idea, however, that they will ever be attacked by the rebels, and if they were, it would be a miracle if they should succeed in taking them. Our camp is in the midst of a peach orchard, not more than a hundred rods from Gen. Lee's former residence, which is situated still farther up the hill, and commands a fine view of Georgetown, Washington, the Potomac and surrounding country. Col. McQuade is placed in command of the ferry and aqueduct across the Potomac from Georgetown to Arlington Heights. A strong guard of our men watch there both night and day, and no person is allowed to cross unless provided with a pass from Gens. Sherman or Mansfield. In some respects our camp is pleasanter than the former one, while in others it is not so agreeable. Here, the position is nearer the scene of action, consequently more exciting, but the ground itself is not so good, although the view is magnificent. The water in our old camp was excellent, here, it is execrable. The men are feeling amazingly well, and scarcely one is in the hospital. They have treble the labor to perform that they had in Washington, but do not murmur. The regiment, I am glad to say, is gaining a good name here, and is in reality becoming thoroughly efficient in all the duties of soldiery. I believe when the Fourteenth is called upon to meet the rebels face to face, they will prove fearless and true.—Wednesday, the remainder of the regiment were paid off. They received $16 50 per man up to the first of July. Out of this amount some of the companies have sent home five and six hundred dollars each. Companies A and B have fitted themselves out with leather leggins and Zouave caps, red and tasselled. It gives them a very fierce and warlike look, and I have no doubt adds to the fierceness of their spirit.\n\nI have heard many stories of the late fight from men who were engaged in it—from members of the 79th, 13th New York, 69th, Wisconsin 2d, and others. They all indicate that had the skill of the officers been equal to the courage and endurance of the men, the record of July 21st, 1861, would have been far different. And even as the battle resulted, it was a victory for the federal troops but for the panic. Our running away was a phenomenon that surprised the rebels far more than the terrible execution of our guns.—They are, judging from all statements, both of their own and our side, the worst whipped of the two, and had the ground that was so valiantly gained been held, as it might have been very easily, it would have been accorded as a brilliant but very natural result of the prowess of our arms. Now, we have the same ground to win over again. The noble blood that has been spilled so freely, the deeds of daring performed, not by individuals alone, but by whole regiments of men. … are they, through the inefficiency of other men, rendered of no avail? I believe the blood has not been spilled in vain, nor the deeds of daring wrought for naught. Although a portion of our army was seized with that ghastly fear that constitutes a panic, they are not defeated. They are only foiled for a time in their purpose, which will only make them more determined when they next undertake to accomplish it. Pages might be written about the incidents of the fight, in which our men maintained the name of Americans, reckless in courage as they are in all else, yet cool, collected and steady, as if merely driving a bargain—till the panic came, then wild and unreasonable as any crowd that ever \"run\" a bank. Every day diminishes the number of our loss as the stragglers come in. I do not think our total loss will exceed six hundred, while according to the statements of Southern papers their own loss is over a thousand.\n\nA large number of prisoners are quartered here, and—would you believe it?—they are daily risked by friends here in Washington, who furnish them with all kinds of delicacies, condole with them and cheer them in every possible way. These cursed rebels are prominent here, and have been heard to utter their treasonable wishes, before this battle gave them an opportunity to openly manifest their sympathy with secession by thus comforting and cheering their rebel brethren. Kindness shown to prisoners I do not condemn in itself, but when the spirit that prompts these persons to carry wine, champagne and delicacies of all sorts to these rebel prisoners, and to refuse a cup of water to a federal soldier, is known to be a spirit of sympathy with the rebellion, then these acts become treason, and in my opinion should be treated as such. Secessionists flourish in rank profusion right here in the Capital. Hang them, say I. Government thinks differently, and feeds them out of its own crib.\n\nActive preparations are going on for a more determined renewal of the war. Many troops arrive daily. McClellan and his body guard, a noble set of fellows, are in Washington. The utmost confidence is placed in McClellan. Yours for the country, D. F. R.\n\nTHE FOURTEENTH REGIMENT.\n\nARLINGTON HEIGHTS, VA.,\n\nAugust 2d, 1861.\n\nTo the Editor of the Utica Morning Herald:\n\nNotwithstanding everything is quiet here in Washington, no advance movements being made just now, and our camp lying quietly and without fear of molestation on the banks of the Potomac, items enough transpire daily to make even a larger column than that devoted to matters of local interest to the readers of the HERALD. I shall not encroach upon your crowded columns so much as to make an attempt to mention all these interesting little bits of news, but I will endeavor to give all who feel interested in our welfare, a general idea of how we feel, how we look, what we do, what we see, where we go, what for, and will not forget that you are all anxious to have at least a rational word from me occasionally, As no active campaigning is going on, our life is bereft somewhat of the stern aspect which characterized it when we first came across the river. Still the strictest military discipline is maintained in camp, as in fact every camp in the army of the Potomac is subjected to a stricter discipline since Gen. McClellan took command of it. Col. McQuade is still guarding the Aqueduct and the Ferries between Georgetown and Arlington Heights. The most rigid rules are observed concerning passes, and the good effect of such a course is manifest in the rapid dwindling of the crowd of officers and men that before hung about Willard's Hotel, and other public places in Washington. One hundred men are detailed for guard duty daily in our regiment.—There are several principal stations, designated as the aqueduct; the two ferries; the tunnel, a place where the Fairfax road is cut down through the rocks and passes under the canal a few rods from the aqueduct across the Potomac; the redoubt named Fort McQuade, commanding the rear of Fort Corcoran and the road leading to Alexandria; and \"the island.\" The latter post is a small body of land surrounded by the waters of the Potomac, and connected with the Virginia side by an earth and stone bridge several hundred feet long. It is situated directly opposite Georgetown, and forms the western landing place of the ferries. Being so easy of access from the Washington side, it is closely guarded to prevent the lauding of spies or Secessionists. Never having accurately described our camp, I will endeavor to give you some idea of our situation. We are located about halt a mile from the Potomac, half way up the slope that is called Arlington Heights. The river is not more than a quarter of a mile wide here, and on the opposite side from us, on a corresponding slope, is built the village of Georgetown. Standing within our lines and facing the river, revealed at intervals between the intervening forests and hills for several miles below, a floe view is afforded of Georgetown and Washington and the surroundings. Far down the Potomac on the right, so distant that it seems to rest on the surface of the water, stretches like a black thread across the river, the Long Bridge. Away beyond it, and scarcely distinguishable against the dim background of blue hills, can be seen the dark walls and towers of the Government Lunatic Asylum. Conspicuous in front looms the Capitol, with its unfinished rotunda, while like a ghostly sentinel stands on the right of it, the white, square pile of marble, also unfinished, called Washington Monument. A little to the left and nearer the eye, rests on an eminence the Observatory, only its round white roof being visible among the trees that entirely surround it. On this side of the eminence, earthworks are being thrown up which command our position and all parts of Arlington Heights. Still farther to the left extend the streets and residences of Washington. On the extreme left wind the banks of the Potomac, and rests the village of Georgetown. The view on the left is limited by woods and hills to a distance of not more than two miles. As Georgetown and Washington are closely joined, the only distinguishing line of separation being a small creek that runs between and empties into the Potomac, the view in the night is also an interesting one. From the front of my tent I can look out and behold from Georgetown on the left, and in front, for several miles far to the extreme right of the Capital, the darkness thickly gemmed with lights. When the nights are moonlit, the scene is enchanting.\n\nThen the distant walls, roofs, steeples and towers are softly revealed by the quiet moonbeams, the Potomac is smoothly silvered as a sweep of light, while in the background, vague, shadowy and indistinct, lie the dark, wood crowned hills of Maryland. On almost every side of us in our immediate vicinity, the view is met with wastes of fallen forests, the leaves of the prostrate trees withered and dry. Before the war, Arlington Heights was almost entirely covered with woods, but now the axes of the pioneers have made sad havoc with the Virginia oaks, and they lie strewn desolately everywhere. On the crest of the hill, immediately in rear of our camp is Fort Corcoran, which, although now apparently impregnable, is being strengthened every day.—Huge logs are hauled by our camp constantly, and taken up to the Fort to be added to some part of its works.\n\n... have charactered the members of the 14th, both officers and men, they have now the fullest confidence of Gen. Sherman, and. from him have received the very strongest expressions of satisfaction and approbation. I will for a moment consider myself an outsider while I repeat some of the compliments of which Col. McQuade and his regiment have been made the recipients.—Gen. Sherman says the 14th is the best regiment, and it has performed its duty in guarding the ferries, etc., better than any other regiment that had been under his command. And this afternoon, while the regiment was going through dress parade, who should ride up, unexpected and unannounced, but Gen. McClellan himself, with his staff and body guard. He reviewed the regiment and pronounced it the best he had seen. He said to Col. McQuade that they went through all the forms, and looked better than any other, and expressed himself delighted with the drill. This compliment, coming from so strict a disciplinarian and such a thorough soldier as Gen. McClellan, besides taking the regiment by surprise, is really worth a great deal. Gen. McClellan is an earnest, energetic appearing man, apparently about thirty-five. He inspires confidence wherever he goes, and in whomever he approaches. A Division Court-Martial for Gen. McClellan's command has been summoned and commenced to-day. It is held at the head quarters of Brig.-Gen. Richardson, at Fort Albany, about two miles from here on the Alexandria road. The body is composed of twenty Colonels, chosen from the Division, and of this body Colonel McQuade has been made President. I am informed that the court martial will have business sufficient to employ them steadily two or three weeks.\n\nSince there is a probability of our remaining here some time, the camp is gradually becoming thoroughly fitted up. The Hospital is pleasantly, neatly and comfortably arranged. Our surgeons attend closely to the needs of their department, while under the immediate supervision of John B. McQuade, Hospital Steward, and R. L. Dryer, Ward Master, the invalid occupants of the Hospital, have no want compatible with camp life which is not fully met and supplied. We have lately received an addition to our medical corps, by the coming of Edwin Hutchinson, of Utica. He acts in the capacity of volunteer Assistant Surgeon, and will, I am confident, labor efficiently in his important department of the good cause. From the hospital stores supplied by friendly hands, the sick, of whom there are very few now in our regiment, are furnished with nice sheets and clean cotton and linen underclothes to sleep in. No one can appreciate these comforts as thoroughly as a sick soldier, and I'll warrant many a silent prayer is offered from hospital beds for those whose kindly care was ministered to the wants of the sick and wounded soldier.\n\nWe have even a barbershop among us, kept by Mr. Wm. Roper, of Company A. He occupies a tent, wherein is placed an impromptu but very easy chair, manufactured from rough boards and cushioned with a blanket. Here the weary soldiers may recline, close their eyes, and as the soothing, creamy lather mesmerizes their tired senses, limbering the raspy beard till it is ready for the swath, and solacing the nasal organ with its unctuous smell, they may fly on the wings of fancy to the odoriferous bowers at Batchelor Brothers, and imagine themselves there at peace with all men, especially the barber. On account of the war and the hard times, Mr. Roper charges only five cents a shave, and will cut your hair so close you can see the grain, just for the fun of the thing—and ten cents.\n\nNight before last, two hundred of our men, in connection with two or three hundred others, went out on a scouting expedition. Owing to a failure in the plan, the expedition failed in it object. It was commanded by Gen. Sherman, and had it not been for some premature firing, probably a large number of secession prisoners would have been taken.\n\nOur new Quartermaster, Mr. Brodhead, is working hard in his department, and gives general satisfaction. No one can take a deeper interest in the welfare of the regiment than he, nor labor more assiduously for its benefit.\n\nA most interesting feature of our camp is the music. It is impossible to imagine what enchantment it lends to the evenings to hear ringing out on the starlit air from a full chorus of such voices as we have here, the old familiar airs and songs of home. I venture to assert that no common band of musicians can surpass our amateur club of vocalists, among whom are many names well known in the musical circles of Utica. Serenades are not unfrequent, and they are carried through in regular style, the inmates of the tent rising and inviting the troubadours to partake of such refreshment as may be afforded. In return the musical revelers [sic] of the night join their voices in harmony, and now in glee, now in plaintive melody, patriotic hymns, or rich swelling choruses, fill the air with music, and carry one back on the wings of song to live over again the days and nights of the past, that furnish to the stern present some of its sweetest, dearest recollections. Nowhere can music fulfill its mission better than on the \"tented field,\" in the midst of the rud"
