        "text": "Military sociologists Woodward & Jenkings wrote a book about their research on 40 years of British military memoirs (1980-present), from a sociological perspective. I wrote this review both as a fellow military memoir researcher and as a soldier-author myself. \"Bringing war to book\" is a must-read introduction for every student and researcher who starts studying military memoirs or the military-industrial-media-entertainment network (MIME-NET), as it deals with all the main aspects of military books, from censorship to writing motives and from truth claims to covers. However, the informal writing style makes it a book that will also appeal to the layman (both readers and writers) interested in knowing more about (UK) military non-fiction.\n\nThis chapter provides an overview of the development of “New military history,” a general term for the broadening – in subject, approaches and methods – of the traditional, narrow operational military historiography. It first deals with the influence of the social, cultural, gender, and global “turns” in general historiography on military historiography. Next, the benefits and possibilities of these new perspectives in military historiography are analyzed, followed by the risks and potential dangers. Finally, the question of what the core of military history should be is discussed and an attempt is made to describe a “comprehensive approach” to analyze military action taken in the past, with a multifaceted “plan of attack” with several possible “axes of attack.” “New” military historians who use a comprehensive approach are best placed to explain how the course of military action has influenced the general course of history and thereby can make a full-fledged contribution to general...\n\nThe Iraq War has been the costliest U.S. conflict since the Vietnam War. To date, few official studies have been conducted to review what happened, why it happened, and what lessons should be drawn. The U.S. Army in the Iraq War is the Army’s initial operational level analysis of this conflict, written in narrative format, with assessments and lessons embedded throughout the work. This study reviews the conflict from a Landpower perspective and includes the contributions of coalition allies, the U.S. Marine Corps, and special operations forces. Presented principally from the point of view of the commanders in Baghdad, the narrative examines the interaction of the operational and strategic levels, as well as the creation of theater level strategy and its implementation at the tactical level. Volume 1 begins in the truce tent at Safwan Airfield in southern Iraq at the end of Operation DESERT STORM and briefly examines actions by U.S. and Iraqi forces during the interwar years. The narrative continues by examining the road to war, the initially successful invasion, and the rise of Iraqi insurgent groups before exploring the country’s slide toward civil war. This volume concludes with a review of the decision by the George W. Bush administration to “surge” additional forces to Iraq, placing the conduct of the “surge” and its aftermath in the second volume."
