        "text": "The Almighty (全知全能 (ジ・オールマイティ), Ji Ōrumaiti; Japanese for \"All-Knowing and All-Powerful\") is an ability used by Yhwach and Jugram Haschwalth that allows one to perceive and potentially alter the future.[1] According to Yhwach, The Almighty is proof of a \"true Quincy\".[2]\n\nYhwach and Haschwalth share The Almighty, with Yhwach having it during the day and Haschwalth possessing it at night after Yhwach falls asleep.[3]\n\nDescription[]\n\nWhen a Quincy such as Yhwach or Jugram Haschwalth activates The Almighty, their irises and pupils split in two.[4][5] After Yhwach was sealed away, it took 900 years for his heart to begin beating once more, 90 years for him to regain awareness, and 9 years for him to regain his power. If he were to open his eyes before those final 9 years had fully elapsed, he may have been unable to fully control his power and accidentally stolen all of the power from his loyal Sternritter. With this power's activation, Yhwach achieves his full strength.[6] Yhwach gains an additional pupil in each eye after nullifying Ichibē Hyōsube's Futen Taisatsuryō.[7]\n\nOmni-Precognition: With The Almighty, Quincy such as Yhwach and Haschwalth can see everything that is to occur from the present moment into the far-flung future. They can \"know\" everything that lies within that gaze.[8] Rather than seeing a linear future, Yhwach observes all possible futures at once like countless grains of sand in the wind, and can thus act accordingly using the knowledge he has gained to anticipate and counter his opponents.[9]\n\nFuture Acausality: Yhwach states that the true power of The Almighty is the ability to alter the future into whatever outcome he desires.[10] He utilizes this power by setting up traps where he knows his opponents will be[11] and preemptively attacking them before they realize. He can also outmaneuver any defense and countermeasure they use to protect themselves in order to facilitate his attacks.[12] He can even rewrite his own death.[13] However, only Yhwach can use this aspect of The Almighty, not Haschwalth.[14]\n\nConnection to the Soul King: While possessing The Almighty, Yhwach can see the Soul King's humiliation in the Soul King Palace, as well as his father's state as a mindless and hideous lump of flesh to be worshipped.[15]\n\nWeaknesses[]\n\nPower-swapping: The Almighty switches between Yhwach and Haschwalth, but it is significantly weaker while it is in the possession of Haschwalth. Haschwalth cannot change the future with The Almighty.[14] According to Bazz-B, killing Haschwalth while he has The Almighty will also destroy The Almighty.[16]\n\nSoul King: The Soul King, as well as his body parts such as Mimihagi, are immune to the precognitive abilities of The Almighty, which keeps them from appearing in any of Yhwach's visions, even when they are in the same room in the future.[17] The Soul King's left arm was also capable of sealing away The Almighty when used by Ichibē Hyōsube.[15]\n\nIllusions: Powerful illusions such as the ones created by Sōsuke Aizen's Kyōka Suigetsu can fool the precognition of The Almighty.[18]\n\nPast manipulation: The Almighty can alter the future but it is susceptible to abilities that alter the past. After Yhwach rewrote the future so that Tensa Zangetsu is broken, Shūkurō Tsukishima uses his Book of the End to rewrite the blade's past, allowing it to be fixed.[19] Jugram Haschwalth speculates that Uryū Ishida's Antithesis is capable of countering The Almighty because it switches events that have already happened between two targets.[20]\n\nStill Silver: If Yhwach's blood makes contact with the silver created in the hearts of his Auswählen victims, The Almighty is temporarily disabled.[21]\n\nKnown Users[]\n\nYhwach\n\nJugram Haschwalth\n\nTrivia[]\n\nWhen Jugram Haschwalth activates The Almighty, his green-colored irises become red, like those of Yhwach.[22]\n\nAppearances in Other Media[]\n\nIn Ryōgo Narita's novel Bleach: Can't Fear Your Own World, the The Almighty is revealed to originally be the Soul King's signature power, which Yhwach inherited due to being the King's son.
