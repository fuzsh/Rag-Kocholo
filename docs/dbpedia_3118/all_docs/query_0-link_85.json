        "text": "The Pentagon has announced that the U.S. will move a fighter jet squadron to the Middle East and maintain an aircraft carrier in the region. The announcement was made Friday, a day after United States President Joe Biden said he's ''very concerned'' that the violence in the Middle East could escalate, adding that the killing of a top Hamas leader in Iran has ''not helped'' efforts to negotiate a cease-fire in the Israel-Hamas war.\n\nBy The Associated Press\n\nAssociated Press\n\nAugust 3, 2024 at 3:44AM\n\nJAKARTA, Indonesia — Thousands of pro-Palestinian protesters marched Saturday to the heavily guarded United States Embassy in Indonesia's capital to protest the killing of Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh.\n\nWaving giant Indonesian and Palestinian flags and holding posters with Haniyeh's picture and signs that read ''Martyr Haniyeh'' and ''Murderer Israel get out of Palestine,'' thousands of noisy demonstrators gathered along a major street in Jakarta that runs outside the embassy.\n\nMore than 1,300 police were deployed around the compound, which is blocked off by concrete road separators and razor wire. The protest halted traffic along the way.\n\nIndonesia, the world's most populous Muslim majority nation, does not have formal diplomatic relations with Israel and there is not an Israeli Embassy in the country.\n\nProtesters, organized by Indonesian People's Alliance Defends Palestine group, chanted ''God is Great'' and ''Freedom for Palestine'' as they marched. Their banners and placards slammed the siege in Gaza and denounced America's staunch support of Israel.\n\nIndonesia has long been a strong supporter of Palestinians and President Joko Widodo has condemned the assassination of Haniyeh.\n\n''It was an intolerable murder that took place on Iran's sovereign territory,'' Widodo told reporters Thursday. ''I think everyone, including Indonesia, strongly condemns such violence and killings.''\n\nThe US will boost military presence in Mideast, sending fighter jet squadron and keeping carrier there\n\nThe United States Defense Department will move a fighter jet squadron to the Middle East and maintain an aircraft carrier in the region, the Pentagon said Friday, as President Joe Biden made good on his promise to beef up the American military presence to help defend Israel from possible attacks by Iran and its proxies and safeguard U.S. troops.\n\nIn a statement, the department said Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin also ordered additional ballistic missile defense-capable cruisers and destroyers to the European and Middle East regions and is taking steps to send more land-based ballistic missile defense weapons there.\n\nThe shifts come as U.S. leaders worry about escalating violence in the Middle East in response to recent attacks by Israel on Hamas and Hezbollah leaders, which triggered threats of retaliation.\n\nUS Defense Secretary to direct forces to provide additional support to Israel and increase American troop protection in region\n\nWASHINGTON — Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin ''will be directing multiple'' force movements to provide additional support to Israel and increase protection for American troops in the region, Pentagon spokesperson Sabrina Singh said Friday. She said final decisions have not yet been made.\n\nSingh said it could involve deploying additional military units ''with additional capabilities that … would need to be operated by additional people.'' She declined to provide details, but an array of defensive measures, from additional ships and fighter aircraft units to added air defense systems, would involve more troops.\n\nShe said she's not aware of any United States military units being ordered to prepare to deploy as yet.\n\nThe U.S. continues to have a number of warships in the eastern Mediterranean Sea, including two Navy destroyers, the USS Roosevelt and the USS Bulkeley, as well as the USS Wasp and the USS New York.\n\nThe Wasp and the New York are part of the amphibious ready group and carry a Marine expeditionary unit that could be used if any evacuation of U.S. personnel is required.\n\nIn addition, a U.S. official said that two U.S Navy destroyers that are currently in the Middle East will be heading north up the Red Sea toward the Mediterranean Sea. At least one of those could linger in the Mediterranean if needed. The official spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss troop movements.\n\nPalestinians in Gaza rely on makeshift charity kitchens for survival as they struggle to access to food and water\n\nDEIR al-BALAH, Gaza Strip — Palestinians in Gaza are still struggling to have proper access to food and clean water amid Israel's ongoing war against Hamas, which has restricted the entry of much needed aid.\n\nFamilies heavily rely on makeshift charity kitchens for survival, lining up for several hours in excruciating heat to get their main meal of the day of rice, with chicken provided once a week.\n\nAbu Hamzah, who runs a small charity kitchen set up in Deir al-Balah, told the Associated Press that between 8,000 and 10,000 displaced people benefit from his charity kitchen.\n\nFootage by the Associated Press shows the inside of a makeshift shelter where Abu Hamzah helps give meals.\n\n''Life is hard. There is no income. We come to the charity kitchen and stand 4 to 5 hours waiting our turn during the day every day in the sun,'' Um Yehia Shaheen, a woman displaced with seven family members from Gaza City, told the AP.\n\nWater access is also strained after water wells across the enclave were destroyed in Israeli airstrikes. Palestinians in Deir al-Balah line up for hours to fill up their bottles or jerry cans from water barrels.\n\n''There is no life here. We're not living. Donkeys in Gaza used to live a better life than the one we are living now,'' Mohamed Hanounah, a man displaced from Gaza City, told AP.\n\nIsraeli police detain top imam at Al-Aqsa mosque over Haniyeh comments\n\nJERUSALEM — Israeli police have detained the top imam at the revered Al-Aqsa compound in Jerusalem's Old City for comments he made during a Friday sermon mourning the death of top Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh.\n\nHaniyeh was assassinated earlier in the week in Tehran in an attack that many have pinned on Israel. On Friday, Israeli police said they brought Sheikh Ekrima Sabri in for questioning after his address during midday prayers mentioned Haniyeh by name, mourning his death and asking ''God Almighty to have mercy on him and to grant him a place in his spacious gardens.''\n\nThe police said they are now investigating Sabri for incitement. They said the state has previously filed an indictment against Sabri on the same charge, one of 140 indictments for incitement in the Jerusalem area — including several other imams. Throughout the war, Israel has cracked down on Palestinian free speech, rights groups say, arresting them for speech deemed by Israeli authorities to be incendiary.\n\nLebanese village mourns Syrian family killed in Israeli strike\n\nBEIRUT — Dozens of people gathered Friday in the village of Chamaa in southern Lebanon to mourn a Syrian refugee family killed in an Israeli strike that hit their house the day before.\n\nThe Lebanese health ministry said five Lebanese citizens were also injured in the strike, which killed a Syrian widow and her three sons — two children and one young adult. The Israeli military did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nHaidar Haidar, the oldest son's employer in a factory for construction materials, said the family was originally from Idlib in northern Syria.\n\n''They are people who escaped war in Syria and they met their fate here,'' he said.\n\nSince October, the Lebanese militant group Hezbollah and Israeli forces have exchanged strikes near-daily over the Lebanon-Israel border, killing more than 500 people in Lebanon — including about 100 civilians — and 22 soldiers and 25 civilians in Israel. They include 12 children and teenagers killed by a missile that hit a soccer field in the town of Majdal Shams in the Israeli-annexed Golan Heights on Saturday.\n\nIsrael blamed Hezbollah for the strike; Hezbollah denied responsibility. Days later, Israel killed a top Hezbollah commander in a rare strike in Beirut for which Hezbollah has vowed to retaliate, triggering fears that the conflict could spiral out of control.\n\nFrench minister seeks greater security for Jewish communities as tensions escalate\n\nPARIS — France's Interior Minister Gerald Darmanin on Friday called for increased security measures to protect Jewish communities across the country amid escalating tensions in the Middle East. ''The risk of action is real,'' Darmanin said in a note to national and local law enforcement agencies.\n\nHe requested greater security around places frequented by Jewish people in France, particularly places of worship and other gatherings for religious services.\n\nDarmanin specifically mentioned the ''many Israeli citizens'' in France at the time of the Paris Olympics in need of protection as tensions flare up following the assassination of top Hamas and Hezbollah leaders in Tehran and in Beirut.\n\nIsrael protests after Turkey lowers embassy flag for Haniyeh\n\nJERUSALEM — Israel has summoned Turkey's deputy ambassador for a ''severe reprimand'' after the Turkish embassy in Tel Aviv lowered its flag to half-staff in a sign of mourning for Hamas' political leader Ismail Haniyeh, the Israeli foreign minister announced.\n\nIsrael Katz said on X that his country would not tolerate expressions of mourning for a ''murderer like Ismail Haniyeh, who led Hamas in committing the atrocities on October 7th and prayed with his associates, wishing success to the murderers.''\n\nTurkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan announced a national day of mourning for Friday, mandating that flags around the country and at overseas diplomatic missions be lowered to half-staff in honor of Haniyeh. Funeral prayers were being held at mosques around country as well as Istanbul's famed Haghia Sophia.\n\nKatz said: ''If the embassy representatives wish to mourn, they should go to Turkey and mourn alongside their master, Erdogan, who embraces the terrorist organization Hamas and supports its acts of murder and terror.''\n\nTurkey's Foreign Ministry spokesperson Oncu Keceli responded to Katz on X, saying Israel would not be able to achieve peace ''by killing negotiators and threatening diplomats.''\n\nTurkey does not view Hamas as a terrorist organization and has describes it as a ''liberation movement.''\n\nIsrael investigates imam at Al-Aqsa Mosque over Haniyeh comments\n\nJERUSALEM — Israeli police are investigating comments made Friday by the imam at Al-Aqsa Mosque in the Old City of Jerusalem mourning top Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh during prayers Friday.\n\nHaniyeh was assassinated in Tehran earlier this week in an attack that Iran pinned on Israel. On Friday, Sheikh Ekrima Sabri, the former mufti of Jerusalem and the Palestinian territories, said, ''the people of Jerusalem and the environs of Jerusalem from the pulpit of the blessed Al-Aqsa Mosque mourn the martyr Ismail Haniyeh. We ask God Almighty to have mercy on him and to grant him a place in His spacious gardens.'' Sabri also led a funeral prayer in absentia for Haniyeh.\n\nFollowing the sermon, Israeli police said that they were probing whether the statement constituted incitement. They pledged to ''act based on the findings.'' Since the start of the war, Palestinians have been arrested, fired by Israeli employers and expelled from Israeli schools for online speech deemed incendiary by Israeli authorities, rights groups say.\n\nRoughly 30,000 attended prayers Friday, according to the Waqf, the Jordanian-based Muslim religious body that takes care of the Al-Aqsa site. Police banned hundreds of young men from entering the sensitive compound ahead of prayers, a common practice since Oct. 7.\n\nCyprus prepares to help people evacuate from the Middle East in case the Israel-Hamas war expands\n\nNICOSIA, Cyprus — Cyprus' foreign minister says authorities are in touch with the diplomatic missions of nations that may opt to evacuate their citizens through the east Mediterranean island nation if the Israeli-Hamas war expands to engulf neighboring countries.\n\nMinister Constantinos Kombos said Friday agencies have been mobilized as part of the country's long-standing evacuation action plan called ESTIA. He said there's a ''serious danger'' of conflict expanding further, which would affect the entire region.\n\nKombos said Cyprus' role is to ''operate as a bridge of safety'' in the region in the event of mass evacuations of third-country citizens from the Middle East.\n\nIn 2023, Cyprus acted as a waystation for third-country evacuees from Sudan and Israel after the start of the Israel-Hamas war. The island nation also helped in the evacuation of tens of thousands of third-country nationals during the 2006 Israel-Hezbollah conflict.\n\nAn Australian inquiry blames Israeli military failings for a fatal drone attack on a Gaza aid convoy\n\nMELBOURNE, Australia — An Australian investigation has found the Israeli military's attack on an aid convoy in Gaza that killed seven people resulted from serious failures of defense procedures, mistaken identification, and bad decisions.\n\nSuch prayers are held when the body of any person is from the country.\n\nSharif in his televised remarks Friday said he will also attend a special funeral service for Haniyeh at a mosque at his sprawling office in the capital, Islamabad.\n\nHe denounced the killing of the Hamas leader in his brief remarks shortly before Pakistan's parliament approved a resolution to express solidarity with the Palestinian people. The resolution also called for an immediate cease-fire in Gaza and denounced the killing of the Hamas leader.\n\nUS President Biden is ‘very concerned' that violence in the Mideast could escalate\n\nJOINT BASE ANDREWS, Maryland — President Joe Biden said late Thursday he's ''very concerned'' that the violence in the Middle East could escalate, adding that the killing of a top Hamas leader in Iran has ''not helped'' efforts to negotiate a cease-fire in Israel's war with Gaza.\n\nBiden said he'd had a ''very direct'' conversation with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu earlier in the day, repeating ''very direct'' for emphasis.\n\nHe added: ''We have the basis for a cease-fire. He should move on it and they should move on it now.''\n\nBiden spoke on the tarmac of an air base outside Washington after welcoming back to the United States three Americans who were freed in a prisoner swap earlier in the day.\n\nMore from Nation\n\nSee More\n\nThe trial of a Las Vegas-area politician accused of killing an investigative reporter who wrote articles critical of him began Monday, after the judge denied the defendant's last request to dismiss the case and jury selection began.\n\nNation\n\nFormer Colorado clerk Tina Peters, hero to election deniers, convicted in election computer breach\n\nNation\n\nQuake felt from LA to San Diego, swaying buildings and knocking items off shelves but no big damage\n\nThe trial of a Las Vegas-area politician accused of killing an investigative reporter who wrote articles critical of him began Monday, after the judge denied the defendant's last request to dismiss the case and jury selection began.\n\nNation\n\nFormer Colorado clerk Tina Peters, hero to election deniers, convicted in election computer breach\n\nNation\n\nQuake felt from LA to San Diego, swaying buildings and knocking items off shelves but no big damage"
