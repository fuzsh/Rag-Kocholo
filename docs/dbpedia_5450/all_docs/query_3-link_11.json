It means white or fair, the Irish name Fíona means vine. It was coined by Scottish writer William Sharp. Sharp may have drawn inspiration from Celtic variations of the name Catherine. Initially, the name was confined to Scotland but later it gained popularity in other countries, such as Liechtenstein, Switzerland, Australia, Germany and Canada.\n\nEtymology\n\n[edit]\n\nFiona originates from the Gaelic word fionn, meaning white or fair, being a Latinised form; or an Anglicisation of the Irish name Fíona meaning vine.[1] In ninth-century Welsh and Breton language Fion (today: ffion) referred to the foxglove species and is also a female given name as in Ffion Hague.[3]\n\nIt was coined by the Scottish writer William Sharp under the pseudonym Fiona Macleod. Sharp may have drawn inspiration from Celtic variations of the name Catherine.[4] Fiona carries connotations of gentility and refinement, often suggesting aristocratic lineage for its bearer.[5] The name is commonly shortened to Fi, with other variations including Fina, Fee, and Tiona.[6]\n\nVariations of the name Fiona include Gwenn in Breton, Gwen and Wynne in Welsh. Masculine forms include Fion, Fionn, Finnán, Finnén, Finn, Gwyn and Wyn.[7] The Scottish Gaelic feminine name Fionnghal is also sometimes equated with Fiona.[8]\n\nPopularity\n\n[edit]\n\nInitially, the name remained largely confined to Scotland until the latter part of the 20th century when it gained popularity in Britain, Australia, and Canada.[9] Additionally, the Ossianic poems of James Macpherson helped to familiarize the name in the English-speaking world. It experienced a surge in popularity during the latter half of the 1960s.\n\nFiona was the 71st most popular name for baby girls born in 2023 in Germany.[10] It was the 439th most popular female name in Scotland in 2023.[11] The name was the most common female name in the ranking of most popular names for baby girls born in Liechtenstein in 2022.[12] In 2022, in Switzerland, Fiona was the 57th most popular name.[13] In Australia it is the 138th most popular baby names since the 1930s.[14] In New Zealand it was particularly popular during the 1960s until around 1980.[15] In Canada, it was the 287th most popular baby girl name, ranking in 287th.[16] In the US the most girls named Fiona were born in the 21h century and the number of Fionas born per year was greater than 1,000 from 2009 until 2021.[17] It has ranked among the top 1,000 most popular names for girls since 1990 and among the top 500 since 1999.[18] The name Fiona has been particularly popular for girls of Asian or Pacific Islander descent in New York City, where Fiona ranked as the ninth most popular name for girls from those groups in 2007.[19]\n\nNotable people with the given name\n\n[edit]\n\nFiona, hippopotamus born at the Cincinnati Zoo and Botanical Garden\n\nFiona Adams, British photographer\n\nFiona Allen, English comedian and actress\n\nFiona Alpass, New Zealand academic\n\nFiona Apple, American singer\n\nFiona Baan, Scottish-born American sports administrator\n\nFiona Balfour, Australian business executive\n\nFiona Bloom, publicist\n\nFiona Bruce, BBC presenter\n\nFiona Button, English actress\n\nFiona Campbell, several people\n\nFiona Clark, New Zealand photographer\n\nFiona Connor (born 1981), New Zealand artist\n\nFiona Coyne (1965–2010), South African actress, author, playwright and presenter\n\nFiona Crawley, American tennis player\n\nFiona Crombie, Australian costume and production designer\n\nFiona Davis, Canadian author\n\nFiona Dawson, LGBT activist, writer, producer, and film director\n\nFiona Dourif, American actress\n\nFiona Doyle, Irish swimmer\n\nFiona M.
