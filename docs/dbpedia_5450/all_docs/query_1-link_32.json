        "text": "Not the best Pern story\n\nI love the pern stories, and I didn't think I'd really be able to tell that Anne didn't write this, but it is surprisingly very different. I don't prefer Todd's style of describing every little thing the main characters feel (mostly Fiona). It's too much description in the sense that it leaves nothing for the reader to infer so it feels more like a lecture than a story absorbing you. I was actually irritated at points during Dragonheart because it was stretching so long unnecessarily. The overall story arch is an interesting concept and should make for an intriguing read (listen) but I was very glad to finish it and will have to put off reading the next one so I don't end my beloved pern on a sour note.\n\nThe narrator is actually much better in Dragonheart than she is in Dragon's Time (which I mistakenly read prior to this one which chronologically comes before it), she has much more feeling in her voice and doesn't sound like an AI at all.\n\nDry and boring, worst narrator ever.\n\nThe story is the worst DRoP so far (reading chronologically) that is just a struggle to get through. I find myself wanting to ffwd through large parts just to get it over with. No character attachment and just poor story pace. Narrator is by far the worst I have ever heard her voice is like nails on a chalkboard and it's like she is reading an adult book to children. Very bad and just makes this iteration of a pern story that much harder to stomach.\n\nI actually enjoyed it.\n\nA lot of the reviews of Todd’s books of been pretty harsh and some deservedly so - I mean how many freaking plagues can we have- but this one was actually interesting as it gave nitty-gritty details of how an isolated weyr is run and detailed Weyrling training. Some interesting characters among the traders and weyr folk."
