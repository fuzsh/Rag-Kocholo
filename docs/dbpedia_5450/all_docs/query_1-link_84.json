        "text": "William McCaffrey of Loudoun County, Virginia and Fayette & Scott Counties, Kentucky\n\n(Owen, Simon, Eleanor, Nancy & William W. McCaf*, children of William of Loudoun)\n\nThe reader may find the following discussion complicated and difficult to follow; however, it is our attempt at a simplified version of a very complicated research project. Many small facts from many sources have been acquired and used to produce the Kentucky McCaf* lineage. There are still a few unresolved questions and issues. More serious research may yield the answers to these situations. As usual, the source details are included in the Database,\n\nClark County, Kentucky was created 6 December, 1792 from Bourbon and Fayette Counties. The first county court meeting was the March Term of 1793. One of the first court orders was to appoint Margaret McCaffrey. the wife of William McCaffrey, deceased and Owen McCaffrey administrators of estate of said William McCaffrey, deceased. On 30 March, 1793, the personal estate of William McCaffrey was inventoried and appraised. This estate contained many items of household furniture, farm implements and farm animals probably indicating an above average farming home; however, we have not found a record of land ownership or of the division, disbursement or sale of the likely real estate. If such property existed, the widow Margaret would have been legally entitled to her dower of one third of the total acreage and the rest should have been distributed between the children of William. No records of such an estate settlement have been found. In 1782, William McCaf* sign a petition in Kentucky and he also was taxed in Fayette County that year. He then seemed to return to Loudoun County, Virginia and also may have lived in Augusta County, Virginia for a short time. His next Fayette County tax record was in 1789 and 1791, not long before Clark County was formed in 1792. Other Clark County records show that William and Margaret had a son William W. McCaffrey, who was born about the same time that William Sr. died. Margaret was enumerated as age 93 and born in Virginia in the 1850 Clark County, Kentucky census. She died in 1853 leaving a will that led to the discovery of her father, Original Williams, who raised his family in Cameron Parish, Loudoun County, Virginia, the home of her deceased husband. Because of Margaret's birth date and the large time gap between the birth date of her son William W. McCaffrey and the birth dates of the rest if William's posited children, we have assumed that Margaret was not the mother of these other children.\n\nEleanor McCaffrey Kennedy and her husband Michael Kennedy were married in Augusta County, Virginia on 12 Jan, 1786 and soon after, in 1787, they moved to Crab Orchard, on the Hanging Fork of the Dick's River in Lincoln County, Kentucky. Urban Ewing Kennedy, the youngest child of Eleanor and Michael became well known as writer of a series of sketches concerning the lives and customs of the early Kentucky settlers. He wrote that his parents moved to Lincoln County, Kentucky about a year after their marriage and that his mother had two brothers named Simon and Oliver. He also mentions that Simon McCaffrey was killed by Indians while serving as a guide for settlers from Virginia. Unfortunately, neither the time or place of Simon's death were mentioned nor were the the parents of Eleanor named. There is no mention of an Oliver McCaf* in Kentucky records, so we have assumed that naming Oliver was a memory lapse or transcription error and that Oliver was instead Owen, who was closely associated with Simon in more than a few Kentucky records. In addition, we have found a similar story in Chapter VII of the History of Kentucky, published in 1852 and authored by T. S, Arthur and W. H. Carpenter. The details of this story are rather long, but it relates how, in 1784, three young men named Davis, Caffree and Robert McClure pursued a group of Southern Indians that had stolen some horses in Lincoln County. Their pursuit led them south toward the Indian village of Chickamongo. As they neared the village they met a group of Indians. A fight ensued and Caffree was killed by one of the Indians. While this story is not identical to the story that Urban Kennedy related, it contains several details that make it a very plausible alternative to the Kennedy version. Remember that an older Urban Kennedy was retelling a story that his mother, Eleanor, had told him, Either person could have had slightly faulty memories. Since Eleanor was living in Virginia in 1784, she may have heard a slightly faulty version of the story. We have treated almost all of these particular assertions of Urban Kennedy as facts, including the assumption that the brother he named as Oliver, was in fact, named Owen. When we combine the evidence presented by Urban Kennedy with the evidence found concerning William McCaffrey Sr. and his son William W. McCaffrey of Clark County, we conclude that Owen, Simon and Eleanor McCaffrey were the children of William Sr. and that the McCaf* orphans found in early Green County were descendants of William McCaffrey Sr. While it is possible that some or all of these orphans were the children of William Sr., the the preponderance of evidence suggests that most or all were the children of Simon McCaffrey, the son of William Sr. When added to other significant evidence that includes descendants yDNA, we consider this research proof that the William McCaffrey that died in 1793 was the son of Hugh and Mary Dehart McCaffrey and the brother of James McCaffrey of Loudoun Co., Virginia.\n\nOwen McCaffrey/McCaffree seems to be the Owen McCafferty that was recorded in 1781 as a member of the Augusta militia company of Captain Thomas Smith. According to Virginia law, Owen would have been at least sixteen years old and thus born before about 1765. He seemed to have obtained a substantial interest in the estate of William McCaffrey since on 31 October 1793 he had seventy pounds current money to purchase 380 acres on Butler's Fork of Russell Creek in Green County, Kentucky. Two facts seem apparent from inspecting images of the original indentures. First, since he signed the indenture as Owen McCaffree he was literate and second he was not married at the time since a wife was not named. Also, this is the first personal record of the McCaffree surname variation that we have found. By 1797, Owen had sold all of the land and his signature was on all the indentures. There was no deed clause addressing a release of a wife's dower rights. Shortly after his purchase, on 11 March 1794, Owen sold 100 acres to Simon McCaffree, who also signed his name. We posit that this Simon (Simon Jr.) was the son of the Simon McCaf* who was killed by Indians. We also suggest that Owen's 380 acre land purchase and subsequent 100 acre sale to Simon Jr. was the result of an estate settlement made after the death of William McCaffrey in late 1792. Simon Jr. was never recorded as paying a property tax or a personal property tax in Green County, even though he owned land there for several years. This situation would almost surely mean he was underage of twenty-one. The evidence of literacy continues with the will of James McCaffree, another posited son of Simon Jr. We also suggest that Owen shared in raising Simon Jr. and his siblings after Simon Sr. was killed. This assumption is reinforced by the 6 April 1795 Green County, Kentucky marriage license of Polly McCafferty and William Butler which describes Owin McCaffery as the guardian of Polly McCafferty/McCoffree.\n\nBoth Owen and a Simon McCaffree were involved in the events that followed the death of John Reynolds in 1795 Green County; however, the estate inventory and sale was delayed for any unusually long time and the recording of this event was delayed for an even longer period. After much research, we can suggest a very plausible scenario for the initial delay; however, the recording delay is still unexplained. In addition, we can find very little about John Reynolds in Kentucky and nothing about his life before he came to Kentucky. We believe that a better understanding of this story would probably add significantly to our understanding of the lives of Owen and Simon McCaffree. Because the details of these events are rather long and confusing, we have included them here for future researchers and historians to pursue. Any additional information will be appreciated.\n\nWilliam W. McCaffrey was about twenty-one when he was first recorded in the 1814 (bc 1793) Clark tax listings. In addition to his personal property tax, he was assessed for fifty acres of land that was located on Upper Howard's Creek. In 1815, he purchased an adjacent twenty-five acres from Joseph and Susan Combs and one of the deed witnesses was William Stewart, the husband of his mother's sister. So, the original fifty acres seems to have been associated with the estate of his father, William Sr.; however, it could have been the total real property, the widow's dower or even some other division. On 28 January, 1819, William married Sarah Stevens in Clark County and the 1830 Clark census enumerated William McCaffray and assumed wife, both in the 30/40 age group. Also enumerated with William were a male and female in the 10/15 age group. He is found in the Clark tax records through 1831 when he apparently died in July/August since the November 1831 Clark court records reveal that no one had applied to be the administrator of the estate of William W. McCaffery, who had died intestate about three months previously. The court ordered the sheriff to sell as much as possible of his estate at auction. We have not found any other court records relating specifically to the death of William; however, about a month later, on 24 October, 1831, Margaret McCaffy sold her interest in the estate of her deceased son, William W. McCaffray, to Sarah McCaffry for one dollar. Margaret was the widow of William McCaffrey Sr. who died in 1793 and Sarah was the widow of William W. McCaffrey. On 17 November, 1831, Wm & Jane McCaffrey of Floyd County, Indiana sold their interest in the estate of Wm McCaffery to Jno Daniel of Montgomery County, Kentucky. On the same day, John and Nancy McCaffray Hamilton of Monroe County, Indiana also sold their interest in the estate of William McCaffrey to John Daniel of Montgomery County, Kentucky. The only way that Margaret, the mother of William W. McCaffrey could have inherited part of his estate is if he had died intestate without any direct heirs. That is, he had died without a will and without any living children, grandchildren, etc. In that event, the inheritors of William's estate would have been his mother and his siblings and/or the children of his deceased siblings. So, William McCaffrey of Floyd, Indiana and the Nancy McCaffrey Hamilton of Monroe Indiana were the siblings of William W. McCaffrey and/or their children. This means the two children enumerated in the 1830 Clark Co., Kentucky census with William W. McCaffrey were either his and they had died before he did or they were his wife's or someone else's. The lack of evidence concerning an estate settlement suggests that Margaret and Sarah McCaffrey, with the possible help of the Clark County sheriff, made an unofficial settlement of the William W. McCaffrey estate which apparently was uncontested. We have concluded that the William McCaffrey of Floyd County, Indiana was the son of Simon McCaffrey Sr., deceased, who was a much older brother of William W. McCaffrey and that Nancy McCaffrey Hamilton who was a much older sister of William W. McCaffrey. William of Floyd was the subject of a 1801 Green County, Kentucky court case in which he was bound out to learn the stone mason trade. He was first taxed in Green in 1805 and was enumerated in the 1820 Floyd County, Indiana census. A John Hamilton and apparent wife are found in the 1840 Monroe County, Indiana census. John was in the 70/80 age bracket and his apparent wife was in the 60/70 age bracket (born 1770/1780). This couple did not seem to survive until the 1850 census; however, our search for John and Nancy Hamilton paid unexpected dividends when we searched the Madison County, Kentucky tax records. We found that John was taxed with 2 males in the 16/21 age bracket in 1798; however that bracket indicated zero in 1797. Checking the Madison court orders, we found a 2 May 1797 court proceeding that ordered John Hambelton \"to shew cause why William McCaffrey an orphan child in his possession may not be bound out to some trade\". We believe that the two younger males were James and William McCaffrey, orphans of Simon McCaffrey Sr. and the tax records show that they were born between 1777 and 1782. This evidence seems to prove that Nancy McCaffrey Hamilton was a daughter of William McCaffrey Sr. who died in 1793. The widow of William W. McCaffrey, Sarah Stevens McCaffrey, later married Edward Stewart and on 13 September 1834, she repurchased the entire interest in the William W. McCaffrey estate from John Daniel. Kentucky death records show that Sarah died in 1879. The 1850 Clark County census records show that she was born about 1799 in Virginia.\n\nMargaret McCaffrey, the widow of William McCaffrey, died in Clark in 1853 at age about 97 and left a will dated in 1843. Her only inheritor was her sister Susan, wife of William Stuart/Stewart. The 1850 Clark census shows Margaret living with William and Susan Stuart. The Fayette County Kentucky records show that William Stewart and Susan Williams were married in 1803. Susan's brother Original Williams signed the marriage license and stated that their farther was dead. The 1800 Fayette tax records show an Original Williams Jr. that research shows to be the son of Original William Sr. of Cameron Parrish, Loudoun County, Virginia. So Margaret Williams, born about 1756 in Cameron Parish, Loudoun County, Virginia, was the widow of William McCaffrey Sr. who died in 1793. A William McCaffrey was listed many times in the tithable records of Cameron Parrish and seemed to have had a family consisting of six children in 1783. William was taxed in Fayette County in 1782, but like many other Kentucky settlers, he seemed to have returned to Loudoun County, Virginia for a short period, probably to prepare his family for their move to Kentucky. In about 1785, he again left Loudoun and probably lived in Augusta County Virginia for another short period. He also may have visited North Carolina for a short time before moving to Kentucky in about 1788.\n\nThe above mentioned data is consistent with the first McCaf* tax records found in Kentucky. The William McCaffrey Sr., mentioned above, was first taxed in 1782 in Fayette County. Owen McCaffrey and a Simon McAfferty were first taxed in 1789 and they were taxed on the same day in 1793 in Lincoln County. James and William McCaf*, the grandsons of William McCaffrey Sr., were first taxed in Green County in 1805, meaning that they had been born about 1783 while Kentucky was still part of Virginia. Kentucky became a state in 1792. Green County, Kentucky was formed in 1793 from portions of Nelson and Lincoln Counties. On March 11, 1794, Owen McCaffree of Green County sold 100 acres of land on Butler's Fork in Green County, Kentucky to Simon McCaffree of Lincoln County, Kentucky, then in 1 April, 1797, Simon of Green sold his 100 acres in Green to William Casey of Green for a small profit. Also in 1797, a Simon McCaffery was recorded in Lincoln County as a Private in the Sixth Regiment of the Kentucky Militia. This record means that he was born before 1781 and evidence shows that he was almost surely Simon Jr., assumed son of Simon Sr. Over the next several years, Owen sold three more tracts on Butler's Fork in Green with the last sale occurring on June 22, 1797. In 1802, Adair County was created from southern Green County and the Butler's Fork area became part of Adair. The marriage bond for the 6 April 1795 marriage of Polly McCoffree and William Butler in Green County is one of the most important documents found in this research. This bond shows that the bride's consent was given by Owin McCafferty, her guardian and this relationship indicates that Polly's father was almost surely dead. This excludes Owen as Polly's father and virtually proves that Simon was her father and dead before 6 April 1795. This bond was executed almost two years before 1797 when a Simon McCaffree sold his Green County land. The land sale and the marriage bond prove that the landowner was Simon McCaffree Jr; however, they do not prove the identity of the father of Simon Jr. We have picked Simon Sr. over Owen based on the fact that James McCaffree named a son Simeon. Like Polly, James was another orphan that lived in Green County and was about the same age as William McCaffrey, another proven orphan. On July 15, 1800, Becky McCafferty/McCoffree married Peter Dillingham in Green. We have not found anything to prove the parents of Becky, but we have arbitrarily assigned her as a daughter of Simon Sr. as we continue to do research.\n\n1n 1807, an Owen and Simon McCaffrey were recorded in the Randolph County, Indiana Territory Census. Between 1801 and 1812, most of Randolph County was in the southern portion of what was termed \"Illinois Country\" which became Illinois Territory in 1809 and the state of Illinois in 1818. Much of Randolph, Illinois bordered the Ohio River, across from Kentucky and, in 1816 when Indiana became a state, some of Randolph became part of Indiana. These two man would seems to be good candidates for Owen and his \"adopted\" son Simon McCaffrey Jr. There are more than a few Indiana Territory records; however, we never found a single mention of either of these men.\n\nJames McCaffrey is recorded as receiving a 100 acre land grant on Sand Lick Fork of Crocus Creek, Cumberland, Kentucky on 24 Sep 1819. James and William McCaf* were first taxed in 1805, so they both seem to have been born about 1783. Alexander Buchanan Morgan, a contemporary of James, termed him a stone mason in a notarized document concerning the Buchanan family. Although we have not found any other evidence of this assertion, we have found that William McCaffney was \"bound out\" to learn the stone mason trade by the 1801 Green County court. The 1820 Paoli, Cumberland Co., Kentucky census shows adjacent entries for James McCaffry and William Butler. On Dec 14 1798, the Kentucky General Assembly authorized the formation of Cumberland County. Part of the enabling legislation describing the Green and Cumberland boundary stated \"...with the same to the wagon road leading from Colonel William Caseyâs to Burksville at the head of Renicks Creek, thence eastwardly so as to leave the settlement of William Butler junior in Green County, thence to continue such a course as will just leave the settlement of Greasy Creek in Green...\". In 1802, Adair County was created between Green and Cumberland, so in 1820, the homes of William Butler and James McCaffry would have been virtually on the boundary between Adair and Cumberland. William Butler Jr. was almost surely the son of William Butler, one of the original Green County settlers and the location of his home in 1798 was exactly the location of James McCaffree's Sand Lick Fork land grant of 1819. The headwaters of Sand Lick Fork are in southeastern Adair, just north of the intersection of Adair, Russell and Cumberland Counties. This small creek then tracks south, crosses the Adair/Cumberland border and empties into Crocus Creek.\n\nThis Ja mes McCaffree was the father of William McCaffree (b. 1818), Jane McCaffree (b. 1820), Simeon McCaffree (b. 1822) and James McCaffree (b. 1824). James' wife was Margaret Morgan and when James died before 1830, Margaret married William Butler Jr. who died before 1840. The images on the left and right are the only two surviving pages from the McC affree's Bible. Please click on an image to enlarge it. James may have been responsible for the first entries, but it is obvious that Margaret added her Butler children. To us, it is very interesting that James was literate, a skill that was somewhat unusual for that time and place. Quakers where prominent in both Berks County, Pennsylvania and Loudoun County, Virginia and childhood literacy was one of the tenants of Quakerism. Since Owen and Simon Jr. McCaffree, James' granduncle and father, also seemed literate. we assume that this skill may have been initially acquired from the first wife of William McCaffrey, who may have been a Quaker and whose father may have had the given name of Owen. We have concluded that William Butler, the second husband of Margaret Morgan McCaffrey, was the person that first married Polly McCoffree in 1795 and was living beside James McCaffrey in 1820. Since Green County was formed from Lincoln in 1793 and both Cumberland County (1799) and Adair (1802) were formed from Green County, it is very likely that these people did not move around nearly as much as it may first appear. In fact, most of them may have not moved at all in this eight year period.\n\nOn the surface, the History of Butler and Bremer Counties, Iowa published in 1883 would not seem to be related to the discussion immediately above; however, this resource contains significant information concerning brothers Charles and Isaac McCaffree and their families. Charles was alleged to be the first permanent settler in Bremer. He arrived in Bremer in the spring of 1845 with his mother and two other people. Isaac joined Charles in the fall of the same year. Before coming to Bremer, Charles had lived in Lee County, Iowa and he had spent his earlier years as a boat hand on the Mississippi River. Both Charles and Isaac were married within a few years. Charles was born in Jefferson County, Kentucky in 1816 and Isaac was born in Indiana in 1823. Since this story seems to be related to the Kentucky McCaffrees, we have tried to work our way back to Indiana and Kentucky. The 1836 Des Moines County, Iowa census shows a William McCaffrey family with 3 males under 21, 2 males over 21, 2 females under 21 and 1 female over 21. De Moines borders on the Mississippi River and was created in 1835 from the Michigan Territory. Adjacent Lee County was created a year later and nearby Scott County was created in 1837. Lee and Scott also border the Mississippi River. The 1840 Scott County, Iowa census shows William McAffrey with one female 10/15, one male 15/20, two males & one female 20/30, one male & one female 50/60, These two censuses seem to correlate and also agree quite well with the William McCaf* found in the 1820 and 1830 censuses of Floyd County, Indiana. Unfortunately, the records of Floyd at the LDS FamilySearch site offer no help whatsoever with William McCaffrey; however, the 1850 Floyd census shows the family of James, 33, and Rachel Butler McCaffrey, 31 who were married in Floyd on 7 May 1839. The image at the right is from page 8 of the 7 January, 1893 edition of the New Albany (Indiana) Evening Tribune. From this short death record, we find that James was born about 1814 and that he moved from Iowa to New Albany before 1833; however, James recorded his birth place as Indiana in several Indiana censuses. This information correlates almost exactly with the above discussion of William McCaffrey and the Kentucky and Iowa McCaffrees. As usual, the source details are included in the Database,\n\nJohn T. C. McAffrey of Blount, Monroe & McMinn Counties Tennessee\n\nA McCaffrey DNA Project participant has also proved that a descendant of John T. C. McAffrey, born about 1795 in Kentucky or \"ocean\" and first enumerated in the 1830 Monroe Co., Tennessee census, was also closely related to the above mentioned McCaffreys and McCaffrees. The image on the right is from the 16 Sep 1863 Owensboro (Kentucky) Monitor and most likely refers to the same person. The marriage license for John T. McAffry and Margaret A. Kile was issued on 1 October 1818 in Blount County, Tennessee. John and family were also enumerated in the 1850 McMinn County, Tennessee census and Kentucky was named as his birth place at this time; however, in the 1860 Washington County, Arkansas census, \"ocean\" was named as his birth place. John seemed to be deceased by the 1870 census, so his birth place seems uncertain. Monroe, Blount and McMinn are all in eastern Tennessee, so it seems possible that he was the son of Terrence McAffry, who is alleged to have immigrated from Ireland in 1796, signed a petition to incorporate Knoxville, Tennessee in 1799, married Patsye Clopton in Roane County, Tennessee in1805 and died in Knox County, Tennessee in 1830. We do not have a known descendant of Terrence in the project, but would welcome one. It is also is a distinct possibility that he was very closely related to the McCaffrees of southern Kentucky and the McCaffreys of central Tennessee and Loudoun County, Virginia. More pointedly, it is quite possible that John was the brother of James and/or William McCaffree of southern Kentucky. This relationship is somewhat supported by the fact that John had a son Hugh and the father of James was Hugh and assumed father of William was Hugh. We have examined virtually all the available online Kentucky unindexed records for this area of Kentucky, but have not seen a reference to John; however, a diligent search of similar Tennessee records might provide more clues. As discussed above, even seemly insignificant clues can been used to provide significant circumstantial evidence.\n\nOther Early American McCaf*\n\nMale McCaffree descendants of both Charles (b. 1816) and Isaac McCaffree (b, 1823) mentioned above have had yDNA tests, as well as, a male McCaffrey descendant of James V. McCaffrey (bc.1814), also mentioned above and found in the 1850 Floyd County, Indiana census. All their yDNA results match very closely and also match very closely with two descendants of James McCaffrey of Loudoun County, Virginia. All of these matches seem to confirm our research conclusions and seem to support our conclusion that James and William McCaffrey of Loudoun were brothers and the sons of Hugh and Mary DeHart McCaffrey. Since Loudoun, Augusta and Botetourt Counties are/were located in relatively close proximity, Cormack McCafferty could be a relative of Hugh McCaffrey. Augusta and Botetourt Counties, Virginia and Union County, South Carolina records provide sufficient evidence to almost positively identify three of Cormack's sons as John, Thomas and Hugh. Most of the few facts used with existing Cormack McCafferty lineages come from Chronicles of the Scotch-Irish Settlement in Virginia, published in 1912 by Lyman Chalkley. This reference is a good start; however, it does not include all the Augusta County records available at FamilySearch or any of the records from the counties that surround Augusta. The lineages of John, Thomas and Hugh McCafferty have been rather well researched and there seems to be quite a few living male McCafferty descendants of these men. The yDNA from male McCafferty descendants of John, Thomas and Hugh would almost surely help in proving their ancestors.\n\nAlso, the John McCafferty who was taxed in 1782 Washington Co., Virginia and probably later signed a Kentucky petition in 1784 may be related to Hugh McCaffrey and/or Cormack McCafferty. John died at age ninety in Ross County, Ohio and left eleven surviving children including David, John Jr., and Samuel McCafferty. The starting point for research is surely the biography found in Portrait and Biographical Record of Fayette, Pickaway and Madison Counties Ohio, published in 1892. The yDNA from a male McCafferty descendant of John McCafferty would probably help determine this relationship, if any.\n\nTraditional Irish Naming Pattern\n\nCaution - Caution - Caution\n\nUsing the pattern below for family history research should be treated as a clue and a clue only. This clue should be used in conjunction with other clues and evidence to posit a relationship. Not to do so can be very misleading and not every Irish family followed the pattern, especially toward the mid-1800s. Equally as important is the fact that most of the children that died at an early age were not recorded and infant mortality was quite high. This fact can completely mislead the unwary. An unexplained gap in the birth ages of children can be an indication of an child's death.\n\nFirst son named for father's father.\n\nSecond son named for mother's father.\n\nThird son named for father.\n\nFourth son named for father's eldest brother.\n\nFirst daughter named for mother's mother.\n\nSecond daughter named for father's mother.\n\nThird daughter named for mother.\n\nFourth daughter named for mother's eldest sister.\n\nSecond wife's oldest daughter named for the first wife.\n\nThe History of the McCaffrey Name\n\nThe McCaffrey surname and all its variations were extremely rare in Colonial America; however, even as late as 1850, Virginia had the highest distribution (1 in 1000) of the McCaffrey, etc. surname in the United States. Reflecting the mass Irish immigration of the mid-1800s, New York became the distribution leader by 1880.\n\nMcCaffrey seems to be the most common variation of the anglicized form of one of the oldest clans of Ireland. In his 1923 reference, Irish Names and Surnames, the Rev. Patrick Woulfe divides the clan origins into two \"tribes\". The first and most widely known was derived from Gadfraidh, the son of Donn Mor Maguire (1260 AD - 1302 AD). Near the middle of the 15th century, King William of England decreed that Irish surnames be anglicized. This led to the slow demise of Gaelic surnames and, over the years, this name became Mac Gadfraidh, M'Gafferie, MacGaffrey, MacCaffray, MacCaffrey, MacCaffery, Caffrey, etc. Bearers of this surname were part of a sept (sub clan, division) of Clan Maguire which ruled the Fermanagh region from about 1250 AD to 1607 AD. The second tribe was derived from Eachmharcach (horse rider), a given name often used by the O'Doherty Clan of Counties Donegal and Mayo. This name evolved into MacEa chmharcaigh, M'Cafferchie, M'Cafferkie, MacCaffarky, MacCagherty, MacCaugherty, MacCafferty, MacCaverty, MacCaharty, MacCaherty, MacCarthy, MacCaffry, Cafferky, Cafferty, etc. In the mid 13th century, the Mac Caffrey seat of power in Fermanagh was established in Ballymacaffry, near the Maguire stronghold of Lisnaskea. The tiny townland (37 acres) of Ballymacaffry still exists within parish of Aghalurcher, in the barony of Magherastephana near the border of County Tyrone, just west of Fivemiletown and about thirteen miles due east of the much larger town of Enniskillen. Although Ballymacaffry is difficult, but not impossible, to find on any map, Enniskillen is the location of the Maguire Castle (Enniskillen Castle), a well known tourist destination constructed on the banks of River Erne in the 1420s by clan chieftain Hugh 'the Hospitable' Maguire. Over many years the castle was attacked by rival clans and English armies and virtually destroyed. On the right is the image of a circa 1550 the castle ground plan published in the 1919 edition of The History of Enniskillen with References to Some Manors in County Fermanagh by William Copeland Trimble. This book is a wonderful reference for anyone interested in Fermanagh and Enniskillen. It can be read and/or downloaded from Internet Archive. On the left below is an image of a British Library water color painting by soldier John Thomas depicting an 1596 siege of the castle. During the early years (circa 1610 ) of the Plantation of Ulster by King James I, the castle was restored by the new English owner, Captain William Cole. Today, the castle is over 400 years old and a photograph shows that the two towers added in 1610 now seem to define the landscape. Ancestors of both the Maguires and O'Dohertys were recorded by Irish historians well before the end of the first millennium. McCaffrey and variations was one of the most numerous surnames enumerated in the 1659 \"census\" of County Fermanagh. Fermanagh is especially interesting b ecause, in 1834, John O'Donovan, one of Ireland's greatest scholars, historic topographers and genealogists, recorded his extensive research in this county. O'Donovan was particularly interested in the surnames of Maguire, O'Flanagan and McManus, the ancient families of Fermanagh; however, he made many references to other notable families, including McCaffrey. His collected papers have been published, edited and footnoted by John B. Cunningham as The Letters of John O'Donovan from Fermanagh.\n\nMcCaffreys, etc, also lived in Scotland. In our research, we have found that the inhabitants of Ireland and Scotland sometimes crossed the Irish Sea to find employment and to escape perpetual clan wars and persecution. So it would not be surprising to find the same biological McCaffreys, etc. in both Ireland and Scotland. There are a great many variations of the McCaffrey, etc. surname and more than a few legends have been put forth concerning the significance of certain variations. Some of the legends may be true but, before the latter part of the 19th century, literacy was uncommon for the vast majority of people, so it was up to a clerk, priest, minister, tax recorder, census taker, etc. to make the spelling determination. In fact, our yDNA project has proved that contemporary families bearing the McCaffrey, McCaffree, McAffrey, McCafferty and Caffrey surnames are biologically related.\n\nMcCaffrey Surname Variations\n\nAs can be seen from the synopsis above, the subject surname was recorded in many variations, even when it related to the same person. This was not an unusual occurrence and happened with many surnames. Some of the surname variations we have encountered: McCaffrey, McCaffery, McCaffary, McCofrey, McCoffrey, McCaffree, McCoffery, McCoffry, McCoffree, McCafferty, McKaffordy, McAfferty, McCaferty, McCaforey, McAffery, McAffrey, McCafrey, McCaffity, McCafry, McKaffry, McAfrey, McCaffry, McKafrey, McCaffey, Mecaffrey, Macaforey, McCafney, McCuffrey and others. When we first began our research on this family, we skipped over many references to McCafferty. This was a newbie mistake.\n\nSince only a small percentage of our early American ancestors were literate, it was left to clerks, ministers, priests, census enumerators, tax collectors and others to hand record on paper the name that they had just heard spoken. These literate recorders came from many linguist, religious and cultural backgrounds (e.g. English, Scottish, Irish, Welsh, German, Dutch, French and others). Often, the backgrounds of the illiterate person and the recorder differed dramatically, but the recorder wrote the name, in English, as he or she heard it. At that time there was no \"right\" was to spell the name of an illiterate person, since they did not know how to spell their own names. It was not until the later part of the 19th century that most, but not nearly all, of Americans could spell their name. As literacy became more widespread, some closely related family branches choose different spellings of their surname. We have even seen brothers chose different surname spellings. For the researcher, this situation has been compounded by the transcription process. Virtually all old documents were originally hand written and many of these documents are very difficult to read, even by experienced transcribers. By comparing the images of original documents with the transcriptions of these documents, we have found many very obvious transcription errors and many, many records that have ambiguous names. The very useful process of recopying and indexing records adds another level of errors. In fact, every time that names (or any data) are copied, errors occur. Finally, the Soundex search system will identify many variations of a surname, but not nearly all of those that we should be interested in (e.g. McCaffrey vs McAffrey). So we are left with genetically related 21st century family branches with different surname spellings. In other words, we believe that it is almost a certainty that there are rather closely related living people with completely different spelling variations of McCaffrey, etc. We also believe that applying 21st century literacy standards to older records is completely inappropriate and unproductive. As family historians, we must work with the records that are available and we must make assumptions and draw conclusions based on these records. When it relates to early American records, we can never have too much evidence, but most of the time we have only meager or circumstantial evidence. Sometimes, in our zeal to extend our lineage, we grasp at exceedingly short straws.\n\nMcCaffrey yDNA Project\n\nIncluding McCaffery, McCaffree, McCafferty, McAffrey, Caffrey & all other variations\n\nI now have about a dozen small autosomal DNA (atDNA) matches with McCaffrey, McCaffery, McCaffree, McCafferty and Caffrey descendants that have posted their lineages to Ancestry.com. The size of these matching atDNA segments indicates that we have a common ancestor at least 5/6 generations in the past. I have briefly discussed the progenitors of most of these lineages in the sections above, especially the \"Other Early American McCaffreys, etc.\" section and I have speculated that they are were likely related to the McCaffreys of Loudoun Co., Virginia. While I have been extremely fortunate to uncover definitive documentation concerning the Loudoun McCaffreys, only a few recorded details have been discovered about the other early progenitors, however, this has not stopped some from imagining extended lineages for these people. Because Ancestry.com does not provide the exact chromosomal detail (chromosome number and segment position) needed to compare these matching segments, all I can say with certainty is that these people are related to me. On average, we inherit about 50% of our atDNA from each of our parents; however, this amount can vary dramatically on an individual basis. Since our number of ancestors doubles with each generation (2,4,8,16,32,64, etc.), we all have 32 ancestors at our 3rd great-grandparent level and 64 ancestors at our 4th great-grandparent level. Since it is possible to inherit atDNA from any or all of them and since few researchers have positively identified all of their ancestors at these levels, it is very difficult for genetic experts and impossible for the average family historian to prove a Common Ancestor using atDNA. In my experience, it is not uncommon to discover 3/4/5/6 Common Ancestors when two well developed lineages are compared. More pointedly, a missing ancestor in either or both of the lineages could be the Common Ancestor that I share with another person. To be perfectly clear: an atDNA (Ancestry.com DNA test) match with a person that has a matching surname in their lineage does not prove that someone with the matching surname is a Common Ancestor, so it is quite possible that any or all of my matches might be related to me through Common Ancestors that are not McCaffreys, etc. It is almost inconceivable to me is that Ancestry.com has shown no inclination at all with respect to changing their policy of withholding this valuable data; however, there an even better way to investigate these connections and others. yDNA is passed from father to son with little or no change, virtually forever. So a male receives his yDNA from only one person; his father. Since the vast majority of children have their father's surnames, yDNA projects are associated with family surnames. I am the creator and one of the co-administrators of the Woody DNA Project. This is a successful yDNA project with about fifty participants. For a complete discussion of yDNA testing, click here.\n\nIn my experience, there has been very little of interest in the McCaffreys, etc. that had their North American roots before the 19th century. This may be because there are few living McCaffreys, etc. that suspect such a lineage. The ancestors of the vast majority of present day North American McCaffreys, etc. immigrated during the mid-1800s, but even these folks do not seem interested in the potential of yDNA. Currently, FamilyTreeDNA (FTDNA) has almost 6,500 registered DNA Projects, but not one surname project devoted to any version of McCaffrey, etc. In the past, I have resisted an attempt at establishing a McCaffrey, McCaffery, McCaffree, McCafferty, McAffrey, etc. DNA Project, but my abovementioned atDNA matches have encouraged me to do so. A useful surname (yDNA) project requires more than just yDNA results: It requires that the lineages of the participants be linked to their yDNA results. A successful surname project requires a very large dose of patience, as well as, a broad and long term view of family history research; however, the results can be very interesting, useful and rewarding. I would be delighted to establish a project partnership with anyone that has an genuine interest and is willing to assist in recruiting male McCaffrey, etc. participants for the project.\n\nThe McCaffrey DNA Project now has twenty-five official participants. The yDNA of some of these men prove, beyond any doubt, that the Loudoun County, Virginia McCaffreys were related to contemporary men with the surnames of McCafferty and McCaffree. In particular, the McCaffrees, first recorded in late 18th century Kentucky were extremely close relatives of the Loudoun McCaffreys.\n\nThe project has also revealed that Abraham McCafferty, born about 1755 in Pennsylvania and found in the early 1800 Indiana censuses, was related to the above mentioned McCaffreys and McCaffrees; however, the Genetic Distance (GD) involved in the matches indicates that the Common Ancestor (CA) of these males existed long before these men came to America.\n\nWe have also have evidence that a contemporary McCaffrey and a McCaffery are related to a contemporary Caffrey, so we have added the Caffrey surname to our banner lists.\n\nClick here to order a yDNA37 kit.
