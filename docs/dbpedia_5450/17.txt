– Todd McCaffrey

It was like winning an illustrator’s lottery to have the opportunity to contribute to such important and popular books as Anne McCaffrey’s Pern novels, books that were both a joy to work with and which inspired some of my most popular cover paintings. Anne’s generous and steadfast enthusiasm for my work through the years is something I will always treasure.
