Todd J. McCaffrey (b. April 27, 1956 as Todd Johnson) is the youngest son of author Anne McCaffrey. He is a writer of science-fiction best known for his continuation of his mother's best-selling Dragonriders of Pern series.

Todd's work on Pern started in earnest with Dragon's Kin (2003), co-written with his mother. 2005 saw the release of Todd's first solo Pern novel, Dragonsblood. Both books take place primarily at the beginning of Pern's Third Pass, nearly two Pernese millennia before the events chronicled in most of Anne McCaffrey's solo Pern novels, such as Dragonflight and The White Dragon. Dragon's Fire, another Anne and Todd McCaffrey collaboration, was released in July 2006. The younger McCaffrey has ideas for several more novels set in the Third Pass.[citation needed]

Todd McCaffrey worked as a computer programmer before taking up writing full-time. He published several short stories and other works under his original name of Todd Johnson. These included an article on Pernese Threadfighting tactics based on his experience as an amateur pilot.

In 2007 he contributed to the Doctor Who short-story collection, Short Trips: Destination Prague.

In 2008, he was a Guest of Honor, along with his mother, at Albacon.[1]

In 2009, he was be Literary Guest of Honor at AggieCon and ConDor.[2]

In 2013 he was at San Diego Comic-Con 2013[3] on the The Delphic Oracle, also signing copies of Dragonwriter: A Tribute to Anne McCaffrey and Pern along with David Brin, David Gerrold, and John Goodwin.
