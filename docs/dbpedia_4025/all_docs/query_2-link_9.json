Despite never actually killing anyone himself, his crimes led him to become one of the most recognised criminal figures in history. While it’s believed 35 killings were carried out including the Tate Murders, due to lack of evidence, not all of them were tried.\n\nWhen Manson and the Family were arrested, it was not actually on suspicion of the murders. It was because it was believed they had vandalised a portion of the Death Valley National Park, something completely unrelated to the murders. They later became associated when Susan Atkins confessed during her hold in detention on suspicion of murdering a man named Gary Hinman in an unrelated incident. Detectives realised after this that Manson and his Family played a part in the killings.\n\nFollowing the horrific Tate murders carried out by Charles Manson and the Manson Family, the jury in the murder trial convicts all of the defendants of first-degree murder on January 25, 1971. Charles Manson headed to state prison for 7 counts of first-degree murder, and 1 count of conspiracy to commit murder. Manson was sentenced to death for his crimes, but escaped death due to a change of law for California Death Row inmates in 1972. He then spent the next four decades in prison, being denied parole 12 times before his death in 2017. It was quite normal in the 1970s for people convicted of murder to get out relatively quickly, sometimes after 10, 15 years, but the public were so afraid of these killers getting out.\n\nWhen the trial was carried out, it lasted nine and a half months, making it the longest murder trial in American history. It was also one of the most publicised and was called the “trial of the century.”\n\nBack to the top ↑\n\nAnti-Vietnam War Protest in Washington D.C.\n\nOn April 24, 1971, the largest ever demonstration opposing a US war took place when 500,000 people marched in Washington D.C. On the same day, 150,000 people demonstrated in San Francisco.\n\nThe event was set up by the organisation Vietnam Veterans Against the War and was a crucial step forward in the campaign to stop the war in Vietnam. The demonstrators were aiming to attract as many people as possible to the march to prove to United States officials that members of the public were going to demand to end the war that they so disproved of. In the crowd were a few members of Congress but no presidential candidates for 1972. The crowd also consisted of older war veterans, who had been through the experience of World War Two and the Korean War.\n\nBack to the top ↑\n\nUnidentified “Dan Cooper” Hijacks Plane\n\nOn November 24, 1971, one of the greatest unsolved mysteries in the history of the FBI began. An unidentified man, calling himself Dan Cooper, bought a one-way plane ticket to Seattle, Washington from Portland, Oregon. He boarded Flight #305 and was never to be seen again after the incidents that happened on the plane.\n\n“Dan Cooper” was wearing a business suit and while waiting for the plane to take off, he ordered a bourbon and soda. After getting the attention of the stewardess, he gave her a note stating that his briefcase held a bomb and that she should sit with him on the flight. The man showed her a mass of wires when he opened the briefcase, indicating there was a bomb in there. She was told to write down what he demanded, which included four parachutes and $200,000 in twenty-dollar bills.\n\nCooper then hijacked the plane when it landed in Seattle, getting the demanded money and the parachutes in exchange for the 36 passengers on board. With a few crew members kept on board, Cooper demanded that the plane take off and head towards Mexico City. When the flight was in Washington state airspace, Cooper jumped out of the plane at the back, with the money and parachutes. The plane was landed safely by the pilots, but it remains unknown what happened to Cooper after he left the plane.\n\nThe investigation into the hijacking was open for years after the incident, but investigators have had no luck in tracking him down or identifying him. His tie was left on the plane which was useful for DNA testing, but no man was ever connected. It could be said that Dan Cooper didn’t even survive his parachute jump, but this has never been confirmed.\n\nBack to the top ↑"
