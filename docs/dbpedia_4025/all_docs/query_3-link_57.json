        "text": "The Board of Trustees is the governing body of Delta College.\n\nDelta College is one of the top community colleges in the country. We are known for innovation, community leadership, teaching excellence and for graduates who make a difference in our communities.\n\nOne of the unique features of Delta is that its service area consists of three counties â€“ Bay, Midland and Saginaw. Three representatives from each county make up the nine member board. Each nominee is elected by ballots cast in all three counties at the November election, and serves a six year term. The term of office begins on January 1 of the year following the election of the trustee. Trustees serve as volunteers, and are not paid for their services.\n\nTo maintain a clear governing philosophy and structure, the Board regularly reviews its bylaws (PDF) and operating parameters (PDF).\n\nCurrent Board of Trustees\n\nBay County\n\nMidland County\n\nSaginaw County\n\nDelta College President & Board Officers\n\nPast Board Members"
