        "text": "Richard was born April 1, 1941, the only child of Alice and Waldo Leonard of Warren.\n\nHe grew up in Warren, riding his bike across the field to his grandparents’ farm to help his grandpa. As his right-hand man, his grandpa described him as “a better helper than any adult.”\n\nHe graduated with honors from Cortland High School in 1959 and was even invited to join Mensa International, but declined and was so humble that very few ever knew this fact.\n\nRichard began dating the love of his life, Jeanette Burnfield, in 1962. They were married in Wildare Church in Warren on Sept. 12, 1964.\n\nNo man has ever been as head over heels for a woman as Richard was for Jeanette. His love for her and for his family was so evident. Richard and Jeanette gave birth to their daughter Elizabeth Ann in 1967, and daughter Eve Michelle in 1973. He loved taking his daughters for rides on his motorcycle and would inevitably always end up at the ice cream shop for an afternoon treat. Richard and Jeanette were just shy of their 60th wedding anniversary and enjoyed life together in every way.\n\nRichard attended Kent State University with a focus on industrial arts. At 23, he started designing fire protection sprinkler systems and did this throughout his whole career — designing and contributing to the fire safety of many homes and businesses, including the Tree of Life at Disney’s Animal Kingdom and the central communications building for NASA. Outside of work, Richard was a master craftsman and could fix and build anything he put his mind to. Aside from the many homes he built for himself and his family, each member is blessed to have many items created by his hands.\n\nRichard loved the Lord with all his heart and was a proud member of Glorieta Baptist Church, where he served as a deacon for many years. If you ever stumbled across him sitting on his porch swing, you’d often hear the sound of his audio Bible coming from his tablet. When Richard prayed, he almost always asked the Lord to help him not to do or say anything that wouldn’t bring honor or glory to God. The most important legacy he leaves behind is a family who also loves the Lord as he did.\n\n“Seek to lead a quiet life, to mind your own business, and to work with your own hands, as we commanded you.” 1 Thessalonians 4:11.\n\nHe is survived by his wife, Jeanette Leonard; daughters, Beth (Gary) Bargeron and Eve (Adam) Brank; grandchildren, Cordia (John) Schmidt, Lane (Emily) Bargeron, Graham (Lizzie) Bargeron, Max Bargeron, Annelise (Arnold) Price, Mabry Brank, Meili Bargeron and Eden Bargeron; and great-grandchildren, Nyra, Jackson, Lael, Everett and Isaiah.\n\nA memorial service will be 11 a.m. Saturday, Aug. 10, 2024, at Glorieta Baptist Church, officiated by the Rev. Nathan Brooks and the Rev. Bill Nix. The Leonard family will receive friends from 10 to 11 a.m., prior to the service.\n\nIn lieu of flowers, memorials may be made to Glorieta Baptist Church, 4912 Hwy. 73, Concord, NC 28025.\n\nArrangements by Gordon Funeral Home, Mount Pleasant, North Carolina, www.gordonfuneralhome.com.\n\n(special notice)"
