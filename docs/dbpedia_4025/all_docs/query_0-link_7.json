        "text": "Abstract\n\nExome (ES) and genome sequencing (GS) are increasingly being utilized for individuals with rare and undiagnosed diseases; however, guidelines on their use remain limited. This study aimed to identify factors associated with diagnosis by ES and/or GS in a heterogeneous population of patients with rare and undiagnosed diseases.In this case control study, we reviewed data from 400 diagnosed and 400 undiagnosed randomly selected participants in the Undiagnosed Diseases Network (UDN), all of whom had undergone ES and/or GS. We analyzed factors associated with receiving a diagnosis by ES and/or GS.Factors associated with a decreased odds of being diagnosed included adult symptom onset, singleton sequencing, and having undergone ES and/or GS prior to acceptance to the UDN (48%, 51%, and 32% lower odds, respectively). Factors that increased the odds of being diagnosed by ES and/or GS included having primarily neurological symptoms and having undergone prior chromosomal microarray testing (44% and 59% higher odds, respectively).We identified several factors that were associated with receiving a diagnosis by ES and/or GS. This will ideally inform the utilization of ES and/or GS and help manage expectations of individuals and families undergoing these tests.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1016/j.gim.2024.101115\n\nView details for PubMedID 38436216\n\nAbstract\n\nACTN2, encoding alpha-actinin-2, is essential for cardiac and skeletal muscle sarcomeric function. ACTN2 variants are a known cause of cardiomyopathy without skeletal muscle involvement. Recently, specific dominant monoallelic variants were reported as a rare cause of core myopathy of variable clinical onset, although the pathomechanism remains to be elucidated. The possibility of a recessively inherited ACTN2-myopathy has also been proposed in a single series.We provide clinical, imaging, and histological characterization of a series of patients with a novel biallelic ACTN2 variant.We report seven patients from five families with a recurring biallelic variant in ACTN2: c.1516A>G (p.Arg506Gly), all manifesting with a consistent phenotype of asymmetric, progressive, proximal, and distal lower extremity predominant muscle weakness. None of the patients have cardiomyopathy or respiratory insufficiency. Notably, all patients report Palestinian ethnicity, suggesting a possible founder ACTN2 variant, which was confirmed through haplotype analysis in two families. Muscle biopsies reveal an underlying myopathic process with disruption of the intermyofibrillar architecture, Type I fiber predominance and atrophy. MRI of the lower extremities demonstrate a distinct pattern of asymmetric muscle involvement with selective involvement of the hamstrings and adductors in the thigh, and anterior tibial group and soleus in the lower leg. Using an in vitro splicing assay, we show that c.1516A>G ACTN2 does not impair normal splicing.This series further establishes ACTN2 as a muscle disease gene, now also including variants with a recessive inheritance mode, and expands the clinical spectrum of actinopathies to adult-onset progressive muscle disease.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1002/acn3.51983\n\nView details for PubMedID 38311799\n\nAbstract\n\nBACKGROUND: Kleefstra syndrome (KS), often diagnosed in early childhood, is a rare genetic disorder due to haploinsufficiency of EHMT1 and is characterized by neuromuscular and intellectual developmental abnormalities. Although congenital heart disease (CHD) is common, the prevalence of arrhythmias and CHD subtypes in KS is unknown.METHODS: Inspired by a novel case series of KS patients with atrial tachyarrhythmias in the USA, we evaluate the two largest known KS registries for arrhythmias and CHD: Radboudumc (50 patients) based on health record review at Radboud University Medical Center in the Netherlands, and GenIDA (163 patients) based on world-wide surveys of patient families.RESULTS: Three KS patients (aged 17-25 years) presented with atrial tachyarrhythmias without manifest CHD. In the international KS registries, the median(IQR) age was considerably younger; GenIDA/Radboudumc at 10/13.5 (12/13) years respectively. Both registries had a 40% prevalence of cardiovascular abnormalities, the majority being CHD, including septal defects, vascular malformations, and valvular disease. Interestingly, 4 (8%) patients in the Radboudumc registry reported arrhythmias without CHD, including one AF, two with supraventricular tachycardias (SVTs), and one with non-sustained ventricular tachycardia. The GenIDA registry reported one patient with AF and another with chronic ectopic atrial tachycardia. In total, atrial tachyarrhythmias were noted in six young KS patients (6/213 or 3%) with at least four (3 AF and 1 AT) without structural heart disease.CONCLUSION: In addition to a high prevalence of CHD, evolving data reveals early-onset atrial tachyarrhythmias in young KS patients, including AF, even in the absence of structural heart disease.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1093/europace/euae003\n\nView details for PubMedID 38195854\n\nAbstract\n\nAlthough CNS tumors are the most common pediatric cancer in the United States, most physicians caring for these patients are not formally certified in the subspecialty. To determine support for developing a formal certification process in pediatric neuro-oncology, the Society for Neuro-Oncology's Pediatrics Special Interest Track Training and Credentialing working group performed a cross-sectional survey-based study of physicians and patients/caregivers of children with a CNS tumor history.Surveys were built in Survey Monkey and were available for 3 months. The physician survey had 34 questions and was open to doctors currently caring for pediatric neuro-oncology patients. The patient/caregiver survey had 13 questions. Both surveys were completed anonymously.The physician survey was completed by 193 participants, the majority of whom self-identified as oncologists. Only 5.6% of survey participants had ever been board-certified in neuro-oncology; the majority of participating physicians were either unaware that this certification existed or thought they were not eligible due to training in pediatrics rather than neurology or internal medicine. Almost half of the self-identified pediatric neuro-oncologists had not completed any specific clinical neuro-oncology training. Over 75% of physicians were supportive of the implementation of a formal certification process in pediatric neuro-oncology. A total of 30 participants completed the patient/caregiver survey. Although the majority of survey participants were highly satisfied with their oncologist, 70% would have been more comfortable if their oncologist had been specifically certified in pediatric neuro-oncology.There is support from physicians, patients, and caregivers to establish a formal certification process in pediatric neuro-oncology.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1093/noajnl/vdad130\n\nView details for PubMedID 37964897\n\nView details for PubMedCentralID PMC10642732\n\nAbstract\n\nHigh-grade gliomas (HGG) in young children pose a challenge due to favorable but unpredictable outcomes. While retrospective studies broadened our understanding of tumor biology, prospective data is lacking.A cohort of children with histologically diagnosed HGG from the SJYC07 trial was augmented with non-protocol patients with HGG treated at St. Jude Children's Research Hospital from November 2007 to December 2020. DNA methylome profiling and whole genome, whole exome, and RNA sequencing were performed. These data were integrated with histopathology to yield an integrated diagnosis. Clinical characteristics and pre-operative imaging were analyzed.Fifty-six children (0.0-4.4 years) were identified. Integrated analysis split the cohort into four categories: infant-type hemispheric glioma (IHG), HGG, low-grade glioma (LGG), and other-central nervous system (CNS) tumors. IHG was the most prevalent (n=22), occurred in the youngest patients (median age=0.4 years), and commonly harbored receptor tyrosine kinase gene fusions (7 ALK, 2 ROS1, 3 NTRK1/2/3, 4 MET). The 5-year event-free (EFS) and overall survival (OS) for IHG was 53.13% (95%CI:35.52 -79.47) and 90.91% (95%CI:79.66-100.00) vs. 0.0% and 16.67% (95%CI:2.78-99.74%) for HGG (p=0.0043, p=0.00013). EFS and OS were not different between IHG and LGG (p=0.95, p=0.43). Imaging review showed IHGs are associated with circumscribed margins (p=0.0047), hemispheric location (p=0.0010), and intratumoral hemorrhage (p=0.0149).HGG in young children is heterogeneous and best defined by integrating histopathological and molecular features. Patients with IHG have relatively good outcomes, yet they endure significant deficits, making them good candidates for therapy de-escalation and trials of molecular targeted therapy.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1093/neuonc/noad130\n\nView details for PubMedID 37503880\n\nAbstract\n\nTo explore the perspectives of parents of undiagnosed children enrolled in genomic diagnosis research regarding their motivations for enrolling their children, their understanding of the potential burdens and benefits, and the extent to which their experiences ultimately aligned with or diverged from their original expectations.In-depth interviews were conducted with parents, audio-recorded and transcribed. A structured codebook was applied to each transcript, after which iterative memoing was used to identify themes.Fifty-four parents participated, including 17 (31.5%) whose child received a diagnosis through research. Themes describing parents' expectations and experiences of genomic diagnosis research included: 1) the extent to which parents' motivations for participation focused on their hope that it would directly benefit their child; 2) the ways in which parents' frustrations regarding the research process confused the dual clinical and research goals of their participation; and 3) the limited clinical benefits parents ultimately experienced for their children.Our results suggest that parents of undiagnosed children seeking enrollment in genomic diagnosis research are at risk of a form of therapeutic misconception - in this case, diagnostic misconception. These findings indicate the need to examine the processes and procedures associated with this research in order to appropriately communicate and balance the potential burdens and benefits of study participation.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1016/j.jpeds.2023.113537\n\nView details for PubMedID 37271495\n\nAbstract\n\nINTRODUCTION: The Undiagnosed Diseases Network (UDN), a clinical research study funded by the National Institutes of Health, aims to provide answers for patients with undiagnosed conditions and generate knowledge about underlying disease mechanisms. UDN evaluations involve collaboration between clinicians and researchers and go beyond what is possible in clinical settings. While medical and research outcomes of UDN evaluations have been explored, this is the first formal assessment of the patient and caregiver experience.METHODS: We invited UDN participants and caregivers to participate in focus groups via email, newsletter, and a private participant Facebook group. We developed focus group questions based on research team expertise, literature focused on patients with rare and undiagnosed conditions, and UDN participant and family member feedback. In March 2021, we conducted, recorded, and transcribed four 60-min focus groups via Zoom. Transcripts were evaluated using a thematic analysis approach.RESULTS: The adult undiagnosed focus group described the UDN evaluation as validating and an avenue for access to medical providers. They also noted that the experience impacted professional choices and helped them rely on others for support. The adult diagnosed focus group described the healthcare system as not set up for rare disease. In the pediatric undiagnosed focus group, caregivers discussed a continued desire for information and gratitude for the UDN evaluation. They also described an ability to rule out information and coming to terms with not having answers. The pediatric diagnosed focus group discussed how the experience helped them focus on management and improved communication. Across focus groups, adults (undiagnosed/diagnosed) noted the comprehensiveness of the evaluation. Undiagnosed focus groups (adult/pediatric) discussed a desire for ongoing communication and care with the UDN. Diagnosed focus groups (adult/pediatric) highlighted the importance of the diagnosis they received in the UDN. The majority of the focus groups noted a positive future orientation after participation.CONCLUSION: Our findings are consistent with prior literature focused on the patient experience of rare and undiagnosed conditions and highlight benefits from comprehensive evaluations, regardless of whether a diagnosis is obtained. Focus group themes also suggest areas for improvement and future research related to the diagnostic odyssey.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1186/s13023-023-02695-5\n\nView details for PubMedID 37032333\n\nAbstract\n\nRecurrence of brain tumors in children after the initial course of treatment remains a problem. This study evaluated the efficacy and safety of reirradiation using stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) in patients with recurrent pediatric primary brain tumors.This IRB-approved retrospective review included pediatric patients with recurrent primary brain tumors treated at Stanford University from 2000 to 2019 using frameless SRS. Time to local failure (LF) and distant intracranial failure (DIF) were measured from the date of SRS and analyzed using competing risk analysis. Overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS) were analyzed with the Kaplan-Meier method.In total, 37 patients aged 2-24 years (median age 11 years at recurrence) were treated for 48 intracranial tumors. Ependymoma (38%) and medulloblastoma (22%) were the most common tumor types. The median (range) single fraction equivalent dose of SRS was 16.4 (12-24) Gy. The median (range) follow-up time was 22.9 (1.5-190) months. The median OS of all patients was 36.8 months. Eight of 40 (20%) lesions with follow-up imaging locally recurred. The 2-year cumulative incidence of LF after reirradiation with SRS was 12.8% (95% CI 4.6%-25.4%). The 2-year cumulative incidence of DIF was 25.3% (95% CI 12.9%-39.8%). The median PFS was 18 months (95% CI 8.9-44). Five (10.4%) patients developed toxicities potentially attributed to SRS, including cognitive effects and necrosis.Reirradiation using SRS for recurrent pediatric brain tumors appears safe with good local control. Innovations that improve overall disease control should continue because survival outcomes after relapse remain poor.\n\nView details for DOI 10.3171/2022.8.FOCUS22361\n\nView details for PubMedID 36321285\n\nAbstract\n\nBACKGROUND: There is emerging evidence that children with complex congenital heart defects (CHDs) are at increased risk for childhood lymphoma, but the mechanisms underlying this association are unclear. Thus, we sought to evaluate the role of DNA methylation patterns on \"CHD-lymphoma\" associations.METHODS: From >3 million live births (1988-2004) in California registry linkages, we obtained newborn dried bloodspots from eight children with CHD-lymphoma through the California BioBank. We performed case-control epigenome-wide association analyses (EWAS) using two comparison groups with reciprocal discovery and validation to identify differential methylation associated with CHD-lymphoma.RESULTS: After correction for multiple testing at the discovery and validation stages, individuals with CHD-lymphoma had differential newborn methylation at six sites relative to two comparison groups. Our top finding was significant in both EWAS and indicates PPFIA1 cg25574765 was hypomethylated among individuals with CHD-lymphoma (mean beta=0.04) relative to both unaffected individuals (mean beta=0.93, p=1.5*10-12 ) and individuals with complex CHD (mean beta=0.95, p=3.8*10-8 ). PPFIA1 encodes a ubiquitously expressed liprin protein in one of the most commonly amplified regions in many cancers (11q13). Further, cg25574765 is a proposed marker of pre-eclampsia, a maternal CHD risk factor that has not been fully evaluated for lymphoma risk in offspring, and the tumor microenvironment that may drive immune cell malignancies.CONCLUSIONS: We identified associations between molecular changes present in the genome at birth and risk of childhood lymphoma among those with CHD. Our findings also highlight novel perinatal exposures that may underlie methylation changes in CHD predisposing to lymphoma.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1002/bdr2.2105\n\nView details for PubMedID 36226634\n\nAbstract\n\nBACKGROUND: Children ≤36 months with Diffuse Intrinsic Pontine Glioma (DIPG) have increased long-term survival (LTS, overall survival (OS) ≥24 months). Understanding distinguishing characteristics in this population is critical to improving outcomes.METHODS: Patients ≤36 months at diagnosis enrolled on the International DIPG Registry (IDIPGR) with central imaging confirmation were included. Presentation, clinical course, imaging, pathology and molecular findings were analyzed.RESULTS: Among 1183 patients in IDIPGR, 40 were eligible (median age: 29 months). Median OS was 15 months. Twelve patients (30%) were LTS, 3 (7.5%) very long-term survivors ≥ 5 years. Among 8 untreated patients, median OS was 2 months. Patients enrolled in the registry but excluded from our study by central radiology review or tissue diagnosis had median OS of 7 months. All but 1 LTS received radiation. Among 32 treated patients, 1-, 2-, 3-, and 5-year OS rates were 68.8%, 31.2%, 15.6% and 12.5%, respectively. LTS had longer duration of presenting symptoms (p=0.018). No imaging features were predictive of outcome. Tissue and genomic data were available in 18 (45%) and 10 patients, respectively. Among 9 with known H3K27M status, 6 had a mutation.CONCLUSIONS: Children ≤36 months demonstrated significantly more LTS, with an improved median OS of 15 months; 92% of LTS received radiation. Median OS in untreated children was 2 months, compared to 17 months for treated children. LTS had longer duration of symptoms. Excluded patients demonstrated a lower OS, contradicting the hypothesis that children ≤36 months with DIPG show improved outcomes due to misdiagnosis.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1093/neuonc/noac123\n\nView details for PubMedID 35552452\n\nAbstract\n\nBackground Radiogenomics of pediatric medulloblastoma (MB) offers an opportunity for MB risk stratification, which may aid therapeutic decision making, family counseling, and selection of patient groups suitable for targeted genetic analysis. Purpose To develop machine learning strategies that identify the four clinically significant MB molecular subgroups. Materials and Methods In this retrospective study, consecutive pediatric patients with newly diagnosed MB at MRI at 12 international pediatric sites between July 1997 and May 2020 were identified. There were 1800 features extracted from T2- and contrast-enhanced T1-weighted preoperative MRI scans. A two-stage sequential classifier was designed-one that first identifies non-wingless (WNT) and non-sonic hedgehog (SHH) MB and then differentiates therapeutically relevant WNT from SHH. Further, a classifier that distinguishes high-risk group 3 from group 4 MB was developed. An independent, binary subgroup analysis was conducted to uncover radiomics features unique to infantile versus childhood SHH subgroups. The best-performing models from six candidate classifiers were selected, and performance was measured on holdout test sets. CIs were obtained by bootstrapping the test sets for 2000 random samples. Model accuracy score was compared with the no-information rate using the Wald test. Results The study cohort comprised 263 patients (mean age ± SD at diagnosis, 87 months ± 60; 166 boys). A two-stage classifier outperformed a single-stage multiclass classifier. The combined, sequential classifier achieved a microaveraged F1 score of 88% and a binary F1 score of 95% specifically for WNT. A group 3 versus group 4 classifier achieved an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 98%. Of the Image Biomarker Standardization Initiative features, texture and first-order intensity features were most contributory across the molecular subgroups. Conclusion An MRI-based machine learning decision path allowed identification of the four clinically relevant molecular pediatric medulloblastoma subgroups. © RSNA, 2022 Online supplemental material is available for this article.

The purpose of this study was to describe clinical, radiological, pathologic, and molecular characteristics in patients ≥10 years of age with DIPG enrolled in the International DIPG Registry (IDIPGR).METHODS: Patients ≥10 years of age at diagnosis enrolled in the IDIPGR with imaging confirmed DIPG diagnosis were included. The primary outcome was overall survival (OS) categorized as long-term survivors (LTS) (≥24 months) or short-term survivors (STS) (<24 months).RESULTS: Among 1010 patients, 208 (21%) were ≥10 years of age at diagnosis; 152 were eligible with a median age of 12 years (range 10-26.8). Median OS was 13 (2-82) months. The 1-, 3-, and 5-year OS was 59.2%, 5.3%, and 3.3%, respectively. The 18/152 (11.8%) LTS were more likely to be older (P < .01) and present with longer symptom duration (P < .01). Biopsy and/or autopsy were performed in 50 (33%) patients; 77%, 61%, 33%, and 6% of patients tested had H3K27M (H3F3A or HIST1H3B), TP53, ATRX, and ACVR1 mutations/genome alterations, respectively. Two of 18 patients with IDH1 testing were IDH1-mutant and 1 was a LTS. The presence or absence of H3 alterations did not affect survival.CONCLUSION: Patients ≥10 years old with DIPG have a median survival of 13 months. LTS present with longer symptom duration and are likely to be older at presentation compared to STS. ATRX mutation rates were higher in this population than the general DIPG population.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1093/neuonc/noab140\n\nView details for PubMedID 34114629\n\nAbstract\n\nBACKGROUND: Diffuse intrinsic pontine glioma (DIPG) remains a clinico-radiologic diagnosis without routine tissue acquisition. Reliable imaging distinction between DIPG and other pontine tumors with potentially more favorable prognoses and treatment considerations is essential.METHODS: Cases submitted to the International DIPG registry (IDIPGR) with histopathologic and/or radiologic data were analyzed. Central imaging review was performed on diagnostic brain MRIs (if available) by two neuro-radiologists. Imaging features suggestive of alternative diagnoses included non-pontine origin, <50% pontine involvement, focally exophytic morphology, sharply-defined margins, and/or marked diffusion restriction throughout.RESULTS: Among 286 patients with pathology from biopsy and/or autopsy, 23 (8%) had histologic diagnoses inconsistent with DIPG, most commonly non-diffuse low-grade gliomas and embryonal tumors. Among 569 patients with centrally-reviewed diagnostic MRIs, 40 (7%) were classified as non-DIPG, alternative diagnosis suspected. The combined analysis included 151 patients with both histopathology and centrally-reviewed MRI. Of 77 patients with imaging classified as characteristic of DIPG, 76 (99%) had histopathologic diagnoses consistent with DIPG (infiltrating grade II-IV gliomas). Of 57 patients classified as likely DIPG with some unusual imaging features, 55 (96%) had histopathologic diagnoses consistent with DIPG. Of 17 patients with imaging features suggestive of an alternative diagnosis, eight (47%) had histopathologic diagnoses inconsistent with DIPG (remaining patients were excluded due to non-pontine tumor origin). Association between central neuro-imaging review impression and histopathology was significant (p<0.001), and central neuro-imaging impression was prognostic of overall survival.CONCLUSIONS: The accuracy and important role of central neuro-imaging review in confirming the diagnosis of DIPG is demonstrated.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1093/neuonc/noab245\n\nView details for PubMedID 34668975\n\nAbstract\n\nGenetic counselors (GCs) are increasingly filling important positions on research study teams, but there is limited literature describing the roles of GCs in these settings. GCs on the Undiagnosed Diseases Network (UDN) study team serve in a variety of roles across the research network and provide an opportunity to better understand genetic counselor roles in research. To quantitatively characterize the tasks regularly performed and professional fulfillment derived from these tasks, two surveys were administered to UDN GCs in a stepwise fashion. Responses from the first, free-response survey elicited the scope of tasks which informed development of a second structured, multiple-select survey. In survey 2, respondents were asked to select which roles they performed. Across 19 respondents, roles in survey 2 received a total of 947 selections averaging approximately 10 selections per role. When asked to indicate what roles they performed, respondent selected a mean of 50 roles (range 22-70). Survey 2 data were analyzed via thematic coding of responses and hierarchical cluster analysis to identify patterns in responses. From the thematic analysis, 20 non-overlapping codes emerged in seven categories: clinical interaction and care, communication, curation, leadership, participant management, research, and team management. Three themes emerged from the categories that represented the roles of GCs in the UDN: clinical care, collaboration, and curation. Cluster analyses showed that responses were more similar among individuals at the same institution than between institutions. This study highlights the ways GCs apply their unique skill set in the context of a clinical translational research network. Additionally, findings from this study reinforce the wide applicability of core skills that are part of genetic counseling training. Clinical literacy, genomics expertise and analysis, interpersonal, psychosocial and counseling skills, education, professional practice skills, and an understanding of research processes make genetic counselors well suited for such roles and poised to positively impact research experiences and outcomes for participants.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1002/jgc4.1493\n\nView details for PubMedID 34374469\n\nAbstract\n\nPURPOSE: Report relevance of molecular groups to clinico-pathologic features, germline SMARCB1/SMARCA4 alterations (GLA), and survival of children with atypical teratoid rhabdoid tumor (ATRT) treated in two multi-institutional clinical trials.PATIENTS AND METHODS: Seventy-four participants with newly diagnosed ATRT were treated in two trials: infants (SJYC07: age<3 years; n=52) and children (SJMB03: age 3-21 years; n=22), using surgery, conventional chemotherapy (infants), or dose-dense chemotherapy with autologous stem cell rescue (children), and age- and risk-adapted radiation therapy [focal (infants) and craniospinal (CSI) (children)]. Molecular groups ATRT-MYC (MYC), ATRT-SHH (SHH), and ATRT-TYR (TYR) were determined from tumor DNA methylation profiles.RESULTS: Twenty-four participants (32%) were alive at time of analysis at a median follow-up of 8.4 years (range, 3.1-14.1 years). Methylation profiling classified 64 ATRTs as TYR (n=21), SHH (n=30), and MYC (n=13), SHH group being associated with metastatic disease. Among infants, TYR group had the best overall survival (OS) (P=0.02). However, outcomes did not differ by molecular groups among infants with non-metastatic (M0) disease. Children with M0 disease and <1.5 cm2 residual tumor had a 5-year progression-free survival (PFS) of 72.7{plus minus}12.7% and OS of 81.8{plus minus}11%. Infants with M0 disease had a 5-year PFS of 39.1{plus minus}11.5% and OS of 51.8{plus minus}12%. Those with metastases fared poorly [5-year OS 25{plus minus}12.5% (children) and 0% (infants)]. SMARCB1 GLAs were not associated with PFS.CONCLUSION: Among infants, those with ATRT-TYR had the best OS. ATRT-SHH was associated with metastases and consequently with inferior outcomes. Children with non-metastatic ATRT benefit from post-operative CSI and adjuvant chemotherapy.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-20-4731\n\nView details for PubMedID 33737307\n\nAbstract\n\nPurpose: Medulloblastoma is one of the most common malignant brain tumors in children. To date, the treatment of average-risk (non-metastatic, completely resected) medulloblastoma includes craniospinal radiation therapy and adjuvant chemotherapy. Modern treatment modalities and now risk stratification of subgroups have extended the survival of these patients, exposing the long-term morbidities associated with radiation therapy. Prior to advances in molecular subgrouping, we sought to reduce the late effects of radiation in patients with average-risk medulloblastoma.Methods: We performed a single-arm, multi-institution study, reducing the dose of craniospinal irradiation by 25% to 18 Gray (Gy) with the goal of maintaining the therapeutic efficacy as described in CCG 9892 with maintenance chemotherapy.Results: Twenty-eight (28) patients aged 3-30 years were enrolled across three institutions between April 2001 and December 2010. Median age at enrollment was 9 years with a median follow-up time of 11.7 years. The 3-year relapse-free (RFS) and overall survival (OS) were 79% (95% confidence interval [CI] 58% to 90%) and 93% (95% CI 74% to 98%), respectively. The 5-year RFS and OS were 71% (95% CI 50% to 85%) and 86% (95% CI 66% to 94%), respectively. Toxicities were similar to those seen in other studies; there were no grade 5 toxicities.Conclusions: Given the known neurocognitive adverse effects associated with cranial radiation therapy, studies to evaluate the feasibility of dose reduction are needed. In this study, we demonstrate that select patients with average-risk medulloblastoma may benefit from a reduced craniospinal radiation dose of 18 Gy without impacting relapse-free or overall survival.Clinical Trial Registration: ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT00031590.\n\nView details for DOI 10.3389/fonc.2021.744739\n\nView details for PubMedID 34540703\n\nAbstract\n\nThe risk profile for posterior fossa ependymoma (EP) depends on surgical and molecular status [Group A (PFA) versus Group B (PFB)]. While subtotal tumor resection is known to confer worse prognosis, MRI-based EP risk-profiling is unexplored. We aimed to apply machine learning strategies to link MRI-based biomarkers of high-risk EP and also to distinguish PFA from PFB.We extracted 1800 quantitative features from presurgical T2-weighted (T2-MRI) and gadolinium-enhanced T1-weighted (T1-MRI) imaging of 157 EP patients. We implemented nested cross-validation to identify features for risk score calculations and apply a Cox model for survival analysis. We conducted additional feature selection for PFA versus PFB and examined performance across three candidate classifiers.For all EP patients with GTR, we identified four T2-MRI-based features and stratified patients into high- and low-risk groups, with 5-year overall survival rates of 62% and 100%, respectively (p < 0.0001). Among presumed PFA patients with GTR, four T1-MRI and five T2-MRI features predicted divergence of high- and low-risk groups, with 5-year overall survival rates of 62.7% and 96.7%, respectively (p = 0.002). T1-MRI-based features showed the best performance distinguishing PFA from PFB with an AUC of 0.86.We present machine learning strategies to identify MRI phenotypes that distinguish PFA from PFB, as well as high- and low-risk PFA. We also describe quantitative image predictors of aggressive EP tumors that might assist risk-profiling after surgery. Future studies could examine translating radiomics as an adjunct to EP risk assessment when considering therapy strategies or trial candidacy.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1093/neuonc/noab272\n\nView details for PubMedID 34850171\n\nAbstract\n\nEIF2AK1 and EIF2AK2 encode members of the eukaryotic translation initiation factor 2 alpha kinase (EIF2AK) family that inhibits protein synthesis in response to physiologic stress conditions. EIF2AK2 is also involved in innate immune response and the regulation of signal transduction, apoptosis, cell proliferation, and differentiation. Despite these findings, human disorders associated with deleterious variants in EIF2AK1 and EIF2AK2 have not been reported. Here, we describe the identification of nine unrelated individuals with heterozygous de novo missense variants in EIF2AK1 (1/9) or EIF2AK2 (8/9). Features seen in these nine individuals include white matter alterations (9/9), developmental delay (9/9), impaired language (9/9), cognitive impairment (8/9), ataxia (6/9), dysarthria in probands with verbal ability (6/9), hypotonia (7/9), hypertonia (6/9), and involuntary movements (3/9). Individuals with EIF2AK2 variants also exhibit neurological regression in the setting of febrile illness or infection. We use mammalian cell lines and proband-derived fibroblasts to further confirm the pathogenicity of variants in these genes and found reduced kinase activity. EIF2AKs phosphorylate eukaryotic translation initiation factor 2 subunit 1 (EIF2S1, also known as EIF2α), which then inhibits EIF2B activity. Deleterious variants in genes encoding EIF2B proteins cause childhood ataxia with central nervous system hypomyelination/vanishing white matter (CACH/VWM), a leukodystrophy characterized by neurologic regression in the setting of febrile illness and other stressors. Our findings indicate that EIF2AK2 missense variants cause a neurodevelopmental syndrome that may share phenotypic and pathogenic mechanisms with CACH/VWM.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1016/j.ajhg.2020.02.016\n\nView details for PubMedID 32197074\n\nAbstract\n\nChoroid plexus carcinoma (CPC) is a rare and aggressive tumor of infancy without a clear treatment strategy. This study describes the outcomes of children with CPC treated on the multi-institutional phase 2 SJYC07 trial and reports on the significance of clinical and molecular characteristics.Eligible children <3 years-old with CPC were postoperatively stratified to intermediate-risk (IR) stratum if disease was localized or high-risk (HR) stratum, if metastatic. All received high-dose methotrexate-containing induction chemotherapy. IR-stratum patients received focal irradiation as consolidation whereas HR-stratum patients received additional chemotherapy. Consolidation was followed by oral antiangiogenic maintenance regimen. Survival rates and potential prognostic factors were analyzed.Thirteen patients (median age: 1.41 years, range: 0.21-2.93) were enrolled; 5 IR, 8 HR. Gross-total resection or near-total resection was achieved in ten patients and subtotal resection in 3. Seven patients had TP53-mutant tumors, including 4 who were germline carriers. Five patients experienced progression and died of disease; 8 (including 5 HR) are alive without progression. The 5-year progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival rates were 61.5 ± 13.5% and 68.4 ± 13.1%. Patients with TP53-wild-type tumors had a 5-year PFS of 100% as compared to 28.6 ± 17.1% for TP53-mutant tumors (P = .012). Extent of resection, metastatic status, and use of radiation therapy were not significantly associated with survival.Non-myeloablative high-dose methotrexate-containing therapy with maximal surgical resection resulted in long-term PFS in more than half of patients with CPC. TP53-mutational status was the only significant prognostic variable and should form the basis of risk-stratification in future trials.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1093/noajnl/vdaa168\n\nView details for PubMedID 33506206\n\nView details for PubMedCentralID PMC7813199\n\nAbstract\n\nThis study describes imaging features of diffuse intrinsic pontine glioma (DIPG) and correlates with overall survival (OS) and histone mutation status in the International DIPG registry (IDIPGR).400 cases submitted to the IDIPGR with a local diagnosis of DIPG and baseline MRI were evaluated by consensus review of two neuroradiologists. 43 cases were excluded (inadequate imaging or alternative diagnoses). Agreement between reviewers, association with histone status, and univariable and multivariable analyses relative to OS were assessed.On univariable analysis imaging features significantly associated with worse OS included: extrapontine extension, larger size, enhancement, necrosis, diffusion restriction, and distant disease. 9.5% of patients were considered not to have DIPG on central review. There was moderate mean agreement of MRI features between reviewers. On multivariable analysis chemotherapy, age, and distant disease were predictors of OS. There was no difference in OS between wild-type and H3 mutated cases. The only imaging feature associated with histone status was the presence of ill-defined signal infiltrating pontine fibers.Baseline imaging features are assessed in the IDIPGR. There was a 9.5% discordance in DIPG diagnosis between local and central review demonstrating need for central imaging confirmation for prospective trials. Although several imaging features were significantly associated with OS (univariable) only age and distant disease were significant on multivariable analyses. There was limited association of imaging features with histone mutation status although numbers are small and evaluation exploratory.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1093/neuonc/noaa140\n\nView details for PubMedID 32506137\n\nAbstract\n\nWhen applying genomic medicine to a rare disease patient, the primary goal is to identify one or more genomic variants that may explain the patient's phenotypes. Typically, this is done through annotation, filtering, and then prioritization of variants for manual curation. However, prioritization of variants in rare disease patients remains a challenging task due to the high degree of variability in phenotype presentation and molecular source of disease. Thus, methods that can identify and/or prioritize variants to be clinically reported in the presence of such variability are of critical importance.We tested the application of classification algorithms that ingest variant annotations along with phenotype information for predicting whether a variant will ultimately be clinically reported and returned to a patient. To test the classifiers, we performed a retrospective study on variants that were clinically reported to 237 patients in the Undiagnosed Diseases Network.We treated the classifiers as variant prioritization systems and compared them to four variant prioritization algorithms and two single-measure controls. We showed that the trained classifiers outperformed all other tested methods with the best classifiers ranking 72% of all reported variants and 94% of reported pathogenic variants in the top 20.We demonstrated how freely available binary classification algorithms can be used to prioritize variants even in the presence of real-world variability. Furthermore, these classifiers outperformed all other tested methods, suggesting that they may be well suited for working with real rare disease patient datasets.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1186/s12859-019-3026-8\n\nView details for PubMedID 31615419\n\nView details for PubMedCentralID PMC6792253\n\nAbstract\n\nCadherins constitute a family of transmembrane proteins that mediate calcium-dependent cell-cell adhesion. The extracellular domain of cadherins consists of extracellular cadherin (EC) domains, separated by calcium binding sites. The EC interacts with other cadherin molecules in cis and in trans to mechanically hold apposing cell surfaces together. CDH2 encodes N-cadherin, whose essential roles in neural development include neuronal migration and axon pathfinding. However, CDH2 has not yet been linked to a Mendelian neurodevelopmental disorder. Here, we report de novo heterozygous pathogenic variants (seven missense, two frameshift) in CDH2 in nine individuals with a syndromic neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by global developmental delay and/or intellectual disability, variable axon pathfinding defects (corpus callosum agenesis or hypoplasia, mirror movements, Duane anomaly), and ocular, cardiac, and genital anomalies. All seven missense variants (c.1057G>A [p.Asp353Asn]; c.1789G>A [p.Asp597Asn]; c.1789G>T [p.Asp597Tyr]; c.1802A>C [p.Asn601Thr]; c.1839C>G [p.Cys613Trp]; c.1880A>G [p.Asp627Gly]; c.2027A>G [p.Tyr676Cys]) result in substitution of highly conserved residues, and six of seven cluster within EC domains 4 and 5. Four of the substitutions affect the calcium-binding site in the EC4-EC5 interdomain. We show that cells expressing these variants in the EC4-EC5 domains have a defect in cell-cell adhesion; this defect includes impaired binding in trans with N-cadherin-WT expressed on apposing cells. The two frameshift variants (c.2563_2564delCT [p.Leu855Valfs∗4]; c.2564_2567dupTGTT [p.Leu856Phefs∗5]) are predicted to lead to a truncated cytoplasmic domain. Our study demonstrates that de novo heterozygous variants in CDH2 impair the adhesive activity of N-cadherin, resulting in a multisystemic developmental disorder, that could be named ACOG syndrome (agenesis of corpus callosum, axon pathfinding, cardiac, ocular, and genital defects).\n\nView details for DOI 10.1016/j.ajhg.2019.09.005\n\nView details for PubMedID 31585109\n\nView details for PubMedCentralID PMC6817525\n\nAbstract\n\nBACKGROUND: Cerebellar Mutism Syndrome (CMS) is a common complication following resection of posterior fossa tumors, most commonly after surgery for medulloblastoma. Medulloblastoma subgroups have historically been treated as a single entity when assessing CMS risk; however, recent studies highlighting their clinical heterogeneity suggest the need for subgroup-specific analysis. Here, we examine a large international multicenter cohort of molecularly characterized medulloblastoma patients to assess predictors of CMS.METHODS: We assembled a cohort of 370 molecularly characterized medulloblastoma subjects with available neuroimaging from five sites globally including Great Ormond Street Hospital, Christian Medical College and Hospital, Hospital for Sick Children, King Hussein Cancer Center, and Lucile Packard Children's Hospital. Age at diagnosis, sex, tumour volume, and CMS development were assessed in addition to molecular subgroup.RESULTS: Overall, 23.8% of patients developed CMS. CMS patients were younger (mean difference -2.05 years ± 0.50, P=0.0218) and had larger tumours (mean difference 10.25 cm3 ± 4.60, P=0.0010) that were more often midline (OR=5.72, P<0.0001). In a multivariable analysis adjusting for age, sex, midline location, and tumour volume, WNT (Wingless) (adjusted OR=4.91, p=0.0063), Group 3 (adjusted OR=5.56, p=0.0022) and Group 4 (adjusted OR=8.57 p=9.1x10-5) tumours were found to be independently associated with higher risk of CMS compared with SHH (Sonic Hedgehog) tumours.CONCLUSIONS: Medulloblastoma subgroup is a very strong predictor of CMS development, independent of tumour volume and midline location. These findings have significant implications for management of both the tumour and CMS.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1093/neuonc/noz158\n\nView details for PubMedID 31504816\n\nAbstract\n\nWD40 repeat-containing proteins form a large family of proteins present in all eukaryotes. Here, we identified five pediatric probands with de novo variants in WDR37, which encodes a member of the WD40 repeat protein family. Two probands shared one variant and the others have variants in nearby amino acids outside the WD40 repeats. The probands exhibited shared phenotypes of epilepsy, colobomas, facial dysmorphology reminiscent of CHARGE syndrome, developmental delay and intellectual disability, and cerebellar hypoplasia. The WDR37 protein is highly conserved in vertebrate and invertebrate model organisms and is currently not associated with a human disease. We generated a null allele of the single Drosophila ortholog to gain functional insights and replaced the coding region of the fly gene CG12333/wdr37 with GAL4. These flies are homozygous viable but display severe bang sensitivity, a phenotype associated with seizures in flies. Additionally, the mutant flies fall when climbing the walls of the vials, suggesting a defect in grip strength, and repeat the cycle of climbing and falling. Similar to wall clinging defect, mutant males often lose grip of the female abdomen during copulation. These phenotypes are rescued by using the GAL4 in the CG12333/wdr37 locus to drive the UAS-human reference WDR37 cDNA. The two variants found in three human subjects failed to rescue these phenotypes, suggesting that these alleles severely affect the function of this protein. Taken together, our data suggest that variants in WDR37 underlie a novel syndromic neurological disorder.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1016/j.ajhg.2019.06.014\n\nView details for PubMedID 31327508\n\nAbstract\n\nThe X-chromosome gene USP9X encodes a deubiquitylating enzyme that has been associated with neurodevelopmental disorders primarily in female subjects. USP9X escapes X inactivation, and in female subjects de novo heterozygous copy number loss or truncating mutations cause haploinsufficiency culminating in a recognizable syndrome with intellectual disability and signature brain and congenital abnormalities. In contrast, the involvement of USP9X in male neurodevelopmental disorders remains tentative.We used clinically recommended guidelines to collect and interrogate the pathogenicity of 44 USP9X variants associated with neurodevelopmental disorders in males. Functional studies in patient-derived cell lines and mice were used to determine mechanisms of pathology.Twelve missense variants showed strong evidence of pathogenicity. We define a characteristic phenotype of the central nervous system (white matter disturbances, thin corpus callosum, and widened ventricles); global delay with significant alteration of speech, language, and behavior; hypotonia; joint hypermobility; visual system defects; and other common congenital and dysmorphic features. Comparison of in silico and phenotypical features align additional variants of unknown significance with likely pathogenicity. In support of partial loss-of-function mechanisms, using patient-derived cell lines, we show loss of only specific USP9X substrates that regulate neurodevelopmental signaling pathways and a united defect in transforming growth factor β signaling. In addition, we find correlates of the male phenotype in Usp9x brain-specific knockout mice, and further resolve loss of hippocampal-dependent learning and memory.Our data demonstrate the involvement of USP9X variants in a distinctive neurodevelopmental and behavioral syndrome in male subjects and identify plausible mechanisms of pathogenesis centered on disrupted transforming growth factor β signaling and hippocampal function.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1016/j.biopsych.2019.05.028\n\nView details for PubMedID 31443933\n\nAbstract\n\nOptimal lysosome function requires maintenance of an acidic pH maintained by proton pumps in combination with a counterion transporter such as the Cl-/H+ exchanger, CLCN7 (ClC-7), encoded by CLCN7. The role of ClC-7 in maintaining lysosomal pH has been controversial. In this paper, we performed clinical and genetic evaluations of two children of different ethnicities. Both children had delayed myelination and development, organomegaly, and hypopigmentation, but neither had osteopetrosis. Whole-exome and -genome sequencing revealed a de novo c.2144A>G variant in CLCN7 in both affected children. This p.Tyr715Cys variant, located in the C-terminal domain of ClC-7, resulted in increased outward currents when it was heterologously expressed in Xenopus oocytes. Fibroblasts from probands displayed a lysosomal pH approximately 0.2 units lower than that of control cells, and treatment with chloroquine normalized the pH. Primary fibroblasts from both probands also exhibited markedly enlarged intracellular vacuoles; this finding was recapitulated by the overexpression of human p.Tyr715Cys CLCN7 in control fibroblasts, reflecting the dominant, gain-of-function nature of the variant. A mouse harboring the knock-in Clcn7 variant exhibited hypopigmentation, hepatomegaly resulting from abnormal storage, and enlarged vacuoles in cultured fibroblasts. Our results show that p.Tyr715Cys is a gain-of-function CLCN7 variant associated with developmental delay, organomegaly, and hypopigmentation resulting from lysosomal hyperacidity, abnormal storage, and enlarged intracellular vacuoles. Our data supports the hypothesis that the ClC-7 antiporter plays a critical role in maintaining lysosomal pH.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1016/j.ajhg.2019.04.008\n\nView details for PubMedID 31155284\n\nView details for PubMedCentralID PMC6562152\n\nAbstract\n\nEncoding the slow skeletal muscle isoform of myosin binding protein-C, MYBPC1 is associated with autosomal dominant and recessive forms of arthrogryposis. The authors describe a novel association for MYBPC1 in four patients from three independent families with skeletal muscle weakness, myogenic tremors, and hypotonia with gradual clinical improvement. The patients carried one of two de novo heterozygous variants in MYBPC1, with the p.Leu263Arg variant seen in three individuals and the p.Leu259Pro variant in one individual. Both variants are absent from controls, well conserved across vertebrate species, predicted to be damaging, and located in the M-motif. Protein modeling studies suggested that the p.Leu263Arg variant affects the stability of the M-motif, whereas the p.Leu259Pro variant alters its structure. In vitro biochemical and kinetic studies demonstrated that the p.Leu263Arg variant results in decreased binding of the M-motif to myosin, which likely impairs the formation of actomyosin cross-bridges during muscle contraction. Collectively, our data substantiate that damaging variants in MYBPC1 are associated with a new form of an early-onset myopathy with tremor, which is a defining and consistent characteristic in all affected individuals, with no contractures. Recognition of this expanded myopathic phenotype can enable identification of individuals with MYBPC1 variants without arthrogryposis.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1002/humu.23760\n\nView details for PubMedID 31264822\n\nAbstract\n\nFamily screening of a 48-year-old male with recently diagnosed IgG4-related disease (IgG4-RD) revealed unanticipated elevations in plasma IgG4 in his two healthy teenaged sons.We performed gene sequencing, immune cell studies, HLA typing, and analyses of circulating cytotoxic CD4+ T lymphocytes and plasmablasts to seek clues to pathogenesis. DNA from a separate cohort of 99 patients with known IgG4-RD was also sequenced for the presence of genetic variants in a specific gene, FGFBP2.The three share a previously unreported heterozygous single base deletion in fibroblast growth factor binding protein type 2 (FGFBP2), which causes a frameshift in the coding sequence. The FGFBP2 protein is secreted by cytotoxic T-lymphocytes and binds fibroblast growth factor. The variant sequence in the FGFBP2 protein is predicted to form a disordered random coil rather than a helical-turn-helix structure, unable to adopt a stable conformation. The proband and the two sons had 5-10-fold higher numbers of circulating cytotoxic CD4 + T cells and plasmablasts compared to matched controls. The three members also share a homozygous missense common variant in FGFBP2 found in heterozygous form in ~40% of the population. This common variant was found in 73% of an independent, well characterized IgG4-RD cohort, showing enrichment in idiopathic IgG4-RD.The presence of a shared deleterious variant and homozygous common variant in FGFBP2 in the proband and sons strongly implicates this cytotoxic T cell product in the pathophysiology of IgG4-RD. The high prevalence of a common FGFBP2 variant in sporadic IgG4-RD supports the likelihood of participation in disease.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1002/mgg3.686\n\nView details for PubMedID 30993913\n\nAbstract\n\nBACKGROUND: This report documents the clinical characteristics, molecular grouping and outcome of young children with ependymoma treated prospectively on a clinical trial.METHODS: Fifty-four children (aged ≤ 3 years) with newly diagnosed ependymoma were treated on the SJYC07 trial with maximal safe surgical resection, 4 cycles of systemic chemotherapy, consolidation therapy using focal conformal radiation therapy (RT) (5-mm clinical target volume), and 6 months of oral maintenance chemotherapy. Molecular groups were determined by tumor DNA methylation using Infinium Methylation EPIC BeadChip and profiled on DKFZ/German molecularneuropathology2.0 classifier.RESULTS: One of the 54 study patients had metastases (CSF+) at diagnosis. Gross- or near-total resection was achieved in 48 (89%) patients prior to RT. At a median follow-up of 4.4 years (range, 0.2-10.3 years), 4-year progression-free survival (PFS) was 75.1% ± 7.2%, and overall survival was 92.6% ± 4.4%. The molecular groups showed no significant difference in PFS [4-year estimates: PF-EPN-A (42/54), 71.2% ± 8.3%; ST-EPN-RELA (8/54), 83.3% ± 17.0%; ST-EPN-YAP (4/54), 100%, p=0.22]. Subtotal resection prior to RT was associated with an inferior PFS compared to gross- or near-total resection (4-year PFS: 41.7% ± 22.5% vs. 79.0% ± 7.1%, p=0.024) as was PF-EPN-A group with 1q gain (p=0.05). Histopathologic grading was not associated with outcomes (classic vs anaplastic; p=0.89).CONCLUSIONS: In this prospectively treated cohort of young children with ependymoma, ST-EPN-RELA tumors had a favorable outcome than reported from retrospective data. Histological grade did not impact outcome. PF-EPN-A with 1q gain, and sub-total resection were associated with inferior outcomes.\n\nView details for PubMedID 30976811\n\nAbstract\n\nPhacomatosis pigmentovascularis (PPV) comprises a family of rare conditions that feature vascular abnormalities and melanocytic lesions that can be solely cutaneous or multisystem in nature. Recently published work has demonstrated that both vascular and melanocytic abnormalities in PPV of the cesioflammea and cesiomarmorata subtypes can result from identical somatic mosaic activating mutations in the genes GNAQ and GNA11. Here, we present three new cases of PPV with features of the cesioflammea and/or cesiomarmorata subtypes and mosaic mutations in GNAQ or GNA11. To better understand the risk of potentially occult complications faced by such patients we additionally reviewed 176 cases published in the literature. We report the frequency of clinical findings, their patterns of co-occurrence as well as published recommendations for surveillance after diagnosis. Features assessed include: capillary malformation; dermal and ocular melanocytosis; glaucoma; limb asymmetry; venous malformations; and central nervous system (CNS) anomalies, such as ventriculomegaly and calcifications. We found that ocular findings are common in patients with phacomatosis cesioflammea and cesiomarmorata. Facial vascular involvement correlates with a higher risk of seizures (p=.0066). Our genetic results confirm the role of mosaic somatic mutations in GNAQ and GNA11 in phacomatosis cesioflammea and cesiomarmorata. Their clinical and molecular findings place these conditions on a clinical spectrum encompassing other GNAQ and GNA11 related disorders and inform recommendations for their management.\n\nView details for PubMedID 30920161\n\nAbstract\n\nSPONASTRIME dysplasia is an autosomal-recessive spondyloepimetaphyseal dysplasia characterized by spine (spondylar) abnormalities, midface hypoplasia with a depressed nasal bridge, metaphyseal striations, and disproportionate short stature. Scoliosis, coxa vara, childhood cataracts, short dental roots, and hypogammaglobulinemia have also been reported in this disorder. Although an autosomal-recessive inheritance pattern has been hypothesized, pathogenic variants in a specific gene have not been discovered in individuals with SPONASTRIME dysplasia. Here, we identified bi-allelic variants in TONSL, which encodes the Tonsoku-like DNA repair protein, in nine subjects (from eight families) with SPONASTRIME dysplasia, and four subjects (from three families) with short stature of varied severity and spondylometaphyseal dysplasia with or without immunologic and hematologic abnormalities, but no definitive metaphyseal striations at diagnosis. The finding of early embryonic lethality in a Tonsl-/- murine model and the discovery of reduced length, spinal abnormalities, reduced numbers of neutrophils, and early lethality in a tonsl-/- zebrafish model both support the hypomorphic nature of the identified TONSL variants. Moreover, functional studies revealed increased amounts of spontaneous replication fork stalling and chromosomal aberrations, as well as fewer camptothecin (CPT)-induced RAD51 foci in subject-derived cell lines. Importantly, these cellular defects were rescued upon re-expression of wild-type (WT) TONSL; this rescue is consistent with the hypothesis that hypomorphic TONSL variants are pathogenic. Overall, our studies in humans, mice, zebrafish, and subject-derived cell lines confirm that pathogenic variants in TONSL impair DNA replication and homologous recombination-dependent repair processes, and they lead to a spectrum of skeletal dysplasia phenotypes with numerous extra-skeletal manifestations.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1016/j.ajhg.2019.01.007\n\nView details for PubMedID 30773277\n\nView details for PubMedCentralID PMC6408318\n\nAbstract\n\nTo characterize the phenotypic spectrum associated with GNAO1 variants and establish genotype-protein structure-phenotype relationships.We evaluated the phenotypes of 14 patients with GNAO1 variants, analyzed their variants for potential pathogenicity, and mapped them, along with those in the literature, on a three-dimensional structural protein model.The 14 patients in our cohort, including one sibling pair, had 13 distinct, heterozygous GNAO1 variants classified as pathogenic or likely pathogenic. We attributed the same variant in two siblings to parental mosaicism. Patients initially presented with seizures beginning in the first 3 months of life (8/14), developmental delay (4/14), hypotonia (1/14), or movement disorder (1/14). All patients had hypotonia and developmental delay ranging from mild to severe. Nine had epilepsy, and nine had movement disorders, including dystonia, ataxia, chorea, and dyskinesia. The 13 GNAO1 variants in our patients are predicted to result in amino acid substitutions or deletions in the GNAO1 guanosine triphosphate (GTP)-binding region, analogous to those in previous publications. Patients with variants affecting amino acids 207-221 had only movement disorder and hypotonia. Patients with variants affecting the C-terminal region had the mildest phenotypes.GNAO1 encephalopathy most frequently presents with seizures beginning in the first 3 months of life. Concurrent movement disorders are also a prominent feature in the spectrum of GNAO1 encephalopathy. All variants affected the GTP-binding domain of GNAO1, highlighting the importance of this region for G-protein signaling and neurodevelopment.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1111/epi.14653\n\nView details for PubMedID 30682224\n\nAbstract\n\nPaediatric low-grade glioma is the most common CNS tumour of childhood. Although overall survival is good, disease often recurs. No single universally accepted treatment exists for these patients; however, standard cytotoxic chemotherapies are generally used. We aimed to assess the activity of selumetinib, a MEK1/2 inhibitor, in these patients.The Pediatric Brain Tumor Consortium performed a multicentre, phase 2 study in patients with paediatric low-grade glioma in 11 hospitals in the USA. Patients aged 3-21 years with a Lansky or Karnofsky performance score greater than 60 and the presence of recurrent, refractory, or progressive paediatric low-grade glioma after at least one standard therapy were eligible for inclusion. Patients were assigned to six unique strata according to histology, tumour location, NF1 status, and BRAF aberration status; herein, we report the results of strata 1 and 3. Stratum 1 comprised patients with WHO grade I pilocytic astrocytoma harbouring either one of the two most common BRAF aberrations (KIAA1549-BRAF fusion or the BRAFV600E [Val600Glu] mutation). Stratum 3 comprised patients with any neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1)-associated paediatric low-grade glioma (WHO grades I and II). Selumetinib was provided as capsules given orally at the recommended phase 2 dose of 25 mg/m2 twice daily in 28-day courses for up to 26 courses. The primary endpoint was the proportion of patients with a stratum-specific objective response (partial response or complete response), as assessed by the local site and sustained for at least 8 weeks. All responses were reviewed centrally. All eligible patients who initiated treatment were evaluable for the activity and toxicity analyses. Although the trial is ongoing in other strata, enrolment and planned follow-up is complete for strata 1 and 3. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01089101.Between July 25, 2013, and June 12, 2015, 25 eligible and evaluable patients were accrued to stratum 1, and between Aug 28, 2013, and June 25, 2015, 25 eligible and evaluable patients were accrued to stratum 3. In stratum 1, nine (36% [95% CI 18-57]) of 25 patients achieved a sustained partial response. The median follow-up for the 11 patients who had not had a progression event by Aug 9, 2018, was 36·40 months (IQR 21·72-45·59). In stratum 3, ten (40% [21-61]) of 25 patients achieved a sustained partial response; median follow-up was 48·60 months (IQR 39·14-51·31) for the 17 patients without a progression event by Aug 9, 2018. The most frequent grade 3 or worse adverse events were elevated creatine phosphokinase (five [10%]) and maculopapular rash (five [10%]). No treatment-realted deaths were reported.Selumetinib is active in recurrent, refractory, or progressive pilocytic astrocytoma harbouring common BRAF aberrations and NF1-associated paediatric low-grade glioma. These results show that selumetinib could be an alternative to standard chemotherapy for these subgroups of patients, and have directly led to the development of two Children's Oncology Group phase 3 studies comparing standard chemotherapy to selumetinib in patients with newly diagnosed paediatric low-grade glioma both with and without NF1.National Cancer Institute Cancer Therapy Evaluation Program, the American Lebanese Syrian Associated Charities, and AstraZeneca.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1016/S1470-2045(19)30277-3\n\nView details for PubMedID 31151904\n\nAbstract\n\nWith the wide adoption of next-generation sequencing (NGS)-based genetic tests, genetic counselors require increased familiarity with NGS technology, variant interpretation concepts, and variant assessment tools. The use of exome and genome sequencing in clinical care has expanded the reach and diversity of genetic testing. Regardless of the setting where genetic counselors are performing variant interpretation or reporting, most of them have learned these skills from colleagues, while on the job. Though traditional, lecture-based learning around these topics is important, there has been growing need for the inclusion of case-based, experiential training of genomics and variant interpretation for genetic counseling students, with the goal of creating a strong foundation in variant interpretation for new genetic counselors, regardless of what area of practice they enter. To address this need, we established a genomics and variant interpretation rotation for Stanford's genetic counseling training program. In response to changes in the genomics landscape, this has now evolved into three unique rotation experiences, each focused on variant interpretation in the context of various genomic settings, including clinical laboratory, research laboratory, and healthy genomic analysis studies. Here, we describe the goals and learning objectives that we have developed for these variant interpretation rotations, and illustrate how these concepts are applied in practice.\n\nView details for PubMedID 30706981\n\nAbstract\n\nDistinct molecular subgroups of pediatric medulloblastoma confer important differences in prognosis and therapy. Currently, tissue sampling is the only method to obtain information for classification. Our goal was to develop and validate radiomic and machine learning approaches for predicting molecular subgroups of pediatric medulloblastoma.In this multi-institutional retrospective study, we evaluated MR imaging datasets of 109 pediatric patients with medulloblastoma from 3 children's hospitals from January 2001 to January 2014. A computational framework was developed to extract MR imaging-based radiomic features from tumor segmentations, and we tested 2 predictive models: a double 10-fold cross-validation using a combined dataset consisting of all 3 patient cohorts and a 3-dataset cross-validation, in which training was performed on 2 cohorts and testing was performed on the third independent cohort. We used the Wilcoxon rank sum test for feature selection with assessment of area under the receiver operating characteristic curve to evaluate model performance.Of 590 MR imaging-derived radiomic features, including intensity-based histograms, tumor edge-sharpness, Gabor features, and local area integral invariant features, extracted from imaging-derived tumor segmentations, tumor edge-sharpness was most useful for predicting sonic hedgehog and group 4 tumors. Receiver operating characteristic analysis revealed superior performance of the double 10-fold cross-validation model for predicting sonic hedgehog, group 3, and group 4 tumors when using combined T1- and T2-weighted images (area under the curve = 0.79, 0.70, and 0.83, respectively). With the independent 3-dataset cross-validation strategy, select radiomic features were predictive of sonic hedgehog (area under the curve = 0.70-0.73) and group 4 (area under the curve = 0.76-0.80) medulloblastoma.This study provides proof-of-concept results for the application of radiomic and machine learning approaches to a multi-institutional dataset for the prediction of medulloblastoma subgroups.\n\nView details for DOI 10.3174/ajnr.A5899\n\nView details for PubMedID 30523141\n\nAbstract\n\nBACKGROUND: Although paediatric astrocytoma has an excellent 5-year survival rate, survivors remain at risk for morbidity and late mortality. This study aimed to estimate the risk of late mortality, chronic conditions, poor health status and social impairment in ageing paediatric astrocytoma survivors.METHODS: We longitudinally evaluated 1182 5-year astrocytoma survivors diagnosed between 1970 and 1986 and 4023 siblings enrolled in a retrospective cohort study. Kaplan-Meier estimates of late mortality and cumulative incidence of serious chronic conditions were estimated. Cox regression models provided hazard ratios (HRs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for development of chronic conditions, and generalised linear models provided relative risks (RRs) of the poor health status and social outcomes.RESULTS: At 30 years from diagnosis, cumulative late mortality was 22.1% (CI 20.0-24.3%), primarily due to disease progression or recurrence. Compared with siblings, survivors were at increased risk of serious chronic conditions (HR 4.6, CI 3.8-5.5). Survivors reported higher rates of poor general health (RR 3.3, CI 2.8-3.8), poor mental health (RR 1.9, CI 1.7-2.1), functional impairment (RR 9.0, CI 7.7-10.5)and activity limitation (RR 3.6, CI 3.1-4.2) and lower rates of college graduation (RR 0.75, CI 0.69-0.82), marriage (RR 0.62, CI 0.58-0.66), employment (RR 0.75, CI 0.72-0.79)and household income ≥$40,000 (RR 0.68, CI 0.64-0.73). Even survivors without radiation exposure had elevated risk of chronic conditions, poor health statusand social impairment compared with siblings.CONCLUSIONS: Survivors of paediatric astrocytoma are at high risk for long-term complications of their disease and its treatment. They require lifelong monitoring for late effects.\n\nView details for PubMedID 30528801\n\nAbstract\n\nRecent evidence has implicated EFL1 in a phenotype overlapping Shwachman-Diamond syndrome (SDS), with the functional interplay between EFL1 and the previously known causative gene SBDS accounting for the similarity in clinical features. Relatively little is known about the phenotypes associated with pathogenic variants in the EFL1 gene, but the initial indication was that phenotypes may be more severe, when compared with SDS. We report a pediatric patient who presented with a metaphyseal dysplasia and was found to have biallelic variants in EFL1 on reanalysis of trio whole-exome sequencing data. The variant had not been initially reported because of the research laboratory's focus on de novo variants. Subsequent phenotyping revealed variability in her manifestations. Although her metaphyseal abnormalities were more severe than in the original reported cohort with EFL1 variants, the bone marrow abnormalities were generally mild, and there was equivocal evidence for pancreatic insufficiency. Despite the limited number of reported patients, variants in EFL1 appear to cause a broader spectrum of symptoms that overlap with those seen in SDS. Our report adds to the evidence of EFL1 being associated with an SDS-like phenotype and provides information adding to our understanding of the phenotypic variability of this disorder. Our report also highlights the value of exome data reanalysis when a diagnosis is not initially apparent.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1101/mcs.a003046\n\nView details for PubMedID 29970384\n\nView details for PubMedCentralID PMC6169826\n\nAbstract\n\nThe majority of undiagnosed diseases manifest with objective findings that warrant further investigation. The Undiagnosed Diseases Network (UDN) receives applications from patients whose symptoms and signs have been intractable to diagnosis; however, many UDN applicants are affected primarily by subjective symptoms such as pain and fatigue. We sought to characterize presenting symptoms, referral sources, and demographic factors of applicants to the UDN to identify factors that may determine application outcome and potentially differentiate between those with undiagnosed diseases (with more objective findings) and those who are less likely to have an undiagnosed disease (more subjective symptoms).We used a systematic retrospective review of 151 consecutive Not Accepted and 50 randomly selected Accepted UDN applications. The primary outcome was whether an applicant was Accepted, or Not Accepted, and, if accepted, whether or not a diagnosis was made. Objective and subjective symptoms and information on prior specialty consultations were collected from provider referral letters. Demographic data and decision data on network acceptance were gathered from the UDN online portal.Fewer objective findings and more subjective symptoms were found in the Not Accepted applications. Not Accepted referrals also were from older individuals, reported a shorter period of illness, and were referred to the UDN by their primary care physicians. All of these differences reached statistical significance in comparison with Accepted applications. The frequency of subspecialty consults for diagnostic purposes prior to UDN application was similar in both groups.The preponderance of subjective and lack of objective findings in the Not Accepted applications distinguish these from applicants that are accepted for evaluation and diagnostic efforts through the UDN. Not Accepted applicants are referred primarily by their primary care providers after multiple specialist consultations fail to yield answers. Distinguishing between patients with undiagnosed diseases with objective findings and those with primarily subjective findings can delineate patients who would benefit from further diagnostic processes from those who may have functional disorders and need alternative pathways for management of their symptoms.clinicaltrials.gov NCT02450851 , posted May 21st 2015.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1186/s12913-018-3458-2\n\nView details for PubMedID 30134969\n\nView details for PubMedCentralID PMC6106923\n\nAbstract\n\nSixty to seventy-five percent of individuals with rare and undiagnosed phenotypes remain undiagnosed after exome sequencing (ES). With standard ES reanalysis resolving 10-15% of the ES negatives, further approaches are necessary to maximize diagnoses in these individuals.In 38 ES negative patients an individualized genomic-phenotypic approach was employed utilizing (1) phenotyping; (2) reanalyses of FASTQ files, with innovative bioinformatics; (3) targeted molecular testing; (4) genome sequencing (GS); and (5) conferring of clinical diagnoses when pathognomonic clinical findings occurred.Certain and highly likely diagnoses were made in 18/38 (47%) individuals, including identifying two new developmental disorders. The majority of diagnoses (>70%) were due to our bioinformatics, phenotyping, and targeted testing identifying variants that were undetected or not prioritized on prior ES. GS diagnosed 3/18 individuals with structural variants not amenable to ES. Additionally, tentative diagnoses were made in 3 (8%), and in 5 individuals (13%) candidate genes were identified. Overall, diagnoses/potential leads were identified in 26/38 (68%).Our comprehensive approach to ES negatives maximizes the ES and clinical data for both diagnoses and candidate gene identification, without GS in the majority. This iterative approach is cost-effective and is pertinent to the current conundrum of ES negatives.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1038/s41436-018-0044-2\n\nView details for PubMedID 29907797\n\nAbstract\n\nYoung children with medulloblastoma have a poor overall survival compared with older children, due to use of radiation-sparing therapy in young children. Radiotherapy is omitted or reduced in these young patients to spare them from debilitating long-term side-effects. We aimed to estimate event-free survival and define the molecular characteristics associated with progression-free survival in young patients with medulloblastoma using a risk-stratified treatment strategy designed to defer, reduce, or delay radiation exposure.In this multicentre, phase 2 trial, we enrolled children younger than 3 years with newly diagnosed medulloblastoma at six centres in the USA and Australia. Children aged 3-5 years with newly diagnosed, non-metastatic medulloblastoma without any high-risk features were also eligible. Eligible patients were required to start therapy within 31 days from definitive surgery, had a Lansky performance score of at least 30, and did not receive previous radiotherapy or chemotherapy. Patients were stratified postoperatively by clinical and histological criteria into low-risk, intermediate-risk, and high-risk treatment groups. All patients received identical induction chemotherapy (methotrexate, vincristine, cisplatin, and cyclophosphamide), with high-risk patients also receiving an additional five doses of vinblastine. Induction was followed by risk-adapted consolidation therapy: low-risk patients received cyclophosphamide (1500 mg/m2 on day 1), etoposide (100 mg/m2 on days 1 and 2), and carboplatin (area under the curve 5 mg/mL per min on day 2) for two 4-week cycles; intermediate-risk patients received focal radiation therapy (54 Gy with a clinical target volume of 5 mm over 6 weeks) to the tumour bed; and high-risk patients received chemotherapy with targeted intravenous topotecan (area under the curve 120-160 ng-h/mL intravenously on days 1-5) and cyclophosphamide (600 mg/m2 intravenously on days 1-5). After consolidation, all patients received maintenance chemotherapy with cyclophosphamide, topotecan, and erlotinib. The coprimary endpoints were event-free survival and patterns of methylation profiling associated with progression-free survival. Outcome and safety analyses were per protocol (all patients who received at least one dose of induction chemotherapy); biological analyses included all patients with tissue available for methylation profiling. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT00602667, and was closed to accrual on April 19, 2017.Between Nov 27, 2007, and April 19, 2017, we enrolled 81 patients with histologically confirmed medulloblastoma. Accrual to the low-risk group was suspended after an interim analysis on Dec 2, 2015, when the 1-year event-free survival was estimated to be below the stopping rule boundary. After a median follow-up of 5·5 years (IQR 2·7-7·3), 5-year event-free survival was 31·3% (95% CI 19·3-43·3) for the whole cohort, 55·3% (95% CI 33·3-77·3) in the low-risk cohort (n=23) versus 24·6% (3·6-45·6) in the intermediate-risk cohort (n=32; hazard ratio 2·50, 95% CI 1·19-5·27; p=0·016) and 16·7% (3·4-30·0) in the high-risk cohort (n=26; 3·55, 1·66-7·59; p=0·0011; overall p=0·0021). 5-year progression-free survival by methylation subgroup was 51·1% (95% CI 34·6-67·6) in the sonic hedgehog (SHH) subgroup (n=42), 8·3% (95% CI 0·0-24·0%) in the group 3 subgroup (n=24), and 13·3% (95% CI 0·0-37·6%) in the group 4 subgroup (n=10). Within the SHH subgroup, two distinct methylation subtypes were identified and named iSHH-I and iSHH-II. 5-year progression-free survival was 27·8% (95% CI 9·0-46·6; n=21) for iSHH-I and 75·4% (55·0-95·8; n=21) for iSHH-II. The most common adverse events were grade 3-4 febrile neutropenia (48 patients [59%]), neutropenia (21 [26%]), infection with neutropenia (20 [25%]), leucopenia (15 [19%]), vomiting (15 [19%]), and anorexia (13 [16%]). No treatment-related deaths occurred.The risk-adapted approach did not improve event-free survival in young children with medulloblastoma. However, the methylation subgroup analyses showed that the SHH subgroup had improved progression-free survival compared with the group 3 subgroup. Moreover, within the SHH subgroup, the iSHH-II subtype had improved progression-free survival in the absence of radiation, intraventricular chemotherapy, or high-dose chemotherapy compared with the iSHH-I subtype. These findings support the development of a molecularly driven, risk-adapted, treatment approach in future trials in young children with medulloblastoma.American Lebanese Syrian Associated Charities, St Jude Children's Research Hospital, NCI Cancer Center, Alexander and Margaret Stewart Trust, Sontag Foundation, and American Association for Cancer Research.\n\nView details for PubMedID 29778738\n\nAbstract\n\nChildhood cancer is increased in those with birth defects, including those with congenital heart disease (CHD). Lymphoma risk is increased in children with CHD. This study analyzes the effect of CHD and CHD severity on childhood cancer risk.We analyzed cancer risk in a population-based cohort of children with and without CHD born between 1988 and 2004 by linking data from the California Birth Defects Monitoring Program with data from the California Cancer Registry. We compared cancer risk in children with and without CHD, excluding children with chromosomal anomalies.Of >3 million children in the birth cohort, 65,585 had birth defects (2%), 25,981 with CHD. Cancer occurred in 4,781 (0.15%) children, 43 (0.17%) with CHD. Cancer risk in CHD was increased (hazard ratio [HR]) 2.63, 95% CI: 1.95, 3.55). Leukemia was the most common cancer in those without CHD (1,722/4,738, 36%), central nervous system tumors were second (1,073/4,738, 23%), and lymphoma third (410/4,738, 9%). Among children with CHD, lymphoma and leukemia occurred with the same frequency (12/43, 28% for each). HR for lymphoma was 8.37 (CI: 4.71, 14.86) with CHD versus without. HR for leukemia was 2.05 (CI: 1.16, 3.61) with CHD versus without. CHD complexity was higher in lymphoma (3, interquartile range [IQR]: 2-3) than those with leukemia (1, IQR, 1-2; p < .02).Cancer risk is increased in children with CHD. Lymphoma risk is increased in CHD and is correlated with more complex CHD. These results suggest a shared developmental origin for CHD and lymphoma may be present.\n\nView details for PubMedID 30328285\n\nAbstract\n\nOBJECTIVE Pediatric spinal astrocytomas are rare spinal lesions that pose unique management challenges. Therapeutic options include gross-total resection (GTR), subtotal resection (STR), and adjuvant chemotherapy or radiation therapy. With no randomized controlled trials, the optimal management approach for children with spinal astrocytomas remains unclear. The aim of this study was to conduct a systematic review and meta-analysis on pediatric spinal astrocytomas. METHODS The authors performed a systematic review of the PubMed/MEDLINE electronic database to investigate the impact of histological grade and extent of resection on overall survival among patients with spinal cord astrocytomas. They retained publications in which the majority of reported cases included astrocytoma histology. RESULTS Twenty-nine previously published studies met the eligibility criteria, totaling 578 patients with spinal cord astrocytomas. The spinal level of intramedullary spinal cord tumors was predominantly cervical (53.8%), followed by thoracic (40.8%). Overall, resection was more common than biopsy, and GTR was slightly more commonly achieved than STR (39.7% vs 37.0%). The reported rates of GTR and STR rose markedly from 1984 to 2015. Patients with high-grade astrocytomas had markedly worse 5-year overall survival than patients with low-grade tumors. Patients receiving GTR may have better 5-year overall survival than those receiving STR. CONCLUSIONS The authors describe trends in the management of pediatric spinal cord astrocytomas and suggest a benefit of GTR over STR for 5-year overall survival.\n\nView details for PubMedID 30028275\n\nAbstract\n\nOBJECTIVE Primarily metastatic juvenile pilocytic astrocytoma (JPA) is rare, likely representing 2%-3% of all cases of JPA. Due to the rarity of primarily metastatic JPA, there is currently no standard treatment paradigm and the long-term outcomes are not fully known. The goal of this case series was to add to the current understanding of this disease process. METHODS The authors searched a comprehensive database of pediatric patients with brain and spinal cord tumors treated at Lucile Packard Children's Hospital from 1997 to 2016 and identified 5 patients with primarily metastatic JPA. A retrospective chart review was performed and details of the patients' treatment and clinical course were recorded for further analysis. RESULTS For the 5 patients with primarily metastatic JPA, the mean follow-up period was 12.3 years. All patients in our series had biopsies or subtotal resections and upfront treatment. Three patients were treated with chemotherapy alone, one was treated with chemotherapy and radiotherapy, and one was treated with radiotherapy alone. Four patients had stable disease after initial treatment, and one patient had multiple episodes of progressive disease but underwent successful salvage therapy and has had stable disease for 19 years. One patient died of an intracerebral hemorrhage 10 years following initial radiation treatment believed to be secondary to radiation vasculopathy. CONCLUSIONS Evaluation of the entire neuraxis should be performed in all instances of initial JPA diagnosis to properly assess for primarily metastatic disease. Many patients with primarily metastatic JPA will have stable disease after upfront treatment, although the higher rate of stable disease found in this series relative to other reports is likely secondary to the small sample size.\n\nView details for DOI 10.3171/2017.7.PEDS17168\n\nView details for PubMedID 29125440\n\nAbstract\n\nMany patients remain without a diagnosis despite extensive medical evaluation. The Undiagnosed Diseases Network (UDN) was established to apply a multidisciplinary model in the evaluation of the most challenging cases and to identify the biologic characteristics of newly discovered diseases. The UDN, which is funded by the National Institutes of Health, was formed in 2014 as a network of seven clinical sites, two sequencing cores, and a coordinating center. Later, a central biorepository, a metabolomics core, and a model organisms screening center were added.We evaluated patients who were referred to the UDN over a period of 20 months. The patients were required to have an undiagnosed condition despite thorough evaluation by a health care provider. We determined the rate of diagnosis among patients who subsequently had a complete evaluation, and we observed the effect of diagnosis on medical care.A total of 1519 patients (53% female) were referred to the UDN, of whom 601 (40%) were accepted for evaluation. Of the accepted patients, 192 (32%) had previously undergone exome sequencing. Symptoms were neurologic in 40% of the applicants, musculoskeletal in 10%, immunologic in 7%, gastrointestinal in 7%, and rheumatologic in 6%. Of the 382 patients who had a complete evaluation, 132 received a diagnosis, yielding a rate of diagnosis of 35%. A total of 15 diagnoses (11%) were made by clinical review alone, and 98 (74%) were made by exome or genome sequencing. Of the diagnoses, 21% led to recommendations regarding changes in therapy, 37% led to changes in diagnostic testing, and 36% led to variant-specific genetic counseling. We defined 31 new syndromes.The UDN established a diagnosis in 132 of the 382 patients who had a complete evaluation, yielding a rate of diagnosis of 35%.

Furthermore, there remains an unmet demand for an efficient survey of the wealth of information on human homologs in model organisms across numerous databases. To efficiently assess the large volume of publically available information, it is important to provide a concise summary of the most relevant information in a rapid user-friendly format. To this end, we created MARRVEL (model organism aggregated resources for rare variant exploration). MARRVEL is a publicly available website that integrates information from six human genetic databases and seven model organism databases. For any given variant or gene, MARRVEL displays information from OMIM, ExAC, ClinVar, Geno2MP, DGV, and DECIPHER. Importantly, it curates model organism-specific databases to concurrently display a concise summary regarding the human gene homologs in budding and fission yeast, worm, fly, fish, mouse, and rat on a single webpage. Experiment-based information on tissue expression, protein subcellular localization, biological process, and molecular function for the human gene and homologs in the seven model organisms are arranged into a concise output. Hence, rather than visiting multiple separate databases for variant and gene analysis, users can obtain important information by searching once through MARRVEL. Altogether, MARRVEL dramatically improves efficiency and accessibility to data collection and facilitates analysis of human genes and variants by cross-disciplinary integration of 18 million records available in public databases to facilitate clinical diagnosis and basic research.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1016/j.ajhg.2017.04.010\n\nView details for PubMedID 28502612\n\nView details for PubMedCentralID PMC5670038\n\nAbstract\n\nPatients' stories of their illnesses help bridge the divide between patients and providers, facilitating more humane medical care. Illness narratives have been classified into three types: restitution (expectation of recovery), chaos (suffering and loss), and quest (unexpected positive effect from illness). Undiagnosed patients have unique illness experiences and obtaining their narratives would provide insights into the medical and emotional impact of living with an undiagnosed illness. Adults and children with undiagnosed diseases apply to be evaluated by the Undiagnosed Diseases Network (UDN). Written illness narratives from 40 UDN applicants, including 20 adult probands who applied for themselves and 20 parents who applied for their children, were analyzed for: 1) narrative content and 2) narrative type.Narrative content: could be grouped into three themes: 1) Expectations of the UDN: the majority felt they had no further healthcare options and hoped the UDN would provide them with a diagnosis, with the adults expecting to return to their previously healthy life and the parents wanting information to manage their child's healthcare. 2) Personal medical information: the narratives reported worsening of symptoms and some offered opinions regarding the cause of their illness. The proband narratives had few objective findings, while parental narratives had detailed objective information. 3) Experiences related to living with their undiagnosed illness: frustration at being undiagnosed was expressed. The adults felt they had to provide validation of their symptoms to providers, given the lack of objective findings. The parents worried that something relevant to their child's management was being overlooked. Narrative type: All the narratives were of the chaos type, but for different reasons, with the probands describing loss and suffering and the parents expressing fear for their child's future. The parental narratives also had elements of restitution and quest, with acceptance of \"a new normal\", and an emphasis on the positive aspects of their child's illness which was absent from the probands.These narratives illustrate the chaos that coexists with being undiagnosed. The differences between the proband and parental narratives suggest that these two groups have different needs that need to be considered during their evaluation and management.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1186/s13023-017-0623-3\n\nView details for PubMedID 28416019\n\nView details for PubMedCentralID PMC5392939\n\nAbstract\n\nTo compare cerebral perfusion and diffusion in survivors of childhood posterior fossa brain tumor with neurologically normal controls and correlate differences with cognitive dysfunction.We analyzed retrospectively arterial spin-labeled cerebral blood flow (CBF) and apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) in 21 patients with medulloblastoma (MB), 18 patients with pilocytic astrocytoma (PA), and 64 neurologically normal children. We generated ANCOVA models to evaluate treatment effects on the cerebral cortex, thalamus, caudate, putamen, globus pallidus, hippocampus, amygdala, nucleus accumbens, and cerebral white matter at time points an average of 5.7 years after original diagnosis. A retrospective review of patient charts identified 12 patients with neurocognitive data and in whom the relationship between IQ and magnetic resonance imaging variables was assessed for each brain structure.Patients with MB (all treated with surgery, chemotherapy, and radiation) had significantly lower global CBF relative to controls (10%-23% lower, varying by anatomic region, all adjusted P < .05), whereas patients with PA (all treated with surgery alone) had normal CBF. ADC was decreased specifically in the hippocampus and amygdala of patients with MB and within the amygdala of patients with PA but otherwise remained normal after therapy. In the patients with tumor previously evaluated for IQ, regional ADC, but not CBF, correlated with IQ (R(2) = 0.33-0.75).The treatment for MB, but not PA, was associated with globally reduced CBF. Treatment in both tumor types was associated with diffusion abnormalities of the mesial temporal lobe structures. Despite significant perfusion abnormalities in patients with MB, diffusion, but not perfusion, correlated with cognitive outcomes.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1016/j.jpeds.2017.01.019\n\nView details for PubMedID 28187964\n\nAbstract\n\nThe ASXL genes (ASXL1, ASXL2, and ASXL3) participate in body patterning during embryogenesis and encode proteins involved in epigenetic regulation and assembly of transcription factors to specific genomic loci. Germline de novo truncating variants in ASXL1 and ASXL3 have been respectively implicated in causing Bohring-Opitz and Bainbridge-Ropers syndromes, which result in overlapping features of severe intellectual disability and dysmorphic features. ASXL2 has not yet been associated with a human Mendelian disorder. In this study, we performed whole-exome sequencing in six unrelated probands with developmental delay, macrocephaly, and dysmorphic features. All six had de novo truncating variants in ASXL2. A careful review enabled the recognition of a specific phenotype consisting of macrocephaly, prominent eyes, arched eyebrows, hypertelorism, a glabellar nevus flammeus, neonatal feeding difficulties, hypotonia, and developmental disabilities. Although overlapping features with Bohring-Opitz and Bainbridge-Ropers syndromes exist, features that distinguish the ASXL2-associated condition from ASXL1- and ASXL3-related disorders are macrocephaly, absence of growth retardation, and more variability in the degree of intellectual disabilities. We were also able to demonstrate with mRNA studies that these variants are likely to exert a dominant-negative effect, given that both alleles are expressed in blood and the mutated ASXL2 transcripts escape nonsense-mediated decay. In conclusion, de novo truncating variants in ASXL2 underlie a neurodevelopmental syndrome with a clinically recognizable phenotype. This report expands the germline disorders that are linked to the ASXL genes.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1016/j.ajhg.2016.08.017\n\nView details for PubMedID 27693232\n\nView details for PubMedCentralID PMC5065681\n\nAbstract\n\nTelomerase activation is critical in many cancers including central nervous system (CNS) tumors. Imetelstat is an oligonucleotide that binds to the template region of the RNA component of telomerase, inhibiting its enzymatic activity. We conducted an investigator-sponsored molecular biology (MB) and phase II study to estimate inhibition of tumor telomerase activity and sustained responses by imetelstat in children with recurrent CNS malignancies. In the MB study, patients with recurrent medulloblastoma, high-grade glioma (HGG) or ependymoma undergoing resection received one dose of imetelstat as a 2-h intravenous infusion at 285 mg/m(2), 12-24 h before surgery. Telomerase activity was evaluated in fresh tumor from surgery. Post-surgery and in the phase II study, patients received imetelstat IV (days 1 and 8 q21-days) at 285 mg/m(2). Imetelstat pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic studies were performed. Of two evaluable patients on the MB trial, intratumoral telomerase activity was inhibited by 95 % compared to baseline archival tissue in one patient and was inevaluable in one patient. Forty-two patients (40 evaluable for toxicity) were enrolled: 9 medulloblastomas, 18 HGG, 4 ependymomas, 9 diffuse intrinsic pontine gliomas. Most common grade 3/4 toxicities included thrombocytopenia (32.5 %), lymphopenia (17.5 %), neutropenia (12.5 %), ALT (7.5 %) and AST (5 %) elevation. Two patients died of intratumoral hemorrhage secondary to thrombocytopenia leading to premature study closure. No objective responses were observed. Telomerase inhibition was observed in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) for at least 8 days. Imetelstat demonstrated intratumoral and PBMC target inhibition; the regimen proved too toxic in children with recurrent CNS tumors.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1007/s11060-016-2189-7\n\nView details for Web of Science ID 000384563800007\n\nView details for PubMedID 27350411\n\nView details for PubMedCentralID PMC5288808\n\nAbstract\n\np53 is a promising target in human cancer. p28 is a cell-penetrating peptide that preferentially enters cancer cells and binds to both wild-type and mutant p53 protein, inhibiting COP1-mediated ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation. This results in increased levels of p53, which induces cell cycle arrest at G2/M. We conducted a phase I study to determine the maximum-tolerated dose (MTD) and describe the dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs) and pharmacokinetics (PKs) of p28 in children.Children aged 3-21 years with recurrent or progressive central nervous system tumors were eligible. Intravenous p28 was administered 3 times weekly for 4 consecutive weeks of a 6-week cycle at 4.16 mg/kg/dose (the adult recommended phase II dose) using a rolling-6 study design. Expression status of p53 was characterized by immunohistochemistry, and serum PK parameters were established on the second dose.Of the 18 eligible patients enrolled in the study, 12 completed the DLT monitoring period and were evaluable for toxicity. p28 was well-tolerated; 7 participants received ≥2 courses, and the most common adverse event attributed to the drug was transient grade 1 infusion-related reaction. PK analysis revealed a profile similar to adults; however, an increased area under the curve was observed in pediatric patients. High p53 expression in tumor cell nuclei was observed in 6 of 12 available tissue samples. There were no objective responses; 2 participants remained stable on the study for >4 cycles.This phase I study demonstrated that p28 is well-tolerated in children with recurrent CNS malignancies at the adult recommended phase II dose.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1093/neuonc/now047\n\nView details for PubMedID 27022131\n\nAbstract\n\nPosterior fossa ependymoma comprises two distinct molecular variants termed EPN_PFA and EPN_PFB that have a distinct biology and natural history. The therapeutic value of cytoreductive surgery and radiation therapy for posterior fossa ependymoma after accounting for molecular subgroup is not known.Four independent nonoverlapping retrospective cohorts of posterior fossa ependymomas (n = 820) were profiled using genome-wide methylation arrays. Risk stratification models were designed based on known clinical and newly described molecular biomarkers identified by multivariable Cox proportional hazards analyses.Molecular subgroup is a powerful independent predictor of outcome even when accounting for age or treatment regimen. Incompletely resected EPN_PFA ependymomas have a dismal prognosis, with a 5-year progression-free survival ranging from 26.1% to 56.8% across all four cohorts. Although first-line (adjuvant) radiation is clearly beneficial for completely resected EPN_PFA, a substantial proportion of patients with EPN_PFB can be cured with surgery alone, and patients with relapsed EPN_PFB can often be treated successfully with delayed external-beam irradiation.The most impactful biomarker for posterior fossa ependymoma is molecular subgroup affiliation, independent of other demographic or treatment variables. However, both EPN_PFA and EPN_PFB still benefit from increased extent of resection, with the survival rates being particularly poor for subtotally resected EPN_PFA, even with adjuvant radiation therapy. Patients with EPN_PFB who undergo gross total resection are at lower risk for relapse and should be considered for inclusion in a randomized clinical trial of observation alone with radiation reserved for those who experience recurrence.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1200/JCO.2015.65.7825\n\nView details for Web of Science ID 000381497000006\n\nView details for PubMedID 27269943\n\nView details for PubMedCentralID PMC4962737\n\nAbstract\n\nThis phase II trial evaluated"
