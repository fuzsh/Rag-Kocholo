        "text": "The Cuban Missile Crisis, October 1962 : A Reading List (2002)\n\nThis reading list is composed of titles cataloged in the Kennedy Library's printed materials collections. The Kennedy Library applies special local modifications to standard Library of Congress Subject Headings. This is so that researchers who use our archival holdings may focus more closely on titles that may contain important information about issues of the Kennedy administration. This list contains more than 225 titles indexed under the library's Cuban Missile Crisis heading. It does not include undergraduate student papers, novels, or general biographies of President Kennedy and other participants.Â\n\nNearly all of these publications are based on research conducted in the Kennedy Library's document collections, or on publications, microfilm collections, World Wide Web sites, and other institutions that contain copies or facsimiles of portions of Kennedy Library document holdings.\n\nAbel, Elie.
