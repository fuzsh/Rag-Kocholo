        "text": "THOMAS PYNCHON'S “Gravity's Rainbow” (Viking; cloth, $15; paper, $4.95) is one of the longest, darkest, most difficult and most ambitious novels in years. Its technical and verbal resources bring to Mind Melville, Faulkner and Nabokov and establish Pynchon's imaginative continuity with the great modernist movement of the early years of this century. “Gravity's Rainbow”is bone‐crushingly dense, compulsively elaborate, silly, obscene, funny, tragic, poetic, dull, inspired, horrific, cold and blasted.\n\nSet in England, France and Occuped Germany in 1944 and 1945, it is thick with references and flashbacks to World War I and Weimar, to England and America in the twenties and thirties, even to German South West Africa at the turn of the century. The central plot concerns the search for a V‐2 rocket, a symbol of the “sexual love of death” which Pynchon suggests is the driving paranoid force behind modern history. The novel bristles with allusions to literature, music, art, to military and industrial history, to pop culture, Pavlovian psychology.\n\nPynchon is capable of the most intricate literary structures — plots and counterplots and symbols and facts that twist in time and space. In his universe the characters become mechanical men whose trajectory toward death is touched by a manic and comic impulse or a vague freefloating anguish. For all its power and intelligence Pynchon's novel is a magnificent ruined necropolis, but its teetering structure towers above the surrounding literary shacks and hovels.\n\nDORIS LESSING, of all the postwar English novelists, is the foremost creative descendant of that “great tradition” which includes George Eliot and D. H. Lawrence. Her new novel “The Summer Before the Dark” (Knopf, $6.95) is her most artful exploration of her major themes: the relation of self and society, intelligence and feeling, madness and health, and, above all, the role of modern woman.\n\n“The Summer Before the Dark” is about a profound change in the life of a 45‐year‐old London housewife whose time of caring for her husband and children is over. Her family gone for the summer, she takes a job with an international service organization and discovers that mothering is marketable. She travels abroad and enters into an affair with a young man, only to find that he is deathly ill. She returns to London, ill herself, slowly pulls herself together, and at last goes home restored to health, wiser, more critical, and more at ease with the idea of growing old and eventually dying.\n\nThere is little about the outward trappings of the book that is new, nor is Doris Lessing interested in “writing well.” Yet, her moral intelligence and strong, unfettered feeling have produced a work on the border between traditional narrative and stream‐of‐consciousness. It is rare in contemporary fiction to find a work at once unironically sincere and still intelligent: in its subject and scale, “The Summer Before the Dark” confirms the sense that Doris Lessing is a plain‐speaking, somewhat awkward, but immensely attractive master of modem fiction.\n\nJOHN CLIVE has rescued a great man from Victorian pieties and patronizing historiography and restored him to heroic and human stature. “Macaulay: The Making of a Historian” (Knopf, $15) takes him from his birth in 1800, into a severe and repressive Evangelical milieu, to 1839, when he had just formulated the modem educational and legal systems of India. The portrait embraces half a dozen themes. There is the physically unattractive and personally abrasive Macaulay attaining extraordinary social success by dint of his rhetoric; Macaulay the competitor, forging a spectacular public career by his brilliant polemical writing and debates on the issues of the day; polymath Macaulay, voraciously appropriating the classics, history, literature and poetry of his tradition, and assuming an easy familiarity with its creators; Macaulay the prism of progressive 19th‐century political thought whose “principal endeavor,” Clive shows, “was to accommodate the new forces released by the French and Industrial revolutions”; and Macaulay the private man, his conscience dominated by a gloomy father, and his emotional life ruled by his dependence on the domestic attentions of his two sisters.\n\nThomas Babington Macaulay is an overwhelming figure. A biographer less gifted than Clive would have tried to charm the reader by relying on Macaulay's rhetorical excesses or impress him by condescending to Macaulay's historical judgments: Instead, Clive has written a surprisingly intimate life, psychologically sophisticated without being presumptuous. It it also a pleasure to read. ■\n\n©1973, The New York Times Co. All rights reserved.\n\n1973: An Apology and 38 Consolations\n\nACCORDING to an old French proverb, which I don't believe for a minute, “Everybody knows better than anybody.” The everybody in this case is the staff of the Book Review; the anybodies are the individual editors. Its time once more for our annual list of significant books, and the staff, after a series of pow‐wows solemn enough to gel jivatma, could agree only on the three titles you see on Page 1. Five years ago, we had twelve significant books; then ten; then seven; then five; now three. Does this say something morose about the decline of literary culture? Does it mean that the Lessing, the Pynchon and the Clive represent such a high order of achievement that all the other candidates look like midgets? No.\n\nWhat it says and means is that there is sand in the crankcase of our selection process. The anybodies were full of individual passions. The everybody, pious and bureaucratic, had to decide whether the list should balloon to 12 books, or we should stick to our chilly consensus. We stuck.\n\nI write in extenuation, and to apologize. There were dozens of books published this year that belong on the shelves and in the heads of civilized people. To begin, arbitrarily, with the literary memoirs, there was Lillian Hellman's “Pentimento.” While no one of the, sketches in “Pentimento” is quite up to the portraits of Dorothy Parker and Dashiell Hammett in her “Unfinished Woman,” the whole shines with a moral intelligence, a toughness of character, that inspires even as it entertains, and the prose is as precise as an electron microscope.\n\nCompared to “Pentimento,” Nigel Nicolson's “Portrait of a Marriage” is high‐class gossip, fascinating but ultimately evasive. Nicolson reconstructs the marriage of his father, Harold Nicolson, and his mother, Vita Sackville‐West, around portions of her diary. The diary is moving—an elegant style trying to accommodate a sexual obsession—but Nicolson the son scants his father's homosexuality and ducks away from discussing the effect of such parents on his own life.\n\nStyle triumphs over everything, even humanity, in the first volume of Malcolm Muggeridge's autobiography, “Chronicles of Wasted Time.” Not since the days of Evelyn Waugh has anyone written English as well as Muggeridge; he wears words like pave mirrors. But the world he lived through, wondrously populated, is buried under ice; he skates on flattened people, turns cold figures. We are left with God and Muggeridge, who have come to a mutual and ironic understanding on the deficiencies of modern life.\n\nLiterary biography was solid and functional, with Douglas Day on “Malcolm Lowry,” Michel Fabre on “The Unfinished Quest of Richard Wright” and Louis Sheaffer on “O'Neill,” the second and concluding volume of his Oedipal cycle. More compelling and heartbreaking were the biographies trying to escape from two fine collections of letters—Chekhov's to everybody, edited and splendidly introduced by Simon Karlinsky; and Kafka's “Letters to Felice.” Kafka's inner life is revealed to be about as wretched as one would have guessed from the stories. Karlinsky gives us a complicated Chekhov, one whose friendship must have made the world seem better place.\n\nCriticism had an excellent year. Lionel Trilling in “Sincerity and Authenticity” continued his Arnoklian critique of the self in a “world of circumstances,” of the quarrel between moral ideas anal social behavior, of art and life from Shakespeare through Jane Austen to modernism. Harold Bloom in “The Anxiety of Influence” attacks English literature with the alpenstock of Freud, suggesting that great poets fight out Oedipal battles with their literary fathers and grandfathers: Wordsworth rewriting Milton, T. S. Eliot rewriting Tennyson, etc. Alfred Kazin in “Bright Book of Life” takes up where he left off in “On Native Grounds,” looking at American literature since World War II. Malcolm Cowley in “A Second Flowering” returns to the writers of the twenties and thirties, to an era it sometimes seems Cowley himself created. Irving Howe is back with a new book of essays “The Critical Point,” as tough ‐ minded as ever. And there was another collection of Pauline Keel's movie reviews, “Deeper Into Movies”— although one misses some of the old angry jousting with other critics, Kael's engagement, too, is moral and her style fixes with a glittering eye the fault‐lines of pop culture.\n\nRaymond Williams in “The Country and the City” has written a re‐markable combination of literary and social history which is also part autobiography. His enormous ambition was to explore and analyze everything that has been written and thought about the country and the city in the last 3,000 years. The English specificity of much of this material makes the book daunting, but the attempt to bring the best of the humanities and social sciences to bear on individual and collective human experience is exhilarating.\n\nWhat are we to do with Daniel Bell? (According to Macaulay: “In. proportion as men know more, and think more, they look less at individuals and more at classes. They therefore make better theories and worse poems.”) “The Coming of PostIndustrial Society” is in so many ways an admirable book—the energy, the sheer amount of work it required, is staggering; the big picture is never allowed to dissolve into statistics; the intellectual push‐ups along the way are often invigorating (as when he demonstrates that Marx misread Hegel)—but it is also scandalously repetitious, not so much written as hacked out of the language, and it ends on a peculiar note of resignation and complacency. Our society, he says, lacks a transcendent ethos, things keep on evolving beyond systems, let's more or less settle for the status quo because my kind of meritocrat is in charge, counter‐cultists are jerks.\n\nWilson Carey McWilliams in “The Idea of Fraternity in America” is as ambitious as Bell. He writes a little more gracefully, but not much. His business is to define the idea of fraternity as it was handed over by the Enlightenment to the New England Puritans; to describe how it was done in by liberal individualism, the acquisitive ethic and alienationby‐technology; and to plead for a return, in theory at least, to old forms of community and kinship. Tough going, but in no way selfserving; and, unlike Bell, McWilliams never lets his generalizations get in the way of his passion for particulars.\n\nMaybe it seems perverse to bring Hunter Thompson, doctor of gonzo journalism, into the Bell‐MdWilliams group, but he's the appropriate wildman for their bookish picnic. Bell would loathe him. Look, he says in “Fear and Loathing on the Campaign Trail,” I was out there, following the politicians, and they lie, lie, lie! The paranoids are right. There is a conspiracy. Thompson, compulsive innocent, is higher on morality than anything else he smokes or drops.\n\nJohn Kenneth Galbraith is the gonzo journalist of the economy biz. “Economics and the Public Purpose” looks at planning (the captains of industry do it all the time, while indulging a public rhetoric of individualism and self‐sufficiency), “Convenient Social Virtue” (self exploitation) and the economics of womanhood. An important book that hasn't been discussed as thoughtfully as it deserves. Honorable mention, also, to John Brooks for “Me Go‐Go Years,” to Emma Rothschild for “Paradise Lost,” and to Robert Sherrill for “The Saturday Night Special” (to be reviewed next week).\n\nFiction? Two out of three on Page 1 isn't a bad year. There were good new novels by Graham Greene (“Honorary Consul”), Kurt Vonnegut (“Breakfast of Champions”), Joyce Carol Oates (“Do With Me What You Will”), Gore Vidal (“Burr”), Philip Roth (“The Great American Novel”), Thornton Wilder (“Theophilus North”), Thomas McGuane (“Ninety‐Two in the Shade”) and John Gardner (playing it straight for once in a pastoral called “Nickel Mountain”). There were disappointing efforts by Don DeLillo (“Great Jones Street”) and Marge Piercy (“Small Changes,” the great women's liberation novel that came out disheveled). There were strong collections of short stories by John Cheever (“The World of Apples,” our Chekhov), Bernard Malamud (“Rembrandt's Hat,” our Gogol) and I. B. Singer (“Crown of Feathers,” Singer's Singer.\n\nBut special mention should be made of Heinrich Boll's “Group Portrait With Lady”—the honest, humanist, anti‐authoritarian novel can still be written. And of “In the Days of Simon Stern” by Arthur Cohen—as though Thomas Mann had decided to write the Jewish novel. And of “The Wooden Shepherdess” by Richard Hughes—may we and he live long enough to see the conclusion of this series. Thomas Berger's “Regiment of Women” stands up as the months and lesser books recede —cold, brilliant, too long. And Stanley Elkin, with the three novellas in “Searches and Seizures,” has finally gotten his manic self and style under control.\n\nMy personal favorite is Kevin Starr's “Americans and the California Dream 1850–1915,” but I'm the only anybody here who grew up in California and knows how important the subject is.\n\nFinally: a copy of this list will be forwarded to Drake, North Dakota, so that the next time the school authorities there need something to burn in their furnace, they will know which books to look for in the lockers of their high‐school students.”■\n\nIN this CHRISTMAS ISSUE are reviews Of books about art, photography, sports, wine, cooking, movies, travel, and an annotated list of the year's best books"
