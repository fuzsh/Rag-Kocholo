To view a comprehensive ATA timeline and the Presidential Addresses/Reports that are in the archive, please visit the ATA Historical Timeline and click on the name of an ATA President to view their remarks (if available).\n\nSpecial thanks to David S. Cooper, MD, Valerie Galton, PhD, Connie Trump, PharmD, and Caroline T. Nguyen, MD for their leadership of this effort.\n\nE.P.

Lahey\n\nPresident, 1938\n\nFrank Howard Lahey Dr. Lahey grew up in Haverhill, Massachusetts and graduated from Harvard Medical School in 1904 and served as a surgical resident at Long Island Hospital in New York. He was a staff surgeon at Boston City Hospital and on the surgical faculty of Harvard and Tufts medical schools. After serving in the Army Medical Corps in World War I, he opened a practice in Boston that became the Lahey Clinic. He pioneered “two-stage surgery”, in which surgery was completed in two steps over a period of two to four days. This greatly improved surgical outcomes with a decrease in the mortality rate following thyroid surgery from 1-in-5 to 1-in-140.\n\nHe was appointed by President Roosevelt to serve on a special commission to report on medical standards during World War II. He was President of the American Medical Association, the American College of Surgeons, and the International Society of Surgeons. After his death in 1953, the Boston Globe stated that Dr. Lahey was “usually referred to as the outstanding general surgeon in the world today; at times of crisis he was never known to lose either his head or his nerve.” An article about his life published in the New England Journal of Medicine in 1953 stated: “His skill [brought] hundreds of surgeons from all parts of the world to see him operate and to share with him the knowledge and experience he was always ready to pass on to others.”\n\nJ.K.

He made the observation of neonatal thyroidal hyperactivity as a response to neonatal cooling and noted the high thyroxine secretion rate in infants as well as the changes in iodine metabolism and thyroxine production with age. He was the first to describe limited placental transfer of thyroxine, the low T3, high reverse T3 state of the fetus, and its rapid reversal secondary to increased type 1 deiodinase activity in the newborn period.\n\nAt Harbor-UCLA, he focused on hormone immunoassay development. Dr. Jean Dussault, his first fellow at UCLA, along with C. Laberge developed the first mass populations screening program for congenital hypothyroidism. Dr. Fisher chaired the Newborn Screening Committee of the American Thyroid Association which oversaw the collaborative monitoring and development of these programs. Due in large part to his work and contributions, newborn hypothyroid screening is now standard practice in the industrialized world and has virtually eliminated sporadic congenital hypothyroidism as a cause of mental retardation.\n\nHe was named to the Hall of Honor by the National Institute of Health in 2003 and honored with Marquis Who’s Who In America in 2016.\n\nJohn F.
