He founded the Sugar Ray Leonard Foundation, which is committed to funding life-changing research for pediatric type 1 and type 2 diabetes and helping children build early healthy habits.\n\nLeonard’s celebrated career includes three National Golden Gloves titles, two Amateur Athletic Union (AAU) championships, the 1975 Pan-American Games crown, and a Gold Medal in boxing at the 1976 Olympic Games. He’s the first boxer to win world titles in five different weight classes. His blinding speed, tremendous power, and palpable charm led to Leonard being a media favorite and dubbed the “new Muhammad Ali,” by the late Howard Cosell.\n\nIn addition to his boxing career, Leonard is a philanthropist, best-selling author, television personality and ringside analyst. He has always been devoted to his community and helping those in need and fulfills that passion through the Sugar Ray Leonard Foundation. Since its inception 14 years ago, the Foundation has funded countless research projects and offered life-changing patient care for children living with type 1 and type 2 diabetes. Furthermore, the Foundation is also committed to helping children lead healthier lives through diet and exercise and equipping them with the tools to be successful later on in life."
