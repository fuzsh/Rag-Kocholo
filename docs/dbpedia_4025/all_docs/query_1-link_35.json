        "text": "\"We can see it through\": Harris tries to appeal to Black voters at Essence Festival\n\nVice President Kamala Harris on Saturday outlined the stakes of the upcoming election, attempting to convince Black voters to once again deliver a win to the Biden-Harris ticket.\n\nHarris’ stop at the annual Black music and cultural festival comes as President Joe Biden’s campaign works to revive a corner of the coalition that helped propel him to the White House in 2020.\n\nHarris’ visit to New Orleans was part of her “Summer of Engagement,” a series of events this month aimed at key constituencies, including Black, women and young voters.\n\nThe vice president was not asked specifically about worries surrounding Biden’s reelection bid during the Saturday conversation, but since his shaky debate performance, she has repeatedly come to his defense. As CNN reported earlier this week, Harris and her staff have purposely snubbed most of the calls and texts coming their way and have reiterated she intends to stick by Biden’s side.\n\nRep. Gerry Connolly says Biden's debate performance was \"more than a bad night\"\n\nVirginia Democratic Rep. Gerry Connolly said that President Joe Biden’s debate performance was “more than a bad night” but stopped short of calling on the president to withdraw from the 2024 race.\n\n“I do believe that what happened at the debate was more than a bad night and that’s why that image is so indelible on so many minds,” Connolly told CNN’s Pamela Brown.\n\nThe White House has attempted to attribute Biden’s poor performance to a cold and to travel fatigue, but Connolly said it’s important “to know that that’s what it was and that’s all it was.”\n\nBiden further told ABC News Friday in his first televised interview since the debate that his performance was because he had a “bad night” and that it was not indicative of a larger problem.\n\nConnolly said the interview was “a good 22 minutes by and large,” but added that there were “some troubling aspects to that interview.”\n\n“Invoking god almighty as the only intervention that is going to dissuade him from going forward, I hope Joe Biden didn’t really mean that,” Connolly said.\n\nConnolly and the president worked closely when the congressman was a staffer on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee and the then-Sen. Biden was a member.\n\nJeffries calls virtual meeting Sunday for ranking members amid questions about Biden, source says\n\nHouse Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries called a virtual meeting on Sunday for Democratic committee ranking members amid questions about President Joe Biden’s viability as the 2024 standard-bearer, a Democratic lawmaker confirms.\n\nNBC first reported the meeting.\n\nBiden says he's \"completely ruling out\" getting out of the 2024 race\n\nPresident Joe Biden told reporters before boarding Air Force One that he is “completely ruling out” getting out of the 2024 race, remaining defiant in the wake of his debate performance sparking questions about his age and fitness for office.\n\n“Completely ruling that out,” Biden said from the tarmac in Madison, Wisconsin, when asked if he was going to drop out of the race.\n\nThe president also said he’s spoken to 20 members of Congress but did not name them. He said they are telling him to “stay in the race.”\n\nWhen asked about The Washington Post reporting that Sen. Mark Warner is working to get Senate Democrats to ask President Biden to step aside in the 2024 race, the president appeared to say that Warner was the “only one considering that.”\n\nBiden was also asked about Massachusetts Gov. Maura Healey’s statement urging Biden to “carefully evaluate” whether he remains Democrats’ best hope to defeat Trump. Biden said that Healey “didn’t say anything when I was in the room.”\n\nBiden was also asked how his ABC News interview went, and he told reporters he “thought it was a good interview.”\n\nWatch:\n\nVideo Ad Feedback\n\n87220193-886c-4662-ab50-8aad5c148d16.mp4\n\n01:20 - Source: cnn\n\nSenior administration official downplays Biden debate impact on upcoming NATO summit\n\nA US senior administration official on Friday downplayed the impact of President Joe Biden’s debate performance on his interaction with leaders as part of the administration’s preview of next week’s NATO summit.\n\n“Foreign leaders have seen Joe Biden up close and personal for the last three years. They know who they’re dealing with, and they know how effective he’s been,” the official said on a call with reporters.\n\nAs CNN reported Friday, there will “certainly be a spotlight,” in the words of one former US senior diplomat, on Biden at the NATO summit after his poor debate showing last week. Biden will be under immense pressure to perform well at the high-stakes gathering and show that he is still a viable competitor to former President Donald Trump, multiple diplomats told CNN.\n\nBiden will welcome the world leaders to Washington, DC, for the 75th anniversary summit on Tuesday evening when he and first lady Jill Biden host a commemorative event at the Mellon Auditorium, where the Washington Treaty, which formed the basis for NATO, was signed.\n\nDefiant Biden pledges to stay in the 2024 race: \"I'm the nominee of this party\"\n\nPresident Joe Biden defiantly pledged to remain in the 2024 race Friday despite growing worries from within the Democratic Party in the wake of his debate performance sparking questions about his age and fitness for office.\n\nBiden also took direct aim at Donald Trump, prompting cheers as he said that he beat Trump and will “beat him again in 2020” — the president seeming to reference the last time he went head-to-head with Trump, instead of 2024.\n\nThat message was punctuated by the choice of music as the president glad-handed with some rally attendees on stage: Tom Petty’s “I Won’t Back Down.”\n\nOne voter, Jeff Martinson, told CNN after the rally that seeing Biden speak Friday changed his calculus. Martinson, a Wisconsin voter, initially had some “concerns” about the president but came away from Friday’s rally saying the president gave a “very good showing.” Biden’s speech was forceful and energetic, though he made a few verbal slip-ups.\n\nAs Biden took the stage, a rally attendee appeared to unfurl a sign reading, “Pass the torch, Joe.” The sign was visible for a few moments before someone else tried to cover part of it with a Biden-Harris sign. The sign-holder crumpled up the sign after a few moments and stayed on the stage for the remainder of the president’s remarks.\n\nRFK Jr. resubmits signatures in Nevada after inaccurate guidance jeopardized original signatures\n\nRobert F. Kennedy Jr.’s campaign announced it resubmitted signatures in Nevada on Wednesday after the Nevada Secretary of State’s office provided the campaign with inaccurate information that could have potentially made their first batch of signatures invalid.\n\nKennedy’s campaign announced on Friday they submitted 30,000 additional signatures earlier this week to the state office as they fight to qualify in the key battleground state. Independent presidential candidates must submit 10,095 signatures to qualify for Nevada’s ballot.\n\nSome background: In March, the campaign announced it had submitted 15,000 signatures to Nevada’s elections office. Later that month, Nevada Secretary of State Francisco Aguilar’s office admitted it “provided inaccurate guidance” to Kennedy’s campaign about laws governing signature collecting in the state. Presidential candidates must have their vice-presidential nominee on ballot access petitions in Nevada. Kennedy did not announce his running mate Nicole Shanahan until late March, weeks after the campaign submitted its first batch of signatures.\n\nLast month, the Kennedy campaign filed a lawsuit against Aguilar seeking an injunction to block him from enforcing the state law requiring independent candidates to name their running mate prior to collecting signatures. In a statement, Kennedy campaign senior counsel Paul Rossi made no indication they would drop the lawsuit against Aguilar despite submitting additional signatures.\n\nRFK Jr. gains ballot access in New Mexico\n\nIndependent candidate Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has qualified for the presidential ballot in New Mexico, the state’s elections office confirmed Friday, marking the eighth state where Kennedy has gained ballot access.\n\nKennedy submitted over 11,000 signatures to the New Mexico Secretary of State’s Office on Monday, well over the 3,562 valid signatures required by independent presidential candidates to gain ballot access in the state.\n\nA spokesperson for the office confirmed Kennedy’s petition is valid, pointing to a list on the secretary of state’s website of potential candidates indicating Kennedy has qualified.\n\nKennedy has previously qualified in Michigan, California, Tennessee, Utah, Oklahoma, Hawaii and Delaware. With the addition of New Mexico, he is eligible to receive 105 electoral votes.\n\nHe has also submitted petitions or completed signature gathering in several other states.\n\nSen. Mark Warner looks to align Democratic senators amid questions over Biden’s future\n\nAn effort is underway by Virginia Sen. Mark Warner to get Senate Democrats on the same page about the future of President Joe Biden’s reelection bid, sources told CNN.\n\nWarner, who is taking on a leadership role in the effort, is reaching a place where he thinks it is time for Biden to suspend his reelection campaign, a source familiar with his efforts told CNN.\n\nWarner’s meeting with his colleagues, first reported by The Washington Post, is expected to take place Monday, according to a source familiar with the planning.\n\nWarner declined CNN’s request for comment.\n\nHis spokeswoman, Rachel Cohen, neither confirmed nor denied the senator’s efforts in a statement to the Post earlier Friday.\n\n“Like many other people in Washington and across the country, Senator Warner believes these are critical days for the president’s campaign, and he has made that clear to the White House,” Cohen said.\n\nBiden at campaign rally: \"I am running and gonna win again\"\n\nPresident Joe Biden began his campaign rally in Madison, Wisconsin, by wishing the crowd a happy Fourth of July and reiterating his plans to stay in the presidential race.\n\n“You probably heard we had a little debate last week,” he said. “Can’t say it was my best performance. But ever since then, there’s been a lot of speculation. ‘What’s Joe going to do? Is he going to stay in the race? Is he going to drop out? What’s he going to do?’”\n\nBiden spoke forcefully and was notably energetic throughout his speech, though he did have a couple of verbal slip-ups.\n\nSome Biden supporters attending Wisconsin rally express \"concerns\" about the president\n\nSome Biden supporters attending his Wisconsin rally say they have “concerns” about President Joe Biden leading the Democratic ticket in the wake of his debate performance – even as others say he’s up to the job.\n\nJeff Martinson, a supporter of the president in 2020, told CNN that he has “concerns” about the president’s ability to conduct a campaign. Martinson added that he hasn’t seen the president come out “forcefully enough to assert his capabilities” in past week after the president’s poor performance at CNN’s presidential debate.\n\nAnother voter CNN spoke to said she thinks Biden is the “right man for the job” and does not think that he should step aside.\n\n“I think he’s the right man for the job,” Andrea Straus told CNN.\n\nShana Verstegen from Madison, Wisconsin, told CNN that she thought the debate was “hard to watch” and made “excuses” for the president. The fitness professional, who brought her kids to Friday’s rally, conceded that if the American people are feeling nervous, then she is a “little nervous too.”\n\nDemocratic lawmaker says next week will be \"critical\" for Biden as he holds high-stakes public events\n\nDemocratic Rep. Gerry Connolly of Virginia said on Friday that the next week will be “critical” and “very consequential” for President Joe Biden to put to rest — or not — the questions that have arisen since his debate performance.\n\nConnolly said the next week will be “very telling,” and he thinks Biden has to show “mental acuity, mental alertness, humor, spontaneity.”\n\nWhen asked if Biden gives the party the best shot to win in November, Connolly said, “I don’t think we know that yet. I think everybody is waiting for the dust to settle from the aftermath of the debate.”\n\nHow Trump is quietly planning around Biden’s uncertain future\n\nFor much of the past year, Donald Trump and his allies have speculated that Joe Biden would not end up as the Democratic presidential nominee – suggesting without evidence that he would step down before the convention and be replaced by another candidate.\n\nNow, with Biden facing an increasingly uncertain political future amid the fallout from his shaky debate performance, Republicans are trying to determine what the Democratic incumbent stepping aside would actually mean for the Trump campaign. And some believe the path back to the White House would likely be easier with Biden at the top of the ticket.\n\nTrump and his allies have relished the extended spotlight on Biden this week, with the former president making the rare decision to lay low at his New Jersey club and allow Biden to be the story. Trump has no public events on his schedule, and his campaign surprised some aides and advisers by telling them to enjoy the Fourth of July holiday.\n\nMeanwhile, campaign advisers and key allies have been calling reporters and friendly Democrats, hunting for any clues into what might happen next should Biden ultimately walk away from his reelection bid.\n\nUntil now, the campaign and its allies have largely ignored Vice President Kamala Harris in waging their attacks against the Biden administration. But there are signs that posture is changing. On Wednesday, a super PAC aligned with Trump, MAGA, Inc., launched its opening salvo against Harris by attacking her oversight of Biden’s border policies in an email. It asked if Harris is “The Best They Got?”\n\nKeep reading here about Trump’s strategy.\n\nWhite House defends Biden’s plans to get more sleep, saying he is \"striking a balance\"\n\nThe White House defended President Joe Biden’s latest comments on his schedule, arguing that the president is trying to strike a balance.\n\nCNN previously reported that Biden told Democratic governors during a meeting at the White House this week that part of his plan going forward is to get more sleep and stop planning events after 8 p.m.\n\nBiden’s comment to the governors, which left some in the room frustrated, came as he tried to reassure allies on the heels of his halting debate performance last week. A Biden campaign aide argued that, as well as doing debate prep in the week after his two trips to Europe, Biden was engaged in hours of official work in addition to the hours of campaign work.\n\n“He said he understands about striking the right balance,” Jean-Pierre said, when pressed if there will be a change in the future. “He is human, just like we all are, but it is a 24/7 job. It is 365 days a week that doesn’t change.”\n\nAmid questions about the president’s schedule, the Biden campaign announced what it cast as an “aggressive travel schedule” in July that includes visiting battleground states.\n\nAnalysis: What happened to Lyndon B. Johnson, the last president not to run for a second term\n\nPresident Joe Biden, who is dogged by questions about his acuity, has privately acknowledged that the next few days are a critical test of his reelection campaign, according to CNN’s reporting earlier this week.\n\nHe remains publicly defiant and insists he will remain in the race. But he would not be the first president to step aside rather than seek reelection if he ultimately makes that decision.\n\nMost recently, in 1968, Lyndon B. Johnson shocked the country when he made the surprise announcement that he would not run at the end of an Oval Office speech on his plan to limit US military operations in Vietnam. Here’s part of that address:\n\nWith America’s sons in the fields far away, with America’s future under challenge right here at home, with our hopes and the world’s hopes for peace in the balance every day, I do not believe that I should devote an hour or a day of my time to any personal partisan causes or to any duties other than the awesome duties of this office – the Presidency of your country. Accordingly, I shall not seek, and I will not accept, the nomination of my party for another term as your President.\n\nNearly 60 years old when he made that speech, Johnson looked much older. He would die of a sudden heart attack in 1973 at 64, before eligibility for retirement programs like Medicare, which he signed into law, and Social Security, which he expanded.\n\nBy the time he bowed out of the race, Johnson, unlike Biden, was facing multiple challenges for the Democratic nomination in the spring of 1968. Racial strife in the US, paired with a country fractured over the war in Vietnam, hurt Johnson’s popularity. In early 1968, the Tet offensive in Vietnam showed Communist forces there to be must stronger than the US military had claimed, and American casualties in the war mounted.\n\nRead more about Johnson’s decision not to run for a second term.\n\nHere's why ABC accelerated the timing of Biden's interview to air Friday night\n\nWhen ABC News first secured its exclusive interview with President Joe Biden, the rollout plan was paint-by-numbers. But these are not normal times. So ABC accelerated its timing.\n\nAnchor George Stephanopoulos is expected to interview Biden on Friday in Wisconsin, the president’s first extended interview with a major media network since his disastrous debate performance last week that has led many in the Democratic Party to question whether Biden should be the nominee.\n\nABC had originally planned to release clips Friday evening, and the whole interview would air during Stephanopoulos’ Sunday morning show, “This Week With George Stephanopoulos.”\n\nRecognizing this extraordinary political moment, however, ABC News realized it would be uncomfortable to hold on to the interview for nearly two days, according to a source familiar with the matter. ABC may have been accused, fairly or not, of hiding something, and the news cycle is moving at a rapid pace.\n\nA network source told CNN that because the story is of “national interest,” ABC decided to make it a “primetime special” to air the same day the interview is taking place. When ABC executives agreed to a time slot for the interview on Friday evening, they notified the White House and changed course, the source said.\n\nThe interview will air in its entirety on Friday evening at 8 p.m. ET, and a full transcript will be posted as well. The interview will be a critical opportunity for voters to be able to gauge Biden’s abilities in an unscripted, high-stakes setting. It’s not clear how long the interview will end up lasting, but ABC affiliates have it slated for a 30-minute special.\n\nRead more on ABC’s interview here.\n\nBiden says he can still beat Trump\n\nPresident Joe Biden projected confidence ahead of a critical day for his political future, telling reporters, “Yes,” he can still beat former President Donald Trump in November.\n\nAsked whether he was ready for today, Biden offered a thumbs up before climbing the steps. He ignored a question about whether it was time for him to drop out.\n\nHe waved at the top.\n\nTrump claims he knows \"nothing\" about Project 2025 and that he disagrees with some of it\n\nFormer President Donald Trump on Friday claimed he knew “nothing” about Project 2025, the sweeping policy plan and transition project run by the conservative think tank The Heritage Foundation, but also said he disagreed with some parts of it.\n\nThe Biden campaign has been taking aim at Project 2025, which is a right-wing plan to dramatically overhaul and reshape the federal government. Project 2025 is not Trump’s official policy platform, and the Trump campaign has previously distanced itself from it and said that any outside groups do not speak for Trump and his campaign.\n\nFor Vance or Rubio to become a Trump vice president pick, they need to overcome their own state governors\n\nThe two Republican senators on Donald Trump’s shortlist for potential running mates may have to overcome some political baggage in the form of their home-state governors to get the nod.\n\nIf Trump picks either Marco Rubio of Florida or JD Vance of Ohio, the senator’s successor would be chosen by a Republican governor who has engaged in high-profile clashes with the former president.\n\nIn Florida, that honor would go to Gov. Ron DeSantis, a onetime ally viewed more recently by Trump as “disloyal” for launching a rival presidential campaign. If Vance is picked, his Ohio replacement would be appointed by Gov. Mike DeWine, who has rarely seen eye-to-eye with the former president.\n\nIt’s a fact that allies of Vance and Rubio are acutely aware of in the intensifying final days leading up to Trump’s announcement — and one they are trying to mitigate against by insisting the other senator has it worse. Pro-Rubio forces have suggested to those who will listen that DeWine would likely replace Vance with someone unaligned with Trump’s MAGA movement.\n\n“It would be a step backwards for the America First agenda,” one such Rubio backer said in making the case against Vance.\n\nRead more about the hurdles potential vice president candidates face.\n\nMost Americans don’t expect Trump to concede if he loses election, according to CNN poll\n\nMost Americans think that former President Donald Trump will not concede if he loses the presidential election in November, according to a new CNN poll conducted by SSRS. And despite the vast majority of Americans agreeing that the loser of an election has an obligation to accept the results and concede, only about half of registered voters see Trump’s false claims that he won the 2020 presidential election as a reason to vote against him in 2024.\n\nA 78% majority of Americans say they think that President Joe Biden will accept the results and concede if he loses the election this November.\n\nBut roughly 7 in 10 Americans (71%) doubt that Trump will concede if he loses again in November, while only 28% believe he will. Half of Republicans now say they think Trump would concede a loss, up from 41% in a January poll taken amid the primary season. Among the public overall, doubts that Trump would concede are little changed from January, but remain heightened compared with October 2020, when a smaller 58% majority of US adults said they didn’t expect him to concede if he lost the 2020 election.\n\nIn CNN’s June presidential debate, Trump refused to state unequivocally that he would accept this year’s election results, twice deflecting the question before saying he would do so “if it’s a fair and legal and good election” and repeating claims about election fraud. There is no evidence of election fraud that would have altered the outcome of the 2020 election.\n\nRead more about the poll here.\n\nHere's what voters see as important differences between Biden and Trump\n\nIf there’s one thing that American voters overwhelmingly agree on, it’s that this year’s presidential election presents a stark choice. In the latest CNN poll conducted by SSRS, 91% of registered voters say they see important differences between President Joe Biden and former President Donald Trump, dwarfing even the 77% of voters who said last fall that there were significant divides between the Democratic and Republican parties. Even among the so-called “double haters” – those with unfavorable views of both Biden and Trump – only 20% say that the two candidates are pretty much the same.\n\nTo get a broader image of how voters view the stakes of the election, CNN asked voters to name the single most important difference they saw between the two candidates. As the results highlight, the contrasts that most stick in voters’ minds are often not about policy issues at all. While some voters mentioned the topics that often top voters’ lists this year when asked to pick their most important issues – the economy, immigration or a commitment to democracy – others were more focused on character and personal traits, with honesty, ability to handle the job and perceived motivations among the traits most mentioned as distinguishing factors.\n\nAmong those who saw significant differences between Biden and Trump, the most frequently mentioned distinctions were honesty and integrity (17%), ability to handle the job or mental fitness (15%), love for the country or patriotism (10%), perceived self-serving or egotistical motivations (10%) and effectiveness or performance in office (8%). Another 8% talked about protecting democracy or the Constitution, with 7% mentioning immigration and 6% the economy. Voters’ answers to the questions often spanned multiple topics, and a not insignificant share offered vaguer answers, with some simply noting that each candidate’s beliefs or policies were different.\n\nRead more about what the polling data shows.\n\nBiden will participate in first televised interview today since presidential debate\n\nThe ABC News interview with President Joe Biden will now air “in its entirety as a primetime special” on Friday evening at 8 p.m. ET, the network announced Wednesday evening.\n\nThe high-profile interview will be the first televised interview the president is expected to participate in since his poor showing at last week’s CNN presidential debate.\n\nThe first clip will still air on “World News Tonight” on Friday evening.\n\nBiden will be interviewed by ABC’s George Stephanopoulos on the campaign trail earlier in the day and ABC News says a transcript of the unedited interview will also be made available on Friday.\n\nCNN’s MJ Lee reported Wednesday that the president privately acknowledged the next stretch of days is critical (including the president’s interview with ABC) to whether he can save his reelection bid, making clear to an ally that he understands what would prompt him to accept: “It’s just not working.”\n\nOriginally, ABC said it would air parts of Stephanopoulos’ interview with Biden on Friday at 6:30 p.m. ET on “World News Tonight with David Muir.” The extended interview would have aired Sunday on “This Week with George Stephanopoulos.”\n\nAt last week’s debate, Biden struggled to complete sentences at times and often looked lost as former President Donald Trump pumped out falsehoods, urgently raising questions about Biden’s age and ability to serve a second term.\n\nCNN’s Hadas Gold contributed reporting to this post.\n\nBiden campaign acknowledges ABC interview stakes are high, while managing expectations\n\nAs President Joe Biden prepares for his primetime interview Friday, Biden campaign officials are managing expectations, acknowledging the president’s frequent verbal missteps, while also recognizing the stakes are high.\n\nCNN previously reported that advisers were weighing a high-profile interview in hopes of showing that Biden’s energetic North Carolina rally the day after debate was not simply a fluke.\n\nBut the campaign is clear-eyed that the president has long been prone to verbal slips and diversions. Close observers have noted that Biden’s speech and delivery have lost some pacing, crispness, and focus in the years since he took office.\n\nFriday marks a critical test of whether Biden can demonstrate his fitness and capacity to serve another four years, and aides acknowledge that Biden’s performance in the ABC interview, which will tape Friday afternoon and air in the evening, will be highly scrutinized.\n\nWhile limited, the president’s previous interviews have often been focused on domestic policy and foreign policy. This interview will likely strike a different tone, focused squarely on his viability as a candidate.\n\nDemocrats start moving to Harris as Biden digs in\n\nAmid the ongoing fallout from Joe Biden’s debate performance, talk in many top Democratic circles has already moved to who Kamala Harris’ running mate would be.\n\nThat’s how certain a widening group of leading party officials, operatives and donors are that the president’s slow start to salvage his campaign just won’t work, with several close allies skeptical that he is up to the reelection campaign he has pledged to stay in, based on CNN’s conversations with two dozen Democratic politicians and operatives.\n\nBiden always says not to compare him to the almighty, but to the alternative. That’s exactly what a growing number of Democrats looking at Harris are doing.\n\nFor her part, the vice president and her staff have deliberately ignored most of the calls and texts coming their way, remaining insistently on message about both her support for Biden and her pride in sticking with him.\n\nBut Harris has already made some changes: Only after last week’s debate did her office update her schedule to put her with Biden for the Fourth of July picnic and fireworks. She has not attended the picnic before, instead keeping to her own Independence Day tradition of making a stop at a local fire station. And after Democratic governors rejected the White House’s initial offer to have her speak to them instead of Biden, she was also added to the meeting and closed it with a speech urging unity and sticking with the president.\n\nThat’s her keeping close to Biden — but it’s also Biden keeping her close.\n\nDespite her efforts, Democratic politics has started to reshape around her — as has former President Donald Trump’s campaign, which has already begun attacking Harris.\n\nSeveral officials told CNN they have begun chiding donors who complain that they don’t think she can win, arguing that they need to stop and get on board with her. Other officials and advisers said plans are underway to convince Biden to immediately throw his support behind Harris, release his Democratic delegates and ask them to follow his choice. Former presidents and party leaders would then follow suit, they believe, in hopes of avoiding a contentious fight to lead the Democratic ticket.\n\nRead the full story.\n\nBiden's campaign says he will lead \"aggressive travel schedule\" in July\n\nPresident Joe Biden will lead an “aggressive travel schedule” in July that will take him, the vice president, first lady, and second gentlemen to every battleground state, his reelection campaign said.\n\nThat announcement comes as the president faces questions about his political future and fitness for office after his poor performance at last week’s CNN presidential debate.\n\nSeveral Biden allies have publicly called on the president to accelerate his public schedule, including sitting for more interviews and participating in more unscripted moments, as he looks to convince voters and top officials in his own party that he’s up for a second term.\n\nThe ramped-up travel schedule will begin after the president spends next week in Washington, DC, for the NATO summit.\n\nWhile the Republican National Convention is underway, the president is expected to deliver remarks at two conferences in the battleground state of Nevada as he looks to appeal to Black and Latino voters amid some signs of lagging support with the two key constituencies even prior to the debate.\n\nThe campaign also said the president would continue his push into “critical blue wall states” in July. The campaign said the president will try to engage in “frequent off-the-cuff moments” this month and focus on interviews with “national, local, and constituency media,” including Black and Latino outlets.\n\nSeveral of the president’s allies have encouraged him to ramp up his campaigning and public messaging efforts to show voters he’s up for continuing in the presidential race.\n\nAnalysis: Pressure mounts on Biden ahead of critical interview\n\nEvery time things look like they can’t get worse for President Joe Biden, they seem to do just that.\n\nThe Fourth of July holiday brought no respite after Biden’s disastrous debate performance, which raised concerns about his capacity to serve a second term and pitched his reelection campaign into an existential crisis.\n\nAnd the scrutiny will only increase on Friday with the airing of an ABC interview that will provide a critical test of the president’s ability to stem panic in the Democratic Party exactly four months from Election Day.\n\nThe latest effort by the White House to quell the controversy is already disintegrating. The New York Times and CNN reported Thursday that the president had told Democratic state governors that he needed more sleep and that he’d no longer schedule events after 8 p.m., three sources briefed on the comments said. His reasoning frustrated several governors who’d come to the White House to seek reassurance about Biden’s condition, sources said. And it is likely to raise further questions about whether the president is fit to fully execute the duties of the presidency now, let alone toward the end of a second term, when he would be 86. Biden’s comment may also infuriate Democrats who want him to be far more visible and to throw himself into spontaneous, unscripted events to prove his stamina and sharpness.\n\nBut Biden issued another defiant warning that he has no intention of stepping down, a day after several allies privately said he’s aware that the coming days could be critical for his hopes of staying in the race. “I’m not going anywhere,” Biden told military families gathered to watch July Fourth fireworks at the White House.\n\nRead the full analysis.\n\nTrump attacks Biden and Harris in 4th of July message\n\nFormer President Donald Trump on Thursday attacked President Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris in his Fourth of July message on Truth Social.\n\nTrump called Harris “Laffin’ Kamala Harris,” and said she was “our potential new Democrat Challenger,” after Biden’s world was thrown into chaos following the president’s shaky debate performance.\n\nBiden has privately acknowledged next stretch of days are critical for his reelection bid\n\nPresident Joe Biden has privately acknowledged that the next stretch of days are critical to whether he can save his reelection bid for president, making clear to an ally Tuesday that he understands what would prompt him to accept: “It’s just not working.”\n\n“He sees the moment. He’s clear-eyed,” this person told CNN.\n\nThere is no ambiguity for the president about what potential series of events in the coming weeks would ultimately prompt him to acknowledge that his attempt to make amends for last week’s disastrous debate on CNN aren’t working, according to this ally.\n\nIt would be a scenario in which “the polls are plummeting, the fundraising is drying up, and the interviews are going badly,” they said. “He’s not oblivious.”\n\nIn response to a request for comment, White House spokesman Andrew Bates said that “it is false to suggest there is any openness to ending the campaign.”\n\nIn the days since Biden’s stunningly halting debate showing, Democrats across the country have expressed grave concern. Some elected officials have even begun to publicly call on Biden to drop out for the good of the party.\n\nThe New York Times reported separately on Wednesday that Biden acknowledged that he may not be able to save his campaign if he does not perform well in public events over the next several days. The White House and Biden’s campaign have denied that reporting.\n\nIn Tuesday’s private conversation, Biden was also “chastened” as he “blamed himself” – not his staff – for the debate performance.\n\nRead more of this reporting here.\n\nYoung voters: What is driving you to the polls? We want to hear about it\n\nYoung voters could help shape the 2024 election.\n\nIf you’re a younger voter, CNN wants to hear your thoughts on what issues are driving you to the polls and what you care about ahead of the election\n\nShare your experiences with us in the form below and we may follow up for a CNN story:\n\nBiden and Trump both want inflation to come down. The latest data shows it's trending in the right direction\n\nAmericans have been dealing with above-average — and, for a good stretch, decades-high — inflation for going on three years now. The strong and resilient job market helped households stay afloat, contributed to continued spending and kept a recession at bay; however, pervasive and prolonged inflation has sapped away precious dollars and worn down people’s psyches in the process.\n\nEconomy top voters’ concerns: And in an election year, those effects are top of mind for voters and factored heavily into Thursday night’s first presidential debate, with both candidates blaming the other for causing inflation. (In short: The causes of the run-up in inflation were far more complex and global in nature while both the Trump and Biden administrations’ stimulus efforts have been said to play a part as well).\n\nInflation trending lower: But there’s been some more good news for price-wary Americans: Inflation has been on a downward trajectory recently, and on Friday, new data from the Commerce Department showed that the pace of price hikes slowed even more in May and are getting even closer to normal.\n\nThe May Personal Consumption Expenditures price index — a closely watched inflation gauge that the Federal Reserve uses for its 2% target — showed that prices were unchanged from April and slowed to 2.6% for the 12 months ended in May from 2.7% the month before, according to Commerce Department data released Friday.\n\nThe report also showed that consumer spending (a critical economic engine) increased for the month while people’s incomes and savings grew.\n\nA separate report from the University of Michigan showed that consumer sentiment held largely steady in June along with a sharp improvement in Americans’ optimism that inflation will continue to cool in the near-term."
