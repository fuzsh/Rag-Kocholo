        "meta_description": "ED WOOD / PLAN 9 FROM OUTER SPACE DOUBLE FEATURE\nDates: Friday, September 2\n\nED WOOD \n\nShowtimes: 3:00, 7:15\nURGENT TEXT: Directed by Tim Burton\nStarring Johnny Depp and Martin Landau \n\n(1994) Always upbeat, uncompromising auteur struggles against a misunderstanding world to realize his unique artistic vision—only trouble is, he’s Johnny Depp as Ed Wood, and his visions are Glen or Glenda? and Plan 9 from Outer Space, with Martin Landau Oscaring (supporting actor) as Bela Lugosi. 35mm. Approx. 124 mins. \n\nCritical quotes:\n\n“Tim Burton's very good film about a very bad film maker, has a cheerful defiance that would surely have appealed to Orson Welles, who was Ed Wood's hero. Late in the film, Welles appears (played deftly by Vincent d'Onofrio, who really looks like him) to advise Wood that independence is everything and that an artist's visions are worth fighting for. Mr. Burton, currently Hollywood's most irrepressible maverick, has taken that credo to heart.”\n– Janet Maslin, The New York Times\n\nPLAN 9 FROM OUTER SPACE\n\nShowtimes: 1:20, 5:30, 9:40\n\n(1959, Edward D. Wood, Jr.) Bela Lugosi, Vampira, Tor Johnson, a chiropractor in a cloak, washed-up cowboy actors, movie-crazy Baptists and The Amazing Criswell star in this tale of earth’s invasion by flying hubcaps and paper plates. 35mm. Approx. 79 mins. \n\nCritical quotes:\n\n“Unusually creative and oddly expressive.”\n– Dave Kehr, Chicago Reader",
