        "text": "Award winning actor Johnny Depp plays Edward Ratchett in Murder on the Orient Express. Talking about Depp’s portrayal of Ratchett, Branagh says that he brings “a wonderful, seedy glamour to this very sharp-minded, clearly dangerous, and clever mobster.”\n\nJohnny Depp has entertained audiences worldwide with memorable and ground-breaking performances in such films as Edward Scissorhands, Ed Wood, Donnie Brasco, and as the swashbuckler Captain Jack Sparrow in Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl, which launched the blockbuster film franchise. He reprised the beloved role in Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Men Tell No Tales in 2017.\n\nDepp began his performing career as a musician, before segueing to acting. He made his feature film debut in the horror hit A Nightmare on Elm Street, followed by Oliver Stone’s Oscar® winning war drama Platoon. Depp has won numerous awards including SAG, and received Golden Globe®, BAFTA and three Academy Award® nominations for his performances in Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl, Finding Neverland and Sweeney Todd."
