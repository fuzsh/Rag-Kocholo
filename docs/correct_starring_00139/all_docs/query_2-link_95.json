        "text": "Unless you’ve been hiding under a rock or stranded on a desert island for the last couple of weeks, you must be aware of the defamation trial of Johnny Depp vs. Amber Heard and the result.\n\nRegardless of who you rooted for, by now, you know more than you probably wanted about their relationship. Depp began dating Heard after they worked together on The Rum Diary (2011) and later married in 2015, divorced in May 2016, and fought until last week. But that is not the purpose of this article.\n\nWe are here to talk about the books that inspired some of Johnny’s movies, the author, and a brief summary of the plot.\n\nSo, let’s get ready, as they say in the movies before a scene, lights, camera, action.\n\n1. Slow Burn (1986)"
