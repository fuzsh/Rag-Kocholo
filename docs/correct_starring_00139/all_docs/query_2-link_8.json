        "text": "Alice in Wonderland\n\nThis review is based on an IMAX 3-D screening. Lewis Carroll's \"Wonderland\" stories, much like the collected works of Roald Dahl, can be perceived from a number of perspectives. Although traditionally seen as a children's tale, Alice's Wonderla...\n\nAlice through the Looking Glass\n\nAlice through the Looking Glass may represent Disney’s first big-budget failure in quite some time. More likely to inspire thoughts of Michael Bay than Lewis Carroll, this sequel to Tim Burton’s 2010 Alice in Wonderland borrows sparingly ...\n\nAstronaut's Wife, The\n\nThe Astronaut's Wife is the latest demonstration of how a good \"high concept\" does not necessarily translate into a decent motion picture. With its Invasion of the Bodysnatchers-inspired storyline, this movie could have been an effectively creepy ...\n\nBlack Mass\n\nFor Black Mass, Johnny Depp has dusted off his A-game, which has lain dormant for far too long. The actor's transformative portrayal of Whitey Bulger reminds us that Depp, when motivated, can do impressive work. By inhabiting the character rather...\n\nCharlie and the Chocolate Factory\n\nIf there is any living director who can do justice to the warped nature of Roald Dahl's \"children's stories,\" it's Tim Burton. Charlie and the Chocolate Factory isn't the first time these two have \"collaborated.\" Burton produced Henry Selick's anim...\n\nCorpse Bride\n\nNote: I suppose the official title of the movie is Tim Burton's Corpse Bride, presumably to distinguish it from William Shakepeare's Corpse Bride or Jane Austen's Corpse Bride. The wordiness seems silly so, for the purposes of this review, the fil...\n\nDark Shadows\n\nDark Shadows is a mess, and it's unclear whether its bizarre recipe of comedy, campy horror, and gothic melodrama will satisfy anyone, regardless of their familiarity with the source material. By attempting to be too faithful to Dan Curtis' cult TV...\n\nDead Man\n\nDead Man, Jim Jarmusch's first feature since 1992's Night on Earth, is a quirky chronicle of one man's physical and spiritual search for a place of belonging. Jarmusch chose to make Dead Man a western because, according to him, the genre is \"very ...\n\nDonnie Brasco\n\nAl Pacino in a Mafia movie feels as natural as peanut butter with jelly. Mike Newell, the director of such popular British comedies as Enchanted April and Four Weddings and a Funeral, is another matter altogether. When you think of a director...\n\nEd Wood\n\nA title like \"the Worst Director of All Time\" virtually assures that people will remember Ed Wood, although perhaps not in exactly the way the filmmaker would have preferred. Tim Burton, with a biopic that is as much a parody as a tribute, has bro..."
