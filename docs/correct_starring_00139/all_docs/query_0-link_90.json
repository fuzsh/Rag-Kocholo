        "text": "Ed Wood. Directed by Tim Burton.\n\nStarring Johnny Depp, Sarah Jessica Parker & Martin Landau\n\nAwarded:\n\nBest Supporting Actor\n\nBest Make-Up\n\nFilmed in black and white to give it the feel of the times it is meant to represent.\n\nThis film has one thing running through it that is glaringly obvious – Tim Burton’s love for Ed. He is a fan – no doubt about it. Lovingly crafted, bitingly funny – and sometimes heartbreaking.\n\nNobody knows an awful lot about dear old Ed. He was voted worst director ever, Plan 9 was voted worst film ever. He died in his fifties making cheap porn films. Oh, yes, I almost forgot to mention his love of wearing women’s clothing – particularly anything Angora.\n\nThis film is Johnny Depp at his best. He handles Ed perfectly – just the right mixture of humour and pathos. Martin Landau deservedly won Best Supporting Actor for this film. His portrayal of Bela Lugosi is immense.\n\nIn a sense, this is a love story – but not the usual kind. This is the story of one man’s love for cinema. He tries so hard to be a part of it but meets with trouble at every turn. Burton does him proud and leaves us with a touching picture of Ed at his height – believing that he is just one step away from greatness. His later life is not really explored here - and this was the right thing to do. Let’s think of Ed at his peak, happy, determined and proud. Ed making porn films is merely survival, whilst Ed making movies like Bride Of The Monster…well….that’s art!\n\nHere’s a small tip: Watch this film and then watch Bride Of The Monster followed by Plan 9 From Outer Space. The making of these two movies forms the spine of Burton’s Opus and it’s a great way to start an Ed Wood weekend (everybody should have one).\n\nIn conclusion: a wonderful film for any who have a love for cheapo 50s Science Fiction/Horror.\n\nYou won’t be disappointed.\n\nJust for the record – Ed Wood worst ever? Not a chance! There are far worse than him around. At least Ed entertained us."
