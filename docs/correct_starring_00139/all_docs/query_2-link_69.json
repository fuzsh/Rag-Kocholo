He received multiple awards for his outstanding performance in films, including the Golden Globe Award. He was nominated for 3 Academy Awards and 2 BAFTA awards. Depp has played eccentric characters with great performance in his roles that made him the best actor. Since the beginning of his career in Hollywood, Depp has played outstanding roles in movies and made a place in his fans’ hearts. Let us explore in this post the best ever Johnny Depp movies of all time.\n\n1. Corpse Bride\n\nJohnny Depp is not a stranger to animated movies. Corpse bride is a stop-motion animation that is considered as a spiritual sequel to the movie “The Nightmare Before Christmas”. Johnny Depp played the character of Victor while Helena Bonham Carter plays as Emily, a zombie who believes she is his Corpse Bride\n\nVictor made some mistakes while practising his wedding rehearsals. So he decided to practise his vows in the Woods. He recited his vows in front of a tree, but he never realised that he would accidentally marry a corpse bride, Emily. After the wedding, she takes him to the Land of the Dead.\n\nThe movie is another hit collaboration between the actor Johnny Depp and the film producer Tim Burton. The movie lets the audience see the actor’s acting and singing skills simultaneously.\n\n2. Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl\n\nPirates of the Caribbean:The Curse of the Black Pearl is the story of a blacksmith, Will and Captain Jack. Both of them go on an adventure to save the governor’s kidnapped daughter Elizabeth Swan from the pirates outside the Black Pearl.\n\nCaptain Barbosa and his cost crew were behind the kidnapping of Elizabeth Swan. They want the governor’s daughter to make a blood sacrifice that will relieve them from the curse; that made them stay neither dead nor alive. Pirates of the Caribbean and many other Johnny Depp movies are available on IPTV services.\n\nTo fully engage with IPTV services and enjoy a variety of content, users must acquire an IPTV player. This specialised player facilitates the seamless streaming of movies, TV shows, and live TV channels. To assist users in optimising their viewing experience, an easy guide to install Tivimate IPTV on streaming devices like Firestick, Roku, or other compatible platforms is essential for a hassle-free setup. Movies of popular stars like Johnny Depp are available on various IPTV services. All you need is a streaming device, an IPTV player and a stable internet connection.\n\n3. Into the Woods\n\n“Into the Woods” is the story of the big bad wolf, played by Johnny Depp. The wolf uses all his power to attract the “Little Red Riding Hood” to her grandmother’s home, so that he can enjoy a delicious meal.\n\nIn the wolf’s signature song “Hello, little girl” Johnny Depp performs it with a distinct sexual overtone that turns the creepy metre up to 11. The song offers the movie an adult jolt, which only makes it distinguish itself from the usual Disney movies.\n\n4. Finding Neverland\n\n“Finding Neverland” is one of Depp’s best emotional roles. Also, it is one of the most successful movies of the actor. In the movie, Johnny Depp plays the role of James Matthew Barrie, who created Peter Pan. James came under a lot of pressure when his last play failed to grab the attention of the audience. He then prepares himself to write another play that he expects to be successful.\n\nHe met a lady, Sylvia Llewellyn Davies, whose husband died recently, leaving behind his children. Soon after, James is welcomed to Sylvia’s family as they become friends except for one of her kids, Peter. Peter is still feeling the grief for the loss of his father. James tried to do everything he could to console him and forget the loss occurred. In his attempt to cheer Peter up, he helped him come up with the idea of Peter Pan, what the movie is all about.\n\nNot only was the movie successful, with the fans, but even the critics liked it. “Finding Neverland” got 7 Oscar nominations, including the one for Depp’s role, although he didn’t win. In the movie, Johnny Depp proved himself to be highly capable of playing versatile roles, including the James Mathew Barrie in this one.\n\n5. Charlie and the Chocolate Factory\n\n“Charlie and the Chocolate Factory” is the story of Johnny Depp and Freddie Highmore. In the beginning of the movie the audience gets to know “Willy Wonka”, the role played by Johnny Depp who owns a chocolate factory. Willy Wonka is looking for someone to inherit the factory. Willy Wonka hides 5 Golden tickets in various chocolates and invites the five kids who found them to visit his factory.\n\nOne of the kids who found the golden ticket in his chocolate, his name Charlie, hence the title of the movie. Now, Willy Wonka is going to decide which of those kids should get the factory, which is what the movie is all about.\n\n6. What’s Eating Gilbert Grape\n\nThis movie is about the story of 24-year-old Gilbert, a young boy working at a grocery store who feels hopeless and trapped in his life. Johnny Depp plays the role of Gilbert Grape, but in the movie we also see Leonardo DiCaprio who plays the role of his younger brother Arnie Grape.\n\nGilbert holds the responsibility of running the household as he is the primary caregiver for his mother and younger brother Arnie. The story is very emotional, especially when it comes to the relationship between Depp and DiCaprio. You can’t help but sympathise with Gilbert who wishes to have some time and space for his personal life.\n\nBut he also has to look after his younger brother and mother. It’s DiCaprio rather than Depp who stole the show in the movie. DiCaprio even got the nomination for the Oscar Award for the best supporting actor, and he was only 19 years old at that time. Getting nominated for an Oscar is still a big thing for a 19-year-old. The story of the movie was taken from a book with the same name, which was written by Peter Hedges.\n\n7. Edward Scissorhands\n\nEdward Scissorhands is Depp’s one of the best movies and most loved roles. The movie was the first collaboration between Depp and producer Tim Burton. It’s the story of Edward, a character created by a scientist. But the scientist died before the completion of his creation. Edward is left with scissor blades instead of human hands, thus the name of the movie Edward Scissorhands. Depp’s appearance as Edward made him an outcast, but not every person he meets is harsh.\n\nOne day, Edward met a saleswoman, Peg, who took him to her house to work as a barber. At her home, he meets her daughter Kim, with whom he falls in love. Edward says only a few words, but his acting and facial expressions speak more than a thousand words. The movie became a great success and was even nominated for an Oscar. It teaches the audience about acceptance and is one of Tim Burton’s best productions.\n\nSumming Up\n\nJohnny Depp’s movies are more than entertainment content. Every movie is different and has a message for the audience. Stars like Johnny Depp not only deliver great on screen performances, but a great learning for the viewers. So, grab your TV remote and search for the Johnny Depp movies and get immersed in a story for another few hours."
