        "text": "You'll recognize it from: Many outdoors scenes set in the Vale, the Riverlands, and Dragonstone in season two. Plus, old Welsh quarries were used as exteriors for Dragonstone and Harrenhal castles.\n\nSeason two features a number of scenes in the north Wales region, including on Anglesey, Conwy and in Barmouth, Gwynedd, according to Joedi Langley, Head of Sector Development at Creative Wales.\n\n\"It was great to be shooting in Wales with its stunning scenery and landscapes, that bring to life our Westeros,\" House of the Dragon executive producer Kevin de la Noy said. \"I had no hesitation in taking House of the Dragon there, as we knew the support from government and the local populous would help us achieve remarkable footage, and we were blessed with the most glorious weather too.\"\n\nYou'll recognize it from: Various scenes in King's Landing and Oldtown (home to the Citadel).\n\nWhile in Game of Thrones, King's Landing scenes were filmed in Dubrovnik, Croatia, they sometimes also filmed in Cáceres. House of the Dragon predominately uses the Spanish town as the setting for King's Landing.\n\nHouse of the Dragon production designer Jim Clay loved filming in Cáceres—but says it was too clean for the world of Westeros. \"Obviously, we can’t change the stonework, but the authorities cooperated as much as they could and we were able to put a ground covering throughout all of the streets,\" Clay told Variety. \"That was partly for the look, and it was partly for horses being able to maneuver over wet cobblestones without tripping.\"\n\nYou'll recognize it as: The site of the confrontation on the bridge of Dragonstone in season one, when Rhaenyra arrives on her dragon.\n\nGaztelugatxe is an islet on the coast of Biscay, and the hermitage on the island dates back to the 10th century. House of the Dragon filmed on the famous stone bridge. Game of Thrones also filmed scenes here—the islet stood in for Dragonstone in season seven.\n\nYou'll recognize it as: An upcoming battle scene in season two.\n\nFilming at Bourne Wood \"was really special,\" actor Fabien Frankel, who plays Ser Criston Cole, . \"That’s cinematic history and we were filming on the same ground.\" According to Time Out UK, \"Online speculation suggest the sequence filmed there involves one or more dragons.\"\n\nPictured: A scene from Gladiator filmed at Bourne Wood\n\nYou won't recognize it, because the studios are where many of the interior scenes in the show were filmed. The studios are famously where the Harry Potter movies were shot; thus far, House of the Dragon has used Leavesden's Virtual Production Stage, four sound stages, and the studio backlot.\n\nHouse of the Dragon was the first show to use the V Stage, the studio's virtual stage. \"The launch of V Stage brings a completely new dimension to filmmaking at WBSL, providing an exciting environment in which to deliver a new level of creativity,\" Emily Stillman, SVP, Studio Operations, Warner Bros. Studios Leavesden, said in an announcement. \"With the show’s incredible imaginary worlds and exceptional quality HBO always delivers, House of the Dragon is the perfect production to maximize the unparalleled opportunities this space offers.\"\n\nGet tickets to the studio tour"
