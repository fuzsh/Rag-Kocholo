        "text": "Video: Hollywood Insider YouTube Channel\n\nJohnny Depp Filmography\n\nAt Hollywood Insider, we are fans of Johnny Depp and his ability to transform in totality to become the role he is essaying. Be it a pirate, a man with scissors for hands, a public enemy and gangster romancing Marion Cotillard, the mad hatter guiding Alice, a protective brother to Leonardo DiCaprio – Depp always leaves us visibly awestruck knowing that no one else could have done the role he played. There is no other actor in the history of Hollywood as versatile as The Johnny Depp. Here we look at all the ways the actor, heartthrob and movie star has evolved since his credited debut in 1984 to his mind-blowing leading performances in films such as ‘Edward Scissorhands’, ‘Pirates of the Caribbean’, ‘Public Enemies’, etc. We celebrate Johnny Depp’s filmography. In an industry, where most A-list leading men have chosen to stick to muscled-up superhero genre, gun-toting action men, lovestruck romantic leads, etc, Depp continues to rule all genres, succeeding in each and more. It comes as a shock that Depp has yet to win an Academy Award – this is a travesty. There is a lot more to come from Depp and we are excited for his future movies, roles and landmark performances. We are rooting for you Depp, Hollywood Insider will always support you.\n\nRelated article: Johnny Depp’s ‘Edward Scissorhands’: A Study in Stigmatization of Mental Illnesses\n\nRelated article: Hollywood Insider’s CEO Pritan Ambroase: “The Importance of Venice Film Festival as the Protector of Cinema”\n\nTitle Year Role Director A Nightmare on Elm Street 1984 Glen Lantz Wes Craven Lady Blue 1985 Lionel Viland Private Resort 1985 Jack Marshall George Bowers Platoon 1986 Lerner Oliver Stone Slow Burn 1986 Donnie Fleischer 21 Jump Street 1987–1990 Officer Thomas “Tom” Hanson, Jr. Hotel 1987 Rob Cameron Cry-Baby 1990 Wade “Cry-Baby” Walker John Waters Edward Scissorhands 1990 Edward Scissorhands Tim Burton Freddy’s Dead: The Final Nightmare 1991 Glen Lantz Rachel Talalay Arizona Dream\n\n1993\n\nAxel Blackmar Emir Kusturica Benny & Joon Sam Jeremiah S.

We are actively, physically and digitally a part of this global movement. We will continue reporting on this major issue of police brutality and legal murders of Black people to hold the system accountable. We will continue reporting on this major issue with kindness and respect to all Black people, as each and every one of them are seen and heard. Just a reminder, that the Black Lives Matter movement is about more than just police brutality and extends into banking, housing, education, medical, infrastructure, etc. We have the space and time for all your stories. We believe in peaceful/non-violent protests and I would like to request the rest of media to focus on 95% of the protests that are peaceful and working effectively with positive changes happening daily. Media has a responsibility to better the world and Hollywood Insider will continue to do so.”\n\nVote with a conscience – Register to Vote – Your vote saves lives and ends systemic racism\n\n– ‘Rebecca’: Lily James and Armie Hammer are Breathtaking in this Dazzling Remake of a Hitchcock Classic\n\n– FACT-CHECKED Series: Armie Hammer and 32 Facts About Our Mega-Star\n\n– ‘We Are Who We Are’: Coming of Age Series by Luca Guadagnino of ‘Call Me by Your Name’ Masterpiece\n\n– FACT-CHECKED Series: Timothée Chalamet and 32 Things About This Extraordinary Superstar\n\nJohnny Depp movies, Johnny Depp wife, Johnny Depp net worth, Johnny Depp news, Johnny Depp young, Johnny Depp age, Johnny Depp court, Johnny Depp case, Johnny Depp roles, Johnny Depp, Johnny Depp, Johnny Depp, Johnny Depp, Johnny Depp, Johnny Depp, Johnny Depp, Johnny Depp, Johnny Depp, Johnny Depp, Johnny Depp 2020, Johnny Depp filmography, Johnny Depp filmography, Johnny Depp filmography, Johnny Depp filmography, Johnny Depp filmography, Johnny Depp filmography, Johnny Depp filmography, ohnny Depp filmography, Johnny Depp filmography, Johnny Depp filmography, Johnny Depp filmography, Johnny Depp filmography, Johnny Depp filmography, ohnny Depp filmography, Johnny Depp filmography, Johnny Depp filmography, Johnny Depp filmography, Johnny Depp filmography, Johnny Depp filmography"
