Ed Wood is a 1994 biographical comedy of director Edward D. Wood Jr. that was directed by Tim Burton and starred Johnny Depp, Martin Landau, Sarah Jessica Parker, Patricia Arquette and Bill Murray. The film chronicles part of Ed Wood's career as writer, producer and director of some of the worst films ever made and his cross-dressing. Martin Landau received the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor for his role as an elderly and washed up Bela Lugosi, and legendary makeup artist Rick Baker won the third of his SEVEN Academy Awards for Best Makeup and Hairstyling for transforming Landau into Legosi.

The following weapons were used in the film Ed Wood (1994):

Thompson Submachine Gun

A prop Thompson Submachine Gun hangs from a wall on a movie set.

Webley Mk I

Bela Lugosi (Martin Landau) threatens to kill Ed Wood (Johnny Depp) and himself with a Webley Mk I. This is the only "real" gun in the film.

Colt Lawman MK III

Prop Colt Lawman MK III revolvers are used on the set of Plan 9 from Outer Space. Since Plan 9 from Outer Space was shot in 1956 and the Colt Lawman MK III wasn't produced until 1969, this is an anachronism.
