        "text": "Background\n\nJonah Hill Feldstein was born on December 20, 1983, in Los Angeles, California. His parents are Richard Feldstein and Sharon Lyn. He wanted to be a famous writer since he was born and reared in a creative family. He aspired to be a member of the writing staff of “The Simpsons” and “Saturday Night Live” as a child. He attended Brentwood School and Crossroads College in Santa Monica, where he received his bachelor’s degree. Later, he relocated to New York to get a degree in acting at The New School.\n\nHill made his Hollywood debut in 2004 with the film “I Heart Huckabees.” Following his debut picture, he went on to star in several subsequent films. He had a minor role in “The 40-Year-Old Virgin” and a supporting role in “Knocked Up.” He landed a role in the hit comedy “Superbad” in 2007. It was a game changer in his career, for which he received two M.T.V. Movie Awards and two Teen Choice Awards nominations. He starred alongside Brad Pitt in the film “Moneyball” in 2011, for which he received positive acclaim and an Academy Award nomination for ‘Best Supporting Actor.’ In 2012, he not only produced and starred in “21 Jump Street,” but he also contributed to the script. That same year he appeared in “Django: Unchained.” He also starred in the popular film “War Dogs,” for which he received a Golden Globe nomination for ‘Best Actor.’\n\nHe played roles in animated films such as “The Lego Movie” and “How to Train Your Dragon 2.” Hill co-starred opposite Joaquin Phoenix, Rooney Mara, and Jack Black in the 2018 comedy-drama “Don’t Worry, He Won’t Get Far on Foot.” Hill was also cast as Owen Milgrim in “Maniac” in the same year. From 2008 through 2011, Hill was in a relationship with Jordan Klein. He dated Ali Hoffman for a year after that. He got engaged to Gianna Santos in 2019, but the couple split in October 2020."
