        "text": "In 2023's You People, Eddie Murphy plays Jonah Hill's future father-in-law who is less than thrilled that his daughter will be marrying a white Jewish man. Hill also co-wrote the screenplay with Black-ish creator Kenya Barris, though sticking to the script was advised, improv was encouraged on set.\n\nMurphy told Collider that he enjoyed working with a skilled improviser.\n\n[Jonah] was so much fun to work with because most actors can't do [improv]. Most actors, they do the stuff that’s on the script, and if you go off script, or you start playing around… I've been in scenes where actors just be looking at you. You'd go all over the place and they're just kind of looking at you, and [they] say, “Cut.” And they say, “Oh, I was watching.” They start watching you.\n\nBut Jonah, if you go off script, he's right there with you, and sometimes he'll go, or you got to come with him, and he's funny and smart. It was fun working with him.\n\nLeonardo DiCaprio first worked with Jonah Hill in Django Unchained, a partnership that would continue in the highly successful film The Wolf of Wall Street and Netflix's Don't Look Up. Filming for the latter occurred during the COVID-19 pandemic and the two actors decided to live together during the shoot.\n\nThough their characters are adversaries in Don't Look Up, DiCaprio couldn't have been more complimentary of Hill in a press conference for the film:\n\nLook, I'll just start right out of the gate and say he is an absolute genius, this young man, this friend of mine. His ability to improvise and take control of a scene and have the narrative be shifted in the most amazing, colorful ways is a sight to witness and something truly remarkable to experience. He's absolutely a genius. Love to work with him on a hundred more films.\n\nBoth Hill and actor Jay Baruchel are known for their proximity to Seth Rogen, Judd Apatow, and the group of people known for starring in multiple movies together informally known as the Frat Pack. This concept was explored further in the 2013 apocalyptic comedy This Is The End.\n\nIn it, where most of the actors play themselves, Baruchel is struggling with his relationship with Rogen and his newfound friendship with famous Hollywood actors, particularly Jonah Hill. From the beginning, Jay makes his dislike known, saying he \"can't stand Hill.” The latter on the other hand, tells Rogen how much he likes his friend. We later find out this proves to be false.\n\nIn 2017, Baruchel confirmed that what viewers saw in This Is The End between the two actors was true to life when Larry King asked him about their relationship.\n\nBaruchel: There is one, I guess. I know the man.\n\nKing: You don't like him?\n\nBaruchel: I wouldn't say that…It was contentious once upon a time, but I think now we’re sort of each the devil the other one knows.\n\nIn 2023, Baruchel was interviewed by The Last Laugh podcast, where he confirmed that working with someone you dislike and receiving compliments onscreen from them “was exhausting” and “sucked.\" In fact, he found Hill so unfunny onset that he was surprised at how well the dynamic worked onscreen.\n\nI was like, “Holy f***, this is funny as f***.” And Jonah is very good in it. That’s when I knew it was a good movie; when I was laughing at Jonah’s sh** that I never once found funny on set. And then, in the movie, I actually found myself laughing.\n\nRob Riggle starred alongside Jonah Hill as a P.E. teacher moonlighting as a drug kingpin in 21 Jump Street. His experiences on set were extremely positive and he took note of how multifaceted Hill was.\n\nHe told CBS News in 2020,\n\nI always take something away from everyone I work with, it's usually good and very rarely bad. When I was working with Jonah Hill on 21 Jump Street, he was writing, producing, and starring in it. He was doing a lot.\n\nIt's always nice to work with people who are comfortable. There's certain people you can try things with or improvise with. You bend it, you don't break it. Jonah was great at that. He wasn't selfish about anything. Those are great moments and memories.\n\nJudd Apatow put Jonah Hill in many of his early films. This included ones he directed like Knocked Up, Funny People, and The 40-Year-Old Virgin, and ones he produced like the coming-of-age sex comedy Superbad.\n\nWhile auditioning actors to play the weird and iconic McLovin', Apatow noticed that actor Christopher Mintz-Plasse was \"very caustic and attacked Jonah and did improvs insulting Jonah\" during his third callback. Apatow told Vanity Fair:\n\nJonah said, “I don't like that guy. I don't want him doing it.” And I said, “That's exactly why we're hiring him. It couldn't be more perfect. The fact that it bothers you is exactly what we want.”\n\nIn the same piece, Seth Rogen noted something similar. Besides appearing in the film as Officer Michaels, he co-wrote the screenplay, and Hill's character is based on his teenage self. Rogen said,\n\nJonah immediately hated him. He was like, “That was f---ing with my rhythm. I couldn't perform with that guy.”"
