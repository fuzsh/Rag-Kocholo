        "text": "Now 10 years young,”Superbad” has solidified its standing among iconic comedy films. Littered with soon-to-be stars, it brought theatergoers pop culture gems, like, McLovin (“chicka chicka yeah!”) and more. Take a look back at the movie’s memorable characters and see what the actors who played them — including Michael Cera and Jonah Hill — are up to now.\n\nCheck out more trivia, goofs, and quotes on the film’s IMDb page.\n\nJonah Hill (Seth)\n\nTo reconcile the fact that he and best friend Evan are going off to different colleges, sex-crazed-but-lovable Seth tries (and fails) to make Jules (Emma Stone) his girlfriend. He really strikes out when he accidentally gives her a black eye.\n\nJonah Hill now\n\nHill has been nominated for two Oscars for his roles in 2011’s “Moneyball” and 2013’s “The Wolf of Wall Street.” He most recently received a Golden Globe nomination for his role in “War Dogs.”\n\nMichael Cera (Evan)\n\nEvan is Seth’s nervous best friend who constantly tries to talk Seth out of his crazy schemes. Evan wants to get his secret crush on Becca out in the open — but with three weeks left of high school, his time is running out!\n\nMichael Cera now\n\nCera has had steady work as a comic actor, picking up uniquely awkward teenager roles in “Scott Pilgrim vs. the World” and “Nick and Norah’s Infinite Playlist.” In 2016, he voiced Barry the hot dog in “Sausage Party” — which counts as one of multiple professional reunions he’s had over the years with “Superbad” castmates Seth Rogen and Jonah Hill.\n\nEmma Stone (Jules)\n\nPer Evan’s words, Jules “got totally hot over last summer but obviously doesn’t realize it.” While her parents are away, she throws a party where very weird things happen.\n\nEmma Stone now\n\nHaving just dethroned Jennifer Lawrence as the world’s highest paid actress, Stone has accumulated a score of acting awards since “Superbad” came out, most recently winning the Academy Award for Best Actress for her role in “La La Land.”\n\nChristopher Mintz-Plasse (Fogell/McLovin)\n\nWhen Seth and Evan’s geeky friend Fogell changes his name to “McLovin,” his life changes. McLovin befriends two cops who buy him beer. He loses his virginity to the girl of his dreams. And he officially becomes the coolest guy at the party.\n\nChristopher Mintz-Plasse now\n\nMintz-Plasse starred in 2010’s “Kick-Ass” and 2011 vampire flick “Fright Night.” He also voiced Fishlegs in the “How to Train Your Dragon” film series. He will reprise this role for HTTYD 3 in 2019. We’ll always love McLovin!\n\nSeth Rogen (Officer Michaels)\n\nOne of two zany police officers who show McLovin a good time. But, according to his partner, this one can’t shoot a gun.\n\nSeth Rogen now\n\nRogen has a long list of starring comedies under his belt, including, “Pineapple Express,” “The Interview” and “Neighbors.” In 2019, he will voice Pumbaa in the live-action adaptation of “The Lion King.”\n\nBill Hader (Officer Slater)\n\nHis competence as a police officer may be questionable, but he can do a sweet donut in his police cruiser. That has to count for something, right?\n\nBill Hader now\n\nA “Saturday Night Live” alum, Hader recently returned to the show in August 2017 to play a parody version of former White House Communications Director, Anthony “The Mooch” Scaramucci. His acting credits have stretched beyond comedy into drama and in 2015 he voiced the role of Fear in Disney-Pixar’s “Inside Out.”\n\nMartha MacIsaac (Becca)\n\nBecca is Evan’s crush, and she likes him back. Although she “totally flirts with him” in math class, he doesn’t pick up on it.\n\nMartha MacIsaac now\n\nMacIsaac has picked up regular roles in “1600 Penn” and “The Pinkertons.” She has also lent her voice to Patty of “Family Guy.”\n\nDave Franco (Greg)\n\nYou may recognize this famous actor, but you may not remember his character: Greg the soccer player. Greg appears onscreen briefly to scold Evan for messing up their gym class soccer game.\n\nDave Franco now\n\nLike his older brother, James, Dave has appeared in several blockbuster films, including, “21 Jump Street,” “Warm Bodies,” and “Now You See Me.” His next role will be as Greg Sestero in “The Disaster Artist.”\n\nClark Duke (“Party Teenager”)\n\nThis unnamed partier answered the door when the cops came to break up Jules’ party, then looked on amusedly as Fogell/McLovin pretended to get arrested.\n\nClark Duke now\n\nDuke went on to score much bigger gigs, including regular roles in “Greek” and “Two and a Half Men.” Right now, he plays fledgling standup comic Ron Shack in the Showtime comedy series, “I’m Dying Up Here.”\n\nCarla Gallo (“Period Blood Girl”)\n\nWhen this party girl dances with Seth, she leaves her mark on him — literally. If you’ve seen the movie, you know what we’re talking about.\n\nCarla Gallo now\n\nNo more period blood for this lady! Gallo has appeared in “Californication” and the movie “Neighbors” (with fellow “Superbad” alum, Seth Rogen). She also plays Daisy Wick in “Bones.”\n\nMartin Starr (James Masselin)\n\nThis guy is in the room when Evan serenades a group of dudes with his, um, unique singing voice. Then later, when a fight breaks out, he throws a mean punch.\n\nMartin Starr now\n\nStarr is probably best known for his role as Bill Haverchuck in “Freaks and Geeks,” but that was pre-“Superbad.” Today, he has a recurring role on HBO’s “Silicon Valley,” along with an expanding list of film credits.\n\nJoe Lo Truglio (Francis the driver)\n\nFrancis hits Seth with his car in the liquor store parking lot and makes it up to him by bringing him to a party (not Jules’ party). Judging by the beat-down Francis gets from the party host, he clearly was not invited.\n\nJoe Lo Truglio now\n\nAfter his role in “Superbad,” Truglio went on to enjoy regular TV roles in “Backwash,” “Free Agents,” and “Wet Hot American Summer.” He currently plays Charles Boyle in “Brooklyn Nine-Nine.”\n\nJoe Nunez (“Liquor Store Clerk”)\n\nThis guy works at the liquor store where Fogell/McLovin attempts to use his fake ID. He clearly isn’t amused when clumsy McLovin spills a six-pack of beer.\n\nJoe Nunez now\n\nNunez has since made appearances in “Seven Pounds,” “Bridesmaids,” and “NCIS: Los Angeles.” He is also a voice actor."
