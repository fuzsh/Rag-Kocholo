        "text": "Jonah Hill and Micheal Cera were the stars of Superbad, but when most people think of the movie, they think of McLovin, the scene-stealing character played by Christopher Mintz-Plasse.\n\nRelated\n\nSuperbad: Does the McLovin’ scene help make it a classic?\n\nThanks to Christopher Mintz-Plasse, the character of McLovin has become iconic, but if Jonah Hill had his way, Mintz-Plasse wouldn’t have played the character at all. Vanity Fair recently published a highly entertaining oral history of the production of Superbad, part of which explores just how hard it was to cast McLovin. Superbad co-writer Evan Goldberg said, “It became very evident that there were no actors who were right for the role.” As the production began searching Southern California high schools, Christopher Mintz-Plasse went with his friends to an open audition. To his surprise, he got a callback and later read with Micheal Cera and Jonah Hill. Director Greg Mottola said, “[Chris] played it like he was clearly the coolest guy in the room and everyone else was a nerd and a loser. He was Dean Martin instead of Jerry Lewis.” This wound up annoying Jonah Hill quite a bit.\n\nJudd Apatow: In the audition, he was very caustic and attacked Jonah and did improvs insulting Jonah.\n\nSeth Rogen: Jonah immediately hated him. He was like, ‘That was f***ing with my rhythm. I couldn’t perform with that guy.’\n\nJudd Apatow: Jonah said, ‘I don’t like that guy. I don’t want him doing it.’ And I said, “That’s exactly why we’re hiring him. It couldn’t be more perfect. The fact that it bothers you is exactly what we want.'”"
