        "text": "The dynamic between McLovin and Seth in SuperBad is one of the highlights of the beloved coming-of-age movie, and as some might know, it might be because some of that anger is real. Actor Jonah Hill actively disliked working with Christopher Mintz-Plasse during the film, and while we've heard about the audition and things from Hill's perspective, we haven't heard the full story. Mintz-Plasse recently shared those details with CinemaBlend, and where things stand with the actors currently.\n\nI had a chance to speak to Christopher Mintz-Plasse following his recent appearance on Stars On Mars, in which he rubbed shoulders with fellow celebrities like Marshawn Lynch and Ariel Winter. During our conversation, I asked about the story of Jonah Hill not liking him while filming Superbad and got his take on the \"beef\" between them, starting with the infamous McLovin audition. Said Mintz-Plasse,\n\nChristopher Mintz-Plasse had no intention of pissing off Jonah Hill. As he explained, he was just trying to get the part of McLovin. This meant acting like an actual high schooler (which he was pretty tuned into as a high schooler at the time), and his comebacks and jabs threw Hill off his game and frustrated him.\n\nThe tension between Jonah Hill and Christopher Mintz-Plasse didn't end at the audition either, apparently. Mintz-Plasse told CinemaBlend about landing the gig as McLovin, and how the continued tension between him and Hill ultimately helped the movie:\n\nSeth was legitimately pissed off at McLovin most of the time they interacted, and apparently, the same was true of Jonah Hill in regard to Christopher Mintz-Plasse. The actor isn't upset about that in the slightest and points out that had Hill liked him, he may not have gotten the role of Superbad's most memorable character.\n\nMcLovin is a role that led to a lot of other roles for Christopher Mintz-Plasse in Hollywood, so it's easy to see why he's happy with how things worked out. It also probably helps that he's since had time to talk with Jonah Hill about that gig fifteen-plus years later and hash out any issues that were between them:\n\nIt's good to hear that things are good between the two actors, and we aren't reporting on some decade-and-a-half blood feud between the two of them. Something tells me that Seth and McLovin would for sure hold a grudge against each other for that long, but it doesn't seem like we'll ever get Superbad 2 to find out for sure.\n\nAs far as what's next for Christopher Mintz-Plasse, he's reprising his role as King Gristle for the upcoming Trolls Band Together. He also was in Fox's Stars On Mars, but for those who missed the premiere, he was voted off in the opening episode. Hey, at least he's never too far away on streaming for anyone wanting to watch his work, as Superbad is available with an HBO Max subscription.\n\nStars On Mars airs on Fox on Mondays at 8:00 pm ET. Tune in to see various stars trying to prove they can survive life on Mars or prove the exact opposite. It's a fun watch, even with Christopher Mintz-Plasse out of the mix, and I'm excited to see which celebrities make it to the end."
