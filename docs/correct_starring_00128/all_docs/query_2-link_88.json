        "text": "What Is Jonah Hill's Net Worth?\n\nJonah Hill is an American actor, producer, writer, and comedian who has a net worth of $80 million. Jonah Hill is known for starring in films such as \"Superbad,\" \"Knocked Up,\" \"Forgetting Sarah Marshall,\" \"21 Jump Street,\" \"The Wolf of Wall Street,\" \"War Dogs,\" and \"Moneyball.\"\n\nJonah first gained notice by performing in productions that he wrote for himself in the East Village in New York while he was studying music at the New School. Though he had not considered a career in acting before, the success of his shows led him to shift his focus. After being invited to audition for \"I Heart Huckabees\" by Dustin Hoffman, he was on his way. He was subsequently \"adopted\" by prolific filmmaker Judd Apatow and has since appeared in \"The 40-Year-Old Virgin,\" \"Superbad,\" and \"Knocked Up.\" He has also appeared in such films as \"Evan Almighty,\" \"Forgetting Sarah Marshall,,\" \"Night at the Museum 2\", \"Bruno,\" and \"Get Him to the Greek.\" He regularly does voice-over work and has voiced characters for such films as \"Horton Hears a Who!,\", \"How to Train Your Dragon,\" and \"Megamind.\" In 2011, he received widespread critical acclaim and an Oscar nomination for his performance as Peter Brand in \"Moneyball.\" Since then, he has co-starred in \"21 Jump Street,\" \"Django Unchained,\" \"This is the End,\" \"The Wolf of Wall Street,\" \"How to Train Your Dragon 2,\" and \"True Story,\" among others.\n\nReal Estate\n\nIn 2010, Jonah bought a home in Los Angeles for a bit below $2 million. He sold this house in 2015 for $3.65 million. Around the same time as the sale, Hill spent $9.2 million on a loft in the NoHo neighborhood of Manhattan. In March 2022, Jonah listed the NoHo loft for $11 million. He found a buyer a few months later for $10.6 million.\n\nIn September 2019, Hill spent $6.8 million on a home in Santa Monica, California. He sold this home in October 2021 for $7.2 million.\n\nIn May 2021, Jonah paid $9 million for a home within the gated Malibu Colony. The sellers of this home were Richard and Laurie Stark, the founders/owners of the hugely successful Chrome Hearts retail brand. In an unusual coincidence, back in September 2019, the seller of his Santa Monica home was Richard and Laurie's daughter. Jonah sold this Malibu Colony home in December 2022 for $11.1 million after having listed it for $15 million in June 2022. The same month of his sale, Jonah paid $15.5 million for an oceanfront home in the Malibu Colony, right across the street from his former place. He listed this Malibu Colony home in July 2024 for $16.7 million.\n\nEarly Life\n\nJonah Hill was born Jonah Hill Feldstein on December 20, 1983, in Los Angeles, California. His mother, Sharon Lyn, is a costume designer, and his dad, Richard Feldstein, is an entertainment industry accountant who worked with bands like Guns N' Roses. His younger sister is actress Beanie Feldstein, and their brother Jordan died suddenly at age 40 from a pulmonary embolism. Hill grew up in the well-off neighborhood of Cheviot Hills and continues to reside there. He graduated high school from Crossroads School in Santa Monica and attended several colleges, landing in New York City. During college, he began writing his own plays and performing them in the East Village.\n\nCareer\n\nHill began performing with small theater groups around New York. He eventually befriended two of Dustin Hoffman's children, who then mentioned Jonah's talents to their father. Hoffman helped Hill nab his first role, a part in his film, \"I Heart Huckabees.\" Various other film roles soon followed, including in Judd Apatow's first film he ever directed, \"The 40-Year-Old Virgin.\" Hill got a larger role in Apatow's next film, 2007's \"Knocked Up.\"\n\nHill's big break came in the 2007 comedy \"Superbad\" when he played the leading role opposite Michael Cera. The film launched both of their careers. He hosted \"Saturday Night Live\" in 2008. He starred in a third Apatow-directed flick, \"Funny People,\" which also starred Adam Sandler and Seth Rogen. Hill worked as an associate producer of 2009's \"Bruno,\" a Sacha Baron Cohen mockumentary. Jonah turned down a lead role in \"The Hangover\" to work with the Duplass brothers in 2010's \"Cyrus.\" Hill created an animated series for Fox called \"Allen Gregory,\" but it received overwhelmingly negative reviews and was canceled on January 8, 2012.\n\nIn 2011, Jonah received critical acclaim for his supporting role alongside Brad Pitt in the baseball bio-topic \"Moneyball.\" He was even nominated for a Best Supporting Actor Academy Award for his performance in \"Moneyball,\" marking his first Oscar nom. In 2012, Hill starred in the film \"21 Jump Street\" opposite Channing Tatum. The movie got excellent reviews and was a box office hit. His next hit was the Quentin Tarantino film \"Django Unchained\" in 2012, which was nominated for numerous prestigious awards, including Oscars, Golden Globes, and BAFTAS.\n\nIn 2013, Jonah received more critical and popular praise for his role as Donnie Azoff in the 2012 Martin Scorsese/Leonardo DiCaprio blockbuster \"The Wolf of Wall Street.\" He received his second Oscar nomination and won an MTV Movie Award for his performance. Hill told Howard Stern in an interview that he earned just $60,000 for his role in the film because he took SAG's minimum wage, but said he didn't mind because he would have done \"anything in the world\" to act in a Scorsese film.\n\nIn 2014, Hill voiced The Green Lantern in \"The Lego Movie\" and also reprised his role as Morton Schmidt in the second \"21 Jump Street\" movie. In 2016, Hill got the opportunity to act in a Coen brothers' comedy, \"Hail Caesar!\" That same year, he acted alongside Miles Teller in \"War Dogs.\" For this role, he was nominated for a Golden Globe for Best Actor.\n\nNext up, Hill reunited with old comedy pals Seth Rogen, Michael Cera, and James Franco in the animated comedy \"Sausage Party.\" Hill co-starred opposite Emma Stone in the Netflix dark comedy \"Maniac\" in 2018. Also in 2018, Hill made his directorial debut with a screenplay he wrote titled \"Mid90s,\" and it was positively received by critics and audiences. The next year, he voiced characters in \"How to Train Your Dragon: The Hidden World\" and \"The Lego Movie 2: The Second Part.\" He also appeared with Matthew McConaughey in \"Beach Bum\" that year.\n\nJonah was named on the best-dressed list of \"Vanity Fair\" in 2018. In 2019, it was reported that Hill was in talks to play the villain in \"The Batman,\" however, he eventually departed the project when they could not come to a negotiation. In 2020, Hill appeared in the Martin Scorsese-directed Coca-Cola commercial for the Super Bowl. In 2021, he appeared in the Netflix film \"Don't Look Up,\" and in 2023, Hill returned to Netflix in \"You People.\" Jonah has also been cast as Jerry Garcia in the upcoming biopic feature about the Grateful Dead directed by Martin Scorsese.\n\nPersonal Life\n\nIn July 2011, Hill lost a significant amount of weight. He appeared at the 2011 ESPN Espy Awards, and onlookers and media reporters definitely noticed. He has reported that he lost the weight by consulting a trainer and a nutritionist and changing his diet drastically. Hill has said that he lost weight in order to have a better shot at obtaining more serious roles.\n\nIn August 2018, Jonah Hill and Gianna Santos were spotted together. They announced their engagement in August 2019 but ended it in October 2020. In June 2023, Hill welcomed his first child with his girlfriend, Olivia Millar."
