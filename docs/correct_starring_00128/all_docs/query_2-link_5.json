        "text": "Looking for some hilarious Jonah Hill movies that will make you laugh out loud? Since he graced the silver screen in Judd Apatow's The 40-Year-Old Virgin, audiences have been enthralled by his acting prowess. Initially, he made waves with his comedic performances in pictures such as Superbad and Knocked Up. However, it was only a matter of time before the star transitioned into more significant roles.\n\nHill has earned distinguished acknowledgments from both the Golden Globes and Academy Awards. He is frequently paired with acclaimed actors like Leonardo DiCaprio, Brad Pitt, Jennifer Lawrence, and Meryl Streep. Interestingly enough, in 2020, Hill even made history by taking the title of the most cuss words in a film—even reigning over Samuel L. Jackson. Read through some of his funniest roles to date.\n\n7. War Dogs (2016)\n\nWar Dogs was one of Todd Phillips' most significant works, opening Colin Farrell to become the beloved Penguin in Batman. Previously, Variety reported that Hill was initially considered for this part and could have been remarkable. Considering Phillips is pushing musical boundaries with his upcoming Joker: Folie á Deux, why not continue this innovative route and bring Hill back as a different version of Penguin? After all, he proved in War Dogs that he could expertly take up the role of an ethically challenged but ambitious and funny criminal when playing Efraim Diveroli.\n\nJonah Hill gives an exceptionally dynamic performance as Donnie in Gus Van Sant's 2018 film, Don't Worry, He Won't Get Far on Foot. A member of Alcoholics Anonymous (AA), Donnie works with John Callahan, a quadriplegic cartoonist, to progress toward sobriety following a devastating drunk driving accident. Hill genuinely shines in every scene.\n\n5. Forgetting Sarah Marshall (2008)\n\nForgetting Sarah Marshall is filled with subtle Easter eggs for eagle-eyed fans to discover, but the standout character has to be Hill's portrayal of an avid fan of Aldous Snow (Russell Brand). He stars alongside Paul Rudd and other comedy legends in their roles at the Hawaii hotel that makes up the majority of the movie. However, Jason Segel, who plays Peter Bretter, and his journey through relationships with Sarah and Rachel Jansen (Mila Kunis) make the film stand out. Hill's waiter/musician still manages to win each scene purely by sheer cringe factor.\n\n4. This Is The End (2013)\n\nSeth Rogen and Evan Goldberg are two of the most resourceful comedians. They collaborated to bring us the comical disaster film This Is The End. Consequently, gathering an impressive lineup of stars such as Jonah Hill, Danny McBride, Craig Robinson, and of course Rogen himself, not to mention cameos from Rihanna, Michael Cera, and more, they provided audiences with a hilarious survival tale set in the Hollywood Hills. Hill's over-the-top characterization of a possessed “saint” develop into a wild finale between him and the rest of the cast within this silly yet compelling context.\n\nFor these two comedy giants, This Is The End was always meant to be a movie where actors played exaggerated versions of themselves in extraordinary situations. Furthermore, It was nothing short of cinematic brilliance, a hit with viewers and critics alike.\n\n3. Cyrus (2010)\n\nJohn C. Reilly and Marisa Tomei star in the 2010 Duplass brothers' British dramedy Cyrus. Despite initial chemistry, their forming relationship takes an interesting turn when John meets Molly's older son, Cyrus. Desperate for attention, Cyrus embarks on a psychological battle with his mother's determined suitor. Hill is a force to be reckoned with, succeeding both comedically and dramatically by presenting the complexities of human emotion and the contrast of air-brushed ideals. Considered among the best Jonah Hill movies as a leading actor, the film received a warm reception upon its Sundance Film Festival premiere.\n\n2. The Wolf of Wall Street (2013)\n\nThe Wolf of Wall Street, running close to three hours, caused a sensation, with many deeming it unrestrained. Nevertheless, it was thrilling, presenting a definitively contemptuous picture of avarice. Donnie Azoff, portrayed by Hill, fuels much of the immorality rather than Jordan Belfort (played by Leonardo DiCaprio). Azoff introduces Belfort to drugs, takes off his clothes at a bash, and alerts the FBI about their criminal activities because of his flippant style of living. Hill depicted this role skillfully - being adequately loathsome and vain yet still comedic and catchy. Hill's performance particularly stood out.\n\n1. Superbad (2007)\n\nJonah Hill and Michael Cera rose to fame with their portrayals in the 2007 coming-of-age comedy Superbad. Following two high school seniors, Seth and Evan, they set out on a mission to find liquor for a party and ultimately lose their virginity. Christopher Mintz-Plasse joined the two friends as Fogell, or McLovin, adding some of the movie's best punchlines.\n\nCritics and audiences alike have given Superbad rave reviews. The Los Angeles Times admired the iconic duo Laurel and Hardy-esque chemistry between Hill and Cera. Showcasing a balanced blend of humor and poignancy, Superbad still stands out as one of the best Jonah Hill movies."
