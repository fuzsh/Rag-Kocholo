        "text": "Seth Rogen and his production partner Evan Goldberg were childhood friends growing up in Canada. When they were 13 years old, they saw a movie they didn't think was any good, and thought that they could write a better script. The boys retreated to Goldberg's parents' desk and began writing the seeds of what would become Superbad.\n\nOver the years, the two friends would go back to the script and do rewrites. Eventually, Rogen moved to Hollywood and landed acting roles on acclaimed television shows like Freaks and Geeks and Undeclared. However, the script was never entirely shelved, and the two friends worked on it regularly, even writing together in different locations by telephone.\n\nUnderneath all the profanity and the quest for booze and girls, Superbad is a love story betweeen two best friends, Seth and Evan. The casting of both lead characters came easy. Jonah Hill and Michael Cera had already broken into show business. Rogen and Goldberg weren't familiar with Cera's work on Arrested Development, but they had a mutual friend in Jay Baruchel, who recommended Cera for the part of Evan. Cera went on to crush the audition and was cast immediately.\n\nThe part of Seth was expected to be a bit tougher to cast, mostly because the character had to thread the needle between obscene teenage boy and lovable oaf. Enter Hill, who had a small part in Apatow's Knocked Up (2007). While they were on set one day, Apatow asked Hill to read for Seth. It didn't take longer than an hour for Hill to land the part.\n\n“We were literally standing outside Seth’s trailer,” Hill recalls. “We went in, made a tape, and they literally ran it upstairs to Amy Pascal’s office.”\n\n“It was one of those things where within five seconds of him starting we were all like, he can totally do this,\" says Rogen.\n\nThe casting of Fogell, AKA McLovin, proved to be much more difficult. The actor needed to be both dorky and somehow extremely cocky at the same time, while also being antagonistic to Seth. Fogell is the odd man out of Seth and Evan's friendship. Unknown actor Christopher Mintz-Plasse covered all the bases for the character. Despite being green to the acting world, he immediately displayed improvisational chops. Plus, there was the added bonus that in real-life, Hill could not stand Mintz-Plasse - at least at first.\n\n“Chris just immediately shut me down,” says Hill. “So combative. I was really annoyed because this guy wouldn’t let me say anything. And I told Seth and Evan that and they were like, ‘He’s perfect.’”\n\n“Jonah f*cking hated him,” says Rogen. “He was all over Jonah’s lines, completely disrespectful of the process, probably due to a lack of experience. I remember he walked out of the room and Jonah was like, ‘Not that guy.’ And we were just like, ‘Oh my god, you don’t understand how much more that makes us want him.’”\n\nA lot of the events in Superbad actually happened in real life, either to the writers themselves or one of their friends. In 2017, to celebrate the film’s 10-year anniversary, Rogen took to Twitter to answer questions and post a few interesting facts about Superbad. One particular admission put one of the film's most memorable scenes into unexpected context: \"The period blood on the leg scene in Superbad actually happened to my friend at a high school dance and we discovered it after the dance.\"\n\nIf you’re unfamiliar with Superbad, or if you saw the movie and somehow forgot about the scene, here’s a refresher: Evan and Seth are at a wild house party. An extremely inebriated girl begins to grind up against Seth. Afterward, she walks away, and Seth notices there's blood on his leg - and shortly thereafter figures out the origin of the blood.\n\nChristopher Mintz-Plasse was only 17 years old when he filmed Superbad. It was his first movie appearance and, thus, his on-screen hookup scene was also his first. Because he was a minor, his mother had to be on the film set at all times, which made filming the intimate scene awkward for both mother and son.\n\nThe actor was able to find the positive side of shooting that type of scene in front of Mom: \"It was real awkward but it worked out okay because when I watched the movie with her, the [intimate] scene wasn't awkward because she'd been right there when it happened. Afterwards we didn't talk about it; we still don't speak about that moment.\"\n\nThere have been countless movies made about teenagers in high school. But most are written by adults who have totally forgotten what's it like to be in high school. When Rogen and Goldberg started writing Superbad, they were totally green, and had no scriptwriting experience whatsoever. The one advantage they did have? They were actually in high school.\n\n“There were no movies that were really capturing what we were experiencing,” says Rogen. The broad strokes of the popular teen comedies of the time weren't entirely different from the kind of content that wound up in Superbad, but the specifics were all wrong, and the humor Rogen and Goldberg saw came from a totally different direction:\n\nIt was heavily personal and we were around that age, so we felt strongly that we wanted to represent a certain thing that we really understood that wasn't that represented. We liked American Pie and thought it was funny, but we didn't watch it and think in any way that it resembles us. These people look like they're 30 years old. No one that looks like these guys has not had sex in high school. It just seemed crazy, just the look and feel of it and aesthetic of it didn't look or feel anything like our high school. To us, it was the small things we thought were funny, like trying to get a fake ID and trying to get liquor. In American Pie, you go to the party and there's just kegs of beer and everyone is drinking and I was like, I'd rather watch a movie about them trying to get that keg.\n\nThe writers were also naturally gifted in one of the most difficult aspects of writing a movie: penning authentic-sounding dialogue. “Seth and Evan had an incredibly unique way of writing dialogue in the way high school people spoke, and that’s what was magical about the script,” explains producer Judd Apatow. “I knew they were doing something no one had done before.”"
