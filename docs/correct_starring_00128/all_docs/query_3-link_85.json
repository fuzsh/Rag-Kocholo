        "text": "Hollywood truly is the gift that keeps on giving as a Superbad actor, who had a minor role, has revealed he is still earning pretty decent money from appearing in the blockbuster comedy almost 15 years ago.\n\nSuperbad was released in 2007 to enormous box office success and critical acclaim, starring Jonah Hill, Michael Cera and Christopher Mintz-Plasse as high school friends seeking pure debauchery before they separate and go off to college.\n\nCasey Margolis may not be a name you’ll remember but fans will no doubt recall him playing a younger version of Jonah’s character Seth, who was obsessed with drawing penises.\n\nWell, Casey may have had a bit-part but he’s certainly been laughing all the way to the bank over the past decade and some change – excuse the pun – as he’s still receiving royalties from his cameo.\n\nIn a TikTok video, a now grown-up Casey is seen waving around a letter containing details of the royalties he’s earned in recent months.\n\nHe introduced himself as ‘the kid who drew the d***s in Superbad, before revealing the grand total of $255.39 (£189.43).\n\nThat’s not the most he’s received either, as his largest residual cheque was a staggering $6,757.47 (£5,011.37).\n\nEven more impressively, Casey believes he’s earned an estimated $100k (£74k) for starring in the film.\n\nResidual cheques are royalty payments which actors and others in the creative team receive from streaming releases, DVD releases and even reruns of films and TV shows.\n\nSuperbad cleaned up at the box office earning $171m (£127m) – not too shabby for a raucous comedy.\n\nJonah recently addressed the prospect of a Superbad sequel and told W Magazine: ‘I haven’t pitched this to anybody. What I want to do is when we’re like 80, do a Superbad 2.\n\n‘Like, “old-folks-home Superbad”. Our spouses die, and we’re single again. That’s what I want Superbad 2 to be, and that’s the only way I would ever make it.’\n\nGot a story?\n\nIf you’ve got a celebrity story, video or pictures get in touch with the Metro.co.uk entertainment team by emailing us celebtips@metro.co.uk, calling 020 3615 2145 or by visiting our Submit Stuff page – we’d love to hear from you.\n\nMORE : Britney Spears enjoys Hawaiian getaway with fiance Sam Asghari as she reveals she feels as ill as she did when pregnant"
