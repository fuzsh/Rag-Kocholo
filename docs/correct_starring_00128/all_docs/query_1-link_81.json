        "text": "In case you haven't noticed, Twitter is quickly becoming a part of everyone's life, regardless of whether you want it that way. In a new article, Variety reports on the social-media services being used to render \"intelligence\" about how an actor will fit a particular role or sponsorship (one of them is called CastTyper), which makes you actually start to feel kind of bad for celebrities.\n\nThe social-media data reveal that, over time, as Jonah Hill has lost weight and taken on more dramatic roles in Cyrus and Moneyball, America has found him less... funny. Ostensibly because of the stereotype that fat people are jolly and because losing weight is not hilarious (unless you take perverse pleasure in the contestants falling off treadmills on The Biggest Loser). So as Scott Raab says, the jolly fat man lost his jolly.\n\nBut I think there may be a confounding factor in the statistics here: Jonah Hill was at his most lovable when he first became famous, when starring in Superbad, still arguably his best movie and definitely his most warmhearted. Like the other main characters (based loosely on younger versions of the movie's writers, Seth Rogen and Evan Goldberg), he's a harmless, bumbling nerd who just wants to be loved. And therein lies the problem, because Jonah Hill the actor and not the Superbad character has never come across as so warm and fuzzy. In fact, he's always seemed more of a serious, reserved type. This is someone who sees himself as a writer and a director, who talks about modeling himself after P.T. Anderson and the Coen brothers. He does not want to be the court jester, fat or skinny. And that's okay. When The Wolf of Wall Street comes out, he may turn out to be less funny still."
