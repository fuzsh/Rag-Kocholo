        "text": "Jonah Hill strains to keep a straight face in Cyrus.\n\nIt's a busy month for Jonah Hill. Get Him to the Greek—a pseudo sequel to Forgetting Sarah Marshall, which also featured Hill in a secondary role—marked the actor’s first starring role since Superbad and performed just as well as similar hits from the Judd Apatow factory, grossing $36 million over two weeks. Hill's next film, Cyrus, in which he plays the title character, opens this weekend, only two weeks after Greek. (Fox Searchlight recently moved up the release date from an early July opening.)\n\nCyrus is a departure from Hill’s usual Apatovian comedies. It’s the story of a 21-year-old mama’s boy who manipulates his mother’s new relationship with a likeable, schlubby, divorced boyfriend (John C. Reilly), in order to keep her for himself. I met with Jonah Hill in midtown Manhattan to discuss his big month. Hill talks about the intricacies of promoting two films at once, explains why his characters in Forgetting Sarah Marshall and Get Him to the Greek are different, and reveals his plans to bring back 21 Jump Street. Oh, and if ever you run across Hill, who is generally totally genial, be sure to avoid comparing a complex character he put serious time into developing to a four-minute Saturday Night Live sketch he happened to appear in.\n\nMike Ryan: This has been Jonah Hill week for me. I saw Get Him to the Greek and Cyrus on back-to-back nights...\n\nJonah Hill: I apologize.\n\nI feel like I should rush right home and watch Superbad.\n\nYes. Overdose on Jonah Hill.\n\nYour character, Cyrus, who has an interesting relationship with his mother, kind of reminded me of your SNL character Adam Grossman, fifteen years later.\n\nOh, I don't see that at all. The SNL guy was loud and Cyrus is very quiet and manipulative … I don't see it, but more power to you. One is an annoying SNL character and one's a character I worked really hard on in the movie.\n\nYou're known for being part of the Judd Apatow troupe and playing the hilarious sidekick. How important is it, as an actor, to branch out and play roles that are different than what you're known for, like Cyrus?\n\nI never go, \"Oh, man, I've done all of these comedies, I need people to take me seriously.\" It's never like that. You just always want to do things that interest you and you think will be good. Also, you really want to try and challenge yourself to do something different. Cyrus is really different than anything I've ever done. It was challenging, but it was important to just always try to do things that are different.\n\nMy favorite line in Cyrus is when you compared John C. Reilly's hair to a \"crippled tree reaching up to heaven.\" You always seem to have lines like this in your roles. What line in any film that you've done still makes you laugh?\n\nThere's a lot of stuff in Cyrus that I really like. I love this line in Get Him to the Greek where I'm introduced to Meredith Vieira—and I'm drunk and have throw-up all over me—and I say, \"My mom loves your shit.\" I don't know, there's something so simple and uncomfortable about saying that. My mom would love Meredith Vieira, but to say \"loves your shit\"? There's something that really cracks me up about that line. There's a lot of quotable stuff from Greek and Superbad and I think Cyrus, as well. It's kind of hard to choose favorites.\n\nSpeaking of picking favorites, it's unusual for two films that you star in to come out within two weeks of each other. Do you get confused with what film you're supposed to be talking about?\n\nWe did a lot of press [for Cyrus] at Sundance and South by Southwest, but this is the first in a long time after doing Greek press for months. So it is a weird shift to talk about this because, literally, before this and after this I'm doing more Get Him to the Greek press. It is kind of confusing...[But] it’s so thrilling. I never thought in my wildest dreams that I would have two movies that I have such big parts in that come out in the same year, let alone the same month. Also two that are so different from one another—that's really a career goal for me. I absolutely love the big, broader comedies that I get to be a part of and I also love something more small and grounded like Cyrus. [Points to the Cyrus movie poster] Look at that billing: Academy Award nominee [John C. Reilly], me, Academy Award winner [Marisa Tomei], Academy Award nominee [Catherine Keener]. It's crazy.\n\nDoes anyone on the street ever get confused and say, \"I loved you in Freaks and Geeks\"?\n\n[Laughs] No, the only thing that happens often—and not as often anymore… Right after Superbad came out... My character's name in Superbad was Seth. And then there's Seth Rogen who's a friend of mine who's also very famous. He's a very famous guy. So people would say, \"Hey, Seth!\" and they're referring to my character in Superbad. But then I get confused because I think that they think that I'm Seth Rogen, maybe. It's very confusing sometimes. Greek has helped clear that up quite a bit, actually. So that's been nice.\n\nWhat's the better song? The \"unfinished, untitled, doesn't sound like Steve Miller\" song from Cyrus—in which you demonstrate your mixing skills for John C. Reilly—or \"African Child,\" from Get Him to the Greek?\n\nThe \"untitled, doesn't sound like Steve Miller\" song. That might be my favorite comedic scene I've ever done. That's the hardest I've ever laughed during a scene without breaking. It took a long time to shoot that because, when I was playing that, I had to memorize all the different cues for the music and I was actually playing the right chords. And I also had to not break eye contact with John. It was the second day of shooting and I just could not stop laughing. It was so painfully hard to stop laughing.\n\nI read that you're writing a remake of 21 Jump Street?\n\nWe're turning it into a film, yeah. But it's not like an exact remake. It's not like the same characters or anything. It's basically just about young-looking cops that go back to high school. It's not a spoof, but it is a comedy. The big idea that we came up with that we really fell in love with was: What if these guys, who are insecure in high school, grow up and become cops. They gather this confidence but they look too young to be taken seriously as cops. So they get sent back to high school to solve these crimes that have been going on. But, instead of having that confidence they immediately revert back to the way that they were in high school.\n\nThat makes sense. I've lived in New York for six years but anytime I go back to the Midwest, I revert right back to the person I was there.\n\nYeah, the big idea, for me, was seeing certain people from high school triggers me to lose all the confidence that I've gained since then.\n\nVIDEO: Krista Smith interviews Jonah Hill about Cyrus at the 2010 Sundance Film Festival."
