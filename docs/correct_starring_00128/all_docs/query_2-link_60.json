        "text": "Channing Tatum has revealed he’s “dying” for 23 Jump Street to happen.\n\nThe actor starred alongside Jonah Hill in the 2012 comedy 21 Jump Street and sequel 22 Jump Street, in which the pair played undercover police officers Jenko and Schmidt.\n\nAs Channing attended the premiere for his new movie Fly Me to the Moon on Monday, the 44-year-old star revealed he had been discussing the possibility of reprising the role again with Sony Pictures CEO Tom Rothman.\n\n“I’m dying for it to happen,” he told Extra. “I was talking to (Tom) Rothman about it tonight. What’s hard is that we said when we finished the second movie that we weren’t going to make a third, because we thought the second movie might even be better than the first movie, which is rare.”\n\nFollowing the success of 22 Jump Street, executives at Sony Pictures confirmed plans for a crossover with the Men in Black franchise.\n\nHowever, the project fell out of development in 2019, with producer Walter Parkes describing the abandoned film as an “impossible match-up”.\n\nChanning has now sparked fresh hopes he will play Jenko again, as he admitted conversations about a possible follow-up are still ongoing.\n\n“There was an idea and then a script, and the script is kind of a perfect script in my opinion…,” he explained. “We tried to change it, and it didn’t happen for whatever reason. We tried to, like, change it and make it something else, and it was never as good as the first one. I hope Tom can figure it out for us. We literally had the conversation on the carpet tonight.”\n\n© Cover Media"
