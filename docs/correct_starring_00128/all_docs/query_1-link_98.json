        "text": "In late August of 2007, I walked into a packed theater on college night in a college town. I didn’t really know what I was going to see, except that other people wanted to see it and all I had to lose was a couple of hours. The film was called Superbad and the star—co-lead, to be precise—was a guy named Jonah Hill. It was one of those “Who is he?” performances for everyone, admirers and critics alike. Hill had appeared in Evan Almighty and Knocked Up two months prior. His first role was in I Heart Huckabees in 2004. He had a blink-and-you’ll miss it cameo in The 40 Year Old Virgin (2005); he was Barry in Grandma’s Boy and a 17-year-old version of Adam Sandler’s character in Click in 2006; and he was the scene-stealer who dressed in a hot-dog costume in Accepted (also in 2006). I had seen Knocked Up, but he, like Jason Segel, blends so effortlessly into the ensemble in such a way that none of them particularly stands out because they’re all funny. Hill, then, was not an unknown, but his turn in Superbad nevertheless felt like an out-of-nowhere star-making one. I realize that the Judd Apatow-produced, Greg Mottola-directed, Seth Rogen and Evan Goldberg-written teen comedy has its detractors. Some write it off as an American Pie wannabee, while others object to its excessive raunchiness. It certainly didn’t turn everyone into Jonah Hill fans, either. I heard many complaints that he was “annoying” or “obnoxious”—a characteristic more appropriate for the character than the actor—and that all he did was curse and shout. In my opinion, not enough viewers realized that the amateur, highly sexual dialogue and an abundant amount of four letter words actually serves a purpose, as does the irritating immaturity of Hill’s character. Smirk if you will, but I think of Superbad rather fondly, and subsequent viewings have done nothing to redirect my initial feelings. It didn’t hurt that my theatrical experience was so vivid. I could sense that the laughs were born of recognition. I could sense that the uncomfortable silences were born of experiences laced with regret. It was the end of the summer, a time where teenagers must garner a bit of responsibility and commit their last few months to memory. The last few months of many of my fellow August spectators were likely filled with events much like the ones depicted in the film, where mistake-making is written-off as having fun and the threshold of adulthood becomes synonymous with no-strings-attached partying. You look back on these moments with youthful fondness, but there’s something biting there as well, because having “fun” can be pretty miserable.\n\nI think Superbad is just a blast of a movie about friendship, the unknown, growing up, and the realization that what is sold to you on commercials is quite unlike living through it. No, it’s not realistic, but it grounds itself in something instantly relatable. Some might say that it’s not the deepest of screenplays. It’s not Woody Allen or James L. Brooks or Cameron Crowe. It’s not even Kevin Smith. “Yeah, yeah, yeah,” I say. “Fine by me.” It’s very funny; it surprisingly pinches some nerves; and it captures a special atmosphere. I’d be greedy to ask for more. Hill deserves a great deal of credit for its success. He personifies the desperation that is so crucial to the film. He just is that guy that every high-school class has, the guy that would do anything for booze and the chance to impress a girl. Superbad is not about rich kids or Abercrombie models or jocks. It’s about outsiders that can’t understand that there’s nothing on the inside. I was a fan of Hill’s immediately, but many were somehow under the impression that what we did required little skill. If you had told me in August of 2007 that in January of 2011, this actor would receive an Academy Award nomination, I’d have been surprised. Most would have been shocked. Hill’s brilliant underplaying in Forgetting Sarah Marshall (2008), Funny People (2009), and The Invention of Lying (2009) caused some to come around. They discovered that—gasp!—he could do more than curse and shout, that his character in Superbad was not actually him but a character. His little-seen performance as the titular Cyrus, however, truly grabbed the attention of those fortunate enough to encounter it. Until that point, Hill had not been completely unfamiliar with dramatic territory—in film, that is (he did theater at the New School in New York). Consider, for instance, his painful plea to Jules toward the end of Superbad, or his berating of Ira during the Thanksgiving scene in Funny People. But in Cyrus, Hill was acting full-fledged, not merely being funny in a subtle way (not that the two are mutually exclusive, but those who have seen it know what I mean). As a creepy, maladjusted, 21-year-old man-boy living with a mother whose affection he craves a bit too willingly, Hill shows yet another side to his talent.\n\nFor all these reasons, it’s admittedly strange that I’m not over-the-moon about Hill’s Academy Award nomination for Best Supporting Actor in Moneyball. It’s not that I dislike the performance. It’s just that I found it solid as opposed to revalatory. I was more impressed by Patton Oswalt in Young Adult, another comedy-drama crossover actor that was given a chance to shine. The same can be said about Albert Brooks in Drive. Hill’s turn as Peter Brand was neither the best performance he’s given nor one of the top five supporting performances of the last year. Make no mistake, as an unpopular champion of his in 2007, I’m happy for the twenty-eight year-old actor, and I hope this all but silences his earlier critics. At the same time, I can’t help but feeling that there is a truly great dramatic performance within Hill. It’s just not the one given in Moneyball. When he offers it, as I’m sure he will, he’ll probably not be attached to a film as favored as this one, and he’ll probably get snubbed just like Brooks and Oswalt did this year. How’s that for an unexpected career trajectory?\n\n-Rob"
