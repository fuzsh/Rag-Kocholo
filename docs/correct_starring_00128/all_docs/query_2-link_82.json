        "text": "Actor Jonah Hill started his career in the comedy cult classic 'Super Bad' but always wanted to try out more dramatic roles. After a few more gigs as a comedy actor, Jonah Hill finally got his chance at a dramatic role with his job in Brad Pitt's 'Money League'. This role earned him an Academy Award nomination, the first of two he currently has. His second nomination came a year later through Martin Scorsese's 'Wolf of Wall Street' that starred Leonardo Di Caprio. Jonah Hill became an A-List actor after that but he decided to veer onto directing at the same time he was still acting in different roles. So much success means actor Jonah Hill gets paid very well for what he does.\n\nHow much is Jonah Hill worth?\n\nTo be real, the most money he's made has been from his comedy acting roles. Jonah Hill has never moved away from his biggest strength. All he wanted was to prove he is not just one trick pony. Jonah has also dabled in voice acting roles for many different animated films. From all that, his net worth has ascended to $70 million. The roles that brought him the most praise from critics weren't percisely well-paid, he knew that going into them because he did it for the prestige and the exprience.\n\nBecause for example, Jonah Hill has repeatedly told the story of getting paid only $60,000 for his role in 'Wolf of Wall Street'. All he cared about was working with one of the greatest directors in film history. Scorsese made him an offer and he accepted in an instant. Currently, Jonah Hill is back in the comedy movie circuit with a new Netflix film where he works with none other than Eddie Murphy. The movie is called 'You People' and it's out on the platform right now."
