        "text": "You wouldn’t expect a roly-poly comedy actor like Jonah Hill (“Superbad”) to have anything in common with the Ivy League-bred statistical whiz kid he plays in Bennett Miller’s front-office baseball drama, “Moneyball,” which is based on Michael Lewis’ 2003 nonfiction best-seller about Oakland A’s General Manager Billy Beane, who’s portrayed in the film by Brad Pitt, who also pinch-hits as producer.\n\nThe movie chronicles the story of how Beane built a winning baseball team with only a fraction of the money most big league teams have. Hill plays Beane’s new assistant general manager Peter Brand, a guy who evaluates player talent using a statistical system called sabermetrics, a method developed for the cash-strapped A’s to nab players dirt cheap. And, in 2002, with that rag-tag group, Oakland went on to string together a 20-game win streak, the longest in American League history.\n\nHill, who’s dramatically slimmer than when he threw out the first pitch at a Red Sox game when he was in Boston to promote last year’s “Get Him to the Greek,” passed through Beantown again last week, this time to make a different sort of pitch – a hard sell for “Moneyball” during a press day at the Four Seasons Hotel.\n\nHill said he feels a lot like his character – a Yale-educated economist who applies his statistical genius to scouting undervalued baseball players.\n\n“I’m second lead in this big drama ... and the whole experience is just so surreal and dreamlike,” said Hill, 27. “I felt just like my character,” with Pitt and Miller acting like Billy Beane in giving him this opportunity. “They were taking the chance on someone that everyone else overlooked. It’s the first time I got the opportunity to be in this type of movie.”\n\nWith no R-rated raunch to be found, “Moneyball” is a different kind of movie for Hill, whose acting resume is stained with poop and vomit from such popular comedies as “Knocked Up,” “Accepted” and “Forgetting Sarah Marshall.”\n\nIn “Moneyball,” Hill has been bumped up to the big leagues, working with a team of all-star Oscar nominees and winners: Lewis’s best-selling book has been adapted for the screen by Aaron Sorkin (“The Social Network”) and Steven Zaillian (“Schindler’s List”). Besides starring Pitt (“Inglourious Basterds”), it features a small but memorable turn by Philip Seymour Hoffman, who won a Best Actor statue for his role in Miller’s “Capote.”\n\nUnlike the rest of the characters in “Moneyball,” Hill’s Brand is a composite of different people who used sabermetrics, such as Paul DePodesta, a former front office guy for the A’s, and even Red Sox General Manager Theo Epstein.\n\n“I love my character in this movie. I really just love who he is. I think he’s the sweetest and it’s just such a beautiful thing for him in this movie,” Hill said. “He’s a guy who never had a light shined on him before or had someone to believe in him and he has this really powerful guy say, ‘I believe in you and we’re going to do this together.’ It’s just so meaningful. It was such a rich part to get to play.”\n\nTo get ready for the role, Hill said he spent some time with Epstein, a highlight of which was throwing that first pitch at Fenway – “a burner right down the middle, broke the catcher’s hand,” Hill said, showing he hasn’t shed his comic chops along with his weight.\n\nGeography (he’s from L.A.) makes him a Dodgers fan, but Hill said he has a lot of respect for the Red Sox, who have their stamp all over “Moneyball.” Arliss Howard plays Sox owner John Henry. Kevin Youkilis is dubbed the “Greek God of Walks,” accompanied by early footage of the current Sox player. There are other Red Sox connections, too: Johnny Damon leaves the A’s for the Sox as the film opens and Beane and Brand tag former Sox catcher Scott Hatteberg (Chris Pratt, “Parks and Recreation”) as one of those undervalued gems.\n\n“I got to meet Kevin and I told him we were making the movie and he was really excited,” Hill recalled. “(The movie has) greater meaning to Boston. Theo used sabermetrics to break the Curse of the Bambino. If that’s not meaningful for a group of fans, I don’t know what else would be.”\n\nHill stressed, however, that “Moneyball” isn’t really a baseball movie.\n\n“It’s a story about being undervalued and being an underdog, in all senses of the words. I show it to people who could care less about sports, baseball specifically, and love the film because baseball is the backdrop for a moving and beautiful story.”\n\nThe dark-horse story is also one that hits close to home for Hill.\n\n“The way I was introduced to the world was through ‘Superbad.’ It was me saying, ‘Hey, I’m in a movie and would like to make more and I hope you accept that.’ So then I was the underdog. People enjoyed the film and I got to make more comedies. Now, I’m no longer the underdog in comedy.”\n\nNevertheless, Hill said he feels like the long shot.\n\n“I’m touring and it feels very similar to the ‘Superbad’ tour because I’m going around again and saying, ‘I’m in this movie. It’s a different kind of me and I’d like to more of these and I hope you accept that.’ That’s a big theme of the movie – shining a light on someone for the first time.”\n\nAnd with his recent weight loss, Hill looks so dramatically different, you’d be excused if you mistook him for a dramatic new actor on the scene. Unsure of exactly how many pounds he’s shed, Hill said he decided to drop weight to get healthier.\n\n“I went to this nutritionist to help me get healthier and the nutritionist told me to write down all my favorite foods. It was like the menu of a 6-year-old’s birthday party. So that was a pretty eye-opening experience,” Hill said.\n\n“Moneyball” marks the second time Pitt and Hill have worked together. They both voiced characters in last year’s animated film “Megamind.” Hill was a bad-guy superhero to Pitt’s good guy. And, in “Moneyball,” they prove to be quite the dynamic duo.\n\n“Brad really gives a special kind of performance in this movie. He’s really doing some strong work,” Hill said. “He’s fantastic guy and we get along great. It makes the press fun when you actually enjoy each other’s company. He’s such a humble, gracious and intelligent guy. I’m proud to have worked with him and to be his friend.”\n\nHill first ventured into more serious territory last year with “Cyrus,” playing Marisa Tomei’s pathologically possessive son, but he hasn’t forgotten his roots. Later this year he returns to comedy with “The Sitter.” Next spring he’ll open the big screen reboot of “21 Jump Street,” the series that made Johnny Depp a star. A co-writer, Hill stars with Channing Tatum in the action comedy that sends the two young-looking cops back to high school. Hill talked excitedly about the film, but remained tight-lipped on a rumored Depp cameo. “You gotta wait to see.”"
