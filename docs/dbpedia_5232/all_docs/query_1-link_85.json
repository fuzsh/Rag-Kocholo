        "text": "Barisal, the district with the highest literacy rate and the highest poverty rate of the country is mostly known as the Venice of Bengal. Barisal is called the Granary of Bengal as well. Barisal, the district which was formerly known as Bakerganj district is the main hub of the Barisal division which was formerly known as chandrwadip. Barisal has an area of 2784.52 Square Kilometer and possess a population of 24,87,012 (23,43,10). Barisal was found and first encountered in 1797 as Bakerganj district which was later placed into the Barisal division on 1st January,1993.\n\nBarisal geographically is positioned at 220 42 ‘0’ ‘north latitude and 900 22’ 0 ” east longitude and geographically surrounded by Chandpur, Madaripur and Shariatpur districts from the north; Jhalokati, Barguna, and Patuakhali districts are in the south of Barisqal; Laxmipur district and Meghna river on the east and Pirojpur, Jhalokati, and Gopalganj districts are on the west.\n\nThis independent kingdom called Chandradwip was established by King Danuj Mardan during the Muslim reign in South-East Bengal. Until the fourteenth century, the region used to be known as Chandradwip. Before the establishment of this state, this region was known as ‘Bakla’. Bakla means grain trader which comes from the Arabic word. A man named Kanungo built the port of Bakla. Arab and Persian merchants used to come to this seaport to trade. The name Bakla-Chandradwip can be discovered in large letters on a very ancient foreign map. Until 1897, the district was known as Bakla-Chandradwip. Bakerganj district was established in 1898 with the southern part of the Dhaka district. In 1801, the district headquarters of Bakerganj district was shifted to Barisal (Girdebandar). There still exist many discordances corresponding to the origin of the district name, Barisal. Some other popular opinions are “due to gargantuan Shawal tress (Boro+shal= Barisal), or because of the love story of Portuguese Berry and shelly, the name appeared as Barisal or because of the big salt balls, the name appears such. The English and Portuguese merchants used to call this region ‘Barisalt’ for its large salt stocks and large grains of salt. Realizing the historical significance of Barisal, the erstwhile British government in its Bengal District Administration Report of 1913-14 recommended the establishment of the Barisal division including Faridpur and Khulna districts. Later implementation was not possible due to various political reasons. Finally, excluding Faridpur and Khulna districts, the Barisal division was established on 1st January 1993 with the ancient Chandradwip state(present Barisal district) and the greater Bakerganj district.\n\nBarisal is one of the districts of Bangladesh, with which no countries Border is Connected and it is one of the districts (city) with no Train (rail) communication.
