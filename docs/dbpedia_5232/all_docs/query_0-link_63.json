        "text": "Bangladesh is situated in riverine and deltaic region in South Asia where riverbank erosion is a catastrophic climate induced disaster in Bangladesh. The present study has been undertaken to investigate the impact of riverbank erosion on lives and livelihoods of the displaced people in the SouthEastern Bangladesh. Both quantitative and qualitative data have been used through in-depth interviews, focus group discussion and questionnaire survey. The study reveals that riverbank erosion is addressing displacement, hidden hunger and poverty, loss of land and identity of coastal people. Besides, displaced persons face social, economic, cultural stigma in their community. People have used different types of indigenous knowledge to reduce the sufferings of the affected people. The findings of this study are vital for policymakers to articulate and implement effective approaches and programs to reduce vulnerability and to increase the local adaptation processes in order to improve such households' livelihood all over Bangladesh.\n\nThe present study has been taken to discuss the human dimension of the phenomenon and argues the need for a better understanding of the mechanisms underlying erosion-induced people at Haimchar upazila in Bangladesh. The paper emphasizes the importance and need for looking into the phenomena of riverbank erosion, course shifting tendency, population displacement and its impact in socio-economic condition at national scale in order to understand and competently deal with the problem. In this study both primary and secondary data have been used. The primary data include field survey and victims opinion survey from erosion-affected villagers through questionnaire. During the last three decades about 35,605 peoples were displaced in the study area due to river bank erosion. Most of the affected people were living on the embankment. It was noted that there is a great degree of uncertainty as to when land would be devoured by the river; and on an average people were affected 3 times durin...\n\nBangladesh, a disaster-prone South Asian country, is affected by the multiple issues of climate change such as global warming, sea level rise, floods, and riverbank erosion. The issue of climate change has created unprecedented rural risks, shocks, and everyday problems in the lives of the people living in the borderlands of Bangladesh. Based on a field survey in the Northern parts of Bangladesh, Bhurungamari, this chapter details the experiences and perspectives of the rural villagers regarding the issues of floods and riverbank erosions. The work is theoretically based on the sustainable livelihoods framework (SLF). We interviewed 240 people from the villages under the Union Parishad of Bangosona hat, Paiker Chara, and Char Bhrungamari, situated in the district of Kurigram\n\nThe aim of the study is to assess the socioeconomic impacts of River Bank Erosion RBE in Nalua Union which is the second most RBE prone coastal Union of Bakerganj Upazila under Barishal District of Bangladesh. This research is based on primary data including field observation and questionnaire survey, Google earth image interpretation and secondary data. Image interpretation of 2002, 2012 and 2016 shows that the RBE in the bank of Pandob river particularly in the northern part of the study area has been increasing since 2002 and have created different sorts of vulnerabilities and difficulties for the dwellers. All the surveyed households were displaced once or more times. Most of the displaced households have resettled their houses in nearby land or nearby rural areas, and became financially weak. In some cases, RBE has weakened the social bonding of the displaced households. Although the surveyed households are suffering greatly due to RBE, but they did not take any initiatives for controlling and managing this unwanted catastrophe. Financial inability, tendency of shifting of the victim families than controlling, high stream velocity, no possible sustainable measures and willingness of God have been identified as the major reasons for not taking any initiatives for reducing the RBE by the local dwellers. In this research it is suggested to create concrete pilling/block and dredging the river in order to control and manage the river bank erosion. It is also necessary making honest political leadership for making demand list and implementing the development work as and when required.\n\nThis study is designed to explore the local people survival strategies and assesses variation in people’s ability to cope with flood and riverbank erosion of two char land (Mid-channel Island) villages of Bangladesh. The data were collected by the application of social survey, key informant interview, focus group discussions and field observation. Most of the people of the char land villages were affected by both flood and river erosion. The result of the study showed that devastating river erosion occurred in Shushua char as compared with Degreer char in 2010 and people tried to adapt with adverse situation by their own techniques. People of both the chars were experienced flooding more than two months in the same year. Household’s ability to adapt with flood and river erosion depends on people’s socioeconomic and environmental conditions, such as education, income and occupation. Though, flood and river erosion cause the loss of lives and properties, people’s indigenous coping techniques could significantly reduced their vulnerability without outside assistance. Effective early warning system, integrate local coping practice with modern technology and improve socioeconomic condition in a sustainable way are necessary to reduce the losses from flood and riverbank erosion."
