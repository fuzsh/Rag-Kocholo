        "text": "In this multiple case study I use Foucault’s theory of power/knowledge in exploring how Muslim students negotiate their religious and civic identities. Three themes are revealed. The first theme explores how Muslim students use their body and language in performing their religiosity and develop a counter-discourse of self expression and resistance in public schools. In the second theme I explain the liberating function of public education and the difference between dogmatic and non-dogmatic religious education. The third theme explicates how discourses of Orientalism and othering work in public schools, and how they affect the experiences and identities of Muslim students.\n\nCitizenship in its contemporary context has developed in tandem with the expansive role and functions of the nation state. The Islamic notions of belonging to a political community, territory, and a system of rule are all present in the source data of the Qur’an and hadith. Yet they remain undeveloped and also burdened with accretional jurisprudence that has developed around the notions of dar al-Islam and dar al- arb (abode of Islam, and abode of war respectively). The main purpose of this essay is to contextualise the Islamic notion of citizenship with its contemporary context, while also attempting to strip the authoritative guidelines of Islam from its archaic concepts and additions that on the whole tend to be less than helpful. This is one side of the picture I present. In another, yet quite fundamental sense, the rules of fiqh on residence and domicile within the wider dar al Islam are far less restrictive than the Immigration and citizenship laws of the present-day Muslim countries.\n\nSince 11 September 2001 Muslim Diasporas have emerged as objects of anxiety in Western societies. Underlying this (in)security-driven problematisation is the question of whether Muslims living in the West have the capacity to become fully active citizens while maintaining their religious beliefs, rituals and practices. This apprehension has prompted reactionary government programmes, particularly targeting young Muslims. Such responses fail to recognise the societal capacities that practising Muslims possess, including those informed by the ethical precepts of Islamic faith. This paper argues that it is timely to explore expressions of Islamic religiosity as they are grounded in everyday multicultural environments. The paper draws on survey data and interviews conducted with Muslims living in Melbourne, Australia. We take into consideration key variables of age and generation to highlight how young, practising Muslims enact citizenship through Islamic rituals and faith-based practices and traditions. The paper will draw from key findings to argue that these performances provide a foundation for exploring ways of ‘living’ together in a manner that privileges ethics central to Islamic faith traditions.\n\nThis study addresses the religious identification of young people from an immigrant background in the context of a sociological perspective. This study is essentially focused on young people&#39;s perceptions of their religious identities. We tried to understand the religious markers exhibited by young people attending a religious Muslim school in Canada. How do these students construct identity in the gears of religion, school, home society and parental culture? Young people are thus given the opportunity to express their identity-building perspectives. Through an ethnographic stay, the data collection took place in a private school located in Quebec, Canada. The data analysis allowed us to identify some religious identity markers developed by participants during their biographical and social paths. Participants are hence distinguished as a cultural group in a minority context. These religious markers also seem more adapted to the context of young people and more open to others\n\nThis article investigates the role religiosity plays in the ways young Australian Muslims enact themselves as citizens in a context in which their right to belong to the political community is often seriously questioned. Australian responses to 9/11, 7/7 and the Cronulla Riots have relied on an understanding of Muslim youth identity that sees young Muslims’ religiosity primarily as a barrier to the development of good citizenship practices. Against this backdrop, this article explores the ways in which religiosity informs the everyday acts of citizenship through which young Muslims challenge dominant narratives of citizenship. Drawing on an ethnographic study of two Melbourne-based Shia youth groups, I look at the subjective accounts of multicultural citizenship that youth group members shared in the course of the groups’ weekly activities. In doing so, I draw particular attention to the role religion plays in the imaginative ways young Australian Muslims fashion themselves into citizens.\n\nHow might Islamic values inspire teachers to educate the younger generation to become multicultural citizens in Indonesia? Is it possible for teachers in Islamic senior high schools (Madrasah Aliyah) to use Islamic values, in the context of civic education, to cultivate a multicultural citizen? Around Yogyakarta Province, Indonesia, civic educators have reported differences of interpretation and meaning regarding notions of \"Islamic multiculturalism\" and the \"civic multiculturalist\", between the classroom and the school culture in Madrasah Aliyah schools. Moreover, teachers have experienced challenge and resistance when attempting to integrate the Islamic faith with multicultural values in their citizenship classrooms. The paper will explore \" the spirit of Islam \" as a living value for multicultural society. A case study of civic education teachers working in three Madrasahs in Yogyakarta Province will provide success stories when integrating the Islamic faith with multicultural values in their classrooms; thus uniting the goals of the civic education curriculum with the mission of their school as an Islamic institution."
