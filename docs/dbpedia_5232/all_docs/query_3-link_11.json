The geographical outline of the island may be dismissed in a very few words, and it is only the interior that will require a more minute description. The maritime districts, comprising about a half of the width of the southern, eastern, and western provinces, are flat ; the northern province, and the northern portion of the eastern province, are wholly so. Perhaps this division of the island may vary in ele- vation from twenty to two hundred feet. It exhibits extensive plains, either quite level, as towards the coast, or approaching the interior, slightly undulating ; in the former case being almost entirely without a hill, in the latter interrupted by chains of low hills and solitary- masses of rock rising from one to five hundred feet above the plain. The character of the interior of the island greatly varies in relation to surface. Nowhere is the distinction of high and low land more obvious. With tolerable precision it maybe divided into flat country, hilly and mountainous. The mountainous division is skirted by the billy, and the latter is, as we have already observed, bounded on three sides by a flat maritime belt, and on the fourth by a flat country, comprising nearly one-half of the island. If the island then were divided into two equal parts by an imaginary line from east to west, the mountainous region would be found to occupy nearly the middle of the southern half, or as nearly as possible what is now called the Central Province. The centre of this region is about 7° 3' north latitude, and 80° 46' east longitude. Its greatest length, that is from north to south, may be computed at 02, and its greatest width, that is from east to west, at 56 miles. The exact boundaries and extent of the hilly division, are not so easily described. On an •188 CEYLON. [PART IV. average, it extends beyond the mountains from fifteen to twenty miles. The features of each of the three divisions of the island are neces- sarily peculiar ; grandeur is the characteristic of the mountainous, beauty of the hilly, and tameness of the flat country, which a covering of luxuriant vegetation, with few exceptions, spread over the whole, does not tend to diminish. The mountainous district varies in its perpendicular elevation above the sea level, from 800 to 8000 feet. In general it averages about 2000 feet, the regions of greater elevation, by which are to be under- stood masses of continuous surface approaching more or less to table land, are inconsiderable in extent. The principal are that portion of the country lying between Maturatta and Fort M 'Donald, which is the very heart and centre of the mountainous division, and which reaches 4000 feet, and the tract adjoining Nuwera Elliya, which reaches 5000 feet. In few countries do mountains exhibit greater variety of forms and directions. They most frequently occur connected in chains, and terminating in rounded or peaked summits. Their sides are always steep, and occasionally precipitous and rocky. Solitary insulated mountains are of rare occurrence. In some districts the mountain chains run in a parallel direction, in others even adjoining mountains do not correspond with any regularity in their direction. Thus in Doombera, the mountain ridges generally run N.N.E. and S.S.W. In Ouva, on the contrary, they run in various directions. One remarkable circumstance in reference to Ceylon, is, that no correspon- dence can be traced between the proportional heights of the mountains and the depths of the adjoining valleys. Thus there is not a single lake nor even stagnant pool among the mountains, and it is scarcely credible that they ever existed, as they could not well be filled up by the detritus of rocks, little liable to decay and disintegration. Since there are no lakes in the interior, it is hardly necessary to add that every valley has an outlet, and that the descent of every valley is gradual though irregular from the mountain to the plain. The forms and directions of the valleys are not less various than those of the mountains by which they are constituted. In general their width bears but a very small proportion to their length ; often they are extremely narrow. The deepest are in the heart of the moun- tains. Some are between three and four thousand feet deep, and not perhaps more than half a mile w kle from one mountain to the other. The hilly division of the interior varies in respect of its continuous surface from one to five hundred feet ; and the hills themselves may vary in perpendicular height from two hundred to one thousand feet. Like the mountains, they are more or less connected with chains generally of little length. Their outlines are rounded and gentle ; their sides seldom steep, and their appearance comparatively tame. In the valleys formed by the hills there is nothing peculiar to be noticed. CHAP. I.] NORTHERN PROVINCE DISTRICT OF POMPARIPPO. 489 Commencing with the Northern, at its point of junction with the Western Province at the Pomparippo-oya,1 with one of whose af- fluents it is coterminous to its source, we shall follow the circuit of the island as the best method of developing its moral and physical peculiarities. The boundaries of this province are the sea and the Gulf of Manaar to the West and North-west, Palk's Strait and the 13ay of Bengal to the North and North-east, the Eastern Province to the East, the Central Province to the South-east, and the Western Province to the South South-west. The Pomparippo-oya has its source in the mountains of the dis- trict of Matale, and subsequently uniting itself with the waters of the Kalawewe tank, about fifteen miles to the north of Dambool, winds through the province of Nuwera Kalawa in a north-westerly direction. After entering the district of Pomparippo it divides itself into five branches, and falls into the Gulf of Calpentyn. The Singhalese call it Kalawa-oya, from its passing through the tank of that name ; but there is a tradition that it is derived from the circumstance of the ancient inhabitants of Nuwera Kalawa having bathed in its waters, and previously rubbed their bodies with turmeric (kaha), which had been sent to them as a present by the Prince of Kurunaigalla, as a mark of his contempt. It abounds in fish, and swarms with alli- gators. The principal branch of the river runs four miles below the village of Pomparippo, and is fordable except after the heavy rains. The remains of a stone bridge built over this river by the King Mahasen more than 1500 years ago, were discovered by Forbes in 1826, while on his road from Kurunaigalla to Anuradhapoora. It consisted of a pier of considerable length, projecting into, and con- tracting, the stream, which is there both broad and rapid. The stones used in its construction vary from eight to fourteen feet in length ; they are laid in regular lines, and some are jointed into one another : each course also recedes a few inches from the edge of the one underneath ; and this form, while offering less direct resistance to the current, gives additional strength to the building. The end of the pier has been swept away, but the extremity of that remaining is eighteen feet above the water, and six feet above the causeway. In the rocks, which form the bed of the river, square holes may be distinguished, in which stone pillars have been placed, and the bridge was completed by laying long stones or beams of wood on these to connect the different parts of the structure. At a short distance fur- ther clown the stream, the site of another hi idge can be traced, which appears to have been constructed on the same plan, but either at an earlier period, or of less durable materials. The large stones have been riven from the adjacent rocks by means of wedges, and the 1 Ganga is generally and properly used to denote a river of the first class, such as the Mahavelle or Kalane. Oya, an (innavigable stream or rivulet. Aar, is the Malabar or Tamul name, denoting river. 490 CEYLON. [PART IV. shape and ornament has been completed by chisels. This manner of working quarries and splitting stones is everywhere observable in Cey- lon, and these means for procuring large granite pillars, and shaping their ornaments, which are of a comparatively recent date in Great Britain, were in vogue in Ceylon two thousand years ago. In con- formity with the wild tradition of the natives, that Mahasen could compel even the demons to work for him, and that this bridge is a speci- men of their masonry, the ruins here are known by the name of Yakka- Beudi-palam (bridge built by devils). In the upper row a stone is pointed out, on the under side of which the figure of the architect is said to be cut. The district of Pomparippo, which is bounded on the east by Nuwera Kalawa and Demelapattoo, and on the north by the Mari- chikattie or Moderagam-Aar, is upwards of twenty miles long and eight broad, and contains thirty-five villages. The face of the country exhibits an expanse of large forests, diversified with open tracts, and a ridge of hills runs along its western borders up to Kooderamalai point. It is supposed that the name Pomparippo, or Pomparappee, signifying \" the golden plains,\" was bestowed on this province on account of its excellent soil, but owing to its scanty population, its agricultural resources are very circumscribed. It abounds, however, with cattle, and carries on a trade with Colombo in ghee, honey, bees' wax, and deer's horns. In this district the ruins of many ancient buildings and tanks may still be traced, indicating that this part of the country, at present overgrown with jungle, was formerly thickly peopled, and in a flourishing condition. We have elsewhere seen that Nawaratna Wanniya, a Mookwa chieftain, obtained the hereditary fee of this district from a Singhalese monarch, but it did not long continue in his family, being parcelled out by his heirs and transferred to other individuals. The village of Pomparippo is situated on a large plain, about four miles to the north of the ford, and is chiefly inhabited by Moormen and Hindoos of industrious and contented habits. In its neighbourhood deer are to be met with in great numbers, and afford good sport to those who are fond of coursing and disregard the danger of hard- riding over broken ground. The wooded nature of the country and coarse vegetation of the plains render it necessary that the dogs be fleet ; they must also be strong and high mettled enough to speed through the prickly plants so common in the open grounds of Ceylon. In dry seasons the ground is intersected by numerous cracks, and wherever the deep footsteps of elephants have sunk during the rainy season they become hardened by the sun, and are a serious obstacle to the progress of horses. Pomparippo has a stone rest house, and in the neighbourhood of the post there are plantations of fruit-bearing trees and a vineyard. The first stage from Pomparippo northwards is through the village of Marrunde or Mardodde, (8f miles) to the rest house of CHAP. I.] ISLE KARETIVOE — KUDBAMALAI. 491 Marichikattie, 16^ miles, which is on the north side of the river. The Moderagam or Marichikattie-aar rises in the interior, and after a sinuous course of upwards of forty miles, in a north-westerly direc- tion, falls into the Strait of Manaar at Moderagam. Its waters seem to have been advantageously employed for supplying the tanks of the district. The road along this country is very sandy and bordered on the east by dense jungles, i swarming with wild beasts, with the exception of a few villages, and their dependent paddy fields. The Padouas, many of whom are found here, and who were formerly considered so low and degraded that they were restricted from play- ing on any musical instrument whatever, nullified the stern edict of their oppressors by drawing sounds from earthen chatties with the breath, to which they keep admirable time in the dance. The island of Karadive (Karetivoe), twelve miles north-west of Cal- pentyn, which goes to form part of the Gulf of Calpentyn, is separated from the mainland by a narrow channel of about five miles broad at its southern, and eight at its northern extremity. It is about nine miles long, and from one to two broad ; in the middle is a large pond surrounded by an open space covered with coarse grass, and both ends of the island are overgrown with jungle, rising from a swampy soil, though there is no timber on the island. It is com- monly believed that this island was formerly connected with the peninsula of Calpentyn ; and that the inhabitants of the latter place were wont to resort to a Hindoo temple, which then stood there, but has since been separated from it by the encroachments of the sea. This tradition would seem to derive strength from the circumstance that such a temple is now remaining on the island, but in a dilapi- dated state. The jungle of keeri shelters large herds of deer, and excellent sport may here be found by beating the brushwood. Though barren and uninhabited, it forms, from its advantageous situation for fishing, a rendezvous for fishermen from Manaar and Negombo during the north-east monsoon. Some years since a pearl bank was discovered off Karadive, and was fished in 1 832. Koodremale or Kudramalai (Horse mountain) is one of the prin- cipal features of the Pomparippo district, and the most interesting in 1 It is believed by the Hindoos that many of the combats and scenes described in the Ramayana occurred in this part of the island ; that the rough beads, bangles, and other ornaments of very coarse coloured glass, found in great quan- tities, mixed with the soil in the tank and vicinity of Pasimadoe, are the remains of the fallen warriors of that period, and that Marambu, Pomparippo, Mari- chikattie, Mardodde, &c. &c. preserve by their names the recollections of that great war. The Swaita-ma-parwatia, the white rocks which were the key of Rama's position, the Ranabhumi, battle-field in which Rawana fell, and the splendid fort of Sri-Lanka-poora are all supposed to lie whelmed beneath the ocean on this side of Ceylon. The more rational mode of accounting for the abundance of these singular relics of the past on this spot is, that a manufactory of that article must have once existed there. 492 CEYLON. [PART IV. connection with the antiquities of Ceylon. It is supposed by most Avriters to be the Hippurus or Hipporus,1 mentioned by Pliny, lib. vi. cap. 22. as the port to which a freedman of Annius Plocamus, who farmed the customs of the Red Sea, in the reign of the Emperor Claudius, was unexpectedly driven, after having been blown off the Arabian coast in a violent tempest. A considerable settlement, composed of Arab immigrants, existed in the eighth century, in the neighbourhood of the hill, who sub- sequently supplied their brethren at Manaar and Mantotte with an abundance of pearls, which they probably obtained on the coast. In the woods beneath the hill, which now harbour innumerable wild beasts and reptiles, native tradition traces the site of a royal residence, once occupied by an Amazon princess, called Alliarasany, whose amours with one of the heroes of the Mahabnarat, form the subject of an interesting drama. On the north side of the hill is a small mosque erected over the tomb of a Mahommedan saint, to whose shrine, the navigators of that faith, in touching here on their way to and from the coast, invariably present an offering. The next stage from Marichikattie is to the pagoda of Kall-aar, a Hindoo temple seven and a half miles distant, which is now dilapidated but was once so famous, that the priests who officiated in it were allowed many important privileges, including a moiety of the pearl oysters fished on the banks off Kondatchie. The coolies here ex- change money for ashes, which they rub over their arms and fore- heads to ward off the dangers of the journey, and preserve them- selves and families in health. The scenery between Pomparippo and Kall-aar, if it were more diversified, would be magnificent. The trees to the right of the road are of the highest dimensions, and their foliage cannot be sur- 1 The freedman of Annius Plocamus is supposed to have preceded but a short time, Hippalus, the discoverer of the south-west monsoon, which was called after his name. Of the precise situation of Hippurus, we are not informed, but learn that it was a port to the northward ; and it is plain that it must have been on the western coast, from the circumstance of Hippalus having been blown across during his sailing round Arabia. A conjecture has often suggested itself, which the latent etymology of the name given to the port at which Hippalus arrived, in two different languages might, with a trifling literal alteration in one of the names, seem to sanction. The name by which the port is called in Pliny is Hippuros, 'iirirovpoQ (the horse's tail), as Arcturus is the bear's tail; now sup- posing the name to have been really Hipporos, we shall have for the name of the port 'i-mropoc, instead of the former, which in English will signify ' horse moun- tain.' Is it possible, then, to find on the north-western coast to which Hippalus was carried, any trace of such a name ? It is clearly evident in the name given to the highland north of Calpentyn, in the Malabar language, Koodra-malie, literally horse-mountain, and it is remarkable, that the port of Calpentyn and the inland coast adjoining Kudramalai, are the only parts of the coast between Manaar and Negombo, into which he could have entered. At this day, vessels from the coast are often detained at Calpentyn, on their way to Colombo, without the power of advancing further against the south-west monsoon. CHAP. I.] DISTRICTS OF MOESSELLIE AND NANAATAN. 493 passed for beauty and variety of tint. This portion of the country is liable to inundation during the rainy season. The natives on this part of the coast purify the thick, white, muddy, and unwholesome water, by means ef a nut called arnbu- prasudana, which is abundant in the dry parts of Ceylon, and when rubbed down in the inside of an earthenware vessel, clears the water by precipitating the earthy particles. The common oyster abounds on the coast between Putlam and Kall-aar, and its gathering and pickling for Colombo and Kandy, would give employment to a large number of the natives, if they were induced to embark in it. The Kall-aar (Rock river) has its source in the interior, and falls into the sea about fifteen miles south of Manaar. The next stage is to Kondatchie, the great seat of the pearl fishery, which like Kall-aar, is in the district of Moessellie. This district is bounded on the east by the Wanny, on the south by the Moderagam, and on the north by the Arippo river. It contains about eighty-five villages, the greater part of which are inhabited by Moormen, who have come over from the opposite coast and settled here. The country is level, and as the soil is better adapted for paddy cultivation than any thing else, the inhabitants prepare their lands chiefly for this grain. The forests abound with elephants, and teem with every kind of game and reptile. The whole of the shore encircling the bay of Kondatchie is an arid, sandy desert, almost without a redeeming feature, or water to quench the thirst of the traveller. The moment the fishery is over, Kondatchie' s glory ceases, and it becomes the same miserable spot that it has been for ages. Four 'miles north of Kondatchie is Arippo, (a sieve, in allusion to the sifting of pearls) . Here on an elevated bank near the sea shore, stands ' the Doric,' a mansion erected by Governor North, and so called from the front being of that order of architecture. During the period of the pearl fishery, it is the residence of the Supervisor, but it is open as a rest house to European travellers. Arippo has now a direct communication with Kandy, by means of the new road to Anuradhapoora. The village is situated near one of the mouths of the Awerie-aar, is four leagues south of Manaar, and contains up- wards of 180 inhabitants, composed chiefly of fishermen. It boasts of a small fort with two bastions and barracks, and a Roman Catholic Church, the resort of the Malabar divers, &c, during the fishery. The rest house at Arippo is commodious, and there are springs of excellent water in the vicinity, which are the more pre- cious from the difficulty of obtaining it any where else. Arippo is memorable as the first place at which Knox arrived on the coast, after his escape from nineteen years' captivity in the Kandian country. The Awerie-aar, or river of Arippo, rises far in the interior in the southern districts of Nuwera Kalawa. It is there known by the Singhalese name of Malwatte oya (flower garden river). After pass- 494 CEYLON. [PART IV. ing by Anuradhapoora, it makes a bend to the north-east, it then receives the waters of the Kurnndu-oya, and taking a north-westerly course through a part of the Wanny, enters the limits of Nanaatan near the Giant's tank, whence it turns due west till it runs into the sea, after a course of about eighty-five miles. In the bed and banks of this river, a species of red and blue stone, known by the name of * Manaar stones,' is found by sifting the sand. The district of Nanaatan is about fourteen miles long, and from five to nine miles broad, and contains about 188 villages. It pro- duces a great quantity of paddy, and the peasantry are more indus- trious than their neighbours. The village of Nanaatan is about four miles distant from the northern bank of the Awerie-aar. The Portuguese erected a church here which fell to decay many years ago, and the present one has been raised on its site. Large quan- tities of betel are grown here, and it supplies the whole neighbour- hood with this article. The report of Capt. Schneider, Chief Colonial Engineer, to Sir Thomas Maitland, on the Giant's Tank (Cattoekare), shews the number of acres in the Mantotte and Nanaatan districts, which it is capable of irrigating ; the lands it formerly irrigated, and what repairs are necessary to that end. The river connected with this tank is what the Dutch called the Moessellie River, and now called the Awerie- aar. The dam of Cattoekare must, says he, be built up with earth, six sluices must be built with arches, and stone dams will have to be constructed where the superfluous water is to run over. Canals will also have to be cut to the river, where small sluices will have to be formed. The Giant's tank is thus described : \"This tank, supposed by the natives to have been constructed by Sodien (Giants), consists of a large spot of low land, surrounded from the north-west to the south side, by an earthen dike or dam to keep the water within confined in the rainy season, and to water the paddy fields when necessary. It is, how- ever, in several places broken or washed away, in some places is scarcely visible, and consequently no water remains at present. At certain spots outside the tank, on the north and south sides of the dam are to be seen rivulets by which the water runs down from the tank into the sea. On the south side of the tank is the Moessellie river, the water of which runs from the highlands into the sea, but only during heavy rains. This river swells in some years nine feet above its banks, though its bed is twelve feet deep. About nine miles from the south end of the dam of Cattoekare is a stone dam lying across, built up with large hewn stones, some of which are from seven to eight feet long, from three to four broad, and from two and a half to three feet thick, made fast with cement, the length of this dam is about 600 feet, the breadth from 40 to 60 feet, and the height from 8 to 12 feet. The whole must have been constructed at enormous labour. Near this stone dam is a canal to lead the remaining water CHAP. I.] CATTOEKARE OR GIANT'S TANK. 495 of the river to the tank, but this work seems to have been abandoned about half way, and has since broken down at four different places, where it discharges itself again into the river. Several persons have formed fields and erected small tanks within the Giants' tank, where at the date of this report, were 23 villages with cultivated grounds, sufficient to sow 3,121 parrahs. Outside the tank are a great number of villages, all of which have their small tanks, for the retention of water for their own use. The extent occupied by these tillages is sufficient to sow 16,500 parrahs. \" The extent of the tank Cattoekare is about 20,000 parrahs of sowing ground. The height of the various parts of the dam above the level of the sea varies, being respectively 30 feet, 54 feet, and 67 feet. The natives opine that from the mere water of the rivulets running into Cattoekare, independent of the river, the tank might be fully supplied, but to make the work more certain, the abandoned canal might be continued, and would only need to be four feet broad and six feet deep, by which means the superfluous water of the river would find its way, and a similar canal might be cut on the north side of the tank, to conduct the water from the highlands on that side. It would take three years to complete this work, meanwhile the agriculture both within and without the tank might be carried on as before. The Mantotte and Nanaatan districts can only be assisted with water from Cattoekare if repaired, being a land of large extent and without mountains, whence there is little rain. This land is bounded on the north by Werteltivoe and Pannengammo, on the east by Chitty colom, on the north-west and west by the sea, on the south by the Moessellie river, and contains 255 large and small villages, having in cultivated grounds 21,000 parrahs. Nanaatan has in addition 32 villages to the south of the Moessellie river, and 1 2 villages beyond the tank Cattoekare, which cannot be irrigated by that tank, but only by the repair of the smaller tanks now in use, besides these are 23 villages within Cattoekare, which have 3,121 parrahs of cultivated grounds which by repairing the said tank will be done away, but the people can be indemnified with a similar quantum of land outside. This part of the country cannot be sown without artificial irrigation, from the paucity of rain, and the ground is hard and clayey ; the crop requires water therefore from the time the rain ceases until it is fully grown. \" A custom prevails of sowing the tanks with such paddy as can bear an abundance of moisture, and this is done before the rain, with a mammootie, and when the cultivator can do nothing else, the ground being much softer there than in the ordinary fields. In process of time, the small tanks could be turned into fields. Some of the small tanks are still in a tolerably good condition, and their repair might be left to the husbandmen themselves, on condition that the money be not paid till the repairs are approved of. The extent of the lands outside of Cattoekare is 166,000 496 CEYLON. [PART IV. parrahs of ground, from which, after deducting 9 1 ,000 parrahs for pasture ground, &c, and 21,000 now cultivated, 54,000 parrahs might at once be cultivated and turned into proper fields, making 25,000 parrahs which can be supplied with water from the Cattoekare, and would give for the first crop 70,000 parrahs duty, and for the second 15,000, and in case the people paid one tenth more for the supply of water, then the Government, after deducting all expenses for repairing the dam, sluices, &c. &c, would receive an income of 100,000 rix-dollars, besides the benefit to the people, and the maintenance pf an increased population. The cost of repairing the Giant's tank he estimates at 250,000 rix-dollars. The two provinces of Mantotte and Nanaatan,\" says Schneider, \"have not this year, i. e. 1808, yet contributed 2,000 rix-dollars, and it is because many fields have been abandoned from want of water after the crop has been half grown, which has made the cultivator dejected, and has depopulated the country. The repairs of the small tanks in the same districts in a season of plentiful rain, would produce a revenue of 20,000 rix-dollars per annum, but this could only be relied on in case of rain. The soil of these districts is naturally rich, but the want of rain for years together has caused the cultivator to despair.\" The next stage in proceeding northwards from Arippo is Bangalle, (Vankale), eight miles distant, a village in the district of Mantotte, situate on a sandy beach near the sea. It has a Romish Church built of stone, but the inhabitants are far from numerous, and almost entirely employed in the fishery. The Colombo road branches off here in two directions, one leading to Manaar, and the other to Jaffna. Four miles from Bangalle is the village of Mantotte (Mantai), where there is a large storehouse used as a depot for the tithe, and a rest house, the former having been built by the Por- tuguese for a church, and the latter as a parsonage house attached to it. At a small distance to the east of the village, there are some ancient ruins, which tradition mentions as being the site of buildings belonging to a company of goldsmiths, but there cannot be a question that Mantotte was formerly the site of a considerable Gentoo city, if not the temporary emporium of trade between the East and West. It is supposed by Mr. Tumour to have been founded by Elaala, 205 b.o., but he does not state the grounds on which he rests his opinion. The present ruins found near Mantotte, and which are of brick and mortar, lead us back no further than six centuries, and coincide with the date of Arabian enterprise. The credulity of a degenerate posterity, and the mingled feelings of admiration and awe with which they witnessed works they could not imitate, has led them to perplex the annals of their foundation with the web of fiction, and to assign superhuman proportions to the architects and labourers employed in rearing the mighty granitic piles that have CHAP. [.] DISTRICT OJP MANTOTTE. 497 baffled the devastation of ages. Hence the robust labour segre- gated to execute the magnificent conceptions of a monarch, is now impersonated in giants of forty feet stature, or demons exorcised into executing the behests of his superior will. In the time of De Mello, Commander of Manaar, 1575, some Roman houses were opened in the province of Mantotte, and in the time of the Dutch, many Roman ruins and pieces of mavble-work were to be seen. In examining the foundation, an iron chain of very different form and design to any thing made in India, was dis- covered. They found also three pieces of copper coin, one of which was entirely worn away, and a gold coin, on one side of which was the image of a man from the breast upwards ; at the edge was deciphered part of a superscription, in which the letter ' C,' sup- posed to refer to Claudius, was visible. On another coin were dis- covered the letters ' R, M, N, R,' supposed by Valentyn to have formed part of the word Romanorum. The same writer conjectures that these coins were brought thither by the freedman of Annius Plocamus, but I confess I do not see why we should limit ourselves to such a source, when we know that both Roman and Greek coins must have been in part the circulating media employed in Oriental commerce, one of whose emporia was doubtless in this very district. The line of argument, if argument it can be called, taken by Major Forbes, in his notice of the vestiges of antiquity and the traditions of former mercantile emporia on this coast, appears to me to be unworthy of a writer, whose judgment on most points is gene- rally so sound. Since there are at least two fallacies discoverable in his argument, it may not be improper to recapitulate briefly what the advocates of the threefold point, to which I shall presently advert, infer from the statements of the ancient writers, our know- ledge of the navigation of these seas by the ancients, the state of navigation during the middle ages, and the vestiges of great an- tiquity that still remain. That point, as I before remarked, is of a threefold nature, and has strict reference to a particular time, to particular agency, and I might add, a particular mode of operation. By particular time, I mean to imply that the commerce supposed to have had its centre here, as an emporium, was limited to a con- tracted space, one of the incidents either unnoticed or misrepresented by Major Forbes : by particular agency, I refer to the three nations or peoples by whom this commerce was conducted, viz. the Shire or Seres, by whom the eastern transit was undertaken, the Malabars and latterly the Indo-Moors, who acted as agens de change, and the Arabians and Greeks who engaged in the western transit, that is from Ceylon, and at different epochs, from the Malabar coast. But here again, Major Forbes is at fault, and he confuses the three com- ponents of the population of Ceylon in a case, in which a dis- tinction is absolutely necessary to elucidate the subject. By a par- ticular mode of operation, I refer to the exchange which took place 2 K 498 CEYLON. [fAUT IV- between the two great mercantile nations. The principal ground of Major Forbes's hostility to the whole theory in question, would seem in a great measure to rest on the assumed poverty and tameness of character of the Malabars and Indo-Moors. But this is a point on which much stress need not be laid, though I cannot allow, without a protest, an inference of their former to be drawn from their present state. But I maintain further that it is not necessary to shew that the Malabars took any active part in the transaction at all ; the country inhabited by them, or in their power, happened by a physical accident to be on the highway of the trade between the East and the West, where the parties to the trade could effect a mutual exchange, and save on either side a protracted navigation. A hundred circumstances can be imagined, all within the range of pro- bability, to account either for the Malabars, &c. themselves partici- pating in the commerce, their contenting themselves with deriving the incidental advantages which it is obvious must have accrued to them, letting alone all active participation, or their being coerced by the Arabians and Greeks, a far more warlike people, into resigning the points of the coast which would avail for ensuring the safety of mercantile operations. One circumstance which almost amounts to a proof in favour of the theory I have endeavoured to expound, is the peculiar character of the country, which is supposed to have been the theatre of this commerce. The soil of the district, though far from barren under irrigation, is naked and parched to an extreme, where removed from its influence ; the atmosphere also is dry to an excess, from the hot winds which at times destroy all vegetation within their range. How came it to pass, then, that a numerous and powerful nation, in former times, fixed its residence in this most unprofitable and uncongenial part of the island, and what were the causes that afterwards made it forsake it, and leave it to its original desolation ? Neither the facts that the Hindoo invaders of Ceylon occupied this country as a pre- liminary to their inroads into the interior, and erected the buildings, of which but few vestiges remain, or that pilgrims from the penin- sula landed here in great numbers on their way to the renowned temples of the north-east, or the Sri Pada of the interior, will suffi- ciently account for this influx of population and wealth. Commerce, and not the indulgence of a spirit of conquest, can perhaps alone be legitimately assigned. Prior to the discovery of the compass, when mariners could not safely venture out of sight of land, they had no alternative in passing from the Malabar to the Coromandel coast, but to proceed by the strait between Ceylon and the Peninsula, or by rounding the island. To effect the latter, however, by keeping close to the island is im- practicable, except by waiting for the changes in the regular mon- soons. The south-west that blows from April to September, and is favourable to vessels proceeding from Cape Comorin to Manaar, CHAP. I.] MANTOTTE AS A COMMERCIAL EMPORIUM. 49(J renders it impracticable to proceed thence to Dondera Head. The north east that prevails from October to February, while facilitating the passage of these vessels from Manaar to Dondera Head, renders it necessary that they should there wait again for the south-west before they can proceed to Trincomalee or the Coromandel coast. Such being the case, it is clear that vessels would rendezvous in the straits of Manaar, or the Paumban channel, and that those vessels which from their size could not pass, would be unloaded, and the merchandize either be removed in boats, to be transhipped in other vessels, as they arrived from the opposite coast of India, or be de posited in stores to wait an opportunity of obtaining the necessary conveyance. These circumstances are sufficient in themselves to ac- count for a concourse of traders on the shores of these straits, and the adjacent districts, and the formation of numerous establishments at or near Manaar for their convenience. These establishments would call into existence, and give an impetus to, the cultivation of land in the vicinity which, in the absence of that extraordinary stimulant, might perhaps have lain for ever uncultivated. Many merchants from the Persian and Arabian Gulfs, and the Malabar coast, would prefer disposing of their goods at such a depot, and returning home with their ships laden with the produce of Coro- mandel and the Gangetic provinces, to continuing a tedious and hazardous voyage. The discovery of the compass and the im- provements in navigation, at once altered the system. Larger vessels were then substituted, which kept out to sea, the trading- through tbe straits of Manaar soon became less profitable, and more tedious than by a direct voyage, and was therefore abandoned ; hence followed the decay of the establishments at Manaar and Mantotte, and the consequent depopulation of the country. \"When these mercantile establishments were thus on the wane, and began to be reduced in strength and population, it is very possible that the Singhalese princes, feeling their superiority, attacked the remnant and reduced the Aareya Chakkra Warti from a state of independence to a recognition of their supremacy. The vicinity of the pearl fishery to these districts may also have added to the inducements of trading nations to make them the seat of exchange, though it would not in itself be a sufficient inducement to tempt them to establish a permanent residence in so arid a country, while Tutacorin was the recognised seat of the fishery. The whole district of Mantotte1 (Mahatottam, \"Great Garden\") is surrounded with a halo of interest for the antiquary, and it is far from improbable that the measures that cannot fail to be taken, sooner or later, to restore its former fertility to this neglected but very capable district, may evoke some relic of the past to elucidate what is now shrouded in mystery. Mantotte is bounded on the east 1 Matotte, or Mantotte, has been sometimes confounded with Mahawettatotte, it the mouth of the Kotti-aaiv 2 K 2 500 CEYLON. [PART IV. by the Wanny, on the north by the channel which divides Manaar from the main land, and on the south by Nanaatan. The face of the country is almost level, but from the ruined state of the tanks, the whole district does not produce more than 30,000 parrahs of paddy, although its facilities for irrigation are very great. The inhabitants are chiefly composed of Malabars, and live in 147 villages. The repair of the tanks, exclusive of Kattoekare, wovdd not exceed £5 50. and the tithe to Government would be 5000 parrahs of paddy. Salt pans are found in some parts of this coast, and formerly yielded a large supply. The island of Manaar (Mannarama1), so called from the Tamil words, man, sand, and aar, river, is separated from the coast of Ceylon by a narrow arm of the sea, varying in breadth from two to three miles at high water, but at ebb tide it appears to be little more than a rivulet, and is then fordable. It lies between 8° 56' and 9° 0' 50\" north lat., and 79° 50' and 80° 8' east long., is eighteen miles long, and from two to four broad, is the point of Ceylon nearest to the Indian peninsula, its north-western extremity being thirty miles from Ramisseram, and contains twenty-two villages. Nearly the whole of the island is low ground, exhibiting a mixture of shells and sand worked up by the waves ; the soil is scarcely anywhere adapted for the operations of agriculture, and the water is generally impregnated with salt, It is chiefly planted with cocoa-nut and palmyra trees, besides a small variety of shrubs and vegetables, among which cotton predominates. The climate differs little from that of the neigh- bouring coast, and the inhabitants enjoy good health throughout the year, except at the first setting in of the monsoon rains, when they are subject to a malignant fever and ague, which often prove fatal. Salt forms spontaneously on the island, but not in the same pro- portion as in the Leways. In the most wild and uncultivated parts of the sandy tracts, the best Chaya root is produced, the collection of which forms the exclusive occupation of a particular class of people callec^Kadeyas. The chanks found a little to the northward of Manaar are plentiful, but devoid of that brilliant whiteness for which those of Calpentyn are held in estimation. Both the channel and the gulf are well stocked with fish, which are caught in the greatest abundance, and it is mentioned in the Histoire de la Compagnie de Jesus, that in 1560 seven mermaids were caught in the neighbourhood of Manaar by the fishermen, and were dissected by the physician to the Viceroy of Goa. Manaar is famous for its large breed of black cattle and goats ; from the milk of the latter the people manufacture a coarse kind of cream cheese, small and round, the art of which was probably com- municated to them by the Dutch. Sheep thrive here better than in any other part of Ceylon, except, perhaps, in the extensive sheep walks between Jaffnapatam and Point Pedro. Butcher's meat, poultry, 1 The etymology I would venture to propose is Raman-aar, or Rama's river, in which cat>e the excision of the first syllable is supposed to have taken place. CHAP. I.] THE ISLAND AND TOWN OF MANAAR. 501 game, fruit, rice, and vegetables, are procurable at a low rate. Paddy is sown in the Manaar district in September and October, and reaped in March ; Kurukkan is sown in September, and reaped in December ; Gingilie is sown in March and reaped in May. The town of Manaar is situated at the south-eastern extremity of the island, and is about 142 miles N.N.W. of Colombo. It has a small square fort, surrounded by a wide ditcb, which stands so close to the channel, that it may be seen from the opposite shore of Ceylon. This fort contains, besides the officers' quarters, magazines and barracks, a small Protestant church, and two reservoirs of water. During war it is a dependency of Jaffna, and was, at one time, com- manded by a field officer, but at present is tenanted by invalids, and is used as a depot for salt. In the time of the Dutch, a strong garrison was kept. At the distance of a furlong from the fort through an avenue of Suria trees, stands the town, which is small but neat, con- taining several good houses, a court house, a large, commodious, and well supplied bazaar, several chapels belonging to the Roman Catholics, and a church attached to the Reformed faith of Holland. Besides the principal streets occupied by the burghers, there are a great number of smaller ones, in which the natives reside, and which extend into the country. Manaar has a small custom-house establish- ment ; its exports, which are chiefly confined to the Coromandel coast, consist of chanks, chaya root, palmyra rafters, areka nuts, gingilie, ironwood timber, and salt fish ; and its imports of cloth, rice, paddy, spices, and drugs. The harbour, though shallow, is completely sheltered. The village of Pesale, or Pcixale, composed of the two Tamil words pe, devil, and sale, a hall, so called from its having once been the resort of sorcerers, is one of the most considerable in the island. It is about twelve miles to the north-west of Manaar, on a sandy beach near the sea, and is considered a good situation for the fishery. The inhabitants who are chiefly Parawas, from the continent, exceed 1000 in number, and employ more than 200 canoes in their calling. When the Portuguese were in possession of the island they erected a very splendid church at some distance from the beach, but as it had crumbled into ruins, a new one has been erected in its neighbour- hood. Karsel is a village in the interior of the island, about eight miles north-west of Manaar. A government cotton plantation was once formed here ; but, the first produce proving insufficient to pay the expense, it was abandoned. This village is remarkable for the number of its gardens, and the excellence of its water. St. Pedro, about five miles north-west of Manaar, was so named by the Portuguese, from the church dedicated to St. Peter. It has a fine harbour, and was formerly the depot for the chanks fished along the coast, previous to their exportation to Bengal. About a mile west of the Tillage stands a round tower, by some thought to have been erected by the early Mahommedan settlers, by others to have been built by the Portuguese as a watch-tower, for noticing the approach of vessels. 502 CEYLON. [PART IV, Totawelle (the garden plain) is about three miles to the west of Manaar, and is inhabited by Kadeyas, who dig for chaya root, which is exported to Madura and other parts of the Coromandel coast. The Portuguese built a fine church here, but it has long since fallen to ruins, and a new one has been built by the inhabitants, who are all Roman Catholics. Talamanaar is a village at the south-west angle of the island, from which travellers are ferried over to the continent of India, and con- tains upwards of 300 inhabitants, principally fishermen. The wind to which this part of the island is very much exposed is continually throwing up huge mounds of sand. According to the traditions of the natives, Manaar was in early times the hereditary property of the Kadeyas, and exclusively occu- pied by them, but subject to the King of Jaffna. In the eighth century the Mahommedan1 emigrants from Arabia formed a consider- able settlement on the island, and from its position between Ceylon and the peninsula of India, chose it as the emporium of their com- merce, and guarded the two passages in the neighbourhood with an armed force. But at the time of the arrival of the Portuguese this establishment was already on the wane, and shortly afterwards ceased to exist. In 1503 the Kadeyas to a man embraced the Roman Catholic religion, with what results we have elsewhere shewn. In 1590 the island was taken possession of by the Portuguese, and, notwithstanding the attempts made by the King of. Jaffna to retake it, they retained it till 1650, when it was taken by the Dutch after a short resistance. During the government of the Portuguese it was their head quarters in the northern provinces, and a Captain-General permanently resided there. It- was here also they detained the empress Donna Catharina, whom they employed as a tool for the furtherance of their intei'ests in Ceylon. Nowhere were their attempts to propagate their faith more active than here, and the success which attended their labour is to this day evident, by the fact that there are few persons of any other sect or religion at Manaar, and none in the adjacent district of Mantotte. The Dutch soon rendered themselves unpopular with the inhabi- tants by their endeavours to supplant the Romish religion, and, though they subsequently became more tolerant, yet they never gained the affections of the people ; and when they contemplated levying a tax on the fish caught by the Parawas, who are the princi- pal inhabitants, some opposition was made, and numbers emigrated to the opposite coast, placing themselves under the protection of the Raja of Ramnad, and did not return to the island till the Dutch had given a solemn assurance of the abandonment of the tax. Manaar was taken by the British in 1795. 1 The Mahommedan merchants are said to have had immense depots here, both of the productions of Ceylon for the export trade, and the manufactures and productions of the Mahommedan states settled along the Mediterranean and the Persian Gulf. CHAP . I.] CONNEXION BETWEEN RAMISSERAM AND THE MAIN. 503 The navigation for large vessels near the shore between Manaar and Karetivoe is rather dangerous, as there are many banks inter- spersed, but small ones drawing seven or eight feet of water only, and acquainted with the coast, pass inside or between some of them. Ships making for Manaar, when three or three and a half leagues west of Karetivoe, steer to the north-east, keeping a good look out, and the lead going, the soundings being irregular over a rocky bottom, until seven or eight fathoms near the island, under these depths they decrease gradually towards it to five fathoms sandy ground. In this track there are sometimes overfalls from twenty to twenty-five fathoms to two or three fathoms less at a cast. If a vessel shoal to eight fathoms hard ground in passing near the reef or outermost banks, she must instantly haul to the westward. From this part of Ceylon to the Tinevelly coast, soundings extend across the gult* to the southward of Adam's bridge, but the outer limit of the bank is not even yet known to Europeans, as the navigation of the gulf to the northward of Colombo is principally limited to coasters. The gut between Manaar and Mantotte has in some places ten or twelve feet at high water, in others not more than six, it is only therefore navigable for dhonies and small country boats, but the only anchorage is on the south side of the island in four or five fathoms, and four or five miles to the westward of the gut. This channel, moreover, does not appear capable of any material improvement, as there is a bar opposite to its south end. In entering upon an investigation, or rather speculation, as to the original state of Palk's Strait, and of the Paumban channel, and to what cause the latter is indebted for its existence, we must needs commence by assuming that most probable of theories, the original junction of Ramisseram with the main land. That done, we may account by a very clear analogy, bearing in mind the disruptions and convulsions of the earth's surface even in the temperate zone, for its separation at a sub- sequent period from the Peninsula. Fabulous and obscure as most of the traditions handed down respecting the deeds of Rama and his opponent may be, it does not seem impossible, if we consider how recklessly labour has been lavished in every age of Eastern despotism, but that Rama, having completed the Saitubaudha1 or causeway 1 Hindoo history evidently alludes to Adam's or Rama's bridge, in recounting the wars of Lanka, and attributes to Rama, the son of Cush, an incarnate deity of the first rank in Hindoo mythology, the conquest of the island with an army of Indian satyrs ; and states that Rama's General, the prince of satyrs, called Hanuman, from his high cheek bones, and son of Pavon, the Indian god of storms and winds, and one of the eight Genii, soon raised with workmen of such agility a bridge of rocks over the sea, part of which, say the Hindoos, yet remains. Sir W. Jones in alluding to this, inquires if this army of satyrs might not have been only a race of mountaineers whom Rama had civilized, and concludes with mentioning, that the large breed of Indian apes was even in his time held in high veneration by the Hindoos, and fed with devotion by the Brahmins, who seem in two or three places on the banks of the Ganges to have a regular endowment for 504 CEYLON, [PART IV. through the then existing straits, (which we are told have been much deeper in ancient times) may have marched his army across it from the continent to the invasion of Ceylon, and hence have given this name of Rama's bridge. The accomplishment of a similar undertaking is represented by the native annalists to have been effected by Gajabahoo, a.d. 113. The Paumban passage, or as it is called by the inhabitants, the Paumban river, is a narrow opening through a dam or ridge of rocks, extending from the island of Ramisseram to the opposite promontory, on the continent to the east of Ramnad, and is situate between the Gulf of Manaar and Palk's Strait. The continuation of the rocks or dam can be easily traced on the main land and island of Ramisseram preserving exactly the same direction, but rising on both sides several feet higher than the dam in its natural position, and in uniform layers, having a small inclination to the south. The ridges which form the dam, were very much broken and displaced, consisting of large flat masses of rocks, seldom more than two or three feet in thickness. Their shattered state, and the break or chasm which they form in the general height of the stratum of rock, would seem to indicate that the island of Ramisseram was at one time connected with the main land, and that it had been separated in the first instance by the sea during storms breaking over and bursting the chain of rocks which joined them, and afterwards by the water undermining and displacing the broken fragments. This supposition corresponds with the tradition of the inhabitants ; for the Brahmins of Ramisseram state that when Achoodapah Naig was Raja of Madura, a.d. 1484, the island was connected with the continent, and that the Saumy of Ramisseram was carried to the mainland thrice every year on particular festivals. During the reign of Achoodapah Naig, a small breach in the rock was caused by a •violent storm, but as there was no great depth of water in it, travellers still continued to cross on foot till the time of his successor, Vissoovana Naig, when the breach was much enlai'ged by a second storm. The Divan Ramapiah was ordered to fill up the breach that the pilgrims of the pagoda at Ramisseram might passwithout difficulty; this was accordingly done, and the repairs lasted about ten years, when a third hurricane reopened and greatly extended the breach. The rock of which the dam is composed, is a sand stone, varying their support : they live in tribes of three or four hundred, are wonderfully gentle, and appear to have some kind of order and subordination in their little sylvan polity.\" On the other hand, the Mahommedans assert with about equal reason, that the bridge of Islets bearing the name of the common father of mankind, was formed by angels to permit his passage to Hindostan, after having dropped upon the mountain Hamalell, when expelled from the celestial paradise ; and it has been also asserted, that the persecuted followers of Boodh or Buddha, when driven' from the continent by the Brahmins, sought a secure resting place for themselves and for the unmolested exercise of their religion, by passing over this causeway to Ceylon. CHAP. I.] DESCRIPTION OF ADAM'S BRIDGE. 505 considerably in quality and compactness, but every where soft, and easily pierced and broken. The dam was 2,250 yards in length, and bounded by two parallel ridges of rock about 140 yards apart. From what has been said, it will be inferred that the Paumban channels have gradually been becoming deeper by the action of the waves and currents upon the ledges of rock which impede the passage, and that if there ever was any channel through which large ships could pass, between Ceylon and the continent, it must have been during some temporary shifting of the sand banks between Manaar and Ramisseram, The account given by Baldseus of the shifting of the impediments at one of the channels at Adam's bridge by the Portuguese, as if they were the lock-gates of a canal, in order to allow their fleet, menaced by the Dutch, to escape from this outlet, is hardly worthy of consi- deration, and difficult of belief ; for in that case either some of the channels must have been deeper in former days, or the ships must have been of a small size. Adam's bridge* itself is a very extraor- dinary formation. It is only about a quarter of a mile in breadth, and consists entirely of sand, partly above and partly below water, collected apparently by the surf and currents, and unsupported, as far as has yet been ascertained, by rock. The east end was pierced to the depth of thirty feet ; and nothing found but sand; on each side of the bank at the distance of from two to three miles, the sea is six fathoms deep, and quite free from obstructions of every kind. There are three principal openings across A.dam's bridge, one near the north-west end of Manaar, called the Talmanaar passage ; the second, eight miles further to the west, and the third about eleven miles from the island of Ramisseram, termed the Tannycoody passage, this last has been examined and surveyed. It is narrow in the centre, and thirty feet deep, with broad curved bars opposite to its two ends, on which there is not more than five or six feet of water. The bank between it and Ramisseram is entire, and several feet above water. The Talmanaar passage exactly resembles that of Tannycoody, but it is not so deep, there being only about three feet of water on its north bar. The intermediate opening has never been examined, but from its appearence, there is little doubt of its corresponding very nearly with the other two. In the vicinity of the Talmanaar and Tannycoody openings, the bank is visible above water for several miles, intersected by only a few narrow openings, but towards its centre it is chiefly covered with water, and very little sand is to be seen, though from the surf breaking exactly on the line of the bank, the depth of water cannot exceed two or three feet. 1 Adam's bridge is called by the natives \" Tiroowanai,\" or the sacred embank- ment, and \" Seetapandanam,\" or the structure of Seeta. Valmika, in his Uttara kanda, cap. xviii, describes the bridge as being ten yojens in breadth, and one hundred in length, and composed of no other materials than huge rocks piled up in a chain by the Vdnaras, under the direction of Nala, one of the chief engineers of the gods. 506 CEYLON. [PART IV. During both monsoons, on the lee side of the bank, there are a great number of irregular shifting sand banks scattered about, on which there are from two to four feet of water, with passages between them eight or nine feet deep. The weather side on the contrary, particu- larly towards the end of the monsoon, is in great measure clear of such banks, and the surf breaks on its shore nearly in a straight con- tinued line. When the monsoon changes, the strength and prevailing direction of the current change too, and the loose sand of which the shifting banks are composed, on what was the lee side, being stirred up by the surf and sea, is swept by the current through the channels, and deposited on the opposite side, partly on the bars and partly in loose detached heaps along the bank. These deposits appear to be further increased by the sand thrown upon the weather shore by the surf, which, as soon as it becomes dry, is carried by the wind across the bank into the sea on the other side. When the wind is strong, a continued stream of sand is swept across the bank into the sea on the lee side. The beach of Adam's bridge, therefore, to the distance of about a mile on both sides, is continually changing and shifting ; on the weather side it is generally clear, except immediately opposite to the channels where there are always projecting bars, while on the opposite side there are many loose banks scattered about, and con- stantly changing and varying in position and extent as the monsoon advances, and according to the state of the sea and weather. During both monsoons rather a high surf breaks on the weather side of the bank, but the south-west monsoon produces much the highest surf, accompanied by a long heavy swell. During part of the north-east monsoon the surf breaks on both sides of the banks. Dhonies and fishing boats occasionally used to pass through the openings in fine weather, but the passage was attended with difficulty and danger, and was not common. The practicability of opening a channel sufficiently deep for all classes of ships, and keeping it open, was found to be doubtful. A strong double bulwark of stones across the bank, extending into deep water on both sides, with a narrow opening of 100 or 200 feet might perhaps have accomplished the object. The velocity of the current would probably keep a narrow fixed channel of that descrip- tion always sufficiently deep, and sweep off any sand that might be carried into it, either by the sea or by the wind ; and, as the bulwark would extend into deep water beyond the shifting sands and the in- fluence of the surf, its ends might possibly be kept free from sand. The danger to be chiefly apprehended was the formation of bars opposite to the ends of the channel, similar to what were found in front of the natural openings, but as the current is rapid and extends into deep water it is likely that what did pass through it wTould be dissipated and disappear. In 1836, the Government of Madras made an application to that of Bombay, for a surveying party to examine the gulf of Manaar. The idea of this undertaking originated with General Monteith, CHAP. 1.] FORMATION OF A NAVIGABLE CHANNEL. 507 Chief of the Madras Engineers, who had been wrecked on the shores of the gulf in 1809, and had felt the strongest possible desire to see its coasts and shoals, and sunken rocks, examined and laid down, with a view as far as possible, to diminish the obstructions to navi- gation. A party was therefore detached from Captain Moresby to undertake this service, and a party of Madras engineers, and about fifty convicts were engaged under the direction of General, then Colonel Monteith, in cutting a navigable channel through two formid- able ledges of rock, extending from the island of Ramisseram to the opposite coast of the continent. The passage through these rocks, while they remained in their natural state, had a depth of at most six or seven feet, while on the Great Horse Shoe-bank, a little to the south, there was scarcely a depth of five feet at high- water. In despite of these obstacles, however large numbers of small craft engaged in the coasting trade, had long made use of the channel, though they had been always compelled to land a portion of their cargoes on entering the strait. The principal object of the Madras Government was now therefore, to widen, and deepen the passage, so as to obtain a sufficient depth of water for vessels of moderate burden, and for the steamers from the Red Sea to Calcutta when established. As it has been already observed, up to 1837, all vessels beyond the smallest class were compelled in pass- ing from one side of the Indian peninsula to the other, to beat round Ceylon, often in the teeth of heavy and contrary winds, and always against currents more or less powerful. The addition thus made to their voyage, averaged under the most favourable circum- stances, 2000 miles, but as it was often necessary to run down ten degrees of latitude, before they could open the Bay of Bengal, they had to sail full 3500 miles, ere they regained the directer course. The craft exposed to this inconvenience and loss of time, were em- ployed in the conveyance of the produce of Malabar, Travancore, and other fertile provinces, to Madras. Prices, as it will easily be conceived, were very materially enhanced by such a state of things on the Coromandel coast. Fewer persons would engage in the trade on account of the dangers to be apprehended in rounding Ceylon ; while the mere length of the voyage by increasing the wages of crews, and the interest of capital, necessarily raised the cost of com- modities. Its chief effect, however, was to confine the coasting trade to small vessels, which by the slow process of unloading and reloading, could reach their point of destination through the gulf of Manaar and the Paumban passage. Where Nature has in a sportive or capricious mood, barred or endangered the progress of man, it is to be observed, she has ever summoned forth increased energy and resolution in her children for the encounter. Hence on the little island of Ramisseram, is to be found a hardy race of native pilots ; and the village of Paumban owes its existence to the intricacy and shallowness of the neighbouring channel. Circumstances might occur which would render the impracticability of this route a public 508 CEYLON. [PAET IV. calamity. Thus during the war in Affghanistan ' the Enterprise,' a well built and powerful steamer, bound with treasure and arms for Kurrachee, was completely beaten back and detained for weeks by the force of the south-west monsoon, while numbers of coasting ves- sels were passing and repassing daily through the Paumban channel, completely under the shelter of land. The attention of Government had been directed to this subject as far back as 1828, when some efforts were made towards removing the principal obstacles to the navigation, but were discontinued for reasons not known. The geological structure of the strait is curious. An immense congeries of rocks, many of them rising to the surface of the waves, obstructed the channel for 2960 feet, and between these at high water, the small and venturous craft of the country threaded their tortuous and somewhat dangerous course. The northern extremity consists of coral and limestone to which succeeds shingle, mixed with granite boulders, but not loose. This passed, a breadth of blue soft sandstone mixed with lime and madrepore succeeds. Then follows the great northern reef composed of hard red sandstone, and extend- ing east and west almost in a right line. A broad belt of broken sandstone interspersed with boulders of other substances next suc- ceeds, and the southern reef, consisting like the former, with which it runs parallel, of hard red sandstone, follows. A bed of the same rock, but less indurated, then stretches southwards to the site of the great sand-bank. As may be supposed \" the practical men\" as usual pronounced this undertaking ridiculous, and viewed the obstacles to its comple- tion insurmountable, while the Court of Directors, ever slow in advancing any thing to promote objects beyond their own narrow range of vision, had little faith in the success of the enterprise, and were indisposed to expend a competent sum for its execution. Un- daunted by the apathy that prevailed, Colonel Monteith, perfectly confident that if the requisite means were placed at his disposal, he could cut through the interposing reefs a channel of fourteen feet at low, and sixteen at high -water, and at the same time of sufficient breadth to allow of its being safely navigated at all seasons, perse- vered, and finally succeeded in obtaining his authority. He located his gang of convicts at Ramisseram, where he likewise erected bar- racks for the troops. A large diving bell five tons in weight was sent him from Ceylon : he purchased or constructed a number of catamarans, and with the least possible delay, commenced operations. Great energy and perseverance were exhibited by all parties, the sappers and convicts working almost continually in the water, diving, boring and blasting. The most laborious work was removing the huge fragments of rock when they had been detached. This was effected by raising and swinging them to the sides of the catamarans or large boats, by which they were carried away, and dropped into the sea with the view of forming a sort of breakwater on either side of the channel. At one time the explosion under water took place CHAP. I.] SUCCESS OF THE ENTERPRISE— WEKTLETEEVOE. 509 before the men could get out of the way, and on one occasion a large catamaran was overturned with six persons in it. Another time, when the fuse had been twenty minutes without exploding, a diver was sent to withdraw the powder, but found the fire burning fiercely, and had scarcely effected his escape, before immense fragments of rock were projected above water, and .scattered with tremendous force on all sides. During the whole period in which operations were carried on, how- ever, few casualties occurred, while owing to the excellent system of management pursued by General Monteith and his humanity to those under his care, the deaths from sickness did not exceed those occurring in any ordinary service. At length a powerful steam- dredge was sent out from England, which cleared away the loose rock at the rate of about 2000 cubic feet per day. Nevertheless the channel has not yet been excavated to the depth required, having only ten feet at low, and twelve feet at high water, with a breadth varying from 90 to 150 yards. Its edges are carefully marked throughout by buoys. It may with truth, however, be said, that the undertaking has succeeded, since not only do all the country craft use the channel, but the Calcutta steamers also.. The \"Ne- mesis\" and the \" Pluto\" on their return from China came this way, and in coal alone effected a saving of ^6400. But the most striking illustration of the value of the Paumban channel is supplied by the fact, that whereas before the works were undertaken, the amount of tonnage that traversed the strait was from 20,000 to 23,000 tons a year, it has now increased to 140,000 in the same period, or six-fold. The passage from Mantotte to Jaffnapatam is effected with most ease by sea, the distance by that mode of transit not exceeding sixty- eight miles, but the botanist conscious of the treasures that await him by the more circuitous route, will prefer it, as a number of plants are to be found by the land route that are not to be met with elsewhere in the island. The road is sandy, often inundated to a great depth in the rainy season, and skirted by jungle, though the districts contiguous to the villages are well cultivated, and abun- dantly stocked with cattle. The native cottages are remarkable for their neatness, and their freedom from musquitoes, which arises from the plaster of cow-dung laid on the cottage floors, which when levelled makes an excellent pavement, cool, comfortable, and from its anti-contagious influences, salutary to the inmates. Vertativoe (Wertleteevoe) the first stage on this route, and nine miles from Mantotte, is the principal village in the district of the same name, which is included within the territory of the Wanny, and comprises 104 villages ; the repair of tbe tanks would cost i£500. and the tithe to Government would be 4500 parrahs of paddy. Its inhabitants, who are Moors, carry on a considerable manufacture of salt. Here is a post station and rest-house for travellers, and a road leads from hence through the Wannv to Trincomalee. Near 510 • CEYLON. [PART IV. the first rest-house on this road is a small temple of most excellent construction. The building is a long square, about twenty-two feet in length and fifteen in width, and the stones are in perfect preserva- tion. The cornice is cut with great taste, after the Hindoo style, and the ornaments are not unlike those seen in some ruins of a temple on Malabar point af Bombay. The next stage, northward, is lllipekadawe, 5f miles, the prin- cipal village in the district of the same name, (where there is a rest- house), which is also within the limits of the Wanny. Besides paddy, a very small proportion of fine grain is cultivated in this part of the country, as it is overgrown with jungle, and infested with elephants. Near lllipekadawe is a large species of tamarind, Papara-pulli, Singh, under which Baldseus is said to have first preached the Gospel in Ceylon This tree is more than eighty feet high, and thirty in girth. lllipekadawe has forty-five tanks, of which twenty require repair, and would cost .=6450. ; and if all the fields in this district were sown, the tithe would yield 1500 parrahs of paddy. Tobacco thrives well here. From hence the next stage is to Pali-aar, six miles, aud from thence to Pallawarajenkattoe, 8f miles, the principal village in the district of that name, which has a large tank, that affords means of cultivating a large number of paddy fields. The rest-house stands about a mile and a half from the sea. There are six tanks requiring repair in this district, and the tank before alluded to requires a canal to drain off its superfluous water, the whole cost would be ^6320-, and the tithe, including that received from the fields not watered from the tanks, would yield 3000 parrahs of paddy. Off this coast is Irrentivoe (the Two Brothers' island) about five miles N.W. from Pallawarajenkattoe. They are inhabited, and abound with good pasturage, in which a part of the Delft stud was formerly sent to graze. Fish is plentiful. There is a small Roman Catholic chapel on one of the islands. The next stage is to Vewaltcengie, six miles and a half; from thence to Sembencoondu is five and a half miles, and from the latter to Poonaryn, a village in the parish of the same name aud attached to the district of Pachellepalle, is five miles. Here is a small fort built by the Dutch, and a rest-house for travellers, both very plea- santly situated. It is the seat of a dense population, with extensive plots of paddy land diversified with plantations of cocoa-nut and palmyra trees. Though fiat and sandy near the coast, this district contains some beautiful scenery, and is remarkable for its verdure and good cultivation. Its forest trees are of the most magnificent and picturesque variety, and the beautiful scenery of the tropics, can no where be seen to greater advantage, or less adorned by art. North-west of Poonaryn stretches the long neck of land along which the road runs, terminating at Kalmoone point, and forming one of the entrances into the little inland sea of Jaffna. It is often inundated CHAP. I.] ILLIPEKADAWi, PALLAWAPAIENKATTOE, POONARYN. 51 1 by the sea. There is a small fort at this place, which commands the gut. Kalmoone point is 13| miles from Poonaryn, and from thence across the channel to Jaffnapatam via Colombotorre, is 6^ miles The Peninsula of Jaffna1 (Yapana) is situated on a neck of land at the northern extremity of Ceylon, and directly opposite to Nega- patam in the southern Carnatic. Its bounds have been implied in our description of the Northern Province, of which it forms a large and b}r far the most populous component, several of its most populous parishes or sub-divisions shewing an average of nearly 1000 the square mile, and the whole population can fall little if at all short of 200,000 souls. Its whole length is about thirty-five miles from north-west to south-east, and its breadth from eight to twenty-five miles from N.E. to S.W. comprehending an area of 1 220 square miles. It is divided into four districts, exclusive of the islands, viz. Wada- marachie, Temnarachie, Pachellepalle and Walligamme, which con- tain thirty-two parishes or sub-divisions, and more than 160 villages. From its maritime situation, Jaffna escapes the intensely hot winds, which prevail on the continent, and the climate is therefore on the whole healthy and less inimical to European constitutions. At Jaffnapatam the mean daily variation of the temperature is 5°. and the annual range from 70° to 90o. The soil is generally sandy and calcareous, resting upon madrepore ; but when manured, it yields abun- dant crops, and altogether its careful cultivation entitles it to the appellation of the \" Ulster\" of Ceylon. Paddy is sown in August and September, and reaped in January and February, and though the province is not intersected by any rivers or watercourses for irrigation, yet such is the retentive nature of the soil, that\" the crops seldom fail except in the event of a protracted drought, and want is almost unknown. Of the fine grains, warrego, saamy, kurukkan, tinisaamy and panisaamy are alone cultivated. Tobacco of a very superior quality is raised in large but not sufficient quantities, par- ticularly in the district of Pachellepalle, and is transported to the markets of Colombo, Galle, and Kandy. The cultivation has been seriously checked from time to time by a mortality among the cattle, whose manure is absolutely required for the success of the crop : un- der due encouragement it is capable of largely adding to the wealth of the country. Cotton of a fine quality is also produced in the penin- sula. Jaffna contained till lately very few cocoa-nut plantations, but 1 The Palsesimundi oppidum of the ancients is thought by some to have been situate in the Jaffna peninsula, but its precise situation remains to be determined. It is described by the Rachia as being the principal city, and having a capacious harbour, which would almost induce one to look for it on the north-west coast of Ceylon. The theory of Forbes, who traces its etymology to the Singhalese words, Palacia, lower, and Mandhala, province (in which case it might be freely rendered ' low lands') ; in allusion to the general division of the Kandian districts, into Udacia and Palacia,' upper and lower,' is very ingenious and even suggestive, but can it legitimately be made to extend to a Malabar province ? 512 CEYLON. [PART IV. this deficiency was supplied by the abundance of the palmyra-palm, the fruit and roots of which form a material portion of the diet of the inhabitants, while the leaves serve as thatch for houses, as a sub- stitute for paper, and for making mats, baskets, winnows, and fans, and the timber is largely used in building. Cocoa-nut trees are now being extensively planted in this province, where they flourish ex- tremely well. Areka nuts are produced in different parts of the province, but not to a degree in proportion to the consumption of the inhabitants. Jack fruits, mangoes, oranges, pine-apples, pome- granates, guavas, jambos, bananas, anonas (custard apples), and a variety of other fruits are found in the villages, and grapes are raised in the town and the various mission stations. Pulse of several sorts, sweet potatoes, yams, and other indigenous vegetables abound, all of which are daily brought to the bazaars and exposed for sale. Chaya roots and indigo grow wild in the several districts, but the first has alone attracted notice as an article of trade. Jaffna is well supplied with fish, and chanks are found on the sea- coast, as well as embedded under ground in different parts. Black cattle and sheep are found in great numbers, and there are large herds of goats. The principal manufactures are those of cloth and jaggery. The descendants of a colony of Senyas who emigrated from the opposite coast and settled there during the time of the Dutch, ' who from fiscal motives encouraged the manufacture, are chiefly engaged in making cloth, which they have brought to such a state of perfection that some of their camboys and sarons rival those of Pulicat in texture and colour. Besides these, are potteries, and some villages of braziers and gold and silversmiths. Oil is manu- factured at Jaffna from the kernels of the cocoa, punnay and other nuts, the apparatus for expressing which is very rude, consisting of a large wooden mortar and lever, which is turned by two bullocks, but now that European capital has begun to find its way into the peninsula, a more effective mode will doubtless be applied. The export trade of Jaffna to ports beyond Ceylon, consists of tobacco, palmyra timber, jaggery, chillies, onions, winnows, brass, pots, &c, and the imports are cloths, cotton thread, iron, paddjr, rice, curry seeds, medical drugs and earthenware. The inhabitants are with few exceptions Tamulians, and are in general industrious, active, and enterprising ; but are by no means remarkable for their freedom from licentiousness and crime, and the peninsula has acquired a notoriety for its murders, highway robberies, ear cutting, and other atrocious offences. In former times, this part of Ceylon was particularly famed as the seat of Tamul literature, but latterly learning has sadly declined even among the Brahmins. The greater portion of the inhabitants were once Roman Catholics, but afterwards conformed to the Protestant faith, under the Dutch they had a church and school in each parish, but since the downfall of that power, they have relapsed into CHAP. I.] EARLY SETTLEMENT OP JAFFNA. 513 Hindooism, and adhere to all the superstitious characteristics of the Siva creed, for the celebration of whose mysteries there are more than 300 temples. Little positive information of the ancient history of this interesting portion of Ceylon exists, all that can be collected from the traditions of the natives is that in ages past it was a complete desert, but that it fell into the hands of a blind adventurer from the Coromandel coast named Vira Raghava (who was a yalpanen, or lyrist by pro- fession), as a gift from an ancient king of Ceylon on account of his wonderful power on the lyre, and that he had it cleared of jungle, when it was subsequently colonised from the southern provinces of India, which were then independent of the Telinga empire of Vijaianagger. After the province became peopled, its founder called it after his name, Yalpana Nadoo, the country of the lyrist (which has since been corrupted into Yapana or Jaffna), and some time afterwards formed it into a kingdom. Sensible, however, of his own ineligibility, he went to Coromandel, and brought over a prince of the race of Solen, whom he crowned king in the year 3000 of Kali yug. (101. B.C.) and to him he transferred his right to the soil. This king was unfortunately crippled in one of his arms, hence he was styled Visaya Koolaugai Chakkrawarti, but he was nevertheless distinguished for the attention he paid to the improve- ment of the country. His descendants reigned in .the peninsula under the title of Ariya Chakkrawarties, and carried on frequent hostilities with the Singhalese. In 1410 a.d., however, the Chakkrawarti is said to have been overthrown1 and deposed by Prackramabahoo, who once more reduced the kingdom of Jaffna under the Singhalese yoke, and raised one of 1 The remarkable political feature that can hardly fail to arrest the attention of the intelligent reader in connection with Singhalese history, is the absence of attractive power in the policy and operations of the Supreme Government, This observation is indeed applicable in some degree to all Eastern governments, but its truth is nowhere more manifest than in Ceylon. Whether it is to be ascribed to the indolence of the monarch, in whose mind his own individual pleasure was the sole governing motive of life, or whether to the conventionalities of court eticpiette from which a deviation was almost unknown, the effect was one and the same ; and except that the Emperor might chance to have \" a more splendid trough and wider sty\" than the nominally subordinate, but practically independent chiefs, one would be almost justified in inquiring in what consisted the proofs of imperial power. Jt might have been expected, that when the capital of Ceylon lay in the centre of its northern half, a monarch, if not ambitious enough to aim at the un- divided dominion of an island, barely large enough to place it in the rank of a second rate power, would have been led to assert his supremacy over a portion of territory almost within sight of the seat of his rule ; yet the absence of any mention of a continuous authority, and the fact that the Malabar invader when expelled from the Singhalese territories, found here an undisturbed resting place, will shew that such a conclusion cannot rightly be inferred. It will perhaps occur to some readers, that this indifference on the part of the Singhalese monarchs, may have arisen from other than political causes, such as the isolated position of the peninsula ; and the circumstance that all communication with the continent was held either through Manaar or Kotti-aar. 2 L 514 CEYLON. [PART IV. his own nephews to the throne. His dynasty would nevertheless appear to have been but of short duration, for we fiud that when the Portuguese arrived on the island, Jaffna was governed by its native sovereign, with whom they carried on a desultory war for several years, till he was finally vanquished in 1591, and the whole peninsula acknowledged their supremacy. Jaffna was taken possession of by the Dutch in 1600, and capitulated to the British in 1795. Jaffnapatam (Yapana patnam), the chief town of the peninsula, is situated in 9° AT N. lat. and 80° 9' E. long, is 296 miles south-west of Madras, and 215 north of Colombo. It possesses a large fort, built in the form of a pentagon, with five bastions, surrounded by a broad moat and extensive glacis ; within its walls is a church in the form of a Greek cross, built by the Dutch, and now used by the English (service being performed by a Church Missionary), the house of the Commandant, soldiers' barracks, and some other good buildings. In the time of the Dutch it was the residence of a \" Commander,\" who was the second officer of rank in the service of the East India Company in Ceylon. Under him was a Dissave appointed in 1661, who was expected to spend six months of the year in the Wanny. The government house is now used as a police court. At the distance of half a mile to the eastward stands the Pettah, which contains several broad parallel streets, intersected by . smaller ones,. and is in great measure free from the noxious exhala- tions for which similar localities are elsewhere notorious. Verandahs are attached to most of the houses. The houses are mostly built of brick, with delightful gardens abounding with the choicest native and exotic fruits, and some of them are shaded in front by trees. During the time of the Dutch, the majority of the inhabitants of the Pettah consisted of that people ; but, since the British conquest, many have emigrated to Batavia, or settled in other parts of the island. There still remains a very respectable body of the descen- dants of both Dutch and Portuguese, and many of the former have withiu late years been induced to settle here in consequence of the cheapness and abundance of the necessaries of life. The principal constituents of the population are Moormen or Hindoos, and the coasting trade, consisting of the import of cotton manufactures, is carried on through the intervention of Chitties, who are the bill discounters and money changers of Ceylon. The Cutcherry is in the Pettah. The bazaar at Jaffnapatam is abundantly supplied with the necessaries of life at a cheap rate, and always wears a busy ap- pearance. The Roman Catholics have their chapels, and the Church of St. John belongs to the Tamul Protestants, in which the Tamul Colonial Chaplain officiates. At Wannapanne, a village in the vicinity, the Hindoos have a large temple, called Kanda Swamy, which far exceeds all the rest in the province, both in grandeur and magnifi- cence. It was endowed by Wyti Linga Chetty upwards of fifty years ago, and has a band of dancing girls attached to it. It is CHAP.

Among the institutions of Jaffna, the Friend in Need Society, established in 1841, is one of the most useful. Jaffnapatam is not accessible to vessels of any considerable size, owing to the shallowness of the water, but they unload their cargo at Kayts, and they are conveyed from thence to the town in small boats. Jaffnapatam is the seat of the Government agent for the northern province, the district judge, fiscal, and police magistrate, all of which offices are, with one exception, filled by gentlemen of the civil service. The principal parishes of the peninsula are, Wannapane, Kopaay, Poottoor, Atchuwelle, M^ajlitte, Tellipalle, Pandaterripoe, Mallagam, Oodooville, Sangane, Manipay, Batticotta, (Vattukotte), Nellorc, all in the province of Walligamme. Wannapane has part of the town of Jaffnapatam within its limits. Its population exceeds 7000. Kopaay abounds with -paddy, fine grain, and in almost every sort of fruit trees. The population is about 5550, and there is an extensive pottery. Poottoor has been much improved of late by the new roads which radiate from it. There is a venerable old church at this place, built by the Dutch. The population is little short of 4000. Atchuwelle is extremely fertile, and on the whole well cultivated, while the woods abound with hares, deer and wild boars. The number of inhabitants is about 2400, and a portion of them lead a strolling life, and gain a livelihood by fortune telling. Majlitte formerly boasted of a splendid church and parsonage built by the Portuguese.
