The sources and references have been many and varied and although the utmost Lists are far from complete and may contain errors.\n\ncare was taken, the\n\nThe original Codes etc were designed principally for marine use as this was the field in which radio was initially developed. The majority retain this influence but many have been modified and modernised to cover land and air applications. Technical terms have also varied as technology has changed however most abbreviations of the computer age have been omitted. These are specialist terms of that mode, not often encountered in telegraphy. Their number is huge and varied and computer books list them. Specialised Codes etc are not listed, eg. Armed Services, Civil Aviation, Weather Bureau, Commercial codes etc as these run into many hundreds And are beyond our scope. There are exceptions of course, especially the Navy, where their codes etc formed part of the original listings. Obsolete and obscure codes etc are included for historical interest but are never likely to be encountered in use. The lists are far from complete and it is requested that anyone who has information that will fill gaps or has an obscure code that could be included please send it to me so the lists can he made more complete. Please quote the reference and date with a photocopy of the list. The Third Edition has extra material and additions to existing items, marked by an asterisk (*) in the Contents. This includes new codes from the “International Code of Signals” 1987 - 1995. I thank everyone who has already supplied information and, in anticipation, anyone who might assist in the future. I thank particularly the US Army and Navy Historical Branches, the ITU, Geneva, Mr. Brian Kelk of Cambridge, Engl., BT Archives, Royal Signals Museum, Blandford and many Internet sources and contributors for their assistance. There are many others, both via Internet and other means have supplied or sourced information which might never have otherwise been recorded.
