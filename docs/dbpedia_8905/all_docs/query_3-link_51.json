        "text": "The American Thyroid Association (ATA) is the world’s leading professional association of medical specialists dedicated to education and research to improve thyroid disease prevention, diagnosis and treatment; improving thyroid patient care; and educating the public about thyroid health and diseases.\n\nPrevalence and Impact of Thyroid Disease\n\nMore than 12 percent of the U.S. population will develop a thyroid condition during their lifetime.\n\nAn estimated 20 million Americans have some form of thyroid disease.\n\nUp to 60 percent of those with thyroid disease are unaware of their condition.\n\nWomen are five to eight times more likely than men to have thyroid problems.\n\nOne woman in eight will develop a thyroid disorder during her lifetime.\n\nMost thyroid cancers respond to treatment, although a small percentage can be very aggressive.\n\nThe causes of thyroid problems are largely unknown.\n\nUndiagnosed thyroid disease may put patients at risk for certain serious conditions, such as cardiovascular diseases, osteoporosis and infertility.\n\nPregnant women with undiagnosed or inadequately treated hypothyroidism have an increased risk of miscarriage, preterm delivery, and severe developmental problems in their children.\n\nMost thyroid diseases are life-long conditions that can be managed with medical attention.\n\nFacts about the Thyroid Gland and Thyroid Disease\n\nThe thyroid is a hormone-producing gland that regulates the body’s metabolism—the rate at which the body produces energy from nutrients and oxygen—and affects critical body functions, such as energy level and heart rate.\n\nThe thyroid gland is located in the middle of the lower neck.\n\nAlthough the thyroid gland is relatively small, it produces a hormone that influences every cell, tissue and organ in the body.\n\nHypothyroidism is a condition where the thyroid gland does not produce enough thyroid hormone. Symptoms include extreme fatigue, depression, forgetfulness, and some weight gain.\n\nHyperthyroidism, another form of thyroid disease, is a condition causing the gland to produce too much thyroid hormone. Symptoms include irritability, nervousness, muscle weakness, unexplained weight loss, sleep disturbances, vision problems and eye irritation.\n\nGraves’ disease is a type of hyperthyroidism; it is an autoimmune disorder that is genetic and estimated to affect one percent of the population.\n\nResearch Advancements in Thyroid Disease\n\nResearch funded by the American Thyroid Association over the past 40 years has accomplished:\n\nMandatory screening of newborns for congenital hypothyroidism, and early treatment that has prevented mental retardation.\n\nCost-effective methods to detect thyroid cancer by screening the 250,000 thyroid nodules developed in Americans each year.\n\nGroundbreaking work in brain development and thyroid hormone function.\n\nPromising Graves’ disease genetic research that may lead to improved prognosis and new preventive treatments.\n\nAn experimental drug that may prove useful for treatment and prevention of eye problems associated with Graves’ disease.\n\nAll media inquiries should be directed to:\n\nATA Media Information\n\nthyroid@thyroid.org\n\nIf you are interested in finding out more about the American Thyroid Association, please contact us at 703.998.8890, 2000 Duke Street, Suite 300, Alexandria, VA 22314."
