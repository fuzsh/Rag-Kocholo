This anniversary pressing compiles both sides of the album as well as their song \"Wolfpack\" onto a single-sided LP, with a screen-printed B-side. This 2nd pressing is limited to 1,000 copies available from Bridge Nine on translucent green vinyl (SHIPPING END OF MARCH/EARLY APRIL).Maximum Rock N Roll called this album a \"contagious masterpiece.\" A part of the original Boston Crew, alongside S.S. Decontrol and Negative FX, DYS and their Brotherhood album influenced generations of straight edge hardcore punk bands, the youth crew movement, and deserves a place in any true hardcore fanâs record collection.Earlier this year, DYS announced a series of 40th anniversary shows to acknowledge this milestone. Those were unfortunately canceled due to vocalist Dave Smalleyâs struggles with a serious medical issue. Those issues are unfortunately ongoing and have resulted in significant medical expenses. For that reason, proceeds from this special edition are being donated to Dave Smalley's medical fund.",
