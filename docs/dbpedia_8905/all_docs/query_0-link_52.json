        "text": "Early Voting\n\nYou do not need a reason to vote early! All voters may vote early, just like they are voting on election day. Voters who want to vote early for any election may do so in person at designated locations in the their parish from 14 to seven days prior to any scheduled election. When one or more state holidays fall within an early voting period, the first day for early voting will begin 15 days prior to the election.\n\nFor presidential elections, the early voting period is from 18 to seven days before the election (except Sundays and legal holidays). When one or more state holidays fall within that early voting period, the first day for early voting will begin 19 days prior to the election.\n\nRefer to the schedule below for early voting time periods for upcoming elections and refer to the schedule of elections for future time periods.\n\nFor a detailed list of early voting locations in your parish, login to the voter portal. For a complete list of early voting locations for the entire state, please refer to early voting locations.\n\nThe registrars of voters will open their offices from 8:30 a.m. to 6 p.m. for each day of early voting. When you go to cast your vote early, you will be asked to identify yourself with either a photo ID or signature on a voter affidavit. You may use a Louisiana driver’s license, a Louisiana special identification card, a United States military identification card that contains your name and picture or other generally recognized picture identification card that has your name and signature. You may wish to contact your local Registrar of Voters Office for specific locations, dates and times.\n\nSee La. R.S. 18:1303 for more information about voting early.\n\nNovember 5, 2024\n\nOpen Primary/Presidential/Congressional Election\n\nEarly voting is October 18 through October 29 (excluding Sunday, October 20 and Sunday, October 27) from 8:30 a.m. - 6 p.m.\n\nDecember 7, 2024\n\nCongressional General Election\n\nEarly voting is November 22 through November 30 (excluding Sunday, November 24 and Thursday, November 28) from 8:30 a.m. - 6 p.m.\n\nAssistance to Voters\n\nA visibly disabled voter and the person assisting them in voting shall go to the front of the line when voting early at the Registrar of Voters Office or at designated locations for early voting.\n\nA voter is entitled to receive assistance while voting if they are unable to read or unable to vote without assistance because of a physical disability, including being visually impaired. A voter may choose to use the audio ballot instead of receiving assistance.\n\nA voter must either file a statement with the registrar in person or by mail before the election if they need assistance in voting or complete an affidavit and/or provide specific disability documentation to the registrar or commissioner during early voting.\n\nAcceptable disability documentation includes letters from a medical doctor, optometrist, physician assistant or nurse practitioner certifying to the disability, or a copy of current documentation showing eligibility for disability benefits from either social security, veteran's, paratransit services, Office for Citizens with Developmental Disabilities or benefits from Louisiana Rehabilitation Services.\n\nPersons prohibited from assisting voters are as follows:\n\ncandidate in the election cannot assist a voter;\n\nemployer or employer's agent cannot assist an employee;\n\nunion agent cannot assist a union member; and\n\nstaff for a state residential facility cannot assist residents of their facility in voting.\n\nRequirements of a Person Assisting a Voter\n\nA voter who is entitled to assistance in voting may receive the assistance of any person of their choice including the registrar, a deputy registrar or an early voting commissioner, except those prohibited.\n\nBefore a voter receives assistance during early voting, the registrar, deputy registrar or early voting commissioner must print the voter's name and the assistant's name (including a registrar, a deputy registrar or an early voting commissioner providing assistance) behind the tab for assistance to voters in the back of the precinct register and check the box if the voter is not marked on the statewide voter registration system as eligible for assistance in voting. Then the assistant (including a registrar, a deputy registrar or an early voting commissioner providing assistance) must sign their name next to their printed name before being allowed to assist the voter.\n\nIn the event that a paper ballot must be used during early voting, the person assisting the voter to vote a paper ballot must explain to the voter that a signature or mark made by the voter constitutes certification that all statements in the certificate are true and correct and that any person who knowingly provides false or incorrect statements is subject to a fine or imprisonment, or both.\n\nThe person assisting the voter to vote a paper ballot must sign the acknowledgment on the paper ballot envelope flap, verifying that the person providing the assistance has marked the ballot in the manner dictated by the voter.\n\nIf a voter is assigned to a polling place that is not accessible, the voter may cast their vote at the nearest polling place with the same ballot, or at the Registrar of Voters Office.\n\nImageCast X Voting Systems for Early Voting\n\nFor early voting beginning in the fall of 2019, all Louisiana voters will use the ImageCast® X (or “ICX”) voting system leased from Dominion Voting Systems. Early voting is held 14 to seven days prior to any scheduled election at each Registrar of Voters Office or at designated locations in the parish.\n\nFor presidential elections, the early voting period is from 18 to seven days before the election (except Sundays and legal holidays).\n\nOn this small and easy to operate touchscreen system, the voter will scroll through their entire ballot to vote. The election results are easily printed and stored on a cartridge that is delivered to the Parish Board of Election Supervisors for tabulation on Election Day.\n\nThe ICX unit was designed as a voting solution for all and offers several options for voters with accessibility needs to vote in a private and independent manner. The ICX offers the following user interfaces:\n\nVisual mode: The voter navigates their ballot using one of the available accessibility tools and the visual display.\n\nAudio mode: The visual display can be disabled, and the voter uses headphones to navigate an audio ballot using one of the available accessibility tools.\n\nVisual and audio mode: The voter navigates their ballot using one of the available accessibility tools, the visual display and the audio ballot."
