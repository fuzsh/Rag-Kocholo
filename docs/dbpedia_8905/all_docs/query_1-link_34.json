        "text": "Overview\n\nDyslexia is a learning disorder that involves difficulty reading due to problems identifying speech sounds and learning how they relate to letters and words (decoding). Also called a reading disability, dyslexia is a result of individual differences in areas of the brain that process language.\n\nDyslexia is not due to problems with intelligence, hearing or vision. Most children with dyslexia can succeed in school with tutoring or a specialized education program. Emotional support also plays an important role.\n\nThough there's no cure for dyslexia, early assessment and intervention result in the best outcome. Sometimes dyslexia goes undiagnosed for years and isn't recognized until adulthood, but it's never too late to seek help.\n\nSymptoms\n\nSigns of dyslexia can be difficult to recognize before your child enters school, but some early clues may indicate a problem. Once your child reaches school age, your child's teacher may be the first to notice a problem. Severity varies, but the condition often becomes apparent as a child starts learning to read.\n\nBefore school\n\nSigns that a young child may be at risk of dyslexia include:\n\nLate talking\n\nLearning new words slowly\n\nProblems forming words correctly, such as reversing sounds in words or confusing words that sound alike\n\nProblems remembering or naming letters, numbers and colors\n\nDifficulty learning nursery rhymes or playing rhyming games\n\nSchool age\n\nOnce your child is in school, dyslexia symptoms may become more apparent, including:\n\nReading well below the expected level for age\n\nProblems processing and understanding what is heard\n\nDifficulty finding the right word or forming answers to questions\n\nProblems remembering the sequence of things\n\nDifficulty seeing (and occasionally hearing) similarities and differences in letters and words\n\nInability to sound out the pronunciation of an unfamiliar word\n\nDifficulty spelling\n\nSpending an unusually long time completing tasks that involve reading or writing\n\nAvoiding activities that involve reading\n\nTeens and adults\n\nDyslexia signs in teens and adults are a lot like those in children. Some common dyslexia symptoms in teens and adults include:\n\nDifficulty reading, including reading aloud\n\nSlow and labor-intensive reading and writing\n\nProblems spelling\n\nAvoiding activities that involve reading\n\nMispronouncing names or words, or problems retrieving words\n\nSpending an unusually long time completing tasks that involve reading or writing\n\nDifficulty summarizing a story\n\nTrouble learning a foreign language\n\nDifficulty doing math word problems\n\nWhen to see a doctor\n\nThough most children are ready to learn reading by kindergarten or first grade, children with dyslexia often have trouble learning to read by that time. Talk with your health care provider if your child's reading level is below what's expected for your child's age or if you notice other signs of dyslexia.\n\nWhen dyslexia goes undiagnosed and untreated, childhood reading difficulties continue into adulthood.\n\nCauses\n\nDyslexia results from individual differences in the parts of the brain that enable reading. It tends to run in families. Dyslexia appears to be linked to certain genes that affect how the brain processes reading and language.\n\nRisk factors\n\nA family history of dyslexia or other reading or learning disabilities increases the risk of having dyslexia.\n\nComplications\n\nDyslexia can lead to several problems, including:\n\nTrouble learning. Because reading is a skill basic to most other school subjects, a child with dyslexia is at a disadvantage in most classes and may have trouble keeping up with peers.\n\nSocial problems. Left untreated, dyslexia may lead to low self-esteem, behavior problems, anxiety, aggression, and withdrawal from friends, parents and teachers.\n\nProblems as adults. The inability to read and comprehend can prevent children from reaching their potential as they grow up. This can have negative long-term educational, social and economic impacts."
