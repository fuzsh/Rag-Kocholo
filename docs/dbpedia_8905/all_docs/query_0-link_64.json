        "text": "What is ELEVIDYS (delandistrogene moxeparvovec-rokl)?\n\nELEVIDYS is a prescription gene therapy used to treat ambulatory children aged 4 through 5 years old with Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) who have a confirmed mutation in the dystrophin gene. ELEVIDYS was approved under accelerated approval. Accelerated approval allows for drugs to be approved based on a marker that is considered reasonably likely to predict a clinical benefit. ELEVIDYS treatment increased the marker, ELEVIDYS micro-dystrophin in patients treated with ELEVIDYS. Verification of a clinical benefit may be needed for ELEVIDYS to continue to be approved.\n\nImportant Safety Information\n\nWho should not receive ELEVIDYS?\n\nIndividuals with certain types of mutations, any deletion in exon 8 and/or exon 9 in the DMD gene, should not receive ELEVIDYS.\n\nWhat is the most important information to know about ELEVIDYS?\n\nELEVIDYS can increase certain liver enzyme levels and cause acute serious liver injury.\n\nPatients will receive oral corticosteroid medication before and after infusion with ELEVIDYS and will undergo weekly blood tests to monitor liver enzyme levels for 3 months after treatment. Contact a healthcare provider immediately if the patientâs skin and/or whites of the eyes appear yellowish or if the patient misses a dose of corticosteroid or vomits it up.\n\nAdministration of ELEVIDYS may be delayed in patients who have acute liver disease until the condition is resolved or under control. Patients with preexisting liver impairment, chronic liver infection, or acute liver disease may be at higher risk of acute serious liver injury.\n\nImmune-mediated myositis (an immune response affecting muscles) was observed in patients with a deletion mutation in the DMD gene that is contraindicated. Patients with certain mutation deletions (in exons 1 to 17 and/or exons 59 to 71) may be at risk for a severe immune-mediated myositis reaction. Caregivers should contact a healthcare provider immediately if the patient experiences any unexplained increased muscle pain, tenderness, or weakness, including difficulty swallowing, breathing, or speaking, as these may be symptoms of myositis.\n\nMyocarditis (inflammation of the heart) has been observed within days following ELEVIDYS infusion. The patientâs doctor will conduct weekly blood tests for the first month after treatment to evaluate troponin-I (a cardiac protein that can detect damage to muscle cells in the heart). Caregivers should contact a healthcare provider immediately if the patient begins to experience chest pain and/or shortness of breath. More frequent monitoring may be required if the patient has cardiac symptoms.\n\nPatients need to have blood tests to ensure that they do not have antibodies that may prevent them from being able to receive ELEVIDYS, as introducing the gene therapy could increase the risk of a severe allergic reaction or prevent desired therapeutic levels. Treatment with ELEVIDYS is not recommended for patients who have high antibodies to the vector, the part of gene therapy used to deliver ELEVIDYS.\n\nDue to the need to follow a corticosteroid regimen, an infection (such as cold, flu, gastroenteritis [stomach flu], otitis media [ear infection], bronchiolitis [respiratory infection], etc) before or after ELEVIDYS infusion could lead to more serious complications. Caregivers should contact a healthcare provider immediately if they see any symptoms suggestive of infection, such as coughing, wheezing, sneezing, runny nose, sore throat, or fever.\n\nAre there any considerations for vaccination schedules and ELEVIDYS?\n\nPatient vaccinations should be up to date with current immunization guidelines. Vaccinations should be received at least 4 weeks prior to starting the corticosteroid regimen that is required before receiving ELEVIDYS.\n\nAre there any precautions that need to be considered when handling a patientâs bodily waste?\n\nVector shedding of ELEVIDYS occurs primarily through body waste. Patients and caregivers should use proper hand hygiene, such as hand washing when coming into direct contact with patient body waste. Place potentially contaminated materials that may have the patientâs bodily fluids/waste in a sealable bag and dispose into regular trash. Precautions should be followed for 1 month after ELEVIDYS infusion.\n\nWhat are the possible or likely side effects of ELEVIDYS?\n\nThe most common side effects that occurred in patients treated with ELEVIDYS were vomiting, nausea, increased liver function tests, fever, and decreased platelet counts.\n\nThe safety information provided here is not comprehensive. Talk to the patientâs doctor about any side effects that bother the patient or that donât go away.\n\nYou are encouraged to report negative side effects of prescription drugs to the FDA. Visit www.fda.gov/medwatch or call 1-800-FDA-1088. You may also report side effects to Sarepta Therapeutics at 1-888-SAREPTA (1-888-727-3782)."
