        "text": "The Commission on Accreditation for Corrections\n\nThe Commission on Accreditation for Corrections (CAC) is the official accrediting body of the American Correctional Association. Created in 1974, the Commission is the official arbiter of accreditation status for all facilities and agencies. The Commission is comprised of a representative body of corrections professionals from all areas of the field- adult corrections and detention, juvenile corrections and detention, community corrections, probation, parole, and correctional health services.\n\nCommission members can be ether appointed to their position by the President of the Association, or elected to their seat. Members of the Commission include Directors of Corrections, Sheriffs, Jail Administrators, Superintendents, Parole Administrators, Doctors, and other administrators with experience in operating everything from large agencies at the state or national level to local facilities with a relatively small staff and population. Currently, ACA, through the Commission, accredits more than 1,300 facilities across the United States and the world. These include Federal, state, local, and private facilities of all types and sizes under ACA’s standards.\n\nThomas Stickrath, J.D., (OH)\n\nDirector\n\nOhio Department of Public Safety\n\nThomas Stickrath was appointed Director of the Ohio Department of Public Safety by Governor Mike DeWine in January of 2019. Stickrath began his career with the Ohio Department of Corrections, where he served as Warden, Regional Director of Prisons, and Assistant Director. In 2005, he became Director of the Ohio Department of Youth Services (DYS). In 2010, Governor Ted Strickland appointed Stickrath Director of the Department of Public Safety. Stickrath then served as the Superintendent of the Ohio Bureau of Criminal Investigation from 2011 until his reappointment as Director of Public Safety. He obtained his Bachelor’s and Law degrees from The Ohio State University, and received the University’s “Distinguished Service Award.” Stickrath’s commitment to corrections is extensive, and has earned him ACA’s E.R. Cass Award. He has served on the Standard’s Committee and the Commission on Accreditation, and assists in training new commissioners.
