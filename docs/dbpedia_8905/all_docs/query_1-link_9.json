These trainings are customized for your needs and DYS is proud to provide these trainings to local schools, daycares, and more at no cost to the family or school.\n\nDYS collaborates with the community to provide a variety of year-round programs for the whole family! Meet other families living with diabetes at our Kalahari Waterpark Adventure, Toledo Mud Hens Baseball Games, Pool Parties, and so much more! Family programs are a great way to gain support from other families also facing the challenges of diabetes.\n\nHot Shots Camp is a safe place for kids with diabetes to try a variety of firsts; some diabetes-related and some not. At some point, every child with diabetes has felt alone. At camp, they realize they are never alone! Campers return from camp feeling more confident in themselves and knowing they have a whole community to support them."
