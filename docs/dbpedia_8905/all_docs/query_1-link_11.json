        "text": "From our inception in 1984 through 2001, DYS operated as a sponsored activity of Mercy Health Partners, a nonprofit health system serving northwest Ohio. Budget restrictions reduced the ability of our original sponsor to underwrite our operating expenses and in 2001, DYS became an independent nonprofit social service agency. Through this transition, careful planning allowed DYS to maintain its core programs, respond to emerging needs, and sustain services for the most significant impact on children with diabetes now and for their future. DYS has emerged as an effective organization serving 34 counties in Ohio and Michigan.\n\nToday, we are incorporated as a 501(c)(3) nonprofit organization with three staff members and a pool of nurse educators. We are currently located in Toledo, Ohio and continue to serve all of northwest Ohio and southeast Michigan as the main provider of services for youth living with diabetes. All dollars are raised and invested locally into the youth of our community.\n\nDiabetes Youth Services (DYS) is an independent non-profit organization serving northwest Ohio and southeast Michigan. We provide educational and supportive services for young people with type 1 diabetes, their families, schools and communities. We work in cooperation with all area hospitals, health care providers, the American Diabetes Association (ADA), Juvenile Diabetes Research Foundation (JDRF), and the Southeastern Michigan Diabetes Outreach Network (SEMDON). DYS does not receive funding from these organizations, United Way, or any other public agency. DYS services are sustained through the generous support of individuals, corporate, and community charitable contributions. All programs are staffed by experienced pediatric diabetes educators and are provided at low cost or for free."
