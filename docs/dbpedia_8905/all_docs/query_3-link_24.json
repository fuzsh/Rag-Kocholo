        "text": "The scope of this page is resonance disorders in children and adults. Resonance disorders—specifically hypernasality—are also discussed in ASHA’s Practice Portal page on Cleft Lip and Palate as they relate to clefting.\n\nVelopharyngeal dysfunction (VPD) is discussed in this page as it relates to resonance disorders. See Possible Causes of Hypernasality and/or Nasal Emission. For a discussion of articulation disorders that may co-occur with VPD and resonance disorders, see ASHA’s Practice Portal page on Cleft Lip and Palate.\n\nResonance disorders are not voice disorders, although they are often mislabeled as such. Resonance disorders should not be confused with conditions targeted by resonant voice therapy, an approach that emphasizes phonation with the least effort and impact on the vocal folds. See ASHA’s Practice Portal page on Voice Disorders. Resonance, however, depends upon voicing as discussed below.\n\nSee the Velopharyngeal Dysfunction Evidence Map for summaries of available research on this topic as it relates to resonance disorders.\n\nResonance is the modification of sound from the vocal folds and is determined by the size and shape of the vocal tract, including the pharyngeal, oral, and nasal cavities.\n\nSpeech resonance is the result of the transfer of sound produced by the vocal folds (source) through the vocal tract (filter). The vocal tract selectively enhances harmonics of the source (voicing) based on the size and/or shape of the supralaryngeal cavities, the pharynx, and the oral and nasal cavities.\n\nThe velopharyngeal valve is integral to achieving appropriate speech resonance; however, other aspects of the vocal tract also contribute to perceived resonance. These include\n\nthe size and shape of the resonating cavities (pharynx, oral cavity, and nasal cavity);\n\nthe position of the tongue; and\n\nthe degree of mouth opening and lip rounding.\n\nNormal resonance is achieved through an appropriate balance of oral and nasal sound energy, based on the intended speech sound. Resonance varies for vowels, voiced oral consonants, and nasal consonants as well as across languages and dialects. Most vowels and vocalic consonants in the English language are predominantly oral, meaning they are produced with the velopharyngeal port closed or nearly closed. Normal resonance has a range of acceptability and is perceived along a continuum (Peterson-Falzone et al., 2010).\n\nResonance disorders result from too much or too little nasal and/or oral sound energy in the speech signal. They can result from structural or functional (e.g., neurogenic) causes. Speech-language pathologists (SLPs) use differential diagnosis to determine if issues are related to structural and/or functional causes or if the errors are due to mislearning as the different etiologies require different treatment plans. Articulation errors due to mislearning may be misinterpreted as a resonance disorder.\n\nResonance disorders should not be confused with nasal airflow errors or distortions. Nasal airflow errors are related to articulation when there is an inappropriate escape or release of air through the nasal cavity during production of pressure consonants—consonants that are produced by bursts of streamed air (i.e., /p, b, t, d, k, g, f, v, s, z, ʃ, t͡ʃ, θ, d͡ʒ, ʒ, ð/). Nasal airflow errors may be categorized into one of the following error types:\n\nlearned errors—maladaptive articulation errors that are produced through the nose and used to replace oral fricatives (e.g., nasal fricatives, pharyngeal fricatives, and phoneme-specific nasal emission)\n\nobligatory errors—exist due to structural abnormalities that result in velopharyngeal insufficiency and oral structural deviations (e.g., oronasal fistulas, dental deviations, or malocclusions)\n\ncompensatory errors—actively learned maladaptive articulations that develop in response to abnormal structures found in VPD\n\nSee ASHA’s Practice Portal page on Cleft Lip and Palate for further discussion.\n\nResonance disorders include the following:\n\nHypernasality—occurs when there is abnormal sound energy in the nasal cavity during production of voiced, oral sounds. Hypernasality is primarily a vowel phenomenon but can occur on other voiced sounds.\n\nHyponasality—occurs when there is reduced nasal resonance or energy associated with nasal sounds, typically due to a blockage or an obstruction in the nasopharynx or nasal cavity or related to a neurological condition.\n\nCul-de-sac resonance—occurs when sound circulates within a cavity (oral, nasal, or pharyngeal) being “trapped” and unable to exit, typically because of an obstruction within the vocal tract. As described below, different types of cul-de-sac resonance are possible depending on the location of the obstruction.\n\nMixed resonance—presence of hypernasal, hyponasal, and/or cul-de-sac resonance in the same speaker depending on the intended speech sound.\n\nHypernasality should not be confused with nasal air emission. Although some clinicians may use these terms interchangeably, they are distinct symptoms of VPD that typically occur on different speech sounds. Hypernasality is a resonance phenomenon that occurs primarily on vowels, and nasal air emission is an aerodynamic phenomenon that occurs primarily on oral pressure consonants, especially voiceless consonants (Zajac & Vallino, 2016). When VPD is present, both hypernasality and nasal air emission can occur in the same speaker, but they are different entities.\n\nSee ASHA’s Practice Portal page on Cleft Lip and Palate for further discussion of nasal air emission, including learned nasal fricatives.\n\nSee the Assessment section of the Velopharyngeal Dysfunction Evidence Map for pertinent scientific evidence, expert opinion, and client/caregiver perspective, as they relate to resonance disorders.\n\nAssessment and treatment of resonance disorders may require the use of appropriate personal protective equipment.\n\nAssessment includes evaluation of oral, nasal, and velopharyngeal (VP) function for speech production. The goal is to help determine if an individual would benefit from speech therapy and/or if medical (i.e., surgical or prosthetic) intervention might be warranted. The SLP conducts the assessment alone or as a member of a collaborative team that may include family members or care partners as well as other relevant professionals (e.g., otolaryngologist, surgeon, or prosthodontist).\n\nDifferential diagnosis is important during assessment and treatment selection to distinguish VP mislearning from other causes of velopharyngeal dysfunction (VPD). Referral to an appropriate team (e.g., craniofacial, cleft palate, or VPD team) is necessary if differential diagnosis cannot be determined during initial assessment or if it is determined that surgical or prosthodontic treatment is warranted.\n\nScreening\n\nScreening for suspected resonance disorders identifies the need for additional and/or more comprehensive assessment but does not provide a diagnosis. Clinicians must consider the norms of a particular language spoken as well as linguistic variance and/or influence when screening an individual’s speech for signs of resonance disorder.\n\nScreening typically includes the following.\n\nSpeech Screening\n\nObtain a limited speech sample in all languages spoken to look for\n\nsigns and symptoms of a resonance disorder, including sounds affected, consistency of symptoms, and severity;\n\nthe presence of nasal emission (obligatory or compensatory/learned); and\n\nthe presence and type of articulation errors.\n\nPerform an oral exam to look for anatomical/structural differences (e.g., cleft-related such as submucous cleft, fistula, or bifid uvula; non–cleft-related such as enlarged tonsils).\n\nSee the Assessment section of ASHA’s Practice Portal page on Cleft Lip and Palate for further details related to screening in persons with cleft lip and palate.\n\nHearing Screening\n\nConduct a hearing screening to identify individuals at risk for hearing loss who require referral to audiology for full hearing evaluation and management.\n\nSet up a monitoring program to rescreen hearing as needed if the hearing screening is passed.\n\nSee ASHA’s Practice Portal pages on Adult Hearing Screening and Childhood Hearing Screening for information about hearing screenings.\n\nComprehensive Assessment\n\nSee ASHA’s Practice Portal resource, Comprehensive Assessment for Cleft Lip and Palate and Resonance. Some components of the comprehensive assessment for resonance disorders are similar to those of the comprehensive assessment for cleft lip and palate.\n\nConsistent with the World Health Organization’s International Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health (ICF) framework (ASHA, 2023; World Health Organization, 2001), assessment is conducted to identify and describe\n\nimpairments in body structure and function, including underlying strengths and weaknesses related to resonance factors that affect communication performance;\n\ncomorbid deficits or conditions, such as developmental disabilities, syndromes, neuromuscular diseases, or hearing loss;\n\nlimitations in activity and participation, including functional communication in everyday communication contexts (see, e.g., Skirko et al., 2015);\n\ncontextual (environmental and personal) factors that serve as barriers to or facilitators of successful communication and life participation; and\n\nthe impact of communication impairments on quality of life of the individual and family.\n\nSee ASHA’s resource on the International Classification of Functioning, Disability, and Health (ICF) for examples of ICF handouts specific to selected disorders.\n\nAssessment may include instrumental evaluation if available and appropriate. Acoustic/spectral correlates of hypernasality are well known and include (a) reduced amplitude of the first formant (F1); (b) the appearance of a “nasal formant” typically below F1; (c) shifts in the frequency of formants, especially F1; and (d) increased bandwidths of formants. When hypernasality is severe, changes in acoustic/spectral properties of vowels can result in reduced intelligibility of a speaker.\n\nLinguistic Considerations\n\nClinicians must consider the norms of a particular language spoken as well as linguistic variance and/or influence when evaluating an individual’s speech for signs of resonance disorder.\n\nIndividuals who speak a dialect or whose speech is influenced by native languages other than English may speak with a different tone or nasality than native English speakers or speakers of Mainstream American English dialect. These differences (e.g., glottalized tones or nasalized vowels) may affect perceptual judgments of nasality. Consequently, clinicians who are unfamiliar with the linguistic characteristics of the individual’s dialect or accent may have difficulty distinguishing a resonance difference from a resonance disorder (Bae et al., 2020; Velik et al., 2019).\n\nRegardless of the language spoken, vowels (particularly high vowels) and pressure consonants are most vulnerable to VPD. Clinicians need to consider the presence and frequency of occurrence of these sounds in a particular language, as well as the degree of nasality produced by typical speakers of that language (Cordero, 2008; Lee et al., 2008; Willadsen & Henningsson, 2011). The presence of lexical tones (e.g., in tonal languages such as Cantonese) should also be taken into consideration when assessing possible VPD (Cordero, 2008), as tonal languages have been shown to present with different levels of nasalance compared to nontonal languages (see V. T. Nguyen et al., 2019, and D. M. Nguyen et al., 2021, for examples).\n\nSee ASHA’s Practice Portal page on Cultural Responsiveness and ASHA’s resource on phonemic inventories and cultural and linguistic information across languages for additional support.\n\nSpecial Considerations: Deaf and Hard of Hearing\n\nThere is no “one size fits all” communication approach for those who are identified as deaf and hard of hearing. Language may be manual (e.g., American Sign Language), spoken (oral/aural), or both (total communication). Individuals identified as deaf and hard of hearing who chose spoken language for communication can exhibit resonance disorders characterized by hypernasality or hyponasality, mixed resonance, or cul-de-sac resonance. In most cases, these resonance problems result from poor control of the VP valve due to limited auditory feedback as a result of the hearing loss. Despite having normal structure and muscle movement, the VP valve may lack rhythm and timing. These individuals may have speech characteristics including abnormal resonance on vowels and nasal consonants (Coelho et al., 2015). It is important that other anatomical causes of resonance disorder be ruled out, particularly if hearing loss is secondary to a syndrome. Please see ASHA’s Practice Portal page on Language and Communication of Deaf and Hard of Hearing Children for further information on this population.\n\nSee the Treatment section of the Velopharyngeal Dysfunction Evidence Map for pertinent scientific evidence, expert opinion, and client/caregiver perspective, as they relate to resonance disorders.\n\nTreatment is indicated for individuals of all ages when their ability to communicate effectively is impaired because of resonance and related articulation disorders. The goal of treatment is to achieve improved resonance to facilitate functional oral communication.\n\nConsistent with the World Health Organization (2001) framework, treatment is designed to\n\ncapitalize on strengths and address weaknesses related to underlying structures and functions that affect resonance and articulation;\n\nfacilitate activities and participation by helping the individual acquire new skills and strategies; and\n\nmodify contextual factors to reduce barriers and enhance facilitators of successful communication and participation, including identification and use of appropriate accommodations.\n\nTreatment procedures and approaches discussed below include\n\nsurgical management,\n\nprosthetic management,\n\npharmacologic management, and\n\nbehavioral speech therapy.\n\nTreatment selection considers the cause of the resonance disorder; the appropriateness of treatment for the individual’s chronological and developmental age; and the individual’s medical status, physical and sensory abilities, cognitive status, and cultural and linguistic background. Goals for individuals who speak a language other than English consider their linguistic background.\n\nSee ASHA’s Practice Portal resource, Treatment Decision Tree for Managing Speech Problems Associated with Cleft Palate and VPD for more information.\n\nSurgical Management\n\nHypernasality\n\nSurgical management is the most common treatment for hypernasal speech due to velopharyngeal insufficiency (VPI; structural) and may also be used to treat oronasal fistulas that are symptomatic for speech. Procedures include the following (Tse et al., 2023):\n\nPalate-based surgery, such as double-opposing Z-plasty, soft palate elongation, midline incision, and intravelar veloplasty. These surgeries are done to repair the primary muscle and reconstruct the palate to create favorable anatomy for velopharyngeal (VP) function.\n\nPharynx-based surgery, such as pharyngeal flap (flap raised from the posterior pharyngeal wall and surgically connected to the velum to close the pharyngeal port at midline while leaving the lateral ports open for nasal breathing and the production of nasal sounds) and sphincter pharyngoplasty (flaps raised from the posterior pharyngeal wall and surgically transposed to a horizontal inset along the posterior pharyngeal wall to reduce the diameter of the VP port).\n\nAugmentation, such as fat grafting to fill in small VP gaps.\n\nCombinations, to include the combination of any of the above surgical options such as double-opposing Z-plasty plus sphincter pharyngoplasty.\n\nHyponasality\n\nSurgical management for hyponasality involves procedures to correct anatomical sources of obstruction. Procedures include\n\ntonsillectomy/adenoidectomy,\n\nremoval of nasal polyps,\n\nsurgery to correct a deviated septum,\n\nsurgical removal of the tissue or bone of the nasal passage to treat choanal atresia, and\n\nsurgical reconstruction to enlarge stenotic nares.\n\nProsthetic Management\n\nProsthetic management is uncommon in cases where resonance disorder is anatomically based but may be used for correcting resonance problems that are neurologically based, when surgical options are not recommended for the patient by the surgical team, or in rare cases where surgery has not completely resolved the problem. In cases when a consultation with a prosthodontist is being considered, SLPs may collaborate with that prosthodontist to assist in prosthetic design, positioning, or adjustments for optimal speech and swallowing function (Jackson, 2015).\n\nProsthetic management may include\n\na palatal obturator (to occlude an oronasal fistula),\n\na “speech bulb” (to occlude the velopharynx when there is VPI),\n\na palatal lift (to elevate the velum when there is VPI to compensate for poor velar mobility), and\n\na nasal obturator (used for individuals with VPI or velopharyngeal incompetency to decrease airflow during speech; can be used when a palatal lift is not an option).\n\nPharmacologic Management\n\nPharmacologic management is sometimes indicated when swelling or inflammation in the nasal cavity due to allergies or other irritants is causing or contributing to hyponasality. Medications include antihistamines or steroids delivered via nasal sprays or oral medication.\n\nBehavioral Speech Therapy\n\nBehavioral speech therapy cannot correct resonance disorders that are due to structural causes. Therapy is considered if it has been determined through an evaluation that the abnormal resonance is due to causes other than structural.\n\nBehavioral speech therapy may be considered for the following:\n\nPhoneme-specific nasal air emission or phoneme-specific hypernasality\n\nTechniques and tools for targeting these errors include the following:\n\nvisual feedback provided by a dental mirror placed under the nose during production of oral target phonemes\n\nvisual biofeedback provided by the See-Scape™\n\nauditory biofeedback provided by the Oral and Nasal Listener™\n\nauditory biofeedback provided by a stethoscope (placed against the side of the nose)\n\nplastic tubing or a drinking straw for self-monitoring one’s own productions (one end is placed at the patient’s/client’s nostril entrance, and the other end is placed by the ear)\n\na nasometer to monitor oral versus nasal speech and provide real-time visual feedback in cases of phoneme-specific disorders (see the Treatment section of ASHA’s Practice Portal page on Cleft Lip and Palate)\n\nuse of established/accurate phonemes to shape those affected by phoneme-specific nasal air emission (e.g., using /t/ to shape /s/)\n\nCompensatory misarticulations that are present, regardless of the VP status (common in patients with a history of cleft palate)\n\nChanging articulation placement on affected sounds can have some beneficial effect on perception of resonance (see initial therapy targets and strategies and techniques in the Treatment section of ASHA’s Practice Portal page on Cleft Lip and Palate).\n\nPostoperative hypernasality\n\nPersistent hypernasality after VP surgery may be treated by speech therapy with biofeedback (see options above); the potential for adequate VP closure during speech should be confirmed prior to initiating therapy. Various biofeedback techniques may be tried, including nasoendoscopy and/or nasometry. Displaying “oralance” rather than “nasalance” during nasometry biofeedback may be effective in increasing a speaker’s overall oral resonance, especially if loudness is reduced (Zajac & Vallino, 2016).\n\nHypernasality that persists more than a few months post-surgery should be referred to the cleft palate/craniofacial or velopharyngeal dysfunction team for reassessment and consideration of possible surgical revision and/or prosthetic management.\n\nMuscle weakness/dysarthria resulting in hypernasality\n\nCompensate for persistent resonance disorder—use techniques specific to dysarthria, including modifying the speech pattern (e.g., clear speech, loud speech).\n\nVP resistance treatment—continuous positive airway pressure for resistance training during speech (Cahill et al., 2004; Kollara et al., 2014; Kuehn, 1997; Kuehn et al., 2002). The goal of this therapy is to increase velar muscle strength and endurance during speech.\n\nExpiratory muscle strength training (EMST) involves the use of an external device to mechanically overload the expiratory muscles. EMST uses exercise to increase maximum expiratory pressure. SLPs typically use EMST to treat voice disorders, but EMST may also have potential for resonance disorder treatment.\n\nArticulation errors secondary to apraxia of speech (work on planning/coordination of VP movement)\n\nAs articulation improves, perception of resonance may also improve as the velum articulates more accurately.\n\nIdiopathic hypernasality\n\nSpeech therapy may be tried on a trial basis in cases of idiopathic hypernasality when there is no confirmed structural anomaly.\n\nSpecial Populations: Deaf and Hard of Hearing\n\nSLPs and audiologists provide therapy to support the language and manner that match individuals’ communication preferences (e.g., signed language vs. spoken language). Individuals who are deaf and hard of hearing often have difficulty monitoring VP function due to lack of, or decreased, auditory feedback. Hearing aids and cochlear implants serve to assist the individual’s auditory feedback mechanisms, thereby improving self-monitoring skills.\n\nCochlear implants have been shown to increase understanding of speech and help improve the resonance of oral speakers (Sebastian et al., 2015). Improved nasalance scores following cochlear implantation demonstrate the role of auditory feedback in helping monitor VP function (Hassan et al., 2012; L. H. P. Nguyen et al., 2008).\n\nAfter obtaining hearing aids or receiving cochlear implantation, individuals often benefit from aural (re)habilitation to improve listening and communication skills. Additional goals may address speech (e.g., improving consonant production) and resonance, taking advantage of improved auditory feedback. For information on aural (re)habilitation in children with cochlear implants, see ASHA’s Practice Portal page on Cochlear Implants.\n\nIndividuals who are profoundly deaf may benefit from visual and tactile feedback to normalize hypernasal speech (L. H. P. Nguyen et al., 2008).\n\nThese feedback techniques may include\n\nvisual monitoring of nasal airflow with a mirror or nasometer and\n\ntactile feedback during chewing exercises associated with vibratory sensations in the nasal and facial bones or during humming.\n\nPlease see ASHA’s Practice Portal page on Language and Communication of Deaf and Hard of Hearing Children for further information on this population.\n\nCollaboration in Treatment\n\nCommunity-based SLPs—including private practitioners and school-based SLPs—who are involved in the treatment of individuals with resonance disorders are encouraged to collaborate with cleft palate/craniofacial teams and other appropriate professionals, including otolaryngologists and plastic/craniofacial surgeons, to maximize speech outcomes. School-based and private practice/clinic-based SLPs are encouraged to refer to these teams as needed to ensure quality of care. See also ASHA’s resources on collaboration and teaming and interprofessional education/interprofessional practice (IPE/IPP).\n\nService Delivery\n\nIn addition to determining the type of speech and language treatment that is optimal for individuals with resonance disorders, SLPs consider other service delivery variables—including format, provider, dosage, timing, and setting—that may affect treatment outcomes.\n\nFormat—whether a person is seen for treatment one-on-one (i.e., individual) or as part of a group; telepractice can be used to deliver face-to-face services remotely. See ASHA’s Practice Portal page on Telepractice.\n\nProvider—the person providing treatment (e.g., SLP, trained volunteer, care partner).\n\nDosage—the frequency, intensity, and duration of service.\n\nTiming—when the intervention is conducted relative to the diagnosis.\n\nSetting—the location of treatment (e.g., home, community-based, school).\n\nFor further information, please see the Service Delivery section in ASHA’s Velopharyngeal Dysfunction Evidence Map.\n\nAmerican Speech-Language-Hearing Association.
