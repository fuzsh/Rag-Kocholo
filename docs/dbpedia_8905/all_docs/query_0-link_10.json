        "text": "What is now the Arkansas Juvenile Assessment & Treatment Center (AJATC) was established in 1905 as a Girls Industrial School. In the late 1970s, Youth Services began housing both boys and girls at the center. Today, it serves not only as a treatment center but also as the primary intake and assessment center for all youth committed to DYS. The center’s maximum security dorm serves some of DYS’ most behaviorally troubled and violent youth. That dorm is one of six Serious Offender Programs for youths in the state. The center is in Saline County near the town of Alexander."
