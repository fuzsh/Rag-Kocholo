        "text": "Providing Special Education Services Statewide\n\nSEIS Mission\n\nThe mission of SEIS is to provide high quality special education services within a statewide education program in an interagency context, that will support SEIS students to transition from the host agency settings to the community and facilitate student success in postsecondary and career pathways.\n\nOverview\n\nSince July 2008 we have worked with DESE to coordinate and deliver special education services to students in the care of the Department of Youth Services (DYS), Department of Mental Health (DMH), Department of Public Health (DPH), and the County Houses of Correction (CHC), as outlined in Technical Assistance Advisory SPED 2021-3: Shared Responsibility for Special Education Services in Institutional Settings.\n\nAs the Contracted Education Provider for the SEIS Program, CES recruits, hires and trains special education teachers; collaborates with host agency leaders in educational program improvement; designs and implements a statewide web-based student information system; supports coordinated technology development and curriculum integration; and monitors compliance with federal and state special education regulations.\n\nThrough the SEIS Program, CES ensures that special education services are provided to eligible students residing in host agency facilities. To the extent that resources allow, SEIS provides the special education services designated on the students’ Individualized Education Programs (IEPs). The school districts responsible for the students must provide any special education services that SEIS does not provide. The students’ school districts retain sole responsibility for evaluating, developing, and issuing an IEP and providing the notices associated with the mandated procedural safeguards. Additionally, in certain DMH and DPH facilities, SEIS provides a full day general education program to students.\n\nOur Approach\n\nThe SEIS Professional Development and Curriculum department, in collaboration with the CES Professional Development Department, provides structured professional development (PD) to support educators to help their students learn to the best of their ability. Within the Host Agencies we work with a diverse population of students with varying degrees of need. This requires the educators to have a toolkit of strategies to be able to make the curriculum accessible and to reach all learners.\n\nThere are over 250 special education students in more than 70 institutional settings across Massachusetts, all of whom have the right to a quality education. These students range from students with serious medical conditions, who may reside at the Pappas Rehabilitation Hospital for Children until they reach 22 years of age, to transitional age students in the CHC or DMH Adult programs who have self-identified as needing special education services, to students who have been placed into the care of the DYS, or the DMH.\n\nContinuous Movement Forward\n\nHighlights of the past years working with the SEIS Program include the use and improvement of a web-based Student Information System which houses many different data sets regarding the SEIS student population. CES also hosts IEP Reconvene and SEIS Initial Education Meetings to improve student outcomes by cultivating a shared responsibility among various stakeholders using an exit upon entry approach. We also provide a robust professional development system that includes meaningful and individualized PD opportunities around High Leverage Practices, Social Justice and Equity and trauma-informed practice, and Universal Design for Learning; statewide instructional coaching; and a comprehensive and robust mentoring and New Teaching Induction programs. CES utilizes current curricular and assessment resources, and students also have access to online learning platforms that facilitate and support credit recovery. Technology is integrated into all SEIS services, and our programs have 1:1 technology featuring Chromebooks."
