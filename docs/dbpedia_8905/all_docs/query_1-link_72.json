        "text": "Adults who have finished high school but who still struggle with reading may be wondering, “Do I have dyslexia?” The same is true for parents who struggle with reading and have a child who has been diagnosed with dyslexia. They may be wondering, “Do I have dyslexia, too?”\n\nA surprising number of adults have dyslexia that was not diagnosed while they were in school. Signs of dyslexia in adults include:\n\nReading slowly and with great effort\n\nStruggling to sound out unfamiliar words\n\nAvoiding reading aloud and rarely reading for pleasure\n\nHaving poor spelling\n\nFinding it much harder to express thoughts on paper than out loud\n\nHaving a family member with dyslexia\n\nDyslexia tends to run in families. If a younger child is diagnosed with dyslexia, chances are good that an older sibling or parent also has it. Learn about how adults can find out if they have dyslexia after they have finished high school.\n\nDyslexia tests for adults\n\nThere are lots of online screening tests for dyslexia. Adults of any age who think they may have dyslexia can find out with a formal evaluation.\n\nAn evaluation for reading issues involves a series of tests. These measure skills like reading accuracy and reading fluency. The tests also measure reading comprehension and listening comprehension.\n\nThe tests are often the same or similar to those used to assess kids. But they are designed to work across a wide age range.\n\nSpecialists who test adults for dyslexia\n\nOnly certain types of specialists are qualified to assess people for dyslexia. These include:\n\nNeuropsychologists\n\nEducational psychologists\n\nClinical psychologists\n\nYou may want to ask specialists you’re considering if adults make up a significant portion of their practice. Why? Adults may have developed their own coping strategies over the years. This can make it harder to evaluate adults than kids.\n\nWhere to find specialists who test adults for dyslexia\n\nThere are several resources that can help you find specialists in your area who can assess adults for dyslexia. You may want to contact:\n\nState and local chapters of the Learning Disabilities Association of America, an Understood founding partner\n\nLocal college or university psychology departments with PhD programs in the areas mentioned above\n\nUniversity-affiliated hospitals and clinics\n\nYour state’s vocational rehabilitation (VR) agency\n\nCommunity mental health centers\n\nHow to cover the cost of dyslexia testing\n\nAn evaluation can be expensive. Some insurance plans will cover it, but many don’t.\n\nUniversity psychology departments sometimes offer a sliding scale fee for these kinds of assessments. Local mental health clinics sometimes do this too. VR agencies may provide this kind of testing at no cost for an adult who is accepted as a new client.\n\nAs you search for qualified specialists, you may want to ask them:\n\nWill my insurance cover the cost?\n\nDo you offer financial aid or other funding sources?\n\nCan you provide a payment plan?\n\nTreating adults with dyslexia\n\nAn evaluation will give a full picture of learning differences and strengths. The results will include strategies to help. The results can also be used to request accommodations in college or accommodations in the workplace.\n\nAdults with dyslexia benefit from the same kind of instruction that helps kids with dyslexia. But the teaching methods need to be tailored for adults. Look for literary specialists or reading tutors who are trained to teach adults.\n\nThe biggest issue for adult learners may be finding the time to put into improving reading skills. Consistency and practice at home are the most important factors for rapid progress.\n\nBut no matter how long it takes, remember that it’s never too late to become a better reader."
