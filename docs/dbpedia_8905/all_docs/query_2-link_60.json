        "text": "Ohio's youth prison and juvenile detention centers are failing.\n\nKids in the state's juvenile justice system often face violence and neglect, while guards remain overwhelmed, understaffed and in fear for their own safety.\n\nRather than rehabilitating and educating teens, more than four in 10 of them end up returning to the youth system or entering Ohio's adult prisons. Those who don’t return to prison face a higher chance of an early, violent death.\n\nJournalists from the Cincinnati Enquirer, Columbus Dispatch, Akron Beacon Journal and Canton Repository spent months investigating and documenting what happens to kids behind bars.\n\n[ Reporters with USA TODAY's network of Ohio newspapers spent eight months investigating the state's juvenile justice system. Consider supporting their work with a subscription. ]\n\nHere's what they found.\n\nKids behind bars: Chaos, violence and neglect plague youth prisons and detention centers\n\nOhio’s juvenile prisons and detention centers are supposed to be safe places, where the state’s most troubled children are sent for what might be a last chance to turn their lives around before adulthood.\n\nBut instead of finding refuge from crime and mayhem, kids in juvenile detention often encounter a world more dangerous than the one they left behind.\n\nBecause chaos is so rampant, the investigation found, local juvenile detention centers and the state’s juvenile prisons consistently fail in their most basic mission: to provide a safe environment for young offenders while trying to turn them into productive members of society.\n\nRead the full story.\n\nJuvenile justice in Ohio: How the system is supposed to work\n\nOhio operates a complex system of services for kids accused of delinquent acts. The goal is to give children as many chances as possible to avoid delinquency charges, detention, court appearances and even time in prison.\n\nKids who get into trouble may be on a road to prison, so the state builds off-ramps to divert them to a different course. Often, diversion starts when a police officer decides whether to arrest a child or bring them back to their parents. But there are many other exits.\n\nHowever, when children are accused of serious, violent offenses that endanger the public, they can end up in juvenile detention and, eventually, youth prison. Some go to adult court and then adult prisons.\n\nIt's a complex system, so let us explain how the Department of Youth Services is set up.\n\nRead the full story.\n\nParalyzed but still wearing an ankle monitor, Ohio teen works to rebuild life after jail\n\nDamarion Allen sits in his wheelchair, shoeless and half-dressed, an ankle monitor strapped to his right leg.\n\nThe skin around his ankle is red and scabby, rubbed raw by the monitor, which a judge has ordered him to wear as a condition of his release from the Franklin County Juvenile Detention Center.\n\nWhen he went into the center, Damarion, 15, was an athletic kid who loved football and lacrosse. When he came out on May 7, he was on a stretcher, paralyzed from the waist down.\n\nRead the full story.\n\nJuvenile prison guard David Upshaw wanted to make a difference, but attack changed his life\n\nIt was like any other night on the late shift at Indian River Correctional Facility. David Upshaw, a retired cop, arrived at the Massillon facility on Oct. 18, 2022, and began working on the Bravo unit, notoriously known for housing teens with behavior problems.\n\nWith the nightly head count complete, Upshaw stopped to talk to one of the young men on his unit. Nineteen-year-old Demetrice Taylor was standing in the doorway of his cell. The two had a good relationship. Taylor joked with Upshaw and called him \"Pops\" as many of the other kids did.\n\nBut that night something was different. It wasn't long before things took a turn for the worse.\n\nRead the full story.\n\nIs Ohio inadvertently creating new generations of criminals?\n\nOhio incarcerates a couple dozen kids age 17 and younger at any one time at the Correctional Reception Center south of Columbus in Pickaway County.\n\nThe teens are kept in a unit separate from adults, a change implemented after Daniel’s attack, when the federal Prison Rape Elimination Act became law in 2003. But on the day those kids turn 18, they’re moved into the general prison population, housed alongside some adults who view them as prey.\n\nThis is a story about bindover, Ohio’s legal process of moving children who are disproportionately Black and brown out of a juvenile justice system aimed at reform and into an adult system built for punishment. It's also a story about how adult incarceration impacts kids, their families and all Ohioans, since kids who go to prison return to their communities older, with more criminal connections and with a felony record that makes it hard to find work.\n\nRead the full story.\n\n'We need to break the cycle and give kids hope.' How Marion County closed its juvy lockup\n\nWhen \"J.E\" first showed up at the Marion County Family Resource Center, the scrawny 13-year-old suffered from multiple traumas, had been removed from his parents via child protective services and was facing arson charges in juvenile court.\n\nThe resource center, which replaced the county detention center, provided structure, intensive intervention and services to get J.E. on a path to normalcy. The teen is now in foster care, earning good grades and playing football. \"He's thriving,\" Leffler said.\n\nLeffler points to J.E. as a success story for the Family Resource Center, which seeks to divert kids from the juvenile justice system and provide needed services.\n\nRead the full story.\n\nWho’s in charge of Ohio’s dangerous youth lockups? Elected leaders\n\nThe responsibility for running Ohio's youth prisons and local juvenile detention centers rests with elected officials: the governor at the state level and juvenile court judges at the local level.\n\nThe Correctional Institution Inspection Committee, a bipartisan panel of lawmakers, inspects the youth prisons and publishes reports about its findings. But it has no authority over the 33 local juvenile detention centers, which are largely run by county judges and their hired staff.\n\nAnd because the juvenile system operates under confidentiality laws, it's exceedingly difficult for the public to see what's happening behind closed doors.\n\nRead the full story.\n\nFrom the editor: How and why we did a statewide investigation into Ohio's youth prisons\n\nFrom Beryl Love: More than a dozen journalists from The Cincinnati Enquirer, Columbus Dispatch, Akron Beacon Journal and other news organizations in the USA TODAY Network Ohio, spent eight months investigating what happens to kids behind bars. The journalists found a system plagued by violence, chaos and neglect.\n\nBy many measures, teens aren't being rehabilitated. Instead, they're coming out worse.\n\nSo where does the buck stop? Who’s accountable for Ohio's youth prisons and juvenile detention centers? Our special report answers that complex question,\n\nRead the full story.\n\nOhio is creating 'monsters' at youth prisons. DeWine must act now to save kids | Our View\n\nFrom the USA TODAY Network Ohio editorial boards: Instead of rehabilitation and human dignity, youth offenders housed in Ohio’s dangerously shattered Department of Youth Services facilities are often exposed to violence and neglect.\n\nWe realize the youths imprisoned in DYS facilities are no angels — they were sentenced for crimes as despicable as armed robbery, rape and murder — but these kids are not disposable. They are human. They deserve a shot at rehabilitation. Their parents deserve to see them come home as healthy as they entered. The families of DYS staffers have the same expectation for their loved ones.\n\nIt is the governor’s responsibility to make sure that happens. His administration is failing the youths, their families, DYS workers and the people of Ohio.\n\nRead the full story.\n\nOhio Politics Explained: Chaos in Ohio's Youth Lockups\n\nA USA TODAY Network Ohio investigation found Ohio’s youth prison system is plagued by violence, staffing shortages and a failure to rehabilitate kids.\n\nWe broke down the project’s findings and what needs to change.\n\nListen to the podcast.\n\nDeWine calls for group to examine problems at youth prisons after newspaper investigation\n\nOhio Gov. Mike DeWine wants a special working group to examine problems found by an eight-month investigation into Ohio's youth prisons and local juvenile detention centers.\n\nThe investigation by The Cincinnati Enquirer, The Columbus Dispatch, Akron Beacon Journal, Canton Repository and other newspapers found the system is overwhelmed by violence and trauma and doesn't have enough employees to provide adequate security, education and mental health treatment for incarcerated children.\n\nDeWine praised the reporting, saying it shows there is work to be done. \"You've highlighted some very horribly tragic stories that I think anybody can relate to. It's now time for a reset, or a re-look, at DYS and the whole system.\"\n\nRead the full story.\n\nOhio juvenile judges call for funding changes after newspapers' youth prison investigation\n\nOhio juvenile court judges are calling for appropriate funding for the state's juvenile prisons and detention centers, more discretion in sentencing options and more community-based facilities to ensure safety and rehabilitation after an investigation exposed problems in the facilities.\n\nIn response to the project, the Ohio Association of Juvenile Court Judges released a joint statement on Tuesday signed by the group's president, Lorain County Judge Frank Janik.\n\nWhile the Ohio Department of Youth Services operates Ohio's three youth prisons, county judges are responsible for sending kids there and also often operate local juvenile detention centers.\n\nRead the full story.\n\nCritics say DeWine needs broader expertise for youth prison panel\n\nThe head of the union that represents prison guards panned Gov. Mike DeWine's plan to have a panel of experts examine problems within Ohio's youth prison and juvenile detention centers.\n\nChristopher Mabe, president of the Ohio Civil Service Employees Association, said he is \"appalled\" that the governor's new panel doesn't include youth prison workers.\n\n\"To keep dusting people off from ages past, I would've thought these individuals had a chance to correct these issues when they were in charge and obviously, they didn't,\" said Mabe.\n\nRead the full story.\n\nDeWine tells youth prison group to 'think big' to find solutions after investigation\n\nOhio has the money to hire and pay guards, behavioral health clinicians, teachers and others needed inside the state's youth prisons but simply cannot get people to take the jobs, according to Department of Youth Services Director Amy Ast.\n\n\"What we're covering today, I want you to know, isn't just an Ohio problem,\" Ast said during the first meeting of Gov. Mike DeWine's juvenile justice working group on Nov. 28.\n\nThe working group, headed by former Department of Youth Services director Tom Stickrath, will focus on staffing problems, violence, behavioral health services and incarcerated youth populations in prisons and local detention centers.\n\nRead the full story.\n\nOhio youth prison job vacancies persist, despite bonuses and pay bumps, director says\n\nOhio Department of Youth Services Director Amy Ast doesn't sugarcoat it: working in the state's youth prisons is a tough job.\n\nWorkers are vilified by the media and policymakers. Gangs hold power. Safety is not guaranteed. Trauma is common. And success stories go unnoticed, Ast said.\n\nThe department is offering $5,000 signing bonuses and 20% of pay retention bonuses and widely advertising openings. Still, two in five behavioral health posts, nearly one in four guard jobs and almost one in five teacher positions remain open.\n\nRead the full story.\n\nPlan to replace Ohio youth prison should be put on hold, task force says\n\nOhio should ditch plans to build a new youth prison and instead use the state money to construct smaller, closer-to-home juvenile lockup facilities, a task force created by Gov. Mike DeWine said.\n\nThe Ohio Department of Youth Services had been planning to replace the Cuyahoga Hills Juvenile Correctional Facility, which has open dorm-style housing, with a youth prison with individual cells.\n\nLegislators are now working on the next state capital budget bill, which earmarks money to be spent on big construction projects. About $118 million in state capital money has already been set aside for the prison replacement project.\n\nRead the full story.\n\nGov. Mike DeWine: Close Ohio's 3 youth prisons, build a dozen smaller facilities\n\nOhio should eventually close its three youth prisons and replace them with a dozen small, close-to-home juvenile lockups, Gov. Mike DeWine said.\n\n\"I think it's the right thing to do. It's important for safety of the juveniles, I think it's important for the safety of the staff. I think we'll be better able to deliver services to these juveniles in a smaller setting,\" DeWine told the USA TODAY Network Ohio.\n\nThis shift could take several years and require legislative action, the governor said.\n\nRead the full story.\n\nOur team\n\nReporters: Laura Bischoff, Amanda Garrett, Kevin Grasha, Amy Knapp, Cameron Knight and Jordan Laird.\n\nVisual journalists: Courtney Hergesheimer, Doral Chenoweth, Phil Didion, Ben Duer, Liz Dufour, Phil Masturzo, Mike Nyerges, Lisa Scalfaro and Carter Skaggs.\n\nEditors: Anthony Shoemaker, Cara Owsley, Dan Horn, Erin Mansfield, Jackie Borchardt and Joe Powell.\n\nDesigners: Keely Brown and Rebecca Boneschans."
