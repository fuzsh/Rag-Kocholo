        "text": "What You Need to Know\n\nAugust 2024\n\nDue to weather damage, Rome Working Solutions (DOL's Rome career center) is temporarily closed as of 7/17/24. If you have an appointment or any questions, please call the Utica Career Center at 315-793-2229. Please stay tuned for more information.\n\nSmall Business Tour: The 2024 Interagency Small Business Tour recently wrapped up after making stops in nine locations statewide. Representatives from numerous state agencies, including DOL, met with 800+ businesses, answering questions and providing critical resources on licensing, regulations, taxes, grants, training, and more. Be sure to check out our tour page for links to all of these critical resources.\n\nNew Breast Milk Expression Law: As of June 19, businesses are required to provide 30 minutes of paid break time for employees to express breast milk. This mandate applies whenever employees have a reasonable need to express breast milk and extends up to three years following childbirth. Comprehensive information about employee rights and employer requirements on this topic are available on our dedicated resource page.\n\nYouth Workers Bill of Rights: In an effort to bolster protections for New York’s youngest workers, the DOL developed the Youth Workers Bill of Rights. Written in clear and accessible language, the resource seeks to educate first time workers as they prepare to enter the labor market by explaining the rights all NY workers enjoy as well as the protections that are specific to workers under 18. The Bill of Rights will be distributed to every young worker upon receiving their working papers. It is also available as a pocket guide and downloadable poster.\n\nEnsuring Equality in the Workplace\n\nOffice of Diversity, Equity, Inclusion & Access\n\nThe New York State Department of Labor (DOL) is committed to diversity, inclusion, and equal opportunity for the customers we serve and for our own staff. We recognize that each New Yorker who comes through our doors —whether brick and mortar or virtual—has different circumstances and we believe in accessibility to assure they have a clear pathway to learn about and utilize whatever services they need. We use data to help inform and drive outcomes to move the needle on DEI in NY. And, we work to create an environment where our own employees are empowered and diversity can thrive."
