        "text": "Dyslexia is a specific learning difficulty which primarily affects reading and writing skills. However, it does not only affect these skills. Dyslexia is actually about information processing. Dyslexic people may have difficulty processing and remembering information they see and hear, which can affect learning and the acquisition of literacy skills. Dyslexia can also impact on other areas such as organisational skills.\n\nIt is important to remember that there are positives to thinking differently. Many dyslexic people show strengths in areas such as reasoning and in visual and creative fields.\n\nDevelopment of a new definition of dyslexia\n\nAfter more than a year of research, two papers summarising the findings of a Delphi study into the definition of dyslexia have now been published in draft format on the Open Science Framework. You can access the papers here.\n\nThe Delphi dyslexia study papers are still being reviewed as part of the academic research process and it is possible that changes may be made. In light of this, the BDA is monitoring the progress of this review and will ensure that our members, stakeholders and those we aim to support have access to the latest information. We will also share further guidance from the SpLD Assessment Standards Committee (SASC) when it is published.\n\nDefinition of dyslexia\n\nThe BDA has adopted the Rose (2009) definition of dyslexia:\n\nDyslexia is a learning difficulty that primarily affects the skills involved in accurate and fluent word reading and spelling. Characteristic features of dyslexia are difficulties in phonological awareness, verbal memory and verbal processing speed. Dyslexia occurs across the range of intellectual abilities. It is best thought of as a continuum, not a distinct category, and there are no clear cut-off points. Co-occurring difficulties may be seen in aspects of language, motor co-ordination, mental calculation, concentration and personal organisation, but these are not, by themselves, markers of dyslexia. A good indication of the severity and persistence of dyslexic difficulties can be gained by examining how the individual responds or has responded to well-founded intervention.\n\nIn addition to these characteristics:\n\nThe British Dyslexia Association (BDA) acknowledges the visual and auditory processing difficulties that some individuals with dyslexia can experience, and points out that dyslexic readers can show a combination of abilities and difficulties that affect the learning process. Some also have strengths in other areas, such as design, problem solving, creative skills, interactive skills and oral skills.\n\nBDA (2010)"
