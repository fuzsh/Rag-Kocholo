        "text": "The beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic in early 2020 challenged youth confinement facilities in the United States to quickly integrate public health response plans into practice to protect youth and personnel from widespread infection and negative health consequences (1,2). The Colorado Department of Human Services (CDHS) and Department of Public Health and Environment in the United States recognized the need to partner closely at the outset of the COVID-19 pandemic. The Colorado Division of Youth Services (DYS) within CDHS operates 15 youth services centers that serve youths 10–20 years of age who are temporarily detained or committed to DYS legal custody by district courts statewide and have varying lengths of stay (Table 1) (3,4).\n\nThis case study is a companion to 2 other articles in this supplement: a national perspective on lessons learned from the COVID-19 response in correctional and detention facilities (5) and a case study applying COVID-19 lessons to a tuberculosis outbreak in the prison system of Washington, USA (6). Collectively, the articles address a critical knowledge gap regarding the experiences of confined persons during the pandemic. We describe a collaborative and robust response to COVID-19 in the juvenile justice system (JJS) in Colorado that was initiated to ensure adherence to public health risk mitigation strategies while also maximizing healthy development and well-being among a vulnerable youth population.\n\nMs. Tunstall is a PhD candidate in social work at Colorado State University and the director of Behavioral Health and Medical Services for the Colorado Department of Human Services, Division of Youth Services, in Denver, Colorado. Her research interests focus on violence prevention and the intersection of trauma, aggression, and trauma-responsive environments in school and juvenile justice settings."
