        "text": "Did you know that between 10-20% of students have dyslexia?\n\nThis short course has 30 videos that include essential information you need to know about dyslexia.\n\nThe videos are only 2-3 minutes long, so the information is easy to understand.\n\nThe training videos provide practical classroom strategies.\n\nEach section is followed by a short quiz to test knowledge.\n\nThe training can be done on a smartphone, tablet or computer.\n\nThe course takes about 3 hours but can be completed in bitesize chunks.\n\nA certificate is awarded when the course is completed.\n\n“That was the MOST AMAZING PD program I have ever taken! I am shocked at how much more I needed to know and how clear I now see dyslexia. I can now start figuring out what kind of dyslexia my students have and how I can differentiate better with them. THANKS so much!!”​​​​​​​\n\n- Traci Ferris, Teacher, Texas\n\n“The information provided is powerful, engaging, and pleasing to the human eye. I feel as though the students will entertained, and motivated, simultaneously. This product will fit nicely into the curriculum whether it is used as a supplemental or a stand alone initiative.”\n\n- Carla Van Elsland\n\n“I just finished watching all the modules of the Nessy Dyslexia training. I must say, I was VERY impressed. I was honestly expecting a “dry” presentation with someone talking and showing pages of charts and text. However, the cartoons were interesting, engaging and, at times, entertaining. They were all presented in easy to understand language, simple text and lists, and meaningful visuals. The connections from one module to the next was set up well.”\n\n- Kelly MacDonald\n\n“I think this would be a great training for any new hires, particularly general education teachers who may not have been given as much time with this in college.”\n\n- Olivia\n\n“It actually helped clear some things up for me that I was confused about. After watching those videos, it made me realize two students of mine may have Dyslexia.”\n\n- Rochelle\n\n“These videos are vital at primary levels when building the reading foundation and could be beneficial on a Junior school level as a reinforcement of the gaps in learning.”\n\n- Shana Keenan"
