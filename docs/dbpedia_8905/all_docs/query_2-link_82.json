        "text": "Below are descriptions of reading, writing, and spelling disorders. Although these descriptions are listed separately, individuals can experience combined deficits in more than one area. For example, deficits in word recognition and reading comprehension often co-occur as readers must not only recognize words but also make inferences about implicit situations in the text (Castles et al., 2018). Spelling impairment and difficulties expressing ideas in written form can affect both reading and writing; difficulty or progress in either spelling or word reading can influence performance in the other area. The terms “poor readers” or “garden variety readers” are sometimes used to describe readers with generalized difficulties in reading comprehension. Similarly, a person can have difficulty with the writing process as well as with generating the written product.\n\nDeficits in reading, writing, and spelling can affect one or more language domains (see below). For a detailed description of the language domains as they relate to spoken and written language, see Language In Brief.\n\nLabels for reading disorders include dyslexia, reading disability, reading disorder, specific reading disorder, and specific reading comprehension deficit. Writing disorder labels also vary, with some being dysgraphia, writing disability, writing disorder, and specific writing disorder.\n\nAreas to consider in assessing and treating written language disorders as well as differentially diagnosing within and across spoken and written language disorders are also included below. For more comprehensive lists, see the Assessment and Treatment sections of the Written Language Disorders Practice Portal page.\n\nReading: Word Recognition\n\nWord recognition deficit is sometimes referred to as dyslexia. It is characterized by difficulty with reading despite instruction and without coexisting intellectual, sensory, or neurological difficulties. A person with word recognition deficits typically has relatively intact language comprehension but may have difficulties with\n\naccurate and/or fluent word recognition and\n\npoor spelling.\n\nFocus of Assessment/Treatment\n\nAlphabet/letter knowledge\n\nPhonological awareness (rhyming, segmenting and blending, awareness of sounds and syllables in words)\n\nMorphological awareness (inflections, derivations, and compounds)\n\nSound–symbol correspondence\n\nSight word knowledge\n\nReading decoding\n\nReading fluency\n\nSpelling\n\nVocabulary\n\nReading Comprehension\n\nReading comprehension deficit is sometimes referred to as specific comprehension deficit or hyperlexia. Hyperlexia can be differentiated from precocious reading, in that individuals with hyperlexia have significant problems in listening and reading comprehension.\n\nA person with reading comprehension deficits may have difficulties with\n\nadequate or advanced word recognition skills;\n\nreading fluency; and\n\nsocial, cognitive, or linguistic skills.\n\nFocus of Assessment/Treatment\n\nPrint awareness\n\nKnowledge of basic story structure and story components\n\nVocabulary knowledge, including\n\nmultiple-meaning words,\n\nsynonyms, and\n\nantonyms\n\nMorphological awareness (inflections, derivations, and compounds)\n\nUnderstanding meaning from context\n\nFigurative language and ambiguities in text, including\n\nmultiple-meaning words and\n\nambiguous sentence structures\n\nParaphrasing and summarizing\n\nMaking inferences\n\nKnowledge of different text structures and genres\n\nUse of strategies to facilitate comprehension, including\n\nskimming,\n\nrereading, and\n\ntaking notes\n\nUsing strategies to self-monitor comprehension\n\nMay need to address spoken language difficulties\n\nDysgraphia\n\nDysgraphia may refer to either difficulty with language or spelling-based aspects of written expression. Dysgraphia can occur alone or can co-occur with dyslexia and/or other learning disabilities.\n\nThe cognitive–linguistic aspects of dysgraphia are involved in the writing process and the writing product.\n\nWriting Process Deficit\n\nWriting process deficits are problems with the cognitive–linguistic aspects of writing and may be described under the umbrella term dysgraphia.\n\nDysgraphia, as it relates to the writing process, involves difficulty\n\nplanning,\n\ndrafting,\n\nreflecting on writing,\n\nrevising,\n\nediting own writing, and\n\nwith discourse planning and organization.\n\nFocus of Assessment/Treatment\n\nUsing pictures to tell stories\n\nWriting for different purposes, including writing to\n\nentertain,\n\npersuade, and\n\ninform\n\nWriting for different audiences\n\nPlanning, including\n\nbrainstorming,\n\nuse of story maps, and\n\nwebbing\n\nDrafting, including\n\nreferring to story maps,\n\nmaking webs, and\n\nwriting planning notes\n\nUsing digital technologies (e.g., Internet) to gather information for writing\n\nRevising and editing content\n\nSpelling\n\nWriting Product Deficits\n\nWriting product deficits are sometimes described under the umbrella term dysgraphia. For more information, please visit the International Dyslexia Association’s page on Understanding Dysgraphia.\n\nDysgraphia, as it relates to the writing product, involves\n\ndifficulty organizing and adequately expressing thoughts in writing,\n\ndifficulty constructing grammatically correct sentences of varying types and difficulty using writing conventions (e.g., capitalization and punctuation),\n\nlimited written fluency,\n\nsyntactic formulation problems (complexity and correctness impacted),\n\nword choice limitations (in variety and appropriateness), and\n\nnumerous words spelled incorrectly.\n\nFocus of Assessment/Treatment\n\nPretend writing\n\nWriting letters of the alphabet\n\nPrinting first and last name\n\nLabeling pictures\n\nProducing text via handwriting and/or keyboarding\n\nCopying text\n\nWriting from dictation\n\nWriting a variety of grammatically correct sentence types\n\nJudging correctness of grammar and morphology and correcting errors\n\nWriting cohesively, including\n\nproviding detail,\n\nlinking ideas, and\n\nelaborating\n\nUsing conventions of writing correctly, including\n\ncapitalization and\n\npunctuation\n\nKnowledge of different text structures and genres\n\nSpelling\n\nDeficits in spelling are sometimes called dysorthography. Such deficits involve difficulty with encoding phonological information. Spelling difficulties can affect both reading and writing and are an area of weakness for most individuals with dyslexia. Spelling deficits include\n\ndifficulty representing the phonological structure of regularly spelled words,\n\ndifficulty remembering and reproducing the patterns of irregularly spelled words,\n\nlack of morphemic awareness in spelling, and\n\ndifficulty spelling and inflecting words correctly in sentences.\n\nFocus of Assessment/Treatment\n\nUsing letter–sound knowledge to spell words as they sound\n\nUnderstanding the phonological, morphological, and orthographic aspects of regular and irregular spellings\n\nCorrecting spelling errors\n\nSpoken and Written Language\n\nDeficits in spoken and written language can affect reading, writing, and spelling. Such deficits may be referred to as oral and written language learning disability.\n\nThese deficits involve marked difficulty with oral language and involve problems of similar severity that cross multiple systems. Deficits in spoken and writing language may result in difficulty with\n\npronouncing complex words,\n\nreading fluency,\n\nword recognition/decoding,\n\nspelling, and\n\nlanguage comprehension.\n\nFocus of Assessment/Treatment\n\nTreatment should address areas of difficulty in reading, writing, and spelling as indicated. Treatment should match the degree to which sound/word structure knowledge and sentence/discourse level knowledge are impaired across spoken and written modalities—listening, speaking, reading, and writing.\n\nLanguage Domains Primarily Affected\n\nDomain Area of Domain Phonology Morpho-syntax Semantics Pragmatics Reading Word recognition X X Reading comprehension X X X Writing Writing process X X Writing product X X X X Spelling X X X X Spoken and written language X X X X\n\nReferences\n\nCastles, A., Rastle, K., & Nation, K.
