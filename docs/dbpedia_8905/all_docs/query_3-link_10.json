        "text": "What is dyscalculia?\n\nDyscalculia is a learning disorder that affects a person’s ability to understand number-based information and math. People who have dyscalculia struggle with numbers and math because their brains don’t process math-related concepts like the brains of people without this disorder. However, their struggles don’t mean they’re less intelligent or less capable than people who don’t have dyscalculia.\n\nThe symptoms of this disorder usually appear in childhood, especially when children learn how to do basic math. However, many adults have dyscalculia and don’t know it. People who have dyscalculia often face mental health issues when they have to do math, such as anxiety, depression and other difficult feelings.\n\nThere’s also a form of dyscalculia that appears later in life. This form, acquired dyscalculia, can happen at any age. This usually happens for other reasons like a medical condition (see more about this under the Causes and Symptoms section below).\n\nAdvertisement\n\nCleveland Clinic is a non-profit academic medical center. Advertising on our site helps support our mission. We do not endorse non-Cleveland Clinic products or services. Policy\n\nWhat is the difference between dyslexia and dyscalculia?\n\nDyslexia and dyscalculia are both learning disorders, but they have key differences. In the most general terms, these two break down as follows:\n\nDyscalculia: This learning disorder affects a person’s ability to do math.\n\nDyslexia: This learning disorder affects a person’s ability to read.\n\nWhile they’re different, the two conditions fall under the same diagnosis, “Specific learning disorder,” in the American Psychiatric Association’s Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition (DSM-5). It’s also possible for people to have both dyscalculia and dyslexia.\n\nWho does dyscalculia affect?\n\nDyscalculia can happen to anyone, but it’s common for it first to draw attention when children are in their first few years of elementary school (between ages 6 and 9).\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHow common is dyscalculia?\n\nDyscalculia is uncommon but widespread. Experts estimate it affects between 3% and 7% of people worldwide.\n\nHow does dyscalculia affect my brain?\n\nPeople who have dyscalculia are neurodivergent. Neurodiversity is a term that describes how no two people have the same brain, and everyone’s brain forms and develops in a completely unique way. For people with dyscalculia, that means their brain works differently from the brain of someone who doesn’t have disorders or conditions that affect how their brain works.\n\nSolving a math problem like “2+2=?” might seem simple, but it takes several different skills — and the areas of the brain that manage them — working together to do it. Some of those include:\n\nVisual processing: Your eyes see the entirety of the math problem and send the components back to your brain for processing.\n\nShort-term memory: You use your short-term memory to hold onto the specifics of the math problem as you work on it. For example, the number amounts, the symbols and the order in which they appear.\n\nLanguage: You use this part of your brain to translate the symbols in the math problem into what those symbols mean. That’s how you know what the plus sign, equal sign and question mark mean in this context.\n\nLong-term memory: You access this kind of memory to remember the process of how to solve a math problem. In this case, your brain identifies that this is an addition problem based on the plus sign and the equals sign.\n\nUnderstanding of quantities and amounts: Your brain translates the symbol “2” into the understanding that it represents a specific amount or quantity. Children usually learn this principle by giving them examples like fruits or animals.\n\nCalculation: This process unites all of the above, helping you solve that 2+2=4.\n\nFor a neurotypical person, the above processes all work as expected. Depending on how severe their case is, people with dyscalculia may struggle with certain parts of the process.\n\nWhat are the symptoms of dyscalculia?\n\nThe symptoms of dyscalculia depend on which parts of the process a person struggles with most. It can also depend on the person’s age and the situations they encounter most often.\n\nYoung children (up to the pre-K and kindergarten levels)\n\nFor very young children, the most common symptoms include trouble with:\n\nCounting upward.\n\nConnecting a number to that many of an object (for example, connecting the number 4 to that many marbles in front of them).\n\nRecognizing numbers and math symbols.\n\nOrganizing numbers, such as largest to smallest or first to last.\n\nRecognizing and using number lines.\n\nLearning using money (such as coins or bills).\n\nSchool-age children (primary/grade/elementary school)\n\nThe symptoms of dyscalculia often draw attention when children start school around age 6. For these children, the symptoms include trouble with:\n\nCounting on fingers with small numbers (especially at an age where that seems unnecessary).\n\nIdentifying small quantities of items just by looking (this looks like needing to count each one by one).\n\nDoing simple calculations from memory.\n\nMemorizing multiplication tables.\n\nRecognizing the same math problem when the order of the numbers or symbols changes (struggling to understand that 1+7=8 is the same as 8=7+1).\n\nUnderstanding word problems or more advanced symbols (such as > meaning “greater than” or < meaning “less than”).\n\nOrganizing numbers by scale (10s, 100s, 1,000s) or decimal place (0.1, 0.01, 0.001).\n\nTeenagers (secondary school- or high school-age) and adults\n\nThe symptoms in teenagers and adults often look like trouble with the following:\n\nCounting backward.\n\nSolving word problems.\n\nBreaking down problems into multiple steps to solve them.\n\nMeasuring items.\n\nMeasuring quantities (such as for cooking/baking recipes).\n\nUsing money (coins and bills) to pay for items, exchanging bills for coins (and vice versa) and making change.\n\nUnderstanding and converting fractions.\n\nEmotional symptoms\n\nIn addition to symptoms that directly relate to someone’s ability to do math, people with dyscalculia may show emotional symptoms when faced with situations where math is necessary. Those emotional symptoms often include:\n\nAnxiety (including test anxiety) or even panic.\n\nAgitation, anger or aggression (such as temper tantrums in younger children).\n\nFear (including a fear or even phobia of going to school).\n\nPhysical symptoms of any of the above (nausea and vomiting, sweating, stomachache, etc.)\n\nWhat causes dyscalculia?\n\nIn most cases, especially in children, experts don’t know why dyscalculia happens. There’s evidence that learning disorders — including dyscalculia — may run in families. However, more research is necessary to confirm this.\n\nExperts do know that people with dyscalculia are more likely to have certain differences in some areas of their brain. These differences seem to indicate less development and fewer connections between brain cells in those areas. The affected areas are ones your brain uses when doing anything that involves numbers and calculations. However, experts don’t know why these differences happen and how they influence this disorder’s symptoms.\n\nRelated conditions\n\nDyscalculia often happens alongside other conditions. While these aren’t causes, they can be a clue to help healthcare providers recognize and diagnose dyscalculia. Conditions that often happen alongside dyscalculia include:\n\nAttention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD).\n\nDyslexia, dysgraphia or non-verbal learning disorders.\n\nSensory processing disorders.\n\nAutism spectrum disorder.\n\nPeople with dyscalculia also have a higher risk of mental health disorders. Experts don’t know if these are more likely to happen because a person has dyscalculia, but these are still important factors that healthcare providers will consider when making a diagnosis and recommending treatment.\n\nAnxiety disorder or panic disorder.\n\nBehavior disorders (such as oppositional defiant disorder or conduct disorder).\n\nBipolar disorder.\n\nDepression.\n\nAcquired dyscalculia\n\nThere are some reasons why a person would develop dyscalculia (or even acalculia, a complete inability to do math) later in life. This form, known as acquired dyscalculia, isn’t a learning disorder. Instead, it usually involves brain damage that disrupts areas related to math skills. Lesions, which are areas of brain damage, can happen for many reasons (see the Brain Lesions article to understand more about how this damage can happen).\n\nIs it contagious?\n\nDyscalculia isn’t contagious, and you can’t catch it from or spread it to others.\n\nHow is dyscalculia diagnosed?\n\nEducation professionals (usually teachers) and parents are most likely to be the first to notice the symptoms of dyscalculia. If a teacher notices it, they’ll be able to offer resources and guidance on next steps. Parents who notice dyscalculia can also talk to their child’s pediatrician to learn more about the process of diagnosing and treating dyscalculia.\n\nThere are two main criteria that the DSM-5 lists for math-related symptoms of specific learning disorder (with more about those criteria immediately below). At least one of these two criteria must exist for at least six months, even with trained, expert help to try and overcome it.\n\nDifficulties mastering number sense, number facts or calculation.\n\nDifficulties with mathematical reasoning.\n\nWhat tests will be done to diagnose dyscalculia?\n\nThere are no lab, imaging or diagnostic tests that can confirm dyscalculia. Instead, the focus will be on testing a child’s specific math-related skills and ruling out other possible causes, such as vision or hearing problems, other brain- or mental health-related conditions, etc. Different tests can help with this. A healthcare provider is the best person to explain what kind of skills tests they recommend.\n\nHow is dyscalculia treated, and is there a cure?\n\nDyscalculia is treatable in children because their brains haven’t yet finished developing, making it possible for them to learn skills and develop abilities they need to adapt to this condition. Treatment usually takes the form of one-on-one learning programs.\n\nThe programs are symptom-specific and focus on what a child struggles with most. Treatment should also start as soon as possible. The sooner the treatment starts, the better the chances for children to adapt to this condition and limit the impacts.\n\nUnfortunately, dyscalculia isn’t considered treatable in adults unless it’s acquired dyscalculia. That’s because their brains are fully developed, meaning treatments like learning programs are less likely to help them. For adults, the focus is on helping them compensate for dyscalculia using technology or other methods.\n\nFor acquired dyscalculia, there are possible treatments. The available treatments depend on many factors, especially the underlying cause of the dyscalculia. Your healthcare provider can tell you more about the treatment options and which they recommend for your case.\n\nTreatment for related conditions\n\nIn addition to learning programs for dyscalculia, children with this condition may need additional treatment for other conditions they have. The treatments for those conditions depend mostly on the condition themselves. They can include medication, psychotherapy and more. A healthcare provider is the best person to tell you more about the possible treatments, including what they recommend for the specific needs in question.\n\nWhat can I expect if I have dyscalculia?\n\nDepending on the specific symptoms, dyscalculia can make it harder to do even simple math-related tasks like paying bills, following recipes for cooking and baking, and more. With early treatment, children can often adapt to this condition and limit its impact on their lives. Adults who have it are more likely to struggle with the effects if they don’t receive treatment earlier in life. It’s also common for people with this disorder to feel embarrassed about this condition, and many experience anxiety, shame and depression because of it.\n\nHow long dyscalculia lasts\n\nDyscalculia is a lifelong condition. There’s no cure, but early treatment can help reduce the effects later in life.\n\nThe only exception to this is acquired dyscalculia, which may be a temporary condition. Whether or not it’s temporary depends on factors like why it happened and how severe it is. Your healthcare provider is the best person to tell you if acquired dyscalculia could be temporary and how long it may last.\n\nWhat’s the outlook for this condition?\n\nDyscalculia isn’t a dangerous condition. However, people who have it are more likely to struggle with mental health conditions that happen alongside it. Conditions like depression and anxiety can have greater effects — including a risk of self-harm or suicide — so treating these when necessary is essential."
