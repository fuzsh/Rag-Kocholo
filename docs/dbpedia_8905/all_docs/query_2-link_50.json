        "text": "WHAT IS EXONDYS 51 (eteplirsen)?\n\nEXONDYS 51 is used to treat Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) in patients who have a confirmed mutation in the dystrophin gene that can be treated by skipping exon 51. EXONDYS 51 was approved under accelerated approval. Accelerated approval allows for drugs to be approved based on a marker that is considered reasonably likely to predict a clinical benefit. EXONDYS 51 treatment increased the marker, dystrophin, in skeletal muscle in some patients. Verification of a clinical benefit may be needed for EXONDYS 51 to continue to be approved.\n\nSide effects that happened at least 25% more often in 8 patients treated with EXONDYS 51 by intravenous infusion than in 4 patients treated with an inactive intravenous infusion were problems with balance (38%, 0%), vomiting (38%, 0%), and skin irritation (25%, 0%). The most common side effects were problems with balance and vomiting.\n\nThe most common side effects seen in greater than 10% of patients receiving EXONDYS 51 (N=163) in other clinical trials were headache, cough, rash, and vomiting.\n\nYou are encouraged to report negative side effects of prescription drugs to the FDA. Visit www.fda.gov/medwatch or call 1-800-FDA-1088. You may also report side effects to Sarepta Therapeutics at 1-888-SAREPTA (1-888-727-3782).\n\nPlease see the full Prescribing Information for EXONDYS 51 (eteplirsen)."
