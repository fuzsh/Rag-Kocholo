        "text": "People with risk factors for fatty liver are often overweight or obese, and can have diabetes, or high levels of triglycerides/cholesterol in their blood. People with these risk factors should have their liver tests checked at least once per year. Those who are found to have elevated liver tests or possible fat in their liver on an abdominal ultrasound, or other imaging study, should be evaluated for possible fatty liver in addition to other causes of elevated liver tests. Once fat is identified in the liver, other causes of liver fat such as drinking too much alcohol, certain medications, and other liver diseases must be checked for before making a diagnosis of fatty liver.\n\nThe next step is to determine whether the patient with fatty liver has only fat within their liver (also called steatosis), where scarring of the liver is rare or metabolic dysfunction-associated steatohepatitis (MASH) with both fat and inflammation in the liver that over time can cause scarring in the liver. The most accurate way to figure this out is to perform a liver biopsy, a procedure where a small needle is inserted through the skin after numbing medicine is given to obtain a small piece of the liver for examination under a microscope. A pathologist then interprets the biopsy sample and determines whether MASH is present and, if so, whether any liver damage or scarring has taken place. There are a growing number of alternatives to liver biopsy that can also provide much of the same information without requiring needle insertion into the liver. These include measuring liver stiffness and fat content of the liver with elastography testing through the use of a specialized ultrasound (FibroscanÂ®) or MRI scan. Special blood tests or a combination of routine blood tests can also be used to evaluate for possible liver scarring in patients with MASLD. Because none of these tests are perfect, patients with fatty liver are advised to discuss the risks and benefits of these tests with their doctor to decide which tests are best in their situation. In general, it is most beneficial to do a combination of tests to see if they all point to the same degree of fat in the liver and liver scarring. If the tests point to more significant scarring in the liver, your doctor may recommend a liver biopsy.\n\nPeople with MASH or liver inflammation may have scar tissue, which causes liver tissue to stiffen up (rather than soft). Liver biopsy is not always necessary and non-invasive tests are now available to check for liver fat content and stiffness level. If the stiffness level is high, it can be either inflammation or scars or both and a liver biopsy can help to confirm how serious the condition is. If inflammation from MASH continues for years, an extensive amount of liver scar tissue can form which eventually leads to liver cirrhosis (severe scarring of the liver that can be permanent). Patients who develop cirrhosis related to MASH are at risk for two major developments: hepatocellular carcinoma (liver cancer) and/or end-stage liver disease. Developing either complication of cirrhosis significantly impacts life expectancy, but certain patients can be cured by undergoing a liver transplant if they are evaluated and found to be a good candidate. For this reason, patients with MASH cirrhosis should see a GI or liver specialist regularly who will monitor their liver function and screen them for liver cancer with periodic liver ultrasounds or other scans, in addition to monitoring for other complications."
