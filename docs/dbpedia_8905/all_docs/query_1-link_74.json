        "text": "Dyslexia is a learning difficulty that impairs a person’s ability to read and write. The exact reason dyslexia happens is unclear, though there may be a genetic link.\n\nDyslexia involves the ways that the brain processes graphic symbols and the sounds of words. It commonly affects word recognition, spelling, and the ability to match letters to sounds.\n\nWhile it is a neurological condition, dyslexia has no relation to intelligence.\n\nDyslexia is common. Some experts believe that 5–10% of people have it, while some others estimate that the prevalence is 17%.\n\nReceiving a diagnosis, guidance, and support from an early age can help reduce the impact of the condition.\n\nThis article will take a close look at dyslexia’s causes, symptoms, and management in children and adults.\n\nDyslexia affects the way that the brain processes written materials, making it more difficult to recognize, spell, and decode words.\n\nThe effects of dyslexia vary from person to person. People with the condition generally have trouble reading quickly and reading without making mistakes. They may also have trouble understanding what they read.\n\nDyslexia is a neurological issue, and it can run in families. It is not the result of poor teaching, instruction, or upbringing.\n\nWhile it can be challenging, almost everyone with dyslexia can learn to read if they receive the right instruction.\n\nThroughout early 2018, 33 legislative bills relating to dyslexia were introduced in the United States. This reflects the fact that government organizations are recognizing the need for early intervention to support children with dyslexia.\n\nPeople with dyslexia are most likely to receive a diagnosis as children or young adults.\n\nAdults who receive this diagnosis have usually had the condition their whole lives. However, a person can acquire dyslexia because of a brain injury.\n\nIf a parent, guardian, or teacher suspects that a young person has dyslexia, they should ask about a professional evaluation. The school may be able to help. An early diagnosis is more likely to lead to effective management.\n\nReceiving a dyslexia diagnosis may open the door to more support for the child or adolescent. They may become eligible for special education services, support programs, and services in colleges and universities.\n\nAccording to the International Dyslexia Association, diagnostic evaluations often cover the following areas:\n\nbackground information, including family history and early development\n\nintelligence\n\noral language skills\n\nword recognition\n\nfluency skills\n\nreading comprehension\n\nvocabulary knowledge\n\ndecoding, or the ability to read new words using letter-sound knowledge\n\nphonological processing, or how the brain processes the sounds of words\n\nDuring the assessment, the examiner will aim to rule out other conditions that can have similar symptoms. Examples include vision problems, hearing impairment, a lack of instruction, and social and economic factors.\n\nPeople can show symptoms of dyslexia at any age, but they tend to appear during childhood.\n\nDyslexia can cause challenges that involve:\n\nReaching development milestones\n\nChildren with dyslexia may learn to crawl, walk, talk, and ride a bicycle later than their peers.\n\nLearning to speak\n\nA child with dyslexia may take longer to learn to speak. They may also mispronounce words, find rhyming challenging, and appear not to distinguish between different word sounds.\n\nLearning to read\n\nThis difficulty can present as early as in preschool. A child may find it difficult to match letters to sounds, and they may have trouble recognizing the sounds in words.\n\nDyslexia symptoms can also arise when young people start learning more complex skills. For example, the condition can cause difficulty with:\n\ngrammar\n\nreading comprehension\n\nreading fluency\n\nsentence structure\n\nin-depth writing\n\nCaregivers and teachers may notice that a child is reluctant to read — they may avoid situations that require it.\n\nLearning to write\n\nOn paper, a person with dyslexia may reverse numbers and letters without realizing it.\n\nAlso, some children with dyslexia do not follow expected patterns of learning progression. For example, they may learn to spell a word and completely forget the next day.\n\nProcessing sounds\n\nIf a word has more than two syllables, processing the sounds can become much more challenging. For example, in the word “unfortunately,” a person with dyslexia may be able to process the sounds “un” and “ly,” but not those in between.\n\nSets of data\n\nChildren with dyslexia may take longer to learn the letters of the alphabet and how to pronounce them. They may also have trouble remembering the days of the week, months of the year, colors, and some arithmetic tables.\n\nCoordination\n\nA person with dyslexia may be less coordinated than their peers. For example, catching a ball may be difficult, and they may confuse left and right.\n\nReduced hand-eye coordination can also be a symptom of other, similar neurological conditions, including dyspraxia.\n\nConcentration\n\nPeople with dyslexia often find it hard to concentrate. This may be because, after a few minutes of struggling to read or write, they feel mentally exhausted.\n\nAlso, compared with the general population, a higher number of children with dyslexia also have attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD).\n\nAccording to some estimates, 30% of those with dyslexia also have ADHD, compared with 3–5% of the general school population experiencing both conditions.\n\nThe sequence of ideas\n\nA person with dyslexia may express ideas in a sequence that, to their peers, seems illogical or unconnected.\n\nAutoimmune conditions\n\nPeople with dyslexia are more likely to develop autoimmune conditions, such as seasonal allergies, asthma, and eczema.\n\nThere is no cure for dyslexia, but a range of approaches can help make daily tasks much easier.\n\nDyslexia affects each person differently, and most people find ways to accommodate their learning differences and thrive.\n\nReceiving a diagnosis and support early in life can have long-term benefits. Managing dyslexia in children may involve:\n\nAn evaluation of individual needs: This helps teachers develop a targeted program for the child.\n\nAdapted learning tools: Children with dyslexia may benefit from learning tools that tap into their senses, such as touch, vision, and hearing.\n\nGuidance and support: Counseling can help minimize any effects on self-esteem. Other forms of support may involve, for example, granting extra time on exams.\n\nOngoing evaluation: Adults with dyslexia may benefit from help with developing evolving coping strategies and identifying areas in which they would benefit from more support.\n\nIt can also help to adapt any working or learning space. Find some homework station ideas here.\n\nThe Yale Center for Dyslexia and Creativity offers tips for studying with dyslexia. They include:\n\nemploying time management strategies such as breaking up projects into smaller pieces and drafting an outline before starting a task\n\nusing tools such as flash cards and text-to-voice technology\n\norganizing notes visually, using highlighters or a color-coding system\n\nworking in a quiet, clear space — with earplugs or noise-canceling headphones if necessary — and keeping distractions to a minimum\n\nResearchers are unsure why some people develop dyslexia.\n\nThere appears to be a genetic link, because dyslexia runs in families. Some researchers have associated changes in the DCDC2 gene with reading problems and dyslexia.\n\nWhile the vast majority of people with dyslexia have it from birth, it is possible to acquire it, usually due to a brain injury or stroke.\n\nA person’s native language can influence their experience of the condition. It may, for example, be easier for a person with mild-to-moderate dyslexia to learn a language with clear connections between the written form and its sounds and with consistent grammar rules — such as Italian or Spanish.\n\nLanguages with words that have unclear connections between the written forms and their sounds — such as “cough” and “dough” in English — can be more challenging for a person with dyslexia.\n\nThere are currently no official diagnostic “types” of dyslexia, though researchers are looking into the groups of symptoms that some people experience.\n\nOverall, identifying an individual’s specific challenges can help them get the right support. Some people experience:\n\nPhonological dyslexia: Also known as dysphonetic or auditory dyslexia, this involves having difficulty breaking down words into smaller units, making it hard to match sounds with their written form.\n\nSurface dyslexia: Also called dyseidetic or visual dyslexia, this involves having trouble recognizing words by sight, making words hard to learn and remember.\n\nRapid naming deficit: This involves having trouble naming a letter or number when the person sees it.\n\nDouble deficit dyslexia: This involves having difficulty isolating the sounds to name letters and numbers.\n\nSometimes people also refer to “directional dyslexia,” meaning that they have difficulty telling left from right. This is a common feature of the condition.\n\nIf a person has difficulty with numbers and math, specifically, the medical term for this dyscalculia. It sometimes occurs with dyslexia or independently.\n\nDyslexia is a learning difference that creates challenges to reading and writing.\n\nThough there is no cure for dyslexia, many approaches and tools can help facilitate everyday activities.\n\nEveryone with dyslexia experiences the condition differently, but with the right support, people with the condition can excel like people without it.
