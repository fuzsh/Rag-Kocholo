        "text": "Introduction\n\nThere are many terms used daily by dentists and their staff in the course of delivering care to patients, maintaining patient records and preparing claims. Many terms are familiar, especially to experienced individuals. New dentists and staff, however, may not be as familiar – and over time new terms come into use and old terms are revised for clarity.\n\nGlossary – Clinical Terms\n\n(Words and terms in bold are defined within this glossary. Click a letter to jump to that section.)\n\nGo to: Administrative Terms\n\nA | B | C | D | E | F | G | H | I | J | K | L | M | N | O | P | Q | R | S | T | U | V | W | X | Y | Z\n\nGlossary Part 1 defines clinical terms often encountered when selecting the appropriate CDT Code for patient record-keeping and claim preparation. These terms are often found in (1) nomenclatures and descriptors and (2) treatment plans and patient records. The ADA acknowledges that glossaries developed by other dental organizations may differ (e.g., technical content), and are considered complimentary to this glossary’s focus.\n\nA\n\nabscess: Acute or chronic localized inflammation, probably with a collection of pus, associated with tissue destruction and, frequently, swelling; usually secondary to infection.\n\nacute periradicular or acute apical abscess–An inflammatory reaction to pulpal infection and necrosis characterized by rapid onset, spontaneous pain, tenderness of the tooth to pressure, pus formation and eventual swelling of associated tissues. May also be known as acute periapical abscess, acute alveolar abscess, dentoalveolar abscess, phoenix abscess, recrudescent abscess, secondary apical abscess.\n\nchronic periradicular or chronic periapical abscess–An inflammatory reaction to pulpal infection and necrosis characterized by gradual onset, little or no discomfort and the intermittent discharge of pus through an associated sinus tract. May also be known as chronic alveolar abscess, chronic apical abscess, chronic dentoalveolar abscess, suppurative apical periodontitis, suppurative periradiucular periodontitis.\n\nabutment: A term with different meanings depending on the clinical scenario.\n\nimplant case – the fixture that is placed between the implant body (aka implant post) and the restorative prosthesis (e.g., single crown; denture).\n\nnatural tooth case – the tooth used as the support for one end of a denture.\n\nabutment crown: Artificial crown also serving for the retention or support of a dental prosthesis.\n\naccession: Addition of a test specimen, previously collected by a health care provider, to a laboratory specimen collection; recording of essential specimen identification data in a laboratory-maintained file in chronological order of laboratory specimen acquisition; assignment to the specimen of an identification code.\n\nacid etching: Use of an acidic chemical substance to prepare the tooth enamel and or dentin surface to provide retention for bonding.\n\nadhesion: State in which two surfaces are held together by chemical or physical forces or both with or without the aid of an adhesive. Adhesion is one aspect of bonding.\n\nadhesive: Any substance that joins or creates close adherence of two or more surfaces. Intermediate material that causes two materials to adhere to each other.\n\nadjunctive: A secondary treatment in addition to the primary therapy.\n\nadult dentition: See definition of permanent dentition.\n\nallogenic: Belonging to the same species, but genetically different.

Delivery of an anesthesia inducing agent by a dentist or other health care practitioner is regulated by state dental boards. ADA anesthesia policy and guidelines are available online (www.ADA.org). Please refer to these sources for complete and current information.\n\nThe following terms concerning methods of anxiety and pain control are found in CDT code nomenclatures and descriptors:\n\nanalgesia–the diminution or elimination of pain.\n\nanxiolysis–the diminution or elimination of anxiety.\n\ndeep sedation–a drug-induced depression of consciousness during which patients cannot be easily aroused but respond purposefully following repeated or painful stimulation. The ability to independently maintain ventilatory function may be impaired. Patients may require assistance in maintaining a patent airway, and spontaneous ventilation may be inadequate. Cardiovascular function is usually maintained.\n\ngeneral anesthesia–a drug-induced loss of consciousness during which patients are not arousable, even by painful stimulation. The ability to independently maintain ventilatory function is often impaired. Patients often require assistance in maintaining a patent airway, and positive pressure ventilation may be required because of depressed spontaneous ventilation or drug-induced depression of neuromuscular function. Cardiovascular function may be impaired.\n\ninhalation–a technique of administration in which a gaseous or volatile agent is introduced into the lungs and whose primary effect is due to absorption through the gas/blood interface.\n\nintravenous–a technique of administration in which the anesthetic agent is introduced directly into the patient’s venous system.\n\nlocal anesthesia–the elimination of sensation, especially pain, in one part of the body by the topical application or regional injection of a drug.\n\nminimal sedation–a minimally depressed level of consciousness, produced by a pharmacological method, that retains the patient's ability to independently and continuously maintain an airway and respond normally to tactile stimulation and verbal command. Although cognitive function and coordination may be modestly impaired, ventilatory and cardiovascular functions are unaffected.\n\nmoderate sedation–a drug-induced depression of consciousness during which patients respond purposefully to verbal commands, either alone or accompanied by light tactile stimulation. No interventions are required to maintain a patent airway, and spontaneous ventilation is adequate. Cardiovascular function is usually maintained.\n\nnon-intravenous–a technique of administration in which the anesthetic agent is not introduced directly into the patient’s venous system.\n\nregional block anesthesia–a form of local anesthesia that induces numbness in areas of the mouth and face.\n\ntrigeminal division block anesthesia–a form of local anesthesia that is an injection of medication that helps relieve facial pain.\n\nRoutes of Administration\n\nenteral–any technique of administration in which the agent is absorbed through the gastrointestinal (GI) tract or oral mucosa (i.e., oral, rectal, sublingual).\n\ninhalation–a technique of administration in which a gaseous or volatile agent is introduced into the lungs and whose primary effect is due to absorption through the gas/blood interface.\n\nparenteral–a technique of administration in which the drug bypasses the gastrointestinal (GI) tract (i.e., intramuscular [IM], intravenous [IV], intranasal [IN], submucosal [SM], subcutaneous [SC], intraosseous [IO].)\n\ntransdermal–a technique of administration in which the drug is administered by patch or iontophoresis through skin.\n\ntransmucosal–a technique of administration in which the drug is administered across mucosa such as intranasal, sublingual or rectal.\n\nanomaly: deviation from the normal anatomic structure, growth, development or function; an abnormality.\n\nANSI/ADA/ISO Tooth Numbering System: See Specification No. 3950.\n\nanterior: Mandibular and maxillary centrals, laterals and cuspids.
