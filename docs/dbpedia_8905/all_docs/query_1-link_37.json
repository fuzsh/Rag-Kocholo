        "text": "Dyslexia is an unexpected difficulty in reading for an individual who has the intelligence to be a much better reader. It is most commonly due to a difficulty in phonological processing (the appreciation of the individual sounds of spoken language), which affects the ability of an individual to speak, read, spell and, often, learn a second language.\n\nSome of the brightest children struggle to read. Dyslexia occurs at all levels of intelligence—average, above average and highly gifted. Many gifted people at the top of their fields are dyslexic. While people with dyslexia are slow readers, they often are very fast and creative thinkers.\n\nMost children and adults with dyslexia can learn to read—but with more effort than their peers. The typical child can learn to read “fluently,” meaning that reading is automatic, fast and pleasurable. By contrast, many dyslexic children remain “manual” readers who read slowly and with great effort.\n\nThis is unfortunately a myth that seems to have nine lives. Many young children reverse letters when learning to write, regardless of whether or not they have dyslexia. In fact, most children with dyslexia do not reverse letters. Click here to learn the signs of dyslexia.\n\nA 1990 study in the Journal of the American Medical Association by Drs. Sally and Bennett Shaywitz found that dyslexia affects comparable numbers of boys and girls. More boys are referred by their teachers for evaluation, but this appears to reflect the more rambunctious behavior of boys in the classroom.\n\nMany dyslexic students perform very well in school. These students are usually highly motivated and work extremely hard. In many cases they have been identified early and have received evidence-based interventions and accommodations, such as extra time on tests, which allows them to demonstrate their knowledge. Dyslexic students have completed rigorous programs at highly selective colleges, graduate and professional schools.\n\nSince reading is based on spoken language, clues can appear before a child starts school. As discussed in detail in Overcoming Dyslexia by Dr. Sally Shaywitz and partially excerpted in “Recognizing the Signs of Dyslexia,” children with dyslexia often have slightly delayed speech and don’t recognize rhyming words. A family history of dyslexia may also be present. Tests for dyslexia can be performed early on so children can start school with the help they need to reach their potential, and parents can know what accommodations are necessary. The Shaywitz DyslexiaScreen™ for the first time enables schools nationwide and internationally to quickly and reliably screen all kindergarten and first grade students for dyslexia, allowing early support and intervention.\n\nMany excellent tools and strategies help children with dyslexia learn to read and perform to their full potential in school. These include evidenced-based reading programs and accommodations, such as extra time on tests. For more information on accommodations click here. Of course, the most important steps are screening the child for dyslexia and identifying him or her as having a diagnosis of dyslexia.\n\nMost critically, students need to be diagnosed correctly and understand the implications of their diagnosis—especially that they are bright and can have a fulfilling future. In addition, such students benefit from and typically require extra time on tests, taking tests in a quiet space, using text-to-speech technology and taking notes on a laptop. For more information on accommodations click here.\n\nIf the student qualifies for an IEP (Individualized Education Program) under the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA), and the IEP recommends accommodations, then the school must provide them. If the student does not qualify for an IEP, he or she may still be eligible for accommodations under Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973.
