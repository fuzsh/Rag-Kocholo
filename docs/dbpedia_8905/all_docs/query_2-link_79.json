        "text": "Welcome!\n\nBACDYS (Bangladeshi American Community Development and Youth Services) was founded in 2009 by Misba Abdin and became the lead nonprofit organization in the City Line of East Brooklyn, New York. Our mission is to give low-income youth and adults in New York City the skills, confidence and knowledge they need to change their lives for the better, focusing on affordable housing, education, youth programs and entertainment.\n\nJOIN US\n\nCommunity Garden\n\n\"Happy To Grow\" Project\n\nWith the help of our supporters and an excellent team of volunteers, BACDYS has transformed an abandoned Department of Transportation (DOT) plot into a beautiful community garden as recreational space. The community garden aims to encourage healthy food consumption to the residents of East New York. Organic vegetables are grown in the garden and distributed to the residents by the senior volunteers. As part of the youth environment education, they participate in planting and growing vegetables.\n\nOur Annual Multicultural Festival\n\nOur annual multicultural festival is a free community festival held each February in Canberra. The festival aims to bring families from diverse backgrounds together to learn and celebrate their rich cultures. This festival is sponsored by the ACT Government and is administered by the Community Participation Group Multicultural Affairs, which is a division of the ACT Government Community Services Directorate.\n\nOur ESL Graduates\n\nOne of our main goals is to empower women to be independent and help themselves in their daily tasks. To do this, we provide free ESL classes that are open to the public. By attending these classes, students learn to speak, to write, and to read English more effectively.\n\nYouth Leadership & Afterschool\n\nImproving youth leadership through capacity development and helping to prevent them from the risk of gangs or drugs. This has increased the adjustment of immigrant children at schools due to better social skills, improved grades, etc."
