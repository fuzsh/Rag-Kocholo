        "text": "Students are at the heart of our work\n\nFounded in 1974, we are a Massachusetts educational collaborative governed by representatives from our 37-member school districts in Hampshire and Franklin Counties. We work with children, youth, and adult learners; families; schools, districts, and educators; and community members in the Pioneer Valley and across Massachusetts to create and improve educational opportunities both in and out of the classroom and ensure that every child has the opportunity to achieve their full potential. We are a community of innovative and effective professionals dedicated to improving education.\n\nOur Mission\n\nThe mission of the Collaborative for Educational Services is to develop and foster lifelong learning and to provide opportunities for wellbeing for all of the communities we work with, through collaboration and leadership.\n\nOur Vision\n\nWe envision a society with equitable communities, led by the people within them. We envision a learning system within and deeply connected to those communities, which centers the histories and cultural identities of Black, Indigenous, People of color, and other marginalized groups, and supports all children and young people to discover their gifts and move boldly towards their futures.\n\nSocial Justice and Equity is critical to our mission, reflected in our organization’s Values\n\nA Culture of Community and Care: We will look out for and support each other, celebrate each other’s successes and grieve each other’s losses. We will live out an ethic of community care, learn from mistakes, and be challenged to do better. We will foster speech and discourse, formal and informal, that promotes equity, justice, and understanding.\n\nEquity and Inclusion: We will work to eliminate racism and other injustice and oppression, and promote inclusion and equity at CES and in our community by identifying and dismantling all forms of social oppression. Our vision of social justice is intersectional and means working to transform all types of oppression, including racism, ableism, sexism, heterosexism, classism, adultism, ageism, transgender oppression, and religious oppression.\n\nSelf-awareness and Growth: We will continually reflect on our own cultures and identities, and how they relate to or allocate power and privilege; and we will learn about and partner with others to challenge our own biases. We will make a personal commitment to growth toward equity, inclusion, and a community of care; and know that learning happens when we commit to being brave.\n\nAction and Transformation: We will take action, speak up, and propose solutions when we see oppression or discrimination; knowing that saying nothing means colluding with oppression. We strive to decolonize teaching practices, learning methods, and curricula through the accurate inclusion of the voices of people and cultures most impacted by white-supremacist narratives. We will be willing to make mistakes, and learn from both our mistakes and successes, in order to grow."
