        "text": "First & Last Day of Travel\n\nOn the day of departure from the permanent duty station and on the day of return, a traveler receives 75 percent of the applicable M&IE rate regardless of departure or return time. Exemptions or waivers to this rule are not permitted.\n\nThe M&IE rate for the day of departure from the permanent duty station is the locality rate at the temporary duty location. The M&IE rate for the day of return to the permanent duty station is the M&IE rate at the last temporary duty location.\n\nThe 75 percent rule also applies to the day of departure from a previous permanent duty station and the day of arrival to a new permanent duty station in certain instances, depending on whether the traveler is a civilian employee or a Service member. See JTR Section 0503 for more information on per diem for Service members, and Section 0539 for more information on per diem for civilian employees.\n\nThe Government meal rate or proportional meal rate does not apply on the first and last days of travel.\n\nStopovers\n\nIf a traveler has a stopover when traveling to or returning from the temporary duty location, the traveler receives the M&IE rate for the stopover point. If return travel to the permanent duty station requires more than one day, and additional stopovers are required, per diem for the last day of travel is based on the M&IE rate at the last stopover location."
