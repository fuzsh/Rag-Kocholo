        "text": "Last Days of Life (PDQ®)–Health Professional Version\n\nOverview\n\nDespite progress in developing treatments that have improved life expectancies for patients with advanced-stage cancer, the American Cancer Society estimates that 611,720 Americans will die of cancer in 2024.[1] People with cancer die under various circumstances. A report of the Dartmouth Atlas Project analyzed Medicare data from 2007 to 2010 for cancer patients older than 65 years who died within 1 year of diagnosis.[2] Across the United States, 25% of patients died in a hospital, with 62% hospitalized at least once in the last month of life. In addition, 29% of patients were admitted to an intensive care unit in the last month of life. Approximately 6% of patients nationwide received chemotherapy in the last month of life. Conversely, about 61% of patients who died used hospice service. However, the average length of stay in hospice was only 9.1 days, and 11% of patients were enrolled in the last 3 days of life. Significant regional variations in the descriptors of end-of-life (EOL) care remain unexplained.\n\nPatient and family preferences may contribute to the observed patterns of care at the EOL. Patient recall of EOL discussions, spiritual care, or early palliative care, however, are associated with less-aggressive EOL treatment and/or increased utilization of hospice.[3-7] In addition, death in a hospital has been associated with poorer quality of life and increased risk of psychiatric illness among bereaved caregivers.[8] Thus, it is important to help patients and their families articulate their goals of care and preferences near the EOL. For more information, see Planning the Transition to End-of-Life Care in Advanced Cancer.\n\nThis summary provides clinicians with information about anticipating the EOL; the common symptoms patients experience as life ends, including in the final hours to days; and treatment or care considerations. The decisions commonly made by patients, families, and clinicians are also highlighted, with suggested approaches. The goal of this summary is to provide essential information for high-quality EOL care.\n\nIn this summary, unless otherwise stated, evidence and practice issues as they relate to adults are discussed. The evidence and application to practice related to children may differ significantly from information related to adults. When specific information about the care of children is available, it is summarized under its own heading.\n\nReferences\n\nAmerican Cancer Society: Cancer Facts and Figures 2024.

[PUBMED Abstract]\n\nAnticipating the End of Life\n\nThe Final Days to Weeks of Life\n\nProviding excellent care toward the end of life (EOL) requires an ability to anticipate when to focus mainly on palliation of symptoms and quality of life instead of disease treatment.[1] Prognostic information plays an important role for making treatment decisions and planning for the EOL. However, the available literature suggests that medical providers inaccurately predict how long patients will live and tend to overestimate survival times.[2,3] This appears to hold true even for providers who are experienced in treating patients who are terminally ill. In a multicenter cohort study of 230 hospitalized patients with advanced cancer, palliative care providers correctly predicted time to death for only 41% of patients. Survival time was overestimated in 85% of patients for whom medical providers gave inaccurate predictions, and providers were particularly likely to overestimate survival for Black and Latino patients.[4]\n\nProviders attempting to make prognostic determinations may attend to symptoms that may herald the EOL, or they may observe trends in patients’ functional status. For more information, see the Impending Death section.\n\nFor example, one group of investigators [5] retrospectively analyzed nearly 71,000 Palliative Performance Scale (PPS) scores obtained from a cohort of 11,374 adult outpatients with cancer who were assessed by physicians or nurses at the time of clinic visits. The PPS is an 11-point scale describing a patient’s level of ambulation, level of activity, evidence of disease, ability to perform self-care, nutritional intake, and level of consciousness.\n\nThe investigators assigned patients to one of four states:\n\nStable (PPS score, 70–100).\n\nTransitional (PPS score, 40–60).\n\nEOL (PPS score, 10–30).\n\nDead.\n\nOf the 4,806 patients who died during the study period, 49% were recorded as being in the transitional state, and 46% were recorded as being in the stable state. For a patient who was in the transitional state, the probability of dying within a month was 24.1%, which was less than that for a patient in the EOL state (73.5%). The results suggest that serial measurement of the PPS may aid patients and clinicians in identifying the approach of the EOL.\n\nIn contrast to the data indicating that clinicians are relatively poor independent prognosticators, a study published in 2019 compared the relative accuracies of the PPS, the Palliative Prognostic Index, and the Palliative Prognostic Score with clinicians' predictions of survival for patients with advanced cancer who were admitted to an inpatient palliative care unit. At study enrollment, the investigators calculated the scores from the three prognostication tools for 204 patients and asked the unit’s palliative care attending physician to estimate each patient’s life expectancy (0–14 days, 15–42 days, or over 42 days). Reasons for admission included pain (90.7%), bowel obstruction (48.0%), delirium (36.3%), dyspnea (34.8%), weakness (27.9%), and nausea (23.5%).[6]\n\nThe study found that all four prognostic measures had similar levels of accuracy, except for clinician predictions of survival, which were more accurate for 7-day survival. The authors hypothesized that clinician predictions of survival may be comparable or superior to prognostication tools for patients with shorter prognoses (days to weeks of survival) and may become less accurate for patients who live for months or longer.[6] However, clinician predictions of survival may have been unusually accurate in this study because of the evaluators’ subspecialty experience in palliative care and the more predictable environment and patient population of an acute palliative care unit.\n\nImpending Death\n\nImpending death, or actively dying, refers to the process in which patients who are expected to die within 3 days exhibit a constellation of symptoms.[7] In the final days of life, patients often experience progressive decline in their neurocognitive, cardiovascular, respiratory, gastrointestinal, genitourinary, and muscular function, which is characteristic of the dying process. A number of highly specific clinical signs can be used to help clinicians establish the diagnosis of impending death (i.e., death within days).[8,9]\n\nImpending death is a diagnostic issue rather than a prognostic phenomenon because it is an irreversible physiological process. The ability to diagnose impending death with confidence is of utmost importance to clinicians because it could affect their communication with patients and families and inform complex health care decisions such as:[10,11]\n\nHospital discharge.\n\nDiscontinuation of prescription medications.\n\nArtificial nutrition.\n\nUse of life support measures.\n\nEnrollment on clinical care pathways.\n\nBecause clinicians often overestimate survival,[2,3] they often hesitate to diagnose impending death without adequate supporting evidence.\n\nOne study examined five signs in cancer patients recognized as actively dying. Investigators reported that the median time to death from the onset of death rattle was 23 hours; from the onset of respiration with mandibular movement, 2.5 hours; from the onset of cyanosis in extremities, 1 hour; and from the onset of pulselessness on the radial artery, 2.6 hours.[12]\n\nThe Investigating the Process of Dying study systematically examined physical signs in 357 consecutive cancer patients.[9] Among the ten target physical signs, there were three early signs and seven late signs. The early signs had high frequency, occurred more than 1 week before death, and had moderate predictive value that a patient would die in 3 days. Early signs included the following:\n\nDecreased level of consciousness (Richmond Agitation-Sedation Scale score of –2 or lower).\n\nDecreased performance status (PPS score ≤20%).\n\nDysphagia of liquids.\n\nThe late signs occurred mostly in the last 3 days of life, had lower frequency, and were highly specific for impending death in 3 days. Late signs included the following:[9]\n\nPulselessness on the radial artery.\n\nRespiration with mandibular movement.\n\nDecreased urine output.\n\nCheyne-Stokes breathing.\n\nDeath rattle.\n\nApnea periods.\n\nPeripheral cyanosis.\n\nIn particular, the high positive likelihood ratios (LRs) of pulselessness on the radial artery (positive LR, 15.6), respiration with mandibular movement (positive LR, 10), decreased urine output (≤200 cc/d) (positive LR, 15.2), Cheyne-Stokes breathing (positive LR, 12.4), and death rattle (positive LR, 9) suggest that these physical signs can be useful for the diagnosis of impending death.[9] Because of low sensitivity, the absence of these signs cannot rule out impending death. A prospective observational study that examined vital signs in the last 7 days of life reported that blood pressure and oxygen saturation decreased as death approached. However, a large proportion of patients had normal vital signs, even in the last 12 hours of life. Moderate changes in vital signs from baseline could not definitively rule in or rule out impending death in 3 days. Therefore, predicting death is difficult, even with careful and repeated observations.[13]\n\nSeveral other late signs that have been found to be useful for the diagnosis of impending death include the following:[14]\n\nNonreactive pupils (positive LR, 16.7; 95% confidence interval [CI], 14.9–18.6).\n\nDecreased response to verbal stimuli (positive LR, 8.3; 95% CI, 7.7–9).\n\nDecreased response to visual stimuli (positive LR, 6.7; 95% CI, 6.3–7.1).\n\nInability to close eyelids (positive LR, 13.6; 95% CI, 11.7–15.5).\n\nDrooping of the nasolabial fold (positive LR, 8.3; 95% CI, 7.7–8.9).\n\nHyperextension of the neck (positive LR, 7.3; 95% CI, 6.7–8).\n\nGrunting of vocal cords (positive LR, 11.8; 95% CI, 10.3–13.4).\n\nUpper gastrointestinal bleeding (positive LR, 10.3; 95% CI, 9.5–11.1).\n\nIn conclusion, bedside physical signs may be useful in helping clinicians diagnose impending death with greater confidence, which can, in turn, assist in clinical decision making and communication with families.\n\nCare During the Final Hours of Life\n\nThe recognition of impending death is also an opportunity to encourage family members to notify individuals close to the patient who may want an opportunity to “say goodbye.” In the final hours of life, care should be directed toward the patient and the patient’s loved ones. In addition to continuing a careful and thoughtful approach to any symptoms a patient is experiencing, preparing family and friends for a patient’s death is critical. Preparations include the following:\n\nAcknowledging the symptoms that are likely to occur.\n\nArticulating a plan to respond to the symptoms.\n\nEliciting fears or concerns of family members.\n\nAssuring that respectfully allowing life to end is appropriate at this point in the patient’s life.\n\nFor more information, see the Symptoms During the Final Months, Weeks, and Days of Life section.\n\nEncouraging family members who desire to “do something” to participate in the care of the patient (e.g., moistening the mouth) may be helpful. In the final days to hours of life, patients often have limited, transitory moments of lucidity. Family members should be prepared for this and educated that this is a natural aspect of the dying process and not necessarily a result of medications being administered for symptoms or a sign that the patient is doing better than predicted. Despite their limited ability to interact, patients may be aware of the presence of others; thus, loved ones can be encouraged to speak to the patient as if he or she can hear them.\n\nEducating family members about certain signs is critical. In the final hours of life, patients often experience a decreased desire to eat or drink, as evidenced by clenched teeth or turning from offered food and fluids. This behavior may be difficult for family members to accept because of the meaning of food in our society and the inference that the patient is “starving.” Family members should be advised that forcing food or fluids can lead to aspiration. Reframing will include teaching the family to provide ice chips or a moistened oral applicator to keep a patient’s mouth and lips moist. Finally, the death rattle is particularly distressing to family members. It is important to assure family members that death rattle is a natural phenomenon and to pay careful attention to repositioning the patient and explain why tracheal suctioning is not warranted.[15] For more information, see the Death Rattle section.\n\nFor patients who die in the hospital, clinicians need to be prepared to inquire about the family’s desire for an autopsy, offering reassurance that the body will be treated with respect and that open-casket services are still possible, if desired.\n\nHealth care professionals, preferably in consultation with a chaplain or religious leader designated by the patient and/or family, need to explore with families any fears associated with the time of death and any cultural or religious rituals that may be important to them. Such rituals might include placement of the body (e.g., the head of the bed facing Mecca for an Islamic patient) or having only same-sex caregivers or family members wash the body (as practiced in many orthodox religions). When death occurs, expressions of grief by those at the bedside vary greatly, dictated in part by culture and in part by their preparation for the death. Chaplains are to be consulted as early as possible if the family accepts this assistance. Health care providers can offer to assist families in contacting loved ones and making other arrangements, including contacting a funeral home.

[PUBMED Abstract]\n\nSymptoms During the Final Months, Weeks, and Days of Life\n\nOverview\n\nThe available evidence provides some general description of frequency of symptoms in the final months to weeks of the end of life (EOL). However, when the results of published studies of symptoms experienced by patients with advanced cancer are being interpreted or compared, the following methodological issues need to be considered:[1]\n\nVariation in the instrument used to assess symptoms and/or severity of symptoms.\n\nVariation in the timing of symptom assessment and whether the assessments were repeated over time.\n\nPopulation studied in terms of specific cancers, or a less specified population of people with cancer.\n\nWhether patients were recruited in the outpatient or inpatient setting.\n\nWhether specialized palliative care services were available.\n\nResults of one of the larger and more comprehensive studies of symptoms in ambulatory patients with advanced cancer have been reported.[2] Ambulatory patients with advanced cancer were included in the study if they had completed at least one Edmonton Symptom Assessment System (ESAS) in the 6 months before death. The ESAS is a patient-completed measure of the severity of the following nine symptoms:\n\nAnxiety.\n\nLack of appetite.\n\nDepression.\n\nDrowsiness.\n\nNausea.\n\nPain.\n\nShortness of breath.\n\nTiredness.\n\nWell-being.\n\nAnalysis of the changes in the mean symptom intensity of 10,752 patients (and involving 56,759 assessments) over time revealed two patterns:[2]\n\nThe mean scores for pain, nausea, anxiety, and depression remained relatively stable over the 6 months before death.\n\nShortness of breath, drowsiness, well-being, lack of appetite, and tiredness increased in severity over time, particularly in the month before death.\n\nIn terms of symptoms closer to the EOL, a prospective study documented the symptom profile in the last week of life among 203 cancer patients who died in acute palliative care units.[3][Level of evidence: II] The proportion of patients able to communicate decreased from 80% to 39% over the last 7 days of life. ESAS anorexia, drowsiness, fatigue, poor well-being, and dyspnea increased in intensity closer to death. In contrast, ESAS depression decreased over time. Dysphagia of solids and liquids and urinary incontinence were also present in an increasing proportion of patients in the last few days of life. Less common but equally troubling symptoms that may occur in the final hours include death rattle and hemorrhage.\n\nThe following sections summarize some of the common symptoms and potential approaches to ameliorating those symptoms, based on available evidence. A final note of caution is warranted. Symptoms often cluster, and the presence of a symptom should prompt consideration of other symptoms to avoid inadvertently worsening other symptoms in the cluster. For example, a systematic review of observational studies concluded that there were four common clusters of symptoms (anxiety-depression, nausea-vomiting, nausea-appetite loss, and fatigue-dyspnea-drowsiness-pain).[4]\n\nDelirium\n\nTerminal delirium occurs before death in 50% to 90% of patients.[5] Most patients have hypoactive delirium, with a decreased level of consciousness. Agitation, hallucinations, and restlessness may occur in a small proportion of patients with hyperactive and/or mixed delirium. Delirium is associated with shorter survival and complicates symptom assessment, communication, and decision making. Furthermore, it can be extremely distressing to caregivers and health professionals.[6-8] Risk factors associated with terminal delirium include the following:[9]\n\nHypoxic encephalopathy.\n\nMetabolic factors.\n\nLack of reversible factors such as psychoactive medications and dehydration.\n\nSafety measures include protecting patients from accidents or self-injury while they are restless or agitated. The use of restraints should be minimized. Reorientation strategies are of little use during the final hours of life. Education and support for families witnessing a loved one’s delirium are warranted.\n\nThere are few randomized controlled trials on the management of delirium in patients with terminal or irreversible delirium.[10] Care of the patient with delirium can include stopping unnecessary medications, reversing metabolic abnormalities (if consistent with the goals of care), treating the symptoms of delirium, and providing a safe environment. Agents known to cause delirium include:\n\nCorticosteroids.\n\nChemotherapeutic agents.\n\nBiological response modifiers.\n\nOpioids.\n\nAntidepressants.\n\nBenzodiazepines.\n\nAnticholinergic agents.\n\nIn a small, open-label, prospective trial of 20 cancer patients who developed delirium while being treated with morphine, rotation to fentanyl reduced delirium and improved pain control in 18 patients.[11][Level of evidence: II]\n\nThe onset of effect and non-oral modes of delivery are considered when an agent is being selected to treat delirium at the EOL. Agents that can be used to manage delirium include haloperidol, 1 mg to 4 mg orally, intravenously (IV), or subcutaneously.[12] The dose is usually repeated every 4 to 6 hours but in severe cases can be administered every hour. Chlorpromazine can be used, but IV administration can lead to severe hypotension; therefore, it should be used cautiously.[13] Other agents that may be effective include olanzapine, 2.5 mg to 20 mg orally at night (available in an orally disintegrating tablet for patients who cannot swallow);[14][Level of evidence: II] quetiapine;[15] and risperidone (0.5–2 mg).[16] While no randomized clinical trial demonstrates superiority of any agent over haloperidol, small (underpowered) studies suggest that olanzapine may be comparable to haloperidol.\n\nIn addition, a small, double-blind, randomized trial at the University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center compared the relative sedating effects of scheduled haloperidol, chlorpromazine, and a combination of the two for advanced-cancer patients with agitated delirium.[17] The investigators screened 998 patients from the palliative and supportive care unit and randomly assigned 68 patients who met the inclusion criteria for having agitated delirium refractory to scheduled haloperidol 1 to 8 mg/day to three intervention groups: haloperidol 2 mg every 4 hours, chlorpromazine 25 mg every 4 hours, or haloperidol 1 mg combined with chlorpromazine 12.5 mg every 4 hours. Rescue doses equivalent to the standing dose were allowed every 1 hour as needed and once at protocol initiation, with the goal of producing sedation with a Richmond Agitation-Sedation Scale (RASS) score of 0 to –2. Dose escalations and rescue doses were allowed for persistent symptoms.\n\nOf the 68 randomized patients, 45 patients were treated and monitored until death or discharge. Patients in all three groups demonstrated clinically significant decreases in RASS scores within 30 minutes and remained sedated at 24 hours. No statistically significant difference in sedation levels was observed between the three protocols. However, the chlorpromazine group was less likely to develop breakthrough restlessness requiring rescue doses or baseline dosing increases. The most common adverse event was hypotension, which was seen in 40% of patients in the haloperidol group, 31% of those in the chlorpromazine group, and 21% of those in the combination group.[17] One patient in the combination group discontinued therapy because of akathisia. The study was limited by a small sample size and the lack of a placebo group. Although all three interventions were effective at controlling agitation, it is worth noting that they controlled agitation via significant sedation, which may not be desired by all patients and/or their families.\n\nAlthough benzodiazepines (such as lorazepam) or antidopaminergic medications could exacerbate delirium, they may be useful for the treatment of hyperactive delirium that is not controlled by other supportive measures. In intractable cases of delirium, palliative sedation may be warranted. A randomized controlled trial compared the effect of lorazepam versus placebo as an adjunctive to haloperidol on the intensity of agitation in 58 patients with delirium in a palliative care unit.[18] Patients were eligible for the study if they had a diagnosis of delirium with a history of agitation (hyperactive delirium subtype). Once enrolled, patients began a regimen of haloperidol 2 mg IV every 4 hours, with 2 mg IV hourly as needed for agitation. The RASS score was monitored every 2 hours until the score was 2 or higher. At this threshold, the patient received lorazepam 3 mg or matching placebo with one additional dose of haloperidol 2 mg. The primary outcome of RASS score reduction was measured 8 hours after administration of the study drug. Patients in the lorazepam group experienced a statistically significant reduction in RASS score (increased sedation) at 8 hours (–4.1 points for lorazepam/haloperidol vs. –2.3 points for placebo/haloperidol; mean difference, –1.9 points [95% confidence interval, –2.8 to –0.9]; P < .001). Lorazepam-treated patients also required significantly lower doses of rescue neuroleptics and, after receiving the study medication, were perceived to be in greater comfort by caregivers and nurses. No differences in mortality were noted between the treatment arms.\n\nCaution should be exercised in the use of this protocol because of the increased risk of significant sedation. The reduction in agitation is directly proportional to increased sedation to the point of patients being “minimally responsive to verbal stimulus” or conversion to hypoactive delirium during the remaining hours of life.[19] Communication with patients and surrogates to determine goal-concordant care in the setting of terminal or hyperactive delirium is imperative to ensure that sedation is an intended outcome of this protocol in which symptom reduction is the primary intention of the intervention. Intensive evaluation of RASS scores may be challenging for the bedside nurse. Finally, this study examined a single dose of lorazepam 3 mg; repeat doses were not studied and may accumulate in patients with liver and/or renal dysfunction.[18]\n\nIn dying patients, a poorly understood phenomenon that appears to be distinct from delirium is the experience of auditory and/or visual hallucinations that include loved ones who have already died (also known as EOL experience). Although patients may sometimes find these hallucinations comforting, fear of being labeled confused may prevent patients from sharing their experiences with health care professionals.[20] Family members at the bedside may find these hallucinations disconcerting and will require support and reassurance. Consultation with the patient’s or family’s religious or spiritual advisor or the hospital chaplain is often beneficial.\n\nFatigue\n\nFatigue is one of the most common symptoms at the EOL and often increases in prevalence and intensity as patients approach the final days of life.[21] Fatigue at the EOL is multidimensional, and its underlying pathophysiology is poorly understood.[22] It may be associated with drowsiness, weakness, and sleep disturbance. Scores on the Palliative Performance Scale also decrease rapidly during the last 7 days of life.[23] No clinical trials have been conducted in patients with only days of life expectancy. Methylphenidate may be useful in selected patients with weeks of life expectancy.[24] For more information, see Fatigue.\n\nDyspnea\n\nTreatment options for dyspnea, defined as difficult, painful breathing or shortness of breath, include opioids, nasal cannula oxygen, fans, raising the head of the bed, noninvasive ventilation, and adjunctive agents.\n\nOpioids\n\nOpioids are often considered the preferred first-line treatment option for dyspnea. However, the evidence supporting this standard is controversial, according to a 2016 Cochrane review that found only “low quality evidence” to support the use of opioids to treat breathlessness. The review’s authors suggest that larger, more rigorous studies are needed to conclusively determine whether opioids are effective for treating dyspnea, and whether they have an impact on quality of life for patients suffering from breathlessness.[25]\n\nNasal cannula oxygen\n\nThe routine use of nasal cannula oxygen for patients without documented hypoxemia is not supported by the available data. One group of investigators reported a double-blind randomized controlled trial comparing the severity of morning and evening breathlessness as reported by patients who received either supplemental oxygen or room air via nasal cannula.[26] No differences in the primary outcome of symptomatic relief for refractory dyspnea were found in the 239 subjects enrolled in the trial. There were no significant differences in secondary outcomes such as extreme drowsiness or nasal irritation. Potential criticisms of the study include the trial period being only 7 days and a single numerical scale perhaps inadequately reflecting the palliative benefit of oxygen.\n\nFans\n\nA small pilot trial randomly assigned 30 Chinese patients with advanced cancer with unresolved breathlessness to either usual care or fan therapy.[27] The outcome measures included a self-report measure of breathlessness, respiratory rate, and measured oxygen saturation. The measurements were performed before and after fan therapy for the intervention group. There was a significant improvement in the self-reported scores of the patients in the fan group but not in the scores of controls. There were no changes in respiratory rates or oxygen saturations in either group.\n\nRaising the head of the bed\n\nBecause dyspnea may be related to position-dependent changes in ventilation and perfusion, it may be worthwhile to try to determine whether a change in the patient’s positioning in bed alleviates air hunger.\n\nNoninvasive ventilation\n\nA randomized trial compared noninvasive ventilation (with tight-fitting masks and positive pressure) with supplemental oxygen in a group of advanced-cancer patients in respiratory failure who had chosen to forgo all life support and were receiving palliative care.[28] Patients had to have significant oxygen needs as measured by the ratio of the inhaled oxygen to the measured partial pressure of oxygen in the blood. Two hundred patients were randomly assigned to treatment. Patients in the noninvasive-ventilation group reported more-rapid improvement in dyspnea and used less palliative morphine in the 48 hours after enrollment. Eleven patients in the noninvasive-ventilation group withdrew because of mask discomfort.\n\nIt should be noted that all patients were given subcutaneous morphine titrated to relief of dyspnea. Whether patients with less severe respiratory status would benefit is unknown. The generalizability of the intervention is limited by the availability of equipment for noninvasive ventilation. In addition, while noninvasive ventilation is less intrusive than endotracheal intubation, a clear understanding of the goals of the intervention and whether it will be electively discontinued should be established.\n\nAdjunctive agents\n\nBronchodilators, corticosteroids, and antibiotics may be considered in select situations, provided the use of these agents are consistent with the patient’s goals of care. Bronchodilators may help patients with evidence of bronchoconstriction on clinical examination. Their use carries a small but definite risk of anxiousness and/or tachycardia. Corticosteroids may also be of benefit but carry a risk of anxiety, insomnia, and hyperglycemia. The treatment of potential respiratory infections with antibiotics likewise calls for a consideration of side effects and risks.\n\nPain\n\nThe prevalence of pain is between 30% and 75% in the last days of life.[21,29] The assessment of pain may be complicated by delirium. Many patients fear uncontrolled pain during the final days of life, but experience suggests that most patients can obtain pain relief and that very high doses of opioids are rarely indicated.[30] Indeed, the average intensity of pain often decreases as patients approach the final days.[2]\n\nSome patients, family members, and health care professionals express concern that opioid use may hasten death. Several studies refute the fear of hastened death associated with opioid use. In several surveys of high-dose opioid use in hospice and palliative care settings, no relationship between opioid dose and survival was found.[30-33]\n\nThe principles of pain management remain similar to those for patients earlier in the disease trajectory, with opioids being the standard option. Because consciousness may diminish during this time and swallowing becomes difficult, practitioners need to anticipate alternatives to the oral route. In one study, as patients approached death, the use of intermittent subcutaneous injections and IV or subcutaneous infusions increased.[34] Both IV and subcutaneous routes are effective in delivering opioids and other agents in the inpatient or home setting. For patients who do not have a preexisting access port or catheter, intermittent or continuous subcutaneous administration provides a painless and effective route of delivery.[35] For a more complete review of parenteral administration of opioids and opioid rotation, see Cancer Pain.\n\nCough\n\nCough is a relatively common symptom in patients with advanced cancer near the EOL. In one small study, 33% of patients with advanced cancer who were enrolled in hospice and who completed the Memorial Symptom Assessment Scale reported cough as a troubling symptom.[36] This compares to a prevalence of lack of energy (68%), pain (63%), and dyspnea (60%). The treatment of troublesome coughing in patients in the final weeks to days of life is largely empiric, although diagnostic imaging or evaluation may occasionally be of value. In another study of patients with advanced cancer admitted to acute palliative care units, the prevalence of cough ranged from 10% to 30% in the last week of life.[3] However, simple investigations such as reviewing medications or eliciting a history of symptoms compatible with gastroesophageal reflux disease are warranted because some drugs (e.g., angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors) cause cough, or a prescription for antacids may provide relief. In addition, patients may have comorbid conditions that contribute to coughing. For more information about common causes of cough for which evaluation and targeted intervention may be indicated, see Cardiopulmonary Syndromes.\n\nThe cough reflex protects the lungs from noxious materials and clears excess secretions. The reflex is initiated by stimulation of peripheral cough receptors, which are transmitted to the brainstem by the vagus nerve. Activation of the central “cough center” mechanism causes a deep inspiration, followed by expiration against a closed glottis; then the glottis opens, allowing expulsion of the air.[37] The empiric approach to cough may be organized as follows:\n\nExpectorants increase bronchial fluids and reduce the viscosity of secretions, which improves the likelihood of successfully clearing the material. Guaifenesin is commonly available in over-the-counter cold or cough remedies. A reasonable dose is 200 to 400 mg every 4 to 6 hours.\n\nAntimuscarinics decrease oral secretions, which may initiate a cough reflex if the patient cannot swallow adequately. For more information, see the Death Rattle section.\n\nCentrally acting antitussives suppress the putative cough center in the brain stem. All opioids have antitussive properties. Dextromethorphan is available in over-the-counter cough suppressants. Codeine is commonly prescribed initially; if it is not effective, then patients receive a more potent opioid such as morphine. However, evidence suggests that morphine [38] or hydrocodone [39] is preferable.\n\nAs discussed in the Dyspnea section, the use of bronchodilators, corticosteroids, or inhaled steroids is limited to specific indications, given the potential risks and the lack of evidence of benefit outside of specific indications.\n\nConstipation\n\nThe prevalence of constipation ranges from 30% to 50% in the last days of life.[3,29] The use of laxatives for patients who are imminently dying may provide limited benefit. Such patients often have dysphagia and very poor oral intake. Treatment of constipation in patients with only days of expected survival is guided by symptoms. If indicated, laxatives may be given rectally (e.g., bisacodyl or enemas).\n\nDysphagia\n\nFunctional dysphagia and structural dysphagia occur in a large proportion of cancer patients in the last days of life. Specifically, patients often have trouble swallowing both liquids and solids, which is often associated with anorexia and cachexia. In one study of cancer patients, the oral route of opioid administration was continued in 62% of patients at 4 weeks before death, in 43% at 1 week before death, and in 20% at 24 hours before death.[34] The clinical implication is that essential medications may need to be administered through other routes, such as IV, subcutaneous, rectal, and transdermal. Nonessential medications are discontinued.\n\nArtificial nutrition is of no known benefit at the EOL and may increase the risk of aspiration and/or infections. Instead of tube-feeding or ordering nothing by mouth, providing a small amount of food for enjoyment may be reasonable if a patient expresses a desire to eat. For more information, see the sections on Artificial Hydration and Artificial Nutrition.\n\nDeath Rattle\n\nDeath rattle, also referred to as excessive secretions, occurs when saliva and other fluids accumulate in the oropharynx and upper airways in a patient who is too weak to clear the throat. Rattle does not appear to be distressing for the patient; however, family members may perceive death rattle as indicating the presence of untreated dyspnea. Thus, the family will benefit from learning about the nature of this symptom and that death rattle is not associated with dyspnea.\n\nRattle is an indicator of impending death, with an incidence of approximately 50% to 60% in the last days of life and a median onset of 16 to 57 hours before death.[23,40,41] Two types of rattle have been identified:[42,43]\n\nReal death rattle, or type 1, which is probably caused by salivary secretions.\n\nPseudo death rattle, or type 2, which is probably caused by deeper bronchial secretions due to infection, tumor, fluid retention, or aspiration.\n\nIn one retrospective chart review, rattle was relieved in more than 90% of patients with salivary secretions, while patients with secretions of pulmonary origin were much less likely to respond to treatment.[43]\n\nThe results of clinical trials examining various pharmacological agents for the treatment of death rattle have so far been negative.[44] A small, double-blind, randomized, controlled trial that compared scopolamine to normal saline found no statistical significance.[45] Another randomized study revealed no difference between atropine and placebo.[46] Results of other randomized controlled studies that examined octreotide,[47] glycopyrrolate,[48] and hyoscine butylbromide [49] versus scopolamine were also negative.\n\nDespite the lack of clear evidence, pharmacological therapies are used frequently in clinical practice.[50,51] Among the options described above, glycopyrrolate may be preferred because it is less likely to penetrate the central nervous system and has fewer adverse effects than other antimuscarinic agents, which can worsen delirium. Glycopyrrolate is available parenterally and in oral tablet form. Doses typically range from 1 mg to 2 mg orally or 0.1 mg to 0.2 mg IV or subcutaneously every 4 hours, or by continuous IV infusion at a rate of 0.4 mg to 1.2 mg per day. Repositioning is often helpful. Suctioning of excessive secretions may be considered for some patients, although this may elicit the gag reflex and be counterproductive.\n\nGiven the limited efficacy of pharmacological interventions for death rattle, clinicians should consider factors that can help prevent it. In one secondary analysis of an observational study of patients who were dying of abdominal malignancies, audible death rattle was correlated with the volume of IV hydration administered. Patients who received more than 500 mL of IV fluid in the week before death had a significantly higher risk of developing death rattle in the 48 hours before death than patients who received less than 500 mL of IV fluid. Along with patient wishes and concomitant symptoms, clinicians should consider limiting IV hydration in the final days before death.[52][Level of evidence: II] For more information, see the Artificial Hydration section.\n\nOpioid-Induced Neurotoxicity and Myoclonus\n\nHealth care professionals need to monitor patients for opioid-induced neurotoxicity, which can cause symptoms such as myoclonus, hallucinations, hyperalgesia, seizures, and confusion, and which may mimic terminal delirium. One retrospective study examined 390 patients with advanced cancer at the University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center who had been taking opioids for 24 hours or longer and who received palliative care consultations. The study suggested that 15% of these patients developed at least one symptom of opioid-induced neurotoxicity, the most common of which was delirium (47%).[53] When opioid-induced neurotoxicity is suspected, opioid rotation may be considered.[11]\n\nMyoclonus is defined as sudden and involuntary movements caused by focal or generalized muscle contractions. The duration of contractions is brief and may be described as shocklike. There are many potential causes of myoclonus, most of which probably stem from the metabolic derangements anticipated as life ends. Medications, particularly opioids, are another potential etiology. The reported prevalence of opioid-induced myoclonus ranges greatly, from 2.7% to 87%.[54]\n\nWhen opioids are implicated in the development of myoclonus, rotation to a different opioid is the primary treatment. In patients with rapidly impending death, the health care provider may choose to treat the myoclonus rather than make changes in opioids during the final hours. Benzodiazepines, including clonazepam, diazepam, and midazolam, have been recommended.[54-56] The anticonvulsant gabapentin has been reported to be effective in relieving opioid-induced myoclonus,[57] although other reports implicate gabapentin as a cause of myoclonus.[58,59][Level of evidence: III] In one small randomized study, hydration was found to reduce myoclonus.[60][Level of evidence: I]\n\nFever\n\nThere are no reliable data on the frequency of fever. A prospective study of 232 adults with terminal cancer admitted to a hospice and palliative care unit in Taiwan indicated that fever was uncommon and of moderate severity (mean score, 0.37 on a scale of 1–3).[61] There was no increase in fever in the 2 days immediately preceding death. In addition to considering diagnostic evaluation and therapeutic intervention, the clinician needs to carefully assess whether the patient is distressed or negatively affected by the fever.\n\nThere are no data showing that fever materially affects the quality of the experience of the dying person. While infection may cause a fever, other etiologies such as medications or the underlying cancer are to be strongly considered. While the main objective in the decision to use antimicrobials is to treat clinically suspected infections in patients who are receiving palliative or hospice care,[62-64][Level of evidence: II] subsequent information suggests that the risks of using empiric antibiotics do not appear justified by the possible benefits for people near death.[65]\n\nCatastrophic Hemorrhage\n\nHemorrhage is an uncommon (6%–14%) yet extremely distressing event, especially when it is sudden and catastrophic.[66] Patients with bone marrow failure or liver failure are susceptible to bleeding caused by lack of adequate platelets or coagulation factors; patients with advanced cancer, especially head and neck cancers, experience bleeding caused by fungating wounds or damage to vascular structures from tumor growth, surgery, or radiation. Patients may also experience gastrointestinal bleeding from ulcers, progressive tumor growth, or chemotherapy-induced mucositis.\n\nThe management of catastrophic bleeding may include identification of patients who are at risk of catastrophic bleeding and careful communication about risk and potential management strategies. However, two qualitative interview studies of clinicians whose patients experienced catastrophic bleeding at the EOL suggest that it is often impossible to anticipate bleeding and that a proactive approach may cause patients and families undue distress.[67,68] Furthermore, the lack of evidence that catastrophic bleeding can be prevented with medical interventions such as transfusions needs to be taken into account in discussions with patients about the risks of bleeding.\n\nAnother strategy is to prepare to administer anxiolytics or sedatives to patients who experience catastrophic bleeding, between the start of the bleeding and death. However, there is little evidence supporting the effectiveness of this approach;[66,68] the experience of clinicians is often that patients become unconscious before the drugs can be administered, and the focus on medications may distract from providing patients and families with reassurance that suffering is unlikely. Nevertheless, the availability of benzodiazepines for rapid sedation of patients who experience catastrophic bleeding may provide some reassurance for family caregivers. Additionally, having dark towels available to camouflage the blood can reduce distress experienced by loved ones who are present at the time of hemorrhage.\n\nAfter the death of a patient from a catastrophic hemorrhage, family members and team members are encouraged to verbalize their emotions regarding the experience, and their questions need to be answered.\n\nPalliative Sedation to Treat EOL Symptoms\n\nIn rare situations, EOL symptoms may be refractory to all of the treatments described above. In such cases, palliative sedation may be indicated, using benzodiazepines, barbiturates, or neuroleptics. Refractory dyspnea is the second most common indication for palliative sedation, after agitated delirium.[69] For more information, see the Palliative Sedation section.\n\nReferences\n\nMoens K, Higginson IJ, Harding R, et al.: Are there differences in the prevalence of palliative care-related problems in people living with advanced cancer and eight non-cancer conditions?

[PUBMED Abstract]\n\nCare Decisions in the Final Weeks, Days, and Hours of Life\n\nThe Decision to Discontinue Disease-Directed Therapies\n\nChemotherapy\n\nA significant proportion (approximately 30%) of patients with advanced cancer continue to receive chemotherapy toward the end of life (EOL), including a small number (2%–5%) who receive their last dose of chemotherapy within 14 days of death.[1-4] These numbers may be even higher in certain demographic populations. One small study of African American patients with lung cancer showed that 27% received chemotherapy within the last 30 days of life, and 17.6% did so within the last 14 days.[5][Level of evidence: III] Chemotherapy administered until the EOL is associated with significant adverse effects, resulting in prolonged hospitalization or increased likelihood of dying in an intensive care unit (ICU).[6,7] Thus, the lack of definite or meaningful improvement in survival leads many clinicians to advise patients to discontinue chemotherapy on the basis of an increasingly unfavorable ratio of benefit to risk.\n\nUltimately, the decision to initiate, continue, or forgo chemotherapy should be made collaboratively and is ideally consistent with the expected risks and benefits of treatment within the context of the patient's goals of care. However, the following reasons independent of the risks and benefits may lead a patient to prefer chemotherapy and are potentially worth exploring:\n\nPatients with cancer express a willingness to endure more complications of treatment for less benefit than do people without cancer.[8]\n\nPatients report that receiving chemotherapy facilitates living in the present, perhaps by shifting their attention away from their approaching death. However, patients want their health care providers to inquire about them personally and ask how they are doing.[9]\n\nPatients and physicians may mutually avoid discussions of options other than chemotherapy because it feels contradictory to the focus on providing treatment.[10]\n\nTargeted therapy\n\nThe era of personalized medicine has altered this risk/benefit ratio for certain patients. Genomic tumor testing is indicated for multiple tumor types. Finding actionable mutations for targeted therapy is vital for many patients with metastatic cancers.\n\nA 2021 study showed that patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) who had EGFR, ALK, or ROS1 mutations and received targeted therapy had better quality-of-life and symptom scores over time, compared with patients without targetable mutations.[11][Level of evidence: III] The study also indicated that the patients who received targeted therapy were more likely to receive cancer-directed therapy in the last 2 weeks of life and to die in the hospital. These patients were also more likely to report that they “rarely or never” discussed their prognosis with their oncologist.[11][Level of evidence: III] As the authors noted, these findings raise concerns that patients receiving targeted therapy may have poorer prognostic awareness and therefore fewer opportunities to prepare for the EOL.\n\nImmunotherapy\n\nImmune checkpoint inhibitors have revolutionized the standard of care for multiple cancers. These drugs are increasingly used in older patients and those with poorer performance status for whom traditional chemotherapy may no longer be appropriate, though they may still be associated with unwanted side effects. Predictive factors for whether any given patient will have a significant response to these newer agents are often unclear, making prognostication challenging.[12,13] This uncertainty may lead to questions about when systemic treatment should be stopped and when supportive care only and/or hospice care should begin.\n\nData on immune checkpoint inhibitor use at the EOL are limited. However, three single-institution, retrospective studies showed that immunotherapy use in the last 30 days of life was associated with lower rates of hospice enrollment, a higher risk of dying in the hospital, greater risk of financial toxicity, and minimal clinical benefits.[12,14,15] A 2023 retrospective observational study involved 57,791 patients from 150 different practices represented in the nationwide database of Flatiron Health deidentified electronic health records. The study showed that White patients were more likely than Black patients to receive immunotherapy in the last month of life (30-day adjusted odds ratio [OR] for Black vs. White patients, 0.86 [95% confidence interval [CI], 0.75 to 0.98] and 14-day adjusted OR, 0.86 [95% CI, 0.75–0.99]). Additionally, patients with commercial insurance were more likely to receive immunotherapy at EOL than patients with public insurance (30-day adjusted OR, 0.72 [95% CI, 0.57–0.90] and 14-day adjusted OR, 0.68 [95% CI, 0.48–0.96]). The authors also observed a nonsignificant association between treatment in community settings, as opposed to academic centers, and risk of receiving systemic treatments (either immunotherapy or chemotherapy) within 30 days of EOL. Because of these constellation of findings, the authors hypothesized that payment incentives, reimbursement models, and structural inequities may be at play in EOL care.[16]\n\nThe Decision to Enroll in Hospice\n\nPatients with advanced cancer who receive hospice care appear to experience better psychological adjustment, fewer burdensome symptoms, increased satisfaction, improved communication, and better deaths without hastening death.[17-20] The rate of hospice enrollment for people with cancer has increased in recent years. However, this increase is tempered by a reduction in the average length of hospice stay. Because longer hospice stays are associated with caregivers’ perceptions of improved quality of care and increased satisfaction with care, this finding is especially concerning.[21,22] For more information about hospice, including referral, disparities, barriers to utilization, and financial aspects, see Hospice.\n\nChoosing the Desired Place of Death\n\nAdult populations\n\nMany patients with advanced-stage cancer express a desire to die at home,[23] but many will die in a hospital or other facility. Patients who die at home appear to have a better quality of life than patients who die in a hospital or ICU, and their bereaved caregivers experience less difficulty adjusting.[20] Dying at home is also associated with better symptom control and preparedness for death and with caregivers’ perceptions of a higher-quality death.[24] For more information, see Hospice\n\nHowever, not all patients prefer to die at home, e.g., patients who are unmarried, non-White, and older.[25] The oncology clinician strives to facilitate a discussion about preferred place of death and a plan to overcome potential barriers to dying at the patient’s preferred site.\n\nPediatric populations\n\nApproximately one-third to one-half of pediatric patients who die of cancer die in a hospital.[26,27] Dying in an inpatient setting has been associated with more intensive and invasive interventions in the last month of life for pediatric cancer patients and adverse psychosocial outcomes for caregivers.[28] For example, parents of children who die in the hospital experience more depression, anxiety, and complicated grief than parents of children who die outside of the hospital.[29]\n\nA retrospective analysis of 321 pediatric cancer patients who died while enrolled in the palliative care service at St. Jude Children’s Research Hospital suggests that the following factors (with ORs) were associated with a higher likelihood of dying in the pediatric ICU:[30]\n\nHematologic malignancy (OR, 7.42).\n\nPalliative care involvement fewer than 30 days before death (OR, 4.7).\n\nHistory of hematopoietic stem cell transplant (OR, 4.52).\n\nHispanic ethnicity (OR, 4.02).\n\nReceipt of cancer-directed therapy in the last month of life (OR, 2.96).\n\nTotal number of admissions to the pediatric ICU (OR, 1.98).\n\nA separate retrospective analysis of 121 pediatric and young adult patients in the United Kingdom who died between 2012 and 2016 showed that 72% of patients who identified a preferred location of death achieved this wish. They included all patients who wanted to die at the hospital or under hospice care. In contrast, only 58% of patients who wished to die at home achieved this desire, which was often complicated by rapid deterioration. Treatment that focused on supportive care, rather than active chemotherapy or radiation therapy, increased the odds of achieving the patient's preferred place of death (OR, 3.19; P = .04).[31][Level of evidence: III] Pediatric care providers may want to consider the factors listed above to identify patients at higher risk of dying in an intensive inpatient setting, and to initiate early conversations about goals of care and preferred place of death.[30]\n\nReferences\n\nEarle CC, Neville BA, Landrum MB, et al.: Trends in the aggressiveness of cancer care near the end of life.

[PUBMED Abstract]\n\nForgoing Potentially Life-Sustaining Treatments\n\nA necessary goal of high-quality end-of-life (EOL) care is the alleviation of distressing symptoms that can lead to suffering. An important strategy to achieve that goal is to avoid or reduce medical interventions of limited effectiveness and high burden to the patients. There is, however, a great deal of confusion, anxiety, and miscommunication around the question of whether to utilize potentially life-sustaining treatments (LSTs) such as mechanical ventilation, total parenteral nutrition, and dialysis in the final weeks or days of life. To ensure that the best interests of the patient—as communicated by the patient, family, or surrogate decision maker—determine the decisions about LSTs, discussions can be organized around the following questions:\n\nWhat are the patient’s goals of care?\n\nHow do the potential benefits of LST contribute to achieving the goals of care, and how likely is the desired outcome?\n\nHow do the potential harms of LST detract from the patient’s goals of care, and does the likelihood of achieving the desired outcome or the value the patient assigns to the outcome justify the risk of harm?\n\nWhat considerations—other than the potential benefits and harms of LST—are relevant to the patient or surrogate decision maker?\n\nWhat other resources—e.g., palliative care, a chaplain, or a clinical ethicist—would help the patient or family with decisions about LST?\n\nEthical Perspectives\n\nMedicine is a moral enterprise. The decisions clinicians make are often highly subjective and value laden but seem less so because, equally often, there is a shared sense of benefit, harm, and what is most highly valued. Occasionally, disagreements arise or a provider is uncertain about what is ethically permissible. For example, an oncologist may favor the discontinuation or avoidance of LST, given the lack of evidence of benefit or the possibility of harm—including increasing the suffering of the dying person by prolonging the dying process—or based on concerns that LST interferes with the patient accepting that life is ending and finding peace in the final days. A provider also may be uncertain about whether withdrawing treatment is equivalent to causing the patient’s death. Conversely, the patient may continue to request LST on the basis of personal beliefs and a preference for potential prolonged life, independent of the oncologist’s clinical risk-benefit analysis.\n\nIndividual values inform the moral landscape of the practice of medicine. The potential conflicts described above are opportunities to refine clinicians’ understanding of their beliefs and values and to communicate their moral reasoning to each other as a sign of integrity and respect.[1] As clinicians struggle to communicate their reasons for recommendations or actions, the following three questions may serve as a framework:[2]\n\nWho makes the decision?\n\nBy what criteria do they make the decision?\n\nHow are conflicts among decision makers resolved?\n\nIn the event of conflict, an ethics consult may be necessary to identify the sources of disagreement and potential solutions, although frameworks have been proposed to guide the clinician.[3] The following paragraphs summarize information relevant to the first two questions.\n\nRespect for patient autonomy is an essential element of the relationship between oncology clinician and patient. Respect for autonomy encourages clinicians to elicit patients’ values, goals of care, and preferences and then seek to provide treatment or care recommendations consistent with patient preferences.[4] Autonomy is primarily a negative right to be free from the interference of others or, in health care, to refuse a recommended treatment or intervention.[5] On the basis of potential harm to others or deliberate harm to themselves, there are limits to what patients can expect in terms of their requests. More controversial limits are imposed when oncology clinicians feel they are asked to violate their ethical integrity or when the medical effectiveness of a treatment does not justify the burden.[2]\n\nPerceived conflicts about the issue of patient autonomy may be avoided by recalling that promoting patient autonomy is not only about treatments administered but also about discussions with the patient.[4] It is acceptable for oncology clinicians to share the basis for their recommendations, including concerns such as clinician-perceived futility.[6,7]\n\nThe following criteria to consider forgoing a potential LST are not absolute and remain a topic of discussion and debate; however, they offer a frame of reference for deliberation:\n\nThe possibility of forgoing a potential LST is worth considering when either the clinician perceives that the medical effectiveness of an intervention is not justified by the medical risks, or the patient perceives that the benefit (a more subjective appraisal) is not consistent with the burden.\n\nThe goal of forgoing a potential LST is to relieve suffering as experienced by the patient and not to cause the death of the patient.[8] Measures that deliberately seek to end the life of the patient are more problematic.\n\nThere is probably no difference between withholding or withdrawing a potential LST because the goal in both cases is to relieve or avoid further suffering.[9]\n\nThe burden and suffering associated with medical interventions from the patient’s perspective are the most important criteria for forgoing a potential LST. Distinctions between simple interventions (e.g., intravenous [IV] hydration) and more complicated interventions (e.g., mechanical ventilation) do not determine supporting the patient’s decision to forgo a treatment.[10]\n\nReligious and Spiritual Beliefs\n\nAwareness of the importance of religious beliefs and spiritual concerns within medical care has increased substantially over the last decade. National consensus guidelines, published in 2018, recommended the following:[11]\n\nThat all patients receive a screening assessment for religious and spiritual concerns, followed by a more complete spiritual history.\n\nThat all patients receive a formal assessment by a certified chaplain.\n\nThat such information is placed in patient records, with follow-up at all appropriate times, including hospitalization at the EOL.\n\nAn interprofessional approach is recommended: medical personnel, including physicians, nurses, and other professionals such as social workers and psychologists, are trained to address these issues and link with chaplains, as available, to evaluate and engage patients. A survey of nurses and physicians revealed that most nurses (74%) and physicians (60%) desire to provide spiritual care, which was defined as “care that supports a patient’s spiritual health.”[12] The more commonly cited barriers associated with the estimated amount of spiritual care provided to patients included inadequate training and the belief that providing spiritual care is not part of the medical professional’s role. Most nurses (79%) desired training in spiritual care; fewer physicians (51%) did.\n\nEvidence strongly supports that most cancer patients desire dialogue about these issues with their physicians, other staff as appropriate, and hospital chaplains, if indicated.[13] About one-half of patients acknowledge that they are not receiving such support from a religious community, either because they are not involved in one or because they do not perceive their community as supportive.[14] Regardless of such support, patients may report substantial spiritual distress at the EOL, ranging from as few as 10% or 15% of patients to as many as 60%.[15] Distress may range from anger at God, to a feeling of unworthiness, to lack of meaning. Such distress, if not addressed, may complicate EOL decisions and increase depression.\n\nFinally, it has been shown that addressing religious and spiritual concerns earlier in the terminal-care process substantially decreases the likelihood that patients will request aggressive EOL measures.[16] In contrast, patients who have received strong support from their own religious communities alone are less likely to enter hospice and more likely to seek aggressive EOL care.[15] It has also been shown that providing more comprehensive palliative care increases spiritual well-being as the EOL approaches.[17]\n\nFor more information, see Spirituality in Cancer Care.\n\nArtificial Hydration\n\nThe potential indications for artificial hydration in the final weeks or days of life may be broadly defined by the underlying goal of either temporarily reversing or halting clinical deterioration or improving the comfort of the dying patient.[18] Although artificial hydration may be provided through enteral routes (e.g., nasogastric tubes or percutaneous gastrostomy tubes), the more common route is parenteral, either IV by catheter or subcutaneously through a needle (hypodermoclysis).\n\nAlthough uncontrolled experience suggested several advantages to artificial hydration in patients with advanced cancer, a well-designed, randomized trial of 129 patients enrolled in home hospice demonstrated no benefit in parenteral hydration (1 L of normal saline infused subcutaneously over 4 hours) compared with placebo (100 mL of normal saline infused subcutaneously over 4 hours).[19] There were no differences in survival, symptoms, quality of life, or delirium.\n\nA prospective evaluation of the outcomes of 161 patients with advanced-stage abdominal cancers who received parenteral hydration in accordance with Japanese national guidelines near the EOL suggests there is little harm or benefit in hydration.[20] The median survival of the cohort was 20 days (range, 1–84 days); the mean volume of parenteral hydration was 912 ± 495 mL/day. There were no significant trends in global quality of life, discomfort, or physical symptoms for ill or good; signs of fluid retention were common but not exacerbated. However, patients expressed a high level of satisfaction with hydration and felt it was beneficial. The guidelines specify that patients with signs of volume overload should receive less than 1 L of hydration per day. When the investigators stratified patients into two groups—those who received at least 1 L of parenteral hydration per day and those who received less than 1 L per day—the prevalence of bronchial secretions was higher and hyperactive delirium was lower in the patients who received more than 1 L.[20]\n\nAny discussion about the risks or benefits of artificial hydration must include a consideration of patient and family perspectives.[21] Requests for artificial hydration or the desire for discussions about the role of artificial hydration seem to be driven by quality-of-life considerations as much as considerations for life prolongation.[22] Families may be helped with this decision when clinicians explain that use of artificial hydration in patients with cancer at the EOL has not been shown to help patients live longer or improve quality of life. Additionally, families can be educated about good mouth care and provision of sips of water to alleviate thirst.[23] The oncology clinician needs to approach these conversations with an open mind, recognizing that the harm caused by artificial hydration may be minimal relative to the perceived benefit, which includes reducing fatigue and increasing alertness.[24]\n\nArtificial Nutrition\n\nThe following discussion excludes patients for whom artificial nutrition may facilitate further anticancer treatment or for whom bowel obstruction is the main manifestation of their advanced cancer and for whom enteral or total parenteral nutrition may be of value.[25] Furthermore, artificial nutrition as a supplement may benefit the patient with advanced cancer who has a good performance status, a supportive home environment, and an anticipated survival longer than 3 months.[26,27]\n\nThe decisions about whether to provide artificial nutrition to the dying patient are similar to the decisions regarding artificial hydration. The American Academy of Hospice and Palliative Medicine (AAHPM) recommends that individual clinical situations be assessed using clinical judgment and skill to determine when artificial nutrition is appropriate. Recognizing that the primary intention of nutrition is to benefit the patient, AAHPM concludes that withholding artificial nutrition near the EOL may be appropriate medical care if the risks outweigh the possible benefit to the patient.[28]\n\nFood should be offered to patients consistent with their desires and ability to swallow. The benefit of providing artificial nutrition in the final days to weeks of life, however, is less clear. One study has concluded that artificial nutrition—specifically, parenteral nutrition—neither influenced the outcome nor improved the quality of life in terminally ill patients.[29]\n\nProviding artificial nutrition to patients at the EOL is a medical intervention and requires establishing enteral or parenteral access. Considerations of financial cost, burden to patient and family of additional hospitalizations and medical procedures, and all potential complications must be weighed against any potential benefit derived from artificial nutrition support.\n\nIn discussions with patients, the oncology clinician needs to recognize that the patient perception of benefit is worth exploring; as a compromise or acknowledgment of respect for the patient’s perspective, a time-limited trial may be warranted.[30]\n\nAnti-Infectives\n\nThe administration of anti-infectives, primarily antibiotics, in the last days of life is common, with antibiotic use reported in patients in the last week of life at rates ranging from 27% to 78%.[31-34][Level of evidence: III] Because of wide heterogeneity in the measurement of antibiotic use, assessment of symptom response, and lack of comparisons between patients receiving antimicrobials with those not receiving them, the benefit of antimicrobials is hard to define.[31] One retrospective study of 133 patients in a palliative care inpatient unit found that 68% received antimicrobials in their last 14 days of life, but the indication was documented in only 12% of these patients. White patients were more likely to receive antimicrobials than patients of other racial and ethnic backgrounds. Documented symptoms, including pain, dyspnea, fever, lethargy, and altered mental state, did not differ in the group that received antibiotics, compared with the patients who did not. However, the study’s conclusions were limited by the fact that it relied on retrospective chart review, and investigators did not use tools to measure and compare symptom severity in both groups.[34][Level of evidence: III]\n\nAn additional setting in which antimicrobial use may be warranted is that of contagious public health risks such as tuberculosis.[35] There is also concern that the continued use of antimicrobials in the last week of life may lead to increased risk of developing drug-resistant organisms.[36]\n\nIn general, most practitioners agree with the overall focus on patient comfort in the last days of life rather than providing curative therapies with unknown or marginal benefit, despite their ability to provide the therapy.[31,35-38]\n\nTransfusions\n\nAnemia is common in patients with advanced cancer; thrombocytopenia is less common and typically occurs in patients with progressive hematological malignancies. The decision to transfuse either packed red cells or platelets is based on a careful consideration of the overall goals of care, the imminence of death, and the likely benefit and risks of transfusions. The decision to use blood products is further complicated by the potential scarcity of the resource and the typical need for the patient to receive transfusions in a specialized unit rather than at home.\n\nThere are no randomized or controlled prospective trials of the indications, safety, or efficacy of transfused products. It should be recognized, however, that many patients will have received transfusions during active disease treatment or periods of supportive care. Such patients may have notions of the importance of transfusions related to how they feel and their life expectancies.\n\nSeveral considerations may be relevant to the decision to transfuse red blood cells:\n\nThe response in terms of improvement in fatigue and breathlessness is modest and transitory.[39]\n\nA significant proportion of patients die within 14 days of transfusion, which raises the possibility that transfusions may be harmful or that transfusions were inappropriately given to dying patients.[39]\n\nDecisions to transfuse red cells should be based on symptoms and not a trigger value.[40]\n\nTransfusion of rare blood types or human leukocyte antigen–compatible platelet products is more difficult to justify.[41]\n\nCardiopulmonary Resuscitation\n\nBroadly defined, resuscitation includes all interventions that provide cardiovascular, respiratory, and metabolic support necessary to maintain and sustain the life of a dying patient. It is important for patients, families, and proxies to understand that choices may be made to specify which supportive measures, if any, are given preceding death and at the time of death. People often believe that there is plenty of time to discuss resuscitation and the surrounding issues; however, many dying patients do not make choices in advance or have not communicated their decisions to their families, proxies, and the health care team. If these issues are unresolved at the time of EOL events, undesired support and resuscitation may result. Studies suggest that this aggressive care is associated with worse patient quality of life and worse adjustment to bereavement for loved ones.[42,43]\n\nNarrowly defined, a do-not-resuscitate (DNR) order instructs health care providers that, in the event of cardiopulmonary arrest, cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR, including chest compressions and/or ventilations) should not be performed and that natural death be allowed to proceed. DNR orders must be made before cardiac arrest and may be recommended by physicians when CPR is considered medically futile or would be ineffective in returning a patient to life. A DNR order may also be made at the instruction of the patient (or family or proxy) when CPR is not consistent with the goals of care.\n\nIt is advisable for a patient who has clear thoughts about these issues to initiate conversations with the health care team (or appointed health care agents in the outpatient setting) and to have forms completed as early as possible (i.e., before hospital admission), before the capacity to make such decisions is lost. Although patients with end-stage disease and their families are often uncomfortable bringing up the issues surrounding DNR orders, physicians and nurses can tactfully and respectfully address these issues appropriately and in a timely fashion. Lack of standardization in many institutions may contribute to ineffective and unclear discussions around DNR orders.[44]\n\nReferences\n\nKaldjian LC: Communicating moral reasoning in medicine as an expression of respect for patients and integrity among professionals.
