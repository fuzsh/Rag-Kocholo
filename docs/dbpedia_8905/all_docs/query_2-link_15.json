        "text": "Dys History, Family Crest & Coats of Arms\n\nOrigins Available:\n\nEngland\n\nDys is a name of Anglo-Saxon origin and came from the medieval personal name Dennis. Dys is a metronymic surname, which belongs to the category of hereditary surnames. In this case, the surname comes from the first name of the mother, or of another female ancestor of the bearer. It was common for second sons to take the name of their mother as a surname in the Middle Ages. In general, where patronymic surnames were used, the first son adopted the given name of his father as a surname. This type of surname is the most common form of hereditary surname. The earliest origins of this family were found in the county of Worcestershire, where they had been settled prior to the Norman Conquest, in 1066.\n\nEarly Origins of the Dys family\n\nThe surname Dys was first found in London where Richard Dysun was listed in the Hundredorum Rolls of 1274. Later, Ralph Dyson was listed in the Subsidy Rolls for Sussex in 1296 and John Dysone was found in the Subsidy Rolls for Worcestershire in 1327. John Dyesson was a Freeman of York in 1387. John, son of Dionysia de Langside is also called John Dyson de Langside in 1369. 1\n\n\"Dy or Dye, whence the patronymic Dyson. Almost all our Dysons hail from Yorkshire, where the font-name had a popularity second only to those of Matilda and Isabel. \" 2\n\nThe Yorkshire Poll Tax Rolls of 1379 include: Johannes Dison; Johannes Dison; and Dionisia uxor Thome Dison. 2\n\n\"Dyson is a name now numerous in the Huddersfield district [of West Yorkshire]. It was well established in the parish of Ecclesfield during the reign of Elizabeth I.\" 3\n\nEarly History of the Dys family\n\nThis web page shows only a small excerpt of our Dys research. Another 92 words (7 lines of text) covering the years 1387, 1688, 1722, 1742, 1776, 1788, 1808, 1812, 1816, 1836 and 1860 are included under the topic Early Dys History in all our PDF Extended History products and printed products wherever possible.\n\nDys Spelling Variations\n\nSpelling variations in names were a common occurrence before English spelling was standardized a few hundred years ago. In the Middle Ages, even the literate spelled their names differently as the English language incorporated elements of French, Latin, and other European languages. Many variations of the name Dys have been found, including Dyson, Dison, Disson, Dysson and others.\n\nEarly Notables of the Dys family\n\nNotables of this surname at this time include:\n\nJeremiah Dyson (1722-1776), English civil servant and politician who has been tersely described as â€˜by birth a tailor, by education a dissenter, and from interest or vanity in his earlier years a repu...\n\nCharles Dyson (1788-1860), professor of Anglo-Saxon at Oxford University, was the grandson of Jeremiah Dyson [q. v.], and the son of a clerk of the House of Commons. He was first sent to a private sch...\n\nMigration of the Dys family\n\nFamilies began migrating abroad in enormous numbers because of the political and religious discontent in England. Often faced with persecution and starvation in England, the possibilities of the New World attracted many English people. Although the ocean trips took many lives, those who did get to North America were instrumental in building the necessary groundwork for what would become for new powerful nations. Among the first immigrants of the name Dys, or a variant listed above to cross the Atlantic and come to North America were : Edward Dyson who settled in Maryland in 1725; William Dyson settled in New England in 1756; Daniel, Frederick, James, John, Joseph, and William Dyson all arrived in Philadelphia between 1840 and 1865..\n\nRelated Stories +\n\nCitations +\n\nReaney, P.H and R.M.
