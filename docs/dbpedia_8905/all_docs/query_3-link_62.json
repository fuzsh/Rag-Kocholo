As a result, cyberspace has become the most active threat domain in the world and the most dynamic threat to the Homeland.\n\nNation-states and their proxies, transnational criminal organizations, and cyber criminals use sophisticated and malicious tactics to undermine critical infrastructure, steal intellectual property and innovation, engage in espionage, and threaten our democratic institutions. By 2021, cybercrime damages are likely to exceed $6 trillion per year. Moreover, the interconnectivity of critical infrastructure systems raises the possibility of cyber attacks that cause devastating kinetic and non-kinetic effects. As innovation, hyper-connectivity, and digital dependencies all outpace cybersecurity defenses, the warning signs are all present for a potential “cyber 9/11” on the horizon.\n\nCritical infrastructure provides the services that are the backbone of our national and economic security and the health and well-being of all Americans. Cybersecurity threats to critical infrastructure are one of the most significant strategic risks for the United States, threatening our national security, economic prosperity, and public health and safety. In particular, nation-states are targeting critical infrastructure to collect information and gain access to industrial control systems in the energy, nuclear, water, aviation, and critical manufacturing sectors. Additionally, sophisticated nation-state attacks against government and private-sector organizations, critical infrastructure providers, and Internet service providers support espionage, extract intellectual property, maintain persistent access on networks, and potentially lay a foundation for future offensive operations.\n\nMeanwhile, the heightened threat from physical terrorism and violent crime remains, increasingly local and often aimed at places like malls and theaters, stadiums, and schools. Moreover, the advent of hybrid attacks, where adversaries use both physical and electronic means to inflict and compound harm, renders the threat landscape more challenging than ever.\n\nThe Department of Homeland Security's cybersecurity and critical infrastructure security responsibilities focus on four goals:"
