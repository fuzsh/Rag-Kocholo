        "text": "The Missouri Division of Youth Services (DYS) is a state agency of Missouri that operates juvenile correctional facilities. A division of the Missouri Department of Social Services, DYS has its headquarters in Jefferson City.\n\nHistory\n\n[edit]\n\nCirca the 1970s Missouri began shifting its juvenile corrections into a system that emphasizes smaller secure centers and with less emphasis on punishment. By 2006 many states were trying to copy Missouri's system.[1]\n\nFacilities\n\n[edit]\n\nDYS facilities include:[2]\n\nCamp Avery Park Camp - Snow Hill Township, Lincoln County\n\nFulton Treatment Center - Fulton\n\nGentry Residential Treatment Center - Cabool\n\nGreen Gables Lodge Treatment Center - Mack's Creek\n\nHillsboro Treatment Center - Hillsboro\n\nHogan Street Regional Youth Center - St. Louis\n\nLangsford House Youth Center - Lee's Summit\n\nMissouri Hills Youth Center - St. Louis\n\nMount Vernon Treatment Center - Mount Vernon\n\nNew Madrid Bend Youth Center - New Madrid\n\nNorthwest Regional Youth Center - Kansas City\n\nRich Hill Youth Development Center - Rich Hill\n\nRiverbend Treatment Center - St. Joseph\n\nSierra-Osage Treatment Center - Poplar Bluff\n\nW.

In 1938 it had been called[who?] the worst juvenile facility in the United States.[4] By 1948 violent prisoners had killed two boys. As a result, Governor Phil M. Donnelly removed 71 prisoners from the training school and relocated them to an adult prison. He dismissed the board of the State Board for Training Schools, the juvenile correctional authority.[3] It closed in 1983.[5]\n\nMissouri Training School for Girls - Chillicothe\n\nIt opened in 1889,[3] and closed in 1981.[5]\n\nMissouri Training School for Negro Girls - Tipton - Opened in 1926, closed in 1956 and consolidated into the school in Chillicothe.[3]\n\nRosa Parks Center - Fulton - A center for incarcerated girls, it is a former university dormitory,[6] located at William Woods University. It holds 10-12 girls at a time.[7] WWU students are involved with the center.[8]\n\nDYS and WWU agreed to the joint project in 2000, and the center opened in January 2001 and shut down due to lack of state funding in August 2020.[8]\n\nBabler Lodge - Wildwood Shut down August 2020\n\nMontgomery City Youth Center - Montgomery City Closed August 2020\n\nNortheast Community Treatment Center - Mexico Closed about 2016\n\nDelmina Woods, Forsyth, Missouri - Permanently Closed\n\nCornerstone Group Home, Columbia, Missouri - Permanently Closed in 2020\n\nReferences\n\n[edit]\n\nFurther reading\n\n[edit]\n\nDubin, Jennifer. \"Metamorphosis: How Missouri Rehabilitates Juvenile Offenders\" (Archive).
