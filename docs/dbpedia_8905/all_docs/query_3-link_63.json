        "text": "Gender identity is how you feel and identify, and can be as a female, male, or both. Gender is typically assigned at birth, based on a baby having the outward appearance (genital organs) of either a male or a female as per a social construct of a binary system of two genders (male or female).\n\nIf your gender identity matches the gender assigned to you at birth, this is called cisgender. For example, if you were born biologically as a male, and you identify as a man, you are a cisgender man.\n\nTransgender refers to identifying as a gender that is different from the biological gender assigned when you were born. For example, if were born biologically female and were assigned a female gender, but you feel a deep inner sense of being a man, you are a transgender man.\n\nSome people express their gender in ways that do not fit into traditional binary social norms of male or female gender. This is called non-binary, gender non-conforming, genderqueer, or gender-expansive. In general, most transgender people do not identify as non-binary.\n\nIt is important to mention that the anxiety transgender people may feel due to having the body of the wrong gender is deeply distressing. As a result, the transgender community has a higher rate of mental health problems and risk of attempted suicide.\n\nNo one knows exactly what causes gender dysphoria. Some experts believe that hormones in the womb, genes, and cultural and environmental factors may be involved.\n\nThe main goal of treatment is to help you overcome the distress you may feel. You can choose the level of treatment that helps you feel most comfortable. This may include helping you transition to the gender you identify with.\n\nTreatment for gender dysphoria is individualized, and may include:\n\nCounseling to help you understand your feelings and to provide you with support and coping skills\n\nCouples or family counseling to help reduce conflicts, create understanding, and provide a supportive environment\n\nGender-affirming hormone therapy (in the past called hormone replacement therapy)\n\nGender-affirming surgery (in the past called sex-reassignment surgery)\n\nNot all transgender people need all forms of treatment. They can select one or more of the treatments listed above.\n\nBefore making a decision about surgery, it's likely you will first have had gender-affirming hormone therapy and have lived as your chosen gender for a minimum of one year. There are two main types of surgery: one affects fertility, the other does not. Not everyone chooses to have surgery, or they may choose only one type of surgery.\n\nSocietal and family pressures and lack of acceptance can cause anxiety and depression and other mental health issues. This is why it's important that you receive counseling and support throughout and even after your transition. It is also important to have emotional support from other people, such as from a support group or from close friends and family.\n\nMake an appointment with a provider with expertise in transgender medicine if you or your child has symptoms of gender dysphoria.\n\nIf you or someone you know is thinking about suicide, call or text 988 or chat 988lifeline.org. You can also call 1-800-273-8255 (1-800-273-TALK). The 988 Suicide and Crisis Lifeline provides free and confidential support 24/7, anytime day or night.\n\nYou can also call 911 or the local emergency number or go to the hospital emergency room. DO NOT delay.\n\nIf someone you know has attempted suicide, call 911 or the local emergency number right away. DO NOT leave the person alone, even after you have called for help."
