        "text": "I waited and now I ask myself why???? This bedding is worth every single cent! I came across this brand researching for Rv bedding and I hesitated because of the price, but after two weeks of absolutely struggling to make our bed every morning I caved and I bought the Reese bedding because we have 3 cats and just WOW! Life is much easier in the morning! Zip zip and done! I am a forever customer!\n\nI absolutely love our Beddy's! It is the most comfortable bedding I've ever had. Initially I was just going to get two twin sets for my 2 son's bunk bed but realized it would also be a convenience for my husband and I and our queen bed. The ease of zipping up the bed for all of us has been really great. Our rooms look much more out together. No more blankets falling off the bunk beds and our beds always look put together. Plus that Minky lining is so soft and comfortable. We all love our new beddys bed sets.\n\nBeen using our beddy’s set for about a month now and I can’t get over how much I love it. No only are the fabrics great, the bed pulls together so easily and looks perfect every time! I will never go back to traditional bedding with all separate pieces!\n\nI was hesitant to purchase because of the price but oh my, it's worth every penny. The minky is soft and warm (but not too warm that you'll be crazy hot). We have it in our master bedroom in the RV and it makes making the bed unbelievably easy to make. Now I want to purchase for the kid's bunks. I wish I saved the hassle of making the bed and just purchased it sooner.\n\nI was super impressed with the overall quality of the Beddy's that I purchased. I didn't expect it to be as nice as it was. The care instructions were very clear and it washed beautifully. My daughter is thrilled and Iove how nice and neat her room looks now. I will be ordering more for my son!\n\nBeddy's is worth every penny! The quality of this product is exquisite. I have never spent that kind of money for bedding, especially for a camper. But, I am glad that I did. It is worth every penny!\n\nThe quality of this bedding is unmatched. I have washed it and the fabric and make of the bedding didn't change. I cannot wait to get more sets. Also, I would like to comment on the customer service. I have never experienced a more kind experience when dealing with customer service. And the immediate response and reconciliation of the issue. Eazy peazy breezy and I am beyond pleased.\n\nGreat for RV beds! I love how easy it is to fix the bed in my motorhome! With the tight spaces, it can be difficult to make the bed, but with Beddy’s zippers, now it’s a breeze!\n\nThis is the best bedding solution we have found. My husband and I have very different sleeping styles. I like it light and airy, he has a weighted blanket. I am always cold and he is warm. He accuses me of stealing the covers and he sleeps on top of mine. We tried Beddy's for our RV and LOVED them so much we needed to get a set for our bed at home as well. It's amazing my husband and I agree how to sleep now."
