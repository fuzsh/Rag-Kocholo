Serving The Community Since 2009

Bangladeshi American Community Development and Youth Services (BACDYS) was founded in 2009 by Misba Abdin. Since then, it has become the leading nonprofit organization in

the surrounding neighborhoods of East Brooklyn, New York. Our mission is to provide low-income families with the skills, the confidence, and the knowledge that will help them improve

their living conditions. By providing these families with information and guidance on affordable housing, education, youth programs, and entertainment we seek to grant them new opportunities to succeed.

ABOUT US

Culturally Competent

New York is home to a range of diverse communities from around the world particularly from Bangladesh. The Bangladeshi residents tend to live in low income communities with lack of educational resources. A majority of the population speak little to no English due to them living in culturally isolated communities. BACDYS seeks to expand the scope of its services to serve immigrants from Bangladesh, Indo-Caribbean, and Guyana within the five boroughs of New York City and beyond.
