        "text": "More than a century ago in Milwaukee, Miller Brewing Company introduced the world to a new beer.\n\nIn the early 1900s, most Americans enjoyed their beer in a saloon or taken home in bucket. But as a market developed for “bottle beer,” Miller brewers crafted a crisp, refreshing, effervescent beer to be known as Miller High Life. Within three years, the new beer earned the nickname “The Champagne of Bottle Beer” and this December, the beer will celebrate its 120th birthday, remaining an iconic American brew.\n\n“Miller High Life has been a mainstay in American beer since 1903 due to the timeless balance of flavor and refreshment it brings to drinkers nationwide,” says Lucy Bloxam, global brand marketing manager for Miller High Life. “Whether you're at your local dive bar or the home bar, High Life is the perfect fit.”\n\nAccording to trademark statements, Miller claimed first use of the High Life brand name from December 30, 1903 -just ahead of New Year’s Eve allowing its customers the courtesy of a little extra time to purchase High Life ahead of holiday celebrations, according to Daniel Scholzen, Molson Coors corporate archivist.\n\n“The proximity of the High Life’s debut to New Year’s Eve was subsequently capitalized on by the brewery to build mystique around the brand,” Scholzen says.\n\nWhile High Life would go on to become Miller’s flagship brand, this did not happen immediately. When it debuted, High Life was merely one of many brands brewed and sold by Miller. Other Miller brands during the early 20th century included Buffet, Münchener, Bock, Export, Porter, and Extra Pale Bohemian. High Life was intended to fill a particular niche in the Miller portfolio at the time - what we would now call an “above-premium” brand. In 1904 a case of Miller High Life bottles cost $1.80—the equivalent of $62 today.\n\n“Over the years, as the beer markets changed and High Life gained popularity and notoriety, the brew became much more affordable while bringing the same quality, purity and flavor that High Life has always been known for,” Scholzen says.\n\nPerhaps the most famous icon associated with Miller High Life is the Girl in the Moon. “But who is she?” says Scholzen. “The short answer is no one knows.”\n\nThere are several tales about her, he says. Some say she was inspired by artwork the Miller family acquired in Mexico. Another story goes that a Miller advertising executive was lost in the woods and had a vision that led to the Girl in the Moon. Other lore suggests she was based off of a Miller family member. “But whoever she is, she has been gracing the bottles of High Life since 1906,” Scholzen says.\n\nIts nickname - “the champagne of beers” - was earned for a number of reasons. “The earliest High Life bottles featured tapered, sloping shoulders, which resembled champagne bottles,” he says. “Plus, Miller’s golden color and high carbonation, both readily apparent in their clear bottles, encourage comparisons to champagne. That paired with the fact that High Life debuted close to New Year’s Eve also bolsters the connection with champagne, the classic New Year’s beverage.”\n\nThe first ads combining “The Champagne of Bottle Beer” slogan appeared in mid-1907 and in the years leading up to Prohibition, “The Champagne of Bottle Beer” became strongly associated with High Life and was used to emphasize the elegance and quality of the brand. T\n\nThe slogan was discontinued during Prohibition, when Miller produced only non-alcoholic beverages, including a non-alcoholic version of Miller High Life, but it returned with Repeal in 1933, and firmly entrenched the phrase as a brand identifier. The slogan continued to be used until the late 1960s when it was altered to “The Champagne of Beers,” in order to remind consumers that High Life had been available in cans since shortly after World War II. Miller High Life, in fact, was very popular with servicemen, as they got a taste of it during World Ward II.\n\n“High Life was so popular post-war that Miller was literally unable to make enough to meet demand,” Scholzen says. “In fact, it had to ration supplies to distributors, leading to thirsty folks driving to Wisconsin or other markets where it was sold to smuggle the beer back home.” T\n\nAs a result of that demand, Miller embarked on a massive expansion project to enable it to brew more High Life.\n\nThe slogan “Miller Time” often is associated with Miller Lite, but it actually originated during a time when beer sales were sagging. The jingle - “If you’ve got the time, we’ve got the beer” - was heard in television and radio ads in the early 1970s. “The campaign so successful that High Life was revitalized, and the brewery was able to turn its attention to launching a new product in 1975: Miller Lite,” Scholzen says, adding that the advent of Miller Lite led Miller from being ranked as the seventh-largest American brewery to the second largest in just seven years.\n\nBringing the timelessness of Miller High Life to new audiences, spaces and products has embedded us in culture for the last 120 years and we plan to keep that course for the next 120 too,” Bloxam says."
