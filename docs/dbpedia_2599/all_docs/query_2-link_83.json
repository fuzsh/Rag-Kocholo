        "text": "Escape for 15 minutes into The High Life, a story of a family living in Chamonix’s oldest mountain hut\n\nAfter 119 years in its original state, Le Refuge de la Charpoua – Chamonix’s oldest and smallest outpost – will be rebuilt this summer. The hut keeper of eight years, Sarah Cartier, with her partner Noé and two children embrace the high life and all its history in the mountains near Chamonix, France.\n\nThe timeworn little building is surrounded by towering granite walls and alpine light providing them with a mystical setting for their work in a mountain refuge; a place to breathe in the freedom of the high life while the sights and sounds of the busy world below fall away.\n\nA Patagonia film\n\nDirector Pierre Cadot\n\nProduction Yucca Films\n\nOriginal Music Jonathan Labigne and Yann Chapelet – Zikali\n\nAdditional Music Alton Ellis – True Born African\n\nThe Charpoua refuge is located at an altitude of 2,841m on a rocky spur on the left side of the Glacier de la Charpoua, overhanging the Mer de Glace.\n\nIt’s something of a mission getting to this tiny outpost high above Chamonix, but gives lodging to climbers accessing the peaks that surround the Charpoua basin – Drus, Aiguille Verte, Le Cardinal, L’Eveque and La Nonne.\n\nFind it here on FatMap:"
