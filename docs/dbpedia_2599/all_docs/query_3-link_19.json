        "text": "Authorities in Europe crushed – literally – more than 2,300 cans of Miller High Life because the beer is labelled \"The Champagne of Beers.\"\n\nBelgian customs seized a shipment of 2,352 cans of Miller High Life in Antwerp, Belgium in February. Comité Champagne, the trade group that protects the Champagne region of northeastern France's designation of origin and its trademark, asked that the beer, bound for Germany, be destroyed.\n\nMiller High Life, since it is labeled as \"The Champagne of Beers,\" infringed on the Champagne region's designation and trademark, the trade group said in a press release. The consignee of the cans in Germany was told of the plan to destroy the shipment on April 17 and did not contest the decision, the trade group said.\n\n\"It confirms the importance that the European Union attaches to designations of origin and rewards the determination of the Champagne producers to protect their designation,\" Comité Champagne managing director Charles Goemaere said in a statement.\n\nMcDonald's menu: Next week, you can add Big Mac sauce to anything; get it free with McNuggets\n\nA good egg? How to easily check if your eggs are good or bad\n\nThe trade group, which paid for the process, released video and photos of the process of disposing and recycling of what amounted to 98 cases of beer. The beer and cans were \"recycled in an environmentally responsible manner,\" the group said.\n\nMiller High Life was called \"The Champagne of Bottle Beers” from 1906 to 1969, primarily because many beers weren't available in a bottle and the bottle was shaped like a champagne bottle, according to the Molson Coors website. In 1969, the phrasing was shortened to “The Champagne of Beers,\" and was dropped for a time in the 1990s. But it continues to be adorned on the can and bottles, which retain their iconic shape.\n\n\"With its elegant, clear-glass bottle and crisp taste, Miller High Life has proudly worn the nickname ‘The Champagne of Beers’ for almost 120 years,\" Molson Coors Beverage Co., said in a statement to USA TODAY. MillerCoors was previously the U.S. operating unit of Molson Coors. In 2016, Molson Coors wholly acquired Miller Brewing and later dropped the MillerCoors name to operate as Molson Coors in the U.S. and globally.\n\n\"Of course, we respect local restrictions around the word ‘champagne,’ but we remain proud of Miller High Life, its nickname and its Milwaukee, Wisconsin provenance,\" the statement continued. \"We invite our friends in Europe to the U.S. any time to toast the High Life together.\"\n\nFollow Mike Snider on Twitter: @mikesnider."
