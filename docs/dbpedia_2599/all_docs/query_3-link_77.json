        "text": "Reid\n\nbeers 3546 º places 95 º 14:15 Tue 7/18/2006\n\nOriginally posted by HogTownHarry\n\nI am thinking it might be attributable to a misguided nostalgia for an early positive experience with said bottles. Although I’d have to speculate that it wasn’t the contents of the bottles that made the experience positive ...\n\nOn a similar but completely different note, I once had fond memories of MGD - I drank tons of it when it first came on the market while traveling in Florida watching spring training - never went back to it until I decided to rate a bottle last year. They’re right. You can’t (shouldn’t) go back.\n\nRemember how, in retrospect, things like - say - the 70’s start to seem cool? That’s selective memory, baby - the 70s blew chunks. So does Miller.\n\nI think you need therapy, dude.\n\nLOL I KNOW I need therapy..amd MHL is the least of my worries\n\nBut you speak a note of truth..when I first immigrated to the USA it was to Georgia, just south of ATlanta. That area was full of Miller High Life drinking people..and at the time reaching for a bottle of High Life straight from the ice bucket ( even though they had it in regular long necks then) was an almost magical expierience.\n\nBut still I had the cans down their too and found them lacking.\n\nYEEEEEEEEEEE HAW !!\n\nReid\n\nbeers 3546 º places 95 º 14:53 Tue 7/18/2006\n\nOriginally posted by ross\n\nI drink at least 6 highlifes a week (on saturday) usually from the can. cans get colder (it seems) and i actually think it tastes better in the can than in the bottle.\n\nweird..I am thinkin i have some positive reinforcement of the bottles or it IS different breweries in different parts of the country.\n\nBut i never had that problem with Bud..its crap everywhere in every form."
