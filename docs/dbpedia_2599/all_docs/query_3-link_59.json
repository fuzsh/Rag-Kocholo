        "text": "Hank Williams was always a fan of Cowboy movies. Gene Autry, Randolph Scott, Roy Rogers were the \"Singing Cowboys\" of the day. Hank would watch these performers at the local theaters in Montgomery. He fashioned himself as a singing cowboy as well. After his career started to take off, Hank purchased his property on Franklin Road in Nashville. He had several horses at his ranch style home. His favorite horse, \"High Life\" is pictured here. The Saddle was made for Hank personally and is currently housed in the Hank Williams Museum in Montgomery."
