        "text": "Why do I buy books from Ama zon.com? Location, location, location. Not Amazon's -- mine. The bookstores of central New Jersey are actually better than you might expect, but London it's not.\n\nBrowsing in a physical bookstore is still the best way to find books you weren't looking for. But if there's a specific book I want, I go online. Convenience, not price, is the selling point: I would buy those books from Amazon even if I were charged a couple of dollars extra.\n\nAnd maybe Amazon will charge me a few dollars extra.\n\nRecently it came to light that Amazon has been charging different customers different prices (for movies, not books). The company insists that the price differentials were random, a way of testing the market. But many buyers accused the online retailer of tailoring its price to the consumer's characteristics. And even if Amazon's prices really were random, the outrage of those who had paid a few dollars extra suggests that ''dynamic pricing'' is about to become a major consumer issue, maybe even a political issue.\n\nYou see, despite that outrage, dynamic pricing won't go away. Both the nature of e-commerce -- the ease with which sellers can figure out who you are and what you want -- and the nature of ''new economy'' business in general make it almost irresistible. The only thing that is likely to stop it is government action.\n\nDynamic pricing is a new version of an old practice: price discrimination. It uses a potential buyer's electronic fingerprint -- his record of previous purchases, his address, maybe the other sites he has visited -- to size up how likely he is to balk if the price is high. If the customer looks price-sensitive, he gets a bargain; if he doesn't he pays a premium.\n\nTo see why this is not just attractive to sellers but arguably good for the economy, look at how the publishing business works now. Books must be sold at a price well above the actual cost of producing one more copy. Otherwise the publisher couldn't cover costs that don't depend on how many books are sold -- editing, typesetting and, yes, writing. But by charging, say, $25 for a book that costs only $3 to produce the publisher loses some potential profitable sales.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
