        "text": "MY first encounter with ''American Psycho'' should have prepared me for the trouble to come. This was in London, in 1991, shortly after the novel by Bret Easton Ellis was published. I was working for a BBC arts program, which was doing a segment on the controversy surounding the novel, and heard the producer in charge exclaiming that the book was vile and should not have been published. I found out later she had not read it. Curious, I bought a copy and began reading it on the subway, braving the horrified glances of other passengers. Nothing I had read about the controversy prepared me for what kind of book it was. The story of Patrick Bateman, a status-obsessed Wall Street executive who commits frenzied murders in his spare time, was not a slasher novel. It was a surreal satire, and although many scenes were excruciatingly violent, it was clearly intended as a critique of male misogyny, not an endorsement of it.\n\nAt the time, I had no thought of making a movie of ''American Psycho.'' When eight years later I was asked to do just that, it seemed to me that enough time had passed for the story to be seen as a commentary on the late 80's, and I hoped that by excising those graphic torture scenes, I would allow the novel's true meaning to appear. Of course that was naive, for if the forces of outrage had not bothered to read the book, why would they wait to see it on screen?\n\nBefore the film was even edited, the British tabloid The News of the World got hold of some innocuous photos of the actors standing around the set and published them with the headline, ''The most disgusting film of the year!'' Recently Eleanor Smeal, the president of the Feminist Majority Foundation, announced ''There are no redeeming qualities to a misogynist product like this'' -- without having seen it. And a lawyer in Florida threatened a lawsuit against ''American Psycho'' while admitting he had not read the book or the script, or seen the film.\n\nRecently some critics have attacked the film for not being violent enough, but that hasn't slowed the controversy. I had not anticipated how panicky and confused the atmosphere around American movies has become since the rumblings from Washington about voluntary codes and the threatened lawsuits over ''Natural Born Killers'' and ''The Basketball Diaries.'' After ''American Psycho'' was shown at Sundance this year, I was asked over and over: ''Aren't you concerned about violence in entertainment?'' and ''How can you release this film after Columbine?'' -- although even the novel's harshest critics have never accused it of causing violence in high schools."
