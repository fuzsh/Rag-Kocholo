        "text": "There are a lot of theories about the story behind one of the oldest American Brand mascots- the Miller High Life Girl in the Moon. Who was she? What is she? Why is she dressed as she is? What’s with her whip? Well, I have my own theory of who she is and my theory is based on her hat – her tall straw hat – called a Strohcylinder in the northwestern part of Wuertemburg. Germany , near the Black Forest\n\nI’ve used this method before in photo archeology, using tracht or traditional German costume to link to a region, and then connecting to a recipe or specific food. I did it with a wedding picture linking a Hanoverian immigrant to a Cincinnati goetta recipe.\n\nSo it’s this method that I link the tall straw hat wearing young maiden perched on the moon in the Miller ad to the area of north Wuertemburg to the eastern border of the Black Forest, in the area where Miller Brewery Founder, Friedrich Muller was born. The town was called Riedlingen, and it’s here were Friedrich was born to town mayor Thaddeus and Maria Louisa Muller. He learned the trade of brewing, became a master brewer, and worked for the Wuertemburg Royal Brewery in Sigmaringen, Hohenzollern. Germany. Then he came to the states in 1854, bought a brewery in MIlwauke, and the rest is American beer history.\n\nAbove image: Friedrich Muller/Miller, founder of Miller Brewing, the oldest continually operating German immigrant brewery in America.\n\nWisconsin beer drinkers had their first taste of Miller High Life Beer on December 30, 1903. Maybe it’s release dates proximity to New Year led to its being called the Champagne of Beers. Soon after its release the beer was advertised with a girl in tall straw hat standing on a wooden High Life Crate, holding a tray of High Life Beer. It wouldn’t be until 1905 when she was perched on a crescent moon and became the Girl on the Moon. Tassles from her elaborate Black Forest costume in the first crate standing ad were mistaken for a whip, but she was given a whip under her arm when she perched on the moon in 1905.\n\nA predominant theory is that the Girl in the Moon is a circus trainer or ring mistress because she has a whip perched under her arm. She’s also been called a witch. Both of these theories are preposterous. I have a theory about this whip too, which I’ll get into, and it has nothing to do with circus animals or witch BDSM.\n\nLinda Hoffman, a nurse and metalsmith has High Life in her blood. It’s not that she’s a big drinker, but she is a passionate collector of Miller High Life memorabilia, and she has good reason to be. As she told the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel in a 2016 interview, she believes her great-uncle, the artist Thomas Wallace Holmes, was responsible for creating the earliest Miller High Life advertising artwork. While Holmes used his own wife, Hoffman’s great-aunt Carrie, as the model for another early Miller ad featuring a Gibson Girl-type perched on a beer crate, Hoffman believes her grandmother, Ruth Strauss, was the one to be immortalized as the Girl in the Moon.\n\nWhile Linda Hoffman’s speculation may be true, a few other stories are circulating about Moon Girl’s origins. Both AdAge and Beer and Beyond repeat the tale of a Miller marketer who got lost in Wisconsin’s Northwoods one night and experienced a vision of a woman on a crescent moon. This story, however, does not preclude Hoffman’s grandmother having served as the model for the artist’s rendition of the dream girl. There is another a story that the model who posed for the first Moon Girl images, as well as the ones with the original crate-sitter, was Frederick Miller’s granddaughter. None of the Miller family have come forth to affirm the story, but they have not denied it either.\n\nAlthough Friedrich Miller had died in 1888, and his sons Ernest and Fred Jr came up with Miller High Life – were still German, German speaking and would have known that creating a beautiful young German maiden in the tracht of their ancestral hometown of Wuertemburg would have appealed and been recognized by the largely Baden-German immigrants of Wisconsin. And the whip wasn’t there for circus animals. As a country German maiden of upper Wuertemburg, she would have used it to corral her pigs or her cattle on her family’s farm. Perhaps she would have even then milked the cow to use for Bibeleskase, a Baden delicacy at beer hall tables today, which is the grandfather of American beer cheese.\n\nAbove image: Painting by Fritz Reiss, father of Union Terminal Mural artist Winold Reiss, showing a German woman in traditional rural of the Black Forest costume herding her piglets.\n\nMiller wasn’t the first to use an ad that featured a girl on a moon. That honor may go to a French poster dated 1895 that was entitled “Bieres du Croissant” showing a damsel with a large bread product in one hand and a bottle of beer in the other. A Canadian brewery was also ahead of Miller in depicting a moon maiden. That image dated from about 1900. Eugene O’Keefe, a wealthy banker, purchased an existing Ontario brewery and renamed O’Keefe & Company. It was the first to produce lager beer in Canada, along with ales and porters. This woman on the moon imagery was meant to inspire men’s fantasies as they drank the beer, and was a common advertising theme.\n\nPre-Prohibition, turn of the last century, beer advertising was all about evoking nostalgia back to the Heimat or German homeland they left for America. The German brewers and their first generation immigrant beer drinking customers all had ties back home. A lot of these ads employed beautiful young Germanic beer waitresses carrying hands full of liter steins to their boisterous male clients – ala the St. Pauli Girl, the original Stroh’s girl and the Blatz Beer girl.\n\nStraw hats have been popular in rural regions of Southwest Baden Wuertemburg (especially the Schwartzwald/Black Forest} and southwestern Bavaria. There’s a Hat Museum in Allgau in a former hat factory that documents the history and fashion of these straw hats. The Strohcylinder or Straw Cylinder Hat has been worn in many regional variations of rural southwest Germany since the 1700s. English ladies are known for their stylish hats or ‘fascinators” but the Germanic gals were rocking fantastic hats centuries before them. And it may be the Hanoverian English monarchy – who changed their name to Windsor during WWII because of anti-German sentiment, that brought the hat into fashionable English women’s wear.\n\nThese hats and specific regional costumes women wore signaled their marital status to young men to prevent them from an embarrassing situation of hitting on a girl who was already taken. This is especially handy after drinking a few liters when barriers are broken down. For example, in the black forest / Schwartwald, single women wore red balls in their Bollenhut, where married women wore black ones. Two artists in the Black Forest – photographer Sebastian Wehrle and fashion designer Jochen Scherzinger recently collaborated to produce an amazing photo series of men and women of Wuertemburg and the Black Forest in their traditional tracht or costumers, which feature some of these strohhut / straw hats as featured on our Girl on the Moon.\n\nEven today, Germany’s most popular beer, Radhaus, brewed in the Baden town of the same name – and which made its first appearance in Cincinnati at 2022 Germani Oktoberfest and Tuba Baking in Dayton – uses an image of a pretty girl in regional tracht.\n\nErnest Miller died in 1922 and was succeeded as president by his brother Fred Jr. Fred’s advertising team would then remodel the girl on the moon, in which he changed her look from profile to straight on, removed her whip, and de-Germanized her tracht to a more circusey outfit.\n\nFred remained president and chief executive of Miller Brewing until 1947 when his nephew, Frederick C., became head of the firm. Frederick C. instituted a program of expansion, and was instrumental in bringing major league baseball (the Braves) to Milwaukee. But they have Cincinnati and the local Hauck Brewery to thank for inventing beer concessions, which they did at Redleg stadium in the late 1880s."
