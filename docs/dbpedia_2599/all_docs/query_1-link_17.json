        "text": "Introduction\n\nThe best way to protect against polio, or poliomyelitis, is to get vaccinated. Polio vaccination has been part of the routine childhood immunization schedule in the United States for decades. It's still part of the routine childhood immunization schedule.\n\nInactivated polio vaccine (IPV) is the only polio vaccine that has been given in the United States since 2000. Oral polio vaccine (OPV) is used in other countries.\n\nAvailable vaccines\n\nThere are two types of vaccines that protect against polio.\n\nInactivated polio vaccine (IPV)\n\nThe only polio vaccine that has been used in the United States since 2000.\n\nIt is given by shot in the leg or arm, depending on the patient's age.\n\nOral polio vaccine (OPV)\n\nNo longer licensed or available in the United States\n\nIt is still used in many parts of the world.\n\nChildren receive doses of the vaccine by drops in the mouth.\n\nSince 2000, only IPV has been used to eliminate the risk of polio variants that can occur with OPV.\n\nRecommendations\n\nAs part of routine childhood immunization, children in the United States should get IPV to protect against polio. IPV may sometimes be given in the same shot with other vaccines (also called combination vaccines). You can ask your child's doctor about this option.\n\nChildren should get 4 doses total, one at each of the following ages:\n\n2 months old\n\n1st dose\n\n4 months old\n\n2nd dose\n\n6–18 months old\n\n3rd dose\n\n4–6 years old\n\n4th dose\n\nChildren who are delayed in getting all recommended doses should finish their series by following the recommended catch-up schedule.\n\nMost adults have likely already been vaccinated against poliovirus during childhood. However, if you have never been vaccinated against polio you should get 3 doses of IPV:\n\nThe first dose at any time\n\nThe second dose 1 to 2 months later\n\nThe third dose 6 to 12 months after the second\n\nAnyone not fully vaccinated. If you have had 1 or 2 doses of polio vaccine before, you should get the remaining 1 or 2 doses.\n\nPeople at risk. If you are fully vaccinated but at increased risk of poliovirus exposure, you may receive 1 lifetime booster dose of IPV.\n\nIf you plan to travel outside the U.S.‎\n\nPeople who will be traveling to a country where the risk of getting polio is greater should be vaccinated against polio well before leaving for their trip. If a child cannot complete the routine series before leaving, a polio accelerated schedule is recommended.\n\nWhy getting vaccinated is important\n\nPolio vaccination protects you child from:\n\nGetting polio, a potentially serious disease.\n\nDeveloping lifelong paralysis from polio.\n\nThe risk of lifelong paralysis is very serious. Even children who seem to fully recover can later develop new muscle pain, weakness, or paralysis as adults. This can occur 15 to 40 years later.\n\nAbout 2 to 10 children out of 100 who have paralysis from polio die. This is because the virus affects the muscles that help them breathe.\n\nPolio can be brought into the U.S.\n\nThanks to a successful vaccination program, most people in the United States are protected from polio. However, people who are not vaccinated or who haven't received all recommended doses may be at risk of getting polio. The disease still occurs in other parts of the world. It only takes one person with polio traveling from another country to bring polio into the United States.\n\nWho should get vaccinated\n\nInfants and children\n\nAs part of routine childhood immunization, all children in the United States should get IPV to protect against polio. This includes children who have not started their polio vaccine series or who are delayed in getting all recommended doses. People who plan to travel internationally should make sure they and their children are fully vaccinated against polio before departure.\n\nAdults\n\nMost adults have likely already been vaccinated against poliovirus during childhood. However, if you know or suspect that you are unvaccinated or incompletely vaccinated you should receive polio vaccination.\n\nSituations that put adults at increased risk of exposure to poliovirus include:\n\nYou are traveling to a country where there is a documented increased risk of exposure to poliovirus. Ask your healthcare provider if you need to be vaccinated.\n\nYou are working in a laboratory or healthcare setting and handling specimens that might contain polioviruses.\n\nYou are a healthcare worker or caregiver who has close contact with a person who could be infected with poliovirus.\n\nPublic health authorities have identified you as being part of a group or population at increased risk of exposure because of an outbreak.\n\nWho shouldn't get vaccinated\n\nCheck with your healthcare provider if your child has:\n\nA severe (life-threatening) allergic reaction to a dose of IPV.\n\nA severe (life threatening) allergy to any component of IPV. Ask your health care provider if you want information about vaccine components.\n\nPeople who are moderately or severely ill should wait to get the vaccine until they recover. These include infants with moderate or severe diarrhea or vomiting. If you have a mild illness, such as a cold, they can probably get the vaccine today.\n\nThe vaccine is safe and effective\n\nIPV protects against severe disease caused by poliovirus in almost everyone who has received all the recommended doses.\n\nTwo doses of IPV provide at least 90% protection.\n\nThree doses of IPV provide at least 99% protection.\n\nPossible side effects\n\nThere is a chance of side effects, but they are usually mild and go away on their own. Serious reactions are also possible.\n\nSome people get a sore spot where the shot was given. IPV has not been known to cause serious problems, and most people do not have any problems with it.\n\nSome problems that could happen after getting this vaccine:\n\nPeople sometimes faint after a medical procedure, including vaccination. Sitting or lying down for about 15 minutes can help prevent fainting and injuries caused by a fall. Tell your healthcare provider if you feel dizzy or have vision changes or ringing in the ears after you get the shot.\n\nSome people get more severe and lasting shoulder pain than the typical soreness that can follow injections. This happens very rarely.\n\nFinding and paying for the vaccine\n\nYour or your child’s doctor’s office is usually the best place to receive recommended vaccines. Vaccines may also be available at pharmacies, workplaces, community health clinics, health departments, schools, or religious centers.\n\nKeep Reading: Where to Find Vaccines\n\nVaccine costs\n\nThere are a few ways to cover the cost of vaccines:\n\nHealth insurance\n\nMost health insurance plans cover the cost of vaccines. However, you may want to check with your insurance provider before going to a healthcare provider. Check for cost information and for a list of in-network vaccine providers.\n\nVaccines for Children Program\n\nYour children may be able to get no-cost vaccines through the Vaccines for Children (VFC) Program. This program helps families of eligible children who may not be able to afford or have access to vaccines."
