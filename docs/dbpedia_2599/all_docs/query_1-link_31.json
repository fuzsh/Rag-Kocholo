        "text": "Ninety percent of global warming is occurring in the ocean, causing the water’s internal heat to increase since modern recordkeeping began in 1955, as shown in the upper chart. (The shaded blue region indicates the 95% margin of uncertainty.) This chart shows annual estimates for the first 2,000 meters of ocean depth.\n\nEach data point in the upper chart represents a five-year average. For example, the 2021 value represents the average change in ocean heat content (since 1955) for the years 2019 up to and including 2023.\n\nThe lower chart tracks monthly changes in ocean heat content for the entire water column (from the top to the bottom of the ocean) from 1992 to 2023, integrating observations from satellites, in-water instruments, and computer models. Both charts are expressed in zettajoules.\n\nHeat stored in the ocean causes its water to expand, which is responsible for one-third to one-half of global sea level rise. Most of the added energy is stored at the surface, at a depth of zero to 700 meters. The last 10 years were the ocean’s warmest decade since at least the 1800s. The year 2023 was the ocean’s warmest recorded year.\n\nAbout the NOAA Data\n\nAbout the NASA ECCO Data\n\nInstruments That Measure Ocean Heat\n\nArgo floats\n\nConductivity, Temperature, Depth (CTDs)"
