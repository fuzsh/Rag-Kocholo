        "text": "Seven days after every king tide, Greg Savige gets on his jet ski to look for algae.\n\nHe rides along the shores of Pumicestone Passage and Deception Bay, on the northern edge of the Moreton Bay Marine Park.\n\nThe fisherman has been doing this for 20 years.\n\nNow the toxic algae Lyngbya is mostly small black tufts on the seabed, but he remembers when it spread across the bay in blooms up to 40 kilometres wide.\n\nIt would get stuck in his nets and irritate his skin, and if he let it dry, it would become airborne dust that would burn his lungs and throat.\n\nHe remembers the sulphur smell when it washed up and rotted in a snotty mess on the shore.\n\nThe blooms were caused by sediment and nutrients fed into the bay by farming, mining and housing development in south-east Queensland.\n\nExperts say there's a risk of Lyngbya blanketing the bay once more.\n\nLyngbya is a cyanobacteria, an ancient photosynthesising algae that doubles in size roughly every five days.\n\n\"Cyanobacteria is a very primitive group,\" Professor Michele Burford from Griffith University says.\n\n\"They often bloom in freshwater, but this particular species forms a big clotty, slimy black mat that grows in the marine environment.\"\n\nThe monthly tests by Mr Savige are used to map the growth of Lyngbya by academics like Dr Burford.\n\nShe says Lyngybya is \"a natural part of the ecosystem\" in the bay, but nitrogen, phosphorus and iron from development in the catchment feeds it, so it grows far bigger than it would in a healthy ecosystem.\n\n\"In recent years, with all the nutrient inputs and the sediment inputs we are getting, we're seeing the blooms more and more frequently and over broader areas,\" Dr Burford says.\n\n'It was just this weed that burnt us'\n\nSummers of the 1990s and 2000s were marked by Lyngbya blooms that carpeted seagrass beds in a layer of toxic sludge, choking the fishing industry and closing swimming beaches in Moreton Bay.\n\nMr Savige says his catches were down by two-thirds.\n\nLoading...\n\n\"We couldn't work in the area.\"\n\nThey called it fire weed.\n\nLyngbya can smother seagrass and destroys the marine habitat, and there are also signs the toxins it produces cause tumours to grow on sea turtles, Dr Burford says.\n\nLyngbya could grow to the size seen in the 2000s again, she adds.\n\n\"It depends on how much [storm] run-off we've had … how warm it is, how calm it is — a combination of factors have to come together,\" she says.\n\nLegislation 'locks in damage'\n\nOver the years commercial fishers have been pushed out of the bay in the name of conservation, but run-off from construction continues to debilitate the ecosystem beneath the surface.\n\nEvery development must have an erosion and sediment control plan, but there is evidence that just 15 per cent of development sites across the region are fully compliant with their plans, according to a recent audit.\n\nAn Ecofutures report, published today by the Moreton Bay Foundation, says laws aimed at limiting sediment run-off from developments \"effectively 'lock in' damage\", even on well managed sites.\n\n\"Despite 20 years of dedication … there is no evidence that annual sediment loads have declined,\" it said.\n\nCouncil and state representatives told Ecofutures \"a lack of enforcement of construction sites [are] a key gap in achieving a reduction in sediments\".\n\nDr Andrew O'Neill is the chief scientist for the non-governmental organisation Healthy Land & Water, which is funded to report on water quality in the catchment.\n\n\"We had a big flood in 1974. Then it was several decades until we had the next big one in 2011, and we've had about four or five in the last decade.\n\n\"So, the frequency of those is increasing.\"\n\nHe says in dry years, sediment comes from the \"existing or developing urban\" footprint.\n\nIn wet years, sediment trapped in the upper catchment — stirred up in waterways by farming, cattle grazing and historical development — comes rushing down from the hills, picking up sediment from farmland, creek bed erosion and urban areas along the way.\n\n\"There's not really a difference between that sediment and the sediment in the urban area, but there's just so much more of it in a wet year,\" Dr O'Neill says.\n\n\"It just completely dwarfs the urban sediment in those wet years.\"\n\nA V8 running on two cylinders\n\nDr Ben Diggles is a marine biologist and aquatic animal health specialist who has lived on Moreton Bay his entire life.\n\nHe says there has been a \"shifting baseline\" of what is considered a healthy ecosystem in the bay.\n\n\"For most recent generations, what we consider to be normal in the bay, is actually a highly modified system,\" he says.\n\n\"If you compare the original ecosystem to a V8 engine, today it's essentially running on one or two cylinders instead of all eight.\"\n\nIt's hard to imagine what the first white settlers would have seen when they first started colonising the region in 1824.\n\nClear blue water. A twisting river, far shallower than the Brisbane River — known colloquially as the Brown Snake — that weaves through the CBD today.\n\nA waterway that shifted and changed with time, expanding and contracting over its flood plain.\n\nDr Diggles says shellfish, particularly oysters, had a key role in that ecosystem.\n\n\"A little over 100 years ago there were thousands and thousands of hectares of shellfish reef habitat in waters as deep as six to eight metres,\" he says.\n\n\"The sheltered banks where the freshwater meets with the salt, were covered in shellfish — in oysters.\"\n\nNinety-five per cent of those oysters are gone.\n\nDr Diggles says those earlier reefs are buried \"under several feet of mud\".\n\nThe old oyster shells from the long-buried reefs are thicker and larger than today's oyster shells — a sign of a healthier ecosystem.\n\nGovernment blocking oyster reef restoration\n\nOysters filter between three and 10 litres of water an hour, which Dr Diggles says \"actually cleans up the bay\".\n\n\"They provide a lot of habitat and surface area for other invertebrates and shrimps and crabs, which are fish food,\" he says.\n\n\"They actually build the bottom end of the food chain.\"\n\nA reef restoration trial by Dr Diggles in Pumicestone Passage — between Bribie Island and the mainland — found sediment and algae disrupted the \"recruitment\" phase of the oyster reproductive process.\n\nThe tiny planktonic oyster larvae need to settle on the rocks or mature oyster shells to grow, but the sediment and algae stops them from latching.\n\nBecause of this, reefs can't form.\n\nDr Diggles's work found rebuilding shellfish reefs in the bay is possible if clean shells are added at the right time of year.\n\nEven small oyster reefs produced a large number of invertebrates and increased the number of fish 16-fold in the area over three years, according to the trial.\n\nThere still aren't projects like this in Moreton Bay Marine Park, although similar work is being attempted nearby.\n\n\"The issue in Moreton Bay is the vast majority of the bay is in Moreton Bay Marine Park, and in the marine park, shellfish reef restoration is currently banned — it's not permitted,\" Dr Diggles says.\n\nA spokesperson for the Department of Environment, Science and Innovations (DESI) says they are \"in the process of creating policy and guidelines to inform future shellfish reef restoration projects\", and recently funded a Griffith University project mapping remaining shellfish reefs in the bay.\n\nThe department is also a member of the Moreton Bay Shellfish Reef Restoration Reference Group, which is made up of key stakeholders led by Healthy Land & Water.\n\nThe struggle to bring oysters back to the bay just one part of undoing the damage done by development, Dr Diggles says.\n\n\"It's really up to us in the wider community to give it a helping hand,\" he says.\n\n\"The government's shown that they'll prioritise development over everything else. They've made that very clear.\""
