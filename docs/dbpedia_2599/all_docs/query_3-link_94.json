        "text": "Miller High Life, also known as the Champagne of Beers, is a quintessentially classic, American-style lager. In 1903, Frederick Miller created Miller High Life because he believed that the good life, the High Life, should be accessible to everyone, not just the upper crust. To this day, Miller High Life continues to be faithfully brewed as a golden pilsner, utilizing light-stable galena hops from the Pacific Northwest and a select combination of malted barley."
