        "text": "Miller High Life is getting all dressed up for the holiday season.\n\nThe companyâs Champagne of Beers is relaunching its champagne-sized 750-ml. bottles for another year.\n\nâReception was so good across the country last year that it was a no-brainer to bring it back for 2019,â Nigel Jones, the marketing manager for the Miller family of brands, said. âThe attention our distinctive champagne bottle commands not only is a great marketing tool to boost brand equity, but it gets the Champagne of Beers into more holiday moments.â\n\nFeaturing an updated design for 2019, the bottles feature necks wrapped in gold foil sealed with the Girl in the Moon logo, as well as the words âThe Champagne of Beersâ in raised glass letters, and a slight diagonal orientation framed in gold and green, the company said.\n\nâEven though beer remains the top-selling category over the holiday season, wine and spirits have an outsized influence at retail,â Jones said. âOur champagne bottle program opens that door and gets us on the floor during a time of year when we werenât really getting there before.â\n\nIn addition, Miller High Life will send select bars and restaurants branded champagne coupe glassware that can be used for building Champagne of Beer towers to add a bit of retail theater to celebrations, the company said.\n\nâMost drinkers know what High Life is and what we stand for, but we need to let them know why weâre special,â Jones said. âThis is one way in that gets people talking about us again.â\n\nThose in New York City are also in for a special treat. During the second week of December, a custom champagne bottle vending machine stocked with 150 bottles at each new location will be making its way around the city. The bottles will be free to consumers on a first-come, first-serve basis.\n\nâPeople are pumped when they see them, and it makes them want to go out and buy a couple,â Jones added. âAs soon as these bottles start hitting the floor, we see a ton of excitement and a flood of photos on social media. The rule of thumb is that if you see it once, jump on it because it tends to sell out quickly.â"
