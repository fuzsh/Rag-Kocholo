        "text": "High Life (2019) is a sci-fi thriller from legendary French filmmaker Claire Denis. It stars Robert Pattinson and Juliette Binoche in the story of a group of criminals sent on a dangerous space mission while being sexually experimented upon. The film has been in the works for over a decade and has finally hit the big screen with big-name distributor A24. Is it worth the wait?\n\nI was thoroughly unfamiliar with the director’s filmography coming into High Life, which can work for and against me as a viewer. On one hand, I didn’t have any preconceptions or expectations going in and was able to analyze the film on its own merits rather than trying to compare it to the filmmaker’s previous work. On the other hand, I run the risk of being completely lost as I’m not used to the director’s visual and narrative style. The latter was very much the case for my first foray into Claire Denis, who commands a very precise and unique style to filmmaking. Jarring imagery, minimal dialogue, and an emphasis on editing as a storytelling device. I imagine this is how many people felt watching Climax as their first experience with Gaspar Noé. Looks like A24 is branching out into the avant-garde!\n\nWhile I was barely able to cling to the plot at times, the film did raise some interesting themes and ideas that left me thinking afterwards. Denis paints a grim picture of the apocalypse, with humans at each other’s throats and picking each other off one by one. Sexuality is explored in-depth, as Binoche’s Dr. Dibs enforces strict abstinence rules and attempts to create life through artificial insemination. There’s an interesting counter-intuitive dynamic to the members of the ship, where the women are shackled to their beds while the men are permitted to roam free. Is Denis using this as a message about the way our society actually functions? Men are free to choose their prey while women are powerless and have to wait for mates to come to them? Furthermore, the film upends the power dynamic with Dr. Dibs in control over the relatively docile men, coercing them into submission by dangling the promise of return to Earth if they behave. Is this yet another commentary on the way societal pressure is the only thing standing between men and their next “conquest”?\n\nDenis uses an odd, non-linear story structure to weave her tale. It’s essentially a tale in three halves where we watch Part 2 first, then 1, then 3. We follow Robert Pattinson’s Monte as he must raise his infant daughter on the deserted ship. We get fragments of information about what led to this situation, until we finally get to hear the full thing. Then we learn the ultimate fates of him and his daughter. I like this idea in theory, as it creates tension and mystery to get the audience invested, but in practice it was very difficult to follow along with the shifting timelines. Since this is such an esoteric and complex story that needs explaining, there are some necessary exposition sequences to get the audience up to speed. But because of Denis’s minimalist style, she prefers to jam this information into as compact a moment as possible so we can get back to the world of abstraction. And when she does try to use minimalism to convey important information, you blink and you miss it. It wasn’t until after I left the theater and read a plot summary that I was able to pinpoint the importance of certain scenes that I missed in the moment. I respect Denis enough as a filmmaker not to call that a mistake, but you do need to throw the audience a bone every once in a while.\n\nMuch like Adam McKay in recent years, Denis likes to use editing and juxtaposition to make her points. Jump cuts, sudden unannounced time shifts, and other classic no-nos are utilized to convey her messages about humanity. She wants the audience on their toes at all times, never comfortable in a moment, prepared to have to take a leap along with her to follow along. I respect that technique in the abstract, but here it’s taken to the extreme, making it incredibly difficult and tiresome to stay on the same page. Take one scene, one shot to take a breather and you risk missing something critical. I had to fight myself not to check out midway through the film; if I was watching this at home, I would have certainly paused multiple times to take a small break. My theater was about 3/4 full of (mostly older) theater-goers, and 8-10 of them left halfway through the film. And who can blame them? This is not for the faint of heart, and I’m frankly shocked that so many people were interested in the film in the first place.\n\nThe film is highly upsetting at nearly every turn, creating a number of sequences that are not for the squeamish or easily offended. If you’re put off by constant images of rape, assault, murder, grief, gore, claustrophobia, suffering, and general despair, this movie might not be for you. I’ve just about seen it all when it comes to film so not much makes me squirm these days, but when it’s just pounded into you over and over without reprieve (no pun intended), it can really wear you down. Critics have noted the difference between this film and similar films like Interstellar which, other than the massive budget, has a decidedly optimistic viewpoint on the continuation of life in the solar system. High Life is less interested in humanity’s future than its present, and uses the sci-fi setting as an excuse to explore the human condition and all its ugliness. Space is not an escape path for humans, Denis posits…it’s reflective of humanity’s true future: cold emptiness and death.\n\nThe technical side of things is generally fine. Robert Pattinson is slowly becoming one of the most interesting actors in Hollywood, choosing strong roles for himself that have helped him shed his Twilight pretty-boy persona. (And as a coincidence, I saw Personal Shopper for the first time the other day with Kristen Stewart doing something similar for her career!) Juliette Binoche gives a dreary but emotionally packed performance, conveying deep pain, repression, and longing. The other actors are solid but mostly unexciting. The editing, as I’ve mentioned before, was erratic and disorienting, though largely by design, so it’s hard to criticize it for making me uncomfortable. The visual effects, minimal as they were, were a highlight; the black hole imagery was crafted by experts and artists, and the timing ended up being perfect with the first images of the real thing being published by NASA not two days ago! Despite my qualms with Denis’s visual style, the film looks pretty damn good for a micro-budget contained thriller.\n\nConclusion\n\nClaire Denis is clearly a master filmmaker who prefers to challenge her audience, but even I as a seasoned cinephile had problems keeping up with her. Part of that is on me, but at the same time, I feel the form didn’t match the function and some of the film’s complexities were lost in the shuffle. It’s also a rather bleak affair with a pessimistic outlook on humanity, which is her prerogative as a filmmaker to explore but a thoroughly depressing viewing experience as a result. It left me with a bad taste in my mouth and I didn’t particularly enjoy the hour and fifty minutes that I spent in that theater. Still, it’s well-acted and well-shot with some interesting ideas, and it at least gave me some food for thought, even if the food was rather rotten.\n\nIs it fair for me to criticize a film for depressing me and wearing me down? Let me know if I’m in the wrong for disliking this just because it succeeded in disarming me. I respect Denis for it, even if it isn’t my cup of tea.\n\nVERDICT: C-\n\n-Austin Daniel\n\nAll image rights belong to A24."
