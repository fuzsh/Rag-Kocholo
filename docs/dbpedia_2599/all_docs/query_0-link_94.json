Yet the road to global peace and security has become even more complex. Global forced displacement is at an all-time high, exceeding 110 million people forced to flee from persecution, conflict, violence and human rights violations as of May 2023. Between 2022 and 2023, civilian casualties experienced the highest spike since the adoption of the 2030 Agenda. Persistent threats to human security across the globe underscore the breakdown of peaceful and inclusive societies, crucial for sustainable development and the need to restore trust and strengthen and renew global peace and security frameworks to heed the desperate pleas for peace from countless voices worldwide.\n\nTarget 16.1: o The global homicide rate gradually decreased, falling from 5.9 victims per 100,000 population in 2015 to 5.5 in 2020. However, this trend was disrupted in 2021, with a sharp rise to 5.8 victims per 100,000 population, only slightly decreasing to 5.6 in 2022. High levels of violence linked to organized crime and gang activities in Latin America and the Caribbean, along with Africa's heightened vulnerability to homicide, continue to contribute to these regions having the highest homicide rates and numbers globally.\n\no The number of civilian deaths in armed conflict skyrocketed in 2023. Between 2022 and 2023, civilian casualties increased by 72%, the highest increase since 2015. In 2023, seven out of ten recorded deaths occurred in the Occupied Palestinian Territory and Israel. Moreover, for the second consecutive year, the number of civilians killed in conflict has risen dramatically; reversing the downward trend between 2016 and 2019. By 2023, the number of civilian casualties had risen to over 33,400, almost matching the peak of 2015. By 2023, four out of every ten civilians killed in conflicts were women, and three in ten civilians killed were children, doubling and tripling, respectively, the previous year’s proportion.\n\no Data on experience of violence, remain limited outside of Europe and Northern America and Latin America and the Caribbean. Available data show women and men are not impacted by the same type of violence. The median prevalence of sexual violence in countries with data is 3.0% for women compared to just 0.8% for men. However, the median prevalence of physical violence is 3.0% for men compared to 2.1% for women.\n\nTarget 16.2: Violent discipline is the most common and widespread form of violence against children. In 82 (mostly low- and middle-income) countries with available data from 2015 to 2023, nearly 8 in 10 children from 1 to 14 years of age were subjected to some form of psychological aggression and/or physical punishment at home in the past month.\n\nTarget 16.3: o Available data for 53 countries for the period 2010-2022 shows that the proportion of victims of physical assault and robbery in the previous 12 months that reported their victimization to competent authorities, shows a median proportion in countries with data of 36% and 45%, respectively. This is notably higher than the proportion of victims of sexual assault that reported their victimization, for which the median in countries with available data was of 17%.\n\no Globally, the estimated number of persons in detention was 11.4 million in 2022, representing a prison-population rate of 142 prisoners per 100,000 population. In 2022, nearly a third (3.5 million) of the global prison population was being held in pre-trial detention and their share remained stable between 2015 and 2022 (around 30%).\n\nTarget 16.5: Based on data from 138 countries between 2015 and 2022, 19% of people who had contact with public officials in the last 12 months reported being asked to pay or paid a bribe to a public official. Regional differences range from an average of 32% in low-income countries to 9% in high-income countries.\n\nTarget 16.6: Budget reliability improved in 2021 and 2022, reaching an average of 13.5% compared with 15.3 % in 2020 but remained weaker than pre-pandemic levels with 10.6% on average. In part, this is due to the incidence of new international challenges including global political stresses, inflation and resource price volatility.\n\nTarget 16.7: The overall representation of people under the age of 45 or less in parliaments is increasing globally but with contrasting trends: a rise in developing countries and a decline in developed ones. Moreover, growth in women’s share of parliamentary leadership posts continues to be slow-moving, albeit steady. As of 1 January 2024, women presided over 23.8% of parliaments as Speakers (an increase of 2.9 percentage points since 2021) and held 27.2% of committee chair posts.\n\nTarget 16.9: While a few regions like Northern America and Europe and Australia and New Zealand have achieved universal birth registration, only half of African children under five have had their births registered.\n\nTarget 16.10: o The number of killings of human rights defenders, journalists, and trade unionists recorded by national human rights institutions and the United Nations decreased in 2023; to 320 cases in 40 countries, compared to 448 cases in 36 countries in 2022. In conflict zones, however, there was a sharp increase in journalists and media workers killed – 40 lives lost – reversing the downward trend since 2017. Additionally, enforced disappearances have been nearly doubling for the second consecutive year, with at least 54 cases reported across 14 countries in 2023. Strong protection frameworks are therefore needed to stem this trend, particularly in countries where violent conflict or social unrest erupts or escalates.\n\no In 2024, 140 countries had laws that specifically guaranteed the rights of citizens to access public information, up from 105 in 2015 and 14 in 1990.\n\nTarget 16.a: Between 2015 and 2023, the number of countries with independent national human rights institutions (NHRIs) meeting international standards increased by 23%. More than 40% of countries now have independent NHRIs.\n\nOngoing and new violent conflicts around the world are derailing a global path to peace and achievement of SDG 16. Onequarter of humanity lives in conflict-affected areas and as of May 2022, a record 100 million people had been forcibly displaced worldwide--more than double the number a decade ago. Citizens also face challenges accessing justice, basic services/legal guarantees and are generally underrepresented due to ineffective institutions. Moreover, structural injustices, inequalities and emerging human rights challenges are putting peaceful and inclusive societies further out of reach. To meet SDG16 by 2030, action is needed to restore trust and to strengthen the capacity of institutions to secure justice for all and facilitate transitions to drive sustainable development.\n\nGlobally, about 457,000 people were victims of homicide in 2021— the highest number of victims in the last 20 years. The noticeable spike in killings in 2021 can be partly attributed to the economic repercussions of COVID-related restrictions, as well as an escalation of gang-related and socio-political violence in several countries. The homicide rate was 5.8 per 100,000 population, marginally lower than in 2015 (at 5.9 per 100,000). Men and boys represent about 80% of victims and 90% of suspects.\n\nIn 2022, the United Nations recorded 16,988 killings of civilians in armed conflicts: a 53% increase compared to 2021, and the first increase since the adoption of the 2030 Agenda. Four out of ten deaths occurred in Ukraine. One in five was a woman. The proportion of deaths by heavy weapons and explosive munitions increased significantly, from 13% in 2021 to 39% in 2022, in contrast to the steady decline over the previous five years.\n\nBased on survey data from 114 countries, on average, approximately 69% of the population report feeling safe or very safe walking alone around the area in which they live after dark, a figure that has remained stable over the period 2016-2021. Women continue to feel significantly less safe than men.\n\nIn 75 countries (mostly low- and middle-income) with available data from 2014 to 2022, 8 in 10 children aged 1-14 years were subjected to some form of psychological aggression and/or physical punishment at home in the previous month. In 70 of these countries, at least half of children experience violent discipline on a regular basis.\n\nIn 2020, the number of trafficking victims detected worldwide fell for the first time in 20 years, as COVID-19 preventive measures changed the dynamics of exploitation while compromising anti-trafficking responses. As more victims are likely to remain undetected, increasing efforts are needed to tailor responses to the real prevalence of the crime.\n\nFor the period 2014-2021, only 55 countries (mostly low- and middleincome) have internationally comparable data on sexual violence in childhood against girls and only 12 have produced such data for boys. Across regions with representative estimates, the prevalence of sexual violence in childhood (by age 18) among young women aged 18–29 years ranges from 1% in Central and Southern Asia to 7% in Oceania (excluding Australia and New Zealand).\n\nIn 2021, the global prison population was 11.2 million, remaining relatively stable between 2015 and 2021, except for a temporary decline between 2019 and 2020. Some 3.4 million of all prisoners are unsentenced detainees and their share among all prisoners has remained at around 30% between 2015 and 2021 and far from the target of equal access to justice for all.\n\nWhile tracing is a key measure in the process of investigating and disclosing the origins of illicit firearms, its systematic implementation remains a global challenge. On average, Member States with available data successfully traced one-third of seized weapons that are potentially traceable between 2016 and 2021.\n\nGlobally, approximately 1 in 7 (15%) businesses face requests for bribe payments by public officials, based on establishment-level data from 154 countries surveyed during 2006-2023.\n\nMultiple crises undermine budget credibility across all regions. The average budget deviations compared to the approved budget decreased from 5- 10% in 2015 to the target of less than 5% in 2019. However, budget credibility deteriorated and reached a deviation of almost 10% for some regions in 2020 - 2021.\n\nIn every region of the world except Europe, people under the age of 45 are significantly underrepresented in parliament relative to their share of the national populations.\n\nBy providing all children with proof of legal identity from day one, their rights can be protected and universal access to justice and social services can be enabled. In 2022 the births of around 1 in 4 children under age 5 worldwide have never been officially recorded. Only half of the children under five years of age in sub-Saharan Africa have had their births registered.\n\nAccess to information (ATI) laws provide legal guarantees of the right to information and were adopted by 136 countries in 2022, up from 105 in 2015.\n\nSource: Progress towards the Sustainable Development Goals: Towards a Rescue Plan for People and Planet - Report of the Secretary-General (Special Edition)\n\nPleas for global peace are growing louder as the world witnesses the highest number of violent conflicts since 1945, with approximately 2 billion people living in conflict-affected countries by the end of 2020. Amid these crises and despite movement restrictions arising from the COVID-19 pandemic, forced displacement has continued to occur and even grow. By the end of 2020, 82.4 million people had been forcibly displaced worldwide, which means that 1 in 95 persons has currently been forcibly displaced. These numbers will increase, as the war in Ukraine is estimated to have already displaced over 7 million people in the country. The costs of war and conflict are high, affecting the poorest and most vulnerable the most and leading to global impacts and escalating humanitarian needs.\n\nGlobally, about 437,000 people were victims of homicide in 2020. Between 2015 and 2020, the global homicide rate declined by 5.2 per cent (from 5.9 homicides per 100,000 population to 5.6 per 100,000). Women and girls are disproportionately impacted by lethal violence in the home and account for about 60 per cent of all homicide victims killed by intimate partners or other family members.\n\nThe United Nations recorded at least 11,075 civilian conflict-related deaths in 12 of the world’s deadliest armed conflicts in 2021. This translates into 4.1 civilians per 100,000 population; one in eight of those deaths was the death of a woman or child. Compared with 2020, the number of deaths decreased by 26 per cent and by 80 per cent compared with 2015. Despite the overall reduction, many of these situations are fragile, with ongoing and growing risks of escalation and associated violations of international human rights and international humanitarian law. As at 12 April 2022, the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights had recorded the killing of 1,932 civilians in the conflict in Ukraine and the actual figure is considerably higher.\n\nBased on survey data from 114 countries, on average, approximately 69 per cent of the population report feeling safe or very safe walking alone around the area in which E/2022/55 22-06472 23/25 they live after dark, a figure that has remained stable over the period 2016–2021. Women continue to feel significantly less safe than men.\n\nViolence against children is widespread, affecting children regardless of wealth or social status. In 76 countries (mostly low- and middle-income countries) with available data from 2013 to 2021, 8 in 10 children aged 1–14 years were subjected to some form of psychological aggression and/or physical punishment at home in the previous month.\n\nIn 2018, for every 10 victims of human trafficking detected globally, about 5 were adult women and 2 were girls. About one third of the overall number of detected victims were children. The sharp increase in unemployment rates brought about by the COVID-19 pandemic is likely to increase trafficking in persons. Ukrainian refugees, mostly women and children, are particularly at risk of human trafficking and exploitation.\n\nOnly 60 countries (mostly low- and middle-income countries) have internationally comparable data on sexual violence in childhood against girls and only 12 have produced such data for boys. Across regions with representative estimates in 2020, the prevalence of sexual violence in childhood among young women aged 18–29 years ranges from 2 per cent in Central and Southern Asia to 7 per cent in Oceania (excluding Australia and New Zealand).\n\nBy the end of 2020, 11.2 million people were held behind bars compared with just under 11.8 million people in 2019, representing the first decrease in the last two decades. This re-education can be attributed to various factors, including the emergency release of prisoners and reduced admissions of new detainees due to court delays or reduced crime and/or law enforcement activities during the period of the lockdown measures following the outbreak of the Covid-19 pandemic. However, the share of prisoners held in detention without being sentenced was roughly 1 in every 3 prisoners, the same share since 2000.\n\nOn average, Member States with available data successfully traced 2 per cent of seized potentially traceable weapons between 2016 and 2020. In 2018–2019, according to available data, national authorities destroyed on average 48 per cent of the weapons seized, found and surrendered.\n\nGlobally, almost 1 in 6 businesses faces requests for bribe payments by public officials, based on establishment-level data from 145 countries surveyed during 2006–2021.\n\nParliaments and their leaders have become younger and more gender-diverse in the past five years. Representation of youth (aged 45 years or under) stood at 28.1 per cent in 2018, climbed to 31.1 per cent in 2021 and then dropped to 30.2 per cent in 2022. While the proportion of women speakers rose gradually from 17.3 per cent in 2018 to 22 per cent in 2022, this continues to be below the global average proportion of women in parliament (26.1 per cent). The proportion of women committee chairs fell from 26.8 per cent in 2021 to 26.2 per cent in 2022. Male parliamentarians aged 46 years or over continue to dominate leadership positions in parliament, holding 71.8 per cent of speaker posts and 60.5 per cent of committee chairs.\n\nBy providing all children with proof of legal identity from day one, their rights can be protected and universal access to justice and social services can be enabled. Based on data for 2012–2021, however, the birth of about 1 in 4 children under 5 years of age worldwide today has never been officially recorded. Only half of children under 5 years of age in sub-Saharan Africa have had their birth registered.\n\nAccess to information laws had been adopted by 135 countries as of 2021, with at least 30 having adopted such guarantees since 2015. However, implementation of these guarantees could be improved. Out of 91 countries and territories with access to information laws, only 4 per cent had data in 2020 on the number of requests for information received, indicating that some difficulties had been faced by public bodies with respect to treating and following up access to information requests during the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nProgress in establishing or strengthening national human rights institutions decelerated in 2021. On average, there were four applications for accreditation by new national human rights institutions every year for the period 2015–2017 compared with only one new application for national human rights institution accreditation per year for the period 2018–2021. Only 43 per cent of countries currently benefit from independent national human rights institutions.\n\nSource: Progress Towards Sustainable Development Goals- Report of the Secretary-General\n\nFor more information, please, check: https://unstats.un.org/sdgs/report/2022/\n\nThe world is still a long way from achieving the goal of building peaceful, just and inclusive societies, with millions of people living in fragile and conflict-affected States. At the end of 2019, 79.5 million people had been forcibly displaced worldwide, equivalent to 1 per cent of the global population. The COVID-19 pandemic has exposed inequalities and discrimination and has tested, weakened, and in some cases shattered rights and protection systems in countries and territories.\n\nGlobally, around 437,000 people were victims of homicide in 2019. However, lethal violence is slowly decreasing, and homicide rates declined from 6 v ictims per 100,000 population in 2015 to 5.7 per 100,000 in 2019. Two thirds of all homicide victims were in sub-Saharan Africa and Latin America and the Caribbean, with no sign of numbers falling in sub-Saharan Africa.\n\nThe United Nations recorded 69,276 civilian deaths in 12 of the world’s deadliest armed conflicts between 2018 and 2020. In 2020, there were five civilians killed per 100,000 population, one in seven of which was a woman or child.\n\nEven before the pandemic, violence against children was widespread, affecting victims regardless of wealth or social status. In 77 mostly low- and middle-income countries and territories with available data from 2012 to 2020, 8 in 10 children, ranging from 1 to 14 years of age, had been subjected to some form of psychological aggression or physical punishment at home in the previous month.\n\nIn 2018, some 5 in 10 victims of human trafficking detected globally were women and 2 in 10 were girls. Moreover, about one third of all detected victims wer e children. About 50 per cent of the detected victims were trafficked for sexual exploitation and 38 per cent for forced labour. The sharp rise in unemployment brought about by the pandemic is likely to increase trafficking in persons.\n\nGlobally, the proportion of prisoners held in detention in 2019 without being sentenced for a crime remained high at 31 per cent of the total prison population, with no significant change since 2000.\n\nData from more than 120 countries and territories indicate that people living in low-income countries and territories are those most exposed to bribery. According to the latest data available for the period from 2011 to 2020, the average prevalence of bribery in low-income countries and territories is 37.6 per cent, compared to 7.2 per cent in high-income countries and territories.\n\nEstablishment-level data from 145 countries and territories surveyed between 2006 and 2020 indicate that almost one business in six around the world is subject to requests from public officials for bribe payments.\n\nGlobally as of January 2021, 31.1 per cent of parliamentarians are 45 years of age or less, up from 28.1 per cent in 2018. Male parliamentarians remain predominant in the leadership positions of speaker and committee chair.\n\nAccording to data for the period from 2010 to 2020, the births of around one in four children under 5 years of age worldwide were not officially recorded. Only 45 per cent of all children under 5 in sub-Saharan Africa had their births registered\n\nIn 2020, the United Nations tracked 331 killings of human rights defenders in 32 countries and territories, an 18 per cent increase on 2019, and 19 enforced disappearances in 14 countries and territories. Women comprised 13 per cent of victims killed and 22 per cent of those forcibly disappeared. A total of 62 journalists were killed in 2020 compared to 57 in 2019, with 65 per cent killed in non-conflict countries and territories.\n\nAs of February 2021, laws on access to information have been adopted by 127 countries and territories, although the implementation of the laws could be improved. The pandemic has slowed the pace of progress in this area, with no countries or territories passing such laws in 2020 and a number of countries and territories temporarily suspending existing legal guarantees. Nevertheless, many countries and territories attempted to make data available concerning COVID-19 infections, the contracting of emergency equipment and the allocation of rescue packages and relief financing.\n\nIn 2020, the number of independently functioning national human rights institutions in sub-Saharan Africa and Europe increased by three, raising the proportion of countries and territories that had successfully achieved compliance with the Principles and Guidelines on Children Associated with Armed Forces or Armed Groups to 42 per cent. However, progress has stalled in Latin America and the Caribbean, Oceania, Western Asia, and Eastern and South-Eastern Asia, where no new independent national human rights institutions have been recognized or established since 2018.\n\nSource: Progress towards the Sustainable Development Goals – E/2021/58\n\nConflict, insecurity, weak institutions and limited access to justice remain a great threat to sustainable development. Millions of people have been deprived of their security, human rights and access to justice. In 2018, the number of people fleeing war, persecution and conflict exceeded 70 million, the highest level recorded by the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees in nearly 70 years. The pandemic is potentially leading to an increase in social unrest and violence, which would greatly undermine the world’s ability to meet the targets of Goal 16.\n\nThe global rate of homicide per 100,000 persons slowly declined, from 6.8 to 5.9 to 5.8 per cent in 2000, 2015 and 2018, respectively, corresponding to approximately 440,000 victims of homicide, 81 per cent of whom were men and 19 per cent of whom were women. Latin America and the Caribbean (33 per cent) and sub-Saharan Africa (36 per cent) accounted for more than two thirds of homicide victims globally.\n\nViolent forms of discipline targeted towards children were widespread. In 69 countries (mostly low- and middle-income ones) with available data from 2012 to 2019, nearly 8 in 10 children 1 to 14 years of age were subjected to some form of psychological aggression and/or physical punishment at home in the previous month.\n\nSexual violence is one of the most unsettling violations of children’s rights. In slightly more than one in four countries with comparable data from 2012 to 2019 (45 countries), at least 5 per cent of women between 18 and 29 years of age reported experiencing sexual violence in childhood.\n\nData from 2016 to 2018 show that the proportion of prisoners held in detention without being sentenced for a crime is 31 per cent, the same level as in 2005. Significant increases over the past three years were recorded in Asia and Oceania.\n\nData from 38 countries over the past decade suggest that high-income countries have the lowest prevalence of bribery (an average of 3.7 per cent), while lower-income countries bear the heaviest bribery burden when accessing public services (22.3 per cent).\n\nThrough the implementation of birth registration with proof of legal identity, children’s rights can be protected and universal access to justice and social services can be enabled. However, based on data from 2010 to 2019, the births of around one in four children under 5 years of age were never officially recorded. Fewer than half (44 per cent) of all children in sub-Saharan Africa under 5 years of age had their births registered.\n\nIn 2019, the United Nations tracked 357 killings (a decrease from 476 in 2018) and 30 enforced disappearances of human rights defenders, journalists and trade unionists in 47 countries.\n\nThe number of countries with binding laws and policies giving individuals a right to obtain access to information held by public authorities (the right to information) has continued to rise, reaching 127 in 2019. At least 43 countries have adopted such guarantees in the past 10 years, 40 per cent of them in Africa.\n\nIn 2019, 40 per cent of countries had a national human rights institution that had successfully achieved compliance with the principles relating to the status of national institutions for the promotion and protection of human rights (the Paris Principles). Access to internationally recognized national human rights institutions, however, remains overdue in 78 countries, in particular in Eastern and South-Eastern Asia, Latin America and the Caribbean, Oceania and sub-Saharan Africa.\n\nSource: Progress towards the Sustainable Development Goals, Report of the Secretary-General, https://undocs.org/en/E/2020/57\n\nAdvances in ending violence, promoting the rule of law, strengthening institutions and increasing access to justice are uneven and continue to deprive millions of their security, rights and opportunities and undermine the delivery of public services and broader economic development. Attacks on civil society are also holding back development progress. Renewed efforts are essential to move towards the achievement of Sustainable Development Goal 16.\n\nThe number of intentional homicides per 100,000 people increased from 6.0 in 2015 to 6.1 in 2017. This slight uptick was largely the result of an increase in the homicide rates in Latin America and the Caribbean and in some countries in sub-Saharan Africa.\n\nVarious forms of violence against children persist. In 83 countries (mostly from developing regions) with recent data on the subject, nearly 8 in 10 children from 1 to 14 years of age were subjected to some form of psychological aggression and/or physical punishment at home. In all but seven of these countries, at least half of children experienced violent disciplinary methods. Sexual violence is perhaps the most disturbing of children’s rights violations. Based on the limited data available, in 14 of 46 countries with comparable data, at least 5 per cent of women between the ages of 18 and 29 experienced sexual intercourse or other sexual acts that were forced, physically or in other ways, for the first time before they were 18 years of age.\n\nThere has been an overall increase in the detection of victims of trafficking in persons, which could reflect either a positive (enhanced efforts by authorities to identify victims) or negative (larger trafficking problem) development. In a departure from prior findings, recent data show that most trafficking victims were detected domestically: 58 per cent in 2016, up from 43 per cent in 2014. The vast majority (70 per cent) of detected victims of human trafficking were women and girls, most of whom were trafficked for sexual exploitation.\n\nThe share of unsentenced detainees in the overall prison population has remained largely constant at 30 per cent in recent years. This occurred in a context where the total prison population grew in absolute values while remaining constant as a share of the total population.\n\nKillings of human rights defenders, journalists and trade unionists are on the rise. From 2017 to 2018, the United Nations recorded and verified 431 killings across 41 countries. Every passing week saw at least eight people murdered at the front lines of efforts to build more inclusive and equal societies – a worrying increase from the previous average of one victim per day observed from 2015 to 2017. Ninety-nine journalists and bloggers were among the victims.\n\nBirth registration plays a primary role in ensuring individual rights and access to justice and social services. Even if many regions have reached universal or near universal birth registration, globally the average is just 73 per cent. Fewer than half (46 per cent) of all children under the age of 5 in sub-Saharan Africa have had their births registered.\n\nBinding laws and policies giving individuals a right to access information held by public authorities have been adopted by 125 countries, with at least 31 countries adopting such laws since 2013. Among the 123 countries for which data on the legal framework is available, 40 do not include the right to appeal to an independent administrative body, which has been assessed as key for the proper implementation of this right.\n\nThe pace of progress to put in place national human rights institutions compliant with the Paris Principles must be accelerated. In 2018, a total of 39 per cent of all countries had in place an institution that was fully compliant with the internationally agreed standard, seven countries more than was the case in 2015. If growth continues at the same rate, by 2030 only a little over one half (54 per cent) of all countries worldwide will have compliant national human rights institutions.\n\nThe difference between the approved and the implemented budget reflects a government’s ability to achieve development objectives, including delivering services to the public. Deviation between the approved and actual spending during the period 2006–2017 in 108 countries shows that actual spending was within plus or minus 5 per cent of the approved budget in about half of the countries. One out of 10 countries had a deviation of more than plus or minus 15 per cent. Almost half of low-income economies showed more than plus or minus 10 per cent deviation in budget execution.\n\nSource: Report of the Secretary-General, Special edition: progress towards the Sustainable Development Goals\n\nMany regions of the world continue to suffer untold horrors as a result of armed conflict or other forms of violence that occur within societies and at the domestic level. Advances in promoting the rule of law and access to justice are uneven. However, progress is being made in regulations to promote public access to information, albeit slowly, and in strengthening institutions upholding human rights at the national level.\n\nNearly 8 in 10 children aged 1 to 14 years were subjected to some form of psychological aggression and/or physical punishment on a regular basis at home in 81 countries (primarily developing), according to available data from 2005 to 2017. In all but seven of these countries, more than half of children experienced violent forms of discipline.\n\nMore than 570 different flows involving trafficking in persons were detected between 2012 and 2014, affecting all regions; many involved movement from lower-income to higher-income countries.\n\nIn 2014, the majority of detected trafficking victims were women and girls (71 per cent), and about 28 per cent were children (20 per cent girls and 8 per cent boys). Over 90 per cent of victims detected were trafficked for sexual exploitation or forced labour.\n\nThe proportion of prisoners held in detention without being sentenced for a crime remained almost constant in the last decade: from 32 per cent in 2003–2005 to 31 per cent in 2014–2016.\n\nAlmost one in five firms worldwide report receiving at least one bribery payment request when engaged in regulatory or utility transactions.\n\nGlobally, 73 per cent of children under 5 have had their births registered; the proportion is less than half (46 per cent) in sub-Saharan Africa.\n\nAt least 1,019 human rights defenders, journalists and trade unionists have been killed in 61 countries since 2015. This is equivalent to one person killed every day while working to inform the public and build a world free from fear and want.\n\nFreedom-of-information laws and policies have been adopted by 116 countries, with at least 25 countries doing so over the last five years. However, implementation remains a challenge.\n\nSince 1998, more than half of countries (116 of 197) have established a national human rights institution that has been peer reviewed for compliance with internationally agreed standards (the Paris Principles). However, only 75 of these countries have institutions that are fully compliant.\n\nSource: Report of the Secretary-General, The Sustainable Development Goals Report 2018\n\nMany regions of the world continue to suffer untold horrors as a result of armed conflict or other forms of violence that occur within societies and at the domestic level.

However, only 75 of these countries have institutions that are fully compliant.\n\nSource: Report of the Secretary-General, The Sustainable Development Goals Report 2018\n\nPeace, justice and effective, accountable and inclusive institutions are at the core of sustainable development. Several regions have enjoyed increased and sustained levels of peace and security in recent decades. But many countries still face protracted armed conflict and violence, and far too many people struggle as a result of weak institutions and the lack of access to justice, information and other fundamental freedoms.\n\nThe number of victims of intentional homicide worldwide remained relatively stable from 2008 to 2014. The worldwide number of victims of intentional homicide was estimated to be between 4.6 and 6.8 per 100,000 people in 2014, a slight decrease with respect to previous years. Yet during that period, the homicide rate in developing countries was twice that in developed countries, and increased in the least developed countries. Moreover, despite the lack of harmonized data, fatalities and injuries related to armed conflict appear to be increasing in some countries, causing unprecedented population displacements and enormous humanitarian needs.\n\nVarious forms of violence against children are pervasive, including discipline that relies on physical punishment and psychological aggression. In all but 7 of 73 countries and areas with available survey data from 2005 to 2015, more than half of children between the ages of 1 and 14 were subjected to some form of psychological aggression and/or physical punishment at home. In Northern Africa, the share was more than 90 per cent.\n\nGlobally, the share of girls and boys among victims of human trafficking (21 per cent and 13 per cent, respectively) peaked in 2011. By 2014, the figures had dropped to 18 per cent and 7 per cent, respectively, but were still almost twice the levels recorded for 2004.\n\nSexual violence is one of the most unsettling of children’s rights violations. Yet underreporting and the lack of comparable data limit understanding of the full extent of the problem. Survey data from 31 low- and middle-income countries suggest that the proportion of women aged between 18 and 29 who experienced sexual violence for the first time before the age of 18 varies widely, ranging from zero to 16 per cent. Comparable data on the experiences of men are only available for five countries, but values are lower than those reported among women in the same countries.\n\nProgress with respect to the rule of law and access to justice is mixed. Globally, the proportion of people held in detention without sentencing decreased slightly, from 32 per cent of total detainees in 2003-2005 to 30 per cent in 2012-2014. However, the percentage for developing regions has consistently been more than two times that of developed regions. In Southern Asia, for instance, more than 2 out of 3 prisoners remained unsentenced in 2012-2014, despite some improvement over the data available for the period 2003 to 2005.\n\nAmong victims of robbery, between one quarter and one half reported the crime to the police, in 27 countries with available data. The data suggest a significant gap in citizens’ access to and trust in authorities. Although official data on the prevalence of bribery are limited, figures from 19 countries indicate that the rate of prevalence of bribery may reach as high as 50 per cent among citizens who had contact with public officials, undermining trust in state institutions.\n\nRegistering children at birth is a first step in securing recognition before the law and safeguarding individual rights and access to justice. Despite recent progress, the births of more than 1 in 4 children under the age of 5 worldwide have not been recorded. In sub-Saharan Africa, over half (54 per cent) of children have not been registered by their fifth birthday. Globally, children living in urban areas are around 1.5 times more likely to be registered than their rural counterparts. In most regions, birth registration rates tend to be highest among the richest 20 per cent of the population.\n\nEfforts are under way to make national and international institutions more effective, inclusive and transparent. Over the past 10 years, nearly two thirds of 144 countries with available data were able to plan their national budgets effectively (where final expenses remained within 10 per cent of original budgets). Voting rights assigned to various groups of countries in international institutions is one indication of inclusivity at the international level. For example, while developing countries account for 63 per cent of voting rights in the African Development Bank, this figure is only 35 per cent in the International Monetary Fund and 38 per cent in the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development of the World Bank Group.\n\nA free press is closely linked to access to information and the protection of human rights, but the trend in this regard is discouraging. The number of journalists killed increased from 65 in 2010 to 114 in 2015, despite the fact that, by 2013, 90 States had adopted laws on freedom of and/or access to information.\n\nThe proportion of countries with national human rights institutions has doubled over the past 15 years, reaching 35.5 per cent by the end of 2015. The share of such institutions that are compliant with the principles relating to the status of national institutions for the promotion and protection of human rights (Paris Principles) (adopted by the General Assembly in its resolution 48/134) was highest in developed regions (46 per cent) and in Latin America and the Caribbean (41 per cent).\n\nSource: Report of the Secretary-General, \"Progress towards the Sustainable Development Goals\", E/2016/75\n\n16\n\n2024 SDG Global Business Forum\n\nTue 16 - Tue 16 Jul 2024\n\n16\n\nRoundtable Dialogue on the Side of 2024 HLPF on “South-South and Triangular Cooperation for Building Regional Capacities for Science, Technology, and Innovation (STI)”, July 16, 12:30 – 2:30 PM\n\nTue 16 - Tue 16 Jul 2024\n\n16\n\nBridging the Ambition Gap for the Future We Want through Climate and SDGs Synergy\n\nTue 16 - Tue 16 Jul 2024\n\n15\n\nKeeping the SDG Promise: Pathways for Acceleration\n\nMon 15 - Mon 15 Jul 2024\n\nSynergy Solutions for Climate and SDG Action: Bridging the Ambition Gap for the Future We Want\n\nRead the document\n\nSynergy Solutions for a World in Crisis: Tackling Climate and SDG Action Together\n\nRead the document\n\nThird Global Conference on Strengthening Synergies Between the Paris Agreement and the 2030 Agenda For Sustainable Development\n\nRead the document\n\nSDG Good Practices-A compilation of success stories and lessons learned in SDG implementation (First Edition)\n\nRead the document\n\nUnited Nations Secretary-General Appoints New Members to the High-level Group to Champion Science, Technology, and Innovation for the Sustainable Development Goals\n\nRelated Goals\n\nGovernments must seek win-win synergies by tackling climate and sustainable development crises together, urges expert group report\n\nExpert Group to Prepare Report Analysing Climate and SDG Synergies, Aiming to Maximize Action Impact"
