        "text": "Today is a great day, We Like Tall Boys fam. You want to know why it’s a great day? Not only did we pick up about 30 new followers in the past week (if you are one of our new friends, hello!), but it’s also starting to get warm in the frozen tundra that is Syracuse, New York.\n\nIf you know anything about Syracuse, you know that it gets the least amount of sunny days per calendar year in the whole U.S. Depressing, right? So when the sun finally starts shining and the snow is all melted off the ground, it’s reason to celebrate. And what better way than to celebrate the Great Thaw than popping open some champagne… of beers? My feet are up, ‘Ready Player One’ is on my television, and I’m ready to bask in the sunlight and pound a tall boy. Let’s go.\n\nBeer name: Miller High Life\n\nBrewery, city, and country of origin: Miller Brewing Company, Milwaukee, Wisconsin\n\nYear created: 1903 (fun fact, High Life was Miller’s flagship beer!)\n\nABV: 4.6%\n\nCost: $5.99 for a 6-pack\n\nTaste: I’m not trying to sound dramatic or anything, but this beer tastes so freaking good, you guys. I love High Life because it’s a hella cheap beer, but it has a really great, full flavor taste to it. The first sip is strong at the front, and mellows out at the end, and is smooth from one sip to the next. While I’m sipping, I appreciate the maltiness and sweetness of this beer. Good vibes all around.\n\nHow Do I Feel? I feel incredibly satisfied. I’ve upped my game since my last review and actually have an adult meal this evening — chicken noodle soup with a side salad. The maltiness of the High Life compliments the savoriness of my soup perfectly.\n\nI do, however, feel a little bit burpy. That being said, High Life isn’t too carbonated which I enjoy because oftentimes I feel like cheaper beer compensates their lack of flavor with carbonation which isn’t great. The burping is probably a side effect of my drinking this beer a bit too fast, which leads into a *new* metric I am introducing into my reviews called:\n\nBeer Poundability — or basically, how easy would it be to pound this beer? On a scale of 1 to 10 (1 being the most thicc porter you could ever think of, and 10 being a Natty Lite), I think High Life has a solid 9/10 on the poundability scale. Not bad!\n\nWhen to drink Miller High Life: This is a beer I tend to drink during sporting events or when I don’t have a lot of cash on hand (‘Cuse men’s and women’s teams lost early on in the tourney, so I refuse to watch any more… #MarchSadness). In my opinion, there truly is not an inappropriate time to crack open a Miller High Life. I mean, how can you not feel fancy when you’re drinking the champagne of beers???\n\nOverall rating: 9/10 Miller High Life, to me, truly embodies both cheap beer and good taste. It’s readily available at most grocery stores and gas stations, tastes great, and feels like a treat when you crack one open. Cheers to you, Miller Brewing Company!\n\nLike I said at the top of this review, thank you to all of our new followers tagging along for our journey!
