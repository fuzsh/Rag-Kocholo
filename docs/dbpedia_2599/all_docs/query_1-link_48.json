It’s a warning for a US equity market that’s still largely priced for perfection and positioned for a soft landing.\n\nThe problem is, this cycle could end in a recession in the next several months. It’s not necessarily the most likely case, but it’s a growing risk and one investors are coming to terms with. And yet, while the air pocket we just experienced in the relentless rise of US equities is behind us, the causes of it — excessive risk-taking because of low volatility — isn’t."
