        "text": "This story is available exclusively to Business Insider subscribers. Become an Insider and start reading now. Have an account? .\n\nTaylor Swift has released more than 40 music videos throughout her career.\n\nMany music videos have featured love interests played by recognizable actors, musicians, and models.\n\nHere's where the leading men are now, from Stephen Colletti to Scott Eastwood.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nClayton Collins played her love interest in the music video for \"Tim McGraw.\"\n\nThe song was part of Swift's self-titled debut studio album, released in 2006.\n\nCollins has been difficult to track down online since starring in Swift's first-ever music video.\n\nCollins was cast in the video for \"Tim McGraw\" because he looked similar to the guy who inspired the song.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMusician and \"One Tree Hill\" actor Tyler Hilton played Drew in Swift's music video for \"Teardrops on My Guitar.\"\n\nPrior to starring in Swift's music video, Hilton portrayed Elvis Presley in the 2005 movie \"Walk the Line.\"\n\nBy the time of \"Teardrops on My Guitar,\" Hilton was known for playing Chris Keller on the drama series \"One Tree Hill.\"\n\nHe became so close to Swift and her family that they offered for him to temporarily live in their houseboat after he moved to Nashville, Tennessee.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHilton reunited with \"OTH\" costar Hilarie Burton for the 2019 holiday movie \"A Christmas Wish.\"\n\nAfter finishing his run on \"OTH\" in 2012, Hilton released multiple albums and starred on the show \"Extant.\" He also appeared in holiday movies like \"Christmas on the Bayou,\" \"The Christmas Contract,\" and \"When Christmas Was Young.\"\n\nHilton met Swift when she was 15 and they've remained friends since, with the pair reuniting at a concert in Texas as part of her Reputation Tour in 2018.\n\n\"I remember thinking, 'This girl is so talented. I don't care if she's 15 or 40, I'm just a fan,'\" Hilton told Entertainment Tonight. \"She's really authentic and that whole thing you see with her is what you get.\"\n\nHe continued: \"I remember her playing me songs in her bedroom that ended up on her 'Fearless' record and she really was just a little girl in her bedroom with all these fantasies and a journal full of songs. It was so endearing.\"\n\nHilton has been married to actor Megan Park since 2015.
