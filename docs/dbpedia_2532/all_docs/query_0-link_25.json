        "text": "When my second son was born in the early ’90s, I decided to make boys and their families my life’s work. Between my role as the consulting psychologist at a school for boys outside Philadelphia; running a research center that conducts global studies focused on improving boys’ education; maintaining a clinical practice specializing in helping boys and men; and raising my own sons, I have spent a great deal of time in the years since thinking about boys and the people who care for them. Whenever I speak to parents of boys, I begin with this assertion:\n\nThere’s never been a better time to raise a son.\n\nThere is much evidence to support my optimism, but I’ll mention just a couple of examples. Many younger men now tell researchers they care more about their mental health than their physical health. At the boys’ school, one sign of this trend is how the emotional literacy program I lead for juniors and seniors now bursts at the seams, with all types of boys—Division 1 football recruits, drama stars, academic nerds—piling into the room, occupying each chair and every inch of floor space. Compared to the stoic and self-sacrificing generations before them, today’s young men seek healthier, more flexible, and more meaningful lives. Even working-class men balk at mechanical jobs, holding out for more autonomous, nurturing roles. According to a 2021 Pew Research survey, millennial fathers see the value in caring for others and try harder to spend time with their children (even though women still shoulder the bulk of the load).\n\nThese men realize that happiness requires more, and are, in many ways, redefining masculinity. They are taking advantage of new possibilities in a reconfigured gender landscape and claiming the right to live an authentic life. Following their lead, the institutions that comprise boyhood—families, schools, sports programs, among others—are responding positively. In education, the example I’ve studied most, there’s growing recognition that boys need a personal connection to help them feel supported and invested in their efforts to achieve. Teachers are beginning to recognize they must reach boys before they can expect to teach them.\n\nThere is a great deal of upheaval about all of this, of course. An industry of pundits and politicians have claimed to see “softness” in the courage it takes for a boy to be honest about his dreams, his struggles. But from my decades-long experience, I have watched as our conception of boyhood has expanded—from requiring more equity in romantic partnerships, to greater concern about the physical dangers of contact sports, to growing acceptance that boys, too, have emotional lives—and I believe these changes signify the triumph of human nature over pretense and posturing. Today, there’s less emphasis on “performative” masculinity, leaving more room for boys and men to be themselves and to care about their own well-being.\n\nPressed to play the part\n\nThe idea of boyhood that was first established in Renaissance Europe—when ubiquitous violence, emotional suppression, and what we’d now call bullying shaped society—has never worked particularly well for boys. This approach wasn’t really about supporting them as children, but what adults believed to be needed from them as men: strength, in the most primitive sense, and a willingness to endure at whatever personal cost. Throughout the centuries since, many boys have been overwhelmed by the lack of care at the heart of boyhood. From giving up in school to self-destructive behaviors like nonstop gaming, excessive porn, and substance use, there are many, often-overlooked signs that we’ve failed, as a society, to set boys up for success, in all aspects of their lives. Casualties and losses have always been an inconvenient truth about traditional boyhood.\n\nThese losses begin very early on. As documented in her 2014 book, When Boys Become Boys, Stanford psychology professor Judy Y. Chu embedded with a small group of boys, from their years in pre-kindergarten to first grade. She regularly observed and interviewed them, their teachers, and their parents. Over two years, she reported that the boys became less present and more somber as they picked up cultural scripts tied to masculine stereotypes and learned to play the part of “real” boys. She watched as they changed everything—how they dressed, played, behaved—and traded their natural exuberance for a studied pose rooted in conformity.\n\nBoth mothers and fathers have believed that teaching their sons to be “real” men is at the heart of their job descriptions. As recently as 2020, research I helped conduct for the Global Boyhood Initiative of the DC-based NGO Equimundo found that parents of boys press them to comply with cultural standards, even at the expense of their personal authenticity. When asked what was most important for their sons, parents told us that they should be emotionally strong (94%) and physically strong (61%), play sports (48%), have a girlfriend (46%), and, overall, fit in (59%).\n\nAs they try to meet these expectations, many boys lose all sense of being accepted for who they truly are. As Canadian scholar Michael Kaufman argues, there has long been a “strange combination of power and powerlessness, privilege, and pain” in masculinity. By their later teen years, many boys are stranded in a desolate state of emotional constriction, social isolation, and personal imposture. Not surprisingly, in a recent State of American Men survey we conducted at Equimundo, two-thirds of Gen Z men (between ages 18 to 23) agreed with the statement, “No one really knows me well.”\n\n“Every boy, known and loved.”\n\nWhen I first heard those words—a school motto coined by the late Tony Jarvis, legendary headmaster of Roxbury Latin School outside Boston—I was moved by their clarity and power.\n\nI continue to believe they capture exactly the right spirit and direction for our times.\n\nWe know what a child needs to flourish. We’ve just been slow to apply it to our sons. A few years ago, my research team surveyed nearly 1,500 boys between the ages of 12 and 18 in six countries, as well as 1,200 of their teachers, and asked what was working in their education. In their responses, the teachers focused on the details of their lessons, but the boys wrote, often with deeply moving expressions of gratitude, about the personalities, quirks, and gifts of their teachers and coaches. They told us clearly that they need connection to do their best, whether in the classroom or on the field.\n\nYet, even in their families, too, many boys feel alone. In the same State of American Men survey, a large percentage of younger men reported feeling like they don’t have anyone they can talk to when they are stressed or troubled. And without supportive relationships, psychologists tell us, people become more vulnerable and their lives more precarious. In school, for example, disconnected boys are at higher risk of tuning out, giving up, or becoming “problems” in the classroom. When they do not feel “well held” and accountable to someone who cares for them, boys come adrift and look to their peers for their sense of belonging and purpose. Once they become disconnected, it is a great deal harder for young men to aspire or strive to be their best selves.\n\nWhat can parents do to support their sons?\n\nMuch of the work of parenting a boy, especially as he gets older, is to build and maintain a strong enough relationship with him, so he knows he has an affirming place to turn when he feels tense, angry, fearful, or otherwise upset. A place where he is known and loved. These relationships are the foundation of a boy’s ability to resist all of the potentially harmful temptations and pressures of our modern culture.\n\nIt starts with listening. Really, truly listening to a boy means setting aside all of the worries, irritations, and urgencies we might feel in response to what he is doing or saying, and instead offering the gift of our full attention. Beyond that, we can validate our sons by accompanying them during the activities they genuinely enjoy, even if it means stretching outside of our own comfort zones. For example, both of my sons often chose to get quality time with me by doing activities that I am not so fond of—like playing video games, wrestling and roughhousing, or throwing around a lacrosse ball. But what mattered was my willingness to try, and simply to be there, just because I cared. And when my sons behaved badly, rather than threatening, scolding, or shaming them, I instead stepped in closer, sometimes firmly, to insist they tell me about whatever underlying tension was driving them off course. Even when they were being willfully uncooperative, I determined what they needed was more connection, not distance.\n\nHelping boys retain their humanity by offering a confident, steadfast relationship is not easy, particularly because so many of them, especially ones who have been let down, can seem unapproachable and rejecting. But from years of listening to even the most hardened young men, I can vouch for the durability of their bedrock humanity, even when it is less apparent. When someone can reach for them through their bravado, a human heart, open to the transformative power of connection, awaits. In the careers of every teacher or coach, for example, there are stories of a turn-around, a young man heading down the wrong road who was brought back by skill, patience, and care.\n\nWe all know a man who was rescued by love.\n\nRelated:\n\n3 Things to Do If You’re a Guy Who Has No Idea How to Start Therapy\n\n12 Dads Share Their Biggest Pandemic Parenting Lessons\n\n‘The New Masculinity’ Is Our May SELF Well-Read Book Club Pick"
