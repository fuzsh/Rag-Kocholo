        "text": "This is the final article in a three-part series about why and how Next Gen Men’s youth programs and resources engage boys-only groups in schools.\n\nStart by exploring why schools need to commit to combatting ‘toxic’ masculinity in Why Schools Should Commit to Combating Toxic Masculinity. Then read A Gender-Neutral Approach to Toxic Masculinity Won’t Work to round out your understanding of why working speciically with boys and young men matters.\n\nI recently engaged two preteen boys in a counselling session about why they were in conflict with each other. One of the boys, Jordan, began the conversation with a joking attitude, and I shut him down. Several times. “I’m asking you both to be vulnerable,” I eventually told him, “and if you target Madden while his guard is down, that’s going to make me snap.”\n\nJordan looked at me. “Can I say something?” he asked.\n\nI said sure.\n\n“You think I’m someone I’m not,” he fired. “You judge me as soon as I start talking and I hate it. You warned me so many times, like you already have it in your head that I’m a fuck-up. Because I’m Black? I don’t know.”\n\n“Or the past,” he added. “The past is not the future.”\n\nThis gets at one of the hardest things to balance when working with boys—how to challenge problematic and harmful behaviours or beliefs without making them feel like they’re being targeted themselves. Many boys’ identities are closely intertwined with masculinity, which means that when we talk about their actions it can feel like we’re talking about them. No one wants to feel like that.\n\nSo how do we address toxic masculinity without vilifying boys?\n\nThe point of saying this is that our baseline expectations for boys’ behaviour come from a long history. The ‘boys will be boys’ narrative is sometimes as blatant as the defending a Supreme Court nominee accused of committing sexual assault, but often it is more subtle than that.\n\nYou can hear it as an undercurrent in the way we talk with or about teenage boys in particular—boys like Jordan. We see them as inaccessible. Unapproachable. Impenetrable. “How many of us parents have watched our sweet toddler boys slowly hide their tenderness,” asked John Bell in a #MeToo op-ed, “in order to fit into the harsh teenage boy culture?”\n\nIt’s the same ‘boys will be boys’ rhetoric, only no one is saying it out loud.\n\nYet boys know it. They feel it, just like Jordan did. Because what we don’t say with our voices we demonstrate with our actions—and working with pro-feminist ‘sweet’ boys while writing off the tough ones as yet another bitter end to the status quo says it all.\n\nThat’s like teaching kids the dangers of smoking. It’s preventative. It’s worthwhile. But it’s clearly inadequate. What about the kids already smoking to fit in or to cope with anxiety? What about the kids who picked it up from their parents? And what about the kids who don’t smoke but still think it looks cool?\n\nEvery one of them deserves to breathe. To be heard. To be held accountable when they screw up, and to be given opportunities to grow beyond the limited stereotypes they are so often given.\n\nIn Vincent Grashaw’s 2017 film And Then I Go, 15-year-old Arman Darbo plays Edwin, a high school freshman who is bullied constantly and desperate for something to change. In one poignant scene, he breaks into tears after another day of unrelenting violence at school.\n\n“Oh honey, it’s okay,” his mother tries to tell him.\n\n“What is?” he says.\n\n“Whatever it is,” she hesitates, “I know that sometimes you just can’t handle stuff. It’s too hard.”\n\nAbruptly, he pushes her away. “I can handle it,” he snaps.\n\nTrauma-sensitive care calls on parents and educators to recognize the impact of traumatic experiences and actively resist re-traumatization. Edwin’s victimization within his peer hierarchy at school caused him to feel utterly powerless. Because his mother didn’t use a trauma-informed approach, she inadvertently made that feeling worse.\n\nWhen I first watched this scene, I was moved by how clearly and powerfully Arman Darbo demonstrates the mask of boyhood.\n\nReally, though, most boys could probably do the same. They’ve experienced it firsthand.\n\nEven teenagers—even the ones trying desperately and sometimes convincingly to appear invulnerable. They’re not. If you think a boy who was in a fist fight isn’t hurting, try punching something with an unprotected fist. If you think a boy who is using drugs isn’t struggling, ask yourself what kind of feelings outweigh getting arrested.\n\nAs Dan Kindlon and Michael Thompson put it in their landmark book about boys’ emotional lives, Raising Cain, it’s vital that we not take boys at face value, even though they sometimes insist—furiously—that we do so.\n\nThat means being attentive to the fact that boys are each carrying past hurt or ongoing struggles on their shoulders, and knowing that those experiences influence their current mindset in different ways.\n\nWe don’t judge boys. We meet them where they’re at, and we help them lift that weight.\n\nShame and judgment have a powerful regulatory presence in the lives of boys and young men. Boys who don’t fit the ‘tough guy’ stereotype are often mocked or excluded by their peers; boys who do usually get shut down or punished by their teachers.\n\nAs a result, boys become highly attuned to shame. They can sense a deficit mindset a mile away.\n\nThat’s one of the reasons Next Gen Men’s youth team avoids the phrase ‘toxic masculinity’ altogether. Instead, we build on a body of research about how to strengthen boys’ best qualities and engage them as allies.\n\nPsychologists Mark Kiselica and Matt Englar-Carlson, for example, propose a framework called positive psychology/positive masculinity, which empowers boys and men to embrace healthy forms of masculinity by accentuating positive traditional qualities like courage, heroism and boys’ relational styles.\n\nWhat really matters is the mindset.\n\nA strengths-based mindset matters because when the threat of shaming or judgment is removed, boys don’t hold back: they long to tell their stories. We’ve seen this again and again in our work at Next Gen Men. When given the chance, boys’ groups become incredibly open to sharing about their experiences with masculinity.\n\nWhat this has taught us is that boys already have what they need to make positive change. They have the experience, the self-awareness, and the capacity to see the consequences and inherent limitations of harmful versions of masculinity.\n\nYes, boys who are stuck may need help unpacking their baggage or overcoming significant barriers, but our job, then, is to provide them with opportunities for meaningful reflection—not to fix them altogether.\n\nIn the first blog post in this series, Why Schools Should Commit to Combating Toxic Masculinity, I talk about Louis, an 11-year-old who first connected with Next Gen Men while he was in trouble with the law. Through a lot of hard work, self-reflection and a mentoring relationship with me, he slowly came to terms with what he’d done and committed to a new vision for his future.\n\nOne of the most impactful things I learned through speaking with him on the Breaking the Boy Code podcast was the impact of an adult mentor’s belief: he didn’t believe he could change until I did.\n\nIn the end, he started propelling his own transformation, but to do that he constantly drew on my steadfast belief in not just who he could be but in who he already was.\n\nIt isn’t always easy to find the balance between affirming boys and pushing them to do better, but that middle ground is a landscape of immense possibility. That’s where boys want to be found."
