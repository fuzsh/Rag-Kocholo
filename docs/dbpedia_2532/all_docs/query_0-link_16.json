        "text": "Where are the BEST Massachusetts Farm Stands Near Me?\n\nYes, that picture of the cute kid it is US, every single summer since we were her age. There is NOTHING better than that first bite of sweet, delicious locally grown corn on the cob! THIS is the time where the best freshest, tastiest corn can be found. It almost softens the blow that end of summer is near, when we know we can hit are favorite local farm stand for the golden kernel gifts from nature!\n\nThis begs the question, how to you cook your corn: grilled or boiled?\n\nCorn: Grilled or Boiled?\n\nI’m not going to lie. My experience with grilling corn, is zero. Therefore, I had to go to the airwaves for help. I’ll share that recipe in a moment. I had grilled corn awhile back at a party. We found it took too long, and ended up not being cooked enough. Now, these days, my brother Paul, is a grilled corn expert, so he says. He refuses to eat corn on the cob that is boiled, claiming “you lose all the sweetness!” Why is he such a corn fanatic? It’s this discovery.\n\nCould THIS Be The Sweetest Corn Ever?\n\nHere in Western Massachusetts is God’s gift to corn. One of my favorite famous local farm stands near me is called Breezy Gardens.\n\nBreezy Gardens is known for their special blend of corn that is the SWEETEST that I have ever enjoyed. It’s called MIRAI pronounced me-rye. It was a blend developed by accident in Ohio. Here’s the story from ParkSeed.com:\n\nEvery once in a while a true plant phenomenon comes along, and Corn Mirai™ is just such a miracle. This amazing Corn is so sweet and tender that it has captured the Japanese market.\n\nSo our pals at Breezy Gardens discovered this Mirai seed, plant and hand pick it here! It really is the sweetest corn I had ever had. The color of the corn is almost orange.\n\nOn The Grill?\n\nUntil now, cooking corn on the grill posed a problem for me. I did not want to buy an extra grill. So, I did what I always do: ask you, our brilliant listeners for help. Almost immediately I received this step by step tutorial from listener Jim:\n\nDear JayBeau:\n\nI was listening to this afternoon’s show when you mentioned your friend who suggested that you grill sweet corn in the husks. This is the only way I ever prepare sweet corn. There is no substitute. It’s easy, and actually doesn’t get in the way of grilling other items for your meal.\n\nHere’s how to do it. Grab a cooler. Any standard type of cooler will do. Place the corn in the cooler and fill it with water, or until the corn is thoroughly submerged. A half hour in water is more than sufficient but longer doesn’t hurt. Once soaked, throw the corn on the hot grill and turn it every 5-10 minutes until the shucks are golden brown. This usually takes 20-30 minutes. Once you’ve removed the corn from the cooler, pour out the water. When the corn is completely cooked, place the ears back in the cooler (it now become the warmer). Any good cooler will keep the corn hot in their shucks for several hours. This allows you to cook your normal grill items without worrying about the corn. It’ll be ready when you are.\n\nAww…..Shucks\n\nNow comes one of the best parts of cooking corn in its shucks. The shucks peel back easily as compared to the typical approach to shucking corn. Plus, the shucks provide a handle for eating the corn without other utensils. In my opinion, the flavor of corn steamed in its own shucks on the grill is incomparable to any other approach for preparing sweet corn. It’s just that easy and tastes great!\n\nGood luck. Hope you like it. Best, Jim.\n\nThanks Jim! I now have my answer on the question: corn: grilled or boiled?\n\nNow that I’m starved, let’s go find BEST Massachusetts Farm Stands Near Me, and you! We did our best to pull from the best, north south, east and west. Thanks Yelp!"
