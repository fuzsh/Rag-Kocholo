        "text": "Following on from the release of global hit streaming singles ‘I Let The Devil In, and ‘Why Don’t We’, fast-rising country music performer Olivia Lane returns today (Friday, March 26th) with the third official single to be lifted off her forthcoming album ‘Heart Change’.\n\n‘Boy’s Still Got It’ gives fans yet another delightful taste of what they can expect from the upcoming collection which is slated to drop later in the year with the project expected to be one of the most impressive bodies of work from a country talent this musical calendar year.\n\nAnd along with sharing the official audio for download across all worldwide streaming, and digital platforms Olivia Lane has also shared the music video for the track with the standout cinematic clip elevating the expertly crafted lyrical story to incredible new heights.\n\nThere’s a raw vulnerability to the lyrics that showcase the standout songwriting talent Lane seemingly effortlessly possesses as she creates a dynamic tale that takes us from start to finish throughout the stellar story-arc of loving someone wholeheartedly and all the little things that make them, them.\n\nSpeaking about the single, Olivia Lane says: “This song is about acknowledging all the small things we love about our person. It takes extreme vulnerability to share all the parts of ourselves with our loved ones, always risking that that relationship may go away one day. Even in the most difficult aftermath of my heartbreaks, I’ve always been proud of myself for putting my heart out there and taking a chance on the greatest gift we have on earth, love.”\n\nAre you a fan of ‘Boy’s Still Got It’?
