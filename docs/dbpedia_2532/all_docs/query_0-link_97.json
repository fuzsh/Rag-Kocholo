        "text": "Top Boy, the UK-based crime drama, has returned to Netflix for its third and final season.\n\nSet in and around Summerhouse, a fictional estate in Hackney, London, where drug dealers, gang lords and wannabe thugs reside, street talk is prevalent among many who live there.\n\nAs such, it can be difficult to decipher exactly what the characters of Netflix's Top Boy are saying when they use colloquialisms.\n\nNewsweek has created a handy guide to help audiences understand some popular UK slang words and phrases.\n\nKeep this guide handy as you watch the final season of Top Boy, starring Ashley Walters and British rapper Kane \"Kano\" Robinson, as there are bound to be times you are left wondering what the meaning behind an unfamiliar word or phrase is.\n\nTop Boy Slang Guide\n\nBelow is a list of recurring idioms used in Netflix's Top Boy, along with a definition and example of how the word or phrase is used in a sentence.\n\nYou get me\n\nMeaning: A regular phrase used throughout the series, \"you get me\" is akin to the question, \"do you understand me?\" or the phrase \"you know what I mean.\" It is used in conversation to establish whether someone has acknowledged a statement you have made\n\nSentence use: \"I'm only at this party because the birthday girl is my cousin, you get me.\"\n\nBruv\n\nMeaning: Probably one of the simpler words to identify, \"bruv\" is like saying \"brother.\" However, it is not exclusive to blood relatives. The word can be used to refer to a friend or extended family member, as well as a biological brother. This is also the definition for \"bredren,\" slang for brethren.\n\nSentence use: \"Bruv, what are you doing tonight? I'll come meet you later.\"\n\nCuz\n\nMeaning: It is a simplified way of saying cousin. \"Cuz\" is often used in reference to a person belonging to the same extended family as you. But \"cuz\" is also commonly used to address one's friends too.\n\nSentence use: \"What's up, cuz? How's everything with you?\"\n\nFam\n\nMeaning: \"Fam\" is short for \"family\" but like \"bruv\" and \"cuz\" it can be used as a reference for friends too.\n\nSentence use: \"Fam, I've been waiting ages for this bus. I'm going to be late.\"\n\nWasteman\n\nMeaning: It is a derogatory term used to describe a worthless person, who has nothing positive going on in their lives.\n\nSentence use: \"Alex has no job, he's living rent free with his girlfriend and owes me money. He's a wasteman.\"\n\nWhat you sayin'?\n\nMeaning: It is a greeting that can be likened to \"how are you?\" or \"what's up.\" Similarly, it is a way of asking your counterpart to fill you in on any details, a bit like saying, \"what are you telling me?\"\n\nSentence use: \"What you sayin', Alex. I ain't seen you in a while.\"\n\nYard\n\nMeaning: In Jamaican Patois \"yard\" means home. In the U.K., the word is also used to refer to one's residence.\n\nSentence use: \"The walk from my yard to the corner shop is long!\"\n\nD**khead\n\nMeaning: An explicit term used to describe an idiot person, who generally acts foolish and does countless stupid things.\n\nSentence use: \"You're such a d**khead! Why did you throw my phone out of the window?!\"\n\nP***yhole\n\nMeaning: A derogatory term generally used to describe a man, who does not exhibit manly qualities and is weaker in nature. Someone who is a wimp or timid.\n\nSentence use: \"I can't stand Mark, he's such a p***yhole. All he had to do was this one job for me.\"\n\nP's/Pees\n\nMeaning: Quite simply \"p's\" or \"pees\" is another word for money or cash.\n\nSentence use: \"We're going to make a lot of P's when we sell this.\"\n\nZoot\n\nMeaning: It is a rolled-up marijuana cigarette, which can also be referred to as a \"spliff\" or \"joint.\"\n\nSentence use: \"Do you want to smoke a zoot with me?\"\n\nLikkle\n\nMeaning: Used to describe anything small in stature. It is another word for \"little.\"\n\nSentence use: \"Wow, I remember Mia when she was just a likkle girl.\"\n\nSwear down\n\nMeaning: A phrase commonly used in and around London to signify that what you are saying is 100 percent true and no lies were told. It is a bit like saying \"the whole truth and nothing but the truth.\" It is said to affirm something really happened how you said it did.\n\nSentence use: \"I promise you I saw Tiffany kissing Trevor. Saw it with my own eyes. Swear down!\"\n\nPatterned\n\nMeaning: The word grew in popularity among youths in 2020 and means to organize, sort out something.\n\nSentence use: That situation with Hakeem is over. I patterned him.\n\nBless up\n\nMeaning: The phrase is used to leave the end of a conversation on a positive note and is a way of wishing someone well, a good day/time. It can also mean \"blessing(s) from the most high (a God-like figure).\"\n\nSentence use: \"It was good seeing you, Brenda. Bless Up!\"\n\nIn a bit\n\nMeaning: \"In a bit\" is comparable to \"see you later\" or \"goodbye.\" It is said when bidding someone farewell. The phrase is derived from the saying \"I'll see you in a bit.\"\n\nSentence use: \"Good catching up with you, Trish. In a bit!\"\n\nWagwan\n\nMeaning: Believed to have first been used in the Caribbean, \"wagwan\" is the direct translation for \"what's going on?\" It is used as a greeting like \"how are you?\"\n\nSentence use: \"Wagwan, Terrell.

Don't even worry about it.\"\n\nShook\n\nMeaning: The definition of \"shook\" is \"to be scared.\" In other words, it is used to describe a person afraid or frightened of something or someone.\n\nSentence use: \"You should have seen Marcus' face when he saw Shaun. He was shook, man!\"\n\nMandem\n\nMeaning: \"Mandem\" loosely translates to a \"group of male friends.\" However, it can also be used to refer to a set of female friends too.\n\nSentence use: \"When all the mandem come we'll head to the club.\"\n\nFood\n\nMeaning: Urban slang for illegal narcotics like weed.\n\nSentence use: \"Have you got any food, man?\"\n\nInnit\n\nMeaning: Shortened version of \"isn't it,\" can be added to the end of any sentence for emphasis or if seeking agreement.\n\nSentence use: \"Top Boy is the best show in the world, innit?\"\n\nMotive\n\nMeaning: \"Motive\" has grown in prominence recently. It loosely means \"a reason to go out\" and have a good time.\n\nSentence use: \"Hey Daniel, have you got a motive for Saturday night yet?\"\n\nDark\n\nMeaning: Slang for heroin, also known as smack, skag, brown, horse, or gear.\n\nSentence use: \"Taking dark will mess you up, fam.\"\n\nPeak\n\nMeaning: In certain parts of the UK, \"peak\" can mean a positive situation, but in other areas, like Top Boy's London, it's used as a negative — generally meaning things are particularly bad or difficult.\n\nSentence use: \"It's getting peak in here, bruv.\"\n\nShotting\n\nMeaning: Drug dealing.\n\nSentence use: \"He's out shotting food.\"\n\nThere's been some debate about whether Top Boy's final season should be classed as Season 3 or Season 5. The series was originally produced by the UK's Channel 4 network, with the first two seasons—each comprised of four episodes—airing in 2011 and 2013.\n\nThe series was canceled by Channel 4 after Season 2 aired, but Netflix resurrected Top Boy for a third installment in 2017 with the original cast, after Canadian rapper Drake approached the streamer about reviving the series and coming on board as an executive producer.\n\nNetflix chose to promote its revival as a new Netflix original series, debuting Top Boy Season 1 in 2019, while the two original Channel 4 seasons were packaged under the name Top Boy: Summerhouse to differentiate them from episodes produced by the streaming service. Netflix's Top Boy Season 2 debuted in March 2022, while Season 3 followed in September 2023.\n\nThe final season of Top Boy is now streaming on Netflix.\n\nUpdate, 9/13/23: This article was originally published to coincide with the release of Top Boy Season 2 in 2022, and has been updated to reflect the release of Season 3 with additional definitions in 2023."
