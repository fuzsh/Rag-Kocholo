        "text": "How many do you recognise?\n\nWe absolutely LOVE the throwbacks here, at your favourite radio station Hits Radio, but sometimes a modern reworking just gives them that extra edge, to make them into a massive success in the charts and on the dancefloor.\n\nIn the last few years, we've had David Guetta giving Haddaway's 90s banger a revamp with Anne-Marie and Coi Leray, Switch Disco and Ella Henderson's 'React', sampling the 90s classic 'Children' by Robert Miles and another banger from David Guetta and Kim Petras in the shape of 'When We Were Young (The Logical Song)'.\n\nWe've also had Paul Russell's TikTok hit 'Lil Boo Thang' taking the world by storm, which samples The Emotion's 1977 hit 'Best of My Love', and Ella Henderson released 'Alibi' this year, which samples Coolio's 'Gangsta's Paradise', which in turn interpolates a Stevie Wonder song from 1976.\n\nBecause of all these amazing hits, we thought we'd we take a look at some of the 90s classics and other older songs that you'll know and love, that have been remixed, sampled, covered or interpolated, and also had huge success a second time (or even third time) round.\n\nTake a look at these throwbacks which have been sampled or remixed into huge hits:\n\nYou can hear many of these songs on Hits Radio.\n\nNow read:\n\nGoing to university in the 90s v now\n\nClassic video games we'd LOVE to play again ðŸ‘¾ðŸŽ®\n\nFood and drink we wish would make a comeback\n\nHow to listen to Hits Radio:\n\nTurn it up with Hits Radio! Home of Fleur East, Sam Thompson and Gemma Atkinson playing the biggest hits and the biggest throwbacks, alongside the biggest laughs and life-changing competitions. Tune in on FM, DAB, online or ask your Smart Speaker to 'Play Hits Radio'."
