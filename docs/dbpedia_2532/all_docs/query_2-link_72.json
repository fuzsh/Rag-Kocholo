        "text": "Ocean Beach is a 5-piece band based in Tāmaki Makaurau Auckland whose music ranges from crunchy pop-punk folk to shoegaze-inflected cinematic cruisers.\n\nImagine a world where Bryan Ferry and Steve Malkmus’ Tongan love child became a cheese monger who learned to play the guitar. A world where DD Smash takes more acid, and Ram Dass is in a pub rock band. A world where sonic instrumentals merge with pop in the middle of spaghetti junction.\n\nGary Dalhousie is that love child. Ocean Beach is the vehicle. The forthcoming album, The Long Road Home, is the tale of one man’s journey from anxious Southland kid to conscious father, partner and mentor.\n\nFrom Invercargill in the 70’s to modern day Grey Lynn, our protagonist is spat out from a neurotic state highway of self-medication. Drugs, booze and anxious delinquency fueled this unwarrantable heap from one of the southernmost cities in the world, up through State Highway1 and onto the North-Western motorway, to be ejected at the St Lukes off-ramp.\n\nFive new Ocean Beach singles will be shared at the beginning of each month, charting the story of our cheese mongers’ journey. It will unfold in its entirety when The Long Road Home is released at the end of this year.\n\nOut today is the first single in the series, ‘Boy’s Club’, recorded and produced by Dale Cotton (The Bats, HDU, The Subliminals, Bachelorette and many more).\n\nGary Dalhousie says, “Raised in Invercargill in the 70s & 80’s in one of the city’s few Pasifika families, I developed a healthy respect for the role of women in our household. Mum emigrated from Tonga in 1962, which helped foster a sensitivity to injustices inflicted on anyone – but especially people of colour, indigenous peoples and women.\n\nThis song is dedicated to the many privileged lads that party their way through life as part of the patriarchy, and who seek to protect their position at the head of the (private school boy) class by keeping that glass ceiling nice and low.”"
