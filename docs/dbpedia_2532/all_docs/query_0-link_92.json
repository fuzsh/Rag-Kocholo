        "text": "\"Momma's boy\" is a term sometimes used to describe a man who lacks self-reliance and is overly dependent on his mother. While it has traditionally been used as an insult, shifting attitudes have led to changes in how the term is used today. For younger generations, the term is often used to describe men with a healthy respect and appreciation for their moms.\n\nBeing married to a momma's boy isn't always a bad thing. A man who is close to his mother is not a momma's boy in a negative way.\n\nResearch has shown that boys and men with strong relationships with their mothers are mentally healthier, more empathetic, and have better relationships with women. However, a man who seems unhealthily attached to his mother might be more of a problem. This is particularly true if he can't seem to function without her.\n\nWhat Is a Momma's Boy?\n\nThe term \"momma's boy\" (sometimes written as \"mama's boy\") is often used as slang to describe a man who has an unhealthy dependence on his mother well into adulthood when he is expected to be independent and self-reliant.\n\nThe term was first used in the early 1900s, and its popular use is rooted in the work of theorists and child development researchers such as Sigmund Freud and Benjamin Spock.\n\nIn the past, psychologists and child experts often believed that maternal warmth and coldness were connected to psychological issues in children, particularly in boys. Today, experts recognize that healthy attachment is essential for the mental well-being of boys and men.\n\nMany men, from professional athletes to entrepreneurs, proudly claim to be momma's boys. The term has been reclaimed in recent years to indicate a boy or man who appreciates, respects, admires, and/or is close with his mother.\n\nSigns Someone Might Be a Momma's Boy\n\nIn order to recognize the signs that someone might be a momma's boy, it's important first to be able to recognize some of the signs of unhealthy boundaries.\n\nSuch behaviors are often a sign of enmeshment. When enmeshment persists into adulthood, men may continue to rely on their mother to meet their practical, financial, emotional, and social needs. Examples might include having his mom balance his checkbook, clean his house, and provide money.\n\nResearchers suggest that these interparental boundaries are important not only for the relationships between kids and their parents, they also establish the tone that helps determine the quality of other family relationships as well.\n\nEffects of Being a Momma's Boy\n\nBeing a momma's boy may have some potentially negative psychological effects. For example, research has found that boys who fail to form secure, nurturing relationships with their mothers are more likely to be aggressive as children and emotionally distant as adults.\n\nHealthy relationships between mothers and sons are important. Boys with good relationships with their moms are more likely to feel secure, confident, and emotionally strong. Research has also shown that boys who have difficult relationships with their moms are at a greater risk of delinquency during adolescence.\n\nSome of these negative effects can include him being overly dependent on his mom and ignoring your needs and wishes. This can ultimately lead to feelings of resentment and difficulties with communication.\n\nHow to Handle Boundary Issues\n\nIf you are having relationship problems caused by your partner's unhealthy boundaries, there are some things that you can do to improve the situation. Some things you should try include:\n\nEstablish Clear Boundaries\n\nYour man might be used to his mother catering to his every need and want, but that does not mean that you need to as well. It is important that you set boundaries and let him know that you will not behave like his mother.\n\nHe can act like a boy with his mother all he wants, but when he is with you, he should act like an independent adult who can take care of himself.\n\nHe may use manipulation to get his way, so you need to be strong when he accuses you of not loving him and wanting what is best for him. Studies have shown that managing boundaries in marriage is important for a successful relationship, especially in couples where both partners are wage-earners.\n\nMaintain Independent Space\n\nMoving into her house is not a good idea if he's a momma's boy. Chances are, their relationship as mother and son will come before your relationship with him. He will most likely side with his mother on every subject to avoid upsetting her. He may even go to his mother when the two of you disagree.\n\nWhile he can do these things even if you live outside her home, the distance will help some. You do not want to feel like the third wheel when living with your spouse.\n\nIf you are in financial straits and his parents have offered to help you by letting you move in, make sure there is an end date in mind. If you are doing it to save for your own home, realize that you risk damaging your marriage.\n\nHowever, keep in mind that living apart from your in-laws does not guarantee a stress-free relationship with them. Many couples still report feeling pressure.\n\nAvoid Confrontation\n\nIt's not your place to go to your mother-in-law and ask her to back off. If you want to talk to anyone about the situation, it's your husband you need to talk to. Do not come from a place of anger, though.\n\nRemind him that you like his mother and don't mind going to her house for dinner once a month, but she should not be coming on all of your activities and dates just because she is lonely or has poor boundaries.\n\nExplain that you do not want her out of your lives, but you both need time to connect and grow as a couple.\n\nMake Your Own Choices\n\nIt's one thing for your mother-in-law to make his choices if that's what he is comfortable with. She might pick out his clothes, his food, and even his career. If he is incapable of making these decisions without her input, however, that might be something to consider trying to iron out.\n\nYou don't want his mother to become a decision-maker about choices you make as an individual or as a couple. Do not include your mother-in-law in your marital disagreements.\n\nTakeaways\n\nIf your spouse is too attached to his mother, it’s important to look at how this damages your marriage. You probably ignored red flags about this when dating, so if you now see it in your marriage, you need to address it sooner rather than later. If trying to communicate and resolve problems around this does not move things in the right direction, professional help is probably in order."
