        "text": "Kieran Brunt of Strange Boy: “November Skies is a song I wrote several years ago and have held close until the time was right to release it. It's a song about my friend Maya, who very suddenly had to leave to go back to India when we were studying together. The lyrics are a sort of patchwork of our favourite songs that we'd listen to together. This live video was filmed in the church where I recorded the song and our album, Love Remains. We're very grateful to our friend Kate Huggett for stepping in and singing the end vocal so beautifully, which was performed on the record by Anna B Savage.”\n\nIn a harmonious blend of the sacred and the profane, electronic pop duo Strange Boy unveils their new single ‘November Skies’ taken from their long-awaited debut album, Love Remains which is out now via Groenland Records. Delving deep into the realms of existentialism and self-reckoning, Kieran Brunt and Matt Huxley craft a mesmerising narrative woven with lush soundscapes and evocative lyricism. Shot in St Barnabas Church in London, the accompanying video captures the essence of Strange Boy's live performances – wild, theatrical, and deeply emotive.\n\nBrunt and Huxley's collaborative journey began in 2011, evolving gradually over the years as they honed their sound and narrative prowess. Influenced by luminaries such as Anohni, The Magnetic Fields, and Rufus Wainwright, the duo masterfully combines bold narrative thrust with grandiose symbolism, resulting in a suite of impressionistic songs that exist in atmospheric soundworlds.\n\nThe album's production journey mirrors its thematic weight, with Brunt finding inspiration in the crypt of a Victorian church in London. Collaborating with producer Richard Formby in Yorkshire, Strange Boy imbues their music with a hauntingly atmospheric quality.\n\nBrunt and Huxley's collaborative journey began in 2011, evolving gradually over the years as they honed their sound and narrative prowess.
