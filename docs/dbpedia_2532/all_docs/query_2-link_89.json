        "text": "Well, that was fast: Less than a week after Zayn Malik officially left One Direction, the 22-year-old has had his first piece of solo material unveiled to the world. Naughty Boy, the U.K. producer who joined Malik in the studio over the weekend, posted a demo called ‚ÄúI Won‚Äôt Mind‚Äù online on Monday (March 30).\n\nUnlike Naughty Boy‚Äôs worldwide smash ‚ÄúLa La La,‚Äù ‚ÄúI Won‚Äôt Mind‚Äù is a heartfelt, elliptical folk song in which Malik croons over an acoustic guitar, ‚ÄúWe are who we are when no one‚Äôs watching/And right from the start, you know I got you.‚Äù The song sounds incomplete, but Malik‚Äôs vulnerability sounds real and well-earned; ‚ÄúI Won‚Äôt Mind‚Äù doesn‚Äôt necessarily need elaborate production to be affecting.\n\n‚ÄúLet the music do the talking guys. thank us later. üôÇ x,‚Äù Naughty Boy posted on Twitter with the song. He added in the Soundcloud description, ‚ÄúThere is nothing but love for what was left behind. thats why we don‚Äôt mind. üòâ #2016 #zaughty #zindabad.‚Äù That #2016 hashtag hints at the big plans Malik and Naughty Boy apparently have for next year.\n\nLast week, One Direction announced plans to continue as a quartet without Malik, with a world tour continuing as planned and a new album due out later this year.\n\nEarlier on Monday, Naughty Boy got into a Twitter argument with 1D‚Äôs Louis Tomlinson, who felt that the producer was bragging online about working with Malik:\n\nNaughty Boy tried to explain himself to Tomlinson, but the Directioners have turned against the U.K. artist ‚Äî #SuspendNaughtyBoy began trending worldwide on Monday night."
