We talk about the band's dramatic identity change from their previous album, the poor reviews 'Pinkerton' originally received and frontman Rivers Cuomo's complicated relationship with the album. Dave opens up about about his early disastrous recording experience that coincided with discovering the album, whether the legacy of great art can be tarnished by the quality of subsequent work and 'Pinkerton's' connection to the opera.\n\nListen in the player above or download the episode by clicking here.\n\nSubscribe to the podcast in Apple Podcasts here or search 'My Favorite Album' wherever you listen to podcasts.\n\nMy Favorite Album is a podcast on the impact great music has on our lives.
