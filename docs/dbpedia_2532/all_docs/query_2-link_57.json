        "text": "Twenty-six years ago, the Backstreet Boys — AJ McLean, Howie Dorough, Nick Carter, Kevin Richardson, and Brian Littrell — came together to become one of the most beloved boy bands of all time. Their most popular songs of the late '90s and early ‘00s were “Quit Playing Games (With My Heart),” “Everybody (Backstreet’s Back),” and “All I Have To Give.” The band stayed together, but Kevin wasn’t a part of their albums Unbreakable (2007) and This Is Us (2009), because he pursued his career on Broadway.\n\nRELATED: The Best '90s Songs You Can Listen to Right Now\n\nKevin permanently rejoined in 2012, and the band released the album In a World Like This. The Backstreet Boys have been touring ever since, and kicked off their DNA World Tour in 2019. All five men are married and have kids.\n\nThough they were briefly called the Silver Beatles, John Lennon, Paul McCartney, and George Harrison got together as 15- and 16-year-olds in the late '50s. By 1962, Ringo Starr joined as their drummer and they released their first single, “Love Me Do”/”PS I Love You.” Their US takeover really started when they appeared on The Ed Sullivan Show and belted it out for more than 73 million people in February 1964. Two months later, they made history by filling the top five spots of Billboard’s Hot 100 chart. They split in 1970 and went on to have solo careers.\n\nRELATED: 50+ Years of the Best Summer Songs Ever\n\nJohn was fatally shot outside his New York City apartment building in 1980, and George died at the age of 58 after being treated for lung cancer and a brain tumor in 2001. Most recently, the two surviving members — Paul and Ringo — shocked audience members (and the world) when they reunited for a special performance at Dodger Stadium in July 2019.\n\nDonnie Wahlberg teamed up with pal Danny Wood and two others in 1984, but the unnamed group members were later replaced by Joe McIntyre and brothers Jordan and Jonathon Knight. They were between the ages 12 and 16, and debuted their album New Kids on the Block in 1986. After releasing three albums together, they disbanded in 1994 (but later reunited in 2007).\n\nRELATED: 35 Best Love Songs of All Time\n\nThey’ve released new albums, gone on a New Kids on the Block Cruise, and played with The Backstreet Boys at Fenway Park … to name just a few things they’ve done over the past decade or so. Donnie became famous in his own right, opened the restaurant chain Wahlburgers and starred in two reality shows, one of which was with his wife Jenny McCarthy.\n\nIn 1962, brothers Michael, Marlon, Jackie, Tito, and Jermaine formed their band The Jackson 5. By 1969, the song “I Want You Back” went to No. 1. Lead singer Michael stepped away from the band to pursue his solo career.\n\nSoon after The Backstreet Boys got started, the band’s manager Lou Pearlman brought together Chris Kirkpatrick, Joey Fatone, and former Mickey Mouse Club co-stars Justin Timberlake and JC Chasez. Lance Bass was later added to the group, and 'N Sync was born. They introduced themselves in Europe first, and really made a name for themselves in the U.S. after Disney Channel aired the special, “NSYNC Live In Concert\" in July 1998. Justin released his first solo album Justified in 2002, and their last performance together was in 2004.\n\nThe group reunited for a special performance at the 2013 VMAs, and got back together when they were honored with a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame. Justin has since won 10 Grammys, and shares son Silas with his wife Jessica Biel. Chris, Joey, and Lance are all married, and JC is reportedly single.\n\nMany forget that this crew was initially established as a TV show. In 1965, ads were calling out for “insane boys, age 17–21” who wanted to star in it. In the end, Micky Dolenz, Michael Nesmith, Peter Tork, and Davy Jones were the actors/singers selected for the roles. They went on to win the comedy award at the 1967 Emmys.\n\nDavy suffered a heart attack in 2012 and Peter, who toured with Micky and Michael in 2016, died in February 2019 after a “10-year bout” with a rare cancer. Micky and Michael paid tribute to their former bandmates with a tour in early 2019, and Micky had a solo tour in the summer.\n\nEvery early '00s kid certainly expected to see these three on the list. Seventeen-year-old Kevin, 15-year-old Joe, and 12-year-old Nick Jonas signed with Columbia Records in 2005 and they were originally called Sons of Jonas. They toured with the likes of Kelly Clarkson, The Cheetah Girls, and The Backstreet Boys, and then released their first album in 2006. By 2009, they released their fourth album, starred in Disney Channel’s Jonas, and started filming the sequel to Disney’s hit movie Camp Rock.\n\nWhile they officially split in 2013, the brothers remained close. Kevin started his family with wife Danielle, Nick pursued Broadway and a solo career, and Joe started the band DNCE. But in 2019, fans were over the moon when they reunited to release the song “Sucker,\" and the video included the brothers’ three wives (Nick married Priyanka Chopra in 2018 and Joe married Sophie Turner in 2019). Most recently, they confirmed a tour is happening.\n\nNothing made people want to head to the nearest beach quite like the tunes of The Beach Boys, which comprised musicians Brian Wilson, Carl Wilson, Dennis Wilson, Al Jardine, and Mike Love. It all started in 1961, when the Wilson brothers formed a band with their cousin Mike and classmate Al. By 1966, more than 20 of their songs broke into the top 40.\n\nThough they still technically tour today, it’s not the same group we saw in the '60s. Dennis tragically drowned in 1983, and his brother Carl died from lung cancer in 1998. The surviving band members haven’t always been on the same page, but they came together for a rare reunion and interview in 2018.\n\nThe British group kicked off with a campaign seeking out young men who could sing and dance. From there, Robbie Williams, Mark Owen, Jason Orange, and Howard Donald were selected to join Gary Barlow in the band, “Kick-It.” A name change, tours, and plenty of hits later, Take That made history as one of the most iconic boy bands ever. Robbie left the group in 2005, but rejoined in 2010.\n\nRobbie left for a second time in 2014, and Jason left soon after that. In 2018, the band released a new video for their song, “Pray.” Robbie, Howard, Gary, and Mark are all married and have children.\n\nRalph Tresvant, Johnny Gill, Mike Bivins, Ronnie Devoe, Ricky Bell, and Bobby Brown — childhood friends from Boston — became known for their songs “Candy Girl,” “Cool It Now,” and more. There was drama throughout their reign as a popular musical group in the '80s, but much of it surrounded Bobby, who was voted out of the band.\n\nMany remember New Edition because of what transpired in Bobby’s personal life, and more specifically, his tumultuous relationship with Whitney Houston. There was a mini-series called The New Edition Story that was released about the group in 2017. Later that year, the R&B legends all took the stage for a historic performance at the BET Awards."
