        "text": "Herb Alpert...wasn't the song #1 for a period of time back in July, 1968? I seem to recall that this was the only #1 song the TJB had, and it was an interesting point that it was a vocal from a instrumental group. I seem to recall something like that.\n\nWhile we're on the topic, did you know that Herb also recorded this song in Spanish and Italian? Yo Soy Ese Amor (b/w Love So Fine - A&M 960), the Spanish version appeared as a U.S. single. The English version appeared on the Mexican album, Herb Alpert Gold Series (A&M / PolyGram LPR 73041 - 39 6948 1), with the more literal title, Este Chico Enamorado De Ti. And the Italian version, Un Ragazzo Che Ti Ama (b/w Hello, Dolly), appeared as A&M Italy single 825, with a date of 8/22/68.\n\nOther stats:\n\nDionne's version was on the top 40 for 11 weeks beginning 2/8/69.\n\nHerb's version was #1 for 4 weeks, and was in the top 40 for 12 weeks starting 5/25/68.\n\nInteresting factoid: \"Rise\" was actually in the top 40 longer than \"This Guy\" (15 weeks as opposed to 12) but was only #1 for two weeks.\n\nAnd on a font level: Mr. Alpert's \"TGILWY\" recording, when released as A&M single #929, was the first pressing from Columbia's Pitman, NJ plant to use Pitman's gallery of Linotype fonts for the label copy, since Chris Montez' \"There Will Never Be Another You\" (#810). In the two-year interregnum, Columbia East Coast pressings of A&M releases used West Coast typefaces (from Santa Maria, CA) entirely; from here until late 1969, they would alternate. Sometimes on the same release (\"Black Pearl\" by Sonny Charles, #1053, as an example). After that, each of Columbia's plants used their own fonts for A&M releases.\n\nOh, and did I mention I've always been partial to Herb's version?\n\nWhat was the song that Herb Alpert's \"This Guy's In Love With You\" edged-out from making the top-of-the-charts? Richard Harris' \"MacArthur Park\" or Mason Williams' \"Classical Gas\"...?\n\nFunny how just when I was hearing Herb's new songs that were instrumentals, that I caught one of his \"oldies\" and the first time I heard him singing; of course what made it recognizable was his trumpet solo...\n\nDave\n\n...and wondering if \"TG'sILWY\" was #1, then what was #2...?"
