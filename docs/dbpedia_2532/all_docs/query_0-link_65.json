        "text": "An actress who always attracts audiences' attention, Jennifer Tilly is by turns funny, sexy, compassionate, compelling and often all at once. She has been playing unforgettable characters ever since she started her career as an actress.\n\nJennifer Tilly was born Jennifer Ellen Chan in Harbor City, Los Angeles, to Harry Chan, a used car salesman, who was of Chinese origin, and Patricia (née Tilly), a schoolteacher and stage actress. Her sister is actress Meg Tilly. They were raised on rural Texada Island, British Columbia, by her mother and stepfather, John Ward.\n\nJennifer successfully cultivated another fan base with the revitalization of the \"Child's Play\" horror comedy franchise. For Ronny Yu's Chucky und seine Braut (1998), the filmmakers turned to Jennifer to create the character who would spark the series in a new direction. She met the challenge and established a new horror icon in Tiffany. In Rogue Pictures' Seed of Chucky (2004), written and directed by series creator Don Mancini, Jennifer again took the popular series to the next level; starring as Tiffany and as herself, the deadly doll's favorite actress, who soon becomes an unwitting hostess in more ways than one.\n\nJennifer's pitch-perfect voiceover work as Tiffany is not the only instance of her being able to incarnate a character from the vocal chords out. Families know her distinctive cadences from the Disney hits Die Kühe sind los! (2004), directed by Will Finn and John Sanford; Die Geistervilla (2003) (in which Jennifer acted from the neck up only), directed by Rob Minkoff; and the Pixar blockbuster Die Monster AG (2001) (voicing Mike's love interest Celia), directed by Pete Docter, David Silverman and Lee Unkrich. She began her acting career as a teenager, putting herself through the theater program at Stephens College in Missouri by winning writing competitions. She then headed to Los Angeles, California. While she continued to act on the stage (earning a Dramalogue Award for her performance in \"Vanities\"), movies and television immediately came calling for the actress with the unique voice and visage.\n\nIn 2001, she starred in the Broadway revival of \"The Women\" with Cynthia Nixon and Kristen Johnson, which was later taped for, and broadcast on, PBS. In 2008, she appeared with Miranda Richardson in the critically acclaimed production of Wallace Shawn's play \"Grasses of a Thousand Colors\" at the Royal Court Theatre in London. Other plays include \"Tartuffe\" (LAAT) \"Boy's Life\" (LAAT) \"Baby with the Bathwater\" (LAPT) and others too numerous to mention. In 2005, Jennifer met her boyfriend, professional poker player Phil Laak (also known as the Unabomber). That summer at the World Series of Poker, she bested a field of 601 to take down the Ladies Event and win a coveted gold bracelet. She followed this up by winning the WPT Ladies Invitational, making her one of a small but elite group holding both a WSOP bracelet, and a WPT title. In summer 2010, she also won the Bellagio Cup 5k tournament.\n\nVictoria was raised in a Bible-believing, piano-playing, gymnastic home with no TV. Her dad was a gym coach so she competed in gymnastics from age 5 to 18. Was a cheerleader and a homecoming queen. Attended Florida Bible College; received a gymnastic scholarship to Furman University, attended Auburn University one year and ended up in Hollywood, California via summer-stock in Birmingham, where she met Johnny Crawford (The Rifleman). Crawford sent her a one-way ticket to the show-biz capital and put her in his night club act. Supporting herself as a cigarette girl and as a typist at the American Cancer Society, and waitress at The Kipling Retirement Hotel, she performed stand-up comedy for two years until Johnny Carson put her act (which consisted of her doing a handstand while reciting poetry) on national TV. Following 7 appearances with Johnny, she starred in many movies and TV shows, most notably, Saturday Night Live (1986-1992).\n\nIn 1991, she re-united with her high school sweetheart, married him, and moved to Florida where he was a police helicopter pilot. She raised a family and recorded two children's album, \"Ukulele Lady,\" and \"Ukulele Ditties for Itty Bitty Kiddies,\" by Choo Choo Records, and produced a collection of her original songs, \"Use Me,\" by Birdie Singer Publishing. In 2012, Jackson's husband retired and they followed their grown daughters and grandchildren to Nashville where Jackson continues to perform her songs and stand up onstage. She still does an occasional movie or TV show, most recently she appeared in \"Matchbreaker\" on Netflix, played the wife of Eric Estrada in the Pureflix sitcom, \"Malibu Dan (2018), and played Alma in \"Lost Heart\" (2020).\n\nJackson authored \"Is My Bow Too Big?\" in 2012, about how she got on TV, published by White Hall, and she authored \"Lavender Hair,\" published by Broadstreet, about her breast cancer journey and recovery in 2017. Jackson got her Master's Degree in Film from Lipscomb University in 2021.\n\nShe is in pre-production for a reality show about her singing at the Grand Ol' Opry, and is producing a feature film that she wrote, Jane Blond Saves the World (One Mistake at a Time).\n\nMichel'le Toussant is a vocalist, songwriter, and R&B artist. She is known for her squeaky, child like speaking voice, which is a startling contrast to her strong vocals. Michel'le was the featured female vocalist on the World Class Wreckin' Crew's 1988 single \"Turn Off The Lights\".\n\nShe was originally signed to Eazy-E's Ruthless Record label that released her self-titled debut album, \"Michel'le in 1989. Her debut album which was entirely produced by Dr. Dre, contained the classic \"No More Lies\" also hit singles \"Nicety\" and \"Something in my Heart\". The album Michel'le sold over 1.5 million copies and generated two music videos for the singles from the album. She also toured throughout the United Kingdom in support of the album.\n\nIn 1997 Michel'le released her second album titled \"Hung Jury\" in which she released the hit \"Hang Time\". In 2003 she appeared on the Dysfunktional Family Soundtrack.\n\nReturning from a hiatus, Michel'le gracefully takes the stage with her powerful vocals. Unforgettable performances at events such as \"Chocolate Sunday\" at \"The Savoy Entertainment Center\" in Inglewood, CA left audiences requesting for more. By popular demand, she returned for performances on August 2009 and again on September 2009 with Hip Hop Artist \"YoYo\". In October 2009 Michel'le performed at \"Taste of Soul\" in Los Angeles, CA with an audience of over 100,000 people.\n\nDecember 2009 she performed her new single \"Freedom To Love\" at The Annual House Full of Toys benefit concert held at the Nokia Theater in Los Angeles. Michel'le shared the stage with extraordinary artists such as, Stevie Wonder, The Jonas Brothers, Robin Thicke, and India Arie, just to name a few. On January 2010 she performed at Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. celebration for the city of Long Beach, CA and invited back in 2011 performing a special tribute to the late Teena Marie. In February 2010 she began her nation wide tour including cities such as Los Angeles, Chicago, Dallas, Seattle, Miami, Houston, Las Vegas, St. Louis, Oakland,and Atlanta to name a few.\n\nMay 2010, while on tour, Michel'le was invited to perform at The Females of Hip Hop Awards in Los Angeles. Just a year later in 2011, The Females of Hip Hop Awards honored Michel'le with the Legendary Songstress Award.\n\nCurrently exploring popular cities across the United States, Michel'le continues her tour. She has graced the stage with other amazing artists including Brian McKnight, Boyz II Men, Donnell Jones, Anthony Hamilton, Faith Evans, Dru Hill, Kenny Lattimore, Carl Thomas, and the list goes on. February 2012, Michel'le performed her hit classic \"Something In My Heart\" at Kelly Price's Grammy Party. March 2012, as a featured artist on Tom Joyner's \"Fantastic Voyage\" Cruise 2012, she joined Dougie Fresh, Fantasia, Ruben Studdard, Chante' Moore, Queen Latafia, SWV, and Da Brat among others for a week long of dynamic performances.\n\nNot only is Michel'le a gifted vocalist, April 2012 she demonstrated her versatility. She debuted her acting skills as one of the stars in Derrell Lawrence's hit stage play \"Do You Trust Your Best Friend?\" along side legendary Angela Winbush. Executing her role well, Michel'le has been offered a recurring position. In addition to her new acting endeavors, she is also doing voice projects.\n\nMost Recently (February 2013), Michel'le was named as one of the new cast members of R&B Divas: LA. The show will begin production this month in Los Angeles with an expected premier in Q3 of 2013.\n\nMichel'le is also, currently(2013), in the studio working on her new project to be announced and released soon.\n\nPamela Denise Anderson was born on Canada Day, Saturday 1 July 1967, in Ladysmith, British Columbia, Canada at 4:08 PST, to young newlywed parents, Barry Anderson and Carol Anderson.

Because of her fame in Vancouver, she signed a commercial contract with Labatt's beer to be the Blue Zone girl. More advertising assignments followed, and soon Playboy approached her. In October 1989, Pamela was on the cover of Playboy magazine.\n\nWith success from Playboy, Pamela Anderson moved to Los Angeles, California in 1990. In 1991, she made her television debut on Hör' mal, wer da hämmert (1991), where she starred as Lisa, the Tool Time Girl.

She was then on one of the most viewed television series worldwide. She made her big screen debut on Good Cop Bad Cop (1994). Soon after, Pamela met Mötley Crüe drummer Tommy Lee on New Year's Eve 1994 in New York City. In February 1995, they got married in Cancun, Mexico. They both returned to Los Angeles and stunned the world.\n\nIn the spring of 1996, Pamela starred as the title role of Barb Wire (1996). While filming, she suffered a miscarriage. Pamela and Tommy were devastated, but there was hope for the couple when, on June 6, 1996, Brandon Thomas Lee was born. Soon later, a pornographic video of Pamela and Tommy was stolen from their home. Both of them sued an Internet website for stealing the video. Their case was not settled and the video is still on the Internet. Meanwhile, Pamela and Tommy were having a rocky marriage, but, on December 29, 1997, Dylan Jagger Lee was born.

Jane Wiedlin has also had a solo musical career. As a child, Wiedlin liked to listen to pop music, especially songs by The Beatles and The Monkees. By the time she was a teenager, Wiedlin was a fan of Sparks. Years later, she would record \"Cool Places\" with them.\n\nWiedlin attended William Howard Taft High School in Los Angeles from 1972 until 1976. While attending college in the Los Angeles area, for fashion design, Wiedlin worked at a fashion design house where she created song lyrics, by scribbling down ideas on clothing patterns. \"Jane Drano,\" as she came to be known, would later design punk-style clothing that she sold at Granny Takes a Trip, a store on Sunset Boulevard. She became part of the scene that spawned bands like X, The Germs, and The Weirdos. Wiedlin and Belinda Carlisle formed The Go-Go's as a punk band called the Misfits in 1978, with Margot Olaverra on bass, and Elissa Bello on drums. In 1981, Wiedlin and Terry Hall of Fun Boy Three and The Specials co-wrote \"Our Lips Are Sealed\". The song peaked on the Billboard charts at No. 20 and remained on the charts until 1982.

Wiedlin's early acting credits include a brief appearance in several films. Wiedlin has also provided voices for several characters in television and film animation.\n\nCute as a button and with a petite, porcelain prettiness and vulnerability that endeared her to the American public, Sally Struthers nabbed a series role in the early 1970s and became a solid part of TV history as a member of a dysfunctional family quartet in the milestone sitcom, Es bleibt in der Familie (1971).\n\nShe was born Sally Ann Struthers, the daughter of a surgeon, on July 28, 1948, in Portland, Oregon. Raised there, she pursued an acting career following high school. She eventually moved to Los Angeles and trained at the Pasadena Playhouse College of Theatre Arts, earning a scholarship as its \"most promising student.\" She performed briefly in regional stock plays until finding her break as both a commercial actress and dancer on TV.\n\nA recurring dancer/performer on such variety shows as The Smothers Brothers Summer Show (1970) and The Tim Conway Comedy Hour (1970), the pert-nosed, blue-eyed, curly blonde cutie showed starlet promise in films, offering ditsy support in the Jack Nicholson starrer, Five Easy Pieces - Ein Mann sucht sich selbst (1970), and the chase film, The Getaway - Ihre Chance ist gleich null (1972), top-lining Steve McQueen and Ali MacGraw.\n\nAnd, then came the iconic series Es bleibt in der Familie (1971). Also starring Carroll O'Connor and Jean Stapleton as conservative parents Archie and Edith, and Rob Reiner as liberal husband Mike, Struthers went on to win two supporting Emmy Awards and four Golden Globe nominations as kewpie-doll Gloria Bunker Strivic, Archie Bunker's \"little goil.\"\n\nSeen occasionally guesting elsewhere on such popular TV programs as \"Love, American Style,\" \"The Courtship of Eddie's Father,\" \"Ironside,\" \"Laugh-In,\" \"Sonny and Cher\" and as the voice of teenage Pebbles Flintstone on the spin-off cartoon series The Pebbles and Bamm-Bamm Show (1971), Sally, along with Rob, finally left the popular family show after seven seasons, both eager to grow away from their strong TV images. While Reiner stepped away from the camera and became a noted director, Sally continued to act. She made her Broadway debut in \"Wally's Cafe\" in 1981 and returned, four years later, with a gender-bending version of \"The Odd Couple\" as neat-freak \"Florence\" opposite Rita Moreno's slovenly \"Olive\". In addition, she found steady work in both topical and light-hearted 70's TV movies with Aloha Means Goodbye (1974), Hey, I'm Alive (1975), Der große Houdini (1976), My Husband Is Missing (1978), ...And Your Name Is Jonah (1979), A Gun in the House (1981), to name a few.\n\nWhen offers began to dry up for Sally, she returned to the TV series fold in the early 1980s spinning off her \"Gloria\" character, sans Rob Reiner, with the self-titled sitcom, Gloria (1982). Without Reiner (the plot had the couple split and her focusing on raising son Joey), the ensemble formula that worked so well for her earlier was missing here and the show died in its freshman year. To compensate, however, Sally's baby-doll voice worked extremely well for her in cartoons. She remained active off-camera, providing little girl voices for Saturday morning entertainment, notably her teenage \"Pebbles Flintstone\" character.\n\nIn addition to Yo Yogi! (1991) and Tiny Toon Abenteuer (1990), other TVanimated voice-over work included Käpt'n Balu & seine tollkühne Crew (1990) as \"Rebecca 'Becky' Cunningham\" and, notably, puppeteer Jim Henson's creative prehistoric sitcom, Die Dinos (1991), playing dino-daughter \"Charlene Sinclair.\"\n\nAs she grew older, Sally continued delighting fans with broader shtick in plus-sized parts. She showed that she had lost none of the fun for which she was known, by providing hearty comedy relief when she joined the prime-time series 9 to 5 (1982) and as a guest in \"Charles in Charge,\" \"Sister Kate\" and \"Murder, She Wrote.\"\n\nThe musical stage was another popular venue. Over the years, she has patented the by-the-book principal \"Miss Lynch\", with her many \"Grease\" tours, and as the scheming orphanage operator \"Miss Hannigan\" in a number of road productions of \"Annie.\" She went on to cop a 2002 Los Angeles \"Ovation\" award for her delightfully over-the-top \"Agnes Gooch\" in \"Mame\", starring Carol Lawrence and in 2012, she performed in both \"Always...Patsy Cline\" as Louise Segar, and \"9 to 5: The Musical\" as nosy Roz Klein. In 2014, Struthers toured in the 50th anniversary production in the title role of \"Hello, Dolly!\"\n\nInto the millennium, Sally has guested on such series as \"Sabrina, the Teenage Witch\" and \"The Division,\" had recurring roles on Still Standing (2002) and Gilmore Girls (2000), and was seen in featured or cameo roles in such independent films as the drama A Month of Sundays (2001), the mystery thriller Reeseville (2003), the Mario Van Peebles biopic How to Get the Man's Foot Outta Your Ass (2003), the comedy Monster Heroes (2010), and the musical comedies Waiting in the Wings: The Musical (2014), Hollywood Musical! (2015), Waiting in the Wings: Still Waiting (2018) and Christmas Harmony (2018).\n\nDivorced, Sally is the mother of one daughter who has made a career for herself as a clinical psychologist.\n\nFor years, Sally was a prime spokesperson for the Christian Children's Fund on TV, fervently (and often tearfully) appealing for viewer's monetary assistance in finding an end to starvation in under-developed countries.\n\nHer Orthodox Jewish family was totally averse to her having an entertainment career. Her parents and grandparents forced her to leave the Theatre Guild school (New York) while still a teenager and had their wills drawn up accordingly so as to discourage this career choice.\n\nStudied drama at Columbia University, and belonged to the American Theatre Wing.\n\nWhen Mae was 17 and living in the South Bronx, she won a local contest to find the girl who most resembled Helen Kane, a popular singer known as the \"Boop-Oop-A-Doop Queen\". She was promptly signed by an agent and began performing in the Vaudeville circuit. Billing herself as \"Mae Questel - Personality Singer of Personality Songs,\" she performed dead-on vocal imitations of Maurice Chevalier, Eddie Cantor, Fanny Brice, Marlene Dietrich, Mae West and of course Helen Kane, among many others. Her mimic talent also provided duck, dog, chicken, owl, monkey, lion and baby sounds for radio shows.\n\nBetty Boop creator Max Fleischer heard Mae doing her \"boop-oop-a-doop\" routine and hired her to do the character's voice in 1931. She served as the voice on more than 150 Betty Boop animated shorts until the character was retired in 1939. Her recording of \"On The Good Ship Lollipop\" sold more than 2 million during the Depression.\n\nBest known as the voice of \"Betty Boop\", she was also the voice of not-so-less-famous \"Olive Oyl\" in the Popeye cartoons, as well as the toddler Swee'pea and others. She did Popeye's voice once, in the cartoon Shape Ahoy (1945), because Jack Mercer was serving in the military during World War II. Her versatility is probably better appreciated in the cartoon Never Kick a Woman (1936) in which she provides the quivery, nervous-Nellie voice of Olive Oyl, based on comedic actress Zasu Pitts, and the deep, assured, alluring voice of the blonde saleswoman, based on Mae West.\n\nIn 1968, the City of Indianapolis honored her with a \"Mae Questel Day\". In 1979, she won the Troupers Award for outstanding contribution to entertainment.\n\nJennifer Garner, who catapulted into stardom with her lead role on the television series Alias: Die Agentin (2001), has come a long way from her birthplace of Houston, Texas. Raised in Charleston, West Virginia by her mother Patricia Ann (née English), a retired English teacher, and her father, Billy Jack Garner, a former chemical engineer, she is the second of their three daughters. She spent nine years of her adolescence studying ballet, and characterizes her years in dance as consisting of determination rather than talent, being driven mostly by a love of the stage.\n\nJennifer took this determination with her when she enrolled at Denison University as a chemistry major; later she changed her major when she discovered that her passion for the stage was stronger than her love of science. New York attracted the young actress after college, and she worked as a hostess while pursuing a career in film and television. Her most recent move has been to Los Angeles, a decision that led to a role on the television series Felicity (1998), where she met her future husband Scott Foley. The couple divorced in 2004.\n\nJennifer starred in the television series Alias: Die Agentin (2001) as Agent Sydney Bristow, who works for the Central Intelligence Agency. For her work, Garner has received four consecutive Emmy nominations for Outstanding Lead Actress in a Drama Series. She has also received four Golden Globe nominations and won once, as well as received two Screen Actors Guild Award nominations, and won once. She has appeared in numerous other television production as well as such films as Elektra (2005), 30 über Nacht (2004), Daredevil (2003), Pearl Harbor (2001) and Ey Mann, wo is' mein Auto? (2000). Aside from filming Alias: Die Agentin (2001), Jennifer enjoys cooking, gardening, hiking, and--inspired by her character on the series--kickboxing. She married actor and filmmaker Ben Affleck in 2005, now her ex-husband, with whom she has three children.\n\nPatti Stanger is the star and executive producer of \"The Millionaire Matchmaker.\" An experienced third-generation matchmaker, Stanger founded her company, the Millionaire's Club, in January 2000.
