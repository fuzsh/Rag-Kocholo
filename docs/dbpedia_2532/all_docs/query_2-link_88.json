        "text": "Jelly Roll has a new song out today (8/2) called “Liar.” Written by him, the song is expected to be on his next album, which is slated for later this year.\n\nJelly posted a clip of the new music video to Instagram. He captioned the post, “Official music video for my new song Liar premieres Friday 5am CT on CMT and will play every hour.”\n\nJelly’s fans loved the new tune and many commented on his Instagram post. One fan said, “He just keeps them coming!!!” Another fan wrote, “Love you keep up the words.” On more fan commented, “Love love love this so much!!!”\n\nThe music video for “Liar” features Jelly, dressed in his signature black, complete with a ball cap, singing the song’s tough lyrics in an old and dark house. A guitar player sits on the couch next to where he stands and sings.\n\nRELATED: Jelly Roll, Machine Gun Kelly, Travis Barker: What They Created Together\n\nJelly’s glamorous life as a country superstar just hit a new high as he now stars in the music video for his Twisters movie song “Dead End Road.”\n\nIn the music video, Jelly drives down a dirt road in a huge pickup truck and runs from Twisters, adding “action movie star” to his many talents.\n\n“Dead Man Road’s” lyrics with chorus: “Cause that highway to hell is the road I’m on / I need to turn around before I’m too far gone / If I’m ever gonna make it on them streets of gold / I gotta quit livin’ on a dead end road / I’m a red-linin’, low-ridin’ anything but law-abidin’ / Feels too good to quit / I’m runnin’ off the edge, they say that I’m a wreck / Diggin’ me deeper than six.”\n\nJelly Roll posted a clip of the exciting new video to Instagram. He wrote, “My new single, “Dead End Road,” from the Twisters movie soundtrack, came out in mid-July. Get ready to chase the wind!”\n\nIn a second Instagram post, the country star posted a different clip, writing, “My new single, ‘Dead End Road,’ from the Twisters Movie Soundtrack, is out now.”\n\nMany of Jelly’s die-hard fans reacted to the post, including one who said, “Great inspiration.” Another fan commented, “I went from watching you do freestyles on YouTube as a kid and no one knowing you to the whole world knows you now, and you’re still killing it.\n\nNancy Brooks has been working in the country music industry for almost 30 years. She has interviewed pretty much any country star you can think of. In the late 1990s, she started working with Dolly Parton. And yes, Nancy reports that Parton is as sweet as you would think. She loves her life in country music and has been backstage at every CMA Awards show since the late 1990s. Many of her stories are from her one-on-one interviews. She was there at the beginning of the incredible careers of many music superstars today, including Taylor Swift, Shania Twain, and Blake Shelton, and has interviewed them multiple times throughout the years."
