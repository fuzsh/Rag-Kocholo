        "text": "The idea of becoming a minister was not a sudden one: Vincent had become increasingly engaged with religion even during his time in Paris. His letters to Theo were often full of references to faith:\n\n‘Adieu, old boy, may God make us brothers more and more and join us intimately to one another, and may the Love for Him make that bond ever stronger.’\n\nTo Theo from Isleworth, 3 October 1876\n\nHaving returned from England, Vincent spent three months working in a bookshop in Dordrecht.\n\n‘My dear Theo, The hours we spent together passed quickly, that small path behind the station where we saw the sun going down over the fields (...) I’ll walk there again and think of you.’\n\nVincent to Theo from Dordrecht, 26 February 1877\n\n‘In the south of Belgium (...) there is a region called the Borinage, where there is one of those populations of labourers who work in the many coal-mines. (...) I should like to go there as an evangelist.’\n\nTo Theo from Laeken, near Brussels, c. 13 November 1878\n\nMy dear Theo,\n\nIt’s with some reluctance that I write to you, not having done so for so long, and that for many a reason. Up to a certain point you’ve become a stranger to me, and I too am one to you, perhaps more than you think (...) I learned at Etten that you had sent fifty francs for me; well, I accepted them. Certainly reluctantly (...)but I’m in some sort of impasse or mess; what else can one do? And so it’s to thank you for it that I’m writing to you (...) and know that by writing you’ll do me good.’\n\nVincent to Theo from Cuesmes in Belgium, c. 22–24 June 1877\n\nVincent lived as a Protestant preacher among the impoverished miners of the Borinage region – the Walloon ‘Black Country’, where he was nicknamed ‘The Christ of the Coalmine’. Vincent gave away his possessions, gave Bible readings and visited the sick. His employers, however, did not consider him suitable for the work and let him go when his trial period ended.\n\nVincent moved back in with his parents again in late 1883, this time in Nuenen, where he set about painting farmers and weavers. Theo thought that the work Vincent was sending him was rather dark in colour, very different to the paintings being produced by modern artists in Paris. Vincent replied:\n\n‘I think that what you say is true, that my work will have to get much better, but at the same time also that your efforts to do something with it might also be a little more decisive...'\n\nYou have never yet sold a single thing of mine – not for a lot or a little – and IN FACT HAVEN’T TRIED TO YET. As you can see, I’m not getting angry about it – but – there’s no need to beat about the bush.\n\n‘It’s because I think you’d prefer to see me doing something good than doing nothing at all that I’m writing to you on this subject, and perhaps it would be a reason why good understanding and friendship might be re-established between the two of us, and we might perhaps be useful to one another.’\n\nVincent to Theo from Cuesmes in Belgium, 20 August 1880\n\nVincent moved back in with his parents in Etten, in the Dutch province of North Brabant, in 1881. Theo had meanwhile been appointed manager at the Goupil company in Paris. He had a good salary, which he was also willing to share:\n\n‘And this, first of all. I heard from Pa that you’ve already been sending me money without my knowing it, and in doing so are effectively helping me to get along. For this accept my heartfelt thanks.’ - Vincent to Theo, 2 April 1881\n\nBut you needn’t spare me, Theo, if it’s just a question of money, and if you, as friend and brother, retain some sympathy for the work, saleable or unsaleable. As long as that’s the case, that I still retain your sympathy in this respect, then it matters precious little to me (…)\n\nFollowing a row with his father, Vincent walked out of his parents’ house on Christmas Day 1881 and rented a studio in The Hague. Theo supported him as best he could, but did not try to hide his opinion of Vincent’s behaviour toward their parents:\n\n‘Dear Vincent,\n\n(...) but what the devil made you so childish and so shameless as to contrive in this way to make Pa and Ma’s life miserable and nearly impossible?’\n\nTheo to Vincent from Paris, 5 January 1882\n\nVincent wrote back to tell Theo what he thought of his parents’ rules and lifestyle. He did not regret leaving.\n\n‘Please bear with me if I pretend for the time being that Pa and Ma don’t exist (...) Still, I enjoy life and, in particular, having my own studio is too wonderful for words. When will you come and have coffee or tea with me? Soon I hope. You can stay here too, if necessary, that would be nice and companionable.’\n\nVincent to Theo from The Hague, 8 or 9 January 1882\n\nIn a letter to their sister Willemien:\n\n‘He is certainly an artist, and if what he makes now is not always beautiful, it will certainly be of use to him later; then his work will perhaps be sublime, and it would be a shame to have kept him from his regular study. However unpractical he may be, if he succeeds in his work there will certainly come a day when he will begin to sell his pictures.’\n\nTheo to Willemien van Gogh, from Paris, 14 March 1887\n\nTheo described in the same letter how difficult it was to share a home with Vincent:\n\n‘There was a time I loved Vincent and that he was my best friend, but that is now in the past. It appears to be even worse on his part, for he loses no opportunity to show that he detests me and that I repel him. This makes it almost unbearable for me at home.’\n\nFollowing Vincent’s departure, Theo wrote to their sister Willemien that he missed his brother:\n\n‘When he arrived here two years ago, I did not think we would become so attached, because there is a definite void here now that I am once more living alone in the apartment.’\n\nTheo to Willemien from Paris, 24 and 26 February 1888\n\nVincent received Gauguin with open arms. Their collaboration began promisingly enough, but tension soon arose between them and by early December Gauguin was thinking about moving on again.\n\n‘Gauguin and I talk a lot about Delacroix, Rembrandt &c. The discussion is excessively electric. We sometimes emerge from it with tired minds, like an electric battery after it’s run down.’\n\nVincent to Theo from Arles, 17 or 18 December 1888\n\n‘I myself feel, to the point of being mentally crushed and physically drained, the need to produce . . . I believe that the day will come when I’ll sell too, but I’m so far behind with you, and while I spend I bring nothing in. That feeling sometimes makes me sad.’\n\nVincent to Theo from Arles, c. 25 October 1888\n\nTheo’s reply:\n\n‘You talk about money that you owe me and that you wish to pay back to me. I know nothing of that. What I’d like to see you achieve would be that you never had that concern. . . . You don’t know how you grieve me when you say that you’ll have worked so much that you’ll feel that you haven’t lived.’\n\nTheo to Vincent from Paris, 27 October 1888\n\n'I found Vincent in the hospital in Arles. The people around him realized from his agitation that for the past few days he had been showing symptoms of that most dreadful illness, of madness, and an attack of fièvre chaude, when he injured himself with a knife, was the reason he was taken to hospital. Will he remain insane?’’\n\nTheo to his fiancée Jo Bonger from Paris, 28 December 1888\n\nVincent from the hospital:\n\n‘I’ll stay here at the hospital for another few days – then I dare plan to return home very calmly. Now I ask just one thing of you, not to worry, for that would cause me one worry too many.’\n\nVincent to Theo from Arles, 2 January 1889\n\nTheo married Jo Bonger in April 1889. She addressed her first letter to Vincent as her ‘dear brother’: ‘(…) and here in the house there are masses of things that are reminders of you, when I find a nice little jug or a vase or something, then it’s always: Vincent bought that or V. liked that so much – scarcely a day passes when we don’t speak of you. (…) There’s also one of your paintings hanging above the piano in our drawing room (...) – a large one which I like very much – it’s a landscape near Arles.’ - Jo to Vincent, 8 May 1889\n\n‘I hope that you’re well and your wife too, and that you’ll enjoy a little of the good weather. At least here we have splendid sunshine. As for me, my health is good, and as for the head it will, let’s hope, be a matter of time and patience.’\n\nVincent to Theo from Saint-Rémy, 31 May–6 June 1889\n\nWhenever possible, Vincent continued to draw and paint avidly in the relative peace of the institution. As always, he sent his completed work to Theo.\n\n‘My dear Vincent, Dr Peyron writes to me that you have again been seized by an attack of your illness. My poor brother, I’m infinitely sorry that things aren’t going as they should. (...) It’s the only cloud in our happiness, for my dear brother, the bad moment for Jo is over. She has brought into the world a fine boy who cries a lot but who seems to be in good health. (...) As we told you, we’ll name him after you...’\n\nTheo to Vincent from Paris, 31 January 1890\n\n‘Once back here I too still felt very saddened, and had continued to feel the storm that threatens you also weighing upon me. What can be done . . . I feared – not completely – but a little nonetheless – that I was a danger to you, living at your expense – but Jo’s letter clearly proves to me that you really feel that for my part I am working and suffering like you.’\n\nVincent to Theo, c. 10 July 1890\n\nI’ll always consider that you’re something other than a simple dealer in Corots, that through my intermediacy you have your part in the very production of certain canvases, which even in calamity retain their calm. For that’s where we are, and that’s all, or at least the main thing I can have to tell you in a moment of relative crisis."
