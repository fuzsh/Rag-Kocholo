To get any boy to fall in love with you, smile when you’re around him, which shows you’re an attractive and confident person. If you want to grab his attention, make eye contact with him until he notices you, then smile and look away. You should also use open body language when you’re talking to friends, such as keeping your arms open and standing tall, to show that you’re relaxed and comfortable. When you’re talking to the guy, flirt with him by gently teasing him about one of his interests, like his pet or video games. Additionally, lightly touch his arm or shoulder from time to time to let him know you’re attracted to him. Once you get to know him a bit better, tell him about your hopes or goals, such as becoming a pastry chef or event planner, since he won’t be able to love you unless he knows what makes you unique as a person. Remember to show that you’re interested in his interests as well by asking him questions about them so he doesn't think you're just focused on yourself.
