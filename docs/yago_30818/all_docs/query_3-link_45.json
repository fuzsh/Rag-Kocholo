        "text": "Meet Dr. Chris Cramer, DDS MS MBA\n\nI love helping people achieve life-changing smiles through the practice of orthodontics in a warm, compassionate environment with staff who will treat you like family. I felt so blessed when Dr. Pickering invited me to join his practice to continue the legacy of love and compassion toward his patients that he has cultivated for nearly 20 years. ​I have big shoes to fill, but will bring all of my education, family values, and faith to bear as I continue Dr. Pickering’s awesome legacy.\n\nAbout Me\n\nA Dallas native, I worked as a mechanical engineer for Motorola for 13 years before returning to school at Texas A&M / Baylor College of Dentistry in downtown Dallas where I earned a Doctor of Dental Surgery Degree, Master of Science in Oral Biology, and Certificate in Orthodontics. I was honored to receive the prestigious Harry Sicher Research Award, one of the highest orthodontic research awards for my master’s thesis on speeding up tooth movement. Quality care and patient safety are my passion. To this end, Governor Abbot appointed me out of all of the orthodontists in Texas to serve on the Texas State Dental Board as a Review Committee Member where I hear complaints to the dental board and meet with dentists and their attorneys to resolve these issues. I also served as President of the Texas Orthodontic Association where I influenced Texas legislation to protect dental patients from unsafe practices. I now serve on the Council of Government Affairs and as an Alternate Delegate for the American Association of Orthodontics where I meet with national representatives to shape the future of orthodontics and ensure patient safety.\n\nI am certain you want your orthodontist to stay on the cutting edge of orthodontics, right? This is why I worked very hard to obtain board certification by the American Board of Orthodontics (a distinction only l out of 4 orthodontists achieve) and I attend numerous hours of continuing education. I stay informed of the latest orthodontic treatment methods including Invisalign, surgically supported orthodontics, and the latest technological advancements to ensure you and your child receive the best care within my family-oriented orthodontic practice. Yes, this takes a lot of time and hard work, but your smile is worth it!\n\nMy Home Life\n\nAs my wife Kelley and I approach our 30th anniversary, we enjoy spending time with our beautiful twin daughters Courtney and Kerry at Texas A&M where they are busy college students. When I get a few minutes of spare time, you can find me in the garage in the middle of my next woodworking project.\n\nThank you for taking the time to learn a little more about me. Please know that I look forward to meeting and learning more about you, too!"
