        "text": "Addie Cramer appeared in Llanview in 1991 as the mentally ill mother of Blair Cramer. Abused as a child by her crazed mother, Addie spent most of her life in a mental institution. Although Addie resides at St. Anne's, she frequently is allowed to visit her family. A woman with a tender soul, Addie loved to express herself through crafts!\n\nIn 2007, Addie rushed to her daughter, Blair's, bedside when she was diagnosed with a heart infection and did her best to lend support to those who have always watched over her well-being.\n\nIn December of 2007, Addie had a remarkable change and appeared to be a new woman who wanted to make up for lost time by exploring everything around her - she even married David Vickers! While Blair couldn't have been happier, Dorian still feared Addie would have a set back and have to relocate from the mansion back to St. Ann's.\n\nHowever, Addie has spent her time being a sounding board for her family members and checking off many fun and exciting things on her 'to do' list'. She even married, then divorced, David Vickers in the name of fun!"
