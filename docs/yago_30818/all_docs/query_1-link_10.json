        "text": "Bob Saget's widow, Kelly Rizzo, has a new romance in her life.\n\nRizzo, who was married to the \"Full House\" star until his death in 2022, has confirmed she is in a relationship with \"Clueless\" and \"Road Trip\" actor Breckin Meyer.\n\nRizzo and Meyer attended a Grammys viewing party in Los Angeles on Sunday, where they posed for photos together and held hands.\n\nShe told E! News that after Saget's death, it \"took a while\" for her to feel comfortable dating again and \"to get to the point where I'm like, 'OK, I think he'd be happy with it.'\"\n\nRizzo, a blogger, married Saget in 2018. They met after the comedian sent her a direct message inviting her to one of his shows, according to a TikTok that Rizzo shared in 2021. \"And then I was like, 'Oh no, I kind of like him,\" she recalled. She was the \"Full House\" actor's second wife after he was married to Sherri Kramer, with whom he shared three children, from 1982 to 1997.\n\nSaget died in 2022 after he was found in a hotel room in Florida, where he had been performing stand-up. The cause of death was determined to be head trauma. Authorities \"concluded that he accidentally hit the back of his head on something, thought nothing of it and went to sleep,\" his publicist said.\n\nKelly Rizzo says the 'world still isn't the same' 6 months after Bob Saget's death\n\nRizzo told E! News that Saget's three adult children, Aubrey, Lara and Jennifer, gave her new relationship their blessing. \"It's wonderful, it just meant so much to have their blessing,\" she said. \"They're just angels. And to have them support is so meaningful.\"\n\nMeyer was previously married to director Deborah Kaplan, with whom he shares two children, until 2014.\n\n'Full House' cast cries remembering Bob Saget 2 years after his death\n\nIn January, Rizzo shared a tribute to Saget to mark the two-year anniversary of his death, reflecting on Instagram that it \"simultaneously feels like a week and an eternity\" since his passing.\n\n\"I will forever be grateful that I got to share life with this extraordinary person for 6 years,\" she wrote. \"What a blessing. And grateful I can look back on endless memories and photos and videos with smiles, laughter, and yesâ€¦still tears. It is such a gift I was able to know his complete and all encompassing love and heart.\""
