        "text": "The Cramer family is a long-running family of fictional characters on the Americansoap operaOne Life to Live. The popularity and longevity of the family began with the introduction of Dr. Dorian Cramer to the show, debuting on the series in April 1973.[1] Dorian's initial feud with original heroine Victoria Lord and relationship with her father Victor solidified the role into the series narrative. The character's ensuing popularity facilitated the writing of Cramer relatives onto the canvas, raising the family to prominence in storylines from the late 1970s through the original series finale in January 2012.[2] Members of the family of Dorian's great-niece and Victoria's niece, Starr Manning, debuted in-continuity on sister soap opera General Hospital from February 2012.[3]\n\nGenerations[]\n\nOnly current spouses are listed or those who were married when they died\n\nCharacters who are on the current OLTL and GH in bold\n\nNotable children who are stillborn or die before proper character development are italicized\n\nFirst generation[]\n\nDr. Louis Michael \"Lou\" Cramer (born November 25, 1917; died August 27, 1960)[4]\n\nSonya Roskova (born January 31, 1926; died February 13, 1998)[4][5][6]\n\nBetsy Cramer (died 2004)\n\nSecond generation[]\n\nAgatha \"Addie\" Cramer (born May 1, 1947)\n\nDorian Cramer (born March 4, 1948)\n\nVictor Lord [legally widowed]\n\nMel Hayes [widowed]\n\nDavid Vickers Buchanan\n\nMelinda Cramer (born 1952; died 2010)\n\nThird generation[]\n\nCassandra \"Cassie\" Reynolds (born September 11, 1968; via Dorian)\n\nBlair Cramer (born October 23, 1969; via Addie)[7]\n\nElijah Clarke [widowed]\n\nKelly Cramer (born 1977, changed to 1975; via Melinda)\n\nPaul Cramer (born c. 1982, died October 27, 2004; via Melinda)\n\nAdriana Cramer (born May 27, 1988; via Dorian)\n\nLangston Wilde (born 1992, adopted; via Dorian)\n\nFourth generation[]\n\nWilliam \"River\" Carpenter III (born December 24, 1993, changed to 1985, adopted; via Cassie)\n\nUnnamed Child (miscarriage, 1995; via Blair)\n\nStarr Manning (born January 8, 1996, changed to 1992; via Blair)\n\nBrendan Thornhart (stillborn, April 28, 1997; via Blair)\n\nJohn \"Jack\" Cramer Manning (born October 11, 2001, changed to 1995; via Blair)\n\nSamuel \"Sam\" Manning (born February 5, 2006, changed to July 15, 2004, adopted; via Blair)\n\nUnnamed Child (miscarriage, 2006; via Blair)\n\nZane Buchanan (born October 31, 2006, changed to 1995; via Kelly)\n\nFifth generation[]\n\nHope Manning-Thornhart (born November 6, 2008, died February 28, 2012; via Starr)\n\nOverview[]\n\nEnter Dorian and Melinda[]\n\nCramer Family The Cramer Women on One Life to Live One Life to Live\n\nGeneral Hospital Information Place(s) of Origin One Life to Live Duration 1973-present Notable members Blair Cramer\n\nDorian Lord\n\nAdriana Cramer\n\nStarr Manning\n\nKelly Cramer\n\nAddie Cramer\n\nMelinda Cramer\n\nCassie Callison\n\nPaul Cramer\n\nLangston Wilde Cramer\n\nPaul Cramer\n\nJack Manning\n\nSam Manning (adoptive)\n\nHope Manning-Thornhart Address La Boulaie, 56 Lincoln Street\n\nLlanview, Pennsylvania 19100\n\nMelinda Cramer One Life to Live Portrayed by Patricia Pearcy (1973–74)\n\nJane Badler (1978–81, 1983)\n\nSharon Gabet (1987–89)\n\nNicole Orth-Pallavicini (1997, 2004) Duration 1973–74, 1978–81, 1983, 1987–89, 1997, 2004 First appearance Template:Start date Last appearance Template:End date Created by Agnes Nixon\n\nGordon Russell Introduced by Doris Quinlan Profile Family Cramer Gender Female Occupation Pianist\n\nRelationships Parents Lou Cramer\n\nSonya Roskova Siblings Dorian Cramer Lord\n\nAddie Cramer Spouses Peter Janssen (1978–81) Romances Mark Toland\n\nJon Russell\n\nMax Holden Children Kelly Cramer\n\nPaul Cramer Grandchildren Zane Buchanan Aunts and uncles Betsy Cramer Nieces and nephews Blair Cramer\n\nCassie Callison\n\nAdriana Cramer\n\nLangston Wilde (adoptive) Other relatives Starr Manning\n\nJack Manning\n\nSam Manning (adoptive)\n\nWilliam Sloan Carpenter\n\nRiver Carpenter (adoptive)\n\nHope Manning-Thornhart\n\nMain article: Dorian Lord\n\nDr. Dorian Cramer arrives in Llanview on April 30, 1973[1] with unstable younger sister Melinda Cramer. Both of their parents are assumed to have died in a plane crash en route to visit an injured Melinda, whose promising career as a pianist was ended by a fall that had paralyzed her arm (it is later revealed their mother survived). Having apparently lost a third sister to pneumonia, Dorian and Melinda are each other's only family.\n\nDorian treats Eileen Riley Siegel for her addiction to painkillers, and soon became romantically involved with Dr. Mark Toland (Tommy Lee Jones), the husband of Eileen's daughter Julie. A furious Melinda, who had also developed a crush on Mark, became further unhinged. When Melinda's plan to stab Dorian and Mark in bed fails in 1974, Dorian has her sister institutionalized.\n\nDorian is suspended from Llanview Hospital in 1974 for her involvement in the death of a patient, and she blames hospital board member Viki (who had actually voted in Dorian's favor) for the decision. She and Viki spar further when Dorian becomes Victor's private physician, but their rivalry is cemented when Victor announced that he had married Dorian in May 1975. Victor's long-lost son Tony Harris comes to town and Dorian, hoping to maintain her hold on Victor's fortune, soon manipulates events to make father and son bitter enemies. After Victor's mysterious death in 1976, the shadow of implicating suspicion surrounds Dorian for decades.\n\nMelinda returns[]\n\nA recovered Melinda returns to Llanview in 1978, but soon sabotages Dorian's new relationship with Dr. Peter Janssen, wanting him for herself. Melinda seems to win when she and Peter elope, but her obsessive-compulsive behavior returns. Resuming her career as a concert pianist, Melinda practices day and night, putting a strain on her marriage to Peter. She becomes more unbalanced when a failed audition put a close to her musical ambitions. In 1979, Melinda checks herself into the Compton Clinic. Dorian then has Melinda declared mentally incompetent; by 1980, Peter hopes to marry Jenny Wolek Vernon, but couldn't divorce Melinda until she was mentally stable. After threatening Jenny with a letter opener and sinking further into psychosis, Melinda returns to the clinic in 1981.\n\nMelinda returns again in 1987, and moves into Dorian's penthouse with Cassie, the latter who leaves Llanview in 1988. Melinda has a relationship with Jon Russell, and leaves town herself in 1989. Dorian returns that same year, followed by Cassie in 1991. Much to Dorian's chagrin, Cassie becomes involved with Bo Buchanan. Dorian's machinations (and a failed attempt to kill Cassie by Bo's insane ex, Alex Olanov) did not stop the couple from marrying, but the reappearance of Bo's presumed-dead wife Sarah Gordon ultimately ends the union. Template:-\n\nBlair's revenge[]\n\nIn 1991, Blair Daimler came to Llanview with a secret — she was the daughter of Dorian's older sister Agatha \"Addie\" Cramer, who had not died after all. Blair had Addie, mentally ill and institutionalized for years, hidden in her loft, and blamed her Aunt Dorian for her mother's illness. Seeking revenge, Blair tried to ruin Dorian by getting her aunt's signature on a document confessing to the murder of Victor Lord in 1976.\n\nBlair sought to marry Asa Buchanan to gain the financial security and power she needed to care for her mother and destroy Dorian. As it turned out, Dorian had been told Addie had died by their parents, who had institutionalized her. Blair married Asa despite the fact that she was in love with Max Holden; by the time her marriage fell apart and Asa had thrown her out on the street, Max had moved on to the love of his life, Luna Moody. In 1994, Blair became romantically involved with Cord Roberts.\n\nKelly and Paul[]\n\nMain article: Kelly Cramer\n\nIn 1995, Melinda's rebellious daughter Kelly Cramer arrives in Llanview, scarred by her childhood with her unstable mother and raised in various European boarding schools arranged by her aunt Dorian. Kelly comes to live with her cousin Cassie and Cassie's husband Andrew, and develops an infatuation with Dorian's husband David Vickers. Over time, Kelly and her family become close. Later, Kelly falls for both Joey and Kevin Buchanan.\n\nIn 1997, Melinda is finally recovering from her breakdown, and remembering her and Dorian's traumatic past at the Cramer family's ancestral home in Canton, Ohio. Dorian, desperate not to let the dark secrets of their past resurface, begins switching Melinda's antipsychotic medication, and Melinda once again sinks into dementia.\n\nIn 2003, it is revealed that Melinda had told Dorian upon a recent hospital visit that she had given birth to a son as well as a daughter during her years in Europe, and that the boy had been given away. This child turns out to be Paul Cramer. Melinda is seen again in 2004 during the \"baby switch\" storyline, in which Kelly confesses her and Paul's sins to her delusional mother. A disoriented Melinda — lost in her own world — mistakes Kelly's son Ace for her own son Paul. A devious Paul is murdered in October 2004;[8][9] One Life to Live was met with criticism when the killer was later revealed to be married district attorney Daniel Colson, who had murdered Paul to cover up the fact that Daniel is secretly gay.[10][11] On March 1, 2010, the assembled family receives the news that Melinda has died of a heart attack.[12]\n\nCassie Callison[]\n\nCassie Callison File:Cassie-LauraKoffman-2009-02-15.png Laura Koffman as Cassie Callison One Life to Live Portrayed by Cusi Cram (1981–83)[13]\n\nAva Haddad (1983–86, 1990)[13]\n\nHolly Gagnier (1986–88)\n\nLaura Koffman (1991–99, 2001–04, 2010) Duration 1981–88, 1990–99, 2001–04, 2010 First appearance Template:Start date Last appearance Template:End date Cause/reason Returns to Georgia Created by Sam Hall\n\nPeggy O'Shea Introduced by Joseph Stuart Profile Family Cramer Alias(es) Cassie Reynolds\n\nCassie Howard Occupation\n\nJournalist\n\nPrivate investigator\n\nTitle Contributor for The Banner and The Sun Residence Georgia File:Cassie-HollyGagnier-1987.jpg Holly Gagnier as Cassie Callison File:Cassie-AvaHaddad.jpg Ava Haddad as Cassie Callison\n\nRelationships Parents Dorian Cramer Lord\n\nDavid Reynolds Siblings Adriana Cramer\n\nLangston Wilde (adoptive) Spouses Rob Coronal (1985–86)\n\nBo Buchanan (1991)\n\nAndrew Carpenter (1993–97)\n\nKevin Buchanan (1998–99) Romances Jon Russell Children William Sloan Carpenter Grandparents Lou Cramer\n\nSonya Cramer Aunts and uncles Addie Cramer\n\nMelinda Cramer First cousins Blair Cramer\n\nKelly Cramer\n\nPaul Cramer\n\nCassandra \"Cassie\" Callison (née Reynolds; formerly Coronal, Carpenter, and Buchanan) is a fictional character on the American ABC daytime drama One Life to Live. She is the daughter of Dr. Dorian Lord and musician David \"David Renaldi\" Reynolds, and adopted by former stepfather and attorney Herb Callison. The role was portrayed for the longest duration by actress Laura Koffman.\n\nCharacter history[]\n\nEnter Cassie[]\n\nIn 1981, a young girl named Cassie Reynolds appeared and soon revealed herself as Dorian's daughter. Dorian had been in medical school when she had given birth to Cassie, whose father David Renaldi had run off with her.[14] Mother and daughter reunited, and Dorian's husband Herb Callison adopted Cassie. In 1985, Cassie became engaged to Rob Coronal, but by 1986 their marriage had ended in divorce. Dorian left Llanview in 1987 (and became the U.S. Ambassador to Mendorra) after discovering that Cassie was having an affair with Dorian's boyfriend, private detective Jon Russell.[15] Cassie and Jon's relationship later fizzled as she reunited with ex-husband Rob.\n\nCassie lives with a returned Melinda in Dorian's penthouse, but leaves town in 1988. Dorian returns in 1989, followed by Cassie in 1991.\n\nMuch to Dorian's chagrin, Cassie becomes involved with Bo Buchanan; Dorian's machinations (and a failed attempt to kill Cassie by Bo's insane ex, Alex Olanov) do not stop the couple from marrying. Immediately after the wedding, however, Bo's presumed-dead wife Sarah Gordon appears, very much alive. An anguished Bo chooses to stay with Cassie, but their marriage later falls apart after Cassie realizes Bo is still in love with Sarah.\n\nIn 1993, Cassie marries the Reverend Andrew Carpenter; she later miscarries their son, William. She finds an abandoned baby in the manger outside St. James Church. Beth, the mother of Cassie's foundling, appears but soon dies; her last wish is for Cassie and Andrew to adopt baby River.\n\nDivorce and new beginnings[]\n\nAfter baby William's death, Cassie and Andrew's marriage was never quite the same. Prior to their adopting River, Cassie suffered a mental breakdown, and Andrew nearly fell into an affair with close friend Marty Saybrooke. The Carpenters' marriage seemed to be getting back on even footing as they focused on raising their new son River, but when Cassie went back to work as a journalist at The Banner in 1997, she began a tempestuous working relationship with rival reporter Kevin Buchanan, one that slowly blossomed into mutual passion. Cassie broke her wedding vows and began an affair with Kevin, ruining her marriage and her reputation, even losing custody of River in the ensuing divorce and custody battle. Kevin and Cassie were deeply in love, however, and Kevin risked his life to save Cassie from the inferno that burnt down the Cramer homestead in Canton, Ohio. Meanwhile, Cassie's long-lost father, David Renaldi, returned to Llanview, stricken with ALS, to reconnect with his daughter and new grandson.\n\nInsanity[]\n\nWounded in the fire in Canton, Kevin became enamored of his hospital nurse, Barbara Graham, who developed an obsessive fixation on Kevin after their brief affair went sour. Turning murderous, Barbara attempted to kill Cassie, whom she believed stood in the way of her future with Kevin. Barbara lured Cassie to the docks in the warehouse district of Llanview and attempted to gun her down; instead, she murdered Drew Buchanan and gravely injured Cassie, leaving her paralyzed and using a wheelchair. Eventually, Cassie discovered that Barbara was the shooter, and her rage and fury left her mind once again unhinged. Cassie turned the tables on Barbara, blackmailing her with knowledge of her crime, forcing Barbara to participate in her wedding to Kevin and become Cassie's personal nurse. As Cassie slowly regained the use of her legs, she hid the truth from her friends and family. Finally, Cassie dragged Barbara to a bell tower at gunpoint, attempting to force her to jump to her death. Kevin and Andrew arrived just in time to stop Cassie. Cassie was institutionalized, and Barbara was arrested.\n\nWhen Kevin and the family visited Cassie, they discovered she had suffered a full psychotic break, believing she was still happily married to Andrew. Andrew and Kevin both attempted to break through to her, to little avail. Cassie's mother, Dorian, had never approved of Cassie and Kevin's relationship, and in early 1999 decided to send Cassie to Switzerland for further treatment. Kevin fought her every step of the way, even stowing away on the private plane bound for Switzerland to try one last time to get through to his wife. In a brief moment of lucidity, Cassie begged Kevin to let her go. Heartbroken, Kevin returned to Llanview and agreed to have his marriage annulled.\n\nReturn engagements[]\n\nSince her exit in 1999, Cassie had made a series of recurring appearances. In the years since Cassie's departure to Switzerland, it was revealed that she was slowly recovering, and eventually River was even sent out of the country to spend time with his mother. Cassie herself finally reappeared in late 2001, as a guest at Todd and Blair's wedding. Cassie explained that she was almost fully recovered and living in Switzerland, and shared a somewhat awkward reunion with her cousin Kelly, who had since gone on to marry Kevin herself.\n\nFully recovered, Cassie next returned a year later in late 2002, rushing to Blair's aid after she was apparently attacked by mob hitmen. Cassie believed Blair had been rendered catatonic, and was tasked to take her out of the country. In reality, Todd and Blair had used Cassie to lure away her supposed assailants with the help of a body double, while Blair hid out at Todd's penthouse.\n\nWhile back in town for Blair, Cassie also recounted her harrowing experiences with Mitch Laurence for Viki and Bo. Nothing could have prepared her for the shock of her life when she returned the following March to see Dorian, only to discover that her mother was marrying the resurrected Mitch - the man who had tried to rape Cassie! Cassie and Blair watched in shock and disgust as Dorian and Mitch took their unholy vows, and gained control of the Lord fortune. Cassie did not yet realize that Dorian was conning Mitch in the hopes of winning his trust and destroying him. Dorian haltingly tried to explain things to her daughter, but Cassie left town in disgust for her new home in Savannah. Later that year, on Mother's Day, Cassie and Dorian made peace after Cassie discovered Dorian and Blair's efforts to murder Mitch. Meanwhile, a now-teenaged River came home from Savannah to spend time with his father and grandmother. During this visit, Cassie also painfully reunited with Kevin and Kelly.\n\nIn the fall of 2003, Cassie was part of the Cramers' competition to win \"Aunt Betsy's\" inheritance, but was immediately disqualified due to her own \"lapses in judgment\" with Andrew and Kevin. In 2004, Cassie returned, furious about River's relationship with Adriana Colon, his newfound \"aunt\". She and Adriana eventually made peace, and Cassie returned to Savannah, where she resides to this day. Dorian calls Cassie to warn her about a returned Mitch on February 15, 2010. She then returns to Llanview with her ex-husband, Andrew, in tow and reveals that Melinda has died. Following a short reunion with her mother, sisters and, cousins Cassie returns to Savannah. When Bo and Nora re-marry, it is revealed that Andrew traveled back with her, to visit River.

Mentally ill and institutionalized for years, Addie is now hidden in Blair's loft. Blair blames Dorian for her mother's illness and her own childhood in foster care; Blair is apparently the result of Addie's rape at the hands of an unknown man in the sanitarium. Seeking revenge, Blair tries to ruin Dorian by getting her aunt's signature on a document confessing to the murder of her husband Victor Lord in 1976. Blair then plots to marry Asa Buchanan to gain the financial security and power she needs to care for her mother and destroy Dorian. It is revealed that Dorian had been told that Addie had died by their parents, who had institutionalized her. Blair and Dorian reconcile, and Dorian is tearfully reunited with sister Addie, who calls her \"Dori.\" Sweet but simple-minded Addie is placed in St. Ann's sanitarium for full-time care, but is visited often by her family.[16]\n\nAddie surprises the Cramers on December 24, 2007 when she appears at Dorian's home La Boulaie. Apparently \"recovered\" due to a new medication, Addie is anxious to make up for lost time. [16][17] She sets things straight with on-again, off-again son-in-law Todd Manning and flirts with Dorian's new friend Charlie Banks. While at Roxy Balsom's beauty salon, Addie seems to recognize Miles Laurence, whom she's never met; they commiserate on the fact that they have both spent most of their lives in hospitals. On February 5, 2008, Addie is relieved by her assessment that Dorian is no longer a \"Viki wanna-be,\" reminding Dorian of her persistent use of the Lord name, \"running a newspaper like hers, naming your house,\" and shared romantic partners — as well as Dorian's romance with Viki's son Joey. \"And I thought you weren't paying attention,\" notes a flabbergasted Dorian.\n\nOn June 18, 2008, the extroverted Addie reveals that she has married Dorian's ex-husband David Vickers, but her torrid \"friends with benefits\" relationship with David comes to a swift end when she realizes he still carries a torch for Dorian; they part amicably.[16]\n\nWith Dorian's departure in August 2011, Addie becomes the matriarch of the Cramer family in Llanview.
