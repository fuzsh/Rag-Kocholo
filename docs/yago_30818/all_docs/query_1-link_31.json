        "text": "Richard Michael “Mike” Cramer, 72 of Champaign, went to meet Jesus in Heaven on July 27, 2024, at Carle Foundation Hospital, Urbana.\n\nMike was born in Carroll, Iowa on January 2, 1952. He was the son of Richard Lee and Norma Jean (Nichols) Cramer, both deceased.\n\nSurviving to mourn Mike’s passing is his long-time partner of 27 years, Sherry Myers of Champaign. He was previously married from 1975-1996 to Donna Tinsman of Champaign. To this union, they had four children, Jeff (Kelly) Cramer of Naples, Florida; Tracy (Ben) Carlson of Champaign; Brad (Jennifer) Cramer of Milwaukee, Wisconsin; and Ashley (Hayes) Printy of Ketchikan, Alaska. Mike was dearly loved by his twelve grandchildren: Paige, Kate, Gavin, and Megan Cramer, Spencer and Quinn Carlson, Violet and Joy Cramer, Ellie, Harris, and Nora Printy, and step-grandson, Baylin Cascone. His sister, Patti (Dick) Masters of St. Charles, Illinois, and nephews, Carl, Joel, and David Masters also survive; along with a great-nephew, two great-nieces, numerous cousins, and many friends.\n\nMike graduated from Urbana High School in 1970. He was in the home improvement business his entire life; working early on with his father in the family business, Cramer Siding, and in later years with his son, Jeff, and Cramer Homes. He attended First Baptist Church of Champaign at Savoy.\n\nVisitation will be on Thursday, August 8, 2024, from 11:00 a.m. to 1:00 p.m., with the funeral service following at 1:00 p.m. at Renner-Wikoff Chapel & Crematory, 1900 Philo Rd., Urbana. Reverend Joe Sanders will officiate. Interment will be immediately following the service at Eastlawn Cemetery, Urbana.\n\nMemorial contributions may be made to the First Baptist Church of Champaign at Savoy, or Carle Health Center for Philanthropy/Carle Cancer Center, https://carle.org/giving/make-a-gift or by check, Carle Health Center for Philanthropy, 611 W Park St. Urbana, IL 61801\n\nSherry, along with Mike’s children, would like to express their sincere appreciation to the many special physicians and medical staff at Carle Health who provided wonderful care to Mike during his long-term illness. Everyone that met Mike loved his endearing personality and sense of humor. He was deeply loved and will be missed by many.\n\nCondolences may be made at www.renner-wikoffchapel.com"
