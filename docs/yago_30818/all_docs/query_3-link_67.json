        "text": "Debra A. Cramer, 65, of Camanche, passed away Saturday, October 31, 2020 at her home surrounded by her loving family, after fighting an 8 year battle with breast cancer.\n\nPrivate Memorial Services will be held at the Camanche Chapel Snell-Zornig Funeral Homes & Crematory. Online condolences may be expressed by visiting her obituary at www.snellzornig.com. A celebration of life will be announced at a later date.\n\nDebra Ann Greve was born on October 2, 1955 in DeWitt, Iowa, the daughter of Courtland and Dolores (Null) Greve. She was a 1974 graduate of Camanche High School. She married Larry Cramer on June 6, 1975 in Clinton, and celebrated 45 years of marriage this year.\n\nDeb had previously been employed by Nielsens Clearing House, PFC, Amicare, and retired in 2016 after working over 25 years for MercyOne, working in the home health care/hospice and the physical therapy/rehab departments.\n\nDeb's greatest passion was her love of her family. She loved her shopping trips with her close friends and her \"Sissy\" Vicky, but her favorite trips were with her granddaughters for holidays and their birthdays and spending the day with them. The retail stores will surely see a dip in sales during the holiday season. She was an avid reader and had been a member of a local book club. Another one of her passions was her love of plants and flowers, spending many hours in her gardens. In addition, she enjoyed exercising with her Planet Fitness family the past few years. She enjoyed boating and spending time on the beach, and loved winter vacationing in Destin, FL after retirement. She will always be remembered for her kind soul, loving spirit, great laugh and bright smile - \"or that\".\n\nDeb is survived by her husband: Larry of Camanche; her three sons: Josh (Kelly) Cramer of Fulton, Matt (fianc√© Mackenna Baker) Cramer of Cedar Rapids, and Bart Cramer of Clinton; three grandchildren: Brianna, Paige, and Bohden; her mother: Dolores \"Sis\" Greve of Clinton; brother: Dennis Greve of Clinton; sister-in-law: Vicky (Dave) Kruse of Camanche; three brothers-in-law: Bill Cramer, Dave (Loren) Cramer, and Dale (Cindy) Cramer. She was preceded in death by her father: Courtland; maternal grandparents Marvin & Grace Null and paternal grandparents: Virtus and Clydia Greve.\n\nMemorials may be made to the Bickelhaupt Arboretum, Mercy Hospice, or the memorial of your choice. Special thanks to Dr. Anoop Agarwaal and the entire oncology staff at MercyOne for taking such great care of her all these years. In memory of Deb, please plant a flower for her in the spring so that her legacy will continue to bloom. Fly high with the angels and soar with the butterflies Deb. We love you."
