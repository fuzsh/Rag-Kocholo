        "text": "ISS Administrative Search was proud to lead the Head of School search for The International School of Aruba (ISA), an ISS school in Oranjestad, Aruba. Congratulations to Dr. Kelly Kramer for accepting the position, beginning July 2023! Kelly is currently the Director of School at the International School of Dongguan (ISD).\n\nKelly holds an EdD in Educational Leadership from Edgewood College, Wisconsin, and a MS in Educational Leadership and Policy Analysis from UW-Madison, Wisconsin. She also holds a MS in Interdisciplinary Studies from SUNY-Buffalo, New York, and a BS in Education, Elementary and Spanish, from UW-Whitewater, Wisconsin.\n\nHer previous experiences in education have taken her to the US, Ecuador, Pakistan, China, Thailand, and Venezuela. She has served at Academia Cotopaxi, Phoenix Schools District #1, Lahore American School, International School of Bangkok, Oconomowoc School District, Hangzhou International School, Madison Country Day (WI), and Colegio Internacional de Caracas.\n\nIn this feature, learn about Kelly’s earliest aspirations of being a teacher, what school leadership means to her, and why she looks forward to making ISA her next home.\n\nWhat drew you to pursue the world of education? And what drew you into international education specifically?\n\nI knew I would be a teacher even as a young child. My friends were my students and I was the teacher. I loved staying after school and helping my teacher making copies and cleaning the boards, paint brushes, anything!\n\nAs a high school student, I was a American Field Services student. I spent my junior year living and going to school in Cuenca, Ecuador. From that time on, I wanted to live and work overseas.\n\nCongratulations on your new position at ISA! What excites you about being in this new role and school? What are your hopes?\n\nI am so excited to return to the area, having visited Aruba many times in the past from when I lived in Venezuela. I love the diversity of cultures. I hope to be able to continue the work of Mr. Dennis Willeford (current ISA Head of School) and find further ways to strengthen an already outstanding team.\n\nPlease tell us about your education philosophy and your leadership style. What can your new community expect?\n\nAll students can learn and grow; it is incumbent on schools and our professionals to provide the just right learning experiences for our students. I see myself as a coach, a collaborator. Just as I seek to find strengths and areas of growth in students, I do the same for the school. I look forward to working with the entire ISA learning community to provide the very best to our students and community at large.\n\nWhat is an interesting fact or story about you that you would like to share?\n\nMy husband and I raised our children overseas from the time they were infants. We recognize the importance of helping the students connect with their heritage and yet support them in becoming global citizens and leaders. Both of my children are teachers, and one of them is currently teaching in internationals school now. Our family considers home anywhere we are in the world! And we can’t wait to make Aruba our home!"
