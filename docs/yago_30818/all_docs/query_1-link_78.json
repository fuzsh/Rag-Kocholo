        "text": "James “Jim” Lee Cramer, 59\n\nJames “Jim” Lee Cramer, a devoted husband, father, and retired Army veteran, passed away at his home at the young age of 59 on July 3, 2024. Born in Los Angeles, CA, he was the son of the late James Leroy and E. Rebecca (Stowe) Cramer.\n\nJim proudly served in the United States Army for 22 years before his medical retirement, during which he held various occupational specialties and rose to the rank of E-6. A Paratrooper and a veteran of Operation Iraqi Freedom, James’s commitment to his country and comrades defined his military career.\n\nJim pursued his academic aspirations, obtaining a Master’s in Geography and a Master’s in Emergency Management from Millersville University. He found joy in the simple pleasures of life, particularly hunting, fishing, and spending quality time with his family. As a devoted family man, Jim found immense joy and fulfillment in supporting and guiding his daughters.\n\nLeft to cherish his memory are his loving wife of 31 years, Marybeth Cramer (nee Novak) and their three daughters: Becky Cramer of Fayetteville, NC, Maggie Cramer of Hanover, PA and Sarah Cramer of Washington, DC; his sister Apryl Cramer of Port Angeles, WA; his nephew Alex Cramer (husband of Lauren) of Fayetteville, NC; his nieces: Kylie Cramer of Port Angeles, WA and Stephanie DeSpain of Kelso, OR, and two great nieces: Madeline and Isabelle Cramer of Fayetteville, NC.\n\nFamily will receive friends on July 19, 2024 at St. John Neumann Catholic Church, 601 E Delp Rd, Lancaster, PA 17601 from 10am to 11am with a Mass of Christian Burial to follow at 11:00 am. Jim will be laid to rest at Indiantown Gap National Cemetery at 1:30pm.\n\nIn lieu of flowers, donations to honor Jim can be made to the Wounded Warrior Project, https://www.woundedwarriorproject.org/ or the American Heart Association, https://www.heart.org/en/get-involved/ways-to-give-aha.\n\nLeave a condolence on this Memorial Page\n\nMet Squeaky in 1977.\n\nHe was always a smarty with a great sense of humor and a big heart.\n\nHe loved life and to be of help to others. He shared a love of service to help others in any way he could.\n\nMay he rest easy and may his family and friends find comfort in the memories he helped all to experience with his presence.\n\nLove and Prayers for his family.\n\nMay you all find love and light in your shared times with him.\n\nHe was a gift to all who know him.\n\nHugs,\n\nTeresa Moore"
