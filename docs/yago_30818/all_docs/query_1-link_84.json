After keeping their romance relatively low-key, Jana Kramer revealed in January 2023 that she is dating former soccer player Allan Russell.\n\n‚ÄúBack where it all started‚Ä¶ Also this is so us‚Ä¶ trying to take a photo üòÇ,‚Äù the One Tree Hill alum captioned the pair‚Äôs Instagram debut on January 28, tagging Russell‚Äôs account.\n\nIn the snap, Kramer laughed as she cuddled her beau on a brown leather couch. The former North Carolina FC athlete, for his part, was all smiles and wore a white turtleneck with a black coat. The ‚ÄúStory‚Äù songstress also wore a jacket, but in a camel color. While Kramer tagged her Instagram location in downtown Nashville, it is unclear when and where the photo was taken.\n\nAfter the pair‚Äôs social media debut, Kramer‚Äôs celebrity friends flooded the comment section to toast the relationship milestone.\n\n‚ÄúThere he is üòçüòç,‚Äù Kelly Rizzo, who was married to Bob Saget before his January 2022 death, replied on Friday.\n\nKramer‚Äôs personal trainer, Erin Oprea, added: ‚ÄúSoooo happy for you.‚Äù\n\n[sendtonews type=\"float\" key=\"N6GLsdQlFC-2828745-14453\"]\n\nThe Soccer Mom Madam star announced earlier this month that she had a new boyfriend, revealing during her ‚ÄúWhine Down‚Äù podcast that he was a ‚Äúsweetheart‚Äù who lives in England.\n\n‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know if this is my forever person. ‚Ä¶ But, like, I‚Äôm not going to push away love just because I‚Äôve been hurt before. I‚Äôm going to embrace it,‚Äù Kramer ‚Äî who shares daughter Jolie and son Jace with ex-husband Mike Caussin ‚Äî said during the January 9 episode of her podcast, hinting that they met through an online dating app. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm going to have fun. And if it doesn‚Äôt work out, well, you know what, I‚Äôm gonna learn a lot of lessons. And I had a lot of fun along the way.‚Äù\n\nShe added at the time: ‚ÄúWhen I was on that app, I was like, ‚ÄòNo, they live in a different country, no, no, no.‚Äô And, you know, even with him, I said, ‚ÄòNo ‚Ä¶ this is silly. I‚Äôm a mom with two kids and I live in Nashville, like, how would this even work?‚Äô And something about him, you know, I was like, ‚ÄòOK, well, let me just see, what does the conversation hurt, right?‚Äô This just feels different.‚Äù\n\nKramer ‚Äî who was briefly linked to Jay Cutler and Ian Schinelli in 2022 following her divorce from Caussin ‚Äî is remaining optimistic as she and Russell navigate long distances.\n\n‚ÄúI‚Äôm just enjoying where it‚Äôs at right now and I‚Äôm enjoying feeling this way,‚Äù she gushed during her podcast. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre trying not to go more than three weeks without seeing each other. ‚Ä¶ It just feels really nice, and I don‚Äôt want to put too much pressure on it and I just want to enjoy it.‚Äù\n\nKramer confirmed in May 2023 that the pair are engaged after six months of dating.\n\nScroll below to meet Kramer‚Äôs man:"
