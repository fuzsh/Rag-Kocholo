Zach’s normally stoic demeanor masks someone capable of feeling and loving more than most.\n\nCame to town: 2004\n\nMarital Status: Married to Kendall Hart\n\nOccupation: Owner and operator of numerous casinos\n\n?\n\nWife: Kendall Hart\n\nChildren: Ethan Ramsey (deceased; with Hannah Nichols)\n\nStepchildren: Spike Lavery\n\nFather: Alexander Cambias (deceased)\n\nSiblings: Michael Cambias (deceased)\n\nNiece: Miranda Montgomery\n\nMothers-in-law: Erica Kane, Alice Hart\n\nFather-in-law: Jackson Montgomery\n\nBrothers-in-law: Reggie Montgomery, Josh Madden, Trey Kenyon\n\nSisters-in-law: Bianca Montgomery, Lily Montgomery, Greenlee du Pres\n\nSignificant Romantic Relationships: Maria Santos Grey, Kendall Hart (1st and 2nd wife)\n\nZach Slater was born Alexander Cambias Junior. Growing up, Zach felt the tyrannical rule of his father, Alexander Senior. Alexander expected his eldest son to run the family empire as Alexander saw fit, a life Zach did not want to lead. With the help of his younger brother Michael, Zach faked his death and adopted the new identity of Zach Slater (the name of a boarding school friend).\n\nZach worked odd jobs and eventually built his own empire of Casinos. Zach met Maria Santos Grey and the two fell in love. Maria was suffering from amnesia, and going by the name Maureen Gorman. Maureen couldn’t remember her past, and Zach wanted to forget his. Their desire to live for the moment drew the two together and fed their love. Their affair was cut short when David Hayward, who was trying to hide Maria from being discovered by her family, lied and told her the police were closing in on her (from an imagined murder David told Maria she committed, to keep her on the run). Maria was forced to leave Zach. Zach assumed he would never see her again.\n\nYears later, Zach learned that Michael had been murdered following an extended stay in Pine Valley. Soon Erica Kane, one of Michael’s many enemies and a suspect in his murder, arrived at his casino for an extended stay. Zach kept close tabs on Erica as he researched her family and all those in Pine Valley that had reason to hate Michael. During the course of his research, he found that his beloved Maureen was living in Pine Valley, having regained her memory. Zach traveled to Pine Valley, where he made plans to open a casino outside of town.\n\nZach made his presence known to Maria, who was affected at the sight of him. The feelings between the two were strong, and Zach wanted to resume their relationship, but Maria explained she was married. She did not tell her husband Edmund, now paralyzed in a wheelchair, that she had a relationship with Zach during the time she was away from Pine Valley. Edmund eventually discovered Maria and Zach’s past, building enmity between Zach and Edmund.\n\nZach met Bianca Montgomery and grew to like and respect her. Bianca had killed Michael, which Zach had trouble comprehending given her kind and compassionate nature. Zach was unable to accept that Michael had become a monster, assaulting women and ruining lives. The Michael that Zach remembered was a sweet, trustworthy young man. Zach was convinced that someone close to Bianca—Erica, or Bianca’s sister Kendall Hart—had killed Michael. He had lots of enemies in the town and Zach was not impressed by the moral composition of the residents. At the grand opening of his casino, Zach designed a murder mystery game whose elements were similar to the Michael Cambias murder case. Watching via security cameras, Zach hoped to weed out the real killer by observing them play a game similar in design to Michael’s real death. Maria discovered him and confronted him on his action, and Zach revealed to her that he was Michael’s brother.\n\nMaria tried to convince Zach that Bianca did kill Michael, and that Michael was a horrible man. Maria promised Zach that she would help him accept the truth about Michael and come to terms with it. Edmund did not want Maria around Zach, so Maria had to keep her meetings with Zach a secret. Finally Zach was able to accept the monster Michael had become, and broke down in Maria’s arms. Erica saw the two together and reported everything to Edmund. Furious that his wife continued to see Zach when she promised she wouldn’t, Edmund initiated divorce proceedings. Despite his strong feelings towards her, Zach respected Maria’s determination to make her marriage work.\n\nZach was shocked when Ethan Ramsey arrived in town claiming to be Alexander Cambias Junior’s son. Ethan’s story, of Alexander Junior impregnating maid Hannah Nichols, only to die soon after, rang true with Zach. He remembered sleeping with Hannah before faking his death. Zach had Ethan’s DNA tested in secret and learned that they were father and son. Shortly after, Zach announced to the whole town that he was really Alexander Cambias Junior, and apologized to Bianca for Michael’s actions. Zach told Ethan that they were not father and son… Zach later confessed to Maria that Ethan was his son, but he would deny Ethan the Cambias name at all costs, for he did not want the Cambias money to corrupt Ethan as it did Michael and their father.\n\nEthan was arrested for shooting Ryan Lavery, and Zach worked behind the scenes to clear him. While Ethan was incarcerated, Zach took shots at Ryan and his wife Greenlee. Zach was confident that doing so while Ethan was still in prison would weaken the case against Ethan. Ethan was granted bail. Ryan accused Zach of taking the shots at him, and wondered if Zach was responsible for both shootings.\n\nZach remained determined to keep Ethan from obtaining the Cambias name, and wanted him to leave town as soon as he was cleared of the charges against him. To that end, Zach tried to convince Kendall (now dating Ethan) to break up with him, so Ethan would leave town once he was cleared of the charges against him. Kendall refused, and the ordeal only brought Ethan and Kendall closer, while building the animosity between Ethan and Zach.\n\nDetermined to get Kendall out of Ethan’s life (and in doing so, get Ethan out of town), Zach presented compelling evidence to Ryan that would suggest Kendall was responsible for poisoning Greenlee. Zach was also elated when Miranda, Bianca and Michael’s presumed dead daughter, was revealed to be alive. Ethan had his DNA tested against Miranda and learned he was Zach’s son. Ethan confronted Zach over denying him and declared war.\n\nMaria resisted her feelings for Zach and told him that she was reconciling with Edmund. Zach respected her wish, but soon discovered security footage that showed the wheelchair bound Edmund could walk, and had been lying to Maria about his paralysis. Zach prepared to tell Maria, but was waylaid by Ethan in the Wildwind barn. The two fought and Ethan knocked Zach out. When he awoke, the barn was on fire and Edmund was unconscious on the ground. Zach nearly died in the fire, but Ethan saved him. Edmund died from his injuries and Ethan lied and told the police he witnessed Zach kill Edmund. Zach told Maria that Edmund was lying to her and could walk, but she refused to believe Zach and accused him of murdering Edmund out of jealousy. Zach was arrested. Zach, feeling betrayed by his son and the women he loved, confessed to the murder as a way to hurt them. Lily Montgomery, who had actually witnessed the crime, came forward and declared Zach was innocent. Zach was cleared of the crime. Maria apologized to Zach for not believing him, but he was hurt by her lack of faith in his innocence. Slowly the tension between them melted, as Maria admitted to Zach that she never stopped loving him, but that her focus had to be on repairing her damaged relationship with her children. The two former lovers parted with a final kiss goodbye.\n\nZach sued Ethan for control of Cambias Industries, which Ethan had assumed control of. As revenge, Ethan had Zach’s casino shut down. Kendall had broken up with Ethan, disgusted over his lies about Zach’s guilt. Zach proposed to Kendall that they marry as the ultimate form of payback to Ethan. Additionally, Kendall would regain Zach’s gaming licenses for him, help him run the casino, and would keep Bianca and Miranda’s interest in Cambias Industries after Zach had regained control. Kendall agreed and the two were married in secret. Shortly after, Ethan made a loving plea to Kendall to reunite, but Zach dropped the bombshell that he had married Kendall. A furious Ethan fought Zach, and declared his father dead to him.\n\nShocked by the depth of his son’s pain, Zach called off his lawsuit to regain Cambias. He offered to let Kendall out of their marriage, but Kendall chose to remain married to Zach, desperate for a loveless marriage as a means to keep her away from the inevitable pain that love brings. The two began to form an unlikely friendship.\n\nZach was supportive of Kendall while she worried for Greenlee, who was pregnant with Ryan’s child. Kendall, who had witnessed a rage prone Ryan declare that he never wanted children, feared Ryan’s negative reaction to the pregnancy. When Greenlee told Ryan that they were expecting a child, he went bezerk, destroying their hotel room and eventually driving his motorcycle off a cliff. Everyone presumed Ryan was dead, but Zach discovered that he was alive. Ryan demanded that Zach not reveal to Greenlee or anyone else that he lived. He wanted to remain dead and leave Greenlee, feeling that if he stayed he would inevitably hurt his wife and unborn child. Zach, agreeing that Ryan was dangerous and recognizing the need to start over from his own past, agreed to keep Ryan’s secret and help him get out of town.\n\nZach learned that Kendall was planning on acting as the surrogate for Greenlee and Ryan’s baby. He was incensed at this, not wanting Kendall to be remotely connected to Ryan (whom Zach considered dangerous) in any way. When Ryan revealed himself as alive a few weeks later, Kendall realized her husband had helped Ryan fake his death. Kendall was furious with Zach, claiming that she would never have acted as the surrogate if she knew Ryan was alive.\n\nDespite their frequent animosity, Zach developed real and true feelings for his wife. When Greenlee revealed to the entire town that Kendall was not carrying Greenlee and Ryan’s baby, but Kendall and Ryan’s child, Kendall was ostracized and devastated. Kendall explained that her reasoning was selfless, as Greenlee’s eggs had been destroyed at implantation time, and if Kendall didn’t volunteer to use her own eggs there would be no child of Ryan’s at all. Zach supported Kendall and declared his love for her. Kendall, fearful of rejection, pulled away from Zach despite her very own feelings of love. Zach agreed to her wishes and went through with a divorce. Bianca urged Zach to fight for Kendall and insist on his love for her, until her defenses wore down. Zach did so, and once again told Kendall he loved her. This time, Kendall reciprocated and the two fell into each other’s arms.\n\nTheir bliss was shattered when Kendall learned Zach had caused the blackout which placed her in the situation that forced Kendall to carry her own child with Ryan (rather than Greenlee’s). Zach explained to Kendall the blackout was to sabotage her chances of surrogacy, because he wanted to protect her from what Zach felt was a dangerous Ryan. Kendall, who doubted her own maternal feelings, dumped Zach.\n\nZach befriended Dixie Martin, who had secretly returned to town while her family presumed her dead. Zach hid Dixie, and learned Greg Madden had stolen her baby. Greg was Kendall’s OBGYN, so Zach feared of his nefarious plots for Kendall and tried to warn her, his love evident. Kendall resisted Zach’s attempts to help her, but finally confessed to Zach she still loved him and wanted to be a mother to her baby. The two lovingly reunited and were married at sea. Shortly after, Kendall was plunged into a coma after construction materials fell on her. The doctors told Kendall’s family that if they used the needed medication to help Kendall, it would surely result in the death of the baby; letting the baby develop to term could ultimately kill Kendall. Torn, but knowing Kendall’s declaration that she wanted her baby to grow up and have a full life above all else, Zach used his power as Kendall’s husband to demand the baby fully develop, despite the risk to Kendall. Ryan, the baby’s father, protested and took Zach to court to prevent this. Ryan won the case, so Zach barricaded himself in Kendall’s room until the baby could be safely delivered. Spike Lavery was born, and Kendall soon recovered.\n\nGreg was found dead weeks later, having been buried alive the entire time. Zach and Dixie became suspects. In order to give them an alibi, they had to lie they were having an affair with each other at the time of Greg’s death. Kendall knew it was a lie, but didn’t appreciate Dixie’s designs on her husband. Evidence arose which made Zach look guilty, yet he refused to explain it to Kendall. He felt she should trust him blindly. The couple began to grow apart. Zach and Dixie were cleared of the crime, but Kendall demanded answers from Zach. He admitted that he knew Greg was buried alive, but refused to help him. Kendall was shocked Zach could let a man be tortured and contemplated leaving him, but her deep love won out. The two reunited.\n\nA ZACK QUICKIE\n\nEscaped the tyrannical hand of his father Alexander Cambias by faking his own death\n\nBuilt an empire of casinos by himself\n\nFell in love with Kendall Hart despite their “name only” marriage\n\nHelped Julia Keefer capture the criminal that forced her into the Witness Protection Program\n\nRespected comatose wife Kendall’s wishes and risked her own safety in order to protect the health of her unborn child. Baby Spike was later born and Kendall recovered\n\nLied that Ethan Ramsey was not his son, despite knowing otherwise. Zach wanted to protect him from succumbing to the greed of Zach’s family empire\n\nShot at Ryan Lavery to help clear Ethan of an attempted murder charge\n\nMarried Kendall Hart as a means of hurting his Ethan, her ex-boyfriend\n\nThe death of Ethan\n\nEngineered a blackout so Kendall would not be able to act as a surrogate for Greenlee and Ryan Lavery. This action actually resulted in Kendall using her own egg as a surrogate for the couple, destroying Ryan, Greenlee and Kendall’s lives.\n\n? *) ~)\n\nStill living down the moniker of “Tad the Cad,” Pine Valley’s former playboy has matured into one of its most dependable citizens. Guided by a strong sense of morality and family, Tad’s dry humor is his trademark.\n\nCame to town: 1973\n\nMarital Status: Single\n\nOccupation: Private Investigator\n\nChildren: Jamie Martin (with Brooke English); JR Chandler (longtime stepson, raised him as a son), Kate Martin (with Dixie Martin)\n\nGrandchildren: Adam Chandler III (no biological relation, but JR’s child)\n\nMothers: Ruth Martin (adoptive), Opal Cortlandt (biological)\n\nFathers: Joe Martin (adoptive), Ray Gardner (biological; deceased)\n\nGrandmother: Kate Martin (adoptive; deceased)\n\nSiblings: Jenny Nelson (biological; deceased), Adrian Sword (half-brother), Peter Cortlandt (half-brother), Jeff Martin (adoptive), Tara Martin (adoptive), Jake Martin (adoptive)\n\nNephews: Charlie Brent (adoptive), Josh Madden (adoptive)\n\nNieces: Kelsey Jefferson (adoptive)\n\nUncle: Paul Martin (adoptive)\n\nAunt: Amy Tyler (adoptive)\n\nCousin: Beth Tyler (adoptive; deceased), Phil Brent (adoptive; deceased)\n\nSister-in-law: Carolyn Martin\n\nSignificant Romantic Relationships: Liza Colby, Dottie Thornton (1st wife/divorced), Hillary Wilson (2nd wife/divorced), Dixie Cooney (3rd, 5th and 6th wife/deceased), Brooke English (4th wife/divorced), Gloria Marsh, Simone Torres, Krystal Carey, Di Henry\n\nTad arrived in Pine Valley in 1973, a young boy who was rushed to the hospital after being thrown from a moving car by his father, Ray Gardner. Jeff Martin and his girlfriend Mary Kennicott grew to care for Tad but were unable to adopt him until his biological parents were found. After Mary’s tragic death, a despondent Jeff left Pine Valley, entrusting Tad into the care of his father, Joe Martin, and his wife Ruth.\n\nJoe and Ruth had the opportunity to formally adopt Tad when Ray Gardner was found. Joe met with Ray, who said he wanted $10,000 in exchange for signing over Tad. Joe refused, and Ray came to Pine Valley seeking vengeance. His reign of terror reached its zenith when he raped Ruth. Ray was sent to prison, allowing Joe and Ruth to formally adopt Tad.\n\nAs Tad entered his teenage years he began to smoke marijuana and started stealing things. Eventually Tad ran away from home. Soon after he left, his biological mother, Opal Gardner and younger sister Jenny came to town.\n\nTad came home months later, but much wiser and craftier. He began pursuing high school student Liza Colby. Once the two started dating, Tad began an affair with her mother Marian! Liza was devastated when she discovered their affair, and broke up with Tad. Soon after, Tad’s younger sister Jenny was killed in a jet-ski explosion.\n\nTad was paid by Edna Thornton to date her daughter Dottie. However, Tad fell in love with Phoebe Wallingford’s stepdaughter, Hillary. Desperate to hang onto Tad, Dottie stopped taking her birth control pills and became pregnant. Tad married Dottie, who later miscarried but kept the truth from him. Meanwhile, Hillary accepted the proposal of Tad’s friend Bob Georgia, who was battling a terminal illness. Hillary had agreed to marry Bob, for she wanted the last year of his life to be a happy one. When Bob found out he was going to live, he and Hillary divorced. Tad found out the truth about Dottie’s miscarriage and divorced her. Hillary and Tad married soon after.\n\nAdam Chandler’s daughter Skye arrived in town and set her sights on Tad, quickly seducing him. This, combined with Tad’s knowledge of Wade Matthews’s scam against Phoebe, prompted Hillary to divorce Tad. He left town soon after.\n\nTad returned to Pine Valley and had a brief affair with Barbara Montgomery. He befriended young Dixie Cooney Chandler, who had married Adam and given birth to his son, JR. Adam had been gaslighting Dixie, and had her committed to a sanitarium in an effort to get sole custody of JR. Tad helped Dixie escape and the two managed to prove her sanity and get custody of her son. Deeply in love, they married.\n\nDixie’s uncle Palmer Cortlandt did not approve of the marriage and did everything he could to break them up. Tad’s mistrust of Palmer, coupled with Dixie’s jealousy over Tad’s close friendship with Brooke English caused strains. When Palmer paid a woman to claim she slept with Tad, Dixie left him. Depressed, Tad had a one night stand with Brooke. A hurt Dixie divorced Tad.\n\nTad and Dixie reunited and planned to marry again when Billy Clyde Tuggle (who had been obsessed with Dixie for months) kidnapped her. Tad rescued Dixie, but ended up falling off a bridge in a final struggle with Billy Clyde. Dixie was heartbroken, as was Brooke, who learned she was pregnant with Tad’s baby.\n\nTad had survived, but lost his memory. He ended up in California, where vinter Nola Orsini believed him to be her long lost son, Ted. Tad started working for Orsini Vineyards. Business took Tad to Pine Valley, where his memory returned and he was reunited with Dixie. However, learning Brooke had given birth to his son, Jamie, prompted Tad to marry Brooke. Ted Orsini, Tad’s lookalike, arrived in Pine Valley and began an affair with Dixie.\n\nDixie and Tad couldn’t resist each other and began an affair. Ted, suspecting the affair and obsessed with Dixie, attempted to kill Tad, but failed. Ted escaped capture and is still on the run. However, Brooke soon found she was pregnant by Tad. Brooke lost the baby and realized her marriage was over. She divorced Tad, who remarried Dixie.\n\nTad, now working at the local TV station, was in line to become the station manager. Much to his surprise, he was passed over for the top job by his newly returned ex-girlfriend, Liza Colby. Tad and Liza began working closely, and their old sexual chemistry returned. Tad informed Liza that he was happily married to Dixie, but he gave into his attraction and kissed Liza.\n\nAlong with Liza, Tad began producing sleazy, tabloid TV. In disgust, Dixie left Tad for compromising his morals. Tad found comfort with Liza, and they made love. Later, Tad and Dixie reconciled, but their marriage collapsed when Marian broke the news to Dixie about Tad’s affair. Stunned, Dixie fled Pine Valley. She divorced Tad soon after.\n\nHeartbroken that Dixie left, Tad distanced himself from Liza and grew closer to Adam’s former wife, Gloria Marsh. Tad and Gloria fell in love. She accepted his proposal of marriage, though Tad was troubled by the bond that Gloria shared with her former boss Dimitri Marick. Wrongly believing that Tad was the father of Liza’s baby, Gloria broke her engagement to Tad and married Dimitri.\n\nTad worked with Edmund Grey to convince Gloria that Dimitri was deceiving her. Dimitri was claiming that Edmund’s infant daughter, Maddie, was actually his. Tad and Edmund managed to prove Maddie’s paternity and get the baby, but Dimitri continued to manipulate Gloria into believing him the victim. Determined to save her, Tad was able to show Gloria that Dimitri was not the man she thought (he and Edmund hatched a plot that proved Dimitri’s willingness to shoot his own brother). Hurt and confused, Gloria decided to leave Pine Valley and broke up with Tad.\n\nA young woman, Camille Hawkins, began “haunting” Adam. Camille admitted to Tad that she was trying to drive Adam to confess to murdering her mother years ago. When Adam and Camille finally came face to face, Adam claimed that Camille’s father, Lee Hawkins, had been an abusive monster and that he and Stuart Chandler had faked her mother’s death in order to save her from Lee. Camille refused to believe him, but Adam was telling the truth. Tad supported Camille in her quest for the truth and the two grew close. Lee came to town and began a reign of terror, which prompted a worried Adam to bring Dixie and JR to Pine Valley for safekeeping. Lee’s dangerous revenge plot eventually got he and Camille killed. Tad was upset, but comforted by Dixie’s return.\n\nTad and Dixie grew close again. Dixie was finally able to confront Tad about his adultery. As they worked through their past mistakes, they made a pact that if they decided to have a relationship, they would meet on a rooftop in New York City like in the movie “An Affair To Remember.” Tad and Dixie also agreed not to hold any grudges if the other didn’t show up. On a night where they had set a date, Tad waited on the rooftop, certain that Dixie would join him, and was heartbroken when she didn’t. Crushed, Tad lied when Dixie later called by telling her he never showed up at the roof. What Tad didn’t realize was that Dixie had fallen ill and was in the hospital at the time of their meeting. She learned she could be dying. Dixie never corrected Tad’s assumption that she wasn’t interested in a relationship because she didn’t want to cause him pain if they were to reunite and she died. Tad, meanwhile, never told Dixie his true feelings because he assumed she wasn’t interested and falsely believed she was dating Braden Lavery.\n\nEventually, Tad learned the truth when Liza made Tad watch Dixie’s heartfelt goodbye video for JR. Tad stood by Dixie through the rest of her illness and with the help of Dixie’s cardiologist, Dr. David Hayward, she recovered. Tad and Dixie married for the third time later that year.\n\nDixie learned she was pregnant. She and Tad were elated. Unfortunately, Dixie’s weakened heart caused problems for their unborn child and she miscarried. Dixie was told having children would always be difficult for her due to the strain on her heart. Tad and Dixie mourned not only for their miscarried child, but also for the loss of ever having children again.\n\nDesperate to make something more of her domestic life, Dixie began working at the Andrassy Foundation as David’s assistant, much to Tad’s chagrin. Dixie’s growing independence and her close relationship with David caused a strain on their marriage. Tad became jealous of David, and Dixie continued to hate Tad’s close friendship with Liza, with whom he was working at Chandler Enterprises. A growing divide began to settle in their marriage.\n\nDesperate to win Dixie’s heart from Tad, David drugged an entire party with Libidizone to make it look like Tad was cheating on Dixie with Leslie Coulson. A drugged Tad did indeed sleep with Leslie, and struggled to keep the truth from Dixie. Dixie found out about Tad’s liaison and turned to David. Dixie fought her attraction to David at first, but eventually gave in and slept with him. Tad decided to get to the bottom of what really happened at that party, and played along with Leslie, who was now obsessed with him, to find out the truth. Eventually, Leslie spilled everything to Tad and was sent to a mental institution, allowing Tad to reveal to Dixie that David had been using Leslie to break them up.\n\nAt the same time JR began getting involved with a dangerous crowd and started using drugs to deal with his turbulent family life. Tad and Dixie worked together for the sake of their son and they saw him through his addiction and subsequent recovery.\n\nDixie and Tad began to make inroads in getting back together. However, Tad was determined to make David pay for destroying his life with Dixie and sought out Leslie’s help. Leslie, still obsessed with Tad, nearly killed him. Dixie was furious that Tad brought Leslie back into their lives and divorced him.\n\nThe couple grew closer, but Dixie learned she was pregnant. Knowing Tad would worry about her health in carrying the child to term and thus insist upon termination, Dixie kept the pregnancy from him. Dixie confided in David, who arranged for her to spend the remainder of her pregnancy under care in Europe. Dixie told JR and Tad she was going to visit her sister in Europe for a few months. While there, Dixie accidentally drove off a cliff and was killed, along with her unborn child. When the news reached Pine Valley, Tad was devastated that Dixie was gone forever and that she had been pregnant with his child. In spite of his own grief, Tad remained strong for JR.\n\nTad and Liza shared a kiss that made Liza think twice about reconciling with her husband Adam. A furious Adam fired Tad from Chandler Enterprises. Tad began working as a private investigator. He started a no strings “bed buddy” relationship with Simone Torres, although the latter developed romantic feelings for Tad.\n\nTad was dismayed to learn Jamie spent the night with JR’s new wife Babe. Suspicious of Babe, Tad began investigating her past, leading to clashes with Babe’s mother Krystal Carey. The two often found their arguments would lead to passion. Further complicating things was Liza, who publicly declared her renewed interest in Tad. Tad found himself torn between Simone, Liza and Krystal. Wanting to set a sound example for Jamie, Tad broke off with all three women. Krystal, however, remained a prominent presence in his life and he attempted to resist his feelings for her.\n\nTad discovered that Babe was still legally married to Paul Cramer. At Krystal’s urging, he decided to keep the secret to protect JR while Krystal annulled Babe’s marriage. Tad and Krystal grew closer and embarked on an official relationship.\n\nTad was horrified to learn Bianca Montgomery’s daughter, Miranda, died shortly after birth. However, Tad was grateful that Babe and JR’s daughter, Bess, survived. Unknown to Tad, Bess was really Miranda and Babe bore a son (Ace), who was being raised by Kelly and Kevin Buchanan (of One Life To Live). This was due to an elaborate plot on the part of Paul to help his sister Kelly secure a baby.\n\nShortly after Bianca, Babe and infant Bess were rushed to the hospital, Tad began to wonder if Paul had made a mistake or purposefully told Babe that Bess was her daughter, when she was really Bianca’s. Tad convinced his father to do a DNA test on the baby to prove maternity. Krystal, who shared Tad’s suspicions and wanted to prevent Babe from enduring the loss of a child, switched the DNA test results so they read that Bess was Babe’s daughter. She kept this from Tad. Tad and Krystal fell in love, but her secret created a distance between them.\n\nSlowly, Tad began to realize that JR was exhibiting Adam-like behavior. When it became apparent that JR’s desire to get Babe out of his life would lead to anything—including drugging Babe and indirectly resulting in Jamie getting stabbed-Tad found himself unable to stop JR’s transformation into as deceitful and controlling a man as Adam was.\n\nTad proposed to Krystal, but her guilt over the baby switch secret prevented her from accepting. Tad called Krystal on her emotional distance, but she never gave Tad an answer that he believed was the truth. The tension between the two grew, as Krystal (along with Babe’s newly discovered father, David) worked to keep the baby secret. Tad grew more suspicious that Krystal was keeping a secret, and David knew what it was.Tad received a shock when Jamie announced he was in love with Babe. Soon, the two had left town without Babe’s daughter Bess and only a goodbye note left behind.\n\nSuspicious of Jamie’s sudden declaration of love and Babe’s decision to leave Bess, Tad confronted Krystal on what she knew. In the course of the confrontation, the baby switch secret came out. Tad lambasted Krystal, broke up with her and prepared to tell Bianca the truth. David stopped Tad by telling Tad that if Bianca knew the truth, it would mean a jail sentence for Jamie-for kidnapping and murder. David explained to a confused Tad that JR and Babe’s son, Ace Buchanan was alive and that Jamie and Babe had kidnapped him. Further, David had spotted Jamie standing over the body of a dead Paul shortly before he kidnapped Ace. To tell Bianca the truth would bring the baby switch out, Paul’s role in it, and soon after Ace Buchanan’s origins would be revealed—and it would be a short road to fingering Jamie for the kidnapping and murder charges. Tad realized that in order to protect Jamie, he could not tell Bianca that her baby was alive. Worse still, if Tad told JR he had a son, he would risk the authorities capturing Jamie. Tad decided to find Jamie, hoping the mess could be straightened out once they were face to face.\n\nTad found Babe and Jamie as the two prepared to tell Bianca the truth about Miranda. Tad urged them to turn themselves in and tell JR about his son (Babe and Jamie had renamed the baby James). Jamie refused and knocked Tad out. While Babe told Bianca about Miranda, Jamie kept JR locked in a warehouse to prevent his interference. Desperate to escape and in deep denial that Bess was Miranda, JR clubbed Jamie with a pipe, nearly killing him. Shortly after, Bianca fell off a balcony and slipped into a coma after demanding her baby from JR. Tad told Bianca’s mother, Erica Kane, the truth about Miranda, and she got a DNA test which proved Miranda’s maternity. JR attempted to flee with the baby, but Tad stopped him and helped return her to Bianca, who recovered.\n\nSeeing how ruthless JR had become, Tad chose not to tell him his son was alive. It was a difficult decision, but Tad did not want his beloved Dixie’s grandson to be corrupted by the Chandlers, as JR had been. JR learned the truth on his own and swore Tad out of his life for keeping the secret from him. JR worked fervently to find Jamie, Babe and his son. Fearing JR’s wrath, Tad tracked down Jamie and Babe and prepared to get them out of the country. JR caught up with them and had Tad, Babe and Jamie arrested for kidnapping.\n\nTad was released on bail and prepared to support Babe in her custody battle with JR and Kevin Buchanan, baby James/Ace’s legal guardian. Tad thawed towards Krystal, when he identified that, like her, he had made hurtful choices to protect his child. At the custody hearing, the kidnapping charges were dropped thanks to clever testimony from Kelly Cramer. In order to get Babe off of charges for keeping Bianca’s child, Krystal accepted a ten year prison sentence. Despite everyone’s efforts, JR was awarded custody of his son, whom he named Adam Chandler III (or “Little Adam”).\n\nKrystal was sent to prison, where she began getting harassed. Tad, his feelings for Krystal still very strong, told her he would use his influence to make sure it stopped. Krystal thanked him, but didn’t want Tad to feel obligated to her. She told him that he needed to move on and forget about her, as it was now impossible for them to be together.\n\nWhen Tad met the Chandler nanny, Diana Cole, he felt a strange connection to her. Tad was shocked when a Swiss doctor called him and told him that Dixie’s wrecked car had been found in the mountains, but without a body. Slowly, Tad began to gather clues that led him to suspect Diana was really Dixie. Tad had her fingerprints tested and they were a match. Tad confronted Diana, who admitted to Tad and JR that she was Dixie. “Dixie” explained that she had lost their baby in the car accident, and endured a grueling series of surgeries that changed her appearance. Tad realized that “Dixie” came back to town with a new identity because she wasn’t sure that she wanted to reunite with Tad. Hurt, Tad swore off “Dixie.” What Tad didn’t realize is that “Dixie” was really her half sister Di Henry, an ex-con hired by David to pose as Dixie in an effort to get Babe more time with her child.\n\nStill reeling off “Dixie’s” return, Tad proposed to Krystal. Krystal, who had missed Tad greatly, was tempted to accept. Krystal soon learned that “Dixie” and Di Henry, her ex-prison mate, were one in the same. In exchange for Adam securing her a full pardon, Krystal revealed this information to Tad and the rest of the Chandlers. “Dixie” admitted that she had been in prison under the identity of Di, but she truly was Dixie. A subsequent DNA test backed up her claim. Krystal saw the powerful connection between Tad and “Dixie” and rejected his proposal, claiming that his heart truly belonged to Dixie.\n\nTad began to suspect that Di’s ex-boyfriend, white collar criminal Kevin Sturgess, wanted her dead. Tad began to investigate Kevin, angering Di, who feared being exposed as an imposter. Tad and Di clashed, a powerful attraction simmering underneath. After one heated argument, the two ended up in a passionate kiss. The two seemed poised to find their way to each other, Tad still unaware that his beloved “Dixie” was actually her half-sister.\n\nTad learned that “Dixie” had inside information on the identity of “The Dragon,” the criminal that Julia Santos was tracking in order to avenge her husband Noah’s death. Tad begged “Dixie” to reveal what she knew and help Julia, but “Dixie” denied any knowledge. Soon, “Dixie” and Julia were kidnapped by Garret Williams (who was really “The Dragon”) and Tad fervently searched for them. In the process of tracking them down, Tad discovered “Dixie” was actually Di. Once Di was rescued, Tad confronted her with the truth. Di begged Tad to keep the secret, as her presence was softening JR’s hardened heart. Tad refused, and Di soon came clean to the entire town about her real identity.\n\nDi told Tad she loved him, and despite his anger towards her, she was going to fight for him. Tad fought his best against it, but his unresolved feelings for Di were powerful and they reunited. What Tad didn’t realize was that Dixie was actually alive, and Di knew, but was keeping the secret at Dixie’s request. Eventually Dixie was revealed to Tad, as well as Di’s lie. Furious and hurt, Tad broke up with Di and questioned where Dixie had been the previous four years. Dixie refused to tell Tad and when asked of baby Kate, only said that she “lost” her. Assuming Kate died, Tad was unaware that one of Dixie’s secrets is that their daughter is still alive, stolen at birth by Greg Madden. When Tad learned that Dixie had signed away Kate to Greg, under strong coercion, he was furious. He sought comfort with Krystal, and the two impulsively had sex.\n\nAn unknown person kidnapped Greg and buried him alive, demanding Kate’s location for his release. Greg ended up dying in the coffin. Tad was amongst the suspects, but grief stricken that the last link to his daughter had disappeared. Dixie and Zach Slater became suspects, were arrested and brought to trial. Tad claimed he saw them kidnap Greg. On the stand, Tad was discredited, claiming he lied to get revenge on Dixie. Dixie and Zach got off, and Dixie privately confronted Tad. He revealed that he had buried Greg, and crafted his lie about Dixie/Zach to be discredited and get them off. Dixie and Tad managed to forgive each other for their past sins.\n\nDavid Hayward manipulated Tad and Dixie into believing that young Emma McDermott was actually Kate, but a DNA test dashed their hopes. Dixie discovered that Krystal was pregnant with Tad’s baby—not Adam’s as she claimedand told Tad. Tad didn’t believe her, taking Krystal’s word that Adam was the father.\n\nA TAD QUICKIE\n\nAdopted by the Martin family when his abusive father abandoned him as a young boy\n\nRescued Dixie Martin from the mental institution her husband Adam committed her to, falling in love with her in the process\n\nBuilt a family with Dixie Martin and raised two boys, JR and Jamie\n\nWhile suffering from amnesia, taken in by vinter Nola Orsini and made heir to her fortune\n\nBlackmailed into marriage to Dottie Thornton\n\nDated Liza Colby while sleeping with her mother\n\nBlown off a bridge by Billy Clyde Tuggle and lived with amnesia for two years\n\nNearly killed by a crazed look-alike Ted Orsini\n\nCheated on wife Brooke (with Dixie) and later cheated on Dixie (with Liza Colby)\n\nDrugged by David Hayward, leading to an affair between Tad and Leslie Coulson, which sent wife Dixie into David’s arms\n\nMourned for Dixie for four years, only to learn she had not died but willingly stayed away from Pine Valley\n\nLearned Dixie had signed away their daughter, Kate, shortly after birth rather than give her to Tad\n\nBuried Greg Madden alive in an attempt to find his daughter Kate, unknowingly resulting in Greg’s death\n\nPINE VALLEY\n\nPine Valley, Pennsylvania\n\nPine Valley, Pennsylvania is the fictional setting for the long-running American soap opera, All My Children.\n\nIt has long been believed that Pine Valley (or PV, as it is called by fans on the internet) is based on the Pennsylvania Main Line, a chain of well-to-do suburbs in the vicinity of Philadelphia. It has also said to be located on the Llantano River, across from Llanview, Pennsylvania, home of One Life to Live. However, due to a map shown in a 1999 episode, it is, in fact, located in what is the Williamsport, Pennsylvania area.\n\nThe town, as the “Welcome” sign indicates, was founded in 1683. Since the shows premiered in 1970, Pine Valley has grown to be a buzzing metropolis, full of many business and residents.\n\nSome of the more recognizable companies are:\n\nChandler Enterprises, Cortlandt Electronics, and Enchantment Enterprises. In 2002, Fusion Cosmetics was started. Enchantment, also a cosmetics company, has usually battled Fusion on the shelves of Lacey’s, a popular department store in town.\n\nOther places of business include:\n\nThe Serving Spoon, a food shop; the Glamorama, a beauty salon; and the Boutique, owned by Myrtle Fargate. Fargate also operates her own boarding house. The Valley Inn and the Pine Cone Motel are also places of temporary residence in town. The Valley Inn’s dining room is a popular restaurant, while BJs, S.O.S. (Sounds of Salsa), and the Pit are more casual dining possibilities. The Seasons Casino is also in town.\n\nFor education, there is:\n\nPine Valley High School and Pine Valley University. How about pre/primary/or middle school???\n\nMedical cases are treated at both Pine Valley Hospital and the Front Street Clinic.\n\nThe biggest house in town is Wildwind, a large castle, while many other manors exist.\n\nThe current police chief is Derek Frye.\n\nPlaces of Interest\n\nBusinesses\n\nEnchantment\n\nEnchantment Cosmetics\n\nFusion Cosmetics\n\nRevlon/Giavanna Cosmetics\n\nCambias Industries\n\nChandler Enterprises\n\nIncredibleDreams.com\n\nCordlandt Electronics\n\nGlamorama\n\nMontgomery and Associates\n\nThe Boutique\n\nGreenlee Investments\n\nValley Investigations\n\nMartin and Devane Private Investigators\n\nLacey’s Department Store\n\nMedia\n\nWRCW TV Station - 2 WRCW Square\n\nTempo Magazine\n\nNew Beginnings (TV Show)\n\nNothing But the Truth (TV Show)\n\nThe Cutting Edge (TV Show)\n\nWave (TV Show)\n\nRestaurants\n\nBonnie Jeans\n\nSounds of Salsa (also known as S.O.S.)\n\nMcKay’s Restaurant\n\nCluck Cluck Chicken Shack\n\nPancake Palace\n\nThe Goalpost\n\nQueen Of Hearts Diner\n\nBJ’s\n\nChen’s Chinese Restaurant\n\nThe Chateau Restaurant\n\nEntertainment\n\nThe Pit (Bar)\n\nHolidays (Bar)\n\nHal’s Bar\n\nInsomniac Cafe\n\nSeasons Casino\n\nConFusion (Bar)\n\nResidences\n\nChandler Mansion (300 River Road) - Adam Chandler’s house with J.R.
