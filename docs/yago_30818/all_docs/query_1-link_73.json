        "text": "HELENA (AP) — Authorities say a 4-year-old boy's body was found in southwestern Montana and a Washington state man has been detained after a convenience store clerk spotted him washing blood off his clothes.\n\nAnaconda-Deer Lodge County Attorney Ben Krakowka says 38-year-old Jeremy Brent Cramer of Lacey is being held on a disorderly conduct charge while police are investigating the boy's death.\n\nCramer was arrested Monday night after a clerk reported a man in a convenience store restroom trying to wash blood off his body and clothes.\n\nA statement by the Montana Department of Justice says the man was involved a custodial dispute and took his 4-year-old son from Lacey.\n\nPolice found Cramer's vehicle 5 miles southeast of Anaconda on Monday. They found the body Tuesday.\n\nKrakowka declined to release the boy's name.\n\nMAIN STORY\n\nWash. accused of killing son\n\nToddler’s body found near Anaconda\n\nBy John Grant Emeigh\n\nof The Montana Standard\n\nAnaconda authorities charged a Washington man Tuesday with the murder of his young son, who was found dead that morning.\n\nJeremy Brent Cramer, 38, of Lacey, Wash., is accused of felony deliberate homicide, according to Anaconda-Deer Lodge County Attorney Ben Krakowka. Washington police reported the victim’s age was 3, but Montana authorities said the boy was 4.\n\nCramer made an initial court appearance Tuesday in Anaconda, where he asked to be represented by a public defender. His bond was set at $250,000.\n\nKrakowka declined to provide more details about where the boy was found or how he may have died.\n\n“We don’t want to compromise our investigation until we feel that we’ve found out everything we can,” Krakowka said.\n\nThe toddler’s body was found Tuesday morning off of the Mill Creek Highway, about five miles southeast of Anaconda. The boy’s name has not been released.\n\nLaw enforcement reported Cramer and his son left Lacey — which is a suburb of Olympia and about 620 miles from Anaconda — early Monday in what was described as a “custodial dispute.”\n\nPolice requested help from law enforcement in eastern Washington, Idaho and Montana in a search for the boy after the 31-year-old woman reported her husband’s fuel card was used in Moses Lake, Wash.\n\nThe boy’s mother told Lacey police on Monday that her husband had taken their child from their home and was not returning cell phone calls or messages, according to the Associated Press.\n\nAbout 10:30 p.m. Monday, an employee at an Anaconda convenience store called police after noticing a man trying to wash blood off himself and his clothes in the store’s restroom.\n\nA responding police officer allegedly found Cramer in the restroom not wearing pants, Krakowka said. Cramer allegedly ignored the officer’s order to put his pants back on and Cramer was arrested on suspicion of misdemeanor disorderly conduct.\n\nPolice later found the suspect’s vehicle parked along Mill Creek Highway, but didn’t find the boy.\n\nThe search resumed at daybreak and the boy’s body was found Tuesday morning.\n\nInvestigators were still trying to determine Tuesday what connection — if any — Cramer has with Montana or Anaconda. Details on the boy’s death and the possible motive remained under investigation Tuesday evening.\n\n“We’ve still got a lot of question marks in this investigation,” Krakowka said.\n\nLacey Police Cmdr. Jim Mack said an Amber Alert wasn’t issued because the mother, whose name is not yet being released, never indicated that the child was in danger, according to the Associated Press.\n\n“My officers had no reason to believe that the father was going to harm the child,” Mack said. “It’s a tragedy for the community.”\n\nHe said that Cramer had only lived in Lacey about a year, and had a Montana driver’s license.

Washington police reported the victim’s age was 3, but Montana authorities said the boy was 4.\n\nCramer made an initial court appearance Tuesday in Anaconda, where he asked to be represented by a public defender. His bond was set at $250,000.\n\nKrakowka declined to provide more details about where the boy was found or how he may have died.\n\n“We don’t want to compromise our investigation until we feel that we’ve found out everything we can,” Krakowka said.\n\nThe toddler’s body was found Tuesday morning off of the Mill Creek Highway, about five miles southeast of Anaconda. The boy’s name has not been released.\n\nLaw enforcement reported Cramer and his son left Lacey — which is a suburb of Olympia and about 620 miles from Anaconda — early Monday in what was described as a “custodial dispute.”\n\nPolice requested help from law enforcement in eastern Washington, Idaho and Montana in a search for the boy after the 31-year-old woman reported her husband’s fuel card was used in Moses Lake, Wash.\n\nThe boy’s mother told Lacey police on Monday that her husband had taken their child from their home and was not returning cell phone calls or messages, according to the Associated Press.\n\nAbout 10:30 p.m. Monday, an employee at an Anaconda convenience store called police after noticing a man trying to wash blood off himself and his clothes in the store’s restroom.\n\nA responding police officer allegedly found Cramer in the restroom not wearing pants, Krakowka said. Cramer allegedly ignored the officer’s order to put his pants back on and Cramer was arrested on suspicion of misdemeanor disorderly conduct.\n\nPolice later found the suspect’s vehicle parked along Mill Creek Highway, but didn’t find the boy.\n\nThe search resumed at daybreak and the boy’s body was found Tuesday morning.\n\nInvestigators were still trying to determine Tuesday what connection — if any — Cramer has with Montana or Anaconda. Details on the boy’s death and the possible motive remained under investigation Tuesday evening.\n\n“We’ve still got a lot of question marks in this investigation,” Krakowka said.\n\nLacey Police Cmdr. Jim Mack said an Amber Alert wasn’t issued because the mother, whose name is not yet being released, never indicated that the child was in danger, according to the Associated Press.\n\n“My officers had no reason to believe that the father was going to harm the child,” Mack said. “It’s a tragedy for the community.”\n\nHe said that Cramer had only lived in Lacey about a year, and had a Montana driver’s license. He said that police had never been called out to the home previously.\n\nMack said that the couple had been arguing about finances recently.\n\n“He had asked her earlier within the last couple of weeks if they could do a road trip to the East Coast, and she said, ‘No, we don’t have the money,”‘ Mack said. “It sounded like he wanted to go to the East Coast.”\n\n— Reporter John Grant Emeigh may be reached via email at john.emeigh@lee.net or phone at 496-5511.

The victim’s biological father, Jeremy Brent Cramer, 38, has been charged with deliberate homicide in the boy’s death and is being held in Anaconda-Deer Lodge County jail on $250,000 bond.\n\nNo further details on how the child was killed were released Wednesday, because additional pathology and investigation are required, authorities said.\n\nAuthorities have found what may be the weapon, but Ben Krakowka, Anaconda-Deer Lodge County attorney, declined to say what it was or where it was found.\n\nThe toddler would have turned 4 next Tuesday. His body was found about 150 to 200 yards from his dad’s pickup truck, which was parked near the Mill Creek Highway, about five miles southeast of Anaconda.\n\nThe trail of local events started about 10:30 p.m. Monday, when an employee at an Anaconda convenience store called police after noticing a man — Jeremy Cramer — trying to wash blood off himself and his clothes in the store’s restroom.\n\nA responding police officer allegedly found Cramer in the restroom not wearing pants, Krakowka said.

Police say the couple had been arguing about finances.\n\nCramer had been living in Lacey for about a year and had a Montana’s driver’s license, authorities said. Krawkoka said he had no information on Cramer’s background.\n\nCramer has requested a public defender, but Krakowka said he did not know whether one had been appointed. Cramer made an initial court appearance Tuesday to hear the charges against him, and a new court date has not been set.\n\nPolice were still investigating the crime scene and interviewing witnesses on Wednesday.\n\nIn Lacey, next-door neighbor Abdul Khan said that Cramer and his family moved in last summer. He spoke to Cramer only a few times, usually over their fence while both were in their backyards, he said.\n\nHe never saw a sign of any trouble with the family or any indication that Cramer was violent, Khan said.\n\nThe news of Broderick’s death “was absolutely shocking to me,” he said.\n\n— Reporter John Grant Emeigh may be reached via email at john.emeigh@lee.net or phone at 496-5511.

Donations for the family of the boy will be accepted.\n\nThe toddler, found dead near Anaconda Tuesday, died from blunt-force and sharp-force injuries, according to a preliminary autopsy. The boy’s biological father, Jeremy Brent Cramer, 38, has been charged with deliberate homicide in the boy’s death. He is being held in Anaconda-Deer Lodge County jail on $250,000 bond.\n\nMeanwhile, donations can be dropped off at US Bank and the Old Montana State Prison in Deer Lodge and Key Bank in Washington state. The boy’s mother lives in Lacey, Wash.\n\n“There’s been a lot of support,” Nichols said. “We’ve gotten a lot of positive feedback for setting something like this up. People want to know how they can help.\n\n“Gifts, cards — anything that would help Natalie Cramer, the mother,” are welcome, she added. “If you can’t donate, just be there to support Brody and the family.”\n\nAuthorities have found what may be the weapon, but Ben Krakowka, Anaconda-Deer Lodge County attorney, declined to say what it was or where it was found.\n\nNo further details on how the child was killed were available Thursday because additional pathology and investigation are required, said authorities.\n\n— Renata Birkenbuel, Montana Standard\n\nMelissa Penner’s son, Tyler Kelly, will be 4 years old on Friday.\n\nSo the death of 3-year-old Broderick Cramer outside of Anaconda last week shook her to the core.\n\nThe boys were born just days apart, but unlike Kelly, Cramer will never see his fourth birthday. The boy from Lacey, Wash., was killed, allegedly by his father, Jeremy Cramer, several states away from his family.\n\nPenner held her son on her hip, candle in hand, at Washoe Park Thursday night as about 75 people from nearby came together to memorialize Brody Cramer in a short ceremony led by two local pastors and organized by two Anaconda women.\n\nPenner, who works for the ambulance service out of Deer Lodge, said she knew she had to do something when she heard the news.\n\n“We had to come and support Brody’s mommy,” she said, holding her son close. Penner’s 11-year-old stepdaughter Charli Kelly stood nearby.\n\nYoung children dashed through the grass before the memorial service, some of them clutching at a stuffed bear or elephant. The toys will be sent to Brody Cramer’s mother in Washington as a gesture of support through the trying times she is facing.\n\nThe flowers, donated by a local shop, will be placed at the site Brody was found, according to organizer Aimee Nichols.\n\nNichols said she was at work when she heard the news. Her fiancé showed up at her work and asked her what she knew about it. He was tearing up, she said.\n\nNichols, the mother of two boys, a 5-year-old and a 1-year-old, said she knew she had to do something. She posted on Facebook, looking for feedback about a possible ceremony. It was through the social media site that she met Rebecca Gallagher, another Anaconda woman who was hoping to set up fundraisers for the family.\n\nThe two women met for the first time on Thursday night at Washoe Park.\n\nNichols said she and Gallagher wanted to show support for Cramer’s family, and that the mother of the 4-year-old was not only reeling from the loss of a son, but of her husband as well.\n\n“To have something like that is just … unspeakable,” she said.\n\nBut Anaconda’s support for the Cramer family says a lot about Montana folk, Penner said.\n\n“The community will always come together in a time like that,” Nichols said.\n\nReporter Piper Haugan: 496-5572, piper.haugan@\n\nmtstandard.com orTwitter.com/Piper_Haugan\n\nThe man accused of killing his 3-year old child near Anaconda admits to allegedly killing his son in an extensive recorded telephone call from the jail to his father.\n\nJeremy Brent Cramer, 28, in the affidavit released Friday by the Anaconda Deer Lodge county attorney Ben Krakowka, rambles repeatedly about killing his son.\n\nCramer faces a felony deliberate homicide charge in the July 8 death of Broderick Daniel Cramer, 3, of Lacey, Wash. Jeremy Cramer is being held in Anaconda-Deer Lodge County jail on a $250,000 bond.\n\nThe toddler’s body was found July 9 near the Mill Creek Highway, about five miles southeast of Anaconda. Krakowka determined that the cause of death was homicidal violence with blunt force and sharp force trauma.\n\nThe boy was likely killed on July 8, but Cramer was charged and arrested on July 9. The child’s mother, Nataliya Cramer, lives in the family home in Lacey, Wash.\n\nIn clearly a rambling, disjointed conversation as detailed in the affidavit, Jeremy Brent Cramer, 38, says, “My son is dead, 100 percent dead, yes I did it, something did it of me but I didn’t do it.”\n\nIn what appears to be an incoherent, confused state, Cramer repeatedly told his father what he’d done. The affidavit says Cramer was told the conversation would be recorded.\n\nJeremy Cramer: “I gotta have a lawyer with this stuff right here. I’m sitting right here at the county by the jail and I can’t comprehend reality right now.”\n\nFather: “Jeremy, you know Brody could still be alive.”\n\nJeremy Cramer: “He’s not alive.”\n\nFather: “How do you know?”\n\nJeremy Cramer: “I just know.”\n\nFather: “He might still be alive.”\n\nJeremy Cramer: “He isn’t.”\n\nFather: “How do you know? What did you do to him?”\n\nJeremy Cramer: “Because I … I picture him and I just died right there. I don’t know why I did it, I don’t know what happened.”\n\nFather: “Did you shoot him?”\n\nJeremy Cramer: “No, I didn’t have any guns on me.”\n\nLater in the conversation, Jeremy Cramer told his father, “I still got my son’s blood on me.”\n\nAt the scene, investigators found a fixed blade knife, a sheath, a pair of sunglasses and an orange and blue blanket that was covering a GPS unit, a large rock with blood and hair on it and a small rock with blood and hair on it.\n\nWhen arresting Cramer, police found an empty bottle with a prescription for 60 Adderall pills that was filled on July 3. In the affidavit, Jon Cramer, brother of the accused, had told detectives on July 9 that his brother was a drug addict and former methamphetamine user.\n\n“Why did I take all my pills? Did I take all my pills?,” and “Dad, Brody’s dead,” he said to his father later in the phone call.\n\nIn addition to the extended conversation, the affidavit reveals detailed description of the events leading up to Jeremy Brent Cramer’s arrest.\n\nLaw enforcement reported Cramer and his son left Lacey —a suburb of Olympia and about 620 miles from Anaconda — early on July 8 in what was described as a “custodial dispute.”\n\nAs Anaconda Police Department officers attempted to read Cramer his Miranda Rights on July 9, Cramer repeatedly offered additional information, as in “You gotta understand something. I killed my best friend.”\n\nA community memorial service was held in honor of Broderick Cramer Thursday at Washoe Park in Anaconda.\n\nOLYMPIA, Wash. — A Washington state man accused of killing his 3-year-old son in Montana talked to investigators about a cold case in which an unrelated child went missing in 1996, according to court documents.\n\nIn a search warrant application, a detective wrote that Jeremy Cramer mentioned to authorities that he had researched the case of Katrina Nash, whose body was located in an Olympia, Wash., park in 2005 in a case that remains unsolved. Olympia Police Lt. Jim Costa, who handled Katrina's case for years, said he is aware of Cramer's statements but has no reason to believe the man has a connection to Katrina.\n\n\"There isn't anything at this point that is going to cause me to reopen this investigation,\" Cramer said.\n\nAs part of the search of Cramer's computer, authorities planned to retrieve any information about Cramer's interest in Katrina's case. Montana authorities are also looking to collect information from the computer for their homicide investigation, according to the warrant application from July 11.\n\nProsecutors have said in court documents that Cramer, 38, told his father during a jailhouse phone call that he killed his 3-year-old son Brody after taking pills and running out of gas on a remote road in southwestern Montana. Cramer's wife had reported her husband and child missing from their home in Lacey, Wash., on July 8, and Cramer was later arrested in a Montana gas station washing blood off his clothes and body.\n\nBrody's beaten and stabbed body was found in a field. Cramer has been charged with deliberate homicide.\n\nIn 1996, Katrina slipped out of a room in the emergency section of Providence St. Peter Hospital after her mother had brought her in because she had been acting strangely. Her remains were discovered in an Olympia park in 2005, but officials were unable to determine a cause of death.\n\nCosta said it appears that Cramer was recently attending the same church that Katrina had attended, but that he had not been going there for long. It's not a very large church, Costa said, so Cramer may have seen a picture of Katrina or had a conversation with someone about her or found information about the case on the Internet.\n\nCramer's court-appointed attorney, Sherry Staedler, said she hadn't heard about the case of Katrina Nash and had not seen the search warrant affidavit.\n\nOLYMPIA, Wash.

Cramer's wife, Nataliya, had told Lacey police earlier in the day that her husband had taken their son and had not responded to numerous phone calls and text messages.\n\nInvestigators found Broderick's body the next morning.\n\nPolice found bloody keys and a knife on Cramer, along with an empty container for a generic substitute of the stimulant Adderall, according to court documents filed by prosecutors.

After seeing crime scene photos for the first time, District Judge Loren Tucker deviated from the terms of the plea agreement and left no chance Cramer would ever be paroled.\n\n“There is simply no way to explain away what you did,” Tucker told Cramer, saying he hoped “the little boy didn’t know what was coming.”\n\nProsecutors say Cramer, 38, was desperate, facing $30,000 in debt, a substance-abuse problem and a potential divorce when he took the boy and fled the family’s home in Lacey, Wash.\n\nCramer stopped July 8 near Anaconda, carried the boy on his shoulders to a field and killed him after taking prescription stimulants.\n\nProbation and parole officer Tara Billteen testified that the boy’s heart had been cut out.\n\n\"His head was almost removed from the body,\" she said.\n\nA hunting knife and a blood-covered rock were found nearby.\n\nProsecutors said the case, although disturbingly brutal, did not meet the specific legal requirements for seeking the death penalty.\n\nCramer admitted to the killing on a jailhouse phone call with his father. But he never explained why he killed the boy, implying drugs had clouded his mind.\n\nIn court Friday, he read a brief statement. \"I love my son and my wife with all my heart,” he said, “and this is something I have to live with.\"\n\nThe boy’s mother, Nataliya Cramer, also submitted a statement to the court, read by Billteen.\n\n“The world has ended for me,” she wrote. She imagines her son in the moments before his death, pleading with Cramer, crying “Daddy, don’t hurt me. I love and trust you so much.”\n\nAssistant Montana Attorney General Brant Light said that picture will “be with me forever.”\n\nAlthough Cramer has said he is remorseful for the murder, he told Billteen he is more regretful of drinking in front his wife “than what he did on the hill that day,” the agent testified.\n\nLight said that statement is very telling.\n\n“Not that you took a knife and killed your child,” he said. “Those are the words of the defendant, and I think those speak volumes.”\n\nDefense lawyers did not dispute any of the testimony. Sherry Staedler, a public defender, said Cramer was high on pills and “bouncing off the walls” at the time of the killing.\n\nAn Anaconda convenience store clerk called police when Cramer was spotted washing blood from his clothing in the restroom.\n\n“He was loaded by the time he got picked up by law enforcement,” Staedler said, and repeatedly asked his lawyers why he killed the boy.\n\nThe prosecutor said it was the first time in his 28-year career he asked a judge to seal the crime scene photos.\n\n“These were just too horrible,” Light said after the hearing. “And I’ve handled some gruesome homicides across the state.”\n\nThe mother said she clings to a vision of one day reuniting with her son.\n\n“I will be with my little angel boy after I die,” she wrote.\n\n— Reach Brandt at angela.brandt@mtstandard.com or 406-496-5519."
