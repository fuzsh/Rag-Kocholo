        "text": "From who is starring in the cast to what it will be about, here’s everything to know about the sixth ‘Yellowstone’ spinoff, ‘The Madison’\n\nThe Yellowstoneuniverse is expanding once again.\n\nThe Madison, the sixth spinoff from the hit Paramount show, was confirmed in August 2024 after previously being named 2024. While the spinoff was originally tied to Matthew McConaughey, Paramount confirmed that Michelle Pfeiffer was attached to the project and would star in a leading role.\n\nThe Madison comes off the heels of two previous spinoff shows, 1883 and 1923, while other spinoffs that have been greenlit include the limited series Lawmen: Bass Reeves, 6666 and 1944.\n\nRelated: A Guide to Every Yellowstone Prequel and Spinoff Series, from 1923 to The Madison\n\nThe original series, Yellowstone, will come to an end after the second part of season 5 airs in November 2024. However, it is unclear when TheMadison will make it to the small screen.\n\nFrom the starry cast to what the show will be about, here’s everything to know about Yellowstone’s latest spinoff, TheMadison.\n\nWhat will TheMadisonbe about?\n\nWith Yellowstone wrapping up in November 2024, TheMadison will act as a sequel to the show set in the present day, where previous spinoffs have been set in the past. According to the press release, TheMadison will follow a New York family who settle in the Madison River valley of central Montana and will be a \"heartfelt study of grief and human connection.”\n\nThough it's unclear if TheMadison will feature the same characters as Yellowstone, it’s possible they will make an appearance, as previous spinoffs have mainly focused on the Dutton family. The original series follows the Duttons, including Kevin Costner as John and Kelly Reilly as Beth, and their ownership of the biggest ranch in Montana as they battle drama from the neighboring Broken Rock Indian Reservation, Yellowstone National Park and developers.\n\nThe two spinoffs that have been released, 1923 and 1883, have both been prequel series by show creator Taylor Sheridan and have told the story of the Dutton family in those respective years before John and Beth came into the picture.\n\nHow does TheMadisonrelate to Yellowstone?\n\nPer The Hollywood Reporter, when TheMadison was first announced, it was set to take place after the events of Yellowstone. The show was meant to continue the Dutton family story with the introduction of new characters as well as retaining some old ones.\n\nHowever, now it is unclear whether it will follow an entirely new story.\n\nWho is in the cast of TheMadison?\n\nParamount announced Pfeiffer to be helming the lead role in TheMadison in August 2024 while also producing the show.\n\n“Michelle Pfeiffer is a remarkable talent who imbues every role with emotional depth, authenticity and grace,\" Chris McCarthy, the co-CEO of Paramount Global and President/CEO of Showtime & MTV Entertainment Studios, said in a statement.\n\n“She is the perfect anchor to the newest chapter of the Yellowstone universe, Madison, from the brilliant mind of Taylor Sheridan,” he added.\n\nPer Puck, Yellowstone favorites Cole Hauser, Kelly Reilly and Luke Grimes were in talks to reprise their roles in May 2024. However, they have not officially been attached to the project.\n\nWill Matthew McConaughey be in TheMadison?\n\nMcConaughey was previously the biggest name rumored to be attached to the Yellowstone sequel, formerly called 2024. In February 2023, the actor was rumored to be joining a then-unnamed spinoff as Costner was leaving the series.\n\n\"We have no news to report. Kevin Costner is a big part of Yellowstone and we hope that's the case for a long time to come,\" a spokesperson for Paramount Network said in a statement. \"Thanks to the brilliant mind of Taylor Sheridan, we are always working on franchise expansions of this incredible world he has built.\"\n\nThe statement continued, \"Matthew McConaughey is a phenomenal talent with whom we'd love to partner.\"\n\nThe following April, McCarthy confirmed that a spinoff would be occurring, though there was no news of whether McConaughey would be joining.\n\n\"Matthew and Taylor are fans of each other's work and have been speaking about ways they can work together,\" a source told PEOPLE at the time.\n\nSince then, there hasn't been an update on whether McConaughey will be cast.\n\nWhere will I be able to watch TheMadison?\n\nWhile it is unconfirmed where TheMadison will be available to watch, all five seasons of Yellowstone are available only on Peacock. It’s prequels, 1923 and 1843, can be streamed on Paramount+.\n\nFor more People news, make sure to sign up for our newsletter!"
