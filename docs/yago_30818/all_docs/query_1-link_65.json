After six years of marriage, Kramer filed for divorce from Caussin in 2021, citing adultery and inappropriate marital conduct.\n\n“As I try to make sense of a reality I never wanted to believe could be possible again, those words have now become a reality,\" she wrote on Instagram to announce their divorce in April 2021. \"I've fought y'all. I've loved hard. I've forgiven. I've put the work in. I've given everything I have, and now I have nothing else to give.\"\n\nPrior to her marriage to Caussin, Kramer dated country music star Brantley Gilbert. The pair met in 2012 and got engaged in January 2013 but called off the engagement in August of the same year. Before her relationship with Gilbert, Kramer was married to actor Johnathon Schaech from 2010 to 2011.\n\nHere’s a look back at Jana Kramer’s dating history.\n\nMichael Gambino\n\nAfter two weeks of dating in 2004, Kramer married Michael Gambino. In an emotional October 2016 interview with PEOPLE, Kramer recalled meeting Gambino when she was 19 years old at a Los Angeles coffee shop. She described Gambino, who was 17 years older than her, as “a smooth-talker, very charming, intriguing and obviously older.”\n\n\"At the time, I liked that. I felt protected,” Kramer explained, adding that she noticed a scary change in Gambino’s behavior soon after their wedding. He was easily angered and jealous — so much so that Kramer said she frequently spent nights in her car or hiding in the bushes until his mood subsided.\n\n\"When I said, 'I can't do this anymore,' he sent me a photo of my dogs on the freeway and said, 'I'm going to let them go if you don't come home,' \" she recalled. \"He'd kick me out of the house, I'd sleep in the car and then that next morning I'd be with him in bed again.\"\n\nKramer said Gambino also physically abused her, and on Aug. 6, 2005, he choked her until she was unconscious and left her bleeding outside of their home. He was later convicted of attempted murder and sentenced to six years in prison.\n\n\"I remember praying that night, 'Please, just take me away, I don't want to be here anymore,' \" Kramer recalled.\n\nGambino was released from prison in 2010 and died by suicide two years later.\n\nJohnathon Schaech\n\nKramer first crossed paths with actor Johnathon Schaech while filming the 2008 horror film Prom Night. Kramer and the Legends of Tomorrow star got engaged in December 2009 and said “I do” in July 2010. But just one month after getting married, the two called it quits. Kramer and Schaech finalized their divorce in 2011.\n\nIn 2022, Kramer surprised fans when she invited her ex-husband to be a guest on her podcast Whine Down. Together, the pair recounted their relationship and how far they’d come since.\n\n\"We were two very unhealed souls who came together,\" Kramer said. \"I was trying to fill a void — and there was no way you could've ever filled my need for love.\" Kramer had recently experienced an abusive relationship with Gambino, and Schaech was mourning the end of his marriage to actress Christina Applegate, which lasted from 2001 to 2007.\n\n\"We had wounds that needed to be healed, and we needed to do growth separately,\" the One Tree Hill star said on her podcast. Later in the episode, she and Schaech discussed their newfound friendship.\n\n\"I can go to their house and it's not going to be any kind of awkward situation. I respect him, I love his family,\" Kramer said of her ex-husband. \"I love his heart and what he does and I'm glad that the air, I feel like, cleared.\"\n\nBrantley Gilbert\n\nKramer’s whirlwind romance with country music star Brantley Gilbert came to an end a few months after their engagement. The pair met in June 2012 at the CMT Music Awards, and Gilbert confirmed they were dating on Atlanta’s WKHX radio in September of the same year, according to Taste of Country. Gilbert proposed to Kramer on Jan. 20, 2013, his 28th birthday. For the occasion, the “Bottoms Up” singer rented out Nashville’s historic Ryman Auditorium.\n\n“I was so surprised!” Kramer told PEOPLE at the time. “He asked my mom for permission before he proposed, which meant a lot to me.”\n\nIn August 2013, the duo called off their engagement. Earlier that year, both singers had been nominated for best new artist by the Academy of Country Music and due to their respective bustling careers, a source told PEOPLE that the pair were spending more time apart than together.\n\n“They are both so busy right now,” the source said. “They are both on the road and have to spend a lot of time apart, which isn’t ideal for any couple, let alone a couple trying to plan a wedding.”\n\nMike Caussin\n\nA year after ending her relationship with Gilbert, Kramer began dating NFL tight end Mike Caussin in August 2014. Four months into their romance, Caussin proposed and the couple got married in May 2015. They welcomed daughter Jolie Rae on Jan. 31, 2016.\n\nThe couple hit their first public bump in the road a few months later, in August 2016. At the time, it was reported that the couple were separating as Caussin entered a rehabilitation center. During an interview with PEOPLE two months later, Kramer revealed they split because of Caussin’s infidelity.\n\n\"Mike was the biggest of the betrayals because it was the first time in a relationship where I truly loved the version of me,\" the singer told PEOPLE. \"I didn't feel I had to prove that I was good enough, I was vulnerable and finally at peace with myself. But I was fooled.\"\n\nIn September 2017, Kramer clarified that she and Caussin were still legally married and working through their issues for the sake of their family. The pair renewed their vows in December 2017 and welcomed their son, Jace Joseph, on Nov. 29, 2018. The next year, on a 2019 episode of Whine Down, Caussin revealed he had a sex addiction, which originally pushed him to enter the rehabilitation center in 2016.\n\nThe couple released a book, The Good Fight, in September 2020, which chronicled the highs and lows of their marriage, but a year after the book's release, in April 2021, Kramer filed for divorce. In a 2022 episode of Red Table Talk, Kramer cited Caussin's continued infidelity as her reason for the breakup.\n\nSince their divorce finalization in July 2021, Kramer and Caussin have talked about their co-parenting journey.\n\n\"We're doing a really good job and I'm really proud of how we're able to co-parent,\" Kramer told PEOPLE in 2023. \"I think the first year was really tough, but I think now we're able to put our issues aside and then just come together for the kids because, at the end of the day, they're the most important things to us.\"\n\nGraham Bunn\n\nFollowing seven years of friendship, Kramer revealed that she and former Bachelorette contestant Graham Bunn were in an “entanglement” in June 2021. The singer acknowledged her relationship with the former country music radio host on E!'s Daily Pop after fans speculated about a potential connection.\n\n\"Are you breaking news for me that I have not even broken?\" Kramer said, later admitting: \"Sure we are in an entanglement. We're dancing the line of friends. We're dancing the line and I am happy.\"\n\nShortly after, Kramer clarified her comments on an episode of Whine Down. “First of all, I don’t even know what [an entanglement] is,” she joked, adding that although Bunn had been “sweet” to her after her divorce, she wasn’t quite ready to enter a new relationship. “He knows and I know that I just need to be alone,\" the singer said.\n\nIan Schinelli\n\nKramer and Ian Schinelli dated for around six months before going their separate ways in April 2022. The pair first met through a mutual friend, former football player Andrew East, at a birthday party.\n\nIn January 2022, Kramer became Instagram official with the former Navy SEAL, writing that it had been “really nice to find happiness” following her divorce from Caussin. Speaking with PEOPLE about their romance a month later, Kramer explained that she and Schinelli purposely kept their relationship off of social media in the beginning to avoid the “pressure” of being public.\n\n\"It's going good, but it's very hard to be in a healthy relationship outside of a toxic relationship,\" Kramer shared. She added that Schinelli was “very patient” with her as well as “helpful” and “hands-on” with her kids.\n\nIn April 2022, Kramer confirmed that she and Schinelli had broken up after sharing a slew of cryptic posts about being “happy alone” and after fans noticed that photos of her former beau had been wiped from her Instagram.\n\nAllan Russell\n\nKramer met Allan Russell on a dating app in 2022, and the pair went public with their relationship in January 2023.\n\nAfter nearly seven months of dating, the former professional soccer player proposed to Kramer in May 2023. Kramer shared all the details on her podcast, noting that her kids were also present for the special moment.\n\n\"It was a really beautiful night, and me and the kids were all sitting ... on the front porch of the steps, and just looking out at the view,\" she said on Whine Down. \"And he said my name, and I got up or whatever and then he got down on one knee, and Jolie just started jumping up and down. It was the cutest thing ever, it's like she knew what was happening.\"\n\nJust two weeks later, Kramer announced her pregnancy.\n\n\"I didn't think it would ever happen again, if I'm being honest. I've been through a lot, so this has just been a really beautiful thing,\" Kramer shared exclusively with PEOPLE in June 2023. \"I'm letting it all sink in. It's everything I've wanted and more. Allan was so sweet. He wrote me this little sticky note saying, 'You deserve the happy ending.' \"\n\nOn Nov. 13, 2023, Kramer and Russell's son, Roman James Russell, was born. While the couple told PEOPLE Roman's first name was a \"strong name that we both love,\" the baby's middle name, James, was an ode to both of their grandfathers. \"James (his middle name) was both of our Grandpa's names, so that was a nod to them,\" they told PEOPLE.\n\nRussell and Kramer got married on July 13, 2024, in Scotland. The couple exchanged vows in front of 35 of their closest family and friends. Jolie was the flower girl, Jace was the ring bearer and Troy served as an usher."
