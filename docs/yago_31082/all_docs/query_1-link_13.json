        "text": "Rebecca and Ivy Winthrop were friends since childhood. Despite having been married for over twenty-five years, Jonathan and Rebecca had only one child together, a daughter named Gwen. Rebecca was thrilled when Ethan and Gwen met and fell in love, because she always wanted her daughter to be rich and powerful. When she found out that Theresa and Ethan were involved, she immediately warned her daughter. Rebecca recognized the same lies and manipulations from what she herself had done as a younger woman...feigned friendship to steal another woman's man.\n\nRebecca's warnings didn't help, because Ethan postponed the wedding and began seeing both woman. After Gwen returned the ring, Rebecca was determined to get not only her daughter, but also herself in the Crane house, and get revenge on the little gold-digger for scheming to break up Gwen and Ethan's relationship in the first place.\n\nShe began an affair with Julian Crane, the plan to eventually get him to ask her to marry him. When she found the proof of Ethan's paternity on Theresa's laptop, she used Theresa's e-mail to send it to the tabloids. Most recently she filed for a divorce from her husband so she could land Julian for herself."
