        "text": "Genie's Mailbag\n\nAlexis Cooper in Missouri\n\nI'm testing your ability! I want to incorporate both of my grandmas' names in my girl name. Dorothy Vivian and Nancy Helen. Last name could be Cooper or Vinson so I need a name that goes with both. No common names but not too crazy of names either! Let's see what you've got! Thanks in advance! :)\n\nBaby Name Genie:\n\nFortunately I've been studying in my lamp all night. A change on Dorothy's middle name and a restoration of Nancy's first gives you the gracious and lively Vivica Anne. Do I pass the test?\n\nAlice in WA\n\nHi! I have two girls and one boy: Spencer, Sloane and Sawyer. We are expecting our fourth - a boy! We want his first name to start with \"S\" like his siblings. His middle names will be Memphis Faulkner. Can you help?\n\nBaby Name Genie:\n\nAh, smart mom. This way, when you yell at them, you can start the \"s\" and hold it while you try to remember the rest of their name. Very clever! When the youngest gets in trouble, just remember his name is Stewart.\n\nBreona in Phoenix\n\nHere is a challenge for you: My husband and I are both Latin. My first son's name is Elias Alexander Leyva. I want to name my second son Ariel Jesus, but my husband disagrees. He thinks Ariel is a girl's name. I want a name with the initials A.E. Can you come up with a nice Biblical name?\n\nBaby Name Genie:\n\nYou can thank Walt Disney and his mermaid for ruining the boy's name Ariel for you. Instead, try Aaron Ezra for a name perfectly suited for a young man.\n\nSee More Letters | Write the Genie"
