        "text": "Passions was weird.\n\nOn the one hand, the television show had all the things daytime soaps are known for: extremely good-looking people, other good-looking people who took over roles from the original good-looking people, an innocuous small town with an ironic small town name like Harmony, complicated romances filled with long, lingering glances, an unusually high number of hostage and kidnapping situations, and a lot of bad acting.\n\nOn the other hand, Passions had witches, dolls that came to life, zombies, and trips to hell.\n\nWatch the Passions scene where Tabitha brings doll Timmy to life. Post continues below.\n\nVideo via NBC.\n\nFrom 1999 to 2008, Passions entertained us with its kooky paranormal storylines. Not surprisingly, it was called the \"Twin Peaks of daytime TV\".\n\nIt has been 15 years since the curtain fell on our favourite soap drama, so what has the cast been up to since then? Let's find out.\n\n[Just a note: The list below is not the entire cast of Passions. Because the cast of Passions was more than 60 people (!) and it would take me days to write about them. Moreover, it would take you days to read about them, and who has the time?]\n\nLindsay Hartley (Theresa Lopez-Fitzgerald Winthrop).\n\nHartley starred as Theresa throughout its nine season run, which, in soap opera world, is rare. When the series ended, she joined another soap stalwart Days of Our Lives. From there, she moved on to long-running soap All My Children and then to General Hospital.\n\nIn between her soap drama roles, Hartley has appeared in various Lifetime TV movies.\n\nIf you recognise Hartley's surname (it was originally Korman), that's because she married her Passions co-star Justin Hartley - yes, the Justin Hartley who starred in Green Arrow and This Is Us and who later married (and divorced) Selling Sunset star Chrishell Stause. Justin played Nicholas Foxworth-Crane on Passions from 2002 to 2006.\n\nAfter playing the star-crossed lover to Gering's Luis, Westmore starred in All My Children. She has been in a few shows and TV movies since then, but spent the bulk of her time as the host of reality series Face Off, a competition featuring prosthetic makeup artists.\n\nShe married singer and entrepreneur Keith Volpone in 2002, and the pair divorced in 2011. Four years later, she married fellow Face Off judge Patrick Tatopoulos.\n\nIn 2019, Westmore revealed she had been diagnosed with Tourette syndrome when she was 10 years old. \"This was something that I had pushed aside, that I had Tourette's,\" she told People magazine. \"I thought of it as this annoying thing. I've realised that I don’t have to hide from it anymore. I don't need to stay quiet. I can tell people and not be embarrassed.\"\n\nJuliet Mills (Tabitha Lennox).\n\nStanton played a few different versions of the kind-hearted and magical Charity throughout her run on the soap drama, including her memorable turn as zombie Charity and playing her own sister. Let's be honest, Charity went through A LOT of trauma during her time at Harmony. It's no wonder she was constantly crying.\n\nAfter leaving Passions in 2004 (four years before the show ended), Stanton went on to star in the TV show Twins.\n\nShe was in a few shows and TV movies up until 2017 - according to her IMDB profile - before kind of disappearing from the entertainment industry. Hopefully she's having a grand ol' time, whatever she is doing now. She deserves it, after what Charity went through!\n\nJesse Metcalf (Miguel Lopez-Fitzgerald).\n\nShe was only on Passions for a year, but Winstead made a splash as Jessica Bennett, cousin of Charity and, as we found out later, a witch. The character of Jessica went on to be played by two other actresses after Winstead left - Jade Harlow and Danica Stewart.\n\nWinstead has had an impressive career since then, starring in films and shows like Final Destination 3, Grindhouse, Die Hard 4.0, Scott Pilgrim vs the World, 10 Cloverfield Lane, Fargo, and Birds of Prey.\n\nAs for her personal life, Winstead married filmmaker Riley Stearns in 2010, and the pair divorced in 2017. She married fellow actor Ewan McGregor in 2022 after they met on the set of Fargo. The couple have a son named Laurie, who was born in 2021.\n\nFeature Image: NBC.\n\nDo you love listening to This Glorious Mess?
