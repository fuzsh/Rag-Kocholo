        "text": "Plot\n\nSarah Winthrop has died and Gwen, claiming that Theresa killed her, gets Ethan to seek full custody of Jane from Theresa, leaving her heartbroken. . .until Theresa finds an infant on her doorstep with a note attached to it telling her to adopt her daughter.\n\nAnd Luis Lopez-Fitzgerald tells a heartbroken Fancy that his heart always belonged to Sheridan, who reunites. Luis and Fancy remain friends as newcomer, Drew Cain (with no memory of who he really is), arrives in Harmony, sparking Fancy’s interest, as she sets out to help him who he is and where he came from.\n\nCast\n\nGwen Hotchkiss-Winthrop – Liza Huber\n\nEthan Winthrop – Eric Martsolf\n\nTheresa Lopez-Fitzgerald – Lindsay Hartley\n\nRebecca Hotchkiss – Andrea Evans\n\nJulian Crane – Ben Masters\n\nLuis Lopez-Fitzgerald – Galen Gering\n\nSheridan Crane – McKenzie Westmore\n\nFancy Crane – Emily Harper\n\nDrew Cain – Billy Miller\n\nAlistair Crane – John Reilly\n\nChapter 1\n\nTheresa couldn’t believe that Ethan took her daughter Jane away from her. It was all Gwen’s fault, saying she was responsible for Sarah dying. Did Ethan have to take Jane?!\n\nThen she heard it. . .a baby’s cry. She had to be hearing things? Missing Jane made her hear a baby’s cry?\n\nThen she heard it again! On her front doorstep? Theresa decided to go look on the doorstep just to show that she was indeed hearing things. . .when to her surprise. . .it really was a baby crying—with a note attached:\n\n“Please take my daughter, Hope Amber, and adopt her as your own daughter.”\n\nAs Theresa picked up the little girl, she wondered who could have left her here. She must have been desperate to leave her on the doorstep. She vowed to find the girl’s mother.\n\nAt the Crane mansion, Ethan and Gwen put Jane to bed and went their own room to make some magic of their own. Life was great! Gwen thought to herself as Ethan made love to her. Theresa was miserable—all alone with just her thoughts to comfort her.\n\nAnd later, Fancy decided to take a dip in the Crane pool. She had a draining week when Luis told her that her Aunt Sheridan was the woman he loved and always would.\n\nAnd while they vowed to remain friends, Fancy still harbored feelings for Luis. But a quick swim in the pool might do the trick and get her mind off Luis and Sheridan.\n\nBut, all that would change when, as soon as she entered the poolhouse, when she was grabbed from behind……\n\nChapter 2\n\n“Who are you?” Fancy asked the man who had just accosted her.\n\n“I don’t know.” The man told her.\n\n“What do you mean, you don’t know?” Fancy asked the guy in her poolhouse. “You don’t know who you are?”\n\n“No, I don’t and I don’t even know how I managed to get to this town?” the man told a disbelieving Fancy.\n\n“Let me get this straight? You don’t know who you are, and you don’t even know how you came to this town?”\n\n“No. The last thing I remember, I was flying in a fighter jet to Afghanistan, when, <POOF!> the plane blew up!” the man told her.\n\n“OMG! You were in a tragic plane accident!” Fancy asked, “Are you okay?”\n\n“Physically I’m alright, but, I have no memory of who I am or where I came from.” The man told her.\n\n“I have an idea.” Fancy said. “Tabitha Lennox may be of some use.”\n\n“Who’s Tabitha?”\n\n“Oh, she’s the resident witch here in Harmony.”\n\n“You want me to see a witch?” the man asked her.\n\n“She might be able to help you find out who you are.” Fancy told him.\n\n“Well, it can’t hurt?” the man said. “I would like to know where I come from and get back to where I came from.”"
