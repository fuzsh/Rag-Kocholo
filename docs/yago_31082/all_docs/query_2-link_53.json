Luis hates the Crane's, he always has.\n\nLuis and Sheridan despised each other when they first met. Then they started to like each other more.\n\nLuis got assigned to protect Sheridan from the drug cartel who were out to kill her, and during that time they became very close.\n\nWhen Sheridan faked her death with the help of Hank Bennett, Agent Freeman and Eve Russell, Luis was broken hearted,he thought Sheridan was really gone.\n\nWhen Sheridan came back, Luis couldn't hide the fact that he loved her anymore. Sheridan and Luis finally started their romance, even got engaged. Everything was going great! They were going to have a double wedding with Ethan and Theresa, but on their wedding day as they stood at the altar, their wedding day ended when Ivy exposed Theresa as be the so-called one who told the tabloid her secret. Although, Sheridan's wedding ring was poisoned, so at least her life may be saved by this horrible event. Sheridan and Luis were happily going away on a nice vacation, but who was there other than Julian? As they were out on a boat, what happned? but a bomb on board! Sheridan fell out of the boat and a body was recovered and thought to be hers, they had a funeral and the whole deal, Luis was depressed and meanwhile Sheridan was alive and well living on an island with Doc, Liz and Brian (who turned out to be Antonio Lopez-Fitzgerald, Luis's long lost older brother) she didnt know her name and went by Diana, while she was on the island not knowing who she was she fell in love with Brian, eventually they got back to Harmony and Sheridan regained her memory, but it was too late, she was with Antonio and Luis was with Beth, Sheridan and Luis wanted to be together but didnt want to tell Antonio the truth because it may kill him, just as they are about to tell him, he goes blind! Sheridan and Antonio got married, Beth and Luis have not yet married and im still holding out hope that our beloved Shuis will be together once again."
