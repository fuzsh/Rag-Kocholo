        "text": "Hey, all. Been a while, I know. This has not been the best year for brains. I started the year in a job situation that got increasingly bad, to the point where I was speedrunning symptoms of depression (lack of appetite, lack of interest in usual things, lack of motivation, constant creeping dread, etc.) and also experiencing a fun stress-triggered dermatological outbreak (the likes of which I last experienced as an allergic reaction to scented detergent). My new job is much better, although still stressful at times, but getting back into old routines has been difficult to say the least. Then in the fall, a friend of mine had a health crisis, and our social circle has been affected by that; it also set off some latent things that it turns out I still needed to process about my own long-ago health crisis. Most nights and weekends, we’ve only had the energy to turn on movies or shows we’ve seen before, or YouTube videos, and maybe draw (I’ve been fairly active on my art Instagram, but the Instagram algorithm has gotten increasingly shittier, so while I still like making and posting art the potential endorphins from sharing it are basically irrelevant). Also, the world is just getting increasingly messed up!\n\nI’m going to try to be better at posting in 2024. I don’t owe anyone that, but I’d like to for myself. I do miss blogging more regularly.\n\nAll of this is to say, the year still had highlights. Here are some.\n\nNancy Drew saved my soul.\n\nI discussed the CW Nancy Drew in April, specifically regarding Nancy herself being super autistic, but the show had its fourth and final season more recently than that and I want to keep talking about it as much as I can. It’s such a good show. It’s not perfect, but it’s got elements of Buffy and Veronica Mars and Legends of Tomorrow and Warehouse 13 and, I don’t know, probably Gravity Falls or The X-Files or Twin Peaks (I’ve never watched either, but, y’know, vibes). It’s such a fun little weird show that takes inspiration from the original novels while also going completely off the wall. It’s in Maine now! Why? Because there are ghosts in Maine! Nick’s mom said so and she was right. Why are there ghosts (or witches, or shadow monsters, or)? Because that makes it fun. Normally in a fictional friendgroup of mixed gender, I will love most or all of the girls, like some of the boys, and absolutely despise others of them. Not so. I love Nancy (Kennedy McMann). I love George (Leah Lewis). I love Bess (Maddison Jaizani). I love Nick (Tunji Kasim). I love Ace (Alex Saxon). I would have been happy with literally any combination of romantic pairings (save the boys with Bess, since she is a lesbian) but I also love that ultimately the message of the show was that friendship is magic. This show unironically got me through some of the hardest bouts of bullshit I dealt with this year, and I thank it for that.\n\nMarvel happened.\n\nAnt-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania was this year, wasn’t it? That movie is fine. Not as bad as a lot of people thought, in my humble opinion, although it wasn’t a gem either. It did feature a grown-up Cassie (played by Kathryn Newton, known to us from drift partner’s beloved Halt and Catch Fire) being great and awesome, and more Janet (Michelle Pfeiffer). It also introduced Jentorra (Katy O’Brien), who is obviously a lesbian icon, and Quoz (William Jackson Harper), who is charming by virtue of being William Jackson Harper, and a little gelatin guy whose name we have willfully forgotten so as to call him Jeff (but in an Aussie accent). And, honestly, we do like Scott (Paul Rudd) now. We didn’t used to! In his first movie he completely sucked. But he got better when they let him be a giant dork, and he’s just a goofy dad now. We like him.\n\nGuardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 did nothing for me, or for drift partner; we went on a very hot weekend to get into the air conditioning and had a solidly mediocre time. The villain was nothing. Peter Quill (Chris Pratt) is nothing. Rocket Raccoon (Bradley Cooper) is nothing. I am happy that Drax (Dave Bautista) is a dad now, and that Nebula (Karen Gillan) is doing good things, and that Mantis (Pom Klementieff) is a horse girl, and that Gamora (Zoe Saldana) is happy I guess? I am outrageously angry about Lylla the otter (Linda Cardellini). I am angry because she is so cute and so sad but they didn’t make me any licensed plushies of her. I am angry because I had to watch her, an animated otter, kiss an animated raccoon I don’t like. I am angry because her name is Lylla, pronounced the same as Lila, which is also the name of Clint Barton’s daughter in the MCU, and Clint Barton’s wife is Laura who is played by Linda Cardellini. I know that Lylla is a character in the comics! But it still made me angry.\n\nLoki season 2 was fine. I love Sylvie (Sophia di Martino) so much. I love Ravonna (Gugu Mbatha Raw) so much even though she might be on her way to a villain arc (and honestly, I’d be okay with that – I think Ravonna should just be the new Kang, since we have gotten rid of Kang). Loki (Tom Hiddleston) is eons more compelling to me in the show than he’s ever been in the movies. Ouroboros (Ke Huy Quan) is perfect and I love him so much too.\n\nAs I already said re: The Marvels.\n\nMusic.\n\nWe got more Delta Rae – specifically an album of previously unreleased songs that they put out on their membership website. There’s not a lot to say about that other than that it’s very pleasant and listenable and nice. Janelle Monae put out a new album, The Age of Pleasure, and it’s delicious. I have not seen it on the few year-end album review lists, including Autostraddle’s, and I am shocked by this because it’s so great and wonderful. It’s not as high-concept as her previous work, but an album devoted to Black joy is so important.\n\nBarbie was a very good film.\n\nI was a doll kid (and I’m still a doll adult) and I really enjoyed the metahumor of Barbie (directed by Greta Gerwig). Lots of other people have said more insightful things about this movie, I’m not sure what I could really add to the conversation, but I did definitely enjoy it. Highlights include Michael Cera as Allan, Kate McKinnon as Weird Barbie, Simu Liu as one of the Kens, and the full musical numbers.\n\nPoor Things gets its own point.\n\nMy favorite of 2023 was barely of 2023, but it was a freaking incredible piece of art. That’s Poor Things. I liked The Favourite pretty well (the first Yorgos Lanthimos/Emma Stone collaboration) because I do love a fucked-up gay period drama, but Poor Things is otherworldly and surreal. I saw everyone comparing it to the Frankenstein story, and I would say yes, but also Candide, but also Lolita, but also it’s steampunk, but also it looks like a surrealist painting? Drift partner saw someone describe it as “Emma Stone’s diabolical fuckfest,” and then when someone in the movie actually said the phrase “diabolical fuckfest” we lost our minds, but that’s really only part of it. It’s also surprisingly philosophical and, weirdly, it has a happy ending.\n\nOther movies.\n\nIn chronological order.\n\nM3gan: a truly ridiculous attempt at a horror film (affectionate). Completely camp and enjoyable.\n\nMissing: a solid thriller, very similar in tone and structure though not plot to the previous Searching. Made funny for us because the suspected criminal was Ken Leung, who played Karnak in Inhumans, and it’s not his fault but Karnak (or Carfax, as we call him) was one of the worst characters in a bad show and we didn’t like him. Sorry, Ken Leung. You seem fine.\n\nShazam! Fury of the Gods: we watched this much later, on streaming, and boy are we glad we did because it just did not work for us at all. They managed to underutilize Rachel Ziegler, Lucy Liu, and Helen Mirren! The murder ponies were good, though.\n\nDungeons & Dragons: Honor Among Thieves: 10/10 very good. Drift partner is into watching people play D&D and other TTRPGs, and sometimes playing it herself; I sometimes watch, but playing stresses me out. Regardless, we are varyingly familiar with D&D tropes and gameplay, and this movie was camp and stupid and joyful.\n\nFast X: 100/10, also a delight. Jason Momoa is having the most fun in this movie, and everyone else is rocking it also. There is nothing quite like this franchise.\n\nSpider-Man: Across the Spiderverse: art. Nearly flawless. Beautiful to look at. A child in our theater loudly screamed when the cliffhanger was revealed. I don’t have anything particularly insightful to say, but this is a great movie worth watching over and over so you can catch new details.\n\nTransformers: Rise of the Beasts: deeply stupid, but kind of in the way that Transformers movies should be, I think? Maybe? It was dumb, but it didn’t make me angry in the way that a lot of Transformers movies do (probably because we watched it at the drive-in and riffed in the car the whole time).\n\nElemental: very nice! We also watched this later on streaming, but it’s pretty nice. Leah Lewis leads a pretty solid cast in a somewhat predictable but endearing story.\n\nRuby Gillman: Teenage Kraken: very goofy but very cute. Heightened by the fact that we’d just watched Schitt’s Creek and Annie Murphy was one of the voices.\n\nNimona: absolutely lovely. ND Stevenson’s debut graphic novel is adapted, not one-to-one but very true-to-spirit, and the cast (including Chloe Grace Moretz and Riz Ahmed) is fantastic. The animation is also beautiful.\n\nJoy Ride: a raunchy sex comedy also about friendship with a surprisingly touching ending. Very good stuff, and it even has a full musical number.\n\nThey Cloned Tyrone: a delightful Blaxploitation send-up. Teyonah Parris is a goddess. John Boyega is fantastic and phenomenal.\n\nThe Last Voyage of the Demeter: it is one chapter of Dracula set entirely on a boat where almost everyone dies. If this does not appeal this might not be for you, but it is so good and well-made and scary.\n\nBlue Beetle: delightful! Jaime is one of drift partner’s DC boys, so she was very excited, and I was drawn into that as well. Susan Sarandon is an excellent villain. Harvey Guillen steals the show as always.\n\nBottoms: a raunchy sex comedy also about friendship with a surprising ending full stop. Very hilarious. I’m pretty sure it was Y2Kcore (the clothes, the soundtrack, the lack of modern technology) but also it was timeless. Hazel (Ruby Cruz) and Josie (Ayo Edebiri) deserve the world and PJ (Rachel Sennott) is a protagonist who absolutely sucks, but in a realistic way.\n\nEileen: it’s kind of like if Carol was really fucked up. Anne Hathaway and Thomasin McKenzie are outstanding.\n\nWaitress: the Sara Bareilles musical, starring Sara Bareilles at time of recording, was recorded and put in movie theaters. This is especially magical because we saw that on our honeymoon, after having heard Bareilles debut “She Used to Be Mine” at a concert we went to on our first big date, and it was in theaters on the weekend of our anniversary. It’s such a good show and the recording was really solid.\n\nScott Pilgrim Takes Off.\n\nI won’t say a lot about this series because you just need to watch it and experience it, but the film Scott Pilgrim Vs. the World is one of the defining works of my heart, so having the entire cast and Edgar Wright return for an animated series filled my heart with joy. We watched the whole thing in like two days because it was so beautiful and delightful and good.\n\nOther television.\n\nWe did a lot of rewatching familiar things this year, because of the aforementioned horrors, but a couple of highlights: Severance is fucked up and intriguing and we were hooked instantly. I know that’s not a 2023 debut but it’s so so good. Schmicago, the follow-up season to Schmigadoon, basically made me die laughing but also die of delight. Dove Cameon and Aaron Tveit are everything. American-Born Chinese was a children’s show but a very solid one. Cruel Summer season two was completely insane, nowhere as good as season one, but riveting nonetheless.\n\nI dunno, man. 2023 was kind of exhausting, but it had some bright spots.\n\nIt’s been a year. Some cool things have happened (got a proper job, one of my best friends got married, my wife and friends and my dog and cat nieces are all very neat, I read good books and saw good media) and some shitty things have happened (the end of Roe v. Wade, had Covid, spent a lot of time hunting for said proper job, my cat nephew left us, I smashed up my car, yet another one of my beloved female characters got massively fucked over) and mostly in-between things have happened.\n\nHere’s a breakdown, I guess.\n\nMarvel happened.\n\nAs discussed last week and many weeks prior, including here. Last year was IMO an overall stronger year, but I might be biased because Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness offended my sensibilities so much that I refuse to watch it. (An Instagram pal sent me a supercut of Peggy’s [Hayley Atwell] screentime and told me when to stop watching so as not to see the Bad Thing and that was enough.) What a damn monkey’s paw, right? Live-action Captain Carter, but barely and she dies. Captain Marvel Maria (Lashana Lynch) but barely and she dies. Live-action America Chavez (Xochitl Gomez) but in a movie I can’t watch. Wanda (Elizabeth Olsen) starring in a movie, but she’s the villain and even though she gets redeemed she dies. (CBR just reposted my article about the overarching trope and I saw some comments on an aggregate, all of them from men complaining about how I wanted to be a victim and didn’t understand storytelling and etc. Normally I don’t seek comments but I was curious, and honestly, I’m proud to piss off manbabies.) I am, I think, a Thor: Love and Thunder defender, but that might be because I am so gay* for Valkyrie (Tessa Thompson) and Jane (Natalie Portman). Black Panther: Wakanda Forever is, as discussed, perfect. The TV shows were mostly okay. There’s good stuff coming. It just wasn’t as standout as last year to me.\n\nDC also sometimes happened.\n\nBy which I mean, holy shit drift partner and I love The Batman. We didn’t end up seeing Black Adam and the studio in general seems to be devouring itself, starting with its bottom, but The Batman is so so so good. We’ve probably watched it like five times already because we love it so much. Robert Pattinson is, fight me, a perfect Bruce because he understands that Bruce is a fucking autistic weirdo with no social skills and messy eyeliner; Zoe Kravitz is a perfect Selina because she’s always perfect but especially when killing shitty guys and having cats and being bisexual. The movie as a whole is just so aesthetic and interesting. 10/10.\n\nNona the Ninth, motherfucker.\n\nI do not remember the last time I lost my mind so completely about a book (series). The third installment in the Locked Tomb series graced us with its presence this year and… holy fuck. I cannot discuss a lot of the specifics without spoiling things, which I very earnestly do not want to do because it is so so so worth reading, but suffice to say: it was a very good thing that I hadn’t started my new job yet the week this came out because drift partner and I had to take turns reading and since she got it during the day she finished first and I took a Friday just to read like half of it and spontaneously combust inside. One of the things I love so much about this series is how consistent the books are while all being so tonally different. Gideon is a fairly straightforward, if dense, good time; Harrow goes off the rails with unpredictable narration and sometimes-second-person prose and you never know what’s actually happening; then Nona ricochets between bafflingly told flashbacks and present-day things that are both oblivious and insightful, childish and eternal. I had to take notes and they are nigh-incoherent. Alecto the Ninth is going to end me. Also, just the world and the fandom and the creative possibilities are so expansive and I’ve been having the time of my life doing related art.\n\nDelta Rae is making a damn musical.\n\nThey did a livestream this summer where they previewed songs from the musical they’re writing and I cannot get over it. The musical is about olde-tymey witch trials but also the Roanoke colony but also Brittany’s character is a Real Witch and there’s a creepy pastor and other very tragic characters and I am prepared to love it more than I have ever loved any musical in my life. We’ve had the preview EP on repeat ever since (and also the acoustic album they released, and also the holiday album they released, and I just love these guys so much).\n\nPaper Girls.\n\nI am absolutely obsessed with this comic, and I have been since it started. It’s about four, well, paper girls (girls delivering newspapers) in the 80s and then time travel and a bunch of other insane things happen, and when they announced they were doing a show (helmed by the guy responsible for Halt and Catch Fire, no less) I was over the moon. We binged it in a weekend, about, and it’s phenomenal! Adina Porter (who played Tara’s mother on True Blood) is in it, and Ali Wong, and a bunch of very talented teens. It’s pretty faithful to the comic, though in a slightly different order from what I remember; it touches on really important coming-of-age stuff like periods and sexuality and racism and the fact that sometimes being a teenage girl just makes you pissed off. It’s just really good and it is a Tragedy that Prime cancelled it (and on a cliffhanger!) so I hope it finds a new home somewhere else. Also, I love all of the girls so much and I want only the best for them.\n\nThe Sandman.\n\nThis is based on comics I haven’t read yet but drift partner has; regardless, I also loved it a lot. Technically it is a DC property, but like, is it even, though? The show is brilliant and absolutely star-studded: Tom Sturridge as Dream/Sandman/etc., and he is just a perfect goblin boy; Kirby Howell-Baptiste as Death, who hopefully recurs more in the future; Boyd Holbrook as the Corinthian, who is terrifying full stop; Gwendoline Christie as Lucifer, who chills me to the bone but in an uncomfortably sexy way; Jenna Coleman as Johanna Constantine, who is a little shit (affectionate) and also in an uncomfortably sexy way. We’re actually planning a Dream/Constantine cosplay (she’s Dream, I’m Cosntantine) because we loved it so much. Eagerly awaiting more of this!\n\nOther films.\n\nEverything Everywhere All At Once. Possibly the best movie of the year. Michelle Yeoh, Stephanie Hsu, Ke Huy Quan, all acting up a storm. As drift partner says, it is honestly embarrassing for Marvel to have released their multiversemovie in the same year as this actually good and significant multiverse movie. The Northman. It should come as no surprise to you that I personally ate this movie up with a spoon. It’s my boy Alexander Skarsgard and two of my favorite crazed actresses Anya Taylor-Joy and Nicole Kidman starring in the Viking legend that Hamlet is based on, and the Ophelia character (Olga) not only doesn’t die but thrives!!!! Nope. Another Jordan Peele masterpiece that needs to be seen to be believed. The Woman King. Viola Davis and Lashana Lynch could murder me and I’d thank them. John Boyega gets to act! African history portrayed in a nuanced way! The Menu. Anya Taylor-Joy once again giving it her all amidst an equally fantastic supporting cast in what I could only describe as a bananas satire of rich people culture except there’s also so much more to it. Glass Onion. Not at all serious but it’s like, a respected comedy, and anyway we just watched this last weekend but it’s so damn fun and everyone is, again, acting up a storm but special props to Janelle Monae.\n\nOther television.\n\nThe Book of Boba Fett. As I’ve said before, this show slaps and haters can buzz off. Our Flag Means Death. The queer pirate romp of everyone’s dreams. The only downside is that it does not feature a busty queer wench I can cosplay (yet). The Cleaning Lady. Elodie Yung wipes the floor (ha-ha) with everyone via her performance. though everyone else is very good. This show is fascinating but also deeply stressful and we are not caught up, oops. Obi-Wan. Peak Star Wars, IMO. Vivien Lyra Blair is a perfect baby Leia, Kumail Nanjiani and Indira Varma and Sung Kang are having an excellent time, Moses Ingram is a revelation, and Ewan McGregor made me actually feel things about a character who in the past has been mostly neutral for me. Andor. Also very good, but it’s also surprisingly stressful and we are not caught up. Oops. A League of Their Own. I’m actually well-acquainted with this movie, it was often on during my childhood, but the only thing missing was queers. The show delivers. Queers, queers, queers everywhere, and also more diversity! The Rings of Power. Tolkien stuff is drift partner’s area of expertise, not mine, but I enjoyed myself with this. Special props to Morfydd Clark as girlboss (affectionate) Galadriel and Ismael Cruz Cordova as Arondir. We have not actually watched Wednesday yet because we were finishing the below-discussed dinosaur cartoon and then it was time for Christmas movies, but I’m sure we’ll like it; likewise Interview With the Vampire.\n\nKids’ stuff.\n\nMy Little Pony: A New Generation. No notes, a wonderful film (and it inspired our pony deep dive, which is great fun). Turning Red. An absolutely beautiful film that also made me feel a little sick to my stomach because it was a period piece even though the period was the period where I was the same age as the characters and that’s horrible. Baymax! A good-hearted, consequenceless romp. Jurassic World: Camp Cretaceous. I know this didn’t premiere this year but we were recommended it by a friend and by god did we have a good time! And it has canon queer girls! This was especially fun because I personally have not seen any of the films in this series except the very first one and that one only once.\n\nOther highlights of the year: we saw Hadestown, which was fucking incredible. Good new YA books: An Arrow to the Moon by Emily X.R. Pan (Chinese mythology+Romeo and Juliet+high school AU), This Wicked Fate by Kalynn Baron (sequel to This Poison Heart; Greek mythology+magic+Black queer girls), Flip the Script by Lyla Lee (Korean teenage television actors do fake dating but real queer feelings develop!), A Scatter of Light (follow-up to Last Night at the Telegraph Club; queer coming-of-age in the 2010s). I finally watched Doctor Who (with the exception of selective episodes, which were un-recommended by a wise friend). The Into the Woods revival recording with Sara Bareilles and Brian D’Arcy James and Philippa Soo is phenomenal. Kristin Bauer van Straten and Deborah Ann Woll are doing a True Blood rewatch podcast and they’re through season two and it just makes me think about how wonderful and interesting my show was and I love hearing about it and about how much everyone involved loves each other so much. Um. I sold a few stickers on Redbubble?\n\n(Check out my art.)\n\nSo I know it’s been a while. Sorry. I started a new full-time job and we have been dealing with a bunch of miscellaneous real-life things, and also I’ve been working on updating my Marvel name compendiums to include every character on the wiki, not just on the first page of search results; that laborious project is finally complete (and I will probably do more names in similar style, but so far the winners are John variants with 1034 total and Charles variants with 25 live-action showings).\n\nThat said. Here’s our yearly ranking of Marvel Cinematic projects.\n\n1. Werewolf By Night\n\nI (drift partner) fucking love werewolves, but at this point stories about male werewolves are really hit-or-miss for me. However, I wanted to give this a chance, partially because of the inclusion of Elsa Bloodstone (played by Laura Donnelly; who I know from Nextwave: Agents of H.A.T.E., a miniseries very dear to me). I’m happy to report this special absolutely rules and we will be incorporating it into our annual Halloween media lineup. I love the homage to ye olde horror and how they use the black-and-white footage to play into that (and also barely keep it Disney-approved, which also rules). I love seeing Man-Thing because it’s just always fun to see him in things; he’s very weird but in a fun way. This is also, as mentioned, skirting the edges of Disney-appropriate; it’s campy as hell, but it’s just this side of fucked up in a way that I groove with. It’s very grindhousey/B-movielike/pulpy. I know Gael García Bernal from a Mexican film called Y tu mamá también that I saw (and probably should not have seen) in high school; this film was directed by Alfonso Cuarón (who would go on to direct Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban, the weirdest and cinematographically best entry in that franchise) and also starred Diego Luna, and I watched it because my friends thought the two main actors were hot, but it forever scarred my mother because of a scene where said boys jerk off into a swimming pool. All of this is to say, I know Bernal has been in other things, and I’ve seen him in those, but every time I see him I smile because “oh hey, it’s that guy who embarrassed my mom.” Anyway, he’s very good in this. We love Jack Russell aka Werewolf By Night (which, most are) and we love Elsa Bloodstone and we love Man-Thing and we just love this whole fucked-up little special.\n\n2. Ms. Marvel\n\nThis is right up there in the best things Marvel has made, period, and second only to WandaVision (which wins out for being more high-concept and weirder) in terms of the Disney+ shows. It feels a lot like Scott Pilgrim Vs. the World tonally, with the tongue-in-cheekiness and the animations, and that is a high, high compliment; it also has a touch of early Community. It’s literally only not number 1 because of the weird copaganda at the end of episode 6 (the cops would not join her side come ON). Iman Vellani is a delight and a star – everyone is on their A-game here, but she deserves special kudos. I (drift partner) do think that some of the stuff they did with her powers is goofy and unnecessary, but I think that they did a great job in general adapting Kamala and her family and friends. This was a real weekly highlight and I can’t wait to see more of her.\n\n3. Black Panther: Wakanda Forever\n\nI certainly don’t envy Ryan Coogler’s position with this movie. He’s spoken about the original plot for the film, which I would’ve liked to see (big spoilers for the existing Wakanda Forever film in that article!), but I do think that the film we have is a great example of how to handle the unexpected death of a lead actor with respect and care. Some of the plotting is a little messy and I think the final couple of scenes could’ve used a bit more script tweaking, but in general it’s a very solid film and a great character study of Shuri (Letitia Wright). Namor (Tenoch Huerta) is so valid and my new problematic fave, and Riri (Dominique Thorne) is a delight and I can’t wait to see more of her. (I think she and Shuri should have kissed, but also if Shuri and Namor wanted to kiss I wouldn’t mind that either.) Nakia (Lupita Nyong’o) and Ramonda (Angela Bassett) continue to be emotional backbones of the story and I love them so much. I do think that Okoye’s (Danai Gurira) character got kind of shafted, which is a shame, and the promised queer romance between Ayo (Florence Kasumba) and Aneka (Michaela Coel) is cute but a real afterthought. Still, it’s a highly enjoyable film, and I particularly appreciate how Shuri is allowed to be angry (because she should be!).\n\n4. Thor: Love and Thunder\n\nAs we’ve said before, Jane (Natalie Portman) becoming the Mighty Thor but then dying was something we were very wary of but actually thought it well-handled. Also as we’ve said before, there should have been more explicitly queer content with Valkyrie (Tessa Thompson). That said, this is a relatively enjoyable movie that mostly makes us smile. A lot of it is pretty stupid, but it’s stupid (affectionate). It’s goofy. It’s comic-booky, emphasis on comic. Ragnarok is a better movie, but Love and Thunder super-duper passed the Bechdel test and in a way that set our queer hearts aflame. Also, Thor (Chris Hemsworth) and Jane are one of the best couples in the MCU, fight us.\n\n5. Moon Knight\n\nThis show went off the rails, but mostly in a good way. Oscar Isaac’s performance as Marc/Steven/etc. is obviously what holds it together; I can’t personally speak to the quality of the disability representation or Jewish representation, but it didn’t seem aggressively cringey to me an outsider, at least. The real highlight of the show, in my opinion, is Layla (May Calamawy) – because the highlight is usually cool new ladies, but also because she’s great in general. Ethan Hawke, as villain Arthur Harrow, was… fine. He served his purpose, if his purpose was making me want to punch him in the face. (His last name being Harrow did at least give us good joke material, since sometimes they would say something about him and we could just be like “lol Locked Tomb” because it could also have been about Harrowhark Nonagesimus. Admittedly, we also made a lot of Locked Tomb jokes at ourselves during Werewolf By Night.)\n\n6. Guardians of the Galaxy Christmas Special\n\nThis is the most palatable Guardians media because it has blessedly little Peter Quill (Chris Pratt). It’s mostly about Mantis (Pom Klementieff) and Drax (Dave Bautista) having a festive sidequest and getting into Earth shenanigans, and that’s a pretty good premise. It’s also deeply funny to introduce 2 pieces of important lore (Mantis is Quill’s bio-sister; the Guardians bought Knowhere) in a one-off holiday special that casual fans likely skipped because it means that either Vol. 3 will just assume you already know and confuse people or Vol. 3 will have awkward dialogue reiterating these points. That said, it’s kind of nothing and while we appreciate the inclusion of the dog, there was not nearly enough dog.\n\n7. She-Hulk\n\nI (drift partner) was dreading this show basically since it got announced, because She-Hulk is very special to me as a short woman who wishes she was big and scary. The casting of Tatiana Maslany, who is a very talented actress but not…exactly my idea of Shulkie, did not do anything for my expectations. This show is…fine? At its very best it’s even enjoyable. The fourth-wall breaking stuff is so cute! Nikki (Ginger Gonzaga) and Titania (Jameela Jamil) are fun! But there are some adaptational choices that I just cannot get behind, chief among them the colossally dipshit explanation for Jen getting some of Bruce’s (Mark Ruffalo) blood. I realize that at this point in the timeline Bruce would be against giving his blood to his cousin, even in a life-threatening situation, but I really feel there had to be a better way to do this than “lol I dunno they fall down and the blood mixes together.” I also think she was simply not big enough! I will die on this hill – she should have been seven feet tall and had enormous muscles! You have already denied me brick shithouse Captain Marvel, must we also take this from me? Oh, but I do like that Matt (Charlie Cox) and Jen fuck. They deserve that.\n\n*Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness\n\nAs we have previously stated, fuck this movie a lot and we did not watch it so it cannot be technically ranked (but we rank it -10000).\n\nAlso, if you want to read me talking more about Jane and also Padme from Star Wars, here.\n\nYeah, I’m doing part 2 already. This just interests me. Once again: I’m going through name popularity lists in the US (where Marvel is published), this time at the #2 and #3 spots (which will be grouped together), from 1939 (when Marvel Comics started) to 2021, and seeing how many Marvel characters have those names (or popular variants) on… the first page of search results on the Marvel wiki (or if I remember other ones).\n\nEdit: I’ve gone back and looked at the character list on the wiki for complete totals. Of note: I am not including real-life figures who just appear momentarily (i.e. real-life newscasters or political figures) but I am including real-life figures who appear in the plot significantly (i.e. AUs or when writers write themselves in as characters that affect the plot). I’m also not including any of the animal pun names or dumb parody names from the What The -?! stories.\n\nJames (1939, 1953-1960, 1966-1967, 1969-1972), Jacob (1996-1998, 2013): “holder of the heel,” “supplanter”\n\nCovered last week. 331 variants (including Jacob variants).\n\nBarbara (1939-1945, 1948): “foreign”\n\nCovered last week. 54 variants.\n\nRobert (1940-1952, 1954, 1956): “bright fame”\n\nCovered last week. 368 variants (including Barbara variants).\n\nJohn (1939-1952, 1962-1965, 1968): “god is gracious”\n\nJohn: John Adams, John Allen Adams, (St.) John Allerdyce (Pyro), John Aman (Prince of Orphans), John Anderson, John Anderson, John “Johnny” Anvil, John Archer, John “Jack” D.

It also bears mention that while Suki is a nickname for Susan, the Sukis appearing in Marvel all seem to be Japanese, i.e. their names don’t technically derive; similarly, while Sui-San clearly visually apes Susan in Marvel alien style, it could also the use Japanese/Chinese name elements “sui” and “san.\n\nLisa (1961, 1970-1972): “my God is an oath”\n\nCovered last week. 24 variants.\n\nKaren (1965): “each of the two,” “my consecration of your name,” “torture,” “pure”\n\nKaren: Karen Anderson, Karen Berger, Karen Blake, Karen Cavella, Karen Fink, Karen Fowler, Karen Gleason, Karen Hildebrande, Karen Jenson, Karen King, Karen Lee (Kali), Karen Little, Karen Macendale, Karen Mason, Karen Mitchell, Karen O’Malley, Karen Page, Karen Lee Ross, Karen Skoglund, Karen Sterling, Karen Sutter, Karen Trudeaux (Sagittarius), Karen Wallis, Karen the A.I.\n\nKaryn: Karyn Charlene “Kasey” Nash (Payback)\n\nKarrin: Karrin _\n\nKatherine: Katherine Ainsley-Jones, Katherine Beere, Katherine “Kate” Bishop (Hawkeye), Katherine Blaire Brown, Katherine Bohusk, Katherine Brick, Katherine Cross, Katherine “Kat” Farrell, Katherine “Kate” Frasier, Katherine Fury, Katherine Glover, Katherine Hahn (Feeva), Katherine “Kate” Howlett (Shine), Katherine Huggen (Captain Albion), Katherine “Katy” Kiernan, Katherine “Kathy” Ling, Katherine “Kate” McClellan, Katherine Petrezyn (Kay), Katherine “Katie” Power (Energizer), Katherine “Kitty” or “Kate” Pryde (Shadowcat), Katherine “Kit” Renner, Katherine Reynolds, Katherine Spar, Katherine Summers, Katherine Kate Waynesboro (Kate Oldstrong)\n\nCatherine: Catherine D’Antan (Commanda), Catherine Deshayes (LaVoisin), Catherine Eddowes, Catherine Forsythe, Catherine Gray, Catherine “Cath” Mora, Catherine Moranis, Catherine Palumbo, Catherine Price, Catherine Saccharine, Catherine Saint, Catherine Starr, Catherine Totebind, Catherine Wilder, Catherine Yama, Catherine _ (x2)\n\nKatheryn: Katheryn Twoyoungmen\n\nKathryn: Kathryn Cushing, Kathryn O’Brien, Kathryn Worthington\n\nKathy: Kathy Abbot, Kathy Allen, Kathy Bohusk, Kathy Cabot, Kathy Carter, Kathy Collins, Kathy Diamond, Kathy Ffoulkes, Kathy Malpers, Kathy Savage, Kathy Schilling, Kathy Somers Marlowe, Kathy Stewart, Kathy Stubbs, Kathy Warner\n\nKathi: Kathi Blizzard\n\nCathy: Cathy Aldrin, Cathy Bradley, Cathy Calvin, Cathy Jones, Cathy Webster (Free Spirit)\n\nKate: Kate Ashford (Napalm), Kate Carter, Kate Cooke, Kate Donegan, Kate Dwyer, Kate Horsley (Fatale), Kate Kildare, Kate Neville, Kate Shappe, Kate Stryker, Kate Vinokur, Kate Walker (Super-Patriot), Kate Williams, Kate _\n\nKatie: Katie Atkinson (Iolanthe), Katie Barton, Katie Giacomo, Katie Hague, Katie Karnelli, Katie Kubert, Katie Mae, Katie Maxwell, Katie Sawyer (Gone Gal), Katie Worth, Kaesong Katie, Korea Katie, Katie _\n\nKaty: Katy Bashir, Katy Chen, Katy Cobb, Katy Fong, Katy Kiernan\n\nKatey: Katey Tong\n\nKadee: Kadee “Aliyah” Bishop\n\nKatrina: Katrina Carlson, Katrina Collins, Katrina Fox, Katrina Jones, Katrina Luisa van Horn (Man-Killer), Katrina Vesotzky (Rapture)\n\nKatarina: Katarina Karkov\n\nKaterina: Katerina Astrovik, Katerina Stenski\n\nCatalina: Catalina Chavez\n\nKatya: Katya Belyakov, Katya Kosinsky, Katya (Painkiller)\n\nKateri: Kateri Deseronto\n\nKathleen: Kathleen Dare, Kathleen Neville, Kathleen O’Meara, Kathleen Sparr, Kathleen _\n\nKaitlyn: Kaitlyn O’Hara\n\nCaitlyn: Caitlyn MacDonald\n\nCaitlan: Caitlan Lieber\n\nCaitlin: Caitlin Bailey, Caitlin Johns, Caitlin Leigh, Caitlin Maddox, Caitlin Strucker (5)\n\nKaitlin: Kaitlin Kirn\n\nKaitlyn: Kaitlyn O’Hare\n\nKatelin: Bobbi used “Katelin” as an alias once because Fitz spelled it weird on her nametag and it is still my favorite joke from SHIELD\n\nEkaterina: Ekaterina Gryaznova (Gryphon)\n\nKatinka: Katinka _\n\nKatrinka: Katrinka Janice “K.J.” Clayton\n\nKarinna: Karinna Rose\n\nKay: Kay Cera (Cuckoo), Kay Glayvor (Lure), Kay James, Kay Osborn, Kay-Sade, Kay _\n\nKaya: Kaya _\n\nKayla: Kayla Ballantine (Star Brand), Kayla Kurasawa, Kayla Silverfox, Kayla _\n\nKaylie: Kaylie Doran, Kaylie _\n\nKaylo: Kaylo _\n\n170 characters with a Katherine-variant name, since Karen itself is a Katherine variant. 15 are live-action. This is so far the most prominently used female name in this bunch (Mary, of course, has it beat), since there are so many variants (and I might have even missed a few). Sidenote: my headcanon is that Peter named his A.I. “Karen” because he’s a big fan of Karen Page’s reporting.\n\nKimberly (1966-1968, 1970): “from the meadow of the royal fortress”\n\nKimberly: Kimberly Dee (Catwalk), Kimberly “Kim” Gaunt, Kimberly Porter, Kimberly Potters (Serpentina), Kimberly Price, Kimberly Rourke, Kimberly Schau (Dazzler), Kimberly “Kim” Vesco\n\nKim: Kim Alleyne, Kim Drunter, Kim Ho Twae, Kim Hong (Scout), Kim Hwang, Kim Il Sung (Scrambler), Kim Lewis (Black Rider), Kim Rhee, Kim Riley, Kim Sak, Kim Sung Young, Kim Wells, Kim Woo, Kim _\n\nKimmie: Kimmie Kinmont\n\nKimura: Kimura _ (x2)\n\nKimora: Kimora _\n\nKimeiko: Kimeiko Ashu\n\nKimmo: Kimmo Tuolema\n\n28 characters with a Kimberly-variant name. This is one of those ones where there are a lot of “Kim” variants that aren’t anywhere near “Kimberly” variants, but they all still track to “Kim” so I’m counting it for the list. We could stand more live-action Kims, since there aren’t really any (Kim Hwang was just mentioned in Runaways).\n\nMichelle (1967-1969, 1971-1974): “who is like God?”\n\nCovered last week. 19 variants (see Michael).\n\nJennifer (1969, 1985): “fair one,” “white wave”\n\nCovered last week. 76 variants.\n\nChristopher (1972-1995): “bearing Christ”\n\nChristopher: Christopher Aaronson (King Bedlam), Christopher Alleyne, Christopher Bach, Christopher Bradley (Bolt), Christopher “Chris” Maurice Brown, Christopher “Chris” Cassera (Kid Deadpool), Christopher Colchiss (Melter), Christopher Daniels (Suicide), Christopher Fallon (Guardsman), Christopher Ganyrog (Scientist Supreme), Christopher Joyner, Christopher “Chris” Kinzky, Christopher Knight, Christopher “Kit” Marlowe, Christopher “Chris” Miller, Christopher Muse (Triage), Christopher O’Leary, Christopher Powell (Darkhawk), Christopher “Chris” Seyfert, Christopher Sinclair, Christopher Summers (Corsair), Christopher Summers II, Christopher Taylor, Christopher Thorn (Doctor Synne), Christopher “Scar” Tobin, Christopher Walsh\n\nChris: Big Chris Angelone, Chris Baiocchi, Chris Baker, Chris Barret (Metallurge), Chris Busse, Chris Chernin (Blindside), Chris Claremont, Chris Colin, Chris Cosentino, Chris Davidson, Chris Dingess, Chris Donnelly, Chris Douglas, Chris Durbin, Chris Falk, Chris Fuerst, Chris Gonzalez, Chris Jarkoer, Chris Johnson, Chris Kapostopolis, Chris Kong, Chris Larmouth, Chris McCarthy (Ant-Man), Chris McKee, Chris McNally, Chris Miller, Chris Morrow, Chris Noel, Chris Nolan, Chris Paxton (Cardiaxe), Chris Peters, Chris Peterson, Chris Quinn, Chris Rafferty, Chris Ramsey (Mad Sculptor), Chris Reichert, Chris Rollins, Chris Sanders, Casanova Chris Sims, Chris Svoba, Chris Townsend, Chris Taylor, Chris Yen, Chris _ (x3)\n\nTopher: Topher Vasquez\n\nChristoph: Christoph Haizmann, Christoph Nord (Maverick)\n\nCristoph: Cristoph Pfeifer (Iron Monger)\n\nCristu: Cristu Bulat\n\nCristo: Cristo Pike\n\nCrisqó: Crisqó _\n\nKristoff: Kristoff Vernard Von Doom\n\nKris: Kris Anderson (Slab), Kris Boyle, Kris Cleary, Kris DeGann, Kris Keating, Kris Kipiniak\n\nKriss: Kriss “Gabby” Lout\n\n87 characters with a Christopher-variant name. This is another one that’s surprisingly absent in the live-action stuff, with only 4 qualifiers. Although “Christina” is often used as the “girl” version of Christopher, it’s technically a variant of Christian, so I’m not going to analyze it here.\n\nJason (1973-1980): “healer”\n\nJason: Jason Aaron, Jason Adamson, Jason Anders, Jason Bailey, Jason Bartholomew, Jason Beere (Eternity Man), Jason Berg, Jason Birch, Jason Black, Jason Burr, Jason Carrington, Jason Carter, Jason Clemons, Jason Collier, Jason Cragg (the Voice), Jason Cross, Jason Dean (Photon), Jason Faust, Jason Frankenstein, Jason “Jay” Garrick (Speed Demon), Jason Grayson (Bunky), Jason Grey, Jason Grimm (Skull Punch), Jason Grubb, Jason Halifax, Jason Ionello, Jason Jackson, Jason Jerome, Jason Keith, Jason Kimball (Genii), Jason Knight, Jason Latour, Jason Philip Macendale Jr. (Hobgoblin), Jason Maldonado (Soulfire), Jason McAllister, Jason McCall (Soul Man), Jason Pierce (Ember), Jason Pinter, Jason Powell, Jason Praed (Crossbow), Jason Pruett, Jason Quantrell, Jason Quartermaster, Jason Quill, Jason Reichert, Jason Reynolds, Jason Rivera, Jason Roland (Hangman), Jason “Rudy” Rubenstein, Jason Silence, Jason Sloan, Jason Spierling, Jason Staid, Jason “Slappy” Struthers (Excalibur), Jason Strongbow (American Eagle), Jason Stryker, Jason Suh, Jason “Jay-Jay” Thomas (Nighty-Nightcrawler), Jason Thornehill, Jason Todd (Deathlok), Jason Treemont, Jason Tso, Jason Weirdler, Jason Wilkes, Jason Wilkes, Jason Wong, Jason Wyngarde (Mastermind), Jason _ (x8) (75)\n\nJayson: Jayson Jay\n\nJaycen: Jaycen (Flint)\n\nJayce: Jayce Paz\n\nJay: Jay Alvaro, Jay Burnell (Deadeye), Jay Carter, Jay Chander, Jay Chord, Jay DeMore (Crooked Man), Jay Fosgitt, Jay Jameson, Jay Kelsey, Jay Little Bear, Jay Prentiss, Jay Sero, Jay T. Thomas (Spider-Man), Jay _\n\nJaye: Jaye P. Morgan\n\n93 characters with a Jason-variant name. 2 of the 3 live-action Jasons are Fox/pre-D+ TV. Not much to say here.\n\nAmy (1973-1977): “beloved”\n\nAmy: Amy Bendix, Amy Brehe, Amy Brewer (Autopsy), Amy Brys, Amy Casey, Amy Chen, Amy Conklin, Amy Fink, Amy Grimes, Amy Haller, Amy Lou Johnston, Amy Kearse, Amy Kwitny (Choice), Amy LaFuente, Amy McCloud, Amy Minoru, Amy Parks, Amy Powell, Amy Springer, Amy Stringer, Amy _ (x3)\n\nAimee: Aimee Shih, Aimee _\n\nAmi: Ami Han (White Fox)\n\nAimi: Aimi Yoshida\n\nAmie: Amie Zamborano (Makeshift)\n\nAmytis: Amytis _\n\nAmiko: Amiko Kobayashi\n\n30 characters with an Amy-variant name Ami and Amiko are, in this case, not actually Amy derivatives, but they’re soundalike/etc. There have been three live-action Amys, all on TV, but hell, bring it on, give us more. I like the name Amy so much (entirely because of Sailor Moon).\n\nHeather (1975): “from the flower”\n\nHeather: Heather Bishop, Heather Cameron (Lifeguard), Heather Douglas (Moondragon), Heather Faraday, Heather Glenn, Heather Hanneman (Raindrop), Heather Hite (Glider), Heather Krolnek, Heather Lemuel (Bloodhawk), Heather McDaniel (Sasquatch), Heather McNeil Hudson (Vindicator), Heather Noble, Heather O’Gara (Blackbird), Heather Duncan Rand (Silver Dragon), Heather Sante, Heather Silver, Heather Tucker (Tempo), Heather _ (x3)\n\n20 characters named Heather. There really aren’t variants of this one, which I assume accounts for its small showing. Of note, none of the 3 live-action Heathers make much of a showing: Heather Glenn just appears in a voicemail, Heather Hudson just appears as an old lady who gets fridged, and Heather Rand just appears as a mom who gets fridged.\n\nMelissa (1976-1979): “bee”\n\nMelissa: Melissa Bowen, Melissa Carsdale (Misery), Melissa Collier, Melissa Gold (Screaming Mimi/Songbird), Melissa Hanover (Moonglow), Melissa Morbeck (Iron Ring), Melissa Morley (Poltergeist), Melissa Scott (Tinsel), Melissa Tarleton\n\nMelissandra: Melissandra _\n\nMelinda: Melinda Brewer, Melinda Cass (Princess Justice), Melinda Dennis, Melinda Leucenstern, Melinda May, Melinda McDonough (Red Hornet), Melinda Mendez, Melinda Morrison, Melinda Pressman, Melinda Snodgrass, Melinda Taylor, Melinda Wallace\n\nLissa: Lissa Russell, Lissa _\n\nMindy: Mindy Bolton, Mindy Glidewell, Mindy Martin, Mindy McPherson, Mindy Peterson, Mindy Urich, Mindy Vance, Mindy Williams (Chorus) (8)\n\nMindee: Mindee Cuckoo/Frost\n\nMissy: Missy Kallenbach, Missy Lopez, Missy _\n\n36 characters with a Melissa-variant name. Once again, all 6 live-action Melissas/etc. are Fox/Sony/pre-D+ TV. We could probably stand to have a couple more in the near future.\n\nJessica (1978, 1980-1984, 1991-1992, 1996-1997): “to behold”\n\nCovered last week. 17 variants.\n\nAmanda (1979-1988, 1992): “lovable, worthy of love”\n\nAmanda: Amanda Armstrong, Amanda Ballard, Amanda Batavides, Amanda Blake, Amanda Brayden, Amanda Brehe, Amanda Brusk, Amanda Cage, Amanda Carter, Amanda Chaney, Amanda Clarksdale, Amanda Cobb, Amanda Darby, Amanda Deathbird, Amanda Fairmont, Amanda Fallows, Amanda Mueller, Amanda Payne, Amanda Reynolds, Amanda Saint, Amanda Salinger, Amanda Sefton, Amanda Sheridan, Amanda Smith, Amanda von Doom, Amanda Wagner-Parker (Spider-Crawler)\n\nMandy: Mandy Atkinson (Xantippe), Mandy Greville, Mandy O’Connor, Mandy Schuster, Mandy _\n\nMarandi: Marandi “Mandi” Sjorokker (Spindrifter)\n\n32 characters with an Amanda-variant name. Only 1 is live-action, and she’s barely relevant. I feel like this one is another that’s going to get more popular eventually, but for now we don’t have too many, particularly live-action.\n\nMatthew (1981-2001): “gift of God”\n\nMatthew: Matthew “Matt” Axel, Matthew T. Barker, Matthew Beacher (Slyde), Matthew Beere, Matthew Bronleewe, Matthew Caniglia (Kid Justice), Matthew Clinton, Matthew DeRoma (Scrier Junior), Matthew Devon, Matthew Edwards, Matthew Edwards, Matthew Gilden (Goldbug), Matthew Horace Grayson, Matthew Harsh (Able-Bodied Assassin), Matthew Hawk (Two-Gun Kid), Matthew Jenk, Matthew Kearse, Matthew “Matt” Lin, Matthew Lindon, Matthew Malloy, Matthew Masters (Black Rider), Matthew Mitchell (Home Wrecker), Matthew “Matt” Murdock (Daredevil), Matthew “Matt” Murdock II (Bullseye), Matthew Natchios, Matthew Plunder, Matthew Raven, Matthew Risman, Matthew Rogers, Matthew Storm (Firefly), Matthew Surman, Matthew Vaducci, Matthew White, Matthew (Gabriel), Matthew _ (x2)\n\nMatt: Matt Ballors, Matt Carson, Matt Cody, Matt Collins (x2), Matt Corbin (Lightning Bug), Matt Coris (Psylocke), Matt Dowd, Matt Durgan, Matt “Matti” Falcone, Matt Finn (Uproar), Matt Hicksville, Matt Idelson, Matt Landru, Matt McDaver, Matt McKinney (Ripfire), Matt Skinner, Matt Slade (x2), Matt Slade III, Matt Slade Jr., Matt Travers\n\nMatteo: Matteo DiPriggia, Matteo Lolli\n\nMateo: Mateo Caldron, Mateo Corello, Mateo Garza, Mateo Maximoff\n\nMattea: Mattea Murdock (the Daredevil Drummer of Philly)\n\nMattias: Mattias van Scotter\n\nMathias: Mathias Deeds\n\nMathus: Mathus _\n\nMatvey: Matvey Tarasov\n\nMatilda: Matilda Brant, Matilda “Tilda” Maybelline Dillard Johnson, Matilda Drumm, Matilda von Tromp (Tillie the Hun), Matilda _\n\nMathilda: Mathilda Blair\n\nMattie: Mattie Baptiste\n\nMatti: Matti _\n\nMatto: Matto Magneto\n\nMatty: Matty Gunzer\n\n79 characters with Matthew-variant names, only 3 of whom are live-action. Given that Madison (discussed later, in its own section) relates to Matthew somewhat, I think it is completely appropriate to assume that girl!Matt Murdock could have, in fact, been a Madison, and that’s really funny. She could also be a Matilda (that’s, I think, more common a translation) but Madison is sillier.\n\nAshley (1984-1990, 1993-1997): “ash tree clearing”\n\nCovered last week. 17 variants.\n\nBrittany (1989-1991): “from Briton”\n\nBrittany: Brittany Chien (Shuriken), Brittany Hope\n\nBritney: Britney Amber Fox\n\nBrittney: Brittney Williams\n\nBritannia: Tanya (Britannia)\n\nBritannica: Britannica Rex\n\n6 characters with a Brittany-variant name, 2 of which are Britain-derived codenames, none of whom are live-action. This name not being more prevalent genuinely surprises me.\n\nSarah (1993): “lady, princess, noblewoman”\n\nSarah: Sarah Allaire (Papillon), Sarah Baker, Sarah Beckman, Sarah Gail Bradley, Sarah Brawl (Doctor Brawl), Sarah Brundstadt, Sarah Chan, Sarah Clark, Sarah Crawley, Sarah Day, Sarah Dewey, Sarah Fermann, Sarah Garza, Sarah Jessup (Mindstorm), Sarah Kinney, Sarah Klein, Sarah Lieberman, Sarah Lowenstein, Sarah McFarland, Sarah McKens, Old Sarah Mumford, Sarah O’Brien, Sarah Proctor (Dottie Jones), Sarah Purser, Sarah Roderick, Sarah Rogers, Sarah Rogers (Crusader), Sarah Rushman/LeBeau (Marrow), Sarah Ryall (Scanner), Sarah Saulsby, Sarah Shaw, Sarah Silverman, Sarah Slade, Sarah Stacy (Kindred), Sarah Starr (Aviatrix), Sarah Topps, Sarah Townsend, Sarah Vale (Network), Sarah Walks Unseen (Lament), Sarah Wilde, Sarah Wilson, Sarah Wilson, Sarah II (Thinker), Sarah _, Sarah _ (x2)\n\nSara: Sara Bailey, Sara Ehret (Jackpot), Sara Gallows, Sara Grey, Sara Harrington, Sara Heart, Sara Hingle (Nucleus), Sara Krowler (Baroness Mordo), Sara Marfa, Sara Mendez, Sara Pichelli, Sara Pryde, Sara Robbins, Sara Rochelle, Sara Stiggins, Sara Joy Watson, Sara Wolfe, Sara _\n\nSarah Jane: Sarah Jane Harker-Phillips\n\nSara Jane: Sara Jane _ (69)\n\nSera: Sera (the Hunter Queen)\n\nSerah: Serah Anchorton\n\nSerafina: Serafina Montoya, Serafina _\n\n73 characters with a Sarah-variant name, 5 of whom are live-action. This is another one that feels, to me at least, more common than it is; two of them (Sarah Proctor and Sarah Wilson) were introduced almost back-to-back last year, and quite frankly it is egregious to have Steve (the original Captain America) have a mom named Sarah and Sam (the new Captain America) to have a sister named Sarah. There are other names!\n\nEmily (1994-1995, 2009): “rival”\n\nCovered last week. 48 variants.\n\nHannah (1998-2002): “favor, grace”\n\nHannah: Hannah Ballad, Hannah Chung, Hannah Conover, Hannah Donleavy, Hannah Fairmont, Hannah Hochberg, Hannah Hutchins, Hannah Ikegami (Naamurah), Hannah Jones, Hannah Larue, Hannah Pierce, Hannah Stone, Hannah Trumbull (Mercy), Hannah Warner, Hannah _ (Juice), Hannah _, Hangnam Hannah\n\nHanna: Hanna Levy (Lizard Lady), Hanna Riel, Hanna Verschlagen\n\nHana: Hana Jin Rhee, Hana Yanowa, Hana _\n\nHananel: Hananel _\n\nAnna: Anna Ameyama, Anna Anohkin, Anna Beame, Anna Brissom, Anna Brooks, Anna Coye, Anna Marie/a Darkhölme/Raven/Reynolds (Rogue), Anna Donnelly, Anna Fennhoff, Anna Frankenstein, Anna Johnson, Anna Kapplebaum, Anna Kefkin, Anna Makarova Kravinoff, Anna Maria Marconi, Anna Nelson, Anna Nikhail, Anna-May “Annie” Parker (Spiderling), Anna-Marie Rankin, Anna Reynolds, Anna Romanoff, Anna Ryker, Anna Sablinova, Anna Sinclair, Anna Twisdon, A(n)na Watson, Anna Wei, Anna White\n\nAna: Aña “Anya” Sofia Corazon (Araña), Ana Cortés (Lady Deathstrike), Ana Helstrom, Ana Huff, Ana Jarvis, Ana Maximoff, Ana Sofía Arcos Romero, Ana Maria Magdalena Shwartz (Stigmata), Adriana “Ana” Soria (Spider-Queen), Ana _\n\nAnne: Anne Avery, Anne-Marie Baker, Anne Baxter, Anne Benson, Anne Bronson, Anne Burke, Anne Calderstock, Anne Carter, Anne-Marie Cortez, Anne Drake, Anne Garthwaite, Anne Ghazikhanian, Anne Grant, Anne Marie Hoag, Anne Hutchins, Anne Kerry, Anne Marie Menzie, Anne Moore, Anne Seward, Anne Sterns, Anne Tenna, Anne Webster, Anne Wentworth-Bentley, Anne Weaver, Anne Webster, Anne Wentworth-Bentley, Anne Weying, Anne _ (x2); Jemma Anne Simmons\n\nAnn: Ann Beckley, Ann Brennan, Ann Carver, Ann Chi Xan, Ann Darnell (Vapor), Ann Dodgson, Ann Fraley (Auntie Freeze), Ann Herd (Aura), Ann Johnson, Ann Keats, Ann Larsen, Ann Macintosh, Ann Nocenti, Ann Norton, Ann Parker, Ann Peery, Ann Randall, Ann Raymond, Ann Farrow Reynolds, Ann’var\n\nAnnie: Annie Antonelli, Annie Chapman, Annie Christopher, Annie Coleman, Annie Davis, Annie Deacons, Annie Deitz, Annie Hecht, Annie Jameson, Annie Jones, Annie Jones (Kestrel), Annie Lanning, Annie Malcolm, Annie Prazniki, Annie Reilly, Annie Richardson, Annie Simms, Annie Stevenson (Quiver), Annie Wagner (Static Annie), Annie Wheeler (Wide-Load Annie), Annie Wong, Annie Yuan, Annie _ (x3)\n\nAnita: Anita Alomii, Anita Katerine Blake, Anita Dillon, Anita Ehren (Battleaxe), Anita Erskine, Anita Savvy, Anita Trick\n\nAnnika: Annika (Book)\n\nAnielle: Anielle _\n\nAnissa: Anissa Dorsey\n\nAnya: Anya Derevkova (Black Widow), Anya Eisenhardt/Lehnsherr/Magnus, Anya Rasputina, Anya _ (x2)\n\nAnneka: Anneka _\n\nAnnette: Annette Folsom\n\nAntjie: Antjie Qoboza\n\nAnnabel: Annabel Warner\n\nAnnabelle: Annabelle Adams, Annabelle Crawford, Annabelle Riggs, Annabelle St. John\n\nAnabella: Annabella Gorrini\n\nAnnalee: Annalee _\n\n161 characters with a Hannah-variant name, since Anna/e are Hannah variants in and of themselves. Some of the variants (Hana, Antjie) are often Hannah variants but might not be in these cases (given the languages they seem to stem from). It seems like more to me, but only 9 of them have popped up in live-action, although again none of them have been in the “MCU proper” (some from Fox/Sony, some from pre-D+ TV).\n\nSamantha (1998): “name of god,” “flower, blossom”\n\nSamantha: Samantha Bates, Samantha Beere, Samantha Jane Russell Bryant, Samantha Carlisle, Samantha Chan, Samantha “Sammie” Charles, Samantha Cooper, Samantha “Sam” Destine (Argent), Samantha DuPris, Samantha Dunbar (Lancer), Samantha DuPris, Samantha “Sam” Eden, Samantha Farrell (Sapheara), Samantha “Sam(my)” Green, Samantha Joyce, Samantha “Sam” Leary, Samatha McGee (Inferno), Samantha Parrington (Valkyrie), Samantha “Sam” Powell, Samantha Regent, Samantha Reyes, Samantha Sheridan, Samantha Silk, Samantha Summers (Colony), Samantha Twotrees, Samantha White, Samantha T. Wilson (Captain America)\n\nSam: Sam Adams, Sam Bancroft, Sam Barker, Sam Barlow, Sam Beaver, Sam Bender, Sam Biren, Sam Blockbuster, Sam Brady (x2), Sam Bragg, Sam Bullit, Sam Casey (K.C. Ritter), Sam Colby, Sam Collins, Sam Conover, Sam Corbett, Sam Craig, Sam Dunbrow, Sam Dunne, Sam Evans, Sam Exmore, Sam Farrow, Sam Felix, Sam Fisher, Sam Fogler, Sam Galvagno, Sam Garr, Sam Geller, Sam Gladhand, Sam Gleason, Sam Graham, Sam Grandee (the Grip), Sam Hale, Sam Hanson (Guardsman), Sam Hawk (Manhunter), Sam Henderson, Sam Hicks, Sam Hooker, Sam Jagger, Sam Jaggers, Sam Jessup, Sam Jordan, Sam Jory, Sam Jutter, Sam Kemperer, Sam Kimball, Sam Klaw, Sam Klein, Sam Koenig, Sam Kolawetz, Sam Krieger, Sam Kurokawa, Sam Labowe, Sam Landers, Sam Langhorn, Sam Larup, Sam Lawson (x2), Sam Lee, Sam Lincoln, Sam Marvin, Sam Matonabbe (Oxbow), Sam Mellon, Sam Melville, Sam Miller, Big Sam Morgan, Sam Murdock, Sam Palmer, Sam Parkin (Giant-Sam), Sam Peabody, Sam Peaks, Sam Pritchard, Sam Randel, Sam Rayburn, Sam Reilly, Sam Reuther, Sam Roberts, Sam Ross (Loadmaster), Sam Saber, Sam Savage, Sam Scorpio (Scorpion), Sam Scully, Sam Silvercloud, Sad Sam Simms, Sam Stone, Sam Stout, Sam Striker, Sam Taylor, Sam Thorne, Sam Venuti, Sam Westman, Sam Whitehall, Sam Whitney, Sam “Yakkety” Yates, Sam Yurimoto (Thermite), Sam 13 (Falcon), Sam the Clam, S.A.M., Sam the cat, Sam the robot, Sam _ (x2)\n\nSammy: Sammy Binion, Sammy Bruno, Sammy Cohen, Sammy Rico, Sammy Skalek (the Smiler), Sammy Stone (Memento), Sammy (Crime Master), Sammy the dog, Sammy _, Second-Story Sammy\n\nSamuel: Samuel “Sam” Alexander (Nova), Samuel David Barone (Black Talon), Samuel Bernstein, Samuel Brady, Samuel Burley, Samuel Caulkin (Ramshot), Samuel “Sam” Chung (Blindspot), Samuel “Scoop” Daly, Samuel Donaldson, Samuel Douglas, Samuel “Sam” Fisk (Daredevil), Samuel Fox (Scrier), Samuel Griggs, Samuel “Sam” Zachery Guthrie (Cannonball), Samuel “Sam” Higgins, Samuel “Sam” Holden, Samuel Kamerhe (Sledge/Templar), Samuel Kingston, Samuel John LaRoquette (Rock), Samuel Lyons, Samuel “Mother” Majowski, Samuel “Sam” Makoa, Samuel Merrick, Samuel N’Dingi (Maliki Uhuru), Samuel “Sam/S.J.” North, Samuel Owlsley, Samuel “Sammy” Luc Paré (Squid-Boy), Samuel “Sam” Ryan, Samuel J. Sampat, Samuel Sanchez, Samuel “Sam” Sawyer (Happy Sam), Samuel Saxon (Machinesmith), Samuel “Sammy” Silke, Samuel “Sam(my)” Silke Jr., Samuel J. Skrull, Samuel “Sam” Simon, Samuel “Sammy” Smith (the Rev), Samuel “Sam” Smithers (Plantman), Samuel “Sam” Stein, Samuel Sterns (the Leader), Samuel “Buggy” Stokes, Samuel “Mike/Sam” Sykes, Samuel Tate, Samuel “Sam” T. Underwood, Samuel “Sam” Voss, Samuel “Sam” Wantling, Samuel Waxman, Samuel “Sam” Weltschmerz (Slippery Sam), Samuel “Sam” Wilson (Falcon/Captain America), Samuel Wintergreen, Samuel _\n\nSamuels: Samuels _\n\nSammi: Sammi Bobby\n\nSami: Sami Nadeem\n\nSamsbury: Samsbury “Sam” Winthrow (Slippery Sam)\n\n195 characters with a Samuel-variant name, since Samantha is a Samuel variant. There are 17 of these in live-action projects, and that’s probably enough for now.\n\nAlexis (1999): “helper,” “defender”\n\nAlexis: Alexis Denson, Alexis Miranda, Alexis Primo, Alexis Sauvage, Alexis the Duck, Alexis the Protector, Captain Alexis\n\nAlexus: Alexus _\n\nLexi: Lexi Raymond, Lexi the gladiator\n\nLexii: Lexii _\n\nLexus:\n\n12 characters with an Alexis-variant name, 1 of whom is live-action. Alexis and Alexander/ra share definitions, but they’re not derived from the same name in a technical sense. I’m just cataloging specifically Alexis variants here.\n\nMadison (2000-2006): “son of Matthew/Maud (which in turn derives from Matilda, meaning ‘strength in battle’)”\n\nMadison: Madison Jeffries (Gemini), Madison “Maddy” Stanton, Madison Warner\n\nMaddy: Madame Curie “Maddy” Cho, Maddy Pryor\n\nMaddie: Maddie _\n\nMadisynn: Madisynn King\n\n7 characters with a Madison-variant name, and at least one of the Maddys explicitly isn’t a Madison (but I’m still listing her). This is honestly a surprise, given Madison’s early 2000s popularity. Maybe there will be more Madisons to come. ETA: Sure enough, Madisynn has appeared on She-Hulk, so here she is! See also: the Matthew variants.\n\nJoshua (2002-2006): “God is salvation”\n\nJoshua: Joshua Anders, Joshua Ayers (Miracle Man), Joshua Blaine (Robin Hood), Joshua Carstairs, Joshua Coolridge, Joshua Coop, Joshua “Josh” Cooper, Joshua Costain, Joshua Crow, Joshua Crown, Joshua Dozer, Joshua “Josh” Engelhard (Jersey Devil), Joshua Exhcol, Joshua Farkas (Dimensional Man), Joshua Foley (Elixir), Joshua Ford, Joshua Fromeyer (Scud), Joshua Grimly (Destroyer of Demons), Joshua “Jay/Josh” Zachariah Guthrie (Icarus), Joshua Huntingcut, Joshua Itobo, Joshua Jensen, Joshua Kale, Joshua Kane, Joshua Lambert, Joshua Lanning, Joshua Link (Gemini), Joshua McMahan (Nightvoid), Joshua Mendossi, Joshua N’Dingi (Doctor Crocodile), Joshua Pryce, Joshua Raven (Deathraven), Joshua “Josh” Richardson (Discord), Joshua Stragg (the Reaver), Joshua Summers (Chaos), Joshua Tark, Joshua Trent, Joshua Utler, Joshua Waldemeyer (Wall), Joshua Walker, Joshua “Josh” Williams, Joshua Wirtham, Joshua _ (x2)\n\nJosh: Josh Alfaro, Josh Arndt, Josh Atwater (Nova), Josh Collins, Josh Glenn (Hate-Monger), Josh Hartman, Josh Kittling, Josh Lanning, Josh Mundy (Phantom), Josh Nixon, Josh _\n\n54 characters with a Joshua-variant name. None of the 3 live-action Joshuas hail from the MCU proper, so we’re probably overdue.\n\nEmma (2003-2007, 2009-2013, 2019-2021): “whole,” “universal”\n\nCovered last week. 39 variants.\n\nEthan (2008-2010, 2012): “solid, enduring, firm”\n\nEthan: Ethan Crane, Ethan Domblue (Sin-Eater), Ethan Edwards (Virtue), Ethan Myers, Ethan Shield (Galahad), Ethan Slaughter, Ethan Stoddard, Ethan R. Thurm, Ethan G. Warren, Ethan Wilford, Ethan _\n\n11 characters named Ethan, none of whom are live-action. We could stand to have more Ethans by that logic.\n\nIsabella (2008, 2011-2012): “my God is an oath”\n\nCovered last week. 48 variants.\n\nOlivia (2009, 2013-2019), Oliver (2019-2021) : “olive” (the latter also means “ancestor’s descendant”)\n\nCovered last week. 32 variants.\n\nSophia (2010, 2014-2015): “wisdom”\n\nCovered last week. 23 variants.\n\nWilliam (2011, 2016-2017), Liam (2013-2016): “will helmet”\n\nCovered last week. 344 variants.\n\nMason (2011-2012, 2014-2015): “stoneworker”\n\nMason: Mason Eckhart, Mason Edwards, Mason Harding, Mason Hollis (Crime-Wave), Mason Kaleema (the Traveler), Rick Mason (who goes by his surname), Mason Sackett, Mason Wilhite, Mason (Masked Maverick)\n\n9 characters named Mason, 2 live-action. Not much to say here. It’s a pretty-recently popular name, so its lack of commonness makes sense.\n\nAva (2016-2020): “to breathe,” “to live” (or “voice, sound” or “desired”)\n\nAva: Ava Ayala (White Tiger), Ava Cochrane, Ava’Dara Naganandini (Warbird), Ava Anatalya Orlova (Red Widow), Ava Peloso (Ambush), Ava Starr (Ghost), Ava (Captain America), Ava _\n\nEva: Eva Alexander, Eva Bell (Tempus), Eva Belyakov, Eva Krauss, Eva Lysenkovitch (Sickle), Eva Quintero, Eva Slougart, E.V.A., Eva _ (x2)\n\nEve: Eve Bakian (Nova), Eve Greenwood Prado, Eve Manning, Eve X, Eve 3,031, Eve the synthezoid, Eve-3031, Dr. Eve _, Princess Eve _, Eve _ (x2)\n\nEvie: Evie Blake\n\nEvelyn: Evelyn Crawford, Evelyn Cream, Evelyn Foley, Evelyn Hawley, Evelyn Morris, Evelyn “Eve” Necker, Evelyn Richards-Foley, Evelyn Stanzler, Evelyn _ (X-Cow)\n\nEvangelina: Evangelina Rivera\n\nEvangeline: Evangeline “Angie” Cryer, Evangeline “Vange” Whedon\n\nEvanora: Evanora Harkness\n\nEvita: Evita Fusilier\n\n44 characters with an Ava-variant name. 5 are live-action. This includes variants of Eve as well as variants of Avaline, since Ava can derive from either (or the Persian option, the one meaning “voice, sound” – I choose to believe that SHIELD Ava is that version of Ava, since it’s ironic, because of the fucked-up hearing deprivation stuff).\n\nNoah (2017-2021): “rest, repose”\n\nCovered last week. 17 variants.\n\nCharlotte (2021): “free man”\n\nCharlotte: Charlotte Yolanda “Charly” Beck (Friction), Charlotte Christopher, Charlotte Cromwell, Charlotte “Charlie” Hastert, Charlotte Jones, Charlotte Samantha Morales-Stacy (Spider-Girl), Charlotte Webber (Sun-Spider), Charlotte Witter (Spider-Woman), Charlotte _\n\nChar: Char _\n\nCharles: Charles Christopher Aldiss, Charles Amundson (Glitch), Charles Anderson, Charles Atkins, Charles Barber, Charles “Chuck” Barnabus, Charles Bernard “Barney” Barton (Trickshot), Charles Baskerville, Charles Bates, Charles Beacham, Charles Beckman, Charles Beecher, Charles Bentley, Charles Benton (Asmodeus), Charles Blackwater (Omen), Charles Bohusk, Charles Bolton (Black Bart), Charles Boroughs, Charles Brent, Charles Brown, Charles Buchanan (Crook-Man), Charles “Charlie” Burlingame (Charcoal), Charles Burton, Charles Cameo, Charles Casey, Charles Chandler (3-D Man), Charles “Cherry” Chewatt, Charles Chozzles, Charles Clemmens, Charles Cooley, Charles Cotta, Charles J.

That’s easy, since there are a lot of those. This is our other winner, hence Carol.\n\nAlso, here are a couple of articles I’m really proud of: one about how the TV show screwed Trish over and one about Baymax, Paper Girls, and Turning Red discussing periods.\n\nMarvel Comics burst onto the scene in 1939, and since then, they’ve been recycling names. Originally I was going to look at the howevermany most popular names of 1970 (since that’s a nice distance between 1939 and 2022, I figured) but then I thought… maybe I’d look at the most popular names in the US of every year between 1939 and now.\n\nAnd list how many Marvel characters (comics or cinematic; characters with cinematic incarnations are italicized) have those names, or variants of those names, or names that could have the same nicknames, or etc. etc. Or, well, how many Marvel characters have those names that show up in the first page of a search on the Marvel wiki, because I’m not going to go through 20+ pages of links when I’m already going through 83 years of names. Occasionally I remember another character who fits but isn’t on the first page of results, and they’re in there too.\n\nI’m probably going to look into more of these, it’s very interesting to me even though it’s largely just lists.\n\nEdit: I’ve gone back and looked at the character list on the wiki for complete totals. Of note: I am not including real-life figures who just appear momentarily (i.e. real-life newscasters or political figures) but I am including real-life figures who appear in the plot significantly (i.e. AUs or when writers write themselves in as characters that affect the plot). I’m also not including any of the animal pun names or dumb parody names from the What The -?! stories.\n\nRobert (1939, 1953): “bright fame”\n\nRobert: Robert Abbey, Robert “Bobby” Andrews (H-Beta), Robert Arnold, Robert B., Robert Baldwin (Speedball), Robert Barnes, Robert Wayne “Rob” Bartlett, Robert Baxter (Mad-Dog), Robert Bell, Robert Benson, Robert Bentley, Robert Bethell, Robert “Bobby” Blackthorne (Vengeance), Robert Blake, Robert Brasman (Brass Bishop), Robert “Bobby” Bronson, Robert Brooks, Robert Bruce (the Banner), Robert Burchill (Awesome Android), Robert Callaghan (Yokai), Robert Callahan, Robert Campbell (Prototype), Robert “Bobby” Carr, Robert “Bobby” Carter, Robert C.
