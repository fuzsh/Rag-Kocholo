        "text": "SOUNDTRACK:\n\n[READ: January 4, 2024] “Who Will Fight with Me?”\n\nRivka Galchen was one of the writers whose essays and stories in the New Yorker I made sure that I read. This essay is a non-fiction piece about her father.\n\nI enjoyed the very first line:\n\nRecovering from a happy childhood can take a long time.\n\nIt made me think about how we seem to glamorize hard upbringing–college essays are based on overcoming hardship. People love to complain about their parents and how tough they had it as kids. But isn’t it wonderful to have had a happy childhood? Isn’t that what parents strive to give their children?\n\nI had a happy childhood and I am nothing but grateful for it. (more…)\n\nRead Full Post »\n\n[READ: May 2022] Inked\n\nI loved this book of cartoons from Joe Dator. I can’t say that I recognize his style especially, but his cartoons did look very New Yorker to me.\n\nIndeed, this book features dozens of comics. It’s not always obvious which ones were accepted and which were rejected (although he does mention some that were rejected specifically).\n\nHe talks bout the state of mind of the New Yorker artists: On a very good week, they will buy one of your cartoons for publication. Most weeks they will not buy one. It’s a little bit like having a job at which every week you get fired then you have to go in next week to re-apply and hope you get hired back.\n\nHe has a few sections called Betwixt the Punchlines in which he explains the motivation behind a particular piece (He says the one where the coffee maker says she’ll come back, she always comes back (while he’s using a French press) is from his own habit of buying gadgets but always returning to old faithful.\n\nI rather enjoyed the picture of the army man with medals on his chest who say “Anytime I’ve even been asked ‘What do you want. a medal?’ I’ve said yes.”\n\nHe also talks bout his drawings of God.\n\nGod is about 7’1″ You might think that seems kind of small for the Supreme Being, but its just big enough to make the average mortal say “Wow, that’s a big guy.” God knows people are easily impressed.

It’s the solo project of Wye Oak’s Jenn Wasner (I thought Wye Oak was a solo project as well–no, it’s a duo). [Gee, why wasn’t Andy Stack invited to this sing along?]\n\nFor this Home Concert, the solo project turns huge with nine people sitting around having a big ol’ sing along (I’ll assume they are all vaccinated and that this was filmed before Delta took off).\n\nThe setup is pretty simple: three guitars (I love that the guys on the couch are lefty (Michael Libramento, baritone guitar) and righty (Alan Good Parker, tenor guitar) so it looks appealingly symmetrical). some percussion and a lot of voices (the men on the right of the screen seems somewhat less invested).\n\nThe friends who are singing along include the three singers from Mountain Man: Amelia Randall Meath, Molly Sarlé and Alexandra Sauser-Monnig. Meath is also in Sylvan Esso and her bandmate Nick Sanborn is also present (he’s one of the less invested men). The set is filmed at Sylvan Esso’s new studio in Durham, N.C., called Betty’s.\n\n“Two” is a bouncy number with lots of percussion. I like the way the backing singers join in from time to time, but not constantly–it introduces new voices throughout.\n\nOne of the invested men is percussionist Matthew McCaughan from Bon Iver–he’s got a full complement of instruments at hand. Joe Westerland (from Megafaun) is the other percussionist, he’s just a bit more subtle in his actions, but you can see him gently tapping through “Two.”\n\n“Price of Blue” is a little slower but it has a wonderful melody. The harmonies really standout on this song.\n\nI don’t know the originals of these songs, but I have to assume the blurb is correct\n\nThese acoustic performances actually shed new light, thanks to radiant and radically different arrangements, while fully capturing the warmth we look for from Tiny Desk concerts.\n\nWhatever the case, the backing vocals are tremendous. You can really hear Molly Sarlé’s gorgeous harmony vocals.\n\n“Awake For The Sunrise” feels like an old fashioned fire side sing along. I’ve enjoyed Wye Oak’s music but I don’t know it very well. I rather like Wassner’s delivery here–but i feel like these songs might not be as good without these harmonies!\n\n[READ: August 12, 2021] New Teeth\n\nI’m guessing that Simon Rich had a baby.\n\nThis collection of stories is loaded with stories about little kids. And that’s all right because he has a very funny take on being a parent.\n\nThe other stories tackle the corporate environment and are full of fish-out-of-water stories.\n\n“Learning the Ropes” is about being a new parent. But it is written from the point of view of two pirates. And hilarity ensues.\n\nWhat’s odd to me is that in his first books, his stories were really short, but I feel like lately his stories have gotten much longer–sometimes too long. This one in particular kind of dragged at times, because it’s pretty much a one-note joke: what? pirates raising a little girl?! One pirate is a concerned parent which means he wants them both to care about the child. It’s got a few very funny moments, and of course, when the pirates who speak in pirate style (“The only man I trust is me first mate”) say things like “Arr… it be called ‘limit testing.’ She be acting out because she be craving discipline,” well, that’s classic Simon Rich right there.

For this Tiny Desk (Home) Concert it’s just him and his guitars. But the blurb suggests the album these songs are from is quite different.\n\nHaving spent time with Collections from the Whiteout, Ben Howard’s sonically adventurous fourth album, I was curious to see how he would adapt these songs to the Tiny Desk (home) concert format. So when the opening shot shows Ben in a room alone, an acoustic guitar in hand, it was both an “oh yeah!” and an “uh-oh” moment. Gone were all those textures that he, Aaron Dessner, and a load of talented musicians had worked on, but front and center was that delicate, reflective voice that I love. It’s a voice that, in the recent past, was often swarming in effects and buried in reverb.\n\nBen plays four songs. The first, “Follies Fixtures” is on acoustic guitar.\n\nSo as Ben Howard opens his Tiny Desk with the album’s opening track, I found myself zeroing in on the oblique and painterly images of “Follies Fixtures”: “Walk with me to the burning spire. / We can count the dеad on Ender’s pyre. / The dusty towns whеre the number’s found / Don’t quite match the missing.”\n\nThis song reminds me of Jose Gonzales in this format.\n\nHoward then switches to electric guitar for the rest of the songs. He adds drum machine for “Far Out.”\n\n“Thanks for having me and allowing me to play the slight variations of songs that I’m forced to settle with at the moment,” Ben says, and with that he kicks on the drum machine …. Watch those fingers on the guitar and hear that tone. “Far Out,” indeed.\n\nHis guitar playing is really something in this song, with soft chords and lot so harmonics as well as great use of the low note riffage in between.\n\n“I I Forget Where We Were” is a moody song–he creates soft chords that swell as he sings.\n\nHe later premieres a new tune, “Oldest Trick In The Book.”\n\nHe laughs saying he just spent the last ten minutes tuning his guitar so we’ll be happy to know he’s in tune.\n\nThis song is the slowest with some really deep resonating bass notes (and no drum machine). It’s fun watching hi play a solo and low notes at the same time with his finger picking style.\n\n[READ: July 15, 2021] “Bear Meat”\n\nThis very short story was translated from the Italian by Alessandra Bastagli.\n\nIt begins with the comment that spending evenings in a mountain hut after a four- five- or six hour climb is pretty wonderful. The people you find there don’t speak much. But these clumbers should not be confused with the ones who do speak a lot–hot shot clumbers, extreme climbers. The adventurers may be worthy but this story is not about them.\n\nThe narrator arrived and there were several men there–eating and drinking. Once the wine began flowing (at that altitude and temperature it is a metabolic necessity) they began talking about their initiation into serious climbing.

We want to turn despair and frustration into innovation and positivity, and invite everyone to a digital festival experience out of the ordinary – right home in your own living room.\n\nAurora played a 45 minute home concert for Verftet which you can see online.\n\nThe show starts with her at the piano (an unusual sight), playing the lovely ballad “Animal Soul.” Then the drums start and Aurora and her band play a fantastic cover of the Massive Attack/Liz Frasier song “Teardrop.” It sounds pretty cool on piano and even though Liz Frasier’s voice is unique in the world Aurora sounds terrific.\n\n“Warrior” sounds very different from the recorded version, because it’s still rather quiet (although louder than the other songs). Silja Sol has taken over piano and sings absolutely gorgeous harmonies. Hearing the song stripped down shows what a powerful song it i\n\n“All Is Soft Inside” opens with quiet echoing guitars and features more great backing vocals from Silja. Although when Aurora sings a capella for a few beats it shows how great her voice is. This song is really terrific.\n\nThen she says something very Aurora: “I’m itching on my bum but I don’t want to do it on camera, can you just film Magnus while I scratch my butt.”\n\nFollowed by some sage advice for pandemic times: “Its okay to be worthless, no not worthless, unproductive… we don’t have to do more than just exist sometimes.”\n\n“Through The Eyes Of A Child” is a beautiful with just her and Silja on the piano. The a capella verse with the deep and high harmonies sounds wonderful. The song builds with the rest of the musicians adding in the guitar and drums.\n\n“The River” grows bigger but is still restrained. As is “Queendom,” her huge dance hit. But even in this stripped down very it is still catchy and super fun.\n\n“The Seed” is a wonderfully dark and powerful song. For this quiet version, Silja plays quiet echoing guitar and the song builds into an intense climax (which is still quite restrained compared to the original). But we can’t overlook the deep vocals from Magnus on the drums.\n\nThe set ends with a beautiful cover of The Beatles’ “Across The Universe” a song that will “take us away, a dreamy song… a perfect world… a beautiful hippie paradise.” It’s a lovely gentle cover with amazing harmonies from Silja.\n\n[READ: July 20, 2021] “After the Movie”\n\nThis is a very dark story. It’s about Ed, a writer and filmmaker whose recent books have flopped.\n\nHe and his wife had just come back from the movies and his mood was foul. He went to bed without saying good night to the kids. Instead of falling asleep, he found himself sitting up and crying,\n\nHe genuinely considered killing himself. He had no money coming in, they had borrowed against the house. They had nothing left. He was nothing,\n\nMuldoon had called him this afternoon from Amsterdam.\n\nEd sat in bed and remembered back to when he was trying to perk up his friend Muldoon who was then having a similar slump. Ed encouraged him to hang in there. And look at Muldoon now.

We want to turn despair and frustration into innovation and positivity, and invite everyone to a digital festival experience out of the ordinary – right home in your own living room.\n\nI was completely unfamiliar with Iris, but she was the only other singer whose set was still streaming. Because Aurora is a Norwegian singer in the same range, I feel like Iris’ voice sounds similar to hers. But that’s a lazy comparison.\n\nI suspect that she is a bit more poppy than this set lets on. Like the Silja Sol set, it feels like a more “unplugged” kind of show.\n\nIt opens with “crawl for me” with she her singing to a guitar. It’s quiet and powerful. The rest of the band comes out for “mercy” which is “how i would like to to not show me any.” There are washes of guitar s and keys, including a very cool, almost sinister keyboard sound in the end.\n\nA cellist arrives for “kroppsspråk” which is a cover of a Lars Vaular song. It’s kind of rapped–but in Iris’s more singing way. It seems like the original is very dancey and she has dialed it back.\n\nAfter a gentle piano solo version of “giving in” (her voice is lovely in the spare setting), she played “from inside a car,” my favorite song of the set which has a breathy quality that I really like.\n\nThen she throws in a Beatles cover. “Here, There and Everywhere” is a beautiful gentle cover with just her voice and an acoustic guitar.\n\n“hidden springs” stays with the acoustic sound, but she moved to a more techie processed vocal for “your mind, the universe.” She has a few technical glitches for this song but when they are resolved her voice sounds very cool as it starts and then turns into a much bigger song.\n\nAs they prepare the next song she jokes that you shouldn’t eat crackers in bed, which proves to be the opening line of “hanging around you/crackers,” a sweet sounding breakup song.\n\nBefore the final song she mentions that all of her band is wearing band T-shirts: Iron Maiden, Metallica, Kiss and um, Reservoir Dogs(?). It’s an amusing look for such a gentle show.\n\nBefore starting “romance is dead” she encourages everyone to visit my You Tube channel for recipes. This set ending song is soft and lovely, just piano and strings and her beautiful voice.\n\n[READ: July 15, 2021] “Road Trips”\n\nWhen David was a kid, his father rallied the families on their street in Raleigh to plant maple trees. For years they were tiny, pathetic things. Now, decades later they are tall and majestic creating a canopy down the street where his father still lives.\n\nHe was home visiting his father who brought him to a block party. At the party a teenager saw David’s father and groaned “Lou Sedaris, who invited her?”\n\n“My son is gay,” the boy’s mother announced as if none of us had figured this out yet. David was blown away that someone could casually announce this on the street where he grew up. As a young homosexual David played all the games that the other closeted kids did. Dated girls and claimed that sex before marriage was what dogs did–a true union of soles could take eight to ten years!\n\nHe kept his secret until he was twenty. But he would have kept it longer had a couple not picked him up when he was hitchhiking. It was 1 AM and he was picked up by a Cadillac with people his parents’ age in it.
