        "text": "Growing up with my Nana soap operas were a mainstay of her household. Like clockwork, Monday through Friday she watched “All My Children” at one o clock, “One Life To Live” at two, and then at three, “General Hospital.” For years I never understood her fascination with them. In my opinion characters like “Erica Kane,” had no real world value. Even more importantly how could a teenage boy such as me relate to all this gushy romance. Then one day, as I lay propped up, sick and half dead, “Passions,” came on. Initially I wrote it off as just another soap opera, but then I noticed two unusual characters–a witch and a talking doll! I found myself engrossed in the show’s supernatural storylines and found myself greatly enamored with Theresa Lopez-Fitzgerald. As the show’s main heroine she fought for, and won, the love of Ethan Winthrop. Then there was Alistair Crane–a television villain so evil he puts J.R. Ewing to shame! The show also launched the careers of heart throbs like Justin Hartley and Jesse Metcalfe, and introduced us to Eva Tamargo.\n\nApparently I wasn’t the only guy addicted to the show as it had a high male fan base and sparked a cult following! The show routinely appeared on VH -1’s “The Best Week Ever,” and became a pop culture phenomenon. For nine seasons audiences laughed, cried, hoped for, and fell for the citizens of the seldom harmonious town of “Harmony.” Still, there was a lesson behind the show; a happy life has to be fought for and vigilantly defended. As much as you would like to think things will work themselves out you alone hold the power to achieve that outcome! Cheers to “Passions!”"
