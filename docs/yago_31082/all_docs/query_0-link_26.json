But Miguel only has eyes for Kay's cousin, Charity Standish, a girl who possesses special powers of goodness. When Charity came to Harmony, and moved into the Bennett house, Kay's fury was unleashed!\n\nKay's anger against her cousin intensified once Miguel admitted he would have loved Kay if Charity hadn't come to town. In fact, Miguel's revelation made Kay fight harder. Kay proved she'd do anything to win the man she loves-including sell her soul! After Kay sold her soul, she did nothing to help when Charity was sucked into the flames of hell.\n\nKay now has her soul back, but she's still plotting to steal Miguel's heart. Even though Kay doesn't know it, she has more than determination on her side-she also has witch Tabitha (and Tabitha's not-so-willing accomplice, Timmy)!\n\nTabitha knows that if Charity and Miguel's love is consummated, Charity will come into her full powers of goodness....and Tabitha will be destroyed. As a result, Tabitha will stop at nothing to help Kay get Miguel! In order to help Kay, Tabitha made sure Kay got her hands on a spell book called \"Spells of Pain.\" Kay is determined to use the book to break up Miguel and Charity for good. After a doomed wedding, soulmates Luis Lopez-Fitzgerald and Sheridan Crane decided to go ahead with their honeymoon. The two had the time of their lives on a romantic vacation in Bermuda. But Sheridan's family had plans other than romance for the duo. Sheridan's father, Alistair, is determined to keep cop Luis away from the Crane family secrets. To accomplish this, he is willing to sacrifice his own daughter. Alistair ordered his son, Julian, to plant a bomb aboard Sheridan and Luis' boat! Luis managed to survive the explosion, but he couldn't find Sheridan anywhere! While a hurricane raged at sea, Luis searched and searched-but was unable to find his true love.\n\nBack at the Bermuda hotel, a dead body was recovered from the sea. Luis was devastated when dental records proved that it was indeed Sheridan. Luis has no idea how he will go on without his true love. Unbeknownst to Luis, Sheridan is alive and has been rescued by a fisherman named Brian. Luis headed back to Harmony with a heavy heart but unbeknownst to him, Sheridan was really alive and lost at sea! The unconscious Sheridan was rescued by a fisherman named Brian, who fell in love at first sight with the beautiful woman. Brian brought Sheridan back to the island where he lives with his friends, Liz and Doc. When Sheridan finally woke up, she was unable to remember her identity or her past.\n\nNow, the only thing she remembers is the face of the man she loves. Unfortunately, Sheridan mistakenly believes that the man she loves is dead! As she struggles to remember more, Brian has been standing by Sheridan's side. Brian is trying to help Sheridan move on with her life since his feelings for her grow stronger with each day. Street-kid Chad Harris came to Harmony searching for his parents, and immediately caught the eye of feisty teenager Simone Russell. But Chad fell for Simone's sister, champion tennis player, Whitney...and despite her initial reluctance, Whitney began to fall for Chad.\n\nWhile injured, a delirious Chad proclaimed his love for Whitney, but Simone believed his statement was meant for her! From that point on, Simone believed Chad was her boyfriend.\n\nMeanwhile, Whitney and Chad continued to grow closer as Chad searched for his birth parents. Neither of them knew that Chad's search could wind up splitting them apart forever. Whitney's mother, Eve, believed there was a chance that Chad could be the son she always thought died at birth! The DNA tests proved otherwise because evil Alistair Crane tampered with the results. Even though Eve breathed a sigh of relief, Chad and Whitney are not out of the woods-the identity of Chad's mother is still unclear.\n\nAfter Chad and Whitney declared their love, they were all set to tell Simone the truth. But before they could, Simone spied the two kissing-and as a result, ran into the street and was hit by a car! As Simone lay unconscious, Whitney promised her sister, and God, that if Simone lived, Whitney would give up Chad forever.\n\nSimone survived and has no recollection of her sister's promise, but Whitney is determined to keep her wordï¿½despite Chad's insistence that he and Whitney belong together. Theresa Lopez Fitzgerald's dream came true when Ethan Crane declared his love for her and broke his engagement to his childhood sweetheart, socialite Gwen Hotchkiss. Gwen was furious when Ethan dumped her and vowed revenge. Gwen and her devious mother, Rebecca, hatched a scheme which exposed Ethan's true paternity-he wasn't really a Crane, but the son of Ivy Winthrop Crane and Sam Bennett. Gwen and Rebecca arranged for Theresa to take the fall for their devious deeds!\n\nTo set things right for Ethan, Theresa flew to Bermuda where Ethan's ex-father, Julian, was getting a divorce from Ivy. Theresa was determined to convince Julian to take Ethan back into the family. But the two drank too much and woke up the next morning-as Mr. and Mrs. Julian Crane! Theresa was determined to keep her marriage to Julian a secret. But the truth came out when Ivy got her hands on a copy of the marriage certificate. Ivy exposed the truth and Ethan's life was turned upside down.\n\nEthan decided to forgive Theresa, but on one condition--that there are no more lies between them. Unfortunately, Theresa is keeping one more big secret--she slept with Julian when they were \"married\" and is now pregnant with Julian's baby! Meanwhile, Julian's money-hungry fiancï¿½e, Rebecca, has not given up her claims on Julian. She's as determined to get her hands on his money as ever!"
