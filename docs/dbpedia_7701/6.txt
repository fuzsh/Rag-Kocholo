Don Miguel Ruiz is a Mexican author and spiritual teacher who has gained worldwide recognition through his books, talks, and teachings. His most famous book, The Four Agreements, has sold millions of copies and has been translated into over thirty languages.

The Four Agreements is a practical guide to personal freedom and transformation. It is based on Toltec wisdom, which is an ancient spiritual tradition of the Mesoamerican people. The teachings are simple, yet profound, and they offer a way to break free from limiting beliefs and self-imposed suffering.

The Four Agreements are:

1. Be impeccable with your word.

2. Don`t take anything personally.

3. Don`t make assumptions.

4. Always do your best.

Let`s take a closer look at each of these agreements and what they mean.

1. Be impeccable with your word.

This agreement is about speaking with integrity and saying only what you mean. It means avoiding gossip, lies, and harmful language. When you are impeccable with your word, you build trust and respect with others, and you avoid creating unnecessary drama and conflict.

2. Don`t take anything personally.

This agreement is about not allowing other people`s actions or words to affect you personally. We all have our own unique perspectives and experiences, and it`s important to remember that everyone else does too. When you don`t take things personally, you can maintain a sense of inner peace and avoid unnecessary suffering.

3. Don`t make assumptions.

This agreement is about not making assumptions about other people`s thoughts, feelings, or intentions. Instead, it encourages us to ask questions and seek understanding. When we assume things about others, we often create misunderstandings and conflicts.

4. Always do your best.

This agreement is about giving your best effort in everything you do. It`s not about perfection, but about striving to do your best in any given moment. When you do your best, you can avoid self-judgment and regret, and you can feel proud of your efforts.

Overall, The Four Agreements offers a simple, yet profound path to personal transformation. By embracing these agreements, we can break free from limiting beliefs and self-imposed suffering, and we can create a more peaceful and fulfilling life.
