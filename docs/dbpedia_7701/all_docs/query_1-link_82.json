        "text": "Don Miguel\n\nRuiz\n\nDon Miguel Ruiz is the international bestselling author of The Voice of Knowledge, The Mastery of Love, The Four Agreements (a New York Times bestseller for over seven years), and The Fifth Agreement co-authored with his son, don Jose.\n\nBorn into a family of healers in rural Mexico, Ruiz was chosen to carry forward his family’s centuries-old legacy of Toltec wisdom and healing. Instead, distracted by modern life, Ruiz chose to attend medical school and become a surgeon.\n\nLate in the 1970s, a near-death experience changed his life and Ruiz decided to devote himself to mastering the wisdom of the ancient Toltec. To this day, he continues to share these teachings in lectures and journeys to sacred sites around the world.\n\nRuiz is widely known for transforming complex human issues into simple common sense — a talent which has earned him millions of fans, international acclaim, and a vote of approval from Oprah Winfrey. Sales of his Toltec Wisdom books have soared to more than 7 million copies in the United States alone, and have been translated into more than 30 languages worldwide."
