        "text": "MP3 Download\n\nToltecs were known throughout southern Mexico as spiritual scientists and artists who explored esoteric knowledge and practices. Teotihuacan, an ancient city of pyramids outside Mexico City, was the center of Toltec civilization. The misuse of personal power by apprentices caused their ancestral wisdom to be concealed for centuries, but ancient prophecies foretold the emergence of the Sixth Sun, a time when Toltec wisdom would be returned to the people. Don Miguel Ruiz explores modern meaning of Toltec teachings, showing the way to personal freedom and spiritual empowerment. \"Life is nothing but a dream but that dream is alive; you are creating that dream, and that dream working for you is pure magic.\" (hosted by Michael Toms)\n\nBio\n\nDon Miguel Ruiz is a renowned and most beloved spiritual teacher dedicated to sharing wisdom and love through practical concepts in order to promote transformation and ultimately change lives for the better. Heâ€™s the youngest of 13 children, born in rural Mexico to parents who were healers and practitioners of ancient Toltec traditions. As a young adult, he graduated from medical school and practiced neurosurgery until a near-fatal car crash forever changed the direction of his life. Since then, he consistently delivers the deepest truths in the most relevant ways.\n\nDon Miguel Ruiz is the author of many books including:\n\nThe Four Agreements: A Practical Guide to Personal Freedom (Amber-Allen Publishing 1997)\n\nThe Fifth Agreement: A Practical Guide to Self-Mastery (Amber-Allan 2011), which is presented in collaboration with his son, don Jose Ruiz\n\nThe Toltec Art of Life and Death: A Story of Discovery (co-author Barbara Emerys) (HarperOne 2015)\n\nTo learn more about the work of don Miguel Ruiz go to www.miguelruiz.com.\n\nTopics Explored in This Dialogue\n\nHow to become a \"master of the game\"\n\nThe three Toltec masteries: awareness, transformation and intent\n\nHow the \"four agreements\" can transform daily life\n\nSaying what you mean and meaning what you say\n\nHow a near-death experience turned Ruiz's life around\n\nDoing your best--no more and no less\n\nHow to cleanse the mind through breath\n\nRealizing how beautiful you are\n\nHow to use fear to your advantage\n\nWaking up to the dream of ordinary reality"
