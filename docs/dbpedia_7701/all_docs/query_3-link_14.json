        "text": "Don Miguel Ruiz Sr. is a Mexican author who shares the wisdom of the ancient Toltec.\n\nHis most well-known and influential work, ?The Four Agreements,? has sold nearly 4 million copies and contains practical steps for long-term, personal transformation and has been read by millions around the world. Ruiz Sr. advocates freeing ourselves from agreements and beliefs that create limitation and unhappiness in our lives. Ultimately, it is about finding one's integrity, self-love, and peace.\n\nThrough his combination of Toltec mythology and scientific perspectives, Don Miguel Ruiz Sr. is forging a new philosophy for seekers of truth and personal authenticity. Earning respect across the globe, Ruiz Sr. merges ancient wisdom with modern physics and practical common-sense,\n\nDon Miguel is the recipient of numerous recognitions, including a U.S. Air Force ?challenge coin? engraved with ?The Four Agreements.?\n\nThe youngest of thirteen children, as a young adult, he graduated from medical school in Mexico City and practiced neurosurgery with his older brother in Tijuana. A near-fatal car crash forever changed the direction of his life, however, causing him to leave medicine and to examine the essential truth about life and humanity. With his mother?s help, and through her ancestral teachings, he discovered his path to awareness, which evolved into a profound understanding of the physical universe and the virtual world of the mind."
