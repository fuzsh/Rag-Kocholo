        "text": "BROWARD COUNTY, Fla., Aug. 12, 2021 /PRNewswire/ -- Broward County Library hosts internationally known spiritual teacher and bestselling author Don Miguel Ruiz for live, interactive, online discussions of his new books, The Actor and Eros on Facebook Live.\n\nAs events for Hispanic Heritage Month, Conversaci√≥n con Don Miguel Ruiz (in Spanish) will be held at 2-3PM on Thursday, September 16, 2021 and Conversation with Don Miguel Ruiz (in English) will be held at 2-3PM on Friday, September 17, 2021. The programs are generously sponsored by Spanish Publishers LLC.\n\nParticipants will hear directly from the author as he reveals the concepts in his new creative work, Mystery School Series, or Escuela de misterios. Ruiz will discuss his writing process, heritage and techniques to create a new script for each person's life. Freda Mosquera, published author and Community Library Manager of Broward County Library's Lauderdale Lakes Branch, will moderate the conversations. There will also be book giveaways at both programs for Broward County residents.\n\nIn The Actor, the first book in the Mystery School Series, Ruiz explores human behavior as role play that we can step away from to claim personal authenticity. In Eros, the second book, he gives a master class on the art of romance and how to overcome what prevents us from loving as we should.\n\nAbout Broward County Libraries\n\nBroward County Libraries Division, named 2020 and 2015 Library of the Year by the Florida Library Association, was founded in 1974 and is the largest library system in Florida by square footage and one of the busiest.
