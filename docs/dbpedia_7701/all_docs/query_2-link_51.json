        "text": "Don Jose Ruiz is one of the most inspiring individuals on the planet. He has overcome many adversities in order to elevate himself as a leader to those who are looking to transform their lives. Today he joins us to talk about his new book, My Good Friend the Rattle Snake and to share his journey from drug riddle streets of mexico to the peaceful sanctuary of self acceptance.\n\nâPlease help us to change the worldâ! Only you can change the world that you create, and by changing your world, the world will changeâ¦ âand that is the Truth that will set you freeâ.\n\nDon Jose Ruiz was born in Mexico City, Mexico and was raised in Tijuana, Mexico. When he was 21 he came to live in the U.S. with his father, don Miguel Ruiz. From a very young age don Jose was guided by many teachers present in his life including, his mother and father, his grandmother Sarita, and several other Naguals.\n\nThrough masterful guidance by his teachers and amazing life experiences with precision synchronicity, Jose came to âsilent knowledge’; he witnessed the world as it is, without any story. In his early twenties, don Jose lost his eyesight. In his process of surrendering, he learned the value of learning to listen; to listen to his inner wisdom and integrity and to see different perspectives, while knowing nothing is personal. He had a renewed love and gratitude for life ~ and he found acceptance, happiness and abundance; he found bliss. He grasped a true understanding of faith, love, gratitude and humility. Through his surrender and faith, in concert with modern medicine Jose recovered his eyesight.\n\nLike his father, combining new insights with ancient wisdom, don Jose Ruiz is dedicating his life to sharing the ancient Toltec wisdom by translating it into practical, everyday life concepts that promote transformation through truth, love and common sense. don Jose teaches and lectures across the United States and around the world: Power Journeys to the pyramids of Teotihuacan, Palenque, Tulum and Coba; workshops with guest don Miguel or other teachers at Omega Â­ NY, Austin, and Vancouver.\n\ndon Jose Ruiz has now collaborated with his father don Miguel Ruiz on a new book that offers a fresh perspective on the Four Agreements, and a powerful new agreement for transforming our lives into our personal heaven: The Fifth Agreement.\n\nThe Fifth Agreement takes us to a deeper level of awareness of the power of the Self, and returns us to the authenticity we were born with. In this compelling sequel to The Four Agreements, we are reminded of the greatest gift we can give ourselves: the freedom to be who we really are.\n\nThe Universe of Now is an exciting project created by Don Jose Ruiz. Use the Universe of NOW to become inspired and enjoy each moment, by living in the NOW. Become more aware of what inspires or un-inspires you, and practice to become an amazing artist of life.\n\nOne of don Joseâs newest passions is his band Circle of Shadows. The Circle of Shadows is a collective of artists that formed in 2008, inspired by the dream of different voices coming together to share a common message of truth. Although geographically dispersed, the various members of the collective gather to create, record and tour. In 2009, the group released their first studio album, don Jose Ruiz and The Circle of Shadows, a CD combining music with inspiring words and original artwork. The collective currently includes Jose Ruiz (author and Shaman), Greg Beaton (musician, producer and voice actor), Joe Gasparik (musician and producer), Aaron Landman (visual artist and video producer), and Jed Rees (musician, arranger and actor).\n\nVisit don JoseâsÂ website\n\nVisit Miguel Ruiz Jr.âs new site!\n\nAt the age of 14, don Miguel Jr. apprenticed to his father don Miguel Sr. and his grandmother, Madre Sarita. From that early age, he was called upon to translate Madre Saritaâs prayers, lectures and workshops from Spanish into English. In this way, through constant repetition and review, he learned the content of her teachings in both languages.\n\nThrough interpreting for Madre Sarita, don Miguel Jr. came to understand the power of faith. He saw first-hand how she manifested her intent to heal people, both physically and spiritually.\n\ndon Miguel Jr.âs apprenticeship lasted 10 years. When he reached his mid-20âs, his father intensified his training. At the apex of this power journey don Miguel said to his eldest son, âFind your way out. Go home and master Death by becoming alive.â\n\nFor the past six years, don Miguel Jr. has applied the lessons learned from his father and grandmother to define and enjoy his own personal freedom while achieving peace with all of creation.\n\nToday, don Miguel Jr. is married and has two young children. And so, as a Nagual he begins once again to pass along the wisdom and the tools of his familyâs traditions in helping others to achieve their own personal freedom and optimal physical and spiritual health.\n\nMiguel Jr. has taken the lessons of his father and grandmother and discovered his own personal freedom. Being able to apply his teachings to the world around him gave Miguel Jr. a new understanding of the lessons his father and grandmother had passed onto him, once again giving him the desire to pass on his beliefs. After decades of training, Miguel Jr. was finally ready to share everything he had learned. As a Nagual, he now helps others discover optimal physical and spiritual health, so that they may achieve their own personal freedom."
