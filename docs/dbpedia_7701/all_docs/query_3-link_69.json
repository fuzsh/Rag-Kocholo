        "text": "Within the United States, there are few successful systems in place to cultivate peace before social disagreements escalate to violence, loss of freedom or extreme military action. Many indigenous people to the United States traditionally used practices that allowed their leaders to sustain consensus and harmony within the communities where they lived. The traditional practices were successful for most social interactions and business processes, but there were some harsher punishment necessary in extreme cases, such as banishment from the community. However, Native cultures in the United States have been severely impacted by colonization efforts, with government boarding school practices implemented to destroy the culture, and relocation used to break up the communal nature of the people. It is not difficult to understand that Native leaders and the broader Native community often suffer from identity issues, such as tensions between urban and reservation Indians; lack of clarity about inclusion or exclusion as defined by government designated blood quantum; and distrust between traditionalist and modern Native lifestyles. All of these tensions contribute to the lack of peace among and between Native people. The ultimate impact of the deliberate attempt to destroy the Native cultural practices has been an obvious disconnection from Native teachings that emphasized simplicity practices, a spirit of generosity, respect of all life forms, humility and the honor of one’s spoken word. These practices were cultural norms for the close communal nature of Native people, but assimilation into the dominant United States practices such as rugged individualism, rampant consumerism and hectic lifestyles, which were difficult for anyone to avoid, included Native people. Some of the concepts addressed in this thesis include: Integration of personal reflective practices and small group dialogue with Native peacemaking practices. The goal is to design a model that will assist Native people in revitalizing a spirit of peacefulness within tribal government processes, individual life practices and Native communities. I examine some of the traditional and current Native teachings and practices in the area of peacemaking, which the Diné (Navajo) and Chickasaw Nations use within their judicial processes. Also included within my research, are specific initiatives used by the Haudenosaunee and Comanche Nations in an attempt to create unity for the entire community, to build peace from within the people. I propose to use Talking Circles and Circles of Trust retreats as potential models for revitalizing traditional peacemaking among Native people, with an outcome of renewed emphasis on traditional values. In addition, identification of ways for practical application of traditional Native values within 21st Century lifestyles, professional work ethics and community interactions.\n\nIn Matt 5:9, Jesus tells his disciples: \"Blessed are the peacemakers, for they will be called children of God\" What is the meaning of peacemaker in the original context of the Matthean beatitude? \"Peacemaker\" is an obscure expression in the NT—it can only be found in Matt 5:9; its cognate verb is also rare, appearing only in Col 1:20. And given that the Jewish meaning of peace is theological and multifaceted, the task of interpretation is further complicated. The following essay is an exegetical analysis of Matt 5:9 for the purpose of illuminating the meaning of the expression peacemaker. This study consists of two components: (1) a lexical study of \"peacemaker\", and (2) an exegetical analysis of the beatitudes in Matthew's gospel (Matt 5:1–10), with particular emphasis given to the meaning of Matt 5:9. The lexical study analyzes the use of \"peacemaker\" and related terms outside of Matt 5:9—in the NT, in the LXX, as well as the OT Pseudepigrapha. There is some indication that the meaning of the expression is not determined by the sum of its lexical components but by its surrounding context. While the expression refers to reconciliation in the writings of Paul, in the Septuagint and Pseudepigrapha it can also convey the broader meaning of a divine blessing that results in a state of well-being, as expressed by the Jewish concept of shalom. The exegetical analysis of the beatitudes includes (1) an introduction of their setting, function, and arrangement within the Sermon on the Mount, (2) explanations of each beatitude, and (3) a fuller discussion of the beatitude concerning the peacemakers. An observation of the arrangement of the beatitudes reveals a chiastic structure in which the first and last beatitudes proclaim that the poor and those persecuted for the sake of righteousness will receive the kingdom of God. The second, third, and fourth beatitudes concern those in the kingdom who are in need, while the fifth, sixth, and seventh beatitudes relate to those who are in a position to help those in need. However, those who are in need in the seventh beatitude are not only the poor, the mourning, the hungry, or the oppressed––they are those who have committed offences and are in need of restoration. Therefore, the peacemakers refer to those who not only keep the peace, but those who initiate the process of restoring shalom in interpersonal relationships. In light of various teachings about interpersonal relationships in Matthew, peacemaking is also closely related to the ideas of reconciliation, forgiveness, and love for one's enemies (Matt 5:23, 38–42, 43–48). A blessing is pronounced upon those who are peacemakers, because they are the true children of God, who resemble God and who do the things God does. The essay concludes with some comments on the implications of the study and suggestions for contextualization. Those who participate in the activity of peacemaking can rightly share in the blessing of the peacemakers––they may truly be called the children of God.\n\nThis thesis concerns religion as a peacemaking tool in Sierra Leone. The vast majority of people in Sierra Leone consider themselves to be Christians, Muslims and / or adherents of African Traditional Religion (ATR). This thesis examines the role of religious leaders and religious communities in the peacemaking process during and after the Sierra Leone Civil War from 1991 - 2002. In previous studies about violence and religion, the role of religion in the peacemaking process has often been neglected, particularly in studies about the African continent. This study aims to fill this gap. The research is based on theoretical approaches in the field of religion and violence and religion and peace, as well as a qualitative and an empirical study in Sierra Leone comprising participant observation, interviews and data collected from archives. The thesis develops the praxis of peace based on the Sierra Leone context. It argues that since independence from Britain in 1961, subsequent governments have woefully marginalised religion. The thesis demonstrates that Christian leaders, churches, and ecumenical organisations were resources that contributed to peacemaking in Sierra Leone. Christians and their leaders influenced by ATR also led and supported the works of the Truth and Reconciliation Commission Sierra Leone (TRCSL) and the Special Court for Sierra Leone (SCSL). Christians provided leadership for truth-telling and reconciliation, relief, advocacy for peace, and confidence-building as peacemakers in action. By combining a theoretical discussion of Girard, Juergensmeyer, Schmidt, Huntington, Bowie, Johnston and others with the qualitative and empirical case study of Sierra Leone, the research adds new dimensions to the general academic debate on religion and violence, as well as religion and peacemaking, with respect to the clash of civilisations, faith-based diplomacy and other theories on religion and violence, and religion and peacemaking, in Sierra Leone.\n\nThis action research exploratory study sought to learn how to better develop my practice by using grounded theory. It explored the apparent cognitive transformational experience of nine participants over a period of four weeks after the implementation of an intervention called Mindfulness into Action. The informal intervention was used with the Kichwa community in the Amazon rainforest and three additional formal interventions were conducted in the United States, Ecuador, and Norway over six years, in each case supported by higher education institutions. Using grounded theory methodology, the researcher found that participants were in the initial “reactive” state in Phase 1, experiencing conflict, resistance, stress, and victim identity. These characteristics were unknown to participants who were just reacting to everyday life experiences. In Phase 2, participants became aware of their behaviors, but could not stop non-beneficial behaviors. In Phase 3, they could observe their unknown behaviors and then change their sabotaging behaviors. Other salient characteristics from Phase 3 were happiness, being at peace with themselves, tolerance, and effectiveness. There is a tendency to believe that change does not come easily, especially for adults, because our mental models rule our lives (subconsciously). However, participants were all adults from distinct walks of life who observed their unknown assumptions and reported change in their lives and in perceptions of their world. Furthermore, this intervention helped participants manage dissonance in their lives and produce changes specific and relevant to each individual, i.e., adults in the Kichwa community changed their assumptions and got rid of the mining company without violence. Moreover, the students who conducted research in the Amazon rainforest changed their research approach from top-down (doing research on people) to human development co-creation (doing research with people). Lastly, students in the academic institutions changed their way of interacting with their environment and others, and most importantly observed and changed behaviors that were sabotaging their efforts to succeed in life. They overcame their assumption of “knowing” and became more open to others’ perspectives. Each change was specific to the individual, resulting in the betterment of their lives."
