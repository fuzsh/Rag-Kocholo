        "text": "Categories: Arts & Culture | Best-selling Authors | Medicine, Science & Health Care | Motivation | Spirituality & Mindfulness | Wellness & Health\n\nTravels from Nevada, USA\n\nDon Miguel Ruiz is a renowned spiritual teacher and internationally bestselling author of the “Toltec Wisdom Series,” which includes the ultra-popular “The Four Agreements.”\n\nDon Miguel Ruiz is a renowned spiritual teacher and internationally bestselling author of the “Toltec Wisdom Series,” including “The Four Agreements,” “The Mastery of Love,” “The Voice of Knowledge,” “The Four Agreements Companion Book,” “The Circle of Fire,” and “The Fifth Agreement.” The Toltec Wisdom books have sold over 12 million copies, and have been published in 46 languages worldwide.\n\nDon Miguel Ruiz has spent the past three decades guiding students to personal freedom through his profound insights regarding the nature of human reality. His newest book, The Actor, is part of the Mystery School series written with Barbara Emrys, and was published in November 2020.\n\nThe youngest of thirteen children, Don Miguel Ruiz was born in rural Mexico to parents who were healers and practitioners of ancient Toltec traditions. As a young adult, he graduated from medical school in Mexico City and practiced neurosurgery with his older brother in Tijuana. A near-fatal car crash forever changed the direction of his life, however, causing him to leave medicine and to examine the essential truth about life and humanity. With his mother’s help and through her ancestral teachings, he discovered his path to awareness, which evolved into a deep understanding of the physical universe and the virtual world of the mind.\n\nCombining Toltec mythology and scientific perspectives, Don Miguel Ruiz has been able to merge ancient wisdom with modern physics and practical common sense, forging a new philosophy for seekers of truth and personal authenticity. His landmark bestselling book, The Four Agreements, contains practical steps for long-term, personal transformation and has been read by millions around the world.\n\nFirst published in 1997, The Four Agreements has since sold over six million copies in the United States and seven million worldwide. It has been translated into 46 languages, appeared on the New York Times bestseller for nearly ten years, and was the 36th bestselling book of the decade. Don Miguel Ruiz is also the author of The Mastery of Love, The Voice of Knowledge, Prayers, and the New York Times bestseller, The Fifth Agreement, a collaboration with his son, Don José Ruiz. Each of his books are international bestsellers.\n\nThe wisdom Don Miguel Ruiz has brought to the world has earned him respect around the globe. He has dedicated his life to sharing his message through practical concepts to promote transformation and ultimately change lives for the better. Don Miguel is the recipient of numerous recognitions, including a U.S. Air Force ‘challenge coin’ engraved with “The Four Agreements.” He is the recipient of an Honorary Degree in Cultural and Social Education from the American Cultural Institute of Mexico and is referenced as a “national treasure” in his native country."
