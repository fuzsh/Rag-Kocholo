        "text": "Don Miguel Ruiz, New York Times bestseller author of the book “The Four Agreements” and Guadalajara native writer who currently resides in Tijuana and has given credit to the border city, won a Latino Spirit Award 2023 in the “Achievement in Literature” category.\n\nThis ceremony occurred in Sacramento where the California Latino Caucus awarded the writer due to his renowned career which includes books such as “The Mastery of Love” and “The Actor”, among other books with Toltec philosophy. These awards have been given since 2002 to leaders in the Latino community who have performed outstandingly in technology, journalism and media, literature, health and science, defense, business, education, human rights, arts, public services, and entertainment.\n\nDavid Pérez Tejada, director of Binational Issues of the Government of Baja California, was present at the event and congratulated Don Miguel Ruiz for this important achievement. For his part, representative David Álvarez stated:\n\nDon Miguel Ruiz is a world-renowned author and master. It was an honor to present his nomination to this award. Mr. Ruiz has spent his life teaching people about Toltec traditions and helped people all over the world on their spiritual journey.\n\nDon Miguel Ruiz, born in Guadalajara on August 27, 1952, is an [b]acclaimed spiritual master. Despite his humble education, Miguel studied medicine at Universidad Nacional Autónoma de México. After completing his undergraduate internship, he started working as a neurosurgeon with his brother in Tijuana.\n\nIn 1986, Miguel decided to leave medicine and move to San Diego, California, to share the philosophy he had inherited from his ancestors and find answers to questions about the human mind. Miguel’s mother taught him about Toltec traditions, which resulted in him writing \"The Four Agreements\", a book with practical steps towards personal transformation."
