        "text": "Don Miguel Ruiz speaks at the Enlightened Entrepreneur Summit and then takes a minute to discuss his bestselling book with us.\n\nDon Miguel Ruiz – The Four Agreements + the 5th\n\n[youtube=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDHgOqhrdpE]\n\nI read The Four Agreements after first seeing them. Just the titles made sense and I wanted to know more.\n\nDon Miguel had just flown in from Mexico and got to hang out in his room for a couple of hours before speaking in front of a packed room at the Enlightened Entrepreneur Summit in Anaheim, CA\n\nAfter his talk he was surrounded for some time by fans and people that wanted to tell him what they thought or ask questions, get pictures get their books signed and on and on… I would be done.., but I walked up to Don and asked if he was up for an interview before he left. I barely got out the words when he came at me with a wonderfully loving inviting hug as if I was his best friend and he had been waiting in anticipation for me to arrive. I have been around many in the thought leader realm and this was different and wholly authentic and I have to admit it through me for a second.\n\nI enjoyed it and arm and arm we walked to the place where I had set up the camera. The rest you will see here. Thank you for your time and your wonderful energy Don xo – JW\n\nDon Miguel Ruiz\n\nDon Miguel Ruiz was born into a family of healers, and raised in rural Mexico by a curandera (healer) mother and a nagual (shaman) grandfather.\n\nThe family anticipated that Miguel would embrace their centuries-old legacy of healing and teaching, and carry forward the esoteric Toltec knowledge. Instead, distracted by modern life, Miguel chose to attend medical school and become a surgeon.\n\nA near-death experience changed his life. Stunned by this experience, he began an intensive practice of self-inquiry.\n\nHe devoted himself to the mastery of the ancient ancestral wisdom, studying earnestly with his mother, and completing an apprenticeship with a powerful shaman in the Mexican desert.\n\nIn the tradition of the Toltecs, a nagual guides an individual to personal freedom.\n\nDon Miguel is a nagual from the Eagle Knight lineage, and is dedicated to sharing his knowledge of the teachings of the ancient Toltecs.\n\nHe is the author of The Four Agreements, The Mastery of Love, and The Four Agreements Companion Book. Website: www.MiguelRuiz.com\n\nThe Four Agreements\n\nAccording to Don Miguel Ruiz, everything we do is based on agreements we have made — agreements with ourselves, with other people, with God, with life. But the most important agreements are the ones we make with ourselves.\n\nIn these agreements we tell ourselves who we are, how to behave, what is possible, what is impossible. One single agreement is not such a problem, but we have many agreements that come from fear, deplete our energy, and diminish our self-worth.\n\nIn The Four Agreements, Don Miguel reveals the source of self-limiting agreements that rob us of joy and create needless suffering.\n\nWhen we are ready to change these agreements, there are four deceptively simple, yet powerful agreements that we can adopt as guiding principles.\n\nBased on ancient Toltec wisdom, the Four Agreements offer a powerful code of conduct that can rapidly transform our lives to a new experience of freedom, true happiness, and love.\n\nAgreement 1\n\nBe impeccable with your word – Speak with integrity. Say only what you mean. Avoid using the word to speak against yourself or to gossip about others. Use the power of your word in the direction of truth and love.\n\nAgreement 2\n\nDon’t take anything personally – Nothing others do is because of you. What others say and do is a projection of their own reality, their own dream. When you are immune to the opinions and actions of others, you won’t be the victim of needless suffering.\n\nAgreement 3\n\nDon’t make assumptions – Find the courage to ask questions and to express what you really want. Communicate with others as clearly as you can to avoid misunderstandings, sadness and drama. With just this one agreement, you can completely transform your life.\n\nAgreement 4\n\nAlways do your best – Your best is going to change from moment to moment; it will be different when you are healthy as opposed to sick. Under any circumstance, simply do your best, and you will avoid self-judgment, self-abuse and regret.\n\nThere is one more agreement Don Ruiz wrote about that he believes you discover after realizing the first four.\n\nAgreement 5\n\nQuestion Everything. “Don’t believe me, don’t believe others, don’t believe yourself.” Eliminating belief systems are one of the core teachings of the Toltec Path. Whenever you have a belief, you no longer perceive what is.\n\nAlso if someone says they have the true and only answer.. run the other way. Take the knowledge from all that suits your path and be willing to change your opinion swiftly as the world goes from flat to round and Earth no longer is the center of the universe.\n\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nWe want to thank Maria Simone and The Enlightened Entrepreneur Summit for allowing us to cover this incredible event. This is one of my favorite events every year… – JW\n\nWhy do you need to go?

The summit will help you figure out your plan, build your team and get funded by pitching to investors at the event."
