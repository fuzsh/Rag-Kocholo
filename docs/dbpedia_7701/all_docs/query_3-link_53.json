        "text": "The Toltec Guru\n\nDON MIGUEL RUIZ\n\nI had the pleasure of interviewing Don Miguel Ruiz before the world was so dramatically touched by the Coronavirus outbreak. This explains how it occurred that the interview took place in person, and why the pandemic was never discussed in our exchange.\n\nThat being said, it doesn’t long to feel at home with Don Miguel. He has a way of making you feel like you’re the only person in the room. His presence is immediate and lasting. His genuine interest and tender wisdom put you at ease.\n\nFor this reason, and many more, it’s no surprise that don Miguel has become one of the world’s most favorite spiritual leaders and bestselling authors. His unique combination of Toltec wisdom with modern physics has captivated hearts worldwide and shifted their perspective of life for the better.\n\nHe’s widely known for the best-selling book, The Four Agreements, that suggests four “golden rules” to live by for strengthening personal freedom. His other books include, The Mastery of Love, The Voice of Knowledge, Prayers, The Fifth Agreement and The Three Questions.\n\nIn this interview, we discuss his book, The Three Questions, as well as some universal curiosities about life. Some responses have been edited for brevity.\n\nWho is behind don Miguel Ruiz—What’s inside?\n\nThis is a very good question because it’s really hard to know. I can say it’s Life Itself because what I’m projecting is Miguel Ruiz, but Miguel Ruiz is just an image. It’s not real. I discovered this through much awareness. Being aware of what I used to think I was and finding out that’s not really who I am.\n\nThis concept rolls right into what you share in your book, The Three Questions. The three questions being: Who am I? What is love? and What is real?\n\nExactly. Then if we ask, who is behind Miguel Ruiz? The answer is Life Itself.\n\nYou talk about “The Human Dream” in the book—can you elaborate?\n\nThis life is just a dream. It is happening and we’re perceiving, but something else very interesting is happening. We have in our head what I call narrators.\n\nA narrator is telling you with words what we are perceiving about what is happening, and we use logic in order to make it fit. Life is not an illusion, it is real. The illusion is what we perceive as a reflection of what is really happening. Which brings the last question, “What is real?” into play.\n\nWe usually ask this third question, “What is real?”, when there’s something happening in our life that doesn’t feel right. This happens because our world is always changing. How we perceive the world when we’re ten years old is completely different than how we perceive it at 14 years old. And completely different again, when we’re in our 20s, 30s, or 40s. When something happens in our life, then the world, “our” world, changes and always “looks” real, but we need to check in with ourselves all the time because the answer is constantly changing.\n\nYou mention in the book that a helpful way to\n\nanswer these three questions is by asking ourselves the opposite of them and looking at that answer. For example: Who am I — who am I not? What is love — what isn’t love?\n\nYes. In order for you to know what you are, first, you have to find out what … you are not. This is something that took me a long time to discover, but I find it of great value.\n\nLooking at what is not offers insight into what is. Imagine that you lose a hand—you’re still you. If you lose an arm, you’re still you.\n\nWhen you die, are you still you?\n\nThat’s the most beautiful question. Yes, what dies is our physical body. When the physical body goes away, you’re still you because you are not the body. You are the force that moves your body. The force which moves every molecule of your body; every quantum, which means the “real you” is alive.\n\nWhen we have that awareness, our perspective changes. Now we know what we are, but there are no words to explain it. The closest is to say, “I’m life.”\n\nThen we see our physical body in a completely different way. We see our body as home, where we live. I see my physical body as a temple that I love and honor. When I find out what I am not, what I find out is that my physical body is the love of my life.\n\nWhat would you say to someone who believes\n\neverything you’ve shared—in fact, they’re consciously on the path, but every now and then they catch\n\nthemselves slipping into an “unreal” illusion?\n\nWhat could one do to remind themselves, other\n\nthan continue to ask these questions?\n\nTo continue to ask and answer these questions again and again. Ask the second question right away. “Is that real? Is this really happening? Or am I making it all up?”\n\nAnd that is usually the answer. You’re making it all up. It’s only real in your mind, in your story, not in anybody else’s experience. If you’re facing this illusion, it’s because you have fallen prey to believing in your own story. It feels real, and you believe it’s real, so it becomes real.\n\nIn the book, I compare your mind with a country that is your creation, and because you create that story (that country), you are the “President.” Then the question becomes, what kind of president are you? How do you rule your story, your world? Are you a victim of your own beliefs?\n\nYou follow the rules that run your story, and there is a “Congress” who approves or rejects each rule. The only way to heal your story is to change the Congress within, which changes your beliefs around what is right or wrong. You are basically unlearning, which is the whole purpose of the Toltec.\n\nIn what way is the Toltec faith different from just being a spiritual person?\n\nWell, the word Toltec means artist, which makes every single human an artist. We’re all working on our own masterpiece, which is the story of our life. It doesn’t matter what language you speak; it doesn’t matter what\n\nreligion you follow. You are the artist of your own life.\n\nThe challenge becomes changing the limiting belief system in our minds; to change the “constitution.” We do that by using the Power of Doubt and doubting everything that we know. We doubt by asking, Is that true?\n\nIs that real?\n\nIf we doubt things all of the time by asking, “Is this real?” how will we know when we’ve actually landed on what really is real? Suppose we surrender to something as being real, but it’s just another illusion—How will we know which answer to trust?\n\nThis is where The Fifth Agreement comes in. The Fifth Agreement says to be skeptical but learn to listen. Don’t believe yourself and don’t believe anybody else, because there is no one truth. Everyone is coming from what they believe is true. They will tell you what they believe is real; listen, but doubt it.\n\nIf we always doubt everything, how do we find peace of mind?\n\nBy not believing anything, outright. Listen to what you tell yourself and then make a choice. Hear what other people say and take from it what resonates with you. What doesn’t, just put in the trash, it’s not personal.\n\nWhen you do that, you’re challenging your beliefs and changing the laws that rule your life, and you become better president of your country. Then you’ve reprogrammed yourself in your own way. Only you can change your world—nobody else.\n\nYou seem so full of love and peace every time I\n\nsee you, and I wonder—do you ever have feelings\n\nof despair or hopelessness?\n\nOh, definitely, yes.\n\nWhat do you do when you have those feelings? Because so many of us are wondering how to cope with all that’s going on in the world today and even in our personal lives. What do you do?\n\nWell, what we need to do is to use awareness to see what is real. I remember being in my 20’s and getting my heartbroken when things didn’t happen the way I wanted.\n\nI see now that I broke my own heart, I just used other people and circumstances to do so. I was focused on things being a certain way, and if they didn’t work out, I’d get upset thinking life wasn’t fair. But it was not true.\n\nI’m curious, what makes you sad? I’m sure you\n\neventually ask the three questions, but what makes Don Miguel sad?\n\nThat’s a beautiful question. And yes, I feel sad sometimes. Not as sad as forty or fifty years ago, but it’s a sadness that I understand. For example, I see my physical body declining, and there’s nothing I can about it.\n\nI try to keep my body healthy so it can heal itself, but that little sadness is frustrating.\n\nYes. But what makes you so sad that you cry?\n\nWhat makes me cry?\n\nYes. We all cry. We’re human.\n\nWell, yes. I suppose what makes me cry could be my own stories that I believe when I forget that I shouldn’t believe. But as soon as I’m aware, then I stop right away.\n\nWhat makes you laugh?\n\nJoy makes me laugh. Love makes me laugh. Little situations make me laugh. Something that I adore makes me laugh.\n\nWhat is your definition of happiness?\n\nMy definition of happiness is to enjoy what I do. Happiness is not something that makes me lose any kind of control. Being happy is just to be, to accept myself the way I am, and to be comfortable in my skin.\n\nAre you saying that peace is happiness for you?\n\nPeace is part of the happiness, yes. I would say that my happiness is an accumulation of all the things that make me feel grateful to live in this physical body.\n\nWith everything that’s going on in the world, what makes you hopeful?\n\nI’m hopeless. And I can tell you that God is hopeless. He doesn’t play with hope.\n\nSo how do we move forward if we’re hopeless? Don’t we need a certain amount of hope to keep us going?\n\nNo. When you hope that something will happen, you feel bad if it doesn’t. But if you take action, it will happen. I can say, I’m hopeless, or I’m hope-less. Well, I’m hope-less.\n\nWhy should I hope for something that I don’t know will happen or not happen? If I want it to happen, I go in that direction and make it happen. And if it happens, good. It doesn’t happen, good anyway. At least I have taken the action. I don’t play with the hope. Can you imagine if God “hoped” that His creation would be great?\n\nWow, I really like that! Ok, I have a fun question, “Who is your favorite author?”\n\nMy favorite author? There’s so many. Maybe a newborn baby. They have all the potential to be whatever they choose. A newborn baby because it is pre-domesticated. It’s just pure love, an incarnation of love.\n\nWhat a poetic answer. I love the thought that we’re the author of our lives, and a newborn baby is starting on a blank page, “hope-Lesly,” creating beautiful stories.\n\nThank you, Don Miguel, for being so generous with your time and sharing your exquisite insight with the Eden Magazine readers.
