        "text": "PRICING\n\nEarly Pricing: $1795\n\n*Standard Pricing: After May 1: $1995\n\n*Only if available.\n\nAll pricing is individual with double occupancy. We encourage participants that are friends or from the same family who are traveling to the retreat together to share a room.\n\nSingle Rooms are not available for this retreat.\n\nEVERYTHING IS INCLUDED!\n\nThis is an * ALL-INCLUSIVE * retreat\n\n+ Welcome gathering -online- to get to know each other and answer questions\n\n+ 4-night accommodation\n\n+ Airport shuttle to the hotel and back at designated times\n\n+ Daily homemade breakfast, lunch, and dinner\n\n+ Park Entrances\n\n+ All teachings\n\n+ Goodbye fiesta\n\nIncluded in the trip are your lodging, meals- which are homemade and adjustable to dietary needs, park entrances, all teachings during the event, and your group transportation to and from Mexico City airport at designated times.\n\nIf you register now, a $500.00 deposit will secure your placement in this event; the remaining balance will be due 4 weeks prior to the trip.\n\nCANCELATION POLICY\n\nUNTIL APRIL 30TH: Your deposit is non-refundable, however, it is transferable to some of the events that involve the Ruiz Family, please inquire if you are curious about which events can have deposits transferred between them. Your remaining balance is fully refundable.\n\nAFTER MAY 1ST: Your deposit is non-refundable. Your remaining balance is non-refundable but it is transferable to some of the events that involve the Ruiz Family, please inquire if you are curious about which events can have the balance transferred between them.\n\nWe highly encourage you to get travel insurance for your flight ticket. “Cancel For Any Reason” (CFAR) coverage is usually an add-on feature to a trip insurance policy.\n\nWHO WILL GUIDE THIS POWER JOURNEY\n\nThis power journey will be taught by the Ruiz Family:\n\ndon Jose Ruiz and don Miguel Ruiz Jr.\n\nand a special appearance by don Miguel Ruiz via Zoom\n\nArrival To and Departure From Mexico City\n\nIf you are checking flights to attend this event and would like to be included in the transportation included in the trip price, you will need to arrive at Mexico City Airport (MEX) before 3:00 PM on May 25, and your departure flight should be after 3:00 PM on May 29.\n\nOur journey together begins in Mexico City, Mexico. You are responsible for your own transportation to and from the Benito Juarez Mexico City airport (MEX). Once you arrive and pass through immigration and customs, we take care of getting you where you need to be!\n\nFrom the USA- Many airlines have direct flights from Los Angeles, Houston and New York to Mexico City, including AeroMexico, Alaska, Volaris, Horizon, Delta, and United.\n\nMore options are available if connecting through another U.S. city.\n\nFrom Europe- Most commercial airlines link Mexico directly to Europe. It is always worth comparing flight offers from air carriers who can bring you to Mexico City or Cancun via many European hubs, like Frankfurt, Paris, Amsterdam, and Madrid…..the flight duration from those cities is always approx. 11 hours (+ your connecting flight from home, if you do not board directly at the mentioned airports)\n\nFrom Australia or New Zealand- Fly from either Sydney, Brisbane, Melbourne, or Auckland(NZ) direct to Los Angeles. Delta, Qantas, United, and V Australia offer non-stop air service from Australia to Los Angeles. Air New Zealand offers a one-stop air service from Australia and non-stop air service from Auckland to Los Angeles. Hawaiian Airlines and Air Tahiti Nui offer one- or two-stop air service to Los Angeles from Australia and New Zealand.\n\nFor your departure, airlines request to do the check-in 3hrs prior to the departure of international flights, and it takes one hour to get from the hotel to the airport during regular business hours. We ask you to schedule your flight back home after 3 PM so that we can leave the hotel at approx 11 AM.\n\nAn earlier flight will mean an extra cost for transportation to the airport. If you cannot use group transportation, please indicate your situation on the trip application. One week before the event, we will send out a final transport list with more details.\n\nHotel\n\nWe are staying at two locations, The Dreaming House and Villa Las Campanas. Both hotels are run by the same family and a 5-minute walk from each other. Most classes will be held at The Dreaming House, but both locations are beautiful and charming!\n\nThe Dreaming House\n\nAddress: Calle Libertad No. 15, San Sebastian Xolalpa Méx., Mexico\n\nPhone: +52 594 956 3969\n\nwww.thedreaminghousemx.com\n\nLas Villas Campanas\n\nAddress: C. Constitución 43, 55824 San Sebastián Xolalpa, Méx., Mexico\n\nPhone: 56 3262 5759 (WhatsApp)\n\nwww.villalascampanasmexico.com\n\nMoney\n\nThis is an all-inclusive retreat, so you only need a bit of extra money for snacks or souvenirs you might want to buy.\n\nThe exchange rate is 1USD= 20 pesos (January 2022)"
