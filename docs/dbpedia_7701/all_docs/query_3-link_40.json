It encourages personal freedom, by posting four tenets: being impeccable with your words, taking nothing personally, making no assumptions, and always doing your best.\n\nIf you had to name four self-betrayals that you usually do to yourself, which will they be?\n\nSpeaking too much, believing too little\n\nHiding behind masks\n\nDesigning false realities\n\nDelivering half of everything: half smiling, half caring, half creating, half working…\n\nWith this book called The Four Agreements, Don Miguel Ruiz invites you to think and live in the opposite of all these. Our “The Four Agreements Summary” is waiting to provide more info about it.\n\nDon’t miss this! You are only 4 agreements away from personal freedom.\n\nDon Miguel Ruiz, the author of the four agreements is a well-known author that dedicated his work to the ancient Toltec Masters, trying to improve life according to these beliefs. This international bestselling author has also written books like The Mastery of Love, Prayers, and Beyond Fear.\n\nPERSONAL FREEDOM / WHAT ARE THE THE FOUR AGREEMENTS\n\nThe most important agreements are the ones you made with yourself.\n\n“The Four Agreements Summary”\n\nSometimes it can be an innocuous lollipop moment, and sometimes it can be the death of a loved one.\n\nIn the case of Don Miguel Ángel Ruiz, a Mexican author born on August 27, 1952, it was a near-fatal car accident.\n\nBorn into a large family in rural Mexico – he was the youngest of 13 children! – Miguel didn’t have a great life for most of his childhood, scarred by poverty and numerous obstacles.\n\nHis parents, healers, and practitioners of ancient Toltec wisdom and traditions offered him everything they could, and he learned a lot of them even as a child.\n\nWith their help and the help of his siblings, he fought through all of the hardships and managed to become a neurosurgeon, just like one of his older brothers.\n\nFor a few years, he practiced medicine with him in Tijuana, thinking that he had found the goal and object of his life.\n\nAnd then the accident occurred.\n\nDon Miguel Ruiz saw his life pass before his eyes and realized that it was not the life he was supposed to be living.\n\nSo, left both his promising medical career and Tijuana and went back to his mother to learn more about the “essential truth about life and humanity.”\n\nHis mother passed on him the ancestral teachings of the Toltecs, and Don Miguel Ruiz soon realized that, through her words, he had already embarked on his journey to awareness.\n\nBut it was not enough.\n\nSo, he apprenticed himself to a shaman and spent many years studying and absorbing the secrets of the ancients. His initial vision rapidly “evolved into a deep understanding of the physical universe and the virtual world of the mind.”\n\nSince he had a scientific background, Don Miguel became conscious of the fact that he was one of the very few people on the planet capable of merging the wisdom of the Toltecs with modern physics and biology.\n\nSo, he did just that – and launched The Four Agreements which remained on the New York Times bestseller list for over 8 years.\n\nDon Miguel Ruiz identifies the source of sorrow in life and suggests 4 agreements for a better life and self-improvement. All those four agreements are based on Aztec wisdom as a source of positive ideas and good lifestyle tips.\n\nIt is a wonderful book on self-improvement that reveals the ancient Aztec wisdom of Toltec explained in simple four agreements. It establishes great ways to change our lives, and great ideas with an important impact on our lifestyle. Following the four agreements, we can bring rapid positive changes in our lives. It is a wonderful opportunity and a great challenge as well.\n\nOur lives can turn from sad to happy and the author guides us in order to gain the wanted freedom.\n\nWhat are the four agreements?\n\nBe impeccable with your word\n\nDon’t take anything personally\n\nDon’t make assumptions\n\nAlways do your best\n\nHuman perception is in a good connection with attention. In our dream, we pay attention to different aspects of life. Also, another psychological act is repetition. This is used as a way to retain and learn things. In a relationship, we seem to need the ongoing attention of the ones we connect to.\n\nWe seem to need more and more attention from the ones we love. So we usually do things that draw attention to us.\n\nThe Four Agreements Summary is written to explain how and why God made us intelligent. (This is the easiest truth we are ready to admit).\n\nOur intelligence is well reflected in our language, and our capacity to speak and express opinions and beliefs. The most common definition of language is this one: a code, a list of sign conventions, that help us understand each other.\n\nBeyond this obvious benefit, language has also its positive and negative aspects, most often being a spontaneous expression of our spirit.\n\nEach person has an Inner judge, that’s for sure. And this inner judge makes us feel guilty every time we do a mistake. In addition, the Victim is part of us that becomes aware of the guilt and punishment.\n\nThe individuals are in a continuous struggle to be perfect. But, let’s be honest. Is perfection even possible? With all our efforts, it is unlikely to fit or to be able to make perfection part of our lives. The guilt, and the fear come from the fact that we don’t succeed in being good enough for the people we love.\n\nDisappointment makes us feel bad. This is how domestication teaches us to try to be better.\n\nEven though you have to give up old habits, the new improved life will prove to you that it’s worth the effort.\n\nAnd just like that, we go back to the key concept of Don Miguel Ruiz’s book: The 4 Agreements :\n\n#1 – Be Impeccable With Your Word\n\nKeep your integrity when using words. Try to be true to what you say without compromising. You shouldn’t agree with ideas that are against gossiping. The words should be used to spread the love.\n\nBecause “impeccable” means “faultless,” “immaculate,” “perfect,” and “above reproach.” It means saying the things you really want to say, and, yet, never saying anything which is not love and truth.\n\nBecause words have energy, and because their energy – whether good or bad – will eventually come flooding back to you, to make you smile or haunt you.\n\nThe best part: is it’s your choice!\n\n#2 – Don’t Take Anything Personally\n\nGain immunity over other people’s opinions about you. You shouldn’t consider, agree, or be influenced by other people’s comments or gossip about you. Paying attention to what others say about you will make you a victim, so stop the needless suffering.\n\nWhen someone wants to impose his or her worldview on someone else, he/she is actually trying to rewrite someone else’s story unknowingly.\n\nThis is the birthplace of all the misunderstandings and quarrels of the world.\n\nIt doesn’t mean that if two people don’t agree with each other only one of them is right. It usually means nothing more than that their stories are incompatible.\n\nBut what should you do in these kinds of cases?\n\nEasy!\n\nJust – apologize and forgive.\n\nThat doesn’t mean that you’ve done something wrong.\n\nIt only means that you value your friendships more than your ego.\n\nAnd that’s a great thing!\n\n#3 – Don’t Make Assumptions\n\nIn order to clarify situations, to bring light to conflicts, you should have the courage to ask questions and also express your thoughts. Communication is key to avoiding misunderstanding or assuming things.\n\n“You should never ASSUME. Because when you ASSUME, you make an ASS, of U, and ME!”\n\nAnd Don Miguel says that he’s got a point!\n\nJust stop trying to read other people’s minds!\n\nBecause the chances are you’re doing it wrong and making life worse for everyone – especially yourself.\n\n#4 – Always Do Your Best\n\nDoing your best depends entirely on you. It will not always be the same. For example, you can be sick, which will probably make you give less, but the author’s advice is to do your best no matter the situation.\n\nDoing your best will improve your life and help others.\n\nYour best changes from moment to moment; your best is different when you are healthy as opposed to sick. Simply do your best under any circumstance to avoid self-judgment, self-abuse, and regret.\n\nThe author considers the fourth agreement by far the most important\n\nThe true love that we yearn so much for can be gained if we accept others the way they are. We have to stop wearing masks and pretend to be something else:\n\nReal love is accepting other people the way they are without trying to change them.\n\nDon Miguel Ruiz compares the ones that want to adopt these useful tips like spiritual warriors or become one of the seven wonders, in order to gain their freedom. We must fight against old emotional habits in order to gain our personal freedom.\n\nGenerally speaking the meeting with the free Spirit brings bliss. Myths, religions, spiritual acts, Way, Truth, imagination and dreams all lead to cultural ecstasy.\n\nThese theories can become a healthy practice in our real lives, as the title suggests.\n\nKey Lessons from “The Four Agreements”\n\n1. Give it all you got\n\n2. Don’t hesitate to make a move\n\n3. Be authentic, no matter what\n\nGive it all you got\n\nTruly, it’s hard to go on your own. The crowd is designed to suck the individuality and produce collectiveness.\n\nNevertheless, even if this spell can be broken, just trust your instincts and move parallelly with your vision.\n\nDon’t hesitate to make a move\n\nSometimes, we lack the strength to endure a painful loss. Over the years some of us have developed an inferior approach, which leads to a lack of inventiveness.\n\nDon’t greave, there’s always good in every situation, you just have to find it.\n\nBe authentic, no matter what\n\nThis lesson is pretty straightforward. If you imitate others and fail to follow your inner urges, you’ll just add to the averageness.\n\nStick to your agenda, trust in your beliefs, and hope for a big victory.\n\nLike this summary?
