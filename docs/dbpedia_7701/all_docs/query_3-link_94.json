        "text": "The Four Agreements™ was published in 1997 and has sold over 15 million copies in the United States alone. It has been on the New York Times Bestselling list for over a decade. Everything we do is based on agreements we have made - agreements with ourselves, with other people, with God, and with life. But the most important agreements are the ones we make with ourselves.\n\nIn The Four Agreements, don Miguel Ruiz reveals the source of self-limiting beliefs that rob us of joy and create needless suffering. Based on ancient Toltec wisdom, The Four Agreements offer a powerful code of conduct that can rapidly transform our lives to a new experience of freedom, true happiness, and love.\n\n• A New York Times bestseller for over a decade\n\n• Over 15 million copies sold in the U.S.\n\n• Published in 52 languages worldwide\n\nIntroduction\n\nIn The Four Agreements, don Miguel Ruiz reveals the source of self-limiting beliefs that rob us of joy and create needless suffering. Based on ancient Toltec wisdom, The Four Agreements offer a powerful code of conduct that can rapidly transform our lives to a new experience of freedom, true happiness, and love.\n\nDomestication: Part 1\n\nIn Part 1 of this 2-part video, we learn about the “domestication” of humans and how all the rules and values of our family and society are imposed on us through a punishment and reward system. The Four Agreements help us to break self-limiting agreements and replace them with agreements that bring us freedom, happiness, and love.\n\nDomestication: Part 2\n\nPart 2 of this 2-part video teaches us about the Book of Law that rules our mind and the inner judge that makes us suffer because we never measure up to our “image of perfection.” All of our normal tendencies are lost in the process of domestication, and we begin to search for what we have lost. We search for freedom because we are no longer free; we search for happiness because we are no longer happy; we search for beauty because we no longer believe we are beautiful. What we are searching for is our “self.”"
