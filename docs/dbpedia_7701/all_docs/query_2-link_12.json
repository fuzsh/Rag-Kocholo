        "text": "Miguel Ruiz, often referred to as Don Miguel Ruiz, is a renowned spiritual teacher and author who hails from Mexico. Born into a lineage of Toltec healers and nurtured by this ancient Mesoamerican tradition, Ruiz originally pursued a career in medicine, serving as a surgeon.\n\nA Toltec Wisdom Book Books in Order\n\nThe Toltec Wisdom Books are a series of enlightening texts rooted in the ancient wisdom of the Toltec people, a Mesoamerican culture that thrived in central Mexico. These books, notably popularized by spiritual teacher Don Miguel Ruiz, delve into age-old teachings to provide practical advice for achieving personal freedom, happiness, and love in contemporary times. Interweaving the deep spiritual traditions of the Toltecs with modern perspectives, the texts offer readers transformative insights and guidance to navigate life’s challenges and cultivate inner peace.\n\n1. The Four Agreements\n\n2. The Mastery of Love\n\n3. The Voice of Knowledge (with Janet Mills) (2004)\n\n4. The Fifth Agreement (2009)\n\n5. The Four Agreements Companion Book: Using The Four Agreements to Master the Dream of Your Life (with Janet Mills) (2000)\n\n6. The Circle of Fire: Inspiration and Guided Meditations for Living in Love and Happiness (with Janet Mills) (2013)\n\nDon Miguel Ruiz Biography\n\nEarly Life\n\nDon Miguel Ruiz was born in rural Mexico on August 27, 1952. He was raised in a family of healers, and his mother was a curandera (healer), while his grandfather was a nagual (shaman). From an early age, Ruiz was immersed in the rich traditions of the Toltec, an ancient Mesoamerican culture.\n\nMedical Career\n\nBefore turning to spiritual teaching, Ruiz pursued a career in medicine. He attended medical school and became a surgeon. This experience allowed him to understand the human mind and body from both a scientific and spiritual perspective.\n\nCar Accident and Spiritual Awakening\n\nIn the late 1970s, a near-fatal car accident changed the course of Ruiz’s life. This event made him reflect on his life and the ancient Toltec teachings. As a result, he decided to explore the deeper spiritual truths and practices of his ancestors.\n\nThe Four Agreements\n\nIn 1997, Ruiz published “The Four Agreements,” which quickly became a bestseller. This book offers a practical guide to personal freedom based on ancient Toltec wisdom. The four agreements are:\n\nBe impeccable with your word.\n\nDon’t take anything personally.\n\nDon’t make assumptions.\n\nAlways do your best.\n\nThis book has had a significant impact on many readers, leading them to a path of personal growth and transformation.\n\nSubsequent Works\n\nAfter the success of “The Four Agreements”, Ruiz wrote several other books expanding on the principles of Toltec wisdom. Notable titles include “The Mastery of Love,” “The Voice of Knowledge,” and “The Fifth Agreement,” which he co-wrote with his son, Don Jose Ruiz.\n\nHealth Issues and Semi-retirement\n\nIn 2002, Ruiz suffered a heart attack, which led him to reduce his public appearances and teachings. Despite this setback, he continued to share his insights and knowledge through his books and limited engagements.\n\nDon Miguel Ruiz’s Legacy\n\nDon Miguel Ruiz is considered one of the foremost spiritual teachers of our time. His unique blend of ancient wisdom and modern insights has provided guidance to millions worldwide. His work continues to inspire individuals to transform their lives and achieve personal freedom."
