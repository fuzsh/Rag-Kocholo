        "text": "Negotiating Conquest is a scholarly work written by Miroslava Chavez-Garcia, which analyzes women 's roles in history, and discusses how the political system has affected their roles. It covers the period between the 1770 's to the 1880 's, the periods before and after American Conquest. Likewise, this book is divided into two sections, chapters 1-3 discusses \"Women in Spanish and Mexican California,\" and chapters 4-6 discusses \"Women in American California.\" This work analyzes the major ideas present within each period and how it affected women 's roles and power. The time and effort put into this book, is something that the author enjoyed, calling it a \"labor of love.\" Overall, she then claims that her purpose in writing this work is to, \"honor and recognize woman of all ethnic backgrounds, social classes, and regions, who established households, nurtured and reared families, and rose above personal adversity in societies that often ignored, overlooked, and rendered them invisible.\"\n\nSantiago knows that he is the protege and the Alchemist is his mentor, they have respect for each other “How characters are getting along or not getting along” (Foster 80). Drinking wine in a foreign country where it is illegal, is an act of unity and also “Whenever people eat or drink together, it's communion” (Foster 8). To Foster, “Breaking bread is an act of sharing and peace” (8) Santiago and the Alchemist would not have shared their last meal together on the Oasis if they had not wanted a peaceful environment before their journey to come.\n\nI would recommend, “The Pact: Three young men make a promise and fulfill a dream” to eleventh grade students for several reasons. First factor, throughout this whole novel it gives you a wakeup call. For example, life in college is not that easy as you think, they got in to a lot of trouble, and throughout all that they were given a second chance in life. Second factor, Depicts transition from high school to college. They knew college is different from high school because of their own experience. They struggled throughout college, they financially couldn’t pay their books and other stuff they need to fro their classes. Then, this novel teaches you life lessons. Throughout this novel you will see how hard they had it and they still chased\n\nOne of the most important documents in the history of the state of Texas is the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo, whose many functions included the termination of the Mexican-American War, the establishment of the Rio Grande as the official border between the state of Texas and the country of Mexico, as well as granting rights to all Mexican citizens living in the state (Collier et al. 12). However, it is essential to recognize how the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo established the core identity of Texas an ethnically and culturally diverse state because of the functions explicitly outlined in within its text, making it the marker of a major turning point in the history of the state (Collier et al. 12). Since its signing on February 2nd, 1848, the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo remains in effect and contains several articles which are\n\nThe Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo in 1948 would have lasting negative effects on Mexican Americans. The Treaty was signed after America had won the Mexican American war. America gained possession of the southwest states that had been part of Mexico for the price of around eighteen million dollars. In Article IX of the Treaty, it states that the Mexicans \"shall be maintained and protected in the free enjoyment of their liberty and property, and secured in the free exercise of their religion without restriction\"(Vargas 139). And as Rachel Rivera points out Article VII promised the Mexicans the right to keep their land which previously belonged to Mexico. However, the Treaty would not grant the\n\nWhen Andrew Jackson was denied presidency in 1824 due to “the corrupt bargain” between John Quincy Adams and Henry Clay, he was furious at the lack of democracy in the election system. He became determined to institute a new age of genuine democracy in America where the voice of the people wouldim being monarchal, Andrew Jackson was a very democratic president evidenced by his drive to give the people more representation and also his attempted transfer of power from the few to the many.\n\nThe novel The Pact which was read over the summer by Penn State students was considered interesting to some and dull to others. I personally enjoyed the book since I could relate to the book in more ways than one. The story takes pace in an inner city setting with three young men who become doctors and plan to give back to the community in any way they possibly can. The three young men are known as Sam, George and Rameck. Each of these characters posses a different personality which contributes to the book as a whole.\n\nIn Appiah’s first section, “Local Agreements,” he begins with an example from his own culture, about their values and actions concerning incest. This leads to his first argument, that it is not values which allow people to live in harmony with each other, but rather, the fact that their practices as a result of different values coincide. For this, he offers several illustrations, including the Muslim leadership of Spain and the Ottoman Empire, which still managed to include Jewish and Christian communities that lived in relative peace; this was not because they shared religious values, or even that they had similar reasons for acting in compatible ways, only that their actions allowed them to coexist. This leads to his next example, which is the Establishment Clause and the first amendment to the constitution, which offers freedom of religion to all people. There are many different reasons and values which people have that cause them to support this principle, but, in the end, it is not why they support the amendment which produces consensus in most of America, but, rather, the fact that they act in such a way as to uphold the freedom.\n\nSacrifice is indispensable in order to fulfill the needs of the many over the needs of the few (antithesis). Each member of society must play their part successfully in order for a government to prosper. In Lord of the Flies, by William Golding, a plane crashes into an uncharted island, stranding a group of schoolboys. Captive on an isolated island with no adults, the ideas of community and individualism quickly become apparent as the boys slowly adapt to an unfamiliar world. With Ralph elected as leader, the power of the conch shell, and the responsibilities assigned to each group, the boys appear to have created a successful society. However, as Jack disregards his responsibilities in order to play, society and structure falls apart. The events that transpire and Ralph’s goal for the group of boys is patently related to The Social Contract Theory, written by Jean-Jacques Rousseau. Similarly, the ideas of John Locke and Thomas Hobbes, other social contract theorists, also appear in Golding’s book. The basic idea of The Social Contract Theory is that one must sacrifice some of their individual freedoms for the greater good. Without sacrifice of one’s personal freedoms and failure to unite together towards a common goal, society and structure will collapse. Through the society the boys create on the island, Golding proves that the society on the island demonstrates ideas of The Social Contract Theory.\n\nThe Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo, signed in 1848, officially ended the war between Mexico and the United States. Even though it happened over 168 years ago, its legacy persists, because the treaty redefined the border and the border region. Under the terms of the treaty, Mexicans who suddenly found themselves living in the United States choose either Mexican citizenship, in which case they would have to relocate south of the new border, or to stay where they were and become citizens of the United States. About 80 percent—a total of seventy-five thousand Mexican people—remained in the United States (Passel, 2011). Since then, continuing economic and political difficulties in Mexico, combined with economic opportunities in the United States, have encouraged the flow of migration from Mexico to the United States in large numbers. Today, Mexican Americans are the fastest growing ethnic group in the United States and the estimated Mexican American population in 2000 was 20.6 million people, the largest Mexican population outside of Mexico (Center for Immigration Studies, 2010). Most Mexican Americans entered the United States legally and have become full U.S. citizens, however, the number of illegal immigrants arriving from Mexico has been an alarming and concerning issue in the United States and especially the state of Arizona. Arizona is in a unique geopolitical location in the United States because it shares a 370-mile border with Mexico. Much of the border is open and\n\nAfter reading The Four Agreements by Don Miguel Ruiz I realized I’ve been living dreams of other people in my life and not my own. It was decided early on what I should do, what’s possible and what’s not. Starting at birth we are told what to think by our parents, schools, and church. Subconsciously, we have made agreements with them to live our life according to their rules. Don Miguel believes that these agreements are self-limiting and shares four agreements that if we adapt into our lives we will reach true peace and happiness. The book made so much sense to me, but the hard part is to actually commit to living out the four agreements. In short, the four agreements are listed below:\n\nPaulo Coelho is a famous author that has written many popular works in these past few decades. He is most notably known for The Alchemist, which was written in 1988. The Alchemist was “one of the greatest best-sellers of all times” (Kaaki). During his lifetime, Coelho went through many obstacles; the most notable event was getting an electrical shock when he was in a mental institution and getting placed into prison. He was able to move past all of these difficulties and became a well-known author praised for his artistic creativity."
