        "text": "Miguel Ruiz\n\nToltec Nagual, Author, Medical Doctor\n\nMany authors have written about the Mexican Toltec tradition, some from personal experience, some from dreams or past lives, and others embracing similar indigenous traditions. Carlos Castaneda began sharing his stories in 1972, and his books ignited a fascination for the pursuit of Toltec knowledge. Théun Mares, Victor Sanchez, and Ken Eagle Feather have contributed abundantly to the genre. Many apprentices of Miguel Ruiz’s teach and have written powerful books of their own, including HeathAsh Amara, Sheri Rosenthal, Mary Carroll Nelson, Gini Gentry, Ray Dodd, Susan Gregg, and Allan Hardman of course.\n\nThe best-known representative of the Toltec wisdom in our times is don Miguel Ruiz. Miguel is the author of the international bestseller, The Four Agreements, as well as The Mastery of Love, The Voice of Knowledge, The Fifth Agreement (with his son José Luis Ruiz), The Circle of Fire, and released in late October 2015, The Toltec Art of Life and Death—based on his heart attack and nine week coma. His books have been translated into many languages and can be found all over the world. In the tradition of the Toltec, a Nagual (man/woman of power) guides an individual to personal freedom.\n\nMiguel Ruiz combines ancient wisdom with new insights and tools in a way that few others have done. He shows us how we can reveal the truth behind the “smoke” of our modern cultures, to free ourselves from self-rejection, social fears, and suffering. Miguel Ruiz offers common sense in his books and teaching, and shares it with such simplicity the universal message of his teaching is recognized by many people in many languages. Miguel’s message is simple, practical and when implemented, even in small doses, changes lives.\n\nDon Miguel was born into a big family in northern Mexico, and his curandera (healer) mother and his Nagual grandfather expected him to follow in the family Toltec traditions. Instead, he went to medical school and became a doctor. A near-death experience shocked him into questioning the very nature of his existence, so he returned to study with his mother. After a three year apprenticeship, don Miguel awakened to the truth of what he is, and began to share his love with others.\n\nWhen don Miguel came to the US, he quickly learned English and began to teach in his new language. At first he taught the esoteric traditions of his family, talking about luminous eggs and other fascinating topics. A time came when he began to question whether this esoteric knowledge was serving his apprentices. Miguel’s goal was to share love and teach about love and acceptance—the path to personal freedom. As his teaching began to change, his powerful and simple four agreements for personal transformation emerged and became a book in 1997.\n\nMiguel Ruiz taught and toured for many years, until a major heart attack in 2002 seemed to end his career. After a nine week coma he woke up and returned to a limited schedule of teaching and travel– all of it in constant pain. He said the pain could not stop him from enjoying life. His teaching became a message about always being happy—a choice we can make—even with great emotional or physical pain. A heart transplant in 2010 put him back into the life he was used to, and don Miguel’s teaching and travel schedule has been busier than ever.\n\nTwo of don Miguel’s sons are now teaching and writing about the Toltec path. José Luis Ruiz is the author of The Fifth Agreement, and Ripples of Wisdom. He teaches internationally and leads journeys to the Toltec pyramids in Mexico. Miguel Ruiz Jr. is also busy teaching and traveling, sharing his love and the Toltec wisdom. Miguel Jr. is the author of The Fifth Agreement and Living a Life of Awareness."
