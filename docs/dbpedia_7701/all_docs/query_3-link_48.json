It is just images in our imagination. It's a dream. We're dreaming constantly, and this has been known for centuries, not only in Mexico by the Toltec, but in Greece, in Rome, in India, and Egypt. Who is dreaming this story of your life? You are. If you don't like your life, if you don't like what you believe about yourself, you are the only one who can change it. It's your world, it's your dream.\" These are the words of don Miguel Ruiz. Ruiz initially shared four agreements: be impeccable with your word, don't take anything personally, don't make assumptions, and always do your best. In this dialogue we explore the fifth agreement: be skeptical, but learn to listen. (hosted by Michael Toms)\n\nBio\n\nDon Miguel Ruiz is a renowned and most beloved spiritual teacher dedicated to sharing wisdom and love through practical concepts in order to promote transformation and ultimately change lives for the better. He’s the youngest of 13 children, born in rural Mexico to parents who were healers and practitioners of ancient Toltec traditions. As a young adult, he graduated from medical school and practiced neurosurgery until a near-fatal car crash forever changed the direction of his life. Since then, he consistently delivers the deepest truths in the most relevant ways.\n\nDon Miguel Ruiz is the author of many books including:\n\nThe Four Agreements: A Practical Guide to Personal Freedom (Amber-Allen Publishing 1997)\n\nThe Fifth Agreement: A Practical Guide to Self-Mastery (Amber-Allan 2011), which is presented in collaboration with his son, don Jose Ruiz\n\nThe Toltec Art of Life and Death: A Story of Discovery (co-author Barbara Emerys) (HarperOne 2015)\n\nTo learn more about the work of don Miguel Ruiz go to www.miguelruiz.com.\n\nTopics Explored in This Dialogue\n\nWho are the Toltec\n\nWhat is the fifth agreement\n\nHow are we all messengers\n\nWhy the edifice of knowledge and symbols does not represent truth\n\nWhy the impeccability of our words are important\n\nWhat are the three attentions: victim, warrior, master\n\nHost: Michael Toms Interview Date: 7/8/2010 Program Number: 3365\n\nMusic Playlist\n\nFrom Album: Desert Dance\n\nArtist: R. Carlos Nakai\n\n1990 Ancient Harmonies #13033-2"
