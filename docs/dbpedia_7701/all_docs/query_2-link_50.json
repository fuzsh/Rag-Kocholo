        "text": "This 15 week course is an in-depth journey through this seemingly 'simple' book. We also use its accompanying workbook to really dig deep and find ways in which we can all begin to live our lives employing The Four Agreements as our guide. Take a journey led by don Miguel Ruiz and the teachings of the Toltecs.\n\n​\n\nScroll down to learn more about the course and click here to join us in September when we begin our journey - we hope you will consider joining us and find your own agreements and freedoms through releasing the past and the future - living in the present with impeccability.\n\n\"The youngest of thirteen children, don Miguel Ruiz was born in rural Mexico to parents who were healers and practitioners of ancient Toltec traditions. As a young adult, he graduated from medical school in Mexico City and practiced neurosurgery with his older brother in Tijuana. A near-fatal car crash forever changed the direction of his life, however, causing him to leave medicine and to examine the essential truth about life and humanity. With his mother’s help, and through her ancestral teachings, he discovered his own path to awareness, which evolved into a deep understanding of the physical universe and the virtual world of the mind. Combining Toltec mythology and scientific perspectives, don Miguel has been able to merge ancient wisdom with modern physics and practical common-sense, forging a new philosophy for seekers of truth and personal authenticity. His landmark bestselling book, The Four Agreements, contains practical steps for long-term, personal transformation and has been read by millions around the world.\"\n\n\"In The Four Agreements, don Miguel Ruiz reveals the source of self-limiting beliefs that rob us of joy and create needless suffering. Based on ancient Toltec wisdom, The Four Agreements offer a powerful code of conduct that can rapidly transform our lives to a new experience of freedom, true happiness, and love.\"\n\n​\n\n\"The Four Agreements introduced a simple, but powerful code of conduct for attaining personal freedom and true happiness. Now The Four Agreements Companion Book takes you even further along the journey to recover the awarenss and wisdom of your authentic self. This companion book is a must-read not only for those who enjoyed don Miguel's first book, but for anyone who is ready to leave suffering behind, and to master the art of living in our natural state: happiness.\""
