        "text": "The Four Agreements – A practical Guide to Personal Freedom\n\nA Toltec Wisdom Book by Don Miguel Ruiz\n\nI discovered this book in a random article on Medium.com. This book is again a deviation for me from my normal reading list to a spiritual one. It is also my first one from a Mexican (what a transition after a Japanese!).\n\nWas I ready for a discourse while reading this book? No. I would have dropped this book in the first 20 pages, had it been a discourse and I was reading this book with a doubt in my mind. However, it turned out to be more of a discovery, where I could freely disagree with some stuff and agree with other, thus forming my own opinion and path to the person freedom as discussed and not prescribed in the book.\n\nWhat is beautiful about this book is the concept of domestication & personal freedom and how it is explained in the Toltec wisdom. Imagine, you have a back pain, you visit a Doc A, this doc checks your back, thinks to himself for a moment, and then prescribes the apt vitamins and physio sessions. Then you visit Doc B, he checks your back, then expresses concern over how bad it is, he then explains how years of bad posture and sedentary lifestyle led to this, he then explains how things need to be put together now to repair the bad stuff and why it needs to be done on priority and then prescribes the same vitamins and physio sessions. Finally, he explains how they are going to attack the pain points and alleviate the pain. Customer Satisfaction Guaranteed. Doc B is the experience of reading The Four agreements in the context of personal freedom.\n\nThere are moments of disbelief. This man is a Shaman, after all and I am in Sales. An unstoppable force and immovable mountain situation. There were moments, where one pauses to measure what is being said, Is it possible? Maybe this guy is talking about Utopia? Is he high? But if one is open and willing to accept, then they will find themselves highlighting for later use, scores of paragraphs in this one.\n\nThe writing is beautiful, simple and very engaging. I always thought I liked the story telling style of writing until I discovered this. Things are explained directly and very upfront with no extra attempt made, to “make you understand” and give “eureka moments”.\n\nSo, Don Miguel Ruiz is a shaman who was a surgeon but went back to his Toltec roots when he had an epiphany after a near death experience. Had I known this before I read this book, I would have probably not read or trusted it. For practical audience like me, Mr. Miguel should remove this anecdote from his bio and promotional deck, but I think this fuels the spiritual leader part of the game.\n\nBook is certainly heavily priced at Rs 224/- on Kindle. The paperback is worth Rs 195!! and free with Audible Trial, which is also free!! Please imagine angry emoticon looking at Mr. Bezos and asking why he bought a Kindle.\n\n#honestbookreviews #nospoilers"
