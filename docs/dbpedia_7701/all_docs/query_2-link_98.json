        "text": "Outside Mexico City lies the ancient pyramid complex of Teotihuacan, which, according to the oral tradition of the Ruiz family, is the spiritual center for the Toltec people. For over twenty years, Don Miguel Ruiz Jr. has been traveling to Teotihuacan to teach others about the powerful mysteries found there.\n\nIn The Mastery of Life, Ruiz explains how the sacred pyramids and plazas of Teotihuacan act as symbolic stops on the transformative path of Toltec Warriors—those who apply the teachings of the Toltecs in their own lives to win the inner war against the forces of domestication, fear, and self-judgment. At the same time, he guides you on your own inner journey, helping you to experience firsthand the transformative power of the Toltec teachings without ever leaving the comfort of your own home. Each chapter contains practical exercises and reflections designed to help you find peace and personal freedom in your own life, right now.\n\n“The greatest journey you can take is the one within yourself.” -- Don Miguel Ruiz Jr."
