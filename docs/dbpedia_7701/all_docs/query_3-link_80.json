        "text": "Negotiating Conquest is a scholarly work written by Miroslava Chavez-Garcia, which analyzes women 's roles in history, and discusses how the political system has affected their roles. It covers the period between the 1770 's to the 1880 's, the periods before and after American Conquest. Likewise, this book is divided into two sections, chapters 1-3 discusses \"Women in Spanish and Mexican California,\" and chapters 4-6 discusses \"Women in American California.\" This work analyzes the major ideas present within each period and how it affected women 's roles and power. The time and effort put into this book, is something that the author enjoyed, calling it a \"labor of love.\" Overall, she then claims that her purpose in writing this work is to, \"honor and recognize woman of all ethnic backgrounds, social classes, and regions, who established households, nurtured and reared families, and rose above personal adversity in societies that often ignored, overlooked, and rendered them invisible.\"\n\nImagine a room full of 30 plus 12th-grade colonists on the first day of school at Anaheim high school and the math teacher asks what is the square root of 16? Nothing but the noise of sheer silence falls across the room. How can a room full of students that have been going to school for 12 years not answer that simple question and how can we increase the success of students that go Anaheim high school? In order to increase the success of students at Anaheim schools the summer has to be shorter and the days longer. In the article “Marita’s bargain” the author Gladwell explains how time is used in regular schools compared to the KIPP Academy in the Bronx and other school systems with short summers and longer days.The article shows how more time\n\nThe phenomenal success of the book \"The Four Agreements\" has inspired many to apply Don Miguel Ruiz's insights in all areas of life. As you've attempted to understand how the four agreements relate to your life, you've undoubtedly run up against some resistance. It's one thing to understand the four agreements intellectually and even to agree with them and decide to put them into practice. It's another thing to apply them in real-life situations.\n\nThe Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo in 1948 would have lasting negative effects on Mexican Americans. The Treaty was signed after America had won the Mexican American war. America gained possession of the southwest states that had been part of Mexico for the price of around eighteen million dollars. In Article IX of the Treaty, it states that the Mexicans \"shall be maintained and protected in the free enjoyment of their liberty and property, and secured in the free exercise of their religion without restriction\"(Vargas 139). And as Rachel Rivera points out Article VII promised the Mexicans the right to keep their land which previously belonged to Mexico. However, the Treaty would not grant the\n\nWhen Andrew Jackson was denied presidency in 1824 due to “the corrupt bargain” between John Quincy Adams and Henry Clay, he was furious at the lack of democracy in the election system. He became determined to institute a new age of genuine democracy in America where the voice of the people wouldim being monarchal, Andrew Jackson was a very democratic president evidenced by his drive to give the people more representation and also his attempted transfer of power from the few to the many.\n\nIn Appiah’s first section, “Local Agreements,” he begins with an example from his own culture, about their values and actions concerning incest. This leads to his first argument, that it is not values which allow people to live in harmony with each other, but rather, the fact that their practices as a result of different values coincide. For this, he offers several illustrations, including the Muslim leadership of Spain and the Ottoman Empire, which still managed to include Jewish and Christian communities that lived in relative peace; this was not because they shared religious values, or even that they had similar reasons for acting in compatible ways, only that their actions allowed them to coexist. This leads to his next example, which is the Establishment Clause and the first amendment to the constitution, which offers freedom of religion to all people. There are many different reasons and values which people have that cause them to support this principle, but, in the end, it is not why they support the amendment which produces consensus in most of America, but, rather, the fact that they act in such a way as to uphold the freedom.\n\nSkyrms ' book, Evolution of the Social Contract, offers a compelling explanation as to why individuals, when placed with one-shot prisoner 's dilemmas, will often cooperate, or choose the equilibrium that will benefit both parties equally. He uses examples to outline how individuals of certain environments frequently engage in activities that benefit the group at their own personal expense. Using both game theory and decision theory, Skyrms explores problems with the social contract when it is applied to evolutionary dynamics. In the chapters of the book, he offers new insights into concepts such as sex and justice, commitment, and mutual aid.\n\nIn Eyewitnesstohistory.com, Signing the Treaty of Versaille the author briefly explains both sides of the story during the Paris Peace Conference from how cruel and unfair it was to the Germans while showcasing the naivety and ignorant belief of the Allied forces as they have complete faith in the true ending of the war. President Woodrow Wilson presented multiple options such as the Fourteen Points and the League of Nations. However, many disagreed with Wilson’s ideals and this and many other disputes led to anger during the creation of the treaty. Despite this, “The Big Four” came up with the German’s punishment which was stripping a large collection of the German army and the pre-war territory while being forced to pay war reparations. In\n\nReading “The Fifth Agreement: A Practical Guide to Self-Mastery to me was just like reading every other book. I never thought it was going to make a huge impact in my life. It made me understood more about life and I was able to reflect my entire life to the book. One basic concept I came to understand was the real meaning of Truth and how it plays a very important role in my life. It also made me understand that there is a difference between the real truth and the virtual truth.\n\nDream Skepticism has been debated largely since Descartes’ projection of those ideas. Descartes believed many irrational thoughts in relation to dreaming, which proposed ideas that nobody at his time had ever seen before. Descartes’ challenging of the traditional ideas and proposing new ones in which challenged the minds of the individuals, as well as trying to convince the masses that dreaming had some sort of value for an individual that would carry on into his conscious world. Throughout these different ideas lied his main notion: the dreams produced in the human brain while unconscious are not false or fiction, rather, they present the truths that lie in our very minds and therefor should hold value to the dreamer himself. Descartes believed\n\nIn conclusion, after I read this book I realized about harmony with methodology of many other transformational techniques in human. Ruiz breaks down the four agreements into simple language with spirit. He emphasizes that just doing your best in everything will help you to keep the other three agreements include being impeccable with your word, don’t take anything personal, don’t make assumption. I hope I can follow the four agreements and persistently practice for living a powerful and happy life. In addition, I will encourage the others to do the same.\n\nIt is apparent by the citizens of Malaysia that Sabah and Sarawak are handled differently from the other states in West Malaysia. This is due to the Malaysia Agreement which is an agreement between Peninsular Malaya, Sabah, Sarawak, Singapore and the British Colonial government to form the Federation of Malaysia. During the negotiation period before 16 September 1963, Sarawak proposed its terms for its incorporation into Malaysia to safeguard the special rights and autonomy of Sarawak and its citizens. The foundation of the 18 Point Agreement was laid by the Nine Cardinal Principles formed by the English Rajah in 1941."
