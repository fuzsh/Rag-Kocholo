        "text": "Don Miguel Ruiz, was born into a humble family with ancient traditions in rural Mexico. This was where he learned from an early age that everything we really want is possible.\n\nDon Miiguel attended medical school soon realizing that what is needed to be healed was not only the physical brain, but the human mind as well.\n\nMiguel returned to his family legacy in the centuries old Toltec tradition to became a Shaman. He spent the next 15 years exploring ways to heal and change the human mind. The result was The Four Agreements, a specific series of practical steps that can result in consistent and long-term personal transformation.\n\nIn 2010 he successfully received a heart transplant. For Don Miguel this is a new beginning, and with deep gratitude and generosity he is eager to share his message with all humanity"
