        "text": "Aloha All,\n\nHave you heard of Don Miguel Ruiz? According to Wikipedia he's \"Mexican author of Toltec spiritual and neoshamanistic texts...that focuses on ancient teachings as a means to achieve spiritual enlightenment.\"\n\nHe's most famous for his work \"The Four Agreements\", later of which he added a fifth agreement.\n\nIn this article I'd love to introduce you to that work and how to apply it to Conscious Leadership. This is meant to be a brief overview of the agreements and in the following five weeks I will be going through each agreement in more depth.\n\nLet's get into it!\n\nDon Miguel Ruiz's Five Agreements\n\nAgreement One: Be Impeccable With Your Word.\n\nAgreement Two: Don't Take Anything Personally.\n\nAgreement Three: Don't Make Assumptions.\n\nAgreement Four: Always Do Your Best.\n\nAgreement Five: Be Sceptical, But Learn To Listen.\n\nEach of these agreements, follow on and support the preceeding agreement(s). So let's dive into each a little more.\n\n#1 Be Impeccable With Your Word\n\nBeing impeccable with your word is making sure that what you say is true, keep your agreements, don't lie or mislead with your word. Be kind with your words. It's an act of integrity to be able to be impeccable with your word.\n\nYour word is incredibly powerful and it can create something destructive or something constructive. Your word not only influences you, but influences all those around you. So choose your words carefully. Choose your words to be in alignment to the vision you hold for a more positive world.\n\nWant to learn more about agreement one? Click here to dive in deeper!\n\n#2 Don't Take Anything Personally\n\nDon't take anything personally speaks for itself. Stop assuming that people actually care that much about you that they would bother to make something personal. If they do, it's their problem not yours.\n\nWhen you can master this, you free up so much energy and time to use to focus on what you do want to create! And, bonus, you have a far better experience of life! No more being offended by words or actions of others, let that just slide off of your back and refocus to your far more important vision for this world.\n\nWant to learn more about agreement two? Click here to dive in deeper!\n\n#3 Don't Make Assumptions\n\nDon't make assumptions basically just means, don't make up stories! Because that's what assumptions are - stories, that have no real evidence behind them.\n\nThe thing with assumptions is that they have a snowball effect - when you make one assumption, it usually rolls into another one and another one, until you have reached a conclusion that is completely without evidence and usually catastrophised!\n\nAssumptions... have a snowball effect...until you reached a conclusion that is...catastrophised\n\nNow this is based off of the assumption, that I have that you are thinking of \"bad assumptions\". Good assumptions have the opposite effect! So if you \"need\" to have an assumption, adopt good assumptions!\n\nStop assuming and concentrate on being here NOW and facing the truth that is right in front of you.\n\nEither way though, with assumptions, is that you usually aren't seeing the truth of NOW. And it's in this moment NOW that you can effect any change. So stop assuming and concentrate on being here NOW and facing the truth that is right in front of you.\n\nWant to learn more about agreement three? Click here to dive in deeper!\n\n#4 Always Do Your Best\n\nAlways do your best, means just that. Don't do it half-arsed. Don't waste your energy kicking and screaming through the mud, just do it. And do it well.\n\nThis ties into agreements one, two and three - if you're doing your best, you're being impeccable with your word, you aren't taking things personally (you're just getting on with it) and you aren't making assumptions about others or yourself.\n\nYou are the only one that knows what your \"best\" is [and] your best can change from moment to moment\n\nYou are the only one that knows what your \"best\" is, no one else can tell you. And one more thing - your best can change from moment to moment and only you will know!\n\nWant to learn more about agreement four? Click here to dive in deeper!\n\n#5 Be Sceptical But Learn to Listen\n\nBe sceptical but learn to listen. Got it? Good! But, really, we are advocating for a healthy dose of scepticism here - not just a paranoid, don't-believe-anything-they-say, kind of scepticism. Be a sceptic and ask questions.\n\nA \"good sceptic\" is one who has an earnest motivation to find the truth. Whatever that truth may be. At the same time, if you want to be a \"good sceptic\" you need to learn to listen.\n\nJust as we learnt in agreement four - don't make assumptions - you can't assume anything someone says is truth, you have to get behind what they're really saying to get to the true meaning of their words AND you have to get beyond your own assumptions that could block you from truly listening and finding the truth. Also, truth is changeable.\n\nRemain a sceptic, but continue to listen. This is what allows you to continue to grow!\n\nSo remain a sceptic, but continue to listen. This is what allows you to continue to grow!\n\nWant to learn more about agreement five? Click here to dive in deeper!\n\nSo Conscious Leader, out of those five agreements, which of them do you think you have to concentrate more on? Remember each of these, feed into the next and they require your honesty!\n\nAnd lastly, know that you know your areas of improvement, how are you going to action these in your workplace?\n\nHere for your constant evolution,\n\nArohanui,\n\nNik Chung\n\nPs.
