        "text": "Miguel Hernandez-Ruiz was arraigned Friday, April 19 on multiple charges including first-degree criminal sexual conduct involving a child under the age of 13 and home invasion.\n\nCourt documents obtained by FOX 17 show that the two girls told investigators the man held them in their rooms at the Sweet Lake Mobile Home Park off US-12 in the early morning hours of March 20.\n\nREAD: Man arrested on allegations of sexually assaulting girls near Sturgis\n\nThe sisters, who are both under the age of 13, say the man threatened to kill them if they tried to scream or escape. The girls claim he used his hands to sexually assault them while exposing himself.\n\nAn evaluation by trained medical staff revealed evidence of sexual assault on both girls' bodies.\n\nAfter days of investigating, family and detectives were able to establish that Hernandez-Ruiz had visited the home roughly a month before the assault. Surveillance video showed a vehicle he was known to drive was the only one captured entering and leaving the neighborhood around the time of the home invasion.\n\nInvestigators tracked the vehicle to Shipshewana, Indiana one day later.\n\nHernandez-Ruiz wasn't arrested until early April in Fort Wayne, Indiana, more than two weeks after the assault.\n\nThe St. Joseph County Sheriff's previously told FOX 17 that Hernandez-Ruiz is a citizen of Mexico. Friday in court, the prosecutor told the judge he is in violation of his agricultural worker permit.\n\n\"I don't believe that this person will follow any of the rules of bond if he doesn't get a bond,\" the prosecutor said. He went on to explain that Hernandez-Ruiz's permit only permited him to be in the U.S. from late August throught he end of the summer to work agricultural jobs. According to the prosecutor, the 25-year-old had not been following those rules for several years by staying in the county.\n\nThe Hernandez-Ruiz's court-appointed attorney told the judge his client works at a facility in Shipshewana.\n\nThe judge denied bond.\n\nSt. Joseph County officials held a press conference Friday. Watch it in full below.\n\nMexican citizen charged with sexually assaulting underage girls in St. Joseph County\n\nChildren's Advocacy Centers (CACs) serve children and adolescents who are believed to be victims of abuse â€” most frequently, sexual abuse.\n\n**If you or someone you know may be a victim, help is available.
