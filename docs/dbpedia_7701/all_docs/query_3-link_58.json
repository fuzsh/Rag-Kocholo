        "text": "An Unprecedented Opportunity\n\nto Awaken to a Deeper Life\n\nWe at The Shift Network feel deeply honored that don Miguel Ruiz and transformational leaders of the Ruiz family have chosen to partner with us on one of their first LIVE online trainings.

But you’ll be able to benefit from his incredible teachings and transmission from the comfort of your home – at your own pace!\n\nIf you are serious about your spiritual evolution and awakening, you owe it to yourself, your loved ones and our world to take this one-of-a-kind training with don Miguel Ruiz, his partner Eva, and two sons – don Miguel Jr. and don Jose.\n\nIf you’re ready to awaken unconditional love and live your life as a masterpiece, click the register button below to reserve your space now.\n\nMore Praise for don Miguel Ruiz and The Four Agreements Work...\n\n\"I Thank-you from the bottom of my heart... Without your teachings nothing made sense... \"The Mastery Of Love\" is teaching me that I have the power to Love freely & without feeling undeserving & fearful. I will continue reading & learning & healing.\"\n\n-Faye\n\n\"Thank you for your amazing words and knowledge. I read the Four Agreements last year. I read a chapter then let it sink in, I would put your words into practice, then I would go on to the next chapter. The book changed my perception on the world around me, I was seeing the world with a new pair of eyes. Everyday is a blessing and I am thankful to have you in my life. Thank you Mr. Ruiz!\"\n\n-Mike\n\n\"My deepest gratitude to you, don Miguel, Sr. for all that you have taught me over these years. My gratitude to your sons for carrying on the work of the Toltec masters. May you all reap the rewards of your blessed work, each and everyday that you live. In deepest gratitude.\"\n\n-Pamela\n\n\"The magic of the evening was palpable. It was as if all of our hearts were beating as one as we joined together to share Love and Truth.\"\n\n-KAYA\n\n\"Line in the Sand was one of the most inspirational experiences of my life. There are so many lines that I’ve created in my life that hold me back from experiencing what I truly want. The stories. The assumptions. The lies. Crossing over those barriers in my mind has freed me to become who I’ve always been. The journey is incredible. It’s fun, it’s freedom, it’s happiness. On all my retreats so far, I’ve experienced something unique and totally inspirational with the Ruiz’s\".\n\n-Laurie\n\n\"I learned more about myself than I have in a lifetime.The lessons I learned from the lectures from Miguel, Jose and Mikey will be with me for years to come. The most interesting part is although I had wonderful teachers to guide me, share their knowledge with me, and mirror my own loving self back to me, one of the most important teachers was myself. Thank you for a truly amazing experience. \"\n\n-Megan\n\n\"The four Agreements\" is a fantastic book and it helps me lots to improve my life! Thank you so much Don Miguel.”\n\n-Elena\n\nAbout Your Teachers\n\ndon Miguel Ruiz is the international bestselling author of a series of books including The Four Agreements (over 7 years on The New York Times bestseller list), and the 36th bestselling book of the decade.\n\nHe has dedicated his life to sharing the wisdom of the ancient Toltec through his books, lectures, and journeys to sacred sites around the world. Other books include: The Mastery of Love, The Voice of Knowledge, Prayers, Beyond Fear and The Fifth Agreement, a collaboration with his son don Jose Ruiz.\n\nHe has received numerous recognitions, including a US Air Force challenge coin engraved with The Four Agreements, and he is referenced as a National Heirloom of Mexico. ‘Please help us change the world’! Only you can change the world that you create, and by changing your world, the world will change ‘and that is the Truth that will set you free’.\n\nEva Charlotte Ruiz Larsson is an inspirational speaker and life-empowerment coach who profoundly impacts people with her engaging presence and message. Originally from Sweden and after many years of a successful as a computer consultant, a near fatal skydiving accident changed her life:\n\nShe says about this experience: “In a moment of intense clarity, I experienced myself as Life itself, as infinite love, faith, and wisdom. I was completely at peace with everything, including the death of my physical body, which was fast-approaching. I knew that I am that which I had been searching for. I understood that I am the creator of my life experience, not the victim of it – and in that moment, I made a choice with all of my power to live my life fully – to be happy, healthy, and truly alive. Miraculously, I survived the accident!”\n\nSoon thereafter, Eva left the business world and began an intense self-inquiry, wanting to return to the place of authenticity and for the next 15 years, she studied with different masters from all over the world, exploring ancient and modern traditions, techniques and therapies. She ran her own consulting business for individuals and businesses, taught yoga and meditation, and held lectures and workshops.\n\nHaving completely transformed, she still searched for the authenticity and freedom that she longed for and had experienced while skydiving. Eva decided to close down her life in Sweden, sell all of her possessions, and set out on a journey around the world. On her very first stop, she ran into don Miguel Ruiz, author of The New York Times bestseller The Four Agreements, and was later chosen for an individual, intensive training that lasted for five years and continues to this day.\n\ndon Miguel Ruiz Jr When he was only 14 years old, don Miguel Ruiz Jr. apprenticed to his father don Miguel Sr. and his grandmother, Madre Sarita, to learn how they manifested their intent to heal people, both physically and spiritually. When he reached his mid-20s, after 10 years of apprenticeship, his father intensified his training. This training culminated one day when don Miguel Ruiz Sr. sent his eldest son out in the world, saying, “Find your way out. Go home and master Death by becoming alive.”\n\nFor the past six years, don Miguel Jr. has applied the lessons learned from his father and grandmother to define and enjoy his own personal freedom while achieving peace with all of creation. As a Nagual, Miguel Jr. is finally ready to pass along the wisdom and the tools of his family’s traditions.\n\nAlong with his father, don Miguel Ruiz Sr., and brother, don Jose Ruiz, don Miguel Jr. leads workshops, retreats and power journeys to help others to achieve their own personal freedom and optimal physical and spiritual health. He also hosts a successful weekly internet radio show, “The Way of the Desert.”\n\ndon Jose Ruiz In 2010, Don Jose Ruiz released his first book titled The Fifth Agreement in partnership with his father, Don Miguel Ruiz. Following this publication, don Jose began traveling around the US, Mexico and South America, inspiring people in many different ways including book signings, lectures, seminars and hosting intensive journeys to Teotihuacan and other sacred sites around the world.\n\nAmong a few of the highlights, don Jose has been asked to speak at conferences such as Conversations Among Masters, Celebrate Your Life and Conscious Life Expo. At these conferences, he has spoken alongside Dr. Wayne Dyer, Rev. Michael Beckwith, Caroline Myss and Gregg Braden. He has been interviewed by many notable media publications, including the LA Times, Univision, Fox News and Eckhart Tolle Television.\n\nDon Jose’s message and The Fifth Agreement is rapidly growing and being shared around the world. His message is changing lives and is bringing people closer to themselves more than ever before. His passion is to help children stay away from gangs and drugs by developing a healthy outlet such as learning to play a musical instrument as well as develop other creative avenues. He will continue to share the wisdom of his family lineage through his own life experiences.\n\nFrequently Asked Questions\n\nQ: What is a virtual course?\n\nA: It’s a great way to engage live teachings and each other from the comfort of your home!
