        "text": "Don Miguel Ruiz is a Mexican author of Toltec spiritualist and neoshamanistic texts. Members of the New Thought movement primarily focused on old teachings, meant to achieve spiritual enlightenment, appreciate and follow his work. The youngest of 13 siblings, Ruiz had a near-death experience that made him rethink his career as a surgeon. His most popular work, “The Four Agreements,” sold millions of copies and was translated into 46 languages."
