        "text": "SANAA, Yemen\n\nAfter nearly nine years of war in Yemen, control of the country's territory stands divided between three major players: The internationally recognized government, Houthi rebels, and the separatist Southern Transitional Council (STC).\n\nAs optimism is on the rise for restoring peace in the war-torn country following talks in the capital Sanaa, the Saudi-backed government is estimated to control about 55% of Yemen, while the Houthis hold about 25% and the STC about 20%, totaling an approximate 550,000 square kilometers (about 212,000 sq miles).\n\nDespite covering just a quarter of the country's land, Iran-aligned rebel-held areas include the vast majority of Yemen's northern population centers, where roughly half of the nation's 32 million people live.\n\nOn the other hand, the Saudi-backed government controls the country's oil and gas fields in the southern provinces of Marib and Hadhramaut further east, while the STC, supported by the United Arab Emirates (UAE), holds the southern economic capital of Yemen, Aden.\n\nVital institutions are also located in the capital, held by the Houthis, including international organizations like the UN country headquarters and telecommunications and internet companies.\n\nSanaa also hosted Omani-mediated talks over the weekend between Saudi Arabia and the Houthis, following a thaw in relations between Riyadh and Tehran last month.\n\nYemen's Information Minister Moammar al-Eryani on Monday hailed the atmosphere in the country as \"more favorable than any time before to restore peace in Yemen.\"\n\nComplete governmental control\n\nThe internationally recognized government has full control of several provinces. Most notably the largest province in terms of area, Hadhramaut.\n\nHadhramaut contains several important archaeological, coastal, and tourist cities, such as Mukalla, Seiyun, Shibam, Tarim, and Al-Shihr. It is also rich in oil and is a center of commercial activity.\n\nThe government also controls the easternmost province Al Mahrah, which is also the second-largest in terms of area, on the border with Oman.\n\nSaudi forces are also deployed in Al Mahrah. The Al Ghaydah International Airport and the ports of Nishtun and Ash Shihr are also located in the province.\n\nPartial governmental control\n\nControl in central Marib, where the majority of Yemen's oil- and gas-rich areas are found, is contested mostly between the government and the Houthis.\n\nGovernment reports indicate that the provincial capital, also called Marib, hosts more than 2 million out of 4.5 million displaced people in the country.\n\nSince the beginning of February 2021, the Houthis have intensified their attacks on the city, which hosts the headquarters of the Ministry of Defense.\n\nThe government also controls most of Lahij, while Houthis also hold parts of the southwestern province.\n\nThe situation is similar in the neighboring provinces of Dhale and Taiz, where pro-government forces control most districts.\n\nComplete Houthi control\n\nHouthi rebels hold several regions in northern Yemen, most notably the capital Sanaa, which was captured by the group in September 2014, two months after taking over neighboring Amran.\n\nSanaa is the most important city in Yemen, as it is home to the most crucial state institutions, the telecommunications sector, and many companies and factories that bring generate revenue for the Houthis.\n\nThe rebels also control the entirety of the Dhamar, Al Bayda, Ibb, Raymah, Al Mahwit, and Amran provinces.\n\nPartial Houthi control\n\nSeveral provinces are mostly controlled by the Houthis, including the strategic coastal Al-Hudaydah in the west, home to one of Yemen's most important ports, through which about 70% of the country's imports and foreign aid pass.\n\nGovernment forces control some of the province's districts, such as Al Khawkhah and Hays.\n\nComplete STC control\n\nEstablished in 2017, the UAE-backed STC holds all of Aden province, the temporary capital of the internationally recognized government.\n\nAden has been controlled by the STC, which wants southern Yemen to secede from the north, since August 2019 following confrontations with government forces.\n\nThe province is the second-most important in Yemen after Sanaa, as it was considered the economic capital of the country before the war broke out in 2014.\n\nSince June 2020, the STC has also controlled the strategic island province of Socotra, overlooking the Indian Ocean southeast of mainland Yemen. It is also the largest Arab island in the world.\n\nThe STC controls Shabwah province, which contains the Balhaf natural gas liquefaction plant, critical to Yemen's economy and its LNG exports.\n\nPartial STC control\n\nThe STC shares control of the Abyan, Dhale, and Lahij Governorates with the government.\n\n*Ikram Kouachi contributed to this report."
