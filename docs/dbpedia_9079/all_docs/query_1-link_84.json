        "text": "Safety and security\n\nSecurity situation\n\nDespite truce agreements, the security situation in Yemen remains highly unstable and unpredictable due to the ongoing civil war that started in 2014. The state of emergency declared in March 2011 remains in effect.\n\nArmed terrorist and criminal groups are still active in many parts of the country, particularly in the south.\n\nThe humanitarian situation remains extremely precarious in the country due to several years of armed clashes between rebels and a coalition led by neighboring countries that conducted airstrikes on territories held by rebels in western and northern Yemen. The conflict led to the displacement of millions of people and significant disruptions to the availability of essential services and goods such as:\n\nfood\n\nwater\n\nmedical supplies\n\npower distribution\n\nhealth care\n\nsanitation\n\nThere is severe damage to critical infrastructure, including hospitals.\n\nThe Government of Canada has urged Canadians to leave Yemen since May 2009 and continues to advise against all travel to Yemen. Commercial means to leave the country are extremely limited. If the armed conflict intensifies it could impact your ability to depart the country by commercial means.\n\nYour safety continues to be at risk in Yemen due to war, terrorism, and kidnapping. The Government of Canada’s ability to provide consular assistance and other support in Yemen is extremely limited.\n\nDo not travel to Yemen. If you choose to travel to Yemen, or remain in the country, despite this advisory:\n\nseek safe shelter and remain there until you can identify safe means to exit\n\nmaintain emergency provisions such as water and food\n\nexercise extreme caution at all times\n\nalways be aware of your surroundings\n\nkeep in mind that you are responsible for your own safety and that of your family\n\nensure that your travel documents are up-to-date\n\nmonitor local and international media to stay informed of the situation\n\nRegional conflicts\n\nSince November 2023, rebels regularly conduct attacks against commercial vessels in the Red Sea with drones and missiles. In response, since January 2024, a US-led coalition has conducted air strikes on rebel-controlled positions in western and northern Yemen, including the cities of Hajjah, Taiz, Hodeidah and Sanaa.\n\nDuring the civil war between rebels and government forces, armed rebels in Yemen have targeted neighbouring countries, such as Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates, in retaliation for their involvement in the war in Yemen. The April 2022 truce significantly reduced the violence in the country and in the region, but there is still no agreement to end the civil war. There is a continued risk of internal armed conflict and a heightened risk of attacks targeting western interests in Yemen and in the region.\n\nDue to security risks, the Government of Canada cannot provide assistance to citizens trying to leave Yemen by land to Saudi Arabia.\n\nTerrorism\n\nThere is a high threat of terrorism. Terrorists have targeted Western interests and Yemeni government buildings. Terrorist groups also target checkpoints manned by the Houthi rebel group in Sanaa and elsewhere in the country, and target Houthis in general.\n\nTerrorist attacks could occur at any time.\n\nOther targets could include:\n\ngovernment buildings, including schools\n\nplaces of worship\n\nairports and other transportation hubs and networks\n\npublic areas such as tourist attractions, restaurants, bars, coffee shops, shopping centres, markets, hotels and other sites frequented by foreigners\n\nAlways be aware of your surroundings when in public places. Exercise extreme caution, particularly in areas known to be frequented by foreigners.\n\nBe particularly vigilant during:\n\nreligious holidays\n\npublic celebrations\n\nmajor political events, such as elections\n\nTerrorists may use such occasions to mount attacks.\n\nExercise extreme caution, particularly in areas known to be frequented by foreigners.\n\nKidnapping\n\nThere is a high risk of kidnapping, especially on the highway connecting the cities of Sanaa, Ta’izz and Aden. Foreigners have been targeted. Some hostages have been killed.\n\nBe extremely vigilant at all times\n\nAvoid travelling on the Sanaa– Ta’izz –Aden highway\n\nUse varied and unpredictable travel routes and schedules\n\nDemonstrations and civil unrest\n\nDemonstrations take place frequently due to the ongoing conflict throughout the country.\n\nEven peaceful demonstrations can turn violent at any time. They can also lead to disruptions to traffic and public transportation.\n\nAvoid areas where demonstrations and large gatherings are taking place\n\nFollow the instructions of local authorities\n\nMonitor local media for information on ongoing demonstrations\n\nMass gatherings (large-scale events)\n\nLandmines\n\nLandmines and unexploded munitions remain a danger in the southern and eastern areas of the country, particularly around Aden, and in the central highlands. Most have been marked and access clearly delimited.\n\nExercise caution in these areas\n\nLook for posted landmine warnings\n\nStay on paved roads\n\nAvoid walking or hiking in these areas\n\nCrime\n\nViolent crime\n\nCar bombs and drones have been used in assassinations.\n\nExercise a high level of personal security awareness at all times.\n\nPetty crime\n\nPetty crime, such as pickpocketing and purse snatching, occurs. Although credit cards are rarely accepted, scams may also occur.\n\nCarjacking is a serious concern in Yemen.\n\nDon’t show signs of affluence\n\nAvoid travelling at night\n\nLock car doors and ensure that windows are closed at all times\n\nEnsure that personal belongings and passports and other travel documents are secure at all times\n\nWomen’s safety\n\nWomen travelling alone have been subject to different types of harassment, verbal abuse, or physical assaults.\n\nIf you are the victim of a sexual assault, you should report it immediately to the nearest Government of Canada office.\n\nAvoid travelling alone, especially at night\n\nRemain particularly vigilant in less populous areas\n\nBe careful when dealing with strangers or recent acquaintances\n\nAdvice for women travellers\n\nShortages\n\nFuel\n\nThere is a shortage of fuel in Yemen. You may have difficulty securing fuel. Fuel and diesel shortages could impact sectors and services such as:\n\ntransport\n\ntelecommunication, including internet\n\nwater and waste collection\n\nshops, cafes and restaurants\n\nPower\n\nPower shortages often occur.\n\nNot all businesses are equipped with a generator. As a result, shortages could affect essential services such as:\n\nhealth care services\n\nfood production\n\ngoods distribution\n\nFood\n\nCertain parts of Yemen are experiencing famine. If food is available, it can be expensive because most of the country’s food is imported.\n\nPlan to have adequate water, food and fuel supplies.\n\nRoad safety\n\nRoad conditions and road safety are poor throughout the country.\n\nDrivers may not respect traffic laws and may often drive on the wrong side of the road. Vehicles are poorly maintained. Roaming animals also pose hazards.\n\nRoadblocks and checkpoints may be set up without warning. Local authorities may close access to certain areas without notice.\n\nIf you are involved in an accident resulting in death or injuries, you may be jailed or fined. Compensation has to be paid to the family of any victim.\n\nIf you chose to drive in Yemen:\n\nundertake overland travel in a convoy of four-wheel-drive vehicles and with an experienced guide only\n\navoid driving after dark\n\nleave a travel itinerary with a third party\n\nbe well prepared and equipped with gasoline, water, food and a cell phone\n\navoid renting a car and driving it yourself\n\ncall the police if involved in an accident\n\nPublic transportation\n\nPublic transportation is unsafe and unreliable.\n\nBuses\n\nMinibuses service – known as dabaabs – is available in most major cities. However, many bus drivers aren’t experienced and don’t respect traffic laws.\n\nIf you want to reach Aden or Seiyun airport, the International Organization for Migration may be able to help by providing ground transportation through a local bus company. You may purchase tickets through their local offices.\n\nOnce you arrive at Aden or Seiyun airport, you will need to produce copies of airline tickets at checkpoints.\n\nContact information - International Organization for Migration in Yemen\n\nTaxis\n\nShared taxis are common in Yemen. Private taxis are also available in major cities and at airports.\n\nMotorcycles are often used as taxis. Drivers may often drive on the wrong side of the road and don’t follow traffic laws. Accidents are common.\n\nUse officially marked taxis only\n\nNegotiate fares in advance or insist that the driver use the meter\n\nAvoid taking shared taxis\n\nNever enter a cab if it already has one or more passengers\n\nAvoid using ridesharing apps\n\nFerries\n\nFerry services are connecting the various ports in the area, including to Djibouti. Vessels are frequently hijacked or attacked while crossing the Red sea, or in the coastal waters of the Gulf of Aden.\n\nAvoid using ferries.\n\nPiracy\n\nThere are pirate attacks and armed robberies against ships in coastal waters and, in some cases, farther out at sea. Mariners should take appropriate precautions.\n\nLive Piracy Report - International Maritime Bureau\n\nAir travel\n\nWe do not make assessments on the compliance of foreign domestic airlines with international safety standards.\n\nInformation about foreign domestic airlines\n\nHealth\n\nRelevant Travel Health Notices\n\nGlobal Measles Notice - 13 March, 2024\n\nPolio: Advice for travellers - 3 July, 2024\n\nCOVID-19 and International Travel - 13 March, 2024\n\nThis section contains information on possible health risks and restrictions regularly found or ongoing in the destination. Follow this advice to lower your risk of becoming ill while travelling. Not all risks are listed below.\n\nConsult a health care professional or visit a travel health clinic preferably 6 weeks before you travel to get personalized health advice and recommendations.\n\nRoutine vaccines\n\nBe sure that your routine vaccinations, as per your province or territory, are up-to-date before travelling, regardless of your destination.\n\nSome of these vaccinations include measles-mumps-rubella (MMR), diphtheria, tetanus, pertussis, polio, varicella (chickenpox), influenza and others.\n\nPre-travel vaccines and medications\n\nYou may be at risk for preventable diseases while travelling in this destination. Talk to a travel health professional about which medications or vaccines may be right for you, based on your destination and itinerary.\n\nYellow Fever - Country Entry Requirements\n\nYellow fever is a disease caused by a flavivirus from the bite of an infected mosquito.\n\nTravellers get vaccinated either because it is required to enter a country or because it is recommended for their protection.\n\nRisk\n\nThere is no risk of yellow fever in this country.\n\nCountry Entry Requirement*\n\nProof of vaccination is not required to enter this country.\n\nRecommendation\n\nVaccination is not recommended.\n\n* It is important to note that country entry requirements may not reflect your risk of yellow fever at your destination. It is recommended that you contact the nearest diplomatic or consular office of the destination(s) you will be visiting to verify any additional entry requirements.\n\nAbout Yellow Fever\n\nYellow Fever Vaccination Centres in Canada\n\nHepatitis A\n\nThere is a risk of hepatitis A in this destination. It is a disease of the liver. People can get hepatitis A if they ingest contaminated food or water, eat foods prepared by an infectious person, or if they have close physical contact (such as oral-anal sex) with an infectious person, although casual contact among people does not spread the virus.\n\nPractise safe food and water precautions and wash your hands often. Vaccination is recommended for all travellers to areas where hepatitis A is present.\n\nMeasles\n\nMeasles is a highly contagious viral disease. It can spread quickly from person to person by direct contact and through droplets in the air.\n\nAnyone who is not protected against measles is at risk of being infected with it when travelling internationally.\n\nRegardless of where you are going, talk to a health care professional before travelling to make sure you are fully protected against measles.\n\nHepatitis B\n\nHepatitis B is a risk in every destination. It is a viral liver disease that is easily transmitted from one person to another through exposure to blood and body fluids containing the hepatitis B virus. Travellers who may be exposed to blood or other bodily fluids (e.g., through sexual contact, medical treatment, sharing needles, tattooing, acupuncture or occupational exposure) are at higher risk of getting hepatitis B.\n\nHepatitis B vaccination is recommended for all travellers. Prevent hepatitis B infection by practicing safe sex, only using new and sterile drug equipment, and only getting tattoos and piercings in settings that follow public health regulations and standards.\n\nCOVID-19\n\nCoronavirus disease (COVID-19) is an infectious viral disease. It can spread from person to person by direct contact and through droplets in the air.\n\nIt is recommended that all eligible travellers complete a COVID-19 vaccine series along with any additional recommended doses in Canada before travelling. Evidence shows that vaccines are very effective at preventing severe illness, hospitalization and death from COVID-19. While vaccination provides better protection against serious illness, you may still be at risk of infection from the virus that causes COVID-19. Anyone who has not completed a vaccine series is at increased risk of being infected with the virus that causes COVID-19 and is at greater risk for severe disease when travelling internationally.\n\nBefore travelling, verify your destination’s COVID-19 vaccination entry/exit requirements. Regardless of where you are going, talk to a health care professional before travelling to make sure you are adequately protected against COVID-19.\n\nInfluenza\n\nThe best way to protect yourself from seasonal influenza (flu) is to get vaccinated every year. Get the flu shot at least 2 weeks before travelling.\n\nThe flu occurs worldwide.\n\nIn the Northern Hemisphere, the flu season usually runs from November to April.\n\nIn the Southern Hemisphere, the flu season usually runs between April and October.\n\nIn the tropics, there is flu activity year round.\n\nThe flu vaccine available in one hemisphere may only offer partial protection against the flu in the other hemisphere.\n\nThe flu virus spreads from person to person when they cough or sneeze or by touching objects and surfaces that have been contaminated with the virus. Clean your hands often and wear a mask if you have a fever or respiratory symptoms.\n\nMalaria\n\nMalaria is a serious and sometimes fatal disease that is caused by parasites spread through the bites of mosquitoes.\n\nThere is a risk of malaria in certain areas and/or during a certain time of year in this destination.\n\nAntimalarial medication may be recommended depending on your itinerary and the time of year you are travelling. Consult a health care professional or visit a travel health clinic before travelling to discuss your options. It is recommended to do this 6 weeks before travel, however, it is still a good idea any time before leaving.\n\nProtect yourself from mosquito bites at all times:\n\n• Cover your skin and use an approved insect repellent on uncovered skin.\n\n• Exclude mosquitoes from your living area with screening and/or closed, well-sealed doors and windows.\n\n• Use insecticide-treated bed nets if mosquitoes cannot be excluded from your living area.\n\n• Wear permethrin-treated clothing.\n\nIf you develop symptoms similar to malaria when you are travelling or up to a year after you return home, see a health care professional immediately. Tell them where you have been travelling or living.\n\nRabies\n\nIn this destination, rabies is commonly carried by dogs and some wildlife, including bats. Rabies is a deadly disease that spreads to humans primarily through bites or scratches from an infected animal. While travelling, take precautions, including keeping your distance from animals (including free-roaming dogs), and closely supervising children.\n\nIf you are bitten or scratched by a dog or other animal while travelling, immediately wash the wound with soap and clean water and see a health care professional. In this destination, rabies treatment may be limited or may not be available, therefore you may need to return to Canada for treatment.\n\nBefore travel, discuss rabies vaccination with a health care professional. It may be recommended for travellers who are at high risk of exposure (e.g., occupational risk such as veterinarians and wildlife workers, children, adventure travellers and spelunkers, and others in close contact with animals).\n\nPolio\n\nPolio (poliomyelitis) is an infectious disease that can be prevented by vaccination. It is caused by poliovirus type 1, 2 or 3. Circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus 2 (cVDPV2) is present in this country.\n\nPolio is spread from person to person and through contaminated food and water. Infection with the polio virus can cause paralysis and death in individuals of any age who are not immune.\n\nRecommendations:\n\nBe sure that your polio vaccinations are up to date before travelling. Polio is part of the routine vaccine schedule for children in Canada.\n\nOne booster dose of the polio vaccine is recommended as an adult.\n\nSafe food and water precautions\n\nMany illnesses can be caused by eating food or drinking beverages contaminated by bacteria, parasites, toxins, or viruses, or by swimming or bathing in contaminated water.\n\nLearn more about food and water precautions to take to avoid getting sick by visiting our eat and drink safely abroad page. Remember: Boil it, cook it, peel it, or leave it!\n\nAvoid getting water into your eyes, mouth or nose when swimming or participating in activities in freshwater (streams, canals, lakes), particularly after flooding or heavy rain. Water may look clean but could still be polluted or contaminated.\n\nAvoid inhaling or swallowing water while bathing, showering, or swimming in pools or hot tubs.\n\nTravellers' diarrhea\n\nTravellers' diarrhea is the most common illness affecting travellers.

Practise safe food and water precautions.\n\nThe most important treatment for travellers' diarrhea is rehydration (drinking lots of fluids). Carry oral rehydration salts when travelling.\n\nTyphoid\n\nTyphoid is a bacterial infection spread by contaminated food or water. Risk is higher among children, travellers going to rural areas, travellers visiting friends and relatives or those travelling for a long period of time.\n\nTravellers visiting regions with a risk of typhoid, especially those exposed to places with poor sanitation, should speak to a health care professional about vaccination.\n\nSchistosomiasis\n\nThere is a risk of schistosomiasis in this destination. Schistosomiasis is a parasitic disease caused by tiny worms (blood flukes) which can be found in freshwater (lakes, rivers, ponds, and wetlands). The worms can break the skin, and their eggs can cause stomach pain, diarrhea, flu-like symptoms, or urinary problems. Schistosomiasis mostly affects underdeveloped and rural communities, particularly agricultural and fishing communities.\n\nMost travellers are at low risk. Travellers should avoid contact with untreated freshwater such as lakes, rivers, and ponds (e.g., swimming, bathing, wading, ingesting). There is no vaccine or medication available to prevent infection.\n\nCholera\n\nRisk\n\nCholera is a risk in parts of this country. Most travellers are at very low risk.\n\nTo protect against cholera, all travellers should practise safe food and water precautions.\n\nTravellers at higher risk of getting cholera include those:\n\nvisiting, working or living in areas with limited access to safe food, water and proper sanitation\n\nvisiting areas where outbreaks are occurring\n\nVaccination may be recommended for high-risk travellers, and should be discussed with a health care professional.\n\nInsect bite prevention\n\nMany diseases are spread by the bites of infected insects such as mosquitoes, ticks, fleas or flies. When travelling to areas where infected insects may be present:\n\nUse insect repellent (bug spray) on exposed skin\n\nCover up with light-coloured, loose clothes made of tightly woven materials such as nylon or polyester\n\nMinimize exposure to insects\n\nUse mosquito netting when sleeping outdoors or in buildings that are not fully enclosed\n\nTo learn more about how you can reduce your risk of infection and disease caused by bites, both at home and abroad, visit our insect bite prevention page.\n\nFind out what types of insects are present where you’re travelling, when they’re most active, and the symptoms of the diseases they spread.\n\nChikungunya\n\nThere is a risk of chikungunya in this country. The level of risk may vary by:\n\nseason\n\nyear\n\nregion\n\nelevation\n\nThe virus that causes chikungunya is spread through the bite of an infected mosquito. It can cause fever and pain in the joints. In some cases, the joint pain can be severe and last for months or years.\n\nProtect yourself from mosquito bites at all times.\n\nLearn more:\n\nInsect bite and pest prevention\n\nChikungunya\n\nDengue\n\nIn this country,dengue is a risk to travellers. It is a viral disease spread to humans by mosquito bites.\n\nDengue can cause flu-like symptoms. In some cases, it can lead to severe dengue, which can be fatal.\n\nThe level of risk of dengue changes seasonally, and varies from year to year. The level of risk also varies between regions in a country and can depend on the elevation in the region.\n\nMosquitoes carrying dengue typically bite during the daytime, particularly around sunrise and sunset.\n\nProtect yourself from mosquito bites. There is no vaccine or medication that protects against dengue.\n\nRift Valley fever\n\nRift Valley fever is a viral disease that can cause severe flu-like symptoms. In some cases, it can be fatal. It is spread to humans through contact with infected animal blood or tissues, from the bite of an infected mosquito, or eating or drinking unpasteurized dairy. Risk is generally low for most travellers. Protect yourself from insect bites and avoid animals, particularly livestock, and unpasteurized dairy. There is no vaccine available for Rift Valley fever.\n\nAnimal precautions\n\nSome infections, such as rabies and influenza, can be shared between humans and animals. Certain types of activities may increase your chance of contact with animals, such as travelling in rural or forested areas, camping, hiking, and visiting wet markets (places where live animals are slaughtered and sold) or caves.\n\nTravellers are cautioned to avoid contact with animals, including dogs, livestock (pigs, cows), monkeys, snakes, rodents, birds, and bats, and to avoid eating undercooked wild game.\n\nClosely supervise children, as they are more likely to come in contact with animals.\n\nMiddle East respiratory syndrome (MERS)\n\nCases of Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) have been reported in this destination. The risk to travellers is low; MERS is primarily spread through contact with camels or camel-based products (raw milk, meat, urine). It can also spread through close contact, such as when caring for an infected person.\n\nAvoid contact with animals (especially camels), camel-based products, and wash your hands frequently.\n\nPrevention of Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS)\n\nMERS symptoms range from mild and flu-like to more severe pneumonia-like symptoms, and can result in death.\n\nThere is no vaccine or medication that protects against MERS.\n\nPerson-to-person infections\n\nStay home if you’re sick and practise proper cough and sneeze etiquette, which includes coughing or sneezing into a tissue or the bend of your arm, not your hand. Reduce your risk of colds, the flu and other illnesses by:\n\nwashing your hands often\n\navoiding or limiting the amount of time spent in closed spaces, crowded places, or at large-scale events (concerts, sporting events, rallies)\n\navoiding close physical contact with people who may be showing symptoms of illness\n\nSexually transmitted infections (STIs), HIV, and mpox are spread through blood and bodily fluids; use condoms, practise safe sex, and limit your number of sexual partners. Check with your local public health authority pre-travel to determine your eligibility for mpox vaccine.\n\nMedication\n\nThere is a significant shortage of prescription medication.\n\nIf you take prescription medication, you’re responsible for determining their legality in Yemen.\n\nBring sufficient quantities of your medication with you\n\nAlways keep your medication in the original container\n\nPack them in your carry-on luggage\n\nCarry a copy of your prescriptions\n\nMedical services and facilities\n\nHealth care is inadequate throughout the country. Medical facilities and hospitals are very limited, even in major cities. They lack of medical staff and supplies. You will likely need medical evacuation if you are seriously ill or injured.\n\nThere are no adequate emergency ambulance services. Cash payment in advance is often required.\n\nMake sure you get travel insurance that includes coverage for medical evacuation and hospital stays.\n\nHealth and safety outside Canada\n\nKeep in Mind...\n\nThe decision to travel is the sole responsibility of the traveller. The traveller is also responsible for his or her own personal safety.\n\nBe prepared. Do not expect medical services to be the same as in Canada. Pack a travel health kit, especially if you will be travelling away from major city centres.\n\nLaws and culture\n\nYou must abide by local laws.\n\nLearn about what you should do and how we can help if you are arrested or detained abroad.\n\nDrugs\n\nPenalties for possession, use or trafficking of illegal drugs are severe. Convicted offenders can expect heavy fines and lengthy jail sentences.\n\nAlcohol\n\nThe consumption of alcohol in public is illegal. Public intoxication is also a criminal offence, no matter where the alcohol was consumed.\n\nAvoid drinking alcohol outside licensed premises.\n\nDrugs, alcohol and travel\n\n2SLGBTQI+ persons\n\nYemeni law criminalizes sexual acts and relationships between persons of the same sex.\n\n2SLGBTQI+ persons could also be discriminated against or detained based on their sexual orientation, gender identity, gender expression, or sex characteristics.\n\nIf you are convicted, you could face corporal punishment, imprisonment or the death penalty.\n\n2SLGBTQI+ persons should carefully consider the risks of travelling to Yemen.\n\nTravel and your sexual orientation, gender identity, gender expression and sex characteristics\n\nDress and behaviour\n\nYemeni customs, laws and regulations adhere closely to traditional and Islamic practices and beliefs.

Men and women are not permitted to share a home unless they are legally married or are related to one another.\n\nSexual relations outside of marriage are a criminal offence and may be subject to severe punishment, including the death penalty.\n\nMarriage outside Canada\n\nFamily law\n\nYemen family law is different from Canadian family law. Yemen isn't a signatory to The Hague Convention. Decisions are based on Islamic law. It's extremely difficult for woman, even if she is a Muslim, to obtain custody of her children through Yemeni courts. Canadian custody orders may not be recognized in Yemen.\n\nLocal authorities may prevent Canadian children or spouse from leaving the country without prior authorization of the Yemeni father, husband or male relative.\n\nTo avoid any difficulties in Yemen, consult a Canadian and a Yemeni lawyer before travelling. If you're involved in legal proceedings such as divorce or custody dispute in Yemen, consult a Yemeni lawyer for advice and assistance regarding your own specific situation.\n\nInternational Child Abduction\n\nThe Hague Convention on the Civil Aspects of International Child Abduction is an international treaty.
