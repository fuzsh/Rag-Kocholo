        "text": "Recounting his brief sojourn in Aden during the 1920s, the Syrian American writer Ameen Rihani soliloquized on the sights he witnessed at its harbour. Despite the grimness of the port’s spectral and desolate backdrop, Rihani marvelled at the thousands of tons of coal stacked by the foreshore (‘black piles rising in squares and pyramids near the water and adding a touch of realism to the inferno of Steamer Point’), forming, together with the imposing lighthouse and evocative telegraph station, Aden’s ‘trinity of materialism’.Footnote 1 As astute an observer as he was eloquent a writer, Rihani was keenly aware that the scale and scope of global capital and information flows was predicated on a chain of offshore stations like Aden, where steamships could replenish their coal supplies while shorefront godowns and telegraph stations gathered commodities and information to be received, processed, and relayed.Footnote 2 Having been seized by the Indian Navy in 1839 as the first territorial acquisition of the Red Sea steam navigation route, Aden formed the crux of a modular and rapidly expanding British transoceanic transportation and communication network.Footnote 3 The opening of the Suez Canal in 1869 had elevated the import of the station from an imperial to a truly global scale,Footnote 4 as by the mid-twentieth century over 5,000 vessels called on the harbour annually, making Aden the second busiest port in the world after New York.Footnote 5 ‘The whole world is interested’, reflected Rihani, ‘where, in one form or another, the whole world passes’.Footnote 6\n\nYet, none of this was inevitable. Throughout the first decades of its colonial existence, there was very little to suggest of Aden’s future prominence. The severe challenges posed by the abrasive heat and resource scarcity of the desert outpost were compounded by transformations unfolding beyond its shores: the ideological salience of laissez faire undergirded a commitment on Bombay’s part to cutting all public expenditure, and within eighteen months of the port’s seizure, both Governor James Rivett-Carnac in Bombay and Governor-General Lord Ellenborough in Calcutta questioned the expediency of keeping Aden, the former writing tersely: ‘[the seizure of Aden] was a bad move, and will be a constant source of expense and trouble to us’.Footnote 7 With the fledgling outpost increasingly looking like a liability rather than an asset, Bombay made it clear that funds for Aden will be kept to a bare minimum until ‘something like a return is obtained from that place’.Footnote 8 Across the empire, the exigencies of laissez faire capitalism dictated that the infrastructural overhaul of the age of steam was largely outsourced to private enterprise, but the absence of agricultural or industrial potential in a desolate, unproductive outpost like Aden rendered it unappealing to metropolitan capital, ironically precluding investment in the very site which facilitated and made possible imperial connectivity and circulation.Footnote 9\n\nHow then do we account for the making of an infrastructural space like Aden outside the remit of metropolitan capital?Footnote 10 Historians have long established that the form and extent of imperialism was determined as much by non-European collaboration and resistance as it was by European activity and Europe’s political economy.Footnote 11 British entrenchment in India was contingent upon access to indigenous credit and remittance networks,Footnote 12 while beyond the subcontinent, in the concrete geographies of empire as well as the abstract world of the Indian Ocean bazaar, European expansion likewise depended on local actors, institutions, and processes.Footnote 13 Imperial dependence was not limited to realms of finance and administration, however: across the reaches of the Indian Ocean, the investment, speculation, and attendant risks borne by non-Western capitalists were fundamental building blocks of imperial statecraft, from harbour construction schemes and steam navigation ventures to the establishment of transoceanic shipping, remittance, labour brokerage, and other maritime related services.Footnote 14 Indeed, where Western capital failed or refused to assume the mantle, non-Western capital stepped in in its stead. Of these transregional merchant communities, none were more consequential for the consolidation of European capital in Asia than Parsis, who bankrolled and supplied the Canton opium trade that ‘laid the economic foundations of the imperial economy’.Footnote 15\n\nPerennial strangers-in-a-foreign-land, the capacity to accommodate and modify itself is inscribed in the very genesis of the Parsi community.Footnote 16 Parsi fluidity and adaptability, as well as an intimate familiarity with Islam, aided their rapid integration into the Portuguese and then British imperial fold.Footnote 17 As On Barak has argued, overseas Parsis served as a colonial vanguard whose technological innovativeness and legalistic propensities provided a foil to hostile climates and to the sanitation and security concerns of the age of steam, namely the ‘twin infections’ of cholera and Islamic radicalism.Footnote 18 Indeed, Parsi capitalists have been described as ‘partners in empire’;Footnote 19 but while Parsi ledgers and British gunboats jointly reshaped the political economy of the Indian Ocean, it was also the latter’s singular ability to effect coercive measures which capped the scope of Parsi success and ultimately led to its decline, as Company monopolies and racially-inflected glass ceilings in India and China forced Parsi merchants to subordinate their capital in its service.Footnote 20 In the 1840s, Parsis gradually withdrew from the opium trade.Footnote 21 The decline of their fortunes in China marks a pivot in Parsi historiography, with historians focusing on a transition from merchant capitalism to swadeshi industrialisation, yet the endeavours of Parsi capitalists west of Bombay, all but absent from the literature, represent continuation rather than rupture.Footnote 22\n\nLike their fellow Zoroastrian merchants in other reaches of the Indian Ocean, the Parsis of Aden forged a distinctive identity of conscientious industriousness.Footnote 23 Parsi firms supplied both shore and shipping requirements for ships calling on Aden, providing brokerage and agency, or dubash services, literally meaning ‘two languages’, or ‘translator’ in the vernacular. Indeed, much in the way that contemporary logistical rationalities are premised on a drive to render space equivalent, exchangeable, and interchangeable, so were Parsis integral in rendering foreign spaces commensurable and thus legible to Western modalities. More than a particularly successful comprador community, however, Aden Parsis developed an elaborate transoceanic trade predicated on self-financed, capital-intensive infrastructure projects. Imperial political economy may have dictated that even the most successful Parsi merchants had to attach themselves to British trading houses in India and China, but British firms were not attracted to invest in a far-flung enclave with scant potential for profits such as Aden, leaving Parsi capital free to assume its own position of power and influence. As will presently be shown, Parsis had the run of the market in Aden, driving and ultimately coming to dominate the commanding heights of the port’s economy.\n\nWhat follows then is an exploration of how Parsi capital shaped the development of Aden as a site of imperial infrastructure. I start by following the agents and brokers who served as key mediators of international shipping’s interface with Aden, provisioning ships, brokering sales and purchases, and providing facilities through the finance and execution of for-profit logistics infrastructure projects. The second section traces how Parsi entrepreneurs exploited Aden’s free port status by repurposing and repackaging wasted sea frontage as valuable real-estate where globally assembled, discounted consumer goods were vended, establishing in the process one of the world’s first dedicated duty-free retail hubs. The third and final section examines the consolidation of their position in Aden by recounting the lobbying efforts of Parsi shipping interests urging for the harbour to be dredged, a seemingly straightforward venture which nevertheless led to an impasse that would take over a quarter of a century to resolve, culminating in the formation of an institutional body affording Aden’s private firms, with Parsis at the helm, the statutory power to streamline the exigencies of their interests."
