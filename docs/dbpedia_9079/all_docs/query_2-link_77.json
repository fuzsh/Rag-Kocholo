        "text": "Updated at 5:23 p.m. ET\n\nA large explosion rocked the airport in Aden, Yemen, on Wednesday shortly after a jet landed carrying officials of the country's Saudi-backed government. Dozens of casualties were reported. Video from the scene shows hundreds of people were gathered on the tarmac when the blast struck.\n\nPeople were still disembarking from the plane carrying members of Yemen's new government when the explosion hit, causing the crowd to scatter as they rushed for cover. At least 22 people were dead, The Associated Press reported.\n\nNews crews were filming the politicians' long-anticipated arrival — heralded as an important step in bringing stability to Yemen, where Saudi Arabia and Iran are locked in a proxy war. Aden has been adopted as Yemen's temporary capital because Iranian-backed Houthi rebels control the capital city, Sanaa.\n\nThere has been no claim of responsibility for the blast.\n\nPrime Minister Maeen Abdulmalik Saeed — a holdover from a recent Cabinet shake-up — condemned what he called a cowardly terrorist act, saying that he and other members of the government remain in Aden and are unscathed. But local news outlet Aden al-Ghad later reported that at least one junior official was killed and several officials were wounded.\n\nHussam Radman, a journalist and researcher at the Sana'a Center for Strategic Studies think tank, narrowly escaped with his life, having been just 70 to 100 feet away from the initial large explosion – which set him running. Other explosions followed, he said, leaving dozens of people wounded or dead.\n\n\"Of course, when we heard the first explosion, we tried to understand what was happening, we were confused about whether it was an explosive or a drone or a rocket,\" Radman told NPR. He added that he believes it was a missile attack – an idea that echoes several local media reports.\n\n\"Most of us were terrified and confused because we didn't know what was happening or where the threat was coming from. So people were running and attempting to escape the danger,\" Radman said. \"We tried to go to an area without any asphalt because areas with asphalt always have lots of shrapnel.\"\n\nThe survivors waited for some time, he said, before returning to the area and \"communicating with colleagues about who was alive, dead, who was well and who was wounded, the size of the damage and the victims.\"\n\nThree Red Cross staff members were among the dead.\n\n\"The International Committee of the Red Cross is profoundly saddened that three of our colleagues were among those killed in Aden's airport explosion earlier today,\" the agency said in a statement.\n\nThe Red Cross workers were moving through the airport when the explosion hit, the aid agency said. Three of them were injured, including one person with serious wounds.\n\nDoctors Without Borders said its hospital in Aden has received 17 people who were wounded in the attack, adding that another local hospital referred the cases.\n\nIt was meant to be a day to mark the success of more than a year of negotiations to end a power struggle between two groups ostensibly on the same side in Yemen's war.\n\n\"There was an environment of optimism and cheer around the arrival of this government,\" Radman said, noting the lengthy negotiations between rivals. The first explosion, he said, struck the reception area where the politicians were to be received. The blast hit just minutes before the officials stepped off the plane, he added.\n\nSaudi Arabia leads an alliance of countries and local factions against Yemen's Houthi rebels. But fractures in that alliance have resulted in fighting between supporters of Yemen's exiled president and the separatist Southern Transitional Council, which seeks to restore independence to the former South Yemen. The ministers landing at Aden's airport from Saudi Arabia are part of a Cabinet meant to represent both these groups.\n\nPresident Abed Rabbo Mansour Hadi, who did not travel with the Cabinet, has directed the military to mount a special investigation into the attack, which he said targeted the arrivals terminal of Aden International Airport. Hadi said he spoke to the government entourage to make sure they were safe.\n\nIn response to the blast, Martin Griffiths, U.N. special envoy for Yemen, said, \"I strongly condemn the attack at Aden airport upon the Cabinet's arrival and the killing and injury of many innocent civilians. My sincere condolences and solidarity to all who lost loved ones.\""
