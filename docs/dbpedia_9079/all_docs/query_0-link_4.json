At the time of writing, Aden was the internationally recognized capital of Yemen and recent developments regarding efforts to separate Aden as an independent city in Yemen have not been incorporated in the analysis. This proﬁle describes and analyses the situation in the city of Aden across a variety of sectors. It addresses key themes and ﬁndings made prominent by the impact of the ongoing conflict, its toll on the city’s population, and ability of institutions to provide basic services.\n\nEach thematic section study the prevailing situation and needs through triangulation of data, including: secondary data analysis which draws on available publications and media reports; remote sensing; and structured interviews with community focal points (CFP) and sector experts (see section 2: Methodology). The aim of the proﬁle is to provide humanitarian partners with a granular understanding of multi-sector needs in Aden, assisting them in their operational programming and strategic policy development."
