        "text": "Transcript\n\nIn the southwest of the Arabian Peninsula lies the most primordial and enigmatic country in the Middle East: Yemen. Its unique and incomparable landscapes give this country an almost mystical aura. At one time it was the kingdom of the Queen of Sheba, who is supposed to have set out from here to visit King Solomon in Jerusalem a thousand years before Christ was born. Today, most Yemenites lead traditional and reserved lives in very modest conditions. About two-thirds of all Yemenites still live from subsistence farming. It often takes more than two hours to reach larger cities by car. The path there is a bit of an adventure.\n\nA catchment area for large numbers of people, Yemen's capital, Sanaa. Sanaa is renowned the world over for its historic center and unique culture. The old town consists of 6,000 multi-storey buildings, in the typical, and traditional architectural style. The most peculiar thing about them: they are made of clay and are centuries old. They have been UNESCO World Heritage Sites since 1988. Today, about two million people live in this city, which is more than just the cultural and political epicenter of the country. Sanaa has always been and continues to be a center of trade and craftsmanship. The famous curved daggers are made here. They hang from nearly every man's belt and are considered both as jewelry and status symbol.\n\nVisitors who take a closer look will discover many a curious relic of times gone by, like a camel mill. Mustard seeds are ground here.\n\nWest of Sanaa, in the port city of Hodeidah, most people earn their living with fish. The coast is full of sea creatures, especially sardines, tuna and sharks. The latter is by far the most requested at the fish markets. Though many species of shark are protected by laws, it doesn't seem to bother anyone here. For many Asians shark fins are a delicacy and high prices are paid for a set of shark teeth.\n\nWhether on the coast or farther inland, Yemen is a country in which traditions are still playing a major role."
