It became an important transit hub for Muslim pilgrims traveling to Mecca. By the 12th century, under the rule of the Sulayhid dynasty, Aden had transformed into a thriving city-state, its wealth burgeoned by its strategic position on the spice trade routes between India, Arabia, and East Africa. This era also saw the construction of several key fortifications, including the famous cisterns of Tawila, crucial for collecting and storing rainwater.\n\nColonial Era: 19th to Mid-20th Century\n\nThe modern history of Aden took a pivotal turn in 1839 when the British East India Company captured the city, recognizing its importance as a station on the route to India. Aden officially became part of the British Empire, serving as a coaling station and later as the capital of the British Crown Colony of Aden. During this time, Aden’s port was considerably expanded and became one of the busiest shipping hubs in the world. Furthermore, the establishment of the oil refining industry in the mid-20th century added another layer to its economic fabric.\n\nRecent History: Late 20th Century to Present\n\nAfter gaining independence from British rule in 1967, Aden became the capital of the People’s Democratic Republic of Yemen.
