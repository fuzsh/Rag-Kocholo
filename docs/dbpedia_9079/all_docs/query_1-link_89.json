        "text": "At the southern tip of the Arabian Peninsula, Yemen shares a border with Oman to the east and Saudi Arabia to the north. The Gulf of Aden and the Arabian Sea form Yemen's southern coastline, and the country is bounded on the west by the Red Sea. The strategic strait of Bab al-Mandab on the Red Sea is all that separates Yemen from Djibouti and Eritrea on Africa's eastern shore.\n\nModernization of the country has been slow. Mounting economic woes and the government's struggle to maintain control of the country from the Shi'a Al-Houthis and other armed groups, including Al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula (AQAP), remain central challenges in Yemen.\n\nYemen presents serious security challenges. There is limited government control nationwide, with Al-Houthi-controlled territory in northern and central areas. The government also lacks authority in Yemen's southern governorates, with ongoing tensions with pro-southern secessionists. The current conflict has endured since 2015, resulting in significant military and civilian fatalities and deepening territorial, political, tribal, and ideological divides. While periodic attempts to impose a ceasefire or political resolution to the conflict occur, armed clashes continue. The Al-Houthis responded to the Saudi-led coalition involvement by launching dozens of weaponized drone and missile attacks against Saudi Arabia and, occasionally, the UAE. The Al-Houthis have also regularly launched water-borne improvised explosive devices (WBIEDs) against vessels traversing the Red Sea as a result of the Yemeni conflict.\n\nWhile a ceasefire, signed in April 2022, has largely held, reports of clashes along front lines continue, further threatening civilian populations. Even in the southern and eastern governorates outside of the main conflict, the multitude of internal and external actors has complicated the local security environment. Clashes continue to break out between Yemeni government forces and pro-southern forces linked to the Southern Transitional Council (STC) in Aden, Abyan, Lahj, and Shabwah governorates, undermining the peace process and threatening a sub-conflict in the south. The Saudi-led Riyadh Agreement and its implementation will dictate the security environment in Aden and the south in the short term.\n\nYemen faces a significant threat from terrorism. Al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula (AQAP) and Islamic State in Yemen (IS-Y) have a presence in southern and central areas of the country. Despite diminishing capabilities due to extensive counterterrorist operations since 2016, there is a concern their influence could return amid the prolonged conflict and southern instability. Security forces, government officials, military installations, and places of worship are often targeted. Attacks are more frequent in areas where militants have a strong presence and capability. Political and economic issues continue to spur civil unrest. Demonstrations can turn violent, with protesters attacking police and blocking roads with burning tires and rocks. The crime threat, including armed robbery and carjacking, is a serious concern. Weapons are readily available, which reflects a weaponized culture amongst young male Yemenis. There is a significant threat of kidnapping from terrorist groups, local militia, armed tribesmen, and criminal groups. Protests often occur over localized, national, or socio-economic grievances. Carjacking and banditry pose threats to overland travel, particularly at night. Foreigners have previously been targeted. Hospitals and emergency medical services do not meet Western standards, and access to facilities is limited. There is a critical shortage of fuel, food, water, and medical supplies due to the ongoing conflict.\n\nAs a result of the Israel-Hamas conflict, Yemen's Al-Houthis have launched multiple projectiles against the southern Israeli city of Eilat and targeted dozens of vessels traversing the Bab al-Mandab as well as the Gulf of Aden.\n\nThe conflict in the country has been ongoing since 2015 between the Al-Houthis and the internationally recognized government, supported by Saudi-led coalition forces. Al-Houthi territory has been reduced since being pushed out of the south, including Aden, but the group retains control of significant territory. The Al-Houthi withdrawal from these areas has led to the creation of new front lines such as Ibb, Ad-Dali', and Ta'iiz, which has contributed toward a worsening humanitarian situation. The Al-Houthis have taken part in peace talks but have reneged on many agreements between the rival parties, indicating a refusal to make concessions or cease hostilities. The ongoing conflict has exacerbated the humanitarian crisis in the country. The Al-Houthis have responded to the Saudi-led coalition intervention by launching missile and weaponized drone attacks into Saudi Arabia and occasionally attacking coalition-flagged vessels in the Red Sea. Increasing drone and missile capabilities have increased the risk of targeted attacks within Yemen.\n\nTerrorism is also a prevalent threat; AQAP formerly held large areas of territory and conducted high-level attacks in the country, and although the group's capability is diminished, it maintains a presence in central and southern areas. Islamic State in Yemen (IS-Y) also has a foothold in some southern areas, although its footprint is significantly less.\n\nClashes between pro-southern loyalists and government forces in Aden, Abyan, Lahij, and Shabwah often threaten to ignite a conflict within a conflict. The issue of southern secession has been put on hold as part of the Saudi-led Riyadh Agreement to ease these tensions but has the capacity to affect the security environment in certain areas severely. Overall security in southern and southeastern governorates has improved as Saudi and UAE-trained local forces have been mobilized to combat the threat of the Al-Houthis and militant groups.\n\nTravelers not employing the highest levels of personal security protection face a serious risk from criminal activity, including carjacking, kidnapping, and robbery. Most business travelers use close security protection.\n\nPolitical rallies and violent demonstrations take place at short notice in Sana'a, Aden, and provincial towns and cities. Protests can escalate rapidly over local discontent, a lack of public services, and socio-economic grievances. Clashes and security crackdowns have resulted in fatalities. Tribal protests in Al-Houthi-controlled areas are frequently resolved by violence. The culture of firearms adds to the security threat. Targeted kidnapping and assassinations are also a concern."
