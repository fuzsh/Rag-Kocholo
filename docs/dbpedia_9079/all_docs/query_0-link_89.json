        "text": "Government authorities in Aden, southern Yemen, announced the initiation of trial operations for the country’s first solar power generation station on Monday. Supported by the UAE, this initiative addresses persistent power shortages in the city.\n\nThe trial involves generating approximately 20 to 30 per cent of the station’s 120-megawatt capacity, with full-scale operations expected within the next three months. This groundbreaking project represents Yemen’s foremost strategic effort to utilize clean and renewable energy sources for electricity.\n\nAden, serving as Yemen’s temporary capital, has faced challenges in public services, particularly electricity provision, since its liberation from Houthi forces in April 2015.\n\nAn official from the Aden Electricity Corporation informed Reuters on Monday that the initial phase of the project carries an estimated cost of around USD 100 million, generously supported by the UAE.\n\nThe current capacity of the station is 120 megawatts, with plans for expansion to 600 megawatts in the second phase over the coming years. This ambitious undertaking aims not only to address immediate power challenges in the city but also signifies a significant stride toward sustainable energy solutions in Yemen."
