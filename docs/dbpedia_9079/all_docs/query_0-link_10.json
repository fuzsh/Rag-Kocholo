        "text": "Overview\n\nThe Aden region encompasses the southern city of Aden, the wider Aden governorate, and the surrounding districts that fall under the administrative bounds of Lahij governorate, which serve as the key access points to the port town. Both Aden and its environs in Lahij, including Tur al-Baha, Tuban, al-Milah, and Radfan districts were caught up in the Houthi’’s advance south in 2015, but quickly retaken in a United Arab Emirates-backed operation a few months later and since remained under the control of the Internationally Recognized Government (IRG).\n\nAden city has been the de facto capital of the IRG since the start of hostilities in early 2015 when then-President Abdrabbuh Mansur Hadi fled to the southwestern port city from Sanaa following its fall to the Houthis. The city lies to the south of Sanaa and is home to the largest harbor in Yemen, which overlooks the Gulf of Aden. With its connections to the Arabian and Red Seas, the harbor and its associated port constitute a major transit area for international shipping.\n\nThe region is currently under the administration of figures affiliated with the Southern Transitional Council (STC), which assumed control of Aden in early 2018. Aden city has since experienced several bouts of intensive infighting between the Saudi-backed IRG and UAE-supported STC forces. This fighting usually ended with the intervention of their respective Gulf backers in the Saudi-led Coalition, which has largely resulted in the STC retaining control over most of the main political and military structures. However, since the Saudi-enforced 2022 presidential transition of power from Hadi to the Presidential Leadership Council (PLC), Riyadh has been steadily trying to take back control over military forces in the IRG’s capital by replacing STC-aligned brigades with its Nation Shield Forces (NSF).\n\nConflict background\n\nThe conflict quickly reached Aden in March 2015 when the Houthis, together with forces loyal to the late President Ali Abdullah Saleh, pushed south in pursuit of then-President Hadi, sweeping across Taizz and Lahij, reaching the city on 25 March. Instrumental to the Houthi advance into Aden was the breakdown of military and security structures, especially after President Hadi fled the city for Riyadh, leaving its defense to a patchwork of local resistance groups.\n\nFierce fighting continued in the city throughout May and June, with Houthi forces taking control of key infrastructure, including the airport, the oil refinery in al-Burayqa, and the Presidential Palace. Although they captured much of the city, the Houthis were unable to gain a decisive advantage as they fought street-to-street with the Southern Resistance groups and carried out heavy shelling in some of the worst fighting in the entire war.\n\nThe local resistance relied on Coalition bombing and limited weapons supplies arriving by sea to hold onto parts of the city. The situation, however, changed in mid-July with the launch of UAE-led Operation Golden Arrow, a major counter-offensive to retake Aden that managed to push the Houthis forces out of the city. The operation progressed all the way into northern Lahij by early August, where the current frontlines in al-Qabbayta district are still situated.\n\nWith the retreat of the Houthis, an uneasy peace held in Aden, although the city still experienced widespread insecurity driven by the myriad militias and military units that controlled its districts, as well as the active local al-Qaeda franchise, resulting in frequent assassinations, bombings, and armed clashes. As the institutions of the city were rebuilt with UAE support, members of the secessionist Southern Movement began to dominate the newly established security structures, later known as the Security Belt Forces, in parallel to units loyal to President Hadi.\n\nThe simmering tensions briefly erupted in January 2018 as fighting broke out between the STC-affiliated forces and Presidential Protection Forces as the pro-STC forces seized government positions, but Saudi mediation ended the several days of clashes before they reached the symbolic Presidential Palace. However, the underlying issues remained, reaching a boiling point in August 2019 as the STC and IRG returned to open conflict following the death of popular Security Belt Force commander Abu al-Yamama in a Houthi missile attack and an alleged Islamic State suicide attack on a police station that brought STC supporters to the streets to demand action.\n\nIn less than 48 hours, STC forces took over the city, securing government buildings, ministries, and military camps. The take-over was confirmed when UAE airstrikes hit IRG forces outside the city to halt their attempt to return to Aden, eventually being formalized with the signing of the Riyadh Agreement in November that officially ended the fighting between the sides in Aden. However, insecurity has remained, including targeted attacks on political and security figures, most notably Houthi missile strikes on Aden airport moments after the arrival of the newly formed power-sharing cabinet in December 2020.\n\nThe STC has continued to consolidate its authority within the city and surrounding districts in Lahij – which, unlike Aden governorate, were not as affected by the infighting between the IRG and STC – and largely remained under the remit of STC-affiliated forces. However, the Riyadh Agreement was never fully implemented and the underlying divisions continued to erupt into internecine clashes in other southern governorates. Although Aden was spared the fighting, members of the government avoided the interim capital due to internal tensions. Even after Saudi Arabia intervened once again to resolve the differences between the parties replacing Hadi with the power-sharing PLC, the changes did not result in any meaningful unity or reforms to reverse the economic decline.\n\nAssassination attempts, clashes between armed groups, kidnappings, and bombings are still reported on an intermittent basis in Aden city and its environs. Protests and civil unrest have also been a common occurrence in the southern city since it has become the seat of power for the IRG. Outside of the politically organized demonstrations arranged by the rival parties in the city, economic issues have been the primary cause of unrest in Aden. The failure of basic services, in particular, has been one of the main sources of frustration for residents. Electricity blackouts have routinely reached more than 12 hours per day, especially in the summer months when there is a surge in demand to cope with the sweltering seasonal temperatures. The authorities have been increasingly unable to address the issue as a shortfall in revenues has left them short of funds to pay for fuel for power stations and fund the repairs and maintenance to maintain production on the Adeni grid. For the most part, these protests have been peaceful, but the greater the anger and disruption caused, the harsher the response from the security forces."
