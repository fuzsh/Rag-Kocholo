        "text": "Introduction\n\nYemen is the worst humanitarian crisis of our generation. Moving into its eighth year of persistent conflict, famine and economic struggle, there are now 12.4 million children in need of urgent assistance and protection, with over 2 million of them internally displaced.\n\nThe ongoing conflict between the North and South regions of Yemen have meant that millions of Yemeni’s now lack access to basic healthcare, sanitation and clean water. Poor infrastructure, disease and starvation have torn apart the lives of families and their children. Many have been forced to flee their homes and live in makeshift shelters, leaving their belongings behind without basic means to survive, like food or water. These dire circumstances pose serious risks for children – without access to safe spaces like schools and shelters, they become increasingly susceptible to child labour, exploitation, life-threatening sickness and malnutrition.\n\nWhat is the population in Yemen?\n\n31 million\n\nWhat is the national language of Yemen?\n\nArabic\n\nWhat is the capital city of Yemen?\n\nSana'a\n\n*Red pins show areas where we work.\n\nYemen Today\n\nThe UN and other members of the international community have condemned the atrocities committed in Yemen. They are in the process of establishing peace efforts by imposing a two-month truce and possible six-month extension to provide respite from fighting; this would mark the longest conflict-free period Yemen has witnessed in over 7 years. Despite these efforts, roads continue to be blocked by armed groups, preventing essential aid deliveries and assistance to vulnerable families and children. With access to healthcare and education is still severely hindered, and rates of malnutrition increasingly high, the people of Yemen are still facing some of their toughest days yet.\n\nKeep in touch\n\nWe'd love to keep in touch about our work and how you can continue to make a difference to children's lives, by sending you updates we think you'll be interested in, including fundraising, merchandise, cultural events and activities.\n\nEmail opt-in\n\nSMS opt-in\n\nWe may also contact you by post or phone about fundraising appeals and events.
