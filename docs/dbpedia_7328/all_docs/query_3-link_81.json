        "text": "HDMI is a digital signal format, developed primarily as a platform for the implementation of HDCP (High Definition Content Protection) to prevent consumers from having complete access to the contents of high-definition digital recordings. As one might expect from a standard that was developed to serve the content provider industries, rather than the best interests of the consumer, HDMI is something of a mess. The signal is not robust over distance because it was designed to run balanced when it should have been run unbalanced (SDI, the commercial digital video standard, can be run hundreds of feet over a single coax without any performance issues); the HDMI cable is an unnecessarily-complicated rat's-nest arrangement involving nineteen conductors; switches, repeaters and distribution amplifiers, by virtue of this complicated scheme, are made unnecessarily expensive; and the HDMI plug is prone to falling out of the jack with little more than a light tug. As more and more manufacturers move to implement HDMI on more home theater devices, however, it falls to the consumer to try to make the best of this dubious and poorly-thought-out standard.\n\nhttp://www.bluejeanscable.com/store/dvi/index.htm\n\nIn theory, both can perform equally. Cheaper consumer equipment may have lower performance D/A, A/D components that might tip the balance to HDMI. Try both and see which looks better to you. The signal coming to your house probably passed through several D/A A/D conversions on it's way. The playback VCR's at the networks all play back 1440x1080i or 1280x720p (ABC, ESPN and FOX).\n\nIf and when all the copy protection schemes get implemented, the user is forced into an encrypted HDMI + HDCP connection to get 720p or 1080i. Analog and non-authenticated DVI/HDMI connections will be forced to drop resolution below 960x540 (quarter resolution).\n\nTrue HD sources like BD/HD DVD eventually require HDMI. Current BD, HD discs have the encryption requirement turned off.\n\nThe 1080i signal is from a comcast cable box, or my sony upconverting dvd player. My DLP has 2 hdmi inputs, but one is really for a pc hook-up(only has birhgtness, contrast tint for the settings, where as HDMI1 has settings to change individual colors, and other specs.) What I found out was that all 3 of my component can receive 1080i and have all the settings that the HDMI1 has. So that is the reasoning for this thread. Currently I am running the Comcast cable box on HDMI1, and the Sony on HDMI2. I think the picture looks fine on the sony in HDMI2, but was curious if changing it to Component and playing with the settings maybe the video would look even better after running a AVIA dvd.\n\nI already own the HDMI cables as well as the component cables.\n\nOn my 42\" flat-panel TV, the difference was nothing short of dramatic. Nothing at all like digital to analog comparison on a PC monitor.\n\nOutstanding improvement in quality. Almost like comparing an SD channel to an HD channel, for some of the poorer conversions using HDMI over component is a bigger improvement.\n\nEven casually interested observers noticed an obvious improvement, everyone I know who did not have an HDMI cable yet and was wondering this same question immediately went out to get one. 3 or 4 people so far.\n\nWal-mart, the poor person's Wonderland, had a decent cable far cheaper than any other store.\n\nYou definitely want to keep that Sony up-converting DVD player hooked up to one of those HDMI inputs, otherwise you will not be able to benefit from the up-conversion feature (since it only works through the HDMI output). The DVD player likely has several picture adjustments built into it you could use for AVIA tweaking, so that second HDMI input on your DLP should be fine to use for the Sony. Still, I think I would run the player into the first HDMI input, the cable box into the second one. Every cable channel and individual programs vary quite a bit from each other, so you can go nuts trying to \"dial in\" the cable box picture.\n\nAs far as your cable box goes, try it both ways (HDMI and component video) to see if there are any differences you can detect. The HDMI connection may have a bit sharper picture, but it depends alot on the cable box itself and the quality of your cable signals (as well as your TV's handling of those signals).\n\nDon't get suckered into buying expensive HDMI cables. It's a digital connection so fancy \"upscale\" cables make absolutley no difference at all. The basic HDMI cables from MonoPrice.com are excellent and cost less than $10.\n\nIn my opinion connection over hdmi is much better if the source signal is from hddvd or blueray in 1080p standard. But is source is from HDTV satellite broadcast much better result will be using component.\n\nIt is because the quality of sat signal is different on each provider and channel. The component connection lets use digital processing in your tv and this way video result should be better if you compare it with hdmi connection where no digital processing is using for enhance the video result.\n\nfor what it is worth . . .\n\nI'm a recent convert to high definition TV - running a 46\" Sharp 1080P LCD. My cable source is a Scientific Atlanta 8300HD DVR - and also have a Sony upconverting dvd player. This TV has 2 hdmi ports - both apparently with equal capabilities - the dvd player plugged into 1 - and the dvr plugged into the other. I keep the TV set for \"dot by dot\" display when viewing anything coming over the hdmi cables.\n\nI played around with and experimented with component connections before settling on the hdmi connections. I am convinced that for me - the hdmi connections are the best choice because it seems to result in the best viewing experience as it seems to maintain the aspect ratio exactly of the originating signal/program while taking full advantage of the 1080 size of my tv screen. If I ever add a DVD recorder, it will be an upconverting model, and I plan to find a way to use a switch to also connect that to the tv via hdmi.\n\nI am not using expensive cables. I picked up cables locally when on sale for a very reasonable cost (under $10 each) and they work just fine. One of the cables was supplied by my cable company when I switched to high def."
