        "text": "IMPORTANT: This article applies only to specific products and/or operating systems. Check Applicable Products and Categories for details.\n\nThis issue can occur when your set-top box (cable box, satellite box, etc.) is set for an HDMIÂ® output of 720p. The 720p output signal can cause the channel logo to flicker after a TV channel has been playing for several minutes and then changed to a different channel. This will cause the previous channel logo to remain displayed.\n\nTo avoid this issue, change the output signal setting of the set-top box to 1080i. The issue will not occur with the 1080i set as the output. For assistance with how to change the output signal on your set-top box, refer to the manual supplied with that device."
