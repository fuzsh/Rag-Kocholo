Nonauh Muss ,\n\nTerrible app, good shows\n\nEdit: I am struggling with the app even more than before. This is a terrible app and needs to be fixed. It is constantly buffering, wonât let me watch a full show without me having to reboot everything (app, phone, Chromecast, internet...) just to watch an entire show from start to finish. I took a star away because of the constant frustration that just keeps getting worse. Donât download unless you enjoy being frustrated.\n\nThis is not a good app. It freezes regularly in the middle of a show and I have to stop casting and then recast it and find my place in the episode of the show Iâm watching. In order to get back to where I was, I have to sit through more commercials. I have to restart the app often and Iâve had to reboot my phone a few times just to make it work. There is no other connectivity issue with any other apps and devices I use when USA is acting up. I have found that the NBC apps are all pretty much the same way. Theyâre pretty terrible, although so far, USA doesnât seem to be as bad as the NBC app. So yeah, unless you are really into a show on USA (like me) then itâs not really worth it.\n\nL0streaper ,\n\nNBC Universal lies to customers!!!\n\nSo wasnât able to be home to watch a show I like to watch that is on same time every week without fail but downloaded this stupid USA Network app to watch and the live stream isnât live at all not one but the show I wanted to watch started at 6pm and is 3 hours long and then went to watch on the app and the show was going live on my cable box ( had my fiancÃ© look to see if it was on live on the cable box and it was ) but the USA Network app said it didnât start till the show ends on cableâ¦.. how is that live tv!?!?!? Itâs not one bit so I will be contacting the company of the show I watch to let them know why I wonât be watching one of their shows anymore because I donât want anything to do with NBC Universal at all. Thankfully Fox network has another night that I will now watch instead of both. And it may seem a little weird that I say I will let the company know Iâm one that is on a council for the product which I have ways to contact so hopefully NBC Universal looses the contract and the go to a much more reliable source than NBC UNIVERSAL"
