        "text": "There are a few possible reasons.\n\nYour T3•R is not connected properly\n\nEnsure your aerial is connected to your T3•R and an HDMI cable is connected from your T3•R to your TV.\n\nWhen your T3•R is turned on, the LED on the front is blue.\n\nThe correct input on your TV is not selected\n\nWith your T3•R turned on and connected to your TV by HDMI, press the GUIDE button on your T3•R's remote control. This displays the TV Guide, making it easy to tell when you find the right input.\n\nTo change inputs, most TV remotes use a button labelled ‘AV’, ‘SOURCE’, ‘INPUT’, or with a TV icon and arrow. Each press should cycle through your inputs. Check your TV's manual if necessary.\n\nOnce you find the input displaying the T3•R's TV Guide, press EXIT on your T3•R's remote and check if live TV is working. Try changing to BBC One by pressing '1' on the remote control. If the T3•R says there is No Signal, you may have a problem with your aerial. To retune, press HOME and go to: Settings > Channels > Retune.\n\nAn incompatible HDMI resolution has been selected\n\nIf you are using HDMI, the T3•R may be set to an HDMI resolution that your TV does not support:\n\nNormally the T3•R is set to auto detect the HDMI resolution but this can fail with some TVs.\n\nThe T3•R can also be manually set to a resolution in the Picture & Sound section of the Settings menu. This could cause an issue if you set a resolution (e.g. 2160p), then move the T3•R to another TV that doesn't support that resolution.\n\nThe T3•R can automatically cycle through common resolutions until you find one that works:\n\nTurn the T3•R on and wait 30 seconds.\n\nPress HOME.\n\nPress & Hold ‘0’ for 5 seconds.\n\nThe T3•R will try each of the 3 HD resolutions for 15 seconds in this order: 1080p, 1080i and 720p. Select ‘Confirm’ when you can see the picture.\n\nApps require a minimum broadband speed of 3Mbps to stream video reliably. Even if you have a faster connection, e.g. 16Mbps, other devices may be using it at the same time and reducing the speed available to the T3•R.\n\nIf you are using Wi-Fi, you can check your Wi-Fi signal by pressing HOME and selecting: Settings > Internet\n\nEven if the signal is good, it is still dependent on your broadband speed being fast enough. Also, too many other devices may be using your Wi-Fi at the same time and/or large downloads may be taking place, for example if your computer is performing a software update.\n\nIf your Wi-Fi signal is poor, try adjusting the location of your Wi-Fi router and/or its antenna(s). You can also try moving the T3•R itself. Alternatively, instead of using Wi-Fi, connect your T3•R to your internet router with an Ethernet cable.\n\nThe T3-R normally starts and stops recording when the broadcaster signals that the programme starts and ends. This is because programmes almost never start or end at the exact scheduled time – they're usually a minute or two early or late, and sometimes even more. This broadcaster signalling is normally very accurate and means recordings start and stop exactly when they should. However, sometimes broadcasters get it wrong, particularly on the more niche channels.\n\nIf you’re finding that some of your recordings are starting late or finishing early, we’ve added the option to change from this automatic behaviour and instead add a customisable amount of padding to the start and end of all recordings. Go to: Settings > Recording & Playback > Padding Options > Padding Type > Manual. In our testing we’ve found that 5 minutes of padding is plenty so have set this as the default to be added to the start and end, however you can change this to any amount from 2 to 10 minutes.\n\nIt’s important to note that if you have two consecutive recordings on the same channel then the padding between them will be ignored – the first recording will end at the scheduled time and the next recording will start at the scheduled time. The same applies if you have two consecutive recordings on different channels and a recording on another channel that overlaps both of these recordings.\n\nAs broadcasters usually signal the start and end of recordings correctly, it gets really annoying having to fast forward through the padding to the actual start of the recording. So, to avoid this, by default when you start playing a recording it will start from the signalled start rather than the recorded start. If for some reason the broadcaster signalled the start late, you can simply rewind back to catch the beginning . You can change this behaviour so that recordings always start from the recorded start by going to: Settings > Recording & Playback > Padding Options > Playback Start.\n\nWe’ve also added markers to the playback bar for where the broadcaster signalled the start and end of the recording:\n\nIn this screenshot Star Trek has been recorded on Horror with 5 minutes of start and end padding. The white markers on the playback bar indicate when Horror signalled the start and end of the programme and in this case they signalled the end just over a minute early. If this had been recorded without any padding then the last minute would have been missed! But, because of the new padding feature the whole episode was caught, meaning you never miss a second of your favourite show.\n\nPlease note that broadcasters usually signal the start of programmes when they actually start but the end of programmes after the ad break that follows the end. So even if you don’t see the marker for the end of the programme, it doesn’t necessarily mean that the end of the programme was missed.\n\nTo make turning your TV on and off as easy as possible, when you turn on your T3-R it can turn on your TV and change it to the right input. Your T3-R will also go to standby when you put your TV in standby. This all works with AVRs and soundbars too.\n\nPlease note that some older devices may not support HDMI Control, and the feature needs to be enabled on your TV, AVR or soundbar to work. HDMI-CEC is the generic name but manufacturers all call it something different: Anynet+ (Samsung), Viera Link (Panasonic), LG (Simplink), BRAVIA Link and BRAVIA Sync (Sony), Aquos Link (Sharp). We just call it HDMI Control!\n\nTo enable this feature on your T3-R, go to: Settings > System > HDMI Options > HDMI Control.\n\nWhen HDMI Control is enabled, the T3-R also has a setting to ‘Turn Off Devices’. Turn this on and when you press the standby button on your T3-R remote it will also put your TV and any other connected and compatible devices in standby too!"
