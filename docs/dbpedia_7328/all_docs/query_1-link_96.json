        "text": "Not only do the statistics matter, but Instagram post sizes also count. It is a must to know the exact measurements of photos, videos, stories, reels, etc.\n\nExamine the content you wish to upload and establish which areas of the image or video you‚Äôd like to highlight and keep in frame. You can then use a photo or video editing app to crop and resize your photos, before bringing them straight to your Instagram profile after these tweaks. Read below to find the perfect Instagram post sizes for all of your content!\n\nInstagram post sizes\n\nInstagram profile photo size\n\nYour profile picture is your trademark and that image will make you recognizable amongst your followers.\n\nWhen it comes to your personal profile, it is also important to use that same photo with the rest of your social networks so you can be easily remembered and recognized.\n\n‚úÖ Optimum size : 110px x 110px, recommended 320 x 320.\n\n‚úÖ Maximum resolution: 180px x 180px.\n\nInstagram image size\n\nSince 2015, you can upload both horizontal and vertical photos to Instagram, something that has made it much easier for us to add the photo we want.\n\nSquare photos:\n\nAlthough Instagram added horizontal and vertical photos, the square images are still a success and a symbol of Instagram.\n\n‚úÖ 1:1 ratio aspect\n\n‚úÖ 1080px by 1080px, but Instagram will compress the file and display close to 600px by 600px.\n\nHorizontal photos: landscape\n\n‚úÖ Instagram recommends an aspect ratio of 1.91:1 however, you can go up to 16:9.\n\n‚úÖ 1080px by 566px but it is also possible to use a smaller size such as 600px by 400px.\n\nInstagram vertical photos: portrait\n\n‚úÖ Aspect ratio of 4:5\n\n‚úÖ 1080px by 1350px, however, Instagram will show it as a 480px x 600px image.\n\nInstagram video post sizes\n\nOn Instagram, you can upload a video to your feed or share it on Instagram stories. The correct size to use will be determined by where you post it:\n\nSquare videos\n\n‚úÖ Aspect ratio of 1:1\n\n‚úÖ 600 x 600.\n\n‚úÖ Duration between 2 and 60 seconds\n\nHorizontal videos: Landscape\n\n‚úÖ Aspect ratio between 1.91:1 and 16:9\n\n‚úÖ 600 x 315 px.\n\nVertical videos\n\n‚úÖ Size of vertical videos: 600 x 750 pixels\n\nInstagram stories and reel dimensions\n\nStories\n\n‚úÖ Aspect ratio of 9:16\n\n‚úÖ 750px x 1334px\n\nVideo stories\n\n‚úÖ 750px x 1334px\n\nInstagram Reels\n\n‚úÖ Reels size: 1080 x 1920 px.\n\nInstagram Ads Sizes\n\nWhen it comes to creating your ads on Instagram you must consider the size of your posts and different formats and be sure you stick to them!\n\n‚úÖ Square ad: [1:1 aspect ratio] 1080px x 1080px. Although it will appear as 640px x 640px.\n\n‚úÖ Landscape format: [1.91:1 aspect ratio] 1080px x 566px. It will display as 640px x400px.\n\n‚úÖ Vertical: [4:5 aspect ratio] 1080px x 1080px. It will display as 600px x 750px.\n\n‚û°Ô∏è Pay special attention to the text you use on your ads. Instagram only allows\n\nyou to include text no greater than 20% of the image size ‚¨ÖÔ∏è\n\n‚úÖ Photos work better than videos. Despite the brand‚Äôs growing trend of sharing videos, the stats speak for themselves.\n\nSize on Instagram Matters\n\nYes, photo size matters on Instagram or any other social network.
