        "text": "On most social media platforms, posts with visuals perform better. That’s why 66% of businesses use images and videos as part of their marketing strategy.\n\nBut it is not enough to add just any image or video.\n\nTo be effective, your social media visuals need to be high-quality and sized correctly. It can be tricky to get the sizing right, though, because recommended social media image sizes seem to change all the time, and it’s hard to find official specs for each social network.\n\nThat’s why we compiled all the latest social media image sizes in one guide. We’ll list the recommended sizes for social networks like Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, Pinterest, LinkedIn, Snapchat, and TikTok. Hang tight!\n\nQuick social media image sizes\n\nBefore we go into more detail for each of the major social networks below, here’s an infographic of the most important social media image sizes you need to know.\n\nFacebook image sizes\n\nWith nearly 3 billion monthly active users, Facebook is a goldmine for brands looking to build a following and get customers.\n\nA great way to get the attention of Facebook users is to upload high-quality images.

Even though Instagram Stories and Reels are blowing up right now, you can still catch your audience’s attention with static images.\n\nInstagram supports three image orientations — static, portrait, and landscape. So you have many formats to choose from, but these formats can make it hard to get the right dimensions.\n\nHere’s some guidelines to follow to make sure your images look great.\n\nInstagram profile picture size: 320 x 320 pixels\n\nInstagram displays profile images at 110 x 100 pixels, but stores them at 320 x 320 pixels, so you should upload an image that’s at least 320 x 320 pixels.\n\nNote: The profile image dimensions are in a square format, but Instagram displays them as a circle. Make sure to center any elements you want to focus on in the image so they don’t get cropped out.\n\nInstagram image sizes for feed posts\n\nSquare: 1080 x 1080 pixels\n\nPortrait: 1080 x 1350 pixels\n\nLandscape: 1080 x 566 pixels\n\nRecommended image size: The width should be 1080 pixels, and the height should be between 566 and 1350 pixels (depending on if the image is portrait or landscape)\n\nSupported aspect ratios: Anywhere from 1.91:1 and 4:5\n\nImage tips\n\nIf you want your Instagram images to be sharp and clear, upload them at a width of 1080 pixels.\n\nWhen you upload an image that’s bigger than 1080 pixels, Instagram will resize it to 1080 pixels.\n\nInstagram will leave your image at its original resolution if it’s between 320 and 1080 pixels wide, as long as the image’s aspect ratio is between 1.91:1 and 4:5 (a height between 566 and 1350 pixels and a width of 1080 pixels).\n\nIf your image’s resolution is lower than 320 pixels, Instagram will increase the sizel to 320 pixels.\n\nIf you uploaded an image that’s a different ratio, Instagram will automatically resize your photo to fit a ratio it supports.\n\nTo learn more about producing stunning Instagram images, check out this Hootsuite post on editing Instagram photos like a pro.\n\nInstagram photo thumbnail sizes\n\nDisplay size: 161 x 161 pixels\n\nRecommended upload size: 1080 pixels wide\n\nImage tips\n\nInstagram stores photo thumbnails that are as large as 1080 x 1080 pixels.\n\nTo avoid pixelation, upload images that are very large.\n\nInstagram Stories image size: 1080 x 1920 pixels\n\nImage tips\n\nImages for IG Stories should have an aspect ratio of 9:16.\n\nIf your image does not have this ratio, the Story might be cropped or zoomed weirdly.\n\nIf you upload an image with a smaller pixel size but the same aspect ratio, the Story will buffer quickly.\n\nInstagram Reels uses the same sizing as Stories.\n\nIf you want to up your Instagram Stories game, here are some free Instagram Story templates that the team at Hootsuite created.\n\nInstagram carousel image sizes\n\nSquare: 1080 x 1080 pixels\n\nPortrait: 1080 x 1530 pixels\n\nLandscape: 1080 x 566 pixels\n\nRecommended image size: A width of 1080 pixels and a height between 566 x 1350 pixels (depending on if the image is portrait or landscape)\n\nSupported aspect ratios: Square (1:1), portrait (4:5), landscape (1.91:1)\n\nInstagram Reels sizes\n\nCover photo: 1080 x 1920 pixels\n\nInstagram Reels have an aspect ratio of 9:16.\n\nInstagram crops Reels to a 1:1 image in your profile feed and a 4:5 image in your home feed.\n\nInstagram ads images sizes\n\nSquare: 1080 x 1080 pixels\n\nLandscape: 1080 x 566 pixels\n\nMinimum width: 320 pixels\n\nMaximum width: 1080 pixels\n\nSupported aspect ratios: Anywhere between 1.91:1 and 4:5\n\nImage tips\n\nInstagram has recommendations for the number of characters you can include in an ad’s headline and primary text.\n\nInstagram ads that appear in users’ feeds can’t have more than 30 hashtags.\n\nImage sizes for Instagram Stories ads: 1080 x 1920 pixels\n\nImage tips\n\nTo prevent Instagram Stories ads from being covered, Instagram recommends that you leave “14% (250 pixels) of the top and bottom of the image free from text and logos”.\n\nAs of September 2020, Instagram doesn’t penalize ads that have text on over 20% of ad space.\n\nTwitter image sizes\n\nGone are the days when all you needed to do to amass a huge following on Twitter was post controversial hot takes. Now, you need eye-catching images to make your content stand out in the fast-paced Twitterverse.\n\nTweets that have images are three times more likely to get click-throughs, likes, and retweets than tweets that have no images.
