        "text": "I have just got myself a Toshiba HDMI DVD player that upscales to 720p and 1080i\n\nI have to say that the quality is excellent but looks exactly the same on 720p or 1080i... why is this?\n\nI understand that 1080i is 2 lots of 540 lines interlaced so in theory its displaying 541 lines compared to 720p 720 lines so I would have thought 720 progressive would be the better quality...\n\nIm still unclear on how Interlacing works...\n\nI dont think my TV is downscaling it to 720p cos the built in scaler in the TV isnt very good and I reckon it would be a poorer image than the 720p feed if it DID downscale 1080i to 720p\n\ncan anyone clarify which is best format to watch and why?\n\nif my TV is 1366 x 768 resolution how does it display 1080x1920i ?\n\nso my TV doesnt display incoming feeds on the HDMI connectiopn at the resolution its supposed to?\n\nif i feed 1080i my TV displays 1920x1080i (on screen info)\n\nif i feed 720p my TV displays 1280x720p (onscreen info)\n\nif i feed 576p my TV displays 576p (onscreen info)\n\nIve heard this before about TVs rescaling 1080i to 720p but i dunno cos if thats the case why say the TV displays at 1080i (which is 540p) if its just gunna scale it to 720 (which isnt 540p or 1080i)\n\n1080i is supposed to display 540 progressive lines...now my TV supports 1080i as does the DVD player so if im on that resolution i should be getting a display of 540 lines... BUT i have to say it doesnt look like it does - the pic quality is same as 720p - AND if 1080i(540p) is upscaled to 720p the quality would probably be less...??\n\nIm totally confused\n\nThere's no simple answer as to which is better.\n\nAny decent HDTV will inverse telecine any 1080i film source back to 1920x1080 progressive frames, then display it at the TV's native resolution. A good 1080i film source will look sharper on a 1080p HDTV than on a 720p HDTV (assuming you are sitting close enough to the TV to see the difference).\n\nFully interlaced 1080i (live video sources like sports and the news) have to be deinterlaced in some fashion. Smart deinterlacers will maintain the full resolution in non-moving areas but will fall back to half (vertically) resolution in moving areas. This is one reason why much sports (ESPN for example) is broadcast at 720p.\n\nAll the processing going on makes it impossible to predict what will look better on an HDTV. You have to try both options with different sources and you have to know what defects to look for.\n\nOh, and upscaling standard definition DVD doesn't make it high definition. About the best you can hope for is for it not to introduce too many scaling artifacts. (There are \"super resolution\" scaling techniques but I don't think any upscaling DVD player does this.)\n\nI'm a n00b at this HDTV business having finally bit the bullet in an effort to make my system compatible with my AppleTV. I bought a relatively inexpensive 32\" that is 1366x768 \"native\". I get my TV signal over a roof-top antenna and am quite pleased with the results. Frankly I can see the zits under the actresses' makeup so any higher resolution would be a waste of $$. Of course, none of the stations in my area is b'casting higher than 720p so there's another reason. Additionally, the AppleTV's 720p movies are exquisite. Finally, anything I have (or get) that's less than 720p looks pretty good on the TV.\n\nBased upon all the discussions, however, it seems I must check out an upconverting DVD player as most owners do sing their praises.\n\nBy the way: BluRay? Nahhh; they may have won the battle but they will lose the war against digital downloads.\n\nCheck out this overview on interlace. It might be a helpfull introduction.\n\nhttps://forum.videohelp.com/topic346546.html\n\nThe fellow on YouTube ignors the processing that goes on in a progressive plasma/LCD-TV and is totally wrong about his 540p arguement even for CRT and RPTV sets. I suggest he looks up \"Kell factor\" to understand the perceived vertical resolution of an interlace CRT which is ~0.7 x 1080 lines or around 760 assuming the CRT dot pitch resolves that fine.\n\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kell_factor\n\nA progressive television has a \"native resolution\" defined by the fixed horizontal and vertical pixels on the display. Today, plasmas are most often 1024x768 or 1366x768 with some expensive models at 1920x1080. LCD displays are usually 1366x768 or 1920x1080. Everything coming into a plasma or LCD-TV is converted to native resolution by the TV's processing engine. Possible inputs to a progressive HDTV include\n\n1. Analog NTSC or PAL\n\nFields get decoded to YPbPr components, then are digitized and deinterlaced to 480p or 576p, then are scaled to native resolution for display.\n\n2a. SD 480i/576i YPbPr\n\nThese fields get digitized and deinterlaced to 480p or 576p, then are scaled to native resolution for display.\n\n2b. SD 480i/576i DVI/HDMI\n\nAlready digital, these fields get deinterlaced to 480p or 576p, then are scaled to native resolution for display.\n\n3a. HD 1080i YPbPr\n\nThese fields get digitized and deinterlaced to 1080p, then are scaled to native resolution for display. Upscaling is even done for native 1080p HDTV sets due to \"overscan\" issues.\n\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overscan\n\n3b. HD 1080i DVI/HDMI\n\nAlready digital, these fields get deinterlaced to 1080p and then are scaled to native resolution for display (see overscan).\n\nNote: All of the above inputs are interlace (either 50 or 60 fields per second) so must be deinterlaced to 50 or 60 frames per second for progressive display. The quality of the deinterlacer is what separates low end from high end processing engines. Without going into the details of deinterlace, a genenral rule is processor quality will be better for newer and higher end progressive HDTV sets (e.g. the Sony XBR engine is better than the Bravia engine which will be better than the more generic Olevia).\n\n4a. 480p/576p/720p/1080p over VGA or YPbPr\n\nThese analog progressive formats are usually input at 50 or 60 frames per second. They are digitized and then scaled to native resolution.\n\n4b. 480p/576p/720p/1080p over DVI or HDMI\n\nThese inputs are already digital, so get scaled to native resolution.\n\nSo, the main jobs for the processing engine are deinterlace and scaling. Newer sets add a third feature which is frame rate upconversion to 100Hz or 120Hz to improve motion smoothness and reduce flicker.\n\nA good processing engine will eliminate most differences between 1080i and 1080p. For film source (e.g. TV series and DVD movies) 1080p can be extracted from 1080i with no loss. For sports action, 720p gives sharper action clarity over 1080i but a good processor will extract reasonably good progressive frames from 1080i fields.\n\nDid this help?"
