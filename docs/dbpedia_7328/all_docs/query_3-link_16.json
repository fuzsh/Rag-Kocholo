        "text": "576p vs. 1080i is not as \"black and white\" as many people seem to think.\n\nThis topic really interests me as there is a lot of misinformation floating around about the 576p format, and just what exactly it does offer (if anything according to some of you!). I took the time to write down my thoughts on this issue, based on a large amount of experience, research, and of course discussion surrounding progressive and interlaced scan formats in the home theatre industry. I hope it’s of interest to readers of this thread. I certainly welcome any debate surrounding the points that I raise below.\n\n576p is the same RESOLUTION as 576i just with less flicker.\n\nHi Owen. I'm afraid this simply isn’t true for a number of important reasons.\n\n1. The 720x576/50i format (PAL) actually only contains 288 lines of resolution “per motion update” (288 lines per 50th of a second). The difference being that the first 288 lines in field one are the even lines, and the second lot of 288 lines in field two are the odd lines (but its important to note that with native 50i both are from different moments in time so don’t entirely line up). The idea is our brain tends to combine these fields to a degree, creating the illusion of them being more detail than there actually is (hence it earns the 576i title rather than 288i).\n\n720x576/50p (progressive PAL or Enhanced Definition) on the other hand is the full 576 lines of resolution per motion update (576 lines per 50th of a second). There is no interlacing and all lines are presented in the one frame, or one motion update, so you're getting twice as much vertical detail in the same amount of time.\n\nAnother way to look at it is raw pixel count. With 576i you're getting 207,360 pixels (720x288) per 50th of a second. With 576p you're getting 414,720 (720x576) in the same amount of time! That's twice as many pixels!\n\nThe question is does this translate into twice as much detail at all times? In most cases, no. The reason being the motion updates at 50 a second are very quick, and with interlaced scan you're brain is actually interleaving those 288 lines fields together to often get close to the perception of 576 lines being present at one time (particularly when there is little motion). However you do certainly notice more resolution with true progressive video vs interlaced due to the simple fact that there is twice as much detail being presented in the same amount of time.\n\n2. Whenever there is any motion whatsoever, the 576 perceived line of resolution with the native 576i format disappear in a major way. Why? Because the fields are from different moments in time, whenever there is any motion, field two is simply in a different spot to field one, so the lines of resolution don’t line up onscreen. That’s why if you put your nose up to an interlaced monitor screen while watching 576i, you’ll see “feathering” or “combing” of the edges of all objects as the camera moves (particularly noticeable during straight camera panning). What this means is that with interlaced scan during motion, you’re only seeing somewhere between 288 and 576 lines of resolution at any given time. Where there is even relatively rapid motion you’re always seeing much less than 576 lines.\n\nDue to the nature of interlaced scan , motion also causes severe blurring (known as inter-field blur) which also destroys clarity, so interlaced scan is described as having a form of low temporal resolution (or in some ways more accurately described as “bad spatial resolution during movement”).\n\nThe “interlaced factor” also destroys detail (and causes a distracting associated interline flicker artefact) during any vertical movement, as detail literally flashes on and off as it falls over the even/odd line succession from field to field. You’ll clearly see a form of this during the scrolling vertical credits at the end of any film.\n\nProgressive on the other hand is able to maintain full detail during movement as you’re seeing the full 576 vertical lines per motion update. Hence you don’t get smearing of detail, and sharpness and clarity is greatly enhanced over interlaced during any movement (particularly when material is shot in a native 50p format).\n\n3. Interlaced artefacts. These are arguably the worst and most noticeable problems associated with interlaced scanning. Relating to the motion issues described above, there are other inherent problems with motion when you are dealing with a format that displays even and odd liens from different moments in time. Namely this causes a “stepping effect” of edges, commonly referred to as aliasing. This is particularly noticeable during any diagonal movement and even more noticeable across thin tightly spaced horizontal objects such as car grills and venetian blinds. In these cases the suspension of disbelief is all but destroyed, as your eye quickly detects the unnatural effect that aliasing causes onscreen. You’ll also often get the “moire effect” (swirling concentric circles) accompanying aliasing with interlaced scan, particularly over grid patterns such as that found on a chequered shirt pattern.\n\nRelating to the above artefact is interline flicker. This one occurs extremely frequently with any interlaced scan material (regardless of the spatial resolution of the interlaced format) and as is caused simply by fine detail flicking “on and off” as the even and odd lines flick up and down. For example you might have a thin horizontal border that takes up exactly one line of resolution. This line will therefore be drawn in field one, but as field two is in a different place (as its drawing the surrounding odd lines) the line is not drawn at all in field two, but then reappears in field one. The result is obviously a flickering on and off effect that is highly noticeable around items such text and any other fine horizontal detail.\n\nProgressive scan eliminates these artefacts, as all the lines are drawn at the one time, and line up perfectly with each other as they come from the same moment in time. The result is aliasing is non existent, there is no interline flicker whatsoever, and edges of objects have much greater definition and solidarity. This is particularly noticeable during any diagonal movement where progressive scan looks far more natural and uniform.\n\n4. The final point worth bringing up is the overall solidity and natural quality of progressive scan. Often described as “film like”, progressive scan simply has a more natural appealing solidity and uniformity to the picture that is hard to actually define. Due largely to the fact that with interlaced scan, even though our brain does a good job of helping the perception of a creating a single image, it still detects that the picture is split into two even and odd line sections (even if it only does so subconsciously). With progressive scan however, you’re seeing the entire frame at once with no flickering up and down which obviously translates into a more natural “real” quality to our brain that interlaced scan. The result is a more immersive picture that is certainly more enjoyable to watch over long periods of time.\n\nThe bottom line is that you can’t simply say “1080i is better than 576p” or that “progressive is just the same as interlaced without the flicker”. All else being equal (even though it rarely is) progressive scan is vastly superior in quality over the same interlaced standard of the same resolution. Just looking at a basic progressive computer monitor displaying fine text will quickly illustrate that.\n\nHowever things get tricky when you’re talking about a “low spatial resolution progressive format” vs a “high spatial resolution interlace format” (I.e. 576p vs 1080i). In these cases there is no correct answer, as to which one is technically better, as both have their own set of pros and cons, and are therefore better suited to different type of source footage and events.\n\nObviously from a simple “spatial resolution only stand point” the 1920x1080i format is superior to 576p, in that is has a lot more available pixels, and hence can produce a picture with far more detail. In reality though, 1920x1080i is actually only 1920x540 pixels per 50th of a second, and caries with it all the same interlaced problems as 576i. However 1920x 540 still equals 1,036,800 pixels per 50th of a second which is more than enough to produce superb picture quality with the right source material, and is more than twice as many pixels per motion update than true 576/50p. And of course your brain does perceive more than 540 lines at any given time due to the nature of even/off interlaced scan line succession (just like 576i, you’re perceiving something between 540 and 1080 vertical lines depending on how much motion is taking place at any given time.\n\nAs has often been discussed 1080i is considered by many to be the best suited format for material that originally comes from low frame rate progressive sources such as 24p or 25p film (or material shot in the 1080i segmented frame format). In these cases the interlaced field are from the same moment in time (both successive fields taken from the same original frame) and you therefore perceive a lot more spatial detail, as well as incorporating the awesome benefit that 1080i from film based sources can be easily de-interfaced by weaving the fields back together, to achieve a true 1920x1080p format with full 1080 lines of detail present per motion update (when such displays become available to de-interlace and fully resolve 1080p anyway).\n\nHowever for material that is shot at a faster motion rate (material that is now commonly shot in the 50i or 60i SD formats) or particularly for sport, high frame progressive scan formats do certainly have a major advantage. That being their ability to preserve far more detail and clarity during motion. If in the future Seven do actually have the ability to shoot in a true 576/50p format (50 unique progressive frames a second) then I imagine many of you will be very surprised at just how amazing 50p can look during anything with fast motion. I have had the pleasure of experiencing the clarity of true 60p sports in the USA (admittedly this was the 1280x720p format so this also had great spatial resolution!) and the clarity and detail maintained during movement was utterly insane. Hard to put into words how good it really is.\n\nFor now though, Seven are simply up-converting most content from 576/25p or down-converting from 1080isf sources, so with a lot of their material you’re only getting 25 unique motion updates a second, with each frame doubled to achieve 50p (as opposed to the 50 motion updates you are used to seeing even with 576/50i sources). The result is the horrible “film like judder” that is present on shows like Home and Away and The Great Outdoors. In these cases the only real benefit of 576p you’re getting is the lack of interlaced artefacts, the great solidarity to the picture, and the large level of detail constantly present due to there always being 576 unique lines of detail present. It won’t be until they move to high frame rate shooting at native 576/50p that the true benefits of this format could be realised (and this may simply never happen in Seven’s case).\n\nI just wish like many others they would adopt the 1280x720p format instead, meaning fantastic progressive image quality, combined with superb spatial and temporal resolution. The great thing about 720p is that it’s easily the “best overall HD format” given that it’s well suited to any HD source, be it low frame rate film, or high frame rate native progressive video. The reason being it has great spatial resolution, accompanied with the benefits of progressive scan, and the ability for great temporal resolution with fast motion content such as sport. It also takes up less bandwidth than 1080i, meaning a higher bit-rate can be used (translating into no visible compression artefacts). I’d say it’s well and truly too late for the 720p format to emerge as an Australian standard now though.\n\nSorry for the very long winded post, but I constantly see people writing off 576p altogether, as though it is a useless standard, and offers nothing over 576i. The reality is it does have its benefits like any progressive format, many of which are simply not yet illustrated by Seven due to the sources for 576p being very limited at this stage.\n\nDon’t get me wrong either, I love 1080i, and for most material I think it does look better overall than 576p due simply to the much greater spatial resolution. I just also happen to hate interlaced scanning in general, and with fixed panel progressive displays becoming the future display type of choice, the world is moving towards progressive scan as being the format of choice, and hence native progressive formats of any resolution are an excellent thing! The sooner we do away with interlaced scanning, and move towards high frame rate/high resolution progressive sources and standards; the better off the world will be"
