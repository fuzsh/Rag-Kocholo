        "text": "I have a 60\" rear projection LCD from Panasonic that was purchased in the US and supports HD 1080i with HDMI and composite inputs. I currently use a SCART to VGA converter with Sky+ but have now upgraded to Sky HD to take advantage of the HDMI connector on the back of the TV (or so I thought..!)\n\nHowever, after installation it would appear that there must be some differences between UK and USA HDMI or composite inputs (I assumed that PAL/NTSC issues were removed from HD and HDMI?) as I can't get any output from either HDMI or composite on the TV.\n\nThe SCART to VGA still works OK but can only get 1024x768 on VGA and the picture while OK is not perfect (as expected).\n\nSo, does anyone know the issues surrounding UK v USA HD or is there a UK to USA HDMI adaptor or converter (or any other way of getting SkyHD om my US HDTV)???\n\nAny help would be appreciated!!!!\n\n0"
