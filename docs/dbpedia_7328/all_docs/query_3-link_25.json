        "text": "How to get a full screen on the TV by adjusting Screen Settings.\n\nTelevisions have to handle a variety of inputs and types of signals. Depending on the type of signal being received, the TV needs to process this signal and determine how to display it on the screen.\n\nThere are settings in the television that can be used to select the way the signal is processed and displayed on the screen.\n\nIf there are lines on the screen, the screen is blurred, has double images, is too bright or dark, or has odd colors, refer to How to troubleshoot TV picture and screen issues\n\nIMPORTANT: In this topic, TV settings to display the appropriate size of image on the TV and its effects are introduced. However, depending on the target image, note that it may not be solved by TV settings. Check the following items in advance.\n\nItems to check before changing settings:\n\nCheck the TV menu - If the menu is also stretched or distorted, the TV may require service.\n\nChange to a different input source - Check Cable, DVD, Blu-ray, etc. If only one device has an issue, check the settings on that device rather than the TV.\n\nCheck the content - The program, movie, or content you are watching may be broadcast or recorded in an aspect ratio that will not fully fill your screen or may be displayed as stretched or distorted. For example, some movie content is recorded in a 21:9 Cinema format that will display with black bars above and below the picture when viewed on a widescreen (16:9) TV.\n\nCheck Closed Caption (CC) and Extended Data Services (XDS) - If these features on the TV are turned on, this may cause the picture to be stretched, distorted, or cut off. Try turning off Closed Caption or Extended Data Services to see if the issue is resolved.\n\nThe issue may be with the program - The top or bottom of the screen may be covered by banners or tickers when watching some news or sports programs. These are part of the broadcast signal and cannot be changed or removed.\n\nSome options may not be able to be changed - Some devices and TVs do not have the capability to change the aspect ratio of the picture when a 720p or 1080i signal is being output or received.\n\nSettings Sections:\n\nSetting the device connected to the TV\n\nSetting the TV - Automatic Modes\n\nSetting the TV - Manual Modes\n\nSetting the TV when connecting a PC\n\nSetting the device connected to the TV (back to top)\n\nThe first step in determining how to set the television is to check the signal coming into the TV to make sure it is set properly. The device that is connected to your TV may have settings that affect the way the signal is output to your television. These devices may include:\n\nCable Boxes\n\nSatellite Receivers\n\nDigital Video Recorders (DVR)\n\nBlu-ray and DVD players\n\nA/V Receivers\n\nGaming systems\n\nPersonal Computers\n\nOther video devices (cameras, camcorders, etc.)\n\nA: Cable, Satellite, Blu-ray, DVD, etc.\n\nB: TV\n\nSettings in these devices can affect the resolution (480, 720, 1080, 2160) and aspect ratio (4:3, 16:9) of the signal and can affect how the picture is displayed on the TV. For more information, refer to the What do the terms Resolution and Aspect Ratio mean for my television? answer.\n\nGenerally, the settings of the device connected to your TV should be set to match the highest resolution your TV can accept (480, 720, 1080, 2160). If you have a wide-screen TV, the aspect ratio of the device connected to the TV should be set to 16:9 if possible.\n\nSetting the TV - Automatic Modes (back to top)\n\nIMPORTANT: To find the settings for specific models, please check Operating Instructions on your TV.\n\nMost televisions have settings that can automatically determine the best way to show the picture on the screen. These settings can be accessed from the menu of the television. Depending on your model, access the settings from the remote control as follows:\n\nNOTE: If your remote control has a button label Wide, Zoom or go to the next section Setting the TV - Manual Modes.\n\nHow to turn on/off Auto Wide\n\nOpen the Settings screen. How to access Settings\n\nUsing the Quick Settings button (For models released in 2019 or later)\n\nOn the remote control, press the (Quick Settings) button.\n\nSelect Settings.\n\nUsing the HOME or MENU button\n\nOn the remote control, press the HOME or MENU button.\n\nSelect Settings. (For Android TV™, select Settings)\n\nThe next steps will depend on your TV menu options:\n\nSelect Display & Sound or Picture & Display — Screen.\n\nSelect Display or System settings — Screen.\n\nSelect Screen.\n\nTurn on the following settings (if available)\n\nSet Wide mode to Auto or Auto Wide to ON.\n\nSet Auto Display Area to ON.\n\nNOTE: When Wide mode is Auto or Auto Wide is ON, it will automatically changes the wide mode according to the input signal from an external equipment. If you want to keep your preferred setting, select Off.\n\nPress the Home or Menu button to exit the settings.\n\nPlay content from your connected device(s) to see if this resolves the issue. If not, continue to the next section.\n\nSetting the TV - Manual Modes (back to top)\n\nSome signals received by your television may not be displayed correctly with the automatic modes. In this case you can manually change display modes to try to correct the issue.\n\nCheck your remote control for a button labeled Wide, Zoom or . This button will cycle through the available Wide Mode settings that may allow the signal to be displayed correctly.\n\nPress the button on your remote control repeatedly to change the wide mode.\n\nA: example of a button on the remote\n\nNOTE: If your remote does not have one of these buttons, the settings are available in the menu of the TV.
