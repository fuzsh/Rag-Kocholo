Is 720 necessary, should I really get one that has both, because i have a great deal on one that only gets 1080i. thanks\n\nxvxvxvx\n\nUnregistered guest\n\nPosted on\n\nCurrently no display actually displays more than one native HD resolution. If you purchase a CRT it will natively display 1080i. If you purchase a fixed pixel type display such as DLP LCD LCOS they will display in 720p.\n\nAs far as an HDTV that only gets 480 this does not make any sense. please list the exact TV you are considering, manufacturer and model number.\n\nxvxvxvx\n\nOmaha\n\nUnregistered guest\n\nPosted on\n\nI personally think 720p looks alot smoother when it comes to fast action. You still get flicker with 1080i due to the fact it is interlaced. 720p draws all 720 lines per 1/60th of a second. 1080i only draws every other line (540 lines each pass) per 1/60th of a second. If you want to watch alot of football, 720p is definitly the way to go if you can afford a fixed pixel display (LCD, LCoS, DLP, D-iLA.\n\nAnonymous\n\nPosted on\n\n480P picture is ED, not HD. If you have a Progressive scan DVD player, you can get 480P otherwise you have 480i. I bet the TV Tom was talking about is a CRT HDTV that displays HD in 1080i (convert 720P signal to 1080i also) and SD to 480i. 720P is better for fast moving pictures such as sports. But if it is not a big screen, you would hardly notice the difference.\n\nNew member\n\nUsername: Hilltom\n\nPost Number: 2\n\nRegistered: Sep-04\n\nPosted on\n\nSorry, it doesn't only get 480, it also gets 1080i, and yes, sports is the main reason I want it.

In some situations, 720p does look better, despite the technical info you provide. I did not know that you could purchase a digital tv that only displays 480. Are you sure about this?\n\nNew member\n\nUsername: Vikingknut\n\nPost Number: 10\n\nRegistered: Mar-05\n\nPosted on\n\nCarlos,\n\nSome of the reason that you may see a better picture with 1080i is that your TV is CRT based. Unlike micro-display technology LCD, DLP, and Plasma, CRTs do not display non-interlaced signals very well. Therefore, for CRT based systems, people tend to prefer 1080i over 720p. In my case (DLP-set), 1080i almost always looks worse than 720p. Now you could argue that having only 720 lines of resolution, of course 720p will look better. It has the same number of lines as your native display and is non-interlaced. However, there is more to it than that. This is my belief (albeit backed by many professional video folks), that even if you had a TV that supports 1080p (which will support both 1080i and 1080p natively), the 720p picture will look better on any program that has even a moderate amount of movement. Sports, for sure, and even most movies. Material that stays pretty static on the screen (beautiful vistas, talking heads, etc.) may look better in 1080i.\n\nNow as I said in the beginning, this will probably not be the case for those watching CRT based HDTV's.\n\nfrankie nj\n\nUnregistered guest\n\nPosted on\n\nI just bought a Mitsubishi WD-52327 DLP TV. The only HDTV format it supports is 1080i. It says in the manual that a 720p signal must be converted by the DTV receiver to be displayed by the tv. I am getting Comcast HDTV service but I'm unsure if the box is capable of the conversion. Am I screwed? Do I need a special conversion component? Would appreciate some help.\n\npaulm\n\nUnregistered guest\n\nPosted on\n\nFrankie,\n\nUsually the cable provider's set top box will allow you to switch between resolutions - the DCT5100, for example, can go between 1080i, 720p, 480p and 480i.\n\nAnonymous\n\nPosted on\n\nI'm kinda' new at this.

My Hitachi 57S700 offers 2 modes (16x9 and 16x9 zoom)of display for 720p or 1080i inputs and 5 modes (16x9, 16x9 zoom, 4x3, 4x3 stretch and 4x3 zoom) for 480i/p inputs. I would choose 480p options when watching SDTV material and use the 4x3 mode because I don't like the distorted pictures.\n\nRob in Orlando\n\nUnregistered guest\n\nPosted on\n\nThanks guys, I posted as Anonymous at 11:18 am.\n\nThe reason I ask is as follows: my Samsung 32\" flat panel LCD HDTV accepts the four resolutions (480i, 480p, 720p, 1080i). I have a Scientific Atlanta 8300HD set top box from Bright House (Time Warner). In the box's options, I can select the resolutions that my TV can display. However, when I have all four resolutions checked, it seems to flicker and jump a lot when switching from a resolution on one channel to a different resolution on another channel. It flickers so much, it almost looks like it is damaging the display. Once the new channel comes up everything is fine. I can tell by the box that it does switch to match the resolution that the channel is broadcast in unless I uncheck one of the resolutions.\n\nWhat is my strategy here? Should I just select 1080i and not select the other 3 resolutioins, or should I select all four and just deal with the momentary jumping and flickering? Maybe just select 1080i and 720p? Are there pros and cons?\n\nThanks for reading, I'm sure I don't sound very technical. I appreciate any help.\n\nSilver Member\n\nUsername: Paul_ohstbucks\n\nPost Number: 730\n\nRegistered: Jan-05\n\nPosted on\n\nRob.......\n\nyes, your best bet is to leave it on one mode as default rather than have your TV detect and change resolutions all the time.\n\nSet it at either 1080 or 720, and just leave it that way.(whichever mode you prefer)\n\nJetson\n\nUnregistered guest\n\nPosted on\n\nRob:\n\nI have the Scientific Atlanta 3250HD, and I have set my T.V. to accept the 1080i and 480P (because my t.v. won't display 720P).\n\nIn your case i would set the T.V. to accept the 1080i, 720P, and the 480P. This will allow you to watch your HD Channels in the mode that they are broadcast in (i.e. Your T.V. won't upconvert ESPN HD to 1080i).\n\nAlso, Your Non-HD \"DIGITAL\" channels are broadcast in 480P, and your analog signals can be converted to 480P from 480i, so choosing 480i as an option is worthless. The 480P picture of your analog channels will look much better than the 480i..\n\nBottom line, try setting your STB to broadcasat in 1080i, 720P, and 480P, and see how that works. You will still get the flicker, but it is only a brief second, and you probably don't jump from back and forth from HD to Non HD.\n\nHint: Make sure you select 480P \"standard\" or \"4:3\". As these channels are broadcast in 4:3 mode and not 16:9, your t.v. will automatically stretch the picture to fit your t.v. (assuming you have a 16:9 t.v.) This allows you to use the \"aspect\" button on your t.v. remote to change the screen size.\n\nIf you choose 480P widescreen, it will broadcast your HD channels in 480P, at least it did on my t.v. I learned this the hard way.\n\nTroy Heagy\n\nUnregistered guest\n\nPosted on\n\n\"CRTs do not display non-interlaced signals very well.\"\n\n.\n\nFunny.

My CRT seems to display my non-interlaced computer screen just fine.\"\n\nActually it doesn't at all.

This results in reduced viewing quality. My T.V. (Panasonic 47WX53)automatically \"fills\" the screen when watching a non-HD channel. If you only select 1080i and 720P, you will have to use your comcast remote to \"stretch\" the picture when watching Non-HD channels. Usually a T.V. does a better job of filling the screen then a STB can stretch the screen to remove the bars on the side.\n\nI would try it each way for about two weeks and make a decision based on what works best for you. Remember it takes time for your eyes to adjust to your t.v. after you make adjustments, so give it some time.\n\nSilver Member\n\nUsername: Joe_c\n\nOakwood , Ga\n\nPost Number: 230\n\nRegistered: Mar-05\n\nPosted on\n\ndale you prefer 720p over 1080?\n\nAnonymous\n\nPosted on\n\nQuestion, if anybody can help:\n\nI have Panasonic 60\" LCD HDTV monitor\n\nComcast HD box going dvi out to hdmi in\n\nI can choose one setting to output from the box; should I choose 720p or 1080i?\n\nWhen I choose 720p, my HD programs are in 720p\n\nwhen I choose 1080i, my hd programs are 1080i\n\nShould I just manually switch them all the time; like for sports..etc..\n\nsorry if I ask silly question\n\nRoyBrown\n\nUnregistered guest\n\nPosted on\n\n\"I have Panasonic 60\" LCD HDTV monitor\"\n\nYour TV is probably 720p native, so you should probably select 720p. This way you will see 720p channels natively. For 1080i, the selection really just affects which device does the conversion from 1080i to 720p. If you select 1080i, the TV does the conversion. If you select 720p, the cable box does the conversion. The output quality will depend on which device has the better scaler. Changing selections based on channel sounds like a pain, so I'd be inclined to leave it on 720p all the time unless you notice a significant difference in quality.\n\n720p and 1080i are pretty close in native quality as far as I can tell, but both will look worse coverted than the other displayed natively. There is no reason that a CRT can't display 720p and 1080i natively like computer monitors, but my understanding is that most HD CRT televisions display 1080i native and convert 720p to 1080i or 480p.

However if it is like most Sony CRT's it will not even accept a 720p input, much less downconvert it to 480p.\n\nYou are probably confusing an SD broadcast on a channel that ocassionally transmits an HD signal.

There are fanboys who will argue until they are blue in the face for each format, but does it really matter? Just be glad you have HD. Seriously, watch a game in SD and and you'll wonder how you ever enjoyed TV before HD. Your set has a native resolution of 1280 x 720 which means any HD signal you feed it will look great. End of story. It's inputs accept 480/720/1080 signals, and it converts everything to 720p. Is 1080i better? Is 720p better? It's HD- don't worry about the rest!\n\n2) Your DVD player probably converts the DVD 480p signal to a higher resolution format by way of a built in line doubler or scaler. Yes, there are 2 new DVD formats on the way, both with higher capacity and therefore more info able to be displayed. There are rumors of combining both standards into 1 (which would be better for consumers) but as of Thursday May 19th, 2:15 PM EST, there are 2 formats. Yes, it will probably be a rehash of BetaMAX/VHS for the consumer market. Your DVD player will not be able to play bluRay/HD-DVD discs, unless these discs are encoded with today's DVD standard. HD-DVD might be backwards compatible, but your DVD player will not be able to decode the full HD-DVD standard.\n\n3) Tell us more about your cable/satellite system. What market (city) are you in? Are you using an HD set top box? Are you using cableCARD? Are you tuning over the air? Are you tuned to the SD channel when there is an HD channel available? These are things we need to know.\n\niworkforcable\n\nUnregistered guest\n\nPosted on\n\ngreg may 11 - not many poeple broadcast in 720 the box will display it if its coming to u in that format like fox hd - look on the back of your t.v it sometimes says what it supports\n\nlike 1080/480 which means no 720 is supported\n\nRon JL\n\nUnregistered guest\n\nPosted on\n\nJust to thank everyone for this great discussion, you have solved several of my problems just from reading here.

I sell, as part of my job, high def. video production systems. A whole aspect of the equation these arguments tend to miss are the production and post-production stages, as well as broadcast (OTA, cable, satellite, etc.)\n\nThere is way more complexity than 720p vs. 1080i. What HD encoders are used, what production workflow is followed, what compressors are used... There are MANY factors in the HD production pipeline that make a difference to quality, well before the broadcast hits your TV set. Because of this, in real-world scenarios, no direct 720p vs. 1080i comparisons can even be made, despite which set you use and whether its native resolution matches that of the broadcast itself.\n\nThe \"better\" and \"worse\" broadcasts people talk about may have crappy compression (often the case, and varying greatly between over-the-air, cable, and satellite, as well as between channels, and even between different HD shows on the same channel). These qualities you find appealing or not appealing may have nothing at all to do with the resolution it was shot in, or progressive scan vs. interlaced playback.\n\nConsider this: two groups of people could be issued the EXACT same set of production, post-production, broadcast, and playback equipment for HD, and come up with VERY different results in terms of picture quality.\n\nBronze Member\n\nUsername: Avernus\n\nPost Number: 15\n\nRegistered: Jul-05\n\nPosted on\n\nI agree with Nicky G...because the INHD channels I receive are in crystal clear quality...appearing in better picture than what is shot on most other HD channels...\n\nThe broadcast plays a huge factor in the reception..\n\nAgrees with Nicky\n\nUnregistered guest\n\nPosted on\n\nWay to go, Nicky.

It is the fault of Dish that you have macro blocking and pixelation on your display.

What you have now is most likely the best you will ever see with Dish save in the unlikely event that they temporarily increase the bandwidth used for their HD channels after the MPEG4 conversion. Keep in mind that for quite some time they will continue broadcasting the MPEG2 data streams until all customers have new receivers capable of processing the MPEG4 codecs.\n\nA 1080p display will not have any more detail using the same compressed signal of either 720p or 1080i.

All customers have MPEG-2 receivers/decoders and when Dish decides to switch the compression, all receivers/decoders must be switched, right? Unless it will be optional which would make life terribly frustrating...\n\nAnyway, doesn't satellite radio use MPEG-4 and as a result, customers are able to hear DVD audio? Unless I'm mistaken in my logic, I would think MPEG-4 would help one to better receive HD content...\n\nMaybe this shitty picture is a result of conversion going on from digital to analog? I'm currently running component cables from the receiver to the projector. Think DVI may provide less conversion and less shittiness?\n\nBTW, I was just saying 1080p was awesome in and of itself, sorry about the ambiguity.\n\nfx\n\nUnregistered guest\n\nPosted on\n\nIf MPEG4 compression was used and the initial signal babdwidth either stayed the same or increased the quality will invrese. Video and audio are so much different. You can transmit 30 audio channels compressed in the MPEG4 format in the same amount of bandwidth required to transmit a signal HD data stream using the same compression techniques.\n\nNot understanding the difference in video and audio compression is why many people think MPEG4 will drastically help HD quality, it likely will not but that is up to the implementation of the individual retranmission providers which include Sat companies, cable companies and even the local and national broadcast companies. Due to the drastic increase in multi-casting I expect HD to stay the same quality at best and likely continue to degrade as time goes on.\n\nxvxvxvx\n\nBronze Member\n\nUsername: D_singh\n\nPost Number: 34\n\nRegistered: Sep-05\n\nPosted on\n\nThanks a lot man. You're quite educated in this field. I take it that HD is give and take...want more channels in HD? Sacrifice quality.\n\nBUT, I would certainly hope that with current and advancing technologies that a fundamental problem like this can be fixed. Maybe decreasing the total bandwidth used with a larger compression index?\n\nfx\n\nUnregistered guest\n\nPosted on\n\nThanks for the compliment Mr Singh. As you compress more you lose data so there is a practical limit which MPEG4 will likely reach.\n\nA few bits of info on compression:\n\nCompression removes duplicate data from one field to the next. In scenes with little motion the data is compressed a great deal since duplicate portions of each field/frame are eliminated then reconstructed by the MPEG decoder on the receiving end. The more motion in a program, such as sports, the less a frame can be compressed otherwise you will see jerky movement. When fast action is transmitted and the data is necessarily compressed less you need increased bandwidth to keep the same quality. Unfortulately nearly all data transmissions today used a fixed bandwidth.\n\nIt becomes a compromise of allowing enough bandwidth for the average bitrate of all the programming on a specific channel. The end result is either very beautiful if the transmitting entity allows 19MPS bandwidth and MPEG4 compression you get the best possible picture on your display. Unfortunately most Sat companies use half that amount so HD programming suffers.\n\nIn case you have any local channels which multicast you will see the difference. In my locale ABC, CBS and NBC local afilliates all multicast up to three data streams for each channel. This becomes most evident on prime time HD programming.\n\nI hope this clarifies matters somewhat.\n\nForgive any mispellings, I am too tired to proofread my post.\n\nxvxvxvx\n\nNew member\n\nUsername: Maxman\n\nPost Number: 1\n\nRegistered: Nov-05\n\nPosted on\n\nObservations with Toshiba 30HF85 HDTV tube & Charter's HD DVR cable service:\n\nAfter roughly a week of research and experimentation with the above combination, I've finally dialed into what I perceive to be the best recipe for output/input settings & cable configurations.\n\nAfter initial set up of the HD DVR box (Sci Atlanta Explorer 8x00HD) and the Toshiba 30' widescreen tube, my reaction was one of dissapointment.\n\nWith DVR output set to 1080i & component video inputs connections to TV, the contrast ratio of the HD programs seemed out of whack. Human faces were shadowed (one side bright, the other side dark) and the set seemed to be hunting for the correct brightness level as the scene changed. Not good!\n\nAfter reading this post and other sources of info, along with a fair amount of trial and error, I have now achieved what I have to think is 'near perfect' for this combination of source and components.\n\nHere's my recipe (in order of importance):\n\n1) HDMI cable - this made a huge improvement to the contrast / brightness issue! The HDMI digital feed is clearly better than component, at least for this particular configuration. I attribute this to the TV's conversion capability being better than the DVR.\n\n2)Set the DVR output to 720p - the perceived clarity and overall quality of the image is better when compared to the 1080i feed. Given that the Toshiba converts everything to 1080i anyway, I'm surprised at these results.\n\n3)Adjust the TV's contrast, brightness and color temperature settings to your liking.\n\n...bake at 72 degrees on Discovery HD channel and the results are fantastic!\n\nThanks to all who contributed to this thread, especially those of you who posted accurate info ;)\n\nBubba Jimmy\n\nUnregistered guest\n\nPosted on\n\nYo, I currently own a Mitsubishi WS-55313, and just found out that it's only outputs are 480i/480p/1080i.

In the past I've always thought that the concerts on my local PBS-HD channel (San Diego) and the people filming the football games and other sporting events somehow got ahold of the \"good\" cameras. LOL I was always amazed that concerts and sporting events always seemed to look that much better. DiscoveryHD is also a nice one for me. When there is nothing on TV I will just flip to DiscoveryHD, mute the sound, and read the paper. I look up everyone once in awhile and say, \"ooo, pretty.\" Makes sense knowing that some stations care more (or can afford to) and take the extra step to give us truly beautiful HD.\n\n(Another one I have to mention is CSI:Miami. I always record this one in HD. I believe that the people making this show actually CARE about the quality. Upon returning from every commercial break they almost always have some absolutely stunning vistas of Miami.)\n\nAnother question that I think is going to become relevant soon, if it isn't already, is what is 1080p going to do to this landscape? The TV's are already here with Toshiba, Mitsubishi, and Samsung already making 1080p DLP sets for fairly reasonable prices (which I'm assuming will only continue to come down.) How about the transmissions? Does anyone know if anything is even transmitting in 1080p? Or if they are even PLANNING on transmitting 1080p? I get kind of giggly thinking about this \"next step\" and wonder if I should wait a bit for 1080p sets to come down in price and broadcasters to start sending 1080p signals.

Everyone including cable companies have a finite amount of bandwidth available, compression techniques will not change this neither will a cable company be able to improve an already degraded video signal. Fox, ABC, NBC, CBS, WPN, ESPN and others determine how good the HD signal will can be at it's best. As does the Discovery HD channel and INHD1 and INHD2 which have the very best quality available period. They both transmit full bandwidth uncompressed video to the cable companies and Sat companies alike. What is done with it afterwards is up to your provider.\n\nAn (expensive) alternative is a C-Band dish and receiver. With that large Sat dish you can get unedited uncompressed video unavailabel from other sources. A good example is the talk in the broadcast booth during commercial breaks. It all becomes available on C-Band if unencrypted. Pretty interesting if you have the space and money to devote to C-Band.

We're stuck with 720p/1080i for life? Compression techniques won't improve allowing more transmission with the same bandwidth? Broadcast companies won't use better and better feeds and find ways to transmit them? I understand you are much more knowledgeable in this area than I but you sound like the guy who said, \"color TV? Not possible. The technology barely exist to transmit black and white images.\" \"The moon? Are you joking?

Unless yours does, I don't see the benefits to encode video into 1080i (1080 vertical lines) just to have your TV take it back down to less than 800. Now if you have one of those fancy plasmas that support more than 1000 lines then you may get some benefit from 1080i.\n\nIn my case, I have a 50\" Panasonic (th-50phd8uk) and it's display supports 768 vertical lines. So I use 780p to get the progressive scanning benefits (less flickering). The 780 progressive lines are coverted into 768 lines that physically are shown on the screen.\n\nI played around comparing HD channels from my comcast digital HD box using both 1080i and 720p settings. I found that 720p was noticably better. Perhaps my TV doesn't handle the 1080i into 768 lines very well.\n\nfx\n\nUnregistered guest\n\nPosted on\n\nEric,\n\nYou are confusing horizontal and vertical resolution. Any HDCRT is capable of displaying 1080 lines it is the 1920 dots of horizontal resolution that may not be completely rendered by the display circuitry.\n\nThe reason a plasma doesn't display 1080 lines is because it is a 720p native resolution display. It converst any input to 720p. And again no one should care about that portion of the 1080 x 1920.\n\nxvxvxvx\n\nrayman27\n\nUnregistered guest\n\nPosted on\n\nHonestly, My xbox 360 looks brighter and clearer using 1080i. 720p setting looks much darker and less detailed.\n\nNew member\n\nUsername: Danadane\n\nSt. anthony , Iowa U.S.A\n\nPost Number: 1\n\nRegistered: Dec-05\n\nPosted on\n\ni have an xbox 360 and a high def. t.v,and i want the best picture for my games what resolution is better for gaming 1080i or 720p.\n\nmy t.v only supports 480 and 1080i though but i just want to know which one would look better.pls help thanks.\n\nUnregistered guest\n\nPosted on\n\nWow - what a Thread!\n\nfx - I am sure I am just one of multitude that appreciates your time spent on this thread. Thank you.\n\nNote to you gamers: 360 will send what ever signal you want, just play it in your native and it will be fine. If your native is 720p (i.e you have a flat panel) run 720. All things being the same 1080i is better, but all things are rarely the same (see rant below).\n\nIncednetally I understand the HD-DVD industry is going 1080 not 720, and 1080p panels just got a lot cheaper:\n\n***RANT***\n\nAbout an earlier post -- Brad Johnson -- you may know a lot about this HD stuff, who knows, but what your saying actually kinda smells a bit. IMHO the number one problem with HD is that I can go out with my cellphone, take some footage, re-edit in 1080i and say --\"Check it out -- HD!\"\n\nThe problem, to be a little less sarcastic, is that all HD cameras were NOT created equal, and it only starts there. I have a 1280x1024 projector (a freaking steal on eBay at $600 -- woohoo!), and my father has one of the finest HDTV's made, the 65\" Mitsubishi. On many signals his FAR superior television looks just a little better. But I have seen some footage, wasn't much, but he nabbed in on his HDVCR and played it for me. My jaw hit the floor, and understand -- I'm used to pretty darn good HD. Maybe some one with coke bottle thick glasses shouldn't be judging the merits of HD, but ANYONE can tell when everything clicks.\n\nI think in terms of math, so forgive the analogy (although I think it a perfect description). But imagine the process of creating an HD picture a series of percentages multiplied by each other, and then your actual TV just capping what it sees\n\nExample 1:\n\nSubject material: 98%\n\nCamera : 70%\n\nEditing: 80%\n\nBroadcast: 97%.\n\nA substandard HDTV: 60%\n\nResult: 98%x70%x80%x97% = 53.2% and that falls under the cap of 60% so the viewer sees 53.2%. Obviously on the very best TV the image would roughly the same.\n\nExample 2:\n\nSubject material: 98%\n\nCamera : 98%\n\nEditing: 98%\n\nBroadcast: 97%\n\nIn this case, which is the exact same material (say a football game) and broadcaster (say NBC) and the result is 91.3% . A great television with a 90% cap compared to the 60% would be 150% better (1.5x60 = 90). But there both 1080! They're both NBC! They're both the same football game! Weakest link. Limiting factor. It's not what is the same -- its what isn't that matters. I just listed a few factors. I imagine there are just as many more I didn't list.\n\nThe problem is, the manufacturers know this better than anyone, and that's why they can sell a 540 tv as 1080 and much of the public is too ignorant to know the difference. It is rare to see a picture where everything is hitting on all eight cylinders.\n\n*end rant*\n\nSorry for the rant -- just my 2 cents.\n\nPPS - I am hoping HD-DVD wil change that, and that 1080p will be something we get to see more of. When good material is readily availiable at 1080p, I'll be getting a 1080p device - until then, I guess my hunk a junk will do.\n\nBrad C. Johnson\n\nUnregistered guest\n\nPosted on\n\nSPeach,\n\nIt would be most difficult to explain the error of your thinking since you have no comprehension of simple bob deinterlacing on a 1080i signal to a 720p display.

Will this flickering damage my Hitachi rear projection TV?\"\n\nNo, it shouldn't damage your rptv.\n\nYou know, we, as consumers, would be able to better assess which cable/sat companies and which consumer products would better suit our needs.. should manufacturers of the devices list which internal scaler (model #) is being used in each device. You'd think that just maybe a $4000 hdtv would likely have a higher-end internal scaler than would a $200 dvd player or $400 sat/cable receiver. Right ?? What I've observed (through application and readings) is that IT VARIES.\n\nI own one of the best HDTV's available, today;\n\nSony's KDF-60XS955. I'm using the Explorer 8300HF (HD DVR) through Time Warner with U2V600HD's (24k gold plated hdmi 4' Monster cables)\n\nWould you believe the DVR's scaler is a higher quality than the one in my XS ? Of course there are high-end EXTERAL scaling devices (ranging from about $2500 to tens of thousands of dollars) usually used with high-end projectors that will kick azz compared to the ones previously mentioned. (i.e. Lumagen Vision Pro Video Scaler)\n\nBut for most consumers we'd gave better display results just knowing what, exactly, we're working with.\n\nIn the mean time.. I've gotten displays with fewer artifacts using the scaler (processor) in the set top box (STB) and DVD player. (fyi the highest rated HD-DVD player, hands down, is the OPDV971H by Oppo) due to it's processor. The digital output (DVI) beat 39 other DVD players from 11 other companies including Panasonic, Pioneer, Sony, Toshiba, Samsung, LG, Onkyo, Teac, Oritron, Harmon Kardon, and McCormack. The price range of these products was $199 to $13,000. Guess who sells for $199 ?. . . Oppo.\n\nhttp://www.projectorcentral.com/oppo_opdv971h_dvd_player.htm\n\nSend this Page Home > Projector Reviews > A Winning Digital DVD Player\n\nA Winning Digital DVD Player\n\nDavid Colin - July 7, 2005\n\nProjectorCentral.com\n\nEvery once in awhile a new company arrives on the scene with an exceptional product. Such is the case with Oppo Digital and the introduction of its OPDV971H digital DVD player, also referred to as the Oppo 971 in this article.\n\nSo who is Oppo? They certainly are not a household name and with good reason as Oppo is a newly created North American branch of BBK Electronics of China, a giant in the manufacture of consumer electronics, employing 12,000 people worldwide. So while Oppo is a new name, the company and the technology behind it are quite substantial.\n\nOppo's task in North America is to build the Oppo brand by focusing on quality and customer support. You will not find this product at a local store just yet. Oppo wants to build demand by first establishing its reputation. To do this, it wants some firsthand experience with its customers and the fastest way to get it is to sell direct. (Update September 12, 2005: Oppo has begun to sell direct to some selected dealers. See Where to Buy below.)\n\nSo what makes the Oppo OPDV971H DVD player so hot? While its form factor is sleek with a low profile and uncluttered look, its digital performance is without equal at apparently any price based on the 2005 DVD Player Benchmark shootout by Secrets of Home Theater and High Fidelity that ended last month. The Oppo OPDV971H digital output (DVI) beat 39 other DVD players from 11 other companies including Panasonic, Pioneer, Sony, Toshiba, Samsung, LG, Onkyo, Teac, Oritron, Harmon Kardon, and McCormack. The price range of these products was $199 to $13,000. Guess who sells for $199 . . . Oppo.\n\nLike an earlier post mentioned.. another factor with flicker/artifacts is the conversion that must take place when sending a 720p signal to 768/788 native display panel. The tv set has to scale the signal to fill 768/788 lines of diplay space with 720 lines of video information.. which can cause unwanted artifacts and somewhat of a delay. So the flickering is, more than likely, caused by the processing\n\nCJB\n\nUnregistered guest\n\nPosted on\n\nHi, I started reading the above comments and stuff, and have become really interested in all this HDTV stuff.

This is the first year for portable wireless hand held HD cameras to be used by the networks and they are still heavy, bulky and expensive.

All programming on HD channels is not always broadcast in HD.

U.S.\n\nPost Number: 867\n\nRegistered: Mar-05\n\nPosted on\n\nIn other words John, the programming you are watching is being broadcast in SD (standard def), hence the pillar bars to the left and right of the screen. This is most common on local network HD channels, especially local news broadcast and commercials. Since SD is 4:3 and not 16:9 you get the bars, as Scooby indicated you can zoom to eliminate them, but the originating source isn't always HD. It's best to leave them as is so you're not cropping true 16:9 pictures. Since the bars are embedded at the source, your TV will display it is a 1080i/16:9 picture even though it really is a 480i/4:3. Remember when you zoom, or zoom wide, it will distort the 4:3 nature of the picture combined with the fact that it is an SD picture it's not going to look near as good as the true (non-upconverted) 1080i or 720p HD picture.\n\nNew member\n\nUsername: Username20061110\n\nPost Number: 1\n\nRegistered: Nov-06\n\nPosted on\n\nHere is some insight (and more than you probably wanted to know) about HD & SD sports production - coming from a guy who has been in the television sports production industry for many years before HD....\n\nIn most cases HD sports broadcast television productions don't mix HD/SD formats - all cameras shooting the field or court are matched for HD only production or SD only production. However HD productions are often down-converted after (or before) the transmission leaves the truck for broadcast to SD subscribers. HD cameras send the video signal to the truck via glass fiber cables. SD cameras send their signals via copper triax cables. The truck will send the video signal to a nearby satellite uplink truck or via other landline transmission to be distributed by the networks and cable providers. More and more sports production trucks are going HD (because transmissions can always be down-converted to SD subscribers - and the demand continues for HD subscribers). Also, in most cases at this time, HD camera operators shoot for a 4:3 audience because if HD is down-converted to SD then the SD audience sees a properly composed shot (ie all 10 players on the basketball court from the 'game camera' shot)- the HD audience sees a wider composed shot. SD productions are rarely if ever up-converted to HD (there are occasions where tape from a previous SD broadcast is played back for a live HD broadcast). When HD sports production began there was an HD truck along-side an SD truck - one SD cam op operated next to the HD op (it got a little crowded).\n\nUnfortunately with satellite up/down-link compression, redistribution, modulations, additional distributions etc. the final display on HD or SD televisions appear very compressed (and time delayed) regardless if you subscribe to HD or SD content (especially with dish services).\n\nAlso unfortunately, too many subscribers (most of the sports bars in the U.S.) view 4:3 NTSC video stretched on a 16:9 display which just isn't the right way to view a 4:3 sports broadcast!\n\n:o)\n\n-B\n\nNew member\n\nUsername: Scharbag\n\nPost Number: 1\n\nRegistered: Nov-06\n\nPosted on\n\nHere is some reading that might interest you.\n\nhttp://alvyray.com/DigitalTV/Naming_Proposal.htm\n\nRemember that you MUST compare apples to apples. ALL flat-pannel displays are made of a FIXED number of pixels. This can not be altered, no matter what signal you input to them. If a screen was made to display 1080i NATIVELY then it will not do a great job at 720p due to the fact that electronics within the TV will have to convert the picture from 720p to 1080i. This is much like using your LCD computer monitor at a non-native resolution. It will look fuzzy compared to the native resolution.\n\nThe rub is that 1080p will be king (if they figure out how to send it to us without breaking rules of broadcating) but right now there is very little 1080p material out there. This is the problem: I buy a native 720p TV cause I like sports and want to eliminate flicker, now 1080p looks bad cause it is downsampled to fit on my smaller pixel area OR I buy a native 1080i TV and watch 1080i (and native 1080p IF the set is TRUE 1080p) natively and have an upsampled but fuzzy 720p picture. The second choice is better for the future, the first is better for the now. BUT, in practice, 1080i is not even broadcast at 1080i:\"***1080/30i is defined to be 1080 lines of 1920 pixels each delivered every 1/30th of a second (540 of them at a time), but it is implemented by its practitioners as 1035 lines of 1440 pixels each. Even Joel Brinkley of the New York Times - strongly in the Interlacers camp - uses these numbers. Of course, the format should be called 1035/30i in this case (or, by the renaming proposal, 518/60i).\" So if you buy a TV now, hoping to display NATIVE 1080p (1920X1080) in the future, you will not be able to display 1080i (1440 X 1035 as implimented) or 720p (1280 X 720) natively.\n\nAs far as is 1080i better than 720p I would give my vote to 720p. 1080i should really be called 540i because we only get 540 lines every 1/60th of a second vs 720 lines per 1/60th of a second with 720p. Yes 1080i has more pixels, but 720p eliminates interlace flicker which can be annoying in high motion situations.\n\nThis whole mess is another example of big-business JUMPING into the frey without looking what is below. Now we will all have to be frustrated with the new BS about BlueRay and HD-DVD!! Bahh, why can it not be simpler!!\n\nNew member\n\nUsername: Lisa1018\n\nPost Number: 1\n\nRegistered: Dec-06\n\nPosted on\n\nHi all,\n\nI am new to this board but it looks helpful for the question I have.

Why not connect them both and then you decide which is better for you.\n\nGranted, the logical choice would seem to be the 1080p capable player. However, it would be best to try them both and then choose. Besides video resolution, you'd be able to compare audio, unit display, setup menu's, and the feel of the remote to get the one that suits you the best.\n\nIf you have 2 hdmi cables, then you can set up each player to their best setting then just compare them side to side by switching your inputs on the tv.\n\nBut if you don't have and don't feel like pickin up an additional one. Just grab a couple of movies and try out scenes from each on each dvd player and then make your choice.\n\nI apologize for any redundancy. hah\n\nNew member\n\nUsername: Luisfc1972\n\nPost Number: 1\n\nRegistered: Dec-07\n\nPosted on\n\nI AM CONFUSED!!!!!!!!!!!!!\n\nI own a Sony Grand Wega KDF-E60A20, Toshiba A3 (which I will receive tomorrow) and dish network High Definition cable.\n\nI want to bash my head in regarding 720P vs 1080I. kasjdf;alskjadiopjfasdo\n\nAnyway, ive done TONS of research but i still have no idea what to do.
