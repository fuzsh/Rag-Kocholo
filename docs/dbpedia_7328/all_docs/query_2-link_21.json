        "text": "Broadcasters were using ancient equipment already when they were forced to upgrade to HD. They will be using that new equipment until it dies or they're mandated to make it even better. Some people were still editing reel-to-reel in 2010.\n\nI worked at a TV station for 5 years and they would rather upgrade the set than the technology. Most people that make large budgeting decisions do not know enough about technology to understand its importance.\n\nComcast is broadcasting terribly compressed on top of their bad signal\n\nNot only is it compressed, many stations that should be broadcast in \"HD\" are still in SD like Cooking Network, DIY, movie channels such as HBO/Showtime/Cinemax aside from the main channel. Plus, their Guide is a freaking joke, the channels are half hazardly thrown together in some random order that makes no sense, there is always an advertisement in the guide that takes up allot of space, so it is a nightmare to try to randomly find something to watch. I just use voice control to go to a few specific channels, sigh. I think part of the problem is they had some legacy layout in the guide and kept adding in random channels in HD and SD, when they should just throw everything out and start over and organize their freaking guide so it makes sense.\n\nNot only is it compressed, many stations that should be broadcast in \"HD\" are still in SD like Cooking Network, DIY, movie channels such as HBO/Showtime/Cinemax aside from the main channel.

I think part of the problem is they had some legacy layout in the guide and kept adding in random channels in HD and SD, when they should just throw everything out and start over and organize their freaking guide so it makes sense.\n\nYep. It's really bad. Of the 10 HBO channels, a whopping 2 are HD. And the signal quality is so compressed, it's like a blurry 480p at times. I almost always stream through HBO GO vs. watching anything live, especially for event programming. There are a few local broadcast channels that aren't compressed to hell - mainly prime time NFL broadcasts and that's about it. It's disgusting that they get away with it, but apparently most people don't notice. I've also seen them try and deny their differing compression is any different than others, but it's bullshit. My TWC feed when i was in NYC was literally 2x as good, minimum. When I moved, I thought I was watching SD feeds when it first came on. Oh well, no recourse.\n\nSatallite and cable don't even send HD, they send some half-HD compressed stuff so they can fit more sports and PPV in\n\nThat's not true. They send HD signals that are compressed to yes, fit more channels in, but they are still HD. It's not like OTA signals are any different no matter what people try to say.\n\nThere are 2 HD broadcast standards: 720p and 1080i and all channels labeled as \"HD\" are within either of these 2 standards\n\nATSC 1.0 and MPEG-2. Both were products of '90s technology, and aimed at CRTs. Running a 1080p CRT was insanely expensive.\n\nKeeping it at 1080i or 720p also frees up enough bandwidth to allow sub-channels, so broadcasters stick to those standards, and since that's the feed the cable carriers get, they stick with it there too.\n\nI know they shoehorned H.264 into ATSC 1.0, but I don't think I've heard of any broadcasters using it. They're skipping ATSC 2.0, and going straight to ATSC 3.0 in the near future, which uses HEVC (heck of an upgrade from MPEG-2) and will support 4K OTA. Gonna need a new set or set-top-box, though.\n\n1080i isn't sub-1080p. I mean, the experience is worse but not the resolution\n\nNot only is it compressed, many stations that should be broadcast in \"HD\" are still in SD like Cooking Network, DIY, movie channels such as HBO/Showtime/Cinemax aside from the main channel.

I think part of the problem is they had some legacy layout in the guide and kept adding in random channels in HD and SD, when they should just throw everything out and start over and organize their freaking guide so it makes sense.\n\nreally? all of these have been HD for years (10+?) on FIOS which mostly has to deal with the same QAM limitations for TV\n\n1080i isn't sub-1080p. I mean, the experience is worse but not the resolution\n\nreally? all of these have been HD for years (10+?) on FIOS which mostly has to deal with the same QAM limitations for TV\n\nI don't understand it either. DirecTV had none of these issues, it was incredibly rare that any station wasn't 1080i HD, but it seems like with Comcast nearly half the stations are still SD. And the Guide with DirecTV was a million times better, channel 13 was recognized as HD ABC without having to be channel 682 and similar stations were all grouped together such as all the big cable channels with original content, science/history channels, etc. I just went with Comcast because the all-in-one package was cheaper, especially when selecting high speed internet and wanting HBO/Showtime. Plus, any hint of rain just ruined DirecTV signal for me even though they tried to fix it multiple times (it should only go out during a really bad storm when you have a solid signal).\n\nreally? all of these have been HD for years (10+?) on FIOS which mostly has to deal with the same QAM limitations for TV\n\nBandwidth set aside for QAM TV on a cable provider takes away from bandwidth you could be using for internet. FiOS doesn't have this problem because it's not a copper based system.\n\nComcast is eventually moving away from QAM entirely and switching to IPTV in the not so distant future and channel quality might increase at that point. Some of their more niche channels are already IPTV, but don't have comcast cable to compare the two.\n\nPractically everyone has 1080P screens now, most people have 4K. Why are broadcasts still showing sub 1080P resolutions?\n\n4k cameras, encoding hardware, editing, etc. are all extra transmission costs.\n\nUA stations upgraded fully to HD/ATSC not too long ago. NTSC was around for much longer.\n\nThere is also licensing. Studios don't want unencrypted UHD content going OTA where it can be easily recorded.\n\nBandwidth and most casual viewers won't be able to tell much of a difference.\n\nBandwidth plus sports especially can be quite \"flickery\" at 1080p\n\nATSC 1.0 and MPEG-2. Both were products of '90s technology, and aimed at CRTs. Running a 1080p CRT was insanely expensive.\n\nKeeping it at 1080i or 720p also frees up enough bandwidth to allow sub-channels, so broadcasters stick to those standards, and since that's the feed the cable carriers get, they stick with it there too.\n\nI know they shoehorned H.264 into ATSC 1.0, but I don't think I've heard of any broadcasters using it.

Gonna need a new set or set-top-box, though.\n\n1) Bandwidth is not an issue for OTA.\n\n2) Any TV that supports Netflix UHD has a hardware HEVC decoder. That is used for multiple apps and could also be used for OTA broadcasts."
