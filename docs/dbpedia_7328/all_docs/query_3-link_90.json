It's very fine.\n\nMuch of what you are seeing are compression artifacts. More movement requires more bandwidth, and if bandwidth is unavailable, compression artifacts are the result. Verizon passes most channels as is, with exception to most premium movie channels, so this compression is applied by the local affiliate and/or content provider.\n\n@Deluxe wrote:\n\nThe reviewer from CNet told me to try it on 720p since that doesn't need to de-interlace. He's also saying it's the source, not the TV. Why would they give it such a high rating and recommend it if it's going to pixilate during fast action movies? Why would it be fine during DVD's? Doesn't it still have to de-interlace?\n\nThe reviewer probably meant a 720p channel. Changing output to 720p does not eliminate the need to deinterlace 1080i channels. But anything you see on a 720p channel like FOX, ABC, or ESPN is already deinterlaced...so long as you output it as 720p to your TV.\n\nMost TVs can correctly deinterlace 480i (SD) film sources; HD deinterlace is far more computationally intensive than SD.\n\n@Deluxe wrote:\n\nThanks for the reply. I'm not very tech savvy.\n\nI'm on the east coast. I have a 6 series box.\n\nDoes all this essentialy mean they're compressing the signal and that's why I'm getting some artifacts? I don't see the same problem when I play the same movies via DVD.\n\nThanks,\n\nScott\n\nIn general the answer is no. All the primary east coast premiums are sent on as delivered by the provider. The ones delivered in MPEG-4 are decoded and re-encoded as MPEG-2. It is possible that there is additional compression at this point, but I do not have any definitive information one way or the other.\n\nRemember, even what is passed directly is compressed at the source - both MPEG-2 and MPEG-4 are compressed formats. NO ONE provides an uncompressed signal (the bandwidth required is prohibitive), the only question is how much the source has been squeezed by the original provider to reduce bandwidth and this has nothing to do with Verizon.\n\nCurrently Verizon only puts 2 HD channels per QAM while Comcast is adding additional compression to get 3 HD channels per QAM.\n\n@Deluxe wrote:\n\nWhy would a movie I see on HBO, Starz, etc have the artifacts and the same movie via a DVD player not have it. If it was a problem with the TV it would have a problem either way wouldn't it?\n\nThanks,\n\nCompression. Standard definition on DVD and high-definition on Blu-ray uses far less compression than high-definition on cable.\n\nCompression is the main culprit, but your TV's inability to correctly deinterlace film on 1080i channels also contributes to the problem. Perhaps 80% of the defects you see are compression related and the other 20% are related to your TV's video processing.\n\nIf you want to see pristine high-definition content, buy a Blu-ray player (or PS3) and subscribe to Netflix. Rent the Blu-ray titles from Netflix or Blockbuster that are marked as \"tier0\" and \"tier1\" on the AVS Blu-ray Rankings thread. For Blu-ray player advice, see the AVS What Blu-ray Player to Buy thread. All Blu-ray players output in 1080p which takes most of your display's video processing out of the equation.\n\nThe problem is that most people can't understand the lengthy detailed highly technical answer.\n\nI restrained myself from being as sarcastic as I felt like being. If I wanted to be sarcastic I would have said that the person is trying hard to get attention and will always get less attention when it is attempted to be obtained using a lot of technical details that people don't understand.\n\nThe point I was trying to make is that the amount of data is the same for both 1080i and 1080p and that 1080i is required only for legacy CRT devices. If I am correct, then that is all that needs be said. Instead of saying that, which could be understood by most people and would be very useful, we get a huge article that is not useful for most people.\n\nThe thing that impresses me is when complex mechanisms are made simple enough to understand yet still being accurate and relevant.\n\nSome people try harder to explain what they think the other person does not understand than they try to understand the other person. Then they complain that the other person is not listening.\n\nI think I understood.\n\nFrom my point of view, KenAF was being inconsiderate by not listening to what I was asking. I do of course think I was being reasonable.\n\nNote that I never got an answer to my 2 simple questions that are very relevant to this topic. I asked nicely but did not get an answer so I made the best effort I could to get answers. KenAF refused to listen to me.\n\nIf we continue, we will simply repeat what has already been said. Unless you want to say make a sincere effort to solve the problem, I will refrain from answering.\n\n@JNTDPT wrote:\n\nI don't understand most of this discussion, but I appreciate the detail and patience you've shown both in your responses and attitude towards the obvious sarcasm hoisted your way. A question along these lines to you: if we were to purchase a new TV, what should we be looking for? Is 720p good enough? We just watch shows and movies, no gaming. THANKS!\n\nThe \"need\" for 1080p depends a lot on your display size and viewing resolution. If you are watching a 42\" screen from 12+', you are not going to perceive a difference between 720p and 1080p resolution. At that distance, the most obvious differences you'll see will be in color accuracy, contrast, and black levels (are the blacks really black? or grey?).\n\nIf you are looking for a display you can buy locally, and/or you need a 50\" TV with built-in speakers and a bundled stand for under $1800, then I would recommend the Panasonic TC-P50G10 plasma. It sells for $1799 at BestBuy and it can be had from Amazon.com for ~$1500 shipped. I would not buy anything smaller unless you sit closer than 6' from your TV. If viewing from more than 8', wait for the TC-P54G10, which should be available in another month for a small premium. A 58\" version is due this summer.\n\nI recommend based on personal experience, not reviews, but if you want to see a review, here's one at Cnet.\n\nRecommended settings for Panasonic TC-P46G10 (use these settings when they are posted)\n\nRecommended settings for Panasonic TC-P50G10 (use these settings when they are posted)\n\nIf you want the best possible picture available...my favorite 1080p displays are the new Pioneer 50\" KRP-500M and 60\" KRP-600M plasmas. These offer unmatched performance for the price; they provide excellent color accuracy, contrast, and black levels, along with the best video processing available in a consumer display. These are displays only; they do not have built-in speakers or stands; wall mounts and stands are sold separately and you'd need your own sound system. Ideal viewing distance would be 6-8' for the 50\" and 8-12' for the 60\".\n\nYou won't find the KRP-500M and KRP-600M displays at retail; they have to be ordered over the phone from vendors like Invision Displays, ValueEletronics, BestBuyPlasma, Coza, and Satellite & Sound, which would then ship the display directly from a Pioneer distributor. The 50\" 500M costs $1800-$2000 shipped and the stand or mount adds $50-$70. The 60\" 600M costs $2900-$3100 shipped and the appropriate wall mount adds $90-$100. Remember that these Pioneer models don't include built-in speakers, so you would need your own sound system.\n\nRecommended settings for Pioneer KRP-500M\n\nRecommended settings for Panasonic KRP-600M\n\nMessage Edited by KenAF on 04:46 AM\n\n@SLE wrote:\n\nI guess this is why I'm getting such horrible artifact/pixilation on my screen during fast moving scenes. I have a Panasonic plasma. Verizon says they are just passing along what they receive from their sources (ABC,CBS, HBO, etc). When I play the same scenes via DVD, it's clear as a bell without the problem.\n\nI find it very annoying and prevalent and not close to the \"crystal clear\" images that Verizon advertises.\n\nKeep in mind that the maximum true resolution for DVD is 720p, even if your DVD player outputs at 1080i or 1080p. That means there is considerably less detail in the original material than what is provided at 1080i by Verizon. Also, some of the channels (both broadcast and cable) only send their signal at 720p requirng the STB to upconvert to 1080i (all the Disney channels [ABC, ESPN, etc.] and most if not all FOX channels). If you have a QAM tuner in your set you can directly tune the local HD stations and they are only transmitted in 1080i. No one is broadcasting 1080p at this time and Verizon is one of the few providers that does pass through the signal as received (without further compression).\n\n@BigDaddyTees wrote:\n\nA couple of weeks ago, I purchased a 32 Inch Sony Bravia 720p but yet 1080p compatible HDTV. I know my TV is capable of receiving 1080p signals as most HDTV’s are in the modern era. However, Fios via the HD DVR only broadcast up to a 1080I signal. My question is this, is there anyway to get a 1080p signal from Fios or will 1080I have to be settled for? What I mean is under video options on the set top box the options are 480I, 480P, 720P and 1080I there is no 1080P option.\n\nWell to start with, which I didn't see anybody address yet, any source above 720p would be pointless on your TV anyway, by your description. 720P is the highest your panel can display. It will only down convert a 1080i/1080p signal to 720p resolution anyway. They word these descriptions in misleading ways on purpose to confuse buyers. But the short answer is, just set your box to 720p because your TV can't actually display anything higher. It might even be a better picture since your TV isn't down converting.\n\nFor your set it doesn't matter, but while there won't be direct broadcasts in 1080p for a long time, Verizon is close to offering 1080p On Demand content. Do a google search about it. It's already being tested with pricing and everything.\n\nHello, I'm coming in late to the discussion and as a new FiOS user, wanted to at least comment on my initial experience with my HD signal. I will compare my RCN HD service using their latest dual tuner Motorola box (looks very similar to my new FiOS box-some connector differences). I will also limit my findings to HD only.\n\nLet's take ABC's Lost for example. Believe it or not I still have RCN activated and have been A/B'ng the two signals/boxes for comparison. While the edge detail and chroma saturation are marginally but noticably better with FiOS, I have noticed lots of blurryness in lateral motion of subjects, to the point that I was starting to get a headache. I do not have this problem with the RCN signal. Eye fatigue is not a problem and the resolution and percevable bit rate appears to be close to that of the FiOS signal. Beard stuble, hair, skin pores.....are reproduced very well with either RCN or FiOS.\n\nCompression artifacts, macroblocking, banding,etc., all seem very similar between them too. It's the motion blurryness that is killing my anticipated love affair with FiOS.....before it's even had a chance to take off. If I can't find a affordable solution, I'll seriously consider re-signing with RCN at least for the TV/Cable part."
