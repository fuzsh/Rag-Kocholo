        "text": "What is the difference between HD (HD ready), FHD, UHD, 4K and QLED?\n\nThe main difference between an HD, FHD, UHD, or 4K television is that the 4K television will have a sharper picture than an HD television.\n\nHD\n\nHD or High Definition has a width of 1280 x 720 pixels (<1 megapixel). HD is also referred to as HD ready and 720p.\n\n> HD TV\n\nFull HD\n\nFull HD or FHD is the resolution currently found on most televisions, Blu-ray players, and video content. The image is 1920 pixels wide and 1080 pixels high (2.07 megapixels). Full HD is also referred to as 1080i and 1080p.\n\n> FHD\n\nUltra HD\n\nUltra HD also known as UHD is increasingly popular among televisions, media players and video content. The image resolution is 3840 x 2160 (8.3 megapixels). TVs with Ultra HD resolution display 4 times more pixels than Full HD images.\n\n> UHD\n\n4K\n\nThe term “4K” is often mistakenly used to refer to Ultra HD. In reality, 4K refers to a resolution of 4096 x 2160 pixels, which was originally used by the film industry. In practice, most “UHD/4K” televisions actually have a resolution of 3840 x 2160 pixels.\n\nQled\n\nQled TVs are equiped with quantum dot technology. This means that Qled TVs have an additional layer inside their screen composed of nano liquid crystals located between the backlighting and the screen. These crystals allow for a much more precise and efficient light emission.\n\nThis technology allows for better screen brightness which affects several components of image quality. The contrasts of images and videos are significantly improved thanks to this, which makes it possible to transmit sharper images with vibrant colors.\n\n> Qled F873 Tv series\n\nBetter resolution at the same image size\n\nA better resolution TV (eg UHD vs FHD) displays a greater number of pixels and allows more details to be displayed on an image of the same size. The materials, the textures, the skin texture of the actors, the backgrounds: everything is richer and more realistic.\n\nAt the same diagonal, the higher the definition, the higher the image quality and therefore the more precise and detailed the image. A 4K definition television has 4x more pixels than an HDTV to display the same scene on the same surface. At the same time, the resolution is multiplied by a factor of 2.\n\nA larger image at equal distance\n\nIt is the second advantage of switching to a higher definition image: if we increase the number of pixels in the image, we can therefore enjoy a larger image while maintaining the same distance between the screen and the viewers, without however distinguishing the pixels which compose it.\n\nFor example, you can switch without fear from a 32-inch (80 cm) 1080p HD television placed 2.5 m from viewers to a 65-inch (164 cm) UHD television, without having to move the sofa back. The image will be much larger and the immersion much better, but the pixels that make up the image will remain invisible to viewers at this distance.\n\nNote: In order to take full advantage of a 4K image, the entire signal transition chain must be capable of encoding, transmitting, receiving, decoding and displaying 4K. In other words, the camera used to record the film must be 4K, the signal transmission is in 4K, the reception (TNT, cable or SAT) can receive 4K, the cables (between box and TV for example) or 4K, the receiver decoding is 4K, the receiver panel is 4K.\n\nDiscover all our TV models :\n\n> HD TV\n\n> FHD\n\n> UHD"
