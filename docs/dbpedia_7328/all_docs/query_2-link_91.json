        "text": "You do not need a cable or satellite service in order to get High Definition Television. And itâs FREEâ¦ a fact that is not overly advertised.\n\nIt's truly amazing the advances in technology. You can watch amazing 1080i resolution broadcasts over the air for free and in fact, the quality is often better than the same channels received through a paid digital cable TV subscription. All you need is a high definition TV set with a built-in HDTV tuner and a HDTV antenna.\n\nof your local HD broadcast stations.\n\nAntennas\n\nFirst let's dispel a myth, there really isn't anything special about a HD antenna. Over-the-Air HDTV can be received by using an ordinary TV\n\nadd_alert IMPORTANT: The current rollout of the new ATSC 3.0 broascasting standard could impact service and should factor in your choice of antenna. Read More...\n\nWhere possible an outdoor antenna should be chosen over an indoor version. However, if you live an area that has good broadcast coverage, an indoor antenna is sufficient. The typical cost of a high quality outdoor directional antenna is around $50-$100. There are some developments that frown on the use of outdoor antennas, and go as far as to include it in the devlopment's deed restrictions. However, it pays to know your right. Per an FCC ruling, it is illegal to prohibit the use of an outdoor antenna.\n\nWinegard FL5500A\n\n(4K / ATSC 3.0 Ready)\n\nApproximately 90% of HDTV broadcasts are on the UHF band, and UHF antennas are a lot smaller VHF ones, so it may not be worth the hassle getting a VHF antenna, A point worth noting is that while combination VHF/UHF antennas are available, they are generally a compromise. You will be sacrificing function in both bands.\n\nFinally, when choosing an antenna another consideration in directionality. Choose a Directional antenna (one that focuses in a single direction) in remote areas where the signal is weak. If the signals are coming from multiple directions, the ideal solution is multiple antennas (yep, also unsightly), or an antenna rotator. In areas where the signal is strong an Omni-Directional antenna can be used.\n\nadd_alert Use this tool to check the signal strength in your area.\n\nPretty Cool! Over-the-Air DVR\n\nThe Amazon Fire TV Recast is a DVR that lets you watch and record over-the-air TV with no monthly fees. Watch and record live televison from channels available through an HD antenna. It has 2 tuners that allows you to record up to 2 shows at once. Plus, up to 75 hours of HD programming. Fire TV Recast delivers the most reliable video streams over Wi-Fi of any over-the-air DVR. Fire TV Recast, over-the-air DVR, 1 TB, 150 hours\n\nCEA Zones Help You Decide Antenna\n\nThe Consumer Electronics Association (CEA) has adopted a color coding scheme for classifying regions with different TV reception conditions. These colors can help you decide the type of antenna. Look for the CTA-certified antenna mark on outdoor antennas, based on the colors of the stations you want to receive.\n\nYellow - Best reception, requires small omni-directional antenna\n\nGreen - Slightly weaker signal, medium omni-directional antenna\n\nLight Green - Amplified rooftop mounted. Large omni-directional antenna\n\nRed - Areas of high reflectivity. Medium directional antenna\n\nBlue - Weak signals or ghosting caused by nearby structures. Medium directional with pre-amplifier\n\nViolet - Weak signals. Large directional antenna, high rooftop installation, professional installation recommended.\n\nPink - Even higher rooftop installation. Large directional antenna with power pre-amplifier, professional installation recommended."
