        "text": "this has been asked a few times and in the end it will depend on your own eyes, some can see a difference between 720p and 108i etc but as it takes seconds to switch my eys have forgotten by the time each new resolution comes up.\n\nTo set it to automatic depends on the display you are using ie is it full hd or hd ready. Hd ready means the panel will scale any resolution you send it to fit. Ful HD will take 1080i with no need for scaling. So if you have a FULL HD panel then put settings at 1080i, this means an SD image will be scaled by the sky box and may make picture better.\n\nFor hd ready set it to automatic and let the panel do all the scaling.\n\nIn the end you yourself will settle on the best set up, ie your eyes will tell you.\n\ngb--\n\n0\n\nIt depends on your personal preference, and what set you have - generally 1080i is probably 'best' for most users.\n\nWhy would you suggest its best for the Sky box to do the upscaling when you usually claim its a con and its best to leave tv's to it by using \"auto\"?\n\nBut as others have already said - try the obvious.\n\nSet it on both and see which you prefer\n\nNote that when set to 1080i the Sky box will not auto switch to the correct ratio for 4:3 material\n\n0\n\nCould someone please advise me which is the best setting Automatic or 1080i in the HD Resolution settings.\n\nthanks in advance\n\nHi, first time poster, long time observer.... from behind a curtain.\n\nI personally can not tell the difference between the two.. maybe my TV is not up to spec ?. My last \"medical\" report says my sight is 20:20 though?.\n\nWhen I set my box to automatic my TV seems to think about what it wants to do for a second before showing me a picture. It is slightly annoying when flicking through channels, so I tend to have it set to or 720 for most things except sport. If only Q was still alive... could've kitted me out with full hd tv. Shame.\n\n0\n\nYes connected by HDMI the tv only has one HDMI connector so I use a Belkin three way switch box to connect my three HDMI devices. I have tried both settings as suggested and really can't see any difference between them!\n\nLucky you.\n\nIf thats the case then you can choose between watching 4:3 in its correct ratio without manually adjusting the tv or you can tolerate the small glitch onscreen when the box changes from one format to another\n\nYou decide\n\nJust one thing: have you connected the box direct to your tv rather than via the switch box to make sure that you really are getting the quality?\n\nIts not unknown for switchboxes to not work 100%\n\n0\n\nJust my 2 pennies worth\n\nBut i have a samsung 52\" full HD tv and i find that 720p gives a better picture than 1080i, might be my eyes but this is especially true with SD content viewed via hdmi input.\n\nthere is nothing right or wrong with this, it's just my opinion.\n\n0\n\nI always had it on 'Auto' when I had a Thomson box and at first when I got a Pace box installed instead. But more and more it seems the only non-widescreen stuff being watched in this house is the kids TV, so I've not put it into 1080i. As much as I hate stretchyvision, I can make do with Peppa Pig being shown in the wrong format.\n\n0"
