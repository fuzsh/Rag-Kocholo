        "text": "For the first time in its 27 years, USA Network unveiled a comprehensive new branding initiative, leaving behind the American flag imagery that channel president Bonnie Hammer says is no longer a good fit with the more distinctive, character-driven brand identity the network is seeking to build.\n\nIn announcing the new brand, Hammer said: “When we started developing a brand strategy we knew we wanted it to be enhancing rather than limiting. We didn’t want to tack on a meaningless tagline or claim an arbitrary niche or demo. I believe we’ve succeeded in developing a campaign that’s organic to USA, something that captures and communicates what the network is about, what lives and breathes on its air.”\n\nThe new logo features a while stylized font for USA Network over a Tiffany blue background. The network’s new tag line is ‘Characters Welcome.’ Stressing that USA Network is about people, Hammer added that the new logo and tagline underscores the network’s programming and the strength of the characters that inhabit that programming, as well as the people who comprise the USA Network audience.\n\nTimed to coincide with the fourth season premiere of Monk on July 8, USA Network will begin airing new promo spots emphasizing the network’s signature characters, including the obsessive-compulsive detective Monk portrayed by Tony Shalhoub and Anthony Michael Hall’s portrayal of the reluctant psychic on The Dead Zone.\n\nOther spots in the campaign turn the cameras around to spotlight the quirky characteristics of typical USA viewers. USA’s web site will also be refreshed with the new brand messaging, allowing viewers to upload digital content onto an interactive map of the US."
