        "text": "What is the difference between HDTV and SDTV?\n\nHDTV and standard-definition television (SDTV) are the two categories of display formats for digital television (DTV) transmission, which is the prevalent standard today. HDTV provides a higher-quality display with a vertical resolution display from 720p to 1080i. The p stands for progressive scanning, which means that each scan includes every line for a complete picture, and the i stands for interlaced scanning, which means that each scan includes alternate lines for half a picture. This translates into a frame rate of up to 60 frames per second, twice that of conventional television."
