        "text": "Only time interlacing is dictated is for broadcast.\n\nAnd I should render single frame for computer presentation.\n\nNot necessarily but generally. If your source is already interlaced, ie video file and you’re just editing without many effects or compositing and you are going to DVD then it’s possible to stay interlaced. DVD can and is commonly interlaced and media player software on a PC will generally handle interlaced by deinterlacing. But deinterlacing will generally mean loosing half your vertical resolution.\n\nNow HD camera’s (ex 3 for example) are shooting progressive (am I right on that one?). Firstly why is the image clear on a TV screen if its progressive rather than interlaced?\n\nMany newer cams shoot true progressive, (as well as interlaced) some shoot pfs which is interlaced but the two segments are frames with no time difference.\n\nYou need to make sure your editting software knows what it is it’s dealing with and also with regard to interlaced the field order. Things will go wrong with editing, effects and playback otherwise.\n\nAnd if there are things like colour space conversion going on in your NLE from YCrCb/YV12 to RGB it’s important that the software knows it’s interlaced. Otherwise you’ll be loosing quality in the conversion, it’s a lossy conversion already.\n\nAnd second, if I want to mix live action with animation, should I render my HD 3D footage progressive rather than interlaced? Can anyone clear this up for me?\n\nDepends on purpose, if you want to undercrank or overcrank and your vid cam doesn’t offer that in cam then shooting a section of your video interlaced and then deinterlacing and slowing the video down is far smoother and cleaner than just applying a slow down on progressive.\n\nProgressive for everything else. If you intend using blender for this editing. Nodes doesn’t handle interlaced very well I believe, blender is designed for progressive editing. The VSE is more standalone and can handle interlaced I think.\n\nSounds like you have the option to go Progressive the whole way. If so I’d just do that.\n\nBasically progressive scan has a more, well, “film-like” look if you will. That was originally what all of the hype was about 10 years ago or so - gee, has it been that long? That was about when it started to hit the market more broadly in cameras, though I am sure it had been around a lot longer.\n\nOne of the main advantages of 24p is you can take film footage and transfer it over and remain more true to a projected look. That is because each frame is scanned once (similar to a camera and projector) rather than two times (interlaced).\n\nThe interlaced look is what has been associated with TV footage. A more “video - like” look.\n\nPersonally, I have always been able to tell the difference between the two even when shown on an NTSC interlaced monitor. I have also had the great opportunity to see the film I shot (that we edited in Progressive) projected at the Archlight Cinerama dome. The consensus was that we had transferred to film, when in fact it was just a very good video projector projecting the progressive tape in Progressive on the screen.\n\nAs noted above there are some technical issues to consider. However for the most part, I think you’ll like the end result better if you shoot in 1080p and then render in progressive.\n\nJust make sure in Premier, to see to it that each clip is set to Progressive, (not sure how Premier does this, just check them to make sure is all I am saying) and the project is also set to Progressive. And when you render out any composites or final edits from Premier you select Progressive. Same would be true I expect with AE. Sorry I use Vegas. But the basic idea is still true. Make sure all your settings are progressive as you go down the pipeline - including the MPeg files you render for the DVD output.\n\nIf you change your mind later you can always convert clips to interlace. NLEs are pretty good with this stuff these days, so there should not be any problems.\n\nAs a technical note: I had done quite a bit of experiments before shooting. And in the end I shot in interlaced but when I did the editing, I converted the clips to Progressive. But that was an old camera. These days you can just shoot progressive with most real nice cameras that have true progressive. But it is a good idea to do tests before you get to the set and see what works best in your situation.\n\nThe bottom line is you always have options to convert in post. You should shoot based on what looks best or works best in tests you do beforehand.\n\nWhat you really need to do first is check what the actual broadcast delivery requirements are in the target area of distribution. In different parts of the world this is likely to be different.\n\nwiki:\n\nHDTV broadcast systems are identified with three major parameters:\n\nFrame size in pixels is defined as number of horizontal pixels × number of vertical pixels, for example 1280 × 720 or 1920 × 1080. Often the number of horizontal pixels is implied from context and is omitted.\n\nScanning system is identified with the letter P for progressive scanning or I for interlaced scanning.\n\nFrame rate is identified as number of video frames per second. For interlaced systems an alternative form of specifying number of fields per second is often used.\n\nI am pretty sure that how this is implemented is different in various parts of the world. And some places don’t even have HD yet. And some may support p and some only i.\n\nSo if you don’t know already or the client does not know, Google it or call a broadcaster in your area for a link to a website.\n\nI would get that settled first. I have not kept up with it lately and I can’t seem to find links now that tell exactly what the current formats are.\n\nJust know that there is a difference between broadcast standard and what part of this is actually adopted in a particular region/network etc.\n\nAs an example from NBC website FAQ:\n\nAren’t there two different HDTV formats (720p and the 1080i)? Which will a new HDTV receive?\n\nThe Digital Television (DTV) standard allows broadcasters to choose among several different formats that they can transmit. There are two high definition formats: 720p and 1080i. NBC broadcasts HDTV in the 1080i format, which provides the highest possible resolution to our audience. But you don’t have to worry - any HDTV receiver will receive both formats."
