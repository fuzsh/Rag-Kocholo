        "text": "How to check if your TV has a QAM Digital TV Tuner?\n\nYOUR TV MUST SUPPORT A COAX CONNECTION AND A CLEAR QAM DIGITAL TV TUNER.\n\nMost major brand flat screen TVs manufactured after 2006 support both ATSC (Advanced Television Systems Committee) and QAM (quadrature amplitude modulation) digital tuners. ATSC is used to receive digital channels over the air. QAM is used to receive digital channels from a cabe TV provider without use of a cable box. Your TV must support QAM to function on the Comcast provided ResNet HD Cable TV system.\n\nBefore you follow the instructions below, be sure you followed the configure and set-up instructions and carefully consulted your TV's user manual. Manuals can be found on the manufacturer's web site or by searching Google for the TV model number and manufacturer's name.\n\nThe best way to check if your digital TV's tuner is clear QAM capable, is to connect your TV and use your remote control to manually tune to a few digital channels. BFor example, enter \"9\" \"-\" \"1\" (nine, dash, one) and press \"enter\" if necessary. If you don't see a picture (i.e. WCAU NBC10), try a few more channels like. \"6-1\" for WPVI 6ABC and \"3-1\" for KYW CBS3. If you can't tune any channels, your TV may not include a QAM digital tuner.\n\nYou can also search Google with the manufacturer's name and exact model number to find your TV's manual or specifications. If the documentation includes the terms \"QAM\". \"Clear QAM\" or \"QAM capable\", your TV tuner should be compatible with the ResNet HD Cable TV system. However, many manufacturer's (including well known top brands) who support QAM tuners (like Samsung) often don't include any reference to their \"QAM\" support. Unfortunately this means absence of the \"QAM\" reference in the manufacturer's documentation doesn't always mean your TV is not supported. That's why it's often necessary to perform the check above.\n\nFinally you should consult the TV Compatibility listing for further assistance. If your manufacturer's name isn't listed in the green table and after following the instructions above you are unable to view a picture, it is highly likely your TV is unsupported. As a last resort you can try to replace the cable between your TV and the wall, or try your TV in a different wall jack (every suite has two or more jacks) just to rule out a cabling problem."
