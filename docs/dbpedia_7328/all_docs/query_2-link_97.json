        "text": "Works fine in 1080i but everytime I try to use 720p with the television studio all I get is a black screen, is there something I’m doing wrong?\n\nHere’s my info:\n\nI use a Mac Mini with the ATEM Television studio and Intensity Extreme. For camera I use a Panasonic GH2 (a DSLR camera) with the HDMI to SDI Mini Converter. When I want to use 720p I change the camera setting to 720p and change the settings in the ATEM Software control panel to 720p. When I do this I get a black screen but when I change both of the setting back to 1080i I get a picture again.\n\nIs there some step I’m missing or something I’m doing wrong? Would really appreciate anyone’s help one this!"
