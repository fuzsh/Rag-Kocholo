How can I render at 1080i 50 to integrate with the black-magic ATEM TVS.\n\nSo if anyone can give me step by step instructions, that would be great.\n\nThank you.\n\nA News Graphic Lover\n\n[John Mark] “When exporting, I can only see the option to render at 1080p, 720p. How can I render at 1080i 50 to integrate with the black-magic ATEM TVS.”\n\nHow are you exporting? There are a couple ways…\n\nWork in a 1920×1080 25fps comp. To render, add the comp to the render queue (Ctrl+Shift+/ on Windows, Cmd+Shift+/ on Mac). In the render queue, look at the yellow text next to the words “Render Settings.” By default, it will say “Best Settings.” Click this, then change “Time Sampling > Field Render” from “Off” to “Upper field first.”\n\nWalter Soyka\n\nPrincipal & Designer at Keen Live\n\nMotion Graphics, Widescreen Events, Presentation Design, and Consulting\n\nRenderBreak Blog – What I’m thinking when my workstation’s thinking\n\nCreative Cow Forum Host: Live & Stage Events\n\nTed, don’t let me stop you! I gave the “old school” render queue approach — I assumed when you asked what version he was using that you were going to propose a different technique via Adobe Media Encoder?\n\nIt wouldn’t be After Effects if there were only one way to do it…\n\nWalter Soyka\n\nPrincipal & Designer at Keen Live\n\nMotion Graphics, Widescreen Events, Presentation Design, and Consulting\n\nRenderBreak Blog – What I’m thinking when my workstation’s thinking\n\nCreative Cow Forum Host: Live & Stage Events\n\n[John Mark] “Using 25fps really eliminates that smooth look I’m after. Is there anyway I can make the graphic produce a much smoother motion in after effects still using 25fps? Not sure if this is possible.”\n\nFrame rate is “temporal resolution.” The higher the frame rate, the smoother the motion.\n\nDo you have any video sources in your comp? How are you monitoring your output? The 25 fps comp will be a bit stuttery, but the 1080i50 render with fields on should be silky smooth (since it is refreshing 50 times per second, not 25).\n\nYou can get a sense of what this will look like by working in a 50 fps comp — just make sure you render at 25 fps with fields on for output.\n\nWalter Soyka\n\nPrincipal & Designer at Keen Live\n\nMotion Graphics, Widescreen Events, Presentation Design, and Consulting\n\nRenderBreak Blog – What I’m thinking when my workstation’s thinking\n\nCreative Cow Forum Host: Live & Stage Events\n\n[Walter Soyka] “You can get a sense of what this will look like by working in a 50 fps comp — just make sure you render at 25 fps with fields on for output.\n\n“\n\nSo basically I work in a comp running at these settings; 1080 by 1920 50 frames per second. The render at 25 frames per second in “Best settings” > “Upper fields” > then change from 50 to 25 frames per seconds. All these in the “render queue”\n\nPlease, correct me if I’m wrong.\n\nThank you Walter.\n\nA News Graphic Lover\n\n[Dave LaRonde] “It would really help people if we knew what you need to DELIVER. How your completed work will be used. How it will be played back. Where it will appear. The file specifications you received to do the job.\n\n“\n\nOk Dave, the graphics are being made for tv segments or shows. The graphics overlay on top of a video signal to indicate what show is on and what show is coming on. I will be also producing simple tickers all made using After Effects CS6.\n\nOn final output I will be using Softron New Smart Play-out engine: https://www.softron.tv/products/smartplayoutengine.html – Output will be using a UltraStudio Mini Monitor set at 1080i50.\n\nThis is what graphic I’ll be using: https://reels.creativecow.net/film/graphic-at-1280-by-720-60fps – The graphic is set at a comp of 1280 by 720 running at 60fps (at the moment, just to show what smoothness I’m looking for).\n\nIf I have left anything out Dave, please let me know.\n\nA News Graphic Lover"
