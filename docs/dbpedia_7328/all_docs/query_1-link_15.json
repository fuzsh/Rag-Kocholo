        "text": "In a boon to media aesthetes, NBCUniversal has confirmed it will deliver 4K HDR coverage of the Paris Olympics on USA Network.\n\nCoverage using 4K HDR and Dolby Atmos audio technology will run on a 24/7 basis from the morning of July 24 through the evening of August 11.\n\nIt is generally agreed upon in audiophile/cineophile circles that 4K HDR is the highest-resolution signal that can be put out, offering a wider contrast and a richer range of color. Dolby Atmos is known for a fully immersive overhead surround-sound experience, at least on certain platforms. While a host of programmers, networks and distributors have touted the technology, the amount of programming available in the format remains a minority, largely for financial reasons. A cottage industry has sprung up online around intel about 4K broadcasts, especially in sports.\n\nNBCU’s streaming flagship, Peacock – the main destination for the Games – will not feature any programming in 4K, a person familiar with the programming plans told Deadline.\n\nIn order to see the presentation in full 4K HDR and Dolby Atmos, viewers must have a TV and set-top box that supports 4K. They also muyst be tuned in on one of the following distributors: Altice, Comcast, Cox, DirecTV/DirecTV Stream, Dish, Fubo, Verizon, YouTube TV. Select members of the NCTC consortium of independent cable operators will also offer the telecasts.\n\nWhile past Olympics have aired on USA and other NBCU platforms, this year the cable net plans to carry 400 hours of programming, a new record."
