        "text": "USA celebrates larger-than-life characters—both fans and talent alike—by offering a massive range of original series, reality juggernauts, and beloved movies.\n\nTo propel the brand into a new era of growth, we designed an elastic visual identity with an audacious voice that engages its fans in exciting new ways. Working in close collaboration with leadership and designers at USA, we developed a design system that refreshes and differentiates the network to build a big stage for their characters—a place where being a little extra isn’t only welcome, it’s encouraged.\n\nA punchy new color palette, playfully expressive type, and powerfully hardworking wayfinding are the heart of a new identity system. We redesigned each element to be emblematic of USA’s brand spirit—full of life, proudly big, and broad with a point. Every moment becomes an opportunity to highlight and frame characters’ raw authenticity as they show us who they really are.\n\nWhile being deeply strategic, we also built fun directly into the system. For example, the new palette is named after things you might find at a barbecue—Ketchup, Mustard, Mayo, Charcoal, and Denim. When promoting USA’s slate of original series, each with its own distinct branding, the palette easily flexes to be even broader.\n\nWhat fans love about USA is its broad variety of iconic programming that spans genres, moods, and tones. We engineered the system of the original IP programming so it can be tailored to bring out the personality of each individual show—while keeping a few consistent USA brand elements to unite the promos together.\n\nCustomizing each original promo package begins with a key color selection that works as an accent across lower thirds, endpage, character sting, logo, and tagline. Custom font and image selection round this out to create a truly unique promo package that captures the show’s essence but follows USA’s visual DNA for a consistent on-screen experience."
