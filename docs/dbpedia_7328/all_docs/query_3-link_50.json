        "text": "HDTV & FORMATS\n\nDigital Television:\n\nDigital Television (DTV) is scheduled to replace all existing terrestrial analog NTSC television transmissions in the U.S. by the year 2006. This doesn't necessarily affect home video formats, direct satellite transmission or cable television but the range of services and potential improvement in image quality will probably drive those industries as well. Several simultaneous Standard Definition Television (SDTV) image streams or a single High Definition Television (HDTV) image will make up the television programming broadcasts. SDTV is considered roughly the same quality level as today's television broadcasts and HDTV relates to a number of higher definition video standards. In any case, a television image in SDTV or HDTV will be transmitted in 16:9 aspect ratio. Both of these broad television formats are considered to be \"ATV\".\n\nAdvanced Television Standards:\n\nIn fact, there are 18 different television standards that may be broadcast under the name \"Advanced Television\". This may seem like a lot of different standards but the ability to taylor a digital signal to a task specific function could lead to many more \"standards\". The ATSC has constrained the list of possibilities to only 18.\n\n\"Table 3\" describing ATV television standards.\n\nPart of the ATSC \"A/53\" Specification\n\nYou may be able to count more or less of them depending on how deep you get on permutations (and we will resist describing all of them) but it seems there will be only a few standards in general use. The standards are named with the number of scan lines and one of two scanning types; interlaced or progressive.\n\nA \"480i\" standard means the television screen contains 480 usable scan lines with interlaced scanning, roughly the equivalent of our current NTSC broadcast standard. Horizontally, there are 704 active picture elements (pixels) on each line for 16:9 images. The \"1080i\" standard has 1080 displayable lines and 1920 pixels across the screen. The \"i\" with these numbers stands for \"interlace\" which describes a television frame that is broken into two \"fields\", transmitted sequentially and reassembled as a complete frame at the home receiver. This is the principle of current NTSC television and will be continued into the DTV world.\n\nThe antonym of interlace is \"progressive\" where the entire frame is transmitted as one element. Using progressive scanning dramatically increases the apparent resolution of an image but has other penalties in bandwidth requirements and receiver manufacturing costs. There are heated arguments over which scanning format to choose for broadcast. Each network and service provider faced with this decision believe they have the right answer. As conventional wisdom changes like the wind, other scanning formats will rise and fall in popularity as technology progresses. Fortunately, the receiver manufacturers belonging to the Consumer Electronics Manufacturer's Association (CEMA) will build DTV receivers that will decode and display all 18 broadcast standards.\n\nDigital Television Services:\n\nThe DTV transmission is a digital broadcast service that is not necessarily an exclusive television programming channel as we know it. A single DTV channel may include a variety of data services sharing the channel space. The broadcaster's selection of a pixel count and scan type affects the picture quality reaching the home and the amount of broadcast real estate needed to get it there. They have the ability to sell data services over the same channel shared by television images. The issue of picture quality boils down to the digital data rates reserved for the television image.\n\nThis thinking is certainly on the minds of many broadcasters as they work out the financial models in their DTV future. It is possible to \"bit starve\" the television image in favor of data payload on the DTV channel thus trading image quality to make room for other paying services. It is also possible to increase the quality of the television image beyond the intended \"Table 3\" constraints. By using some proposed data tricks, one network has spoken of broadcasting sporting events at 90 frames per second at HDTV resolution. Time and funding will tell if that noble effort will succeed.\n\nThe earliest over the air DTV broadcasts will simply be standard definition television connected to a DTV encoder carrying existing programming. These broadcasts will be the \"480i\" variety. Broadcasters will gradually begin integrating a library of programming intended for future DTV transmission. First, 16:9 aspect programming with standard resolution is the easiest thing to accomplish. In the future, higher resolution images will become more commonplace as the older programs and production equipment are retired.\n\nThe production standard used is not necessarily the same as the broadcast standard. Of primary concern to producers is the quality of the original material and it's future value. Broadcasters will be converting images from their native production format to fit into their broadcast chain. Regardless of the original image quality (pixel count), the common denominator in all produced material will be the image aspect ratio.\n\nAspect Ratio: The current NTSC broadcasts are in 4:3 aspect ratio. This means that no matter what the screen size is, the image will measure 4 units wide and 3 units tall. The primary feature of the ATV formats is a 16:9 picture aspect ratio, which comes out to be about 20% wider than a 4:3 image of equal height. Independent of the aspect ratio is the number of scan lines available on the screen and the number of pixels available across the width of the screen. The higher the line and pixel count, the better the potential resolution of the image.\n\nOne of the available realities in the ATV world is the need to incorporate images from current tape libraries. The largest change for ATV and biggest hurdle to using existing material is the issue of image aspect ratio. Current video libraries are all 4:3 aspect ratio and must be converted to fit in a 16:9 world, whether it is HDTV or SDTV. Essentially, all available 4:3 aspect program material has become obsolete. The producer must decide to either blow up the picture so the original image sides fill the screen, or allow black side panels on the 16:9 screen thus keeping the original aspect ratio of the source image.\n\nThe penalty for blowing up the picture is that the top and/or bottom of the screen will be removed creating a framing problem. Things normally in the frame may get cut off, or a medium shot of a person's face becomes a close-up, each changing the meaning of the image. In addition to the framing problems, a blowup from a video original degrades the image quality with visible artifacts. The producer must make compromises when reframing each scene during the blowup process.\n\nA producer with film elements available, especially widescreen film, will have the advantage of re-transferring the image elements and reassembling an ATV compatible product, possibly reusing the entire audio track. Film shot in 4:3 ratio will present the same difficulty while deciding where to reframe the image, but degradations caused by refaming are quite minimal when done at the telecine transfer step compared to a similar action using video as the source. Standard definition video material finished in 16:9 format may be applied directly as an SDTV product.\n\nMajor manufacturers of professional video camera equipment such as Sony, Panasonic, Ikegami, Philips and others offer standard resolution NTSC cameras capable of switching between the current 4:3 aspect and the 16:9 widescreen ATV aspect. These cameras will allow producers to create video images in the correct aspect ratio for ATV product, making it easier to reversion video originated material for future broadcast. The DTV standard does not define the image resolution required for broadcast of an ATV image allowing both standard and high resolution images. The producer should consider the alternatives presented with the various film and video formats when thinking of immediate, short term program delivery and future-proofing program material.\n\nScanning Systems: The number of scanning lines available on the video picture become the limiting factor for vertical resolution. More scan lines in the television system generally translate to higher vertical resolution. The issue of interlaced scan versus progressive scan also comes into play when judging picture quality. A progressive scan picture with only 720 scan lines (\"720p\") has nearly the same apparent vertical resolution as 1080 lines with interlaced scanning (\"1080i\"). The interlaced scan method is a form of compression that degrades the picture slightly.\n\nThe current NTSC analog television scanning system is nearly identical to the 480i ATV standard. With the same number of scan lines delivered to the home as 480p (progressive), the home viewer will perceive a much higher resolution image. If television programming is created in a progressive scan standard and delivered to the home in that manner, many of the artifacts attributed to interlace will disappear.\n\nThe expense of manufacturing a large tube-type progressive scan display system is high compared to interlaced displays. It is more likely that the home receiver will have an interlaced display and the progressive scan material will be converted to interlace at the home receiver. Film is well suited to a progressive scan delivery system. Hopefully, the technical and economic hurdles will be overcome so we may actually see it in the home.\n\nLarge screen flat panel displays are coming to market that will allow a progressive scan image to be displayed correctly. An image that was created as an interlaced product will carry the artifacts of interlacing to any progressive scan display. You can successfully make an interlaced image from a progressive image but the reverse is not true.\n\nImage Quality Considerations:\n\nVideo cameras have gotten very good in the areas of resolution, dynamic range, sensitivity and noise. Film stocks have steadily improved over time as well. We must consider these areas when talking about picture quality in any format.\n\nImage Resolution:\n\nThe subject of image resolution, or sharpness, will be the real key to future-proofing. Please forgive me as I tech-out for a moment here. The measurement of horizontal resolution in an image is the maximum number of black and white vertical bars that can be visually resolved within the horizontal dimension equal to the picture height. In other words, no matter what the picture size or aspect ratio is, you carve out a square on the screen (where width equals height) and count how many black and white vertical bars you can cram into that area and still see them. This is true for film or video and is expressed as \"TVL/PH\", or \"TV Lines per Picture Height\". The vertical bars are considered vertical \"lines\" which are not to be confused with the fixed number of active scan lines available on the television screen.\n\nThe resolution measurement for a camera involves shooting a test chart with a series of patches containing measured vertical black and white bars of different packing densities. To measure resolution of a video camera, a video waveform monitor will directly display the ability to resolve each vertical line in the patches. For film, a microdensitometer, essentially a microscope with a light meter, is used to examine the image of the black and white bar patches and determine how well the film can separate them. With each test patch that has bars closer together, the cameras have a harder time resolving the individual bars and tend to progressively blur them together until they turn a flat gray at the extreme upper limit of resolving power.\n\nExample of resolution test chart.\n\nMeasuring how much the black and white bars blend together is expressed as a percentage of what they were originally, namely 100% black and 100% white. A 100% response indicates that nothing was lost in the camera. It's possible to have a measurement of over 100% after gamma and aperture correction, but we'll discard that discussion for now. An 80% response on a higher resolution patch is considered very good, showing only mild degradation. Once you get a high enough packing density of black and white bars and the residual falls into the 20% range, you can start to write off the existence of any significant resolution elements.\n\nA test like this will show that Super16mm film can resolve fewer vertical lines than some current standard resolution video cameras. A present day NTSC video camera can resolve upwards of 750 vertical lines whereas Super16mm film has lost half of its resolution powers at around 500 lines. These numbers represent what is available in the camera and does not take into account what happens to the signal when processed further in a video system.\n\nOnce either of these images are converted to a digital video recording at 4:3 (standard television) aspect ratio, the resolution is limited to 567 TVL/PH on a D2 machine and 535 TVL/PH on a D1 or Digital Betacam machine. The limits occur due to the available pixel count per line of the digital television system in use.\n\nIf a 4:3 video image is stretched horizontally about 20% to a 16:9 aspect ratio, whether film or video originated, the horizontal resolution of a D1 or Digital Betacam image is reduced to 402 TVL/PH. There will be fewer pixels available inside your square resolution test area because they've been pulled horizontally to make the screen wider. Even so, the video camera, which started with more resolution, has a measurable sharpness advantage over Super16mm film. Based on this, a high quality standard definition video camera will have a measurable resolution advantage over Super16mm film in the DTV world.\n\nNoise:\n\nKodak has converted the measurement of film granularity to the equivalent of video noise. They calculated that Kodak EXR5254 film in a Super35mm format, a size used for 16:9 production, has a 50db signal to noise ratio. Signal to noise in television is a measurement of how much the picture content overpowers background noise. A number of 50db means that the noise or grain pattern is .01% of the picture content. Every increment of 10db is a multiplication factor of 10, so a 60db ratio is one-tenth the noise of 50db and 40db is ten times the noise of 50db. A higher number is better. The Sony HDC-500 HDTV video camera measures at a 54db signal to noise ratio, slightly better than the Super35mm film stock. Comparing that to Super16mm with only 42db and 16mm at 40db, the Super16mm and 16mm film doesn't compare favorably. By these tests, Super16mm film has more than ten times the noise of a present day HDTV camera.\n\nDynamic Range:\n\nFilm is acknowledged to have a minimum dynamic range of about 8 or 9 stops. That is the lighting difference between the brightest and darkest object in a scene without overexposing the image and without losing detail to noise or film grain. Jeff Cree, Sony's guru on video cameras, demonstrated how a Sony DVW-700 video camera can make a remarkable picture on a table-top scene with 11 stops difference between lightest and darkest objects. A properly exposed video camera, without any clipped elements in the picture, can reasonably be expected to approach the exposure quality of a film originated image.\n\nSensitivity:\n\nFilm is no doubt the most flexible format for working in varying lighting conditions. The exposure index of a video camera cannot be adjusted like a film camera and extremely sensitive film stocks can make excellent exposures with candle light. There is no such thing as \"fast\" video tape. However, some video cameras have signal to noise ratios in the 60 to 65db area which allow for additional video \"gain\" to be added without dragging up the noise in the blacks. With these cameras, reasonably good pictures can be made in extremely low light situations that will rival most standard film stocks.\n\nStandard Definition Television:\n\nThe current component digital standard, considered the top of the heap today, is ironically the lowest acceptable image quality in the realm of ATV. An official CBS Engineering document written by Henry Mahler concluded that the lowest quality image available in our current television standard is a component digital recording at 16:9 aspect ratio. It was rated lower than even composite digital (D2) images in his report. The 16:9 SDTV images we can make today will match the quality of SDTV transmissions on a DTV channel and can be included in a product intended for HDTV distribution if necessary.\n\nHigh Definition Television:\n\nThe term \"High Definition Television\" is considered anything that is better than what we get today. Any scan line count greater than 480 is generally considered \"High Definition\". Even 480 lines transmitted as progressive scan is considered a \"High Definition\" image. The top of the heap would be the 1080 line HDTV standard which several broadcasters have elected to support.\n\nThe 1080 HDTV standard will point out some of the inherent shortcomings of Super16mm film. Joe Flaherty, Senior Vice President of CBS, gave a speech in 1997 where he spoke of his \"concern about the long term asset value of Super16mm material as HDTV product because of Super16mm's low performance\". He also showed several objective tests that compared the various film and video formats with compelling results. For example, resolving an image that demands 600 TVL/PH showed that an HDTV video camera can attain an 80% response, 35mm film has a 73% response, Super16mm has a 36% response and regular 16mm film only has a 23% response. Looking at the visual comparison of an HDTV camera and 35mm film transfer to HDTV shows little difference between them. Looking at Super16mm is a stark contrast to the 35mm film and HDTV video camera. Mr. Flaherty concluded that Super16mm film is not acceptable if the final destination is intended to be an HDTV standard, and therefore could not be considered a future-proof imaging format.\n\nTo be fair, the tests performed by CBS were met by the film community with howls of disapproval. Accusations were made about creating results born of vested interest against Super16mm film. It has essentially brought on a minor war between several interested parties. We've seen some very good looking Super16mm film and can hardly complain about the quality or apologize for the lack of resolution. However, the material shown by Mr. Flaherty was presented in a scientific, factual manner without an overt bias to any format. In fact, care was taken not to treat any format more favorably than another. For instance, a telecine colorist would normally crank in almost twice the noise reduction and image enhancement into a Super16mm film transfer than a 35mm film. This correction was apparently not done in these tests. Handling the Super16mm in the same way as the 35mm simply pointed out some differences between them.\n\nIt has been suggested that an even more objective test would have been to show projected film against the telecine transfer to prove or disprove the telecine's ability to handle Super16mm film. In any case, it is generally acknowledged in the film production community that 35mm film has a distinct advantage over Super16mm in all aspects except cost.\n\nThe following drawing is an indication of the difference between the area of a 35mm film frame and a Super16mm film frame:"
