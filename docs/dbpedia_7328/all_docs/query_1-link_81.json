        "text": "iCloud Photos works with the Photos app to keep your photos and videos securely stored in iCloud, and up to date on your iPhone, iPad, Apple Vision Pro, Mac, Apple TV, and iCloud.com.\n\nHow iCloud Photos works\n\nTurn on iCloud Photos\n\nWhat happens when you edit or delete photos\n\nDownload copies of your photos and videos\n\nMake sure that you have enough storage\n\nHow iCloud Photos works\n\niCloud Photos automatically keeps every photo and video you take in iCloud, so you can access your library from any device, anytime you want. Any changes you make to your collection on one device change on your other devices too. Your photos and videos are organized into Years, Months, Days, and All Photos. And all of your Memories and People & Pets are updated everywhere. That way you can quickly find the moment, family member, or friend you're looking for.\n\nTurn on iCloud Photos\n\nMake sure that you set up iCloud and sign in to iCloud with the same Apple ID on all of your devices.\n\nOn your iPhone, iPad, or Apple Vision Pro\n\nGo to Settings > [your name].\n\nTap iCloud.\n\nTap Photos, then tap the switch next to Sync this [device].\n\nOn your Mac\n\nChoose Apple menu  > System Settings or choose Apple menu  > System Preferences.\n\nClick Apple ID.\n\nClick iCloud in the sidebar, then select Photos.\n\nClick the switch next to Sync this Mac.\n\nOn Apple TV 4K and Apple TV HD\n\nGo to Settings > Users and Accounts.\n\nSelect iCloud.\n\nTurn on iCloud Photos.\n\nOn your Windows PC\n\nLearn how to set up and use iCloud Photos on your PC\n\nWhat happens when you edit or delete photos\n\nWhen you edit or delete photos or videos, the changes are reflected across all of your devices.\n\nEdits show up on all of your devices\n\nWhen you make edits in the Photos app on your iPhone or iPad or on your Mac, the photo automatically updates across all your devices, including your Apple TV. So when you crop or enhance a photo from your iPhone, you see the changes when you access your library from your Mac. Your original photos and videos are stored in iCloud and you can go back to them at any time, and revert any changes you made.\n\nPhotos delete from all of your devices\n\nWhen you delete photos and videos on one device, they're deleted everywhere that you use iCloud Photos. If you delete something accidentally, you can recover it in the Recently Deleted folder for 30 days. After that, it's deleted permanently.\n\nDownload copies of your photos and videos\n\nWhen you turn on iCloud Photos, your photos and videos automatically upload to iCloud. They're not duplicated in your iCloud backup, so you should keep backup copies of your library. Use the steps below to download copies of your photos and videos to your Mac or PC. Or you can import your library to your Mac or PC.\n\nDownload your photos and videos from iCloud.com\n\nOn iCloud.com, click Photos.\n\nSelect the photos and videos that you want to download.\n\nTo download in the highest resolution, click the download button in the upper-right corner of the window. Or click the More button , then click More Download Options.\n\nTo download in the format most compatible for your device, JPEG or H.264, select Most Compatible. To download your content as it was originally captured or imported, select Unmodified Original.\n\nClick download.\n\nDownload photos and videos from your iPhone, iPad, or Apple Vision Pro\n\nOpen the Photos app, then select one or more photos or videos.\n\nTap the share button .\n\nTap AirDrop, then select the device that you want to share with. Learn more about using AirDrop.\n\nFor large numbers of photos, learn how to import your photos instead.\n\nDownload photos and videos from your Mac\n\nOn your Mac, open the Photos app.\n\nSelect one or more photos or videos.\n\nDrag the content to your desktop, or Control-click and select Share > AirDrop.\n\nMake sure that you have enough storage\n\nThe photos and videos that you keep in iCloud Photos use your iCloud storage and your device storage. And as long as you have enough space in iCloud and on your device, you can store as many photos and videos as you like.\n\nLearn more about iCloud storage and device storage\n\nGet more iCloud storage\n\nWhen you sign up for iCloud, you automatically get 5GB of free storage. If you need more space, and access to premium features, you can upgrade to iCloud+.\n\nLearn how to upgrade to iCloud+\n\nCheck your iCloud settings for recommendations\n\nIn iOS 17 or iPadOS 17 or later, you can go to your iCloud settings to check whether there are photos and videos that you don't need anymore and can delete.\n\nLearn how to make more space\n\nTurn on Optimize Storage\n\niCloud Photos keeps all your photos and videos in their original, high-resolution version. To save storage space on your device, you can turn on Optimize Storage.\n\nIf you turn on Optimize Storage, iCloud Photos automatically manages the size of your library on your device. Your original photos and videos are stored in iCloud and space-saving versions are kept on your device. Your library is optimized only when you need space, starting with the photos and videos you access least. You can download the original photos and videos over Wi-Fi or cellular when you need them.\n\nIf you turn on Download Originals, iCloud Photos keeps your original, full-resolution photos and videos in iCloud and on your device.\n\nOn your iPhone, iPad, or Apple Vision Pro\n\nGo to Settings > [your name] > iCloud.\n\nTap Photos.\n\nChoose Optimize [device] Storage.\n\nOn your Mac\n\nOpen the Photos app and click Photos in the menu bar.\n\nClick Settings or click Preferences.\n\nGo to the iCloud tab and choose a storage setting.\n\nPause library uploads to iCloud\n\nWhen you turn on iCloud Photos, the time it takes for your photos and videos to upload to iCloud depends on the size of your collection and your internet speed. If you have a large collection of photos and videos, your upload might take more time than usual. You can see the status and pause the upload for one day."
