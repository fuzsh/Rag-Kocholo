If it's on auto, it should show what resolution is being used.\n\nNext is the content you're watching. Since you mentioned Netflix, before beginning playback hit the * button and (unless they've finally disabled it) this turns on a small debug window while playing that shows the resolution and bitrate currently being shown. I went though a multi-month period several years ago when my Netflix was simply terrible, but everything else was fine. My ISP was able to trace something in the Internet itself was throttling my Netflix stream, but they couldn't identify who/what was behind it. It finally went away after several months.\n\nIf absolutely everything is looking bad on this device, and the display is set correctly, you might be getting some WiFi interference that is impacted the Express more than other devices in your home. I'd try changing the WiFi channel in your router as a first step.\n\nDan\n\nRoku Community Streaming Expert\n\nHelp others find this answer and click \"Accept as Solution.\"\n\nIf you appreciate my answer, maybe give me a Kudo.\n\nI am not a Roku employee, just another user.\n\n@mikestuartsells wrote:\n\ni have had Roku Express for a year. and picture on living room TV has been HD quality and fine..then in the last week or so the picture quality is NOT HD level...grainy..and not what it has been...internet is not the issue...and i have bedroom tv with Roku..no issues with that picture quality..and NetFlix is high quality on Living room..i cant find anything on a fix for this and of course i cant get support from Roku..help??\n\nGo to Settings> Display Type And you will be given a choice between what type of display type you have 108OI or 720p or it you can select auto detect if you want Roku to auto detect what type of display you have.\n\n@givemeabreak what specific Roku model are you using? And what TV are you connected to? Are you running the Roku through an AVR, or is it plugged directly into the TV?\n\nI don't use Apple TV very often, but I did test Apple, HBO Max and Prime Video recently on my Ultra 4800. On all channels I get the highest quality the providers offer, which depending on the video might be 1080 HD, 2160 UHD, with HDR or Dolby Vision where offered. The audio is all DD+, with Atmos on titles that support it.\n\nWe need more detail about the information above, and what specific titles you're trying to watch. But your experience doesn't match what most users see. Being able to duplicate your experience is the best way we can attempt to assist.\n\nDan\n\nRoku Community Streaming Expert\n\nHelp others find this answer and click \"Accept as Solution.\"\n\nIf you appreciate my answer, maybe give me a Kudo.\n\nI am not a Roku employee, just another user."
