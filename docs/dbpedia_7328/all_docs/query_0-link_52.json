The picture is not terrible,but you can tell it is not to its fullest picture. I have a DVD player that converts the CD to 1080i and the picture is awesome. Does anyone have a idea on what to",

        "text": "Technically, your television already \"converts (as you say)\" the 480i image you receive to whatever the native resolution of your display happens to be. Upconverting DVD players do this process on their own, with better quality source in the digital domain, so the results are typically better.\n\nWhile there are external \"converters\" you can use (expensive), Scott is 100% correct that it really won't improve it much (if any). If you want to dramatically improve your image quality, opt to upgrade to a high definition satellite box. This way, you can enjoy whatever HD programming is available in HD quality.\n\nOK,you both answered by question,I figured to myself that in order to get a 1080p, you will have to have a HD receiver to get the 1080p to the TV.I was just wondering if they made a out of the box converter instead of having to pay extra for a receiver for HD channels. Like a converter to take a 480 and push it through and out comes 1080 to your TV set.\n\nOK,THANKS SCOTT AND MATT,you pretty much summed it up,i guess I will have to deal with what I have,the picture isn't terrible,but I know it could be better with 1080p.Thanks again,any other ideas,I'm all ears,Thanks,,Mark\n\nI'd call Dishnet and Direct TV and ask what deals they have going, both usually offer free equipment upgrade and installation if you willing to sign a 1 or 2 year contract. Also,how are you getting your local stations ? If its through the sat box you're still only getting SDTV, try using a antenna hooked to your tv's tuner. If it can pick up your local stations you will get them in HD (as long as they are sending HD content) Not only would the picture quality be much better you can watch them during heavy storms which a lot of satelite signals break up then. I run into customers all the time that don't realize they can get HDTV for free off the air, if you are within 25 miles of the station you can usually use a simple set of rabbit ears. In the St.Louis area I often use a paper clip as an antenna and get all the station in HD.It surprises a lot of people..\n\nssfish said:\n\nI'd call Dishnet and Direct TV and ask what deals they have going, both usually offer free equipment upgrade and installation if you willing to sign a 1 or 2 year contract.

When I have a few minutes,i have a few rabbit ears i will try a set and hook up to the set. Channel 5 here has HD output,I am going to check it out and see what a picture difference will make. I hooked my laptop up to the set through HDMI and got 1080i through my laptop. The laptop can play blueray disc,I downloaded a few movies off of Graboid Video,these played back at 780p,not to bad of a picture.OK gotta run,I will let you know with rabbit ears will do,tHANKS for the reply,never thought about using a antenna,I might have to use a digital converter? I will let you know,Mark\n\nYou think your confused now just wait.the 480 for a vertical frame resolution of 480 lines containing picture information; while NTSC has a total of 525 lines, only 480 of these are used to display the image for DV-NTSC.\n\n[edit] Technical Detail\n\nFor analog NTSC there are a total of 525 scanning lines of which originally 486 lines were active (243 complete lines per field) and later 480 (240 complete lines per field). A full frame is split into odd and even fields where an odd field starts with half a line and the even field ends with the other half of the line. By convention an NTSC video frame is considered to start with an even field followed by an odd field. The disparity of the line numbering compared to other systems is solved by defining the line numbering to start five equalising pulses (or 2 and a half lines) earlier than on all other systems (including Systems A and E even though they had no equalising pulses) on the first equalising pulse following an active line or half line. This has the effect of placing a half line of video at the end of the even (first) field and the beginning of the odd (second field). Thus the line numbers correspond to the real lines of the video frame. On all other systems, the field was considered to start with the falling edge of the first field pulse which gave the confusing position that the odd field (first) had a half a line of video occupying the latter half of a whole line and ended with a whole line of video but half a scanning line (and vice versa for the even field). The NTSC convention solved this confusion.[1]\n\nFor DV-NTSC only 480 lines are used. The digitally transmitted horizontal resolution is usually 720 samples (which includes 16 samples for the horizontal sync and horizontal blanking) or 704 visible pixels with an aspect ratio of 4:3 and therefore a display resolution of 640 ? 480 (VGA); that is standard-definition television (SDTV) with a 4:3 aspect ratio.[2][3][4][5]\n\nThe field rate (not the frame rate) is usually (60/100.1% â‰ˆ) 59.94 hertz for color TV and can be rounded up to 60 Hz. There are several conventions for written shorthands for the combination of resolution and rate: 480i60, 480i/60 (EBU) and 480/60i. 480i is usually used in countries that conventionally use NTSC (most of the Americas and Japan), because the 525 transmitted lines at 60 hertz of analogue NTSC contain 480 visible ones.\n\n480i can be transported by all major digital television formats, ATSC, DVB and ISDB.\n\nwikipedia.org,2010.Technical detail.Retrieved November 28,2010 From http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/480i\n\nas for if its using 780p who knows"
