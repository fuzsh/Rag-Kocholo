        "text": "NOTE: <BR>NTSC = Standard Definition regular old color broadcasts.<BR>ATSC = MPEG-2 data, wrapped in error-correction, modulated using 8VSB. The \"over-the-air\" standard for HDTV and what TVs with \"HDTV Tuners\" are capable of receiving and decoding. <BR>Component = Analog HDTV signal that is NOT RELATED to ATSC at all; this is different than NTSC where the broadcast and \"local\" composite signals were the same<BR><BR><BR>Let us suppose that I have an analog video signal that is NTSC. It may be broadcast on a channel (say channel 6) or it may be composite/S-video. It is coming from a video production area and for our purposes it is a black-box that we can't modify or control in any way... might as well be the local news.<BR><BR>Also let us say that I have a bunch of large LCD-TVs or Plasmas (40-46in range); they are widescreen 16:9. They have both analog NTSC tuners as well as ATSC digital tuners. Obviously if we just pipe the 4:3 signal to them we either get black bars on the sides or everyone looks really fat. Neither is an acceptable solution.<BR><BR>I want to display the 4:3 NTSC signal on the left of the widescreens but use a PC to \"overlay\" graphics, clock, weather, whatever on the right-side so there aren't any black bars; basically fill in the blank area with useful information. It will also look really cool. <BR><BR><BR>In the old SD world I can do something like this easy... I just slap an ATI All-in-Wonder in the PC and use the Windows API to grab the input video to display it, overlay the graphics, and the All-in-Wonder does a fine job of spitting it out. I can hook that output to an NTSC modulator (which can be picked up for cheap) and distribute it all over the building and various TVs can tune to it.<BR><BR>If there were just one Widescreen TV to do this on it would be easy as pie even on a widescreen HDTV: I would just use the Component YPbPr output and go direct into the LCD-TV, then set the videocard to an HDTV-compatible resolution.<BR><BR>Alas, that will not do as this needs to be fed to (potentially) a hundred LCD-TVs of varying sizes throughout the building. <BR><BR><BR>With me so far? I'm going to go on a small rabit trail...<BR><BR>In the current NTSC world, since the broadcast and local signals are the same a modulator is a fairly simple analog device that just takes the local audio/video and slaps it into a given \"channel\" in the VHF/UHF range. By tying the cables of various modulators together (or using a combiner) you end up with several channels of video data on one coax cable. This is similar (but much less complicated and expensive) to what the cable company does.<BR><BR>You then run the output of this combined signal into a big amplifier that has coax inputs and outputs and now you have a powerful signal that can be run through various splitters all over the building so 100+ TVs can watch any of the available channels in decent clarity.<BR><BR><BR><BR>Now back to the problem at hand... since (in the HDTV world) the broadcast and local formats are completely different (analog 1080i/720p vs digital MPEG2-8VSB modulated) I cannot just slap the output of an All-In-Wonder's Composite cables into an el-cheapo modulator. Something needs to perform the MPEG-2 encoding first. Then something needs to add the overhead data and do the 8VSB encoding to place the data onto a tunable channel.<BR><BR><BR>(NOTE: DVB-ASI is a standard for placing one or more MPEG-2 streams onto the wire for moving them around video booths, tv stations, or whatever the case may be. I've never worked with it before myself.)<BR><BR>The closest thing I've found so far is this device that takes DVB-ASI data and generates an ATSC broadcast signal. I can certainly take the output of this device and plug it into the combiner and be broadcasting on an HDTV channel. The analog and HDTV channels can even co-exist on the same wire which is handy.<BR><BR><BR>The problem is I have absolutely no clue how to generate the DVB-ASI signal from the PC (besides I have a feeling that the KTech box linked above costs an arm and a leg anyway). <BR><BR><BR>An ideal solution would be a videocard that had an ATSC HDTV output mode on it; the card would take the frame-buffer, perform a real-time MPEG2 encoding, then do the 8VSB modulation and give an ATSC modulated output that can be tuned on any HDTV tuner. That might be asking a bit much but it would certainly solve my problem.<BR><BR><BR><BR>The reason I'm forced into HDTV is because I'm not aware of any way to transmit widescreen information on a regular NTSC channel.<BR><BR>I can't re-run cabling in the building and it wouldn't do me any good anyway because we need around 6 channels and the LCD-TVs must be able to tune into a given channel. That's why a closed-circuit TV distribution system was run and installed in the first place.<BR><BR><BR><BR>So I know this might be a bit in-depth for this forum but any suggestions or pointers would certainly be appreciated. I'm obviously trying to do this for minimal cost."
