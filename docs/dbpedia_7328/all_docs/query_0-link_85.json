        "text": "There's no dumb or even dump questions, and the other responders have explained that everything is ok. This is a bit of background...\n\nWhen motion pictures commenced the experimenters realised that still frames repeated at above 20 frames a second gave the illusion of motion. To give themselves a little leeway they settled on 24 frames a second.\n\nWhen TV commenced at 405 and later 625 line standards, the decision was made to use 25 full frames per second..in Europe. In the USA they went with 30 . In both cases this was due to the national electrical grids being at 50 and 60 Hz.\n\nIn order to reduce the amount of bandwidth or data being sent, the policy was that the 312 lines would be sent to fill up the entire screen, top to bottom leaving a gap between each line, and in the next 50 th of a second, another 312 lines would be sent, filling in the gaps. .. this is the interleaving. The human eye would not be able to respond quickly enough and would see a solid picture. This worked fine with the analogue CRT displays. Only as long as a signal was being received would an image exist on the screen.. there would be no memory effect.\n\nWith a LCD or oled, there is an entire block of memory dedicated to feeding the screen and it can be refreshed as often as the internal electronics will allow... You may have had the experience of say the signal dropping out and the image remaining static on an LCD screen for minutes\n\nThe newer standards allow for 50 full images to appear on the screen per second... 50p , this is richer in texture as it contains twice as much information.\n\nAs a final aside, the initial motion pictures people got it slightly wrong... While 24 pictures per second is ok for a small image directly in front, it's not so good for side on vision. Probably due to our ancestors desire to identify sabertooth tigers sneaking up, we are more sensitive to flicker in peripheral vision. As TVs get bigger, they engage more of this side vision . Hence luxury TVs and computer monitors are going for higher frame rates.\n\nThanks for the info it's overwhelming!! Just moving on a little when I watch TV through my Pano UB700 it shows as 1080p not sure what Hz but notice it's 1080p and not 1080i. Will the PQ be any different between the two as personally I can't see it but some of you may have a different opinion. Thanks in advance.\n\nThe pq is basically set by the amount of information sent by the TV station. The digital electronics extracts out a frames worth, stores it in a block of memory and then keeps displaying that until the memory is overwritten with new data."
