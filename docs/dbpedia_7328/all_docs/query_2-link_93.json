        "text": "wasn't directed to you, even though i know your hanging onto SD for awhile\n\nA few things, First the FCC approved hi-def 9 years ago.. when a hi-def camera cost over a million dollars. At that point it would be like networks switching to Imax to shoot everything, there was no delivery methods, no HD televisions, no HD cable or Satellite. So yeah, sure it took 9 years but in the last 2 years you must admit its been a huge turn to HD... now that people can afford to shoot with it, and afford to view it.\n\nAnd as for 1/2 of 1%.. i think that's a little exaggerated. I mean NBC has 90% of its prime time lineup shot with HD.\n\nAmerican Dreams, Saturday Night Live,Last Call With Carson Daly, Crossing Jordan, ER, Las Vegas, Law & Order, Law & Order: Criminal Intent, Law & Order: Special Victims Unit, The Tonight Show with Jay Leno, and The West Wing, Medium, Revelations, Joey, and pretty much everything else, All HD, either from HD native or from 35mm.\n\ntoday, its pretty hard to buy a big screen Television that isn't HDTV capable. So, i don't know about years and years, I think in the next couple years almost all Television will be broadcast in hi-def, and in our territories it will probably be shortly after that most TV's are hi-def.\n\nNBC shoots a lot of HD, yes. But I'm talking overall. If you subscribe to DirecTV, you have a choice of about 235 channels. 15 of them are high-def. That's about 6%. Same with cable TV. And most of those HD channels are the broadcast networks, and other than prime-time there's very, very, very little HD on those broadcast networks.\n\nSo, okay, you're right, 1/2 of 1% was too low, it's really about 6% overall, but if you look at it from the perspective of at-any-given-time-is-there-HD-on-this-channel, I doubt my 1/2 of 1% guess is too far off.\n\nThe major networks are doing better with their percentage, and very few of the cable channels are airing any sort of HD.\n\nI think about 5 years from now, HD will have some serious market penetration.\n\nI think in the next couple years almost all Television will be broadcast in hi-def\n\nIt depends on what you mean by \"all television\". Last I checked, there are lots of times where more people are tuning in to cable shows than into network broadcasts. And somewhere around 0% of cable networks are broadcasting HD.\n\nIf you define the % of broadcasts as the odds that whatever channel you turn to will have a high-def broadcast on it, I think it's going to be a *LOT* longer than 2 years before that transition is made! Maybe in 10 years. I think 2 years from now HD will be fairly common on the four big networks, yes. But the overwhelmingly vast majority of programming sent to people's homes will still be standard-def.\n\ntoday, its pretty hard to buy a big screen Television that isn't HDTV capable\n\nTrue; but how many of them actually have tuners? Lots and lots of people who have HDTVs have no way to watch any sort of HD on them! There's \"HD Capable\", \"HD Ready\", and \"HD Built-In\" after all...\n\neven though i know your hanging onto SD for awhile\n\nNope -- I can't stand SD. I'm converting to entirely HD by the end of this year. I'd pull the plug on SD today if I thought I could get away with it (and I'd also eliminate interlacing and tape while I was at it!) But like I say, just because you and I may prefer something, that doesn't mean it's going to happen...\n\nBarry_Green said:\n\nIf you subscribe to DirecTV, you have a choice of about 235 channels. 15 of them are high-def. That's about 6%. Same with cable TV. And most of those HD channels are the broadcast networks, and other than prime-time there's very, very, very little HD on those broadcast networks....\n\nI think we are talking about 2 different things, delivery with the source.. sure, there are only a handful of HD channels, but on the other \"SD\" channels, alot of the content has been down sampled to SD from either HD, or 35mm > HD > SD. From my experience, SD channels that I have sold to strongly request a HD deliverable.\n\nHowever, even if we only take those 6 channels in account, and go for the 6% figure, its not really a fair sample because, sure, there are only 6 out of 100 channels that are HD, but what your forgetting is that those 6 channels are being watched by 80% of the people at any given time. I know for me, that figure is close to 95%... I have HD in my house and it would be very rare for me to not be on a HD channel.\n\nAs for the TV thing, \"tuners\" are something people where talking about 5 years ago; that comment is a little dated.. of course you need a source to watch HD, like a HD cable box, which all cable companies deliver. TV's can take HD in over analog Component inputs/DVI or via HDMI.\n\nAnd there are actually quite a few 1080p sets on the market, in fact you can buy crappy name brand 40\" flat panel sets for $1800 now, with 1920x1080 native resolution.\n\nNo need to battle, I guess all we have to decide on is what the terms are that we're discussing. For origination, yes high-buck origination is becoming less common on SD, although there's still a lot of it being done. Most of the sports I can get here are all broadcast SD, it's rare indeed when we get HD. The NBA playoffs were all SD, up until the finals for example. The US Open tennis tournament has been broadcast all SD except for the two or three days CBS broadcast it. The Kentucky Derby and other horse races were all SD, except for the actual race itself (so one minute out of the 60-minute broadcast was HD, all the rest was awful up-rezzed SD). We get some primetime programming in HD, but absolutely no daytime programming in HD, and even the primetime coverage is far from complete...\n\nOf all the cable channels in the universe, I think there are maybe six that we get here on Cox cable that are HD. Discovery, ESPN, InHD1 and 2, a channel of HBO, a channel of Showtime... I think that's about it, other than the broadcast networks. Not exactly every channel! That's why I said \"around 0%\". But you do make a point -- a large percentage of the biggest channels are broadcasting some HD. I was looking at it from the perspective that there's probably 250 channels on the dial, and maybe 10 are HD, and half of those are the broadcast networks ABC/Fox/PBS/NBC/CBS. We don't get TBS or Universal here.\n\nI'm not talking from a production perspective, I'm talking from a consumer-adopting-it perspective. Of the channels that are on in my house round-the-clock, none of 'em are HD (although I wish all of 'em were).\n\nThen again, you're coming at it from the young-single-male perspective, whereas I'm the old-married-family-of-four type, so obviously our perspectives are different. So Jarred can easily say \"hey, everything I watch is HD\", and I can say \"there's very little HD on\" and we can both still be right. It depends on what you're watching, and who's watching the channels that are broadcasting HD, and who's watching channels that don't broadcast HD."
