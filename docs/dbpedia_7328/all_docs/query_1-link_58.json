        "text": "In the early years of the twentieth century, NBC and Universal began creating their extraordinary legacies in the exciting new worlds of motion picture production and distribution, location-based entertainment, radio and television production and broadcasting. Today, as one company under the ownership of Comcast, NBCUniversal continues to build on this legacy of quality and innovation.\n\nExplore Our Legacy\n\nAn Industry Is Born\n\nAs the twentieth century began, so did the meteoric rise of the film industry, and moving pictures became a mass entertainment medium. Playing a key role was a German immigrant from Chicago (by way of Laupheim) named Carl Laemmle. Laemmle went on to found the Universal Film Manufacturing Company, a business that would evolve and eventually merge with NBC to become NBCUniversal.\n\n1912\n\nCarl Laemmle founds Universal\n\nCarl Laemmle's Independent Moving Pictures Company merged with five other film companies to create the Universal Film Manufacturing Company, headed by Laemmle. For the first time, a single entity encompassed all facets of the movie industry: production, distribution, and exhibition.\n\n1914\n\nFilm production begins for Universal\n\nFilm production begins on the iconic Universal City lot, and Damon and Pythias becomes the first film to be completed on a Universal lot.\n\n1915\n\nUniversal City opens its gates\n\nAt its opening, Universal City was billed as \"the only moving-picture city in the world.\"\n\n1917\n\nNoble Johnson signs with Universal\n\nNoble Johnson is the first Black actor to sign a major studio contract with Universal. He went on to become a renowned film industry pioneer, with his beginnings at Universal chronicled through his employee time cards in the Universal Archive Collections.\n\nThe Birth of the National Broadcasting Corporation\n\nNBC made it possible for a national audience to share in a single experience, be it a presidential address or a baseball game. David Sarnoff, founder of NBC Radio Network, had envisioned such a service as early as 1915, when he proposed a broadcast radio network whereby \"events of national importance can be simultaneously announced and received,\" and \"baseball scores can be transmitted in the air.\" His vision became a reality in 1926, with the founding of NBC.\n\n1926\n\nDavid Sarnoff founds the nation's first permanent radio network, NBC\n\nHeralding NBC's arrival, this advertisement appeared in newspapers across the nation.\n\n1927\n\nRadio captures the nation's imagination\n\nLandmark radio broadcasts for NBC included the Rose Bowl, which was the first coast-to-coast radio network broadcast, the Tunney-Dempsey heavyweight fight, and Charles Lindbergh's return to the U.S. after the first trans-Atlantic flight.\n\n1928\n\nNBC Radio debuts its first serial drama\n\nReal Folks premiered on August 6, 1928.

Laemmle produced the film on a tight schedule, filming mostly at night on a rented sound-on-film recording system – and it remains a historic milestone for Universal.\n\n1929\n\nNBC Sounds the Chimes\n\nNBC had used chimes as a switching cue from its beginnings as a radio network.

Universal's unique approach to the horror world cemented the studio's authority in the genre.\n\nNBC begins experimental TV broadcasts from atop new Empire State Building\n\nThis doll, named Felix the Cat, was one of the first images ever broadcast by television.

Toscanini had just retired to his native Italy after having conducted the New York Philharmonic since 1929.\n\n1937\n\nMission accomplished\n\nSarnoff's bold plan works. With the promise that Toscanini could handpick his musicians and the musical repertory, Toscanini agrees to conduct 10 concerts during the upcoming season, for a fee of $4,000 each. He would end up staying 17 years.\n\n1937\n\nThe maestro says no\n\nNBC's plan to boost revenue by selling commercials during the NBC Symphony broadcasts does not get the reception NBC had hoped for.\n\n1937\n\nArturo Toscanini\n\nThrough NBC's radio broadcasts, Toscanini became a celebrity and a household name.\n\n1939\n\nDavid Sarnoff launches regular TV service from the 1939 World's Fair in Flushing, Queens\n\nSarnoff spoke from the RCA Exhibit Building, heralding the birth of \"a new art and a new industry, which eventually will provide entertainment and information for millions.\"\n\nNBC begins regularly programmed television service – scheduled broadcasts of shows and national events, in a daily, weekly, or season-long series\n\nView Gallery\n\n1939\n\nRCA released this announcement heralding the arrival of television\n\nThe press release noted this event to be \"the first time a news event has been covered by means of this new art.\"\n\n1939\n\nThis screen shot shows David Sarnoff at the podium\n\nSarnoff's remarks were titled \"The Birth of a New Industry.\"\n\n1939\n\nThe first televised Major League Baseball game\n\nThe Cincinnati Reds played the Brookyn Dodgers at Ebbets Field on August 26.\n\n1939\n\nThe first televised football game\n\nThe Fordham Rams battled the Wayneburg Yellow Jackets at Triborough Stadium on Randall's Island in New York City.\n\nTwo months after the birth of television, an NBC executive attempts to get TVs into the hands of employees\n\nView Gallery\n\n1939\n\nMorton sends a memo\n\nNBC executive Alfred “Doc” Morton arranged discounted prices on TV sets for NBC employees, convinced that “we must get people talking about television.”\n\n1939\n\nMorton sends a second memo\n\nApparently, the first memo didn’t result in much action.

World War II stalled this, as the nation's resources were devoted to the war effort (including Brigadier General David Sarnoff, founder of NBC who served as General Eisenhower's communications expert). However in this era, some national events did come to life on TV screens – setting the stage for the rise of TV in America.\n\n1940\n\nAbbott and Costello make Universal debut\n\nBurlesque comic duo Bud Abbott and Lou Costello made their debut as Universal stars in 1940 with One Night in the Tropics, the first of 29 films made for the studio.
