        "text": "I’ve shot some footage at 1080i 24p using a Panasonic HPX-170 and I’ve read I can convert that to true 24fps 1080p in post.\n\nI’ve tried a number of different ways to convert what I shot but I am still seeing interlacing in moving objects when I’m done. Reverse telecine didn’t work for me, etc.\n\nI know how to log and transfer, use compressor, use FCP etc. I just don’t understand how to do the the conversion from the HPX 170 to true progressive frames on the computer.\n\nI don’t need help using the programs – I’m ok there – But if someone could give me a step by step of the conversion process from log and transfer to at clean 1080 24p that would really help me out.\n\nWhen I log and transfer the files into FCP 7 the vid rate is 29.97. I’m not sure if that is how they are supposed to be or if that is part of my problem. I shot at 1080i 24p… why would they be 29.97?\n\nThanks for any help!\n\nIf you want 23.98 from that camera at 1080i…you need to shoot 1080i 24pA. The A means ADVANCED, and FCP will see that flag and remove pulldown, to get you 23.98. If you shot 1080i 24p…then it is 24p over 60…and will come in as 29.97. Now you need to use Cinema Tools to remove the pulldown…and you might have to experiment with the settings to see which one works right.\n\nAgain, if you want 1080p 23.98…you need to have the camera in 1080i 24pA mode.\n\nShane\n\nLittle Frog Post\n\nRead my blog, Little Frog in High Def\n\nThanks, I’ll try it again using 24pA\n\nThen do I just log and transfer the files into FCP using a 23.98 sequence settings?\n\nJust so I can try to understand what is going on: When shooting 24pA are there actually 24 progressive frames being recorded within the 60 fields?\n\nI understand the basics of interlacing in NTSC and how that worked for decades for TV – converting film 24 fps to 29.97 with pulldown, etc.\n\nBut I’ve never really understood how something that is recording in fields could ever truly be progressive. It seems to me that the best you could hope for is (2) 1/60 second fields being blended into a “progressive” frame.\n\nBut maybe I just fundamentally don’t understand how fields can record. Does 24pA actually record 24 true progressive frames inside 59.94 fields a second?\n\nI’ve never really been able to wrap my head around this concept.\n\nThanks again\n\n[Chris Jones] “Then do I just log and transfer the files into FCP using a 23.98 sequence settings? “\n\nSequence settings don’t matter here. Log and Transfer needs to be set to REMOVE PULLDOWN when importing. It defaults to this setting, so you should be fine.\n\n[Chris Jones] “Just so I can try to understand what is going on: When shooting 24pA are there actually 24 progressive frames being recorded within the 60 fields? “\n\nYes. They are recorded with advance pulldown so that it can be removed. That camera only shoots 30fps at 1080. If you want TRUE progressive 23.98…shoot 720p. We shoot 720p24 all the time…true 23.98, and it looks fine when converted to 1080 for mastering. I mean, we do this ALL the time.\n\nShane\n\nLittle Frog Post\n\nRead my blog, Little Frog in High Def\n\nI do keep hearing to shot in 720p on this camera. I’ll do some test tomorrow in that mode.\n\n[Shane Ross] “That camera only shoots 30fps at 1080”\n\nI am curious about this – do I have this correct?\n\nIs the fact that in 1080 mode is not true 24p because the 24p frames are not spaced equally apart in time?\n\nMeaning there are really 30 progressive frames (recorded twice – unless using 720 PN) but then 6 of those progressive frames are dropped to give you 24p? Which would give you (6) 1/30th of a second spaces of “missing time” during playback?\n\n[Chris Jones] “Is the fact that in 1080 mode is not true 24p because the 24p frames are not spaced equally apart in time?\n\nMeaning there are really 30 progressive frames (recorded twice – unless using 720 PN) but then 6 of those progressive frames are dropped to give you 24p? Which would give you (6) 1/30th of a second spaces of “missing time” during playback?”\n\nHere we go again.\n\nYou should do a search for 3:2 cadence and all will become clear. The 1080/60 mode records a field/frame sequence that accommodates the 24 frames the camera is producing, with no gaps. The 1080i mode for this camera, AFAIK, is true 2:3, which will require a reverse telecine to recover a 24P base framerate. In 720P60, the 24 frames are recorded with an Advanced Pulldown cadence, which is 2:3:3:2. You can regard the 60 (or 59.94) as individual frames or the analogs of otherwise interlaced or segmented (sF) fields, as they would be in 1080 or 525. The trick to it all for Panasonic is the AP sequence allows them to flag the “middle” redundant 29.97 frame (of the 5), and simply throw it away on import, so you get a true 24P media stream.\n\njPo\n\nYou mean “Old Ben”? Ben Kenobi?\n\n[Shane Ross] ” That camera only shoots 30fps at 1080. If you want TRUE progressive 23.98…shoot 720p.”\n\nActually Shane the AG-HPX170 works just like the HVX200 in 1080. The customer has a choice of shooting in 24P or 24PA. For easy removal shoot in 24PA. In 720 they would shoot in 24PN(native.) I know it gets confusing with all the cameras and technology out there, but the right answer here is shoot in 24PA in 1080, that will give you 24Progressive frames on the timeline when it is set up to do 23.98 and remove pulldown.\n\nBest,\n\nJan\n\nJan Crittenden Livingston\n\nProduct Manager, AVCCAM, AG-3DA1, AG-AF100\n\nPanasonic Broadcast & TV Systems\n\n[Jan Crittenden Livingston] “but the right answer here is shoot in 24PA in 1080, that will give you 24Progressive frames on the timeline when it is set up to do 23.98 and remove pulldown.”\n\nI know Jan, but it shoots 24pA at 29.97…with pulldown. It doesn’t shoot 24pN at 1080, only 720. That’s the only format that it shoots 24 actual fps. But yes, pulldown is easily removed if you shoot 1080pA (well, in FCP, in Avid it is far more complex)…but it shoots it at 29.97 nuntheless. Which was my point.\n\nShane\n\nLittle Frog Post\n\nRead my blog, Little Frog in High Def\n\nHello Shane\n\nI have read over the years your helpful answers to so many questions on this forum.\n\nQuestion:\n\nI am shooting something on my HVX that will be for broadcast. The producer wants me to shoot in 1080 24p (23.98) Here are the spec they require:\n\nPHOTOGRAPHED IN:\n\nAspect Ratio – 16:9 HD\n\nShooting Format – HDCAM SR / HDCAM / DVC PRO HD / HDV / XDCAM HD 35 megabit\n\nStandard (resolution / scanning method / frame rate) – 1080i 59.94 / 1080i 50 / 1080 Psf 23.98 / 1080 Psf 25 / 720 P 59.94 / 720 P 50 / 720 P 25 / 720 P 23.98\n\nMASTERED AND DELIVERED: 16:9 NATIVE on SONY HDCAM 1080i/59.94\n\nThe HVX only has a 1080i 24p setting and not a 1080p (as you know)\n\nWill this be a problem when editing and outputting to the specified delivery parameters?\n\nI have also read on here that it might be better to shoot in 24pa.\n\nI’m quite confused on what to do.\n\nI would appreciate any help you can provide.\n\nThank you in advance.\n\n-Edgar"
