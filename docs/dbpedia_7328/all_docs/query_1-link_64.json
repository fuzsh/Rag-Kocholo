        "text": "TriNetX has partnered with healthcare organizations spanning 30 countries and thousands of sites, and with data providers covering 99% of US health plans to deploy a linked and continually updated global health research network. Unlike traditional health research data sources, TriNetX aggregates information directly from electronic medical records (EMR) systems on a continuous basis, resulting in data that is current and more representative of the true patient population. TriNetX partner healthcare organizations include a mix of hospital, primary care, and specialty treatment providers spanning a wide range of geographies, age groups, and income levels.\n\nDefine your cohort.\n\nIf you’re a TriNetX subscriber, you already know how to quickly explore billions of health facts and define new research cohorts through our flexible web-based cohort builder.\n\nIf you’re new to TriNetX, rest assured that no subscription is required. You and a researcher from our Clinical Sciences team will use this same tool together to build the exact cohort you need. We believe in transparency at every step.\n\n❯ Click to view\n\nReview the data.\n\nWe’ll carefully review the summary statistics and fill rates with you to make sure your cohort comes with all the data you need to power your analysis. Refine the size and criteria of your cohort until it’s perfect.\n\n❯ Click to view\n\nTo understand the patient journey, you may need to dive deeper than aggregate counts and means. Spanning domains from diagnoses to genomic variants, our data sets attribute every observation to a pseudonymized patient ID, encounter, and date, making it straightforward to build robust longitudinal pictures of today’s patients. We deliver the data in a universal, ready-to-use format—linked CSV tables—to give you the freedom to analyze on any application you choose.\n\nDownload the Data Set Snapshot for high-level information on the clinical facts and data coverage within four top therapeutic areas.\n\nCurated data sets are designed to be immediately usable. They’re built upon a normalized, standards-based terminology that is an OMOP inspired, Native TriNetX Format, or the Sentinel Common Data Model, ensuring compatibility and ease of use. These research-ready data sets include calculated, derived variables like BMI, and new therapeutic-specific tables and facts purpose-built your analysis.\n\nOur linked data sets combine data sourced from EHR and insurance claims into a single, longitudinal record - for each one of the 11.2 million patients represented in both sources. Secure and rapid tokenization allows us to match EHR and claim records on a per-patient basis without ever accessing or exposuring personally identifying information. The result is a robust record that follows a patient across time and between providers, bringing demographics, clinical observations, treatment details, and costs under one view. By further linking with federal death registries and private obituaries, we support analyses of long-term survival in addition to the full array of HEOR, efficacy, and safety analyses.\n\nFinding the data you need for your research can be a complex exercise. Large data set purchases often contain data you don’t need; identifying appropriate inclusion/exclusion criteria can be time consuming and costly; there may be data sources well-suited to your needs that you haven’t identified. Allow TriNetX data and platform experts to take the burden of data curation off your plate. Our team will understand your data needs, build and iterate on a query across our global data network, and ensure that you are delivered one data set suited to your needs."
