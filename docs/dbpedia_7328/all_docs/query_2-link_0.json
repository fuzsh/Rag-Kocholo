        "text": "High-definition television (HDTV) in the United States was introduced in 1998 and has since become increasingly popular and dominant in the television market. Hundreds of HD channels are available in millions of homes and businesses both terrestrially and via subscription services such as satellite, cable and IPTV. HDTV has quickly become the standard, with about 85% of all TVs used being HD as of 2018.[1][failed verification] In the US, the 720p and 1080i formats are used for linear channels, while 1080p is available on a limited basis, mainly for pay-per-view and video on demand content. Some networks have also began transmitting content at 1080p via ATSC 3.0 multiplex channels, with CBS and NBC affiliates being the main stations that transmit at 1080p.\n\nProposals and introduction\n\n[edit]\n\nThe Federal Communications Commission (FCC) began soliciting proposals for a new television standard for the U.S. in the late 1980s and later decided to ask companies competing to create the standard to pool their resources and work together, forming what was known as the Grand Alliance in 1993.\n\nOn July 23, 1996, WRAL-TV (the then CBS affiliate in Raleigh, North Carolina; now affiliated with NBC) became the first television station in the United States to broadcast a digital television signal.[2]\n\nHDTV sets became available in the U.S. in 1998 and broadcasts began around November 1998. The first public HDTV broadcast was of the launch of the Space Shuttle Discovery and John Glenn's return to space; that broadcast was made possible in part by the Harris Corporation.[3] The first commercial broadcast of a local sporting event in HD was during Major League Baseball's Opening Day on March 31, 1998, the Texas Rangers against the Chicago White Sox from The Ballpark in Arlington in Arlington, TX. The telecast was produced by LIN Productions, and overseen by LIN Productions president and Texas Rangers television executive producer Lee Spieckerman. The game was also the inaugural telecast on the digital channel of Dallas/Fort Worth, Texas NBC affiliate KXAS channel 5. The event was simultaneously shown via satellite at a reception attended by members of congress, the FCC and members of the industry in Washington, DC. This telecast was also the first commercial HD broadcast in the state of Texas.[4] The first major sporting event broadcast nationwide in HD was Super Bowl XXXIV, broadcast by ABC on January 30, 2000. By the 2014–15 season every network show producing new episodes had transitioned to high definition.[5]\n\nSatellite and cable\n\n[edit]\n\nSatellite television companies in the United States, such as Dish Network and DirecTV, started to carry HD programming in 2003. Satellite transmissions in the U.S. use various forms of PSK modulation. A separate tuner is required to receive HD satellite broadcasts.\n\nCable television companies in the U.S. generally prefer to use 256-QAM to transmit HDTV. Many of the newer HDTVs with integrated digital tuners include support for decoding 256-QAM in addition to 8VSB for OTA digital. Cable television companies started carrying HDTV in 2003.\n\nCurrently, HD programming is carried by all major television networks in nearly all DMAs, including ABC, CBS, NBC, FOX, PBS, The CW, MyNetworkTV, Telemundo, Univision, and UniMás; and on many independent stations. All but a select few of cable networks offer an HD broadcast to cable and satellite companies.\n\nHD programming on broadcast and premium networks such as HBO and Showtime had Dolby Digital 5.1.\n\nList of current American high-definition channels\n\n[edit]\n\nName First-launched HD service HD Format[6] Letterbox/Pillarbox Category Type A&E September 4, 2006 1080i N/A Entertainment Cable ABC September 16, 2001 720p Pillarbox (2001–2016)\n\nLetterbox (2016–present) Broadcast AccuWeather Network March 10, 2015 1080i N/A News Cable Adult Swim October 15, 2007 Pillarbox (2007–2013)\n\nLetterbox (2013–present) Entertainment Altitude N/A Sports - Regional AMC Entertainment American Heroes Channel Animal Planet Lifestyle AT&T SportsNet April 1, 2011 1080p Sports – Regional ASPiRE June 27, 2012 1080i Entertainment AWE June 1, 2004 1080i Lifestyle AXS TV September 6, 2001 Entertainment Azteca July 16, 2012 Broadcast – Spanish Broadcast BBC America July 20, 2009 Entertainment Cable BBC World News August 5, 2013 News beIN Sports June 1, 2012 720p Sports beIN Sports en Español Sports – Spanish BET March 23, 2011 1080i Entertainment BET Her Big Ten Network 2009 720p Sports - College Bloomberg TV May 9, 2011 1080i News Boomerang (TV network) March 4, 2019 720p Family Bravo 2007 1080i Lifestyle Cars.TV May 2009 Sports Cartoon Network October 15, 2007 Pillarbox (2007–2013)\n\nLetterbox (2013–present) Family CBS September 1998 Pillarbox (1998–2018)\n\nLetterbox (2018–present) Broadcast CBS Sports Network August 2008 Sports Cable Cinemax (MoreMax, ActionMax, ThrillerMax, 5starMax, MovieMax, OuterMax, MaxLatino) September 1, 2008 Premium Movies Premium CMT N/A Entertainment Cable CNBC October 10, 2007 News CNN September 6, 2007 Comedy Central January 13, 2009 Entertainment Comedy.TV May 2009 Cooking Channel March 31, 2008 Lifestyle Crime & Investigation Network April 1, 2005 720p Pillarbox Entertainment The CW September 18, 2006 1080i Broadcast Daystar N/A 720p Religion Cable Destination America March 31, 2008 1080i Lifestyle Discovery Channel June 2002 Entertainment Discovery en Español July 2016 Spanish Discovery Familia July 2016 Spanish Discovery Family October 10, 2010 Family Discovery Life February 1, 2011 Lifestyle Disney Channel April 2, 2008[7] 720p Pillarbox (2008–2017)\n\nLetterbox (2017–present) Family Disney Junior March 23, 2012 Pillarbox (2012–2017)\n\nLetterbox (2017–present) Disney XD February 13, 2009 Pillarbox (2009–2017)\n\nLetterbox (2017–present) E!
