        "text": "Is it just me ? The last two postings in this thread mean absolutely nothing.to me. Perhaps the posters might like to explain what the they mean to to those of us who thought we understand the technology, what the they are talking about\n\nYou would be confused if you had never understood standards conversion otherwise known as upscaling, downscaling, or converting resolutions.\n\nThe first digital standards converter called DICE was invented by the IBA; before then it was a camera pointing at a monitor; actually more sophisticated than it sounds.\n\nBroadcast digital standards converters work by interpolation ie guessing what each pixel should be in terms of RGB. The first digital generation worked on about 3 or 4 lines (of the analogue signal). The next generation worked not only with point interpolation but also by spacial/time interpolation. ie the converter looks at the preceding frames as well. Now they are limited by throughput.\n\ntechnologist was just saying that upscaling is standards conversion whichever way you look at it. Frame rate changes are just as irrelevant as line rate as far as the converter is concerned.\n\nMembers have no right to describe a post as rubbish, just because they have no experience in the technology. Better to politely ask for an explanation as grahamthompson did. But that is probably beyond some of the think-they-know-it-all posters on here.\n\n0\n\nI have seen the explanation, but forgotten it! However, the basic principles can be explained .......\n\n(If somebody wants to wade through the EBU website technical papers section, there's PROBABLY something relevant there ............).\n\nIt's all about using the lowest integer ratios, compatible with what you want to do.\n\nFor example, take analogue colour tv. Here's how the NTSC subcarrier frequency was chosen:\n\n\"The 59.94 rate is derived from the following calculations. Designers chose to make the chrominance subcarrier frequency an n + 0.5 multiple of the line frequency to minimize interference between the luminance signal and the chrominance signal. (Another way this is often stated is that the color subcarrier frequency is an odd multiple of half the line frequency.) They then chose to make the audio subcarrier frequency an integer multiple of the line frequency to minimize visible (intermodulation) interference between the audio signal and the chrominance signal. The original black-and-white standard, with its 15750 Hz line frequency and 4.5 MHz audio subcarrier, does not meet these requirements, so designers had either to raise the audio subcarrier frequency or lower the line frequency. Raising the audio subcarrier frequency would prevent existing (black and white) receivers from properly tuning in the audio signal. Lowering the line frequency is comparatively innocuous, because the horizontal and vertical synchronization information in the NTSC signal allows a receiver to tolerate a substantial amount of variation in the line frequency. So the engineers chose the line frequency to be changed for the color standard. In the black-and-white standard, the ratio of audio subcarrier frequency to line frequency is 4.5 MHz / 15,750 = 285.71. In the color standard, this becomes rounded to the integer 286, which means the color standard's line rate is 4.5 MHz / 286 = approximately 15,734 lines per second. Maintaining the same number of scan lines per field (and frame), the lower line rate must yield a lower field rate. Dividing (4,500,000 / 286) lines per second by 262.5 lines per field gives approximately 59.94 fields per second\".\n\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NTSC#Color_encoding\n\n(the 1 Mhz quadrature subcarrier first goes \"in at the high end\" - somewhere above 3 MHz, to minimise dot pattern size on screen - then, you've got to fidddle about for minium intermodulation, which would cause other distortion. They ended up slightly changing the field rate from 60 Hz, to make it all exactly fit!).\n\nPal was more complicated, with the notorious \"8 field sequence\" ..........\n\nAnyway, with HDTV, you want \"easiest possible conversions\" between all the different SD and HD standards worldwide. Roughly twice the detail, then backwards compatibility with the legacy analogue format, gives you a starting point. Then, all the different frame/line rates have to \"fit together\" at the lowest possible integer ratios.\n\nFor example, say going from 720 to 1080 involves a 3:4 integer ratio (it isn't !), that's a lot better than a 7:8 ratio, which would involve more samples and interpolation and computing power needed ...........\n\n(added) also remember, HD video will be compressed. Possibly, expanded then re-compressed several times! SO, you want to minimise artifacts from this, which may further restrict the integer ratios ..........\n\n0"
