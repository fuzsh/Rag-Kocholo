        "text": "Stephen\n\nYou seem a bit fixated on the issue of running a mixed format channel - I've never suggested that channels such as BBC1 should do this.\n\nWhen I asked when BBC1 was going HD, I was of course referring to the broadcast side - and it seems that this is still some way off!\n\nThe first efforts at UK broadcast HD will be coming from Sky - essentially this is likely to mean at first, a couple of film channels, sport and probably a drama channel of some sort. Others will likely (or at least we all hope ) come on board over time (hopefully not too long either )!\n\nOK though, this is a personal opinion, as Sky haven't released details yet!\n\nHowever, sport is an area where 720p will have an advantage over 1080i - a fact not lost on some of the sports content providers in the US. Sport uses a lot of slow motion, reverse play and other timebase effects - they like cameras like the Varicam as in their words, the footage is good-to-go straight from the camera (meaning fairly instant slow motion availability for example which is a nice-have if you are broadcasting live sport).\n\nIt also means any possible deinterlacing effects at the consumer end of the chain are effectively negated in one fell swoop!\n\nWe don't yet know what Sky's plans are - some say it will be 720p while other claim it will be 1080i - we'll have to wait and see! They may run some channels in one and others in the other!\n\nIf they do that, I'd like to see 1080psF used on the 1080 channels rather than filtered 1080i, if they decided that 1080/25p was a no-go! It's unlikely that anyone will be watching HD on interlaced HD displays anyway, and even if they are watching on SD interlaced only CRTs for some reason, then they were always going to have to build in SD conversion into the receiver anyway!\n\nFor 1080/50i originated material, I'd prefer them to deinterlace and scale it to 720p, and broadcast it as such on a 720p channel, rather than having to rely on the deinterlacers/scalers at the consumer end (especially if most of the deinterlacers fitted into displays are of the kind Silicon Optix is suggesting)\n\nNone of this was really much of an issue when we were all watching SD TV on interlaced CRTs. Having seen some of the efforts at displaying this interlaced broadcast content on progressive displays such as LCD etc, it remains to be seen whether they'll be any better with interlaced HD!\n\nAs you hinted at yourself, some are poor to say the least!\n\nHowever I'm torn by the poor-quality de-interlacing that most progressive displays are likely to employ\n\nSame here really - I'm sure that higher end offboard deinterlacers will probably be pretty good by the time HD arrives (probably expensive though) - it's the inbuilt ones in the displays (which the vast majority will be using) I'm not so sure about!\n\nProgressive broadcasts would neatly sidestep at least this issue!\n\nHowever it looks like it's going to come down to a straight choice between 1080i and 720p, as you said - 1080/25p won't be on the table, so it's perhaps a moot point in the end!\n\nWhat would be nice is every channel broadcast in both 720p and 1080i - we could make our own minds up then, depending on what equipment we had.\n\nNot that this will ever happen though!!\n\nBut here's another one for you - if you had a programme produced in 1080/50p (OK say it's 2 years from now), how would you choose to broadcast it - 1080/50i or 720/50p?\n\nLikewise, fast forward 2 years, and BluRay is here (or HDVD) - and they decide to release two versions of your favourite film - one is 1080/50i on the disc, the other is 1080/25p on the disc - which version will you buy?\n\nMikeK said:\n\nStephen\n\nWe don't yet know what Sky's plans are - some say it will be 720p while other claim it will be 1080i - we'll have to wait and see! They may run some channels in one and others in the other!\n\nWell Sky's studio(s) (presumably being built for Sky Sports HD?) is being built by Sony - so the cameras themselves will be 1080line. Whether Sky use their native 1080 output or a cross-converted 720 output from the CCU who knows... (I don't think Sony make 720p native cameras)\n\nIf they do that, I'd like to see 1080psF used on the 1080 channels rather than filtered 1080i, if they decided that 1080/25p was a no-go!\n\nI think that 1080psF being employed is encumbent on receiver filtering being a part of the DVB/MPEG4/VC-1/MPEG2 standard implementation - so that a filtered 50i output can still be delivered. After all 1080/50i is one of the HD-ready standards - so a clean 50i signal surely has to be part of this?\n\nI accept that if this is the case then 1080psF IS employable then it has real advantages - though if it were to be implemented it would presumably mean the whole channel running in 1080psF (at 25p) - otherwise you'd still have the 50i vs 25p issue of signalling and processing? It may be carried as 50i, but it isn't 50i?\n\nIt's unlikely that anyone will be watching HD on interlaced HD displays anyway, and even if they are watching on SD interlaced only CRTs for some reason, then they were always going to have to build in SD conversion into the receiver anyway!\n\nYep - though people who care about picture quality are likely to try and watch 50i on 50i displays if possible. If I can I will.\n\nFor 1080/50i originated material, I'd prefer them to deinterlace and scale it to 720p, and broadcast it as such on a 720p channel, rather than having to rely on the deinterlacers/scalers at the consumer end (especially if most of the deinterlacers fitted into displays are of the kind Silicon Optix is suggesting)\n\nI'd rather have the full horizontal bandwith! (And display on a 50i display if at all possible)\n\nNone of this was really much of an issue when we were all watching SD TV on interlaced CRTs. Having seen some of the efforts at displaying this interlaced broadcast content on progressive displays such as LCD etc, it remains to be seen whether they'll be any better with interlaced HD!\n\nAs you hinted at yourself, some are poor to say the least!\n\nYep - though I've seen some very good de-interlacers as well.\n\nHowever I'm torn by the poor-quality de-interlacing that most progressive displays are likely to employ\n\nSame here really - I'm sure that higher end offboard deinterlacers will probably be pretty good by the time HD arrives (probably expensive though) - it's the inbuilt ones in the displays (which the vast majority will be using) I'm not so sure about!\n\nOr the receivers - in the US it is just as common to fix the receiver output to a single standard and thus the display, though others allow the display to run at two standards and the display to switch resolutions.\n\nProgressive broadcasts would neatly sidestep at least this issue!\n\nHowever it looks like it's going to come down to a straight choice between 1080i and 720p, as you said - 1080/25p won't be on the table, so it's perhaps a moot point in the end!\n\nYep - now the HD-ready interconnect standard is a straight choice between 720/50p and 1080/50i I think that decision is out of anyone's hands.\n\nWhat would be nice is every channel broadcast in both 720p and 1080i - we could make our own minds up then, depending on what equipment we had.\n\nNot that this will ever happen though!!\n\nEspecially if they decided to share the bandwith...\n\nBut here's another one for you - if you had a programme produced in 1080/50p (OK say it's 2 years from now), how would you choose to broadcast it - 1080/50i or 720/50p?\n\n1080/50i - as displays are likely to have improved their resolution by then, so the 1920 horizontal resolution will be resolvable, and the vertical resolution of 720p and 1080i are about the same. 1080/50i seems to win - higher vertical resolution, the same vertical resolution (ish), as 720/50p. 720/50p would potentially have better resolution on moving images - but whether this offsets the higher resolution of 1080i horizontally?\n\nIn two years the quality of de-interlacers will presumably also have improved.\n\nLikewise, fast forward 2 years, and BluRay is here (or HDVD) - and they decide to release two versions of your favourite film - one is 1080/50i on the disc, the other is 1080/25p on the disc - which version will you buy?\n\n1080/50i has no advantage for 25p source material, so no contest, I'd go for the 1080/25p source - though if I had a 50i display, I'd expect a 25p recording to replay with 50i interlace vertical pre-filtering.\n\n1080/50i - as displays are likely to have improved their resolution by then, so the 1920 horizontal resolution will be resolvable, and the vertical resolution of 720p and 1080i are about the same. 1080/50i seems to win - higher vertical resolution, the same vertical resolution (ish), as 720/50p. 720/50p would potentially have better resolution on moving images - but whether this offsets the higher resolution of 1080i horizontally?\n\nIn two years the quality of de-interlacers will presumably also have improved.\n\nWhile your case may be valid for 25p material, it isn't for 50p material!\n\nThis will become a real bone of contention when it eventually kicks in!\n\nThe vertical resolution of 1080/50i, when attempting to transmit and recover 1080/50p originated material, is not equal to 720/50p - and if you think about it, you'll see why.\n\nThe source is 1920x1080 at 50Hz, and your broadcast options are 1920x540 at 50Hz (1080i), and 1280x720 at 50Hz (720p)\n\nWith 1080i, for the first i field, you'll be sending only the first p frames odd numbered pixel rows - you can't send it's even numbered rows in the next field, as that field will have to be used for the second p frame's even numbered rows - and so on!! Hence 50% of each frame would have to be discarded, and it's all coming off the resolution in one direction only!\n\nWhichever format you choose, you are going to lose approx 50% in spatial resolution for each frame - and that's assuming neither the broadcaster nor the display applies any vertical filtering to the interlaced signal - and they will have to do this!\n\nField combination at the deinterlacer can't be done (the fields are from different frames) - you'll have to rely on a video mode, and here is where it can so easily all go wrong. You could easily end up with each output 1920x1080 frame having been scaled from each input 1920x540 field (and to allow for deinterlacers which did this, you'd have to vertically filter the interlaced signal to reduce row twitter on horizontal detail). More advanced video mode deinterlacers could attempt to combine the areas of the fields which it thinks haven't changed - but it then depends on how good it is at doing this - even getting it right 99% of the time isn't good enough, as the other 1% of the time you'd have combing artefacts.\n\nIt would then still have to interpolate the areas which have changed, and final output will again depend on how good it is at doing this!\n\nEven if it's a good one, it's never as good as it needs to be - if it were, we would never need a film mode on deinterlacers (which essentially weave top and bottom fields together from a 50i signal to recreate the original 25p source frames - errors in the cadence and field ID flag errors notwithstanding (although it would still need to be able to deal with these as they occur)).\n\nFor a 1080 display it's then a contest between how well the display's scaler scales downscaled 1280x720 up to 1920x1080, against how well it scales downscaled and filtered 1920x540 up to 1920x1080.\n\nFor a 720p display, the choice would be obvious IMO.\n\nHence I think we'll have to agree to disagree again on this point - I think transmission of 1080/50p originated material, would best be served by broadcasting it in 720/50p!\n\nMikeK said:\n\n1080/50i - as displays are likely to have improved their resolution by then, so the 1920 horizontal resolution will be resolvable, and the vertical resolution of 720p and 1080i are about the same. 1080/50i seems to win - higher vertical resolution, the same vertical resolution (ish), as 720/50p. 720/50p would potentially have better resolution on moving images - but whether this offsets the higher resolution of 1080i horizontally?\n\nIn two years the quality of de-interlacers will presumably also have improved.\n\nWhile your case may be valid for 25p material, it isn't for 50p material!\n\nThis will become a real bone of contention when it eventually kicks in!\n\nThe vertical resolution of 1080/50i, when attempting to transmit and recover 1080/50p originated material, is not equal to 720/50p - and if you think about it, you'll see why.\n\nThe source is 1920x1080 at 50Hz, and your broadcast options are 1920x540 at 50Hz (1080i), and 1280x720 at 50Hz (720p)\n\nThat is an oversimplification though - you may as well say that the current broadcast system is 720x288 at 50Hz - as modern CCD cameras are 50p internally (as are current HDTV CCD cameras) - with line-offset, line averaging used to create the two fields (Average lines 1 & 2, and 3 & 4 for field 1, then lines 2 & 3, and 4 & 5, for field 2)\n\nThe resolution of fast moving information is, agreed, thus 288 lines vertically - but once slower moving stuff gains resolution, and static stuff benefits from approx 75% of that of a progressive system.\n\nI take it you aren't saying that current SD DVD and Broadcast digital video is limited to 288 lines of resolution when showing video sourced material? It seems that you are?\n\nIf you equate this to 1080i, then fast moving information is 540 line resolution vertically, but as stuff slows down it gains vertical resolution, and static stuff (which the eye is more sensitive to) delivers appprox 75% the resolution of a 1080line system - which is approx 750ish. (Very close to 720p)\n\nWith 1080i, for the first i field, you'll be sending only the first p frames odd numbered pixel rows - you can't send it's even numbered rows in the next field, as that field will have to be used for the second p frame's even numbered rows - and so on!! Hence 50% of each frame would have to be discarded, and it's all coming off the resolution in one direction only!\n\nExcept that if you are taking a 50p source and interlacing to 50i for transmission the two fields aren't derived directly from the even and odd rows of the progressive 50p frames. Instead the two 50i fields are derived from BOTH even and odd lines of each 50p frame - you line offset average (as CCD cameras do currently in SD and HD anyway) - so field 1 is derived from both odd and even lines from one 50p frame, whilst field 2 is derived from both odd and even lines from the next 50p frame. The trick is to changes the field/frame line relationship between fields...\n\nWhichever format you choose, you are going to lose approx 50% in spatial resolution for each frame - and that's assuming neither the broadcaster nor the display applies any vertical filtering to the interlaced signal - and they will have to do this!\n\nYou lose a maximum of 50% spatial resolution - but this is only on fast moving elements, as the motion slows you gain more and more spatial resolution, until stuff is static, and you get at least 75% spatial resolution.\n\nField combination at the deinterlacer can't be done (the fields are from different frames) - you'll have to rely on a video mode, and here is where it can so easily all go wrong. You could easily end up with each output 1920x1080 frame having been scaled from each input 1920x540 field (and to allow for deinterlacers which did this, you'd have to vertically filter the interlaced signal to reduce row twitter on horizontal detail). More advanced video mode deinterlacers could attempt to combine the areas of the fields which it thinks haven't changed - but it then depends on how good it is at doing this - even getting it right 99% of the time isn't good enough, as the other 1% of the time you'd have combing artefacts.\n\nSurely the case is the same as with current 576/50i to 576/50p de-interlacing of video material. Some de-interlacers do better than others.\n\nIt would then still have to interpolate the areas which have changed, and final output will again depend on how good it is at doing this!\n\nEven if it's a good one, it's never as good as it needs to be - if it were, we would never need a film mode on deinterlacers (which essentially weave top and bottom fields together from a 50i signal to recreate the original 25p source frames - errors in the cadence and field ID flag errors notwithstanding (although it would still need to be able to deal with these as they occur)).\n\nFor a 1080 display it's then a contest between how well the display's scaler scales downscaled 1280x720 up to 1920x1080, against how well it scales downscaled and filtered 1920x540 up to 1920x1080.\n\nFor a 720p display, the choice would be obvious IMO.\n\nYou're making an assumption that a de-interlacing is going to underperform with regard to a glorified field-replication 540 line solution. Whilst 540 may be used in some US devices - it certainly isn't in use for all of them - and 1080i certainly doesn't underperform with regard to 720p, when both are effectively being fed from 50p sources. (Modern cameras)\n\nHence I think we'll have to agree to disagree again on this point - I think transmission of 1080/50p originated material, would best be served by broadcasting it in 720/50p!\n\nGiven that video material currently is effectively starting as 50p in-camera - I think we have to look at the US - and 1080i isn't deemed as bad as you seem to think.\n\nThe empirical evidence is that 1080i pictures are outperforming 720p sources on pretty much everything? (CBS, NBC and PBS picture quality seems to be gain more praise than ABC and Fox)\n\nFor sports and music shot at 60Hz the video sourced stuff will be starting 60p in camera (Think about how the Philips/Thomson LDK6000 works when it runs in 1080i mode and then how it works in 720p more) and then either broadcast 1080/60i or 720/60p.\n\nAs for summing row pairs, while this may be the method that interlaced cameras use (for a variety of reasons), I'm still not convinced that would be the best way to interlace already existing 1080/50p content.\n\nTake a digitally generated 1920x1080 test signal - 2 progressive frames, of a black and white chequerboard pattern, where every alternate pixel is black or white!\n\nThis pattern represents the maximum detail that can be obtained from a 1920x1080 pixel array! As it's a 50p signal, and we are going to interlace to 50i, we need to maintain a 1:1 temporal relationship, frame to field! (OK in this instance it probably wouldn't matter, as there is no motion, but if you added say a few moving big red dots on top of the chequerboard, it would)\n\nNow average frame 1 lines 1&2, 3&4, 4&5 for field 1 (top field, odd lines) for output lines 1, 3 and 5.\n\nThen average frame 2, 2&3, 4&5, 6&7 for field 2 (bottom field, even lines) for output lines 2, 4 and 6.\n\nYou can bit shift frame/field 2 any way you want - the result is the same!\n\nWon't you end up with a sheet of grey?\n\nFirstly, how is this better than taking all the odd lines from frame 1 to form field 1, and all the even lines from frame 2 to form field 2.\n\nSecondly, how is this better than scaling each frame down to 1280x720?\n\nEven if you weighted the averages, while it would be better, it's still not ideal - not sure if they actually do this though!\n\nI'm theorizing here - I'm not sure how they'd actually interlace 1080/50p content (has it ever been done in practice yet?) - but I wouldn't do it anyway, I'd scale it down to 720/50p, to avoid issues at the receiver end with crappy deinterlacers!\n\nBut let's assume that row pair averaging is what they'll do (and it may well be, I'm not saying it isn't)\n\nYou then state that the maximum detail which can be represented using 1080i is 810 lines (75%), once deinterlaced, and that's only with no motion - add motion and the resolution will vary down to 540 lines! How is this a 1080 line format?\n\nEven then it assumes that no further flicker reduction is applied!\n\nThis also assumes that it will be deinterlaced with a per pixel motion adaptive deinterlacer (at least - per field motion adaptive won't really cut it) - if this is deinterlaced in the way Silicon Optix is suggesting most 1080i deinterlacers are actually doing it (I don't think many plasmas/LCDs will be fitted with Realta HQV chipsets any time soon), then we are down to 540 line resolution max, as it seems each field will simply be scaled back up to 1920x1080!\n\nThis won't recover any resolution though!\n\nIf you used line averaging to form the first field, you'll end up with a sheet of grey - scale this anyway you want, it's still a sheet of grey! If you output field one as just the odd rows, while it would throw away half the resolution, at least the scaled image would more closely resemble the original than a sheet of grey!\n\nStill, it's an interesting topic - and I accept that they don't always do what they lead you believe that they are doing\n\nI still think interlacing is totally outdated, and is unnecessary these days.\n\nDVD was perhaps the last format which needed it (simply because it was designed to drive interlaced CRT sets).\n\nIf you took a 1080/25p film, you can encode it and either send a repeat last frame flag, or else just send a token P or B frame (in MP2 terminology). No extra bitrate required!\n\nThere's no need to interlace it in the first place (especially as the vast majority of HDTV sets in the UK will be progressive displays). Even if they did, they should do it in a psF manner!\n\nHere's a couple of quotes from IBC2004\n\n\"If we adopt 720p, we do HDTV without compromising quality. Interlace is not consistent or compatible with modern displays, said Mike Croll, head of the image unit at BBC R&D, and co-author of the B/TQE paper presented at IBC. You'd have to de-interlace 1080i for this new generation of progressive displays and that would be expensive.\n\nProgressive scanning also gains 20-30% in compression coding efficiency over interlace in transmission.\n\nAnd one from Yves Faroudja (and I suspect he knows a thing or two)\n\nWhy are we still talking about using interlace? This is something Ive been dealing with for decades and I cant believe were still considering it in the 21st century, he said. Im a complete enemy of interlace. There are some things in an interlaced picture that you just cant de-interlace. When TV began it was a very simple way of reducing bandwidth, but now it is not needed. Im very depressed when every ten years I see people about to make the same mistakes.\n\nSony, not surprsingly, take a different view - whether the failure to mention interlace is intentional or not, I don't know\n\n\"1920 X 1080 is the worldwide common image format and is the production format the majority of producers are using. When you've produced in 1080, the last thing you want to do is take it back down to 720 for transmission, and take it back up again to 1080 in the display,\" said John Ive, director of strategic planning for Sony Professional Solutions Europe. \"All the consumer manufacturers have committed to standardizing on 1080, and DVDs will use this format,\" he added. \"Satellite broadcasters now proposing HD services are very likely to choose 1080. It would be a marketing nightmare if several years later, when consumers are used to 1920 X 1080 displays, public broadcasters come along and say they're going to do 720.\"\n\nI'm pretty much with the EBU personally - use 720p at first and migrate to 1080 only when we can deliver it in progressive form (but with a bit of jiggery pokery, I believe they could deliver 1080/25p from day one, or at least 1080/25psF).\n\nOthers may disagree, and they are entitled to - I just find it a little odd that 1080i video is touted as a higher resolution format than 720p - when they both deliver around the same pixel rate, 720p has no deinterlacing issues, and has potentially more efficient codability!\n\nOne further issue which hasn't been mentioned, is that many displays won't take a 1080p input at present (they should have made this part of the HD Ready standard) - which pretty much precludes the use of an external 1080i deinterlacer - and forces you to use whatever deinterlacer the display manufacturer has given you!\n\nBut c'est la vie, as they say!"
