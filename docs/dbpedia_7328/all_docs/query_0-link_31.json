        "text": "This solution is designed to assist if it takes a long time for the picture to appear, the TV becomes locked up or unresponsive, the audio is intermittent or drops out, or the picture gets distorted momentarily when changing channels or inputs.\n\nIt is normal that it can take up to 5 seconds to display the picture when changing channels or changing inputs. There can be a slightly longer delay when changing to and from an input connected with an HDMIÂ® cable.\n\nIf you are using a cable or satellite box, it may take in excess of 5 seconds and the picture may momentarily distort or flash when changing channels, especially when you are tuning between a high definition and standard definition channel.\n\nIt is recommended to fix the format to 1080i resolution on your cable or satellite box. This way the cable or satellite box does not need to switch formats between channels. Channel change time may be improved and you may eliminate the momentary flashes and distortions.\n\nOn your cable or satellite box you may be able to press a button on the front panel to select only 1080i resolution. It may be necessary to fix the format from your cable or satellite box menu to 1080i resolution by accessing the MENU or SETTINGS on the cable or satellite box remote control or front panel of your cable or satellite box. The Output Resolution Format can typically be found under Settings, Options, Preferences, TV Options, Display or another similarly named location in these menus.\n\nIMPORTANT:\n\nGiven the large variety of cable and satellite boxes currently available, the specific procedure to access these settings might vary. If you are unable to locate these settings in your particular cable or satellite box, please contact your service provider.\n\nAvoid using Variable, Auto Select, 4:3 Override or Native modes on cable or satellite boxes because the output resolution format may change each time you change channels, resulting in excessive channel change time or momentary flashes or distortions.\n\nNOTE: Instead of using an HDMI cable, another method would be to use a Component Video (RGB) cable to connect with a cable or satellite box. The quality of the picture will be the same as the HDMI connection. But, separate audio cables are required for sound.\n\nTroubleshooting and additional information:"
