        "text": "DM NVX® technology transports ultra high‑definition 4K60 4:4:4 video over standard Gigabit Ethernet with no perceptible latency or loss of quality. Using standard network switches and CAT5e UTP wiring, a DM NVX system delivers a high‑performance virtual matrix routing solution that is economically advantageous and infinitely scalable for any enterprise or campus‑wide 4K content distribution application. Professional onboard scaling, High Dynamic Range support (HDR10), and HDCP 2.2 compliance ensure the ultimate in picture quality and compatibility for all of today’s varied media sources.1, 2\n\nThe DM‑NVX‑350 is a compact AV over IP encoder/decoder designed to function as either a transmitter or receiver. Capable of handling a network AV installation of any size, the DM‑NVX‑350 includes features such as secure web‑based control and management, auto‑switching HDMI® inputs, a scaling HDMI output, video wall processing, an analog audio input or output, native AES67 transmit and receive capability, USB 2.0 and KVM integration, and support for copper and fiber Ethernet connectivity.2,3\n\nReal‑Time 4K60 Video Distribution\n\nEngineered for demanding conference room and classroom applications, DM NVX technology ensures real‑time, full‑motion 4K60 video performance for the presentation of multimedia, videoconferencing, and live camera images. Interactive functions such as gameplay and the use of a mouse are fluid and natural.\n\nA DM NVX system is engineered for stability and reliability. Line‑synchronized outputs ensure perfect synchronization of content across multiple displays for applications such as digital signage and video walls. Variable Multicast TTL (Time To Live) enables traversing multiple network routers for optimal flexibility.\n\nPixel Perfect Processing Technology\n\nA DM NVX system incorporates Pixel Perfect Processing technology, which provides flawless video transport in all applications. Depending on the operating mode, the DM‑NVX‑350 can encode or decode a video signal to achieve imperceptible end-to-end latency of less than 1 frame. The image quality of the source is maintained across a 1-Gigabit network at any resolution up to 4K60 4:4:4.\n\nEnterprise‑Grade Security\n\nUsing advanced security features and protocols such as 802.1X authentication, Active Directory® credential management, AES-128 content encryption, PKI authentication, TLS, SSH, and HTTPS, a DM NVX system delivers a true enterprise‑grade network AV solution engineered to fulfill demanding IT policies.\n\nEncoder or Decoder Functionality\n\nThe DM‑NVX‑350 is configurable to operate as either a network AV encoder or decoder:\n\nAs an encoder, the DM‑NVX‑350 allows the HDMI signal of a laptop computer, camera, or other media source to be transmitted over the network to one or many decoders.1\n\nAs a decoder, the DM‑NVX‑350 receives the signal from a DM NVX encoder and feeds it to a display device via the HDMI output. The decoder can quickly and easily switch between multiple encoders on the network alongside locally connected HDMI sources.1\n\nThe DM‑NVX‑350 provides a versatile, cost‑effective solution for applications that require encoder and decoder operating modes in a single device. The operating mode can be reconfigured dynamically in less than 1 minute via a control system or web browser or can be changed by using the onboard Setup button.\n\nAuto-Switching HDMI® Inputs\n\nThe DM‑NVX‑350 includes two HDMI inputs. Switching between the two inputs can be performed automatically using auto‑switching mode, programmatically via a control system, manually using the onboard Input Select button, or through a computer using a web browser. When used as a decoder mounted behind a typical conference room display device, the HDMI inputs provide a convenient way to connect a Crestron AirMedia® presentation gateway, videoconferencing codec, or small form factor computer.1\n\nHDMI Output with 4K60 4:4:4 Scaler\n\nWhen the DM‑NVX‑350 is configured as a decoder, the HDMI output feeds the decoded signal to the HDMI input of a local display device, switcher, or other equipment. The built‑in scaler ensures an optimal image, scaling the encoded source resolution up or down to match the native resolution of the display device. When the DM‑NVX‑350 is configured as an encoder, the HDMI output can be used to feed a local display, confidence monitor, or audio system.1, 4\n\nVideo Wall Processing\n\nA video wall composed of up to 64 individual displays can be configured using multiple DM NVX endpoints. Each endpoint provides fully adjustable zoom capability and bezel compensation to accommodate a range of video wall configurations and display types. One DM NVX endpoint is required per display, supporting configurations of up to eight wide by eight high.\n\nDynamic Text Overlay\n\nThe DM-NVX-350 enables the display of dynamic text, providing a means to label the video source or to display special instructions, schedules, announcements, alerts, and other messaging.\n\nImage Preview\n\nImage preview provides still images (thumbnails) that show the current video being received by an input of a DM NVX encoder or displayed by an output of a DM NVX decoder. Still images are shown at 1 frame per second. Image preview supports the maximum resolution of the source and scales the image while maintaining the aspect ratio. Images can be previewed in the DM NVX web interface and accessed remotely using a web browser. The images can also be previewed on a Crestron touch screen or third-party interface.\n\nBackground Image for On-Screen Display\n\nWhen the DM-NVX-350 is configured as a decoder, an image can be uploaded to the device for use as a background image on a display whenever active video content is not being displayed. Supported image file types are .jpeg, .jpg, and .png. The supported maximum resolution of an image is 3840x2160 pixels. Up to 20 image files can be uploaded for a total storage capacity of up to 100 MB.\n\nTest Pattern Generator\n\nWhen the DM-NVX-350 is configured as an encoder, the built-in test pattern generator can be used during setup to ensure that video streaming is functional. The test pattern generator can also be used as a tool for the adjustment, calibration, and alignment of displays, projectors, and video walls. The DM NVX encoder can send the test pattern to any routed DM NVX decoder.\n\nFixed, Adaptive, or Variable Bit Rate\n\nIn DM NVX encoder mode, the bit rate of a stream can be set to fixed, adaptive, or variable:\n\nA fixed bit rate, also referred to as Constant Bit Rate (CBR), is user specified and can be set to a value ranging from 200 Mbps to 950 Mbps.5\n\nAdaptive bit rate (ABR) enables the encoder to automatically set a fixed bit rate based on the input resolution of the stream. For example, the adaptive bit rate for a common resolution such as 1920x1080p@60Hz (1080p60) would automatically be set to 400 Mbps. Adaptive bit rate makes better use of the available bandwidth than a user-specified fixed bit rate.\n\nVariable bit rate (VBR) enables the encoder to automatically vary the bit rate based on the content and input resolution of the stream. The bit rate can vary from less than 150 Mbps to a maximum of 750 Mbps. A variable bit rate results in the use of less bandwidth to produce the same image quality as a user-specified fixed bit rate or an adaptive bit rate."
