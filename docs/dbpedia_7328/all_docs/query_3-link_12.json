        "text": "As far as I can work out from browsing the net, opinions are divided as to 720p in HD televisions and 1080i.\n\nWhen you buy an HD television, are you stuck with whatever standard the TV manufacturer has decided to adopt, or are there some televisons which will allow you to choose your preferred viewing mode.\n\nNo, because it wouldn't do anything, apart from adding extra conversion stages, and then converting it back again.\n\nYou're really over thinking this\n\nThe technika HD (Tesco) digibox that I have offers a choice in its menus as to what sort of television set you have, so couldn't the set itself be alternatively configured by menu selection?\n\nIf a cheap box can do this, why can't a TV set also offer different options.\n\nBecause there would be no point - the original signal sets the picture resolution, and the TV physical screen resolution sets the displayed resolution - that's all there is.\n\nAnd what about the broadcast signal itself? If no broadcaster sends out a higher standard than 1080i, what is the advantage of paying extra for a 1080p TV set.\n\nI get the impression the 720p TV sets are the cheapest. No?\n\nThat are almost no 720P TV's, and hardly ever have been - most HD Ready TV's are 768 pixel.\n\n1080P is the same resolution as 1080i anyway, the advantage of a 1080P set is that you can watch BD in progressive mode - but it's a VERY small advantage anyway..\n\nAlso, since I will probably be buying a 32\" set only, would I be able to notice a difference with the higher no. of pixels that a 1080 set offers?\n\nAlmost certainly not, and a decent quality HD Ready TV will give a far better picture than a cheap Full HD one.\n\n0\n\nThe ZDF HD channels on 19E are 720p. I have been told these are 25fps but I'm not convinced.\n\nBBCi player HD is 720p25. The whole point of 720p50 is the reduced motion artefacting from the increased frame rate compensates for the lower resolution.\n\nSome HD games for the PS3 and Xbox360 are 720p60\n\nI should have said no broadcaster broadcasting in English to the UK uses 720p50.\n\nIn any case if you view it on a 768 line display and a 1080 line one you won't see much if any difference.\n\n0\n\nI know from ripping video that 720p ends up a lot bigger than 1080i.\n\nAlso in most instances I think 1080i looks better too.\n\nEvidently I would rather everything in 1080p\n\nWhere did you get the 720p from, it may just be using a much higher source bitrate or isn't compressed with h264/AVC (ie less compression than would be used for a broadcast source HD source).\n\nAlso depends on what you are starting from, and what encoder settings are bring used. On it's own stating 720p comes out larger than 1080i is meaningless.\n\nYou have to compare like with like. A 720P broadcast source would use a similar bitrate to a 1080i transmission. If you record a Virgin 1080i cable source the file will be much bigger than a 1080i satellite source (Virgin uses mpeg2 compression).\n\nIf a take a 1080i 17Mbps file from my HD camcorder and encode it to 720p50 and use the same bitrate the file is the same size whatever codec you use. mpeg2 would be crap, AVCHD would be hard to tell the difference. Reducing the bitrate to say 12Mbps and recoding the original content using AVCHD. The results would again be very similar.\n\n0\n\n720 is siginificantly better resolution than the 500 (approx) lines usa sd standard from their analogue system. but not than the european 600 line sd system.\n\np avoids interlace juddering. at the expense of twice as many frames! so obviously needs bit more data than 1080i.\n\nim not really convinced about non interlace being better for sports! since when something is moving it's blurred in any case .......\n\n...true with fast moving or panning but not when it transitions to slow - and then it is very noticeable.\n\nThere is a 10% overhead for interlacing - and 1080p50 is pretty well the same bandwidth as 1080i50 with up to date technology - there is now little advantage in 720p50 and 1080i50 - except of course we are lumbered with them as 1080p50 is not in the broadcast standard !!!\n\nFreeview HD can of course slip into 1080p25 when appropriate - but that is no good for sport.\n\nWe have a 42\" full HD TV and 720p50 doesn't look too bad - but IMHO it doesn't give the \"wow\" of good quality 1080 of any sort - but then again good quality 1080 is not that common !\n\nAs far as what you output from a box - the broadcast input is 1080 - and the TV has been designed to display the input on its display - so rely on the TV to convert to the display resolution.\n\nUnfortunately the HD SatBox I have will not pass through the broadcast resolution automatically and it will upscale 720p to 1080i unless you hand switch it (through 576i and 576p) to 720p. This seems to be a common (and IMHO) stupid feature of many SatBoxes.\n\n0"
