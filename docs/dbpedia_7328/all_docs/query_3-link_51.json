        "text": "Before there was HDR10 vs. Dolby Vision\n\nBefore there was Blu-Ray vs. HD-DVD\n\nIn the early days of HD, people argued about...... 1080i vs. 720p.\n\nI was reminded of this based on the gaming side thread about 4k vs 2160p or 2160c or whatever. It just made me think about how far we've come from arguing about the original HD formats.\n\nI'm assuming everyone here is aware of how the two formats work, so I won't go into that. However, people really did argue about this. Now, the team you played for was essentially based on what TV technology you owned (sounds familiar). If you had an HD CRT, as I did, you were team 1080i. If you had an LCD, you were team 720p.\n\nObviously now, these are both inferior to 1080p or UHD, but all broadcast channels are still based on these formats and, due to bandwidth, will be for the foreseeable future. And of course, even cheap modern TVs are generally at least 1080p (you can still find a few super cheapo 720p TVs out there, but it's not common). So, how do we evaluate these?\n\nOverall Pixels\n\nIf you are doing pure math, 720p/60 will give you more pixels per second than 1080i/60 will.\n\nCross-format conversion\n\nDespite our self-centered viewpoints, the real answer was that the format native to your TV was the best. But, given that all things are not equal, we had to deal with non-native formats. Now, a few of the earliest 1080i TVs didn't support 720p signals at all. So, one could argue that the only true \"universal\" HD format is 1080i.\n\nStill, most decent TVs took both signals. 720p to 1080i usually worked fairly well, even before modern post-processing. 1080i to 720p was a mixed bag. If I remember correctly, the cheapest of cheap TVs would simply take each 540 field and upscale it to 720p. A higher quality TV would de-interlace the 1080i signal, then downscale to 720p. While the latter is far superior, I feel like either way, you're worse off going from 1080i -> 720p than the other way around.\n\nMotion\n\nThis is where the 720p crowd really dug in. While at any given moment, you would have 1920x1080 unique pixels in a 1080i signal, because of interlacing, you would experience artifacting in motion. Particularly, in vertical motion, you would have a significant decrease in perceived resolution.\n\nHowever, there are mitigating factors here, both then and now.\n\nAt the time, the argument about motion could almost be completely nullified by the fact that LCD response time in the early to mid-2000s was terrible by today's standards. Any advantage of the video format as it pertains to motion was more than offset by the LCD blur imposed by the technology of the time. And, once you convert the 720 to 1080i, then you're simply subject to 1080i's disadvantages, but with less source pixels.\n\nThese days, with 1080p TVs being the minimum standard, the question is whether an upscaled 720p is better than a de-interlaced 1080i signal. I'm sure someone with more technical knowledge can give a better technical answer, but from what I know, de-interlacing techniques have improved significantly since the mid-2000s. Anecdotally, I can say that NBC and CBS football broadcasts (1080i) look way better on a 1080p/4k TV than FOX or ESPN (720p), and sports is the scenario that was always touted as the advantage for 720p.\n\nFilm content\n\nThis is where 1080i wins in a landslide. Now that 1080p (or higher) TVs are normal and film content detection is a fairly standard feature, any 1080i signal derived from film content should be able to be de-interlaced to a proper 1080p picture. That same content in 720p would offer a soft upscale to 1080p.\n\nSo, who wants to argue with an HD-CRT 1080i warrior from 2006?"
