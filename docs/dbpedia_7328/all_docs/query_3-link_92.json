        "text": "Recently, I got a VISIO HDTV. ALong with that I got a Comcast HD box, which went into the HDMI cable.\n\nI want to \"square\" the picture sometimes, so imstead of it being stretched, it would be centered, with black bars on the left and right. Thus giving each of the 4 sides an equal length, and the illusion of a square picture.\n\nI'm pretty dumb at explaining this, but does anyone get what I'm trying to do?? And for the record, I can't get it squared up with either the TV remote or HD cable remote. Help!\n\nWhen I'm watching DVD's (AV input), the \"WIDE\" button gives me the option for \"Normal\", which is exacly what I want. But when I'm on the HDMI input, I don't get the option for \"Normal\", only Full, Zoom 1, Zoom 2. It's kind of odd, I just want to go back to a 4:3, or square picture when I am watching older shows....why can't they just make things easy?\n\nWhen you say \"shows\" you mean content coming from your Comcast HD box? If so, there is a picture setting within the Comcast box that allows you to pick how you want a 4x3 480i image to be output. The choices will be called something like Full/stretched or Normal (which will be gray or black bars on the sides).\n\nAh I see. The reason for this is that 720p/1080i/1080p output is always 16:9, so your source device is stretching the image to 16:9 and then the TV is only giving you 16:9 signal options.\n\nThe solution is to find an option on your source device (BD player/HDTV box) to change the output mode for 4:3 material so that it pillarboxes to 16:9 instead. Take a look in the video settings.\n\nI will try to do this later...what a simple and logical explanation. Thanks!\n\nExpanding on this, my DirecTV receivers have the ability to output a channel's native format or force a change to a specific format. They can also do a test to see which formats your TV supports. So, I use native to output 480i, 720p or 1080i depending on channel. You may want to check whether your Comcast receiver has a similar function, and whether it is forcing a change to 720p or 1080i which usually cannot be 'zoomed' using the TV controls as DragonQ points out.\n\nI can see that it is always set at 720p, so I will have to find a way to change it through the HD box.\n\nI took a quick look at Comcast's FAQ section and they mention a Native mode for their HD DVR that is exactly as I described. Refer to your user manual to see where in the setup menu you can change this. It should solve your problem.\n\nBkack Elk got it right... Native mode has to be set on. And make sure you are watching HD channels. Some stations like TBS automatically stretched their programming so there is absolutely nothing you can do about that.\n\nCabe box should be set to your HDTV spec... if you are only good for 720P, then set it to 720P only... don't allow other modes (480i/480P/1080i). And the view screen should be set to 16:9.\n\nThe way to test this out is that not all the programming is in 16:9 format... like a lot of commercials so you should see 4:3 format in those instance.\n\nMost widescreen TVs until a couple of years ago were set up to stretch 4:3 to 16:9 by default. It looks so bad, I can't understand what compels people to choose such a setting. I guess the manufacturers were originally scared that people would complain that the whole screen wasn't being filled and prevent widescreen TV from getting off the ground. However, that excuse stopped being sensible nearly 10 years ago and yet they persisted until fairly recently (I think it was around the time that TVs began to feature built-in Freeview tuners).\n\nI prefer the 'stretching' of 4:3 screens to 16:9.\n\nCall me crazy, but i prefer it.\n\nMy only issue is for a very few DVDs I wind up with a 'doubling' of the bands top and bottom. And cannot clear it to be a normal 16:9 picture. So in 16:9 it looks like a 16:3 squeeze.\n\nI can do a zoom to fix it, but lose a lot of picture to do it.\n\nIt seems to be a fault of the DVD, as only a few early production DVDs do it.\n\nNext TV I buy will have options to change ratio in more complex ways..\n\nI am tired of the limits my current (old) HDTV Plasma can alter the incoming ratios.\n\nOne big pet peeve is PBS which seems to decide to squeeze a lot of 16:9 into a 4:3 screen with sidebars (and thus top and bottom bars) for what reason.. is totally unknown.\n\nA Mystery to me. Do they save bandwidth? somehow.. or just some insane notion only people with 4:3 tvs watch those programs??\n\nI can't imagine any BDs being 4:3 letterboxed so it sounds like your BD output is set incorrectly. Make sure the output in the settings is set to 1080p (or whatever your TV supports) and 16:9.\n\nIf you like people with wide bodies and faces, than stretch-o-vision is for you!\n\nI've got one disk that actually does that (Alfred Hitchcock Collection 'Psycho'). It's a widescreen image matted to 4:3 ratio. So black bars at top, bottom and both sides. My zoom modes do a zoom/stretch, so it never looks right. I think the disk is just authored wonky (none of the other DVDs from that collection do that).\n\nIf you're seeing that on several disks, including blu-rays though, it must be a setup issue. I'd look at the TV options menu AND the blu-ray player options menu for screen size/preferences and make sure they're both set for a widescreen tv.\n\nYes. You want the correct aspect ratio instead of Stretch-O-Vision. Unfortunately, some makes of TVs make it hard for you to do that.\n\nI wish there were two ratios of \"Zoom\" instead of just one on my Panny...while I find \"Zoom\" fits the bill when many SD channels run the HD picture in a smaller size, I also get the impression I'm missing a bit of the picture because it zooms too far in. Perhaps if there were a less-comprehensive \"Zoom\" setting, there would be just enough black space around the edge for me to be sure I'm not losing anything.\n\nAlso, either my local FiOS feed, or the local Fox affiliate, or the Fox network itself, has begun squeezing the whole HD picture into a skinny-vision pic for their SD feed. Now, I like this, because I can use my \"Just\" setting and get a widescreen pic from a smaller file off my DVR, but I feel for those still tethered to their SD sets, who have to suffer through that picture just because they don't choose to pony-up for HDTV. It's kind of like the water company saying everybody paying for \"city water\" has to take it brown and grimy because they're not using a more expensive filtering system.\n\nNow playing on Ariel Stream: Nickel Creek - Out Of The Woods\n\nMy LG HDTV has a \"horizon\" mode that does something similar to that. I still prefer 4:3 with pillar boxing to that."
