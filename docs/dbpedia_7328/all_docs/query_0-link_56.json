        "text": "There are a couple of factors that can cause the picture to appear this way. Depending on what you are watching, the issue could be caused by either the TV or the signal source (cable/satellite set-top box, DVD player, or digital video recorder). Each one of these devices may have a ZOOM / WIDE option or aspect ratio control that can adjust the size of the picture being shown on the screen.\n\nIMPORTANT: If model-specific information is required to complete any of the steps in this solution, refer to the operating instructions supplied with the product. Manuals are posted on your model support page.\n\nFollow the steps below to troubleshoot this issue.\n\nCheck the TV to see if it has a ZOOM / WIDE option or control for adjusting the aspect ratio; if so, try setting it to NORMAL.\n\nNOTES:\n\nIf there is a SCREEN MODE button on the TV remote control, you can press this button until NORMAL is selected.\n\nSome TVs have a Vertical Center or V Center option in the menu that will allow the position of the picture to be moved up or down on the screen.\n\nSome TVs do not have the capability of changing the aspect ratio when a 720P or 1080i signal is being received.\n\nIf using a cable/satellite set-top box, DVD player or digital video recorder, check the device for aspect ratio controls and try selecting a different display option.\n\nNOTES:\n\nIf necessary, contact the instruction manual or manufacturer of your cable/satellite set-top box, DVD player or digital video recorder for assistance.\n\nIn most instances, this issue can be resolved by completing one or both of the steps above. However, there are other situations that can cause this issue. If the issue has still not been resolved, continue with the troubleshooting steps below.\n\nRemove any Extended Data Services (XDS) or Closed Captioned (CC) information from the screen.\n\nPerform a power reset .\n\nChange the channel to see if the issue occurs on other stations and programs; the issue could be with the signal being broadcast.\n\nNOTES:\n\nThe top or bottom of the screen may be covered with banners or tickers when watching some news programs.\n\nThe program you are watching may be broadcast or recorded in an aspect ratio that will not fit your screen properly.\n\nChange the video input on the TV and try playing a different video source (such as a VCR) to determine if the issue occurs with other connected devices.\n\nCheck the TV menu; if the issue is also affecting the TV menu, then the TV may require service.\n\nThe troubleshooting steps listed above should resolve your issue. If you have completed all of the steps and the issue is not resolved, service may be required. &nbspGo to Product Repair.&nbsp"
