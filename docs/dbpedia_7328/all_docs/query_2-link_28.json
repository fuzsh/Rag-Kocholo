The problem with DVDs is that\n\nthe proper flags aren't always used.\n\nIf you start with 60fps material, then 720p will work better for motion.\n\nIf you start with 24fps material (most scripted stuff), 1080i or 1080p\n\n(depending upon display) is a better match. 720p is silly for 24fps\n\nmaterial, with no advantages.\n\nIf you start with 'video look', then it is best to match the recording\n\nstandards, where 1080i is probably the best all around except for motion,\n\nand does give the best video look. For sports or scientific work (where\n\nfreeze frame is a primarily used feature), then 720p can be useful.\n\nOne more note: for broadcast HDTV, 1080i is a tight fit. High motion\n\nand 1080i is a disaster sometimes, but not because of 1080i encoding\n\nitself on the ATSC channel. It is because of the all-too-common\n\nsubchannels that force the 1080i to fit in 15mpbs.... That is very\n\nmarginal for 1080i. This gives a double bonus for sports on 720p60,\n\nwhere it tends to fit into the ATSC channel, even with a subchannel\n\nor two.\n\nJohn\n\nArchived from groups: alt.tv.tech.hdtv (More info?)\n\nIn article <c7eeo5$1kae$2@news.iquest.net>, toor@iquest.net says...\n\n> It bothers me that the TV stations/networks don't use 1080p24 more often\n\n> for their playout.\n\nIt bothers me as well. 1080/24p is the best of the HDTV formats now\n\navailable, not only because of it's resolution advantages, but also\n\nbecause it has lessor bandwidth requirements. It is also more elegantly\n\nmanipulable for special effects during the post production process. And\n\nfinally, it more easily converted to the other formats in use around the\n\nworld: (Europe's proposed 1080/25p and 1080/50i, along with existing PAL\n\n50i.)\n\nSome cable networks are considering 1080/24p as a transmission format:\n\nA&E is one such network, for its History Channel and other offerings.

Sony was grossly\n\nbehind the technology curve when these decisions were made, but the\n\ncompany can be quite stubborn about these things.

I haven't seen any yet. But from my own experience\n\nwith computers, 72 frames per second seems to be a display rate that\n\nsatisfies a greater number of viewers than does 60.\n\nArchived from groups: alt.tv.tech.hdtv (More info?)\n\n\"toto\" <toto.15uyby@news.satelliteguys.us> wrote in message\n\nnews:toto.15uyby@news.satelliteguys.us...\n\n>\n\n> Mark, the first response was the best suggestion.

The luma will be\n\nresolution limited by the display device, but the chroma can be displayed at\n\nnearly its full resolution on even a 480-line display.\n\nUsually scaling a high-res signal down isn't too much of a problem (with\n\nappropriate filtering), but scaling a lower-resolution signal up often leads\n\nto obvious problems."
