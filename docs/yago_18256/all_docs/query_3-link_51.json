        "text": "I am originally from Guatemala but Tallahassee is my home now. I went to FSU where I met my husband. We have two wonderful kids, Bianca and RG who are the love of my life.\n\nAt home, I like to read, garden and do \"DIY\" projects for my house. When I am not playing \"Bob the builder\", I spend most of my time in my new art studio. I finally have a place where I can feel creative and work on my own work!!!!!!.\n\nI like to travel and learn about people's cultures and traditions."
