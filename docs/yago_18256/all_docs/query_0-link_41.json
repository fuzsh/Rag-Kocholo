Big Worm, as I knew him. Brandon was a good person with a great big heart. I met him at Eat-n-Park the summer of my freshman year in college. We thought we knew things about computers, full of tween incompetence, we hammered away and had a blast. I remember our adventure to New York City for HOPE, Hackers On Planet Earth, a computer conference we barely made it to, and subsequently back from. On the few dollars we had in our pockets, we spent two days in Manhattan. What a trip. Brandon once took me out during the Perseid meteor showers one August. Middle of the night and that dude said, ‘Yo, Jim, let’s check out the showers, man’. So we drove back beyond Cannell drive, way into the country, to get some dark skies. To this day, the best meteor showers I’ve seen. And I’ve been to Yosemite a few times. I’ll never forget that. We had a good many adventures. A good number of laughs, and scares. He and I were driving to PennState one night to hang out and get a few drinks. There was a car in front that wiped out on this strip of back road. We didn’t hesitate to get out and see if everyone was alright. It was this old drunk guy, with beer cans falling out of his car. I called the police and Brandon helped the guy sit and wait. I was walking across the road and Brandon started shouting at me to jump. You see, a car, blinded by the headlights of both my car and the wrecked car, came zooming past. As Brandon yelled, I jumped. I had no idea what was going on but the passenger mirror of the flying car swiped my backside. I fell into a ditch and stood up. I’ll never forget that either. He took command of the situation and all parties involved waited calmly for the police to arrive. He had a personality that was just, better. I never knew him to be malicious, or callous, or spiteful. Though I hadn’t spoken to Brandon in many years, I find myself tearing up at his loss. When two people meet, no matter the duration, they walk awa! y, like any chemical reaction, forever changed. It’s like being bounded by gravity. To Brandon’s children, know that your father had a soul and heart that few ever possess, and most never understand. He was smart, he was good. He had his faults, like we all do. But I remember a guy that had big dreams and a big heart, and a big laugh. I can only hope to be as good a person as I remembered him being. A far better person, into a far grander cosmos. He will be sorely missed. Farewell Big Worm, say hi to the great hacker in the sky for me mate. Catch you at the end of the universe. I hear Milliways has a great breakfast.
