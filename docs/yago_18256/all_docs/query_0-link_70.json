        "text": "Don’t see your class here? Send news via email or mail to your class correspondent, or to Classnotes.editor@unh.edu, or mail: UNH Magazine, 9 Edgewood Road, Durham, NH 03824.\n\nFollow\n\nFollow\n\nFollow\n\n1949\n\nDo you remember how we did laundry at UNH in the ’40s? There were no washing machines or dryers in the dorms or frat houses and no laundromats in Durham. The girl’s bathrooms had six or eight wooden dryer racks. We washed small things in the sinks. Anyone who couldn’t get home on the weekend had a laundry case. It was made of a durable, weather-resistant cardboard that was held together with rivets and a leather strap with a buckle to fasten. I still have mine; it is 77 years old. I have not used it since 1949, though it did hold up carrying my sheets, towels, wash cloths and pajamas. My memory is that it only cost $1.50 to mail it home to Yonkers, New York. Mom would turn the address card over and send everything back clean from the laundry service. My parents, both high school teachers, (Dad was UNH class of 1920) didn’t have a washing machine. No one had a dryer. Clothes lines were a “must.” On the last pages of every UNH Magazine you will find the names of UNHers, who have passed away in the last two years, listed by class year. I was saddened to see the name of my friend, Barbara Conner French ’48, in the winter issue; she died on April 20, 2021. She accomplished many good things to help children, her local community and the state of New Hampshire in her 95 years of life. Barbara was born in Norwood, Massachusetts, and moved to Henniker as a young adult, and stayed there from then on. After UNH she earned a B.S.N. and M.Ed. She was a child welfare social worker at the N.H. Department of Welfare and a school nurse at Rundlett Junior High in Concord from 1963 to 1990. In retirement, Barbara served 20 years in the state legislature representing both Bradford and Henniker. She was a sponsor or cosigner of many bills signed into law, especially involving the health and well-being of children, the environment and economic justice. She received many awards including the first Barbara French School Health Advocacy Award in 2016 by the New Hampshire School Nurse Association. In Henniker, Barbara was on the Recycling and Energy Committee as a very strong advocate for world peace. She sang for 60 years in the Henniker Congregational Choir. Barbara had a son, Michael, and a daughter, Susan. Michael was the father of her two grandchildren, Johan and Maddie. She also enjoyed her great grandchildren. Barbara loved relaxing and spending time with her growing family in her 1940s-era cottage on Lake Massasecum. Irwin, “Win” Wood passed away in November 2022. His hometown was Concord. After serving in the Army Air Corps in World War II, he earned his bachelor’s and master’s from UNH in zoology. He worked as a scientist for a pharmaceutical company and graduated with a Ph.D. in veterinary parasitology from Kansas State University. As a senior research fellow, he had more than 30 patents and publications in animal parasitology, some of which are still being used today. Win was an avid sailor, placing second in class in the Marion Bermuda Yacht Race. With his wife, Barbara, he traveled to many places around the globe. They had two sons, Jonathan and Peter. Dick Dart, our fellow class president, will reach 98 years young in late August. He was regularly sending emails with photos and unusual happenings, exotic places, or even funny jokes and cartoons from around the world to his many friends. He has put technology to the side; however, a card or note is always welcome to be sent to his home where he resides with his daughter Debbie and her husband at 2865 Mill Wood Lane, Blacksburg, VA 24060. Dick visits a nearby aquatic center with his good friend, Joe, five days per week to takes walks in the water. Dick lived and also taught school for many years in Berlin, Connecticut, before retiring with his wife, Beverly, to Virginia. He continues to cheer for the UConn women’s basketball as well as the men’s and women’s basketball teams at UNH. He also cheered for the Virginia Tech women’s basketball this year when they made it to the “Final 4.” Remember, Dick was captain of the UNH winning basketball team in 1949. Don Bent ’48 ’53G will be 98 in November. His address is Sunapee Cove 1250 Route 11 in Sunapee, NH 03782. Don especially enjoys his moving pictures on a small screen of his four adorable great-grandchildren, the growing up stages of his three children, Susie, Doug and Cindy (who are all UNHers), as well as his lively four married grandkids and the many enjoyable activities he and his wife, Nancy, have had over the years. He still has his strong singing voice, often amusing all with his great memory of old, yet timeless, college songs.\n\nJoan Lamson ’49 replicates her 40s look, complete with her laundry case.\n\nDIRTY LAUNDRY\n\n“Do you remember how we did laundry at UNH in the ’40s?” asks class correspondent for the class of 1949 Joan Boodey Lamson. “There were no washing machines or dryers in the dorms or frat houses and no laundromats in Durham.” See how this chore got done, and what role that suitcase played in the whole thing in Joan’s class column.\n\n1951\n\nMichalena (Micki) Medzela Krupa writes: “Living six miles from the UNH campus at Coppal House Farm on Route 155 in Lee. I’ve got an in-law setup with farm owner and daughter Carole Krupa Hutton ’85. Aggy UNHers here: farm hands, volunteers, farm manager Meghan Boucher Kelly ’09. Nonagenarians of ’51 have an open invite to the farm. Be good, do good; stay in touch!”\n\n1953\n\nA future mechanical engineer is student Brian Truong ’26 of Salem, thanks to your dollars in our endowed scholarship fund. A Christmas card from Nancy Guay Spencer in Oregon said she’s given up driving but is still going to the local museum to archive new material. Jean Stockwell Strong, who’s also given up driving, says she’s fit and fine. Prudence (Prue) Fitzgibbon Aarts, (English Lit, Chi O) died August 20, 2022. After raising two sons and two daughters, Prue earned a master’s in library science at Pratt Institute and became a librarian and media science expert (1972-1998) for the Bedford (New York) school district. After retirement she moved to Madison, Connecticut, where she was an active volunteer in several organizations. Psychology major and Phi Mu Delta member Donald Leavitt died December 10, 2022, in Avon, Connecticut. After U.S. Air Force duty, he had a lengthy and successful career in the paper and packaging industry, living in Concord, Newton, Connecticut, and Lehigh Acres, Florida. An avid tennis player, he also loved to travel. He leaves five children, 14 grands and six great-grands. A celebration of life was planned for June 3 in Lancaster for “Doc” Elwin Falkenham, who for years tended to patients in that community. At UNH he was TKE and pre-med, graduating summa cum. Following Tufts Medical, he interned at Maine Medical Center and then served as second lieutenant at the Military Sea Transportation Service in Brooklyn and the Naval Air Station in Brunswick, Maine, returning to Lancaster after completing his service. He practiced general medicine and assisted in surgery as an anesthesiologist. When not doctoring, he was an avid hunter, fisherman and gardener. George Cole, a life-long resident of Kensington and a Thompson School of Agriculture graduate, died December 19, 2022. George was a 50-year member of the Kensington Volunteer Fire Department and worked for 20 years as a civilian firefighter for the federal government at Chelsea Naval Hospital and the former Pease Air Force Base. He was a member of the Rockingham County Farm Bureau and the Experimental Aircraft Association for many years. Hard to believe, but 70 years ago we put on black robes and mortarboards to receive our degrees. In this regard I asked the alumni office about reunioning and got this reply: The class of 1953 did the “Fabulous 50’s” decade reunion in 2019. That was the last “formal” reunion for the class. However, all reunion classes are always welcome to come back and attend the Friday of Reunion, as “golden Wildcats” and enjoy the campus tours and luncheon with the president. That means any Friday of a Reunion Weekend you can lunch with other golden Wildcats and catch up with what’s new and exciting on campus. In the meantime, please drop me a line about what you’ve been up to even though you may not be running up and down mountains any more or heading off to the South Pole. See or chat with any classmates? Remember a funny incident that happened in a class you took?\n\n1955\n\nThere are many of you that have a great deal of interesting facts about things you have done these past years that would be very interesting to pass on to your classmates. Take a few minutes tonight to send me a short note on what has filled your days this week. Perhaps something about yourself, your family, your recent successes and future plans. I last suggested you let us know about a special project you completed in the past 67 years, where you donated your time to help others and were rewarded with a special thanks. Bob Austin sent a note that he recently received a 2022 lifetime achievement award with a letter from the president for his many years of service at the Holden Forest and Gardens in Kirkland, Ohio. Prior to leaving Korea, I was assigned to supervise a project for the Armed Forces Assistance to Korea Program. Which included the supervision of building a primary school with a Korean work crew in YuYang, just north of Seoul. I received a special note of thanks from a village mayor as well as a beautiful scroll from the superintendent of schools. We undoubtedly have many more stories like these among our class members. Chris Winslow sent a note that he had recently returned to Boston after many years and was surprised to see all the new buildings. He then drove down to Scituate to join Marshall Litchfield for some lunch at a lovely seaside restaurant. John Rodda sent us his Christmas newsletter bringing us up to date on his entire family. Last summer he was having problems with his knee, but after several shots and recovering from COVID-19, he is now back in action; he was to return to Maine to the Appalachian Mountain Club on Echo Lake with his family, but unfortunately it was closed because of COVID-19. We lost a few more of our classmates this past year. Audra Williams Riotte passed away in September 2022 at her home in Greensboro, North Carolina. She received her master’s degree from Harvard and joined the State Department where she was assigned to the U.S. Air Force base in Casablanca and met her husband, Wyndham Riotte. They married two years later in Wiesbaden, Germany. She gave up teaching to travel the world and raise her three children. It’s reported she was a wonderful cook, cracker-jack crossword solver, and dedicated to keeping physically fit. In 1980 she took a teaching job at St. Petersburgh Junior College where she remained until around 2007, then retired to her home on the water in Dunedin, Florida. We have just been informed that Billy Pappas passed away recently. Will have more news in next issue. Art Bishop passed away at home in Huntington Beach, California, in October 2022. Art made a career in the U.S. Air Force and met his wife, Anne, near Fulda, Germany. She just happened to work for the local Porsche dealer where Art would have his car maintained and spoke English. They were married a year later and had two children. In July 1970 Art was transferred to Vietnam where he flew some 100 missions in the A-1 Sky-rider. He returned to the States to various local assignments and retired as a lieutenant colonel in 1977. He then returned to school to get his master’s in accounting from Cal State University. He worked as a project manager at Aerospace Corporation until retirement in 1995. For the next 25 years he and Ann travelled in Europe and enjoyed family. Carolyn Louise Delbrouck Googins passed away in Raleigh, North Carolina, in July 2022. She married her college sweetheart shortly after graduation, and settled in Rochester, New York, where he worked for Xerox. They divorced and had no children. Carolyn worked for the New York State Department of Labor until her retirement. She moved to Chapel Oaks, part of the Saint Ann’s Community and enjoyed two great years before moving to North Carolina. We send our love and prayers to the families of our fellow classmates. Remember we all like to read about our classmates, so please send us some news to pass along. It takes all of us to keep this column going. Thank you for your help.\n\n1956\n\nI retired from my “real” job in January 2009 and gave up my consulting business in December 2017 but it still took me until 2021, about the middle of the pandemic, to finally learn how to retire. When the pandemic was relatively reduced, I realized I had given up so many activities and now I didn’t really want to go back to all of them. However, while I’m a bit disabled from a near-fatal accident in 2008 and had to give up long-distance running, I still participate in activities both educational (local college) and political (as an unrelenting junkie after being in office 20 years and working with state legislators and Congress) and still go to the gym at 5 a.m. When I saw the need for a new class secretary, knowing our class numbers have dwindled, I wanted to make sure we wouldn’t drop out of the news column. I remember being class secretary our junior year (I think …) so I thought it was about time to volunteer. My husband, Tom Hollarn passed away in January 2020, but we have been here for almost 52 years and I have several of my family of three daughters, eight grandchildren and 11 great-grandchildren, a bunch of in-laws, and a couple of ex-in-laws, some of whom still live here or within an hour or two, so this is home. Shalimar is a little town right next to Eglin Air Force Base; Fort Walton Beach and Destin are our beach towns on the northern Gulf of Mexico in the northwest Florida Panhandle. With Alabama 45 miles due north and due west, we are in the central time zone and more like the real South instead of Florida. I’ve written more about myself than anyone else, as we had news from only one classmate sent in since the last issue, and I’m hoping to encourage more of you to share some news with us in the near future. I want to thank Robert Keene in Hanover, and although his news sadly was about the loss of his wife Jean, I want him to know that because of his sharing, all of us who read this are remembering and sending him comfort and compassion for his loss. Jean had an outstanding career and life in Hanover, especially as wife to Bob for 67 years, mother of three, and to add to the joy, five grandchildren and three great-grandchildren. As our numbers are dwindling, it would be great to be able to fill this column fully with news of the class of 1956, so please be in touch!\n\n1957\n\nIN THE MOMENT: August is here, fall and winter coming our way again. We at the June 2-4, 2023, UNH Reunion had nostalgic connections in person and in memory! Surprise call in March ’23 from Jack Barnes, Jr. ’56, age 92, of Raymond, because his class of 1956 column was missing in the UNH MAG and he said how much he enjoyed ours! Paul and Meg Hutchinson Goyette of Londonderry are celebrating their 65th anniversary! Fritz, our pres., and Lois Armstrong live six months on the Cape and six months in Florida and he still swims several miles a day! Bill and Ruth Zimmerman report a year of difficult health challenges; send some “healing hugs!” Priscilla Daggett loved the UNH Winter mag — the inspiring Sustainability Institute and the Hamel Center and our 1957 news! She is in rural Vermont but active in Montpelier activities with a pending family wedding of a grandson in June. Sandy Willand Pelton, class VP, now in Wilmington, North Carolina, is rehabbing from knee surgery. Janice Gardella Gilroy in Bradford, Massachusetts, says, “I think we’re lucky we made it this far!” Gwen Marsh Caldwell, Marshfield, Massachusetts, will have spent a fun May week at Lake Opechee Inn and Spa in Laconia, with family “knitters” to honor her birthday. Cynthia MacCauley Colbath, Suwanee, Georgia, keeps traveling: Mexico, San Antonio, Nashville, Greece in past months and is always ready to go. As for me, because I’m always into music, I’ll have had my fourth trip to Ireland with Irish musicians as of this publication — always a deep and fun experience. Carly and Jim Hellen at RiverWoods Durham are involved as ever in social justice vigils, community, Death Cafes and other In-house events — and music with the RWD Ramblers! Grateful and giving: At our 65th reunion, Jim, treasurer, announced the closing of our treasury and noted 1957 gave $2,000 to the Wildcat statue and $2,000 to the renovation of the flagpole and wall in front of T-Hall. In 2008, $10,000 was transferred to our endowed scholarship fund (market value at reunion of $448,432.) The market value of our CIE scholarship at reunion was $71,569. The 1957 class can be proud of how its money power continues to perform. Thanks to Jim for overseeing and tracking the outcomes! Two scholarships awarded by the class of 1957: First, the Class of 1957 CIE Endowment was awarded to Gracie Barba ’25 of Rye, whose major is the Classics: ancient Mediterranean civilization plus a second major of anthropology. Jenna Titus ’26 of Barrington, received a Class of 1957 Endowed Scholarship. We are so delighted to support these students! Farewells: About half of the 600+ in our class have moved on. The amazing truth about the 10 listed here are the lives so fully lived and the legacies left in their wake; such varied interests, talents, skills, achievements, courageous changes of direction, service, creativity, families, education and presence. Farewell to: Dottye L. Yakovakis, (wife of Jim Yakovakis), York, Maine, and Florida, March 2023; Ann Patricia Luneau Lapchick, 87, Hilton Head, South Carolina, October 1, 2022 (Joe Lapchick ’61G, Ann’s husband died a few months after Ann); Thomas Lacey, 91, October 28, 2022, Lebanon; Ronald LaBounty, 86, Manchester, October 17, 2021; Lorraine McCanne, 87, Pueblo, Colorado, September 27, 2022; Jean Allen Eveleth (nee Jean Tudor Allen), 88, Lake Oswego, Oregon, September 1, 2021; Donald Frederick Gove, 89, Portland, Maine, December 11, 2022; Richard M.

To the almost half (around 285) of our class who still walk the earth: Let us honor each moment, embracing life just as it is, walking softly so no one knows that we passed by there, loving ourselves and others, reaching out, savoring sunrises and sunsets, listening to rain, feeling alive inside like a kid with a toy, enjoying the simple things right in front of us, doing everything we can do! Remember, we only get one time to go through! SO: Send a line or two about YOU! And know that your friends and classmates hold you close even though we’re lots older and apart…we ARE bonded!\n\nPeggy Ann Shea ’58 at the Neutron Monitor Truck parked behind DeMeritt Hall. “I used that picture in several of my ‘historical’ lectures.”\n\n1958\n\nJack W. Suhesky ’24 was the recipient of a scholarship from our Class of 1958 William T. and Lee M. Nelson Scholarship Fund for Excellence. Jack comes from Portsmouth and is majoring in business administration with a specialty in finance. Thomas Whitcomb has moved from Keene to 6619 E. Valle di Cadore, Tucson, Arizona. His e-mail address is thomas.whitcomb7@outlook.com. Alan Vincent writes that all is well in Iowa; his granddaughter was married on March 25. Alan will be visiting New England in the summer to see his son in Connecticut and daughter in New Hampshire. Bobbie and Bob Juster enjoyed spending time with Mary Ann and David Chase during the winter with both couples in Naples, Florida. They all celebrated their 86th birthdays together. Bobbie and Bob celebrated their 65th wedding anniversary in June. Married right after graduation, Bobbie recalls that they were always the last couple on the dance floor at UNH gatherings. I keep active with my career and in January participated in a webinar organized by Boston University and MIT. The topic of my talk was “The Road Taken: My Journey in Space Physics from the IGY (1957) to the Present” and included some of my years at UNH. The webinar was to encourage young people to consider a career in STEM, and I focused my talk on “follow your dreams.” I have just submitted a manuscript to a professional journal on the large solar cosmic ray event of Feb. 23, 1956. That event occurred a month before I started working on cosmic ray data acquired by a neutron monitor located in a truck behind DeMeritt Hall and was, in a way, my introduction to cosmic ray physics. We have lost several of our classmates. After graduating from UNH, Joan (Colon) Duncan (Underhill, Vermont) received a master’s in education and lived a very active life. She was an accomplished equestrian, enjoying many sports, knitting, travelling and volunteering. Nancy L. Johnson (Raleigh, North Carolina, and Charlottesville, Virginia) earned a master’s degree in public health from the University of North Carolina and served in the International Voluntary Services, Laos. She also lived in the Philippines and Peru and worked for the state of North Carolina as a nutritionist for more than 20 years. She enjoyed travelling and quilting. As a graduate student at UNH, Avrom Aaron Levy (Mount Vernon, New York) studied psychology and was a child psychologist for more than 50 years having both a private practice and working for the New York city school system. Aaron had an affinity for photography, antique clocks, wine tasting, classical music and travel. Upon retiring from teaching home economics in the Long Island, New York, area, Janet R. Tegan and her husband, Bob, returned to New Hampshire to live in Dover. She was an avid reader. Bradley A. (Brad) Trefethen (Ballston Lake, New York) served in the U.S. Air Force and spent his professional career as an insurance agent for Liberty Mutual and later as an insurance agency manager for Allstate. Brad volunteered with Saratoga County to deliver meals to those in need and was an avid sports fan enjoying golf and bowling. Other classmates who have passed include Paul Dana Archibald (Sun City Center, Florida), Donald Brenton (Naples, Florida), Joseph Cotie (Orange City, Florida), Beatrice Curtis, (New York, New York), Richard W. Funke (Gilroy, California) and John J. O’Connor (Cambridge, Massachusetts).\n\n1959\n\nWith the passing of my dear friend Diane Woods, I will be filling in as class notes editor. Diane did a great job as class secretary. She played a leading role in urging me and the other class officers, back in 2007, to have our class gift to UNH be used to support undergraduate researchers through the Hamel Center for Undergraduate Research. From the summer of 2008 through the summer of 2022, the Class of 1959 Fund for Excellence has supported a total of 49 student researchers, for a total of $143,901. This includes support for Undergraduate Research Awards (URAs), Summer Undergraduate Research Fellowships (SURFs), and Research Experience and Apprentice Program (REAP) fellowships. Each year, as president of our class, I receive heart-warming letters of appreciation from Hamel Center students that have benefited from our class fund. At the end of June 2022, the market value of our fund was $291,137, so it should live on for years! Anita Miller writes that she continues to enjoy pottery, jam and baking and would like to hear from Phi Mu sisters. She stays in touch with Patricia Herman Howe who is now in Virginia. Anita’s granddaughter, Sabrina Alan ’26, is a freshman at UNH, and loving it. Alan F. Skelley Sr. died March 16, 2023, at 89 years old. In 1956, Alan married Virginia “Gina” Bailey ’52 of Wolfeboro. Both Al and Gina held the University of New Hampshire close to their hearts; their eldest son, “Chip” ’81, as well as his wife Deb (Hale) ’81, their daughter Kaitlyn ’06, and Al’s grandson Dougie ’06 are all alums of UNH. You could regularly see Al and Gina at field hockey, football and hockey games year in and year out. Al held immense pride in the Gina Bailey Skelley Athletic Fund, which was spearheaded by Jere Lundholm ’53 and his wife, Harriet Forkey ’54 ’67G, in honor of Gina. This scholarship has been awarded to a field hockey player annually at UNH since the fall of 2016. Al and Gina moved to Wolfeboro in the early 1960s to raise a family and help assist with the family restaurant, Bailey’s, which they eventually owned and operated. They owned and managed Bailey’s Dockside Restaurant for 22 years, and Bailey’s Restaurant for 40 years. Alan also served as the town police commissioner from 1969-1973; was a member of the Lions Club; served on the board of directors of the Kingswood Trust & Savings Bank; and coached many middle school football and high school ski teams at the Kingswood schools. He was part owner of Boston Hill Ski Area in Andover, Massachusetts and Mt. Whittier in Ossipee. One of the greatest joys in Alan’s life was his family; he’s survived by four sons, 12 grandchildren and eight great-grandchildren.\n\n1960\n\nKudos to Michelle Morrissey ’97, editor-in-chief and Corena Garnas of Alumni Relations for their hard work in providing us with the wonderful Winter 2023 hard issue edition of UNH Magazine. I wish to remind class members that although there were no issues mailed during Covid months, those previous issues can be found online at https://magazine.unh.edu. In a conversation with Sam Paul, class president, he mentioned that he did not spend time in Florida this past winter as he was undergoing chemotherapy for the cancer in his lungs, but he added that there were some positive results from the treatment. I was so happy to hear from Mike Mikzenas at Christmastime. He mentions that “getting old isn’t easy.” That we know! He still thinks about and misses the old UNH gang. He and his wife, Terri, are still in Clearwater, Florida. Unfortunately, I have no news from other classmates. Corena Garnas on the Alumni Relations team suggests we come up with memorable events on campus while we were there regarding a favorite class, affinity groups or meeting up with a UNH grad somewhere far from the campus. In the last issue, I mentioned the good times we had at Commons during our freshman year. A good memory for me occurred in February of our senior year when John F. Kennedy came to UNH. As secretary of the campus Young Democrats, I greeted him and shook his hand as he came out of the limo with Pierre Salinger before going into New Hampshire Hall. At 21 years of age and meeting this 42-year-old running for president, I had all I could do to remain standing! Here are the names of classmates who have left us. Leo Martin passed away on June 25, 2021. He had been in the insurance business for 60 years. Leo and his wife, Pat Moriarty ’61, had lived in Akron, Ohio, for 33 years, retired to Westport Island, Maine, for 15 years and then moved to North Carolina because of his failing health. George LaCasse died on June 26, 2021, in Blue Ridge, Virginia. Joan Evelyn Hill passed away on October 30, 2021. She received her bachelor’s in mathematics and her master’s in mathematical/computer education at Oregon State University. She was a lifelong teacher. Margaret Cooney died in Lansing, Michigan, on August 9, 2022. She studied French at Indiana University and The Sorbonne in Paris, receiving a master’s degree. In later years she received her CPA accreditation and served as auditor for the Michigan Public Service Commission. Benjamin J. Prescott of Concord passed away on October 13, 2022. Ben worked for National Cash Register for many years. He later purchased a sporting goods store in Concord and a bike shop in Manchester. His early years of caddying led to golf opportunities at home locations in Concord, Chebeague Island, Maine, and St. Simons Island, Georgia. Deanna C. Holt of Nashua died on January 18, 2023. For many years Deanna was employed as an administrative assistant at Sanders Associates/BAE in Nashua where she met her husband, Alan. The Class of 1960 Endowed Scholarship Fund was awarded to Alexandra L. Vergara ’23 of Alton Bay, who is majoring in English.\n\n1961\n\nJacquelyn Beauregard Dillman writes from Newport Beach, California: “So glad to hear our 1961 alumni group is still active. My husband Bob, (Stanford ’69, Baylor Medical ’72) and I have been married 41 years now. So what happened to us over the pandemic years: we shared cooking, I did laundry and he vacuumed and gardened, we played cards and grew thousands of tomatoes. We read many books, discovered new authors and joined three wine and food clubs. As careful as we were, we did have Covid in October 2022; Bob had attended a conference in Boston, caught Covid and brought it home to me. We gained a new granddaughter during the pandemic, Riley Florence Dillman. We now have 12 grands. Three of our sons live on the East Coast, the other three in California. In 2019, we celebrated my 80th birthday by taking the entire family to Disney World & EPCOT in Orlando. This splendid time was a heartfelt meaningful point in my life. Our return to normal came with the first full family gathering on New Year’s Day 2023 at our home in Newport Beach, the return of all that fun and joy, all of us together again, brought grateful tears to my eyes — how blessed we are in every way. Now we are emerging into the wider world, beginning our first international travel with a Viking cruise in April, from Venice to Istanbul. I’m glad we attended as many reunions as we did, it was wonderful to see UNH and all the good memories I have of the dorm and library, T-Hall and the bell. Best wishes to all our classmates.” Forrest Knowles reports on the last five years: “I have sad news. My wife, Betty, passed away two years ago. She was 78 and had been suffering from dementia. My son lives in Nashua and he has been a great help. I have been keeping busy by volunteering at the Wish Project of Chelmsford, Massachusetts, and being active with my church. I do lots of exercising, take frequent walks and go to classes at the Senior Center in Burlington. Photography is still my hobby and I have taken up horseback riding again after being away from it for 10 years. Our 60th reunion was a real joy where I met several classmates and enjoyed the lobster dinner and the class parade even if it was held inside. Lots of nostalgia when I walked around the campus. Hunter Hall and Alexander Hall where I lived looked almost the same as when I was a student. So much has changed but so much remains the same. Hope to get back to UNH soon. Go Wildcats!” Art Monty writes, “We are back in southern France where my wife, Pam, and I spend a good part of the winter. I’m a very active bicyclist and ride here all winter; our rides are around four hours long and include some magnificent parts of France. We’re off for a week in Tunisia at the beginning of April, we haven’t been there in quite a while. We’ll be heading back to New Hampshire in June to start our various gardens and plan to skip up to Ontario to visit my wife’s family. We’re both enjoying the best of health and hope to continue our good luck in this department.” Stephen Root advises he is living in Guilford, Connecticut. His son and wife are both UNH alumni, including grad school, and his daughter and spouse are Keene State alumni, plus grad school and his other daughter and spouse are Dickinson College alumni, including his son-in-law from its medical school. His grandchildren graduated from Keene State, Boston University, UMass and UConn. Stephen makes infrequent returns to New Hampshire when visiting our classmate Lois Magenau. As for myself, I’d like to greet fellow classmates and note: there comes a time when changes seem to be appropriate. After 28 years as our class correspondent, and class secretary, our highly esteemed classmate Pat Gagne Coolidge wishes to seek new challenges in life and graciously retire as our class correspondent. We now express our sincere and deepest appreciation for all her efforts during many years in keeping us well informed and up to date on our classmates’ activities. We wish her well and I hope to be able to continue our periodic news and reviews as your new class correspondent. Best wishes to you all for your future endeavors.\n\n1963\n\nThe class of 1963 celebrated their 60th reunion from UNH in June. The reunion planning committee included me, Diane Glenn, Sue Long, Stella Scamman and Carroll Winch. We would like to thank Phebe Moore ’13, assistant director, Alumni Engagement, for her wonderful guidance in our planning of the memorable event. Margaret Edmunds Roberts informed the committee that her husband, George, would welcome classmates to the banquet. Many classmates were unable to attend the reunion but have shared with me some news. I have heard from some of my Chi Omega Sisters. Linda Stewart Taft’s son, Michael, wrote that Linda has moved to Philadelphia to be closer to her daughter, Jennifer. She had lived in North Carolina for many years with her partner, Ray, who passed away February 2021. Pooky Clover Fowler and Chip Fowler ’61 celebrated their 59th anniversary on Groundhog Day. They were married in Schenectady, New York, one week after Chip returned from Vietnam. Emily Maslen Dirksen is living in California and stays very busy with her husband, John, and they enjoy visiting/entertaining their six children and many grandchildren. Emily says she must be younger than us all. Sara Conant Cote and her husband Don were married the day after they graduated from UNH 60 years ago. They love living in a retirement community in Boulder, Colorado. Elliott Markowitz was a chemical engineering graduate and taught mathematics at the high school and college level for 38 years. He became a duplicate bridge player and a big New York Yankees fan growing up in the Bronx and living in Yonkers for more than 50 years. He has fond memories of living in Fairchild Hall while on campus. I have to laugh as Elliott says he must be the most invisible member of the class of ’63 as he has never submitted any news for the magazine. Elliott, you no longer hold that honor! Tom Young, aka Mot (Tom spelled backwards), reported that he was in the U.S. Army after graduating and then spent 30 years in banking. After running a paint store, Tom retired with his wife, Marie, to an oceanfront condo community in Plymouth, Massachusetts. They have three children and five grandchildren. He stays in touch with his Theta Chi brothers through email or occasional lunch. And Andrew K. Galloway reports that he has been retired for many years and is enjoying living in Arizona. Hope everyone had a happy and healthy summer and please continue to send me news to include in the upcoming magazine.\n\n1964\n\nSave the Dates for our 60th Reunion, June 7-9, 2024. Contact Corena Garnas in the alumni office if you would like to get involved! corena.garnas@unh.edu. Spring is here, at the time of this writing, following an incredible wintery season here in the Southwest — more snow than anyone can remember. The Snowbowl in Flagstaff was ecstatic! Torrential rains that raised Oak Creek many feet indeed, scrambling down its creek bed, toting along two mobile homes (from up the road!), followed by a Jeep — exciting to watch! Now we enjoy all the greenery that the waters have brought forth. Just when I am beginning to believe that NO ONE reads this column, a burst of joy comes forth in the mail! A real envelope to slit open, with real handwritten contents to read! THANK you, Sheila M. Knight! An elementary teacher, Sheila taught for many years in Laconia, Portland, Maine, and for three decades in Portsmouth. Her most interesting passion at this time revolves around the beautiful Concord Coaches, a part of the Abbot-Downing Historical Society. Upon entering UNH those many years ago, she found Paul Creative Arts Center, as did I! (I actually thought perhaps they’d built that stage just for me!) She fondly remembers Professor George Thomas who guided the art education majors, along with art history professor James Fasanelli and, of course, THE most talented artist and teacher, John Hatch. How well I, too, recall John. He was quick to put one’s apprehensions at rest when he suggested that his nude models simply pretend “you are wearing invisible clothing.” (Worked like a charm!) JD (Gerald Daniels) and I made a portion of our income working for him during the first days of our marriage. And JD, how many shows did we do together on that stage? How many memorable times did we share together during our 31 years of marriage? Such an amazing father JD was; such a fantastic grandfather. He passed away on October 30, 2022, and since, not a new wonderful book is read by me that I don’t immediately think “JD would LOVE this one!” only to realize I cannot make the email suggestion to him anymore. So, I just whisper the title. As he had whispered to me so many times during our performances over many, many years, I now whisper to him all of my thoughts, sent “up” each and every day. Exit stage left. Curtain.\n\n1965\n\nFirst off, I want to thank our classmate Don Dean for making my day by sending me a short “thank you” note. Things like this make this job even more rewarding and fun. I love to hear from classmates I knew and many I didn’t know 60 years ago but I do now. Don’t forget to check out Natalie Salatich Jacobson’s book, “Every Life a Story: Natalie Jacobson Reporting,” which is primarily a reporter’s journal. You will find it on Amazon, ebook and Audible, with Nat doing the narration. Our esteemed class president, Ralph Young, and his wife, Judy (Corbett) Young, are looking forward to their sixth voyage aboard a Star Clippers sailing ship, this time the Royal Clipper, from Cannes, France, through the Strait of Gibraltar to Lisbon, Portugal, in October. This ship is 439 feet long and accommodates 227 guests. Judy added some info about their family: They celebrated Ralph’s 80th birthday with a trip to Sunday River and looked forward to their three grandchildren’s graduations this year. Next year they’ll have four in college, with only the youngest still in school. They enjoy trips in New England and to Maryland to spend time with their son and family. From my Christmas messages, Ingrid Norman Willikens, like many of us, hasn’t traveled as much lately as in past years, except to visit her daughter, Kaia, and family in Florida. Her two sons, Donny and Ian, both live in New Hampshire. Frank “Skip” Hubbard and wife Karen received some devastating news after Hurricane Ira dumped 20 inches of water inside their winter retreat on Marco Island, Florida. So they stayed in their home in Connecticut and re-learned how to clear away snow and ice! But both are very active seniors, so they managed and will rebuild their Florida home. There’s room in this column for a couple of obituaries that were sent to me. Elaine Chase Jackson was born in Rhode Island and raised in Jackson. She spent many years in California and New Hampshire (The Jack Frost Shop) as a clothing buyer. At age 33 she married the love of her life, Joe Jackson (along with his three children). They settled in Bournedale, Massachusetts, and ran Jackson Plumbing & Heating together for many years. Elaine became a grandmother of nine and a great-grandmother of 12. They retired to Anna Maria Island and spent winters at their home in St. Lucia. Elaine loved spending time with her family, reading, sailing and traveling. Robert Wendell Oslin of Bessemer, Alabama, passed away in May 2022. Born in Boston, he received a bachelor’s degree in agriculture-forestry, served 26 years in the U.S. Army, retiring in 1991. His career included two combat tours in Vietnam as a helicopter pilot, two tours in Germany, and multiple assignments in Alabama, Georgia, Texas, Oklahoma and Iowa. He was a member of Alpha Gamma Rho while at UNH. He was preceded in death by his wife of 58 years, Patricia. Richard Rogers of Fort Collins, Colorado, died peacefully on August 18, 2022. He was a tie-dye craftsman, a hippie, an artist, an author and a veteran. He developed and sold thousands of new and interesting tie-dye designs. If you check out his web page: https://stroyan.net/tie-dyes/ you can still see his many designs. He was a pacifist but served his three years as the supply clerk for the Frankfurt Army Hospital. He lived in communes in Vermont and at The Farm in Tennessee, a spiritual community, which ended up being the largest hippie “commune” in the country. Carol Joy (Hanson) Smith died peacefully in Providence, Rhode Island, in November 2022, after a long courageous battle with ALS, her husband Jerry wrote to tell us. Carol taught elementary school, adult education and ESL. She was fluent in seven foreign languages, an accomplished pianist and composer who made her performance debut at age 15, a gifted, award-winning poet, and a research consultant. She enjoyed ice skating, tennis, cake decorating, travel and mountain climbing. She and Jerry were married for 43 years. The names of deceased classmates sent to me from the Alumni Office include William Allgaier III (February 2023) Anthony DeRocchi (September 2022); Mitchell Dirsa (November 2022); Charlie Downes (December 2022); Warren Edmonds (December 2022); Susan Pimentel Meyers (August 2022) and Raymond Steenbeke (June 2022). Our condolences to the families of our deceased classmates.\n\nTop to bottom: Eric and Betty Beaverstock, both class of 1966, in front of the Wildcat statue outside the Whitt on a recent visit to campus. The couple with daughter Holly ’95 in front of the Foxwoods Christmas tree.\n\n1966\n\nAs you now know, I am your new ’66 class correspondent. In order that you might know who’s writing this, here is what I was doing at UNH: Forestry major; freshman year: Gibbs Hall, track and cross country; later, Alpha Gamma Rho fraternity, three years in Student Senate, senior key, and member of the 50th Anniversary Committee. Douglas Murphy writes that he and wife, Ann, are enjoying golf and other activities around Naples, Florida, where he is president of the Southwest Florida alumni chapter, keeping up the UNH spirit. The club might take a cruise, enjoy lunch and annually comes north for a Red Sox game. Douglas has a granddaughter at UNH and anticipates more grandchildren as students at our alma mater in the near future. Mary Parry Wolfe reminds me that her husband Frank ’65, my fraternity brother, passed away over two years ago from pancreatic cancer. Mary and Frank started Lake Street Garden Center in Salem 50 years ago, and Mary still works there. She sows all the seeds from late winter through spring. The management has passed to her oldest son, Tim. Two of Mary’s three children and her daughter-in-law are UNH alumni. She enjoys time with her family, including four grandchildren, and has a lake house in Northwood. She keeps in touch with UNH friends and certainly maintains the UNH spirit. Jane Washburn is happy that pandemic restrictions have been lifted so she can go back to volunteering at theaters. She is also a Granite State ambassador, volunteering for various events and venues, meeting new people and learning more about New Hampshire. She mentions that she has been friends with Betty Johnson Beaverstock since they were UNH freshmen. That’s a 60-year friendship! Betty and husband Eric Beaverstock ’67G are enjoying life to the fullest. They married in 1967, and are now retired, Eric from the computer software industry and Betty from teaching home economics in Maine and Massachusetts. They have one daughter, Holly ’95. Betty and Eric hold season tickets for UNH football and men’s hockey and have attended the men’s Frozen Four Hockey Tournaments since 2000. That event might be held in Boston, or Tampa, or somewhere else in the country, so provides a chance to travel. Other destinations include theatre productions in Boston, Ogunquit, Maine, and Cape Cod. The Beaverstocks are classic car buffs, especially enjoying the Father’s Day show in Hyannis, Massachusetts, and the Independence Day show at the Owl’s Head Transportation Museum in Maine. Other destinations include New York’s Adirondacks, Pennsylvania’s Poconos and Dutch country and Betty’s hometown of Morrisville, Pennsylvania. They keep in touch with our classmates Mary Washburn, Mary Parry Wolfe, Jim Rock and Carol Conde Miske. I know what you’re thinking. The answer is yes, Betty and Eric do have a home, in Hollis, which they built back in 1975. Brian Mitchell spent 20 years in the U.S. Air Force after college, and then had a wide-ranging employment experience, in Turkey and Spain, public housing maintenance director, retail auto parts sales, and even telemarketer. In 2006, Brian’s heart issues caused him to retire, but he volunteered with the Disabled American Veterans and served as a veterans service officer assisting with veterans’ compensation claims, a rewarding experience for him. Unfortunately, Brian’s oldest child died of cardiovascular issues. Brian and wife Ginny have been married for 57 years, and very involved in their family. They have eight grandchildren, including one in Russia, and two great-grandchildren. Brian’s enjoyment is his presidency of the Florida MG Car Club. He works on his three Triumphs and an Austin Healey, keeping them going, or trying to. As for me, I have two daughters, a son-in-law, and two grandsons, all in Massachusetts. My wife, Katsuyo, passed away from cancer in 2017. I had dinner with AGR brother Ross Allen in 2018 and took two friends to Maine for a tour of Moosehead Lake in 2019 in one of the restored small planes another fraternity brother, Roger Currier, Thompson School of Agriculture, owned for that purpose. I was sorry to learn that Roger has since passed away. My book should be out this year: “What’s Going on in There? A Jail Chaplain’s Story,” published by Austin Macauley, vignettes of my 30 years at Hampden (County) Correctional Center. I have a house on Cape Breton Island, Nova Scotia, with a 120-degree view of the ocean. I rent it out when I can’t be there. It’s listed at VRBO.com, ID 4730426. I hope to hear from more of you!\n\nDave ’66 and Di Deering ’67 with Natalie Salatich Jacobson ’65 (middle) at the Southwest Florida alumni chapter annual Red Sox game.\n\n1967\n\nThe Southwest Florida alumni chapter has been very busy this last year. With the leadership of chapter president Doug Murphy ’66 and his wife, Anne, the club met at the Venice Plantation restaurant for our annual February luncheon and the annual March Red Sox game at Jet Blue Park, Fort Myers. We were happy to hear from the new athletic director Allison Rich and former UNH quarterback star Rick Santos ’08 and now the UNH coach. We are excited for the fall season! Both events hosted classmates from the last seven decades. We were honored to have Natalie (Salatich) Jacobson ’65 with us to share her memoir “Every Life a Story.” Great UNH read! Plans are under way for a fall cruise and for bringing back, post-COVID, the UNH St. Patrick’s Day float in Naples. Stay tuned. It is with great sadness to report the passing of our UNH classmate and friend Chris Doucette. Chris was from Jackson and skied for the UNH team. Chris was a member of Lambda Chi and the U.S. Air Force ROTC program. He served the country and retired as a lieutenant colonel with plans to return to the state that he loved. Condolences to his wife, Antigone and daughter, Kinley.\n\n1968\n\nAs I write this, our reunion committee is working hard to welcome us back to our 55th class reunion. Yes, hard to believe that it has been 55 years since graduation. But as I read the news you have sent, it is clear that our classmates are still active in their various fields, including retirement. Sue Ann Robinson continues to teach artist books and paper making at California State University Long Beach. In addition, she is curator emerita for the Long Beach Museum of Art and working on a privately commissioned artist book. Some of us just can’t get enough snow activities. Mike Farrell and John Donovan spent a beautiful snow-laden day at Bretton Woods. Jerry Rainville and his wife have returned to New Hampshire after 50 years in Maryland. He has become involved in the Share Fund in Rochester. Hopefully he will be at Reunion. Rick Butterworth and Chet Johnson attended the EDALHAB reunion last June. EDALHAB is an underwater habitat that was designed, built and tested in Lake Winnipesaukee by engineers in the class of ’68. It is now permanently displayed in Odiorne State Park in Rye. You can read more about it in the last issue of UNH Magazine online: magazine.unh.edu/issue/winter-2023/discovery-in-an-undersea-barrel/. I would love to hear from more of you as our retirement and travel plans roll on. Continue to enjoy life.\n\n1969\n\nHello! Kathy and I enjoyed our spring and summer. Filled with several family gatherings, Ohio and the Cape, kayaking and hiking. Fourteen Phi Mu Delta’s, representing the classes of ’67 to ’70, from Maine to New York, had a reunion at the Holy Grail. It was great to catch up on life after UNH and reliving old memories. Speaking of getting together: Save the dates for our 55th Reunion, June 7-9, 2024. Contact Corena Garnas in the alumni office if you would like to get involved! corena.garnas@unh.edu. Gary Ladd sent a note thanking the magazine for all the updates. Thanks to Gary for his support. Heard from Berneen Bratt who is “living the dream.” Five weeks in Italy, five weeks exploring U.S. National Parks and an upcoming four-week Pacific cruise. Go Berneen! Our condolences go out to all the family and friends of alumni listed in the class of ’69 In Memoriam section. Enjoy the upcoming year and please stay in touch.\n\nPhi Mu Delta members gathered recently at the Holy Grail: front row, left to right: John Bell ’69, Merrill Lewis ’67, Jack Stark ’69, Tom Mollitor ’68, Rick Thissell ’69 ’75G, Don Tyler ’70, Dick Pastor ’68 ’73G and Norm Ouellette ’69; back row, left to right: John Safford ’70, Steve Capistran ’69, Greg Waugh ’69, Will Brunkhorst ’71, Bob Hasevlat ’70 and Howie Pearce ’68.\n\n1970\n\nIt’s been great to hear from so many of you by email or our class Facebook page. Maryevelyn Biggers Monty had exciting news: “Love found me again! I married Neil Pilotte October 8. He is 10 years my junior and still working as a medical technologist. We are both avid skiers and building a house at Sugar Hill. We also hike the Whites and canoe on the mighty Merrimack with our Australian shepherd. I am a professional museum interpreter (tour guide) at Canterbury Shaker Village. I have amazing health and energy thanks to a life practice of dance, yoga and Pilates. Neil and I are politically and civically active. I am very grateful for my life journey! My name is now Maryevelyn Monty Pilotte.” Other classmates are on the move, too. Art Learmonth writes: “After 17 years of retirement in northwest Washington state, my wife Diane and I have moved back east to Stockton Springs, Maine, to be closer to family.” Ken Nelson is happily retired with his wife, Joyce: “We spend our winters in Lake Wales, Florida, and the rest of the year we are at our home in Somersworth. Much of my time is spent gardening, metal detecting and doing volunteer work for various civic and nonprofit organizations. We are blessed with good health and lots of grandkids.” Richard Masson has been living in San Pedro, California, for decades. He says: “A cool note is that every year, in the summer, a few of us UNH graduates meet for a week of golf and bonding, somewhere in the U.S. The four of us played baseball together at UNH. This year we are going to Nashville.” The group will include Brian Collins, Walter “Buddy” Walsh, Rick Schavone, and “a non-baseball guy,” Jerry Isaacson: “Buddy lives in South Carolina, Brian in Florida/Massachusetts, Jerry in Tiburon, California, and Rick is about to settle down in Laconia.” Under the byline @janiceharayda, I write a column on pop culture, among other articles, for Medium.com, which has upwards of 50 million visitors a month. In April I linked to one of my stories that I thought might interest our class (especially those from New Jersey like Margaret Urban, Cynthia Brown, Brad Cook and Laurie Folkes): “Are We All Wrong About the Legacy of Bruce Springsteen?” It explored — from my perspective as a Garden State native — how the world might remember the Boss. A happy result was that I heard, through our Facebook page, of many class connections to my home state. New Jersey native Gale Griese Butcher says she lives in Brewster, Massachusetts: “Happily retired from teaching. Married to Bill Butcher ’69 for 53 years!” E. Warren Pierce III said that after UNH, he served in the U.S. Army and was stationed at Fort Dix 1972-1975. Thomas Earle Moore noted that he’d enjoyed listening to Bobby Rydell’s “Wildwood Days” before UNH, and a few years ago, finally made it to the New Jersey beach town the song celebrates. Jim Fiore added: “As a kid growing up my parents always took me to Hampton Beach every summer while my best friend always went to Asbury Park. For my 75th birthday my family took me to Asbury Park!” Jim is still an avid runner who recently ran several 3.8-mile races and one 3.5-mile run at State University of Albany as part of Hudson Mohawk Road Runners Club Winter Series. “I was fortunate to win a Bountiful Bread coupon three times for placing in the top two of our age group (70-79),” he says. Congratulations, Jim!\n\n1971\n\nCarolyn Bailey Sylvester retired from office management only to start a new career as a substitute teacher (what were you thinking Carolyn?) She lives in Reading, Massachusetts, and works at the same schools where her grandchildren go. They play hockey so she keeps her puffy coat in the car. Her granddaughter in Arizona competes in gymnastics which keeps her and husband Frank ’73 busy. Ed “Duke” Kline writes that he has been skiing regularly this winter both at Ragged Mountain and Bretton Woods. Tickets are $39 for us “old guys,” he says. He continues to play rock music weekly with his bandmates, all over 60 except for their drummer who is a 30-something! He says, very modestly, that they are “damn good” and would love to play more ‘out’ but for now they play for themselves in a barn at Center Harbor which has had a million-dollar reno. He wishes everyone a happy spring! Kris Durmer says he sent this before, but I can’t find it so here goes again! After 30 years of private law practice in Nashua, in 2009 he was invited to serve as general counsel at the GSA during the Obama administration. He retired in 2017 and decided to try something new and became a “certified mixologist” aka bartender! He did the private party circuit until COVID-19 put the kibosh on that. He remains connected in a counsel position at Forbes-Tate Partners which is a government relations/public affairs firm in DC. He’s enjoying some traveling, visiting with his four grandchildren and working on his golf game. Greg Franklin ran his own marketing firm in Lebanon and has now retired with his wife, Pam, where he has a hobby of restoring old sleighs. Richard Granger and his wife, Terry, retired to South Carolina a couple of years ago and they love the weather and don’t miss the snow. John Porter continues to be a lecturer for the New Hampshire Humanities Council Program and gives talks to historical societies about his book “Preserving Old Barns.” Most recently he has become a consultant for the Massachusetts Agricultural Viability Program. Yours truly, Debbi Martin Fuller, wants to encourage all women to get their mammograms. I just had a lumpectomy done (easy peasy) and because it was found super early, it is stage 0. I didn’t even know stage 0 existed! I’ll have to do radiation, but my mom did the same thing when she was my age and came home every day and played a round of golf. She died in 2017 at the ripe old age of 101! I did a lot of skiing this year too, at Okemo, ended on a high note March 31 and had my surgery on April 3. Today is the 4th! I’m looking forward to a trip to my niece’s wedding in June in South Carolina and to a cruise to Croatia in August. We’re not including obituaries in this column anymore, but you can find a list of newly deceased classmates in the “In Memoriam” section of the magazine. Don’t wait for an invite, send me your news!\n\n1972\n\nCarl Evensen shares a bit about his life since he left UNH. After receiving his MBA here in 1976, he started work at Martin Marietta Aerospace Corp., first as a financial analyst, then in “Skunk Works” the alias for a secretive division working on advanced aircraft. After he was married, he moved first to Missouri, where he was budget director, while his new wife was a post-doc in science. “She earned her master of science at UNH, where we met as residents in the graduate dorm, right next to Whittemore,” Carl recalls. The couple then moved to on to Pennsylvania State University, where she became tenured faculty, and Carl started work at Raytheon Aerospace in State College, Pennsylvania, as lead negotiator for contracts with the Defense Department. “After 20 years in the defense industry, I decided to change. I became financial officer for the Pennsylvania State University Main Campus. I negotiated the restructuring of Penn State’s 13 campuses into nine campuses across the state,” he shares. “The Jerry Sandusky scandal started at that time. When my boss Gary Schultz received jail time, I quit and became president of Millersville University. Then I joined The George Washington University in D.C. as a consultant, and, 10 one-year contracts later, I retired back to Pennsylvania.” He recalls his alma mater fondly. “UNH was a wonderful experience and learning opportunity … especially the MBA program, which made all the difference for me.”\n\n1973\n\n“A good time was had by all!” Our 50th class reunion was a huge success according to all of the attendees! The crazy weather couldn’t dampen our spirits. Thanks to the incredible organization, transportation was always present when needed. From the reception lunch to the final dinner, we were entertained and involved whether by speakers, tours or activities. It was rewarding to interact with the UNH president and many current students. We knew we were in “good hands” wherever the venue. Our amazement never ceased with all the changes over these 50 years; building and renovating continue into the present. Most impressive were all the upgraded technologies and recent innovations. We were also very impressed with all of the improvements regarding the university’s progress in its sustainability — a model for the country. We would be proud to have our grandchildren attend our University of New Hampshire! In other news: David Shaw ’73 recently brought a piece of his UNH history back to campus for what he hopes is a permanent inspiration to current students and visitors. It was more than 50 years ago in a UNH art class that he created a sculpture using a Styrofoam form and molten aluminum. “I named the sculpture Amara, and it lived with my parents and then me for many years as a single piece.” He recently decided to produce more Amaras in cast bronze — three of which were installed this spring on the UNH campus. “My hope is that these sculptures will convey the sense of joy and inspiration that I felt as a student at the time that the original piece was created,” says Shaw, who, along with his brother John, created the Shaw Explorers program through UNH’s Peter T. Paul Entrepreneurship Center with a generous gift in 2021. The sculpture gift, he says, is made “with gratitude for my UNH experience, and appreciation for the school’s impact in the world.” UNH Magazine did a story about the Shaw Explorers Program in its last issue, you can find that here: magazine.unh.edu/issue/winter-2023/the-age-of-exploration. It is with great sadness that we learned of the passing of Gary Russell Edwin O’Neal in March 2023. Gary was well known by our classmates and his participation in the theatre department\n\nIn attendance at the men’s soccer alumni game are (from left): Kevin Iarusso ’05, Knute Klefos ’80, Patrick Uden ’80, Ken Kincaid ’76, Ed Ulmer ’87, Jim Druding ’89, Tom Johnson ’76, Steve Bracy ’86 and Mike Daly ’84.\n\n1974\n\nAndrew Alden’s book, “Deep Oakland: How Geology Shaped a City,” was published in May by Heyday Books. Andrew resides in Oakland, California. He has been a geoscience editor and is planning on retirement this year. He says he still has the granite coasters he made with the Geology Department. Chuck Bergeron worked for Unitek Corporation for seven years selling orthodontic equipment. He started designing and fabricating orthodontic offices nationwide and then owned his own business for 35 years. New Jersey was home until retirement and now he and his wife, Carol, reside in the mountains of southwest North Carolina. They have two daughters and four grandchildren. They continue to enjoy riding their Spyder & Vanderall in the mountains and Chuck is president of the U.S. Spyder Ryders, Southern Mountain chapter. Walter Brown completed his undergraduate studies in electrical engineering and is remembering classmates Donald Clarke and Adam Rivera. Bruce Corson was in business development working with Japanese clients until 2008 when he turned a hobby into a business and started a service to help people in their homes with their computer issues. Fifteen years later, Patient Computer Help for Grownups serves 1,400 clients. The company recently won “Business of the Year” from 575 members of the local Chamber of Commerce. His daughter works with him and they are certified by Apple as members of the Apple Consultants Network. Bruce and his wife, Ann, live in Chagrin Falls, Ohio, as does their daughter, her husband and two children. Catherine Stevens has transitioned to a part-time nonprofit fundraising/communications position to allow for more time for friends, family, husband and dogs! She says that several UNH alums attended a wonderful Keene High School reunion last August and they all felt they looked the same. Kurt Buck had a career in deep sea oceanography. He spends five months of the year in Baja, California, and the rest of the year in Port Angeles, Washington. Janis Gogan received her Ed.M., MBA from Harvard. She retired last year from her professor position at Bentley College. She remains active as a case researcher on how companies use new software technologies. She and her husband have four children and five grandchildren and have settled in Cambridge and Kennebunk. Janis would love to reconnect with UNH friends. Norm Fluet received his doctorate in clinical psychology from Baylor University. He retired in 2019 after 41 years of practice in clinical psychology. Sadly, Norm lost his wife of 40 years six years ago. Since then, he has traveled extensively including Antarctica, China, Europe, Machu Picchu, New Zealand and Iceland. He gets back to New Hampshire every couple of years and would love to hear from UNH friends. Norm lives in Woodway, Texas. John Tommasi has published his third book, “Murder Outside the Back Door.” It is a true story of the murder of a popular Salem school teacher by her husband and is available on Amazon. John and his wife, Leslie MacLennan Tommasi, reside in Hampton Beach. Margaret Corbett Wiley has relocated to Maine. She has co-authored her first book, “Flashbulb Memories,” based on a fictional family’s reaction to two real-life murders in Manchester in the 1960s. Margaret is an associate professor emerita at Colby-Sawyer College in New London. Please send news to share with your fellow classmates!\n\n1976\n\nI went back to campus this spring for the Men’s Soccer Alumni Match and got to see old teammates, recent alumni and watch the highly ranked men’s team close-up. Was I ever that fast? Wisely the “older” alumni watched and cheered on the 2-2 draw. The campus was vibrant as a women’s lacrosse game went on in Wildcat Stadium and our new Athletic Director Allison Rich paid us a visit to introduce herself to the alumni. Also attending from our year was Thomas Johnson. On a personal note, my twins are finishing their sophomore years at Bryant and American universities and plan to do some study abroad in the near future. Glenn Coppelman ’76G writes that after a 38-year tenure on the Kingston Planning Board, he decided to run for a seat on the Select Board and was victorious by one vote! “Every vote counts” could not be a truer statement. Peter A. Siver ’76G received his master’s degree in botany, with a specialty in phycology (the study of algae) and limnology (the study of inland waters), working under professor Al Baker. Peter also studied with professor Art Mathieson, a marine phycologist who directed the Jackson Lab for many years. After graduation, Peter earned a Ph.D. from the University of Connecticut and has spent more than 40 years as a professor, mostly at Connecticut College. He was recently presented with an Award of Excellence for his lifelong work from the Phycological Society of America and elected to the Connecticut Academy of Science and Engineering in 2023. In recognition of his mentors at UNH, Peter named a new species of algae in honor of Professor Baker, and recently hosted a tribute to Professor Mathieson at the Northeast Algal Symposium in April 2023. Rich Huss for the last 10 years ran a German automation company called Festo out of Long Island. He recently finished a two-year consulting contract with them and moved to the Tampa, Florida area, now fully retired. Festo provided components for automating machinery in high volume manufacturing for the semiconductor, assembly, automotive, packaging and lab automation markets. He previously held a similar position with a division of Robert Bosch corporation in Chicago where he had spent most of his life. He has been married for almost 41 years to Tina. They have two children, one grandson and another grandchild on the way all living in Chicago. He would love to hear how others are doing in their lives. Donna Davidge still lives in NYC in the winters and in northern Maine in the summer operating a yoga retreat in her ancestral home there since 1997. No other real news, she says. Her websites are: sewallhouse.com and donnadavidgeyoga.com.\n\n1977\n\nGerri King, who earned her master’s, CAGS and Ph.D. from UNH, is a social psychologist and organizational consultant who works throughout the U.S. and, occasionally, abroad. She is the author of “The Duh! Book of Management and Supervision: Dispelling Common Leadership Myths.” Gerri reports that she plans to semi-retire when she’s 102 because her work is so satisfying. She lives in Concord. Mary Ellen Myles Halliwell and a creative team of women initiated a fascinating public art project in Salem, Massachusetts: “The Lady of Salem Maritime Public Art Exhibition.” Over the last decade, 26 figureheads of women, “the ladies,” are displayed throughout downtown Salem. In non-literate societies, figureheads are used to identify ships. Carved from wood and placed at the bow of a ship, figureheads were considered the “eyes of the ship,” warding off evil and guiding the captain and crew into safe harbor. Unlike the figureheads on ships, the Salem Ladies are 33 feet tall and made of polyurethane molded foam. Marilyn Proulx originally from Manchester, moved to Fort Myers, Florida, in 1987 where she worked as a school social worker for 18 years. Marilyn is especially proud of the book she wrote in 2015 about the death of her daughter, “Christianity Is Easy Until Disaster Strikes.” Marilyn became a grandmother three years ago, which she feels is one of the biggest blessings in her life. Doug Cotanche is living on St. Kitts in the Caribbean and teaching at the University of Medicine and Health Sciences. He’s the director of the human anatomy and human neuroanatomy courses, and reports that life on the island is good and he still doesn’t miss the snow. Bernard Roy writes that he looks forward to seeing the magazine when he and Kim get back from Kauai. Last year was a busy one for the couple: after wintering in Florida, they went on a cruise from Istanbul to Venice with stops in various ports in Turkey, Greece, Croatia, Monte Negro and Venice with their three children and their respective fiancées. “Kim and I stopped in Ireland for a week on way back to USA. Retired so why not?” In September they drove from their home base in Michigan to Newfoundland (the last seven hours aboard a ship to the island). “I went moose hunting and got one within the first hour of hunting. Our ferry off the island was interesting in that we were able to get on the last ferry before a hurricane hit. After getting home, we flew to Telluride, Colorado, where my oldest daughter got married. Then only four months later in February I got to walk my second daughter for her wedding in Grand Rapids, Michigan. A busy 12 months for us!”\n\n1978\n\nHi all! I have relocated to the Lakes Region of New Hampshire. What glorious sunsets! I do a bit of tutoring and supervise student teachers from Plymouth University. I love my two part-time jobs. Christopher Wood wrote in to share this news: “After 38 years of practicing law in California, I retired April 30, 2022, from the partnership at Husch Blackwell, LLP’s Oakland office. I live at Lake Tahoe in Incline Village, Nevada. I’ve been appointed by the Washoe County commissioner to the Citizens Advisory Board and the Tahoe Transportation Districts Committee Incline Village Hub. I am active in local politics and a member of Rotary. I hike with the Tahoe Trampers and others including taking the challenge to hike over the Carson Range 21 miles (3,500-ft. elevation gain) with the recently elected Nevada secretary of state in an effort to replicate Mark Twain’s early 1860s travel to Lake Tahoe to become a lumber baron.” So, classmates, tell me what are your dream retirement locations? Are you pursuing employment in a new career? Are you participating in something you love? Send me your news as I would love to hear from you.\n\nDoug Lenz ’79G with wife Karin in Olympic National Park, Washington.\n\n1979\n\nJamie Dammann ’79G was recognized with the 2022 John H. Lambert Forest Stewardship award, given annually to people who have made long-term contributions to the conservation of state forests in Massachusetts. As the leading procurement forester of New England Renewable Power Fitchburg, LLC, Dammann has created long-lasting relationships with local foresters and timber harvesters to provide New England consumers with affordable wood-fueled electricity. Dammann was a key contributor in establishing the Massachusetts Forest Alliance in 2012. “The idea of the alliance is to promote local woods and local goods, buying local wood, and promoting good Forestry and Forest Stewardship, which basically means taking care of the forest,” he told The Gardner News newspaper. Linda Calvin-Pineda shares some updates: “I have been an RN for 42 years. I retired last year to start my journey in skincare. My husband, Alex, and I had an addition built onto our home and I opened SkinVest Aesthetics on March 1. To all my nursing colleagues from 1979 graduation class, I honor you and give my highest regards for your integrity, compassion and knowledge. My wishes are for you and your loved ones to be healthy and happy. To Abbey and Kim: I think of you often. Thank you, UNH, for my education.” Doug Lenz writes, “I am recently retired as of this year after a career as a chemical process engineer, entrepreneur, company president and lastly, chief scientist.” Doug is married with three kids, and they all love to travel — one of their favorite vacation spots is the Finger Lakes wine region in New York. “I am an active outdoorsman who loves hiking, snowshoeing, backpacking, kayaking and canoeing, including being an Adirondack 46er (climbed all 46 4,000-foot peaks, soon to climb them all in the winter too!). My wife, Karin, and I love history and we live in an historic brownstone in Troy, New York, where HBO is currently filming ‘The Gilded Age.’”\n\nLeft to Right: Twice as nice: Bernard Roy ’77 and wife Kim celebrate two daughters’ weddings: the first in Telluride, Colorado, and the second in Grand Rapids, Michigan.\n\n1980\n\nMeg Cowan writes that she recently retired as executive director of the Newport Opera House here in the Granite State. Built in 1886, the historic community-based theater brings quality, affordable entertainment to the area. Meg managed to keep it vital during the pandemic: “It was an interesting time for sure and we were shut down for a year and half,” she shares. “It’s a tall order trying to keep a nonprofit theater alive when there is no audience. We managed, and I’m happy to report it is still going strong.” You can take a tour with Meg these days in her new job, pursuing her lifelong passion of New Hampshire tourism as a “step-on” tour guide for the White Mountains Attractions Association or manning a booth for them at travel shows in the off-season. We hear from Carolyn Avery after 31 years as a pediatrician. Retirement finds her keen on doing fine art painting. Accomplished at that, she’s even won a couple of first place awards in local competitions near her home in the Washington, DC, suburbs. You can find most of her paintings on Instagram, @claverly111. Carolyn stays busy these days by stirring up good trouble with political groups and church. Her sister still lives in Durham, so she’s back frequently. She notes that campus has changed a lot since the days she was a student and volunteering with the ambulance crew, but the town not so much. And nothing beats a New England summer! Suzan Messina has lived in Windham for 38 years with husband, Peter Ohanian, their children and Italian greyhound. They love to travel visiting warm spots like the Cayman Islands, and frequently visit Florida. Her business, The Law Offices of Suzan Messina, specializes in real estate. She is also the vice president of her local garden club who strives to provide public service and scholarships. A visit to campus by Doug King led to a chance encounter with Willy Ryan ’79 last summer. Doug tells us Willy was working as assistant manager at the local Dunkin’ Donuts and says it was good to catch up and reminisce about UNH in the late ’70s. Doug also caught the UNH women’s club lacrosse team playing UVM that weekend, what a great club program! Donna Keefe Shannon ’78 wrote to tell us her sister, Marcia Keefe, originally from Manchester, passed away October 31, 2022, at Maine Medical Center after a sudden illness. Marcia earned a bachelor’s degree in early childhood education and resided in Maine most of her adult life, living in Alfred and later in Saco. She taught in the Alfred School District for 20 years before moving to Saco where she was a medical secretary for 12 years. Marcia loved living near Ferry Beach. She leaves behind two sons, one granddaughter, her husband and four siblings. Sadly, many other classmates have passed away recently.

For those who haven’t been back to the Durham/Portsmouth area in a while, this is an excellent opportunity to connect with longtime friends and see the many upgrades to the UNH campus. We’re planning Friday night festivities in Portsmouth on the Friday night of that weekend, and a day/evening of fun in Durham on Saturday, wrapping up with a farewell brunch in Durham on Sunday. You don’t have to wait until next year to begin connecting with everyone; start right now by joining the Planning Committee. Whether you live near or far from UNH, there is something you can help with, including classmate outreach, finding venues and caterers or getting sponsors. Do you own a business or know someone who might like to help underwrite one or more of the reunion events? Sponsors are well-recognized in reunion-related communications. The 35th Big ’80s Reunion had more than 500 people in attendance and more than $20,000 in sponsorship support. With your help, these classmates aim to top that! To join the planning committee, contact Robin Schell ’84 at rschell@jjwpr.com or John Davis ’85 at johncdavis@comcast.net. Sponsors should also contact John Davis. Remember to join the reunion Facebook group “UNH Classes of 1983-84-85-86 Reunion” for the latest information.\n\n1981\n\nLet’s try another question to jog memories of our time at UNH. Where was your favorite place to eat or drink — and what was your favorite menu item? Or there’s still time to answer the first question: Which faculty member influenced/inspired you most — and why? Please take just five minutes to send me an email with your answer to one of these questions — and news about family, travels, volunteer activity or career. Leslie Bruce Rintoul recently retired and is living close to family and friends in Oakville, Ontario. L. Allen Brown is a gemologist-GIA at All That Glitters in Methuen, Massachusetts. The 40+-year-old company is an international importer/faceter of quality gemstones, specializing in fine-faceted colored gemstones. We were saddened to learn of the deaths of two classmates. Melaney L. Chamberlain died on August 3, 2021, and Kenneth R. Dudzik died on January 16, 2023. Our condolences to their families and friends. Again, please take just a few minutes to drop me a line. Your UNH friends REALLY do want to hear from you.\n\n1982\n\nI’d like to take a moment to thank Deborah Narinkevicuis Overdeput for her continued outreach. Deborah, chief marketing officer for Chief Outsiders and chairwoman for the Homeland Heroes Foundation, resides in Salem with her husband, Hugo. At the time of this writing, they were expecting their first grandchild. My husband, Mike ’83, and I had the pleasure of traveling to Arizona this winter, where we met up with fellow alums Adrian Meehan ’81 and Lisa Meehan ’85. We explored the stunning beauty of the southwestern desert, and their son even showed us around the University of Arizona, which is a tad larger than our beloved UNH. We also had the opportunity to catch up with our friend Rick Groleau ’80, who now lives in Tucson with his wife and two children while working as an academic advisor for Southern New Hampshire University. It was a much-needed break from the cold of New Hampshire. Do you have exciting travel plans for the rest of 2023? Will you be meeting up with old friends from your time at UNH? I would love to hear your news for the next column. Lastly, I would like to extend a warm welcome to our newest UNH alumni, my nephews Casey Lewis ’22 and Mathew Lewis ’22. Congratulations on your successful time at UNH, and we can’t wait to see where your futures take you.\n\nSharon Runge ’83, center, and Lindsey Burns ’83, right, in Kenya.\n\n1983\n\nMary McDonough Perkins and her husband, Steve Perkins live in both Alton Bay and Lincoln. She sent a photo of a mini-class reunion at The Refinery in Andover in April 2022 where they had dinner with Donna Boynton Daigle and her husband, Dan, who live in Brentwood and Donna Walls Carroll and Mark Carroll ’82 who live in Londonderry. They are all enjoying retirement! Art Ayre writes that he enjoyed his classes and professors at UNH where he received an award for writing from the Whittemore School of Business (he also had a work-study job in the greenhouses which turned out to be quite hot in the summer). He moved to Oregon right after graduation. Art has worked as a budget manager for the Oregon Department of Justice, as well as a research analyst and economist with state employment security, social services and economic development agencies. He is currently retired and lives in Salem, Oregon, with his wife, and they enjoy camping in all his newly acquired free time. Christine Nadar Waldren has been living in Marco Island, Florida, since 1985 and began selling real estate in 1988. Her two children, Michael and Farrah, have joined her at Re/Max Affinity Plus. She is part of a group of only 7 percent of Realtors named a 2023 five-star real estate agent for providing excellent customer service in the southwest Florida real estate market. Mark Neisser, also known as Mark Nizer in the entertainment world, is controller of creative entertainment at Active Media Group, and writes he is still performing his one-man show full-time which ranges from original comedy, juggling, movement, music and technology in venues around the world including The Improv, The Comedy Store, Walt Disney World, college campuses and cruise lines.

He was recently the featured speaker at the DisruptHR Charlottesville event on the future of work and culture. Sharon Runge is the U.S. executive director of Kenya Connect, a nonprofit organization that empowers rural communities to harness the benefit of education to drive sustainable development; Lindsey Burns is a member of the board of trustees. They recently traveled to Kenya to promote their mission of engaging and empowering students and teachers in rural Kenya to succeed in the 21st century by promoting economic sustainability and the independence of local communities. Lindsey brought more than 3,000 pairs of donated girls’ underwear with her as part of the Wings Poa Reusable Sanitary Pads kits to distribute to young women to prevent them from missing school due to menstruation. They are also providing menstrual health and hygiene information. Marti Nyman writes that in 2019 he was recruited to be the CEO of NDC Technologies, a leading global provider of intelligent connected measurement and process control solutions. After leading the company for three years, he oversaw the company’s sale to Nordson Corporation, expanding their testing and inspection platforms. As Marti wasn’t quite ready to retire, he then went on to accept the position of president and CEO of New Wave Design and Verification, a military aerospace technology company located in Eden Prairie, Minnesota. Marti and his wife, Carolyn, have three children and enjoy golf, skiing and traveling.\n\nFrom left to right, Steve Perkins ’83 and Mary (McDonough) Perkins ’83, Donna (Boynton) Daigle ’83 and Dan Daigle, Donna (Walls) ’83 and Mark Carroll ’82 get together at the Refinery in Andover, in April 2022.\n\n1984\n\nMark Syracusa ended his community service role as a volunteer firefighter in New Castle after 19 years.

Rich Roedner and Dorrie (Clairmont) Roedner wrote that they moved to North Carolina in January 2020 after 34 years in Maine. Rich accepted the position of town manager for Elon, North Carolina, just in time for COVID to strike! They survived the transition, and the pandemic, and are now enjoying life “without seven months of New England winter.” In their spare time, they enjoy working on their house, exploring North Carolina and tending to their three rescue pups. Nancy Brockman, let me know that she “finally put her English major to good use.” She realized a long-time dream of publishing her first book in a series of children’s stories called “Naughty Dogs at Woo Woo Junction.” Find out more at woowoojunction.com. Clark Cole wrote that he is still living in the San Francisco Bay area after moving there in 2002. He married UNH alum Dina Hondrogen ’86 in 2005 and they have two kids, ages 16 and 13. He is in software product management now, but “slips in music whenever he can.” After cooking for the New Hampshire Gentlemen during college, he now sings baritone in an a cappella church choir which he says gives him exposure to a wide range of music. He has passed on his alto sax to his son and enjoys volunteering with scouting to get outdoors on weekends. We’d like to recognize these classmates who have recently passed away: Joanne Lamb Arsenault (January 15, 2023); Joyce D. Costello Cullins (January 31, 2023); James A. Draper (November 11, 2022); Raymond E. Fearnley (October 19, 2022); Garrett B. Keay (January 18, 2023) and Rexford A. Lewis (December 1, 2022).\n\n1985\n\nCarla Panciera shares her exciting news about her fourth book: “My new book, ‘Barnflower: A Rhode Island Farm Memoir,’ was published this April by Loom Press in Amesbury, Massachusetts. I was initially interested in attending UNH because it had both a great English Department and a dairy herd. I did take a couple animal science classes, but I’m most grateful for all that I learned about writing there,” she says. Carla, thanks for sharing your great news and such a wonderful compliment to our UNH faculty! Heidi (Wiberg) Hastings emailed me this past fall: “I received my bachelor’s degree in business administration with a concentration in finance from ‘WSBE’ (the old Whittemore School of Business and Economics) and received my MBA from Northeastern in 1990. I recently retired from working in finance for 38 years for various high-tech companies including Raytheon, Sybase (software), and Teleflex (medical devices). My high school sweetheart, Gary Hastings ’84, and I celebrated our 35th wedding anniversary in October — Gary proposed in 1986 on the banks of Mill Pond in Durham while visiting the campus. We have three adult children: Kyle, Jackson ’20 and Allison. I keep in touch with my Jessie Doe roommates and dorm friends. Now that we’re retired, we plan on getting back to Durham and the beautiful UNH campus more often!”\n\n1986\n\nSpeaking of 40th reunions, in my last column I had mentioned looking forward to my 40th high school reunion. Priscilla Downey Thoma, Teresa Varga Kilday ’87, and the rest of the reunion committee hosted a marvelous event. It’s amazing to me that the words to those old songs come back to us, effortlessly. I thoroughly enjoyed catching up with everyone present. Did you attend your high school reunion with some UNH classmates? Be sure to send a note about it. It doesn’t matter if it was a year ago. We still want to see the photos and read the stories. I was excited to get news from a few classmates. Carolyn Gulbankian writes that after working for Avery Dennison and a few high-tech companies, she followed her heart to take over her family’s business, Gulbankian Farms Garden Center and Florist Shop, in Southborough, Massachusetts (they’re on Facebook and Instagram.) She truly loves being a floral designer and working with plants and flowers to provide joy and comfort to people. Managing a small business has provided flexibility to raise a family, be independent, and use her Whittemore School of Business and Economics (now the Peter T. Paul College of Business and Economics) marketing skills to offer instructional workshops. Some of her favorite memories of UNH are the fragrant lilac bushes in full bloom on the path to the library and the weaving loom filled with gorgeous colors and designs in the Paul Creative Arts Center window. She also remembers the theme dinners in the dining hall, especially when it was artichoke night; it was the first time she had ever eaten a steamed artichoke! Carolyn would like to reconnect with classmates and especially with marketing professor Nancy Hansen, if anyone has contact information. John Wezowicz writes that he has been a member of the Mechanical Engineering Department Advisory Board for a while and visits campus at least twice a year, once for the board meeting and again to judge the seniors’ Undergraduate Research Conference. Last year, he ran into David Hall while in Durham. At the 2022 UNH Alumni & Student Tennis Tournament David was lucky enough to win with partner Kennedy McGrath ’25 against two other students. John is an avid UNH hockey fan. On the career front, after graduating UNH, John went to work at Portsmouth Naval Shipyard and then Texas Instruments in Attleboro, Massachusetts, which became Sensata Technologies in 2006. He retired in 2019 as their engineering director. After six months of getting projects done around the house, he went back to work at TPI Composites in Warren, Rhode Island, to lead the automotive design engineering team. John and Lisa (Fortini) ’84 bought a place in Hope, Maine, on Lermond Pond with the early retirement proceeds and are renovating it. They are hoping to spend summers there when they finally retire (again). John would like to connect with any UNH alums who are in that area during the summers. Beth Hansen has been living in Katy, Texas, since 2011. After spending many years as a stay-at-home mom, Girl Scout leader, volunteer for the Hydrocephalus Association, and owning an insurance agency, she now works remotely as the human resources manager for Claims Resolution Corporation in Galloway, New Jersey. She is proud to announce that her daughter, Alexa Hansen ’21, was the fourth generation of their family to graduate from UNH (December) and is now attending the University of Texas for her master’s in information privacy and security. We’ve learned of the passing of five precious classmates; look for their names in the In Memoriam section of this issue. Perhaps you have a remembrance you can share.

I have a bit of news to share. Stephanie Norton Nadolny writes that she and her husband have relocated to Honolulu and she is the president and CEO of the Rehabilitation Hospital of the Pacific. Prior to this role, she was the vice president of operations of Spaulding Rehab on Cape Cod and worked there most of her career. She and her husband, Eddie, raised their two children on the Cape and planned to retire there until the amazing opportunity in Hawaii came up. Carrie Keating Griffiths also wrote in that she is living in the New Hampshire Seacoast with her husband, Charlie, and when they are not working, they get away to ski and hike with their grown children in the White Mountains. Carrie works in Boston as the chief communications officer for Veolia, the world’s largest environmental company. I also had the chance to connect with Craig Dikeman recently. Craig is now the director of procurement at Eversource and travels to several offices throughout New England. Craig and his wife, Kim, live in Pepperell, Massachusetts, but spend a lot of time in Vermont, skiing, golfing and enjoying the outdoors. Please continue to share your news — I look forward to hearing from everyone!\n\n1988\n\nGreetings! Hope you’re having a great summer. Don’t forget: Homecoming Weekend is October 13-15. Hope to see many of you! Another successful “news requesting” email blast brings the following: Deb Richards Thibodeau presented at the Maine Counselor Conference in April about cultural competence and gardening in a school counseling program — expertise she was excited to share. Karl Leinsing married Amy McMath in August 2022.

If you’d like to serve in the role, collecting updates from classmates and writing a column twice a year for the magazine, please be in touch via email: Classnotes.editor@unh.edu. In the meantime, some news from classmates: The girls of “3C” Christensen Hall reunited for their annual gathering in Boston on the first Saturday in April. This is a tradition that has been ongoing for about the past ten years. Angie (Newhard) Smith, Mary-Jo (Aletto) Cameron, Kathleen (Burke) Murray, Allison (Cohen) Rubin (also ’00G), Stephanie (Morgan) Havener, Maureen (McAlpin) Moreau, Tricia (Kennedy) Padula, and Melissa (Silveria) Turner — also ’90G — live in one of the New England states (Massachusetts, Rhode Island, Maine and New Hampshire) and are all married and with child(ren). Careers in education, real estate, technology, and healthcare put their UNH degrees to great use. The annual overnight boasts tales of the first girl keg party in Christensen, partying with Sig Ep, the blizzard ride to the mall dentist, and many other memorable times at UNH. The group hopes to hear from Karen (Bagley) Perry and Karen (Schmit) Adams. Mike Eliasberg has joined the exciting world of restaurant hospitality. If you are ever in Portsmouth stop in for some outstanding service at either Surf or Mojos West End Tavern. Colleen Petty took a trip back to UNH in February. “College touring with my 16-year-old daughter. I was stunned to be with some 200 other families taking the UNH tour on that day! I was also stunned by the growth of the campus (new facilities)! While in the Boston area I was able to spend quality time with my female bestie Jane Deery. I still keep up with my male bestie Chris Braune ’90 (AKA “Brawny”). He is doing great with his family in New Jersey. I am trying to locate Sean McCarthy, last known in Worcester area) if anyone has a way, or if he reads this hit me up on LinkedIn, please!” Peter Simmons has started the position of alumni president at Pi Kappa Alpha, Gamma Mu chapter at the University of New Hampshire. Before that he served as mayor and councilman for the city of Bonita Springs, Florida. Dan Rinden writes, “Life has been busy! I have just moved into the deputy CFO position for New Hampshire Hospital. I am retiring from the NH Air National Guard after 20 years. My older son is a junior at UNH studying ocean engineering and is in ROTC. My younger son graduates from high school in June and will be entering the freshman class at UNH.” And Debbie Davis Eisenach lives in northern Germany after having spent many years in Berlin and in Singapore. She is the director of international marketing for a global school website provider. She is most proud of her three children who, having grown up abroad, returned to the U.S. to study and work. She and her husband enjoy cycling throughout Europe. Several of her coworkers’ children attend UNH so she gets her updates via them! Paul Murphy (San Jose, California) reports that he has become the treasurer of the Alex Manfull Fund, a foundation created by Paul’s UNH Psychology Professor Susan Newman Manfull in honor of her daughter Alex, who was lost to a relatively unknown disorder called PANDAS in 2018. Paul and Susan have remained friends since graduation, and he was glad to step up to support the foundation, which supports awareness and research to further understand post-infectious neuroimmune disorders with an emphasis on their manifestation in adolescents and young adults. Paul and Susan planned to be in DC on June 3 for the Inaugural 5k Run/Walk to raise funds for the foundation. Paul also let me know he has reconnected with Steve Ciarametaro ’88 who runs the Ciara West Equestrian Ranch in Portola Valley where he provides equus coaching.

After years at McDonald’s corporation, I am now SVP of talent management for a consulting firm (The CARA Group) and Jim is a senior tax associate (Sassetti LLC). There is too much to share about our careers and life but sufficed to say it’s been a miraculous journey for these two Wildcats. We now have two teenage daughters and are just starting college planning for them! Time flies indeed!” News from Ian Story: “Greetings from Dubai. My big news is that we will be moving to Lima, Peru, from Bahrain in late summer. That will be my wife’s next U.S. embassy posting. I will be transferring to the SAP office in Lima as well (I just hit 22 years there). I am definitely going to have to learn Spanish for this next post.
