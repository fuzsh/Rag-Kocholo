The “servant leadership” ethic advanced by the forum enhances professionalism as it calls for sharing power and helping others develop and perform to the best of their ability.\n\n**Applicants must be in good standing with the Alabama State Bar and have practiced law at least 5 years and no more than 15 years as of January 1, 2024 (based upon first admission to any state bar).
