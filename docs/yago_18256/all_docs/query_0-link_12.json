        "text": "Jo Ann Baccaglio Fowler, January 22, 1937 – August 10, 2024\n\nJo Ann Baccaglio Fowler left this earth peacefully, joining her loved ones in heaven. Born in San Francisco to Joseph and Margaret Corcoran Baccaglio, she explored her grandparents’ halls and trails including Thomas and Emily Shirley Corcoran’s Agua Caliente Hotel and Mary and James Baccaglio’s Novato ranch. She graduated as the 1954 Salutatorian from Sonoma Valley High School, attended Mount Saint Mary’s University in Los Angeles, and earned her Bachelor’s degree from San Francisco State College. Jo Ann was an educator for 39 years and a beloved wife, mother, grandmother and great-grandmother.\n\nMarried to Gordon Fowler of Kenwood, Jo Ann moved to Fallbrook CA and dedicated her life to her faith, family, and teaching in Vista, CA elementary schools. Retiring to Sonoma, Jo Ann had leadership roles at Friends In Sonoma Helping (FISH), Delta Kappa Gamma Society for Women Educators, Sonoma Valley High School Alumni Association and as a Lector and Eucharistic Minister at St Francis Solano Church Sonoma.\n\nJo Ann knew how much she was loved, inspired us with the gratitude she felt for her life and wished you each the same. Jo Ann, Mom, Nan, we remember you as we met you – optimistic, open hearted, generous, and intrigued by the world. Thank you for your unwavering friendship and love.\n\nJo Ann is predeceased by her husband Gordon David Fowler in 2008. Jo Ann is survived by her children Mary Ann (Rob Burgess), Tom (Linda Fowler), Kathy (Robert Powers), Dan (Jeannie Fowler), Margaret (Phil Leonelli), Patrick (Mike King) and by her grandchildren Gordon (Katie Fowler), Bethany (Greg Amarra), Phil Leonelli (Dennise Venegas), Allison (Ryan Davis), Tim Leonelli (Katie Beckvold), J. Patrick Burgess, Maggie Powers, Jake (Lilli Fowler), Brigid Powers, Andrew Burgess, Tommy Fowler and by her great grandchildren Drew Candela, Georgia Fowler, Henry Fowler, Teddy Amarra, Brooklyn Davis, Melanie Amarra, and her nieces Denise (Ivor Horsfall), Audrey (Dave Flood), and by her nephew Duane (Shannon Sinclair) and by her dearest lifelong friends Virginia Valente Randall, Tony Salmon Rosasco and Jan Lockhart.\n\nVisitation will be held from 3:00 pm to 7:00 pm with a Rosary Vigil at 5:30 pm on August 28, 2024 at Duggan’s Mission Chapel, 525 W Napa St, Sonoma. A Requiem Mass will take place at 10:30 am on August 29th, 2024 at St Francis Solano Church, 469 3rd St W, Sonoma, with a reception following in Fr. Roberts Hall. Private interment will be at Holy Cross Catholic Cemetery, Colma.\n\nIn lieu of flowers, donations in Jo Ann’s memory can be made to St Francis Solano Church, Friends In Sonoma Helping (FISH), or your favorite charity. Links and details at Duggan’s Mission Chapel, Sonoma.\n\nLinda Sue Ledesma\n\nMay 10, 1948 ~ July 6, 2024\n\nLinda Sue Ledesma was born May 10, 1948, in Long Bach, California to Fred and Della Longstreet.\n\nThe family moved to Vista, California when Linda was eight years old.

He was always adventurous in his plight to make money. At two, he escaped from a fenced backyard and was found ½ a mile away trying to cross the busy Rosecrans Blvd. by his older sister and the police; he was returning bottles for the redemption money. Bruce also had fun playing board games and sometimes those Monopoly games would last for days! Later, he discovered his love for playing cut-throat Pinochle with his parents, sisters, aunts and uncles. He made you work hard at it if you planned to beat him!\n\nBruce moved to Vista from Bellflower, CA as a young boy with his family in 1971. He attended San Marcos High School, where he excelled in track and football. Soon after high school, he opened his own roofing business. But like his father and his older brother, he followed his life’s passion to fish for a living. To say Bruce was just a commercial fisherman would be understating his effect on the industry. Many fishermen admired and wanted to emulate his success. He had a calling to the ocean.\n\nIn-between fishing trips, he always made time to relax on his favorite beach in Ka’anapali on the island of Maui, HI or take in a quick show in Las Vegas. A must was the 6:45am Sunday morning football and “Bloodys” at the Westin beach bar. Bruce was an impressive person and very loyal to his family, friends and fishing. After his father’s 20-year hiatus from fishing, Bruce set him and his mother back up with a boat and basement apartment. Like his father, Bruce always had a story to tell; he was never lost for words and he could talk for hours. He had a welcoming smile and his laugh was infectious. But when it came time for business, everyone knew that too. Just ask one of his deckhands! He had a zest for life and he wasn’t afraid of hard work.\n\nBorn January 17, 1956 in Los Angeles, he was the third born of six children and the son of the late Jack and Lucy (Prickett) Campbell. He was also preceded in death by his older brother, Pete Campbell (a fisherman lost at sea) and brother-in-law, Lee Stewart. He is survived by his brother Wayne Campbell (also a fisherman) and wife Sonya of Valley Center, CA; his sisters Laura Campbell Stewart and fiancé James Frazer of Lakeville, MA; Ellen Campbell Scarborough and husband Glen of Texarkana, AR; Marlene Campbell and husband Ellis McDaniel of Fouke, AR; and 3 children Nicole, Anthony, and Adorah. Bruce also has 9 nieces and nephews (John Campbell, Rebecca Campbell, Carolyn Stewart Tubman, Donna Stewart Dach, Justin Gregory, Cody Campbell, Laken Scarborough, Lindee Scarborough, Ethan McDaniel) and 12 great nieces and nephews (Kenneth Tubman, Gabrielle Tubman, Madison Tubman, Hudson Dach, Cooper Dach, Dillon Calicher, Dalton Calicher, Darla Calicher, Dean Calicher, Dinah Calicher, Adam Hampton, Heathe Hampton) and many close cousins that could be called friends.\n\nBruce has touched so many lives and he will be truly missed by all that knew or loved him. His “Good morning,” texts and calls will be lovingly remembered and sadly missed. For now, “Good night,” my Brother Bruce, until we meet again.\n\nA celebration of his life will be announced at a later date.\n\nTerry Joe Stobbs passed away today 11/12/20 in Prescott Valley, AZ.He was born on Jan 22, 1935 in Milford, NE.

Pat was a strong independent woman, who was also incredibly supportive and ready with advice and help.\n\nMoving to Arcata allowed Pat to spend more time with family in the area, and to be closer as her great grandchildren grew up. She also supported and immersed herself in the performing arts, taking dance classes and attending any and every cultural event she could. She was fond of her close neighborhood, and happy while tending her sunny garden. Pat made several new friends in town and enjoyed hiking and exploring the North Coast with them.\n\nPat shared in the lives of many people and will be deeply missed by family and friends.
