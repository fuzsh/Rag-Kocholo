        "text": "Originally from Upstate New York, I studied classical liberal arts at Thomas Aquinas College in California and finished my undergraduate work at Nazareth College in Rochester, New York. I majored in English with certification in special education and elementary education. In addition, I completed a Masters degree in theology from the Franciscan University of Steubenville and a Master of Education (M.Ed.) in Educational Leadership from Trevecca Nazarene University here in Nashville.\n\nI entered the convent in 1984 and in the years since that time, I have benefited from the joyful living of religious life as a Dominican Sister of St. Cecilia (www.nashvilledominican.org), along with a variety of experiences in the apostolate.\n\nAfter ten years of teaching in a wide variety of grade levels (primary, junior high and high school), I served as principal at St. Thomas Aquinas Reginal School outside of Washington, DC and also at Overbrook School in Nashville.\n\nI also had the privilege of serving as the vocation director for our sisters and worked in our initial formation program with our youngest sisters.\n\nPrior to coming to Saint Rose, I was the Director of Advancement for Overbrook School and St. Cecilia Academy, where I oversaw building projects, fundraising, alumnae relations and public relations.\n\nWith 36 years in the field of education, I come to you filled with the conviction that with all that is wrong in the world, it is at places like Saint Rose that we can begin to set things right. Where Christ is at the heart and center of our lives, a wonderful unity forms that has a power like none other. It is a power that brings together our families, our school and our parish where together we live in the light of God’s love.\n\nI am originally from Hendersonville, North Carolina. My family moved to middle Tennessee when I was in 3rd grade. I attended Catholic schools from K-4th grade and again in high school (Father Ryan). I received my Bachelors of Science in Special Education from the University of Tennessee in 1992 and then my Masters in Elementary Education from Trevecca University in 2008.\n\nI started teaching at Saint Rose in May of 2003. While here, I have taught Pre-K through 2nd grade as well as 7th-8th grade Performing Arts. I was also the director of the Preschool for 2 years. After 17 1/2 years of classroom teaching I accepted the Assistant Principal position in January of 2021.\n\nI have 3 adult children who all attended Saint Rose Catholic School. My older 2, Chandler and Mary Kate, attended from Kindergarten through 8th grade, and my youngest, Hannah, was here from the 2 year old class through 8th grade.\n\nI have never once considered working here as a \"job\" but as being a part of a family. Saint Rose is an amazing place where I see Christ in others every single day.\n\nI am originally from Louisiana. I graduated from Nicholls State University in Thibodaux, Louisiana in 2003 with a Bachelor’s Degree in Vocal Music Performance with a concentration in Education. I later earned my Master’s Degree in Education specializing in Instruction and Curriculum from Middle Tennessee State University. While in Louisiana, I taught in public and Catholic schools at the elementary and high school level.\n\nIn 2008 my husband and I moved to Murfreesboro and I began working at Saint Rose the following year as a teacher aide in Kindergarten. Two years later I became the Language Arts teacher for 5th and 6th grade. Unfortunately, my husband’s job brought us back to Louisiana in 2013. Once back in Louisiana I taught middle school for two years at a local Catholic elementary school then became the Assistant Principal for the PK3 through 7th grade school. Now, I am back at Saint Rose as the Preschool Director.\n\nMy husband, Dean, and I married in 2007. We have two children: Adele and Jason, both students at Saint Rose School. Saint Rose has always held a special place in my heart and I am so happy to be back in this special place.\n\nI began working at Saint Rose School in 2005 as an assistant to the Athletic Director. I then spent time in the classroom as a Kindergarten Aide before moving into the position as the Director of Admissions. I love meeting new families and welcoming them to our school.\n\nI was born in New Jersey and moved to Tennessee when I was in the 5th grade. I attended Holy Rosary Academy and Saint Bernard Academy before obtaining a Bachelor of Science degree from the University of Tennessee - Knoxville.\n\nMy husband, Jim, and I have been married since 1991, and we have 4 children who all graduated from Saint Rose School.\n\nIt is a joy to be apart of the Saint Rose Community.\n\nI am a Middle Tennessee native, born and raised in Mount Juliet, TN, and I moved to Murfreesboro in 2010. I earned my Bachelor of Science in Nursing from Cumberland University in 2008 and my Doctorate in Nursing Practice, focusing on family nurse practice, from Belmont University in 2016. I was honored to be the first recipient of the Frist Global Health Fellowship at Belmont University, which funded my doctoral project aimed at reducing maternal and infant mortality in developing countries. This project involved training healthcare providers around our sister parish in Haiti in a method of natural family planning, a contribution I am immensely proud of.\n\nSaint Rose of Lima Catholic Church has played a significant role in my life journey. In 2010, I met Brandon, and after our engagement, we embarked on a journey to find a church for our wedding. Raised in a non-denominational Christian household, and Brandon raised Catholic, we discovered Saint Rose of Lima. I attended my first ever Mass in October 2011 and felt a profound calling to the Catholic Faith. On Easter 2012, I was received into full communion and confirmed in the Catholic Church. Brandon and I were married here at Saint Rose in 2012, and he served as the youth minister from 2011 – 2014, where we made many lifelong friends.\n\nProfessionally, I began my career as an ICU nurse. After graduating with my FNP degree, I worked as a pediatric nurse practitioner in Shelbyville for 18 months, then as a family nurse practitioner at Ascension St. Thomas Medical Partners - New Salem for nearly six years. I took a break from my career to spend more time with my two boys, Liam and Aidan, who attend Saint Rose School. This new chapter in our lives laid the foundation for me to take on the role of administrative assistant and school nurse. While this is a new role for me, I am excited about the opportunity to be more involved in my children's school and our parish.\n\nI am a Marvel and Harry Potter fan and an enthusiastic LEGO collector, with our home mostly decorated with various LEGO creations. Our two Icelandic Sheepdogs, Kylo and Nova, keep us active. I cherish quality time with my family, playing board games, and embracing life's joyful moments.\n\nI approach my work and life with the same values, striving for peace, harmony, and a deep connection with those around me. I am committed to providing excellent care and support to the students and staff at Saint Rose of Lima School, ensuring a healthy, nurturing environment for our community.\n\nRetired from State Farm, Bill brings a wealth of skills and experience, both from his career and from his background in coaching different youth sports. A member of the Knights of Columbus, Bill has also served on the Saint Rose Parish Council.\n\nBill has a wide variety of experience as both an athlete and as a coach.

His children attended Saint Rose School through the 8th grade and all of them participated in a number of sports and went on to play varsity sports in high school.\n\nI am originally from Michigan, but have called Tennessee home for over twenty years. My husband, Chuck, and I have been married for over twenty-five years. We have three children: Theresa, Chuck III, and Thomas.\n\nPrior to moving to Murfreesboro, I taught preschool and parish religious education at Good Shepherd. I also served as Director of Religious Ed for two years at Good Shepherd.\n\nAfter my youngest son graduated from high school in 2018, my husband and I relocated to Murfreesboro from Franklin County. I began working at Saint Rose School in the preschool and extended care in the fall of 2018. This school year, I will be teaching full-time in the three-year-old classroom.\n\nIn my free time, I enjoy spending time with my family. Some of my hobbies include reading, gardening, hiking, and cross stitch. I feel blessed to be a part of the Saint Rose community!\n\nI am originally from Green Bay, Wisconsin. My family moved to Chattanooga, TN in 2005, then relocated to Murfreesboro in 2019. I have been married since 1995 to my husband, Jay and we have two beautiful daughters, Marissa ad Carley. Both girls are now grown and married and I am now looking forward to one day holding the title of grandmother.\n\nI hold a bachelors degree in both Human Development and Psychology from the University of Green Bay. I have worked with children in a variety of roles, and have over 10 years of experience as a preschool teacher. I began teaching in 2020 at St. Rose in the 3 year old preschool classroom. In 2022, I made the difficult decision to work strictly as a substitute for St. Rose. I am now returning to the 3 year old preschool classroom where my true heart belongs.\n\nIn my free time, I enjoy spending time with my family, playing cards, traveling and reading.\n\nI am looking forward to teaching in the preschool classroom and meeting all the littles and their families.\n\nI graduated from MTSU with a Bachelor's of Science in Psychology and a Minor in Criminology in 2017. I began pursuing a Masters in Clinical Psychology in August 2017, but switched to education after feeling a strong desire to be in the classroom. I graduated, again from MTSU, in December 2020 with a Masters in Curriculum Instruction with Initial Licensure and started as a Pre-K teacher at Saint Rose in January 2021.\n\nI have been married to my wonderful husband, Luke, since June 2018, and we have we have two amazing girls named Hazel and Josephine. We have been parishioners of Saint Rose since 2015, and I was so happy to start working at the school when a position opened up after I graduated with my masters. In my free time I love to read, run/weight lift, spend time with Hazel and Josephine, crochet, and do calligraphy!\n\nI feel so blessed to be a part of the Saint Rose family. From the moment I started here as a teacher I felt so welcomed by the faculty, parents, and students. I couldn't be more excited to be a teacher, and look forward to never having to work a day in my life.\n\nI am originally from Melbourne Beach, Florida where my family still lives. I graduated from the University of Florida with a Bachelor's degree in Communication Sciences and Disorders and a minor in Education. In the years prior to entering the Dominican Sisters of St. Cecilia, I worked as a high school and middle school youth minister in California and Illinois. Along with my certification in elementary education, I have a Masters in Theology from Franciscan University of Steubenville and training in Catechesis of the Good Shepherd. The greatest gift I have received from God is my calling to be a religious sister, and His bride!\n\nI enjoy being outside, cooking, reading, and being with my sisters. I have taught for 12 years, 10 of those years in 2nd grade.\n\nIt is such a joy for me to be with the children and families at our schools as we all strive for happiness and holiness each day. I am excited and privileged to be teaching 2nd grade at St. Rome of Lima.\n\nI was born and raised in Lemoore, CA on a sheep ranch. Although growing up in a farming community allowed me to develop a life-long passion for agriculture, I’ve always known I wanted to be an educator. I completed my undergrad in San Luis Obispo, where I received my BA in Liberal Studies. I later moved to San Jose, CA to earn my teaching credential and MA in Education - curriculum and instruction. While in college, I taught preschool, Kindergarten and Fourth grade. I later returned to my hometown to teach Third Grade. My husband, our eldest son and I moved to Spring Hill, TN in 2020. I began working as a Reading Interventionist at College Grove Elementary. I taught here for one year. God then blessed us with two more children and I made the decision to stay home with them. In 2022, we moved to Murfreesboro and discovered St. Rose of Lima Catholic School, where I am excited to continue my teaching journey!\n\nMy husband, Marc, and I are parishioners of Saint Rose. We proudly send our son James (3 years old) St. Rose of Lima School and look forward to our twins, Thomas and Henry (2 years old) starting in Fall 2023.

Motherhood/family time, growing in my faith, teaching, baking and interior design are just a few of my favorite things!\n\nOriginally from Minnesota, Sr. Karol Marie joined the Dominican Sisters of St. Cecilia in 2005. Since that time she has taught multiple grade levels at a variety of schools in which her congregation serves but is thrilled to be returning to the Saint Rose community and has a particular love for the fourth grade. She earned her B.A. in Catholic Studies and Elementary Education with an endorsement in middle school mathematics from the University of St. Thomas and her M.A. in Thomistic Studies from the Dominican House of Studies in Washington, D.C. Sister has a deep love for both St. John Paul the Great for whom she is named and St. Thomas Aquinas, the angelic doctor. She enjoys walking, reading, coffee breaks, and spending time with the Sisters. Sister has deep gratitude for her religious vocation and sharing that joy with others!\n\nI grew up in San Antonio, TX surrounded by a big family, and I was blessed to be sent to Catholic Schools for most of my education. I have known I wanted to be a teacher since I was 10 years old. I graduated from Texas State University in San Marcos, earning a Bachelor Of Science in Interdisciplinary Studies with a Specialization in Reading. I spent the first six years of my profession teaching in the Dallas/Fort Worth area and spent most of that time teaching 4th graders. I married my husband in 1999 and we were moved to Memphis in 2001 by my husband's company, when our first born son Evan was only 1. We had our second son Jaden shortly after we settled in Memphis. I stayed home with my boys for 5 years. When Evan started Catholic School I had the opportunity to start a preschool within the Catholic School, and I was once again blessed with the Director's position there for 10 years.\n\nTime flies and we relocated to Murfreesboro in 2023, where both of my boys are, now in their early 20s. I felt drawn to come back to the classroom, and I decided to substitute teach at St. Rose. I immediately felt at home here.

All three graduated from Saint Rose School.\n\nMy hobbies are gardening and reading.\n\nEach week at Mass, we join with our preschool prayer partners.

I followed my kids to Saint Rose when my second oldest entered Kindergarten. I have loved teaching 3rd grade since 2007. It is my favorite because the students come in as little kids and leave as big kids. How lucky am I to be a part of this process?\n\nIn my free time, I enjoy running, reading, laughing with family and friends and watching my children play sports.\n\nMy favorite thing about teaching at Saint Rose is sharing the faith with my students and watching them grow up both in and out of school.\n\nI began teaching at Saint Rose in 2020!

As a young girl I dreamed of returning here one day to teach.\n\nFrom a young age I witnessed the many sacrifices my parents made in order for my eleven siblings and myself to attend Catholic schools.
