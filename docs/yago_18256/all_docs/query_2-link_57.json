        "text": "A Lawyer’s DNA\n\nPerhaps a sharper portrait of Leslie Ware the man, can be painted by taking a closer look at his father, Orlin Dale Ware (Dale passed way in 2014 after battling cancer).\n\nDale was born in Texarkana, earned his master plumbers license, was a member of Local Union 100, owned a commercial plumbing business and also assisted his son in developing real estate.\n\nExcerpts from an editorial published upon Dale’s retirement from the Coppell City Council, where he served from 1980 to 1988, describe his character, and perhaps help to illuminate that of his son:\n\n“Dale Ware feared no one. He took on developer and city manager alike when he disagreed with them. They might have had finer threads or speech, but not a finer mind.”\n\n“You could disagree and debate with Ware for hours (and most everyone did, because he is an opinionated guy!), but still remain friends. Arguments did not fall on deaf ears; he gave your opinion a chance.”\n\n“Perhaps the most significant characteristic of Ware was a maturity that allowed him to look beyond the pettiness and disagreements of today to the broader picture of friendship and caring of tomorrow. He knew how to forgive and accept and move on. With him, everyone always had a second chance.”\n\nEducation\n\nLeslie Ware was born and reared in Dallas, earning his undergraduate degree from SMU and his J.D. from the SMU Dedman Law School in 1992.\n\nUpon graduating, Ware went on to specialize in patent management, patent licensing, and patent litigation.\n\nDedman School of Law\n\nThe Dedman School, founded in 1925, was named in 2001 for its benefactors, Nancy and Robert H. Dedman and their family.\n\nThe Dedman Family\n\nThrough their decades long generosity, the Dedman family has brought to life some of the most recognizable and inspirational programs in the DFW area, including the Dedman School of Law, the Dedman College of Humanities and Sciences, and the Dedman Center for Lifetime Sports at SMU.\n\nThe family matriarch, Mrs. Nancy Dedman, was married to Robert H. Dedman Sr. for 49 years before his death in 2002 from a long-term illness (Mr. Dedman was 76):\n\n1950’s: Robert Sr. started his career as a lawyer, but soon after learning to play golf, decided to invest in golf courses instead\n\n1957: Dedman founded Country Clubs, Inc. (later renamed ClubCorp)\n\n1958: Country Clubs begins constructing Brookhaven Country Club — its first club\n\n2002: By the time of Robert’s death in 2002, ClubCorp had grown to become the leading operator of golf clubs with over 200 resorts in its portfolio.\n\n2006: Robert Dedman, Jr. sold ClubCorp in 2006, but the family retained Pinehurst Golf, which he has since transformed into a multi-sport resort\n\n“You don’t have to be a golfer to understand that the game involves keeping score, hoping to win and learning to lose.” — Robert Dedman Sr.\n\nAbout ClubCorp\n\nLaunched by Robert Dedman Sr in 1957, the company is currently owned by Apollo Global Management (a private equity firm, NYSE:APO), which took the country club operator private in 2017, in a deal valued at $1.1 billion.\n\nPrior to Apollo’s acquisition, from 2013 to 2017, ClubCorp traded publicly on the NYSE under the ticker MYCC.\n\nIn 2022, ClubCorp made the announcement that it was rebranding itself to ‘Invited’.\n\n“Invited is not just a name. It’s everything we are,” Invited CEO David Pillsbury said in a press release. “We want our members, guests and team members to know that Invited is where they belong.”\n\nDedman Residence\n\nMrs. Dedman, blessed by excellent health, is thankfully still with us, maintaining a home in the Volk Estates neighborhood of University Park.\n\nInspired by its ‘L’ shape lot, Mrs. Dedman’s home has one of the most stately and regal driveways in all of Park Cities.\n\nBusiness Endeavors\n\nSome of the business ventures Ware is currently involved in include Outlander Capital, PanOptis, Marconi Group and Crow Holdings.\n\n1. Outlander Capital\n\nOutlander Capital is an investment firm with investments spanning Blockchain, Technology, Entertainment, and Music.\n\n2. PanOptis\n\nEstablished in 2017, PanOptis is a patent acquisition and management firm.\n\nBy leveraging in-house patent management services, PanOptis is able to manage patent portfolios, while giving innovators time to focus on new development.\n\nThey accomplish this by identifying valuable patents in Client IP portfolios, and then marketing them to global businesses that utilize the technology.\n\n3. Marconi Group\n\nFounded in 2017, Marconi creates and supports premier IP licensing platforms with the goal of simplifying patent licensing across technologies and product areas.\n\nThe company is named after Guglielmo Marconi, an Italian inventor credited with creation of a wireless telegraph system. Marconi is recognized as the inventor of radio, and he shared the 1909 Nobel Prize in Physics with Karl Ferdinand Braun in recognition of their contributions to the development of wireless telegraphy\n\nThe company provides services and support to each of its platforms, including legal, finance, human resources, patent portfolio management, marketing and communications.\n\nMarconi Platforms include:\n\n“Ultimately, we’re focused on a better way forward for IP creation and licensing,” said Les Ware, cofounder of the Marconi Group. “Being part of the bigger ecosystem allows us to become more efficient, collaborate more effectively and reduce transactional cost for our licensees.”\n\n4. Crow Holdings\n\nWare serves on the board of directors for Crow Holdings.\n\nto learn more about the Crow Family, click here"
