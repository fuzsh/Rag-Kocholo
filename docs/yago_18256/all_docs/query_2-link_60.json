        "text": "WHERE IT ALL BEGAN\n\nI have always had a passion for art and remember my parents being extremely impressed with a drawing I had done as a child which featured figures in varying sizes to show the different distances they stood at. Having pleased them, I was eager to continue to make them proud!\n\nSince leaving school, I have had several jobs that mostly just passed the time for me. I took myself to a local college where I passed NC in Art and Design as the Student of the Year, a great honour for me. I continued on for another year to pass my HNC in Visual Communication.\n\nI began my artistic career thinking that illustration was were my heart lay, however, I adore animals and quickly discovered that I was good at drawing them. Coloured pencil pet portraits therefore seem to be my most popular item but I offer a whole range of artistic services including painted canvases, wall murals and book cover illustrations.\n\nI set up my business, Amy Leslie Artwork, in April 2017 and am enjoying this new challenge daily. I continue to strive to be the best that I can be and am always looking for new challenges to improve my skills so do not hesitate to get in touch with any artistic requests.\n\nA LITTLE ABOUT ME"
