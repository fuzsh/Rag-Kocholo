        "text": "July 31, 2024\n\n[This is my current “One Good Thing” newsletter, which you can find and subscribe to on Amydickinson.substack.com]\n\n[“Team Amy” — photo by Amy (2016)]\n\nI’ve spent the last few weeks in the company of my two granddaughters, who come to stay every year during the most fun portion of the summer.\n\nI’ll admit to trying to overload them with future MEMORIES of doing FUN THINGS while simultaneously learning LIFE LESSONS™️.\n\nIf you asked them what the most wonderful part of their stay has been, they’d probably skip over the MAGICAL MOMENTS created by yours truly and mention the most recent thing they did, which many days has involved a visit to the Frosty Cow — an ice cream shack located on the fringes of a cow pasture.\n\n(I don’t know about you, but I like to know where my ice cream comes from.)\n\n[In this case, a bunch of Holsteins]\n\nThis summer’s biggest LIFE LESSON™️ was delivered not by me, but by Simone Biles …\n\n… several days before her leadership of the American women’s gymnastic team led to an historic Olympic Gold for all of them.\n\nAfter I somewhat relentlessly bugged my granddaughters about the Olympics in advance of the opening of the Games, they said that they did not know much about the Olympics, so I gave them a quicky crash course into my biannual Olympic obsession (more on that later).\n\nI focused on Simone Biles for all of the obvious reasons — but mainly because she is overall amazing, and young girls should be inspired not only by her accomplishments but especially — by her spirit. I’m talking about the kind of strength it takes to be fully in charge of your life. I could be wrong, of course, but that’s how Simone strikes me.\n\nFortunately, there is a new documentary series (produced by Biles and streaming on Netflix), which not only outlines Simone Biles’ inspiring personal story, but — even more important — it tells the story of this athlete’s battle with “The Twisties.”\n\nYou don’t know what “The Twisties” are?\n\nI didn’t, either. But it is a term used in gymnastics where athletes completely lose the connection between their mind and body. This is an extremely dangerous phenomenon, certainly when you are in the midst of a soaring double-pike triple salchow mid-air split with a multiple tuck and twist dismount.\n\n(A move so daring and impossible, I have been forced to name it after myself.)\n\nThe Twisties are what happened to Simone Biles during the 2020 Tokyo Olympics.\n\nIn the middle of her Olympic vault, instead of doing one of the several spectacular moves so death-defying that they are named for her, Simone … choked. She was only able to complete a much lesser vault — stunning the crowd. And then, she further shocked the world by walking away from her team and her sport during the Olympics.\n\nSimone Biles has always possessed an almost supernatural body awareness, in that her mind and her body have been in near-perfect sync.\n\nBut then — mid-vault — Simone Biles’ mind suddenly lost track of what her body was doing. She had an attack of The Twisties. (Despite its somewhat cute name, this is a dreaded and extremely dangerous experience.)\n\nIn the film, experiencing The Twisties is described as being “broken.”\n\nHave you ever felt your own version of The Twisties?\n\nYeah — me too. Big time.\n\nSimone Biles was honest about her reasons for pulling out of the Tokyo Olympics four years ago (protecting her mental health), and she was criticized by many for letting her team down, and for “putting herself first.”\n\nParticularly nasty were the comments from a series of lardo loud-mouth radio sports “jocks,” who, as Simone remarks, “can’t do a cartwheel.”\n\nStill — the question hung in the air:\n\nWould Simone Biles attempt some sort of comeback?\n\nBefore coming back, this Greatest Of All Time athlete had to be brave enough to face a a workout comprised of a few minutes jumping on a trampoline, in the hopes of perhaps being airborne again at some point down the road.\n\nIn the film, we watch as she starts going back to the gym. She lays bare the raw terror she feels when doing the moves and routines she made famous.\n\nThis answered a long-held mystery for me:\n\nWhy aren’t these athletes terrified when they know that one wrong move could lead to serious injury, paralysis or death?\n\nIt turns out: They ARE!\n\nThat’s where their training comes in. Also, they seem to possess Gold Medal grit.\n\nUnfortunately, in addition to terror-avoidance, these athletes are also trained to stuff down their own problems, worries, and physical or psychic injuries. The film explores this reality in detail.\n\nParticularly sad (and still so shocking) is the disclosure that Simone Biles is a survivor of sexual abuse perpetrated by the former long-time Team USA gymnasts doctor and now convicted rapist Larry Nassar, who assaulted her during physical exams (he was convicted of sexually assaulting over 500 female gymnasts).\n\n[From Wikipedia: Lawrence Gerard Nassar (born August 16, 1963) is an American serial child rapist and former family medicine physician. For 18 years, he was the team doctor of the United States women’s national gymnastics team, where he used his position to exploit and sexually assault hundreds of young athletes.]\n\nSimone suggests that her attack of The Twisties is a trauma response to this long-repressed abuse, amplified by years of stoically stuffing it down. She never received therapeutic help because, as she says, “At the time, I thought I was OK.”\n\nAnd that is why I wanted my granddaughters to learn about Simone Biles.\n\nYes — Simone is a woman of color with an amazing and inspiring personal story performing at the highest-ever level in a traditionally “white” sport, but my granddaughters already know that women of color can excel at everything — because these girls are surrounded by great examples. (We’re looking at you, Kamala!)\n\nGood news, here, because to these younger girls, this particular LIFE LESSON feels as old as their granny.\n\nIn the film, however, we see how recent this breakthrough in gymnastics is, as well as the unique challenges these athletes continue to face.\n\n[For a great overview of the very recent ascendance of Black women in Olympic gymnastics — including lots of video highlights, check out this compendium, published by blackamericaweb.com CLICK HERE]\n\nI wanted Team Amy to see how it feels and what it might take to survive their own version of The Twisties.\n\nThey might learn from Simone’s example: Through authenticity, honesty, hard work, professional help, compassion, acceptance, familial love, personal support, and by accessing and unlocking that oftentimes deeply hidden quality I believe we all have within us.\n\nLet’s call it “the spirit of a champion.”\n\n[Team Amy … Outstanding in our field]]\n\nLIFE LESSON delivered, I took Team Amy out for ice cream, where I enjoyed my preferred version of The Twisties:\n\nWhat’s the degree of difficulty for taking an ice-cream selfie in the heat?\n\nEleven.\n\nI hope you are able to award yourselves perfect scores for whatever extreme challenges you encounter.\n\nLove,\n\nAmy\n\nMy final syndicated advice column\n\nWell, sports fans — my last syndicated “Ask Amy” advice column drops tomorrow (don’t you hate that expression?), and so I thought I would give you loyal subscribers a sneak peek at what I have to say.\n\nI’ve known this moment was coming for the last several months, and the need I’ve felt to try to deliver some final thoughts summing up my experience over the last 21 years has been pretty strong.\n\nTwo things tend to happen to me when I’m under pressure: First, I fantasize about quitting, and after that — my mind goes\n\nBLANK.\n\nAfter that, this is what I tell myself:\n\nI say ….\n\nNo one really cares.\n\nAnd then I push up my sleeves and try to get the job done.\n\nThis particular column was pretty daunting. I have been feeling very emotional, and I was writing it during a time when readers were already saying goodbye to me.\n\nWow — what a wonderful connection we have shared! Of course, that connection will continue, but through different channels (this being one), and through different work.\n\nRead on — and please do share your own thoughts and comments.\n\nDear Readers: Since announcing my departure from writing this syndicated column, I have heard from scores of people across various platforms, thanking me for over two decades of offering advice and wishing me well in my “retirement.” I am very touched and grateful for this outpouring of support.\n\nThe thing is – I don’t think of myself as retiring.\n\nI have led a constant, reliable life. I will read even the worst book to the last page. I have never voluntarily left a relationship, an obligation, or any employment.\n\n(I can barely stand to leave a room!)\n\nBut I’m leaving this seven-day-a-week commitment – because I want to, and because it’s time.\n\nMy intention is to move on and to do other meaningful work.\n\nWriting this column has given me a glimpse into thousands of lives.\n\nThe insight I have gained has inspired and empowered me to listen to my own counsel, to be authentic in my actions, and to – basically – be in charge of my own life, as much as possible.\n\nShowing myself the door at this moment reflects the privilege of good health, strong relationships, years of steady employment, and some prudent financial choices. I’m very aware of how lucky I am.\n\nMy favorite way to envision this work is to picture families reading these columns together at the breakfast table and weighing in with their own points of view before reading mine.\n\nAnd yes, there are still parents and grandparents out there who clip the newspaper and send pertinent columns to kids in college or summer camp, or tape it to refrigerators and bathroom mirrors.\n\nI’ve heard from health care workers, police officers, fire fighters and office workers who say they discuss the issues raised in the column in the break room.\n\nI love knowing that, and I’ll miss having coffee with you.\n\nThe questions raised in this space have been used as teaching tools in middle schools, memory care units, ESL classes and prisons. These are perfect venues to discuss ethical, human-sized dilemmas.\n\nOn my last day communicating with you in this way, I feel compelled to try to sum up my experience by offering some lasting wisdom, but I’ve got no fresh insight. Everything I know has been distilled from wisdom gathered elsewhere.\n\nBoxer Mike Tyson famously said, “Everybody has a plan, until they get punched ….” Punches are inevitable. But I do believe I’ve learned some universal truths that might soften the blows.\n\nThey are:\n\nShow up for people.\n\nBe gentle with yourself – and with others.\n\nLead with kindness, and recognize kindness when you receive it.\n\nReserve your harshest judgment. Sit on your worst thoughts about other people and consider the consequences before expressing them.\n\nBe of service by finding something, or someone, to take care of.\n\nFind creative ways to express your feelings.\n\nAdmit to your faults and failings, and resolve to do better.\n\nAsk for forgiveness.\n\nWork hard not to be defined by the worst things that have happened to you.\n\nRecognize even the smallest blessings and express gratitude.\n\nBe kind to receptionists, restaurant servers, dental hygienists, and anyone who needs to physically touch or serve you in order to do their job.\n\nUnderstand that there are times when it is necessary to give up.\n\nSpend time in nature.\n\nIdentify, develop, or explore your core ethical and/or spiritual beliefs.\n\nRecognize and detach from your own need to control someone else.\n\nRespect boundaries – yours and others’.\n\nSeek the counsel of people who are wiser than you are. Ask their advice, and listen.\n\nI sometimes supply “scripts” for people who have asked me for the right words to say, and so I thought I would boil these down to some of the most important statements I believe anyone can make.\n\nThey are:\n\nI need help.\n\nI’m sorry.\n\nI forgive you.\n\nI love you, just as you are.\n\nI’m on your side.\n\nYou’re safe.\n\nYou are not alone.\n\nNow that I’m near the end of my movie, I hope you’ll pay attention to the end credits.\n\nMany thanks to Chicago friends and colleagues, including Jim Warren, who found me, Ann Marie Lipinski, who hired me, Steve Mandell, who represented me, and editors Mary Elson, Bill O’Connell and Carrie Williams. Thank you to “Gentleman Jack” Barry, who softened my exit.\n\nAnd especially to Tracy Clark, a talented novelist who has helped to correct my faulty thinking and grammar for many years.\n\nFinally, much gratitude to faithful readers, who can find me on social media and through my regular newsletter.\n\nOnward!\n\nLove,\n\nAmy\n\nFINALLY …\n\nI don’t have to care about gender reveal parties.\n\n(The following column runs in newspapers across the country on May 24th, 2024)\n\nDear Readers: After 21 years writing the “Ask Amy” column, I’m announcing that I’m leaving this space. My final column will run at the end of June.\n\nI’m healthy, happy, and 64-years-old. This is a decision I’ve been wrestling with for over a year.\n\nWhen I was first hired by the Chicago Tribune to write an advice column after Ann Landers’ death, I was a middle-aged single mother. My daughter Emily and I moved from our long-time home in Washington DC and relocated to Chicago.\n\n[Emily and Amy, Freeville, NY. Photo by Chris Walker for the Chicago Tribune]\n\nMy welcome to Chicago was to deliver a solo performance of “Take Me Out to the Ball Game” in front of 35,000 baseball fans during the 7th inning stretch of a Cubs game at Wrigley Field.\n\nThis turned out to be a metaphor for my experience writing this column, which has been an exuberant and sometimes nerve-wracking effort of trying to hit the right notes before a huge audience.\n\nAfter several great years in Chicago, Emily left for college and I moved back to my tiny hometown of Freeville, NY (pop. 505), to spend time with my sisters, aunts and cousins, and to be with my mother at the end of her life.\n\nMy experiences have mirrored those of many of my readers. For me, these last two decades have been about the intensity and consequences of both love and loss.\n\nAfter returning home, I promptly tumbled into a Hallmark Channel plotline, when I fell in love with and quickly married a man I’ve known since childhood (we grew up on neighboring dairy farms). My husband Bruno and I then blundered into the oftentimes awkward blending of our family of five daughters.\n\n[2008, Freeville, NY]\n\nI became a stepmother, and then a grandmother, all before I believed I was ready.\n\nMy mother and her three wonderful sisters are gone, now. A niece and nephew died, tragically, while in their teens. Much of my recent life has been absorbed by caregiving, mourning, and recovery.\n\nDay in, day out – over the last two decades – readers have generously shared their own vulnerabilities about many of our common experiences. I’m grateful that we’ve been able to help each other.\n\nI’ve burned through eight laptops, opened bushels of postal mail, written columns in the car, on board planes, in hospital waiting rooms, on my honeymoon, and at my mother’s bedside. During this time, I’ve also written two books, a screenplay, and scores of essays.\n\nDoing this work has sent me into therapy. It has inspired me to explore the teachings of world religions, and to seek the insight of thinkers like Joseph Campbell and Carl Jung. I’ve quoted the wisdom of Maya Angelou, Joni Mitchell and Fred Rogers – as well as dozens of poets, social scientists and psychologists.\n\nI’ve made my share of mistakes, been well-pranked – at least twice (that I know of), and learned how to apologize, ask for forgiveness, and to forgive other people for their own mistakes. Inspired by readers’ dilemmas, I’ve also worked hard to mend fractured family relationships and to be a better friend.\n\nMy personal experiences are a reminder that we humans can’t really control what happened before or what happens next. Joy, like grief, comes at you in such unexpected ways. That’s why it is so important to pay attention. I’ve learned to do that.\n\nBeing an advice-giver has challenged me to be aware of cultural, social, and relationship trends – and to appreciate the quirks of human behavior.\n\nWhen readers get frustrated by my lengthy answers to sometimes petty problems, they will often suggest that I should just tell people to “get a life!,” but I think that wrestling with our questions – from the quotidian to the profound – is living.\n\nFor the next month, I’ll continue to publish fresh columns and rerun some favorites. After that, my fantasy is to drive an RV across the country, visiting people I’ve met through this work who have challenged me and tantalized readers with their anonymous requests for advice.\n\nIn my hometown, I’m opening a little lending library. You can find me on social media, through my Asking Amy newsletter, at amydickinson.com, or at the Freeville Literary Society on Main Street – talking books with kids and offering advice to anyone who asks.\n\nLove,\n\nAmy\n\nBe a literacy champion! – Put a Book on Every Bed\n\nAmy Dickinson\n\nDecember, 2021\n\nDear Readers: Every year at Christmastime, I ask readers to put “A Book on Every Bed.” I do so in memory of my mother, Jane, whose weekly trips to our town’s library always yielded armloads of books. In our household, we went without some things that other families had, but we always had books in abundance.\n\nThe idea to put books on beds at Christmastime originally came from historian David McCullough, who recounted the Christmas mornings of his youth, when the very first thing he woke up to was a wrapped book at the base of his bed, left there by Santa.\n\nThe most important part is what happens next: Family members reading together.\n\nWorking with my local literacy partner Children’s Reading Connection (childrensreadingconnection.org)[CQ], this campaign has grown to include schools, libraries and booksellers, who have donated scores of books to families that might not have access to them.\n\nThis year, I am thrilled that author Jacqueline Woodson (jacquelinewoodson.com) agreed to share a very personal literacy story. Ms. Woodson is the winner of, well – all of the awards for her genre-spanning work, including the prestigious Newbery and Caldecott, as well as a Macarthur “Genius” grant (2020). Her books, “Brown Girl Dreaming” and “The Day You Begin” are both very important to the children in my life.\n\nShe writes:\n\nA Pile of Books\n\n“The other night, a friend was describing her love for books. She said that love began when she was a child and her dad would bring a pile of books to read to her before she went to sleep.\n\nAs I listened, I imagined what would it have been like to have ‘a pile of books’ and someone who had the time at the end of the day to read them to me. Or better, to be able to read them to myself.\n\nThe books I had as a child were borrowed from the library or the worn books that had moved through many hands before landing, often in states of disrepair, in my own hands.\n\nBooks were both a necessity and a luxury in my childhood.\n\nMy mother wanted us to read constantly but didn’t have the money to buy us 'piles of books’.\n\nTo have a brand-new book to open at night - it’s crisp unbroken binding, the scent of its pages, the soft rush of air and excitement that comes with turning them - this is my dream for every child.\n\nA pile of books begins with one. And like a child, it grows.”\n\nJacqueline Woodson\n\nTo support independent bookstores, which have had to pivot during the pandemic (like all of us), I’m presenting some recently published books in various categories, selected by some of my favorite booksellers.\n\nFrom Jill Yoemans, owner of White Whale Bookstore in Pittsburgh, PA – three recommendations for Early Readers:\n\n“Mia Mayhem is a Superhero!,” by Kara West and Leeza Hernandez.\n\n“I’m On It! (Elephant and Piggie Like Reading!),” by Andrea Tsurumi and Mo Willems.\n\n“Narwhal: Unicorn of the Sea” (a Narwhal and Jelly Book), by Ben Clanton.\n\nFrom Lisa Swayze, General Manager of Buffalo Street Books in Ithaca, NY (Buffalostreetbooks.com):\n\n“The Young Adult category has some of the most diverse, exciting, and revolutionary writing happening today. Buffalo Street Books’ #1 pick this year is ‘This Poison Heart,’ by Kalynn Bayron. Once you’re entangled in this heart-stopping story, you won’t be able to put the book down.\n\n“We also recommend: ‘The Firekeeper’s Daughter,’ by Angeline Boulley, ‘We Are Not Broken,’ by George M. Johnson, and ‘We Are Inevitable,’ by Gayle Forman.”\n\nFrom the bookselling staff of Politics and Prose Bookstore in Washington DC, Adult non-fiction (politics-prose.com):[CQ]\n\n“Empire of Pain,” by Patrick Radden Keefe: A riveting account of the Sackler pharmaceutical dynasty. Over decades they engaged in aggressive marketing of drugs, culminating in the promotion of oxycontin, which fostered the opioid crisis.\n\n“Crying in H Mart,” by Michelle Zauner: In moving prose, the singer paints a vivid picture of the pain she endured growing up as the biracial daughter of a Korean mother and an American father.\n\n“All That She Carried: The Journey of Ashley’s Sack, a Black Family Keepsake”\n\nby Tiya Miles: Winner of the National Book Award, this historian pieces together the lost lives of a Black American family – through the contents of a flour sack from the 1840s. The story of the sack carries “all the drama and pathos of ancient tapestries depicting the deeds of queens.”\n\n[You can share your own literacy stories on my Facebook page @AdickinsonDaily, or through Instagram: @booksonbeds.]\n\nVietnam Veterans respond to: “Thank you for your service…”\n\n(photo credit: Benjamin Lehman)\n\nDear Readers: I recently ran a letter from “Old Veteran,” who noted that, as a Vietnam vet, he feels quite uncomfortable when people say “Thank you for your service.”\n\nOld Veteran noted that “There are many wounds that have never healed” because of the way service members were treated when they returned home from Vietnam.\n\nI later ran a response from “Upset,” who claimed that this mistreatment was an “urban myth.”\n\nThese letters have prompted hundreds of responses from other veterans – and those who love them.\n\nSome of these responses are below.\n\nOn this Veterans Day, I’d like to say to all service members: Thank you.\n\nVeterans who have been mistreated when they returned stateside after serving in unpopular wars report that they have yearned to hear these two words:\n\nWelcome home.\n\nDear Amy: The letter from “Old Veteran” made me cry.\n\nI too was subjected to a lot of nastiness coming home after my service was completed. The day I got home and changed my clothes was the last day I ever talked about being in the service. I moved away from my neighborhood and never told a soul that I had been in the military.\n\nSo, please tell ‘Upset’ that this is not an urban myth. I would tell that person to reach out and speak to some Vietnam vets, if they have the guts to hear the truth about how this country handled itself during this time.\n\n– Detroit Mike\n\nDear Amy: I’m an Army brat. People told me my dad was a baby killer when he was serving in Vietnam.\n\nAnd in 1977, I was spit on when I was wearing my ROTC uniform on campus. I understand people want to believe that those things never happened, but they did.\n\nLet’s never let that happen again.\n\n– Proud to Serve\n\nDear Amy: It’s been 52 years since I came home from Vietnam. For the first 30 years or so after I came home, I didn’t tell anyone I was a Vietnam veteran because I didn’t want to be harassed or ridiculed, but not anymore.\n\nNo matter how unpopular the war was, I am proud of my time in the U.S Army Infantry, and I don’t care who knows it.\n\n– Proud\n\nDear Amy: My mom was a nurse in Vietnam and always had mixed feelings about serving in the Army.\n\nShe was in the hospital seeking treatment near the end of her life, and the nurses and doctors found out that she was a veteran.\n\nThey started asking questions, and also thanking her.\n\nIn the week before her passing, she said it took her 40 years, but she was never so proud to have served.\n\nShe knew her kids were proud, but strangers saying, “thank you” and showing respect for her service boosted her.\n\nShe finally felt like she fully came home.\n\nTo all of the vets out there: Thank you and welcome home.\n\n– Daughter of a Proud Veteran\n\nDear Amy: My husband spent 18 months in Vietnam.\n\nWhen many soldiers came home, the minute they hit the States, they would change out of uniform because of comments that were being made.\n\nYes, there were those that were spit upon.\n\nIt was years before he would tell anyone that he served in Vietnam. Now when he is out and wearing his Army/Vietnam cap, more Vietnam veterans will come and talk to him.\n\n– Loving Wife\n\nDear Amy: I am the wife of a Vietnam vet.\n\nMy husband was drafted, so he went. There wasn’t 24-hour news coverage; mail to and from Vietnam was spotty and the internet didn’t exist.\n\nThe poor treatment of returning vets isn’t a myth!\n\nI will always remember waiting at Travis AFB for his returning plane with protesters shouting curses. And yes, spitting. It was awful.\n\nNeither my husband or I thought the war made sense, but what protesters didn’t seem to understand is that the members of the armed services didn’t start the war, and few were volunteers.\n\nThey were just American “kids” answering the call of duty.\n\n– Mickie\n\nDear Amy: For four generations, my family has served as pilots in WWII, Korea, Vietnam and Afghanistan. There are two words most appreciated by vets and rarely heard, “Welcome Home.”\n\nI’ve had vets respond with heartfelt gratitude and pride, often telling me it’s the first time anyone has welcomed them home.\n\n– An Air Force Brat\n\nDear Amy: I am an older vet. When people say thank you for your service, I reply: “I was drafted. But I would do it again for you.” – Anonymous\n\nCancer surgeon scares patient by wearing loose mask\n\nAmy Dickinson\n\n25 February, 2021\n\nDear Amy: I’m in my 60’s and undergoing cancer treatment, therefore immunocompromised.\n\nAt both of my appointments with my surgeon, she has worn a loose fitting, thin, cloth mask. She has to get very close to me – face to face – to examine me. This has made me extremely uncomfortable, and frankly angry. She has unnecessarily caused me additional stress during the most stressful period of my life. I didn’t say anything to her either time, because it felt too awkward.\n\nIn about a month she will have my life in her hands, and I don’t want her having any potential negative feelings toward me when I go under the knife. I’ve written an anonymous letter about this, which I haven’t sent. I want to report her primarily so she will use adequate PPE, but I don’t want repercussions. How should I handle this?\n\nCautious in Colorado\n\nDear Cautious: Dear Cautious: Your question reveals that the trust you should have may be missing with this surgeon.\n\nI shared your question with a friend who is a cancer surgeon with 30 years of experience at a major cancer center. He and I share concern about you, and his response follows:\n\n“Patient safety is paramount, not just during surgery, but also before and after. Almost everyone is nervous before surgery, but you should not also carry the anxiety of mistrust with you into the operating room. You should be cautious, because no matter how many operations your surgeon has done, this is your one.\n\n“Since COVID, I always wear a surgical mask and will frequently add a face shield when seeing patients.\n\n“Your surgeon should create an environment where you are able to express your concerns and ask questions. Ideally, you should raise your concern directly to her. How she responds will be very revealing. If she apologizes and thanks you for bringing this to her attention; that’s a good sign. If she is defensive, you should seek another surgeon.”\n\n“You and your loved ones are your best advocates, but if your hospital has a patients’ advocate’s office, report your concern to them. They may not be surprised by your report, and if needed, can help you to change surgeons. They may help with either having a family member join for a critical in-person conversation with your surgeon, or if that’s not possible, listen to the consultation over the phone. Many patients are stressed and will not remember what their doctor says, so that extra pair of ears helps.\n\n“There are many fine cancer surgeons out there. For critical and important insights, read reviews of them. The Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS.gov) is working to make this information more transparent with ‘star ratings’ – and many hospitals advertise these scores.\n\n“Surgeons are professionals with extensive training and a team to help them give you the best possible care. At the end of the day the surgeon should be there for YOU, not the other way around.”\n\nNever forget that!\n\nThis year – put a Book on EVERY Bed\n\nThis year: put a Book on EVERY Bed\n\nBy “Ask Amy” advice columnist Amy Dickinson\n\n10 December, 2020\n\nDear Readers: Every year at Christmastime, I delight in promoting a Book on Every Bed. I do so in memory of my mother, Jane, who raised her children to understand that if you have a book, you are never alone.\n\nThe idea originally came from historian David McCollough, who recounted the Christmas mornings of his youth, when the very first thing he woke up to was a wrapped book at the base of his bed, left there by Santa.\n\nThe most important part is what happens next: Family members reading together.\n\nThat’s it! That’s the whole idea!\n\nOver the last ten years, working with my local literacy partner Children’s Reading Connection (childrensreadingconnection.org), this campaign has grown to include schools, libraries and bookstores, who have donated scores of books to families that might not have access to them. The goal – and our dream – is that families will experience the intimate and personal connection of diving into and sharing stories, the way my mother and I did throughout her life.\n\nOver the years, important literacy advocates, such as the Librarian of Congress Carla Hayden and LeVar Burton, and bestselling children’s authors Brad Meltzer and Peter Reynolds, have endorsed and helped to spread the good word.\n\nThis year is different. So many of us are alone, hurting, and separated from family and familiar holiday routines.\n\nAll of us – not just children – need a good book on our beds.\n\nI have broadened the scope to include specific recommendations for books spanning all ages. I’ve reached out to some of my favorite writers, literacy advocates, and independent booksellers across the country for their special picks.\n\nWhether you purchase a book or share an old favorite, I hope you will be inspired to put A Book on Every Bed this year. It is not necessary to make a Christmas deadline – this idea is one to sustain people throughout what might shape up to be a very long winter.\n\nFollowing are recommendations for all age groups.\n\nBaby and Toddlers: From Brigid Hubberman, Children’s Reading Connection, Ithaca, NY (childrensreadingconnection.org):\n\n“Words are the language of love for babies. The best books for infants should be about the world they know. Parents should choose books to surround babies with an abundance of loving and delightful words.”\n\nBaby Cakes, by Karma Wilson and Sam Williams\n\nHaiku Baby, by Betsy E. Snyder\n\nShine Baby Shine, by Leslie Staub and Lori Nichols\n\nAges 3-5: From Lisa Swaze, Buffalo Street Books, Ithaca, NY (Buffalostreetbooks.com)\n\n“If You Come to Earth,” by Sophie Blackall is one of my favorite picture books of 2020. This book is beautiful both visually and lyrically, and it will feel like a warm hug to any child or family who receives it.\n\n“You Matter,” by Christian Robinson is a bright and elegant book that takes children on a journey around the world to make it clear that everyone matters, and perhaps more importantly, reassure them that they matter, no matter what they look like or where they are from.\n\nEarly Readers: From Sandra Dear, owner of The Little Boho Bookshop, in Bayonne, NJ (thelittlebohobookshop.com)\n\n“The Suitcase,” by Chris Naylor-Ballesteros: This beautiful story about immigration, is full of heart and humanity as it teaches our littlest ones about hope, tolerance and kindness.\n\n“Home in the Woods,” by Eliza Wheeler: This stunningly beautiful picture book has fast become a customer favorite. A story about starting over, of overcoming! A story of family, love and joy of being and growing together.\n\nMiddle Grade Readers: From Becky Anderson, co-owner of Anderson’s Bookshop, in Naperville, Illinois (andersonsbookshops.com):\n\n“Ways to Make Sunshine,” by Renee Watson: Watson writes her own version of Ramona Quimby, one starring a Black girl and her family, in this start to a charming new middle grade series about spirit, kindness, and sunshine. Ryan, a fourth grader, finds the positive in difficult situations and when trouble strikes. She is that character to love and bring in the sunshine! Grades 3-6\n\nSkunk and Badger by Amy Timberlake, illustrated by Jon Klassen: Winnie-the-Pooh and Frog and Toad meet in a fresh take on a classic odd-couple friendship. Klassen’s illustrations add much to a story of an unlikely friendship that proves that opposites can see the good in one another. The first in a series. Grades 3-7\n\n“The Silver Arrow,” by Lev Grossman: Kate’s humdrum life is transformed when her eccentric Uncle Herbert brings her a colossal locomotive train, the Silver Arrow, as her eleventh birthday gift, leading her and her younger brother on a mysterious journey. The train will remind readers of the Hogwart’s Express. A story that is environmentally aware and calls readers to action. Perfect for fans of Roald Dahl and The Chronicles of Narnia. Grades 3-7\n\nYA Readers: Danielle Kreger, Blue Bunny Books, Dedham, MA (bluebunnybooks.com): \"One of Us is Lying\" by Karen M McManus: An edge of your seat mystery that takes place in Bayview High school during detention. Simon, a so-called “outcast,” never makes it out of detention alive. What follows is a tale of twists and turns that has the reader questioning the reliability of the characters, and the secrets they keep.\n\n“Burn” by Patrick Ness: A fast-paced young adult fantasy that begins with fifteen-year-old Sarah, who meets Kazimir – a dragon who has been hired to help on her family’s farm. Still reeling from the death of her mother, Sarah finds herself feeling an intense and unusual connection with Kazimir. As the story unfolds secrets, dangers and Kazimir’s true purpose are revealed.\n\n“The New Kid” by Jerry Craft: A spot-on graphic novel about navigating a new school, new friends and identity. Jordan Banks is in seventh grade when he is sent to a rigorous private school and grapples with staying true to himself- his love for creating cartoons, how to maintain his old friends and how he fits in in a less than diverse new school. A totally lovable and relatable character!\n\nAdult Non-fiction: From Alex George, the author, most recently, of The Paris Hours, founder and director of the Unbound Book Festival, and the owner of Skylark Bookshop, in Columbia, MO (skylarkbookshop.com)\n\n“Wintering,” by Katherine May: This is a deeply personal, quietly beautiful book, written with grace and immense thoughtfulness. We all go through difficult times; by mulling over her responses to her own misfortunes, the author offers insight as to how we might think differently about low points in our lives. Instructive, inspiring, and ultimately profoundly hopeful.\n\n“The Book of Delights,” by Ross Gay: This utterly charming book of micro-essays by Ross Gay, a beloved and renowned poet, is a perfect gift for – well, just about anyone. Gay set himself the challenge of finding one thing that delighted him each day for a year, and then writing about it. The result is a quirky, brilliant book that you can dip in and out of, always finding something to make you smile, and think. A guaranteed lifter of spirits.\n\n“Intimations: Six Essays,” by Zadie Smith: I’ve always loved Zadie Smith’s nonfiction work, and this small but powerful book shows her talents at their finest. Written during the pandemic, these six pieces are sharp, and funny, and thought-provoking. Smith’s deeply personal reflections on this strangest of years is essential reading. If ever there was a book for these strange times, it’s this one.\n\nAdult Fiction: Mark LaFramboise, Senior Book Buyer at Politics and Prose in Washington, DC (politics-prose.com)\n\n“The Butterfly Lampshade,” by Aimee Bender: This is a beautiful story of mental illness, the bonds of sisterhood, and the liveliness of a child’s imagination. Francie is 8 years old when the book begins, the daughter of a single mom. This is the story of her odyssey after her mother is committed to a mental hospital, and she is sent to be raised by an aunt and uncle.\n\n“Luster,” by Raven Leilani: Edie, the young protagonist in Luster, Raven Leilani’s debut novel, is daring, sexy, hilarious, super smart, and drop dead beautiful. Her affair with a married man takes a turn for the strange when she meets and befriends the man’s wife and daughter. Edie is whip smart because Raven Leilani is whip smart and her voice propels this beguiling novel.\n\n“What Are You Going Through,” by Sigrid Nunez: Sigrid Nunez writes so beautifully that plot feels irrelevant. The writer’s confidence and authority are apparent from the first page. Ultimately, it’s the story of a woman who is asked by an old college acquaintance to be with her when she takes her life, after a cancer diagnosis. But, like her previous book The Friend (about a woman who inherits a large Great Dane), it doesn’t matter what story she tells because her words bristle with life.\n\nElders: Gayle Shanks, Changing Hands Bookstore, in Tempe and Phoenix, AZ\n\n(changinghands.com)\n\n“Apeirogon,” by Colum McCann: Two fathers, one Palestinian and one Israeli have both lost their young daughters to violence but have decided that reconciliation, not revenge, is what they needed to seek. In the process, they became best friends. McCann describes the insanity and senseless violence bred in the Middle East, the Occupation under which the Palestinians are forced to live, but also the beauty of the country, the migration of birds, the many ways humans overcome adversity and find solace in the natural world and each other. In a series of 1001 fragments, McCann walks us through his imaginary polygon, the Apeirogon of the title, containing an infinite number of sides, an infinite number of gorgeous sentences, and ultimately an infinite number of ways to view the human condition.\n\n“All the Way to the Tigers,” by Mary Morris: Travel writer Mary Morris’ book, written in small chapters, was in some ways similar to reading Colum McCann’s, Aperagon, also written in small bits (in his case 1001, in Mary’s – 112 chapters). Morris travels to India in search of the elusive Bengal tiger, but in so many ways she is searching for herself and her place in the world as she recovers from a serious ankle injury that leaves her debilitated but determined.\n\nIn her short vignettes, she quotes Rilke, Wendell Berry, other writers she admires and reminds us how important it is to listen intently to others as in active listening we are rewarded with deeper understanding.\n\n“The Chair Rocks,” by Ashton Applewhite: From childhood on, we’re barraged by messages that it’s sad to be old. That wrinkles are embarrassing, and old people useless. Author and activist Ashton Applewhite believed them too—until she realized where this prejudice comes from and the damage it does. Lively, funny, and deeply researched, This Chair Rocks traces Applewhite’s journey from apprehensive boomer to pro-aging radical, and in the process debunks myth after myth about late life. The book explains the roots of ageism—in history and in our own age denial. Whether you’re older or hoping to get there, this book will shake you by the shoulders, cheer you up, make you mad, and change the way you see the rest of your life. Age pride!\n\nResponding to a racial slur by – letting it all out\n\nAmy Dickinson\n\n3 December, 2020\n\nDear Amy: I am a Black man who works in a warehouse setting.\n\nIn the last three jobs I’ve had, a White co-worker has used the “N” word to me, while not specifically calling me the name.\n\nI find even the mention of the word hurtful and I do not use it myself, even in description or when greeting a fellow Black person.\n\nAt my previous job, a co-worker used the word three times, and when I complained to HR, they really didn’t do anything, so I found another job.\n\nAt my current job, two co-workers have used the word, one to describe a movie he loves from the ’70s. The other guy just thought it was OK to say it casually about nobody in particular.\n\nThis made me feel hurt and angry inside, but I didn’t say anything because honestly, I felt (and feel) powerless.\n\nI’ve dealt with this kind of behavior since elementary school.\n\nI realize I can’t control others’ thoughts or actions. I also believe that going to HR is useless; that office being in another part of the country, and they will do nothing.\n\nI can’t believe how painful this is, and for how long in my life I have had to deal with it.\n\nWhat can I do?\n\n— Disgusted\n\nDear Disgusted: I shared your question with Maurice Ruffin, a New Orleans attorney, professor of writing, and author of one of my favorite novels, the powerful “We Cast a Shadow” (2020, One World).\n\nHere is his response: “I’m sorry for your pain. I know how it feels to have random acquaintances use the ‘N’ word. I’ve been called the ‘N’ word myself; most recently by a white woman who thought I was out of earshot. I let her know what I thought of that. She was ashamed to have been caught and called out.\n\n“Toni Morrison said that racism is designed to distract you. And I believe it. I also think the work of racism is to silence you. I’m sure all the people you mentioned are aware that the word is a slur. No doubt, that’s why they used it in the first place. Maybe they think it’s cool or dangerous to use it. That’s not your problem.\n\n“If you feel offended, you should speak up for yourself because if you hold it inside, you’ll feel even worse. You should tell your co-workers you don’t appreciate their comments. If you don’t feel safe telling them, go to your supervisor, because that’s the job of management: to resolve issues that affect your ability to do your job well. And if your supervisor is not helpful, report the issue to their superior, and so on up the chain.\n\n“The work of racism is to distract and silence you. Don’t let these co-workers distract or silence you. My mama said, ‘Don’t ever let them run you off, because you’ll never stop running.’”\n\n“YOU know who you are, but, clearly, they don’t.”\n\nShow them."
