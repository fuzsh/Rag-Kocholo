        "text": "One of the most famous and dynamic modern dance ensembles of our time, the Paul Taylor Dance Company has been innovating and transforming the art form of modern dance since 1954. With a history of multidisciplinary collaborations, passionate expression, and thrilling athleticism, the Company continues boldly into the future under the leadership of Artistic Director Michael Novak.\n\nPaul Taylor Dance Foundation, Inc. is a 501(c)3 tax-exempt organization. Donations in support of the Foundation are tax-deductible within the guidelines of the U.S. law.\n\nThe Paul Taylor Dance Foundation strives to achieve and maintain the highest levels of artistic excellence while celebrating the modern dance idiom. Through our artistic and educational programming, the Foundation works to celebrate the rich history of the modern dance field, while nurturing and elevating a diverse and inclusive community of dancers, choreographers, collaborators, educators, and audience members.\n\nThe success of our mission is inseparable from our individual and institutional commitments to develop and sustain a culture of equity, fairness, and belonging across all facets of our work and our organization. We acknowledge that our Foundation grew from and exists within a world with a strong current of discrimination and exclusionism, and while we cannot erase past ills or injustices, we can work to ensure that our practices embrace differences as assets in a society that more fully amplifies all voices and includes all individuals."
