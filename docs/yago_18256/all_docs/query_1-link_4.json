        "text": "Dr. Amy Farrah Fowler, Ph.D., is a main character in The Big Bang Theory.\n\nA neuroscientist, Amy is from Glendale, California. She also has a doctorate degree in neurobiology from Harvard University, inspired by actress Mayim Bialik's own doctorate.\n\nShe initially was discovered by Raj and Howard as a possible match for Sheldon through an online dating service. By Sheldon's own admission, she is most like him by any standard. Like him, she has previously avoided relationships (whether romantic or otherwise is entirely unclear). She has her own apartment. She also has a five-year plan to become Mrs. Cooper. By the ninth season, Amy wants to take a breather from their relationship and a naïve Sheldon pushes her so she breaks-up with him. Later, the two reconcile and resume their relationship eventually moving in together. In the Season 10 finale, Sheldon asks her to marry him, resulting in them getting engaged in \"The Proposal Proposal\". The wedding was on May 12, 2018.\n\nBiography[]\n\nHistory/Early life[]\n\nAmy was born to Larry and Mrs. Fowler on December 17 (as proven by Sheldon having a ticket to the premiere on THURSDAY, that being the 17th), in 1979 from Glendale, California. (\"The Weekend Vortex\") Her father is very quiet and in an unhappy marriage with her mother. Amy is an only child. She has a strained relationship with her mother. She was very lonely and had no friends from nursery school through to graduate school. The closest thing she had to a friend in high school was the janitor whom she regularly had lunch with until his wife found out, called Amy a \"puta\" (Spanish for \"whore\") and made her stop. Only her mother signed her high school yearbook. Mrs. Fowler also paid Amy's cousin to take her to the prom, but he used the money to buy drugs. She did attend the prom, but was only on the clean-up crew and danced with her mop. She also dressed up as Amelia Earhart in middle school.\n\nAfter high school, Amy went to Harvard, then to graduate school, and later received a Ph.D. in neurobiology.\n\nSeasons 1 and 2[]\n\nAmy has no appearances in any episodes of Season 1 or Season 2; however, in \"The Bat Jar Conjecture\" (S01E13), \"that girl who played TV's Blossom\" is mentioned by Rajesh Koothrappali as her possibly being the fourth member of their The Physics Bowl Quiz team.\n\nSeason 3[]\n\nAmy makes her first appearance in the Season 3 finale where she meets Sheldon after she was matched to him on a dating site by Howard and Raj.\n\nSeason 4[]\n\nPenny hears that Sheldon has a female friend and encourages him to hang out with her, especially post Sheldon shocking his friends with news that he and Amy plan to be parents. Amy and Sheldon have their first date in the premiere episode at a dinner arranged by Penny. Sheldon tells everyone prior to the date \"Yes, she's a girl and yes, she's my friend, but no, she is not my girlfriend.\" Penny threatens Sheldon into not having kids with Amy.\n\nLater, in \"The 21-Second Excitation\", Amy invites herself to Penny and Bernadette's girls' night. There, she begins her friendship with them and they start hanging out, beginning the story of Penny's Posse. She ends the episode by terrifying Penny via stripping in front of her.\n\nIn The Love Car Displacement, she goes to a science conference in San Francisco and sits with Penny in the back seat of the lead car. Sheldon kicks Penny out for her rebellious nature and Amy and a stressed Penny from the time she spent with Howard and Bernadette singing tell each other they missed each other once they reunite in the hotel. However Glenn, Bernadette's ex-boyfriend and former professor meets Howard, leading to a chaotic night, starting with Howard acting up over feeling he's nothing compared to Glenn. Amy's too hard for Penny to sleep with and Penny goes to sleep with Leonard. The next morning, the science conference is filled with arguments and Penny goes home with Glenn, who Amy's impressed with. Amy sees Leonard speeding and Sheldon mentions the cops are behind them for that very reason.\n\nSeason 5[]\n\nAmy goes on a date with Stuart which makes Sheldon jealous. He ends up interrupting their date, asking Amy to be his girlfriend making them officially a couple. Sheldon proceeds to make rules regarding their relationship. (\"The Flaming Spittoon Acquisition\")\n\nIn the season 5 finale, while Howard's heading to space, Sheldon intrigues Amy with his knowledge of the ingredients in the Pringles can. She reflects on her displeasure that she won't be able to be the maid of honour she wants to be at a conventional wedding reception. In City Hall, she learns Leonard proposed to Penny and post some struggles, the group decides to hold Howard and Bernadette's wedding on the roof of Sheldon and Leonard's apartment. While the 5 reverends speak, Amy says she'll happily be Bernadette's maid of honour in the future if Howard and Bernadette get divorced, to which everyone looks at Amy for her inappropriate comment. Sheldon Speaks Klingon during the wedding and Bernadette tells him he was forbidden and he reluctantly complies at a cost. The episode ends with Amy's hand held by Sheldon as they watch Howard go to space, to her delighted surprise.\n\nSeason 6[]\n\nAmy had appeared in 22 episodes in Season 6 and had been absent from 2 episodes in Season 6 (1: S6E8 and 2: S6E22).\n\nSeason 7[]\n\nAmy's leading in a game with Penny as the two are skiing in a video game. Sheldon denies the chance to play cause he has to go see his sister give birth. As Sheldon's away, everyone in Leonard and Sheldon's apartment imagines their life without Sheldon. Amy imagines herself singing happy birthday sadly while holding a cupcake and Stuart puts himself in her imagination, to her displeasure. The episode ends with Stuart solo in The Cheesecake Factory. (The Cooper Extraction)\n\nAmy is happy about Leonard and Penny's engagement and she is the only one seen hugging them both and gets upset when Sheldon leaves town in (\"The Status Quo Combustion\").\n\nSeason 8[]\n\nAmy is happy when Sheldon tells her he loves her (\"The Prom Equivalency\").\n\nIn \"The Commitment Determination\", Amy asks for a break from her relationship with Sheldon.\n\nSeason 9[]\n\nIn \"The Matrimonial Momentum\", Amy goes to Howard and Bernadette's to watch Lenny's wedding, but Sheldon keeps pushing her to make up her mind about their relationship, but when he insults her, she angrily breaks up with him.\n\nIn \"The Earworm Reverberation\", she gets back together with Sheldon and they engage in a very passionate kiss as they embrace.\n\nIn \"The Opening Night Excitation\", Sheldon's birthday present to Amy is to finally have sex with her.\n\nFrom \"The Sales Call Sublimation\" until \"The Meemaw Materialization\", Amy is away in Detroit at a neuroscience convention. During that time, Sheldon has an asteroid named after her and she teaches him the true meaning of empathy. Upon her return, Amy meets Sheldon's Meemaw, who is furious at her for hurting Sheldon. She also unintentionally reveals the secret engagement ring Sheldon was going to give to Amy.\n\nIn \"The Celebration Experimentation\", Amy decides to throw Sheldon a birthday party as a token of appreciation for what he did for her birthday and to help him make up for all of the terrible birthdays he had as a child. Penny's Posse Asks Sheldon what he wants for his birthday while the guys go to get him a present. Sheldon says he wants a three layered chocolate cake with strawberry frosting and 0 messages with capital letters cause he doesn't want his cake yelling at him and he tells them what kind of music and balloons he'll want too. During Sheldon's party, he feels overwhelmed by the number of people there and goes to the bathroom. The episode ends with everyone singing happy birthday to Sheldon and Adam West wondering who'll take him home.\n\nSheldon's going to a movie screening and hires Stuart to do things with Amy while he's busy. Amy rejects Stuart in everything and Sheldon has to do things personally. Meanwhile, Penny's Posse watches Penny and Beverly make a connection. (The Line Substitution Solution)\n\nAmy discusses plans for Leonard and Penny's 2nd wedding ceremony as to the maid of honour. Penny says Bernadette will officiate the wedding and Amy complains she's now just a maid of honour. When Beverly and Mary are together, Amy and Penny start feeling uncomfortable. When the room's silent, Sheldon does what he can to break the tension. She drives Sheldon, Mary and Leonard's father Alfred to dinner and Penny, Leonard and Beverly join them at the restaurant. While Penny makes a call, she learns Howard, Bernadette and Raj had an incident and Howard was pulled over, to Bernadette's frustration. During the dinner, Amy points out to Sheldon his mother and Leonard's father are bonding. The season ends with Leonard and Sheldon's parents not responding to their phones, causing Penny to burst out laughing while Leonard and Sheldon are unhappy.\n\nSeason 10[]\n\nIn \"The Conjugal Conjecture\", Amy plays the harp for Leonard and Penny's second wedding. Sheldon stands up to say something to the bride and groom and mistakenly thinks that she is getting a proposal. Additionally she gets sympathy from both Alfred Hofstadter and Mary Cooper. She tries to get Sheldon to apologize for his obnoxious comment like how Mary does it. It may not work, but Mary tells her to put more zing in it.\n\nLater they move in together in \"The Cohabitation Experimentation\". It occurs thanks to a flood in Amy's apartment. After the damage is fixed, she decides to hide this fact from Sheldon. But he finally finds out feeling she is hiding something from him. This becomes officially permanent in \"The Veracity Elasticity\" and in \"The Birthday Synchronicity\", Amy shares a birthday with Halley Wolowitz.\n\nIn \"The Allowance Evaporation\", Amy learns that Sheldon told people around Caltech about their \"annual coitus\", making her mad at him.\n\nIn \"The Gyroscopic Collapse\", Amy gets offered a summer program at Princeton University which Sheldon encourages her to take and they seal the deal with a nonscheduled coital episode.\n\nIn \"The Long Distance Dissonance\", Sheldon flies to New Jersey to propose to her, Amy is clearly surprised.\n\nSeason 11[]\n\nIn “The Proposal Proposal”, Amy is being proposed to by Sheldon. After hearing about Dr. Ramona Nowitzki kissing Sheldon, she is excited when she learns that that caused Sheldon to realized that Amy was the only woman he wanted to kiss for the rest of his life.\n\nIn \"The Relaxation Integration\", after having a hard time picking out a wedding date, Sheldon tells Amy to make all the wedding arrangements.\n\nIn \"The Confidence Erosion\", they start out enthusiastically planning their wedding together. After fighting about the arrangements, Amy suggests that maybe they should just elope. When it is their turn at city hall Sheldon decides that he wants a first dance so they leave to plan a real wedding.\n\nIn “The Celebration Reverberation”, Sheldon plans a ”Little House on the Prairie” dinner to honor Amy's birthday which results in food poisoning. Not interested the next day in coitus, they attend Halley Wolowitz's birthday party together. Feeling better they adjourn to one of their bedrooms to have their annual celebration.\n\nIn \"The Matrimonial Metric\", Sheldon and Amy test their friends to determine the best wedding party which makes them mad. Finally Sheldon picks Leonard as best man and Leonard figures Amy will pick Penny since she is her best friend. Penny denies it until she realizes that Amy IS her best friend. She goes to see Amy demanding that she makes her the maid of honor since she is her best friend making Amy very excited.\n\nIn \"The Athenaeum Allocation\", Sheldon and Amy began searching for their wedding venue and want it at the Caltech Athenaeum Club. They want the venue, but Kripke has selected the date they wanted.\n\nIn \"The Reclusive Potential\", Amy has her bachelorette party with Penny and Bernadette. She originally doesn't like their idea of their party - tea and making quilts so they then decide to go to a bar and get drunk. Sheldon goes off to meet a scientist, Robert Wolcott, in a cabin in the middle of nowhere, and he says that this was not his bachelor party. He enjoys spending time in the cabin at first, but then realizes that he misses Amy...and his phone.\n\nIn \"The Monetary Insufficiency\", Amy and the girls go shopping for wedding dresses. Amy picks one that doesn't look too appealing, but Sheldon says she looks beautiful and she decides to keep the dress.\n\nIn \"The Bow Tie Asymmetry\", Sheldon is excited about marrying Amy, but worried about how perfect his bow tie will look. Amy says that there is beauty in asymmetry. While getting ready for the ceremony, his mother says that even imperfections can make something perfect. These comments make Sheldon rethink his string theory calculations delaying the wedding while Sheldon and Amy work on inventing super asymmetry. Leonard joins them causing Penny to go ballistic and get them moving. Howard had gotten Star Wars actor Mark Hamill to replace Star Trek actor Wil Wheaton to perform the ceremony, to Sheldon's pleasure. Both sets of vows bring Mark Hamill to tears and as Sheldon leads Amy down the aisle, they are somewhat embarrassed to be serenaded by Barry Kripke.\n\nSeason 12[]\n\nAmy And Sheldon go on vacation in New York to celebrate their wedding and Sheldon causes Amy to laugh via offering her a lego breakfast. Upon a hotel staff member escorting them to their hotel room, Amy's happy to have coitus with Sheldon once more til she sees he has coitus on his schedule. Eventually, Sheldon's inappropriate and quirky behaviour gets on Amy's nerves and Sheldon comes to her with two hot dogs. They talk and head back to the hotel where Sheldon tells her to repeat what she said to him while naked. (The Conjugal Configuration)\n\nSheldon And Amy go on a scavenger hunt and the clues are in symbolic places such as the coffee shop they first met. Leonard enjoys the struggles Sheldon goes through during the scavenger hunt til Sheldon and Amy lock him and Penny out of their wi-fi and give them Sanskrit to figure out and they can't cheat. Their last scene in the episode is Raj mentioning to the couples he's met his new partner Anu and Sheldon knows the perfect gift for them. (The Wedding Gift Wormhole)\n\nSheldon And Amy are on Wil Wheaton's Professor Proton show during his last episode on the show and Wil reveals himself inviting a special guest for Sheldon. Sheldon's extremely excited, though he ends up puking on Shatner and his friends tease him. The guys find Stuart's in Wil's Dungeons and Dragons game rather than them and the girls know better than them that the guys are just using Wil to get close to his famous friends. Leonard temporarily gets a spot in Wil's game til Penny reveals he told her of his friends there. The guys want a spot in Wil's game and upset him over how they're using him. The girls get into Wil's game and send a photo with him and his famous friends to the guys to taunt them, which Leonard says they were deserving for their treatment of Wil.\n\nLeonard's Mother Beverly's having her last episode on the show and Amy doesn't wanna not go to the airport and have people discuss her. Beverly pays more attention to Leonard than Sheldon, causing her husband concern. When Leonard comes in upset about how his mother's just using him for her new book, Sheldon doesn't help Amy comfort him. Leonard and his mother proceed to make peace once Leonard sees she won't change.\n\nSheldon And Amy win the Nobel prize and Sheldon gets many congrats texts on his phone. Amy gets a few herself and Sheldon mentions how happy he is that their names will be forever linked together in a medal. Once they're outside the apartment, there's many reporters wanting to interview them and Sheldon's uncomfortable, causing him to leave and forcing Amy to respond to questions on her own. Sheldon's nervous behaviour continues in the cafeteria, to which Raj, Leonard and Howard call Sheldon quirky, while led by President Siebert on his last scene on the show. Amy starts having an emotional episode in the girl's bathroom, where Raj find her and they talk about her issues. Raj reminds her that her accomplishment comes with a large cash prize and they go to Beverly Hills to get themselves something. Amy comes back home with a haircut and Sheldon doesn't like the change, to which Leonard calls him out and he panics more once the elevator's finally gotten fixing post 16 years of 0 operation. Sheldon And Penny go drinking and Penny helps Sheldon overcome his issues with change while getting herself pregnant. (The Change Constant)\n\nIn the series finale, Penny and Amy come back home and Amy's happy with how her dress was let in and Penny's was let out. Amy and Sheldon practice Sheldon's speech and Sheldon's jerk behaviour starts slowly coming back. Sheldon and Amy hold a meeting on manners in Sweden and Leonard decides to send the luggage down the elevator, as the group won't fit with all their stuff, he's not too excited once Sheldon compliments him. Amy And Penny discuss Penny's pregnancy and Sheldon's worried she's sick, shocking Amy with how he blew off her pregnancy as a mild thing. Once Howard reveals he and Bernadette are having a meltdown, Sheldon selfishly tells Howard this is his big day and Amy sarcastically calls Sheldon the authority on the subject of selfishness. She says the Nobel isn't more important than their friends and she calls him out on how he's treated them. During the ceremony, Amy encourages women who dream of science to pursue their dream and tells them their own self confidence matters more than the discouragement of others. Sheldon proceeds to make his speech and acknowledges how much his friends mean to him and how much Amy and his friends have changed him into someone better. His declaration of love to his friends leads Penny to tears of joy and he tells Amy he loves her and thanks the audience. The series ends with the 7 friends having dinner.\n\nYoung Sheldon[]\n\nSeason 7[]\n\nShe appeared in the series finale alongside Adult Sheldon. She makes him go to his son's hockey game and reminds him that his parents supported them no matter their differences. Sheldon is also forced to go to acting classes with his daughter because Penny had influenced her when she babysat.\n\nPersonality[]\n\nWhen we first met Amy, she seemed quite emotionless and forward speaking (much like Sheldon). After becoming friends with Penny and Bernadette and before and after becoming Sheldon's girlfriend, we see a new (more fun) side to Amy, where she becomes a more friendly person. She also begins to appear as a voice of reason for Sheldon and teaches him things such as empathy.\n\nThough Amy and Sheldon are very similar, they have some notable differences. She does not, for example, share his love of Star Trek, Star Wars, Indiana Jones, comic books, science-fiction, video games or trains. At first, she does not participate in wearing costumes on a whim like the guys do, though she is excited to wear a couples' costume for Halloween one year and, another time, dresses up as a Star Fleet medical officer the play doctor in order to increase Sheldon's feelings for her. Amy is more willing to socialize with others than Sheldon. While Sheldon generally refuses to accept the need for intimacy, Amy appears to desire the kinds of friendship she was denied as a child. Unlike Sheldon, Amy is very much willing to make friends with people and also makes genuine attempts to get along with other people. She is capable of acknowledging that she is part of a group, as shown in \"The Zazzy Substitution\" when she uses the phrase \"my colleagues and I.\" She also finds people of the opposite sex attractive, although she is initially unable to understand her physical desire for Penny's ex-boyfriend Zack Johnson until it is examined by Sheldon and her. Unlike Sheldon, Amy also considers herself politically correct, and this makes her at times not only annoying but also hypocritical.\n\nAdditionally, she has less of a problem with physical human contact than Sheldon, as seen in \"The 21-Second Excitation\" when she, without hesitation, attempted to engage in \"harmless experimentation with lesbianism\" with Penny, in \"The Love Car Displacement\" when she offered Penny to share a room with her and in \"The Cohabitation Formulation\" when she hugged Penny to comfort her, when Penny got upset over Leonard finding a new girlfriend (Priya). In \"The Agreement Dissection\", she, albeit under the influence of alcohol, kissed Penny on the mouth and later did the same to Sheldon the same night.\n\nAmy and Sheldon know how each other thinks because when it comes to the game \"Counterfactuals\", only they know the correct answers whose logic is very obvious to both of them. Other people like Leonard do not see how they obtain their answers. It's also likely that other people who have IQs would not be able to see how they obtain their answers.\n\nAmy has a habit of being very narcissistic to the point of being callous; when she was asked to be Bernadette's maid of honor, she consistently behaved like the upcoming wedding would be her special day and that she outshone Bernadette, an opinion she never missed an opportunity to voice. When Howard and Bernadette contemplated delaying the wedding, Amy lamented because it wasn't what she wanted, disregarding that it was not essentially her wedding. What differentiates her narcissism from Sheldon's is that she isn't so self-obsessed that she feels obligated to make other people's lives feel completely insignificant to her own. There are also several occasions, far more than Sheldon, where she recognizes what people are feeling and why.\n\nAmy is very blunt and says things that make others feel awkward, though she has developed into a very loyal friend to the girls and a devoted girlfriend to Sheldon. She has low self-esteem, the main reason why she always put up with Sheldon when no one else wants to date her. Until \"The Opening Night Excitation\", she also was a virgin and so was Sheldon. Sheldon was not in a hurry to lose his virginity, but Amy was considering it for a long time before they coupled. She is also allergic to avocados and likes Chaucer, medieval poetry, old French movies and writes \"Little House on the Prairie\" fan fiction.\n\nIn Amy's first appearances, she seemed to be rather serious and not very full of emotion like Sheldon; however, upon becoming Sheldon's girlfriend, her personality transitions to that of a joyful and laid back woman with a sense of fun.\n\nPhysical Appearance[]\n\nAmy is 5' 4\" (1.63 m), brunette and with greenish-blue eye color. Her wardrobe includes red-frame glasses, cardigans or vests worn over plaid or striped shirts, denim skirts, tights and orthopedic shoes and sometimes jumpers or floral dresses on special occasions. She also has modest taste in evening attire. Her hair is usually untied though styled a bit on formal occasions. Amy describes herself through Sheldon in her hypothetical alternate-reality story as \"a cute bespectacled neurobiologist with hair the color of mud\" in \"The Cooper Extraction\".\n\nStarting from the episode \"The Relaxation Integration\", Amy begins wearing a new pair of glasses that are brown-framed and bigger than the previous pair. It is unknown why she started wearing these new glasses.\n\nIn the unaired trailer for the \"The Bow Tie Asymmetry\" tribute to Stephen Hawking, the married Amy had changed her style. Her hair was now up on her head, no stripes or plaids and a plain sweater and skirt though this wardrobe was subsequently never seen again.\n\nAlthough she never really gave much thought to her appearance, Amy started to lament her \"frumpy\" look after seeing her pictures in the media after her and Sheldon's Nobel Prize win (\"The Change Constant\"), acknowledging that it's \"stupid and shallow\" but she just couldn't help it. Raj reluctantly agreed after seeing one particular picture (\"Well, that is an unfortunate angle\"), and convinced her to update her appearance. The next time we saw her, she had (with help from Raj) styled her hair, gotten more attractive glasses and updated her wardrobe, all of which caused Sheldon to freak out due to his well-known aversion to change. Despite this, she retained her updated look through the last episode of the series (\"The Stockholm Syndrome\") after deciding that she was done tiptoeing around Sheldon and his insecurities.\n\nAppearances[]\n\nAppearances\n\nThe Big Bang Theory Episodes 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 Tot Season 1 I 0 Season 2 0 Season 3 1 Season 4 M 15 Season 5 M 21 Season 6 22 Season 7 24 Season 8 24 Season 9 C 24 Season 10 24 Season 11 24 Season 12 24\n\nAppearances\n\nYoung Sheldon Episodes 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 Tot Season 1 M 0 Season 2 C 1 Season 3 M 0 Season 4 V 1 Season 5 C 1 Season 6 0 Season 7 I 1 Appeared M = Mentioned Did not appear Not aired/Not available V = Voiced C = Cameo F = Flashback I = Indirectly mentioned P = Pictured\n\nRelationships[]\n\nPlatonic[]\n\nPenny[]\n\nIn her early appearances, Amy is ambivalent and often condescending towards Penny. After inviting herself to a slumber party with Penny and Bernadette, Amy grew closer to them and was less awkward. Amy is no longer condescending to Penny and things eventually got to the point where she considers Penny to be her best friend (or \"bestie\" as she took to naming her). Penny is the person mainly responsible for Amy's improving social skills, introducing her to drinking and other normal activities such as dancing, shopping, hanging out with friends, gossiping and trash-talking.\n\nAmy values her relationship with Penny very highly. In \"The Infestation Hypothesis\", after Penny found out that Sheldon had manipulated Amy to influence her to get rid of her chair and got mad at Amy, she desperately tried to take it all back by sitting in the chair and was promptly bitten by a an unknown creature living in it. Penny is nice to Amy because she feels some mixture of pity and sympathy, and does what she can to help her socially. Amy likes the arrangement and sometimes would rather hang out with the girls than Sheldon himself. Amy admits that her whole female social life revolves around Penny and that even if she gets mad at her, it wouldn't last. On one occasion, when Penny accidentally offends Amy by hiding a gargantuan and rather unflattering painting of hers, Penny rushes over to Amy's apartment to rescue their friendship and rehangs the painting in her apartment. Penny had already gotten used to Sheldon's personality which helped her deal with Amy's personality and quirks.\n\nIn \"The Speckerman Recurrence\", Amy expressed her delight at being best friends with a bully, namely Penny, when the latter was revealed to have been a bully during her high school days. Penny decided to make amends by apologizing to the girl she once bullied, but was unsuccessful in her accepting the apology. In the end, it was Amy who suggested a way for Penny to make amends, by showing altruism in the form of donating her clothes to the needy. In \"The Weekend Vortex\", after Sheldon upset Amy by choosing an intensive weekend of gaming over accompanying her to her aunt's birthday party, despite already giving his word that he would, Amy confided in Penny and Penny gave her advice on confronting Sheldon. When Amy proved to lack the necessary self-esteem with which to confront him, Penny stood up for Amy and confronted Sheldon for being a bad boyfriend.\n\nAmy occasionally displays signs of a bisexual infatuation or curiosity with Penny, often making inappropriate comments. For instance, when Penny, in an effort to persuade Sheldon to let her cut his hair in \"The Werewolf Transformation\", asked Amy for her opinion, Amy's response was \"There is not a hair on my body that I wouldn't let this woman trim,\" resulting in discomfort on Penny's part. On another occasion, after kissing Penny on the lips (Amy was drunk), she sings from Katy Perry's song, \"I kissed a girl, and I liked it.\" In \"The Pulled Groin Extrapolation\", when Amy and Penny were discussing Amy's theory that Leonard had fallen in love with her, Amy told Penny that Leonard did not get her \"motors running\" and that Penny had a better shot than Leonard making Penny uncomfortable. When Amy misunderstood Penny and thought she was carrying Sheldon's baby, rather than being concerned that her husband slept with her, she just wanted to know if they were \"sister wives\".\n\nShe does recognize Penny's shortcomings and tries to avoid discussing them so they can remain on good terms. In \"The Anything Can Happen Thursday Recurrence\", Amy did admit to Leonard that she is jealous of the close personal friendship between Sheldon and Penny and how comfortable he is around her.\n\nIn \"The Hook-up Reverberation\", Penny wonders how she could get Raj's new girlfriend Emily to like her. Amy says that she could hang around her pretending to be her friend and then before you know it you're in her apartment drinking her wine and eating her food. Penny says that that won't work even though Amy's suggestion mirrors her own relationship with Penny.\n\nIn \"The Viewing Party Combustion\", during a fight Leonard points out to Penny the weird brother/sister relationship she and Sheldon has which Amy is jealous of. She wants to have the same kind of friendship with Sheldon. Penny often takes Sheldon's side due to her sibling feelings for him.\n\nIn \"The Matrimonial Metric\", after Sheldon and Amy test their friends to pick members of their wedding party, Penny suddenly realizes that Amy is her best friend. She then gets pissed that Amy didn't chose her best friend as maid of honor. She bursts into Amy's apartment calls her an idiot if she doesn't choose her best friend as her maid of honor. Amy is very excited when Penny admits that they are best friends, hugs her tightly and calls her \"Bestie.\" Earlier in the season, Amy wonders if she is letting her friendship with Penny suffer because she was now living with her boyfriend.\n\nIn \"The Reclusive Potential\", matron of honor Penny throws Amy a bachelorette party that consisted of a quilting bee since Amy loves those things. Amy is disappointed wanting something wilder, so they go out drinking and she passes out quickly. Later Penny and Bernadette describe all these wild things that Amy did so she thinks she had a good time.\n\nIn \"The Bow Tie Asymmetry\", Penny organizes picking up the relatives and is overwhelmed by Amy's mother's comments and personality. When the wedding is delayed due to the absence of the bride and groom she explodes when she finds Sheldon, Amy and Leonard \"doing science\" instead of getting married. Sheldon agrees with Penny so the wedding starts. Penny is bursting with pride at the wedding ceremony of her two best friends getting married.\n\nIn \"The Stockholm Syndrome\", Leonard and Penny are keeping a secret that she is expecting. When Amy and Penny go to their final dress fitting, Amy is very happy that hers had to be let in and Penny's had to be let out. She doesn't realize that Penny is pregnant. Also she is unhappy that Penny didn't tell her earlier since they are besties. At the ceremony Amy encourages all women interested in science to go for it.\n\nBernadette[]\n\nAmy is also close to Bernadette they are best friends, though not as close as she is with Penny (of the three, Amy considers Bernadette to be 'the least cool'). She is also most direct and condescending to her early on in their friendship calling her \"needy\" and \"insecure\". Amy and Bernadette are both biologists and possess doctorates, making them able to converse intellectually. Amy had once called Bernadette a wildebeest, but quickly adds \"with hair that smells of strawberries\" after Bernadette's reaction showing that Amy cares enough about her to try and compliment a positive quality after insulting her, and is very excited to be a bridesmaid at Bernadette's wedding. Bernadette, though she at times feels that Amy is creepy, values her enough and to make up with her for not asking Amy to join her bridesmaid dress shopping session with Penny, to make Amy her maid of honor. Bernadette is more uncomfortable with Amy's \"outside of the box\" comments, while Penny is more used to them having been friends with Sheldon.\n\nIn \"The Speckerman Recurrence\", Amy and Bernadette shared the stories of how they were bullied during their school years, with Bernadette's involving a case of having her clothes taken away by Tammy Bockneck and replaced with an elf costume that turned out to be too big for her, and Amy's with having hairy knuckles due to have Rogaine added to her hand lotion. They were not surprised when they found out that out of the three girls, Penny was the only one who left high school unscathed, as she was the one doing the bullying. Bernadette also acts as a kind of translator, translating Amy's words such as \"assuage\" and \"altruism\" to versions that are much simpler that Penny can understand. There are oftentimes where her closeness with Penny overshadows Bernadette.\n\nIn \"The Hofstadter Insufficiency\", Bernadette spends time with just Amy at a medical convention. They like getting able to talk shop without Penny around who prefers to talk about boys. While at the bar, two guys send drinks over to their table which excites both of them. Then Bernadette remarks that no one would blame her for following up because her boyfriend is so \"Sheldon\" making Amy mad. That night they make up and bond over having been hit on. Ironically, when asked which guy they would have liked, each of them chooses a guy more like their other friend's better half.\n\nIn \"The Focus Attenuation\", Bernadette and Amy go out partying in Las Vegas while Penny stays in her room studying for her job. They return quite drunk urging Penny to join them at a male strip club. Amy steals Penny's laptop and Bernadette wants to get cozy with the male dancers.\n\nAfter Amy and Bernadette become better friends from bonding over their mutual love of science, Amy develops a little girl crush on Bernadette and her curvaceous figure.\n\nAfter Amy breaks up with Sheldon, Bernadette helps her through it since Penny has been busy as a newlywed. In \"The 2003 Approximation\", Sheldon asks Amy to become his roommate to replace Leonard who moved in with his wife. She declines; however, she does defend Sheldon when Bernadette calls him a weirdo. Amy still finds him brilliant and insightful.\n\nBernadette gives birth TO her daughter Halley Wolowitz on Amy's birthday when she is trying to have birthday coitus with Sheldon.\n\nIn \"The Matrimonial Metric\", Shamy is testing their friends for positions in their wedding party. When the gang finds out, none of them want to be in their wedding party. Howard shows up at Amy's explaining that what she did was cruel, though Bernadette finds her actions appealing and still wants to be her maid of honor. Before Amy can call her, Penny breaks in and tells Amy that she is her best friends and should be her maid of honor which thrills Amy making her forget about Bernadette.\n\nLeonard[]\n\nAmy and Leonard did not have good first impressions of each other, but eventually became best friends. Amy always seemed to look down on Leonard based upon Sheldon's observations and Leonard called her judgmental, sanctimonious, and just plain obnoxious; however, their relationship improves gradually. Finally, in \"The Pulled Groin Extrapolation\", Amy asked Leonard to be her date to a wedding instead of Sheldon. They ended up enjoying each other at the wedding and Leonard commented that Amy really knows how to make a guy loosen up and have a good time. When Amy called Sheldon while drunk in \"The Isolation Permutation\", Leonard and Sheldon went to pick her up in a liquor store parking lot at Leonard's insistence. Leonard ended up being the person helping Amy up and walked with her as they made their way to take her back to her apartment. Amy giggled when she said that he had found \"second base\". In \"The Flaming Spittoon Acquisition\", Stuart asked Leonard to be the guy who checks in with Sheldon regarding his response to him asking Amy out. In \"The Status Quo Combustion\", Leonard lets Sheldon go on his train trip and Amy explodes, hitting him with a pillow for doing so. When Leonard stayed with Amy and Bernadette at a bar after they had lied to Sheldon and Penny, Leonard wondered why he and Amy didn't hang out together more often. Amy said it was weird when they did.\n\nIronically, the two share some similarities with a few they don't seem to be aware of: both have PhD's, both wear glasses, both had difficult childhoods caused by their mothers who they don't like (Leonard's being unaffectionate and Amy's being strict), they have both been hugged by Sheldon and he would hate to lose them, both have connections with Harvard (Leonard's brother is a law professor and Amy was a student) and they are very devoted to their main lovers (Leonard = Penny & Amy = Sheldon).\n\nIn \"The Celebration Experimentation\", Sheldon ran into the bathroom after overwhelmed by the birthday party they were throwing him. Leonard and Amy argue over who knew him better to talk to him. Leonard has known him longer, but Amy and Sheldon have seen each other naked. Penny goes instead.\n\nWhen Amy starts living with Sheldon, she talks to Leonard for advice. He also encourages her not to give up after she has second thoughts about her current situation.\n\nIn \"The Solo Oscillation\", Sheldon throws Amy out of the apartment so he can have some quiet time to work. She hangs out in Leonard and Penny's apartment and starts to bond with Leonard. They were both spelling bee champions and they bore Penny with a night of them trying to stump each other with spelling words. The next night they start reenacting old high school science projects like creating hot ice and building a wave front out of popsicle sticks.\n\nHoward[]\n\nAmy's relationship with Howard is somewhat complicated exactly the same way as it is with Sheldon, but they are best friends. She, like Sheldon and Dr. Gablehauser, makes fun of Howard for lacking a doctorate and for his other idiosyncrasies; however, in \"The Scavenger Vortex,\" she and Howard spend time alone together for the first time and bond over a mutual love for Neil Diamond music, planning concert trips and ending the episode with karaoke. She appears to have more normal fun with Howard than with Sheldon. They once talked about doing it again, but in \"The Fermentation Bifurcation\", it's revealed that they haven't followed up on it since then and their mutual conversation can be difficult. In \"The Collaboration Contamination\", Howard and Amy are working together on a brain controlled robotic device. Howard astonishes her with his magic and they spend free time listening to music and each dancing together, things Amy doesn't get to do with Sheldon.\n\nRaj[]\n\nAmy's relationship with Rajesh Koothrappali is kind of complicated, but they remain best friends. Her relationship with him can be described the same way it is with Sheldon. In \"The Santa Simulation\", the guys choose to play a game of Dungeons and Dragons over\n\nplans with their girls, prompting Amy, Penny, and Bernadette go to a club for a ladies night. Raj tags along with them after his D&D character dies within the first five minutes. At the club while the girls are trying to help Raj find a girl, Raj reveals to them that he had a thing for Penny and Bernadette, but always tries to like a friend's girlfriend one at a time. Amy then says that Raj must have had a thing for her, but he responds with a no. Hurt by the comment, Amy reveals her past sad experiences about guys, like how one time she passed out at a frat mixer and woke up with more clothes on her, Raj then empathizes with her about his troubles with girls and they smile a little at each other with Amy commenting on her current relationship with Sheldon and how it could happen with Raj and a girl. When they all are about to leave, Amy says that she's good now that she knows Raj likes her and Raj follows out with Penny saying that he kind of likes her now that he knows she's not into him. Improving on the relationship between Amy and Raj now that they both know they are together in the overlooked department of the opposite gender. In \"The Friendship Turbulence\", Raj asks Amy to respond to a girl that answered Raj's dating site. Though the girl thinks that Raj is too shy and passive, she does strike up a friendship with Amy. After Raj charges in on their coffee get-together, he ruins a possible friendship with Emily for both of them. Amy is the only member of the group that regularly calls him \"Rajesh\".

He asks Amy to be his wing man and contact her for him. She finds out that they have a lot in common, such as going to Harvard, liking Chaucer, and needlepoint. They arrange to meet for coffee though Amy tells Raj that she finds him too passive by not contacting her himself. Raj charges into their coffee time to show that he isn't passive, unfortunately now she thinks he's weird and has no boundaries. She leaves also breaking another meeting with Amy who loses her as a friend. They eventually mend fences after Emily starts dating Raj. When Sheldon says he needs an appointment with Emily to check on some butt freckles, Amy is bothered by the fact that she gets Sheldon to take his pants off to her within a few minutes of meeting her while Amy herself has gotten nothing close to any sexual intercourse from him. They are never seen meeting separately as friends after she joins The Social Group.\n\nMary Cooper[]\n\nEarly in her relationship with Sheldon, Mary shows up when Leonard asked her to come. He had broken up with Amy and began collecting dozens of cats. Mary used reverse psychology to get them back together even though Sheldon thinks that his mother doesn't approve of Amy. Amy finds that quite titillating. The next time they are seen together is in \"The Convergence Convergence\", Mary calls her Sheldon's young lady friend and asks Amy to call her Mary. She is the first to notice the growing affection between Mary and Dr. Alfred Hofstadter. Earlier in \"The Matrimonial Momentum\", its revealed that Mary is accepting of Amy and is fond of her. Amy was in Mary's nightly prayers and she also told Sheldon to keep her grandmother's ring in case he got back together with Amy and wished to propose to her. Also, in \"The Meemaw Materialization\", Meemaw says that Mary is okay with Amy.

She spills the beans about the secret. Finally she agrees to not stand in the way of their relationship.\n\nBeverly Hofstadter[]\n\nDuring Sheldon's birthday party, Beverly attends it with Amy and Bernadette, but were not seen mingling. In \"The Line Substitution Solution Penny had a girl's night dinner where she was trying to find some common ground with her mother-in-law. Beverly found more in common with scientists Bernadette and Amy discussing their work, until a completely angry Penny yelled at Beverly for being an insult all day, until she admitted that she was hurt that Penny married Leonard without inviting her or even telling her the wedding was taking place, which then prompted the two of them to connect when Penny decided on a wedding redo while Beverly was still in town. Amy and Beverly are both neuroscientists.\n\nAlfred Hofstadter[]\n\nAmy's relationship with Leonard's father Alfred hasn't gone so far because in Alfred's first appearance, he meets Amy for the first time and they just politely greet each other, but they are likely going to be on good terms. Driving Alfred and Mary Cooper to the pre-wedding dinner, Amy is first to notice their attraction to each other and this continues at dinner. She is surprised that Sheldon notices nothing.

Though Sheldon disapproved of the reliability of dating sites, he changed his mind upon meeting Amy and the two have been close ever since. Amy can be seen smiling to herself at the counter standing next to Sheldon. It was revealed at the beginning of season 4 that Amy and Sheldon have been communicating via texting daily with each other for about four months, yet they have not met yet, other than the first encounter at the end of season 3. Amy and Sheldon regularly interact via the many different technological portals such as Facebook, Twitter, text messaging, and video chatting. Their relationship grew stronger throughout the entire season 4. For example, they met each other's mothers, they had meals together, and she got him engaged in social science experiments which involved them spreading gossip that they have slept together, that never happened. Amy and Sheldon are still virgins. He was even there when she had to buy feminine hygiene supplies once. Sheldon described Amy as his friend who is a girl, but not his girlfriend, and Amy similarly described their relationship as \"boy slash friend slash girl slash friend\". Their relationship earned them the title \"Shamy\" from their friends. As the series progresses; however, it is implied that their relationship has evolved into non-platonic yet non-romantic in seasons four and five.\n\nIn \"The Zazzy Substitution\", Sheldon revealed that Amy had licked her thumb to remove raspberry jelly from the corner of his mouth. Later, when they terminated their relationship over a dispute about whose area of expertise is superior, Sheldon started collecting cats. He even commented that cats make great companions since they do not argue or question his intellectual authority. His mother uses reverse psychology to help them make up, so Sheldon negotiates a reconciliation with Amy.\n\nIn \"The Alien Parasite Hypothesis\", Amy became attracted to Penny's friend Zack. She could not figure that out initially, so she and Sheldon analyzed the symptoms she had when encountering Zack. One of the conclusions was sexual arousal, but based on her personality, Sheldon doubted that and first believed in other illogical answers such as menopause or an alien parasite.

She experiments handing hands with him on the way home, but feels nothing.\n\nIn \"The Agreement Dissection\", a drunken Amy kissed Sheldon, and although the kiss was short, Sheldon commented on her actions as fascinating. She also gave him good advice on how to handle the problems he was having with Priya regarding her meddling in his Roommate Agreement with Leonard. And they participate in some eccentric dancing.\n\nIn season 5, their relationship seems to have grown even stronger. While in season 4's \"The Desperation Emanation\", Sheldon gave his blessings to Leonard to date Amy, in season 5's \"The Pulled Groin Extrapolation\", when Leonard unknowingly insinuated that he and Amy had had sex, Sheldon karate-chopped him and said, \"She is not for you!\"\n\nIn \"The Isolation Permutation\", Sheldon grew extremely worried when he could not reach Amy and discovered that she was upset at being left out by Penny and Bernadette on their bridesmaid dress shopping expedition. Sheldon, however unwillingly, ended up cuddling on the couch with Amy after an exchange of counter-offers which included sex, a pat on the head, French kissing, and a neck massage.\n\nIn \"The Ornithophobia Diffusion\", Amy hinted jealousy at the sight of Sheldon being all sweet and infatuated with a bird he called his \"little Lovey-Dovey\". Amy also suggested early on that in order for Sheldon to get over his fear of birds, he needed to interact with it, just like how he did with the mailman, showing how familiar she is with his personal life.\n\nThe turning point in their relationship is in \"The Flaming Spittoon Acquisition.\" When Stuart asks her out for coffee, Amy agrees since she finds Stuart nice and funny. She was also influenced by both Penny and Bernadette; Penny advised her that after over a year being with Sheldon and with nothing really going on, it is fine for her to look around, and Bernadette agreed since Amy and Sheldon are not engaged. Her date prompted suppressed jealousy from Sheldon, and after talking with Penny, Sheldon ended up interrupting their date at the movies. Amy told Sheldon that given their relationship status, she is free to do whatever she wants, even if her actions get Sheldon's disapproval. Sheldon responds that he is willing to change their relationship status, with the stipulation that nothing changes physical or otherwise. He indirectly then directly asks Amy whether she is willing to be his girlfriend, and she agrees. Sheldon leaves immediately afterwards. Later, outside her apartment, Amy had a nice conversation with Stuart. Sheldon knocks from inside and tells them to wrap things up. Sheldon then introduces the Relationship Agreement to her and though she thought it was romantic, she did find the terms restrictive, to which Sheldon told her to get a lawyer if she wants to. Amy agreed to the terms and as of that point, they are officially a couple.\n\nIn \"The Shiny Trinket Maneuver\", Sheldon and Amy revealed that their date night is once a month on every second Thursday or the third one, in a one with five Thursdays, as per The Relationship Agreement. They had their first \"couple's fight\" when Sheldon did not show any interest in Amy's big news, that her article was to be featured in a distinguished journal. Instead, Sheldon was more invested in the fact that he just reached 100 followers on Twitter. Upset, Amy left the date. Sheldon was oblivious to what happened until Penny told him that as Amy's boyfriend, he needs to be excited by the things she is excited by, even if he is not.\n\nLeonard tells Sheldon that he can buy Amy's affection, and he agrees. He gets Penny to help him pick the perfect gift at a jewelry store. Once they buy it, Sheldon has Penny call Amy over to her apartment so he can talk to her. When Amy arrived, she was still upset and voiced out that she does not want to talk to him; however, upon opening her gift, which turned out to be a tiara, Amy became giddy and excited and asked Penny to put it on her as she claimed to be a princess. She ecstatically kissed and hugged Sheldon, signaling she was no longer upset. Sheldon hugged her back, but acknowledged that a tiara was a bit too much.\n\nIn \"The Beta Test Initiation\", Sheldon decided to create his own podcast show on vexillology, the study of flags and related paraphernalia. Amy volunteered to be his assistant on the show, acting alongside him, providing ideas to better the show, and dressing up as a pretzel when Sheldon was explaining the Bavarian flag. There was a part during the recording of the first episode of Sheldon's show that Amy patiently acted her part over and over again, since Sheldon mentioned Take 47 at one point. When Amy made a suggestion to put a face on her \"surrender\" flag to attract younger viewers, Sheldon called her idea brilliant, showing that they are on the same wavelength.\n\nIn \"The Vacation Solution\", Sheldon decided to spend his forced vacation working with Amy at her laboratory. Despite his intelligence, and her excitement at being able to work with him, calling it romantic, Amy remained professional and gave Sheldon simple tasks that could be done by an average person, simply because Sheldon had no previous exposure to biology, and is not used to working in a laboratory like hers. Sheldon, however, failed to perform any of the tasks satisfactorily, despite complaining that those tasks were below his ability. He even, at one point, accused Amy of purposely giving him menial tasks for fear that he could easily be better than her, since he is smarter. The two got into a heated argument, with Sheldon being his usual condescending self. Annoyed, Amy let Sheldon attempt the work she was doing, which is slicing the locus coeruleus. Sheldon accidentally cut his finger and passed out. He was kicked out of the laboratory. Later, after talking to Penny, Sheldon came back to the laboratory and apologized for his behavior, though he attempted it several times since Amy wanted a real apology and he refused to do so. He finally gave in and she allowed him to work in the laboratory, asking him to continue washing the beakers since they were still dirty. Sheldon will compromise more with Amy than with anyone else even to the point of apologizing.\n\nIn \"The Weekend Vortex\", Sheldon promised to go to Amy's Aunt Flora's 93rd birthday party; however, when the guys announced that they will be having a 48-hour Star Wars online gaming marathon; Sheldon had a change of heart. Amy demanded he keep his word as she followed all the protocols stipulated in The Relationship Agreement regarding traveling. After some arguing and failing to find a loophole, Sheldon agreed to join Amy. The next morning, Amy told Sheldon how grateful she was that he decided to honor his commitment to her. The only reason he was going; however, was because he planned to join the online gaming while at the party. Upset, Amy said that if gaming was more important to him than accompanying her to avoid the embarrassment she would face, he could stay. Sheldon did not get her sarcasm and used it as an out to stay, even telling her to bring back a slice of cake for him. Amy went ahead and as expected, had an awful time with her family regarding her absent boyfriend. She sought Penny's advice on the matter and they barged into Sheldon and Leonard's apartment while they were gaming, to create a scene. Amy wasn't good enough at lying to cause much ruckus, so Penny told him that how he stood her up had hurt her. Sheldon thought he understood why she was upset, but of course his reasoning came from an egotistical place. He offered her Cooper Coupons to make it up to her. Amy accepted the concession and was actually excited by some of the offers in the coupon book.\n\nIn \"The Launch Acceleration\", Amy, inspired by the progress of the relationships of her friends, decided to make Sheldon develop feelings for her. She used her skills in neurobiology and knowledge of humans' emotional attachments, as well as her knowledge of Sheldon's likes and dislikes, in an experiment to achieve her goal. She started off by holding their monthly date night at her apartment. When Amy voiced out her desire to progress their relationship, Sheldon was quick to refuse it, since he thought they were already moving quickly. He was skeptical she could change his mind, but humored her because he might find her experiment amusing. Amy anticipated his reaction and wasn't deterred. She turned on some \"romantic\" music: the Super Mario Bros' theme song, Sheldon's favorite from his childhood. He told her it was not going to work, but could not help himself from humming along to the tune. For dinner, they had a few more of his childhood favorites: Strawberry Quik and spaghetti with sliced hot dogs. He was excited and happy against his will. Sheldon confided in Leonard that Amy's efforts to get him to increase his feelings for her were working, and it was distracting him. He wondered if such thoughts could be stopped. At the end of the episode, Leonard caught Sheldon and Amy playing doctor, Star Trek-style. Amy even dressed up in a Star Trek medical uniform despite her previous rule against dressing up in costumes.\n\nIn \"The Countdown Reflection\", Amy told Bernadette that she thinks Sheldon's eidetic memory is sexy and even made\n\nhim recite the ingredients in a can of Pringles. Later when Howard and Bernadette tried to get married at the City Hall, Amy asked Sheldon if being there made him think, but it went over his head. She was disappointed when Sheldon was addressing the bride and groom and told them he hopes that they will find happiness together just as he has found happiness alone. Later however, to her surprise, Sheldon took her hand as Howard was launched into space.\n\nAt the beginning of season six, Amy and Sheldon are shown regularly dating each other. In \"The Date Night Variable\", Sheldon invites Raj along for their second anniversary dinner much to Amy's annoyance. After Raj leaves, Amy demands from Sheldon a statement from the heart or she was leaving him.

He eventually learns that he should support Amy in disagreements.\n\nIn \"The Parking Spot Escalation\", Amy backs up Sheldon in his fight for Howard's parking space, helping him put his name back on the space and leaving her car parked in it. She gets more intimate by showing him the results of her first bikini wax though Sheldon only comments about all the band aids it required.\n\nIn \"The Fish Guts Displacement\", Sheldon finds Amy has the flu and she asks him to take care of her per The Relationship Agreement. First Sheldon says that that is meant for her to take care of him and then leaves.\n\nMoments later, Sheldon says that he cares about her well-being so he will take care of her, though he wants to get through it quickly. His plan for her treatment includes putting a rag on her forehead, singing to her (probably \"Soft Kitty\"), and rubbing Vick's vapor rub on her chest. Sick Amy sits up surprised and wants to start with the Vick's. Sheldon, of course, does not realize the sexual implications. He also frequently bathes her. Amy milks the situation for a few days after she is healed, but she is found out when takes a throat culture from her which says that she is no longer sick. Amy apologizes. Sheldon is disappointed because he thought their relationship was based on trust and mutual respect. He says that she needs to be punished so that that it doesn't happen again. He decides to spank her, which she seems to enjoy.\n\nIn \"The Bakersfield Expedition\", she develops an interest in comic books and debates the physical properties of Thor's hammer with the other girls. Her, Bernadette's, and Penny's interest in comic books excites the boys.\n\nIn \"The Cooper/Kripke Inversion\", he and Kripke exchange papers concerning a theory they are both researching. Sheldon is distraught to find that Kripke's paper is much better than his and allows Amy to hug him. When Kripke explains that the reason his paper is better than Sheldon's is because Sheldon is having sex with Amy and, therefore, has less time to work on the research, Sheldon doesn't correct him. He continues to use his \"sexual exploits\" as an excuse. Later admits to Penny and Leonard that he does not rule out the idea that he might engage in coitus with Amy sometime in the future.\n\nIn \"The Spoiler Alert Segmentation\", Leonard moves out and Amy tries to convince him that she would be his ideal new roommate. She is familiar with all his habits and his personality quirks that others find rage inducing. Sheldon is uncomfortable with increased intimacy with Amy and also learns from Penny that she doesn't want Leonard to move in with her. Sheldon finally tells Amy that she can't move in and that it's Penny's fault. Amy confronts Penny who tells Sheldon why he didn't tell Amy that he didn't want her to move in instead of blaming it on her. Amy calls Sheldon a coward, which he agrees with. In \"The Tangible Affection Proof\", Sheldon has Alex buy Amy a Valentine's Day gift and she does such a great job with the third option, the signed brain cell print that Sheldon keeps it. Amy shows up after canceling their romantic dinner and tells him that they'll eat pizza and watch one of his Star Trek/War movies since that is what he really loves. Sheldon shows Amy that she is now his emergency point of contact at the university which sends Amy into tears. He really trusts her.\n\nIn \"The Love Spell Potential\", after Amy was upset about the notion that their D&D characters should have sex, as it was not going to happen in real life, Sheldon was sent to comfort her. Although initially unwilling, he listened to her complain about how the others thought their relationship was a joke. Sheldon doesn't think that. Amy asked him if they would ever have an intimate relationship. Sheldon told her before he met her; he wasn't interested in being intimate with anyone. Amy prompted him to see if he felt any differently now, and he admitted it was a possibility between them. This confession didn't really cheer her up, so he explained to her, that although it didn't feel like it to her, to him it did feel really intimate. Amy knew how he felt, but always wishes they could have more. Sheldon manages to cheer her up by pointing out that they had only known each other for three years and they were already in bed with each other (technically sitting on Sheldon's bed). Amy said they should go back to the others, but Sheldon stopped her, and very calmly pointed out that as they had had a love spell put on their characters in the game, it would only be right to carry it on. And so alone in his room, away from all others, he allowed her to experience a form of virtual intimacy, using a dice to decide what to do next. Upon getting a throw she didn't like, he was willing to break the rules and throw again (which for him is quite impressive).\n\nIn \"The Raiders Minimization\", Sheldon shares with Amy one of his favorite movies, \"Raiders of the Lost Ark\". She enjoys it, but points out a major error in the movie. Since she spoiled the movie for him, and ultimately the group,\n\nSheldon tries to spoil something that she likes. They start watching her childhood favorite show, \"Little House on the Prairie\", and he keeps pointing out inaccuracies. She quickly picks up on what he is doing and tells him that since they are in a relationship, he should tell her when he is angry with her instead of seek revenge. They both apologize, though he still tells her what is wrong with the comic strip Garfield, showing that while he's changed a lot with her, he can still be childish.\n\nIn \"The Workplace Proximity\", Amy starts working on an experiment at Caltech which does not bother Sheldon at first. After Howard's comments how he would not want to work all day near Bernadette, Sheldon withdraws his approval though Amy still plans to work there. Embarrassing Amy in front of her co-workers at lunch with inappropriate ethnic comments and talking about the status of their relationship, Amy is extremely unhappy with him. Late at night he comes to her apartment to apologize. He calls her something of a weirdo. They do manage to say that they like each other quirks and all. Sheldon then ruins the moment by adding that she should like him since he doesn't see anyone else knocking at her door. Later Amy tells Penny and Bernadette that she is not apologizing to Sheldon sounding like she wants him to treat her better in the future.\n\nIn \"The Romance Resonance\", Sheldon makes a great scientific discovery of a new super-heavy element which thrills Sheldon until he realizes he made a bone-headed error in his calculations. Everyone still praises him, much to his\n\nannoyance. Amy first tries to soothe him like everyone else until she finally agrees with him taking his side in their relationship.

Later when it looks like Sheldon is about to actually kiss Amy, Amy comes out of \"the zone\" and her wishful daydream.\n\nIn \"The Thanksgiving Decoupling\", when Sheldon doesn't want to go to Mrs. Wolowitz's for Thanksgiving; he starts to compare his life to that of a slave. Amy tells him that he can't do that because it is inappropriate, he responds by saying \"Yes, Miss Amy.\" When Amy hears that a drunken Sheldon has been mean to Howard she demands he apologize, he relents and says that he is sorry. Afterwards he looks at Amy and then says to everyone \"Ain't she great?\" Amy is flattered and smiles, Sheldon then abruptly says \"Now, how's about you get us a couple of beers?\" and follows by smacking her rear. Amy, shocked, starts to walk slowly toward the kitchen as a dazed smile appears on her face. Amy looks back at Sheldon, who smiles back wholeheartedly.\n\nIn \"The Discovery Dissipation\", Amy asks Wil Wheaton to talk to Sheldon to have him deal with his new found fame over his discovery of a stable super-heavy element even she and Wil had not gotten along.\n\nIn \"The Cooper Extraction\", Amy points out to the gang that most of them would not know each other if Sheldon had not\n\nbeen part of their lives, as they tell stories about how their lives would be different. Amy diagrams their discussions and then Leonard shows her Sheldon's series of screen saver photos of scientists, super heroes, and her, making her very happy. After Sheldon returns she keeps smiling at him, and does reach up and touch him momentarily. She is also interested in how he felt holding his baby nephew, hoping that he might want to have one with her. In \"The Locomotion Manipulation\", Amy arranges for a Valentine's Day weekend trip to a Napa Valley bed and breakfast inn for the two of them. They will travel on a vintage train and have a romantic dinner together. To make Sheldon more comfortable Howard and Bernadette will be with them and they will have separate rooms. After Sheldon tells her that she is manipulating him, Amy admits that she was looking for some romance. Peeved, Sheldon tells her that he will give her romance.
