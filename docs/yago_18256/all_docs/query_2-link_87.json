I wasn’t concerned at all.”\n\nBut during surgery, he suffered a sudden drop in blood pressure. When Leslie regained consciousness, he couldn’t feel his legs.\n\n“The doctors were kind of freaking out,” said Amy. “The brutal part is that we still haven’t got a clear answer as to what caused the paralysis.”\n\nThe combination of Ryan’s infection, diabetes and the drop in blood pressure may have cut off blood flow to his spine.\n\n“When someone is in a car crash, you think maybe they could be paralyzed, but when it happens like this, it’s just a shocker,” said Amy. “There’s a chance he regains sensation, but he may not.”\n\nAdvertisement 5\n\nStory continues below\n\nThis advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.\n\nArticle content\n\nLeslie’s parents flew in from Saskatchewan last week to lend their support. Amy’s parents arrived on the weekend to help out, so she can spend more time at the hospital.\n\nFour years ago, Ryan, Amy and their children, Liam, 9, and Casey, 7, moved to Bellevue, Wash.\n\nLiam played his first season of tackle football last year, coached by his dad.\n\n“He really enjoyed it,” said Leslie. “What I love about football is you don’t have to be the best athlete on the field to find success and contribute to the team and enjoy that team experience.”\n\nLeslie was getting ready to serve as president of Seahawks Junior Football in Bellevue for the coming season, but now plans to step down.\n\nHe always gravitated to positions of leadership and his impact on the kids he coached in B.C. is incalculable, said Lalji, who visited Leslie in hospital this past weekend.\n\nAdvertisement 6\n\nStory continues below\n\nThis advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.\n\nArticle content\n\n“Coaching is such a simple thing to do to help young people build confidence,” said Leslie. “It’s amazing how learning a skill and learning discipline becomes a layer that leads to other achievements. It can really be life-changing.”\n\nIt was Leslie and Lalji who resurrected the New Westminster Hyacks youth and high school football programs in 2003 after the organization collapsed in the 1970s.\n\n“Ryan coached more than 1,000 kids over the years, and our youth program had unprecedented growth when he was our president,” he said. “He’s a gentle giant, a big guy, but he has a really disarming way about him. He can work with kids of all ages.”\n\nAs an administrator, Leslie was highly organized and was able to leverage his professional analytical and information technology skills to keep the organization running smoothly.\n\nAdvertisement 7\n\nStory continues below\n\nThis advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.\n\nArticle content\n\n“He coached with me when we started up the Hyacks and then he coached on the high school side of the program until 2006,” said Lalji. “Then he ran our youth program until 2014. He was heavily involved.”\n\nLeslie also served on the board of the Vancouver Mainland Football League.\n\n“Ryan has a lot of ties to the community in this province,” said Lalji. “I have calls coming in from all over, from people who want to help him.”\n\nLeslie created a legacy of deep commitment in the Hyack Football organization, said Hyacks atom team coach Bill McDonnell.\n\n“Ryan led by example,” he said. “He would be helping out in practices at every level, he would help coach at the flag level, the atom tackle, the pew wee tackle, and then be there for high school practices.”\n\nLeslie left big shoes to fill when he left for Washington, but the coaches really stepped up based on the example he had set, McDonnell said.\n\nEven after he had been gone for several years, Leslie still made trips back to B.C. to run football clinics.\n\n“This year, the senior team made it to the championship game, and there he is, in the stands,” he said.\n\nrshore@postmedia.com\n\nArticle content\n\nShare this article in your social network\n\nLatest National Stories"
