        "text": "A lifelong educator and national thought leader for teaching and learning, Dr. Felicia C. Smith brings decades of valuable experience to advance NCFL’s mission of working to eradicate poverty through education solutions for families.\n\nSmith has led the organization in casting a bold new vision that helps to create equitable communities where children and families may thrive. NCFL is forging new partnerships in the field to accelerate family learning systems of support as a revolutionary idea for multigenerational learning and impact. This means children and parenting adults or caregivers will have greater access and opportunities to programmatic support for enhancing educational attainment and economic prosperity.\n\nSmith’s career in education spans more than two decades where she has served in a variety of leadership roles in P-12, higher education, nonprofit, and philanthropy. Her unique vantage point of a learner’s educational trajectory, from preschool to adulthood, is a result of her experience in leading across multiple education systems. Prior to joining NCFL, Smith was the senior director of Global Delivery at the National Geographic Society, where she oversaw the domestic and global education strategy implementation and programming focused on transforming the classroom experience for millions of students and educators.&nbsp; Before this, Smith served as assistant superintendent of Teaching and Learning in the 27th largest urban district (Jefferson County Public Schools, Louisville, Kentucky); as a senior program officer at the Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation; as associate commissioner for the Kentucky Department of Education; and teacher leader. She began her career as a classroom teacher in the elementary grades and has taught as a preservice lecturer at the University of Kentucky.\n\nSmith is driven by her commitment to equity and excellence for every learner. She has been a fierce advocate for teacher leadership programs, competency-based education, college and career readiness, policy transformation, and professional learning. Her non-traditional pathway to leadership has helped her maintain a focus on improving learning outcomes by ensuring effective classroom practices spread and scale across systems. She has advocated for transforming teacher preparation and in-service practices to promote the knowledge, skills, and dispositions necessary for educators to effectively implement innovative practices addressing the needs of learners.\n\nSmith has been recognized as an Aspen-Pahara education fellow and serves as a member of several national and local boards. Smith serves as Vice Chair of the Southern Regional Education Board, and in 2022, was appointed by Kentucky Governor Andy Beshear to chair the state’s Early Childhood Advisory Council. At the forefront of centering equity in education through inclusive programming, in 2021 she was selected to participate in The Equity Lab’s prestigious year-long Nexus Fellowship.\n\nSmith holds an Ed.D. in Education Leadership and Administration from the University of Kentucky, an M.A. in elementary education with an emphasis on K-12 literacy, and a B.S. in Elementary Education from the University of Louisville.\n\nMicci Abbott, a Training Specialist based in Nebraska, began her career in education with a decade of P-12 teaching, impacting hundreds of students with her focus on mindfulness and social-emotional learning. Micci later moved to the nonprofit sector where she collaborated on training initiatives related to early childhood education, teacher development, and Mental Health First Aid.\n\nRecognized for her skilled storytelling, Micci has led successful social media campaigns for nonprofits, universities, and small businesses. Her talent was further acknowledged when she won the Eric Sevareid Award for a radio broadcast in which she underwent HIV testing live on air to combat stigma, a feat that showcased her ability to educate, inspire, and uplift across various platforms.\n\nMicci holds a master’s degree in counseling, education, and management. Additionally, her bachelor’s degree in marketing and media adds a unique, creative perspective to her work.\n\nOutside of her professional achievements, Micci has a passion for studying astrology, watching documentaries, and spending quality time with her loved ones.\n\nAs the Director of Family Leadership, Whitney supports a team around NCFL’s family leadership work. Such work includes programs like Activate! Local and Activate! National, and other co-design and coalition-building work aimed at family-based leadership opportunities. Prior to joining NCFL, she worked at United Way of Central Indiana in a variety of 2Gen-type roles and most recently served as 2Gen Partnerships and Engagement Director. In that role, she led a wide array of learning-based opportunities relating to the 2Gen model, served as a support to their grantee pool of 34 community-based organizations, and started a pilot parent advisory council. Prior to United Way, she worked at a national Community Development Finance Institution (CDFI) engaging with the community around health equity and quality of life-related work. Whitney’s passion for authentic community engagement stems from her time in AmeriCorps as a VISTA member and her community organizing background in food justice-based work, as well as asset-based community development models. Additionally, as an offspring of a long line of educators, she is passionate about the upward mobility equal educational access and attainment can provide.\n\nShe holds a Bachelor’s degree in Family and Consumer Sciences from the University of Kentucky and a Master of Public Affairs degree from Indiana University.\n\nWhile she’s been based in the Indianapolis area for 8+ years, Whitney is a Kentucky girl by heart with roots in Eastern and Central Kentucky and plans to relocate back to the Lexington area soon. In her free time, she enjoys spending time with family and friends, staying active, being outside, seeing live music, collecting and listening to records, being creative, and reading.\n\nAllison Miller collaborates with the LENA START and LENA HOME team through Say and Play, a program funded by Bloomberg, by providing professional development and technical assistance to program coordinators.

She brings a diverse understanding of early childhood education to NCFL with over ten years of experience in the field, having served as an Education Manager at Community Action of Southern Indiana Head Start, and a preschool director in Harrison County, Indiana.\n\nAllison holds a Doctorate in Education from Spalding University in Educational Leadership, as well as a Masters in Education with an emphasis in Elementary Education and Teacher Leadership from Indiana Wesleyan University. These degrees have provided her with a foundational understanding of child development as it relates to training and assisting adult learners in the field.\n\nAllison is married to Adam Miller, band director at Jeffersonville High School. Together they have one son, Gabe, and enjoy traveling together, reading, and participating in the rich arts culture of Jeffersonville, Indiana.\n\nBefore returning to NCFL, Tony Peyton served as the Program Director at the C.E. and S.
