        "text": "Jackson Walker Prevails for Wife of Astronaut Alan Bean\n\nA Harris County probate court jury has awarded Leslie Bean and the estate of her husband, NASA astronaut Alan Bean, $1.66 million in damages for counterclaims asserted against Amy Bean, Alan Bean’s daughter from a prior marriage, for her improper conduct as a co-executor of Alan’s estate.\n\nThe jury confirmed that all of the items Leslie Bean claimed were gifted to her during her 36-year marriage to Alan Bean, including certain space items, were Leslie’s property – despite Amy Bean’s challenge to such items. On the other hand, the jurors found other space items should be distributed to trusts established by Alan Bean for the benefit of his two children, including Amy Bean.\n\nThe jury found Amy Bean, in her role as co-executor of Alan’s estate, breached her fiduciary duties to Leslie Bean, including findings that Amy Bean acted with bad faith, malice, gross negligence and committed fraud. For the breaches of fiduciary duty, the jury awarded $600,000 in actual damages and $363,636 in exemplary damages to Leslie Bean.\n\nThe jury also found Amy Bean is wrongfully holding estate assets and awarded the estate $700,000. It also found that Leslie Bean breached some of her fiduciary duties, but the jury was clear that Leslie Bean acted in good faith and therefore awarded zero damages against her. This was a complete defense verdict for the claims asserted against Leslie Bean.\n\n“This is a big win for Leslie Bean as she works to make certain her husband’s life and work be honored and that Amy Bean is held accountable for her improper actions over the last five years,” said Jackson Walker partner Sarah Patel Pacheco, who represented Mrs. Bean at trial with fellow partner Joshua R. Flores.\n\nAlan Bean, the fourth man to walk on the moon, died May 26, 2018. The two-week trial centered around the interpretation of the last will and testament of Alan Bean and the corresponding administration of his estate, including claims of breach of fiduciary duty against both of the co-executors for their roles in the administration of Alan Bean’s estate.\n\nThe case number is 467316-401 in Harris County Probate Court 2.\n\nFor news coverage of the case, see “Litigation Roundup: Kinder Morgan Prevails at SCOTX, LG Chem Does Not” by The Texas Lawbook (subscription may be required).\n\nMeet Our Team\n\nSarah Patel Pacheco focuses on fiduciary litigation; probate, trust, and guardianship administration; and general litigation.
