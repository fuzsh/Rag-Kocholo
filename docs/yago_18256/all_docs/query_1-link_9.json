        "text": "Krysta Dawson, DVM\n\nI am so excited to join the team at Ally Pet Medical Center! I grew up in Issaquah, WA and I have spent my life around animals for as long as I can remember. I started working in the veterinary field in 2012, beginning as a kennel attendant as I was working to become a veterinarian. I worked as a receptionist, kennel attendant, and assistant before graduating in April 2020, becoming a full-time small animal veterinarian. I completed both my Bachelor of Science in Zoology in 2015, and my Doctorate of Veterinary Medicine in 2020, at Washington State University (go Cougs!). I enjoy working closely with pets and their people, and I am passionate about providing comprehensive and attentive companion animal medicine. My primary fields of interest include hospice care, preventive care, and internal medicine.\n\nI grew up horseback riding and I have owned and loved dogs and cats all of my life. I currently have five pets of my own- two Pitbull mixes (Kiwi and Mango), a special needs Shih Tzu (Walter), a Persian cat (Lucy), and a horse (Lismore). In my spare time, I enjoy photography, drawing, exploring outside, and spending time with my pets, family, and friends!\n\nKathleen Gartner, DVM\n\nI'm thrilled to be a part of the team at Ally Pet Medical Center here in the beautiful Pacific Northwest. I've had a passion for caring for animals since my early days working at a small animal clinic in Kansas City as a teenager. After moving to Texas, I dove into the Aggie spirit at Texas A&M University, earning my undergraduate degree and then my veterinary degree from Texas A&M's College of Veterinary Medicine. My love for veterinary medicine has taken me around the world, including wildlife work in South Africa and a stint at a veterinary hospital in Barcelona, Spain. When I'm not at the clinic, I enjoy hitting the trails, trying new recipes, and traveling with my husband, Mario. And of course, going on walks with my rescue pup, Buzz.\n\nI'm eager to bring my varied experiences and special interest in internal medicine, dermatology, and preventative care to Ally Pet Medical Center. I look forward to meeting you and your pets and contributing to their journey to better health and happiness with dedicated, compassionate care.\n\nMaizie, Licensed Veterinary Technician\n\nHi there! I grew up in the beautiful bluegrass state of Kentucky where I rode horses for leisure and even worked as a dairy milker. It wasn't long after receiving my bachelor's in animal sciences from the University of Kentucky that I took off to go explore the northern states. I found myself in Alaska where I was able to jump start my career at a surgery focused clinic. During my time there I was blessed with the cutest brindle boxer, who unfortunately was injured and was in need of a new home. I explored Alaska for just over three years until my boyfriend and I decided to move to Washington state to pursue our long-term aspirations and goals. I am pumped to be a part of the team at Ally Pet and can't wait to meet you and your fur babies.\n\nKelley, Licensed Veterinary Technician\n\nI spent most of my childhood in the suburbs of Chicago, IL and after getting my B.S. at the University of Wisconsin, I moved to Sammamish with my husband and dog in 2012. I worked in the veterinary field for a short time before becoming a rowing coach for seven years. I am so thrilled to be back in veterinary medicine as part of the Ally Pet family. I grew up with horses, dogs, and cats, and I have always loved helping people and their pets. I especially enjoy being part of the local community and creating relationships with our clients. I spend my free time camping, skiing, trail running, and exploring all the beautiful local hiking trails with my daughter and husband.\n\nSamantha, Veterinary Assistant\n\nHi my name is Samantha and I am so excited to be a part of the Ally Pet Medical Team! I grew up on the rural side of Duvall WA, and have always had a passion for caring for small animals. I got my dream job in the veterinary field in 2017, and ever since then I knew that was what I wanted to do with my life. When I'm not working, I am usually outdoors exploring with my dog, Tilly, or relaxing at home.\n\nTamara, Veterinary Assistant\n\nHi my name is Tamara! I grew up mainly in Washington, but have lived in California and Mexico as well. My love for animals started ever since I was a little kid. I grew up with dogs, cats, horses, and more. I began riding when I was 5 and went into barrel racing for 3 years before switching to the NCHA, where eventually I made it to world finals in 2015! In 2018 I began working at a dog daycare and started working in veterinary medicine in January of 2022. I am currently in school to become a LVT since I realized the love I have for helping animals in need and keeping them healthy. I am so excited to be a part of the APMC team and being able to learn and grow here!\n\nCody, Veterinary Assistant\n\nI’ve been working in the animal industry since 2016 and have been in love with it since. I lived most of my life in California before moving to Seattle in January of 2022. Through my life I’ve had a variety of fur babies, scaly critters, and feathered friends. Currently I’ve got an empty nest but we are looking for a new pup to add to the family.\n\nIn my spare time I like to cook, attempt to ski, play video games, and explore new hiking trails.\n\nLeslie, Lead Receptionist\n\nMy name is Leslie. I was born and raised in the beautiful Pacific Northwest. I have worked in the veterinary field since 2008 and am so happy to be part of the Ally Pet Medical Center family! I've had a special connection and lots of love for dogs and cats since I can remember. During my time outside of the clinic I enjoy going on adventures with my dog Sylvie, relaxing with a good book and watching football. Go Seahawks!"
