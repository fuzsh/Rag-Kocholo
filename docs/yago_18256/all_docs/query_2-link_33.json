Leslie immigrated to the United States in 1956 during the Hungarian Revolution.\n\nHe married Irene Pars on November 14, 1959, at St. Stephen’s King of Hungary Church in Chicago and they moved to Racine. He loved playing/coaching soccer, gardening, watching sports, visiting and playing cards with family and friends, and trips with his wife and family. He was proud to see his children graduate from college. Above all, he was devoted to his family. He was happiest when his family was together and enjoyed watching their sporting events or activities.\n\nLeslie is survived by his wife Irene of 64 years; children: Leslie (Amy) Cseter of Escanaba, MI, and their children Matthew (Elisabeth), Thomas (Miranda) and Madelyn (Nathan); Andrew (Holly) Cseter of Menomonie, WI, and their children Jessica (Jordan), Justin and Jace (Madi); Linda (Scott) Borths of Green Bay, WI, and their children Karli, Scott (Ali) and Brandi; great grandchildren, Serena, Scarlett, Claire, Natalie, Ivory, Leighton, Stella, Evan, Charlie and Kennedy.
