        "text": "With heavy hearts, we announce the passing of our beloved Leslie Fay Lemon on June 4th, 2024 at the age of 30.\n\nLeslie was born in Washington state in 1993. She grew up in Lakeside, CA and Kremmling, CO. In 2007 Leslie was diagnosed with Polyarteritis Nodosa (PAN) and secondary Microscopic Polyangitis (MPA), she defied the odds and went into remission after chemotherapy. Leslie was passionate about reaching out to others diagnosed with her disease, sharing information, comfort and support. She had many conditions related to her disease that were difficult to manage and required continued care. Because of this, Leslie was empathetic and wanted to help anyone in pain. If you needed to talk to someone she was there to listen and made it her mission to lift you up.\n\nLeslie attended West Grand High School in Kremmling, CO, and received her GED in 2010. She worked at Sears in Silverthorne, CO eventually becoming one of the youngest store managers. She attended Colorado Mountain College in Glenwood Springs, CO then moved to Grand Junction, CO in 2015 She was an assistant manager for Sears, K-Mart and then Harbor Freight.

Leslie went above and beyond to make her customers feel special by including notes and free items.\n\nLeslie had a vibrant personality! As a child you could always find Leslie if she was hiding from you, she just couldn’t help herself, erupting into a cascade of giggles only to be found. Leslie never met a stranger, within the first 5 seconds of meeting her you would be talking to her like you had known her for years. Leslie had a love for animals, she brought many home which gave her great joy. Leslie also enjoyed dirt biking with Cody, no matter how many times she fell she got up with a smile on her face and would post the video for all to see.\n\nAlong with her medical issues, Leslie struggled with mental illness and depression. She truthfully assured everyone how beautiful, lovely, wonderful and precious they all are because she didn’t want them to feel the way she did.
