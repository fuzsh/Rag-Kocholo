The institute serves as a fulcrum for collaboration across Harvard’s many areas of expertise. Together, we pursue practical, real-world solutions that address all aspects of the climate crisis and engage directly with governments, businesses, NGOs, and communities to collaboratively implement them. Funding Policy – Central to the Institute’s mission is moving our economy away from fossil fuels to one that is based on sustainable clean energy sources. If we can’t accomplish that goal globally, all the other climate challenges we face become worse. The Salata Institute will not accept funds from, or partner with, any company that does not share the goal of moving our global economy away from fossil fuels.\n\nClimate Research Clusters\n\nResearch projects represent interdisciplinary efforts to take on climate problems that are narrow enough to ensure concrete solutions, but broad enough to ensure significant progress in meeting the world’s climate challenge."
