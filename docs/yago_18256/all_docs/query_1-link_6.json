        "text": "It’s another Friday, which means another installment of the March Talent Showcase! It is time for you to meet Leslie, who is the creative woman behind Blythe Happy! So happy to share her and her wonderful embroidered creations with you – what a niche that she entered into in 2013!\n\nHi Leslie! What can you tell us about yourself?\n\nI am happy to be a stay-at-home wife, mother (although my two kids are in college right now), cat-wrangler (we have four cats who don’t always get along…), crafter, seamstress, blogger, Blythe collector and Etsy shop owner! For the past 15 years we have lived in the touristy town of Williamsburg, Virginia, which I love for it’s small size and proximity to bigger cities.\n\nThis is me at Blythe Con 2013 NY with my fave girl Candy. Although the quality of the photo isn’t great, it’s my favorite picture of myself with a doll–you can see how happy Blythe makes me!\n\nHow did you discover Blythe? Who is in your dolly family?\n\nI first started seeing Blythe on the craft website Craftster.org in 2012, and I wondered what these dolls were. My curiosity took me to eBay, where I started spending a lot of time scrolling through the Blythe listings. I was especially captivated by Raspberry Sorbet, with her long, swingy hair, and finally I took the plunge and bought her. I hadn’t had a doll since I stopped playing with Barbies at the age of 12, and I had mixed feelings–what will my family and friends think about me playing with dolls??? So I kept my new interest quiet at first, but slowly, as my collection grew and my confidence grew along with it, I became more open about my dolls. Starting my Etsy store this year was the turning point–it made my doll collection more “legitimate”, because I was actually making money on my hobby. Now I have no problem talking about what I do! I’m sure I would not have gotten into this hobby if it wasn’t for all the things I saw people making for their dolls; I love to sew, knit, embroider and do general crafting, and all these skills come together for me in Blythe.\n\nI have a nice variety of Blythes in my collection now, including several of the face molds and lots of different hair colors. My first two girls were brunettes (Petit Dejeuner was #2), but I’ve come to realize that the fantasy hair colors are my favorite. Right after Christmas I lined up all 20 of my Neos and took this picture of them in their bookcase/dollhouse:\n\nWhat was the first thing that you crafted for Blythe?\n\nThe first patterns I found for Blythe were at Puchi Collective, and the first one I made was the Empire Dress. Here is Bonnie–this is both my first dress and my first picture of Blythe! She didn’t even have shoes (she came with boots but they didn’t go with this dress), and I just plunked her down on my front doorstep to take the picture.\n\nSince then I’ve become a lot more creative with both my sewing, crafting and picture-taking; here’s a recent photo. I made the room box on the right, and the winter-themed stand on the left; I also made the yellow table (from perler beads) and the red and white outfit on Heather (my Prima Dolly Violet). Oh–I just added Precocious Candy Mushroom to my collection–this is her first photo!!\n\nTell us a little bit about Blythe Happy – what made you decide to open up a shop?\n\nAs I’ve already mentioned, one of the main reasons Blythe appealed to me was that I could make lots of “stuff” for her. I quickly became involved in swaps on Blythe Kingdom and Plastic Paradise, and I got so much positive feedback from my swap partners about the items I knitted and sewed, that the thought of opening a shop started to form. I resisted it for a while though, because I didn’t want the hassle of running a business–getting a business license, keeping records for taxes, and filing quarterly returns for Virginia sales tax DO NOT appeal to me! Eventually, though, as I sewed cute dresses and knit fun little hats, I really wanted to share them with more people. I decided the hassle would be worth it, so I opened Blythe Happy on Etsy in the summer of 2012.\n\nHow has opening a business changed the Blythe world for you?\n\nThe biggest change has been all the people I’ve been able to connect with through my shop. Although I am active on the Blythe forums and Flick’r and some Blythe groups on Facebook, I’m not really “chatty”, so it was hard for me to meet people. Now that I have a shop, it’s easy for people to get an idea of who I am by seeing what I make. Many of my customers are also in the on-line groups I belong to, and as a result of their purchases, we’ve connected in the groups. It’s so fun to connect with people!\n\nWhat is the first thing that you sold through your Etsy shop?\n\nThe very first thing that sold was a Happy Cloud Dress, which was purchased by one of my lovely swap partners because it matched a hat I had sent her! See what I mean about connections? Several other former swap partners made purchases from me in the early days of my shop, which really warmed my heart and boosted my confidence–I truly appreciate those first customers, and every single one since then. Here’s a picture of that first dress; I opened Blythe Happy with a dozen dresses I had made as a personal challenge to sew or knit a dress every day for a month.\n\nI soon noticed that a lot of people on Etsy sold outerwear for Blythe, but not many were selling underwear, so I decided to try making some panties. I wanted them to be pretty and practical, so I used white fabric (practical, so there are no worries about staining) and I came up with some simple embroidery designs for the front (pretty, but still practical, because embroidery is flat and won’t cause lumps under clothing like other embellishments–bows, buttons, beads, etc.–would). As soon as I started offering the panties, they sold well, so that’s what I concentrate on now. I try to keep a good variety of designs available all the time, and I’m always coming up with new embroidery patterns to keep the shop fresh. I’ve also started making the panties in Middie size, and they have received a good response from my customers.\n\nDo you end up keeping a lot of what you make, or does most of it end up in the shop?\n\nWhen it comes to the panties, everything I make is for sale–leaving my own dollies with “seconds”! Only a couple of the girls are actually wearing my panties, and those are the prototypes I made that had imperfections. But I do like to see all my dolls dressed nicely, and I like to see them in items I’ve made myself, so I go out of my way to sew and knit outerwear for them. If a dress doesn’t sell in my shop by the time the listing expires, I keep that for myself. Since I only make items that I love, I am very happy to keep anything that doesn’t sell quickly!\n\nWhat has been your best-selling panties design so far?\n\nThe top favorite design is a flower trio (on the Middie panties it’s a single flower) that I do in several different colors. I consider it my “signature” design, because it’s the only one I do completely free-hand (for all the others, I trace the design onto the fabric and embroider over the lines.) The next best-seller is a kitty face; every time I put one in the store it disappears quickly! But all the designs sell well, probably because I am careful to choose themes that are popular in the world of Blythe collectors–anything cute or pretty or kitschy will work–like animal faces, mushroom houses, gnomes, hearts, crowns, unicorns, rainbows–even a cute little T-Rex! But since the surface area for the design is small, the images can’t be too complicated or detailed. I keep a little notebook where I brainstorm ideas for embroidery designs. Later I go back and decide which ones will work, and I refine those sketches into workable drawings.\n\nGenerally speaking, my dolls don’t run around with their underpants showing – how does it make you feel when you do get to see your embroidered pants on other people’s dolls?\n\nThis question brings up the biggest drawback to making panties–they rarely get to be seen in action!! Recently, however, I sent a pair in a swap package, and my partner posted a cute picture of her doll raising her skirt to show off her panties–that really made my day!\n\nPhoto by Heather Roy – used with permission.\n\nI always enjoy the surprise of seeing pretty panties on my dolls when I’m changing their clothes, so for the most part, the panties are a pretty secret to be enjoyed only by the doll owner (and the dolls themselves, of course!)\n\nWhat’s been the biggest lesson you’ve learned about business owning and being the owner of an online shop since you’ve started selling things?\n\nYou have to advertise! After opening Blythe Happy, I quickly realized that I couldn’t expect customers to find me on their own–as with any business, you have to advertise so people will know you exist. I post links to my shop in the Facebook Blythe groups; and both Blythe Kingdom and Plastic Paradise have sections for shop owners to show what they sell. All of these are fantastic opportunities because they directly target the Blythe community, and they are FREE!! So far I haven’t used the option at Etsy to pay to have my listings at the top of the page when customers do searches, but I am keeping that in mind for the future. Another thing I’m considering is making up something small to be packaged with my business cards to donate to Blythe Con 2014 for the goodie bags. I know that when I got home after Blythe Con this year, I made a point of looking up all the businesses that gave freebies; that would be a great way to put my shop name directly into the hands of Blythe collectors.\n\nI think it’s fun that you make cute underpants for the dolls that we all love. Can you tell us about any future plans you may have for Blythe Happy?\n\nAt the moment I am thinking of ways to feature my little embroidery designs so they will be more visible–I might do something like a line of dresses with embroidered pockets, or perhaps shoulder bags with embroidered fronts, for example. I also like to embroider a doll’s name on a white dress–I do this for all my dolls, and I plan to offer it in my Etsy shop soon.\n\nYou can find out more about Leslie and Blythe Happy on Facebook, her blog and over at her Etsy shop!\n\nEmbroidered Panties Giveaway!\n\nLeslie has generously decided to giveaway three pairs of embroidered panties and each panty will have one lucky winner!
