        "text": "Amy Coty is a dedicated and passionate financial and operational leader committed to developing organizational effectiveness through strategic management and informed decision-making.\n\nAmy began her financial career on Refco, Inc.’s global financial futures trading desk in New York and eventually became a Vice President on its Institutional Sales team. Just prior to transitioning to the nonprofit sector, Amy served as Managing Director at Bank of New York Mellon, specializing in derivatives fund management.\n\nAs the Director of Finance and Operations at The Berkeley School, she introduced an Individual Family Tuition model, refinanced debt to improve financial sustainability, and managed health and safety operations to ensure a safe return for students of frontline workers in the summer of 2020.\n\nAmy is a trustee and Treasurer of Springboard HealthLab in Berkeley and a member of the East Bay JCC’s Audit Committee. She was also a trustee and Treasurer of the Green Science Policy Institute in Berkeley and Vice-Chair of the City of El Cerrito Planning Commission.\n\nAmy holds an MBA from North Park University in Chicago and a BA in Music from Brandeis University.\n\nBrandon served as the Assistant Athletic Director and Head Girls Varsity Volleyball Coach for the AIMS College Prep High School. He also served as the Athletic Director for the Hubbard Media Arts Academy, a K-8th grade school. While working on his BA at UC Davis, Brandon was a Sports Producer for Aggie TV, the UC Davis student-run media production studio. After college he worked in the Hollywood film industry for Nickelodeon, Days of our Lives, and various independent productions. Brandon used the 2020 pandemic as a life reset and he moved to the Bay Area to pursue a career in sports coaching. Brandon is a new dad and loving boyfriend. He was born and raised in South Central Los Angeles and is a proud alumni of Crenshaw High School. He is happy to call Julia Morgan School for Girls his new home.\n\nAn experienced teacher of both math and music, Lily Angelica loves to inspire in her students a sense of joyful wonder and discovery, ultimately leading to confidence and skillful application. After many years of teaching in the Bay Area (Canyon Elementary, The School of the Madeleine, and The Renaissance School), she is thrilled to join the faculty at the Julia Morgan School.\n\nBorn and raised in the Pacific Northwest, she obtained a BA in mathematics from Bryn Mawr College, and a Masters in music and music pedagogy from Holy Names University. She has taught K-8 music and various levels of elementary and middle school math (through geometry and algebra II) for over eight years, and has tutored high school and community college classes before that. She also loves sprinkling the regular curriculum with enrichment exercises exposing her students to undergraduate and graduate level topics such as topology, graph theory, and fractal geometry.\n\nLily Angelica is also a musician; a long-time member of the Oakland-based women’s group Kitka, she has also recorded several solo albums (Eastern European love songs and laments, and European lullabies). During the pandemic, she started a YouTube channel of ballads and old-timey children’s songs, and also began singing in a 80’s/90’s pop cover band (SO FUN). She also loves nature and hiking, drawing, studying linguistics, psychology, and physics (to name a few), animals of every kind, and the color indigo."
