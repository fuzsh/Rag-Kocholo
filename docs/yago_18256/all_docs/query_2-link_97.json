I am so excited to share this journey with you. My name is Amy Reynolds and I have been in education for 22 years. I taught middle school for 18 years in Lancaster, South Carolina before serving two years as an Assistant Principal in Greenville, North Carolina.\n\nI am from Newberry, South Carolina. I earned my Bachelorâ€™s Degree in Mathematics with a minor in Education from Newberry College. I also earned my Master of Education in Educational Leadership from Winthrop University. I am married to Sam and we have one son, Cameron (19). In addition, I have a few fur babies named Lilly, Maggie, Abbie, and Jasper who keep me company and provide me with lots of stories to tell. When I am not at school, I enjoy walking, listening to music, and baking goodies for family and friends. Being surrounded by family is one of my favorite things!\n\nI look forward to working with you and your child at Stover! If you need to reach me at any time, please email me amy.reynolds@kcsdschools.net or call me at school."
