Amy and Fintan got married in February at the stunning Castle Leslie Estate in Monaghan, Ireland.

Everything about this wedding day boomed elegance, beauty and class! Amy put so much effort into every little detail of this black tie wedding with a classy black and gold theme.

Her bridesmaids wore bespoke pieces from Emma Murnion Design, and Amyâ€™s stunning dress came in two pieces, where she removed the sparkly tulle skirt for a whole different look during the evening reception.

The marquee was decorated beautifully with floral arrangements from Vintage Violet Florist.

Castle Leslie is definitely up there as one of my favourite wedding venues, Everything about it is luxury, and they have had a few celerity weddings over the years too! The estate boasts a rich heritage dating back to the 17th century and exudes an air of timeless elegance. Surrounded by 1,000 acres of pristine parkland, woodlands, and shimmering lakes, it offers a picturesque backdrop for a dream wedding.
