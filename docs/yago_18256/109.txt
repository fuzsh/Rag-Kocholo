Now this is the wedding we've been waiting for!

Leslie Knope (Amy Poehler) will finally walk down the aisle - sort of - on this week's one-hour episode of Parks and Recreation (Thursday at 8:30/7:30c on NBC)! We say sort of because Leslie and Ben (Adam Scott) have secretly decided to get hitched at the black tie gala where they were able to raise enough money for their park project.
