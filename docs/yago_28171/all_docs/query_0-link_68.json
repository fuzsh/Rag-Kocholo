In 1621, Marie de' Medici, widow of King Henry IV of France, commissioned Rubens to paint a cycle of large-scale paintings for her residence, the Luxembourg Palace in Paris. The cycle, which consists of 24 paintings (now in the Louvre), depicts important moments in Marie's life. In 1702, the French monarchy gave permission for the paintings to be translated into engravings, and the series was published in 1710. In Rubens's allegorical conception, Henry IV is shown a portrait of Marie, his future wife, by Hymenaeus, the god of marriage, with help from winged Amor. Behind Henry, a helmeted personification of France encourages the match, while Jupiter and Juno bestow their approval from above. Though Henry is shown in armor, the caption accompanying the print notes that the two putti at bottom have taken his helmet and shield, removing the instruments of war so that the kingdom may enjoy a long period of peace."
