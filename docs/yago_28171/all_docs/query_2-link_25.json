        "text": "Production\n\nThe inscribed rim is an unusual feature and clearly secondary to the making of the medal itself, as confirmed by the stippling on the fields of both sides of the medal. It is thought that the rim was added sometime in the 17th century.\n\nSummary\n\nThe medal depicts the busts of Henri IV of France and Marie de Medici on the obverse and, on the reverse, Henri and Marie as Mars and Minerva, with the Dauphin as an infant.\n\nThe Roman goddess Minerva (equivalent to the Greek Pallas Athena) was the goddess of wisdom and the arts. One of her frequent attributes is the owl. Mars was the god of war, one of the twelve Olympians. He was widely considered brutal and aggressive and disliked by other gods including his parents, Jupiter and Juno. The one exception was the goddess Venus, who fell in love with him.\n\nIn this context Minerva symbolises Wisdom, the arts and peace, defeating the destructive power of war, symbolised by Mars.\n\nThis medal is signed by Guillaume DuprÃ© and dated 1603.\n\nDuprÃ© (about 1574 - 1640) was a French sculptor, medallist and architect."
