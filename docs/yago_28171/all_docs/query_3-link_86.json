        "text": "Books with Royal Bookplates\n\nMarie de' Medici\n\nMarie de' Medici was Queen of France as the second wife of King Henry IV of France, the mother of Louis XIII and the Duke of Gaston of Orleans. She married Henry IV in 1600. Since 1610, she acted as regent for her son, a minor Louis XIII. In 1617, Louis exiled his mother to the Château de Blois to get rid of her guardianship and political influence. In 1631, a conflict with the first Minister Richelieu, the future Cardinal de Richelieu, was followed by her self-exile. Marie de' Medici fled France and until her death moved through European cities, dying eleven years later in Cologne.\n\nPiccolomini, Alessandro (1508-1578).\n\nPiena, et larga parafrase; di M.

The title page carries the name of the second owner written in the neat hand, — \"Ballesdens\" between two crossed out letters \"s\". He was the Paris lawyer and bibliophile Jean Ballesdane (1595-1675). For a long time, Ballesdane served as an assistant to Chancellor of France Pierre Séguier. In 1648, he was elected to the French Academy, where he make acquaintance with the great dramatist Pierre Corneille. All his life, Ballesdan collected a rich library which, after his death, fell in the hands of J.-B. Colbert and was almost completely sold out. The book came to the National Library of Russia from the collection of the Zaluski brothers (who bought it in the second half of the 18th century), as evidenced by the characteristic notes on the title page.\n\nThe book contains «Full and extensive retelling of the second book of Rhetoric of Aristotle, performed by Alessandro Piccolomini», published in Venice in 1569.
