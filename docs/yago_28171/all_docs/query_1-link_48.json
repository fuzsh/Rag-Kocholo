The Montpensier match will still go to Gaston as he is the one who need lands and a simple noblewoman is not good enough for the King, no matter how rich she is\n\nDo you mean Jeanne? Or would Henriette not be married to Savoy and then Bavaria?\n\nHenriette would likely be matched with Grand Duke Ferdinando II de Medici if there are no other \"kings\" available (although there was a TL where she wound up married to Wladyslaw IV of Poland; and another one where she ended up with Frederik Hendrik of the Netherlands). Jeanne would get whoever's left. Another option for Jeanne might be the Winter Queen's eldest son (James VI was trying to get an Austrian archduchess - Cäcilie Renata - for his grandson, Heinrich Friedrich) but if there's no 30YW analogue or Cäcilie's not available, a French princess might be possible - if doubtful, since Henri IV & James VI would be dead by this point, although the Winter Queen did try to get Prince Rupert married to the duchesse de Rohan while during the Fronde there was talk of an uncle of George I marrying a French princess (one of the Chevreuse girls I think) and Wladyslaw IV marrying Madame de Guise.\n\nGaston marrying inside France seems weird if his brother is too. OTL there was talk of a match between Gaston and Louise Marie Gonzaga (OTL Queen of Poland) that went tits up because of Maria de Medici's personal dislike of the Gonzaga girl's dad who had once passed a remark about the \"newness\" of the Medicis (which given that Henri IV's one mistress used to refer to Maria as his \"fat Florentine banker\" sorta makes sense why she didn't like it). There were also proposed matches between Gaston and Anna de Medici and Anna Konstancja of Poland.\n\nGaston marrying inside France seems weird if his brother is too.

There were also proposed matches between Gaston and Anna de Medici and Anna Konstancja of Poland.\n\nWell a domestic match for the King make no sense so Louis will marry foreign (Nicole of Lorraine is a foreign match and she would bring Lorraine to France as dowry so she make more sense than anyone else if Henry IV can get her)\n\nThe Montpensier match will still go to Gaston as he is the one who need lands and a simple noblewoman is not good enough for the King, no matter how rich she is\n\nSo, Gaston is Duke of Orléans, so I don't think he needs lands. And about Louis marrying her, my thoughts as stated above were:\n\nOTL Gaston really didn't want to marry Madame de Montpensier, and this would be right after Henry IV died, so my thought process was a grieving Louis, after fighting with his brother, was like \"fine, I'll marry her.\" But mostly I just really felt she got the short end of the stick OTL and wanted her to be Queen.\n\nAnd while French monarchs rarely married native noblewoman, other monarchs did from time to time, it's hardly infeasible."
