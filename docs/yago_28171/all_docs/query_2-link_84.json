        "text": "Christym,\n\nsorry I did the research in French, while I thought that I was on the French forum \"Passion Histoire\" (growing a bit older, I haven't the reactions anymore of 50 years ago) but you can easely search for the Wikipedias in English)\n\nIf I am not wrong again:\n\n\"Our\" Isabella was the daughter of Philip II and became archiduchess of the Spanish Netherlands together with Albert. They were part of our history curriculum in Belgium when I was 8 years old...in our Dutch speaking school they were named \"Albrecht en Isabella\"...\n\nPhilippe II d'Espagne - Wikipedia\n\nPhilip III was the son of Philip II, but from the fourth marriage, thus the half-brother of Isabelle...\n\nPhilippe III d'Espagne - Wikipedia\n\nHis son was Philip IV\n\nPhilippe IV d'Espagne - Wikipedia\n\nAnd his daughter was Marie-Thérèse\n\nhttp://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marie-Thérèse_d'Autriche_(1638-1683)\n\nAbout \"our\" Isabella from the Spanish Netherlands:\n\nIsabelle Claire Eugénie d'Autriche - Wikipedia\n\nand if I am right again she was the grand-half-aunt of Marie-Thérèse ...\n\nKind regards and welcome to the boards,\n\nPaul.\n\nLouis XIV?\n\nThere are some far and closer relations among them, it is very difficult to explain:\n\n1. Louis XIII, father of Louis XIV, married Ana de Austria. Ana was daughter of Felipe III of Spain, who was brother of Isabelle Claire Eugenie. Isabelle was aunt of Ana, mother of Louis XIV. This means, Felipe II the great king of Spain, is one of Louis XIV's grand-grandfathers.\n\n2. Henry IV, grandfather of Louis XIV, married Maria de Medici. Maria was daughter of Joanna of Austria, who was daughter of Ferdinand I of Austria. Ferdinand was Charles V's brother, both children of Philip the Handsome and Joanna the Mad.\n\nIsabela the Mad and Philip the Handsome are the grand-grandparents of Isabelle Claire Eugenie.\n\nAnd so, Isabela and Philip are the grand-grand-grand-grandparents of Louis XIV\n\nFrank,\n\nfirst a correction of my previous message: of course it has to be : \"\"your\"Juana la Loca\" instead of \"\"your\" Isabella la Loca\". I was misguided\n\nby your message. First you said correctly :both children of Philip the Handsome and Joanna the Mad. But then you added wrongly:\n\n\"Isabela the Mad and Philip the Handsome\"\n\n\"1. Louis XIII, father of Louis XIV, married Ana de Austria. Ana was daughter of Felipe III of Spain, who was brother of Isabelle Claire Eugenie. Isabelle was aunt of Ana, mother of Louis XIV. This means, Felipe II the great king of Spain, is one of Louis XIV's grand-grandfathers.\"\n\nCompletely right: only that Philip III was the halfbrother! of Isabelle Claire Eugenie.\n\n\"2. Henry IV, grandfather of Louis XIV, married Maria de Medici. Maria was daughter of Joanna of Austria, who was daughter of Ferdinand I of Austria. Ferdinand was Charles V's brother, both children of Philip the Handsome and Joanna the Mad.\"\n\nAlso completely right.\n\nI checked it for you:\n\nJoanna of Austria, Grand Duchess of Tuscany - Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia\n\n\"Her paternal grandparents were [ame=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philip_I_of_Castile\"]Philip I of Castile[/ame] and [ame=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joanna_of_Castile\"]Joanna of Castile[/ame].\" (we call it in Dutch: Filips de Schone en Johanna van Castilië (or Johanna de Waanzinnige)\n\nMarie de' Medici - Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia\n\n\"Marie de' Medici ([ame=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_language\"]French[/ame]: Marie de Médicis; 26 April 1575 – 3 July 1642) was [ame=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Queen_consort_of_France\"]Queen of France[/ame] as the second wife of King [ame=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henry_IV_of_France\"]Henry IV of France[/ame], of the [ame=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/House_of_Bourbon\"]House of Bourbon[/ame]. She herself was a member of the wealthy and powerful [ame=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/House_of_Medici\"]House of Medici[/ame]. Following the assassination of her husband in 1610, which occurred the day after her [ame=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronation\"]coronation[/ame], she acted as [ame=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regent\"]regent[/ame] for her son, King [ame=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Louis_XIII_of_France\"]Louis XIII of France[/ame],\"\n\n[ame=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Louis_XIII_of_France\"]Louis XIII of France - Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia[/ame]\n\nThe couple had the following children:\n\n[ame=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Louis_XIV_of_France\"]Louis XIV of France[/ame]5 Sep 1638 – 1 Sep 1715Married [ame=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maria_Theresa_of_Spain\"]Maria Theresa of Spain[/ame] (1638–83) in 1660. Had issue.\n\nAnd so when you said:\n\n\"And so, Joanna and Philip are the grand-grand-grand-grandparents of Louis XIV \" (I correct Isabela with Joanna, the way you said it correctly in your previous paragraph)\n\nYes and that in two ways:\n\nThe way in your first paragraph that you and I mentioned via Philip III.\n\nAnd secondly the way that you mentioned in your second paragraph via Joanna of Austria.\n\nThe only remark that I already mentioned is that Isabella Claire Eugenie (our Isabella of the Spanish Netherlands) was the grand-half (if this term exists)-aunt of Louis XIV and not the grand-aunt.\n\nKind regards,\n\nPaul."
