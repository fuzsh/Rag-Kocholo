        "text": "Physical description\n\nThis medal depicts a portrait bust of Marie de Medici on the obverse and, on the reverse, Marie de Medici as a goddess with Jupiter, Amphitrite and other gods and goddesses. It is not a particularly good cast (especially looking at the reverse). Superior casts exist in the British Museum and elsewhere.\n\nSummary\n\nThis medal, representing Marie de Medici was made by Guillaume DuprÃ© in about 1625. Marie de Medici (1573-1642), born in Florence, was the daughter of Francesco I de Medici, Grand Duke of Tuscany and Johanna Archduchess of Austria. Later she became Queen consort of France, the second wife of King Henry IV of France. The inscription is 'retrograde' (the letters backwards), perhpas indicating that Marie's titles are merer reflections of her true glory.\n\nThe commemorative portrait medal was especially highly regarded in France during the first half of the 17th century. Guillaume DuprÃ© (about 1579-1640), court medallist to Henry IV, undertook medallic portrait commissions in Italy from 1612. DuprÃ©'s grasp of the Italian tradition, together with his considerable technical skills, enabled him to cast medals in a style that proved influential on succeeding generations of French medallists."
