Maria de' Medici was a prominent figure of the Italian nobility in the 16th and 17th centuries. Born on April 26, 1575, in Florence, Italy, she was the daughter of Francesco I de' Medici and Joanna of Austria. In 1600, she married Henry IV of France and became queen consort. Together, they had several children, including Louis XIII, who became King of France. After the assassination of Henry IV in 1610, Maria became regent of the French throne during her son's minority. Her reign was plagued by conflicts and political rivalries, and she was eventually removed from power in 1617. Despite her downfall, Maria de' Medici left a significant artistic legacy and carried out important architectural projects, such as the construction of the Luxembourg Palace in Paris. She died on July 3, 1642, in Cologne, Germany.
