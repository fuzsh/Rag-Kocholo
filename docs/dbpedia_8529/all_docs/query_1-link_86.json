        "text": "The first book in the famine trilogy\n\nUnder the Hawthorn Tree is Ireland's top selling children's book and a classic for young readers worldwide.\n\nIreland in the 1840s is devastated by famine. When tragedy strikes their family, Eily, Michael and Peggy are left to fend for themselves. Starving and in danger of the dreaded workhouse, they escape. Their one hope is to find the great aunts they have heard about in their mother's stories. With tremendous courage they set out on a journey that will test every reserve of strength, love and loyalty they possess.\n\nAlso available on DVD.\n\nMy favourite book as a child was Under The Hawthorn Tree by Marita Condon-McKenna. At 9 yrs old, I was drawn into the story of three children's struggle to survive during the Irish Famine. Now I'm reading it with my daughter & the journey continues\n\n-- Cecelia Ahern\n\nbeloved the world over\n\n-- The Herald\n\nvividly brings history to life for its readers ... a hugely involving tale\n\n-- Mad About Books\n\nher books never shy away from difficult issues, gripping you from the very opening chapter\n\n-- The Looking Glass\n\nThe Children of the Famine trilogy ... continues to not only educate Irish children about their history, but enable people to truly connect with what happened\n\n-- The Looking Glass\n\nA great survival saga\n\n-- The Irish Independent\n\nmakes a whole part of our history come alive, while it still remains a thrilling adventure tale.\n\n-- RTE Guide\n\nA sublime story ... I don't know any child who will not find this book enthralling.\n\n-- The Irish Times\n\n... beautiful and moving ... historically true and fictionally vivid.\n\n-- The Sunday Times\n\nThe Great Irish Famine of the 1840s has received more fictional treatment than almost any other period in Irish historical children's books. Writing about the Famine posed new challenges to writers for children. The traditional passivity linked to ideas about famine would need to be overcome by some kind of action. The intense and horrible suffering and disease would need to be confronted truthfully but without lurid sensationalism. Some sense of an ending would need to be provided. In Under the Hawthorn Tree, Marita Conlon-McKenna confronted these problems with honesty and simplicity: the plight of three children becomes a kind of pilgrimage. The search for survival is not merely that, but also a search to sustain family loyalty and preserve memory.\n\n-- The Big Guide to Irish Children's Books\n\nBrings the story of the Irish Famine thrillingly alive.\n\n-- The Irish Post\n\nmakes a whole part of our history come alive, while it still remains a thrilling adventure tale.\n\n-- RTE Guide * RTE Guide *\n\nthe powerful story of the survival of three children, alone, and against the odds.\n\n-- Publishing News\n\nMarita Conlon-Mckenna handles this appalling event in Irish history sensitively but never compromising the truth of hardship and human suffering.\n\n-- Jane Murphy - writeaway.org.uk\n\n(A) vivid picture of the Famine era ... fascinating and terrifying\n\n-- Evening Echo\n\nAn Irish classic ... much loved .... the classic famine story by one of our best loved children's authors Sarah Webb\n\n* Newstalk's Pat Kenny Show *\n\nI love giving books as gifts. I have given a lot of young children Marita Conlon-McKenna's Under the Hawthorn Tree. It's a classic and I think one all kids should read\n\n* Sinead Moriarty, Sunday Independent *"
