        "text": "Shaun Du and Zhu Dongyu, young lovers caught up the Cultural Revolution\n\nPure young love is one of the most popular themes in cinema, east and west. But it tends to be simplified – sooner or later, it’s just a question of what will tear the innocent young lovers apart.\n\nIn Under the Hawthorn Tree it’s pretty clear what will tear them apart. Mao, the man with the red book, and his Cultural Revolution. Zhang Jing Qiu is a shy, pretty high school student who is sent to a rural village to be ‘re-educated’ – to learn to work the land and toil physically. She is housed with a village family, and meets a good looking boy called ‘third brother’ by the family. He is a geology student called Sun Jianxin, who also lodges there.\n\nReturning home, she continues to both study and toil, but she finds Sun Jianxin there as well. Their love deepens, much to the displeasure of Jing Qiu’s mother. She is afraid she and her son and daughters will never escape the poverty they were force into when her husband was taken as a political prisoner and she she was denounced as a ‘capitalist’. Now she is forced to do menial work to feed her family. Her only hope is that Jing Qiu will be allowed to continue her education and qualify as a .teacher, Jing Qiu’s love for Sun Jianxin can only prove another obstacle – he too is the son of a dissident who commited suicide.\n\nThey cannot be carefree young lovers, no matter what the temptation. There is too much at stake. But they share moments of joy and laughter, even in a society as earnest and focused as this.\n\nDirector Zhang Yimou having an ET moment\n\nHe promises her that he will wait for ever and she continues to work for one precious goal – a better life for her family. The performances of the two young stars, Shaun Dou and Zhu Dongyu, and the sensitive direction of Zhang Yimou (Raise the Red Lantern, Hero) make this a rare treasure, no sweaty sex scenes, just the keeping of a promise – this a lovely, touching film is an absolute heart stealer. Furthermore it is based on a true story by famous Chinese author Ai Mi, whose friend Jing was the original Jing Qui."
