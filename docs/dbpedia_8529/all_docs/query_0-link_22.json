        "text": "\"Under the Hawthorn Tree\", a romance film directed by Zhang Yimou, was previewed in Shanghai on Tuesday, M1905.com reports.\n\nThe film was able to move the audience to tears without even a single love scene. The innocence of the film recalled the innocence of the 1970s.\n\nUnlike the sharp, contrasting colors Zhang is known for in his previous films like \"Red Sorghum\", \"Hero\" and \"A Simple Noodle Story\"; \"Under the Hawthorn Tree\" uses softer colors and natural light.\n\nStylistic changes work well with the storyline, which is more realistic in comparison with Zhang's other films.\n\nZhou Dongyu plays the lead female character Jing Qiu, who wears an outfit typical of the era for a female in China - a white shirt, blue pants and black cloth shoes. Her simplicity is displayed by her refusal to wear a pair of new rubber shoes she is presented as a gift by her boyfriend.\n\nZhou was reportedly hand-picked from a casting call which attracted more than 5,000 hopefuls from across the country.\n\n\"Her smile is evocative of first love,\" a viewer said after the preview.\n\nWhen Jing Qiu's pregnant friend tells her that after a man \"gets it,\" he will lose interest in a woman, Jing Qiu asks her friend what she means by \"gets it,\" resulting in hearty laughter from the modern audience.\n\nJing Qiu's romantic boyfriend, Lao San, is played by Canadian-raised Dou Xiao.\n\n\"He sets an example for all Chinese men who are searching for a girlfriend,\" a female viewer said.\n\n\"Under the Hawthorn Tree\" are both Zhou and Dou's first big-screen appearances.\n\n\"Under the Hawthorn Tree\" is scheduled for release in China on September 16."
