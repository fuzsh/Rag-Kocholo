        "text": "Not much of a movie buff, I typically steer clear of the silver screen. Unless there’s an irresistible buzz or a gun-to-the-head scenario. So some time ago I decided that I will try and venture on this path of becoming a cinephile. I mean, after all, isn’t cinema just another form of art? And who wouldn’t want to appreciate all the beauty and emotion that art has to offer while their time here on earth. Drawing inspiration from Robin William’s famous quote — “Medicine, law, business, engineering, these are noble professions and necessary to sustain life. But poetry , beauty, romance, love — these are what we stay alive for” I set my objective.\n\nSo the objective is to be alive and not just live and hence cinema :)\n\nWith that in mind, I stumbled upon a recommendation for a movie titled “Under the Hawthorn Tree”. It’s a Chinese film from 2010 that I found on YouTube, complete with English subtitles.Now, I have this rule of a strict 10-minute tolerance for video content — if it doesn’t grab me, it’s a hard pass. But with a cast so charming, resistance was futile.\n\nSince I do not want to spoil the movie for anyone reading (the probability of which is meager). The movie was quite heart warming, it’s innocence is what makes you stay. The movie is actually adapted from a novel of same name by author Ai Mi.\n\nAnd as I watched, I couldn’t help but wonder about the symbolism behind the hawthorn trees featured in the film. Turns out, in Celtic culture, they represent love and protection — a beautiful touch that added even more depth to the story (even though in chinese culture there is no such symbolism linked to these trees).\n\nAs the credits rolled and the Hawthorn tree vanished beneath the water, I couldn’t help but reflect that while physical things may come and go, love and belief endure. It’s a timeless theme that resonates deeply, especially considering that the story was inspired by real events from the 1970s.\n\nI guess my journey of appreciating cinema started on a good note. Hope I get to explore more. Drop in some recommendations if by chance you stumble upon this article."
