        "text": "This study's objective is to thoroughly analyze representations of teenage sexuality portrayed in two Chinese youths' films, which represent social, cultural, and historical diversities in Mainland China, as well, to unfold some particular natures and trends of Chinese youth cinema in the context of globalization and internationalization. Content analysis and methodology of narrative explore the ideological nature of representations of youth as well as the interpretation of trends in Chinese youth cinema. This study argues the particular manners of representations of Chinese youth in the youths' films produced in Mainland China, through distinct elements such as film properties, film discourse, and acting on set. It will explain how functional and social category diversity, cultural diversity, and historical diversity derive the actuality in Chinese communities, and center on a series of sex‐based issues that revel correlations between Chinese youths' ideology, psychology, and social construction. Including a discussion of technical factors, it defines the specific natures of Chinese youth cinema in the region based on fixed parameters of culture or ancestry that convey rhetorical messages to discover the characteristics of genre film so that the interpretation of the term \" peers groups \" represents the values and beliefs in modern Chinese society, thus presenting the exchange approaches which construct and validate the relationship among society, global film industry, young audience and film content.\n\nThis innovative collection of essays on twenty-first century Chinese cinema and moving image culture features contributions from an international community of scholars, critics, and practitioners. Taken together, their perspectives make a compelling case that the past decade has witnessed a radical transformation of conventional notions of cinema. Following China's accession to the WTO in 2001, personal and collective experiences of changing social conditions have added new dimensions to the increasingly diverse Sinophone media landscape, and provided a novel complement to the existing edifice of blockbusters, documentaries, and auteur culture. The numerous 'iGeneration' productions and practices examined in this volume include 3D and IMAX films, experimental documentaries, animation, visual aides-mémoires, and works of pirated pastiche. Together, they bear witness to the emergence of a new Chinese cinema characterized by digital and, trans-media representational strategies, the blurring of private/public distinctions, and dynamic reinterpretations of the very notion of 'cinema' itself. - See more at: http://www.bloomsbury.com/us/chinas-igeneration-9781623568474/#sthash.Cqyr9OEh.dpuf\n\nThis study's objective is to thoroughly analyze representations of sexuality embodied in two Chinese youths' films, which represent social, cultural and historical diversities in Mainland China, as well, to unfold some particular natures and trends of Chinese youth cinema in the context of globalization and internationalization.

Romantic scenes, typically portraying men and women already in committed relationships, appeared in 80% of the 196 programs analyzed. The analysis suggested that, according to Chinese television in the early part of the twenty-first century, emotional love was more important than physical sexual interaction in romantic relationships. More than half of the 1112 romantic scenes analyzed depicted love between the partners without any discussion or display of physical sexual behavior. Only 8% of scenes included discussion or depiction of sexual behavior (e.g., touching, kissing, and intercourse) without some sense that the partners were in a loving, committed relationship. Sexual intercourse was implied or depicted in fewer than 2% of the romantic scenes. Findings are discussed in light of the Chinese government's periodic regulation of sexually suggestive media content and attempts to filter Internet content. The extent to which such content may affect young viewers' perceptions of romantic relationships and sexual behavior is also discussed.\n\nCitation Issued Date 2012 URL http://hdl.handle.net/10722/180066 Rights The author retains all proprietary rights, (such as patent rights) and the right to use in future works. Abstract: This dissertation scrutinizes a corpus of films considered to be the stylistic and thematic descendants of Yasujiro Ozu, which I call \" feeling of life films. \" Focusing upon common themes such as female narrative and the portrayals of the quotidian, this dissertation identifies various methods used in specific films of Ozu, Hou Hsiao Hsien, and Tran Anh Hung that complicate narrative meaning and engage in the discourse of national modernity and history. The female protagonists of these films can be considered \" left behind \" by the narrative progression of history, serving an allegorical function that critiques standard notions of time and official history. The basis for understanding this phenomenon will be scholarly discourse primarily concerning Ozu's \" Noriko Trilogy, \" which marks the transitional period of postwar Japan through the narrative of a woman's path to marriage. This dissertation seeks to complicate the discourse of reading women in these films by introducing different methodologies of formalist analysis, cultural analysis, theoretic discourse, historiography, and phenomenology. In doing so, this dissertation demonstrates the cinematic importance of these films through their unique formal characteristics and their cultural and historical meanings. Abstract of dissertation entitled Left Behind by History: Complicating Narrative, Modernity in the Mundane, and Reading History through Women in \" Feeling of Life Films. \""
