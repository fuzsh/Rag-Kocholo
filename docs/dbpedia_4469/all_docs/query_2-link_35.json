        "text": "The museum was born when Barthold Suermondt donated 105 of his own private paintings to the city. Later, Irene and Peter Ludwig donated a significant part of their collection to the museum too. The building in which the museum resides was inspired by Venetian palaces. Highlights of the collection include:\n\nGerman sculptures from the 12th to the 16th century.\n\nA large collection of glass paintings.\n\n10000 works of graphic art.\n\nFlemish tapestries.\n\nMasterworks by Rembrandt, Frans Hals, Govert Flinck, Anthony van Dyck and Frans Snijders.\n\nThe museum is surprising underrated, probably because it barely makes enough in ticket collections to maintain its exhibits. As such, there is not much advertisement, but there really should be. The collection is surprisingly epic!\n\nEntrance Ticket Details For Suermondt-ludwig-museum\n\nAsk to see if you qualify for a reduced ticket price of EUR 3. Bring ID.
