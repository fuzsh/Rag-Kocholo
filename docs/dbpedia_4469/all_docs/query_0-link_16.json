        "text": "Entry\n\nOn a platform under an arch, Jacob is seated next to his youngest son, Benjamin, who is standing with a cup in one hand and a cap in the other. Flanking this central group are eight of Jacob’s other eleven sons standing or seated. One of them, the seated figure of Judah at right centre, speaks to his father while the others listen attentively.\n\nThe scene represented here could be one of two episodes in the story of Jacob and his sons. It might be the moment when nine of the sons ask their father’s permission to take Benjamin along with them to Egypt, in order to secure the release of their brother Simeon, taken hostage by Joseph, the supposedly dead eleventh son who had earlier been sold into slavery by his jealous brothers (Genesis 43:8-9). Such an interpretation is supported by the fact that in the drawing Benjamin stands close to his father, as he does in two sixteenth-century biblical illustrations of the sons’ request to take Benjamin along, which appear in Guillaume Guéroult’s Figures de la Bible. In these woodcuts, Benjamin stands next to his father, who, in one of the illustrations, puts his arm around him in a protective gesture and whose worried look indicates his unwillingness to let his son travel to Egypt. Benjamin also seems anxious about the decision. So, too, are the brothers, but for a different reason, for they are concerned for the well-being of Simeon, who will continue to be held hostage, unless Judah is able to persuade their father to let Benjamin accompany them.\n\nAlternatively, the drawing may represent the scene when eleven brothers, including Benjamin and Simeon, have returned to Canaan from Egypt and are telling their father that Joseph is still alive and has been made viceroy of Egypt, which Jacob cannot at first believe (Genesis 45:26). The second interpretation is implied by the cup in Benjamin’s hand, which Joseph (when still unrecognized by his brothers) had planted in Benjamin’s bag before their departure to test whether his brothers were reformed characters: Joseph threatened to enslave Benjamin as punishment for the theft, until Judah begged him to enslave him instead since the loss of Benjamin would break their father’s heart – a selfless gesture that caused Joseph to recant and to reveal his identity. Yet Benjamin did not take the silver cup back home to Canaan, so, in the drawing, the motif could simply be an attribute to identify him. In that case, the first interpretation – the sons’ request for permission to take Benjamin along with them to Egypt – is just as plausible, for the cup itself was not actually present in either episode; Benjamin’s cup and travelling cap might therefore be merely symbolic, alluding to future events.\n\nRembrandt represented the same subject in a drawing in the Louvre in Paris (inv. no. RF 4703). In this version, probably made after the Amsterdam drawing, Benjamin does not have a cap and holds the cup with both hands. He looks at his father rather than his brothers, making it clear that he is focussed on Jacob’s decision. One of the sketchily rendered brothers on the right seems to be pointing, a gesture that also occurs in the abovementioned Bible illustrations. The subject of both drawings is thus most likely to be Jacob’s sons asking permission to take Benjamin with them to Egypt. When Canaan was again struck by famine, Jacob finally relented and allowed Benjamin to go with his brothers to secure more grain for the starving Israelites.\n\nThe drawing in the Louvre represents the scene from a different angle, and the steps leading to Jacob’s chair are more clearly delineated. Jacob and Benjamin command the most attention since they have been more fully worked up, while the figures to the left and right are sketched only lightly. The next most prominent figure is Judah, who is likewise speaking. In the Amsterdam sheet, on the contrary, all the figures receive equal emphasis. Powerfully drawn figures with their backs turned to the viewer enclose the composition symmetrically. The brother seated on the platform at the left was drawn a second time on a paper correction, showing that Rembrandt probably had some difficulty with this passage. The eight sons flanking Jacob and Benjamin in the Amsterdam drawing form a less unified group than the correct number of nine sons (and one daughter) in the Louvre drawing.\n\nBoth drawings, with their masterful characterization of the figures, show how Rembrandt was constantly exploring different ways to represent the same theme. These types of drawings were probably also used as models for his pupils. Based on stylistic similarities with Two Men in Discussion, a signed and dated drawing of 1641 in The Courtauld Gallery in London (inv. no. D.1978.PG.190), the present drawing can be dated to around 1641."
