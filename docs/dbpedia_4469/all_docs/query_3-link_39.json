Among the sources of information which have reference to the history of the^-arti ^he-^opifrions of eminent critics on the merits of particular masters, and of remarkable works, have not been overlooked. A certain degree of historical knowledge, as regards both the art itself and its criticism, is perhaps indispensable for the due appreciadon of some works ; the merit of which, depending on the time and circumstances of their produc- tion, is in a great measure relative. The information thus offered, without^ superseding individual predilections, may sometimes assist in the formation of a correct judgment, which is the basis of a correct taste. 80319. ^ 2 NOTICE. The present catalogue is thus designed^ not merely as a book of reference for visitors in the Gallery^ but also as guide to the history of painting, as represented by the examples in the collection: it may be used likewise, so far as it extends, as a Biographical Dictionary of Painters. The first edition, printed in ISIG, was published in the beginning of 1847. To the thirty-seventh edition were first added the painters' monograms and signatures, engraved in wood, firom copies in fac-simile made by me in October 1862. I have omitted some few, which are too obscure for reliable reproduction ; most of them are of the size of the originals^ the very large only have been reduced. The Gallery is open to the public on Mondays, Tuesdays^ Wednesdays, and Saturdays ; and on Thursdays and Fridays to students' only.

The establishment of a National Gallery had long been desired, and His Majesty George IV. is said to have been the first * to suggest the propriety of purchasing the Angerstein collection. Sir George Beaumont, also, and the late Lord Dover, then the Hon. George Agar Ellis, took an active part towards the accomplishment of this object. Lord Dover first brought the subject before Par- liajnent in 1823 ;f and Sir George Beaumont was so desirous to see a National Gallery established, that he oflTered to give his own pictures to the nation as soon aa the Government should allot a proper place for their recq)tion. The Angerstein collection, consisting of thirty-eight pictures, J was accordingly secured to the nation, and a grant of Parliament of 60,000Z., proposed by Government, was voted April 2, 1824, to defi^ay the charge of purchase and the expense incidental to the preservation and public exhibition of the collection for that year — 57,000Z. for the pictures, and 3,0002. for the incidental expenses.§ * Hansard, ParUamentary DehaUa, speecli of Sir C.

Appendix. 6 TUE NATIONAL GALLERY. A National Gallery was thus established. It wa.s opened to the public, in the house of Mr. Angerstein, in Pall Mali, May 10, 1824. In 1826 the collection was increased by the munificent donation to the Trustees of the British Museum for the National Gallery, of sixteen pictures from Sir George Beaimiont, as well as by further purdiases on the part of the Government. In 1831 it was enriched by the valuable collection (consisting of thirty-five pictures) which was bequeathed to the Trustees of the British Museum, to be placed in the same building with the Angerstein pictures, by the Eev. William Hoi well Carr;* and from that time to thia, works have been constantly added to it, by donation, by bequest, and by Government purchase. The principal donations and bequests, besides those ah'eady mentioned, are : six pictures presented in 1886 by William IV. ; fifteen bequeathed, in 1838, by Lord Famborough; eleven bequeathed, in 1846, by Richard jSitnmons, Esq. ; eight bequeathed, in 1854, by Lord Col- borne; twenty bequeatjied, in 1859, by Jacob Bell, Esq. > twenty-two presented, in 1863, by Her Majesty the Queen • and six presented at difierent times by the Governors of the British Institution. The \"Corn Field,'' by John Constable, R A., \" Serena rescued by Sir Calepine,'' by William Hilton, RA., and \" Jerusalem,'' by Thomas Seddon, were purchased, by subscription, by the respective friends of the painters, from their executors, and presented by them to the National Gallery. . Of the 634 pictures which now constitute the national collection, exclusive of the Vernon and Turner collections, 269 have been presented of bequeathed,! the remaining 366 have been purchased by Government, by grants of Parlia- ment :J the number of pictures in the National QaUery, includinor all the works of the British School, is now 896. 8 • The FamboTongh bequest iras also made t& the- Trustees of the British Museum for the National Gallery. f Complete lists of the pictures purchased, as well as of donations and bequests, are given at the end of the Catalogue. The pictures of the British School are separately catalogued, and are, tiie greater part, exhibited at South Era^gtoiK t The total amount expended in the purchase of pictures, from the founda- tion of the gtfllery in 1824 to the close of the year 1671, is 387,196/. 9»/10d . § Of these, 38 are for the present removed from I3ie wsdls owing to want of space. It may not be uninteresting to the reader to compare the number of pictures in the National Gallery, with the number, according to the pub- lished catalogues, in the several principal national collections in Europe In Bome, in the gallery of the Vatican, there are only 87 pictures ; in that of Ihe THE NATIONAL GALLEBY. 7 The building in which the Collection — Foreign Schools — is at present deposited was erected at the national expense, expressly for the purpose, after a design by William Wilkins, RA., architect. It was cotrffififlhrfei in 1832, and was opened to the public April 9, 1838. It was considerably altered andf enlarged l^ Mr. Pennethoriie in IS 60, sind in 1869 five oth^ romns were added \"by 'the • surrender to the Trustee»^?ofi those hitherto appsDpriaited by-tiia.

MMWtfMMIMWVMVMVMMMVMWIIMMIMMMffMI The word \" schoor' has various significations with writers on art: in its general and widest sense it denotes all the painters of a given CQipitry, without special reference to time or sub-divisions of style ; as^ the Italian School, In a more restricted sense,it refers to the characteristic style which may distinguish the- painters of a particular locality or period; as, the Bolognese School In its most limited sense, it signifies the distinctive style' of a particular master; as the School of Raphael : whence it is also applied to the scholars or imitators of an individi^, who ^e said ioh^ of the school cf'such'mastef.- •' '^ /- :--• ', / -!., .-.vol-') ;\";'* .

With regard to t)ie chronology there observed; it^ ji^usl !)e apparent that- it is impossible to £x with precisioxL the com- mencement of any school There are isolated &cts bf very remote dates, connected with the history of painting in many countries ; but such facts cannot be assumed to in- dicate the existence of a class of painters having a more or less common and definite style. It i^ only when such a class exists that a school can be said to be established ; and when there is evidence of the practice of painting in a more limited degree, yet tending to such development, the school may be said to have commenced. ^/WS/^«/WVY^V^«AMn^M^A^M/W^/W\\A/W«A/Vk/WVK/vni 14 THE NATIONlL OALLEBT. of Pamti/ng, as rep e Ifational OaUery.

Mabiotto Albbrtinelli, a pupil of Cosimo Rosselli, became the intimate friend and assistant of Fra Bartolom- meo ; he was bom at Florence 14th October 1474. When Fra Bartolommeo, under the influence of Savonarola, gave up painting and took to a monastic life, AlbertineUi com- pleted some of his unfinished pictures^ and acquired much of the style of II Frate, especially his taste for tone or chiaroscuro. AlbertineUi was of an impatient character, and being offended with the criticisms which were passed on his works, for a time gave up painting, says Vasari, and turned publican. He died at Florence 5th Nov. 1515, having shortened his life by dissipation.* No. 64s5. The Virgin and Child, seated ; entire small figures. On wood, 6 in. h, by 4 in. w. Purchased from M. Edmond Beaucousin at Paris, in 1860. ALLORI. Cristofobo Allori, the son of Alessandro, was bom at Florence in 1677, and was sometimes called Bronzino, after his giseat uncle. He left his father to study under Gregorio Fagani, one of the reformers of the Florentine school, and a good colourist. Cristoforo had a dislike to the anatomical school of Michelangelo, to which his father be- longed. He was fastidious in his execution^ and exceed- ingly elaborate ; his style was well suited to portraits, in which he was excellent ; he was also a skilful landscape painter, and he is said to have made some copies, with slight alterations in the back-grounds, of Correggio's Mag- dalen, which have passed as duplicates by Correggio. His pictures are not numerous ; among his masterpieces is the ♦ Va«ari, Vite de* Pittori, jv, Ed. Le Monnier. i J ALUNNO. 23 ''Judith with the Head of Holophemes/' in the Pitti Palace, in which the Judith is said to have been painted from his own mistress, and the head of Holophemes from himself; the picture was in the Louvre in 1814, and was engraved by Qandolfi for the \" Musfe Napoleon.\" Cristoforo died at Florence in 1621 * No. 21.

From the collection of the Duke of San Vitale, at Parma, whence it was procured by the Rev. W. H. Carr, who bequeathed it, in 1831, to the National Gallery. ALUNNO. NiccOLO Alunno (Nicolaus Alumnus) of Foligno, painted from 1458 to 1499. There are several pictures bearing the signature \" Nicolai Fulguiatis opus,\" but as there was apparently another Niccolo of Foligno called Deliberatofe living at the same time, it is not always possible to dis- tinguish their works with certainty. Niccolo was one of the principal Umbrian painters of his time ; the pictures attributed to him are in tempera, (he did not paint in oil,) and are bright and pure in colour : he painted directly from nature, then an untisual practice, and the few works that remain have great merit for their period. There are still some remnants of the PietS. in the Cathedral of Assisi, in which were the weeping angels ^dmired by Vasari in the life of Pinturicchio. One of his best remaining pictures is a Madonna and child with a choir of angels, in the gaUery of the Brera at Milan, and engraved in Rosini^s History of Italian Painting with the date 1465 : another is still in San Niccolo di Foligno, the predella of which is in the Louvre at Paris. Rumohr attributes all pictures signed \" Nicolai Fulginatis opus,\"' or similar signature^ to Alunno ; who is ftirther, by Mariotti, assumed to have been the master of Pietro Perugino. * BaldinQCci, Notizie de' Professori del Disegno, Sfc; Laazi, Storia Pit- torica, jrr. ; Fiorillo, Geschichte der Makrei in Toscana, yoL I. 24 ANGELICO.

Era Giovanni da Eiesole, commonly called fix>m his great piety, L'Angelico, and II Beato Angelico,} was born near the Castello di Vicchio, in the Mugello, in 1387; his family name was Guido. He joined the Order of the Predicants at Eiesole in 1407, and began his career in '' art, as an iUuminator of manuscripts. Era Giovanni left Eiesole in 1409, in the pontificate of Alexander V., and practised as a &esco painter for several years at Eoligno, and at Cortona, where several of his best pictures are still preserved. In 1418 he returned to Eiesole, where he resided until 1436, when he was invited to Elorence to decorate the new Convent of St. Mark, then assigned to the Predicants as their abode. Eor this convent Era Giovanni executed his most important works, which occu- pied him about nine years. His brother, Era Benedetto, is said to have assisted him in some portions. In 1445 he was invited to Rome by Pope Eugenio IV., who employed him in the Vatican, where he also painted a chapel for that pope's successor, Nicolas V. While engaged for Nicolas V., he was invited to Orvieto to paint the • Mariotti, Lettere Pittoriche Perugine, &c. 8vo, Ferugia, 1 788.

He did not return to Orvieto after the autumn of that yeai'. The chapel was completed many years after- wards by Luca Signorelli. Fra Giovanni returned to Rome in September 1447, and remained there until his death in 1455. He was buried in the Church of Santa Maria Sopra MineiTa ; and the follow- ing inscription was placed on liis tomb. Hrc JACET Ven. Pictor Fr. Io. de Flor. Ord. P. MCCCCLV.* Fra Giovanni Angelico, says Vasari, was a man of such fervent piety, that he never commenced painting without prayer. He is still well represented in the Convent of St. Mark, at Florence, and the Florentine academy possesses a fine collection of his smaller works. Engravings also from liis paintings are numerous.

His father was a government secretary at Emden, and Ludolf acted as his clerk until 1650, when he was placed with a merchant at Amsterdam, to learn commercial busi- ness. While thus engaged, Bakliuizen commenced making drawings of ships from nature, for which he soon found willing purchasers. He eventually studied painting under Albert van Everdingen, and he received also some instruc- tion in the style which he had chosen from the marine- painter Hendrik Dubbels. Bakhuizen^s favourite subjects were wrecks and stormy seas, which he frequently sketched from nature in an open boat, at the great peril of himself and the boatmen. He engraved a few pieces : there are some etchings of the Y,J and other marine views, executed by him when old. He made also many constructive drawings of ships for the Czar Peter the Great, who took lessons of the painter, and frequently ' visited his painting-room. Among his other avocations, Bakhuizen also gave lessons in writing, in which he had introduced a new and approved method. He died at Amsterdam, in 1709. Ludolf Bakhidzen, called the younger, a battle-painter, was the nephew of the subject of this notice.§ * Vasari, Ed.

Barocd, a sculptor, originally of a Milanese family, gave him his first instruction in design ; he was afterwards placed with the distinguished painter Battista Franco, who spent some time at XJrbino in the service of the Duke Guidubaldo II. After the departure of Franco, Barocd also left Urbino, and accompanied his uncle Bartolomeo Genga, the duke's architect, who taught him perspective, to Pesaro, then under the dominion of the Dukes of Urbino ; his uncle procured Idm permiasion to copy some pictures by Titian in the ducal gallery there. In 1548, in his twentieth year, Barocci visited Borne, and remained there a few years, devoting his time chiefly to the study of the works of Raphael. After his return to Urbino, he painted several pictures which gained him great reputation. In 1560, he returned to Rome, and was employed in the following year by Pius IV., with Federigo Zuccaro, in the Vatican. While engaged in tliis work he was nearly poisoned, by some rival, as supposed. Though the attempt failed, it wholly incapacitated Barocci for painting for four years, and afficted him for the remainder of his life, fifty- two years, with a disease of the stomach which rendered it impossible for him to work for more than two hours in the day. From the period of this misfortune, with the exception of three years passed at Perugia, and during which he paid a short visit to Florence, Barocci spent the remainder of his long life at Urbino, where he died of apoplexy on the last day of September, 1612, aged 84 : he was buried there in the church of San Francesco, with all the ceremony due to his great merits and reputation. Barocci painted almost exclusively religious subjects; he executed several large and excellent altar-pieces, some of which he etched himself — as the Pardon of San Fi-ancesco d'Assisi, at Urbino, in 1581; and The Annunciation, at Loreto, a few years later ; two of his masterpieces. Barocci is generally said to have founded his style upon the works of Raphael and Correggio : his works have con- siderable resemblance to those of Correggio in delicacy of light and shade. In colouring he was peculiar ; Mengs * has observed, that his works are deficient in yellow tints. * Mengs, Hinterlassne Werke, vol. L p. 252. BASATTI. 29 o» Bellori has also pointed out the defects of his colouring remarking that he used too much vermilion and too much ultra-marine.* Reynolds observes that he \" falls under the criticism that was made on an ancient painter, Hhat his figures looked as if they fed upon roses/ \"f His style had considerable influence upon the painters of his time, both at Rome and Florence. Of all his followers, the most distinguished was Lodovico Cardi, commonly called Cigoli, whoj partly through the example of Barocci's works, became a reformer of the then degenerate Florentine school. • No. Z9m A \" Holy Family,'' known as \" La Madonna del Gatto,\" from the circumstance of a cat being introduced into the picture. Though the subject is ostensibly holy, it is here treated merely as an ordinary domestic scene. The little St. John, leaning with his left arm upon the lap of the Virgin, is playfully teasing a cat, by holding up a little bird beyond its reach. Tlie Madonna is pointing with her right hand to the cat, as if to direct the attention of her infant son, who has just turned from the breast, to the incident. Behind is Joseph, who, with his left hand resting upon a table, is leaning forward, and appears to be equally engrossed by the trivial circumstance. Engraved by C. Cort, in 1577 ; and by A. Garden, and others. On canvas, 3 ft. 9 in. ^. bj 3 fit. w. A '^ Madonna del Gatto ^ is noticed by Bellori, and he appears to allude to this picture, though he calls the little bird a swallow, and mentions that it is tied with a piece of string, which is not evident at present, and the bird is a goldfinch. Bellori terms the composition a scherzo (a playful piece), and adds that it was painted for the Count Antonio Brancaleoni. The picture above described was long in the Cesarei Palace at Perugia, whence it was procured by Mr. Irvine for Mr. Buchanan in 1805, of whom it was purchased by the Rev. W. H. Carr, who bequeathed it, in 1831, to the National Gallery. There are several old copies of it.

He died at Bassano, Feb. 13, 1592.* The works of Bassano are conspicuous for Venetian ex- cellence of colour, and for masterly chiaroscuro ; and some of his best pictures are not unworthy of Titian. In a few years, however, he forsook what may be termed the grand style, for one more in unison with untutored apprehensions, and characterised by the introduction of all sorts of familiar objects, whatever may be the subject of the pictura He was perhaps the earliest Italian genres-pointer. Even when he painted religious subjects firom the Old or New Testament, which he frequently did, he treated them as familiar scenes of his own time. He excelled in land- scape and animals, particularly the latter, in which he took great delight, introducing them on all occasions when ad- missible with, or even without, propriety. His works are very numerous in the Venetian State, and they are not uncommon in picture-galleries generally: his masterpieces are •considei'ed the Nativity, at San Giuseppe, and the ■ i<pi»i».lli....i.il li I- iiiipy.. 111. ■ I .

As it is a term of frequent occurrence in works which treat of painting, an explanatfon of i^ may not be out of place here. Strictly speaking a peintre de genre, or jfenr«-painter, signifies a pamter of any particular class of subject t and, accordmg to some explanations, any piunter except an his- torical painte^— but this is a meaning too Tagoe for any critical purpose. Com- mon usage has now limited the signification of the term genre-painting to a less elevated class of painting. The full expression is apparently peintre du genre bos, painter of a low clau of subjects, which occasionally occurs (Millin, Die' tionnaire des Beaiue-Arts, vol. iiL p. 160). It does not however follow that a genre-pieture is low in its subject ; yet, it must be a picture of some fioniliar object, or ordinary custom or incident ; and every such picture which does not .belong to any other recognised class of paintings^ as history, portrait, animal, luidscape, marine, fruit and flower, or stUl-life, but which may nevertheless be somethmg of all, is a genre^piciure. The Dutch have hitherto been the great ^enre*painters $ indeed, their pictorial fame is so closely associated with this class of painting, that genre and tAe Dutch style are nearly efynonymous. 32 BELLINI, G.

Giovanni Bkt.tjni, the most distinguished of the quAMr(h centistij or painters of the fifteenth century, at yenice, was bom in that city in 1427. He was the son and pupil of Jacopo, and the younger brother of Gentile, Bellini, both distinguished painters in their time, but inferior to Giovanni Bidolfi observes, that the style of Giovanni was an aggregate of all that was beautiful in painting in his time ; and Lanzi remarks, that had his outline been less hard, he would have been a just representative of even the modem or dnquecento BELLINI^ CL 33 style — ^that of the great masters of the sixteenth century. His style is individnaly and rather full than meagre in forn\\ ; it is positive in colour^ and is distinguished for much detail of costume and ornament. His works^ which are stiU very numerous, though probably many have perished, range in their dates from 1464 to 1516. The celebrated pictures described by Vasari, which he painted with his brother Gentile and with Luigi Yivarini, in the Sala del Gran Con- siglio, in the ducal palace of Venice, ^ere destroyed by fire in 1577. They were, however, replaced by others painted by the great Venetian masters of the sixteenth century. Giovanni Bellini's earlier works were executed in tem- pera; but upon seeing some of the oil pictures of Antonello da Messina, who settled in Venice about 1470, he perceived the great advantage of the new method, and, according to a story told by Ridolfi, he disguised himself as a Vene- tian* cavalier^, sat to Antonello for his portrait, and by watching the pauxter'sf proceedings during the sittings, con- trived to drover his secret.* Bellini's best works are in oil, and consist chiefly of Madonnas and portraits. The last pictture painted by Joannes Bellinua, as he wrote his name, is the Madonna of Santa Giustina at Padua, mentioned by Brandolese and others, which bears the date 1516. Eidolfi erroneously states that his last picture was the Bacchanalian piece, painted in 1514 for Alfonso I. of Ferrara, long pre- served subsequently in the Aldobrandini Villa at Rome, and now in the collection of the Duke of Northumberland. Giovanni died without finishing it, and it was completed by Titian, who painted the landscape back-ground to it. Giovanni Bellini died at the advanced age of 90, November *■ It must haye been after 1473 that Gioyanni practised the new method ; ibr according to Zanetti, the first oil picture known to haye been executed in Venice by a Venetian master was painted in that year, by Bartolommeo Viyarini, for the church of SS. Gioyanni e Paolo. It does not appear that Antonello executed many pictures in Venice during his first yisit there on his return from Flanders, about 1445 ; and Domenico Veneziano, to whom he conmiunicated his secret about 1451, was soon inyited to Florence, where he was afterwards employed. Lanzi (yol. L) appears to think that Domenico painted seyeral petures in Venice after his acquaintance with Antonella Had this been the case, or had Anlonello made known his secret at once to others besides Domenico (as Vasari in one place seems to say), oil painting must haye been practised in Venice much earUer than 1473. The first oil pictures known to haye been executed in Italy by Italian artists, in consetmence of Antonello's communication, were those (now no longer existing) by Domenico Veneziano and Andrea del Castagno on the walls of the Fortinarl chapel in Santa Maria Nuoya, at Florence. The execution of those works must haye taken a con- siderable time, the middle period of which may haye been about 1460. F.

Berchem painted in several styles — portrait, figure (large and small), battles, and landscape with cattle and small figures, in which last class he is chiefly distinguished. His pictures are remarkable for their composition, their careful finish, and at the same time freedom of handling ; and* for their warm tone of colour and brilliant lighting. He is sup- posed by some,, from the nature of his scenes, to have studied in Italy.

He studied painting Hinder Fra Filippo Lippi, and became one of the most celebrated painters of the fifteenth centtoy, though all his works are characterized by that hardness of manner common to most of the painters of tliis time, and known among the Italians by the term quattrocentiamo.

Sebastien Bourdon was bom at Montpellier in 161 6. He was instructed by his father, and exhibited great ability ctt a very early age ; he painted a ceiling in fresco in a ch&teau near Bordeaux, in his fourteenth year. He studied afterwards at Paris, and subsequently three years at Rome ; and obtained great reputation, in 1643, by his celebrated picture of tiie Crucifixion of St. Peter, which was originally placed in the Cathedral of Notre Dame, at Paris, but is now in the Louvre. Bourdon was a Protestant, and being anxious to avoid the troubles of the civil wars of the time, he went in 1652 to Sweden, where he was appointed by Christina her principal painter. On the abdication of Christina he returned to France, and in 1663 again settled in Paris, where he executed many works in diflFerent styles, history, landscape, and genre^ by which he added greatly to his reputation. He was one of the original twelve a/ndena of the old academy of painting established at Paris in 1648 : he died rector of the academy May 8, 1671. The landscapes of Bourdon somewhat resemble those of Salvator Rosa, and have a wild melancholy character.

He instanced it, and a picture of '^Jacob's Dream\" by Salvator Bosa, as happy examples of th^ poetical style of landscape, in his discourse on the character of Gainsborough to the students of the Royal Academy in 1788. It was bequeathed by Sir Joshua to Sir George Beaumont, by whom it was presented to the nation In 1826. BOUTS. DiERiCK Bouts, recently but incorrectly called Stuer- BOUT, was a native of Haarlem ; his father, a landscape painter, was a native of Louvain ; Guicciardini notices the latter as Dirick da Lovano ; he is said to have died on the 6th of May 1400. Guicciardini and Van Mander speak of Bouts as Dirck Van Haarlem. The date of his birth is not known, but has been assumed to be 1391 : he appears however to have been established at Louvain, where, »^.^-^.^»^— — »»»«— ^■^\"^^^— \"\"■\"^^^■^— ^^™~^^^^—''*^^— \"^^^^— ™\"»»^.— \"\"^^i^^-^i^— »»»— p^^-^^— »~^— ^^» » * lyArgenville, Ahrigi de la Vie dea plus fameux Peintresj Paris, 1746-52 • Qaolt de Saint-Germam, Les Trots Siieles de la Peinture en France, Paris, 1808.

Bouts lived in a house of his own in the Rue de^ B^eollets at Louvain, to which city he was oflScial painter, and his name appears in the Public Acts as late as April 1475. On the 25th of August of that year he was already dead. In the month of June 1 476 his property was. divided between his two sons Dierick and Albert his heirs, and both painters ; the two daughters, Catherine and Gertrude, had become nuns. Bouts is distinguished for his elaborate execution and rich colouring ; but his figures are occasionally somewhat elongated. The galleries of Munich and Berlin have some fine examples ascribed to him, but the most celebrated of his works are the two large pictures now in the Boyal Gallery of Brussels, illustrating the so-called \"Golden Legend,\" and known as the First and Second pictures of the Emperor Otho and the Empress Mary.* They were painted for the Council-hall of Louvain in 1468, and. Dierick received 230 crowns for thenLf The following picture is ascribed to this painter :-^ No. 783. The Exhum^ltion of St. Hubert, Bishop of li^e. The scene takes place in the choir of a handsome Gothic church ; over the altar is a statue of St. Peter, and on the altar is the shrine of St. Hubert The body of the saint in his robes, and with the mitre on his head, is sup- ported by two monks just above the opening pf the grave ; at his head kneels a bishop^ and another bishop is incensing the body, at his feet.

BRAMANTINOw— BRONZINO^ 49 BRAMANTINO. Bartolommeo Suaudi, called Bramantino from his master Bramante, the architect and painter, was the son of Alberto Suardi, a man of property in Milan. Bartolommeo aecompatded Bramante about 1495 to Rome, and was employed by Julius II. in making a series of portraits highljr, praised by VasarL In 1513 the monks of Clair- YBiOs. (monaci Clarevailenaies) undertook to pay Bramantino 80 ducats for a Pietd and some figures of saints which he had then executed for their sacristy. In 1525 the Duke Francesco II. appointed him his architect and painter, on account of distinguished services as an engineer ; he was entrusted with the repair of the fortifications of Milan, threatened in that year by the troops of the Emperor Charles V. under the Marquis of Pescara.* As a painter Bramantino was distinguished for his knowledge of per- spective and skill in foreshortening. The dates of his birth and death are both unknown ; but though living in 1529, he was already dead in 1536. No. 729.
