November 27, 2006 – AppForge, Inc., a leading mobile solutions company, today announced support for the entire Palm® Treo™ product line, adding the recently launched Treo 680 smartphone to the roster of devices supported by its patented, award-winning Crossfire mobile application platform.

Optimized for developing and delivering customer-facing mobile applications, Crossfire 6.5 enables enterprises to put applications on the widest array of mobile devices, regardless of language, platform or network, with a feature set that enables enterprises to provide rich branded end-user self-service and content delivery applications.

With the Treo 680 now in its device lineup, AppForge allows companies to serve a broader audience of smartphone users, not only with line-of-business applications for their own workforce, but by turning their customers' mobile devices into true web services terminals. For example, a developer of a customer-facing travel application could easily add a web service that delivers local weather information, with a look and feel close to that of any native object in the application. Enterprises will also be able to efficiently migrate their internal mobile applications from one operating system to another and to these new devices.

"We are committed to providing companies with an uncompromised mobile experience," said Chris Tyburski, chief technology officer, AppForge, Inc. "Key to this is taking the challenge of device diversity off the table, by providing support for new devices and operating systems as they enter the marketplace, as we are with the Treo 680."

"Today's mobile users want, and expect, an enhanced mobile experience that is tailored to their lifestyles and goes beyond voice, text messaging and email," said Mark Bercow, senior vice president, business development, Palm, Inc. "By combining the power of Treo 680 and the flexibility of Crossfire, enterprise developers will have the ability to reach a broader audience with innovative customer-facing applications that are powerful and easy to use."
