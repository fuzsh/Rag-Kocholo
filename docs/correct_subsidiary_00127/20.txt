The answer is yes. If you use the Net60 app from https://www.redfivelabs.com/default.aspx

You have to pay for it though. I don't think there is a free or open source version

There are also plans by Microsoft and Nokia to have Silverlight on Symbian Devices

A quick google tells me the answer is "no". http://www.allaboutsymbian.com/forum/archive/index.php/t-11171.html

Apparently there was a company called AppForge that created a product that allowed compiling C# into Symbian apps. After Oracle acquired them, it appears that this product is defunct.
