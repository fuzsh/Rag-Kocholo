The global m-commerce market is expected to touch USD 119 Billion by 2015, a 180% increase from 2012. In addition, enterprises have increased their adoption of Enterprise Mobility solutions driven by gains in operational efficiency, employee needs and peer pressure. Mobile Application Market The total number of global smartphone users crossed 1 Billion in 2012. Users are now spending over 2 hours a day using mobile applications, double the time compared to 2010 Currently there are over 600,000 apps available in Apple’s App Store and Google Play stores respectively Revenues from mobile and tablet apps market in 2012-13 stood at USD 25.2 Billion. App stores recorded 56 Billion downloads with iOS platform having a 75% share followed by Android with 17% Talent Supply and Demand There were about 281,000 registered mobile developers in 2012. 57% of these developers have iOS skills and 32% have Android skills However, job posting for mobile developers have doubled over the last two years, while the number of registered developers has increased by only 13%. This has led to a significant demand supply gap Graphic Design, iOS, Android, HTML 5, UX/UI, Windows 8 SDK etc. are some of the key skills that will witness talent shortages in the next 2-3 years\n\n6. 6 Summary SummarySummary What are companies doing to bridge the demand supply gap? Companies are following a three pronged approach to bridge talent gap a) Leveraging Global Talent ‘Hot Spots’ To Tap Key Skills  Large organizations are leveraging global locations (outside of the US) such as China, Israel and Europe which have availability of skilled talent for development related activities  Companies are setting up centers in the APAC region for predominantly testing and other support work (increase capacity for the core developers) b) Acquiring For Talent And Capabilities  Over the last 2 to 3 years leading companies such as Google, Zynga, Facebook, EA etc. have expanded their product portfolio and services portfolio by acquiring start-ups or smaller companies  In 2011, the total value of M&A deals in this domain was USD $18.8 billion, a 100% growth from 2010. The number of deals in 2012 grew by 16% compared to 2011. b) Outsourcing Key Mobile Development To Niche Service Providers • Companies are outsourcing high end work such as UI/UX design, prototyping etc. to niche service providers in locations within and outside of the US Talent Neuron Viewpoint – There is an intense competition for skilled mobile talent across the globe. In addition, the dynamic nature of the industry is making it difficult for companies to find the right talent with updated skill sets. Changing job requirements, inability to meet compensation and benefits expectations and location related constraints are widening the supply demand talent gap. To mitigate the challenges, companies need to streamline their recruitment processes, provide on the job training to bridge skill gaps and aggressively use social media and mobile technology forums to reach further into the developer community\n\n7.

Hence stringent job descriptions will reduce the potential candidates pool •Companies are offering training on the job to bridge skill gaps. This also helps to attract candidates Streamline recruitment process •Candidates usually have a ‘black hole’ experience after applying for jobs. Companies need to ensure that recruiters maintain continuous communication with candidates •Due to high demand, mobile developers could have multiple job offers in hand and hence its essential that candidate applications are fast tracked Compensation and benefits packages are not structured well •Compensation and benefits expectations of mobile developers is different from other functions •Flex times, ESOP’s, part-time work, rewards based work environment etc. are some of the benefits that need to be offered to candidates at the recruitment stage itself Changing job requirements •Every mobile solution/platform has a different job requirement •Recruiters and HR teams need to understand the underlying mobile technology and requirements before writing job descriptions •Not being able to comprehend location related trends is a key barrier. For ex. finding potential iOS developers in countries like China and India is lot more difficult compared to Android developers"
