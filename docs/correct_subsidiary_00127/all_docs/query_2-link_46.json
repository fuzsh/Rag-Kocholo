Determinants of Advantage - Israel Demand Conditions Factor Conditions 1) Government Subsidy 1) High Skilled Labor for R&D projects 2) Low cost 2) Programs to encourage technological incubators. Related & Supporting Industries Firm Strategy & Rivalry 1) Government encouraged 1) Local competition among bilateral and multilateral various IT firms in Israel to bring international R&D collaboration about IP protected software Reference: R&D Policy in Israel-An Overview and Reassessment – Manuel Trajtenberg (Competitive Advantage of Nations by Michael E.

Challenges for IT Products from India Lack of VC Investments in Software Product Lack of Business Lack of Experienced Distribution Management Network and Talent Global Access Challenges for Indian Higher Entry Smaller Base of Barrier due to Domestic Market Software MNC presence Industry\n\n21. Liabilities of Origin - India Customer • Good Service Quality. Poor Product Quality. Perception • Low Brand Value Quality of • Risk averse culture. Lack of technological incubators. Ecosystem • Poor Access to Financial Capital. Lack of VC funding. Market • Lack of Management Talent with Global Experience Familiarity & • Lack of Networking within the Industries. Access\n\n22. Challenges in Indian IT Services Space • Ever increasing pressure on the margin. • Growing clout of MNC services firm(s) choking the supply as well as demand side. • Other evolving low cost locations. • Higher Employee turn out rate. • Low or no differentiation. • Higher expectations from investors. • Currency fluctuation/appreciation. • Reducing Govt. incentives. • Growth for top companies seems to be unsustainable. • Growth for Tier-II companies already hit plateau, now profitability seems to be under threat. • So, what was BLUE-OCEAN seem to becoming RED-OCEAN.\n\n23. Indian Providers and MNCs Capabilities Are Converging MNCs Indian Providers Strengths: Strengths:  IBM, Accenture and Hewlett-Packard have  India's top three IT firms each has a market value large captives in India enabling them to move of between $18 billion-$27 billion and boasts a Convergence global footprint. more of their overseas work to these lower- cost centers  Cognizant Technology has bought the Indian  Oracle and Dell have snapped up targets to backoffice unit of UBS for about $75 million grow beyond their core areas, while Xerox is  HCL Technologies paid about 440 million pounds buying Affiliated Computer Services for $5.5 ($720 million) for Axon, marking the biggest billion to jump into the outsourcing sector. overseas acquisition by an Indian IT firm.  These companies have also made acquisitions  TCS acquired Citi Global Services that enable them to compete better , Comicrom, Phoenix Global Solutions, AFS etc strengthening its BPO segment  Infosys acquired the BPO arm of Royal Philips  Cultural and integration risks associated with large M&A are also a barrier and Indian firms are unlikely to shed their cautious approach.\n\n24. Why Indian Firms Shy from Large Overseas M&A? M & A leads to • High costs of synergy between both companies. • High Risk for Large Investments. • Post acquisition integration issues. • Cultural differences. Agency problem where the Indian IT firms focus on quarterly profits instead of future potential profits to keep the investors (shareholders) happy. Investments will dent their earnings and affect stock prices. Reference: Dubious Value of International Acquisitions by Emerging Economy Firms: The Case of Indian Firms – Aneel Karnani\n\n25. Stock Price Movements after M&A - TCS acquiring Citi Global Services\n\n26. Stock Price Movements after M&A - IBM Acquisitions IBM acquisition of Sterling Commerce in 2010 IBM acquisition of Price water House Coopers in 2002\n\n27. Conclusion – M&A for Big Indian IT firms Right now, Indian IT services businesses are able to grow since there is local talent pool available (Organic Growth) at a much lesser cost compared to acquiring another company along with all its integration challenges. However, considering global firms like IBM, Accenture are moving down the value chain by leveraging the cost arbitrage in India, we see small but focused Acquisitions of would be the way to leap into the big league and gain more competitive advantage.\n\n28. Conclusion - Product Companies M&A • Currently, the Indian Product Companies are far from being successful as compared to Silicon Valley companies. – The products have less IP generation. – Do not have solid customer base. – No immediate ROI in sight. Hence, top global IT majors will continue to overlook the Indian Product companies till our Product Industry makes progress. Suggestions: • An Entrepreneurial culture backed by industry insights needs to be cultivated. • The Ecosystem should be in place where there is continuous encouragement for people to innovate. • Watch out for emerging technologies. • Look for missing pieces in the Big company’s product portfolio. • Take the advantage of growing domestic market , build competence/capabilities and leverage it to rest of the world. • Last but not the least its innovation, innovation and innovation. • It’s a win-win game for Indian IT Product as well as IT Services firms if proper synergy can be brought into.\n\n29. Recommendations • Invest for Future Growth, Indian IT Services majors need to take the opportunity of emerging trends in technology in the form of Cloud based applications and computing. Cloud computing is necessarily a disruptive in nature and Indian IT firms need to take the advantage of this. • Increase R&D expenditure, R&D expenditure as share of revenue needs to increase. • Make use of Local Markets, Startups Mid-size, need to focus on the local needs (which are typically very high in scale), develop products and services and then take the products to global market. We see good opportunity for such reverse- innovation. • Leverage on the Engineering Prowess, Both Tech startups as well as IT majors need to leverage on the product building capabilities of the engineers from the MNC captive units. • Leadership Matters, Finally, it is the leadership who needs to set the strategic direction and follow the dream of “Think Big, Think Long Term”. Things take longer and more painful to happen with product development companies. To have a sustainable energy & passion to run the product business, you need to think big and have the patience and perseverance to follow the long-term vision.\n\n30. Concluding Thought The statistics indicate that a start up Technology Company is more likely to be acquired than it is to go public. Given that reality, a start up Technology Company should invest the time to identify the Large Companies that are the best candidates to meet start up company’s strategic needs. It also should identify the strategic objectives of those Large Tech Companies and keep that data in mind during its business planning process. - Fenwick & West\n\n31.
