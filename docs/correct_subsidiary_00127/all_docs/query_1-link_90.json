        "text": "Installation Instructions:\n\n--------------------------\n\nThe archive format used for the Forge distribution is \".tar.bz2\". There are utilities for Windows, Mac OS and the various *nix's that can be used to extract/decompress these \".tar.bz2\" archives. We recommend that you extract/decompress the Forge archive into a new and unused folder.\n\nSome people use the Windows application 7zip. This utility can be found at http://www.7-zip.org/download.html. Mac users can double click on the archive and the application Archive Utility will launch and extract the archive. Mac users do not need to download a separate utility.\n\nOnce the Forge archive has been decompressed you should then be able to launch Forge by using the included launcher. Launching Forge by double clicking on the forge jar file in the past caused a java heap space error. Forge's memory requirements have increased over time and the launchers increase the java heap space available to Forge. Currently you can launch Forge by double clicking on the forge jar file without a java heap space error but this is likely to change as we add in more sounds, icons, etc.\n\nUpdating to a newer version Instructions:\n\n-----------------------------------------\n\n- User data migration -\n\nUser data files, like decks, saved gauntlets, and card pictures, are now stored in new directories separate from the program data. When this version of Forge is first run, it will scan the program directory for all user data and automatically migrate the files to their new homes. There are three defined user data directores: userDir, cacheDir, and cardPicsDir, and their locations depend on the standard paths for your operating system:\n\nWindows:\n\nuserDir=%APPDATA%/Forge/\n\ncacheDir=%LOCALAPPDATA%/Forge/Cache/ (or %APPDATA%/Forge/Cache/ for windows versions before the local/roaming directory split)\n\nOSX:\n\nuserDir=$HOME/Library/Application Support/Forge/\n\ncacheDir=$HOME/Library/Caches/Forge/\n\nLinux:\n\nuserDir=$HOME/.forge/\n\ncacheDir=$HOME/.cache/forge/\n\nThe appdata directory is hidden by default in Win7. Open a Windows Explorer window (or double-click on My Computer] and in the address field type \"%appdata%/forge/\" (without the quotes). If that doesn't work, type \"%appdata\"/roaming/forge\".\n\ncardPicsDir is defined as <cacheDir>/pics/cards/ by default. If you wish to use a non-default directory, please see the forge.profile.preferences.example file located in the Forge installation directory root. You can use this file to, for example, share the card pics directory with another program, such as Magic Workstation.\n\nIf you are using the Mac OS X version of Forge then you will find the forge.profile.preferences.example file by right clicking or control clicking on the Forge.app icon. Select \"Show Package Contents\" from the contextual menu. A Finder window will open and will display a folder named Contents. Navigate to the folder:\n\n/Contents/Resources/Java/\n\nand you will find the file named forge.profile.preferences.example.\n\nFor reference, here is the full list of moved directories and files:\n\nOld location New location\n\n---------------- ----------------------\n\nres/decks/ <userDir>/decks/\n\nres/gauntlet/ <userDir>/gauntlet/\n\nres/layouts/ <userDir>/preferences/\n\nres/preferences/ <userDir>/preferences/\n\nres/quest/data/ <userDir>/quest/saves/\n\nres/pics/ <cacheDir>/pics/\n\nforge.log <userDir>/forge.log\n\n- New Import Data dialog -\n\nThe Import Pictures dialog, accessed via the Content Downloaders submenu, has received an overhaul and has been reincarnated as the Import Data dialog. You may recognize it from the automatic data migration procedure if you had any data to migrate when this version was first started. Instead of just importing pictures from a previous version of Forge, it can now import any kind of Forge data whatsoever. If you have a directory full of deck files, you can use the Import Data dialog to copy or move them to the appropriate directory. If you have just downloaded a torrent of high-quality pics for a particular set, use the Import Data dialog to get them to the proper place. The dialog give you a full listing of all file copy/move operations, so you can see what will happen before you click 'Start Import'.\n\nAn importer option was added for including pictures in set-specific card directories that don't map to any currently known card. This handles the case where people have collected complete sets of pics in anticipation of when Forge supports them.\n\nThe Mac OS application version:\n\n-------------------------------\n\nWe have packaged the Forge BETA version as a Mac OS application. You can double click the Forge.app icon to launch the forge application on your Apple computer running Mac OS. This application will automatically increase the java heap space memory for you as it launches. This version does not require the forge.command file and it does not need to start the Terminal application as part of the start up process.\n\nIf you update your OS to Apple OSX 10.8 Mountain Lion and try to launch a new version of forge that you will likely get a dialog which states \"File is damaged and cannot be opened. Please move to trash.\"\n\nMountain Lion comes with a new Gatekeeper feature and this is probably blocking your ability to launch this newer version of forge. Visit the link below and follow the instructions. They are fairly long and detailed.\n\nhttp://support.apple.com/kb/HT5290?viewlocale=en_US&locale=en_US\n\nPlease note that the issue is most likely caused by Mountain Lion's Gatekeeper feature and it is extremely unlikely that the forge dev team will attempt to get a unique Developer ID from Apple and use it to digitally sign our forge app.\n\nPicture location info:\n\n----------------------\n\nThe instructions that were found in this section are now out of date. Current instructions can be found in the CHANGES.txt and forge.profile.properties.example files.\n\nLaunching Forge and Memory Issues:\n\n----------------------------------\n\nIn the past, some people noticed java heap space errors and lengthy pauses. The memory requirements for Forge have increased over time. The default setting on your computer for the java heap space may not be enough to prevent the above problems.\n\nThe technically proficient can launch the forge jar with an argument from the CLI. The argument \"-Xmx512m\" may work for computers with 1 Gig of memory. Computers with 2 Gigs or more of memory should be able to use \"-Xmx1024m\" as an argument.\n\nWe have created several scripts that will launch the Forge jar with \"-Xmx1024m\" as an argument. People using Windows OS should double click the \"forge.exe\" file. People using one of the other *nix OS should double click the \"forge.sh\" file. People using Apple's Mac OS X should download the Mac version of Forge and then double click the \"forge.app\" application.\n\nThe script file must be located in the same folder as the Forge jar file and the Forge jar file name can not be changed. Otherwise, the scripts will not work.\n\nIf you have a low end machine you may find that the scripts above will prevent java heap space errors but will find that Forge still runs very slowly at times.\n\nIn this case you can try the following. You can try using low quality pictures rather than the high quality pictures. Or you can try removing all of the jpg pictures from the pics folder.\n\nForge failed to launch:\n\n-----------------------\n\nIf you're trying to run Forge for the first time, but it doesn't open up, you can try the following to get some output and help yourself/us solve the problem.\n\n1) Open up a terminal\n\n- Under Windows, press Windows+R, type \"cmd\", hit enter\n\n- Under Linux, you probably know that yourself. Use your distribution's application menu, and search for \"terminal\" in a group like \"utilities\".\n\n- Launch the program named \"Console.app\" which can be found in your /Applications/Utilities/ folder. Highlight the \"All Messages\" option and click on the \"Clear Display\" button before launching Forge.\n\n2) Go to the folder where you unpacked Forge\n\n- Windows: Let's say your forge is in D:\\Programs\\Forge.\n\n- Type \"D:\", Enter to change to the D: drive.\n\n- Type \"cd \\Programs\\Forge\", Enter to change to the directory.\n\n- NOTE: On nonenglish systems, you might have problems due to the poor localization of Windows. Go to the innermost directory you find (worst case is \"\\\"), then \"dir\", Enter to show all folders in that folder. Search for the one you're probably wanting. For Example the German \"Programme\" could really be \"Program Files\" or something like that.\n\n- NOTE: You might have to \"quote\" directory names with Spaces in them\n\n- Linux: Let's say your forge is in /home/user/Forge\n\n- Type \"cd /home/user/Forge\", Enter\n\n- NOTE: You might have to \"quote\" or 'quote' directory names with Spaces in them\n\n- Current versions of Forge no longer include a launcher script for Mac OS, proceed to step three.\n\n3) Run Forge\n\n- On Windows, just type \"forge.exe\", Enter\n\n- On Linux, just type \"forge.sh\", Enter\n\n- Launch the Forge application bundle by double clicking on the program named \"Forge.app\".\n\nNow you will probably see some sort of Error in the console. the first few lines contain a message that might help you. If you can't fix the problem yourself, please take the complete output and report your problem on the Forum.\n\nThe Card Pictures disappear when you restart Forge:\n\n---------------------------------------------------\n\nif you're running Windows 7, make sure you're running the program as an admin, otherwise no changes will be made to your system (nothing is saved). In Windows 7, Forge may be happier when run from somewhere in the My Documents structure, (they call them Libraries now???) or from another partition other than C:. The user has little permission to do much on the system drive.\n\nJava Issues:\n\n------------\n\nForge is likely to be compatible with Java 7 at this time. Some people have used forge with Java 7 and have not reported any problems that are related to Java 7. If you would like to upgrade to Java 7 and have held off because of Forge then you may upgrade as we do not think that it will cause an incompatibility type of problem. We will continue to try to maintain compatibility with Java 6 for the foreseeable future.\n\nForge requires Java 6 and will not run if you have an earlier version of Java. You will need to update to Java 6.\n\nCard Picture Issues:\n\n--------------------\n\nThe server which contained the high quality card pictures is now off line and these high quality card pictures are no longer available as a download from within the forge application. We apologize, but the current dev team do not maintain this server and this matter is out of our control.\n\nSome people are choosing to re-download all of the low quality card and card set pictures when they install the next version of forge. This consumes large amounts of bandwidth needlessly. Please be careful!\n\nThe instructions that were found in this section are now out of date. Current instructions can be found in the CHANGES.txt and forge.profile.properties.example files.\n\nWhen you install a new version of Forge, please follow the instructions that can be found in the CHANGES.txt and forge.profile.properties.example files. This will allow you to reuse your previous picture files and other user data files. This way you will only have to download the pictures for the new cards.\n\nThis should save enough bandwidth that everyone will be able to download the new set pictures from the cardforge server. We do appreciate your efforts to save bandwidth. Thank you.\n\nReporting Bugs:\n\n---------------\n\nTo report a bug with an official beta release, please follow the instructions at http://www.slightlymagic.net/wiki/Forge#I_think_I_found_a_bug_in_Forge._What_do_I_do.3F .\n\nTo report a bug (1) with an alpha test, (2) with a nightly build, (3) with something compiled from the official Forge software repository, or (4) with the leading edge (formerly \"SVN Bug Reports\"), please do not submit your bugs to the forum. Instead, please follow the instructions at http://www.slightlymagic.net/wiki/How_to_File_a_Bug_Report_with_Mantis.\n\nForge will now allow you to upload a crash report to the Forge forum at CCGH.\n\nA new very hard tier category in Quest mode:\n\n--------------------------------------------\n\nYou will notice a new very hard tier category for the opponent. As you change from the previous tier to the next tier (easy to medium, etc.) you will now notice that there is not an abrupt change over. There is now a mixture of decks from the previous tier and the next tier for you to chose from. When you win a match you will complete the advancement to the next tier.\n\nThe Forge Booster Draft mode:\n\n-----------------------------\n\nA significant re-write of the Booster Draft functionality has taken place. Draft from the Full card pool, sets/blocks or custom drafts (like cube). The AI will pick cards more intelligently, and builds decks from picked cards. Old method would pick cards for deck and then stop picking new cards.\n\nThe developer mode:\n\n-------------------\n\nThe developer mode gives us a few new features. These new features will primarily interest the devs as it will now help to test out specific cards while testing combat code changes. You can turn on or off this mode at the Home View -> Game Settings -> Preferences -> Gameplay Options section.\n\nWhen turned on the battlefield will have a tab named \"Dev Mode\". There are a number of useful options in this tab. You can disable loss by milling, generate mana in your mana pool, tutor for card, etc.\n\nNew foil card image available:\n\n------------------------------\n\nRob and Marc have worked together to add in a new feature which will overlay a card's image with a foil like film. A few random cards will have a foil like image in constructed mode games and possibly quest mode games. There is a check box on the Home View -> Game Settings -> Preferences view that you can use to turn this feature on or off.\n\nInformational icons overlays for cards on the battlefield:\n\n----------------------------------------------------------\n\nThe Battlefield will now display three symbolic icons that will overlay creature cards. These icons are used to denote summoning sickness and whether a creature is attacking or blocking. Added additional icons that will be drawn over the cards in the battlefield for phasing and counters at a later date. The attack/block/phasing icons and counters will now also be shown on large cards, only casting cost will be omitted. Lands and tokens with different amounts/types of counters will no longer stack. Tokens with different summoning sickness will no longer stack. Lands that become creatures will now always be moved to the front row.\n\nOptional choice for abilities that are on the stack:\n\n----------------------------------------------------\n\nWhen a spell or an ability appears on the stack and it says \"(OPTIONAL)\" you can right-click it to decide if you want to always accept or to decline it.\n\nMultiple quest files:\n\n---------------------\n\nMultiple quest files are now supported. This allows you to start a new quest and give it a unique name, and it will not overwrite your previous quest game file.\n\nThe new UI now uses tabbed panes:\n\n---------------------------------\n\nWe now have a tab system for sub-menus in the home screen. Quest mode refactored to fit this tab system. It's now considerably easier to use - less cramped, less clicks, more functionality.\n\nThe quest mode card shop:\n\n-------------------------\n\nYou can now buy PreCon decks, Starter packs, Tournament packs and Fat packs from the quest mode card shop.\n\nPlayer Avatar pictures:\n\n-----------------------\n\nThe UI has a few new features including the option to pick an avatar from a collection of pictures. This can be accessed from the Settings -> Avatars tab.\n\nThe organizational structure of the /res/decks/ folder:\n\n-------------------------------------------------------\n\nThe organizational structure of the /res/decks/ folder has been improved and we now have these six subdirectories:\n\n/decks/constructed/\n\n/decks/cube/\n\n/decks/draft/\n\n/decks/plane/\n\n/decks/scheme/\n\n/decks/sealed/\n\nYou can place your deck files from an earlier version of Forge into the /res/decks/ folder. When you next launch Forge these decks will be converted to a newer format and will be moved into the proper subdirectory.\n\nPlease not that your /decks/ directory no longer resides in you /res/ directory and has been moved to <userDir>/decks/.\n\nUser-created themes for Forge's background, fonts, colors and icons:\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nWhen you select a new skin in the Preferences view Forge should save the change to the preference file, quit and then automatically re-launch with the new skin displayed. During testing some people have noticed that Forge is not restarting on their computer and they have to re-launch Forge themselves.\n\nIf anyone is interested in creating additional themes for inclusion in the Forge project then you should visit this topic at CCGH:\n\nhttp://www.slightlymagic.net/forum/viewtopic.php?f=26&t=8449\n\nThe Battlefield UI:\n\n-------------------\n\nThe Battlefield UI has a new feature implemented which allows us to move and resize the panels to new places on the battlefield. This allows us to personalize the battlefield display to our own liking. You should try moving panels by clicking and dragging their tabs.\n\nIf you do not like your efforts to personalize the battlefield display you can revert the display to the default layout by clicking on the Dock button labeled \"Revert layout\".\n\nThe pets in quest mode:\n\n-----------------------\n\nSome adjustments to the pets in quest mode were made. The quest mode plant wall's Deathtouch ability was deemed to be too strong against the AI's attack code and this ability was changed to Wither in this version. This includes a new pet.\n\nThe dock tab has a new button labeled \"Open Layout\":\n\n----------------------------------------------------\n\nThe dock now has a new button labeled \"Open Layout\" along with old button with original function \"Revert Layout\". Modifying the battlefield layout will result in your changes being saved to a file named \"match_preferred.xml\". You can copy and rename that file to share your layouts with other people.\n\nThe new Deck Editors:\n\n---------------------\n\nThe work on the new UI is now finished and this version adds the new UI to the deck editors. We all would like to thank Doublestrike for his contributions to the new UI.\n\nThe new deck editors include:\n\n* a better text search (can search for multiple terms, and \"not\" terms\n\n* interval filters for P/T and CMC\n\n* add/remove 4\n\n* better statistics and draw probabilities\n\n* Toggle-able, sort-able, resize-able, move-able columns\n\n* and of course uses the drag cell layout.\n\nPerformance issues on low end machines:\n\n---------------------------------------\n\nSeveral people have noticed forge slowing down after playing a number of matches without quitting forge in between the matches that are played. The new UI may be involved somehow. We also hope to have this figured out and fixed in the near future. Please be patient in the meanwhile. A recent fix was implemented that should improve the slowdown problem somewhat.\n\nA lot of time and effort have gone into fixing the memory leak problems that were recently noticed and reported to the dev team. Doublestrike and Slapshot deserve our applause and we are very thankful. People should be able to now play long multi match sessions without noticing slow downs and pauses.\n\nSome performance changes were made to Forge and it should now operate more quickly on low end machines. Mid to high level machines are unlikely to notice as much of a performance increase. We tried to hunt down all of the bugs that resulted from these changes but there may still be a bug or two in this beta release.\n\nA note about winning booster packs in quest mode:\n\n-------------------------------------------------\n\nIf you win a quest mode match, you get a booster pack for every 1 or 2 (default) Wins, depending on the difficulty level. If you lose and you are playing on easy mode, you get a booster pack every 1 (default) Loss.\n\nThe new UI:\n\n-----------\n\nThe first step was to update the battlefield window. The second step was to update the New Game window (now named Home view). We got constructed mode and then quest modes working first. We got the draft and sealed modes working again afterwards.\n\nThe work on the new UI is now for the most part finished. We should not expect major changes or major additions to the UI. Future betas may include a few minor bug fixes to the UI. And we may also include a few minor tweaks.\n\nThe new Alpha Strike button:\n\n----------------------------\n\nA new Alpha Strike button was added to the dock. The Dock is one of the tabs availble in the battlefield view.\n\nUsing Forge with the new Mac OS Mountain Lion:\n\n----------------------------------------------\n\nIf you update your OS to Apple OSX 10.8 Mountain Lion and try to launch a new version of forge that you will likely get a dialog which states \"File is damaged and cannot be opened. Please move to trash.\"\n\nMountain Lion comes with a new Gatekeeper feature and this is probably blocking your ability to launch this newer version of forge. Visit the link below and follow the instructions. They are fairly long and detailed.\n\nhttp://support.apple.com/kb/HT5290?viewlocale=en_US&locale=en_US\n\nPlease note that the issue is most likely caused by Mountain Lion's Gatekeeper feature and it is extremely unlikely that the forge dev team will attempt to get a unique Developer ID from Apple and use it to digitally sign our forge app.\n\nThe Forge sealed deck mode:\n\n---------------------------\n\nSealed Deck mode has had a complete rewrite. Full cardpool, block and custom modes are supported. Custom sealed files in the res/sealed folder are exactly the same as custom draft files, except the file extension \".sealed\".\n\nA distinction may now be made between AI decks and Human decks, with the addition of a deck Metadata \"PlayerType\", which right now just helps by sorting human decks into the human combo box and AI decks into the AI combo box.\n\nThe Forge sealed deck mode has undergone significant changes. You can find these in the 1.2.14 beta and later versions. Instead of a single sealed deck match, you can now choose a 1-5 round gauntlet-style tournament where you will face increasingly difficult (probably) opponent decks. You can also choose to use starter packs instead of boosters in the block mode, choose to use 3-12 boosters instead of the default 6 in the full cardpool and custom (cube) modes, and so on.\n\nPerhaps the most notable changes to the sealed deck mode are related to \"fantasy blocks\" and the greatly increased flexibility you have when you are building your own blocks.\n\nThe new Gauntlet mode:\n\n----------------------\n\nA new Gauntlet mode has been added. This mode gives you four options: Quick Gauntlet, Build A Gauntlet, Load Gauntlet and Gauntlet Contests. You can create a group of computer decks to play against by choosing either Custom user decks, Quest Decks, Fully random color decks or Semi-random theme decks.\n\nThe new Variant mode (was named Multiplayer):\n\n---------------------------------------------\n\nA new multiplayer mode has also been added. You should be able to play against multiple AI opponents at this time. You should note that the current Archenemy mode does not use Schemes at this time.\n\nA lot of things are planned for this new multiplayer mode and it will take time to finish. Please enjoy what we have at this time and be patient. :)\n\nSince Multiplayer is so new, not all cards will be 100% compatible right away as we expand scripting to handle multiple players.\n\nThe older match layout files are incompatible with the new multiplayer mode. The original match_default.xml, match_preferred.xml and the match_preferred.xml saved to a different name files have to go and can no longer be used. You can keep your editor_preferred.xml file. But you will have to setup your match view panels using the new match_default.xml file.\n\nThe new damage dialog:\n\n----------------------\n\nThe new damage dialog now uses the new UI.\n\nWhen choosing cards, sources, etc. using a list box:\n\n----------------------------------------------------\n\nWhen choosing cards, sources, etc. using a list box, the currently selected card will now be visually highlighted on the play field (to better distinguish between e.g. three different cards with the same name on the play field). Now the visual highlighting of a card will also work when declaring the order of blockers.\n\nReturn to Ravnica Guild Sealed Deck mode:\n\n-----------------------------------------\n\nAdded Return to Ravnica Guild Sealed Deck mode. Start a new sealed deck game, choose \"Block / Set\" and then scroll down until you find \"Return to Ravnica Guild Sealed (block)\". Select that. From the \"Choose Set Combination\" menu, select the first option. You will be prompted twice to pick your guild (once for the promo cards, once for the actual booster - you should choose the same guild both times). After that you're ready to go.\n\nTargeting arrows are now available in the battlefield display:\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThe Targeting Overlay has been fixed and re-enabled. It now correctly shows the targeting arcs in cases when it previously showed them in the wrong direction. The match UI is properly refreshed when the targeting arcs are switched on/off. The defunct \"mouseover-only\" mode is currently disabled (it crashes Forge, difficult to fix).\n\nThe visuals for targeting arrows has been improved and looks better, with an adaptation of the arrow drawing code from MAGE. Thanks to the MAGE team for permission for the adaptation.\n\nSome people have noticed slowdowns when Targeting arrows are enabled. The battlefield Dock tab includes a targeting icon. You can set the targeting arrows to Off or to Card mouseover to speed up the game.\n\nThe new sound system:\n\n---------------------\n\nForge now has a sound effect system in place. Several basic sounds are linked to the code now and will be enabled when \"Enable Sounds\" option is checked in the preferences. It supports WAV and AU file formats.\n\nCurrently supported sound effects are:\n\n(the ones already available in the standard installation of Forge are marked with a [*])\n\nAddCounter [*] - add_counter.wav - triggered when a counter is added to a permanent.\n\nArtifact[*] - artifact.wav - triggered when an artifact is played.\n\nArtifactCreature [*] - artifact_creature.wav - triggered when an artifact creature is played.\n\nBlackLand [*] - black_land.wav - triggered when a land with the \"B\" mana ability is played.\n\nBlock [*] - block.wav - triggered when a blocker is assigned.\n\nBlueLand [*] - blue_land.wav - triggered when a land with the \"U\" mana ability is played.\n\nCreature [*] - creature.wav - triggered when a creature is played.\n\nDamage - damage.wav - triggered when a creature is damaged.\n\nDestroy [*] - destroy.wav - triggered when a permanent is destroyed.\n\nDiscard [*] - discard.wav - triggered when a player discards a card.\n\nDraw [*] - draw.wav - triggered when a player draws a card.\n\nEnchantment [*] - enchant.wav - triggered when an enchantment is played.\n\nEndOfTurn [*] - end_of_turn.wav - triggered at the end of turn.\n\nEquip [*] - equip.wav - triggered when an equipment is equipped.\n\nExile - exile.wav - triggered when a card is exiled.\n\nFlipCoin [*] - flip_coin.wav - triggered when a coin is flipped.\n\nGreenLand [*] - green_land.wav - triggered when a land with the \"G\" mana ability is played.\n\nInstant [*] - instant.wav - triggered when an instant is played.\n\nLifeGain - life_gain.wav - triggered when a player gains life.\n\nLifeLoss [*] - life_loss.wav - triggered when a player loses life.\n\nLoseDuel[*] - lose_duel.wav - triggered when a player loses a duel.\n\nManaBurn - mana_burn.wav - triggered during a mana burn if the appropriate rule is enabled.\n\nOtherLand - other_land.wav - triggered when a land with non-color mana abilities or any other land is played.\n\nPlaneswalker [*] - planeswalker.wav - triggered when a planeswalker is played.\n\nPoison [*] - poison.wav - triggered when a player receives a poison counter.\n\nRedLand [*] - red_land.wav - triggered when a land with the \"R\" mana ability is played.\n\nRegen - regeneration.wav - triggered when a creature is regenerated.\n\nRemoveCounter - remove_counter.wav - triggered when a counter is removed from a permanent.\n\nSacrifice - sacrifice.wav - triggered when a permanent is sacrificed.\n\nSorcery [*] - sorcery.wav - triggered when a sorcery is played.\n\nShuffle [*] - shuffle.wav - triggered when a player shuffles his deck.\n\nTap [*] - tap.wav - triggered when a permanent is tapped.\n\nToken [*] - token.wav - triggered when a token is created.\n\nUntap [*] - untap.wav - triggered when a permanent is untapped.\n\nWhiteLand [*] - white_land.wav - triggered when a land with the \"W\" mana ability is played.\n\nWinDuel [*] - win_duel.wav - triggered when a player wins the duel.\n\nAll sounds use the event bus model now and are not called directly.\n\nThe new Vanguard mode:\n\n----------------------\n\nWe now have a Vanguard mode implemented. This is a work in progress. The older match layout files are incompatible with the new Vanguard mode. The original match_default.xml, match_preferred.xml and the match_preferred.xml saved to a different name files need to be deleted and can no longer be used. You can keep your editor_preferred.xml file. But you will have to setup your match view panels using the new match_default.xml file.\n\nThe new Archenemy mode:\n\n-----------------------\n\nSchemes have been added to the Archenemy mode. This is a work in progress and there may be a bug or two for us to find.\n\nQuest Worlds:\n\n-------------\n\nThis version allows you to travel between the regular quest world and the other worlds (Shandalar, Ravnica, Jamuraa, more may be added in the future) to get different duel opponents and challenges. You will have to complete your current challenges before traveling or you will lose them.\n\nWorld-specific format enforcing and starting world selection are available. Something has to be done about locked (non-repeatable) challenges so they do not end up locking other challenges in different worlds.\n\nForge now has sideboards for the human player:\n\n----------------------------------------------\n\nSideboards have been implemented for Human players. We currently have:\n\n* Sideboard creation support in relevant deck editor modes.\n\n* In-game sideboarding with persistence between rounds in a match and sorting of cards in the in-game sideboard editor.\n\n* Sideboard supported as a zone, with some relevant cards already in.\n\n* Correct validation of decks, both before the game starts and between the rounds (Limited min 40, Constructed min 60, free-form sideboard/main in Draft and Sealed, 1:1 sideboarding with 0 or 15 cards allowed in sideboard in Constructed (all variants) and Quest; OK to have less than minimum between rounds in a match in all modes if lost cards on ante).\n\n* Correct (fingers crossed) interaction of sideboarding with other relevant aspects of Forge rule enforcement (mulligan and ante interactions were corrected, initial hand and library between rounds were both corrected, everything else looks so far so good).\n\nWe don't yet have:\n\n* AI sideboarding.\n\nThe deck conformance/legality limitation:\n\n-----------------------------------------\n\nThe deck conformance/legality is now a user-toggable preference and is enabled by default. You no longer need to turn on dev mode to play an illegal deck.\n\nUsing Forge on displays that are only 600 pixels tall or slightly larger:\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThe \"Sanctioned Format: Constructed\" view should now be compatible with displays that are only 600 pixels tall. The deck list at 600 pixels tall should now display three lines of text rather than less than a single line of text.\n\nWe are looking for help in finding additional sound files for the new sound feature:\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThis version of forge includes a few sound files for the new sound effect system. While we have several sounds assigned to a few of the available events there are a number of events that do not yet have a assigned sound file. This should be considered a work in progress and we could use some help in finding interesting sounds that we can add to forge.\n\nThe sound files need to be in wav or au format, wav appears to be more widespread but the code can handle either format. The sound files need to be copyright-free and they should be in the public domain.\n\nYou can either record your own sounds if you have the necessary equipment or you may be able to find an appropriate sound on a website such as http://www.freesound.org/browse/\n\nYou should note that sound files can be large and we would like to avoid this if possible. A good size to shoot for would be 50 K or less. There is a freeware sound editor that may have versions for all operating systems. This app is named Audacity.\n\nWe have a forge forum topic at the Collectible Card Games Headquarters web site that is devoted to finding sounds for this new sound system. Please visit this topic and contribute a sound or two. We can use your help and assistance. :)\n\nhttp://www.slightlymagic.net/forum/viewtopic.php?f=26&t=8570\n\nNotes about the second Quest World, Jamuraa:\n\n--------------------------------------------\n\nA second Quest World, Jamuraa, has been added to Forge. When playing Quest mode, it is now possible to 'Travel' between the regular Quest environment and the two Worlds, Shandalar and Jamuraa, both of which include special formats, opponents and challenges. Or you can start a new Quest in any of them.\n\nLike Shandalar, Jamuraa is a fantasy world. Its peaceful existence has recently been wrecked by a planar conjunction that shattered the barriers between Jamuraa and the infernal planes known as Jahim, Saqar, and Jahannam. The demon planeswalkers who rule those planes, and their hellish sister, Lilith, are now extending their influence over Jamuraa and gradually destroying the whole continent. Your task is to fight their minions and ultimately challenge the four demons - but beware, their destructive might is unfathomable!\n\nFrom a technical perspective, the following sets are available to the player in Jamuraa:\n\n5th Edition, Arabian Nights, Mirage, Visions, Weatherlight.\n\nJamuraa contains:\n\n- 81 opponent decks, broken down as follows: 13 'easy' decks, 17 'medium' decks, 31 'hard' decks, and 20 'very hard' decks.\n\n- 9 challenges, including the 4 demon planeswalkers (the 3 demon rulers and Lilith) and 5 other special scenarios set in Jamuraa. All challenges are repeatable. All are fairly hard, and the 4 demon challenges are especially fiendish.\n\nFor the most part, the opponent duel and challenge decks are built with the same format restrictions as your own cardpool, and some of the easiest opponent decks were in fact based on a limited cardpool. But there will be exceptions, especially in the hard/very hard decks and challenges, which can be more like Vintage/T1 decks than pure Mirage + 5th Edition decks. There will be older cards here and there, and maybe even a random Tempest card or two (although these are extremely scarce!).\n\nHint: if you find the later 'Vintage' opponent decks unfair or near-impossible to beat with your 5th Edition/Mirage block cards, you can Travel to Shandalar and collect some old power cards there, and then return to Jamuraa. Just remember to complete your challenges before traveling.\n\nInformation on the quest worlds format can be found in this topic:\n\nhttp://www.slightlymagic.net/forum/viewtopic.php?f=26&t=9258\n\nNew Deck Editor features with improved Filters:\n\n-----------------------------------------------\n\nSome work is being done on the various deck editors -- including the quest spell shop -- and we hope to add in additional features while improving the UI. Here is a quick tutorial on the new features:\n\nFILTERS\n\nThe Filters tab has been removed and filters are now controlled from the Card Catalog tab. Pretty much everything that used to be a checkbox is now represented by a toggle button. The statistics labels at the top for colors and card types can now be clicked to toggle display of the related cards. Clicking the Total Cards label in the upper left will alternately set all filters on and off.\n\nText searches are done by just typing the the text box. The results will update as you type. Use the combo box to the right of the text box to set whether the search should be for cards with or without the specified text. The three toggle buttons to the right of the combo box allow you to specify where in the card the text should (or should not) match. Complex text searches, such as for goblin creatures with haste but not with kicker costs, are possible by stacking the search filters. Put the current search filter on the stack by selecting the \"Add filter\" button to the left of the text box and choosing the \"Current text search\" option. You can also use the keyboard shortcut Ctrl+Enter (Cmd+Enter on OSX). This will keep your current text search applied, but will clear the text box and allow you to input the next search filter. To perform the example goblin search above, you would:\n\n1) Ensure \"in\" is displayed in the the combo box. Enter \"goblin\" in the text box and deselect Name and Text so that only Type is selected.\n\n2) Hit Ctrl+Enter (Cmd+Enter on OSX). Notice the \"Contains: 'goblin\" in: type\" filter appears below the text box.\n\n3) Type \"haste\" in the text box. Deselect Type and select Text. Hit Ctrl+Enter.\n\n4) Change the combo box from \"in\" to \"not in\". Type \"kicker\" in the text box.\n\nThe shown entries match your combined search filter. Click the little 'x' in the upper right corner of each search widget to remove that filter from the filter stack.\n\nFormat filters allow you to restrict the shown cards to those that are legal in a particular format. Select the \"Add filter\" button, hover over the \"Format\" submenu, and choose one of the defined formats. The filter will appear below the text box and will be combined with whatever other filters you have on the stack. Hover the mouse over the filter widget to see details on allowed sets and banned cards. Keep in mind that cards from other, non-listed sets may still appear in the results if they are just reprints of allowed cards.\n\nSet filters are similar to format filters except that a window will come up with a grid of checkboxes so you can select exactly which sets you would like shown. There is a checkbox at the bottom (off by default) that will allow the filter to include cards reprinted in unselected sets, just like the format filter above. If you don't check this checkbox, only cards printed in the selected sets will be shown, allowing you to focus on just that set's version of a particular card. This is very useful in quest mode when determining which cards in a set you have yet to collect.\n\nValue range filters allow you to restrict the cards by power, toughness, and/or converted mana cost (CMC). The text boxes that appear in the filter widget are editable and update the shown cards in realtime as you modify the numbers.\n\nQuest World filters are similar to Format filters in that they restrict the shown cards to a group of sets, respecting lists of banned cards. They are useful when constructing decks that will be valid in the various quest worlds. You can have more than one quest world filter active at the same time; useful if you are constructing a deck that will be used in multiple worlds.\n\nSPELL SHOP\n\nThe spell shop interface has also received some usability enhancements. The first one you may notice is the addition of a new column named \"Owned\". This column is intended to help players decide whether buying an item is likely to be beneficial. The data in this column varies depending on what kind of item the row represents:\n\nCards: A number indicating how many of a particular card a player already owns\n\nPreconstructed decks: A \"YES\" or \"NO\" indicating whether the deck exists in the player's deck list\n\nBooster/fat packs: A percentage indicating how close a player is to completing the related set. \"Complete\" means at least one of every basic land and at least 4 of every other card.\n\nIf you don't want this column, it can be turned off in the editor preferences.\n\nThe new \"Sell excess cards\" button appears above the player's library. Clicking it will sell all cards that are not basic lands until only four copies of the cards remain. It's a one-click \"cleanup\" of the library and a great way to safely and quickly regain some cash.\n\nThe \"Full catalog view\" button appears to the left of the \"Buy Card\" button. Toggling this button will switch between showing the store's inventory and the full catalog. By applying a filter to show only a particular set (or group of sets), players can use this view to discover exactly which cards they do not own. Buying and selling cards is disabled while in this view.\n\nMultibuy: By selecting any number of items and hitting space (or selecting the \"Buy Card\" or \"Sell Card\" buttons), a player can buy one of everything selected.\n\nFind-as-you-type is now implemented for Deck Editor tables. Just start typing while the table has focus and the next card with a matching string in its name will be highlighted. If more than one card matches, hit Enter to select the next matching card. A popup panel will appear with the search string so you know what you are searching for. If no cards match the string, the string will be highlighted in red. Normally, if you hit the spacebar while a card is selected in one table, the card will be moved to the other table (catalog/deck). When the popup is displayed, space characters are interpreted as part of the search string. Find-as-you-type mode is automatically exited after 5 seconds of inactivity, or hit Escape to exit find-as-you-type mode immediately.\n\nThe Deck Editor has also gained some hotkey and context menu abilities. R-click on a card (or a group of selected cards) for a list of actions and keyboard shortcuts. In particular, you can now transfer cards 4 at a time using the keyboard and interact with the sideboard from anywhere. Also remember that you can jump to the other table with the arrow keys and jump to the text filter with ctrl/cmd+f. From the text filter, you can jump down to the tables by pressing enter.\n\nThe Game Log:\n\n-------------\n\nAdded a 'copy to clipboard' button on WinLose screen so players can easily copy the game log.\n\nThe UI is more keyboard-friendly:\n\n---------------------------------\n\nWork was also done on making the UI more keyboard-friendly. For example, the OK button should now stay focused during matches, so you can advance through the stages by hitting Enter without having to go over and click the button all the time. If you find the button is losing focus, please report it as a bug.\n\nGatecrash Guild Sealed game mode:\n\n---------------------------------\n\nGatecrash Guild Sealed game mode has been added. To use it, start a new Sealed Mode Game, select \"Block / Set\" and \"Gatecrash Guild Sealed\". Select the first (default) configuration in the \"Choose Set Combination\" dialog, and when asked to pick your boosters, choose the guild you want twice (once for the guild-specific booster, and then for the extra promo cards).\n\nThe following cards are not included in the guild boosters of this game mode because they are not currently implemented in Forge: Bane Alley Broker, Bioshift, Killing Glare, Simic Manipulator.\n\nNew User Preferences:\n\n---------------------\n\nThe display of clones and copied cards is now a matter of user preference. A user to now choose whether a clone/copied card should use its native artwork or the artwork of the card being cloned. So if Infinite Reflection is played and the \"Clones use original card art\" preference is checked, the cards that become copies of the enchanted card will still use their own art whereas by default they would all use the card art from the enchanted card.\n\nFlippable Cards:\n\n----------------\n\nFlippable cards -- cards that have an alternate card printed upside-down at the bottom -- will now flip their appearance on the battlefield when in a flipped state. They are now also flippable in the card viewer by clicking on the card image, just like double-sided \"transform\" cards have been. When flipped this way, the details of the flipped side can be examined in the Card Details oracle text.\n\nHigh Quality Booster Pictures:\n\n------------------------------\n\nForge will now download high quality booster pictures. If you are interested in these high quality booster pictures, then you should delete the pictures that are found in your <cacheDir>/pics/boosters/ directory. Then download the new pictures by using the Home View -> Game Settings -> Content Downloaders -> Download Quest Images button.\n\nFlip, Transform and Morph cards:\n\n--------------------------------\n\nWhen you mouse over a flip, transform or Morph (controlled by you) card in battlefield, you may hold SHIFT to see other state of that card at the side panel that displays card picture and details.\n\nAlternate sound system:\n\n-----------------------\n\nImplemented an alternative sound system for people who have issues with sound gradually or instantly disappearing on certain Linux systems. Can be switched on/off in the preferences without needing a restart. Uses the standard Java Sound API so it doesn't require an external dependency. It's non-caching and, as such, less efficient than the regular sound system, so only use it in case you have issues with the default system, otherwise leave the option unchecked.\n\nHuman vs Human play over the internet:\n\n--------------------------------------\n\nSome initial code has been added that will at some point in the future allow human vs human play over the internet. This is a work in progress and is far from being implemented at this time. Please be patient. Anyone who is curious can read the messages in the http://www.slightlymagic.net/forum/viewtopic.php?f=52&t=9837 topic.\n\nRandom Deck generation:\n\n-----------------------\n\nDeck generation is now strictly conforming the colors chosen. You won't get any Boros Reckoner in a RG deck, that could be added before the change (because its manacost could be paid with red mana). Avacyn's Piligrim won't be added in a deck that has green but doesn't have white, though it does not consume, but produces white mana. As well there won't be added any creatures whose activated abilities require colors not choosen for a given deck. That is to say that now color identity is used for deck generation, that allows a better filtering of cards.\n\nSingle declare attackers step:\n\n------------------------------\n\nCombined declare attackers step for all Defending Players/Planeswalkers. On declare attackers step you have to click the entiry you are about to attack and then click on the creatures that should attack it. Clicking on a planeswalker or player visually highlights it, so that you will see whos attackers are assigned at the moment. By default your first opponent is pre-selected.\n\nBooster slots:\n\n--------------\n\nBooster slots are now way more customizable. This change allows us to implement DGM boosters correctly. Note that custom cube .draft and .sealed files have changed their format. They require a booster description instead of Num(Rarity) N lines. Find example records in files describing SkieraCube and Juzamjedi cude coming with Forge. Singleton parameter is obsolette, since all cards within a booster slot are unique. Ignore rarity is also deprecated, for Booster options allow you to pick cards regardless of rarity with 'any' word standing for ignored rarity. (ex: 15 Any)\n\nQuest challenge start in play cards:\n\n------------------------------------\n\nWe have received reports that the quest challenge start in play cards are not appearing on the battlefield for people who were playing the classic mode rather than the fantasy mode. This should now be fixed.\n\nCommander:\n\n----------\n\nWe are taking baby steps toward Commander but there are some hurdles left before we get there. We need to implement the replacement effect that moves the commander back to your command zone; the cost-changing depending on how many times you've cast your commander; generating colorless mana if you try to generate mana outside your commanders color identity and AI for all the above.\n\nCustomize your Sealed Deck games with fantasy blocks:\n\n-----------------------------------------------------\n\nWe have an informative topic at CCGH which explains how you can create \"fantasy blocks\" and the greatly increased flexibility you have when you are building your own blocks. Please see the topic http://www.slightlymagic.net/forum/viewtopic.php?f=26&t=8164 for more information. Also note that the syntax was recently changed, see message http://www.slightlymagic.net/forum/viewtopic.php?f=26&t=8164&view=unread#p117389 for additional information.\n\nCustom Cube:\n\n------------\n\n1. You can create and save your cube as a constructed deck. Place the .dck file in the /res/cube directory.\n\n2. To create a description file in the /res/draft folder you need to make a copy of any existing *.draft file and the adjust the deckfile and booster structure to meet your needs.\n\nThis file format is outdated. \"NumCards\" is no longer used. Instead there should be a line describing a booster.\n\nFind some examples below:\n\nBooster: 1 Rare, 11 Common, 3 Uncommon\n\nBooster: 5 Common, 5 Uncommon, 5 Rare, 1 Mythic\n\nBooster: 16 Any\n\nBooster: 10 Common, 3 Uncommon, 1 RareMythic, 1 BasicLand\n\nBlank screen when starting a match:\n\n-----------------------------------\n\nThis problem should be fixed. At least you'll see an exception/crash report describing why the match didn't start instead of a blank screen.\n\nDuplicate triggers problem solved:\n\n----------------------------------\n\nThis problem has now been fixed. (Mana Vortex required 2 lands, Emrakul gave 2 extra turns, Empty the Warrens creatures two Storm triggers instead of one.)\n\nConstructed mode AI vs AI matches:\n\n----------------------------------\n\nAdded support for AI vs AI matches. There is a checkbox which allows you to view the AI vs AI match. This is a work in progress and is not finished. While it appears to work OK there is still a need for a few UI changes. Please be patient. These AI vs AI matches will not be a good way to test out various deck types against one another as the AI does not understand card combos and the AI is still limited at this time.\n\nConstructed mode Human vs Human Hotseat matches:\n\n------------------------------------------------\n\nHotseat matches are now possible. This mode has some known bugs to fix. At this time both players must use the same computer. Human vs Human matches via the internet is planned and should become available sometime in the future. Please be patient.\n\nUsing predetermined decks in quest mode Challenges:\n\n---------------------------------------------------\n\nAdded the capability to play Challenges vs predetermined decks (along with a few other related options to disallow specific quest mode things). Added Sorin vs Tibalt, and Tibalt vs Sorin as examples of Challenges that force you to use a specific Deck. (They seemed to be the best duel deck compatibility for the AI).\n\nTargeting Overlay:\n\n------------------\n\nTargeting arrows will now be shown for equipments equipping permanents currently under opponent's control (for those rare cases when e.g. an equipped creature gets Switcheroo'd for something else).\n\nThe AI Drafting has been improved:\n\n----------------------------------\n\nThe AI evaluated the basic lands higher than anything else. Fixed. The AI would pick cards with RemAIDeck but only at a much lowered pick rate. For example the best pick in a 250 card set would become the 75th best pick, the 20th best pick would become the 95th and so on. Divided this factor by 3 (so the first pick would become the 25th pick). Please test whether this has improved the draft experience.\n\nPlanechase AI:\n\n--------------\n\nThis version of Forge includes basic support for AI opponents making use of the planar die in Planechase game mode. The AI will be able to use the \"Roll the planar die\" ability for most of the planes currently supported by Forge. Please note that this AI is currently in its infant stage, so don't expect it to utilize the planar die in a very smart fashion.\n\nAdding additional opponent decks to your /res/quest/duels/ directory:\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nSome people are adding additional opponent decks to their /res/quest/duels/ directory in an attempt to increase the number of opponents they will face while playing a quest.\n\nThe decks located in your /res/quest/duels/ directory are text files that have a file extension of \".dck\" rather than the file extension \".txt\". These deck files can be loaded into a basic text editor. You can view the contents of the deck files this way.\n\nThere is a metadata line for the deck's difficulty setting. Normal decks do not contain this metadata line for the deck's difficulty setting. Starting with Forge version 1.4.3 any deck file that does not include the deck's difficulty setting will be automatically assigned a value of \"medium\".\n\nYou can add a line for the deck's difficulty setting using a text editor and then saving the deck file. Currently, Forge will recognize the following settings:\n\nDifficulty=easy\n\nDifficulty=medium\n\nDifficulty=hard\n\nDifficulty=very hard\n\nAt the start of a new quest you will only face opponent decks that have an easy difficulty setting. After you have won a number of matches you will then face the opponent decks that have a medium difficulty setting. After you have won an additional number of matches you will then face the opponent decks that have a hard difficulty setting. Opponent decks that have a very hard difficulty setting may occassionally appear as a possible opponent instead of a opponent deck that has a hard difficulty setting.\n\n- version 1.4.4 -\n\nWe were not able to release version 1.4.4 and are releasing 1.4.5 instead. Enjoy.\n\n- Deck Editor and General UI improvements -\n\nYou can now right-click on a color filter button to show only cards of that color, filtering out all other colors. Similar with card type filter buttons.\n\nCan double click row for deck to open it (in addition to clicking edit icon)\n\nThe selected tab on each draggable pane will now be remembered between sessions\n\nFixed bug where hover effect didn't work the first time hovering over a row that had just been deselected\n\nFixed bug where middle and right clicking buttons did the same behavior as left clicking, and fixed bug where clicking multiple buttons quickly (such as filters) while moving the mouse around would result in clicks not registering sometimes.\n\nFixed so cards are \"selected\" on mouse up instead of mouse down, allowing things like drag drop and zoom to work if the card is currently actionable\n\nFixed so, after dragging a pane tab to a new location, the pane it was in before selects its most recent remaining tab instead of being blank\n\n- Card Zoomer -\n\nNow you can gaze at your HQ images in all their glory with just a flick of the mousewheel, holding the middle mouse button down, or holding the left and right mouse buttons down at the same time. This feature will also increase the size of low quality pics up to the size used for high quality pics, but the image will not be very clear.\n\nInstructions:\n\n- Works on any card image in the Deck Editor or Duel screen.\n\n- Move your mouse over the card you want to zoom and mouse-wheel forward.\n\n- Mouse-wheel back, mouse click or pressing ESC closes the zoomed image.\n\nLimitations:\n\n- Only works with the mouse wheel at the moment.\n\n- Does not show the other side of double-sided cards yet.\n\nWIP:\n\n- Press and hold the CTRL key while mousing over a card to see zoomed image.\n\n- Flipping double-sided card.\n\n- Preferences updates -\n\nAll reset buttons now appear under Troubleshooting section. Increased visibility of Troubleshooting section by moving to the top of the preferences screen. Added confirmation dialogs to all reset buttons.\n\nConverted Skins list to themed combo and added to new Visual Themes section. Converted AI Profile list to themed combo and moved to top of GamePlay section. New Visual Themes setting to hide or show background image on match screen. Default show.\n\nThese new themed combo boxes when used with a theme which uses white colored text will cause readability problems for people using Mac OS X. A new \"Themed ComboBox\" setting is now available in the preferences section which will enable/disable themed combos should you be having readability problems with the new themed combo used in the preferences page.\n\n- Window size/position now remembered between sessions -\n\nWorks with multiple monitors.\n\nRemembers whether the window was maximized or un-maximized.\n\nThe first time you launch Forge after this update, the window will be maximized on default monitor, with 800x600 centered being used if you un-maximize. This matches how it worked before.\n\nRemembers last un-maximized size even if the window is currently maximized such that, if you un-maximize the window, it will restore to that size at the center of the current monitor.\n\nWindow will be made accessible even if monitor setup or screen resolution is different between sessions.\n\n- Card Zoomer Updates -\n\nThe Card Zoomer/Preview now supports split, flip and double-sided cards including cards played face down (eg. morph).\n\nSplit cards (name contains \"//\") are now rotated 90 degrees for easier viewing.\n\nIf a card is a flip- or double-sided card then you can easily view the alternate image using...\n\n- wheel mode : flick wheel forward or tap CTRL key.\n\n- button mode : tap CTRL key.\n\nThe standard flip graphic (the two rotated arrows) is displayed if the card can be flipped or transformed.\n\n- Home Screen UI Improvements -\n\nThe menu on the Home Screen is now scrollable using either a mouse wheel or arrow buttons that will appear at the top or bottom if scrolling can occur in that direction\n\nThe Deck Editor and Exit Forge buttons are now laid out vertically to make it easier to add launch buttons for new screens coming down the pipeline (hint, hint...)\n\nThe menu on the Home Screen has been made narrower and the logo size increased to decrease whitespace and increase the width of the main panel\n\nRelease notes added to Games Settings section.\n\n- User Preferences -\n\nThere's a new user preference that lets you choose whether a 0-cost block should prompt you to pay or to pay it automatically. This only affects blocking situations where you would have to actually pay 0, (e.g. War Cadence with X = 0). By default you'll be prompted for payment, allowing you to, for instance, prevent forced blocks by activating War Cadence for 0 then not paying the block cost.\n\n- Match and Deck Editor Layout problems -\n\nThe match and deck editor windows contain panels that can be moved and/or resized. The changes that you make are saved to files that are named \"editor.xml\" and \"match.xml\". These files can be found in your userDir/preferences/ directory.\n\nSometimes people will decide that they do not like the changes that they made and wish to go back to the original layout. To reset layouts to default, go to the Game Settings -> Preferences -> Troubleshooting section. You will find at this location two buttons that will reset the match layout and the deck editor layouts.\n\nAlso use the mentioned measure if your match or deckeditor won't start - it would help in 90% of the cases.\n\n- Constructed Mode decks can now be stored in subfolders -\n\nThe feature is half-complete now. Forge can read subfolders in constructed deck, you may start game with such deck, but cannot yet edit decks in subfolders nor manipulate subfolders.\n\n=== Forge now has a Menubar ===\n\n- Toggle visibility using the F1 key.\n\n- The Forge menu contains Exit and Restart options.\n\n- The Layout menu contains the selector for the various themes and a Set Window Size option.\n\n- The Help menu contains links to online articles and the local TXT files.\n\n=== Duel/Match Screen Changes ===\n\n- Fixed: Concede is prevented during the declare blockers step.\n\n== Menubar Changes ==\n\n- Migration of Dock and DevMode options into Menubar.\n\n- Toggle console tabs visibility.\n\n- Toggle background image.\n\n- Toggle sound effects.\n\n== Game Log Console ==\n\n- Scrollbar is now hidden by default. Click console to toggle visibility.\n\n== Prompt Console ==\n\n- Fixed: Prevent buttons from disappearing off screen as the console size is decreased.\n\n== Card Preview Console ==\n\n- Fixed: now adheres to Scale Image Larger setting.\n\n=== General GUI ===\n\n== Themes ==\n\n- Combo-box style should now be appear correctly on Mac OS.\n\n- Commander -\n\nThe Commander gaming mode has been added and is located in the Variant view. This is a work in progress and is not finished at this time. You are invited to play test this variant.\n\n- Switch Theme/Skin Without Restart -\n\nYou can now switch between themes/skins from any screen without restarting, using either Layout > Theme on main menu or combo box on Preferences page of Home screen\n\n- Card Overlays -\n\nCard overlays can be switched on/off during a match via the Game menu. Added new card id overlay. Overlays are now always displayed regardless of card image size (if switched on).\n\n- Theros cards -\n\nForge now includes most of the new Theros cards. It may take a few days before these new card pictures become available for downloading via the \"Download LQ Card Pictures\" button. The LQ set pictures tend to take a few more weeks to process before they become available for downloading via the \"Download LQ Set Pictures\" button. Please be patient.\n\n- Forge freezing during a match bug -\n\nA number of people have reported this bug and we now feel that it may have been fixed in this version. Please play test this version and let us know.\n\n- Skinned titlebar for main window -\n\nTitlebar is now skinned instead of displaying using standard OS window titlebar\n\nMaximizing window now displays full-screen\n\nCan use Layout > View > Titlebar (F11) to toggle visibility of titlebar (will also open full-screen if hiding titlebar)\n\n- Draft fixes -\n\nDraft Deck Editor will now automatically open after finishing and naming a draft.\n\nFixed bug where switching away from a Draft and back would lose your picks.\n\nFixed bug where Draft tab remained open after finishing a draft and would crash if clicked at that point or another draft started.\n\nPrevented canceling naming a draft, which would cause a crash.\n\n- ComboBox visual tweaks -\n\nStandardized appearance of combo boxes.\n\nRemoved separation between text and drop down glyph.\n\nFixed combo boxes on Constructed home screen to update properly when skin switched.\n\n- Navigation tabs -\n\nForge now display navigation tabs in the titlebar and supports switching screens without closing them.\n\nBy default, Home and Deck Editor are available as tabs, with another closable tab added for any game you start.\n\nX button in upper right can now exit Forge rather than closing the current screen and going back to Home screen, depending on user preference.\n\nTo concede the current game, you can use the X button in the Game tab itself, and you will now be prompted for confirmation.\n\nDeck Editor and Exit Forge buttons have been removed from the Home screen since they're both accessible on the titlebar.\n\n- The X button in the upper right corner -\n\nThe first time you click the X button in the upper right, you'll be given the choice between the old behavior of closing the current screen and returning to the Home screen (which matches what the X button on each navigation tab does) or exiting Forge if already on the Home screen, or the alternative behavior of exiting Forge regardless of the current screen. Your choice will be remembered so you won't be prompted again, though you can change this setting at any time in preferences. This way, whether you like the old behavior or expect that X button to exit the application, you'll be able to have it work that way.\n\nAlso keep in mind that even if you choose to have that X button work like before, the tabs will remain available for switching screens without closing them.\n\n- True Full Screen support -\n\nFull Screen is now toggled using F11 and has its own button on the title bar.\n\nMaximize will no longer pretend to be Full Screen by covering up the taskbar.\n\nWhen in Full Screen mode, the titlebar will be hidden unless you move the mouse to the top of the screen.\n\nA \"Lock/Unlock\" Title Bar button will be available in Full Screen mode to toggle whether the title bar should remain visible at all times.\n\nWhen in Full Screen mode, a clock will appear to the left of the \"Lock/Unlock Title Bar\" button.\n\nThe title bar will appear on top of other components if not locked rather than pushing anything down.\n\nThe title bar will remain visible while accessing the Forge menu.\n\n- Window fixes -\n\nMinimize no longer crashes on Mac.\n\nMessage and Input dialogs now appear properly centered and on top of main Forge window.\n\nPrompt to save in Deck Editor (if unsaved changes) when using Forge > Restart.\n\n- Introducing the Forge button -\n\nThe old menu bar has been removed.\n\nThe Forge button on the left side of the titlebar will drop down the same menu of options.\n\nThe Alt and Menu keys will also open this menu (even if the titlebar is hidden), with full keyboard navigation of the menus then possible.\n\nThe titlebar, minimize, maximize, and close buttons have all been increased in height to make room for the Forge button.\n\nMenu items have been increased in height to make them more touch screen friendly. They also now enforce a minimum 100px width.\n\nF1 has been changed to launch the Forge wiki since it no longer needs to toggle menu bar visibility.\n\n- Forge now requires Java 7 -\n\nPlease update your Java runtime environment. At this point Forge versions 1.4.2 and above will no longer run under Java 6. Those who are using Mac OS should install the JDK version rather than the JRE version.\n\n- The Mac OS X application -\n\nAt this time Forge now requires Java 7 and will no longer run under Java 6.\n\nUnfortunately, the Mac OS X builder that we were using does not support Java 7. We hope to find and to use a different Mac OS X builder in order to continue releasing a Mac OS bundled application like we have in the past.\n\nCurrently, the windows/unix release of Forge includes a launcher file named \"forge.command\". Double click on the \"forge.command\" launcher command file and this will in turn launch the Forge jar file via the terminal application while increasing the Java heap space. This should be a temporary inconvenience.\n\n- Preferences -\n\nIf hide tabs setting on, still show tabs for panes with multiple tabs.\n\nAdd setting for Compact Prompt, which hides prompt header and reduces font size to allow the prompt to be smaller in your custom layout.\n\n- Select abilities using context menu -\n\nInstead of displaying a dialog to select abilities, you'll now get a context menu when left or right clicking cards with multiple ability choices.\n\nEach ability will have a keyboard shortcut of 1-9 based on order.\n\nUnplayable activated abilities will still appear disabled so shortcuts are constant regardless of game state.\n\n- Mana symbols shown in Card Detail and ability menu -\n\nThe Card Detail pane now shows mana symbols in place of WUBRG and other appropriate text characters.\n\nSame for ability context menu described above and Game Prompt pane.\n\nAlso fixed WUBRG of colored mana symbols on a few dozen cards.\n\nReminder text now appears in italics, with a preference that can be set to hide it.\n\n- Quest mode bazaar -\n\nAdded a new Quest Item, Charm of Vigor. Let's you play best of 5 games rather than best of 3.\n\n- Game usability/speed improvements -\n\nWhen paying mana costs, you can now press Enter/Spacebar or click the Auto button in the Prompt to automatically pay the mana cost using available mana sources if possible.\n\n- The Auto button will be disabled if you cannot pay the mana cost at that time, in which case Enter/Spacebar will cancel the spell/ability instead.\n\n- Uses the same logic the AI uses to pay mana costs. This means it will try to use mana in your pool before mana sources in play, using colorless mana to pay the colorless part of the cost if any is available.\n\n- You can still manually pay the cost by clicking mana sources in play (e.g. lands) or clicking symbols in your mana pool, which might be a good idea if you want to save specific mana sources for a later play that turn.\n\nYou can now press Ctrl+Z to undo tapping mana sources. (currently limited to before spell cast)\n\nYou will no longer be prompted when using a \"Add one of any color\" ability to pay a colorless cost.\n\n- Note: you'll still be prompted when paying Sunburst or cards that care what colors are spent to cast it (ex. Firespout).\n\nYou can now press Escape to Cancel the current prompt even if the OK button has focus.\n\nCards will now return to the same position in your hand if you cancel while paying their mana cost or choosing targets.\n\nOptional triggered abilities now use Prompt pane for Yes/No confirmation instead of a dialog.\n\nCost-related confirmations such as \"Sacrifice CARDNAME?\" and \"Pay X Life?\" now use Prompt pane instead of a dialog.\n\nYou'll no longer be prompted for attackers if you have no creatures that can attack.\n\nYou'll no longer be prompted for blockers if you have no creatures that can block any attacking creature.\n\n- Deck Editor filtering -\n\nMulti-color cards containing a filtered color will no longer show up in catalogs.\n\nHybrid cards, split cards, and phyrexian cards will now show up so long as the card can be cast using only selected colors.\n\n- For split cards, each side of the card is checked individually, so Life // Death will appear if either {B} or {G} is selected.\n\n- Note that if the multicolor button is deselected (such that multicolor cards are filtered out), hybrid and split cards with multiple colors will still be hidden.\n\nTo improve usability, right-clicking a color filter button will now also select the multicolor button so hybrids and split cards appear by default, and so 2 color cards show up if you then left click a second color filter button.\n\n- Improved dialog appearance -\n\nMany message and confirmation dialogs now use skinned look with rounded border dialog on top of overlay.\n\n- Deck Editor usability improvements -\n\nYou can now mark a card as a favorite in the Catalog by clicking the star icon in the first column. This will default the card to sort ahead of non-favorite cards if you sort on that first column (which is now the Forge default).\n\nYou can now add or remove cards from a deck using +/- buttons that appear on either side of the quantity for each card.\n\nFilters are now available on Current Deck pane, replacing the need for the static stat labels.\n\nA new filter has been added to allow filtering on specific Converted Mana Costs (0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6+), as well as displaying the card count at each CMC.\n\nColor and Type filter buttons no longer wrap, instead growing or shrinking as needed (along with the font the count string is too long).\n\nColor and Type filter buttons can now be hidden, as well as be added from the Filters menu (formally \"Add filter\").\n\nThe Total stat label has been removed in favor of showing a caption and (# SHOWN/# AVAILBLE) ratio above the table. The caption is \"Catalog\" for the Catalog pane, and the deck name for the \"Current Deck\" pane.\n\nCheckboxes are now available for each filter type, allowing that filter to be disabled and re-enabled without losing the configuration of that filter (such as chosen sets).\n\nAdding a filter for formats, sets, and quest worlds now merges into existing filters of that type if possible to apply OR logic, rather than both appearing as separate filters with AND logic applied, likely resulting in no results.\n\nPressing Ctrl+Enter to add a filter for the current search now adds another editable search bar rather than just a label.\n\nCards added to deck are now selected, even if multiple are added at once. The performance of adding and removing multiple cards at once has also been improved.\n\nWhen some but not all copies of a selected card are removed from the deck, that card now remains selected in the case of multiple cards being selected.\n\n- Two quick bug fixes -\n\nFixed an easily reproducible crash that would cause the game to become unplayable if you accidentally tried to cast a card or play a land that you couldn't play at that time.\n\nFixed a crash that would occur at times when moving your mouse over the tables in deck editors.\n\n- Memory usage optimizations -\n\nComponents are no longer cached in memory for skinning purposes, which used to prevent some components from ever being cleared from memory.\n\nCard images are now cleared from memory cache when switching screens and between games."
