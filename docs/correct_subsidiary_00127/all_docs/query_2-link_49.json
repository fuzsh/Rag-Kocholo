        "text": "Today is a day that warrants a BIG SHOUTOUT to Atlassian's Team Anywhere program! My son starts kindergarten in few months but has a camp-style orientation this week so that he can familiarize himself with his soon-to-be teachers, physical classroom, etc. It's a very thoughtful way to approach kindergarten but, of course, there's a catch: it's a morning-only orientation so I have to collect him in the late-morning and then bring him to his regular pre-school for the rest of the day. In an office-based world, I probably could have pulled this off but it would have been awkward and required all kinds of one-off conversations. In our Team Anywhere world, however, I flexibly took what otherwise would have been my lunch-hour to get him from one school to the other. Easy. Flexible. Done. GO TEAM! HUGE SHOUT to Annie Dean, Alexandra Laird, Liz Fosslien, Miriam Romaniuk, Molly Sands, PhD, Zachary Parris and everyone else at Atlassian looking after Team Anywhere!"
