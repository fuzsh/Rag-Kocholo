I don't think there is a free or open source version\n\nThere are also plans by Microsoft and Nokia to have Silverlight on Symbian Devices\n\nA quick google tells me the answer is \"no\". http://www.allaboutsymbian.com/forum/archive/index.php/t-11171.html\n\nApparently there was a company called AppForge that created a product that allowed compiling C# into Symbian apps. After Oracle acquired them, it appears that this product is defunct."
