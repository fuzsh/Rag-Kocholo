Report data was selected from mainframe data warehouses and stored in local DB2 data marts where it could be accessed by client applications. JDBC drivers were used as the transport mechanism.\n\nMay 1998 to May 2000\n\nBunker Hill Neighborhood Services, Concord, Missouri\n\nLEAD PROGRAMMER/ANALYST CONTRACT\n\nServed as Lead Programmer / Analyst for full life cycle project based on existing mainframe functionality.\n\nDeveloped a COM based system for tracking patient care for one of the nations largest non-profit health care providers. The system was responsible for tracking every aspect of a patients encounters at numerous provider sights. From the time a patient was registered for medical or dental treatment and throughout that treatment; including the verification of all medical procedures performed, the submission of insurance claims and the maintenance of all of the data required by the accounting department for keeping a ledger balance.\n\nExtensive use was made of the COM architecture, particularly in process and out of process servers with a strict emphasis placed on the scalability and reusability of all code modules. Extensive use of data type validation was used throughout to insure that all of the data entered into the system was accurate. Full featured error handling was implemented in the run-time as well as the development environments.\n\nResponsibilities also included advising project team leaders, writing code specifications, improving existing application frameworks, mentoring less experienced team members.\n\nDevelopment tools included VB 6.0, SQL Server, Crystal Reports, COM, COM+, ADO\n\nNovember 1997 To May 1998\n\nAlpha Dental of Missouri, Concord, Missouri\n\nPROGRAMMER / ANALYST CONTRACT\n\nWrote recommendations for the development of a class library and application framework in Visual Basic 5.0 to implement a means for editing business rules associated with a claims processing and management system.\n\nRe-designed and coded a dental insurance claims processing application that automated most of the tasks required for the adjudication of claims. The application was created using Visual Basic 5.0 and the Attachmate s Corp. terminal emulation package.\n\nThe core application included a batch process for inputting new claims documents into the DDPMO system and managed concurrent, fully automated, claims processing sessions that could adjudicate up to several hundred claims per hour.\n\nParticipated in the evaluation of third party vendor s products for processing medical claims that could be customized for use at Alpha.\n\nJanuary 1994 to October 1997\n\nConcord / Chicago\n\nCONSULTANT\n\nPROGRAMMER / ANALYST @ Emerson Electric\n\nRedeveloped three human resources database applications. Two were originally created in DB IV for the MS-DOS platform. The third was an extension of a FoxPro 3.0 Equal Employment Opportunity application used by the U.S. Government to maintain and assure that companies are meeting their EEO requirements by listing the number of employees working in different job categories by race and gender.\n\nMBA application - The core functionality tracked a potential new employee s progress through Emerson s human resources department interview and evaluation process. All candidates were categorized as to their skills, assessments made during successive interviews, their availability, and the actions taken by Emerson during the recruiting process. Reports were generated based on these categories.\n\nTasks included importing the old data files into a new MS Access95 database, defining table relationships and queries necessary for the applications user interface to be effective. Enhancements included a synchronized list of available job candidates whose record with Emerson s human resources department could be selected for editing or review. Attributes used to distinguish between the categories were outdated and needed to be changed without destroying the integrity of the data. Since each record had to be evaluated and updated to the new attribute by someone in the human resources department changes had to be made to each record on-line. Reports could be selected by the old attribute as long as they existed and the new attribute until all of the records were updated, as well as by a combination of new and old attributes.\n\nNameplate Application - The core functionality maintained a database of Emerson s executive employees around the world, their length of tenure, number of job assignments foreign and domestic and the classification of their job within the corporation. The application could also generate a printed graphic of how their desktop nameplate would appear.\n\nEEO-1 - Analyzed, designed and coded an enhanced version of the EEO-1 application using MS Access 95 to duplicate and enhance the U.S. Governments version which is sent to Emerson yearly on floppy disk, completed by Emerson s human resources department and returned to the government in a timely manner. The EEO-1 application was designed to import the data table sent to the government, review the data and group the data in a way more consistent with the corporate structure and geographic location of Emerson s individual companies. The application also maintained data longer than one year for more thorough analysis.\n\nTasks included developing a user interface for selecting data tables to be imported and transforming the raw data into records that would meet Emerson s extended requirements. Those requirements included totals by Business Leader, Company, State or Corporation where the govt. only considered individual companies . This mandated creating a Corporate / Business Leader / Company hierarchical structure which could be edited, recreated, and maintained in separate tables for different years or adhoc analysis.\n\nSENIOR PROGRAMMER ANALYST @ Dimac Direct\n\nDesigned, coded and implemented Multidimensional Data Analysis [MDA] tools using Visual Basic and MS Office to provide all of the data access objects necessary to view, store, and analyze the information needed for maintaining a yearly budget by the accounting department. The tools also provide core functionality to in-house business processes.\n\nDesigned and implemented a relational database management system to handle all data management capabilities associated with historic and current budgetary projection input by management.\n\nMaintained and provided integrated database functionality and general user-requested enhancements to Electronic-Forms used by vital departments for day to day operations of the company including tracking inter-departmental messages and maintaining the integrity of those communications by saving records of all related activity.\n\nPRGRAMMER / ANALYST @ Shell Woodriver Refinery\n\nCreate and implement a Visual Basic 3.0 application to import text files into an ACCESS 2.0 database used for populating spreadsheets; then automate the repetitive tasks associated with the rapid calculation of financial projections and performance analysis. The general tasks included implementing data exchange, through OLE Automation., for the creation of complex spreadsheets to support monthly MS PowerPoint presentations.\n\nPROGRAMMER / ANALYST @ Application Design Group\n\nSetup and administer Workgroup Post Offices and implement custom designed Electronic Forms to integrate in- house processes for a Concord based publishing firm. The E-Forms were designed and coded using Visual Basic 3.0 and the Microsoft Office Developers Kit. The departments that were targeted included , the customer service dept. for transaction processing of electronic catalog orders, the composition departments responsible for creating new items for the catalog, and the mail plant responsible for shipping and handling.\n\nProvide a means of managing information related to technical service request calls by integrating an MS Mail enabled application written in Visual Basic 3.0 to route help desk requests with an MS Access database. Each request included the data found in the AUTOEXEC.BAT, WIN.INI , and SYSTEM.INI of the workstation requesting help. The database was also designed with MS Mail processing capabilities to log each help desk request, assign the task to an available representative, and track the resources used to maintain the request.\n\nMentored and recommended Visual Basic coding techniques that was to be used to re-design, debug and improve a client/server Electronic Catalog for the Customer Service department. These recommendations were aimed at de-normalizing the data contained in the Access 2.0 database , delivering timely record processing and visual display of large records, and greatly reducing the amount of system resources needed by each workstation to effectively use the application.\n\nPROGRAMMER / ANALYST @ Software Studios\n\nWorked as part of a team implementing and debugging modules of an Image Processing Application written in VB 3.0 and used for viewing and annotating large batches of scanned documents. All of the documents were sorted and stored on file servers according to classifications that were bar-coded into the document. When a document or batch of documents is requested by a workstation the batches are cached first on the application server and then sent to the workstation. Thereby improving workstation performance by reducing the number of calls from the workstation to the server necessary to maintain the workstations view of the data.\n\nPROGRAMMER / ANALYST @ Open Systems Group\n\nPart of a team designing and testing a prototype utility used for managing large integrated relational database systems. The application was coded using VB 3.0 and relied on ODBC connectivity to encompass data access from a wide range of database objects. The functionality of the program provided for establishing data access for users over WAN, LAN, and Enterprise Mail Systems to exclusive data from individuals and dynamic groups for business and related projects.\n\nPart of a team designing and testing a prototype Web-Site for a large St.Louis based electrical contractor. Combining HTML with Microsoft Word 6.0 custom document templates produced a method for re-creating the standard business documents already on file servers into WEB compliant documents that could be viewed with standard browsers.\n\nDesigned and documented a server based installation for 500 Windows 95 workstations being implemented at 35 distribution sites. The Windows 95 setup was run from a custom script based on the MSBATCH.INF format. The setup was initialized from a Network Bootable Floppy Disk on computers with formatted hard drives and no operating system installed. MS-DOS 6.22, Windows 95 and Microsoft Office 95 software were all installed and configured from the Windows NT server. WINS and DHCP were the mechanisms used to establish the IP addresses needed for TCP/IP network protocol.\n\nPROGRAMMER / ANALYST @ J.C. Penney Catalog Center\n\nCreated a customer service GUI using Visual Basic 3.0 and Microsoft Access. The interface was modeled from an IBM Mainframe terminal emulation application that was already in place and was used to define the specifications for a PC based customer service department. The application centered on the need for transaction processing and data replication that would meet the heavy demands of J.C. Penney. The migration to PC s was dedicated to providing greater capability to each customer service representative who would then have immediate access to more data than the mainframe alone could profitably provide.\n\nPROGRAMMER / ANALYST - INDEPENDENT CONSULTING\n\nWrote interactive software programs for small business contractors and owner operators in the trucking industry. Using VB 3.0, Access and the Microsoft Office Developers Kit I customized Microsoft Workgroup Templates and Designer E-Forms to compliment software programs that were already in place at small businesses in the Chicago area. Most of the interactive software centered on timeslips for employees, work schedules and advance planning for job estimates and personal organizers for administrative tasks. OLE automation and DDE were used when applicable.\n\nTest Administered by TeckChek: Visual Basic 6 Programming - Date Taken: June 13, 2001\n\nOverall Percentile 99\n\nOverall Score in this technology is higher than 99 of the other professionals worldwide who have taken this assessment in the Complete library.\n\nOverall Percentiles for the same score will vary on different tests and are a function of the overall proficiency of all test takers for that test subject.
