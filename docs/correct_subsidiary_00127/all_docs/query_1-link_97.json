        "text": "\n\nEnable mobile data management. Our mobile data management products enable enterprises and users to access, synchronize and manage information between mobile devices and personal computers or enterprise networks. We believe enterprises can reduce their initial capital investment in computer hardware and software and their network administrative costs by using our technology to deploy applications on mobile devices. Using our products, users can manage information between their mobile devices and personal computers; enterprise groupware applications, such as Microsoft Exchange and Lotus Domino; enterprise applications, such as Siebel and SAP; or enterprise databases via LDAP, JDBC, XML data sources, and ODBC or OLEDB-compliant database connectors. In addition, enterprises can securely and efficiently deploy and manage a variety of mobile devices and extend their applications and databases across a distributed network and over the Internet.\n\n\n\nIncrease value and usage of mobile devices and communications services. Our platforms and technologies provide the tools to enable device manufacturers and application developers to design and enhance products to meet the needs of both enterprises and users. Because our technology enables cost-effective communication and the ability to easily manage many disparate devices, we believe device manufacturers and application developers are able to increase the value of the products they sell, thereby encouraging increased adoption of those products. In addition, we believe the increased adoption of mobile devices will, in turn, drive increased usage of and loyalty to providers of mobile communications services, thereby increasing service providers revenue opportunities and minimizing their costs.\n\n\n\nContinue to develop and maintain a broad array of mobile information management products, technologies and services that demonstrate our technical excellence. We are committed to building and maintaining a full range of mobile information management products, technologies, and services that address the data management and wireless connectivity needs of enterprises and users across a broad range of mobile devices. Our products support the current leading mobile device platforms, including the Palm OS, Windows CE, Symbian EPOC, RIM and SyncML-based mobile device platforms and we intend to develop additional device support in the future. Further, we are committed to designing our technology and products to be compatible with new and emerging protocols, such as GSM, GPRS, CDPD, CDMA, 1XRTT, 3G, iMode and Mobitex networks. By continuing to provide a broad range of products, we believe that we can successfully meet the mobile information needs of users and enterprises, while enhancing the ability of service providers, device manufacturers, and application developers to increase the value of their own products and services. We actively work with industry consortia to develop wireless standards and protocols. These consortia are comprised of industry leaders, device manufacturers and software developers, and we actively participate on the leading standards boards and technical committees of these consortia. For example, we were a founding member of the Infrared Data Association, which developed the IrDA protocol. As a result of our efforts in IrDA, we were invited by the founders of Bluetooth to participate in the Bluetooth early adopter group and were accepted as an associate member of the Bluetooth Special Interest Group, while contributing on the Bluetooth Architecture review board. Extended Systems is also a promoting member of the SyncML Initiative. We believe our leadership in these consortia will continue to make our mobile information management products and technologies an integral part of mobile communications solutions.\n\n\n\nFocus resources on building customer intimacy with top enterprise customers. We have invested substantial resources to develop our worldwide marketing, sales and support infrastructure. Although our products are appropriate for enterprises of all sizes, we believe large multi-national enterprises are the most lucrative market for our products. We intend to continue to focus resources to sell to large enterprises and to international markets that are adopting the use of mobile communications most rapidly. In addition, our products are currently included in or bundled with the mobile devices of industry leaders such as Ericsson, Motorola and Palm. We believe the integration of our technology in leading mobile devices provides a significant opportunity to reach the enterprises and mobile workers who are the primary users of these devices.\n\n\n\nDemonstrate industry leadership by continuing to leverage alliances with leading mobile device manufacturers and applications developers. We believe it is critical to focus on continuing to demonstrate industry leadership through alliance validation. We maintain relationships with leading hardware and software vendors, including Ericsson, Hewlett-Packard, IBM, Microsoft, Motorola, Nokia, and Symbian. We believe that these relationships will enable us to develop leading-edge products and technology and influence the development of new platforms and protocols. We also believe these relationships will continue to help us achieve broader distribution of our products and technologies, making them pervasive in the mobile information management market. For example, we collaborate with Compaq Global Services to package our XTNDConnect Server software as part of its iPAQ mobile device solution thereby enabling large enterprise customers worldwide to enhance the development of custom enterprise software applications that deliver enterprise data to mobile devices.\n\n\n\nStep 2we will perform an allocation of the fair value of the reporting unit to its identifiable tangible and non-goodwill intangible assets and liabilities. This will derive an implied fair value for the reporting units goodwill. We will then compare the implied fair value of the reporting units goodwill with the carrying amount of the reporting units goodwill. If the carrying amount of the reporting units goodwill is greater than the implied fair value of its goodwill, an impairment loss must be recognized for the excess.\n\n\n\nStep 1we will compare the fair value of our reporting units to the carrying value, including goodwill of each of those units. For each reporting unit where the carrying value, including goodwill, exceeds the units fair value, we will move on to step 2. If a units fair value exceeds the carrying value, no further work is performed and no impairment charge is necessary."
