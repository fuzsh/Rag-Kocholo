        "text": "Forger is a desktop-class 3D modeling and sculpting application for artists that want to create anywhere. Forger now pairs its award-winning sculpting toolset with the powerful polygonal modeling engine from Maxonâs venerable Cinema 4D desktop application. Forger now offers the best of both worlds in one 3D creation app: sculptingâs organic expressiveness and the exactness of hard-surface, polygonal modeling.\n\nThe new Forger includes:\n\nÂ· An intuitive multitouch interface, Apple Pencil support, draw-to-select and on-screen navigation and orientation tools gives artists an intimate, intuitive and powerful way to manifest their ideas as digital 3D creations.\n\nÂ· A full library of polygonal primitives to get started quickly, including: cube, sphere, hemisphere, platonic, cone, pyramid, disc, cylinder, tube, oiltank, capsule, and Torus.\n\nÂ· The full polygonal modeling engine and tools from Maxonâs Cinema 4D desktop solution, including Transform, Extrude, Bevel, Inset, Bridge, Line and Loop Cut and more.\n\nÂ· A desktop-class sculpting workflow and brush engine that offers the power of a Desktop sculpting application, without compromises.\n\nÂ· A large sculpting brush library: standard, clay, flatten, move, pull, smooth, pinch, inflate, crease, scrape, polish, planar, layer, stamp and mask. Each brush has an alternate function that does even more! Even use custom stamps (alphas).\n\nÂ· Professional concept sculpting - With two powerful remeshing algorithms (volume based remeshing and edge-flow topological remeshing), the ability to cap holes, slice, split and merge sub-meshes; doing concept sculpting on a mobile device is no longer a dream.\n\nÂ· Multi-resolution meshes - Increase the resolution of the model by multiplying the number of faces by four, whilst keeping the previous (coarser) version of the mesh as another sub-level. Step back and forth between levels to do big changes or work on details. Rebuild subdivision levels on previously subdivided meshes if importing from another software and carry on with Forger!\n\nÂ· Sculpt layers - Work in a non destructive manner by creating layers per sub-level for quick concepting and adjusting their intensities for different results.\n\nÂ· Advanced stylus & external keyboard support - Users can choose whether they want brushes to be affected by pressure in strength or size. Users that are used to sculpting & texturing softwares will feel at home with keyboard support, allowing them to skip the learning stage of the app due to the very commonshortcuts found in known Desktop 3D digital content creation tools.\n\nÂ· Vertex Colors - Paint your creations with per-vertex colors for presentation purposes, use this to create rough base textures or final stylized ones.\n\nÂ· Bidirectional model sharing between Forger and Maxon's Cinema 4D, winner of a Sci-Tech award from the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Science, offering the ultimate in workflow flexibility.\n\nÂ· File I/O - Save your scenes to the internal scene format and use the other popular file 3D formats to import or export new models or base meshes into your favorite 3D application."
