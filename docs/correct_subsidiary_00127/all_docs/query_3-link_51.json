        "text": "Building OpenRewrite\n\nOpenRewrite is built with Gradle. It is not typically necessary to manually install Gradle, as invoking the ./gradlew (Linux and Mac) or gradlew.bat (Windows) shell scripts will download the appropriate version of Gradle to your user directory.\n\nOpenRewrite requires several JDK versions to be installed on your system. If you are able to access Adoptium, then Gradle will automatically download and install any needed JDKs which you may be missing. If your network configuration or security policies do not permit this, then you must manually install JDK versions 8, 11, and 17.\n\nTo compile and run tests, invoke ./gradlew build. To publish a snapshot build to your maven local repository, run ./gradlew publishToMavenLocal.\n\nBuilding within Secure/Isolated environments\n\nOpenRewrite typically accesses the Maven Central artifact repository to download necessary dependencies. If organizational security policy or network configuration forbids this, then you can use a Gradle init script to forcibly reconfigure the OpenRewrite build to use a different repository.\n\nCopy this script to a file named init.gradle.kts into the /.gradle directory. Modify the enterpriseRepository value as appropriate for your situation.\n\nWith this file placed, all of your Gradle builds will prefer to use your corporate repository instead of whatever repositories they would normally be configured with.\n\nDeveloping tips\n\nWe recommend that you use IntelliJ IDEA for development, as some of the Gradle specifics in openrewrite/rewrite are not supported as well in other IDEs. We also require all code contributions to be formatted using the IntelliJ IDEA auto-formatter.\n\nIntelliJ IDEA changes\n\nSpeed up tests\n\nBy default, IntelliJ IDEA uses Gradle to build and run tests with. While that ensures compatibility, it is very slow. To help speed up compilation and testing, we recommend that you change this to use IntelliJ IDEA instead. You can update this by going to the IntelliJ settings, searching for Gradle, and clicking on the Build, Execution, Deployment -> Build Tools -> Gradle setting:\n\nAs part of doing that, you'll also need to update the Java Compiler to set the -parameters compiler flag. If your system does not have UTF-8 as its default character encoding (e.g., Windows), you must also add -encoding utf8.\n\nAdditional overrides if working on compiler internals\n\nThis will not apply to most people as a typical recipe module will not directly reference compiler internals.\n\nIf you need to reference internals of the compiler, please add an override to the compiler parameters for the rewrite.rewrite-java-17.main module to have the compilation options of:\n\nOptimizing your IDE for only modules you want to work on\n\nIf you are only working on a subset of the modules in openrewrite/rewrite, you can optimize your IDE to only load those modules. To do so, create a new IDE.properties file if one doesn't exist in the base directory of the project. Then, copy the contents of IDE.properties.tmp file to it. Next, comment out any lines that correspond to modules that you do not want to work on. This will cause Gradle to swap those project dependencies for binary dependencies resolved from either Maven local or the OSS snapshots repository â€“ which will speed up your IDE.\n\nWindows Caveats\n\nIf you are contributing to OpenRewrite on Windows, please ensure that you set core.autocrlf = false as Rewrite requires unix-style line endings. This can be done when you clone the repository:"
