        "text": "Lewis F. Allen died on May 2, 1890. He was born in Westfield, Massachusetts and went to New York City at the age of 13 to begin working for a wholesale importing and jobbing dry goods house as an apprentice. In April 1827, he came to Buffalo to serve as secretary and financial manager of the Western Ensurance Company. With him came his bride of two years, the former Margaret Cleveland, an aunt of Grover Cleveland. The Allens had six children, but only two lived to adulthood. In 1829, he bought a farm lot of 29 acres extending from Main Street to the “State Reservation line” of Black Rock. He purchased several other plots of land through auction which were later sold for significant increases in value as old wooden structures were torn and new brick buildings were constructed along with the growing city. In 1833, along with some Boston investors, Allen purchased 16,000 acres of forested land on Grand Island, New York at a cost of around $6/acre. This was practically the entire Island. Allen was the uncle of President Grover Cleveland (through marriage) and is credited with introducing Cleveland to the practice of law and politics, therefore paving the way for his eventual presidency. Mr. Allen was one of the original trustees of The Buffalo City Cemetery from 1864-67 and 1878-90, and also served as Vice President from 1886-1890. Lewis F. Allen is buried in section 5 in Forest Lawn\n\nLouise Blanchard Bethune is widely considered to be the first woman to practice as a professional architect in the United States. She participated in the design of approximately 150 buildings in the Buffalo and New England areas in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, and was also the first woman member of the American Institute of Architects (AIA) and the first woman to be honored as an AIA Fellow.\n\nShe was born in 1856 in Waterloo New York and schooled at home until age 11. Her father, Dalson Blanchard, was principal of the Waterloo Union School, where he also taught mathematics. During her childhood, Louise loved drawing and constructing models of buildings and different structures. Her family moved to Buffalo, where she graduated from high school in 1874. For the two years following, she taught, traveled, and studied, hoping to prepare herself for the architectural school at Cornell.\n\nThen, at the age of 20, she was offered a job as a draftsman in the office of the prominent Buffalo architectural and building firm of Richard A. Waite and F. W. Caulkins. She worked for them for five years as a student apprentice and assistant, mastering the techniques of drafting and architectural design.\n\nDuring her employment there Louise met a fellow student, a Canadian draftsman named Robert Armour Bethune. The couple soon opened an architectural office together in 1881. This move was timed to coincide with the Women’s Congress being held here at that time, so both of Louise’s interests intertwined.\n\nIn December of that year the couple was married, and the firm became R.A. and L. Bethune. Soon after their marriage they welcomed a son Charles W. Bethune, their only child in 1883.\n\nAs the years passed, the practice flourished, and in 1890, they added William R. Fuchs to the firm, and our name became Bethune, Bethune, and Fuchs. During this time, Louise believed that women’s complete emancipation lay in equal pay for equal service. In 1893, she refused to enter the women’s architectural design competition for the Women’s Building at the Chicago World’s Fair. She didn’t believe in competitions, and to make matters even worse, the women’s prizes were less than the men’s!\n\nIf Louise specialized in any form of architecture, it was in school buildings. She had a hand in designing 18 schools in Western New York, including Hamburg High School, Lockport High school and several grammar schools in Buffalo. Despite her interest in schools, she refused to confine myself to just one interest. She truly believed that women who are pioneers in any profession should be proficient in every department, and that women architects must be practical superintendents as well as designers and scientific constructors.\n\nIn 1898, the Bethune’s firm was invited to plan the 225-room Hotel Lafayette that was hoping to house visitors to the Pan-American Exposition. But financial problems delayed the opening until 1904. Louise worked on most of the design for the fireproof French renaissance structure.\n\nAmong the buildings designed by their firm was the beautiful terra cotta construction for Denton, Cottier & Daniels music store at Court and Pearl Streets. It was one of the first Buffalo buildings with steel-frame construction and with poured concrete slabs to resist fire. While that building is no longer there, other examples of her work still remain throughout Buffalo and Western New York such as Hamburg and Lockport High schools, the former Queen city baseball and amusement company on East Ferry and Michigan and 307 Bryant street which now houses a popular west side restaurant.\n\nLouise Blanchard Bethune died on December 18, 1913, at the age of 57, and is buried in Forest Lawn.\n\nJohn Blocher died on June 30, 1911 at the age of 86. He was born in the small town of Scipio, New York. At age 10, he became “the man of the family” following the death of his father. This left him with little formal education, but the adult responsibilities that he assumed at a young age charged him with entrepreneurial spirit. At age 18, he opened a tailoring business in Buffalo, which he soon developed into a general store, supplying ready made clothing, dry goods, and groceries to Buffalo residents. At age 20, John married Elizabeth Neff of Williamsville. The couple had one son, Nelson, who was born in 1847. John Blocher enlisted in the Union Army at the outbreak of the Civil War, and served one year in the 78th New York Regiment before being discharged for ill health. Returning to Buffalo after his stint in the Army, Blocher turned the war to his advantage and proceeded to manufacture shoes and boots for the Army. His prosperous footwear business and some shrewd real estate investments soon turned John Blocher into one of Buffalo’s wealthiest citizens. When the Blocher’s son Nelson died in 1884 at the age of 37 after a long illness, his parents decided to build a memorial in his honor. This is the iconic Blocher monument at Forest Lawn. In it are Italian marble figures of the Blochers standing beside a couch on which Nelson, is lying. The monument cost $100,000 at the time it was built (That’s nearly $3 million in today’s dollars!)\n\nDirector of the 1901 Pan American Exposition\n\nWilliam Buchanan died on October 16, 1909. Mr. Buchanan was born in Mimi County, Ohio in 1852. When he first started out in business he was the manager of Sioux City theatres. With a personal background of farm life, in 1893 he was appointed as the Columbian Exposition’s agricultural chief. In the 1890’s, based on his successes, he was appointed to diplomatic service in Buenos Aires. President William McKinley appointed him to the Mexico Conference of American States. When Buffalo leaders, led by John G. Milburn, planned an exposition with a Latin American theme, they needed someone who knew the South American countries well, as well as the temperament of its citizens. That someone was Buchanan, who was known as the “Diplomat of the Americas.” So he was named Director of the 1901 Pan American Exposition in Buffalo. Although the Exposition was a financial failure, many gave Buchanan high marks for his leadership. After the Exposition he was appointed as a roving diplomat “on call.” In 1907, President Theodore Roosevelt chose Buchanan as an envoy to Panama, which was a critical position at that time because of the Panama Canal issue. Mr. Buchanan was married to the former Lulu Williams. He lived the final years of his life on Gates Circle, only a block from his eventual burial site in Forest Lawn. William Buchanan died suddenly while on business in London. He is buried in Section H in Forest Lawn.\n\nRenowned Architect\n\nGeorge Cary, accomplished architect, died on May 5, 1945. He was one of seven children born to prominent Buffalo resident, Dr. Walter Cary and Julia Cary (née Love). He was the grandson of Trumbull Cary, a New York State Senator and Assemblyman. Mr. Cary attended and graduated from Harvard and the Columbia School of Architecture. After graduating from Columbia, he spent a brief apprenticeship with the firm of McKim, Mead and White in New York City. He then went to Paris and studied at the Ecole des Beaux-Arts from 1886 until 1889, the first Buffalonian to do so. In 1891, he returned to Buffalo and set up his architecture practice. In the mid-1890s, Cary redesigned some rooms in the Ansley Wilcox House, which later became known as the Theodore Roosevelt Inaugural National Historic Site as it was the site where Theodore Roosevelt took the oath of office as President of the United States on September 14, 1901 after the assassination of William McKinley at the Pan-American Exposition of 1901. When the Exposition came to Buffalo, Cary became one of the three local architects on the Board of Architects for the Exposition and designed the Ethnology Building and the New York State pavilion for the Pan-American Exposition. The pavilion was the only permanent building created for the Exposition and later became the Buffalo Historical Society, then the Buffalo and Erie County Historical Society, and today is the Buffalo History Museum. He also designed the Delaware Ave gate and the Administrative office at Forest Lawn in 1906-1907, the Pierce Arrow Motor Car Company Administration building on Elmwood Avenue, and many private homes. He married Allithea Birge daughter of George K and Carrie Birge. He also would design the Birge Memorial located in Forest Lawn. George Cary is buried in section F in Forest Lawn.\n\nPioneering U.S. Congresswoman\n\nShirley Chisholm was born Shirley Anita St. Hill in Brooklyn, New York. In 1949, she married Conrad Chisholm and they both participated in local politics. In 1964, she ran for and won a seat in the New York State Assembly. Four years later, she entered the U.S. Congressional race. Her slogan was “Fighting Shirley Chisholm, Unbought and Unbossed.” She won the election and became the first African American woman elected to the United States Congress. She was re-elected to a second term in 1970. She ran for president of the United States in 1972, and though she did not win the nomination, she did receive 151 delegates. She held her seat in Congress until 1982. Shirley Chisholm was a champion of the poor, veterans and voice for those less fortunate. She authored two books “Unbought and Unbossed” and “The Good Fight.” After a divorce from her first husband she married Arthur Hardwick, a Western New Yorker and former NY State Assembly member. On January 31, 2014 the United States Postal service issued the Shirley Chisholm Black Heritage forever stamp in her honor. Most recently, in November, 2015 she was awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom, which is the nation’s highest civilian honor, presented to individuals who have made especially meritorious contributions to the security or national interests of the United States, to world peace, or to cultural or other significant public or private endeavors. Shirley Chisholm is entombed in Forest Lawn’s Birchwood Mausoleum.\n\nClick here to learn more about Shirley Chisholm!\n\nMarian de Forest died on February 17, 1935 at the age of 71. She was an American journalist, playwright, a major force in the progressive women’s movement, and founder of Zonta (later Zonta International), a service organization of female professionals. A graduate the Buffalo Seminary (the youngest ever at that time), she began her career as a reporter – one of the first women in WNY in the profession. She was a critic and editor of the women’s department at the Buffalo Express for 20 years. Later, she became City Editor of the Buffalo Commercial newspaper. During the 1901 Pan-American Exposition in Buffalo, Marian served as Executive Secretary on the Board of Women Managers. In 1911, she wrote the play “Little Women: A Comedy in Four Acts.” The play is said to have launched the career of actress Katharine Cornell. Marian went on to write more plays in her career.\n\nOn November 8, 1919 at the Hotel Statler in Buffalo, she founded the Zonta Club of Buffalo to improve the status of women worldwide. She also played a major role in the founding of the Buffalo Philharmonic Orchestra, and in 1932 promoted the first POPS concert for unemployed musicians.\n\nMarian was one of the first women asked to join the writing group called the Scribbler’s, founded by Charlotte Mulligan. She was also devoted to animals, serving on the board of the SPCA for 14 years. In October, 2001, Marian de Forest was inducted into the National Women’s Hall of Fame at Seneca Falls, NY. She was the first woman from Buffalo to be so honored. She is buried in section one in Forest Lawn.\n\nCo-Founder of Wells Fargo & American Express\n\nWilliam Fargo died on August 3, 1881 at the age of 63. He was an incredibly successful entrepreneur who founded the American Express Company and Wells Fargo and Company, and also served as Mayor of Buffalo for two terms. Mr. Fargo was born in in Pompey, N.Y., the eldest of 12 children. His formal education ended at 13, when he began carrying mail over a 30-mile circuit for a local contractor. He subsequently worked in the grocery business, as a baker, and in a village inn. In 1840, he married Anna H. Williams; they had eight children, though four of them died very yound. In 1842, Fargo became a messenger for an express firm operating between Albany and Buffalo. Soon he was appointed agent of Pomeroy and Company in Buffalo. Through his association with Wells and Company (which operated the first express company west of Buffalo), Fargo became one of the founders of the American Express Company, which quickly became the largest express concern in the United States. In 1852, Fargo and some associates formed Wells, Fargo and Company to bring the services of an express company to the gold fields of California. American Express and Wells, Fargo combined facilities to provide rapid transportation of goods and communications between California, the Atlantic coast, Europe, and points in between. After an 1855 financial panic drove its most formidable rival into bankruptcy, Wells, Fargo was the dominant express company in the West, with hundreds of employees, thousands of head of stock, and hundreds of thousands of dollars in capital invested. In 1857, Fargo and some of his associates from American Express established the Overland Mail, the first transcontinental stage line. It served the west until the coming of the railroad in 1869. As an officer with the Northern Pacific Railroad, involved in the decision to bring rail to Centralia, North Dakota — after which the appreciative town changed its name to Fargo. Mr. Fargo was Mayor of Buffalo for two terms—serving 1862-1863 and 1864-1865.\n\nIn 1868, when he was 50, Fargo bought 5.5 acres on Buffalo’s west side and between 1868–1872, he built the Fargo Mansion at Jersey and Fargo Streets, which was Buffalo’s largest mansion. The home was completed in 1872 at a cost of $600,000 (equivalent to $12,805,000 in 2019). Another $100,000 (equivalent to $2,134,000 in 2019) was spent to furnish and decorate the 22,170-square-foot mansion. Michael Rizzo, a Buffalo historian, wrote: the ‘most elaborate and costly private mansion in the state,’ outside of New York City. The house took two city blocks, from Pennsylvania Avenue, West Avenue, Jersey Street, and Fargo Avenue. There was a central tower five stories high. At his request it contained wood from all the states of the Union. It was the first home in the city to contain an elevator in it, and it was said to have gold doorknobs.”\n\nWilliam Fargo is buried in section AA in Forest Lawn.\n\nSecond Wife of President Millard Fillmore\n\nCaroline Carmichael McIntosh Fillmore, second wife of 13th United States President Millard Fillmore, died on August 11, 1881 at the age of 67. She was born in Morristown, New Jersey, the daughter of Charles Carmichael and Temperance Blachley Carmichael. She married her first husband, Ezekiel C. McIntosh (1806–1855), a prosperous Troy, New York merchant and President of the Troy Schenectady Railroad in November 1832. They had no children, and McIntosh’s death at age 49 left her very wealthy. She married Millard Fillmore on February 10, 1858 in Albany, New York. At the time of their marriage, Caroline required Millard to sign a prenuptial agreement. They lived together for 16 years in a castle-like mansion at 52 Niagara Square and Delaware Avenue (the current site of the Statler Office Building). They are believed to have had a happy marriage (Caroline greatly enjoyed her newfound status as the wife of a former President), though in the 1860s her mental and physical health began to decline. Her husband’s sudden death in 1874 (he had enjoyed relatively good health—especially when compared to hers—until just shortly before his fatal stroke) only succeeded in making her more infirm, eccentric, and temperamental. Caroline survived the former president for seven years and was awarded a presidential widow’s pension privilege by Congress. In her final years, she frequently changed her will, and upon her death, suits were initiated by various members of the Fillmore family contesting her directives. Caroline Carmichael McIntosh Fillmore is buried alongside her second husband, President Millard Fillmore, his first wife Abigail, as well as Millard and Abigail’s two children in section F in Forest Lawn.\n\nSuccessful Businessman\n\nFrank Henry Goodyear died on May 13, 1907. Mr. Goodyear was the son of a country doctor, Bradley Goodyear, and grew up in Holland, NY. He came to Buffalo in 1872 at the age of 23. In 1887, Goodyear and his brother, Charles Waterhouse, started a lumber company, F. H. & C. W. Goodyear The business grew rapidly, as it pioneered the construction of standard built and equipped railroads for logging operations, penetrating the timber tracts of Pennsylvania, which had, up until that time, been inaccessible to railroads. From this beginning grew the Buffalo & Susquehanna Railroad, a line that has opened up and give complete access to an area that previously had none. Now the line became a permanent freight and passenger line, with 350 (eventually 450) miles of track. During his highly successful career, Mr. Goodyear was president of the Buffalo & Susquehanna Railroad, the steamship company and iron company of the same name, and the New Orleans Great Northern Railroad. He was also a partner in the Goodyear Lumber Company, and a director of the U.S. Leather Co. and the Marine National Bank. He made significant donations to parks of Buffalo. A project dear to his heart was a zoo for this city, which he offered to finance, but his offer was declined by our city fathers of the 1890s. Mr. Goodyear was married to the former Josephine Looney, and the couple had three daughters and a son. Frank H. Goodyear is entombed in the Goodyear family mausoleum, which is located in section 23 in Forest Lawn.\n\nOwned the land which is now Forest Lawn\n\nErastus Granger arrived in Buffalo, NY in March of 1804, having recently been appointed by President Thomas Jefferson as Indian Agent to the Seneca Nation. In 1806, he purchased property from Captain William Johnston, which is today Forest Lawn Cemetery. Prior to the War of 1812 and through the first year, Erastus Granger’s orders were to keep the Seneca’s neutral in the war with England. This he accomplished, until the Senecas declared War on the Mohawks who were allies to the British. On July 10, 1813 Granger summoned Red Jacket, the other Seneca Chiefs and warriors to his farm and prepare for battle. The next morning, the British attacked Black Rock and Granger led the Senecas in the fight to repulse them. At the Battle of Black Rock on December 23, 1813 he led them again in defending Black Rock and Buffalo. Granger then led the Seneca’s during the Niagara Campaign of 1814. Erastus Granger was a close friend and ally to Red Jacket and the Senecas. Their friendship would be written about for years to come. At the time of his death it was written that his estate consisted of almost 700 acres from Main Street to the Niagara River. Erastus Granger is buried in Section J in Forest Lawn.\n\nAccomplished Religious Leader\n\nThe Rev. Leeland Newton Jones Jr. died on August 13, 2009 at the age of 87. Born in Buffalo, he spent the first seven years of his life sleeping in the bed of his grandfather, a former slave who had fled from the South. He was student body president and captain of the football and debate teams at Technical High School and president of the student government at the University at Buffalo. He also attended UB Law School. Rev. Jones’ studies at UB were interrupted by Army service during World War II. He served stateside after becoming the only African American in his Officer Candidate School graduating class at Fort Monmouth, N. J. He served with the 15th Signal Corps Regiment, where he was a cryptograph security officer. He was a member of the famed Tuskegee Air Corps. At UB, Rev. Jones played on the football team and, in 1941, he became the first black member of an integrated UB football team to play on a field south of the Mason-Dixon Line. (The night before the game, at Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore, Mr. Jones stayed at the home of Carl J. Murphy, owner and publisher of the Afro American newspaper because hotels in the area wouldn’t let him stay with his white teammates!) Rev. Jones received many honors and awards during his life, including the 100 Most Outstanding Buffalonians of the Century. He entered the ministry late in life and became an associate minister at Bethel AME Church. Rev. Leeland Newton Jones Jr. is buried in section 31 in Forest Lawn.\n\nFounder of Legendary Furniture Company\n\nIrvine Kittinger died on July 12, 1941 at the age of 67. He was born in 1874 on Buffalo’s West side. He married Gertrude Colie, who was the niece of George W. Colie, President of Colie & Son, which actually began operations in 1866 – just one year after the end of the Civil War – as a paper factory under the name of Thompson, Collie & Company. By 1870, the company also began to manufacture upholstered furniture, and that business boomed. By 1885, they had opened a furniture plant that produced beautiful hand–crafted furniture in classic 18th century styles. As part of the extended Colie family, Irvine Kittinger began working for Colie & Son in 1904. After a few years with the firm, he was joined by his brother, Ralph. In 1913, the Kittinger brothers acquired the firm from the Colie family and changed the name to the Kittinger Company. Irvine was its president and general manager, while Ralph served as vice president and factory manager. In 1917, the brothers then built a new Kittinger factory at 1893 Elmwood Ave. Under their leadership, the Kittinger Company emerged as one of the nation’s leading manufacturers of handcrafted furniture, commissioned to produce pieces around the world, including the Oval Office fireside chairs and Cabinet Room conference table for the White House. In 1966, the Kittinger family sold the company to General Interiors Corporation. Irvine Kittinger is buried in section 33 1/2 in Forest Lawn.\n\nFounder of New Era Cap\n\nEhrhardt Koch died on November 8, 1953 at the age of 68. Mr. Koch was born in Germany and immigrated to the East side of Buffalo, N.Y. with his parents in the late 19th century. He started working for the Miller Brother’s Cap Company making caps in 1902. After 18 years with Miller, Koch borrowed $5,000 from his aunt and founded the New Era Cap Company with 14 employees on Genesee Street in 1920. Focusing on making high-quality men’s fashion headwear, New Era entered the market with the in-vogue, eight-panel Pacer-style cap known as the “Gatsby.” Wanting his son, Harold, to be involved in and appreciate the family business, Ehrhardt had him join the team. Harold started at the bottom, and worked his way up. Ehrhardt spent a lot of time teaching Harold every aspect of the New Era business, always driving home his belief that a superiorly produced, quality cap was the most important part of making the New Era customer happy; it would always keep the customer coming back for more. In 1932, the New Era Cap Company began to design baseball caps for the Major League Baseball and in 1934 the first baseball caps designed for the Major Leagues were for the Cleveland Indians – including their home and away caps. Ehrhardt Koch is buried in section 10 ½ in Forest Lawn.\n\nVisionary Philanthropist\n\nMaria Love died on July 19, 1931 at the age of 91. Born in Clarence, N.Y., she was a philanthropist and social visionary from an elite Buffalo family. Her father, Judge Thomas C. Love, was a veteran of the War of 1812, where he was wounded and captured at the American sortie at Fort Erie in 1814. He later became a prominent local abolitionist. Her brother was George Maltby Love, who was awarded the Congressional Medal of Honor for his capturing the South Carolina battle flag during the Civil War. Maria Love was a staunch Episcopalian and a member of the Daughters of the American Revolution. She was one of the most prominent adherents to the “Social Gospel,” a movement among late 19th century Protestants who were fervently humanitarian and interested in the solution to urban problems, especially poverty. In 1881, she established the Fitch Crèche, at 159 Swan Street in Buffalo. She did so after a trip to France where she became aware of the plight of children of working mothers. The Fitch Crèche was nationally recognized as the first day care center for the children of working women in the United States – one which would serve as a model to be emulated by other American cities. She also worked with William Prior Letchworth to make arrangements for children from Buffalo orphanages to have two-week stays at his home at Glen Iris. In 1903, Miss Love organized a group of 31 prominent Buffalo women to raise funds and implement a program of convalescent respite care for mothers and their children. This was the beginning of what is known today as the Maria M. Love Convalescent Fund. Maria Love is buried in section F in Forest Lawn.\n\nAccomplished Businessman & Philanthropist\n\nJohn R.Oishei was born in Buffalo—one of eight children of Charles and Julia Oishei. In 1916, Oishei was driving down Delaware Avenue near Virginia Street in downtown Buffalo during a rainstorm. A bicyclist ran into the National Roadster he was driving at the time. Oishei never saw him coming, and even though the cyclist was not seriously injured, Oishei vowed to never let that happen again. He sought out the best technology available at the time to create the first automobile wiper blades, and grew the idea from a simple fix to worldwide use. In 1917, John R. Oishei founded Trico Products Corporation. He looked for a way to clear moisture from a driver’s line of vision, and decided to invest in the national marketing of an edged, hand-pulled rubber squeegee that was produced in Buffalo by an engineer named John Jepson. Within three years, Oishei’s sales team had successfully sold the accessory to Packard, Lincoln, Cadillac and Buffalo’s own Pierce-Arrow. Through those sales, Oishei raised enough capital to buy out Jepson in 1919, and when World War I ended, he expanded availability of the product to Europe and beyond.\n\nToday, John R. Oishei’s legacy is still very much alive through the foundation which bears his name. It is Western New York’s largest private foundation. Among its most recent endeavors…Buffalo’s Women and Children’s Hospital has been renamed the John R. Oishei Children’s Hospital, as it prepares to move to its new home in Buffalo’s medical corridor. The Oishei Bell in Forest Lawn was also a gift of the Oishei Foundation.\n\nJohn R. Oishei is entombed in a private family mausoleum in section 23 in Forest Lawn.\n\nProminent Business Leader\n\nSamuel F. Pratt died on April 28, 1872. Mr. Pratt was born in Townsend, Vt., May 28, 1807, being a son of Samuel Pratt, Jr., and Sophia Fletcher. Soon after his birth, he came with his parents to Buffalo, where his early life and education were typical of the conditions of a frontier town. When he was twelve years old, he went to Canada as a clerk in a store, where he continued for the next three years. Returning to Buffalo, in 1822, he entered the hardware store of George and Thaddeus Weed. In 1828 Mr. Pratt, George Weed and Lucius Storrs formed a partnership as George Weed & Company. Mr. Weed died in 1828 and in 1829 his brother Thaddeus succeeded him in the business, which was continued as Weed & Pratt. In 1836 Mr. Pratt purchased the Weed interest and conducted the business till 1842, when with his brother Pascal P. Pratt, he established the well-known hardware house of S. F. Pratt & Company, with which he was for so many years identified. In 1845 Mr. Pratt and Mr. William P. Letchworth founded the firm of Pratt & Letchworth, manufacturers of saddlery hardware. In 1848 Mr. Pratt was a leading factor in the organization of the Buffalo Gas Light Company, and he served as its President to the time of his death. His family memorial in section X in Forest Lawn is a Gothic Revival miniature cathedral with a towering central spire and gargoyles. Classically draped, larger than life figures stand on pedestals a few feet out from each corner.\n\nPreeminent Marine Biologist\n\nMary Jane Rathbun, preeminent marine biologist, died on April 4, 1943 at the age of 82. She was born in Buffalo, NY, the youngest of five children of Charles Rathbun and Jane Furey. Her mother died when she was only one year old, and Mary was therefore “thrown on her own resources.” She was schooled in Buffalo, graduating in 1878, but never attended college. Rathbun first saw the ocean in 1881 when she accompanied her brother, Richard Rathbun, to Woods Hole, Massachusetts. He was employed as a scientific assistant to Addison Emery Verrill, alongside Verrill’s chief assistant, the carcinologist Sidney Irving Smith. Rathbun helped label, sort and record Smith’s specimens, and worked on crustaceans ever since. For three years, Rathbun worked on a voluntary basis for her brother, before being granted a clerkship by Spencer Fullerton Baird at the Smithsonian Institution in Washington, D.C. She continued to work at the museum, largely unaided, and after 28 years, she was promoted to assistant curator in charge of the Division of Crustacea. In 1915, after her retirement, the Smithsonian Institution designated Rathbun an “Honorary Research Associate”, and in 1916 she was granted an honorary master’s degree by the University of Pittsburgh. She qualified for a Ph.D. at George Washington University in 1917. She died from complications associated with a broken hip. Mary Jane Rathburn is buried in section 4 in Forest Lawn.\n\nOlympic Gold Medalist\n\nCharles Reidpath, Olympic gold medalist died on October 21, 1975. Born in Buffalo, and a graduate of Lafayette High School, it was while at Syracuse University 1908 – 1912 that Reidpath became a collegiate track star, winning the 220 yd (201 m) and 440 yd (402 m) dashes in the 1912 intercollegiate games. On graduating from Syracuse in 1912 with a degree in civil engineering, Reidpath was pressured by relatives to quit sports and take a position with the family business in Buffalo. Instead, he made the U.S. Olympic track team, and headed to Stockholm, Sweden. He took home two gold medals. Reidpath won the 400 m in an Olympic record shattering time of 48.2 seconds. Then, running the anchor leg of the 4 × 400 m relay, Reidpath helped the U.S. team set a world record of 3:16.6. In the 200 metres competition he finished fifth.

He died in Kenmore, New York, in 1975 and is buried in Section 1 in Forest Lawn.\n\nMajor General Bennet Riley died on June 9, 1853 at the age of 65. Born in Maryland in 1787, he volunteered for service in the War of 1812, during which he served as a Lieutenant in the United States Army Corps of Riflemen. He was, for a time, commander of the Buffalo Barracks in Buffalo, N.Y. He went on to fight the Mexican War and in Indian wars across a number of frontier states and territories. After the Mexican War, he was appointed as the sixth and last Military Governor of California by President James Polk. During his time in this position, Riley ordered the election of representatives to a state constitutional convention, and handed over all civil authority to a Governor and elected delegates at the end of 1849. The following year, California joined the U.S. as a state. After this Riley retired and lived in Buffalo. His home was on the west side of Main Street just south of Northampton St. Riley Street in Buffalo is named after him, as is Fort Riley in Kansas – one of just three generals for whom a military post is named. Major General Bennet Riley is buried in section E in Forest Lawn.\n\nMother of the American Detective Story\n\nAnna Katharine Green Rohlfs died on April 11, 1935 at the age of 89. Called the “Mother of the American Detective Story”, Anna’s 1878 book The Leavenworth Case is widely regarded as the first American detective novel. It is also the first such novel ever written by a woman, and in the views of some historians, the first bona fide American bestseller, selling a staggering 250,000 copies over a 15-year period. Born in 1846 in New York, Anna was the daughter of a prominent attorney (who was the source of her knowledge of legal and police matters). She was college educated—rare for a woman of that time—and initially embarked on a career as a poet, but found no success. She began working on The Leavenworth Case: A Lawyer’s Story in secret and spent six years on the manuscript, an effort that resulted in overnight success and fame upon its publication by G.P. Putnam’s Sons. Green would marry and ultimately support a struggling young actor named Charles Rohlfs, who would later appear in a stage production of The Leavenworth Case before finding great success as a furniture designer. (Some of his work can be found in Buckingham Palace.) Mrs. Green Rohlf’s influence and reputation were so great at the time that Arthur Conan Doyle (creator of Sherlock Holmes) made a point of seeking her out during an 1894 visit to the United States. Green raised a family, but still managed to turn out more than three dozen more books over the next 45 years. None of them would have the impact of The Leavenworth Case, which was so highly regarded for its insight into legal matters that it was used in Yale University law classes as an example of the perils of trusting circumstantial evidence. Anna Katharine Green Rohlfs is buried in section 27 in Forest Lawn.\n\nProminent Business Leader\n\nAaron Rumsey died on April 8, 1864. Mr. Rumsey was born in Hubbardstown, Vermont, in 1797. His brother Calvin had left home and settled in Warsaw where he set up and operated a tannery. Aaron eventually joined him. He married Sophia Phelps in 1819. They had two sons, Bronson Case, Dexter Phelps, and one daughter—Eleanor. The family came to Buffalo in 1832. There, Mr. Rumsey established a tannery located on the south side of the Main and Hamburg Streets canal, near Alabama Street. Over time, he built other tanneries throughout WNY. This was a lucrative business. Hides shipped down Lake Erie from the West sold cheap in the Buffalo market. As a consequence tanneries multiplied, and the manufacture of leather thrived. By 1835 at least every town in the county [Erie] had a tannery, some two or three. In 1838, Rumsey took on as a partner George Howard. The result was Rumsey & Howard. But after Howard left, Aaron took on his sons, Bronson and Dexter, who had been clerking for him, as partners in Aaron Rumsey & Company. Its Buffalo operation was on Exchange Street across from the Central Station. When their father died in 1864, the Rumsey brothers inherited the company and turned A. Rumsey & Company into one of the leading leather firms in the United States. The business was eventually absorbed by the United States Leather Company in 1893. The brothers invested much of their fortune into real estate in the City of Buffalo. It is said that at one point, they owned 22 of the 43 square miles that comprised Buffalo. Aaron Rumsey is buried in section X in Forest Lawn\n\nJohn N. Scatcherd died on September 23, 1917. Mr. Scatcherd was prominent in Buffalo’s financial,lumbering and manufacturing circles. He was born in Buffalo in 1857 and received his education in the Buffalo public schools. He graduated from Helmuth College, in London, Ontario and joined his father’s lumber firm, eventually becoming a partner in it. Upon the death of his father, the young Scatcherd, ran the firm, which was one of the largest hardwood lumber concerns in the country. He was also president of The Batavia and New York Woodworking Company, which manufactured high-end cabinets. This plant is one of the largest of its kind in the U.S. Mr. Scatcherd also served for a time as president of the Bank of Buffalo. Perhaps his greatest service to his city was as chairman of the executive committee of the board of directors of the Pan-American Exposition in 1901. This committee was in charge of the enterprise and wholly responsible for it. Mr. Scatcherd was with President William McKinley in the Temple of Music when the President was shot. He was also in attendance at the inauguration of President Theodore Roosevelt at the Wilcox residence on September 14, 1901 when he was sworn in as president. The high silk hat worn by President Roosevelt at the time of the inauguration was provided by Mr. Scatcherd. John N. Scatcherd is buried in section 12 in Forest Lawn.\n\nRussian Prince, Godson to Czar Nicholas II\n\nPrince Kyril Scherbatow of Russia died on April 13, 1993 at the age of 90. He was a native of St. Petersburg. Godson to Czar Nicholas II, both his parental families belonged to the House of Rurik, which founded Russia.

After living years in Europe he moved to the United States and married a Buffalo, NY native, Lucile Forman in 1971. They lived in Bermuda and New York and were frequent visitors to Buffalo. Prince Kyril Scherbatow and Lucile Forman Scherbatow are entombed in a family sarcophagus in section 23 in Forest Lawn.\n\nRenowned Leader in the Faith Community\n\nRev. Bennett Smith, long-time pastor of St. John the Baptist Church in Buffalo, died on August 7, 2001. Rev. Smith was born in a small town in Alabama in 1933. He joined the U.S. Air Force, where he served for 4 years before going on to Tennessee State University to earn his degree in education. Rev.

Born in Summer Hill, NY, he was a descendant of one of the oldest families in America. His ancestor, Edward Spaulding was an English Puritan, who settled in Massachusetts soon after the arrival of the Mayflower. Elbridge Spaulding began the study of law in the office of Fitch & Dibble at Batavia, NY. He completed his studies in Attica, NY and was admitted to the bar in Genesee County. In 1834, he moved to Buffalo, and became a clerk in the office of Potter & Babcock, leading attorneys in the city. Entering politics, he held the offices of City Clerk in Buffalo and was elected Alderman of the Third Ward. He became the Mayor of Buffalo in 1847 and later became a member of the NY State Assembly. Spaulding was elected as a Whig to the 31st United States Congress, serving from 1849 to 1851. He was elected again to the U.S. House of Representatives as a Republican, serving from 1859 to 1863. It was said that Spaulding was the one who figured out that the American government needed to print money to pay for the Civil War. At the time, it was regarded as economic heresy, but today many believe that the country would not have survived without it. Such an idea was then dismissed by some as “fiat money” – money that is money not because it is backed by gold or silver, but because some government says it is money. He was Chairman of a House Ways and Means Subcommittee when the government was in danger of running out of money to pay for the war. He wrote a law that allowed the government to print money and declare it had to be accepted as legal tender. By doing so, he became known as the “Father of the Greenback.” Elbridge Spaulding is buried in section G in Forest Lawn.\n\nMargaret St. John died on September 29, 1847. She had lost her son Cyrus in 1812, during the war to camp disease. On June 6, 1813, she would lose her husband Gamaliel and son Elijah, as they both drowned in the Niagara River ferrying supplies to the American army at Fort Erie. When the British attacked Buffalo on December 30, 1813, she sent seven of her nine remaining children to safety, keeping Maria and Sarah with her as the British closed in. Margaret actually was able to save, on the first day, both of her houses. However, when the British returned on January 1, 1814 she would only be able to save one of the two. The other was burned down. The St John house was one of three structures that remained in intact after the British attack. She stood up to the British and was able to save one house and her daughters. As a result of her actions and bravery she became a heroine of the War of 1812. Margaret St. John is buried in section 2 in Forest Lawn.\n\nOne of the “Singing Sutherland Sisters”\n\nVictoria Sutherland Craw died on May 14, 1902. She was one of the famous singing Sutherland Sisters—seven daughters of Fletcher and Mary Sutherland, from Cambria, New York. The sisters seemed destined to occupy the limelight from childhood, as the quality of their singing voices became known far and wide. A New York theatrical producer about to open a new theatre on Broadway induced the sisters to give a concert on opening night. From that time on their fame grew. They presented concerts throughout the State. However, it was the loss of their father’s hair that was destined to open a new channel for their activities. Perturbed by his thinning hair, Fletcher Sutherland was determined to find a cure. He created a hair growth tonic, and from their early childhood, his daughters groomed their hair with it – growing thick, healthy heads of hair. Photographs of their flowing tresses, appearing like silken trains, were admired all over the country. In 1882, the sisters signed a deal to tour with W.W. Coles Colossal Shows, and by 1884, the sisters had joined Barnum and Bailey’s Greatest Show on Earth as a sideshow attraction. P.T. Barnum himself dubbed them, “the seven most pleasing wonders of the world.” Victoria had the longest hair of all the girls, a full 7 feet from the top of her head to the ends. One fan offered her $2,500 to cut off all her hair. She refused, but did sell one strand of hair to a jeweler for $25. The jeweler then suspended a seven carat diamond from the hair, in his shop window. Victoria was always considered a beauty. In 1898, she married Wesley Craw, a 19-year-old preacher’s son, when she was 49. Her sisters were outraged and kicked her out of the family mansion. She was ostracized from them the rest of her short life. She passed away in 1902 at age 53, at her residence in New York City. Victoria Sutherland Craw is buried in section 1 in Forest Lawn.\n\nCivil Rights Pioneer\n\nMary Burnett Talbert was born in Oberlin, Ohio and graduated from Oberlin College. She went on to have an illustrious career as a social activist. In 1887, she was elected assistant principal of Little Rock, Arkansas High School. This was the highest position held by any woman in the state, and she was the only black woman to hold such a high position at the time. Mary Burnett would marry William H. Talbert of Buffalo in 1891, and soon thereafter moved to Buffalo, where she continued the work to which she dedicated her life. She was a driving force behind the formation of the Niagara Movement, which was established in 1905 and was the foundation for the NAACP in 1915. Mary Talbert was a patriotic worker during World War I, serving as a nurse in France. She worked for minority and women’s rights throughout the world, traveling and lecturing. Some say her greatest hour was the work she did on the anti-lynching crusade. Mary Burnett Talbert was inducted onto the National Women’s Hall of Fame in 2005, and Talbert Hall at the University of Buffalo is named in her honor. She is buried in section A in Forest Lawn.\n\nVisionary Philanthropist\n\nJames Tillinghast died on October 25, 1898. Mr. Tillinghast was assistant to the president of the New York Central Railroad and president of the Wagner Sleeping Car Company. He was a close friend of Commodore Vanderbilt, who expressed, on more than one occasion, admiration for Mr. Tillinghast’s extensive practical knowledge of railroading and respect for his judgment. Mr. Tillinghast was born in Cooperstown, New York in 1822. His working career started as a store clerk. Eventually he would be part owner of a country store. After this he worked on ships and then got interested in the railroad business. In 1882, Mr. Tillinghast came to Buffalo to organize, with two partners, a line of steam propeller ships on the Great Lakes. Subsequently, he was identified with the Michigan, Southern, Buffalo & Erie, and the New York Central roads. When Vanderbilt obtained control of the New York Central Road, one of his first acts was to name Mr. Tillinghast its superintendent with headquarters in Albany. Under his administration, tonnage hauled on that road increased tenfold while freight rates decreased. In 1881, he was appointed assistant to the president of the New York Central Railroad. Mr. Tillinghast was also vice-president of the Niagara River Bridge Company, which built the cantilever bridge at the Falls, opened in 1883. James Tillinghast is buried in section 2 in Forest Lawn.\n\nJudge played a key role in establishing Buffalo Harbor\n\nCharles Townsend died on September 14, 1847. Mr. Townsend was born in Norwich, Connecticut in 1786. There he worked in a drugstore. He moved to Buffalo in 1811 with his friend and business partner, George Coit. In Buffalo they established the same type of business. The day before Buffalo was attacked by the British on December 30, 1813, Coit and Townsend left the village of Buffalo, fearful of an attack. They returned in the spring and reestablished their business. Later, they engaged in ship-building and lake transportation. In 1813, Mr. Townsend was appointed Judge of Niagara County, an office which he held till 1826. In 1819, he married Jane Corning of Albany. The couple would have six children. Judge Townsend took a leading part in securing a harbor for Buffalo. In 1821, he, Mr. Coit, and two other citizens mortgaged their private property to the State and obtained a loan of $12,000 for the purpose of building the harbor. The work was accomplished, and on its success the project was taken up by the State and later by the Federal Government – the outcome being the rebuilding of the harbor in its present form. In this courageous act of Judge Townsend and his coadjutors in pledging their own property for the benefit of the public, was the germ of the greatness of the port of Buffalo. The Townsend name is also identified with the origin of that financial institution, the Buffalo Savings Bank. The bank was organized May 9, 1846, with Judge Townsend being elected its first President, an office which he continued to hold until his death. Charles Townsend is buried in section R in Forest Lawn.\n\nWorld Record Setting Runner\n\nDeerfoot, (Lewis Bennett) or Hut-goh-so-do-neh in his native tongue, died on January 17, 1896. He was born into the Seneca tribe on the Cattaraugus Reservation in 1828. Deerfoot gained fame as runner — dominating the long-distance racing scene in the United States and abroad in the mid-19th century. He won his first race in 1856 at the Erie County Fair, running five miles in 25 minutes. His victory earned him a purse of $50. His reputation spread beyond WNY, and he raced frequently at fairs all over the Northeast. An English sports promoter learned about him and booked Deerfoot on a 20-month European tour, where he went from mysterious runner, to entertainer, to world record holder. The intense competition against the best British and Irish runners helped him improve dramatically. With the aid of pace makers, he set world records of 10 miles in 51:26 and 12 miles in 1:02:02. Deerfoot’s physical appearance and manners added to his attraction. He stood tall, at almost 6 feet, and weighed 160 pounds. He ran most of his races with a bare chest, wearing a feather apron around his waist and a band with one eagle feather around his head. His dark complexion was a stark contrast to the sun-starved British athletes. And he yelled war whoops as he raced to victory. His popularity extended rapidly beyond the racing crowd, and The Prince of Wales attended many races and contributed to the purse. He was inducted in the Greater Buffalo Sports Hall of Fame in 2011. Deerfoot is buried in section 12 in Forest Lawn. To read the story about his jacket, published in the Buffalo News, click here."
