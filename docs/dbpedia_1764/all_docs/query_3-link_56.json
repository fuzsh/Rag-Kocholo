        "text": "NEW YORK (WABC) -- A powerful winter storm spawned flooding and rescues in New Jersey and caused downed trees and powerlines in some parts of New York.\n\nIn NYC, nearly 2 inches of rain (1.95 inches in Central Park) fell overnight into Wednesday, causing widespread flooding of poor drainage and low-lying areas. Most, if not all of that flooding had dissipated by Thursday morning.\n\nIn New Jersey, where Gov. Phil Murphy declared a state of emergency in advance of the storm, eyes are still on the Passaic and Ramapo Rivers which have not crested as of Thursday morning. The Saddle Brook River crested on Wednesday and caused widespread flooding throughout Lodi.\n\nNearby Caldwell, New Jersey, got 3.22 inches of rain.\n\nSome 5,000 customers in New Jersey remained without power Thursday morning.\n\nLatest AccuWeather Forecast\n\nCheck river levels in New Jersey\n\nSchool closings and delays in New York, New Jersey, and Connecticut\n\nSend your weather photos to Eyewitness News\n\nLatest AccuTrack Radar\n\nSTORM UPDATES\n\nEvacuation orders in Norwich, CT lifted\n\nEvacuation orders have been lifted in Norwich, CT, where a dam sprung a leak during the winter storm.\n\nSandbags have been put in place so that workers can make repairs.\n\nDozens rescued in New Milford\n\nDozens of people were rescued from flooded homes in New Jersey and some rivers haven't even crested yet.\n\nIn New Milford, first responders know the drill as flooding has been an ongoing issue when storms and high tides meet.\n\nMayor Michael Putrino says the town has been in talks with state officials about trying to address the flooding issues once and for all.\n\nToni Yates had details from New Milford.\n\nPassaic River flood levels could exceed height from December storm: officials\n\nThe Fairfield Police Department projected the Passaic River to rise to 21.9 feet by Thursday morning.\n\nResidents nearby are urged to evacuate as the river is expected to crest sometime Thursday.\n\nIn addition to Gov. Murphy's State of Emergency, Paterson Gov. Andre Sayegh announced a State of Emergency Monday for the city.\n\nThe governor was criticized for his failure to declare a state of emergency in advance of last month's storm. State officials say his decision to do so on Monday underlined how much worse Tuesday's rainfall could be.\n\nIt was late December, just days before Christmas, when the river over-spilled its banks from a deluge of rain.\n\nIt reached major flood stage at 21.5 feet and caused homes to flood and some residents needed high water rescues.\n\n\"We had to perform rescue operations from our previous storm a few weeks ago, we have high water vehicles prepared as well in the event we have to rescue resident,\" Paterson Mayor Andre Sayegh said.\n\nThe Passaic River will start flooding once it reaches 19 feet and officials are expecting it to swell beyond that level again.\n\n\"Real prep would be at this point, I know a lot of these people who were impacted the first time just finished restoring. Their homes just had hot water and heat and furnaces replaced in their homes, doing anything you can to mitigate any potential loss of those in the second round,\" Mayor of Little Falls James Belford Damiano said.\n\nPhil Taitt reports on Thursday's Passaic River levels.\n\nWayne Public Schools delayed opening\n\nWayne Township Public Schools announced a 90-minute delayed opening on Thursday, due to expected flooding and hazardous road conditions.\n\nResidents can check the public school's official website for more details.\n\nWatching the Saddle River in Lodi\n\nIn Lodi, the Saddle River was cresting higher than expected Wednesday.

The mayor of Freeport detailed their efforts.\n\nChantee Lans was in Freeport.\n\nFurther east, near the Hamptons, the National Weather Service reported major flooding out of Shinnecock Bay.\n\nSeveral schools across Long Island said they were either canceling or delaying classes as a result of the storm.\n\nSuffolk County State of Emergency\n\nSuffolk County Executive Ed Romaine issued a state of emergency Tuesday morning ahead of the storm.\n\n\"I am issuing a State of Emergency for Suffolk County to ensure our residents are best prepared for the incoming severe weather,\" said Romaine. \"While the height of the storm is anticipated to impact the County during the evening and overnight hours, I strongly advise our residents to avoid travel as heavy rainfall, strong wind gusts and potential flooding are all possible.\"\n\nCoastal flooding is possible along the county's shorelines as widespread moderate floods in usual areas are projected in conjunction with the Wednesday morning high tide cycle. In addition, flash flooding may be possible in poor drainage areas. The county is also under a high wind warning.\n\nLong Island power\n\nPSE &G Long Island says power has been restored to more than 99.5% of customers that were impacted by the gusty winds and heavy rain that brought down trees and heavy branches onto wires, causing scattered power outages.\n\nAs of 8:15 p.m., PSE &G Long Island said they restored power to more than 26,400 customers. They are reporting that 124 of its 1.2 million customers are currently without service.\n\nRock slide concerns and road closures\n\nIn Rockland County, the Palisades Interstate Parkway is closed by flooding and debris on the roadway.\n\nFurther north, Route 6 at the parkway was also closed after vehicles were reportedly submerged in water, with people rescued.\n\nRescues were also reported in Highland Falls and also in Orange County. Those locations had similar flooding last July, and are still recovering.\n\nJanice Yu reports from Stony Brook on Wednesday's road conditions.\n\nOrange County fatal crash\n\nOne person was killed in a crash on I-87 in Woodbury just after 12 a.m. Wednesday.

As always, I urge all New Jerseyans - including residents in our coastal and riverine communities - to follow all safety protocols and remain off the roads unless absolutely necessary.\"\n\nThe Governor encouraged New Jerseyans to visit ready.nj.gov for important weather updates and safety information.

The North Country may also see up to a foot of snow, especially in higher elevations.\n\n\"After the weekend weather brought snow across our State, a new storm threatens to cause substantial flooding and gale force winds - posing a risk of power outages and creating unsafe travel conditions,\" Governor Hochul said. \"I have directed State agencies to monitor the storm closely as it unfolds, and they are prepared to work with our local partners as needed. I ask all New Yorkers to please take caution and keep track of weather and travel information in your area.\"\n\nIn the city, NYC Emergency Management has issued a travel advisory for the storm.\n\nA Flood Watch is in effect citywide ahead of the storm for Tuesday evening through Wednesday afternoon.
