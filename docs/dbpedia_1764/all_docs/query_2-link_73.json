        "text": "I was born in Indianapolis, Indiana where shortly after, I moved and was raised in St.Petersburg FL. I found my passion for writing in the later years of high school, and since then have been working on an epic adventure novel, along with several other short stories. I have always been coming up with ideas in my head which I think are cool, and either trying to put them to words, or I'll also draw them out. I love writing and drawing, and I also have a strong fascination for video games and movies, ever since I was very young. Most of the inspiration I draw comes from those sources, I like to see them as my lego blocks that I can play with and build something great out of them."
