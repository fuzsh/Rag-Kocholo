        "text": "William was born in Ashby de la Zouch into an army family, in 1911 he is aged 4 living with his family in Loughborough. His mother died in 1916 and by the late 1930's he and his father Edwin were living in Wigston Magna with his sister Violet and her family, after a row with his father he disappeared and was never heard of since, he may have joined the army. One of his sisters died in 1961 and left her estate to her siblings, William was searched for but never found.\n\nAny help would be appreciated.\n\nHis mother was Henrietta Louisa Riggs. The probate date after his sister Isabella's death was 7 march 1961, looks like they got his mothers name wrong, but the right record.\n\nI don't have his date of birth, just that it was the 3rd quarter of 1907 so the Stoke on Trent death may not be him.\n\nWell if he did get married none of his family got an invitation!\n\nHis father died in 1945 so I would think that he would have got back in touch with his siblings then if he knew about his father's death, his father was an army man all his life, he didn't get on too well with his children or his grandchildren.\n\nThere are two possible births for William. This one which you seem to think is him as it's in the 3rd Qtr:-\n\nName: SMITH, William Edwin\n\nRegistration district: Ashby de la Zouch\n\nCounty: Leicestershire\n\nYear of registration: 1907\n\nQuarter of registration: Jul-Aug-Sep\n\nMother's maiden name: Not available before 1911 Q3\n\nVolume no: 7A\n\nPage no: 94\n\nbut more likely is this one if he was born into a military family:-\n\nName: SMITH, William E\n\nMother's maiden name: Not available before 1966\n\nRegiment: 17th Foot\n\nPlace: Ashby de la Zouch\n\nCountry: England\n\nYear: 1907\n\nVolume: 1009\n\nPage: 132\n\nRecord source: GRO Regimental Birth Indices (1761 to 1924)\n\nIf you buy the certificate you will at least have his exact date of birth.\n\nEDIT - after looking at the 1911 census where his father is in the Territorials perhaps the first birth IS the most likely.\n\nKath. x\n\nResearching:\n\nPLEASE DO NOT: send me information concerning your thread on the board as it should be posted on your request where all members can see it. PLEASE DO NOT: ask me for help with lookups as they should be placed on the boards to get the best possible result. PLEASE DO NOT: open your tree just because I have posted information on your thread as I will not be related. THANK YOU. Researching Carter, Cass and Walker in England. Researching Caven, McKill, Sutherland and Will in Scotland.\n\nIt seems that William, his father Edwin (army pensioner) and his sister Isabella were all living in Tewkesbury Street Leicester in 1934 when Isabella married (aged 41). Isabella then left to live with her husband in Oadby and the two chaps moved in with my grandmother her husband and their 5 children in Oadby Lane, Wigston Magna. Edwin lived there until his death in 1945.\n\nLooks like I will need to get William's birth certificate to find out what happened next.\n\nThe only marriage certificate I have is that of Isabella in 1934 and William was not a witness. His other siblings married in 1922 and 1925, and William may have been too young to be a witness to those.\n\nIf the birth certificate comes back with a birth date of 7th July then I would definitely order the death certificate that Mary has found as the informant may be a relative. This is the full GRO reference:-\n\nName: SMITH, William Edwin\n\nRegistration district: Sutton\n\nCounty: Surrey\n\nYear of registration: 1994\n\nMonth of registration: December\n\nDate of birth: 7 July 1907\n\nDistrict no: 2541B\n\nReg no: B2B\n\nEnt no: 148\n\nDOR: 1294\n\nKath. x\n\nThank you, my aunts (they knew him, he lived in their house and they are getting on in years now) and I would love to know what happened to William, I'll wait until I have his birth record.\n\nThese are father Edwin 's army records which you might find of interest ?\n\nBritish Army WWI Pension Records 1914-1920 about Edward Smith\n\nName: Edward Smith\n\n[Edwin Smith]\n\nEstimated Birth Year: abt 1865\n\nAge at enlistment: 18\n\nBirth Parish: All Saints\n\nBirth County: Leicester\n\nDocument Year: 1883\n\nRegimental Number: 683\n\nRegiment Name: Leicester Regiment\n\nNumber of images: 7\n\nThey are dated 23rd August 1883 and his age at that time was given as 18 years and 4 months, suggesting a birth around April, 1865.\n\nIf you look at image no. 26436 you will see his signature halfway down the page which is identical to the one on the 1911 census.\n\nDea x\n\nYes I have his service records but no records regarding his TA service. I also have no idea why he enlisted as Edward when he was actually Edwin, all his civil records are Edwin, army records Edwin! But I know we have the correct army records as his next of kin, his wife and some of his children are listed, 2 of his children were born in the West Indies, he married in Halifax, Nova Scotia."
