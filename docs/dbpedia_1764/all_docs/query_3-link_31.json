        "text": "Governor Kathy Hochul today honored 68 police officers from seven departments who sacrificed their lives in service to their fellow New Yorkers. The officers’ names have been added to the New York State Police Officers Memorial at the Empire State Plaza in Albany, and Governor Hochul spoke this afternoon at the Remembrance Ceremony. The black granite walls of the memorial now include the names of 1,840 police officers from 152 agencies across the state, and six federal agencies. The Governor also issued a proclamation designating May 7 as Police Memorial Day and directed state landmarks to be illuminated blue tonight to remember the fallen and recognize the service of police officers across the state.\n\n“Our law enforcement officers put their lives on the line every time they put on their uniforms in service to their communities – today we honor those who made the ultimate sacrifice,” Governor Hochul said. “We honor 68 police officers who paid the ultimate price to keep us safe. Our hearts are with their loved ones as we remember them and their unwavering commitment to serve the State of New York.”\n\n“Today we honor and remember the law enforcement members who made the ultimate sacrifice to keep our communities safe,” said Lieutenant Governor Antonio Delgado. “Their bravery, courage, and commitment to New York will never be forgotten.”\n\nThe following landmarks will be illuminated blue tonight.\n\nOne World Trade Center\n\nGovernor Mario M.

Bromm was shot on December 21, 1977, and paralyzed from the waist down while investigating a minor traffic accident in Park Slope, Brooklyn.

The state Office of General Services maintains the memorial and its commissioner also serves on the Committee.\n\nDivision of Criminal Justice Commissioner Rossana Rosado said, \"We deeply appreciate and honor the sacrifices of these brave police officers and keep their loved one and friends in our hearts. We are thankful for their selfless public service and will always remember their dedication to the safety of all New Yorkers.”\n\nOffice of General Services Commissioner Jeanette Moy said, “Today, we solemnly pay tribute to the dedication and heroism of police officers who made the ultimate sacrifice while in the line of duty. OGS is proud to maintain the State of New York Police Officers Memorial at the Empire State Plaza, providing a space for solitude and reflection for the family, friends, and colleagues of those who have given their lives in service to others.”\n\nThe memorial is based on a design concept suggested by Colleen Dillon Bergman, the daughter of Emerson J. Dillon Jr., a 16-year veteran of the New York State Police who was killed in the line of duty in 1974. Bergman also suggested that the names of police officers be placed on the memorial without regard to rank. In a letter to the committee established to oversee the memorial’s creation, she explained: “It doesn’t matter from which department they came, the feeling of loss is experienced the same.” Those words are engraved on the memorial.\n\nMemorial Inclusion Criteria\n\nTo be included on the memorial, an individual must have been a police officer, as defined in the State’s Criminal Procedure Law, or employed as a federal law enforcement officer and performed the same or essentially similar duties as defined in that law. Applications to DCJS for inclusion on the memorial must be made by agencies that employed the officers.\n\nIn addition to Commissioners Rosado and Moy, the following individuals serve on the Memorial Advisory Committee: New York State Troopers PBA President Charles Murphy, Metropolitan Transportation Authority Police Benevolent Associations President Michael O’Meara, New York State Association of Chiefs of Police Executive Director Patrick Phelan, New York State Sheriffs’ Association Executive Director Peter R. Kehoe, Patrolmen’s Benevolent Association of the City of New York President Patrick Hendry, Federal Law Enforcement Officers Association Chapter President Andrew Rakowsky, and the Police Conference of New York President Richard Wells.\n\nThe Division of Criminal Justice Services provides critical support to all facets of the state’s criminal justice system, including, but not limited to: training law enforcement and other criminal justice professionals; overseeing a law enforcement accreditation program; ensuring Breathalyzer and speed enforcement equipment used by local law enforcement operate correctly; managing criminal justice grant funding; analyzing statewide crime and program data; providing research support; overseeing county probation departments and alternatives to incarceration programs; and coordinating youth justice policy.
