        "text": "The year was 1881. In May, Louis Pasteur demonstrated that he had developed an effective vaccine against anthrax in cattle and Clara Barton founded the American Red Cross.\n\nOn July 2, the country was rocked when President James Garfield was shot on his way to a seaside vacation in New Jersey. He died September 19, the second president in 16 years to be assassinated, making Chester A. Arthur the 21st President of the United States.\n\nIn Albany, plans were being drawn up for a new college for the study of pharmacy. Although the seed for the college had been planted in the late 1870s by Willis Tucker, M.D., Ph.D., of the Albany Medical College faculty and Gustavus Michaelis, Ph.G., of the Albany Pharmaceutical Corp., there was little interest at the time and the proposal was shelved.\n\nIt wasn't until 1880 that the idea was revived by Archibald McClure, a wholesale druggist in the city, in concert with Albany Medical College Professor Jacob Mosher, M.D., and Board member Joseph Russell. Finally, on August 27, 1881, Albany College of Pharmacy of Union University was incorporated. At the time, ACP (as it would be known for the next 127 years) was one of only 14 colleges of pharmacy in the United States, with the closest schools located in New York City and Montreal.\n\nAlbany proved to be an attractive location, providing fertile ground for new students. In the early years the College utilized lecture halls and labs at Albany Medical College, then located in the former Lancaster School on Eagle Street (see photo), between Jay and Lancaster, and a block from Albany's brand new State Capitol building. Students also could attend, free of charge, lectures in any of the other departments at Union or at the State Library and State Museum of Natural History.\n\nThe cost of living was reasonable compared to other cities. Although there were no facilities for living on campus, \"good board and rooms could be had for $3.50-$6 per week\" and students were advised that \"by clubbing together and boarding themselves, they [could] live comfortably and pleasantly at even lower rates.\"\n\nThe first course of lectures at ACP began October 3, 1881 - two weeks to the day after President Garfield's death. It was attended by 21 students, including one woman, Sarah Simonet of Croghan, N.Y., a full 38 years before the United States passed the 19th Amendment giving women the right to vote.\n\nThe program was two years in duration, with students attending lectures five hours per week for 21 weeks from October through March. Lectures were held at 8:00 p.m. each evening and on Saturday afternoons. Each term, students purchased lecture tickets for $15 - a total of $30 for the full session - and paid a $3 matriculation fee and a $10 graduation fee.\n\nJust three professors were on the roster that first year, each of them among the catalysts for the new College. Dr. Mosher served as Professor of Botany and Materia Medica as well as the first President of the Faculty. Dr. Tucker was Professor of Chemistry and Secretary. Michaelis was Professor of Pharmacy.\n\nAll were respected in their fields. Harry Duryea, Class of 1886, recalled one of the highlights of his years at ACP as \"the time that Professor Michaelis invented a new way of making chloroform and showed the class how he did it.\" The Michaelis process utilized acetate of lime to manufacture chloroform and was just one of several discoveries by the popular faculty member.\n\nDr. Tucker later became well-known as a toxicologist and expert witness in deaths involving poisoning. Dr. Mosher, after serving as a surgeon during the Civil War, was Medical Director of the State of New York and, prior to his appointment at ACP, had been selected by President Rutherford B. Hayes to investigate the yellow fever epidemic.\n\nInitially, those applying to the College did not have to complete an entrance exam for admission. To earn their Ph.G. - Graduate in Pharmacy - students had to be 21 years of age, show good moral character, attend two full courses of lectures, including lab practice, and have four years of experience with a reputable pharmacist. In addition, they had to present an original thesis - on a topic such as \"Opium, Its Preparation and Properties\" - as well as pass an oral exam. Upon graduation, they legally were entitled to practice pharmacy.\n\nIn the spring of 1882, Albert R. Griffith, Gustave Kreutzer and John S. Phillips, who had entered the new College as seniors the previous fall, were the first to earn degrees from ACP. The first Commencement exercises were held in the amphitheater of Albany Medical College and \"social festivity prevailed\" at a dinner held after- wards at the Windsor Restaurant. By the 1882-83 session, the class size had grown to 32 students and there were 10 graduates, an upward trend that continued in the ensuing years.\n\nIn 1883, Dr. Mosher passed away and Dr. Tucker replaced him as President. Alfred Huested (known as \"Old Daddy\" to at least of few of the students) was hired as the new Professor of Pharmacy and Secretary.\n\nThe Catalog of 1883-84 notes that \"it will probably not be long before a college diploma or license from an examining board will be required to practice,\" and, indeed, in 1884 the 107th Session of the New York State Legislature created the State Board of Pharmacy to regulate the practice of pharmacy statewide, except in New York City and Kings and Erie counties.\n\nThat same year, the Trustees of ACP established a Board of Examiners composed of Huested and several local pharmacists to handle the examination of candidates for graduation.\n\nBy 1885-86, entrance requirements also had grown stricter, with knowledge of the \"English branches\" required and a preliminary exam, or grammar school certificate admitting the student to high school, was necessary.\n\nThough the students attended classes several evenings a week, usually after a full day working in a local drug store, life at ACP was not all work and no play.\n\nHenry Baringer, Class of 1886, remembered that \"half a dozen of us marched down to Zeller's for lager beer one hot spring evening and ran into Professor Michaelis sitting behind a tall one at one of the tables, which may have embarrassed us but seemingly did not fuss the professor.\"\n\nStudents also enjoyed the \"big oyster stews at Keeler's on Green Street , a swell feed for 15 cents and no tips.\"\n\nThe Association of the Alumni of Albany College of Pharmacy was formed early on, in 1883, and included any faculty who were not alumni of the College. Dues were $1 per year for first three years only. An Annual Meeting was held on Commencement evening, with a banquet \"attended by members of the Association and friends of both sexes,\" and a prize awarded for the best student thesis.\n\nBy 1885, an alumni pin fashioned of 14-carat gold and enamel could be purchased by graduates for a mere $5. Throughout the 1880s, Commencement moved from Agricultural Hall, at State and Lodge, to Jermain Hall, with entertainment that ran the gamut from music on Haines \"celebrated upright piano\" to selections from Gilbert and Sullivan's new comic opera, \"The Mikado.\"\n\nCommencement speakers varied as well. The first Commencement in 1882 featured Professor David Murray, Secretary of the Regents of the University of the State of New York, who told the graduates, \"We want educated pharmacists. It is impossible that the duties involved in this business can be performed by ignorant and unskilled persons. For this reason I hailed the establishment of Albany College of Pharmacy.\"\n\nIn 1887, Prof. P.W. Bedford, a Professor at New York College of Pharmacy and Editor of the Pharmaceutical Record, gave this advice, in spite of the fact that ACP had been coeducational from its inception: \"Marry early, it is not good for man to be alone, a home is the desire of all. And to the fair damsels before me, new homes cannot be organized without your consent, give your aid in this matter that the advice I have given the young men can be carried into effect.\"\n\nBy 1889, 22 graduates, including ACP's first international student, Huvand Hekimian of Asia Minor (the Asian part of modern Turkey), marched down the aisle to the strains of the \"Golden Rod Polka\" as ACP got ready to enter the 1890s.\n\nAs ACP entered the new millennium, change was in the air.\n\nThe population of Albany in 1900 was a whopping 94,000 and growing larger each year, as was the number of enrollees at the College. By 1901, after 20 years of existence, ACP's graduating class had risen from three to 29.\n\nThe College continued to grow and change. Willis G. Tucker, M.D., Ph.D., now had been Dean for nearly 20 years, in addition to positions as Dean and Professor at Albany Medical College and his work as the Director of the Bureau of Chemistry for the State Board of Health.\n\nWith a ready-made cadre of pharmacy professors available from the ranks of the alumni, the College kept up the practice of bringing graduates on board to fill teaching positions. Theodore Bradley '95 was named Secretary of the school and, in 1902, Edwin Cunningham Hutman '91, became Director of the Pharmacy Lab. In the Pharmacy Lab, located on Maiden Lane and later on Howard Street , seniors learned compounding of prescriptions and practical dispensing.\n\nThere were now eight professors, up from the original three, and, although the Pharmacy program still was just two years in duration, students were required to attend six or more lectures each week for 25 weeks a year. Scholarly texts included Gray's Lesson's for Botany, the National Dispensatory for Materia Medica and Caspari's for Pharmacy.\n\nCourses in Physics, taught by William L. Larkin '01, and Pharmaceutical Calculations were added to the curriculum. By the end of the decade, the faculty had increased to 11 and the 28-week academic year included courses in Latin, to assist in reading and writing prescriptions; Toxicology; Hygiene and First Aid to the Injured; Commercial Pharmacy; Inorganic Chemistry; Physiology and Pharmaceutical Jurisprudence.\n\nStudents were held more accountable than in the past; there was a preliminary entrance exam and optional weekly recitations were added to prepare for the new state licensing regulations that were scheduled to go into effect for pharmacists. The extra classes and requirements were reflected in the tuition, which rose to $70 a year with a $3 matriculation fee. As ACP entered its third decade, alumni numbered nearly 400 and continued to meet annually on Commencement evening. With the subject of women's rights much in the forefront across society, the ACP Alumni Association took a radical step in 1900 when it decided to \"invite ladies\" to its banquet. \"We have several women graduates among us, paying dues, whom we have no right to debar from the benefits of membership\" read the minutes of the annual meeting.\n\nThe banquet that year was held at the swanky Kenmore Hotel in Albany and for $2.50 a plate alumni feasted on an elegant repast that concluded with Punch au Kirsch, cigarettes and the exotic sounding Spongato, an Italian-style ice cream.\n\nBy 1901, the Alumni Association had deemed that inviting women was an \"experiment so successful\" that the men were advised to \"come and bring your better half\" every year. From that point on, both alumnae and spouses of alumni were invited to the banquet annually.\n\nThe pharmacy field was going through its own changes. In 1904, Chapter 554 of the New York State Law passed, decreeing that \"all candidates for license appearing before the Board of Examiners must be graduates of a college or School of Pharmacy regulated by the Board of Regents in the State of NY, which requires 12 Regents counts for entrance.\" The law, which took effect in January 1905, \"elevated very materially the standing of pharmacy in the state.\"\n\nTo attend ACP, students needed a Pharmacy Student Certificate issued by the New York State Education Department, though they no longer were required to have drug store experience upon entrance to the College. However, students still needed to get in a certain number of hours of hands-on experience before graduation, and diplomas were withheld until the College requirements were met.\n\nThere were changes in the workplace as well. Under the new law, pharmacists could not work more than 136 hours in two consecutive weeks or more than 10 hours a day (12 on Saturday). And, in 1906, the Pure Food and Drug Act established the Food and Drug Administration, which had regulatory oversight of labels and packaging information for over-the-counter drugs, requiring pharmacists to accurately label patent medicines containing opium, morphine and other drugs.\n\nIn 1905, the first ACP Alumni Directory was published and pointed up the wide diversity in jobs held by graduates during the first 20 years of the College's existence. Some alumni returned to the College to teach, including Garret V. Dillenback '84, Ph.G., who came on board when Gustavus Michaelis, Ph.G., stepped down as an active Professor of Pharmacy in 1903.\n\nOthers, such as Birdsie L. Maltbie '85, President of the Maltbie Chemical Corporation of East Orange , N.J. , became wealthy owners of their own pharmaceutical companies.\n\nWarren L. Bradt '89 was Secretary of the New York State Board of Pharmacy, Robert Lamb '89 was Superintendent of the State Hospital at Dannemora and Harry Mason '94 was editor of the Bulletin of Pharmacy.\n\nTwo years after leaving ACP, Burt Orrin Kinney founded his first pharmacy in 1903. The Gouverneur-based chain that bears his name now includes 80 employee-owned stores in New York and Vermont.\n\nStill other graduates became \"commercial travelers\" or traveling salesmen, proprietors and physicians.\n\nIn 1907, ACP experienced a temporary lag in enrollment due to the more stringent entry requirements under the new law, but no one seemed unduly worried. A history of Union University written that year stated that the College's \"chief need is a building of its own.\"\n\nBy 1909, that wish had come true. ACP moved into the former Humane Society Building on Eagle Street, right across the street from its former home at Albany Medical College. A four-story building proudly labeled with the College's name in large gold letters, the new facility provided lecture room for 100 and labs for Pharmacy, Microscopy and Pharmacognosy, although the Chemistry Lab still was located at AMC.\n\nThe second decade of the new century was a time of both positive change and turmoil for ACP, the pharmacy profession and the world. At the same time the College began to spread its wings and really take off, the \"teens\" brought the beginning of World War I, as well as new narcotics legislation and Prohibition, both of which affected pharmacies throughout the country. And, after nearly 40 years, it was a decade that also brought a change in leadership for the College.\n\nBy 1910, ACP was firmly ensconced in its new home on Eagle Street, right across the street from its former quarters at Albany Medical College. But with booming enrollment, soon even the new quarters started to feel a bit pinched. In 1914, a plan was drawn up to increase the facilities by 50 percent, at an estimated cost of $6,000-$7,000. An alumni appeal added to the $4,000 the College had put aside for the project, which was completed in time for the 1916-17 academic year. With room for all of the labs in the expanded space, all of ACP's facilities were under one roof for the first time in its history.\n\nAfter a few years in the Odd Fellows Hall in downtown Albany, graduation ceremonies were now held in Chancellor's Hall in the new State Education Building, completed in 1912. Students also attended special Wednesday evening lectures in the facility. Topics relating to public health and of interest to budding pharmacists were covered by representatives of the State and City Departments of Health and Education.\n\nStudents also were encouraged to take advantage of other local facilities, including the Museum of Natural History, which had spent \"a million and a half dollars\" to provide exhibits on Botany and Zoology; the State Library, \"with nearly every periodical in the world;\" and the YMCA, with access to billiards rooms, a bowling alley, pool, gym and \"shower baths.\" All students were urged to join ACP's Physical Training class, which used the facilities at the Y.\n\nPupils were warned off less wholesome pursuits in a talk by Alfred Huested, M.D. Ph.G., Secretary of the College and a Botany Professor since 1883, who cautioned them about \"the temptations of city life.\" These presumably included drinking \"Albany's famous Beverwyck beer\" or those manufactured by the Dobler or Hinckel breweries; all three were advertised in the school's new yearbook, The Alembic, when it made its debut in 1916.\n\nThe Alembic, named for a type of distilling apparatus used in pharmacy, was hailed by Dean Willis G. Tucker, M.D., Ph.D., as a way to \"promote solidarity, true fellowship and real community of interests in the student body\" as well as \"legitimate college spirit.\"\n\nFraternities also made their first appearance at ACP during the decade. The Beta Delta Chapter of Kappa Psi was installed November 11, 1910, with 38 active members, including faculty, juniors and seniors. The members celebrated with a \"smoker, at which was enjoyed punch, cigarettes and cigars. In addition, the frat held an annual banquet at Keeler's Hotel.\n\nIn the fall of 1916, the fraternity acquired new and spacious quarters located at 53 South Hawk Street. Roy Boles, Class of 1920, remembered that for a short while he lived in the house - until the bedbugs got to him. He relocated to a boarding house on Lancaster Street at a cost of $8 a week.\n\nThe first fraternity actually founded at ACP was the Alpha Chapter of Epsilon Phi, established March 17, 1917, under the leadership of Chapter President George Niles Hoffman and class valedictorian Ralph Young, who served as Treasurer. The frat even counted four women among its ranks as honorary members. Purely a local body, the fraternity opted to nationalize in 1931 and formed the foundation for the Alpha Theta Chapter of Phi Delta Chi at ACP.\n\nThe Beta Chapter of ACP's first sorority, Lambda Kappa Sigma, was chartered in 1919. Though the group was small, due to the limited number of women attending the College, with the help of the faculty wives they sponsored subscription dances and rush parties galore - from a Halloween party to an April Fool's Dance - at Wolfert's Roost and the Kenmore Hotel.\n\nAlthough the number of women at ACP continued to climb each year, in 1916 their presence was unusual enough to warrant the following comment in the yearbook: \"Near the door sitting up on that shelf known to all (because it was here that 'Doc' Huested placed our checks, bills and love letters) were three girls.\" The \"girls\" included sisters, Loretta and Sarah Graney, and \"our beloved Ruth 'Bill' Tafft,\" presumably nicknamed for former President William Howard Taft who had vacated the White House in 1913.\n\nWomen began to make their mark at the College during the decade; with only seven girls in the Class of 1916, junior class officers included Betty Noonan as Vice President and Marguerite Rebecca Griffin as Secretary. The first female teacher, Rena Henault '13, was hired in 1917. She assisted Professor Edwin Hutman '91 in the Pharmacy Lab and taught Microscopy and Pharmacognosy with Dr. T.W. Jenkins. Katherine Glavin, who worked at the College for decades, joined the staff as Registrar in 1918.\n\nAs the College grew, sports also were added. A basketball team was formed, with 16 men practicing on the courts at the YMCA. The team only lost one game - to Albany Law School - in the 1916-17 season. The Athletic Association kicked off in 1917 with Dr. Huested as Honorary President.\n\nThe big social event of the year for all students was the Pharmacy Ball thrown by the junior class, which took place at the Ten Eyck Hotel, an up-to-date facility with a restaurant, cafeteria and Oyster Bar. In this classy establishment that sponsored the \"tea dansants\" and \"supper dances\" that were all the rage in the teens, ACP revelers tripped the light fantastic till the wee hours to the music of Zita's Orchestra.\n\nBut in addition to schoolwork and the pursuit of fun, more serious themes began to surface in life at ACP. As the country became more and more embroiled in the events leading up to World War I and the debate on whether or not the nation would remain neutral, students weighed in with their opinions on the situation.\n\n\"Should the United States be called upon to defend the rights so gloriously attained by our forefathers the flame of patriotism would burst forth in the hearts of the pharmacists and they would enlist,\" wrote Raymond Earl Cressler '18. \"They would not shoulder a musket, but they would labor heroically carrying out the instructions of the surgeon to the minutest detail.\"\n\nWhen America entered World War I in 1917, 10,000 Albany men registered for the draft, including many students and alumni of ACP. Eleven members of the Class of 1918 enlisted, as well as four faculty members. The Class of 1919 had 12 of its number fighting and seven members in the Student Army Training Corps. So many of the 48 members of the Epsilon Phi fraternity entered the service that activities were suspended for the next five years.\n\nIn addition, out of 927 members, the ACP Alumni Association had 124 in service, from Lt. Nathan Garnsey '91, to Ford Alysworth '20. Of those, six were killed and one wounded. The AAACP annual banquets now featured patriotic songs such as \"America I Love You\" in place of the raucous toasts of old.\n\nPart of this was due to the fact that many states, including New York, had enacted Prohibition laws as early as 1914. In 1919, when the war ended, soldiers returned to a country that had just passed the 18th Amendment, a nationwide ban of manufacture, sale or transportation of alcohol.\n\nProhibition meant many changes for pharmacists, as it led many people to drink \"legitimate\" alcohol - patent medicines and medical alcohol available by prescription only. According to Albany historian John McEneny, \"the druggists of the city dispensed medicinal alcohol at an alarming rate, both over the counter and out the back door.\"\n\nA writer in The Alembic concluded that \"the druggist is the only business man with whom legislation concerns itself to a greater extent than the liquor dealer.\" One consequence of Prohibition was a rise in the number of soda fountains in pharmacies, which became possible with the introduction of the counter-service fountain in 1903. By 1910, there were more than 100,000 soda fountains across the United States, many serving food as well as sodas and ice cream. Soda fountains provided a socially acceptable alternative to bars and saloons, and the \"soda pop\" they dispensed was thought to be the height of health and modernity. The back of ACP's yearbook advertised the soda fountain and drug store fixtures that were now de rigueur for the modern pharmacy.\n\nThe pharmacy profession was changing in other ways as well. The more stringent requirements and regulations for pharmacists under the new State Pharmacy Law and the passage of the Harrison Narcotics Act of 1914 meant big changes for druggists. Passed under President Wilson, the Act forbade the sale of substantial doses of opiates or cocaine except by licensed doctors and pharmacies, and required prescriptions for all products exceeding allowable limits. It also required pharmacists who dispensed \"narcotics\" to register with the Bureau of Internal Revenue, pay a tax and keep records of the drugs they dispensed.\n\nBoles, who started his first job at a pharmacy in Chestertown in his graduation year of 1920, remembered people lining up at the door in the morning with their prescriptions for morphine and laudanum. During Prohibition, Boles recalled a physician sitting in the local American Legion writing prescriptions for \"medicinal\" alcohol for his friends.\n\nThe new laws may have contributed to the reaction of Dean Tucker, who wrote in 1917:\n\n\"Not many years ago in this state any person might keep a drugstore, there was no licensing of pharmacists, and attendance upon colleges of pharmacy was entirely volitional, for their diplomas conferred no special privileges and were not essential to the securing of a license to practice. But all this is changed and the would-be pharmacist nowadays must pass not only such preliminary examinations as are necessary to obtain his entrance certificate and the various examinations of the school, but also a State Board examination which permits him to do business.\n\n\"In our educational affairs and in the regulation of the professions two dangers threaten us: too much control by the State, whose right to control is conceded, and too much interference by voluntary associations and endowed corporations possessing no right of control whatever and having no jurisdiction at all.\"\n\nBy 1918, after nearly 40 years at the helm of ACP, Dean Tucker was ready to call it quits, though he remained onboard as Honorary Dean.\n\nWilliam Mansfield, Ph.G., Pharm.D., M.A., was appointed as the new leader of the school. An expert botanist and a lover of nature, Dr. Mansfield had previously taught at New York College of Pharmacy and was the author of a number of textbooks on medicinal plants and botany and a frequent contributor to pharmaceutical journals.\n\nAt the same time, the College reorganized, adding faculty and courses and lengthening its hours. For the first time three degrees were offered: a Ph.G. (Graduate in Pharmacy) in two years, Ph.C. (Pharmaceutical Chemist) in three years and a short-lived Bachelor of Science in four years. By the 1919-20 academic year, perhaps due to the war, the latter already had disappeared from the Catalog.\n\nClasses including Vegetable Histology, Chemical and Microscopic Urine Analysis, Bacteriology, English, French and Household Chemistry (food, medicine and cleaning products) were added to the curriculum.\n\nWith pharmacy experience no longer a prerequisite for admission and students able to count their college courses as experience, candidates for a pharmacy degree were freed from working in drug stores for countless hours each week. For the first time, classes were held in the daytime, as well as in the evenings and summers.\n\nAnd, though the war radically decreased the number of attendees, as soon as the soldiers were home again the numbers started to climb. After decreasing from 40 graduates in 1918 to 20 in 1919, by the time the 1919-20 academic year rolled around, the count had risen to 48 seniors. As the decade came to a close, ACP was, once again, short on space.\n\nThe 1920s were a landmark decade in the history of Albany College of Pharmacy and Health Sciences as, in 1927, the school finally gained a brand new home on New Scotland Avenue . At the same time, the Graduate in Pharmacy course was expanded to three years and many extracurricular activities were added for students, making ACP seem like a \"real\" college for the first time.\n\nThe decade got off to an auspicious start with the graduation of future dean Francis J. O'Brien in 1920. That graduation ceremony included four flower girls and a male cheerleader, Gardner Davis '21, who led the crowd in a series of rousing cheers to their new alma mater. The ACP Alumni Association, which took part in the festivities, urged every alumnus to contribute and raise funds to erect a new building, and convened a Tablet Committee to raise funds for a memorial to honor those alumni who had died in World War I.\n\nO'Brien, who was \"quiet but well-liked by his classmates\" according to his friend Ray Boles '20, was hired on as an Instructor in Pharmacy and Mathematics immediately after graduation. In the 1920-21 academic year, he began to make the transition from popular student to popular teacher and, by 1925, had been promoted to Assistant Professor.\n\nThe College celebrated its 40th anniversary in 1921 and ceremonies were held at Chancellor's Hall in the State Education Building. Two of the original founders of ACP were still alive to mark the big event; Willis Gaylord Tucker, who had stepped down as dean in 1918 when Dean William Mansfield arrived, and Gustavus Michaelis, who still served on the Board of Trustees. Alumni and fraternal organizations celebrated in style with dances at local hotels.\n\nBy 1922, ACP boasted three fraternities and a sorority, Lambda Kappa Sigma. After a brief hiatus during and after World War I, the Alpha chapter of the Epsilon Phi fraternity had been rejuvenated that year by Frank A. Squires '22, who joined the College as a faculty member after graduation and continued to be a guiding force for the frat.\n\nThe Beta chapter of Rho Pi Phi Fraternity (known as \"Ropes\") was founded at ACP in 1921 by a \"progressive group of Jewish students.\" Brothers enjoyed \"smokers,\" theater parties, sleigh rides and a pledge dance held at Temple Beth Emeth, as well as an Annual Dinner Dance at the new Hotel Hampton. The first Beta Chapter House opened in 1929 at 185 Warren St. with 13 \"fraters\" in residence.\n\nKappa Psi moved into its own chapter house at 50 Jay St. in 1924 and hosted social functions both at the house and the Albany Yacht Club, where brothers and their guests danced to the tunes of Eddie's Melody Boys in one of the oldest yacht clubs in the nation.\n\nStudents without frat housing lodged off-campus in boarding houses such as the Marcona, which advertised \"furnished rooms and excellent board\" for about $8 a week. Many dined at local establishments like the Hudson Restaurant, where they could get the \"best 40-cent dinner in town,\" or the Oriental Occidental Restaurant on State Street , which offered American or Chinese entrees for 75 cents.\n\nAll of the fraternities, as well as the so-called \"neutrals\" who did not belong to any fraternal groups, competed in the Inter-Class Field Meet when it debuted in 1921. This annual competition among the classes featured track events at Ridgefield Park, baseball at Beverwyck Park and the prize of a silver cup to the class earning the highest point score. In the summer of 2005, Dan Spadaro '23 still remembered his win in the 440-yard relay, but the festivities also included more comical competitions including a three-legged and fat men's race.\n\nBowling and basketball already were established at the school, but by 1922 they had been organized into \"real teams\" with scheduled games and players specially selected to represent the College. Lacking a gymnasium in the Eagle Street building, the basketball team played in Albany High's gym under a coach from the State College. Outfitted in maroon and white, they competed against Albany Law, the YMCA and Rensselaer High. The bowling teams, managed by Professor Seneca Smith, used the YMCA lanes until that building burned down in 1925, when they made the switch to the Palm Garden Alleys.\n\nThe number of students at the College continued to climb each year, swelled by the burgeoning ranks of veterans heading back to ACP to complete their studies after the war. New enrollees climbed from 20 for the Class of 1919 to 48 in 1920 and 58 in 1921. Registration had to be closed at 64 students in July 1922 as there was not enough room for all the applicants.\n\nAfter just 13 years, the College already was outgrowing its second home in the old Humane Society building on Eagle Street.\n\nWith eager students waiting in the wings, ACP could afford to raise its entrance requirements. Students entering in September 1923 for a Ph.G. degree needed to have three years of high school or 54 Regents counts, while those earning a Graduate in Pharmaceutical Chemistry degree (Ph.C.) needed four years. Tuition was raised from $200 to $230-$250 a year, with books averaging $45 for the first year alone.\n\nAs the student body grew, so did the number of non-academic activities. Physical Training, now compulsory under New York State law, was held at the YMCA under director Milton Howard and included calisthenics, jumping, chinning and running. The activities fee of $27 per year included both physical education and Y privileges, including gym shoes, towels and bowling; a yearbook; the junior prom and other dances and free admission to basketball games.\n\nThe Orchestra and Glee Club was founded in 1923 and featured violins and a cello, saxophone, piano, drum and three banjos. Through the efforts of Professor O'Brien and Dean Mansfield, the group made its debut at the ACP Christmas party that December. The concert was broadcast \"for the benefit of the nation\" via WGY in Schenectady and WHAZ in Troy, stations on the air in the very early days of radio.\n\nThe orchestra, billed as the \"last word in syncopation and jazz,\" split off from the singing Glee Club the following year, with the Orchestra continuing to entertain at dances under the direction of Professor Smith. They played at the Commencement Prom, held at Vicentian Hall \"on the line of the Pine Hills trolley cars,\" and ACP revelers tripped the light fantastic to renditions of the Charleston and Black Bottom that were all the rage.\n\nBy 1925 a swim team was established at ACP as many young men were eager to emulate Olympic gold medalist Johnny Weissmuller, who had broken three swimming records in the 1924 Olympics. The team practiced at Public Bath Number 3 every Wednesday evening and grew until members numbered in the twenties. Life Saving classes were offered as well. As the yearbook noted, \"No Weissmullers have been produced as yet, but time will tell.\"\n\nA Student Government was inaugurated that year as well, consisting of a General Committee and two Executive Committees representing the juniors and seniors, still the only two classes at ACP. Chief among their duties was coordination of the Senior Hop and the Junior Prom.\n\nAfter a hiatus of a few years, the yearbook, formerly known as The Alembic, was revived in 1923 as The Pharmakon. Renamed The Alembic Pharmakon the following year, its pages are filled with candid photos of young women with bobbed hair, cloche hats, raccoon coats and short \"flapper\" dresses. Women students, who had gained the right to vote in 1920 with the passage of the Nineteenth Amendment, were busy showing off their new-found freedom and increasingly involved in the life and governance of the College.\n\nMeanwhile, another feature of the \"Jazz Age,\" Prohibition, ground on throughout the decade. It has been estimated that sales of \"medicinal\" alcohol prescribed by doctors and hospitals doubled in the United States between 1923 and 1931. In Albany, speakeasies proliferated and many drugstores clandestinely sold liquor.\n\nHarold McBride '24 noted in the yearbook that \"because the laws of the U.S have placed upon the pharmacist the responsibility of dispensing alcoholic liquors upon physician's prescriptions the exalted position of the druggist has taken a great slump and a great stench has arisen from the profession.\"\n\nHe went on to note that \"pharmaceutical associations are waging a strenuous campaign to place the profession back on its pre-Prohibition plane\" and that \"many colleges of pharmacy require their students to take a pledge to take a stand against alcohol.\"\n\nIn spite of the controversy, or perhaps because of it, students continued to flock to the College and in September 1925, ACP once again had to limit its class size due to cramped quarters. According to the 1926 Catalog, the demand for licensed and junior pharmacists far exceeded the supply and larger salaries were being paid.\n\nThe \"outlook [has] never [been] brighter,\" proclaimed the College.\n\nThough ACP was able to lease space at St. Sophia Hall on Lancaster Street for overflow classes, it was clear that this stopgap measure would not hold for long. Students would \"miss the lecture halls, laboratories, corridors and smoking room\" on Eagle Street, but they were clearly ready for a change.\n\nBy November 1925, at the request of Sen. William T. Byrne and Charles Gibson, President of the College's Board of Trustees, the Albany County supervisors deeded to ACP a plot of land on New Scotland Avenue for the construction of a new College of Pharmacy. The land, located across from Albany Hospital, originally had been the site of a farm for the Albany Alms House.\n\nThe new building, designed by architect Alex Selkirk, was planned as three stories of tapestry brick and limestone for a cost of $300,000, and would accommodate 500 students. Ground was broken May 13, 1926, with the Honorable John Boyd Thacher, Mayor of Albany, presiding. The cornerstone was set by Dr. Charles H. Johnson, Grand Senior Warden of the State Grand Lodge of Masons.\n\nMembers of the Class of 1926 resolved that each graduate would pay the sum of $100 to the Permanent Equipment fund to be used for the facility.\n\nOccupied for the first time in the fall of 1927, the new edifice included labs for Pharmacy, Botany and Materia Medica, Pharmacognosy, Histology and Chemistry; a model pharmacy; an auditorium for 500; a photography room; a library; a gym, complete with showers and locker room; an alumni room and a \"co-ed's\" lounge, furnished with stylish wicker furniture.\n\nThe building wasn't the only new thing that debuted that fall.\n\nA three-year College course of study for the Ph.G. degree kicked off in 1927 with students attending classes for 32 weeks, 39 hours per week each year, for a total of 2,656 hours of instruction. Students completed 1,120 hours of lab work in Botany and Materia Medica, Chemistry and Pharmacy. Those completing university coursework for the Ph.C. degree also took courses in German, Civics, English, Math and Bacteriology. O'Brien was among the early graduates of the revamped program, earning his Ph.C. in 1929.\n\nStudents also got a chance to practice for their new professions in the Model Pharmacy that was incorporated into the College. The \"Union Pharmacy\" was equipped with all of the latest features and included a soda fountain, cash registers and a complete line of drugs and chemicals.\n\nBy 1929, students were able to take a course in Operative Pharmacy Theory and had opportunities to learn about soda fountain maintenance, salesmanship, window displays and arrangement of stock under the guidance of the Professor of Economics. Each graduate wanted to be, as the yearbook put it, \"Mr. Modern druggist, with a well-lit store, appealing and attractive window displays, an elaborate display of merchandise and sanitary white coats bedecking his clerks; all symbolic of modern needs.\"\n\nWith new facilities for meetings and practices, extracurricular activities continued to be added each year and by 1928 included a debating society, a drama club, a girls' chorus and a college newspaper, the Mortar and Pestle, published biweekly under the supervision of Professor Edwin Hutman.\n\nThe spacious auditorium was used for screenings of \"moving pictures\" filmed during ACP's annual field day and Commencement, and for \"radio parties,\" which capitalized on the craze that swept the nation beginning with the first public radio broadcast in the early '20s. The Debate Club took to the stage to spar over topics such as co-education, fraternities and capital punishment, with the first inter-class debate taking sides on \"Active Military Intervention by the U.S. in Nicaragua.\"\n\nSports blossomed at the College as well, with \"an athletic council, coaches and adequate facilities as much a part of the new institution as microscopes and test tubes.\" The baseball team had snappy new uniforms and a cross-country team was organized in 1928. Tennis matches took place at Washington and Ridgefield Parks or on Professor Smith's private court, \"one of the best in the Capital District.\"\n\nThe Rifle Team met every Thursday afternoon at Troop B Armory, just down New Scotland Avenue . Under the eagle eye of Professor Frank Squires, a team of 22 young men competed against RPI and Albany High, among others. Quoits, a game similar to horseshoes that was popular in America during the mid-'20s, also was enjoyed at ACP.\n\nFans went even farther afield to cheer on the ACP teams. In 1928, a busload of students sprang for $5 tickets and headed to New York City to watch the basketball team beat Columbia University , celebrating afterwards with dinner at Beefsteak Charlies'. The Mortar and Pestle even printed pre-approved cheers for the event, including the stirring \"Red, White, Pharmacy, Fight.\"\n\nBoth faculty and students took advantage of other off-campus opportunities as well. ACP delegates, along with several alumni, attended the annual meetings of the New York Pharmaceutical Association at locales such as the Alexandria Bay Hotel in the Thousand Islands and the United States Hotel in Saratoga Springs.\n\nBut just when things seemed to be taking off for the College and its graduates, fate intervened in the form of the Stock Market Crash in October 1929. The Great Depression that followed had serious repercussions for student enrollment as well as for job availability and wages for pharmacists throughout the nation as ACP entered its next decade.\n\nACP entered the 1930s still reeling from the stock market crash of 1929, which had serious repercussions for the school, its students and its graduates. With enrollment down and tuition too steep for many attendees, the College struggled to attract new students. By the fall of 1937, ACP had developed a four-year Bachelor of Science in Pharmacy, hoping to increase the professionalism and prestige of the pharmacy degree, which had suffered greatly during Prohibition.\n\nIn 1930, the population of Albany was 127,000, with 2,000-4,000 Albanians out of work and roughly 25 percent of the population looking for jobs. At ACP, the numbers mirrored what was going on all over the country. There were 150 graduates in 1928, but only 54 students enrolled for the 1931-32 session. By graduation time, the Class of '32 had dropped to only 38 members.\n\nAfter the move to the New Scotland Avenue building in 1927, tuition had been raised from $100 for the Ph.G. and $125 for the Ph.C. to $250 and $300, respectively, a substantial jump. Books averaged about $52 to $65 depending on the program. But higher tuition meant fewer students could afford to attend and the College was struggling.\n\nA 1930 letter written by the ACP Alumni Association Board to Warren Bradt, President of the ACP Board of Trustees, discussed the financial affairs of the College and asked that the Board devise a way to raise funds to pay off College debt and augment the endowment.\n\n\"Despite the unemployment problem now facing the country, our 1930 grads are actively engaged in pharmaceutical pursuits,\" said an article in the Mortar and Pestle. But it wasn't easy.\n\nDuring the 1920s, Ray Boles '20 had been making $3,500 a year as partner in a Chestertown, N.Y., drugstore that sold cosmetics, Adirondack souvenirs and ice cream in addition to \"prescriptions that cost $2 to $3 tops.\" Boles rose at 6:00 a.m. every day to make ice cream, crank- ing out batches every 10 minutes to make up to 40 gallons a day. He put in 14 hour days and worked every holiday, including Christmas. In spite of his diligence, his salary took a nosedive during the Depression, plummeting by $1,000 a year.And Boles was one of the lucky ones.\n\nAn article in the Mortar and Pestle claimed that \"many top notch students are working for $1,200 year.\" In the same article, pharmacy was called the \"most unrenumerative profession in the U.S. ,\" by Charles A. Smullen, a special investigator working for the Pharmacy Bureau of Research, who visited 3,500 retail druggists in 1930.\n\nMortar and Pestle stated that, although the profession would \"never reach a peak of prosperity as a man who spends 3-4 years in College should receive a decent minimum wage.\"\n\nThe grim financial picture forced many Albany residents to seek an escape from reality.\n\nIt was the golden era of movies; the Palace Theater, one of 20 movie theaters in the city, opened in 1931 with seating for 2,800. Works Progress Administration, created in 1935 by President Roosevelt, was responsible for a tremendous upsurge in recreational facilities in Albany. Between 1936 and 1939, 25 public parks, skating rinks, a golf course, Bleeker Stadium, Lincoln Park Pool and several public baths were constructed, many of which were utilized by ACP students for school sports and in their leisure time.\n\nThere was plenty to do both on- and off-campus. The activity fee of $35 covered clubs, sports and three class dances: the Freshman and Senior Hops and the Junior Prom. Under the direction of William Haber, the College Orchestra, a.k.a. \"Banjo Bill and his Pill Rollers,\" provided the music for post-basketball game dances in the school's auditorium. Decked out with colored lights and maroon and white streamers, the room was filled with students swaying to the strains of the latest foxtrots and songs such as \"Collegiate Sam\" and \"Making Whoopee.\"\n\nThe first Press Club Whirl, a fundraising dance held in 1931, benefited a new library at the College as well the school's other literary endeavors, Mortar and Pestle and Alembic Pharmakon .\n\nIn their free time, students dined on \"hamburg steaks at The Wagon,\" \"almost smothered from tobacco smoke\" at Proctor's Theater, dated \"St. Rose girls,\" \"sniffed the lilacs in back of Bender Lab,\" took the \"night boat\" from Albany to New York City and admired \"the observatory in the moonlight\" (Dudley Observatory, founded 1852, was then located across from the College).\n\nBeginning in the fall of 1930, the new Student Council, consisting of Dean Mansfield and two representatives from each Ph.C. and Ph.G. class, had the responsibility for evaluating all \"social, athletic and literary endeavors\" and assigning funds to each. Some, including track, cross country and the \"boy's swim team,\" were discontinued due to lack of interest while others, such as handball, were added. Wildly popular in the New York City area, where thousands of courts were constructed in the five boroughs during the 1930s, handball was introduced to the College by Willard Canfield '32. A court for single-wall handball was created in the gym and a whopping 50 students joined the team.\n\nThe men's basketball, rifle and tennis teams continued to compete while the \"maroon and white sluggers\" used the fields at the \"Lincoln Bowl\" and Ridgefield Park.\n\nOne of the school's oldest and most popular organized sports was bowling. Even after 10 years, students and faculty alike still gathered at Schade's Bowling Academy to watch \"Professor [Francis] O'Brien, with that big cigar in his mouth, throw his famous snake snap.\" Toward the end of the decade, as the number of women students began to increase, they also participated in bowling and ACP took up a full eight lanes.\n\nSome \"girls-only\" activities were voted in as well, most notably tennis and swimming. Formed in 1933, the swim team met Tuesday evenings at the YWCA, though the yearbook noted \"no channel swimmers yet.\" Gertrude Ederle, who in 1926 became the first American woman to swim the English Channel, had an enormous influence on women throughout the country. Citing her as their inspiration, more than 60,000 women earned American Red Cross swimming certificates during the 1920s alone.\n\nIn addition to doling out funds for activities, the Student Council also voted on other issues, including protocol for the wearing of the mandatory \"garnet and white\" caps or \"beanies\" worn by each freshman. After much debate it was decided that \"freshmen be permitted to remove their caps in lectures, recitations and labs but must [keep them] with them and present [them] upon request to upperclassmen.\"\n\nThe fortunes of the fraternities at the school continued to wax and wane throughout the decade, with some becoming inactive and then revitalized depending on membership numbers. The Alpha Theta chapter of Phi Delta Chi formed at ACP on April 13, 1931, with 21 charter members. The chapter grew out of the Alpha Chapter of Epsilon Phi, which had been established at ACP in 1917 but wished to nationalize. By 1936, the group was known as Phi Delta Chi Pharmaceutical and Chemical Fraternity.\n\nKappa Psi Pharmaceutical Fraternity opened a new house on Mercer Street in 1931 and, by 1936, had another fraternity house in the residential section of Madison Avenue. The \"Ropes\" had a busy schedule with an annual roast in the Heldeberg Mountains and dances held in the Rainbow Room of the Kenmore Hotel or aboard the Paradise, a boat moored in the Hudson River at Troy.\n\nAn Interfraternity Smoker sponsored by all three frats was held in 1938 \"for probably the first time in the school's history.\" There was some talk of inviting Lambda Kappa Sigma Sorority, according to the yearbook, \"but it was felt it was 'for men only' and obviously it would be a bit inappropriate.\" With only a few members, the school's sole sorority sponsored more sedate activities such as Bridge Teas and Halloween and Christmas dances. Whether they lived in a fraternity house or not, with no residential facilities on campus most students at ACP rented rooms in the city of Albany. A 1934 Mortar and Pestle survey showed 49.9 percent of students rooming and boarding in Albany and stated that 2-6 students living together could get by on $5 a week.\n\n\"Club Woodlawn,\" right in the neighborhood, was one such communal domicile that was the site of lots of activities and parties. When funds allowed, students congregated at the Fountain Grille and Tap Room on New Scotland Avenue or the Boulevard Cafeteria on Central Avenue to grab a bite to eat.\n\nEspecially during the Depression, which dragged on until 1941 and the start of World War II, many students could not afford to rent in Albany and commuted in each day, sometimes from quite a distance.\n\nWhen Russell Denegar '43 began classes at ACP in 1938, he commuted from Germantown, N.Y., by train. After arriving at Union Station in Albany, Denegar, who later became Associate Dean of the College, hopped a trolley on Broadway and rode up Madison Avenue to connect with the New Scotland Avenue bus. Classmates Walter Henning of Rhinebeck and Allan MacCollam of Kingston took the same train, though MacCollam had to take a ferry across the Hudson to catch it!\n\nIn spite of his struggle to pay his tuition, Denegar remembered that \"the College was as bad off financially as myself and was reluctant to dismiss anyone as long as there was hope that payment might be forthcoming.\" Although he was sure others were in the same predicament, it seemed to him that Miss Glavin, ACP's longtime Registrar who had been with the College since 1918, \"spent most of her time pursuing me.\"\n\nIn addition to the Depression, Prohibition, until its repeal in 1933, was another issue that continued to affect ACP.\n\nIn an Alembic Pharmakon survey, 54 of 55 polled students did not approve of Prohibition, which had seriously tarnished the image of pharmacists. Because they were legally allowed to dispense alcohol, \"pharmacy has attracted a large amount of pseudo-pharmacists, many of whom were former liquor dealers\" and a \"stigma rests upon the entire profession,\" said a 1931 Mortar and Pestle article. Another article that same year claimed \"a pharmacist is nothing more than a dignified bootlegger.\"\n\nFor this reason, both students and faculty strongly felt that standards must be raised and began to advocate for a four-year Bachelor of Science degree that \"would go a long way toward giving pharmacy the respect it should have.\"\n\nBy 1932, 38 states had compulsory four-year courses for pharmacy colleges. ACP followed suit in 1937 and introduced its own B.S. that fall, creating a sophomore class for the first time in the school's history. The B.S. offered more liberal arts and sciences with history, English, psychology and sociology in the curriculum in addition to comparative anatomy and zoology. It also fully met the requirements for pre-med, pre-osteopathic and pre-law certificates, and strove to eliminate the surplus of pharmacists with stricter entrance requirements.\n\nThe courses of instruction in the new program fell into the departments of Pharmacy, Material Medica, Chemistry and Economics, which included offerings such as pharmaceutical sign writing, bookkeeping and commercial law. Courses in pharmaceutical and scientific German, political science and mathematics also were added.\n\n1937 also brought some sad changes for ACP, most notably the death of longtime faculty member Edwin Cunningham Hutman '91. \"Prof\" Hutman taught at the College for 35 years and, according to the yearbook, died \"in the saddle\" while proctoring an exam.\n\nHutman's death meant the temporary demise of Mortar and Pestle, as he had been the paper's long-time advisor. It was replaced for a short time in the late '30s by the Dame Rumour, \"published biweekly by the co-eds of ACP-Union\" and reflective of the burgeoning number of young women at the school. In the 1938-39 academic year, the Catalog noted that \"girls who do not wish to enter the field of retail pharmacy may prepare themselves for the position of hospital pharmacist\" and a Clinical Laboratory Technician track was added to the Pharmacy program, the precursor of the Bachelor of Science in Medical Technology that came in the 1940s.\n\nThe program's curriculum included sterilization and media preparation, pathology, histologic technique, bacteriology, serology, biological chemistry, urine analysis and hematology in addition to the regular pharmacy subjects. Graduates of the program, conducted largely at neighboring Bender Laboratory, earned the B.S. in Pharmacy and, upon the completion of laboratory and practical hospital work, a Clinical Laboratory Technician Certificate.\n\nThe late '30s in general were a time of few activities, clubs and sports at ACP. Before it stopped publishing, articles in Mortar and Pestle decried the lack of school spirit. Even the class banquets were not well attended, perhaps due to the cost. The activity fee was lowered from $35 to $20, probably due to the decrease in services and the financial affairs of many students.\n\nAt ACP, the Orchestra, Glee Club, tennis and swimming all bit the dust during the decade and were replaced by pastimes such as the Camera Club, Student Pharmaceutical Association and yearly trips to the Eli Lilly plant in Indianapolis. By 1939, even handball was gone, replaced by ping pong, made newly popular with the formation of the U.S. Table Tennis Association in 1935. Students played in the boys' lounge in between classes, competing against top players Arnold Shapiro and Leo Katzman.\n\n\"Everyone goes down to smoking room to watch ping pong and play the radio-victrola,\" said the yearbook.\n\nOne exciting new addition to the school in 1938 was the historic O.B. Throop Drugstore, which was moved \"lock, stock and barrel\" from Schoharie, N.Y. , and reassembled at ACP as a pharmacy museum. Located near the modern Union Pharmacy at the College, it occasioned one writer to note that \"two flights of stairs span more than a century of the art of pharmacy.\" The old store, established in 1800 by Jabez W. Throop, had colorful show globes in the windows and was stocked with apothecary jars and drawers filled with remedies like bloodroot and boneset. The '30s also brought several of ACP's alumni into influential new roles.\n\nFrancis O'Brien '20, who had received his Master's degree in 1936 and was working on a Ph.D. at Fordham University, was promoted to head of the Department of Pharmacy in 1939 and eventually became ACP's Dean in 1943. The College's 1927 building now bears O'Brien's name.\n\nAlso in 1939, long-time Board of Trustees Chair Warren Lansing Bradt died and was succeeded by Wardle had been on the ACP Board since 1914 and also served on the State Board of Pharmacy and as President of the New York State Pharmaceutical Association. ACP's 1956 Wardle Wing honored his decades of service to the Board.\n\nAnother ACP graduate made his mark not only on the College, but on the world as well. Rudolph Blythe '31 established the first pharmaceutical laboratory in the United States during a long career with Smith, Kline and French. He was nominated for the Nobel Prize for his pioneering work on the time-release capsule. In a classic understatement, the 1931 yearbook noted, \"Rudy has a future if he keeps on at his present rate.\" In 2000, ACP's administrative and library wing was dedicated to Dr. Blythe, who served as a Trustee of the school. Dr. Blythe died in July 2005 at the age of 95.\n\nArthur S. Wardle '00. As ACP entered its next decade, some of the College's most influential leaders were sowing the seeds that would shape the school's destiny for years to come.\n\nThe 1940s at ACP began much as the 1930s had, with the College struggling to keep its head above water due to the corrosive effects of the Great Depression. All that changed on December 7, 1941, when the Japanese bombed Pearl Harbor and the United States entered World War II.\n\nThe departure of many of its young men to enlist in the armed forces and the influx of young women into the new Medical Technology program irrevocably changed the face of ACP during the decade.\n\nIn May 1941, the “Playboys of ’41,” an all-male class of 24 students, graduated as the first class to complete the new four-year Bachelor of Science in Pharmacy. Little were they to know that theirs would be the last four-year class for some time to come as ACP adapted to a world at war.\n\nOn December 7, 1941, Jimmy Dorsey and his band were advertised at Albany’s Palace Theatre and Charlie Chaplin’s film The Great Dictator was being shown at the Leland. The Christmas tree in Capitol Park was to be lit the following day in the traditional kickoff to the city’s holiday season.\n\nThat afternoon, Russ Denegar ’43 was alone in his apartment near Washington Park, studying for an exam and listening to the radio. Suddenly the music was interrupted by a news bulletin about the bombing of Pearl Harbor and he “knew that the world was really turned upside down.” The war was to change everything.\n\nThe next evening, the ACP junior and a friend went to visit his favorite professor, Francis O’Brien, Ph.D., to ask for advice. “Stay in college and try to graduate before enlisting,” Dr. O’Brien told them.\n\nAs blackouts and air raid drills commenced in Albany, Pathe newsreels screened in the theaters and Civil Defense wardens roamed the streets in pancake helmets, ACP made plans of its own to deal with the effects of the war.\n\n“The Class of 1942 will depart from the comparative tranquility of academic life and enter a world at war,” said the yearbook. “Our lot will not be an easy one … but in our hearts is the fervent prayer that our specialized training will enable each of us to contribute in some small degree to the common cause of humanity not only ‘for the duration’ for but the years to follow.”\n\nEven as the Class of ’42 graduated, the student body was readying itself for big changes.\n\nAn essay in the yearbook estimated that 15,000 pharmacists or more would be needed to serve the expanded army and navy, with additional responsibility thrust upon pharmacists by the withdrawal of approximately 40,000 doctors, 13,000 dentists and 35,000 nurses from civilian practice.\n\n“Pharmacists will be called on to dispense more than ever as doctors at home become increasingly busy,” it went on to say, and would be further challenged by an “acute shortage of drugs … and an increased call upon them for medical advice.”\n\nDean William Mansfield made the decision to accelerate classes so that students could finish their schooling before going off to war. Classes were scheduled during the summer and commenced in June 1942, after only a two-week break, thus enabling the junior class to graduate in January rather than June 1943.\n\n“Diminishing classes and the cessation of summer vacations definitely brought the war closer to all of us,” said Denegar.\n\nThe decision had repercussions, not only for students’ workloads, but also their finances.\n\nWith virtually no summer vacation to get a job and many places of employment closed due to the war, Denegar found himself in a tricky financial situation. He gave up his apartment in Albany and began the long commute from his home in Germantown via train and trolley. Fortunately, a new government loan program helped with tuition and he continued with his job washing test tubes and filling bottles in the ACP lab.\n\nThe Class of ’43 became the first to graduate in January of that year under the new accelerated program, with the valedictory address delivered by Richard Phalen, tagged “Dr. Huer” by his classmates because of his resemblance to a character in the Buck Rogers comics. The Alumni Reunion Banquet also was “accelerated” and took place at the Ten Eyck Hotel on January 18 at 8:30 p.m., Eastern War Time.\n\nIn spite of the new schedule, many students did not have a chance to complete their coursework, though some joined the Army Reserve Corps in the hopes that they would be able to finish up before being called into active service. Private Carl Bevilacqua, who started out with the Class of ’44, was one of the first pharmacy students in the state called to the service of his country. Soon after, 13 other students were called up as well and class numbers continued to decrease as the months went on.\n\nThe war changed the face of ACP in many ways.\n\nIn 1943, Dr. O’Brien replaced Mansfield as dean of the College and was tasked with the difficult job of keeping the school afloat during the most difficult crisis it had ever faced.\n\nThe College was in rough shape financially; the long years of the Depression with few students were further exacerbated by the war. Denegar, who had been hired at ACP in 1944 as an instructor in pharmacy and mathematics, remembered that there were periods when Dean O’Brien did not take his salary and the payroll was supplemented by contributions from a board member.\n\nWith the bank threatening to take over the mortgage, the new dean predicted that the post-war years would bring in many returning servicemen and a new beginning for ACP. The school steadfastly hung on.\n\nthe yearbook was chock full of photos of men in the uniforms of the army, navy and marines. With graduating classes in both January and June, the Class of 1944, was reduced to only 15 graduates, six of them women.\n\nLuckily, due to the Medical Technology program, by 1944 there were 25 “girls” at ACP and for the first time, ACP classes contained more women than men. Without their tuition dollars, the College probably would not have made it through the war years.\n\nThe Class of ’45, the first to be totally accelerated, was set to graduate in two years and eight months. Even so, the class went through three sets of officers; each time elections were held, the winners were drafted.\n\nBy the time the Class of ’46 graduated, with only six members, it was deemed to be “the smallest in the history of the College,” save the first graduating class in 1882.\n\nThere were shortages of material goods as well as students. A “Victory Garden,” cultivated by the botany classes of Professor John Dwyer provided cabbage, tomatoes and spinach for a very practical lesson. Students shivered through the state boards, held in the school auditorium, due to a shortage of heating materials, and the Alumni Association pitched in to collect $3,500 for a Coal Conversion Fund.\n\nIntramural basketball and tennis were the only sports as teams could not travel to games because of gasoline rationing. Even the popular Camera Club was put on the back burner because of the unavailability of film.\n\nOther clubs and fraternal organizations languished due to lack of personnel and funding, though a few bravely soldiered on through the war years. Activities in general tended to be more serious; the Alumni Association recruited prospective students, sponsored Red Cross First Aid courses and tried to gather information on the status of alumni in any branch of the armed services. Albany Mayor Erastus Corning was the featured speaker at the Alumni Banquet in 1943, shortly before he entered the army as an infantryman private.\n\nIn spite of the gloomy times and accelerated schedule, life at ACP was not all work and no play.\n\nStudents hung out at the Washington Tavern and Ralph’s and bought meal tickets to eat at the Deluxe Restaurant on Madison Avenue. There were botany hikes with Professor Dwyer in McKown’s Grove in Guilderland, informal tennis tournaments and even a boat trip to Kingston. Activities for women continued to flourish; Lambda Kappa Sigma sponsored hay rides and dances and the girl’s bowling team had 10 members.\n\nIn 1945, the Alumni Association did not hold its annual spring meeting due to transportation restrictions. That year, nearly 300 ACP alumni were in the armed services. Those that remained at home rallied round their alma mater, “creating a reserve fund to overcome the deficits occasioned by the present limited enrollment.”\n\nAnd still the war ground on.\n\nThen “one hot August night the girls of the class were taking out the fellows as part of a sorority initiation when the V.J. announcement came through [over the radio], resulting in a sudden change of plan.” It was August 14, 1945, also known as “Victory over Japan Day,” and the war was over. By the time Japan formally surrendered on September 2, things already had started to change for ACP.\n\nIn October 1945 “the doors opened to a new era of well being, crowded classrooms and noisy halls.” Dean O’Brien had been right. The G.I. Bill, officially known as the Servicemen’s Readjustment Act of 1944, provided tuition and stipends for living expenses to returning veterans to attend college or trade school.\n\nNearly 10 million servicemen in the U.S. took advantage of the benefits before the program was phased out.\n\nThe first post-war class contained 70-plus ’49ers, forcing Dean O’Brien to “unlock the auditorium to accommodate the large class” and turn the “boy’s lounge” into a classroom rather than a smoking room. So many vets joined the ranks of ACP students that more than half of the freshmen class was made up of ex-servicemen and 42 percent of the male and female students were married.\n\nAnother freshmen class was added during the second semester to accommodate the overflow; soon there were 120 new students for the Bachelor of Science programs in Pharmacy and Medical Technology.\n\nThe Med Tech program went from a three-year certificate program to a four-year Bachelor of Science program in 1945, with three years spent at ACP and one full year at Bender Laboratory across the street, under Director John J. Clemmer, M.D., and his staff. Eventually, the third year was spent at Bender and the fourth at Brady Hospital, Wasserman Lab or another local facility.\n\nFor the first time, the program was not limited to “girls only” and the Class of 1949 contained two male Med Tech majors.\n\nWith all of the “co-eds” on campus, more activities for women were added. In 1947, a Girl’s Club was formed with the first scheduled event a “Bacon Bat” at Thacher Park. Similar to a marshmallow roast, students feasted on sandwiches after toasting the bacon on sticks over a fire. The club also sponsored a sleigh ride down Western Avenue for 25 couples (with a chaperone, of course), a picnic at Sand Lake and trips to historic sites such as the Van Buren House in Kinderhook. A signature event for the club was the popular weekly “Coke Party.”\n\nLambda Kappa Sigma sorority was reactivated and sponsored a Valentine’s Hop with the newly revitalized frats. Kappa Psi was back to full membership for first time since 1941, Rho Pi Phi was reactivated in the spring of 1945 and Phi Delta Chi was restarted by a group of energetic veterans in late 1946.\n\nOther clubs and sports made their reappearance as well.\n\nThe Mortar and Pestle and Student Council returned, as did the Camera Club, with 50 active members. Bowling and basketball were back, with the addition of an “efficient and competent” cheerleading squad sporting red and white outfits and saddle shoes.\n\nThe bowling team joined the Intercollegiate League of the Capital District when it was formed in 1948, while the basketball team became a member of the new Empire State Conference that same year. In 1949, an Athletic Commission was formed to handle the nitty-gritty details of the burgeoning sports program.\n\nNew activities, including a fledgling student branch of the American Pharmaceutical Association, a Dramatic Club and a Chess Club, gave students even more options. And the social whirl was once again in full swing with a Campus Queen Dance, Corn Hop, St. Patrick’s Day Dance, Junior Prom and square dances in “dungarees.”\n\nOf course, there were lots of informal get-togethers to encourage the “ole college spirit” complete with “be-bop” music and snacks of “Dagwood sandwiches,” named for the 1930s comic strip character.\n\nActivities were not limited to campus. Beginning in 1947, juniors and seniors traveled to the Eli Lilly headquarters in Indianapolis during spring vacation, where they lived “the life of kings for two days.” In 1949, students visited Parke-Davis in Detroit.\n\nThings certainly were looking up for ACP by 1949, when the yearbook commented on one of several new faculty members hired to deal with the influx in students. The recently graduated Walter Singer ’48 was assigned to teach chemistry and “all kinds of expressions greeted Professor Singer as he rose to the challenge of teaching the first class in chemistry to the Class of ’52.”\n\nLittle did they know at the time that Dr. Singer would go on to become one of the most significant members of the ACP community.\n\nAfter a somewhat rocky start, the 1950s brought prosperity for ACP, with enrollment numbers still high and a large number of veterans from both World War II and the Korean war attending classes. By 1956, with the prospect of a new five-year degree in pharmacy on the horizon, the College broke ground on a new wing, creating more space and marking the school's Diamond Jubilee.\n\nWhen the United States entered the Korean war on June 27, 1950, Dean Francis O'Brien '20 told the Class of '51 that \"in 1947 when you entered, the world was in an immediate post-war period and appeared to be on the verge of a long era of peace and prosperity.\"\n\nThat era of peace turned out to be very short-lived and students once again put aside their books to enlist. However, after the Korean war ended in July 1953, veterans flocked back to the College under the G.I. Bill and ACP regained its equilibrium. Once again the students were older, rather than newly minted high school graduates, and many of them were married as well.\n\nThe medical technology program was in full swing, and especially busy after a Blood Bank opened at Bender Laboratory and made its services available to the Albany chapter of the American Red Cross for collection of blood for the armed services. With 100 pints of blood collected each week as well as pathology tests for various area hospitals, there was plenty of work for the med tech students who spent their junior year at Bender lab.\n\nMed techs initially paid the same $375 tuition as the rest of the students, though that dropped to $275 for the year at Bender. Tuition was waived for the fourth year of practical experience at one of the local hospitals.\n\nThe American Society of Clinical Pathology, which certified medical technicians, projected that by 1960, 50,000 certified med techs would be needed in the United States. Although men were admitted to ACP's program, it was populated primarily by young women, though more and more of them switched to the B.S. in pharmacy as the decade wore on.\n\nAs a 1954 article in Mortar and Pestle said, \"for the single girl, pharmacy offers a career where she is able to work 40-50 hours a week at a comfortable wage.\" The upsurge in enrollment meant the need for new facilities, as well as more and revitalized sports and activities at the College. The Alumni Association worked to equip a new library and raised $5,000 toward that end. A new librarian, Dr. Sourya Hainebach, was hired in 1950 and impressed the students with her glamorous past as a fighter with the French Underground during World War II.\n\nSports really began to take off at ACP during the '50s. Most significantly, the decade ushered in a new coach and a new era for the basketball team.\n\nWith the arrival of Albert M. White in the fall of 1952, the Panthers went on to 13 consecutive winning seasons on the court. So popular was the sport under \"Wizard\" White that the school added a junior varsity team, intramural basketball and a cheerleading squad, and strengthened the Athletic Commission under his leadership, all in the name of building better teams for the future.\n\nIn the 1953-54 season, the team had a 13-2 record with captain Harry Mikhitarian '54 scoring at a pace of 22.1 points per game. By the sixth consecutive winning season under coach White, in 1956-57, the buses were filled to the brim for away games and the gym could barely contain the overflow crowds, who roared their approval during spirited pep rallies. Captain Gordon Dailey '57, with 267 points, and his teammates were feted by the College's trustees with a banquet at the University Club that spring.\n\nThe following year, the first Alumni Basketball Dinner was organized by the Alumni Association to honor ACP's outstanding team. The \"Future Pharmacists\" were lauded, not only by Dean O'Brien and their professors, but also by sportswriters for the Knickerbocker News and Times Union . It had been the greatest year ever for top scorer Frank Viviani '58 and the Panthers, who won 13 games in a row before dropping the last heartbreaking encounter to the University of Connecticut. Panther \"Cubs,\" the junior varsity team, were part of the newly formed Capital District Conference. With their own JV cheerleading squad, the team rode to and from games in style in a 1935 Ford under coach Win Dobbins.\n\nOther sports at the College flourished as well. Two returning vets rebuilt the bowling team in the early '50s and hit the lanes at the Playdium Bowling Center on Ontario Street weekly. Intramural programs included an impressive six basketball teams, ping pong, golf, tennis and softball. Those interested in varsity sports other than basketball or bowling could join the varsity football, baseball, swimming and hockey teams at Union College.\n\nThe three fraternities and the Lambda Kappa Sigma sorority all had healthy rosters in the '50s, sometimes referred to as the \"Golden Age\" of Greek life, and actively were involved in the social life of the school. In 1954, an Interfraternity Council was formed with representatives from each group and the IFC Dance and other activities became an integral part of College life.\n\nIn addition, Rho Pi Phi sponsored the Campus Queen Dance, Kappa Psi the Sweetheart Formal and Phi Delta Chi a Winter Wonderland Dance, while Lambda Kappa Sigma held a Halloween Hop, \"coke parties\" and a Mother-Daughter Banquet.\n\nThe Girls' Club started off the decade with upwards of 50 members and held a tea for all the \"girls\" as well as faculty and student wives. Though they optimistically bought a set of cups for future events, the club disbanded in 1950. They threw their annual picnic that year under the banner of the Lambda Kappa Sigma sorority, who continued the tradition through the decade and absorbed many of the club's members.\n\nOther intellectual, religious and social pursuits were popular during the decade as well. The Newman Club, emphasizing Catholic culture and fellowship, formed in the 1950-51 academic year and was followed shortly thereafter by the Student Christian Association. Both groups had very large memberships and held events such as St. Patrick's Day dances and square dances.\n\nMusic and dancing played a big part in the life of ACP through the '50s. The Glee Club was revived in the1953-54 academic year after a lapse of 24 years, with Alvin Strack as pianist. The co-ed group, with 20 members, performed in its first program at the holiday festivities in 1953.\n\nProfessor Walter Singer '48, the Glee Club advisor, was referred to in the yearbook as the \"professor of bop,\" a reference to the wildly popular bebop music that exploded on the scene at the end of World War II. Impromptu jitterbug contests were held during dances, and when Bill Haley's \"Rock Around the Clock\" debuted in 1955, students enthusiastically embraced rock 'n roll as well.\n\nOther school activities included the Camera Club, which faithfully documented daily life at the College, and Mortar and Pestle, which celebrated its Silver Anniversary in 1952 with a new magazine-type format.\n\nThe Student Council not only dealt with the budgets for all of these clubs but also with weighty issues such as the \"smoking problem in the lower corridor\" and the \"rhubarb in the cafeteria.\"\n\nThe Student Branch of the American Pharmaceutical Association (APhA) at ACP claimed 100 new members by 1952. Rudolph Blythe, a 1931 graduate, made a presentation to the club in 1952 at the Petit Paris, a popular Albany restaurant, to discuss his latest research at Smith, Kline & French. Dr. Blythe spoke about his pioneering work with time-release capsules, which hit the market as \"Spansule capsules\" in 1952.\n\nWith a direct wire hook up to the Founder's Day Centennial Program in Washington, D.C. , and an LP (long-playing) recording of the convention in Philadelphia , APhA members were able to listen in on such timely topics as \"National Defense and the Health Professions\" and \"Medical Effects of the Atomic Bomb.\"\n\nThough the '50s are often thought of as a quiet and prosperous decade during which many American families moved to the suburbs, national defense was on everyone's minds. The Alembic Pharmakon weighed in on issues such as \"The Role of Pharmacy in Civil Defense\" and the \"ever impending phantasm of a possible enemy attack,\" including a hydrogen bomb or chemical warfare. Mortar and Pestle published an article on \"Fall-out Fever\" and the like. The College even had its own Red Cross unit beginning in the spring of 1950, with volunteers assigned to the Motor Corps Service and learning first aid.\n\nSometimes students could see the humor in the otherwise dire situation. The yearbook included a tongue-in-cheek spoof on \"What to Do in Case of an Air Raid,\" supposedly issued by Professor Walter \"Duck and Cover\" Singer.\n\nOther grim realties marred the decade as well.\n\nPolio had killed more than 1,300 Americans, primarily children, and crippled more than 18,000 of them in 1954 alone. That year the ACP`s basketball team sponsored a Polio Benefit game with proceeds donated to National Foundation of Infantile Paralysis. By the time the Salk vaccine was developed in 1955 and the federal government implemented a plan to have the vaccine produced by six pharmaceutical companies, Mortar and Pestle was weighing in on the topic and the need for more pharmacists to go into research.\n\nThe trend in general during the '50s was away from solely retail pharmacy and toward a greater percentage of pharmacists entering hospital, research, government, manufacturing and pharmaceutical sales. The \"outlook for pharmacists was very good\" according to Mortar and Pestle , and the push for a five-year program at the College continued.\n\nPharmaceutical companies competed fiercely to attract graduates to jobs in the industry and ACP students were wined and dined royally on their trips to visit Winthrop Sterling, Lederle Laboratories, Abbott, Eli Lilly and Parke-Davis.\n\nOn a spring trip to the Midwest to visit Lilly and Parke-Davis, the students departed from Albany's Union Station on the Advance Empire Express in their own car. Upon arrival in Detroit, they were put up at the palatial Book-Cadillac Hotel courtesy of Parke-Davis, which feted them with a \"charcoaled sirloin steak\" dinner at which the \"ladies received orchids and the gentlemen mortar and pestle lapel pins.\"\n\nStudents had fun closer to home as well and took full advantage of the dining, drinking and dancing establishments in ACP's neighborhood.\n\nAt Mike's Log Cabin, on North Swan, they feasted on spaghetti, while Calsolaro's on Washington Avenue was favored for pizza, both dishes popularized by World War II veterans who had served in Italy.\n\nFrats held their dinners at Lombardo's and Jack's downtown while more informal student evenings took place at Papa's Restaurant, Sol's University Sandwich Shop and The Fountain on New Scotland.\n\nThe dart leagues at both Riley's and Larry's Bar, on the corner of New Scotland and Madison, saw a lot of action during the decade as well. Alan Rand '56 remembered playing for beer tokens at Larry's and winning so many games that, as a non-imbiber, he was able to turn over 500 tokens to his fellow classmates on graduation day!\n\nOutdoor activities included hayrides, toboggan parties at Albany Municipal Golf course and an onslaught of picnics in the spring, beginning with \"McGaugh's Thaw\" and commencing with hot dog roasts at Thacher Park and softball games at Six Mile Waterworks.\n\nThough the College still had no dormitories, there was a lot of \"at home\" activity at fraternity houses and apartments scattered throughout the ACP neighborhood.\n\n\"Rope Hall,\" the Rho Pi Phi chapter house, was home to many of the brothers, while other students lived off-campus in a variety of accommodations, some arranged by the school, for a cost of about $22 a week. One 1952 graduate remembered her landlady's first words as \"no men, no liquor, no smoking\" but students seemed to have fun in spite of the advice!\n\nBy the late '50s, with more and more students owning cars and having access to the newly completed New York State Thruway, the student population at ACP began to change from a mostly local base as undergraduates streamed in from farther flung areas of the state. The College parking lots filled with the cars such as the \"famous yellow and black convertible\" of Mel Friedland '58, and students sought out cheap apartments in the neighborhood including \"Clubhouse 35\" on New Scotland Avenue, the \"84 Grove headquarters\" and the \"Pinochle Palace\" on Glendale .\n\nBack on campus, in both the \"boys' and girls' Lounges,\" students spent the time between classes playing hearts and pinochle, all the while smoking copious amounts of cigarettes.\n\nBy 1955, with the largest freshmen class in many years enrolled and the announcement that the B.S in pharmacy at ACP would go to a five-year program in 1960, the College knew it had to do something to ease the crush. Though Dean O'Brien expressed some worry about the \"quarter of a million dollars\" needed for a new addition, the school plowed bravely ahead with its plans.\n\nGround was broken on June 6, 1956, for a Diamond Jubilee Wing, just in time to mark the 75th anniversary of the College and prepare for an expected increase in enrollment to 120 students in each freshmen class. The two-story wing would tie the old building to the future, with new classrooms, student and faculty dining halls, labs for physics and pharmacology/anatomy and a lab prep room.\n\nThe new wing was dedicated October 13, 1957, to Arthur Wardle, long-time president of the board of trustees. One of the most popular features was a \"modern cafeteria with tables and ash trays\" and food provided by \"Kirkpatrick Caterers.\"\n\nOswald and Margaret Kirkpatrick had arrived at the College in 1951, Ossie as superintendent of campus facilities and \"Mrs. K.\" as manager of the cafeteria, which at the time was a small room off the gym with a limited menu and seating facilities. With their Scottish accents, humor and small kindnesses, the Kirkpatricks were well-loved by both faculty and students, who often stopped by their on-campus apartment for a bit of conversation and a piece of shortbread.\n\nWhen the Wardle Wing was added, Mrs. K. ruled over the new cafeteria, which had a capacity of 120, providing home-cooked food to thousands of students until she retired as cafeteria manager in 1971. She stayed on at the school, helping Ossie with the building and grounds thereafter, and they resided at ACP until Ossie's death in 1993 and Margaret's in 1996.\n\nAnother valuable feature of the new addition was the anatomy lab, which eliminated \"the brisk march, in the chill of the morn, to the 'cat morgue' behind the old building.\" Students joked that previously when they \"received [their] neatly wrapped package of Felis domestica, they looked like waiters, going to and from the garage\" but with a new walk-in, temperature-regulated refrigerator complete with exhaust system, both the walk and the \"odor\" were eliminated.\n\nThe new wing would not only allow for increased enrollment, but would provide the facilities for an increased emphasis on the sciences at ACP, which mirrored what was going on in schools throughout the nation in response a couple of momentous events that occurred in 1957.\n\nHistory changed on October 4 of that year when the Soviet Union successfully launched Sputnik I, the world's first artificial satellite. The launch ushered in new political, military, technological and scientific developments and marked the start of the space age and the American-Soviet space race.\n\nAt ACP, the 1958 yearbook had a space-age theme and talked about responsibilities of the pharmacist in the age of \"Sputniks and Explorers.\" Even the basketball team was pictured against a starry night sky and drawings of rockets and \"spacemen\" abounded throughout. Both faculty and students ardently debated how \"modern day advances into outer space [would] affect pharmacy in the future.\"\n\nPopular pharmacy professor Burdette Dewell predicted that a customer might have a prescription \"not for Dramamine for a trip to Europe but for Drug x-2000 to permit his body to adjust itself to the new conditions of travel in outer space.\"\n\nGeorge O'Connell '58 felt \"pharmacists would be expected to advise physicians caring for space travelers. . Drugs will have to be sought to overcome the boredom and mental fatigue encountered by the spacemen, thus pushing pharmacy ahead with these new discoveries.\"\n\nIt was the age of the atom and of radioactive drugs.\n\n\"In the era of uncertainty in world affairs, it is more important than ever that the pharmacist take an active part in the local civic defense program,\" said the Alembic Pharmakon.\n\n1957 also introduced another factor that influenced the future of pharmacy. The New York Times published an article that year describing an influenza epidemic in Hong Kong that sickened 250,000 people in a very short period. The 1958 yearbook referred to the time from November 1957 to January 1958 as the \"Asian Flu dog days.\" They marked not just an illness, but also the first time that the rapid global spread of a modern influenza virus was available for laboratory investigation.\n\nBy 1959, Dean O'Brien was talking about other factors that were contributing to a \"changed era\" in the profession.\n\nThe number of pharmacies was decreasing in proportion to the number of pharmacists and the population as a whole. There was a trend toward larger pharmacies and the \"one-man pharmacy\" had almost disappeared from urban centers. Pharmacies were devoted more to the \"professional aspect\" rather than merchandising of items such as cosmetics and sundries. Lastly, there was a strong demand by hospitals and laboratories for people with scientific pharmaceutical training.\n\nIn response to these trends, by 1958 ACP students had formed a student affiliate of the American Chemical Society to introduce students to the \"professional side\" of pharmacy and the technical skills necessary for a career in pharmaceutical chemistry.\n\nWith a major push toward the sciences and away from retail pharmacies, gone were the days when ACP students learned soda fountain maintenance and how to wrap a package. It was a new era and, with a new five-year program set to debut in 1960, ACP would be ready for it.\n\nThe 1960s were a time of turmoil and change throughout the nation, as the United States increasingly became involved in the war in Vietnam , the Civil Rights movement heated up and charismatic leaders President John F. Kennedy, Robert Kennedy and Martin Luther King, Jr., were assassinated.\n\nIn downtown Albany , the '60s brought demonstrations against the war and for Civil Rights. The decade also brought the demolition of a large tract of property in the center of Albany for the South Mall, Gov. Nelson Rockefeller's controversial brainchild built as an administrative center for state government. By the time the large-scale project was completed, 7,000 people had been displaced and more than 1,500 buildings had been demolished, including Albany College of Pharmacy's first and second homes on Eagle Street.\n\nAt ACP, the decade was marked by two important events: a new five-year degree in pharmacy was launched in 1960, and 1967 introduced a new dean, Walter Singer '48.\n\nWith the Bachelor of Science in Pharmacy now a five-year program, students could begin at ACP or study for the first two years at an accredited College of Arts and Sciences and transfer in for the \"professional years,\" as long as the curriculum was approved by the dean. The B.S. in Medical Technology was still a four-year program that prepared students to take the licensing exam given by the American Society of Clinical Pathologists. Courses fell into the departments of Pharmacy, Pharmacy Administration, Pharmacology, Pharmacognosy and Biological Sciences, Physical Sciences and Mathematics, Liberal Arts and Medical Technology. Tuition was raised to $600 a year and, although there were no dorms, students could expect to pay about $1,200 for room and board for the year. Many rented single rooms in the neighborhood, and the cafeteria, in the capable hands of Margaret Kirkpatrick, was open five days a week with meals available for $2 a day.\n\nBy the end of the decade, tuition had risen to $1,000 a year and many students were renting their own apartments to save on expenses.\n\nOnce the five-year program became fully operative in September 1964, that additional year of schooling meant an entire extra class of 100-plus students and overcrowding became a real problem. The Rho Pi Phi fraternity came up with some suggestions to relieve the congestion, including one-way traffic in the halls and on the stairs, outdoor furniture outside the cafeteria to handle lunchtime overflow and a more active Interfraternity Council to alleviate the stresses and strains between competing groups.\n\nWith the influx of new students, one controversial subject was violations of the dress code, as spelled out in Article 18 of the General College Rules. Many students decried the fact that \"dress shirts, jackets and ties are being discarded in favor of sports shirts and sweaters.\" The student newspaper, the Mortar and Pestle, came down hard on students for \"leaving dirty coffee cups filled with ashes for Mrs. K. to clean up\" and noted that students were \"too lazy to walk 200 feet from the card room\" for basketball tryouts. In general, it seemed that many students in the 1960s felt a relaxing of the rules and a lack of school spirit.\n\nIn spite of the tensions, sports and physical fitness continued to be a big part of life at ACP. Spurred on by a very successful advertising campaign, many Americans opted to take the president's famous 50-mile hike challenge. Kennedy was held in great esteem by many students at the College, who dedicated the 1965 yearbook to the slain president (there was no yearbook in 1964 as there was no graduating class that year due to the five-year requirement). At ACP, Chris Kaprielian '63 and Leonard DeVito '67 took the president's challenge and hiked down to the city over a long weekend, in temperatures that dipped to 10 below, wearing ski masks and carrying backpacks.\n\nMost students took a more traditional route to fitness, participating in an active sports program at the College. By 1959-60, the basketball team was in its eighth consecutive winning season under coach Al White. By the following year, when coach White had to suddenly leave a game for an emergency appendectomy, the team kept on winning in his absence - all 12 men scored that night against Berkshire Christian College. With \"the best college record in the area\" under co-captains Bob Toomajian '62 and Howie Rubinger '63, the team seemed unbeatable.\n\nDuring the 1964-65 season, the Panthers' second as a member of the newly formed Northeastern Collegiate Conference, the team broke 29 school records and captured the conference title, winning White the honor of Coach of the Year.\n\nSo it was a huge shock to the student body when the \"Husky Skipper,\" as White was affectionately known, resigned as coach in 1965 after 13 winning seasons and a 149-72 record. While White remained on as director of athletics and advisor to the Athletic Commission, the team continued on under Ed Lynch in the 1965-66 season, and, throughout the rest of the '60s, under coach Willard Rice.\n\nBasketball was not the only winning sport at ACP. A new bowling league, with six teams, was organized by Rich Cognetti '69 and John Palazzoli '64, in the 1959-60 academic year, and, by the following year, was open to all classes. Eventually, the varsity bowling team at ACP went on to win three North- eastern Collegiate Conference championships in four years during the decade.\n\nThe varsity golf team, formed in May 1964, captured three straight NCC championships in 1966-68, and the varsity volleyball team captured the title during the 1967-68 season. Softball, basketball, and tennis continued to enjoy success as well. With all of the winning teams, an honorary Varsity Club was open to anyone who had played one full season in a varsity sport and entitled them to wear a snappy club blazer.\n\nOther new activities were added during the decade, beginning with a college band revived after many years under Richard Daffner '63. The \"Rex-men,\" basically a brass section with a piano, made its debut at a Christmas party in 1960 and played at dances and at basketball games during halftime. With bright red music stands emblazoned with the pharmacy emblem, they cut a fine figure as they launched into the likes of \"Swingin' Shepherd Blues\" and \"When the Saints Go Marching In.\" The Glee Club still had about 40 members and entertained at concerts, as well as at the annual Homecoming Weekend. This jam-packed event featured a party on Friday night as well as an alumni basketball game, and culminated with a dance and the crowning of the Homecoming queen, a cheerleader chosen by the Athletic Commission.\n\nThe student branch of the American Pharmacists Association had a very large membership with 270 active ACP members at its height. One of the highpoints of the decade came in May 1965 when two members of the chapter were in attendance as Vice President Hubert Humphrey, R.Ph., the world's most famous pharmacist at the time, addressed the APhA convention in Detroit .\n\nIn 1960, a Wives Auxiliary of the student branch of APhA was organized at the suggestion of Hilda O'Brien '21, the dean's wife. With Priscilla Steed, wife of Gerald Steed '61, as president, \"the wives\" functioned primarily as a social group, with a goal of familiarizing themselves with their husbands' work and the field of pharmacy in general. Many hours were spent in \"wifely chatter\" at events such as a \"gala Christmas party at the O'Brien's\" and bake sales, \"white elephant sales,\" raffles and other money-making schemes. The stated purpose of the club was \"giving hubby a night out and treating him [while] raising money for a gift or scholarship to the college.\"\n\nBy January 1961, another new club for young women was formed at ACP with the debut of the Alpha Alpha Chapter of Alpha Delta Theta, a professional sorority for college women studying medical technology. The group, founded under the leadership of Wilma Rose as president and the guidance of Miss Mountain, chief bacteriologist at Bender Lab, quickly became an active member of the flourishing Interfraternity Council.\n\nAll of the frats and both sororities took part in events sponsored by the Interfraternity Council, including picnics at Thacher Park, tennis matches and baseball games, with the big event of the year the Homecoming Weekend sponsored by the IFC and Athletic Commission.\n\nBut each of the fraternal organizations sponsored their own annual events as well. More and more, they became involved in the community, collecting Christmas toys and food for the needy and equipping a pharmacy on the S.S. Hope, a hospital ship that sailed to Indonesia and South Vietnam in 1960. Frats and sororities also were involved in assisting the College itself, including fundraising activities that benefited scholarships. At the beginning of the decade, the \"Ropes\" even presented ACP with a 50-star flag to commemorate the addition of Hawaii to the United States in 1959.\n\nBy the early '60s, Kappa Psi was organizing an Open House at the College to interest prospective students in the new five-year Pharmacy program and demonstrate cutting-edge equipment such as ACP's new MiniVac computer, an early computer that went on the market in 1961.\n\nBut, as always, there was a light side to the College as well.\n\nPhi Delta Chi sponsored its first twist party in the fall of 1962, capitalizing on the dance craze sweeping the country. The dance was first popularized by Chubby Checker in 1960 when his song, \"The Twist,\" reached number one for the first time. By the time of the PDC party, the tune had set a record by resurfacing as a number one hit again. At ACP, t wist parties were a roaring success and featured groups like the Orkets and Larry Jackson's Swinging Knights.\n\nSoon, even the twist was becoming a bit old hat and, by 1964, a group of fourth-year students, \"Pharmacy's answer to the Beatles,\" was playing at favorite ACP haunts such as the Petit Paris and Ralph's Tavern. By 1966, \"Pharmacy's own Rolling Stones,\" Les Figarsky and George Milne, had taken over the musical reins.\n\nSome events concentrated more on the theme than the music, capitalizing on popular culture of the times. Kappa Psi's Sweetheart Weekend at the Crooked Lake House featured \"machine gun-toting Clydes and long-skirted Bonnies\" after the hugely popular film debut of Bonnie and Clyde in 1967.\n\nOne of the lighter moments of the decade was the appearance of an eight-foot tall chicken, complete with trailer, at ACP during Kappa Psi pledge week in 1965.\n\nAccording to Mortar and Pestle, pledges had to \"do a bit of chicken riding during second seminar.\" Things got out of hand when the pledges and some of the brothers decided to take the chicken downtown at 11:30 p.m. \"where they encountered four cop cars and a couple of motorcycles.\" After an explanation from the leader of the brigade, the fraternity and the chicken parted company. Luckily for the frat, \"there was no trouble, as it was all done in fun.\"\n\nOutside of ACP, students embraced the full spectrum of the 1960s.\n\nEarly in the decade, many students were veterans of the Korean war with young families. They played pinochle and ping pong in the men's smoker and showed off their cars in the College parking lot. They listened to jazz on their \"hi-fis\" and went to see the Smothers Brothers perform when they played at Siena College in 1962. And the preferred reading material for the \"Atomic Age Generation\" was Frannie and Zooey by J.D. Salinger and Catch 22 by Joseph Heller.\n\nBy 1965, Mortar and Pestle reported that ACP \"folk fans poured in with blankets and bottles of chianti\" to see Bob Dylan perform at the Troy Armory. Within three years students were hanging out at the Eighth Step Coffee House on Willett and State streets to hear folk music, poetry and plays on Tuesday and Wednesday nights.\n\nOn the more serious side of things, both the Student Christian Association and the Newman Club started off the "
