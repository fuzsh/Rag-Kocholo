        "text": "In the last 6 weeks I've created over 400+ individual pieces of content for clients for the upcoming holiday break. That's the copywriting, the sourcing of images (or graphic design if needed), the hashtag research, the approval process and the scheduling. And that 400+ pieces doesn't count the same content scheduled across multiple channels. üôÉ It's meant I've worked nights, weekends and way longer hours than I ever normally do, but it also means I get to enjoy the next 4-5 weeks off with my son and family. üòÑ I love working in social media, I love being a freelancer able to control my hours and my time off, and I also love the feeling of knowing I've done a bloody good job for my clients this year. But it's definitely hard work, especially at this time of the year. Social media is still a very underrated job, with many people considering it not a \"real job\" or \"cruisy\". My parents still really have no idea what I do for a job, just that I go online. üòÖ I bet a lot of other social media managers right now can 100% relate to this post, and I just want to say to them that you've done an amazing job. You've survived the crazy season and now it's time for a well-deserved break. I'm excited for 2024 as big things are coming for Sarah Lilly Media. A lot of changes are in the pipeline and I'm going to be able to focus on something that I've been wanting to do for a long time. Watch this space üòâ Happy holidays everyone! üå≤ #socialmediamarketing #socialmediamanager #freelancer #socialmedia #newzealand #contentcreator\n\nHey! sharing some simple and practical tips to keep your social media content interesting and creative: 1)Mix It Up: Don't post the same thing every day.

You're scrolling through your social media feed, and suddenly, you stumble upon a post that's pure magic. It's not just a \"huh, neat\" and continue scrolling; it's a legitimate pause. A moment where the holiday hustle takes a backseat to the enchantment on your screen. Well, let me spill the cocoa beans on these social media secrets that turned a regular scroll into a magical sleigh ride! ‚ú® Be the Scroll-Stopper: It's not just about visuals (although they certainly help lol); it's about being the magic that stops the scroll. The captivating hook and relatable vibes make your content stand out like a shiny ornament on a Christmas tree.üéÑ üìà Authenticity All the Way: Storytelling that matters. Being human and making connections through shared emotional experiences. These are more than posts; they're memories in the making. Being authentic, resonating with your audience, and making it memorable ‚Äì that's the secret sauce to sleighing social media all year round. üìù Santa's List of Engagement: Santa checks his list twice, and so should you! Respond to comments, ask questions, and spread the holiday cheer. Your social media isn't just a platform; it's a community, and engaging with it turns followers into friends. ü§ù üîç BONUS: Unwrapping the Keywords: Oh, and here's a little bonus ‚Äì most social platforms are keyword optimized. So, sprinkle your copywriting with festive flair, hashtag strategically, and give your content that extra SEO sparkle. üì± üõ∑ This season, social media isn't just a goal; it's a festive adventure waiting to unfold! #marketingconfidencemakesadifference #FestiveAdventure #DigitalMagic #marketingmagic #marketingtips #SleighSocialMedia #HolidayMagic #DigitalCheer #SlayTheScroll\n\nHow strong is your why? I mean what brought you here? What can stop you from building over here? As for me ‚Ü≥I came to LinkedIn as just to hide and build. ‚Ü≥I turn to LinkedIn because of its simplicity. ‚Ü≥Why won't I show up for job opportunitiy. ‚Ü≥I won't also forget to include copy cat! But with all these My WHY aren't strong enough! in 40 days I lost all the energy I brought and LinkedIn showed me premium Shege for another 40 days! Premium problems like ‚Ü≥Dropped profile visibility ‚Ü≥Dropped post engagement ‚Ü≥Dropped followers count üò≠ And so on. I thought about giving Up and lost consistency. Then I found a way to redefine My why through Sodunke who helps me understand that Linkedin is more than just a Social Media platform. LinkedIn is more than just creating content. Linkedin is more than just getting Jobs. He said LinkedIn is hard and easy, then He gave me unlimited fearless and monster drinks Help me select a strong why and holds me by the neck üß£ü§£ Now you can see the benefits and disadvantages of not having a strong why! Let me ask you again! Why did you want to build here? Understanding this will help you stand the test of time and the wave of premium troubles that flies around! PS: How happy are you about this coming holiday? Share your opinion in the comments section! if you were calm to read to this extent, signify in the comments with a love emoji, I have a Christmas gift for you! #thrivewithtomide #30dayslinkedintourwithtomide #copywriting #brandbuilding #consistency üì∑ Me!ü§£ after sharing the chicken I haven't bought in the comments section ü§£!\n\n*whew* üòÆüí® Recently I worked in the local political arena, and I learned way more than I could possibly fit into one post. AND I learned one incredibly valuable thing: Serving a client sometimes has to go beyond \"give them what they want.\" I was previously used to having creative control over my brand's socials, albeit with time and budget constraints. I was used to bosses giving me the \"press the magic Socials button to make us money\" attitude. So when I offered to help a political candidate, I had that mindset and expected the work to change very little. What I forgot along the way was *who* I was working for. This client had certain needs as a marginalized person with intersecting identities, including disabilities, and along with that came a lack of face time on camera, a severe lack of production time, many accommodations, and an on-the-fly understanding of what they were and were not capable of doing. üå™ Whereas previously I had freedom to generate content and get annoyed when things didn't work out as planned, I needed to learn to pivot in an entirely new way that didn't involve merely my client changing their minds, or dishing new content or messaging ideas. The moment came when we *finally* had the opportunity to create a super fun socials contest of sorts. We mapped it out, and the kick-off content that I requested was a short video of my client saying one line that they could record on their own and send to me. We had a posting deadline by the end of a Friday. Unfortunately, their calendar filled up expeditiously, and they didn't have time to record the video. Instead they sent me one static pic. üòê Crestfallen, I spent an hour or so wracking my brain, trying to decide what to do with so little to work with. How could I kick off a great socials campaign with barely anything from the central figure of the narrative we'd built? Then it hit me! Take the original pic, edit it into four or five different crops, add music and text, and BAM! A classic tiktok video. This would seem obvious to some. To me, with little experience creating tiktoks for clients (time and budget), this was a major breakthrough. ‚õèÔ∏è Sometimes a client doesn't have the privilege to be \"on\" for content. Sometimes I need to check *my* privilege. Sometimes ya just gotta let go‚Äîlet go of your stunning idea and do what you can with what you have. By working with a marginalized person with specific needs, I learned how to re-work how *I* work. It was different from just coming up with something out of thin air; it was üí° generating something from practically nothing, üí° which I know plenty of marginalized people, including myself, have had to do time and time again IRL. Going forward, I will take into account my clients' needs as human beings, have contingency plans, and work harder to develop ideas that present quality content to the best of their and my abilities. ‚úî How have you learned to pivot your SM plans for a client?ü§î\n\nOur teams pulled together 10 tips for social media content during the holiday period: üñäÔ∏è Pre-plan/ write your Jan/Feb content NOW so you can come back in 2024 ahead of the game ü§î Think about your audience‚Ä¶ what are they likely to be doing over the holiday period? Match your content to suit. üìà Is it time to amp up sales? Or back off for a break? üòÖ Keep your tone light. üôè Share gratitude often. It can be a tough time of the year for a lot of people so be kind. üéÑ Is a Christmas offer appropriate for your business? ‚¨áÔ∏è Think about reducing your number of posts for a few weeks during Christmas and New Year or even until your return to work date. üíî Remember your analytics may fluctuate more than usual over this time, don‚Äôt get disheartened. üì¢ Create an auto-response for your account inboxes so people know you're on limited duties and when you'll be available again to answer their message. üòé Take a break. Enforce a social media break for yourself over this period. As important as it is to communicate with your audience regularly, it is even more important to have a digital detox yourself. Give yourself permission to switch off. #socialmediamarketing #digitalmarketing #socialmediastrategy #socialmedia #contentstrategy #nzfarming #ruralsocialmedia #socialmedianz\n\nI tried so hard for so long to create a formal content plan for myself on LinkedIn. I failed. So instead, my content planning looks like this. üëáüèΩ This is a literal screenshot of my ‚Äúcontent plan‚Äù for LinkedIn‚Äîan outline of what content I plan on posting and on what day. This is a note on my iPhone. üòÖ After about a week of content and little green check marks ‚úÖ, I delete the previous week‚Äôs line items and start to ideate on what the coming week should look like. It‚Äôs not sophisticated, and it‚Äôs not fancy. Heck, it‚Äôs not even aligned to a proper calendar that includes notifications for major holidays and world events‚Äîthings your regular content strategy without a doubt would take into consideration. It‚Äôs also not a month of scheduled content planned out in advance, because I tried that, and it simply did not work for me. By keeping about a week‚Äôs worth of a schedule jotted down at a time, I can see the flow of exciting events coming up that I want to feature; I can easily change a day‚Äôs content for another by quickly switching when I will post what; and I can get a little glimpse into what I‚Äôve been highlighting on LinkedIn, and then use it to reflect on whether I still have momentum with a given topic or instead need to switch it up and pivot to something else. I‚Äôm trying to post on LinkedIn once a day, every day, for as long as I can. I‚Äôve been at it for about a month. I truly don‚Äôt know why I‚Äôve decided to do this on LinkedIn and not on Instagram, but I trust my gut, and my gut tells me LinkedIn is the place I should be sharing more of this content. If you‚Äôve been thinking to yourself, ‚ÄúNicole has been posting a lot on LinkedIn lately,‚Äù you would be correct. I HAVE been posting a lot on LinkedIn lately. And this little screenshot‚Äîthis little note on my phone‚Äîis how I‚Äôve been organizing all of it. So that‚Äôs the tea. ü´ñ Sometimes it‚Äôs not about a super formal content plan or a really strategic outline. Sometimes it‚Äôs just about keeping the momentum, and taking it one day at a time. ‚òÄÔ∏è #linkedin #contentcreation #contentstrategy #contentplan #socialmedia #socialmediastrategy #socialmediamanagement #consistency #momentum #sharing #posting #iphone #notes #behindthescenes\n\nùêÖùê•ùê®ùê®ùê´ùêûùêù, ùêà'ùê¶ ùê£ùêÆùê¨ùê≠ ùêüùê•ùê®ùê®ùê´ùêûùêù!
