        "text": "1. Kathy Hochul\n\nGovernor\n\nIn her third legislative session as New York’s chief executive, Gov. Kathy Hochul has bent Albany to her style of leadership. Hochul’s approach has yielded late budgets, but she is learning the power available to her as governor in the budget process. The final budget featured a compromise housing package, unlike last year, and enacted Hochul’s ambitious artificial intelligence agenda. Hochul is also pushing forward on the clean energy transition, despite some bumps along the way, while asserting state control over safety in the New York City subway system. National eyes will be on Hochul this fall as Democrats look to New York as key to elevating Brooklynite Hakeem Jeffries to the House speakership.\n\n2. Andrea Stewart-Cousins\n\nState Senate Majority Leader\n\nThe first woman and first woman of color to lead the state Senate, Andrea Stewart-Cousins is coming off a year that reinforced her status as one of the most consequential state leaders. Stewart-Cousins led the state Senate in rejecting the nomination of Hector LaSalle for chief judge last year. Stewart-Cousins also led the Senate in passing the historic Clean Slate Act and a reparations commission law in 2023. This year, she led the Senate in passing a budget that addressed the state’s housing crisis with a compromise package that managed to hold the Democratic conference together.\n\n3. Carl Heastie\n\nAssembly Speaker\n\nAssembly Speaker Carl Heastie is avoiding public confrontation in Albany, particularly in the relationship between the state Legislature and Gov. Kathy Hochul. Early this year, Heastie steered clear of discussing any possible overrides of Hochul’s late 2023 vetoes, including of the Grieving Families Act, saying that he was looking for future collaboration with Hochul on those issues. This session, Heastie helped secure a “grand bargain” on housing policy, a key part of his budget strategy, negotiating a comprehensive package that became part of the final budget.\n\n4. Letitia James\n\nState Attorney General\n\nFor years, the National Rifle Association was seen as an unstoppable national political powerhouse. Then state Attorney General Letitia James came along and knocked the NRA off its throne. In an even bigger fight, James won a nine-figure civil judgment against former President Donald Trump. Now James is seeking to collect from Trump – which could make her a temporary titan of New York City real estate, with control over Trump Tower and 40 Wall St., in addition to being the most prominent of the nation’s state attorneys general.\n\n5. Michael Gianaris\n\nState Senate Deputy Majority Leader\n\nPerhaps the most powerful deputy majority leader in state Senate history, state Sen. Michael Gianaris is central to Albany decision-making. He scored a win with a new court-ordered round of congressional redistricting and oversaw drafting of a new map that could elevate Rep. Hakeem Jeffries, a fellow New York Democrat, to the House speakership. Gianaris is pushing for transparency around lobbying for or against gubernatorial nominees, after he helped block the nomination of Hector LaSalle as chief judge. Yet Gianaris’ bid to extend and expand a pilot program offering free city bus rides was dropped from the final budget deal.\n\n6. Jeremy Cooney, Brad Hoylman-Sigal, Brian Kavanagh, Liz Krueger, John Liu, Shelley Mayer, Zellnor Myrie, Jessica Ramos & Gustavo Rivera\n\nState Senators\n\nSince state Sen. Liz Krueger won a special election over two decades ago, the reform-minded Upper East Side lawmaker has become a mover and shaker in Albany. The Senate Finance Committee chair wields her power in crafting the state budget. The architect of the state’s cannabis law has closely monitored the slow market rollout, while also focusing on issues like climate sustainability and protecting gestational surrogates.\n\nSenate Judiciary Committee Chair Brad Hoylman-Sigal is one of the more prolific lawmakers in Albany, and isn’t slowing down. This year he sponsored the Local Journalism Sustainability Act and Sammy's Law, which grants New York City power over its speed limits. He’s also pressing to increase state Supreme Court judgeships and raise judicial salaries.\n\nState Sen. Brian Kavanagh has navigated one of Albany’s most contentious issues as chair of the housing committee. Kavanagh is touting the wide-ranging housing plan in the latest budget, including a version of “good cause” eviction, Mitchell-Lama preservation funding, eviction assistance and a basement- and cellar-unit pilot program.\n\nSenate Education Committee Chair Shelley Mayer adamantly opposed proposed education aid cuts, scoring a budget victory by blocking the governor’s proposed overhaul to Foundation Aid, which she said would cut funding to every school district in Mayer’s Westchester County. She also passed bills that pre-register students to vote, protect abortion access for patients outside of New York and ban the sale of over-the-counter diet pills or muscle building supplements to minors.\n\nIt’s not often that a state lawmaker controls a billionaire’s dreams, but for state Sen. Jessica Ramos, this is reality. The Senate Labor Committee chair, who’s a potential candidate for mayor of New York City, stands in the way of Mets owner Steve Cohen and his hopes of opening a casino near Citi Field. A new primary rival to Mayor Eric Adams is state Sen. Zellnor Myrie. The Senate Election Committee chair has been pushing the universal after-school program proposal, which gained some traction this year.\n\nAs a former New York City comptroller – and a former mayoral candidate – John Liu is no stranger to debating city policies. The chair of the Senate New York City Education Committee saw mayoral control extended for two years with some new limits on City Hall, but Liu expressed his displeasure that the matter wasn’t openly discussed and debated outside of the budget process.\n\nSenate Health Committee Chair Gustavo Rivera remains committed to overhauling New York’s entire health insurance industry, with legislation to guarantee health care to every person in the state. Rivera said the ambitious proposal would “destroy” the business model of health insurance but that he would work to include retraining programs for insurance company employees. He touted increased Medicaid rates for hospitals and nursing homes, but expressed dismay about many of the compromises in the state budget.\n\nState Sen. Jeremy Cooney was just named chair of the Transportation Committee, succeeding Rep. Tim Kennedy. Cooney led the Procurement and Contracts Committee and has backed changes to the legal marijuana market.\n\n7. Eric Adams\n\nNew York City Mayor\n\nFormer state Sen. Eric Adams has finally figured out how to navigate Albany. The New York City mayor achieved many of his top objectives in the latest state budget, including a two-year extension of mayoral control of city schools, new affordable housing policies, aid for migrants, the passage of Sammy’s Law to give the city control over some speed limits, retail theft penalties and more power to shut down illegal cannabis shops. Yet the spending plan does contain loopholes in the housing policies, less migrant aid than Adams wanted and new state oversight on mayoral control.\n\n8. Karen Persichilli Keogh & Kathryn Garcia\n\nSecretary to the Governor; Director of State Operations, Office of the Governor\n\nA decision in 2003 by then-U.S. Sen. Hillary Rodham Clinton to designate one aide – Karen Persichilli Keogh – to be the point of contact for a little-known suburban Buffalo town board member, Kathy Hochul, on Hochul’s pet issue of removing toll barriers, is reverberating two decades later. Keogh was one of Hochul’s first appointments after Hochul assumed the governorship in 2021, and she serves as the governor’s top adviser and chief surrogate. The woman in charge of the day-to-day operations of state government, Kathryn Garcia, is no stranger to tough assignments. She was New York City’s sanitation commissioner, taking on a number of extra duties from then-Mayor Bill de Blasio. Both were among the key state officials at Hochul’s side when a state budget agreement was announced last month.\n\n9. Betty Rosa & Lester Young Jr.\n\nCommissioner; Chancellor, State Education Department; State Board of Regents\n\nNew York’s top statewide education leaders are Lester Young Jr. and Betty Rosa. Rosa, a former Regents chancellor who has more independence since she’s not appointed by the governor, expressed concern earlier this year with Gov. Kathy Hochul’s proposal to change the state’s school aid formula, saying that it needs to be phased in to give local school districts more time to implement changes. Her office issued a key report on mayoral control of schools in April, and the education commissioner recently reached an agreement with education union officials and stakeholders on legislation to overhaul the state’s controversial teacher evaluation system and move it to local control. Young, the current Regents chancellor, led the board in adopting a diversity, equity and inclusion policy and addressing equity issues in state education. He also is working with parents and teachers regarding the future of the East Ramapo Central School District in Rockland County. As part of the conditions for extending mayoral control of schools in New York City, Young will help select a set of nominees to lead the city Panel for Educational Policy.\n\n10. Thomas DiNapoli\n\nState Comptroller\n\nThomas DiNapoli is active in protecting New York’s economy. DiNapoli continues to divest the pension funds from oil and gas stocks and issued an economic warning saying that a decrease in the state’s population is reducing personal income tax collection totals. DiNapoli has also called for more state investment in local emergency medical services and warned that the state’s public and private higher education institutions face a looming enrollment cliff and tough economic times.\n\n11. Crystal Peoples-Stokes\n\nAssembly Majority Leader\n\nCrystal Peoples-Stokes is at the peak of her power in Albany, with an impact being felt from her home base on Buffalo’s East Side to Manhattan’s East Side and even in Washington, D.C. The Assembly majority leader crafted the state’s legalized cannabis law and has been closely monitoring its rollout, calling for increased staffing in the state’s cannabis agency and enforcement of illegal shops. Peoples-Stokes has also been a key advocate behind the project to cap Buffalo’s Kensington Expressway, which received the nation’s largest federal Reconnecting Communities and Neighborhoods Grant Program funding award last year.\n\n12. Harry Bronson, Catalina Cruz, Grace Lee, John T. McDonald III, Amy Paulin, Karines Reyes, Linda Rosenthal, Nily Rozic, Michaelle Solages, Latrice Walker & Helene Weinstein\n\nAssembly Members\n\nConsistently the most prolific legislator in Albany, Assembly Member Amy Paulin is pursuing an ambitious agenda in her second year chairing the Health Committee. Among her health priorities is addressing health care staff shortages and increasing Medicaid reimbursement rates, which was included in the state budget. She has also made supporting the Medical Aid in Dying Act a top priority this year.\n\nAs Housing Committee chair, Assembly Member Linda Rosenthal pushed for more affordable housing this year, and new incentives and protections were included in a housing package that passed in the budget. The Upper West Sider scored a big win with passage of Sammy’s Law, which will allow New York City to have control over speed limits on certain roads.\n\nAssembly Member Helene Weinstein is in the final year of a 44-year trailblazing legislative career that has seen her become the first woman to chair the Ways and Means Committee. In addition to negotiating her final state spending plan, Weinstein has been working to overhaul the state’s wrongful death laws with the Grieving Families Act, which has been vetoed twice by Gov. Kathy Hochul. The first woman to chair the Judiciary Committee, Weinstein has passed landmark domestic violence prevention and child support legislation during her tenure in Albany.\n\nA reshuffle led to Assembly Member Harry Bronson moving into the influential Labor Committee chair from his previous perch helming the economic development panel. He plans to continue to focus on workforce development issues, while addressing poverty and wage theft in the role.\n\nAssembly Member Catalina Cruz has been working to protect migrants in New York City. She has introduced legislation to repeal 30-day and 60-day shelter deadlines and she wants a state right to counsel law for immigrants. Cruz is also pushing new benefits for yellow cab drivers including unemployment and paid sick leave.\n\nThe lobbying around Hector LaSalle’s chief judge nomination has spurred Governmental Operations Committee Chair John T. McDonald III to draft legislation regarding disclosure of lobbyist spending to influence judicial and commissioner nominations. The veteran Albany-area lawmaker saw his brother, James McDonald, take over as state health commissioner last year.\n\nConsumer Affairs and Protection Committee Chair Nily Rozic has been a proactive lawmaker on a range of issues. The state’s first Israeli-born lawmaker has displayed staunch support for Israel since the Oct. 7 Hamas attack. Rozic advanced legislation to increase hospital transparency and identify health care deserts and has sought to increase abortion protections.\n\nThe author of the state’s bail reform law, Assembly Member Latrice Walker continues to defend the contested policy – including through hunger strikes – against those who say it needs to be rolled back to combat crime. Walker also has a bill to allow those who have served more than half their sentence or ten years to petition for a resentencing to reduce mass incarceration.\n\nAssembly Member Michaelle Solages was a lead sponsor of one of the most notable state laws last year, a measure to create a commission to study reparations. The Black, Puerto Rican, Hispanic and Asian Legislature Caucus chair is now addressing questions raised about the process around an enacted reparations law.\n\nAssembly Member Karines Reyes is in the middle of a number of issues in her role as chair of the Puerto Rican/Hispanic Task Force. She was a driving force behind the decision to add the Dominican Republic as a location for the annual Somos conference, a decision that came out of an initial proposal to rotate the conference around Latin America to recognize the various cultures of New York’s Hispanic community. Reyes also applauded Gov. Kathy Hochul for signing legislation to address the disappearance and murders of women and girls of color in New York.\n\nAssembly Grace Lee, co-chair of the Asian Pacific American Task Force along with Assembly Member Zohran Mamdani, has been pushing a number of key issues in Albany. She spearheaded the state’s new Lunar New Year holiday and expressed support for Gov. Kathy Hochul’s additional support to combat hate crimes. The lower Manhattan lawmaker teamed with the New York City sheriff to raid several illegal pot shops and also helped gain some measure of justice for sexual abuse victims of the disgraced former Columbia University gynecologist Robert Hadden.\n\n13. Chuck Schumer & Kirsten Gillibrand\n\nU.S. Senators\n\nU.S. Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer sits at the center of every issue in Washington, D.C., but the Brooklynite still keeps close tabs on New York, still annually visiting every county, latching hyperlocal issues and using his post to benefit his state. Schumer has been a key driver of growing industries, championing Micron’s siting of a new semiconductor plant and the creation of thousands of jobs outside Syracuse and delivering a major National Science Foundation grant for battery storage and other clean energy projects to the Binghamton area. U.S. Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand, New York’s junior senator, has a lower profile, but she’s also bringing money back to the state and boosting many of the state’s industries. The Senate Agriculture Committee member has been in the thick of negotiations over the next farm bill, a key priority for upstate farmers and others. Gillibrand, who’s up for reelection this year, recently secured $372 million in direct funding for the state, including for the Interstate 81 replacement in Syracuse, the MTA Penn Station Access project in Manhattan, the Second Avenue subway expansion project and CHIPS Act funding for Global Foundries in Malta, New York.\n\n14. Rowan Wilson\n\nChief Judge, State Court of Appeals\n\nA year into his tenure as the state’s top jurist, Rowan Wilson is making a mark. Wilson led the state Court of Appeals in ordering a new round of redistricting, which could flip at least one Republican held congressional seat in the state, possibly helping shift control of the House of Representatives. Wilson has put a focus on improving the state’s family courts, praising the Legislature for creating additional judgeships. He also oversaw the controversial reversal of the sex crimes conviction of Harvey Weinstein on procedural grounds.\n\n15. George Gresham\n\nPresident. 1199SEIU\n\n1199SEIU’s George Gresham is continuing to capitalize on his union’s formidable alliance with the Greater New York Hospital Association, as the unusual labor-management partnership made significant headway in Albany this session on closing the Medicaid reimbursement gap. Gresham also championed the passage of “good cause” eviction legislation, a part of the final budget’s comprehensive housing package, albeit in a watered down form. Gresham has also been a vocal advocate for keeping SUNY Downstate Medical Center open, saying that the state has been losing hospitals and access to health care.\n\n16. Kenneth Raske\n\nPresident and CEO, Greater New York Hospital Association\n\nArguably New York’s most influential policy leader who’s not actually in government, Kenneth Raske has laid out a clear message in Albany: Boost funding for hospitals. The head of the powerful lobby argued that many hospitals can’t keep up expenses and that funds in the state’s cash reserves should be directed toward Medicaid to balance hospital budgets. Raske praised the latest state budget for taking a first step toward eliminating the Medicaid coverage gap. Raske’s influence in Albany has grown with the addition of former state Budget Director Robert Mujica as a GNYHA adviser.\n\n17. Rick Cotton\n\nExecutive Director, Port Authority of New York and New Jersey\n\nNew York City’s airports are becoming the envy of the nation, and Rick Cotton continues to oversee a $30 billion renovation of these gateways. The Port Authority chief also has a new Manhattan bus terminal to build, and he just unveiled a new tap payment system for PATH. Cotton announced new infrastructure projects for the seaport, including a $19.2 million study with the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers to explore deepening port channels. Cotton’s seaport duties are on the rise as Gov. Kathy Hochul and New Jersey Gov. Phil Murphy offered increased port access to handle cargo that cannot access the Port of Baltimore after the Francis Scott Key Bridge collapse.\n\n18. Janno Lieber\n\nChair and CEO, Metropolitan Transportation Authority\n\nJanno Lieber has carved himself a place in the history of New York transit, leading the Metropolitan Transportation Authority in approving congestion pricing – and making New York City the first in the nation to move forward with such a plan, assuming ongoing litigation doesn’t stall it. The funds from the plan are being earmarked for infrastructure upgrades and other projects in the subway system. Lieber has also vowed to reduce crime in the subway system, saying more cameras and assistance for mentally ill individuals will help.\n\n19. Michael Dowling\n\nPresident and CEO, Northwell Health\n\nThe leader of the state’s largest private employer, Michael Dowling wields influence on health care and business policy in New York. Dowling sees the trend of many aspects of health care taking place outside of the hospital continuing going forward, noting that just over half of Northwell’s care is done at home or in ambulatory care centers. Dowling has created a center for excellence in artificial intelligence within Northwell to address ways to use AI in health care, saying it can address rising costs in the age of decreased Medicaid reimbursement rates.\n\n20. Blake Washington\n\nBudget Director, State Division of the Budget\n\nBlake Washington has been the governor’s chief numbers person since last summer. Washington helped the governor navigate a dropoff in federal funding, a migrant crisis and a state Legislature with its often divergent priorities, securing a balanced spending plan that included compromises on Medicaid spending and public safety while blocking efforts to raise taxes. Washington is a former secretary of the Assembly Ways and Means Committee, having spent over two decades in a variety of legislative budget jobs.\n\n21. Rory Christian, Marie Therese Dominguez, Adrienne Harris, Doreen Harris, Hope Knight, James McDonald, Jeanette Moy, Roberta Reardon, Robert Rodriguez & RuthAnne Visnauskas\n\nCabinet Members to Gov. Kathy Hochul\n\nAs the state’s housing czar, RuthAnne Visnauskas is at the center of one of the state’s most politically charged issues. Visnauskas is now charged with implementing the compromise housing plan adopted in the budget and continuing to tackle the growing need for more affordable housing across the state.\n\nState Transportation Commissioner Marie Therese Dominiguez is passionate about reconnecting New York communities divided by highways, a top administration priority. She is spearheading projects around the state, including in Syracuse, Buffalo, Albany, Rochester and the Bronx, as part of the objective.\n\nNew York leads the nation in the financial services industry, and from her perch as the state’s top financial services regulator, Adrienne Harris is using her regulatory powers to shape the nation’s cryptocurrency future. This year, she reached a settlement with a cryptocurrency exchange founded by the Winklevoss twins to return $1.1 billion to consumers.\n\nA key priority for state economic development chief Hope Knight is implementing universal broadband connectivity statewide, including identifying all underserved communities as part of a project being funded by the federal government. Knight also outlined a plan to transform the former Lincoln Correctional Facility in Harlem into housing, under a new state program.\n\nWith the darkest days of COVID-19 behind us, state Health Commissioner James McDonald is tackling other issues: making contraception available to walk-in patients at pharmacies statewide, battling seasonal flu, promoting the state’s health equality agenda – and, of course, weighing in on Medicaid spending levels and support for struggling hospitals. He has also been authorized to shape and implement a major new tax on managed care organizations.\n\nGov. Kathy Hochul has tasked General Services Commissioner Jeanette Moy with another key job: fixing the state’s legalized cannabis market. Moy has prioritized reducing the backlog of applications, streamlining the process and a top-to-bottom review of the Office of Cannabis Management. At OGS, which keeps the state government running, Moy has become a clean energy leader by reducing the state’s vehicle and building emissions.\n\nGrowing access to apprenticeship programs to boost the economy and the state workforce is a priority for state Labor Department Commissioner Roberta Reardon, including a new program for apprentices across state agencies. Reardon is also implementing new enforcement powers on wage theft.\n\nRory Christian and Doreen Harris are responsible for carrying out New York’s clean energy transition. Harris, who leads the New York State Energy Research and Development Authority, has been a champion of the state’s ambitious climate goals, recently unveiling the South Fork Wind Farm off the coast of Long Island and championing the growth of a clean energy economy across the state. Harris has announced plans to continue to grow a state-based renewable energy supply chain for projects. Public Service Commission Chair Rory Christian has acknowledged that there will be bumps in the road as the clean energy transition progresses and said that the plan requires an “all-of-government solution” in order to be successful. In January, Christian led the PSC in approving an Advanced Technology Working Group to help move the transition forward.\n\nMeanwhile, former lawmaker Robert Rodriguez left the secretary of state’s post to become acting president and CEO of the Dormitory Authority of the State of New York. He’ll be trading a job where he ran a catchall agency covering consumer protection, downtown economic development, building codes, coastal affairs, cemeteries and boxing regulation, for a wide-ranging job involving construction, cannabis, clean energy and higher education.\n\n22. Michael Mulgrew\n\nPresident, United Federation of Teachers\n\nMichael Mulgrew applauded the changes included in the extension of mayoral control of schools in New York City, praising a mandate for lower class sizes and more independent leadership to the city Panel for Educational Policy. The powerful labor leader helped block a proposed overhaul of state education aid from being part of the final budget. He’s also emphasizing that schools are no longer just education facilities – they are mental health providers, social services providers and child nutrition providers too.\n\n23. Gary LaBarbera\n\nPresident, New York State Building and Construction Trades Council\n\nGary LaBarbera has been in a New York housing state of mind. The powerful building trades labor chief was a key player in state housing negotiations in the budget, which yielded a compromise on revamped affordable housing incentives, tenant protections and higher wages for construction workers. LaBarbera also unveiled a plan with New York City Mayor Eric Adams for a $400 million affordable workforce development housing initiative. He has advocated for keeping skilled trade jobs local, making clean energy investments and building a new soccer stadium in Queens, citing the creation of union jobs.\n\n24. James Whelan\n\nPresident, Real Estate Board of New York\n\nJames Whelan wants to send state legislators back to school to study economics, where he says they can figure out a better housing plan. Whelan said the lack of understanding of economics was a key reason that lawmakers have not adopted a more ambitious plan to build more housing. The powerful real estate industry leader was in the thick of the negotiations over a compromise housing package. He saw the activist-backed “good cause” eviction measure watered down, but said the overall compromise “falls short” and recommended that lawmakers develop a longer-term solution.\n\n25. Mario Cilento\n\nPresident, New York State AFL-CIO\n\nMario Cilento scored a big win in the state budget, with a change to Tier 6 pensions that aim to improve retirement benefits for public sector workers. The leader of the 2.5 million-member state labor umbrella organization has also pushed for better unemployment benefits that meet the cost of living and housing in New York City. Cilento also is seeking to address the union strike penalty of two weeks before qualification for unemployment. He has welcomed rising interest in creating unions in the state, which he credited to younger workers.\n\n26. Kathryn Wylde\n\nPresident and CEO, Partnership for New York City\n\nFrom the canyons of Wall Street to State Street, Kathryn Wylde is an unabashed champion for New York City’s business community. Wylde has found support from Albany’s other powerful Kathy – Gov. Kathy Hochul. Wylde supported last year’s passage of the Clean Slate Act, saying it will help grow the New York economy, and she has been a key supporter for congestion pricing. Wylde praised the latest state budget, saying it will “reinforce the strength and stability of New York’s economy.”\n\n27. Rich Maroko\n\nPresident, Hotel and Gaming Trades Council\n\nRich Maroko is not wasting away at Margaritaville, he’s too busy making sure the workers are unionized. The powerful hotel labor leader announced that workers at Margaritaville Times Square are now members of the union, a fight not anticipated under the terms of the union’s labor agreement in New York City. Maroko is set to see his power grow when the state issues up to three new downstate casino licenses sometime in late 2025, a move backed by the labor leader.\n\n28. John King\n\nChancellor, State University of New York\n\nEntering his second year leading the State University of New York, John King is aiming to eliminate single-use plastic products across campuses and is gathering community input for a new vision for the struggling SUNY Downstate Medical Center in Brooklyn, which got a temporary lifeline from Albany. The latest state budget also funds the governor’s Empire AI initiative, to be headquartered at SUNY’s University at Buffalo, and included other spending increases for SUNY. Amid speculation that King was a candidate for the Harvard presidency, he said he’s committed to New York.\n\n29. Félix V. Matos Rodríguez\n\nChancellor, City University of New York\n\nFélix V. Matos Rodríguez is celebrating two of the largest donations ever to come into the City University of New York system. LaGuardia Community College received $116.2 million from the Steven & Alexandra Cohen Foundation to build a new workforce development center, and the CUNY Graduate Center received $75 million from the Simons Foundation and Simons Foundation International to fund an expansion in computational science. Matos Rodríguez praised the state budget for providing funding for investments into the higher education system and supporting community colleges.\n\n30. Melinda Person\n\nPresident, New York State United Teachers\n\nMelinda Person has found budget season to be a success. Person fended off Gov. Kathy Hochul’s bid to eliminate the “hold harmless” section of the state’s Foundation Aid formula for schools, meaning state aid for districts will not be cut this year. Person was also a key player behind the overhaul to Tier 6 pensions in the budget, a priority for many unions. Person negotiated a plan with state Education Commissioner Betty Rosa and other education stakeholders to devise legislation to overhaul the state’s troubled teacher evaluation system and increase local control.\n\n31. Elizabeth Fine, Stacy Lynch & Edgar Santana\n\nCounsel; Chief of Staff; Executive Deputy Secretary to the Governor\n\nElizabeth Fine was one of the first people Gov. Kathy Hochul called after she found out she was moving up from the lieutenant governor’s job in August 2021. Fine quickly assumed her post as counsel to the governor, joining Secretary to the Governor Karen Persichilli Keogh as one of Hochul’s first appointments in the Executive Chamber.\n\nThe first woman of color to serve as chief of staff to a New York governor, Stacy Lynch brings deep political and policy experience to Hochul’s inner circle. A veteran of former New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio’s City Hall, Lynch was previously chief of staff to then-Lt. Gov. Brian Benjamin.\n\nA veteran of the labor movement and the state Democratic Party, Edgar Santana is executive deputy secretary to the governor, a position that has him overseeing appointments and cabinet affairs, along with serving as Persichilli Keogh’s top deputy.

Pat Kane & Nancy Hagans\n\nExecutive Director; President, New York State Nurses Association\n\nPat Kane and Nancy Hagans represent the hardest working people in health care – nurses – and they want to make sure that New York’s nurses are treated right by hospital administrators and the state. The NYSNA leaders reached a deal earlier this year with Staten Island University Hospital and Northwell Health to avert a nurses’ strike at the health care center. In March, they led a rally at the state Capitol to call attention to staffing issues at hospitals and nursing homes. Hagans is also a president of the 225,000-member National Nurses United.\n\n33. Heather Briccetti Mulligan\n\nPresident and CEO, The Business Council of New York State\n\nHeather Briccetti Mulligan means business. The top state business lobbyist argues that the state needs to reduce taxes on individuals and businesses to keep them in New York – and was undoubtedly pleased to see lawmakers’ efforts to raise taxes stall this session. The Business Council cited a recent state comptroller’s report saying that lost pandemic-era jobs would not return until 2026 as evidence that lawmakers should follow the group’s recommendations. The Business Council also backed the governor’s passage of legislation targeting retail theft.\n\n34. Jabari Brisport, Emily Gallagher, Zohran Mamdani & Julia Salazar\n\nSocialists in Office\n\nPerhaps the most hotly contested proposal in Albany this session was “good cause” eviction, a measure introduced by state Sen. Julia Salazar to protect tenants by preventing evictions without landlords meeting certain conditions. In a partial victory, a version of the legislation was included in the state budget, although housing advocates criticized it as too weak. The Senate Crime Victims, Crime and Correction Committee chair is also pushing criminal justice reforms that would make it easier to exonerate those with wrongful convictions, eliminate some criminal court fees and allow for the firing of abusive prison guards.\n\nState Senate Children and Families Committee Chair Jabari Brisport has established himself as New York’s leading champion of universal child care, a key plank of the socialist lawmakers’ agenda. In light of a new Cornell University report on child care in the state, Brisport argued the state should provide child care instead of relying on the private sector. Brisport backed the Build Public Renewables Act that passed last year and the reparations commission law. Brisport and his fellow Socialists in Office also kicked off the successful effort to keep Hector LaSalle off of the state’s highest court.\n\nAssembly Member Emily Gallagher has been working to remake the state’s building codes, including passing a version of the All-electric Buildings Act last year. She also passed the LLC Transparency Act last year, opening up details about shadowy shell companies. Now she is looking to make another mark on the state’s housing policy with a proposed Social Development Housing Authority, which would allow the state to build affordable housing directly instead of using private developers.\n\nAssembly Member Zohran Mamdani embarked on an effort to overhaul mass transit in New York City, including a pilot program allowing free bus rides on a handful of lines. However, efforts to extend and expand the program were stalled this session. In the budget, he did secure $12.4 million to upgrade New York City bus service ahead of congestion pricing implementation. Meanwhile, Mamdani has proposed legislation to end Columbia University and New York University’s property tax exemption on their vast real estate portfolios and direct the new revenue to the City University of New York.\n\n35. Mary Sullivan\n\nPresident, CSEA\n\nOnce a staffer in the Herkimer County Department of Social Services, Mary Sullivan now advocates for civil service staffers statewide at CSEA. This year, she joined labor leaders in the successful push to adjust Tier 6 pensions to benefit workers. Last year, Sullivan supported a civil service package that included a new program to raise awareness of civil service exams and another measure that counts time spent as provisional employees toward probationary time. She has also worked on a new program to deliver overtime back pay from the pandemic.\n\n36. Wayne Spence\n\nPresident, New York State Public Employees Federation\n\nWayne Spence has been proactive in efforts to save SUNY Downstate Medical Center in Brooklyn, which includes several hundred of his New York State Public Employees Federation members on its payroll. As part of the state budget deal, SUNY Downstate got a temporary lifeline and the Tier 6 pension plan was adjusted to improve benefits, which were among Spence’s top priorities in this session. The labor leader, who represents 50,000 public sector state employees, also celebrated PEF’s work with state officials in overhauling the state employee dental plan.\n\n37.

Giske is also a vice chair of the state Democratic Party.\n\n40. Frank Carone\n\nFounder and Chair, Oaktree Solutions\n\nFrank Carone has departed City Hall, but he hasn’t left the inner circle of New York City Mayor Eric Adams, who just achieved several key goals in Albany, including the extension of mayoral control of schools. During his tenure as the mayor’s chief of staff, Carone forged ties to many movers and shakers, including top gubernatorial adviser Karen Persichilli Keogh – and he continues to advise the mayor on policy and political matters and is a key part of Adams’ reelection campaign as well.

Jay Jacobs\n\nChair, State Democratic Party\n\nAfter a tough 2022 election cycle that saw Republicans capture enough New York congressional seats to gain control of the House of Representatives and Gov. Kathy Hochul’s closer than expected election victory, things are looking up lately for Jay Jacobs. Jacobs saw Democrat Tom Suozzi flip his old Long Island congressional seat back to blue, and another round of redistricting has positioned Democrats to pick up one or more congressional seats.

The former New York City public advocate was an outspoken proponent of last year’s state law that moves some local elections in the state to even-numbered years, which Gotbaum’s good-government group Citizens Union said will lead to increased voter turnout. Gotbaum’s next goal is a state constitutional amendment to move all local elections, including those in New York City, to even-numbered years.\n\n82. Ed Cox\n\nChair, State Republican Party\n\nEd Cox knows a thing or two about being scrutinized on the national stage, as he married the president’s daughter, Tricia Nixon, in the White House and he helped escort his father-in-law, Richard Nixon, from the White House after his resignation. Now national Republicans are watching to see if Cox can keep five key New York congressional seats red to help the GOP maintain control of the House of Representatives – although Rep. Tom Suozzi’s comeback special election victory in the old George Santos seat wasn’t a good start.\n\n83. Clare Cusack\n\nPresident and CEO, New York Bankers Association\n\nClare Cusack is sending the message to state leaders that the banking industry is a strong – and safe – driver in the New York economy.

Cea Weaver\n\nCoalition Director, Housing Justice for All\n\nThis year’s state budget was a mixed bag for Cea Weaver. Weaver’s top issue, “good cause” eviction legislation, advanced as part of the compromise housing package in the state budget. Weaver has criticized the loopholes written into the final version of the laws included in the budget, changes that prompted several of her legislative allies to oppose the ultimate spending bill. While she may have come up short on her ideal housing package, Weaver has shown a tenacity to be back next year pushing a progressive housing agenda.\n\n85. Crystal McQueen-Taylor\n\nExecutive Director, StudentsFirstNY\n\nCrystal McQueen-Taylor went to Albany this year looking to extend mayoral control of New York City public schools – StudentsFirstNY ran a seven-figure ad buy to support the extension – and she scored a big win when it was ultimately included in the state budget. McQueen-Taylor, a former Bronx public school teacher who assumed her current role in 2022, had released a report earlier detailing issues that beset the nation’s largest public school system prior to mayoral control. StudentsFirstNY is better known for promoting charter schools, and last year won a partial victory when lawmakers allowed 14 new “zombie” charter schools.\n\n86.

John Kaehny\n\nExecutive Director, Reinvent Albany\n\nJohn Kaehny’s goal is to improve government transparency and the way Albany does business. Kaehny has closely scrutinized state investments in new sports stadiums, including a potential state subsidy for a new stadium for the Buffalo Bisons minor league baseball team after the state funding of a new Buffalo Bills stadium. Kaehny’s good-government group expressed concerns over the state’s tax break for yacht and private jet purchases, which Reinvent Albany said costs the state $10 million annually. He has also called for reforms to the state’s industrial development authorities.\n\n89. Duncan MacKenzie\n\nCEO, New York State Association of Realtors\n\nNew York’s Realtors take Albany by storm every year, with over 400 descending on Albany this past March, the largest contingent to ever participate in the New York State Association of Realtors’ annual lobby day.

She expressed support for new funding in the state budget to plant trees to combat climate change.\n\n92. Daniel Ortega\n\nExecutive Director, New Yorkers for Affordable Energy\n\nOne of the biggest legislative proposals omitted from the state budget this year was the NY HEAT Act, which aims to reduce natural gas use by eliminating an automatic gas hookup requirement. The NY HEAT Act’s failure was a win for New Yorkers for Affordable Energy, a business and labor coalition led by Daniel Ortega.

Ortega is also the community affairs chief for Engineers Labor-Employer Cooperative Local 825.\n\n93.
