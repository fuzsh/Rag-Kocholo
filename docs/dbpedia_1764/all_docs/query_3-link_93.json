        "text": "Student Career Services\n\nConnect to ALBANYLAW LINK\n\n(log in required)\n\nWe are excited about career coaching and student development. Every student has the opportunity to work hand in hand with a career counselor from the very beginning of law school. The effectiveness of this partnering is evident, not only when students receive job offers, but also when students meaningfully determine their future career goals. Our mission is to make sure students have every available resource to achieve those goals.\n\nCareer Education\n\nCareer education is integral to creating professional choices and opportunities for students, and it begins with learning about the many options our graduates pursue. Students gain knowledge about different career paths by meeting with and speaking to alumni at career panels, lunches, networking receptions and through our unique Alumni Engagement Process, whereby counselors make individualized introductions between students and alumni based upon practice area and/or geographic preferences.\n\nSelf-Assessment\n\nCareful self-assessment is the cornerstone of career development. Our career counselors support students in identifying the values, skills, and characteristics they already have, and those they wish to develop. Our individualized career planning approach, using inquiry, reflection, and discussion helps students identify career goals and develop action plans to achieve those goals.\n\nAlumni Mentoring\n\nStudents who wish to participate in our Alumni in Mentoring program are matched with alumni who help to guide them with their career choices and develop their own professional network.\n\nLearn more about the Alumni Initiative in Mentoring\n\nInternship/Job Search\n\nThere are many internships and jobs available to Albany Law School students. We advise students on how to become superior candidates, beginning with a resume and cover letter review workshop during first semester of law school and mock interviewing during second semester. Additionally, students may obtain help from a dedicated writing specialist to refine writing samples for submission to employers. All of our internships are posted on AlbanyLaw Link, which allows for easy identification of potential internships and jobs using practice area and geographic preferences. We also participate in various job fairs and promote many diversity opportunities, partnering with bar associations and law firms.\n\nExamples of some of the internships and jobs obtained include:\n\nPublic Interest\n\nAlaska Legal Services Corporation (Anchorage, AK)\n\nDefenders of Wildlife – Washington, DC\n\nDisability Rights New York (DRNY) – Albany, NY\n\nEmpire Justice Center - Albany, NY\n\nEnvironmental Advocates of New York – Albany, NY\n\nLegal Assistance of Western New York, Inc. – Ithaca, NY\n\nMercy for Animals – Los Angeles, CA\n\nThe Legal Aid Society of Northeastern New York, Inc. – Albany, NY\n\nThe Legal Project, Capital District Women’s Bar Association – Albany, NY\n\nThe Door – New York, NY\n\nSouthern Coalition for Social Justice – Durham, SC\n\nUrban Justice Center – New York, NY\n\nGovernment\n\nAlbany County District Attorney’s Office\n\nBronx County District Attorney’s Office\n\nBrooklyn District Attorney’s Office\n\nNassau County District Attorney’s Office\n\nNew York County District Attorney’s Office\n\nNew York City Law Department, Office of the Corporation Counsel\n\nNew York State Office of the Governor, Executive Chamber – Albany, NY\n\nOffice of the New York State Attorney General – Albany, NY\n\nQueens County District Attorney’s Office\n\nUS Attorney’s Office, Northern District of New York – Albany, NY\n\nUS Attorney’s Office, Eastern District of New York – Central Islip, NY\n\nUS Attorney’s Office, Western District of New York – Rochester, NY\n\nUS Department of Justice, Professional Responsibility Advisory Office – Washington, DC\n\nUS Department of Veterans Affairs, Albany Stratton VA Medical Center – Albany, NY\n\nUS Securities and Exchange Commission – Washington, DC\n\nJudicial\n\nNew York State Court of Appeals\n\nNew York State Supreme Court, Appellate Division, Fourth Department\n\nNew York State Supreme Court, Appellate Division, Third Department\n\nU.S. Bankruptcy Court, Southern District of New York\n\nUS Court of Appeals, Second Circuit – Rutland, VT\n\nUS Court of International Trade\n\nUS District Court, Southern District of Texas – Houston, TX\n\nUS District Court, Eastern District of Texas – Tyler, TX\n\nUS District Court, Southern District of New York – White Plains, NY\n\nUS District Court, Northern District of New York – Albany, NY\n\nUS District Court, Western District of New York – Rochester, NY\n\nPrivate Law Firms"
