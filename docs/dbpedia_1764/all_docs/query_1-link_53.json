You will be able to watch the service live-stream at 2:00 p.m. on December 29th on the Marshall's Funeral Home Facebook page. The video will also be available for viewing at any later time after that.\n\nEdwin David (Ben) Smith, 71, of Kivimaa Moonlight Bay (Turtle Lake), Saskatchewan passed away on December 16th, 2020 after experiencing a massive stroke. He passed peacefully in the loving company of his wife, son and daughter.\n\nBen is survived by: the love of his life and wife of 51 years, Sandra; his son, David \"Smitty\" (Michelle) Smith; his daughter, Debby (James) Westerman, both of Regina; his four grandchildren, Rae and Maddi Smith, and Braydon and Brianna Westerman.\n\nBen is predeceased by: his parents, Helen and Harry Smith; and his brother, Gordon Smith.\n\nBen was born on December 20, 1948 in Craik, Saskatchewan. Immediately after graduating from Craik High School he started work with the Saskatchewan Department of Highways where he proudly worked for 35 years. His work with Highways started with surveying and ended with contract management and included the completion of a Diploma in Business from the University of Regina. Highways was a passion for Ben, both the work and the people touched his life in many ways. During his 35 years, Ben dedicated his personal time to coaching his kids in hockey, ringette, baseball and softball, volunteer work with the community association, curling, supervising school trips and anything else that involved enjoying friends and family. He enjoyed a good time.\n\nBen retired from Highways in 2001 to dedicate his time fully to Sandy’s successful battle with Breast Cancer. Following recovery, Ben and Sandy decided to fulfill a dream of full-time residency at Turtle Lake which had been the family fishing and camping destination for over 25 years. Ben was extremely proud to have built, along with family, his house at Turtle Lake and insisted that every family holiday would be better if experienced at the lake. His passion became hosting his children and grandchildren, who referred to him as Papa. He built skating rinks every winter and entertained the kids in the boat, hot tub and around the fire pit. He additionally travelled to Regina frequently to witness hockey, baseball and basketball games along with musicals and choir performances, he loved every moment with his grandchildren and was extremely proud of each of them and the amazing individuals they had become.\n\nBen enjoyed people and socializing, had many friends and managed to keep in touch with each and every one of them often. He loved his Roughriders although you wouldn’t know it because he spent a lot of time yelling at them on the TV. He loved to walk and would take along, or stop to visit, with anyone he could find along the way. He loved food, especially Nana’s home cooking and no one dared get between him and a homemade Nana bun. He was not scared of death and openly declared that he had lived the best life ever with no regrets.\n\nPapa was the light to every celebration and he will be missed dearly. His family loved him dearly."
