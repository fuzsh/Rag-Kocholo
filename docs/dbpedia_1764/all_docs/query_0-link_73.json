        "text": "William Kennedy (born January 16, 1928, Albany, New York, U.S.) is an American author and journalist whose novels feature elements of local history, journalism, and supernaturalism.\n\nKennedy graduated from Siena College, Loudonville, New York, in 1949 and worked as a journalist in New York state and in San Juan, Puerto Rico, where he also began writing fiction. In 1963 he returned to Albany, New York, which he considered the source of his literary inspiration, to continue working on newspapers and novels. His first novel, The Ink Truck (1969), concerns a colourful columnist named Bailey who leads a strike at his newspaper in Albany.\n\nBritannica Quiz\n\nClassic Children’s Books Quiz\n\nKennedy combined history, fiction, and black humour in his next novel, Legs (1975), about Jack (“Legs”) Diamond, an Irish-American gangster who was killed in Albany in 1931. Billy Phelan’s Greatest Game (1978), also set in Albany, chronicles the life of a small-time streetwise hustler who sidesteps the powerful local political machine. Ironweed (1983), which brought Kennedy widespread acclaim and won him the 1984 Pulitzer Prize for fiction, recounts a few days in the life of Francis Phelan (Billy Phelan’s father), an alcoholic vagrant drifting through life in Albany at the height of the Depression. Also published in 1983, O Albany! is a spirited nonfictional account of the politics and history of the city."
