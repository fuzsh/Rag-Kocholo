        "text": "We need great writers and exceptional books, now more than ever.\n\nIn a world on fire from terrible wars, political strife, migrant crises, income inequality, gun violence, climate change, and collective mental fatigue, our mission statement at the NYS Writers Institute is “to honor the power of literature as a force for individual growth and social good.”\n\nWe aim “to celebrate diverse voices in all genres and to foster a vibrant community of readers and writers who engage in meaningful dialogue.”\n\nIn this fraught moment, we are proud to present this lineup of events carefully curated to serve as a balm for what ails our society. These authors and their works will counteract despair by offering a refuge of artful writing that illuminates and inspires.\n\nWe invite readers of all ages to bring their perspectives, ask their questions, and add their voices to these vital conversations.\n\nWe never shirk from our duty to address inconvenient truths and uncomfortable topics. While honoring our commitment to\n\nfree speech and unfettered expression, we will insist on a climate of civil discourse and a respectful exchange of viewpoints.\n\nWe kick off the season with acclaimed novelist Hannah Lillith Assadi (Aug. 29), daughter of a Palestinian father and Jewish mother, whose upbringing informs her multicultural narratives. We conclude with Kendall Crolius (Dec. 3), author of Knitting with Dog Hair, who will demonstrate the art of knitting hats & scarves with dog hair during a popular visit from lovable therapy dogs who help students alleviate stress of preparing for final exams.​\n\nHannah Lillith Assadi, a National Book Foundation 5 under 35 honoree, is the author of Sonora, which received the Rosenthal Family Foundation Award from the American Academy of Arts and Letters, and The Stars Are Not Yet Bells, a New Yorker and NPR best book of 2022.\n\nHer third novel Paradiso 17, inspired by the life of her late Palestinian father, is forthcoming from Knopf in 2026.\n\nDmitry Bykov, major Russian literary figure, is the author of more than 90 books. His newest is VZ: Portrait Against the Background of the Nation (English translation, 2024), a meditation in fiction on the significance of Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy.\n\nAn outspoken critic of the Putin regime, Bykov and his work are banned from publication, media and university classrooms in Russia. He narrowly survived an assassination attempt by poisoning in April 2019.\n\n​\n\nIan Singleton, novelist, Russian translator, and instructor in UAlbany’s Writing & Critical Inquiry Program (WCI), is the author of Two Big Differences (2021), a novel about two friends, Zina and Valinka, who are caught up in a wave of civil unrest during the 2014 Maidan Uprising in Ukraine— a mass protest against government corruption and Russian political influence. Writer-in-exile Mikhael Iossel called it, “Brightly original, structurally inventive, thoughtful and wise.”\n\nChris Bohjalian, the #1 New York Times bestselling author of 24 books, presents his newest novel, The Princess of Las Vegas (2024), one of the most anticipated mystery-thrillers of the year. A Princess Diana impersonator and her estranged sister find themselves drawn into a dangerous game of money and murder in this twisting tale of organized crime, cryptocurrency, and family secrets on the Las Vegas strip.\n\n​\n\nBohjalian’s other novels include The Lioness (2022), a Hemingway-inspired tale of murder on an African safari; Hour of the Witch (2021), a story of suspense set among the Puritans of 17th century Boston; The Sandcastle Girls (2012), a sweeping novel of the Armenian genocide; and Midwives (1997), an Oprah’s Book Club pick.\n\n​\n\nHis 2018 novel The Flight Attendant was adapted in 2020 as an HBO MAX series starring Kaley Cuoco.\n\nSamhita Mukhopadhyay, former editor-in-chief of Teen Vogue and the online community, Feministing, is a UAlbany alum who earned her BA in Women’s Studies in 2000. Her new book is The Myth of Making It (2024), a reimagining of the nature of professional success as we know it—particularly for women in the 21st century.\n\nCNN’s Jill Filipovic called it, “A reexamination of the many falsehoods, misconceptions, and outright delusions about female ambition and professional achievement,” and said, “If you’re burned out or simply asking ‘is this it?’ pick up this book.”\n\n​\n\nMajor support and funding provided by Heidi Knoblauch. Cosponsored by the Massry School of Business, Department of Women’s, Gender and Sexuality Studies, and the Honors College.\n\nMarianne Leone, actress, writer and advocate for disabled children, is the author of Five-Dog Epiphany: How a Quintet of Badass Bichons Retrieved Our Joy (Sep. 2024)— a tribute to the rescue dogs who helped her and husband Chris Cooper rediscover happiness after the tragic loss of their son Jesse, who died in 2005 at age 17 from complications of cerebral palsy. An actress in many films, including The Thin Blue Line (1988), True Love (1989), Goodfellas (1990), and The Three Stooges (2012), Leone is best-known for her recurring role in the hit series The Sopranos as the mother of mobster Christopher Moltisanti.\n\n​\n\nChris Cooper earned an Oscar for Best Supporting Actor for his role as backwoods “orchid poacher” John Laroche in the 2002 film, Adaptation, based on The Orchid Thief by Susan Orlean. Cooper collaborates frequently with celebrated filmmaker and Schenectady native John Sayles, appearing in Matewan (1987), City of Hope (1991), Lone Star (1996), Silver City (2004) and Amigo (2010). Other credits include American Beauty (1999), Seabiscuit (2003), Capote (2005), Syriana (2005), The Kingdom (2007), Where the Wild Things Are (2009), A Beautiful Day in the Neighborhood (2019), and Little Women (2019).

Kirkus called it, “The workplace dramedy of the year.” A New York Times Editors’ Choice, it was noted as a major new book by Lit Hub, Vogue, Vulture, New York, and Elle.\n\nWaldman’s previous novel, The Love Affairs of Nathaniel P. (2013), was a national bestseller. Widely-hailed as a 21st century “comedy of manners,” the book told the tale of a successful and self-absorbed young writer, and his romantic conquests in New York City’s hip literary world. The Boston Globe said, “Adelle Waldman just may be this generation's Jane Austen.”\n\nCosponsored by the UAlbany English Department’s Creative Writing Program and Young Writers Project, and the Writing & Critical Inquiry Program (WCI)\n\n​Urayoán Noel, former UAlbany faculty member, is a Puerto Rican poet, performer, translator, and preeminent scholar of Nuyorican poetry.

His 2014 book, In Visible Movement: Nuyorican Poetry from the Sixties to Slam, is the first book-length study of Nuyorican poetry, and the definitive book on the subject.\n\n​Sarah Giragosian, poet and lecturer in the UAlbany Writing & Critical Inquiry Program (WCI), is the author of a new collection, Mother Octopus (2024), co-winner of the 2023 Halcyon Prize. The book features poems that raise questions about the nature of human and animal appetites, and rising levels of material consumption that threaten the natural environment, while also exploring queer forms of intimacy and resilience.\n\nHer previous collections include Queer Fish (2017), winner of the American Poetry Journal Book Prize, and The Death Spiral (2020).\n\nCosponsored by UAlbany’s Living in Languages initiative of the Departments of English and Languages, Literatures and Cultures (LLC), CHATS Environmental Humanities Lab, English Department’s Creative Writing Program and Young Writers Project, Writing & Critical Inquiry (WCI), and the Honors College.\n\nJohn Elder Robison is a world-recognized authority on life with autism and the New York Times bestselling author of thoughtful and humorous books about his experiences living on the autism spectrum.\n\nA photographer, educator, neurodiversity advocate, automobile aficionado, and designer of special effects guitars for the rock band KISS, Robison received his autism diagnosis at the age of 40 — when he was already the parent of a second grader with a similar diagnosis.\n\n​\n\nPrior to that, Robison had merely been pegged as a “social deviant,” because of his tendency to blurt non sequiturs, avoid eye contact, dismantle radios, and dig five-foot holes.\n\n​\n\nRobison is the neurodiversity scholar in residence at the College of William & Mary and he serves on the Interagency Autism Coordinating Committee, which produces the U.S. government’s strategic plan for autism spectrum disorder research.\n\n​\n\nRobison’s books include Look Me in the Eye: My Life with Asperger’s (2007), a memoir about growing up with Asperger’s syndrome; Be Different (2011), Raising Cubby: A Father and Son’s Adventures with Asperger’s (2013), and Switched On: A Memoir of Brain Change and Emotional Awakening (2016).\n\nMajor support and funding provided by New York State Industries for the Disabled, Inc.
