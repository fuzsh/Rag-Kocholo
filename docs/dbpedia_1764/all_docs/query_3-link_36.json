Both of my parents and my stepfather were Polish survivors. Their experiences during the Shoah and how they lived their lives afterward in many ways formed the matrix of my identity. From my first vague memories of being a child in post- war Germany and refugee child in our new home in America, I knew that there was something special, precious, and different about their lives. That difference, I later came to understand, had something to do with being part of a decimated generation of European Jews—surviving victims who had nearly died. Almost all of my memories of childhood are related to that experience. The past was everywhere as I was growing up, creating memory tracks that often seemed to lead to no easy explanation or conclusion. These were secret realities that lay behind the everyday occurrences in my home. The spoken and the unspoken, the hushed conversations, the spontaneous tears, the Yahrzeit commemorations for people I had never met, the photograph that allowed me to imagine grandparents, but not to play or talk to them, this was the “stuff” of my youth.\n\n“Warning: Images of the dying and the dead may be disturbing. Please handle with the appropriate physical and emotional care. You are about to enter into the study of a subject matter that may challenge your assumptions about human nature, the capacity for human evil and your own vulnerability to these same tendencies. Enter at your own risk.”\n\nI often think that I should include a warning like this on the syllabus of every course I teach about Genocide and the Holocaust. I don’t, but I do worry about the motivations of the students who take these courses and I constantly ask myself why do we do this work and why do we expose students to these “disturbing” images and issues? How can we be sure these topics open up deep levels of reflection and ethical concern? To put it another way, how does one teach about a phenomenon which seems to defy both language and conventional historical explanations? How does one responsibly convey the horrors of the Shoah without becoming overwhelmed and numbed by it oneself? How does one deal with the inevitable tensions between the need to be reasoned and analytical and the equally strong urge to be passionate and emotional and personally engaged? Our professional voice says be distant and objective and quiet; our human and vulnerable voice says teach in a constant scream. All of these challenges revolve around two especially important and difficult questions which ask how the Holocaust can be taught so that it can be integrated into the consciousness of our students and, relatedly, now that the external facts of the Holocaust have been mostly established, how do we keep the Holocaust from being relegated to history, to memories that can be forgotten or simply ignored?\n\nIn my depressed moments I worry that this teaching is a sisyphusian enterprise doomed never to reach its goal. But in my more hopeful moments, I realize that the past stands still, but the present continues to move and every generation must find a way to discover and engage that history for itself. Martin Buber once wrote that all good teaching is pointing. Our job is to help point our students to that self-discovery. For all its apparent structure and closure, the Holocaust has not ended: not for the dwindling number of survivors, not for the perpetrators and certainly not for us as we seek to understand it.\n\nWhy do we teach and write about these subjects? We do so, I believe, because as teachers and students we want to find ways of integrating the meaning and implications of the Shoah into consciousness and conscience. One can learn about an event by consuming and assimilating the factual data—but this is not sufficient because learning does not necessarily indicate understanding. The latter is the result of integration and some level of engagement. By integration I mean the subject matter has been somehow successfully absorbed by the students into their moral and intellectual world so that it informs how they will now view that world without being numbed in the process. In the best case, this integration will lead to engagement, the action of resisting anything which reflects a genocidal process. There seems to be one overwhelming reason to force ourselves and our students to confront so much pain and suffering and that is to make us more deeply aware of our mortality and vulnerability and the humanizing effects that may have, on the one hand, and resistance to the conditions and processes that are involved in the decisions to destroy a people, on the other. We are constantly engaged in the struggle between memory and forgetting. But memory is not inert and lifeless, rather it is filled with hopes and fears, dreams and disappointments, life affirmation and experiences of death and dying, the stuff that makes up our essential being. We need to continue to find ways of opening our minds to these memories, personal and collective, even if they are painful, especially if they are painful.\n\nI have tried to bring this perspective to my community work and to my commitment to adult Jewish education. In Rochester where I live, I have been an active teacher and leader. I have served on (for over 25 years) and have chaired the Jewish Community Federations Committee for Holocaust Awareness and Information (CHAI). I have also been a board member, officer and president of the local Jewish day school, a founder and vice president of Ora Academy, a Jewish high school for girls, and a very active adult education teacher in the community. I have recently been appointed to the Farash Foundation’s Institute for Jewish Learning, an exciting opportunity to have a voice in helping transform Jewish identity and literacy in the Rochester area and beyond. This Institute will be spearheading new initiatives and disbursing significant resources to this endeavor.\n\nSERVICE PROJECTS\n\nThe March: Bearing Witness to Hope Student Leadership Trip\n\nFor more information please visit: https://hws.oudeve.com/centers/spiritual-engagement/jewish-life/march.aspx\n\nThis trip offers participants a unique and memorable experience focusing on important landmarks and historical sites central to understanding the Nazi period and World War II, culminating in the Holocaust. Beginning in Berlin, the program works its way through the complex history of this remarkable city, highlighting WWI, The Weimar Republic, the Nazi era, Jewish life in the city before, during and after the Holocaust, and ending with the Cold War and its aftermath. The group then moves to Poland visiting monuments and memorials that commemorate the once thriving Jewish cultural centers in Warsaw, Krakow, Lublin and Lodz that were destroyed during WW II. They walk through the death camps of Treblinka, Majdanek and Auschwitz-Birkenau where life ended for millions, as well as visit historic locations marking acts of resistance and rescue. The group also has the opportunity to visit important new museums in Berlin and Warsaw, \"taste\" a bit of local culture and color and see how Germany and Poland are attempting to come to terms with their pasts."
