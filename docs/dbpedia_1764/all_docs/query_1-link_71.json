        "text": "John Edwin Smith, a prominent philosopher and author whose work tackled large questions about the nature of truth from a pragmatic, pluralistic and specifically American perspective, died on Dec. 7 in Arlington, Va. He was 88 and lived in New Haven.\n\nThe cause was a stroke, his daughter Diana Smith said.\n\nAt his death, Mr. Smith was the Clark professor of philosophy emeritus at Yale, where he had taught from 1952 until his retirement in 1991.\n\nThroughout his career, Professor Smith was known for championing, and often resuscitating, unfashionable branches of his field. Chief among them was the philosophy of religion, a subject that had fallen out of favor in the Rationalist climate of the mid-to-late 20th century.\n\nDuring those years, when American philosophy was dominated by an aloof, ivory-tower approach, Professor Smith argued for a more democratic stance: the search for truth, he argued, was an inherently social, communitarian enterprise.\n\nWhere midcentury American philosophy embraced the cool concern with logic then popular in Europe, Professor Smith helped revive interest in seminal American thinkers of the past, among them the pragmatists William James, Charles Sanders Peirce and John Dewey, and the idealist Josiah Royce.\n\nProfessor Smith’s books include “Royce’s Social Infinite: The Community of Interpretation” (Liberal Arts Press, 1950); “Reason and God: Encounters of Philosophy With Religion” (Yale University, 1961); “The Analogy of Experience: An Approach to Understanding Religious Truth” (Harper & Row, 1973); and “Purpose and Thought: The Meaning of Pragmatism” (Yale University, 1978).\n\nHe was the editor of the multivolume series “The Works of Jonathan Edwards” (Yale University), which collects the writings of that distinguished 18th-century American theologian.\n\nJohn Edwin Smith was born in Brooklyn on May 27, 1921. He earned a bachelor’s degree in philosophy from Columbia in 1942, followed by a master’s of divinity from Union Theological Seminary and a Ph.D. from Columbia. Before joining the Yale faculty, he taught at Vassar and Barnard Colleges."
