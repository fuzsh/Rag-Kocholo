        "text": "For students who decide that Rensselaer is their first choice, applying Early Decision (ED) is a great option. Early Decision is binding - applicants who are admitted to Rensselaer under Early Decision must withdraw all applications to other colleges. Rensselaer offers two rounds of Early Decision applications, EDI and EDII.\n\nWhat is the difference between EDI and EDII? The main difference between Early Decision I and Early Decision II is the application deadline. The deadline for Early Decision I is November 1, with decision notification in mid-December. The deadline for Early Decision II is January 3, with decision notification in late-January.\n\nWhat about financial aid? All applicants who are U.S. citizens or permanent residents are automatically considered for merit-based aid. If you are interested in receiving need-based financial assistance, you must submit both the College Scholarship Service (CSS) Profile application and the Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA) by the admission application deadline. If admitted to Rensselaer, you will receive a financial aid award along with or shortly after your acceptance. International students are not eligible for financial aid.\n\nEarly Decision Agreement Form: If you submit an Early Decision application, you must also submit a signed Early Decision Agreement Form. This may be completed electronically through the Common Application or Coalition Application. Students using the Candidate's Choice Application should complete the ED agreement form through their application status portal.\n\nUnder the Early Decision Plan, an applicant may apply to only one institution as an Early Decision Candidate. Applicants may apply to other institutions provided that none of the applications are made under an Early Decision or an applicable Early Restrictive Action Plan. The obligation stated here and as defined by the National Association for College Admission Counseling (NACAC) is a commitment on the part of the applicant to withdraw any other applications and to initiate no new applications if accepted under an institution’s Early Decision Plan (this commitment is binding only if the institution offers sufficient financial aid).\n\nWhile a fall term start is typically recommended, a small group of first-year students begin their studies in the spring term each year for a variety of reasons. The application deadline for first-year students for a spring term (January) start is November 1.\n\nPlease note, a spring start may not be an option for all majors/programs.\n\nStudents who apply for a fall term start may be offered the opportunity to begin in the spring term (January), rather than the fall (September). Details of the start term will be clearly detailed in the acceptance letter.\n\nPlease note that Rensselaer considers any student with 12 or more transferable college credits completed after high school as a transfer student.\n\nSpring Admission FAQs\n\nThis streamlined application is available to students who have expressed an interest in Rensselaer (available to first-year students only).\n\nPlease note that students applying to the Accelerated Physician-Scientist (B.S./M.D.) Program cannot apply using the Candidate’s Choice Application.\n\nImportant note for students using the Candidate's Choice Application: Any credentials submitted through Naviance may only be received by Rensselaer if the applicant has submitted the Common Application.\n\nIn order for us to receive your documents, you must indicate inside of Naviance that you are NOT using the Common App to apply to RPI. Once you do that, your counselor should be able to choose to send your supporting documents to us electronically through Parchment. Documents may also be sent via SCOIR.\n\nBe sure to monitor your application portal to ensure that we receive all of your supporting documents.\n\nAny student who applies to attend Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute as an undergraduate in the fall of 2025 will be able to choose whether or not to submit SAT or ACT scores. This is a continuation of the temporary suspension of our standardized testing requirement, and it will be re-evaluated for the fall 2026 application cycle. Test-Optional FAQs\n\nDue to Albany Medical College requirements, students applying to the Physician-Scientist Program will be required to submit the appropriate test scores.\n\nReport your test scores to our office. Rensselaer allows most students* to self-report test scores on the application or through their application portal (available after an application is submitted). Students who choose to enroll at Rensselaer will be required to send their official scores from the testing agency (if they have not already done so). Test scores that appear on an official high school transcript submitted by your school will be considered official test scores. Be sure to check your online application status page to ensure that the scores are processed into your file.\n\nSAT Institutional Code: 2757\n\nACT College Code: 2866\n\n*Students applying to the accelerated medical program will be required to send official scores at the time of application. Also, official results of English Proficiency Exams will be required at the time of application.\n\nStandardized Test Requirements\n\nThe application fee is waived for all applicants who submit by December 1!\n\nThe nonrefundable application processing fee is $70. Credit card payments should be made through the individual application websites (or through your application portal if you used the Candidate's Choice Application). If you do not wish to pay by credit card, please mail check or money order, payable to Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute, to the mailing address shown in the sidebar. Include your full name and date of birth with your payment. Do not send cash. Please note that the application fee is waived for Rensselaer Medalists.\n\nFee Waiver Eligibility & Instructions\n\nIf your total family income is $70,000 or less, and the application fee presents a hardship for you and your family, you may qualify for a fee waiver.\n\nTo request a fee waiver, ask your high school guidance counselor, principal, or other school official to fill out the SAT Request for Waiver of College Application Fee form or to submit an official letter on your behalf. We will also accept the ACT, College Bound, or NACAC Fee waiver forms.\n\nYou may assume the waiver has been granted unless you hear otherwise from us. Be sure to check your online application status page to ensure that your request has been received and processed.\n\nThe form, or official letter, may be emailed to adm_updates@rpi.edu or mailed to \"Fee Waiver Request\" at the mailing address shown in the sidebar.\n\nDeadline: The annual application deadline is November 1. Please note that you cannot apply Early Decision/Early Action to the Physician-Scientist Program, and the application is non-binding. All applications must be made complete by November 10 in order to be considered. All standardized tests (ACT/SAT) must be taken by the November test date.\n\nApplication: There is no separate application for the program. You must use the Common App and select the \"Regular Decision\" option. You must select “Physician-Scientist Program-B.S./M.D.” as your major on your application. Students may not apply to the accelerated medical program using the Coalition Application or the Candidate’s Choice Application. Please be advised that Albany Medical College will consider applicants to only ONE of their three combined degree programs. Dual applications will not be considered - applicants who apply to more than one of Albany Medical College's joint programs will be administratively withdrawn by AMC.\n\nRequired Courses: Applicants should meet the basic requirements for admission to Rensselaer, which include three years of science (including biology, chemistry and lab-based physics) and four years of mathematics through pre-calculus (calculus recommended).\n\nEssay: Students applying for this program will be prompted for a program-specific essay (state your reasons for aspiring to a career in medicine) when they complete the Common App. The essay should be approximately 500-750 words.\n\nResearch Experience: Since this accelerated program is research-focused, it is highly recommended that applicants have some sort of research experience in high school, which should be clearly articulated on the application.\n\nStandardized Testing Requirements: All standardized tests must be taken by the November test date. It is recommended that students taking the November test have their scores rush sent to Rensselaer. Self-reported scores will not be accepted for applicants to this program.\n\nApplicants to the Physician-Scientist Program should submit official scores from EITHER the SAT or the ACT.\n\nThe writing portion is NOT required for either exam.\n\nSelf-reported scores will not be accepted for accelerated program applicants.\n\nWe cannot accept test scores later than the November test date for applicants to the Physician-Scientist Program.\n\nApplication Process: Rensselaer will review the applications and refer qualified students to Albany Medical College (AMC), which will then review the applications and reach out to certain students for an interview (in January, February, or March). From that pool of students, AMC will make offers of admission to the program. The application process is lengthy and notification begins in early April. Due to the nature of the program, students enrolled in the accelerated medical program are not able to dual or double major.\n\n* Please note — international students (including Canadian citizens) may not apply to the Physician-Scientist program.\n\nCongratulations on being named a Rensselaer Medalist! We look forward to reviewing your application to Rensselaer.\n\nYou may use any of the applications we accept to apply, and, as a Medalist, your application fee is waived. All other requirements are the same as for all incoming freshman applicants.\n\nEvery year, we accept hundreds of Medalists into our freshman class; however, please note that being named a Medalist is not an automatic acceptance to Rensselaer.\n\nTo receive the Medal Scholarship, you must apply, be accepted, and enroll at Rensselaer. Please be sure to mention on your application that you are a Medalist.\n\nMedalist Scholarship: As a Medalist, should you apply, be accepted, and enroll at Rensselaer, you will receive a merit scholarship with a value of $40,000 per year. This award is guaranteed to be applied to your tuition for each year of your undergraduate study at Rensselaer. As a Medalist, if you enroll in our School of Architecture, your scholarship will be extended to cover the fifth year of the program.\n\nAccelerated Programs: As a Medalist, if you enroll in our Physician-Scientist Program, your Medal Scholarship will only apply to the financial aid package you receive for the three years you are studying on Rensselaer’s campus.\n\nRensselaer Medallion: As a Medalist, if you enroll at Rensselaer, you will receive your Medallion at Honors Convocation in the fall of your freshman year.\n\nMedal Selection: Medalists are chosen by each individual participating high school, and Rensselaer provides general guidelines for selecting a Medalist. Each high school selects their Medalist differently, so contact your guidance office to see if your high school participates and what their selection process entails.\n\nRensselaer has a strong history of collaboration with, and support of, the U.S. military. The campus hosts Reserve Officers’ Training Corps (ROTC) units for the Air Force, Army, and Navy. The Institute has been educating Naval flag officers, particular in the Civil Engineer Corps, since the 1860s, and, with the exception of the United States Naval Academy, has trained more U.S. Naval Flag officers than any other school in the nation.\n\nWe are continually recognized as a top-ranked school for veterans - #26 in Best Colleges for Veterans according to U.S. News & World Report (2022). We welcome veterans and their dependents; our goal is to assist you and/or your dependent(s) as you all work toward your educational aspirations.\n\nBelow are some steps to consider as you submit your application to Rensselaer.\n\n1. Determine if you should apply as a transfer or first-year student.\n\nIf you have 12 or more transferable credits after completion of high school, you should apply as a transfer student.\n\nIf you have completed Navy Nuclear Power Training School, you are eligible for 31 credits and should apply as a transfer student.\n\nIf you have fewer than 12 transferable credits, you should apply as a freshman.\n\n2. Submit your application and required materials before the appropriate deadline for either transfer or freshman admission.\n\nWe encourage students to apply electronically. If you intend to use Yellow Ribbon benefits to pay for your Rensselaer education, we require you to indicate your eligibility on the application in order to include you on our list of prospective Yellow Ribbon scholarship recipients.\n\n3. Apply for VA Educational Benefits.\n\nOnce you have applied for your benefits, you will receive a Certificate of Eligibility (COE) which you will need to submit, via email, to the following:\n\nTracey Dame, Assistant Director of Financial Aid: damet2@rpi.edu or 518-276-6813\n\nKelly Dalheim, Associate Registrar and School Certifying Official: dalhek@rpi.edu or 518-276-6996\n\nIf you are eligible to receive Yellow Ribbon benefits, please note that we offer a Yellow Ribbon scholarship of $35,000 per year to up to 75 students at a time. We provide this scholarship on a first-come, first-served basis on the order of enrollment deposit date for students who self-identify as being Yellow Ribbon-eligible on their application for admission. Students who do not indicate that they may be eligible will be placed on a waitlist for the scholarship. A Yellow Ribbon recipient is not eligible to receive other Rensselaer scholarship or grant aid programs.\n\nPlease note, you will not receive a financial aid award that is inclusive of any/all veteran educational benefits until the COE is received.\n\nIf you have any questions, please contact Meg Whalen, Veterans’ Admissions Coordinator, at doppm@rpi.edu.\n\nGI Bill® is a registered trademark of the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs (VA). More information about education benefits offered by VA is available at the official U.S. government website.\n\nOther Useful Resources\n\nTo assist veterans in understanding higher education costs, financial aid, and other useful information the Department of Education and the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau has developed the following tools:\n\nCollege Scorecard: A consumer planning tool and resource to assist prospective students and their families as they evaluate options in selecting a school.\n\nCollege Navigator: Provides school information including tuition and fees, retention rates, use of financial aid, student loan default rates and features a cost comparison tool.\n\nFinancial Aid Shopping Sheet: Provides a model aid award letter designed to simplify the information that prospective students receive about costs and financial aid so they can easily compare institutions and make informed decisions about where to attend school.\n\nPaying for College: A web page that can be used by prospective students to enter the names of up to three schools and receive detailed information on each one and to enter actual financial aid award information.\n\nIf you do not currently hold a B.S/B.A. degree in any field, but are interested in taking courses on a non-matriculated basis, you should complete the Non-Matriculated Undergraduate Student Application.\n\nIf you hold a B.S./B.A. degree, please visit the Graduate Admissions site for additional information. Please note that the Rensselaer computer store is not able to sell laptop computers to non-matriculated students.\n\nThere is no application fee for non-matriculated applicants. Please have most recent transcript(s) sent to the address shown in the sidebar. Transcripts being sent electronically may be addressed to adm_updates@rpi.edu.\n\nCenter for Talented Youth (CTY) Scholarships\n\nIf you are interested in using a CTY scholarship to take courses at Rensselaer, you should complete the Non-Matriculated Undergraduate Student Application (including an indication of the class desired) along with an uploaded copy of the CTY award letter. We will also require an official copy of your high school transcript.\n\nPlease have your transcripts sent to the address shown in the sidebar, attention Center for Talented Youth. Transcripts being sent electronically may be addressed to adm_updates@rpi.edu.\n\nIf you have any questions, please contact Ulysses deArmas."
