        "text": "SMITH Dr. Edwin Ide Smith was born to Dr. Charles Carroll and Lila Ide Smith on May 13, 1924, in Norfolk, Virginia. He died Aug. 6, 2003, in Dallas, Texas. He attended Maury High School in Norfolk, Harvard College, Georgetown University Medical School and graduated from Johns Hopkins School of Medicine in 1948. He completed surgical internships, residencies and fellowships in general and pediatric surgery at Johns Hopkins, Boston Children's Hospital, and Vanderbilt University Hospital. He also completed a year of research in 194849 in the Department of Embryology of the Carnegie Institution. After practicing general surgery with his father, he enjoyed a long career in pediatric surgery, beginning at Kings Daughters Hospital in Norfolk. In 1963 he became associate professor of surgery at University of Missouri School of Medicine and surgeon-in-chief at Children's Mercy Hospital, Kansas City, Missouri. In 1968 he accepted a similar position at the University of Oklahoma Children's Memorial Hospital, Oklahoma City, where he developed a pediatric surgery residency program. Both physicians he trained and grateful parents remember fondly his time in Oklahoma. He was part of a team that separated conjoined twins in 1970. After retiring from OU in 1989 he was recruited to develop a pediatric surgery residence program at University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center and moved to Dallas, Texas. After five years he retired from his position as emeritus professor in pediatric surgery and chairman of the division of pediatric surgery. At the time of his retirement, his children helped establish a professorship in his honor at UT Southwestern. Upon his retirement from clinical practice, he held teaching appointments and was on the affiliate staff of Children's Medical Center, had a teaching appointment at Parkland Memorial Hospital, and was an honorary staff member at St. Paul Medical Center and Zale Lipshy University Hospital, all of Dallas. He served as adjunct professor at the SMU Law School and taught a class in Law, Literature and Medicine with Professor Tom Mayo. He was a founding member of the American Pediatric Surgical Association and the Lilliputian Surgical Society, a charter member of the American Burn Association and other medical societies, including the Southern Surgical Association, the American Academy of Pediatrics, where he was chairman of the surgical section, and the American Association for the Surgery of Trauma. He was also president of the Oklahoma Surgical Society and authored numerous professional publications. He was a Navy veteran, serving as a hospital corpsman in 1944 and as a physician in the Naval Service from 195052. He married Matilda Janet Snelling in West Hartford, Conn., on March 31, 1951. His family grew to include three children, and one of the joys of his life was vacationing and spending time with them and later his grandchildren. He is survived by Til, his wife of 52 years; daughter, Sarah Crotty and her husband, Bob, of Dallas; daughter, Susie Thurmond and her husband, Pete; of Cheyenne, OK; son, the Rev. Charlie Smith and his wife, Diana; grandchildren, Bobby and Becky Crotty, and Katie, Allison and Patrick Thurmond. He had a lifelong love of sports, participating in varsity track at Maury High School and Harvard, and played tennis, often with his wife, until late in his life. He always expressed appreciation for the wide-open spaces and large sky of the Southwest. The grandson of a Lutheran pastor, he joined the Episcopal Church at marriage, and was a member and usher at St. Michael's and All Angels Episcopal Church in Dallas. A memorial service in celebration of his life and witness to his resurrection is scheduled for 10 a.m. Saturday at St. Michael's and All Angels, 8011 Douglas at Colgate, Dallas, Texas 75225. In lieu of flowers, the family requests that memorial contributions be made to the Edwin Ide Smith, M.D. Professorship in Pediatric Surgery at UT Southwestern Medical Center, P.O. Box 910888, Dallas, Texas 75391-0888 or to the St. Michael's Foundation. SPARKMAN/HILLCREST 7405 W. NORTHWEST HWY, DALLAS, TEXAS 75225. 214-363-5401\n\nArchive ID: 1429032"
