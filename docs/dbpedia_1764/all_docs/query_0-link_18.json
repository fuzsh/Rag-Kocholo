Cappella, mother Joan Grant Cappella, brother Larry Cappella, and mother-in-law Irena Halstead.\n\nAlan was born in Milford, Connecticut December 30, 1959. He grew up in West Haven Connecticut, graduated: with a BA from Houghton College, from Moody Bible Institute’s Advanced Studies Program, and earned an MLIS from Rosary College. While employed as circulation supervisor at Moody Bible Institute’s library Alan met his wife Wendy; they married June 22, 1991. Alan accepted the librarian position at the Word of Life Bible Institute (WOLBI) in 1998. Alan enjoyed interacting with staff and students, worked diligently at developing a library collection to best support WOLBI's biblical and theological courses of study. Alan especially loved that WOLBI encouraged him to meet regularly with students for biblical discipleship. Alan made time to get to know well each student he discipled, listening, praying with them, sharing biblical truth with them, and supporting personal growth in their relationship with Jesus Christ. The disabling effects of Parkinson’s disease forced Alan to retire early (June 2021), however it was a recent diagnosis of an advanced stage of oropharyngeal cancer which all too quickly overcame Alan’s body.\n\nAlan was a loving and dedicated husband and father who prioritized his relationship with God and openly lived out his faith in the Lord Jesus Christ. Alan strongly supported Wendy throughout all the years of homeschooling their children. Alan loved the outdoors and took every opportunity to enjoy it with his family.

Alan was gifted with a special ability to play the piano and loved to use his playing to worship his Lord at home and in the churches he belonged to for over 50 years.\n\nAlan is no longer suffering; he now has a transformed body because of God's resurrection power (Bible references: 1 Thessalonians 4:13-18, Philippians 3:20-21). While a student at Houghton College Alan understood and believed the Bible's clear message of God's sacrificial love for him, he made the life-changing decision to believe on the Lord Jesus Christ, and he received God's gift of eternal life. By faith, Alan trusted in Jesus Christ's death on the cross to be the all-sufficient payment for his sins (and the sins of all of mankind). (Bible references: John 3:16, Romans 3:23, Romans 5:8, Romans 6:23, Romans 8:1, Romans 10:9).\n\nA celebration of life service will be held on Saturday, March 16, 2024 at Faith Bible Church, 15 Foster Flats Rd Chestertown, NY.
