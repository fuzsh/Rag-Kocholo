        "text": "New York State’s Sex Offender Registry was created by the state’s Sex Offender Registration Act. It is intended to provide the public with information on the status and location of sex offenders residing in New York State.\n\nWhat are the listed offender levels?\n\nThe type of information that is available to the public about an offender depends on an offender’s risk level, of which there are three:\n\nLevel 1: low risk of re-offense: Residence information for these offenders is limited to zip code information.\n\nLevel 2: medium risk of re-offense: Complete residence address is available for these offenders\n\nLevel 3: high risk of re-offense: Complete residence address is available for these offenders\n\nOffenders are listed by their real names and any aliases. A variety of information is available, including:\n\nResidence address(es)\n\nWork address(es)\n\nCrime of conviction\n\nVehicle information\n\nConditions of supervision (parole or probation)\n\nMultiple photos, names/aliases and home/work addresses are made available on the Registry, as they become available and when applicable.\n\nThe Division of Criminal Justice Services is responsible for maintaining the Sex Offender Registry.\n\nSearch the Public Registry of Sex Offenders:\n\nSEARCH\n\neAlerts through NY-Alert\n\nIn addition to providing information about Level 2 and 3 offenders via the DCJS website, New Yorkers may sign up to receive alerts via e-mail, text, fax or telephone whenever an offender moves to, or from, a community of interest – their home, work or child’s school, for example.\n\nDCJS offers sex offender relocation notices through the state’s NY-Alert system. Individuals can register up to three locations, either by county/municipality, ZIP Code or specific address, or any combination of those three options, for which they would like to receive relocation alerts."
