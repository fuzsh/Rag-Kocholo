For 30 years, she has been trying to pass on those values to her students.\" [www.cbs.com]\n\nDecember 27, 2000\n\nUSA TODAY\n\nIn a lengthy cover story, USA Today profiled Smith President Ruth Simmons, describing her as \"opportunity personified.\" Simmons' appointment to the presidency of Brown University ­ the first black president of an Ivy League institution ­ \"represents a breakthrough in terms of the recognition of people for their ability,\" noted Shirley Ann Jackson, president of Rennselaer Poytechnic University. \"It's a very significant milestone in a much longer journey,\" observed Stanley Ikenberry, president of the American Council on Education. [www.usatoday.com]\n\nDecember 22, 2000\n\nCHRISTIAN SCIENCE MONITOR\n\nAs he approaches his final weeks in office, President Clinton is considering invoking his presidential powers to grant pardons to prominent figures facing legal trouble. But speculation is also brewing about whether President George W. Bush might grant a pardon to Clinton if he ever were to be convicted of any impeachment-related crimes. Government professor Don Robinson: \"Will Bush pardon Clinton? I doubt it, but who knows? It would be a fairly spectacular act. Would Gore have pardoned Clinton? We'll never know.\" [www.csmonitor.com]\n\nDecember 19, 2000\n\nBOSTON GLOBE\n\nAn article on the increase in Americans earning college diplomas was accompanied by a photo of 86-year-old Ada Comstock Scholar Anne Martindell, walking across the Smith campus in conversation with a traditionally aged undergraduate. [www.boston.com/globe]\n\nDecember 17, 2000\n\n(ALBANY) TIMES-UNION\n\nSmith writer-in-residence Kurt Vonnegut has been named State Author for New York, a two-year honor that Gov. George Pataki will bestow upon him at a ceremony in Albany in January. In a profile of the former Albany-area resident (from 1947 to 1950 he lived in Schenectady County and worked as a public relations writer for GE), the Times Union described Vonnegut as struggling with writing even today. \"Everybody should write to find out who they are and where they are,\" Vonnegut advised. \"Right now, though, I'm thinking I want to turn the typewriter into a musical instrument because I can really play it. I do finger exercises in the morning and hope something else will come out.\" [www.timesunion.com]\n\nDecember 15, 2000\n\nWBUR \"THE CONNECTION\"\n\nAssociate Curator of Rare Books Karen Kukil joined Professor Lynda Bundtzen from Williams College and \"Connection\" host Christopher Lydon for a discussion of new scholarship on Sylvia Plath. The occasion for the program was the publication of \"The Unabridged Journals of Sylvia Plath, 1950 ­ 1962,\" edited by Kukil. The new volume begins in 1950, when Plath was preparing to matriculate at Smith, and continues through the summer of 1962, just prior to her suicide at age 30. [www.wbur.org]\n\nDecember 13, 2000\n\nCHRISTIAN SCIENCE MONITOR\n\nThe Texas Rangers' signing of shortstop Alex Rodriguez to a 10-year, $252 million contract spotlighted the imbalance between baseball's rich and poorer teams, a situation that concerns economist (and baseball fan) Andy Zimbalist. \"Baseball has to deal with its financial imbalance,\" Zimbalist told the Monitor. \"Something needs to be done, and this is one more piece of evidence that baseball is out of whack.\" [www.csmonitor.com]\n\nDecember 13, 2000\n\nNEW YORK TIMES\n\nWhile shortstop Alex Rodriguez's $252 million, ten-year contact with the Texas Rangers drew allegations of extravagance, economist Andy Zimbalist demonstrated some of the business reasons it makes sense ­ at least for the team's owner. What's less clear, Zimbalist argued in an op-ed, is how Major League Baseball expects to maintain healthy competition ­ and, by extension, public interest ­ when the richest teams increasingly dominate the championships. \"[A]s happened in the Subway Series, inequality has gone too far. Too many Americans, feeling left out, will yawn and turn away.\" [www.csmonitor.com]\n\nDecember 7, 2000\n\nATLANTA JOURNAL-CONSTITUTION\n\nDuring meetings with alumnae in Atlanta, Smith President Ruth Simmons took time to visit Benjamin Mays High School, where the vast majority of students are African American. Stepping out of her college-president role, Simmons became \"part motivational speaker, a tipster with inside information and a big sister to an invited group of students, mostly females, who are college bound.\" Simmons exhorted the students to resist attempts to channel them toward less challenging coursework. \"If you want to achieve at the highest level,\" she told them, \"you have to study broadly. \"Don't work just for grades. If you learn, that's worth much more to you than a grade. Recognize the value of what you have and take advantage of it.\" [www.ajc.com]\n\nDecember 4, 2000\n\nTHE NATION\n\nIn the last 15 years, noted historian Lawrence Glickman, consumer culture has become a focal concern of social historians. Glickman reviewed \"An All-Consuming Century: Why Commercialism Won in Modern America,\" positioning it as the successor to Daniel Horowitz's \"still-impressive but less wide-ranging 'The Morality of Spending' (1985),\" once \"the definitive survey of the history of modern American consumer society.\" [www.thenation.com]\n\nDecember 3, 2000\n\nBOSTON HERALD\n\nIn its quarterly Learning section, the Boston Herald showcased Smith's Ada Comstock Scholars program, which is celebrating its 25th anniversary this year. To date, more than 1,400 \"Adas\" ­ women beyond the traditional college age whose educations had been interrupted earlier in their lives ­ have graduated from Smith and gone on to careers in fiends ranging from education to medicine, from financial services to the arts. Economist Randall Bartlett praised the contributions that Adas make in the classroom and to the Smith community at large: \"Adas aren't afraid to challenge a faculty member or to ask an embarrassing question. They don't worry about being uncool. They are hungry to learn and, in their hunger, they challenge us all to go farther, press deeper.\" [www.bostonherald.com]\n\nDecember 3, 2000\n\nWALL STREET JOURNAL\n\nIn a new twist on the corporate recruiting process, investment banking and consulting firms are increasingly using standardized tests to assess candidates' skills. Employers say the tests provide multiple ways for prospective employees to demonstrate their capabilities. But Paula Zimmer, employer relations director at Smith's Career Development Office, was dubious. \"I don't believe standardized tests measure students' business savvy or intelligence,\" she noted.\n\nDecember 2000\n\nTOWN & COUNTRY\n\nUnder the headline \"Creative Charity,\" Town and Country highlighted 18 possibilities for philanthropic holiday gifts ­ among them Smith's Ada Comstock Scholars program for women beyond the traditional college age. \"You can send one Ada, as they're known ­ often a grandmother or single mother ­ to school part-time for one year for $12,000 in tuition costs, and full-time for $24,000, or endow a permanent scholarship in the name of the woman you love for $1 million. For $600, you can cover the costs of an Ada's books and supplies for a year.\""
