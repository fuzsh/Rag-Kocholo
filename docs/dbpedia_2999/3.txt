Historical Family Collections and Bible Collections

A Listing of Historical Family Collections with Granville residents found in local libraries

(Transcribed by Deloris Williams)

Family documents contributed to various institutions, libraries, and universities can be a valuable asset in researching one's ancestors. They can contain many things, including family histories, bibles, plantation records, deeds, slave records of all kinds, personal letters and other correspondence. North Carolina is fortunate to have many such collections, some of which I am listing below along with the time period covered and linked to the institution where it is housed with a more complete description by clicking onto the title of the collection. Note that some of the collections have been digitized and images of actual documents are included to read online or download, so I suggest that you look through them thoroughly. As I locate other collections with genealogical material, it will be added to this page, and listed as ***New***
