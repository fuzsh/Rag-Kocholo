He also wrote;\n\nLewis (TV Series) (screenplay – 4 episodes, 2010 – 2012) (story – 1 episode, 2006)\n\n– Fearful Symmetry (2012) … (screenplay)\n\n– Old, Unhappy, Far Off Things (2011) … (screenplay)\n\n– Falling Darkness (2010) … (screenplay)\n\n– The Dead of Winter (2010) … (screenplay)\n\n– Reputation (2006) … (story)\n\nHe also wrote the Morse episode, ‘The Way Through the Woods’.\n\nSYNOPSIS\n\n“The unspeakable in pursuit of the uneatable!” Oscar Wilde.\n\nMidsomer murders meets Agatha Christie meets Blood Bath at the OK Corrall meets Blue Velvet.\n\nHere is the opening of the film, Blue Velvet, by the wonderful David Lynch\n\nHere is the opening of Confection.\n\nREVIEW.\n\n(warning, this review will contain some spoilers)\n\nIt’s a shame that the three pieces of classical music used in the ‘Confection’ episode are so short and that one of those pieces is the bland Vienna Blood Waltz Overture by Johann Strauss. I suppose it’s better than nothing, but…\n\nI think this Russell has forgotten that classical music is part of not only Morse himself but the Morse universe. Classical music is the connective tissue that umbilically links the three series. Or at least it did until the last two series of Endeavour where we find that classical music is pushed aside for rock and pop music of the era. We had one episode in the last series, ‘Colours’, that had NO classical music.\n\nThe Endeavour series is losing interest in its parents, Morse, Lewis and Colin Dexter and like an unruly teenager has decided that it doesn’t care about its heritage, its responsibility and it’s genetic inheritance. I believe it is because of this that the series is dying a slow and painful death.\n\nRussell Lewis adopted Colin Dexter’s child but has began to neglect it in favour of showy references, a turgid love story and plots that have about as much substance, in regard to a crime drama, as a game of Cluedo. You are not only letting down the viewers but you are also letting down the actors and the crew. They are all doing sterling work in creating the world of Endeavour. But, you are not giving them the ammunition to shoot a first class series. The ammunition you are supplying is damp squibs and blanks.\n\nMr Lewis, before you write series seven, sit down in front of your television and watch all 33 episodes of the original Morse series. Watch and revel in the quality of the writing and the storytelling. Watch and admire your own first three series of Endeavour.\n\nThen put your best record on loud as it’ll play and with every note, you remember there’s something that the darkness can’t take from you. That you are a great writer and can make series seven the best series ever written for the Morse universe.\n\nHere is that synopsis of the Agatha Christie novel, The Moving Finger.\n\nWhen troubled war veteran Jerry Burton and his sister Joanna relocate to the quiet little village of Lymstock in order to allow Jerry to recuperate from injuries received in what he claims is a motorcycle accident, they are expecting nothing more than country sleepiness and tedium. Much to their surprise, however, they find themselves embroiled in the middle of scandal and secrets; someone is sending vicious poison-pen letters to the residents. A local dignitary has already taken his own life over the letters, and it’s not long before local gossip Mona Symmington also commits suicide after receiving a letter. But when the letter-writer apparently resorts to murder, Jerry finds his curiosity stoked despite himself, and he’s not the only one; Miss Jane Marple is also in Lymstock, and she’s decided that it’s long past time someone got to the bottom of this unpleasant business.\n\nDOES THAT SOUND FAMILIAR? It wouldn’t surprise if the Christie estate didn’t sue Russell Lewis for plagiarism.\n\nEpisode Jag Rating – out of 10.\n\nMUSIC\n\nThe music mentioned below is from the original British Broadcast. Due to copyright reasons the music may differ in other countries.\n\nDarlene wrote this in the comments regarding the song used in the USA episode to replace the Roy Orbison song, ” I continued researching and located the music studio (DNA Music Ltd) who worked with Barrington Pheloung and often provided the talent and music supervision for him and Endeavour. The talent agent/music supervisor, Amanda Street, responded to my message in Facebook.She said the producers wanted a Roy Orbison vibe and so DNA hired the songwriter Tom Kelly (I’ll Stand by You, Like a Virgin) to write the song and singer, songwriter, composer, Tim Dickinson, in the UK to sing the song.”\n\n————————————————-\n\nIt is the Vienna Blood Waltz Overture by Johann Strauss.\n\n——————————————–\n\nMorse is sitting in his office at about one hour and 17 minutes and is listening to music as Jim Strange appears.\n\n——————————————\n\nWhen Ronnie hands over a brown envelope, in the pub, to Fred we can hear the song Sleepwalking by the Shadows. Thank you to Alan for spotting that song.\n\n———————————————-\n\nHe is listening to Bellini’s opera Norma in particular the aria Casta Diva.\n\n———————————————————–\n\nWhen Fred goes up to order a another two pints for him and Ronnie we hear P.P Arnold’s ‘The First Cut is the Deepest’.\n\n——————————————–\n\nDuring Mr and Mrs Bright dinner they are listening to Chopin’s Nocturne Op.9, No.2.\n\n—————————————————-\n\nKudos go to Alison one of my subscribers who mentioned in the comments section that there was a piece of classic music at the scene when the riders and the hounds return from the hunt and then have a spot of lunch. The piece is Mozart’s Divertimento in D K136. Thank you Alison and well spotted.\n\nLITERARY REFERENCES.\n\nStrange joins Morse and Max at the dead body of a drug user. Strange says to Max, “Choked on his own puke, has he?” Max replies, “Been at the Keats again, Sergeant?” Max is of course referring to the romantic poet of the late 18thC and early 19thC John Keats.\n\nART\n\nStonor Park Dining Room. The large panoramic painting on the wall is by Dufours of 1815.\n\nHere is a better look at the painting.\n\nThe other paintings I don’t recognise but they are probably all portraits of family members.\n\nLOCATIONS\n\nHere we have what is the chocolate factory. It is in fact Kempton Steam Museum. This location was also used in the Endeavour episode ‘Game’. It was the place of work of the young black lad, Smalls.\n\n——————————————————\n\nThank you to Paul who reliably informs me that the internal scenes of the factory were filmed at Fullers Brewery, Chiswick.\n\n—————————————————\n\nShown near the beginning of the episode as the milk van drives past. This house is right beside the Cottage Bookshop.\n\n————————————————–\n\nThe Cresswell’s beautiful Manor House. It is in fact Stonor, Henley-on-Thames RG9 6HF.\n\n—————————————-\n\nScene of the dead drug taker. Unidentified.\n\n——————————————–\n\nThis is where Thursday sees Jago taking a package and putting it in his trouser pocket. Thursday thinks it is drugs.\n\nHolywell Street has also been used in the Endeavour episodes ‘Girl’ (S1E1) and ‘Home’ (S1E4)\n\n——————————————————-\n\nBell’s farm.\n\nThanks to Kyle who identified the above as Rockwell End nr Frieth, Buckinghamshire.\n\n———————————————————\n\nThe village high street.\n\nThe actual location is the Cottage Bookshop, Elm Rd, Penn, High Wycombe HP10 8LB.\n\nSadly the bookshop closed last year after 60 years of trading.\n\nMrs Clamp’s shop is also Elm Rd, Penn, High Wycombe HP10 8LB.\n\nThis is also in Elm Road, High Wycombe next to the bookshop.\n\n———————————————–\n\nEndeavour going to meet Max about the boy who committed suicide. This is Oriel College.\n\n‘Regnante Carolo’ is carved into the parapet to commemorate the reign of Charles I in which the Quad was finished. The phrase means ‘Charles, being King’.\n\n00h33m45s\n\nMax and Endeavour walk through Oriel College.\n\n——————————————\n\nThe pond where Endeavour meets Isla Fairford is in the middle of the village where much of the scenes were filmed,\n\n—————————————————–\n\nThe library where Max and Reginald have that talk.\n\nThis is the Goodman Library and Morris Room in the Oxford union library.\n\n——————————————-\n\nIsla and her father’s house. Unidentified.\n\n——————————————-\n\nMorse attends a car crash as requested by Bright.\n\n————————————\n\nWhere Morse finds Thursday at the end of the episode.\n\n64 High Street Old Town in Hemel Hempstead. This restaurant was used as the setting for the crime drama Pie in the Sky which starred the late actor Richard Griffiths. For Morse connection see below.\n\nPUB LOCATIONS\n\nMorse and Isla have a drink.\n\n———————————————\n\nThursday and Box have a cosy chat and a drink.\n\nI believe that the two ‘pubs’ are film sets built specifically for the episode. Sadly another tradition gone from the Morse universe; using real pubs in Oxfordshire.\n\nActors who appeared in the Endeavour Series 6, Episode 3 ‘CONFECTION’ and/or Morse or Lewis.\n\nChristopher Bowen who played the vet Charles Shepherd was in the Lewis episode ‘Dark Matter’ (S4E2) as Professor Andrew Crompton.\n\nWe also have the actor Sophie Stanton who was Letty Clump .\n\nSophie appeared in the Lewis episode, The Mind has Mountains (series 5, episode 3) as Shauna Malin.\n\nCONNECTIONS OTHER THAN ACTORS TO THE LEWIS AND ORIGINAL MORSE SERIES\n\nThe above and the plot owes a great deal to the Morse episode Happy Families, series 6, episode 2. That episode was also about a hate campaign though that hate campaign was against a rich family and Morse and was initiated by the press.\n\n—————————————————-\n\nAnd a certain Kent Finn appears again if only in book form.\n\nAs most of you will know I believe that Kent Finn is the notorious Hugo DeVries from the Morse episode Masonic Mysteries. Kent Finn appeared in the Endeavour episode ‘Game’ (S4E1). We see one of his books, ‘Just for Jolly’ in the episode, ‘Muse’ (S5E1). Kent Finn was mentioned in this episode, ‘Lazaretto (S4E3)’ by the hospital librarian, Lester Fagen, when offering books to CS Bright.\n\nKent Finn as played by Adam James in ‘Game’\n\n————————————————\n\nClemmie was referred to as a ‘brood mare’ when she was caught listening at the door as Rupert and Murray argued. That phrase stuck in my mind as I believed it was a phrase used in a Morse episode. A few hours later I remembered. It was said by Dr. Esther Martin as to what John Peter Barrie called her in the excellent Morse episode, ‘Day of the Devil’.\n\nHarriet Walter as Dr. Esther Martin\n\nKeith Allen as John Peter Barrie\n\nIs there any significance to this phrase? I don’t think so. It’s just my Morse addled mind working overtime. But…\n\nStrangely there is another connection to the Morse episode, Day of the Devil, Richard Griffiths. Let’s have a shufty.\n\nRichard Griffiths starred in the crime drama, Pie in the Sky. The restaurant used for the series is the same restaurant we see Morse peering through at the end of the episode.\n\n————————————————–\n\nThe Kempton Steam Engine Museum was also used in the Lewis episode Beyond Good and Evil.\n\nThe episode also had a connection to the Morse episode Sins of the Father. That episode is the one where Morse investigate a murder at a brewery. There is a look about the Kempton Steam Museum that is like the location used in the Morse episode.\n\nThere is also a similarity as to were Stephen Radford in Sins of the Father\n\nAnd Murray Cresswell were found.\n\nMiscellaneous\n\nA foreshadowing of what is to come in the episode, blood and guts.\n\n————————————————————–\n\nHold on to your hats because there is quite a few references to the following children’s British TV shows. First up;\n\nRussell Lewis from the very beginning is shooting references from the hip and these references stir up some happy childhood memories. Chigton Green appears to be a combination of three children’s programmes from the 1960s; Trumpton (the ‘ton’ of Chigton), Chigley, (the ‘chig’ part of Chigton) and Camberwick Green. All three shows were part of the same universe. they all inhabited Trumptonshire.\n\nAll three shows used stop motion not unlike the method used to create the wonderful Wallace and Gromit.\n\n———————————————\n\nHere we go with Russell naming many characters in the episode after characters from the three children’s shows previously mentioned.\n\nThe name of Clamp used in the episode for Sarah and Letty Clamp is a reference to a character in the 1960s Children’s progamme, Trumpton. Mr Clamp was the the greengrocer; his shop is ‘J Clamp & Son’, and his theme song is ‘Come buy my vegetables’.\n\n—————————————————–\n\nAnother Trumpton reference is PC Rich Potter. Police Constable Potter is Trumpton’s policeman.\n\n———————————————————–\n\nMichael Murphy played in the episode by Joe Bone is a reference to Mr Mickey Murphy – the village baker.\n\n———————————————————-\n\nCresswell Confections is a reference to Mr Cresswell – the owner and general manager of the factory in the children’s show Chigley.\n\n—————————————————–\n\nThere is a Mr Carroway the fishmonger in the village.\n\nGuess what. There is a Mr Carraway the fishmonger in Camberwick Green.\n\n———————————————–\n\nThe steam whistle that blows near the beginning of the episode is probably a nod to the buildings real identity, a steam engine museum.\n\n———————————————————\n\nI noted that Barrington Pheloung was back on music duties in this episode rather than Matthew Slater.\n\n———————————————————\n\nAnd a certain Kent Finn appears again if only in book form.\n\nAs most of you will know I believe that Kent Finn is the notorious Hugo DeVries from the Morse episode Masonic Mysteries.\n\n——————————————————-\n\nIn the scene at about 10 minutes we see the fox hunters stuffing their face and quaffing champagne. I wonder if this is a nod to the Oscar Wilde quote, ““The unspeakable in pursuit of the uneatable!”\n\n————————————————————-\n\nGidburys is said to be on the verge of taking over Cresswells, or at least a merger. Gidburys was mentioned in the Endeavour episode, ‘Passenger’ (S5E3)\n\n———————————————–\n\nWhen Morse and Max are in the college attending the suicide of Rufus Bura, Morse notices that he had been listening to Mahler. Mahler is famously (or should that be infamously) noted as music to slit your wrists to as it can be deemed as rather depressing.\n\n————————————————————\n\nWhen Max and Endeavour are talking in the college quad they are discussing the ‘derelict’ who died from the drugs overdose. Endeavour says, “A soldier, possibly.” Max replies, “Known Unto God.” Known unto God is a phrase used on the gravestones of unknown soldiers in Commonwealth War Graves Commission (CWGC) cemeteries. It was devised by Rudyard Kipling.\n\n————————————————–\n\nAs the above scene is closing we hear church bells. A reference to the poem by John Donne?\n\nFor Whom the Bell Tolls by John Donne\n\nNo man is an island,\n\nEntire of itself.\n\nEach is a piece of the continent,\n\nA part of the main.\n\nIf a clod be washed away by the sea,\n\nEurope is the less.\n\nAs well as if a promontory were.\n\nAs well as if a manor of thine own\n\nOr of thine friend’s were.\n\nEach man’s death diminishes me,\n\nFor I am involved in mankind.\n\nTherefore, send not to know\n\nFor whom the bell tolls,\n\nIt tolls for thee.\n\nOr maybe i’m reading to much into such a simple thing as bells ringing.\n\n—————————————————\n\nEndeavour is talking to Ronnie Box about the death of Rufus Bura and how it may be linked to the other deaths. Endeavour says, “I spoke to a Rhodes scholar that Bura played rugby with, name of Clinton.” The Rhodes Scholarship is an international postgraduate award for students to study at the University of Oxford. Clinto refers of course to Bill Clinton. Clinton won a Rhodes Scholarship to University College, Oxford, where he initially read for a B.Phil\n\n———————————————-\n\nBucephalus the name of the horse that was lame and had to be shot is named after the horse of Alexander the Great.\n\nAlexander taming Bucephalus, Edinburgh City Chambers, Scotland.\n\n———————————————\n\nWhen Endeavour arrives to take Isla out on a date her father reads out a crossword clue, “Slaughter horse and worry about it. ” Endeavour answers “Carnage.” For those unsure of cryptic clues in a crossword here is how the answer is formed. Cryptic clues usually have two parts: there will be a word or words that are for example a synonym of the answer, in this ‘slaughter’. Then there will be the ‘cryptic part’ The Horse is a ‘nag’. To worry is to ‘care’. The ‘about it’ part means it wants you to put ‘care’ around the word ‘nag’. Of course a slaughter is a ‘carnage’.\n\nI’m wondering if this is some sort of portentous warning of things to come. Yikes!\n\nUpdate 28th February: A friend on Twitter told me that “The cryptic crossword clue that you spotted… ‘carnage’: at least one French to Spanish translation gives us ‘degüello’ for this…\n\nDegüello is the title of the next #Endeavour episode. Fascinating.\n\n——————————————–\n\nJudith Neal, who moonlights as Miss Ling the agony aunt, tells Endeavour that she uses the Adler favourite Two typewriter as does the the person sending the poison pen letters. Famous names who used an Adler typewriter are; Kingsley Amis, Maya Angelou, Margaret Drabble, Stanley Kubrick and Joe Orton.\n\nThank you to Jeremy who in the comments section wrote the following, “DCI Box refers to the backhander he hands to Thursday as a’bit of bunce’. I’ve always understood this to come from rhyming slang – Bunsen burner meaning ‘earner’.\n\nWhen the name of Cresswell’s is first mentioned, Box says something like ‘What, Milky Boy and all that?’. Clearly a play on white chocolate ‘Milky Bar’ product, but it may also be an obscure reference to the ‘Harry and Paul’ sketch ‘The Landlady and the Confectioner’.\n\n————————————————–\n\nThanks to John and Cheryl who noticed the following; “At 16 minutes the Vet refers to the mother of Rufus having a very overfed Pekingese. This is an oblique reference to Tricky Woo in the James Herriot All Creatures Great And Small books, films and TV series.”\n\n“At 49 minutes we see the hall of the Thursday’s home. The walls are painted blue. Yet a few episodes ago we saw Fred painting them green.”\n\n“We suspect the forename Murray for one of the 2 Cresswell sons is a reference to the confection known as Murray Mints; and\n\nA stretch here but we have a James Bond reference in the choice of location for the home of the Cresswells. Stonor was the Blayden safe house in The Living Daylights.”\n\nFRED THURSDAY’S WORDS OF WISDOM.\n\nNone that I noticed in this episode.\n\nMAX DEBRYN’S WITTICISMS\n\nStrange joins Morse and Max at the dead body of a drug user. Strange says to Max, “Choked on his own puke, has he?” Max replies, “Been at the Keats again, Sergeant?” Max is of course referring to the poet John Keats.\n\n——————————————————\n\nWhen inspecting the dead boy in the bath, Rufus Bura, at a Oxford college, Max says, “It’s all a bit coppery, I’m afraid. Appropriately enough. Just a hint of sucrose.” Morse’s reply is, “Oh, must you? It’s a bloodbath, not a Cotes du Rhone.”\n\n———————————————\n\nTalking to Morse over the dead body of Rufus Bura in a bath, he says, “alles in Ordnung” which translated from the German means, “Everything (is) in order.” Not really witty but very Max.\n\n————————————————-\n\nStanding over Murray’s dead, chocolate covered body, Max says, “I won’t be able to confirm cause until I’ve got his lid off.”\n\n—————————————-\n\nAs above standing over Murray’s body he let’s it be known that he was not killed by a gun. “Could have been done with any number of pointed instruments.” Jago asks, “Such as?” Max replies Oh, a spiked bayonet, medieval misericord, rondel dagger, the Japanese sai.”\n\nTHE MURDERED, THEIR MURDERER/S AND THEIR METHODS.\n\nDrug taker died by overdose. herion laced with quinine. He choked on his own ‘vomitus’.\n\nGreville Cresswell, shot. Killed by Rennet Bell.\n\nMandy-Jane Bell shot by her husband Rennet Bell.\n\nRennet Bell, suicide by shotgun.\n\nRufus Bura, suicide. Slashed his wrists. Rufus killed himself because he felt guilty over the death of the Bells. Rufus was the one who posted Isla’s letters from Oxford.\n\nMurray, death by choloate. 😉 Actually, killed by the vet’s gun that he uses to put down horses. Killed by Isla Fairford.\n\nBRITISH COLLOQUIALISMS TRANSLATED.\n\nMax says to Strange over the dead body of drug taker, “Furthers and betters once I’ve had a fillet.” This refers to additional information required to provide sufficient accuracy.\n\n———————————————-\n\nRonnie asks Fred if he wants to go for a ‘livener’. This is something with an invigorating effect, especially an alcoholic drink.\n\n————————————————-\n\nRonnie Box says to Fred in the pub when he thought Thursday wouldn’t take the envelope full of money, “Blimey For a minute there, you had me giving you two-bob, thrupenny bit.”\n\nThrupney Bit is the shits and two-bob is the squits, (diarrhoea). Sorry for the colourful images.\n\nCAST\n\nJoe Bone as Michael Murphy\n\nOliver Farnworth as PC Rich Potter\n\nChristopher Harper as John Hazel\n\nKatie Goldfinch as Sarah Clamp\n\nSean Rigby as DS Jim Strange\n\nRoger Allam as DI Fred Thursday\n\nShaun Evans as DS Endeavour Morse\n\nJack Hawkins as Murray Creswell\n\nClaudia Jolly as Clemmie Creswell\n\nBen Lamb as Rupert Creswell\n\nAbigail Thaw as Dorothea Frazil\n\nChristopher Bowen as Charles Shepherd\n\nCarol Royle as Mrs Bright\n\nAnton Lesser as Chief Superintendent Reginald Bright\n\nRichard Riddell as DS Alan Jago\n\nSimon Harrison as DCI Ronnie Box\n\nTilly Blackwood as Judith Neal\n\nCaroline O’Neill as Win Thursday\n\nSophie Stanton as Letty Clamp\n\nOlivia Chenery as Isla Fairford"
