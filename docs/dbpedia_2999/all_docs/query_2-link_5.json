This is useful for searching for comparable examples for contexts, other works by the same architect, places related to specific individuals or themes, etc.\n\nThe HPO has posted PDFs of nominations of the state's over 3,000 National Register listings (not including archaeological listings). Nomination PDFs for listings made since 2006 are created from digital nomination files and include color digital photographs. PDFs of nominations prior to 2006 are made from scans of paper photocopies of nominations and include a black and white photographs at the end of the document. The photograph shows the property as it appeared at the time of the nomination. Many have been rehabilitated since the property or district was listed.\n\nAll are searchable insofar as possible, though some PDFs made from scans of older and faded photocopies may not be fully searchable.\n\nAdditionally, users may wish to search the table of listed National Register properties on the National Park Service website, where the official and approved nominations can be downloaded. Most of these nominations contain correspondence, maps, and many photographs, which can result in much larger file sizes and slower downloads.\n\nListings are alphabetical by county, showing town or vicinity, the Survey Site Number of the property or district, and the date listed in the National Register. Click on the entry to open the National Register nomination. Click on \"Map\" to open HPOWEB, the HPO's online map service, to the location of the property or district."
