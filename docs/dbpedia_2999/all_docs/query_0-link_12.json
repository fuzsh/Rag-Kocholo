None knew her but to love her. She had just arose from her knees in prayer when she called to appear before her God. How sweet the thought to fall asleep in Jesus. She was too pure for earth. Sorrowing loved ones who mourn, Dry your tears do not weep, Remember this sweet consolation, She is not dead but asleep, That her spirit hovers over you, Watching you with holy love, In the breezes hear her whisper, I am waiting you above. She has joined the gospel chorus, Far, far away from sorrows rod, Standing by the beautiful river, That flows by the throne of God, In the land of peace and glory, By the Redeemer loved and blessed, Where the wicked cease from troubling, And the weary are at rest.

K. Fleming on Nutbush on the North Carolina line which resulted in the drowning of Mr. Fleming and his miller, Mr. Lynch. It seems that the freshet had carried away the bridge, and these gentlemen attempted to cross the stream Nutbush creek in a small canoe; soon after starting the canoe, creened- (?-) somewhat build Mr. Lynch, who could not swim immediately seized Mr. Fleming from behind, pinning the latters arms to his body, the movement upset the boat and both were thrown into the water. Mr. Fleming begged his frightened companion to let him go, but rendered ranted by fear held to Mr. Fleming with super human grasp .\n\nMr. Fleming was an excellent swimmer, tried in vain to free himself from the drowning man, but all his efforts were unavailing and served to exhaust the strength of both, and in a few moments both were down to rise no more. On Sunday morning the creek was dragged and the bodies of the two unfortunately men were found no more than twenty feet from where the canoe was overturned; the body of Mr. Fleming being clasped in the arms of Mr. Lynch, death not having the power to relax the grasp. The terror stricken man had taken upon the other while the boat commended to capsize. The death of these two gentlemen has cast a gloom of the entire community in which they lived, and is a source of universal regret , as they were both men of high character and esteemed by all who knew them.\n\nOxford Public Ledger\n\nThursday, November 3, 1898\n\nDeath of Mrs. Thos.

Her Christian life was spent in the Baptist church, and a zealous, energetic worker in spreading the gospel. She was the daughter of Mr. John Y. McGhee and brother of Capt. Capt.

She was modest and quiet to an unusual degree, on account of disease, but she was a woman of high culture, well educated and possessed many advantages in her early days of which she made no display, but her friends receive more consolation that she was a pure Christian woman and died with full assurance of blissful eternity.\n\nOxford Public Ledger\n\nFriday, November 22, 1895\n\nWe are really sad to chronicle the death of our esteemed friend and neighbor, Mr. B. T. Tucker, who departed this life on 26th October at 7oclock p.m. The writer has known him for the last thirty years, and can truly say he was a man who endeared himself to all who knew him.\n\nAn honest, upright, truthful, sober man, his whole life was one uninterrupted course of duty and affection to his Church and family. He was sick for three months and bore his affliction with the fortitude of a Christian, yielding his breath in full peace of mind and convinced that he was leaving this earthly state for a better and a happier in another world, and when he found the hand of death upon him, his only regret was to think on the agonies which must rend the hearts of those dependent on him, for he was perfectly contented to leave the world as his conscience did not reproach him with his errors would be forgiven. Thus he resigned his precious soul into the hands of a merciful God. The death of such a man should occasion the deepest sorrow, yet at\n\nthe same time leaves us the most comfortable assurance that he is happier than our fondest wishes and care could have made him which must enable us to support the remainder of years which shall please God to allot for us here without murmuring or discontent and quicken our endeavors to prepare ourselves to follow to that happy place where our dear and valuable friend is gone before.\n\nOxford Public Ledger\n\nFriday, August 9, 1895\n\nDeaths afflicting Hand.\n\nTwo Loved Ones  Cross Over The River the Same Day.\n\nMrs. S. H. Smith, ( Nee Carrie White) died suddenly in Oxford on Wednesday morning the 7th instant, which was a great shock to our people. She had been well up to an hour before her death, and her family and friends had no premonition of the heart rendering shock.\n\nMrs. Smith was the daughter of Dr. D. C. White and sister of Dr. E. White and Mrs. R. W, Harris, of Wilton, and was in the prime of young womanhood, being only about 26 years of age. She was a devoted Methodist and loved her church. Her cheerful and sincere nature drew to her a large and appreciative circle of friends, and she was beloved by all. Warm hearted, affectionate and tender she knew how to feel for others troubles, and always gave that sympathy which brings comfort and consolation.\n\nLives like hers are the ones that spread sunshine and flowers along our pathways, and we can hardly understand why her taken away is for the best, yet tis he  Who doeth all things well who has called her to be with the saints in glory. Let us bow in humble submission to this chastening of our Fathers and look to Him for comfort.\n\nShe leaves a husband, little boy, father, brother and sister of her immediate household and a number of relatives to mourn her loss. Would that we could say some word to cheer and comfort the broken hearted and crushed husband and father. To them and to all of her relatives we extend our deepest sympathy and we trust they may be sustained and comforted in this great affliction.\n\nThe funeral services were conducted by Rev. J. B. Hurley in the Methodist church Thursday afternoon at 5:30 Oclock. The exercises were very impressive and the large concourse of sympathizing friends attested the high esteem in which Mrs. Smith was held in our community. The internment took place in the Elmwood Cemetery.\n\nBeyond The Smiling and The Weeping She is At Rest\n\nIt is with a saddened heart we are called upon to announce two deaths in Oxford the same day. Thursday afternoon the spirit of Mrs. Lizzie Osborn, the beloved wife of Edward H. Osborn passed upward into the Great beyond. She was the daughter, of Mr. and Mrs. R. F. Knott, so well known in this section. Mrs. Osborn was but 18 years old, and had been married but a year. She died from congestion of the brain after an illness of but 6 days. She leaves a girl infant six days old which is doing well. Her death is peculiarly distressing, coming as it does when she was just reaching womanhood, and causing her to leave a child that, should God spare its life, must travel the journey of this world without the guidance of a mothers tender hand. Then too she leaves a devoted husband whose life joy went out when her spirit passed beneath the shadows. Mrs. Osborn made friends of all who knew her by her exemplary character and many Christian virtues.\n\nShe had been for six years a devout member of the Baptist church, and her untimely death leaves a sad vacancy in her church as well as in two devoted families.\n\nWe extend to the bereaved family this our most sincere sympathy and trust that He who does nothing without a wise purpose, may give them strength to bear the heavy stroke.\n\nThe funeral was conduct by her pastor, Rev. J. S. Hardaway, from the Presbyterian Church on Thursday morning.\n\nThe exercises were expressive in the extreme. She was buried in the beautiful Elmwood Cemetery, where a large procession had followed.\n\nOxford Public Ledger\n\nFriday, February 19, 1892\n\nDeath of Dr. C. C.

He was buried in the family cemetery where repose the remains of several generations. The services were conducted by Rev. M. T. Turner, Rector St. James Parish, Kittrell, and were joined in by a vast concourse of sorrowing friends and neighbors.\n\nThe deceased was the youngest and last of three sons of the late Pleasant Peace, surviving but a few years his Brothers Dr. Pleasant Poindexter and William Leak, prominently known and deeply mourned throughout their native section, Dr. Peace with his older brother, Dr. P.P. Peace, having an extensive and lucrative, Though laborious, practice to which he devoted many years was thoroughly identified with a large community, By whom, on account of his kindness and skill, he was much beloved and most highly esteemed, and only on account of feeble health and the cares of a large business did he discontinue the practice of his profession,\n\nwhich was a source of great regret with his many patrons. He was eminently successful in his treatment of diseases, charitable to the needy, kind to his neighbors and courteous to all, and very soul of honor.\n\nAlthough the subject of this notice was not in any church communion, he became much concerned and\n\nexpressed an earnest desire for baptism and confirmation, and was observed in his last illness to be often engaged in prayer. Of his immediate family he left but one aged sister, whose watchfulness and care was scarcely less than that of a mother, whose devotion we rarely, if over, see equaled, and whose grief is distressing to witness. In the midst of her loneliness and sorrow we can but in deepest sympathy say,--{Prayer-hard to Read}\n\nOxford Public Ledger\n\nFriday, February 12, 1892\n\nDeath of John Pleasant\n\nWe publish with much regret the account of the death of the above named gentlemen on Saturday morning, February 6th, who was well and favorably known in this community.

After the war he settled on the farm, and with the disadvantage of one leg he began a new battle of life, and by strong resolution and great perseverance he made a splendid success. Mr. OBriant was a sincere Christian having made a profession of religion early in life, uniting with the Baptist church, having been for the greater portion of his life one of the foremost workers of Mt.

Allen, son of W. T. Allen, Esq., to his home above after a long and lingering disease which borne with patience and Christian fortitude. He was always a delicate boy, but God in his wisdom saw fit to let him live with his loved ones 21 years and 3 days.\n\nThe summons came not as the midnight cry to the  foolish virgin for in the morning of life the preparation was made to meet his God in peace. He was a member of the Presbyterian Church.\n\nWith all the tender and loving care from father, sister, and friends as well as medical skill did not inspire him with hope of recovery. Through many weary weeks his suffering were borne with a degree of patience and resignation that was pleasant to witness. Graces vouchsafed to those who shall be heirs of the kingdom. Father and sisters though the pet of the household is gone and you miss him at God knows best. Think of him now, not the mortal part that rest in the narrow house, but think of him as an angel of lightas the redeemed of the Lordwhere there is no more death, neither sorrowing not crying in the house of many Mansions. The city that hath no need of the sun, neither the moon to shine in it, for the glory of God doth heighten it. Mourn not, that is not lost but gone on before to join his mother, sister and brother.\n\nA precious one from us has gone, A voice we loved is still; A place is vacant in our home, Which never can be filled. God in his wisdom has recalled, The boon His love has given, And though the body slumbers, here, The soul is safe in heaven. --------F.\n\nOxford Public Ledger\n\nFriday, September 7, 1894\n\nDeath of Mrs. Jefferys.\n\nWe deeply regret to chronicle the death of Mrs. W.

Faucettes Noble Career Ended.\n\nIt is our painful duty to announce to the world the death of this venerable minister of the gospel who in early life for many years was the beloved pastor of the Oxford Presbyterian church which prospered under his ministration and during his pastorate he made many friends. During a large part of his life he served faithfully and well other churches in the State. After a long absence from Oxford, a few years ago he returned to this place among the dear friends of former years, with the view of opening a female school in which his wife was to be the chief instructress, as the infirmities of age were making some impress on his physical condition, having passed his three score years and ten. He however heard some of the important classes of the school room with the zeal and energy of his younger days, for be if known he was not without experience as a teacher. He was well educated and knew well how to impart instruction in the school room well as in the pulpit. The cause of death of Mr. Faucette was attributable to an attack of paralysis, which was principally at first on one side. This at the outset did not destroy his consciousness or his ability to converse with his family and friends. His thoughts and conversation however were much of a religious bearing, and he was evidently prepared for whatever his Lord and master might have in store for him as his faith was simple and strong in Jesus, from he had faithfully served from early part life until he passed beyond free score years and ten. His children were at his beside in the sueme moment when his spirit left his body. His pastor, Rev. J. E. Thacker, between whom and himself was great brotherly love was sensitive to him during his brief illness. Mr. Faucette stood high with everybody who knew him for his --??_ and blameless life, and he had a large circle of friends and acquaintances . The funeral devices were conducted at the Presbyterian church Wednesday morning at 11 by Mr. Thacker, by whom appropriate remarks were made not. Only by him but also by Rev. R. I. Devin, a venerable Minister of the Baptist church, who had been a life long friend of the deceased, and also by Rev. J. B.

Hester never married and he and his brother carried on a farm conjointly for many years using everything in common and participating equally in the privileges of the plantation without disagreement or discord. Both of them were gentlemen of gentle, pleasant manners, and great kindness of nature. They lived in peace with the world, were kind neighbors, both of them being greatly esteemed by their acquaintances. The tie that bound together in life was so strong and tender that in writing of the one the character of both naturally arisen before imagination.\n\nMr. F. B. Hester has lived considerably beyond the period usually allowed to mortals, though for the past several years his health has been feeble, and for some time before his demise it was manifest to his friends the ravage of time was gradually but surely doing its work. He was a strict member of the Baptist church on whose service he attended until the infirmities of age rendered it impracticable for him to do so. His life was quiet and blameless. His friendships were sincere and faithful. His faith in Christ was strong and his work was Godly. In his death another valuable link that binds this generation to the past broken.

Reid.\n\nOn Tuesday evening, the 17th, Kittrell was shocked by a telegram announcing the death of Mr. John Henry Reid at Los Angeles, Cal. Mr. Reid was a son of the late Mr. Jas. C. Reid. Mr. Reid had for several years lived in the Western Carolina Railroad as agent at Round Knob, Lenoir and Morganton. He was a first class operator and a favorite of the railroad men.\n\nOwing such close confinement his health gave away. The doctors at Morganton advised him to take a trip to California as they thought that climate would improve his health. The railroad men also thought the change might be beneficial and obtained passes for him to Los Angeles, Cal. Where he spent his last days with his cousin Mr. Arthur Reid. Mr. Reid went to Los Angeles the latter part of the past summer and was to remain there until after the Christmas holidays and if his health improved and he should decide to stay his family was to go to him. He had several good jobs offered him while there and had accepted one and was to commence work in a few days. On Friday, the 3rd instant, he was returning from a trip out on the city and was taken with a severe hemorrhage and lost lots of blood which weakened him very much. He had the best of medical attention, but on the following Tuesday a second hemorrhage resulted in his death.\n\nOn May 10th, 1893 he was happily married to Miss Annie Persnal, of Morganton, NC. And was a devoted husband, a loving son, and a brother and a strict faithful member of the Presbyterian church. The latter half of his life he spent in trying to serve his Lord and master. He was naturally a good boya model young manin his thirtieth year. He always wore a bright smile and had a plesant word for everybody. He made many friends wherever he went. God saw in his wise providence best to take him from us without an extended spell of sickness. He was a victim of that dread malady , lung disease. Little did we think when we saw him last in Kittrell spending a few days with his mother, Mrs. R. M. Reid, before his departure to California that we would be called upon so soon to chronicle his death. His remains were embalmed and expressed to Morganton. Mr. Reid leaves a wife, mother, four sisters, and three brothers to mourn his loss.\n\nThe people of Kittrell with the many friends of John greatly sympathize with the bereaved ones in the loss of such a noble character, yet we submit as we know and feel that God doeth all things well. God had a higher, a grander, a nobler work for this man than he could ever have accomplished on this earth and may the bereaved relatives and friends press forward to the mark of the high calling which is in Christ Jesus, and may they strive to meet him who has gone before to await and welcome their coming to that eternal home where there is no parting. -----\n\nOxford Public Ledger\n\nFriday, November 10, 1905\n\nGathered to Rest.\n\nMrs. Flora Wheeler, the loved and loving wife of John H.

Brooks, was gathered to rest on Sunday morning last at 1 oclock. He was been declining in health for some months, and his death was not unexpected. He was exceedingly intelligent for his age, and consequently made many friends among the children as well as the grown people. Charley was a favorite with the editor and naturally our warmest, heartfelt sympathies go out to the afflicted family in their great bereavement. The interment took place Sunday afternoon and Charley sweetly sleeps in Elmwood cemetery until the resurrection morn.  As the sweet flower that scents the morn, but withers with his dawn, So swiftly sped his life away. He died to sin, he died to cares, But for a moment felt the rod. O Mourner, such the Lord declares Such are the children of our God.\n\nOxford Public Ledger\n\nFriday, January 19, 1894\n\nDeath Of Mrs. Charity Hester.\n\nA writer in the Orphans Friend in speaking of this good lady says:\n\nMrs. Charity Hester, widow of the late Rev. B. B. Hester, of Granville county, NC, after a long and eminently useful life, died December 3, 1893, at her home where she lived fifty-eight years . She was born September 12th 1813, so she lived to the ripe old age of eighty years, two months and twenty-one days. She was married to B. B. Hester November 11, 1829, and they lived happily together for more than 62 years. Thirteen children were born unto them of whom ten are still living. She professed faith on Christ when quite young, but doubts disturbed her until a gracious revival at Banks Chapel occurred even after marriage where she and her husband sought and found the assurance of forgiveness and acceptance. From that glad hour she was a happy and devoted Christian.\n\nOxford Public Ledger\n\nFriday, April 1, 1910\n\nMr. C. A.

Hunt On Thursday Night at 12 oclock\n\nAbout this hour, on the night of May 24th, 1894, this excellent young man breathed his last at the home of his father, John W. Hunt in Oxford, NC.\n\nRobert Hunt was born October 25, 1869, and therefore was nearly 25 years of age. He was converted at the early age of twelve years. The circumstances of his conversion were these: While he was at home in his room up stairs, he heard his mother singing shall we gather at the River where bright angel feet have trod. He was so moved upon by the Spirit of God under singing the hymn that he came downstairs , threw himself into his mothers lap, confessed his sins and his trust in the Savior, and ever afterward looked back upon that time as the hour of his conversion.\n\nThat he was a converted soul no one that knew him would ever question, for unto the day of his death his life was a beautiful example of how a Christian ought to live.\n\nHe was baptized into the fellowship of the Oxford Baptist Church, Nov. 10th, 1883, in the 14th year of his age, and his membership continued in the Oxford Baptist church till his death.\n\nHis character was of the highest excellence. Modest as a woman and singularly pure; absolutely free from bad habits; ambitious to cultivate and improve himself; generous, kind and amiable, trustful, and honorable; patient and cheerful. He seems to me, and I knew him well, to be, take him all in all, one of the noblest and highest specimens of young manhood it has ever been my good fortune to meet in life. These may sound like words exaggerated praise, but they are the words of sober truth, and were I called on to name a young man to commend as an example to young men I know no one whose character I could more fully commend than that of Robert J. Hunt.\n\nFor several years he had been suffering with consumption. During all these years his cheerfulness, patience and resignation to Gods will were manifest to all who knew him well. Only a fortnight before his death, when he was going about and was even hopeful of recovery, to a neighbor who asked him if he was afraid to die, he replied, Not at all, I regard death as a simply a duty we must all perform.\n\nNot long before his end his father asked him: son, are you willing to die? He answered:\n\nPerfectly willing if the Bible is true. He then proceeded to bequeath his books, etc., to different members of the family; bade them not to grieve at his departure, and in a short time after he fell asleep.-----------J. S. Hardaway\n\nOxford Public Ledger\n\nFriday, June 15, 1894\n\nDeath of Eugene Clay.\n\nOn May 13, 1894, death visited the family of Mr. and Mrs. J. L. Clay and took from them their youngest child, little Eugene, aged 1 year and 8 months. He has gone to live with Jesus, waiting at Heavens gate for his father and mother.\n\n he is not dead; but asleep in Jesus, To rise upon some fairer shore, and bright in Heavens jeweled crown, He will shine forever more. There is an angel form Walks oer the earth in silent tread. He bears our best loved ones away And then we call them dead. And when he sees a smile too bright, Or heart too pure for taint and vice, He bears it to the world of light , To dwell in Paradise.\n\nOxford Public Ledger\n\nFriday, October 20, 1905\n\nDeath of Miss Etta Cash\n\nMiss Etta, daughter of S.

His death was triumphant. He went rejoicing home to heaven. He is happy with Jesus, and loved ones on the other shore. May his loved ones left here, meet him there.J. A.
