        "text": "1860 U. S. Federal Census - Slave Schedule\n\nGranville County, NC\n\nIntroduction\n\nDuring the 1850 and 1860 federal population census years separate listings were taken of slaves. For the most part, these lists did not include their names but did include their sex, age, and color. They were listed under the slaveholder’s name. Although some enumerators appeared to make an effort to list the slaves in family groups, most did not do so. The more usual procedure was to list them in order from the oldest to the youngest. Without names it is difficult to gather conclusive evidence that a specific slave was in the household of a particular slaveholder, but the schedule does give support for a hypothesis for such when it considers family history and the data found in the regular 1870 federal population census.\n\nBarnetta McGhee White, Ph.

Only a few of the present Townships kept the names of the old Districts. Some districts in the southern part of the county overlap in reporting the locations of slaveowners. A brief description of these 1860 Districts can be found in The North Carolina Gazeteer, a Dictionary of Tar Heel Places, by William S.
