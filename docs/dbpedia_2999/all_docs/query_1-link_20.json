We would like to emphasize what this book is not as well as what it is. We emphatically state that it is not a history of Northampton County and is in no way intended to take the place of one. It has been called a, “glorified scrap book”.\n\nEach member of the Northampton County Bicentennial Committee has worked hard collecting information from his or her part of the county. We have pleaded for information from our citizens and we hope that you contacted your representative.\n\nWe are keenly aware that people, places, and things have been left out and for this we are sorry, but at the same time we know it is impossible to cover everything. Everyone will not be pleased, but we feel a duty to try to produce a publication that will in a small way increase our awareness of our county's rich heritage. Though it be both negative and positive we feel we will accomplish something even if we call to the attention of our citizens just how much history remains to be written. Therefore, we solicit your understanding.\n\nJust as we have found mistakes and contradictions by early historians of our area, we also know they will plague us. So, in essence, forgive out human frailties and know that all who have contributed to this book have done it for their love of Northampton County, remembering, “where we go depends upon where we have been”.\n\nE. Carl Witt. Chairman\n\nNorthampton County\n\nBicentennial Committee\n\nHistoric Concord Church\n\nNow Thank We All Our God\n\nGod of our Fathers, known of old, we thank you for those intrepid souls who loved freedom to worship and the right to govern themselves more than their native land. Even as Abraham left his homeland and sought a “better place” so did our forebears come to America seeking a better place. Thank you for leading them to America, protecting them amidst all the vicissitudes of this wildnerness land and for the new nation they wrought out under the leadership of God.\n\nForgive us for our sometime — neglect and betrayal of our inheritance. We pray that you, our merciful and loving Heavenly Father, will heal our feverish ways, keep our star still shining and the dream of a better place in our hearts. May there be a renewal of faith in the destiny and purpose of these United States of America.\n\nDr. and Mrs. R.

Grant\n\nGeneral Histories and Listings\n\n“The Essential Northampton”-\n\nA Portrait Drawn in Affection\n\nWho lives in Northampton? What kind of people are they? In the summer of 1947 these questions came winging across the Atlantic from a news reporter of the London Times.\n\nWith love and affection, our own Bernice Kelly Harris, a resident of Seaboard and a writer of distinction, wrote an answer to these questions which was carried in full in the July 27, 1974 News and Observer and reads as follows:\n\n“ ‘The Essential Northampton’ — A Portrait Drawn In Affection”\n\nWhile the attitudes, modes, and conventions of Northampton do not differ from those of in general, a sense of older cultures, of the grace and revel of other days, of land passing from heir to heir does seem to linger distinctively, giving flavor and piquancy to this section of state. The names of antebellum plantations, of old taverns and race horses, of the hunt, and of primitive peoples are as integral a part of local nomenclature as are Jackson and Rich Square and other little towns spaced through the county every few miles. Added to the more romantic labels, there are Urahaw, Wiccacanee, Potecasi, Occoneechee, and Meherrin, suggestive of wigwam days; Cutawhiskie. Bear Creek, Hunting Branch, Wildcat Swamp, Edwards’ Pocoson, Beaverpond, Paddy's Delight Creek, Panther Swamp, Pin Hook, and Shell Landing, reminiscent of pioneer days when the hunt was subsistence as well as recreation.\n\nFamilies Stick Here\n\nThe plantation idea which still seems to linger in the cultivation of the rich Northampton acres survives the plantation system and an older culture that is not otherwise entirely without material evidence, impressive if not provocative of extensive Old Homes and Garden Tours. While there is left only the site of Mount Gallant, plantation home of one of Northampton's illustrous sons, with its slabs of English stone marking the resting places of their noted family, such tours would show homes considerably over a hundred years in which consecutive heirs have lived and are still living, family burying grounds on land still in the possession of great-great-grandchildren, site of holdings that have run to three thousand acres, and colored tenants still on land that was cultivated by their great-grand fathers under the slave system.\n\nPlantations first developed along the Roanoke and Meherrin Rivers and near their tributaries which served early planters as highways by which they could travel as well as receive cargoes of slaves brought directly from . Local historians state that the river Negroes, living in what is familiarly known as “The Neck,” until comparatively recently remained somewhat distinctive in character, preserving their own tribal lore and picturesque dialect. For instance, coming from a part of where salt was unavailable, they were some generations acquiring a taste for the standard fare of fatback and corned herrings. These early settlers of Northampton, formed as a county from Bertie in 1741 and named for the Earl of Northampton, were principally Scotch and Scotch-Irish from the , and later from colonial provinces to the north came French, English, Scotch, and Scotch-Irish. Their descendants are the white population of the county today.\n\nHowever changed the distinctive manorial pattern, Garibaldi and Maretoc and Thornbury and Alvesta, Bull Hill, Mowfield, Big Gees and Little Gees, Odum Farm, Rogers Quarter, The Meadows, The Level, Over-the-Road Farm, among others, are still yielding cotton and corn under those names and are as glib to the tongue of colored sharecroppers as are Conway, Woodland or Seaboard.\n\nVerona, home of General Ransom, is still in the possession of his family. Longview; home of Willie Jones Long — named for his nationally famous great-great-grandfather, Willie Jones — is a beautiful example of plantation continuity. In it are living the fifth generation, and on the land descendants of slaves have lived consecutively, with slaves’ great-great-grandchildren still calling the Longview plantation home.\n\nHer People ‘Belong.’\n\nWarren Place, rebuilt on the site of a plantation house more than a hundred years old and named for one of the early Northampton sheriffs, is the home of Gilbert T. Stephenson, whose great-great-great-grandfather came back from the Revolutionary War to this neighborhood — now called Pendleton — and whose great-great-grandfathers are buried on land still in possession of heirs. The Meherrin River road, from Margarettsville to Severn, is bordered at intervals with old houses that were once manors with slave quarters. The Nancy House, unoccupied but still owned by heirs, faces towards the river rather than the highway. The Jordan Edwards place and Rogers Farm are among other old houses still used by the family. These random examples of continuity and permanence, giving to Northampton people the feeling of “belongingness” can be duplicated over the county.\n\nMany old plantations, such as Branch's and Deberry's, and old plantation houses have passed into other hands or alien occupation. There is the Cotton house, built on Sutton Ridge, grant of land from the Earl of Sutherland; formerly distinguished by hand carvings and brass locks and a secret stair. It is now a shell, housing tenants. There is the Boone home, owned by heirs but unoccupied, closed and shuttered in embalmed stillness and dignity, preserving almost intact the furnishing and way of living of other generations.\n\nThe Pace Changes.\n\nLikewise, Faison's Old Tavern, according to local historians the lively scene in other days of much reveling, of cock fights and English pub conviviality, now operates prosaically as a filling station. Silver Hill, originally a famous race course to which horses were brought from points as far away as Long Island, is now tilled land on which nothing more dare-devil than farm mules plod.\n\nThe Burgwyn family is only one exponent of the other culture, landed still if more nearly urban now in point of residence, inheriting several large plantations along the Roanoke River from their uncle, George Pollock, The Burgwyns came to Northampton from Craven County in 1840. Henry King Burgwyn designed the courthouse for the county, erected around 1850, and other members of his\n\nfamily have a distinguished record of service to county and State. Harry King Burgwyn of the 26th Regiment at Gettysburg was the youngest colonel to be killed in action, being only 21. Others have established banks, served as county treasurer, clerk of Superior Court, Representative and Senator in the General Assembly. W. H. S. Burgwyn, formerly legislator, has been judge of Superior Court for the past ten years.\n\nNorthampton is not without representation in state and national affairs. Thomas Bragg was Governor of and Attorney-General in Davis’ cabinet; his residence stands in quiet dignity not far from the courthouse square. Matt Ransom, General and Senator, was the first Ambassador to , a post, the General confided to county acquaintances, created by Cleveland especially to favor him — with the better salary involved in the higher rank. Political creation or not, diplomacy obviously suited the General. A legend has grown up in this locale around his hospitality, his diplomatic dealing with tax collector or importunate creditor. One sheriff it is alleged, ran on the sole platform that he would collect the General's taxes if elected to office. Regardless of crass electioneering, the General's home, Verona, stands as a symbol of the charm and hospitality of ante-bellum days.\n\nLand Sires Lawyers.\n\nThe General's neighbor, Judge Mason, and E. C. Beddingfield were members of the State Railroad Commission, which antedated the present Utilities Commission and played an important part in the revolution that overturned the Republican regime.\n\nIn jurisprudence, the genius of Northampton seems to flower. Its citizens are inclined toward patronage of, rather than active participation in, the arts. A young portrait painter, Copeland, was gaining considerable reputation when he died. There has been a sprinkling of writers, journalists, local historians like the scholarly P. J. Long, formerly superintendent of education for a quarter century. But the judges — Mason, Barnes, Midyette, Peebles, Burgwyn — all the lawyers reflect the basic predilection of Northampton in respect to public life. The Northampton Players, a significant organization of adults from various parts of the county dedicated to the writing and production of one-act plays, were giving an impetus to one phase of cultural development when gas rationing interrupted and the drafting of players to other theaters of action. Currently, under the aegis of the Gilbert Stephensons who commute to Warren Place from Wilmington, Delaware, there is an embryonic plan to effect an organization forwhatever artists and patrons of art there are in this area, with cultural objectives.\n\nA county library serves every section of Northampton; agriculture, home economics, health and welfare departments function under most efficient administrations. Consolidation has effected a good system of elementary and high schools for white and colored, with improvement in the literacy rate evident. Little headway has been made against adult illiteracy, though classes have been held intermittently toward that end.\n\nThe sense of continuity and of goodly heritage is emphasized in the religious background. The map of Northampton is dotted every few miles with churches and chapels, some of them old. St. Luke's and Potecasi and Cedar Grove Meeting House are among the older churches, along with Concord, established in 1795, and Pinner's and Sharon early in the last century. Baptist, Episcopal, Friends, and Methodist churches serve the county, white and colored, from Hebron in the extreme east to Roanoke Chapel in Occaoneechee Neck; and associations and yearly meetings and conferences cement the fellowships of a churched and religious people.\n\nThe essential Northampton is not backgrounds and older cultures and well-known names alone, not altogether the college trained women and men that make up an impressive percentage of the citizenry; it is also the stout-hearted men and women who from some stubborn clearing or new ground made homes and a good life for their families without benefit of plantation slaves, those simple happy people who could stand at their gates and see every foot of land they owned, who loved land not too much to make footpaths across their fields to neighbors’ houses, whose land sense provoked no feuds over boundary or line trees.\n\nNorthampton Is Broad.\n\nThe essential Northampton is that colored man and woman of Jonesboro who made their bodies veritable steam engines doing public work and standing knee-deep in mud from sun to sun molding brick by hand, in order that they might acquire land passing from heir to heir; it is that indomitable old woman from Conwell's Mill who peddled broomstraw and blackberries from door to door over the miles rather than go on relief; it is the harrowingly deformed man of Galatia who helped support his family with the sales of his quaint little baskets, made with his own afflicted hands, and who sang what he called a ‘mean bass,’ withal; or the man down Bynum Road who spent his life keeping peace, gratis, in preference to making peace profitably after it was broken.\n\nIt is that 12 good-men-and-true who, shocked and angered and enraged over one of the most horrible crimes ever committed in Northampton or anywhere, because of the circumstantial element in the court evidence, returned on June 27, 1947 a verdict of first degree burglary with a recommendation for mercy for the colored criminal.\n\nRespects Human Dignity.\n\nIt is the undaunted old matriarch who at 73 joined an adult illiteracy class that she might learn to read her Bible and sign checks; that gaunt aging share-cropper at Lassiter's Fork still no nearer his dream of owning a farm, but continuing to make his current home a haven for homeless children of family connections and “some sort of how” to provide a living through depressions and panics for his family circle of 20-odd, not one of whom he would “shed” himself of; that kindly country doctor trading pills for plow beams the years his patients have more plows than money. It is that cornfield philosopher who, when challenged by a city resident with, “I bet I could lose you on the streets of Norfolk,” retorted: “I bet I could lose you in Fountain Creek, too!” It is those tired harvesters trudging along Drake's Crossroads, of nights toward fireside fellowships with neighbors, a brightness of their own creating, a triumph of human spirit over bleak horizons of circumstance.\n\nThe essential Northampton is, indeed, the spirit of the people who, not uncompromisingly heroic in equivocal situations, yet become veterans and casualties of\n\nCorregidor and Gaudalcanal and Normandy beaches and Iwo Jima.\n\nEssentially, Northampton takes pride in the record of its good and self-respecting colored people, in men like the late W. S. Creecy, for many years head of Creecy Institute at Rich Square and a sound and wholesome influence in his section; like Ernest Sugg who for 20 years has taught in the three-teacher school near Jackson and built toward a better community; like workers in the Willis Hare High School in Kirby township which has reports of excellent work: like J. N. Gill, under whose long administration Coates school in Seaboard grew into a four year high school, with agriculture and home economics departments.\n\nRecord Brings Pride.\n\nThere is pride, too, in the creditable record of race relationships through the years and in the jealous concern on the part of leading citizens for the fair treatment of colored people. There is a common saying in Northampton that the colored man stands a better chance in law than the white man. The facts, according to an outstanding lawyer in Jackson, seem to bear this out. It is his opinion that if the evidence in a case weighs about equally, a jury in this county will nine times out of ten tip the scales in favor of the Negro.\n\nThe protective instinct and indulgence have on occasions risen beyond any brotherhood thesis and become down-to-earth practice. In adversity and in danger these have asserted themselves in behalf of the colored man. White men have rushed into danger, risking their lives during emergencies — notably to rescue tenants from flooded lowlands during river freshets — and they have responded to exigency otherwise when the response involved great burden. They have helped him build his churches and chapels and schools, provided clinics and hospitalization, cheered his achievements. In the same spirit and in the limit of his ability the colored man has reciprocated.\n\nEssentially a Farmer.\n\nThe deep sense of land motivates Northampton. Northampton is a farmer. Of the 125,000 acres in cultivation, from an approximate total of 325,000 acres of farm and woodland, an average of 45,000 acres is planted in peanuts, 20,000 in cotton, 30,000 in corn — the three principle crops — while tobacco trails with 660 acres. The average cotton production is 450 lint pounds per acre and peanuts 1,200 pounds per acre. The diversification that was in evidence during the plantation system of farming collapsed after the War Between the States as a result of the demoralization of labor and depletion of capital. During the period of adjustment, crops which required the least labor and could be most readily converted into cash had to be grown, and cotton was king. The commercial production of peanuts began during the last two decades of the nineteenth century, and today Northampton ranks first among all other counties in the State in peanut production and seventeenth in the nation.\n\nThe rich lowgrounds of the Roanoke and Meherrin Rivers, the well drained terraces, the fertile uplands and new grounds, the fine sandy loams and silty clays all present at harvest time a picture of pastoral and sylvan plenty that is idyllic. The agrarian idea is not gentle of idyllic in Northampton, however, but more nearly Big Business, highly specialized and scientific. The peanut shocks, shading from lacy green at digging time to weathered brown at threshing, may emboss slope and lowground in picturesque polk-dot design, or like fat old ladies standing comfortable and ungirdled and fulfilled. But they are so because soils have been analyzed and the Norfolk fine sandy loams and Marlboro and Wickham and Altavista and Congaree silty clays adapted to right uses, because commercial fertilizers have been poured down, an average of 18 to 20 tons a farm per year; because winter legumes, rye and crimson clover and vetch and lespedeza have been used to the millions of pounds crops rotated; because they are money, five million dollars annually.\n\nLand Is Fertile.\n\nLikewise, cotton, lapping luxuriantly in the rows in August and fruiting toward white field and a million miniature Santa Claus beards, is investment, not eclogue, bringing in approximately two million dollars a year. Livestock and cattle breeds are being developed, notably on Holoman Farms and Tall Pines Plantation, with outstanding dairying at Longview; commercial turkey raising, a model being Rogers Farm near Severn, and poultry flocks and hatcheries add to the cash income, the total of which for all farm products is eight million dollars annually. While values are only approximately fifty per cent on the tax book, Northampton is rated as an eleven million dollar county.\n\nFarmer means investor, without bucolic connotation, necessarily; and farming is a corporation with highly specialized idiom and as intricate ramifications as a metropolitan syndicate. A sharecropper might easily daze a cosmopolite with his articulation of the idiom. It might well occasion no surprise, indeed, for the insignificant looking fellow at the hammermill to be heard referring to the theory of relativity or extrasensory perception; or the shirt-sleeved man at the disk harrow recalling that Carlyle's “French Revolution” and Millay's “Conversation at Midnight” were reproduced from ashes; or the fat farmer on the tractor opining on ideologies and theses of government. For graduates from Carolina and Duke and Guilford and State and Wake Forest come back to farm in Northampton — albeit from town homes, principally. They may be bankers, lawyers, legislators, doctors, merchants, druggists; but they are farmers, too, with as interesting assets, perhaps, from farms as from fees of office.\n\nSense of Continuity.\n\nThe sense of land is not all related to the business of dollars. Heritage is inherent, the idea of land transmitted from ancestors and transmissable to heirs. While Northampton seems to be a county of large farms and big landowners, actually 33 per cent of the farms are less than 50 acres, and only 16 per cent more than 100. The pattern even among the comparatively big landowners is no longer vicinal and compact, but bordered by various ownerships that keep the surveyor straightening out boundaries. Land is where they can buy it, and buy it they do big prices against competitive bidding. But the background is continuity, land passing from heir to heir.\n\nThe social design is conventional, though rockfish muddles, perhaps squirrel muddles too, seem to be a sectional basis for gatherings that are just picnics elsewhere. Peanut threshings are often the occasion for bucolic, old-fashioned feeds, of the layin-by of crops for big brunswick stews and barbecues; in the winter, hog-killings are\n\nfestivals of neighborliness, in town and county, with platters of “fresh” making the rounds like May baskets. Connoisseurs rate Northampton hams, cured by family or neighborhood recipes, quite as high as those with more famous labels. Deer hunts through the creeks and swamps of Northampton, fishing in the mill, bird hunting in woods and fields are seasonal diversion. Teas, bridge, luncheons, dinner parties, log cabin suppers are as likely to be county as neighborhood in scope, so close and so neighborly are inter-town contacts.\n\nIt is a good county, this Northampton.\n\nNorthampton History\n\nby Hazel Griffin\n\nDuring 1963 is celebrating the 300th anniversary of the granting of the Carolina Charter. Through the celebration the state is expressing its consciousness of its heritage, history, and culture. Several counties are participating in the anniversary event with programs, projects, and displays.\n\nNorthampton County too has its share of heritage even though much of its history is unrealized and certainly unwritten.\n\nThe county, 504 square miles, was formed in 1741 from Bertie County, which was formed in 1729 from the Albemarle precinct. Thus, Northampton as a part of old Albemarle, is among the earliest sections of the state to be settled. The county took its name from George, Earl of Northampton, a British nobleman, the brother of the Earl of Wilmington.\n\nThe two earliest deeds in Northampton were copied from the Bertie precinct records. Both concern land on the south side of the Meherrin River. Joseph Boon granted to Matthew Strickland a tract that was part of Thomas Boon's 1723 patent, and Matthew Strickland deeded to Joseph Strickland a tract granted to William Boon, Nov. 11, 1723.\n\nThe first deed recorded Nov. 21, 1741 after the formation of Northampton was by Rowland and Phillis Williams to Anthony Robinson, York County, Virginia, for land on the Roanoke River, the land being part of a land patent of William Brown,deceased, who sold the land to Williams.\n\nOther of the earliest land grants after the founding of the county were in 1742 to Thomas Wall and in 1744 to Richard Pace, John Smelly, and Robert Warren. Practically all of the land was patented during the 1740-1790 period. Only small tracts were patented after 1790.\n\nBefore 1741 however deeds indicate early owners of land. From the deed books the earliest mention of a land grant or patent in Northampton is that of Richard Braswell, 1706. Other early patents were held in 1712 by Thomas Howell; in 1718 by Phillip Jones of Surry County, Virginia; in 1719 by John Green, John Colson, Rebecca Braswell, Joseph Boon, Patrick Maule and Benjamin Williams; in 1720 by John Cheserby and John Farrow; in 1722 by Henry Baker and Edward Barnes; in 1723 by William Boon, Thomas Howell, John Lee, John Nelson, Richard Jarnagan and Richard Washington (of the George Washington family); and in 1725 by William Ricks and Robert Edwards.\n\nOther land owners before 1741 were family names of Kerbey, Baggett, Hart, Hayes, Joyner, Glover, Bridgers, Turner, Tyner, Parker, Wheeler, and many others.\n\nIn 1755, Northampton had a total of 1,736 taxables and 676 men serving in the militia.\n\nBy 1762 there were 2,280 persons named in the tax list, 1,109 being white and 1,171 black. Of these only about 235 paid taxes. John Edwards was county clerk at that time.\n\nNames of the 1762 list familiar in Northampton today were those of Barrett, Barrow, Boon, Bridgers, Carter, Ellis, Davis, Daughtrey, Deloach, Faison, Gay, Garris, Gee, Griffin, Harris, Hayes, Johnson, Lassiter, Lewis, Mecham, Parker, Parks, Revel, Rogers, Martin, Long, Sauls, Sikes, Taylor, Vaughan, Vinson and Wheeler.\n\nBy 1786, the population had increased greatly. The records of Eaton Haynes, clerk at that time, show a white male population of 2,346, white female 2,165, and blacks 3,709. With approximately 850 heads of households listed, the number of slaves averaged about four per family.\n\nThe largest slaveholder was Allen Jones, who in 1768 advertised in the Virginia Gazette 1450 acres of good tobacco land and 200 acres of low ground on the Roanoke River. Included in the sale were dwellings and orchards of 500 peach trees and 200 apple trees. The fruit was used in those days for brandy making.\n\nOther large slaveholders were William Clements with 53 slaves; Harwood Jones with 49; William Eaton who lived at Eaton's Ferry with 45; Priscilla Williams, 39; William Ruffin, 37; Mary Mason, 33; John Branch, 31; Henry Deberry, 30; Benjamin Edwards, 27; Jonas Wood, 26; James Wood, 25; and Joseph Wood, 24. Incidentally, it is believed that Woodland was named for the Wood family named in the list above.\n\nIn 1794, the court minutes show that Northampton had then 445,647 acres of land, 1,587 free poll and 4,164 black poll. Also in the county were 148 “wheels of pleasure”. Forty-six town lots were listed as taxable.\n\nThe first official census of the county was taken in 1790 by order of the newly formed national or federal government. The 1790 census showed Northampton's population to be 9,981. The latest census (1960) lists the population as 26,811, a not remarkable increase for 200 years. The original list of the county's 1762, 1786, and 1790 tax lists are in the Department of Archives, Raleigh.\n\nNorthampton is more fortunate than many counties in the matter of preserved records, yet it is one of the few counties in the state whose history has not been put into book form. In fact, scarcely nothing of its history or people has been told.\n\nIn 1974, the county had 339,986 acres of farm, woods, pasture land, with 296,223 acres in farm land, and 99,776 in cropland. In crops were peanuts 28,916 acres, cotton 26,446, soybeans 14,083 and smaller acreage in alfalfa, irish potatoes, and watermelons. Northampton leads all counties in the nation in peanut production. Turpentine and tar were vital commodities in the early days, followed by cotton. Timber sales have saved county farmers during depressions.\n\nCarl Goerch said, “Northampton is made up of agriculturist liberals.”\n\nThis article appeared in The News, Murfreesboro, N. C. March 28, 1963.\n\nPrehistoric\n\nNorthampton County\n\nLife in this area known as Northampton County had its beginning many centuries ago. The rich lands fed by her rivers and many streams were formed countless years before the peoples of Northampton were married to this land.\n\nTwo hundred million years ago our land was scraped by glaciers pushing their way down from the north. Evidences of this ancient invasion are found even today with large chunks of tumbled and worn petrified wood deposited in various sections of the county. Some of these pieces were brought here from as far north as the present state of .\n\nNorthampton also has her own native examples of petrified wood which exhibit the fact of her dense and lush forests centuries ago. Mr. Q. J. Stephenson of Garysburg, who for many years has unearthed this county's prehistory, has found twenty-five different types of petrified wood native to our county. Pine, hickory, and oak grew on our land thousands of years ago, even as today.\n\nA layer of blue mud lies over this age. Today streams have cut through the soil to expose this layer established before history. Within this layer, one can find numerous shells as evidence of the time when the ocean covered our land. The sea last covered this area thousands of years ago and its shore was just west of the present city of Weldon. Shark's teeth at Watson's Mill have been a curiosity for decades. Northampton's soil still reveals shells, coral, whale bones and other examples of this domination by the ocean. The animals of the sea swam over this area until the sea receeded leaving the land once again to the land animals.\n\nSeveral years ago, Mr. Q. J. Stephenson, while setting mink traps, discovered a “log” sticking out of a stream bank. This “log” as he later discovered was the four foot long leg bone of a mastadon. From this site of what is now called “Garysburg Mastadon,” Mr. Stephenson has recovered a number of bones and bone fragments including a kneecap, a tusk, and a tooth (with enamel still on it.)\n\nExactly when the first humans made their footprints in our land, is not certain. The rich soil and plant and animal life must have been attractive to those prehistoric wanderers. Indian relics are abundant in our county and extend man's existence here, back thousands of years. A significant find however, is that of an authenticated arrowhead of the Folsom period. This find could set man's existence in our county back a hundred centuries.\n\nIndians in\n\nNorthampton County\n\nEnglish settlers in Northampton County encountered Indians. They were an agricultural people, but also depended on hunting and fishing, according to the writing of E. Lawrence Lee, in Indian Wars in North Carolina, 1663-1763, a 1963 publication. These people had an organized way of life, living in villages and towns which varied in size from a few to as many as two hundred or more. Each had a chief or a head man as leader. The Indians had an uncomplicated life style before the coming of the whites, raising some grain, tobacco, vegetables and fruits with additional food provided by fishing and hunting. Surplus foods of all kinds were dried and stored in town storehouses for future use. They also depended on their surroundings to provide the materials for the tools which were fashioned from such things as stone and bones.\n\nMost of the history of these colorful people is unknown because they had no written language.\n\nThe Meherrin Indians were the predominant tribe in Northampton County.\n\nMeherrin Indians\n\nMeherrin Indians came from the Susquehanna area between and about 1675, according to Roy Johnson, Roanoke-Chowan News, July 20, 1958. They were called Susquehannas. They came to the old Saponnic Town on the Meherrin River near Lawrenceville, Virginia. Historian R. D. Connor says the town (referred to by Johnson as Saponnic) was called Christina (now sp. Christianna) and was the home of the Saponi Indians. Connor also identifies the Saponis with the Nottoway River in present Brunswick County. The river divides and . Colonel Byrd in his account of his surveying the state line refers to the Saponi Indian School at Christina. The school was fortified for protection against the savage Tuscaroras, but it was the Mohawk Indians who attacked the Saponis or the Meherrins in 1717, dispersing them. Some came into the Meherrin and Roanoke river areas of Northampton, only to be scattered by maurauding Catawba Indians about 1727. Some of the Meherrins settled on the Potecasi Creek, Urahaw and Cutawhiskie Swamps. Fragments of their civilization have been found on these waterways as well as on those in Hertford County, including Chapel Branch, near St. John's. In 1775, colonial records show 28 Indians still in Northampton. Many mulattoes in the Winton area of Hertford and the Woodland area of Northampton are of Meherrin blood. Around Woodland the Pierce family is reputed to be of Meherrin ancestry. The earliest Pierce settler worked on the Wiley Jacobs farm and stated he was “part Meherrin”.\n\nBelieve it or not!!!\n\nTHE PEOPLES PRESS\n\nSALEM, N. C.\n\nSEPTEMBER 29, 1871\n\nWonderful Discovery\n\nA Cave of Dead Indians Mammoth Remains\n\nThe following information is given by gentlemen of highest character and credit who have seen with their own eyes and touched and tested with their own hands the wonderful objects of which they make report.\n\nThe workmen engaged in opening a way for the projected railroad between Weldon and Garysburg struck Monday about one mile from the former place in a bank beside the river a catacomb of skeletons, supposed to be those of Indians of a remote age and a lost and forgotten race. The bodies exhumed were of strange and remarkable formation. The skulls were nearly an inch in thickness, the teeth were filed sharp, as are those of cannibals, the enamel perfectly\n\npreserved; the bones were of wonderful length and strength-the femur being as long as the leg of an ordinary man, the stature of the body being probably as great as eight or nine feet. Near their heads were sharp stone arrows, stone mortars in which their corn was brazed, and the bowls of pipes, apparently of soft friable soap-stone. The teeth of the skeletons are said to be as large as those of horses, one of them has been brought to this city, and presented to an officer of the Petersburg Railroad.\n\nThe bodies were found closely packed together, laid tier on tier as it seemed. There was no discernable ingress into or egress out of the mound. The mystery is who those giants were; to what race they belonged, to what era and how they came to be buried there. To these inquiries no answer has yet been made; and meantime the ruthless spade continues to cleave skull and body asunder, throwing up in mingled masses the bones of this heroic tribe. We hope some efforts will be made to preserve authentic and accurate accounts of these discoveries; and to throw some light, if possible, on the lost tribe whose bones have been thus rudely disturbed from their sleep in the earth's bosom.\n\nEarly Religion\n\nBefore church buildings were constructed, ministers traveled the countryside staying in private homes where they preached. Methodist Thomas Coker who visited in the county in 1785 wrote in his diary of Bridges-Creek church which belonged to the Church of England, saying it was in low country where there were an “astonishing number of frogs and a high mortality rate”. Of Roanoke-Chapel, eight miles from the line, Coker said the talk there was chiefly of slaves.\n\nBetween 1763 and 1775, Devereux Jarratt, an Anglican minister of and a forerunner of Methodism came into the county preaching a “peculiar doctrine in a peculiar manner, advocating remission of sins”, according to Guion Griffin Johnson in Ante-Bellum North Carolina. Jarratt said he came regularly into the county and his revivals awakened the people. By 1778, the Roanoke Methodist circuit was in existence. Two other itinerant Methodists who worked in the county were Phillip Cox and John Easter. In 1788, Bishop Asbury reported that he found the people in Northampton easy to preach to and wrote “I know that God and Christ dwell in the hearts of the people”. In 1770, an Episcopal missionary found “New Lights Baptists” increasing rapidly in the county.\n\nIn the early 1800's camp meetings became popular and remained so until the Civil War. In 1808 Elder Phillip Bruce advertised a camp meeting in the county and requested those not accustomed to good behavior not to attend. Rules were set up for good conduct. Carriages and wagons met river boats to take passengers inland to the camp meetings which lasted for several days.\n\nBetween 1760-1790, the first Methodist, Baptist, and Friends (Quakers) houses of worship were built in Northampton county. Early meetings of some of these groups were held in private homes and under brush arbors when an itenerant minister came into the area. The earliest church buildings were small, one-room weatherboarded structures. Some had dirt floors. The first Friends Meeting House was built in Rich Square in 1760. The first Methodist churches were Concord (near Seaboard) and Rehoboth (near Jackson) in 1798. The oldest continuously used church in the county is Concord. The first Baptist churches were Potecasi in 1775 and Elam (near Gaston) in 1788. The church revival in the 1700's coincided with that in adjoining counties and in . In the 1820's the Methodists experienced another revival, and in the 1840's both Baptists and Methodists had a spurt of growth. The last era of growth for these two denominations were in the 1880's and gain in the first decade of the 20th century. Although the Friends Society has had four meeting houses in the county, only the one at Woodland is now functioning. In the county the Baptists of the West Chowan Association have 18 churches, the Methodists 17, the Independent Baptists 1, the Episcopal 2. The white Baptists have a total membership of 4,121 and the white Methodists 3,171.\n\nThe Episcopal Church\n\nin\n\nNorthampton County\n\nThe history of the Anglican Church in Northampton dates from the establishment of Bertie's Northwest Parish in 1727. The earliest recorded services were conducted by Peter Fontaine, chaplain with the party that surveyed the - dividing line in 1728-29. Money for the erection of chapels was first raised in 1735-37.\n\nIn 1759 the portion of Northwest Parish that lay in Northampton was renamed St. George's, and that parish welcomed its first rector, William Fanning. By the time of the Revolution, St. George's had a substantial parish church (situated near present-day Mt. Carmel Baptist Church) and four active chapels: St. John's near Summerall's Fork, St. Paul's between Conway and Pendleton, and Bridger's Creek Chapel below Bryantown. The rector when the Revolution began was Charles Edward Taylor, and the vestrymen bore such names as Atherton, Edmunds, Gee, Wood, Figures, Bennett, Pace, Hough, Williamson, Thompson, and Smith. Taylor's loyalty to the American cause is attested by his service as chairman of Northampton County's Committee of Safety.\n\nAfter the Revolution services were held as long as clergymen were available, but the lack of a bishop and a general decline in religious sentiment brought an end to the Anglican organization in Northampton by 1800. Not until the 1830's and 1840's, some years after the Episcopal Diocese of North Carolina was formed, did signs of revival appear in the county. The bishops and neighboring clergymen made visits to the area and performed occasional services. In 1848, the Rev. William H. Harison was assigned missionary duty in the county, and soon a small church was erected in Jackson. When that building was consecrated as The Church of The Saviour by Bishop Levi S. Ives on May 4, 1851, the Rev. Frederick Fitzgerald took charge and led the new parish into union with the diocesan convention. Its first vestry was composed of Dr. William Barrow (senior warden), Thomas Bragg (later governor), Henry K. Burgwyn, John B. Bynum, Samuel Calvert (donor of the land on which the church was built), John\n\nRandolph, Thomas D. Sterling (who soon moved away and was replaced by David A. Barnes), and Edmund Wilkins (the only resident of the western part of the county). From 1859 through the Civil War the parish was served by Frederick Lightbourne, a native of who lived at Thornbury plantation where, in addition to his church work, he served as tutor to the children of Henry K. Burgwyn. Throughout the pre-Civil War period the parish was noted for its work with the black population, particularly those blacks who were the property of members of the congregation.\n\nLate in 1858, largely through the efforts of Edmund Wilkins, a mission was established in Gaston, where a small building was consecrated by Bishop Thomas Atkinson on May 7, 1859. In 1867 that building was moved from the dying town to a site adjoining the entrance to the Wilkins family's Belmont plantation.\n\nFrom 1877 until 1890 both Northampton congregations thrived under the Rev. Gilbert Higgs. The Jackson church was enlarged, and at Gaston a new building was erected and consecrated as St. Luke's on June 12, 1889. William T. Picard, a respected Jackson businessman, served first as lay reader under Higgs and later as perpetual deacon. Through his efforts, services were held for several years in Rich Square, Margaretsville, Seaboard, Garysburg, and Pleasant Hill, but no permanent congregations were assembled in those places.\n\nOn the night of September 29, 1895, the Jackson church was destroyed by fire, and the congregation was forced to hold services in its parochial school, where Miss Lucretia Whitfield taught for many years. Through the determined efforts of its members under the direction of William T. Picard, the Church of the Saviour was rebuilt in stone and ready for services by November 17, 1898. When the debt had been removed, it was consecrated by Bishop Joseph B. Cheshire, Jr. on June 19, 1904. At that time it was considered one of the best appointed churches in ; its windows, all installed at the time it was built, offer a remarkable display of stained glass of the period. The Peebles and Ransom windows are particularly impressive.\n\nIn the first quarter of the twentieth century both Northampton congregations suffered from the removal of many families and individuals who had been members. But in the late 1920's, under the Rev. Lewis N. Taylor at Gaston and the Rev. deSaussure P. Moore at Jackson, the work of the Episcopal Church in the county began a modest revival. Today the Rev. Robert M. Bird serves both congregations. Although their numbers have never been great, these churches have consistently furnished Northampton with responsible men and women for leadership in community affairs.\n\nBaptist Churches\n\nThe 18 white Baptist churches are a part of the West Chowan association formed in 1882, which was formerly a part of the Chowan association organized in 1806, which grew out of the Kehukee association organized in 1796, according to Dr. G. W. Paschal.\n\nOnly two churches date back to the 18th century, Potecasi (1775) and Elam, near Gaston, (1788). The Potecasi church was founded by the Rev. Lemuel Burkett, who organized Burkett's church, later called Sandy Run in Bertie county near the Northampton line in 1750. Burkett also organized the Kehukee association of churches. The present Potecasi brick church begun in 1927 is the third house of worship in Potecasi. The second, a large wood structure with a slave gallery stands in a wooded area to the rear of the present building. The first structure of batten board was in mid-town Potecasi. A brush arbor on the creek was used prior to the first board structure. Elam church, Gumberry, was organized in 1788 as Vasser's meeting house (at that time nearly all churches were called meeting houses, only the Quakers have retained the term) and reorganized in 1844 as Elam. Two houses of worship have occupied the same site, the second being dedicated July 1920.\n\nNot until 1821, or 32 years later, was a third Baptist church founded, that of Mt. Carmel near Jackson. However it was a mission known as Smith's Church as far back as 1821. The large rectangular white weatherboard church was built in 1847 on the original five-acre plot.\n\nBegun during the first half of the 19th century were Roberts Chapel 1848, Rich Square 1854, Hebron 1856, and Galatia 1852. Roberts Chapel at Woodard's Crossroads was first an interdenominational “mission chapel”. It is not known for whom it was named. In 1853 the site was deeded by the governor of to the Baptists. On June 1 and 2, 1861, at the opening of the Civil War, Roberts Chapel, along with all Chowan association churches, observed two days of fasting and besought the protection of God against the “northern fanatics”. A new wooden church was built in 1871, burned in 1924, and replaced by a large brick structure on a new site in Pendlton. The present Galatia brick church was built in 1963. The Rich Square Church, first called Corinth, was three-fourths of a mile south of Rich Square. It was organized in 1853 by 20 white members and 10 Negro slaves. In 1891, a part of the members built a place of worship in Rich Square. A few stayed at Corinth, which later became a Negro Methodist church. The present Rich Square church was built in 1951. Hebron, near Woodland, was first organized as an anti-mission body but later reorganized as a missionary church. The small frame church was burned January, 1964 and replaced by a small brick structure the same year.\n\nA lapse of 34 years occurred before any additional Baptist churches were built in the county. In the late 19th century the Jackson 1882, Margarettsville 1889, Seaboard 1892, Creeksville 1892 and Severn 1896 churches were instituted. Seaboard's brick church was built in 1919. In some of the churches of this period deacons were referred to as “elders” and the governing committee as “presbyters”.\n\nTwentieth century churches are Woodland 1902, Conway 1905, Lasker 1906, Ashley's Grove (near Conway) 1909, Bethel (near Seaboard) 1916, Lasker's church was completed in 1908. Woodland's wooden structure was replaced by a brick one in 1949. Ashely's Grove, named for Ashley Liverman, had its origin from a Sunday School organized as early as 1892. Its first church building was completed in 1911, but burned in 1968. A new brick church was dedicated on August 10, 1969, its debt being paid in 1970.\n\nIn 1916 the average pastor's salary was about $400 for pastoring one church, but a pastor would often serve from three to five churches.\n\nThe Roanoke church near Rich Square, founded in 1885 had an enrollment of 30 in 1926, and was not mentioned in association minutes after 1936.\n\nSome Baptist ministers with long years of service in the county have been Dancy Cale, died 1931, with almost 40 years of service, Lonnie Sasser, and Charles W. Scarborough. Some outstanding lay associational leaders have been J. T. Bolton of Rich Square, P. M. Fleetwood of Jackson, R. T. White of Conway, Miss Una White of Severn, and Noah W. Britton of Woodland.\n\nMethodist Churches\n\nConcord church near Seaboard and the line was the first Methodist meeting house in Northampton. A deed for the land was given June 12, 1783 by Howell Hobbs of Brunswick county, , to Matthew Myrick and Nathaniel Mason of Brunswick and Henry King and John Moore of Northampton. These same men signed a covenant on June 5, 1793 to construct a church building on the lot. The small white clapboard church is in use today, making it the oldest continually used church in the county.\n\nThe second oldest Methodist church is Rehoboth, established in 1798. Rehoboth was founded by Richard Whitaker, Jr. who was ordained March 4, 1804. The land for the church was purchased from Eliphas Lewis for one pound sterling and was deeded Agust 28, 1798 to the first trustees: Richard Whitaker, William Brewer, Absolam Grant, William Grant, and Matthew Griffin. The church was first called Rehoboth Chapel and was visited by Bishop Asbury four times. The present church was built in 1857, its slave gallery being removed in 1908.\n\nTremendous growth in Methodism occurred between 1821-1839 when eight new churches were formed. The first of these were Pinners (near Rich Square) and Oak Grove (near Gaston) in 1821. Land for Pinners was given by Joseph Pinner. The original church remained in use until 1973, when it was officially closed but it is being cared for as a memorial by the United Methodists. Oak Grove has had three church buildings, the last being built in 1948. David H. Clements gave the land for the original church. In 1822, Zion church (near Conway) was built. It has had four church buildings. The first was a one-room log cabin with a dirt floor, the second was of wood built in 1828 on the site of the present church, the third was used from 1860 to 1950 when it was replaced by the present brick structure. In 1824 both Bethany in Milwaukee and New Hope in Lasker were founded. The Lasker Methodist Church, founded in 1909 merged with New Hope in 1966. Land for Bethany was given by Joel Pierce and his wife Jinny. In 1830, land was deeded for the Pleasant Grove church, but the building was not completed until 1836. Its present-day Gothic structure of wood was built in 1924. In 1839, both Sharon on the Severn-Margarettesville road and Severn churches were organized. Sharon was built on land given by Micajah Harris. In 1955 a new church was erected. The Severn Methodist church was first known as Providence or Northampton Chapel, (said by two Methodist historians of the county to be “interdenominational”) between Cross Lox and Ramsay's Mill, four miles northwest of Murfreesboro. In 1915 a group of Providence Methodists built a church in Severn.\n\nThe Jackson and Garysburg churches came into being about mid-19th century. Jackson, organized in 1845, is now in its third building, the first being a wood box-like structure with a small balcony. The present building was built in 1906. The Garysburg church was built in 1849 on land given by a non-Methodist, Major R. B. Gary. The church was used as a hospital in 1861 during the Civil War. Major repairs were made in 1956 as a result of Hurricane Hazel.\n\nDuring the late 19th century, five new churches were established: Lebanon, Seaboard, Shiloh, Woodland, and Rich Square. Lebanon, organized in 1878, was destroyed by fire in 1905 and rebuilt in 1907. The church, built on land given by Henry Meacham, was begun after Northampton Chapel meeting house at Jordan's Crossing was abandoned in 1855. Seaboard, organized in 1880, has had two houses of worship, the first in 1885, the second in 1922. Also in 1880 the Shiloh church came into being. It was remodeled in 1925, a new church was built in 1925 and another one in 1973. It has 300 members today. The first Woodland church of weatherboard was built in 1883 on land donated by deed in 1892 by Paul Harrell. The present brick church was completed in 1927. In 1896, the Rich Square church was built of wood but was later veneered. The last Methodist church to be organized in the county was Conway in 1904. The first church was on highway 158 east, mid-town. The second church of stone was built in 1949 on highway 305 south.\n\nSeveral old Methodist churches have been abandoned, the oldest being Smith's Old Chapel organized in 1794 to be used only by Bishop Asbury or “anyone whom he appointed”. The chapel was located across the road from Mt. Carmel Baptist church. Another abandoned church was Moore's Old Meeting House, established possibly in 1799 and located about half way between Jackson and Garysburg, opposite Longview Avenue. In the town of Gaston on the east side of Ferry Road a Methodist meeting house was established in 1849 but no longer exists. Also, near Pleasant Hill and Turner's Cross Road a combination Methodist church and Masonic Temple was constructed on land made available by an 1851 deed. The 1939 records show that a Portuguese Methodist mission near Gaston-Garysburg was then in existence.\n\nRecords show that in the early Zion Sunday School the “Blue Back Speller” was taught to aid the uneducated members to read the Scriptures. In 1828, people attended Zion from an area of over 150 square miles. Three of the trustees that year were from Hertford county. Also, in the early days of Methodism most of the churches in Northampton, Gates, and Hertford counties belonged to the conference although the N. C. conference was organized in 1836. General Layfette stopped at Zion to shake hands with his well-wishers on his 1825 visit in the county.\n\nThe Society of Friends\n\nRecords show that the Society of Friends (or Quarkers) was one of the first Religious Sects to establish a meeting house in the county. Guion Griffis Johnson in Ante-Bellum North Carolina reports Friends meetings in\n\nNorthampton as early as 1681. By 1750 quite a number of Friends had settled in the southern end of the county around Rich Square and Woodland. A few settled around the Jack Swamp area near Pleasant Hill and the line, but it was the southern group that has survived and made a profound and lasting influence in that area.\n\nThe first meeting house was built in Rich Square in 1758 on the triangle of the present downtown area on the main road between the Chowan and Roanoke rivers. The meeting house was moved near the Rich Square depot in 1869 and was sold in 1905 to Andrew J. Connor who used it for a printing office, the Roanoke-Chowan Times being printed there. The same year land was purchased from Connor for another meeting house which was used until 1936 when the meeting house was closed. Some of the Friends united with other denominations. Some joined Cedar Grove Monthly Meeting in Woodland which was established in 1868. Before 1868, Friends in the Woodland-George area were members at Rich Square. The present Cedar Grove house of worship was built in 1868, the two wings being added in 1965.\n\nIn 1905, the Cedar Grove and Rich Square Friends differed with the N. C. Yearly Meeting of Friends in regard to the newly adopted manner of worship. As a result those who objected met as a body at Cedar Grove to form a separate Yearly Meeting, which meets annually in August at Cedar Grove. Friends who favored the new manner of worship (called progressive) affiliated with the small Eagletown Meeting House near Rich Square. The land for the house of worship was given by William Ward and his wife Hattie Elliot Ward.\n\nAfter 1946, no further records were kept. Its members dispersed to join other friends meeting groups. Later the church was destroyed by fire after it became the property of the Grace Independent Baptist Church. The Independent church was rebuilt in the early 1970's.\n\nThe Jack Swamp Meeting House was built in 1775 but the members disbanded in 1829, or as the Friends express it, “the meeting was laid down”. At one time the meeting house stood on a farm about one-half mile from the Pleasant Hill postoffice and later was used as a corn crib. The minutes of the Jack Swamp body are in tact in the Cedar Grove Meeting House and also are on microfilm as are those of Cedar Grove and Rich Square Friends.\n\nFriends have been staunch in their beliefs about slavery and war. The slavery issue caused many Northampton Friends to migrate to and , beginning about 1830. Their view of killing in war has extended from the Revolutionary War through the Vietnam War. Quakers have been equally strong in advocating education and establishing schools. After 1866 numerous private schools have been supported in the county as Brown, Outland, Elliot, Olney, Rich Square, Pinners, Vernons, Peele's schools, and Aurora Academy, all in the Rich Square-Woodland vicinity. In 1769, the Rich Square Society had one person to serve as “Treasure of Books”, later called “Book Agent”, and still later librarian. The left wing of Cedar Grove Meeting house today contains a library and reading room.\n\nThe Society had its largest membership between 1873 and the first decade of the 1900's. Fluctuations in numbers were caused by the establishment of new monthly meetings in other counties of the state, and by a strict discipline code, “Marrying out of society” (that is, outside the religious body without consent of the meeting house) was not allowed until 1874. In the earlier days Friends were required to dress plainly, to speak properly (not to swear), to attend services, and to refrain from a frivolous and “sporty” way of life. As late as the 20th century elderly Friends used pronouns “thee, thou, thy”, wore simple but fine quality gray or black clothing, minus any decorations or adornments. Membership is gained by birthright or choice.\n\nBlack Churches\n\nReligion among the Blacks of Northampton County mainly reflects that of their ancestors. When they were slaves, most blacks were taken to the church of their owners. Rarely were separate churches established as places of worship for blacks. According to Presbyterian records of the Burgwyns of Northampton County had such a chapel. More often the churches had balconies just for the seating of the slaves. (It should be noted that as a rule only a certain number of slaves from each owner were allowed to attend church at a given time.)\n\nToday the majority of the churches of the Northampton County Blacks are of the Baptist denomination. The others are Methodist, Pentecostal Holiness and Jehovah's Witnesses. Some of these churches began very soon after the Civil War ended.\n\nBlack Episcopalians in\n\nNorthampton County\n\nDuring the colonial period, clergymen of the Church of England were active in Northampton County where they ministered to the black as well as to the white population. Between September 29, 1771 and August 24, 1772, the Rev. Charles Edward Taylor reported that he baptized “112 white infants, forty-six Negro infants, two white adults and fifty-five colored adults” in the county. Speaking of the Negroes, he wrote that they were “very desirous of instruction in their duty”.\n\nFollowing the upheavals of the Revolution, the Anglican Church declined considerably. Recovery did not begin in Northampton until the arrival of the Rev. William H. Harison in 1848. Under his leadership, the Church of the Saviour was built at Jackson and consecrated in 1851. It had members from both races.\n\nThe Burgwyns, who had come to Northampton in 1840, were especially zealous in forwarding the interests of the church and in working with their many slaves. Henry King Burgwyn of Thornbury plantation on the Roanoke River erected a chapel for his slaves and saw that regular services were conducted there. Prior to the Civil War, the rector of the church at Jackson lived at Thornbury and conducted services in both locations. The Rev. Frederick Fitzgerald, who had arrived in 1851, recorded that on the afternoons of three Sundays of each month he worked with a black congregation at Jackson. On the fourth Sunday, he instructed the group at Thornbury.\n\nThomas Atkinson, Bishop of , visited Thornbury on several occasions to preach and to confirm. In March, 1854, he reported that Mr. Fitzgerald was being assisted by Daniel Murrell, a candidate for Holy Orders, who was employed as a tutor for the Burgwyn children.\n\nWith obvious pleasure, the Bishop noted that “the good work seems to make gratifying progress”.\n\nThese arrangements continued until the outbreak of the Civil War when all aspects of life in Northampton County were disrupted. Following the war, most of the former slaves became Baptists.\n\nRoanoke Salem\n\nBaptist Church\n\nRoanoke Salem Baptist Church\n\nRoanoke Salem Baptist Church is the oldest Black church in the south end of the county. It was founded before the smoke had cleared the battlefields of the American Civil War. In 1866 under a Brush Arbor a few members of Elam Baptist Church withdrew from the Elam Baptist Church and organized what was to be known as the Roanoke Salem Baptist Church, located off highway 186 between Garysburg and Gumberry. The Roanoke Salem Church began its long history with faith in God and soon became a great educational and spiritual force in the life of the community. For a long time the church pioneered in the training of youth, two of her ministers having sponsored a training school and teaching program until it was replaced by public education.\n\nIn those days very little was kept by way of records, therefore, one has to rely on bits of information gathered from members who might remember some of those who were among the first members of this church.\n\nThe following ministers served as pastors: Revs. Richard I Walden, Annanias Buck, W. H. Woodard, Augustus Shepard, and J. W. Blacknall. Rev. Blacknall served for twenty seven years. Under the leadership of Rev. Blacknall the church experienced a phenomenal growth both in numbers and physical change in the church building. With fifty acres of land, our fathers envisioned adequate space for future development. Rev. Blacknall led in a complete facelifting of the present structure. An addition was added to the entire length of the church running from north to south; on the west of the building beautiful memorial windows were installed.\n\nFollowing the Rev. J. W. Blacknall, Rev. C. C. Staton, Sr. came to the church in May, 1934. Under his leadership the church was completely renovated, from ceiling to floor. The church was completely brick veneered, using eighty thousand bricks. After this came the construction of an Education Building, with adequate space for Sunday School activities and individual classrooms. A modern heating plant was also installed and electric lighting throughout the building, including the sanitary facilities.\n\nAll of this has been realized through the consecrated leadership of Rev. C. C. Staton and his followers. We realize that: “Unless the Lord build the house they labor in vain that built it.” Rev. C. C. Staton is still pastor with an associate, Rev. Edward Flemming.\n\nWillow Oak\n\nAfrican Methodist\n\nEpiscopal Church\n\nWillow Oak African Methodist Episcopal Church\n\nWillow Oak, one of the first black churches in Northampton County, was organized the second Sunday in June, 1866 by the Reverends W. H. Bishop and Henry Epps. Seven dedicated Christians gathered that day, namely, Lazarus Pope, Margaret Pope, Venus Josey, Barbara Wiggins, Anthony Brewer, Mason Brewer and Julia Wilkins. They met under a willow oak tree, for which the church was named. This tree stood on a clay hill beside what is now state highway No. 258, south of Rich Square.\n\nAt first these pioneers had no building so they made a brush arbor under which they worshipped God. In winter they met in an old slab school for protection from the cold. In 1868 they built a wood structure large enough to seat more than 150 people. At this time there were 100 members added to the church.\n\nDuring Rev. R. R. Nichol's administration, 1896-1899, the members purchased the old Corinth Church from the white Baptist members for the sum of $250.00, and very reluctantly moved from the old clay hill next door to where the present church now stands.\n\nUnder the leadership of Rev. L. R. Pearce, 1925-1935, a new structure was built. With Rev. S. A. Fennell as pastor, 1948-1954, the building was renovated, new furniture was purchased and the parsonage was renovated.\n\nPlans for the present structure were made while Rev. G. B. Bowling was pastor, and completed in 1973 during the pastorate of Rev. H. L. Ingram, with the exception of the altar rail, carpet, tile and pastor's study.\n\nIn November 1973 the present pastor, Rev. L. O. Saunders, was assigned to the Rich Square Circuit. Under\n\nhis leadership $10,000 worth of improvements have been made, and through cooperation with the other churches of the Circuit, namely, St. John A. M. E. of Conway and Allen Chapel A. M. E. of Jackson, built a new parsonage in Rich Square.\n\nThe old Willow Oak School was located about ¼ mile from the present Creecy High School. The building was of perpendicular slabs with a chimney occupying each entire end of the structure. The floor was of dirt with logs used for seats. About 100 pupils were in regular attendance, some walking to school as far as from 3 to 5 miles.\n\nSome of the teachers were: Miss Anna Skinner of New Haven Conn., Mr. J. W. Weaver of Rich Square, N. C., Prof. William Jennings, Phil, Pa., Mr. John Reynolds, Murfreesboro, N. C., Miss Annetta Taylor, Hampton, Va. and Mr. William Brewer, Rich Square, N. C.\n\nIn 1899 Willow Oak School was consolidated with Rich Square School to form what became the W. S. Creecy High School. The Willow Oak School was operated under the auspices of the Willow Oak Church.\n\nFull Text of Judge\n\nBurgwyn's Charge\n\nAugust 5, 1937\n\nGentlemen of the grand Jury:\n\nMay I for a few minutes trespass on your time to talk about the County whose grand Inquest you are and whose history is dear to all of us alike, and yet I fear we are beginning to forget the fine examples set us by our forefathers in their great life work of building up a State such as has become, and in providing the foundation upon which is based all that we have and are. Northampton is one of the oldest Counties in the State, formed from Bertie in 1741, there being only eight counties formed before it.\n\nIts history is full of the achievements of great men, a few of whom I shall call to your attention. One of its most distinguished citizens at its inception was John Dawson who died in 1762, and who was member of the N. C. Assembly in 1734, 1739, 1740 from Bertie, and from Northampton 1744-1752; Associate Justice of Superior Court 1751; Colonel commanding Northampton Militia; member of the Governors Council 1752-1762, and who married a daughter of Jeptha Atherton.\n\nAnother, Allen Jones 1739-1798, son of Robin Jones of this County, Attorney General of under the crown, and whose home was at Mt. Gallant in Gaston Township; member of the Colonial Assembly of , and Senator succeeding Whitmel Hill of Bertie as President of that body, Member of the Continental Congress and Brigadier General in the Continental army. One of his daughters married Wm. R. Davie, Governor of the State and for whom Davie County is named, and another married General William Eaton, of this County, a general in the Continental army. Mr. Jones was also a lawyer and stood among the first men of his generation. One of his last official acts was in 1788, to vote for adoption of the U. S. constitution at Hillsboro, which his distinguished brother, Willie Jones of Halifax, voted against and defeated.\n\nJeptha Atherton, Howell Edmonds, Drury Gee, Eaton Haynes, Samuel Lockhart, James Ingram and Robert Peebles all represented this county in the colonial assemblies before the Revolutionary War.\n\nOf her regiment in 1776 William Eaton was Colonel, Jeptha Atherton, Lieut. Colonel and Drury Gee, Major.\n\nA list of some of her representatives and senators in the State Assembly from 1777 to 1850 follows: I quote these names because many of their descendants are now valuable citizens of this county.\n\nSenate—1777 to 1850James Vaughan5 termsSamuel Lockhart2 termsAllen Jones4 termsJno.

Not many of her soldiers bore high office but all of them bore the brunt of the fighting, and time permits me only to name a few of the officers from this County who were as follows:\n\nPaul F. Faison graduate of West Point, and Colonel of the 56th regiment, fought throughout the war and after its termination located in Raleigh where he became a useful and honored citizen.\n\nHarry King Burgwyn, graduate of V. M. I. and Colonel of the 26th N. C. regiment at twenty-one years of age, and killed at the battle of Gettysburg on July 1, 1863, and whose body was brought back after the war and buried in the Confederate cemetery in Raleigh.\n\nCapt.

Stancell, Lamb Bridgers.\n\nLiterally hundreds of others, whose names were equally illustrious, and which time forbids my mentioning to my own regret, but remember it is not always those who attain fame who are alone entitled to glory. Thousands of men whose names will never be written upon the pages of history are entitled to the everlasting gratitude of their people for their service to the State, and remember:\n\n“When God calls up life's heroesTo stand before his faceO many a name unknown to fameWill ring from that high place”\n\nThese men were those who fought for the right of a State to govern itself, and who believed that the framers of the Constitution meant what they wrote therein, that the powers not expressly delegated to the Federal Government were reserved unto the several states; the cause for which these men, your forbearers and mine, fought and died is not, as many think and some assert, the “lost cause” of a dead Confederacy, but it is and always will be the vital cause of a living union without which it will fade away like the “smile of a dream upon the wrinkled face of time.”\n\nIt was very meet, right and proper, that our legislature should have designated a distinguished historian, Maj. John W. Moore of Hertford County, to compose a roster of our troops, and I quote from a letter to him written by the great Chieftain of the men who wore the gray, in regard to his work:\n\n“Your roster will show in part how 's sons bore themselves in the last ordeal. There will be shown the relative proportion of the troops to her population capable of bearing arms and the long list of killed and wounded, prove they were not in the rear in attack or in the front in retreat.\n\n“I have before expressed my high estimate of the conduct of North Carolinians during our war, but can eulogy enhance the fair fame with which their names will descend to posterity? That their children and their children's children may be WORTHY OF THEIR SIRES is the best wish and highest hope which I can offer for them.\n\nFaithfully yours,\n\nJEFFERSON DAVIS.”\n\nAnd yet this County is one of the few, if not the only county in the State which has raised no stone to commemorate the valor and heroism of her sons. This should be done; it is as little as we can do.\n\nI call to your attention the words of William Henry Trescott engraved on the marble shaft in front of the State Capital. Columbia, South Carolina, as summing up in eloquent truth the bravery and sacrifice of the men of the South.\n\n“This monumentPerpetuates the memory of those whoTrue to the instincts of their birth,Faithful to the teachings of their fathers,Constant in their love for the StateDied in the performance of their duty, whoGlorified a fallen causeBy the simple manhood of their livesThe patient enduring of sufferingAnd the heroism of death, and whoIn the dark hours of imprisonmentIn the hopelessness of the hospital,In the short, sharp agony of the field,Found support and consolation in the beliefThat at home they would not be forgotten.These for whom they diedSubscribe to this marbleThe perpetual gratitude of the State they servedThe undying affection of those whose livesThe separation of deathHas shadowed with an everlasting sorrow.Let the stranger,Who may in future timesRead this inscriptionRecognize that these were men,Whom power could not corrupt,Whom death could not terrify,Whom defeat could not dishonorAnd let their virtues plead for just judgmentOf the cause in which they perished;Let the South CarolinianOf another generation RememberThat the state taught themHow to live and how to dieAnd that from her broken fortunesShe has preserved for her childrenThe priceless heritage of their memories,Teaching all who claim the same birthright,That truth, courage and patriotism Endure forever.”\n\nThen after the war came a struggle which required as much courage, physical and moral, as fighting on battlefields; it was the struggle for survivorship from Reconstruction Government. In this, men of your county immortalized themselves. And many names are or should be forever inscribed upon the hearts of our countrymen.\n\nSamuel Calvert, member of the Constitutional Convention 1835, member of the House of Representatives, and long standing for the finer things in this life, and dying about 1881 a very great patriarch, he gave to the Episcopal, Methodist and Baptist churches in this town the lots on which they now stand.\n\nThomas Bragg, Democratic Elector 1844, canvassing the State against W. W. Cherry of Bertie, and again 1848 canvassing against Kenneth Raynor of Bertie and again in 1853 against Hon. David A. Barnes, and 1854 elected Governor of the State over General Alfred Dockery of Richmond County; 1856 re-elected over Hon. John A. Gilmer; 1860 U. S. Senator from this State; 1861 Attorney General of the Confederacy, dying in Raleigh in 1872.\n\nDavid A. Barnes, Lawyer and great advocate of the Whig cause. Member of our Senate and legislature defeating Gov. Bragg for this place in 1844; Judge of the Superior Court in the trying times following the Civil War, and dying a resident of Hertford County, beloved and admired by all its people.\n\nMatt W. Ransom, Atty. General of at 26; member of the House from this County in 1858 and 1860; Lieut. Col. of the First Regiment of State troops, 1861-Col. of the 35th Regiment, 1862- Brigadier General 1863 and Major General 1865; procuring the writ of Habeas Corpus from Judge Brooks which freed the democratic leaders of the State from imprisonment in 1870; U. S. Senator from 1872-1896; U. S. Minister to and dying in 1904 in the Home Seat “Verona” on Oct. 8th. Caldwell, the great editor of the Charlotte Observer said of him: “He was our fullest scholar, our most accomplished diplomat, the handsomest man among us, the ablest man, the man who did us more credit in the eyes of the country. He is indeed the last of the Romans.”\n\nThos. William Mason, graduate of the Universities of N. C. and ; aide to General Robert Ransom in the Confederate Army; Captain therein; the greatest orator of his generation in this State. His speech at the unveiling of the Confederate monument in Raleigh, stands today as a shining example of mastery of language, eloquence, patriotism and sentiment. Many times a member of the House and Senate from this County, Democratic nominee for Lieut. Governor of the State and for U. S. senator. He died at his country seat “Longview” leaving behind to his children the priceless heritage of a “good name” and mourned by all the people of his county.\n\nRobert Bruce Peebles, Adjutant to General Matt W. Ransom, Captain in the Confederate Army, one of the leaders in the battle for survivorship, brave as a lion, representing the county in the legislature several terms and finally Superior Court Judge of N. C. He left his mark on the affairs of State and County, and fought on and on when there was nothing left except the will which said to him fight on.\n\nRev. William Grant, preacher and judge, who always fought for the betterment of our people, temporally and spiritually.\n\nRobert T. Beale, Judge of the County Court with Mason and Grant.\n\nThos. R. Ransom died as a victim of that political struggle contracting the fatality which ended his young life in the election day 1895.\n\nW. J. Rogers, democratic nominee for Congress dying before the election after his nomination.\n\nW. W. Peebles, State Senator, orator and lawyer of great distinction.\n\nBenjamin Stancell Gay, valiant fighter for the right, lawyer of ability and a man of great and good heart. Member of the House and Senate many times, and father of our friend Hon. A. C. Gay.\n\nGarland E. Midyette, Solicitor of the District and its Superior Court Judge, literally dying in harness and almost\n\non the Bench in the performance of his duties; father of our young friend Mr. Buxton Midyette.\n\nRaymond Gay Parker, Judge of the Superior Court, and like Judge Midyette, dying while a young man with his full armour on.\n\nFrank R. Harris and Calvert G. Peebles, both good lawyers and both honored by their people with election to the House and Senate respectively.\n\nSimon Flythe, for over 20 years Clerk of Court in this County; Millard Stancell, Sheriff and Register of Deeds for many years; Wiley Fleetwood, Register of Deeds; W. H. Joyner, Sheriff of the County, member of the House and Senate; all active and fearless workers for our good for many years.\n\nJas. S. Grant and Dr. Carl Parker, members of the House; Dr. Mahlon Bolton, twice a member of the House, and one of the most beloved men in our County.\n\nAndrew J. Connor, a private in the ranks, who for forty years published a newspaper in this county and deserves as much credit as any one for its material and spiritual advancement; J. W. Weaver, Everett Baugham, Cola Harrell, E. B. Lassiter, Jno. B. Griffin, Jno. W. Buxton, Albert Vann, Capt. A. J. Roundtree, Geo. P. Burgywn, J. G. L. Crocker, J. A. Burgywn, each Treasurer of the County for many years and many others deserve honorable mention.\n\nLiving survivors of that conflict are S. J. Calvert, former State Senator and Register of Deeds, J. B. Stephenson, several times a member of the House, and H. L. Joyner, Sheriff of the County for 30 years, the longest term ever held by any man in this State in that office, and now a member of the House of Representatives.\n\nI would not forget another class of gentlemen who went about doing good and whose influence was felt for the betterment of the condition of our people — the country doctor — Drs. Barrow, Copeland, Weaver, Wood, Jordan, Ellis, Stancell, Ramsay, Stephenson, Bryant, Moore, Futrell, Morehead, Joyner, Whims, Bolton, McDaniel, Lassiter, Parker, and the late, beloved and lamented Henry Wilkins Lewis and others whose lives and characters meant much to this county and State.\n\nThese men, and others, too numerous to mention joined their hands and hearts and lived together and saved their country and their state.\n\n“He who saves his country saves himself,Saves all things, and all things savedDo bless them; Who lets his country die,Lets all things die; dies himself ignoblyAnd all things dying curse him.”\n\nIt can truthfully be said of them that they fought the good fight, they finished their course, and which is more, they kept the faith.\n\n“Our fathers to their graves have gone,Their strife is O'er, their battle won,But sterner trials await the race,Which rises in their honored place;The moral warfare of the crimeAnd folly of an evil time”\n\nYou and I, gentlemen of the Grand Jury, are the descendants of these men; many of you are the companions of my youth and for whom I have not only respect and regard but real affection. This county is as dear to you as it is to me; in it we were born; in it we live and in its bosom today lie sleeping the earthly remains of those who were near and dear to us; its traditions are as sacred to you as they are to me and I have no hesitancy in placing its weal and welfare in your hands.\n\nEducation\n\nin Northampton\n\nThe first schools in Northampton County were conducted in private homes and there are no known records of these. However, by the late 1700's and early 1800's academies for boys and finishing schools for young ladies were beginning to be established, especially in the Northampton County Courthouse area.\n\nThe first recorded military academy in Northampton, and the second in the state of , called the Wrenn Military Academy, was built by Tilbert Wrenn in 1795 on the site of what is now the Thomas Newsome home in Jackson. Tilbert Wrenn came to Northampton County from Surrey County in . An editorial in the Raleigh Star (May 8, 1810) shows that this school ran for at least 15 years.\n\nAdvertisements in the Petersburg Intelligencer, the Halifax Advocate, the Edenton Gazette, the Richmond Whig, and the Raleigh Register show that Northampton Academy was established between 1831 and 1835 in Jackson, referred to then as the Courthouse Village.\n\nAnother of these early schools were Northampton Female Seminary, established in 1833 with Richard H. Weaver, William B. Lockhart, Etheldred People, Issac Hall, Samuel B. Spruill, Shirley Tisdale, and Willie Langford constituted as the corporate body.\n\nJust outside Jackson, Robert and Ben Peele, sons of Issac Peele, opened Peele Academy from 1845 to 1855 in their country home for the training and instruction of younger brothers and sisters and the sons and daughters of friends and neighbors.\n\nThe Elms Dependency\n\nSamuel James Calvert operated a school in the mid-1800's in the pictured dependency of his home “The Elms.” Miss Leathe Barrow and later Miss Lou Whitfield\n\ntaught the children of the neighborhood in the one-room structure heated by an open fireplace. Miss Lou later taught for many years in the Episcopal Female Academy located behind The Church of the Saviour.\n\nIn 1849 a young ladies’ finishing school called St. Catherines Hall was opened and conducted by Misses Pattie and Anna Copeland in their home facing on the village green. This home now belongs to and is lived in by Miss Louise Skyes of Jackson and New York City.\n\nOn March 15, 1870 Samuel Calvert deeded one acre of land in Jackson Township to Jerry Gary, William Barrow, and Burton Jones, the school committee, for the “sole and exclusive purpose of a school for freedmen and no other.” This school was located approximately on the site of the present J. S. Jenkins Cotton Warehouses.\n\nThe Male Academy of Jackson was built near the present site of the Episcopal church in 1884. The school was burned in the great fire of 1895, but not before the young men of Northampton were exposed to training under three of the master teachers of the day, John Drake, Andrew Britton and Rev. Charles Fetter.\n\nIn 1896 Jackson Female Academy opened with Miss Lou Whitfield as principal. So great was the influence of this good woman and fine teacher that the children and grandchildren of her former students still visit her grave in the churchyard of St. Luke's at Benn's Church, Surrey County, Va. to pay her homage.\n\nAlthough the constitution of 1776 provided for public schools, this provision lay dormant until 1839, when the Literary Fund had grown large enough to make a feeble beginning of the public school system possible. These funds were allotted to the counties and provided only for teachers’ salaries ($15 to $20 per month for a four month term).\n\nA county examiner was appointed, whose duty it was to pass on the qualifications of those who wished to teach. Samuel N. Buxton was the first “examiner” in Northampton. Those applying to teach were mostly men. Some of these were real teachers; others were noted disciplinarians.\n\nThere was no provision for buildings, furniture or equipment. Some schools were held in abandoned buildings and some in community constructed one room log huts. The furniture was sparce and homemade. It was this type of edifice that created the term “Old field school”. McGuffey's Readers, Webster's Blueback Spellers and North American Arithmetic were the textbooks of the day. Even this feeble attempt at public education ceased at the outbreak of the Civil War.\n\nPrivate schools called academies or institutes maintained in the several communities or neighborhoods were Northampton's answer to the education problem immediately following the Civil War. These schools and those who taught in them constitute the back log of our present school system.\n\nThe Seaboard community had Louis Foster, followed by W. C. Parker. Between Seaboard and Jackson, Robert and Ben Peele taught in their home. In Jackson, Charles Fetter, Andrew Britton, Misses Anna and Pattie Copeland, Miss Leathe Barrow and Miss Lou Whitfield held the fort against ignorance.\n\nAround the turn of the century, governor Charles Brantley Aycock really put the public school system of on its way. Laws were enacted to permit local taxation and consolidation of school districts. In Northampton these innovations were adopted first by those sections along the railroads. Seaboard was the first district to vote the special tax; then followed Gumberry, Margarettsville, Severn Pendleton, Milwaukee, Potecasi, and Woodland. Vultare was the first strictly rural district to vote in the school tax which made it possible to erect new and larger buildings, employ more and better trained teachers and extend the three months term to six, and later seven or eight.\n\nThe State Department, in cooperation with the colleges, set up certain standards which, if met by the high schools, would permit their graduates to enter colleges without examinations. Seven was the first Northampton High School to meet these requirements; Woodland, Jackson, Rich Square, Seaboard, Conway, and Gaston followed.\n\nThrough the years, the public schools have drawn many fine people to Northampton County, who have done much to raise the cultural level. Many of these have gone on to important places in education at the statewide level: Rich Square had Dr. D. B. Bryan who later served as Dean of Wake Forest College for several decades; Severn had Kader Curtis, for many years superintendent of Wilson County schools; Jackson remembers W. B. Edwards, later president of Chowan College; many still recall the gentle, alert Hannah Starr of Olney School in Woodland; people in Pendleton, Rich Square, Seaboard, and Jackson will remember J. R. Ware, who spurred them on to further study in college and university; and Gaston can never forget the vigor with which Mrs. L. L. Harvin urged them on to their best efforts.\n\nNorthampton has been blessed by teachers who remained to become a part of our life, taking their place in the civic, cultural and religious life of our county. Numbered among these are: Mrs. Pattie Vaughan White Holoman, Grace White Stephenson, Bernice Kelly Harris, Jennie Williams Lewis, Ruby Fagg Flythe, “Bill” Pleasants Flythe, and Blanche Sloane Gay.\n\nNorthampton Schools have also kept many of our fine people at home to devote their lives in loving and interested service to the training of the youth of the county. Among these are Miss Minnie Taylor, Maggie B. Bridgers, Audrey Long and Spurgeon Clarke.\n\nMany fine business men have served, giving valuable time, thought, and hours of work to serve as school committeemen and as members of the county board of education. Some of these were B. J. Martin, E. B. Lassiter, W. E. Harris, Andrew Crocker, E. S. Bowers, A. L. Lassiter, W. Harry Stephenson, W. C. Conner, and many others.\n\nThe first county superintendent of schools was Frank E. Foster of Seaboard, son of the noted teacher, Louis Foster. Mr. Wiley Fleetwood became the next superintendent and was followed by Mr. Andrew Conner of Rich Square. In 1897, P. J. Long of Jackson was elected superintendent and served until 1939. Under the direction of these fine and able men, the public school system in Northampton grew until it covered the county like the dew.\n\nHowever, hard times and upheaval were on the way. The financial disaster of 1929-1933 made consolidation of the smaller schools in rural communities necessary, bringing hurt and heartbreak in many cases. After the state\n\ntook over the financial responsibility of public education in in 1931, further consolidation was deemed educationally and financially wise, and the Supreme Court Decision of 1954 brought integration of schools to Northampton County.\n\nWhen N. L. Turner succeeded Paul J. Long as Superintendent of the Northampton County Schools on July 3, 1939, there were eleven union schools (schools which have both elementary and high school students) and forty elementery schools making a total of fifty-one schools. The number of teachers in the schools ranged from one to sixteen.\n\nDuring the 1939-40 term there were 232 teachers and principals employed and the average daily attendance the preceding year was 6,726 students.\n\nThe members of the Northampton County Board of Education on July 3, 1939 were: Dr. J. Wesley Parker, chairman; J. A. Shaw, Dr. C. G. Parker, Claude Deloatche, L. F. Bradly, W. Harry Stephenson, J. A. Madry, W. F. Nelson, and R. V. Beale.\n\nSince 1939 the following, in addition to the present members and those listed above, have served on the Board of Education: B. F. Ricks, J. R. Woodard, G. L. Ricks, H. P. Stephenson, V. D. Strickland, W. C. Conner, S. E. Crew, Ralph W. Britt, James Hedspeth, C. G. Parker, Jr. J. J. Heller, Lawrence H. Taylor, Jr., and Marshall W. Grant.\n\nIn addition to Dr. J. W. Parker who was serving as chairman in 1939, Dr. C. G. Parker, W. C. Conner, and Scott Bowers have served as chairman.\n\nThe present members of the Board are: Lynmore S. Gay, chairman: E. Scott Bowers, James M. Beasley, James H. Jones, Mrs. J. Roy Parker, Mrs. Diane M. Clark, and Grover L. Edwards.\n\nAs the statewide school bus system developed and more funds, both local and state, were appropriated school officials and the citizens of the county realized that the schools would be much better in the event that they were consolidated into larger units. The trend toward larger and more effective schools has been developing through the years. At the end of N. L. Turner's term as Superintendent in 1958, 233 teachers were employed. Under the able leadership of Superintendent Turner, the Board of Education, and citizens of the county, the number of schools during the period from 1939 to 1958 was reduced from 51 to 21. By consolidation the schools became larger and thus the educational opportunities were enhanced. The Gumberry High School was constructed during this period.\n\nE. D. Johnson served as Superintendent from 1958 until 1961. During his tenure improvements continued to be made in the schools. An addition was made to the Gumberry High School.\n\nWhen Roy F. Lowry became Superintendent July 1, 1961 there were 21 schools. The Cool Springs School had been reactivated during the tenure of E. D. Johnson.\n\nDuring the last fourteen years under the leadership of the members of the Board of Education, citizens who believe in good schools, the staff of the schools, and the Central Office Staff, much has been done to enhance the educational opportunities of the students which were begun in an able manner by prior Boards of Education, prior Superintendents, citizens, and staff.\n\nThere are now fourteen schools in the county as follows: Coates, Grades K-4, 11 teachers; Conway, Grades 5-8, 18 teachers; Eastside, Grades K-4, 11 teachers; Garysburg, Grades K-8 33 teachers; Gaston, Grades 6-12, 28 teachers; Gumberry, Grades 9-12, 23 teachers; Jackson, Grades 5-8, 9 teachers; Northampton County High School, Grades 9-12, 38 teachers; Rich Square, Grades 5-8, 14 teachers; Seaboard, Grades 5-8, 10 teachers; Squire, Grades K-5, 25 teachers; Willis Hare, Grades K-4, 17 teachers; W. S. Creecy, Grades K-4 and 9-12, 29 teachers; and Woodland-Olney, Grades K-8, 19 teachers.\n\nThere were 285 teachers and principals employed during the 1974-75 school term.\n\nStudents who formerly went to six small high schools now attend the Northampton County High School. The Northampton County High School is a centralized educational institution which, like many of its counterparts in the county, is offering diversified and qualitative programs of education to its students. This school and the Gaston, Gumberry, and W. S. Creecy High Schools are offering more comprehensive programs than were possible before the schools were further consolidated. The Garysburg School is a modern elementary school and the newest one in the county.\n\nDuring the past fourteen years one or more additions have been made to the Coates, Eastside, Gaston, Gumberry, Jackson, Squire, Willis Hare, and W. S. Creecy Schools. Additions or remodeling are now under way at the Eastside, Seaboard, and Woodland-Olney Schools.\n\nThe value of the schools in the county has increased from $3,759,000.00 in 1962 to $8,981,600.00. This $5,222,600.00 increase in the dollar value of the schools demonstrates that there is outstanding support and leadership being given by the Board of Education members and citizens of the county.\n\nWhile the monetary value of the schools has become much greater the increase in educational opportunities for the students which has been steadily increasing since the beginning of the County School System is more important.\n\nIn addition to the state supported schools there is operating in Lasker a private school called Northeast Academy. This institution founded in 1966 offers Grades K-12.\n\nCertainly the quality of education in the Northampton County Schools has been improving since the first school was established and is being improved each year.\n\nOld Jackson School\n\nEducational Report North Carolina\n\nMebane\n\n1896-7\n\n1897-8\n\n674BIENNIAL REPORT OF THE\n\ntional purposes and in consequence the corporation became extinct. But during its existence it exerted a strong influence for good.\"\n\nIn Wilmington, as in Newbern, Edenton and many other towns dancing was considered a part of polite education. General Davie expressed much gratification that polished French refugees from Hayti and emigrants from France could be procured. One of the best markers in Wilmington appears to have been - Clay, who, among other beautiful figures, promised to instruct in the mysteries of Parsby's Rigadvon.\n\nNORTHAMPTON.\n\nFormed in 1741, from Bertie.\n\nIncorporated Schools.-Northampton Female Seminary, chartered 1833; North Carolina Male and Female Academy, chartered 1836.\n\nThe last of the above charters was amendatory of the first.

Y., and she would open a school for females on his plantation. Board and tuition for five months $40.\n\nMr. Julian Picot taught for many years at Buckhorn in this county. He had a well earned reputation.\n\nRev. Charles Fetter was Principal of the Jackson Male Academy for four years, succeeding A. J. Britton. In 1878 he was elected Principal of the new Academy at Garysburg, which position he held until the Fall of 1885, with the exception of one year.\n\nRev.

Fisher.\n\nFrom mid-eighteenth century (or earlier), when Councillor John Dawson of Bridgers Creek bequeathed his “young horse Exum” to his son, until 1900, horses were a primary source of income and sport in Northampton County — income for breeders, sport for those who raced or put their money on the horses. On the whole, however, the county was more concerned with breeding horses than with racing them.\n\nSoon after Jeptha Atherton settled at the courthouse in 1762, he acquired the imported stallion Janus, one of the great progenitors of the American turf, the sire of “an immense number of short distance Racers, brood mares and stallions...” The significant characteristic of the early American race horses was their ability to run quarter-mile races; they were not long distance runners.\n\nAllen Jones of Mount Gallant plantation and his brother Willie of Halifax, sons of Attorney General Robert Jones of The Castle, both kept stables in Northampton. Closely allied to Gen. Allen Jones by family ties were the Haynes brothers, Eaton and Herbert. As early as 1770, the well-known Mark Anthony stood at Herbert Haynes's plantation. Eaton Haynes bred Cleopatria by Druid and, in 1811, bequeathed her to the distinguished turfman, Allen Jones Davie.\n\nAlthough there were a few quarter-mile straight-away courses in Northampton, there was little evidence of organized racing in the county before 1800; local owners seemed to have raced their stock at neighboring and Carolina tracks. With the 1816 arrival of Sir Archie at the stables of William Amis at Mowfield plantation, interest in horses increased to fever pitch in the county. This “foundation sire of the American turf” is too well documented to require discussion here. Suffice it to say that "
