DUDLEY, President, Greensboro.\n\nThe Agricultural and Mechanical College for the Colored Race was established by an act of the General Assembly of North Carolina, ratified March 9, 1891. The leading object of the institution is declared by the act to be instruction in practical agriculture, the mechanic arts, and such branches of learning as relate thereto.\n\nThe management and control of the college and the care and preservation of all its property is vested in a board of trustees, consisting of fifteen members, who are elected by the General Assembly, or appointed by the Governor, for a term of six years.\n\nThe trustees, by the act of the Legislature, have power to prescribe rules for the management and preservation of good order and morals at the college; to elect the president, instructors, and as many other officers and servants as they shall deem necessary; have charge of the disbursements of the funds, and have general and entire supervision of the establishment and maintenance of the college.\n\nThe financial support of the college for the payment of salaries and purchase of apparatus and equipment is derived, for the most part, from the United States, under an act of Congress, known as the \"Morrill Act,\" passed August 20, 1890. This act makes an annual appropriation for each State and Territory for the endowment and support of colleges for the benefit of agriculture and mechanic arts, to be applied \"only to instruction in agriculture, the mechanic arts, the English language and the various branches of mathematics, physical, natural, and economic sciences, with special reference to their application in the industries of life and to the facilities of such instruction.\"\n\nThe college also receives an appropriation from the State for general maintenance, which cannot be provided for under the laws governing the use of Federal appropriations.\n\nThe citizens of Greensboro donated fourteen acres of land and $11,000, to be used in construction of buildings. In 1893 this was supplemented by an appropriation of $10,000 by the General Assembly. The main building, one of the finest school edifices in North Carolina, was completed in 1893, and the school opened in the fall of that year.\n\nPage 152\n\nEvery negro who will observe the splendid record of success and of usefulness which the graduates almost without exception are making must naturally feel grateful to the \"Old North State\" for the excellent work that this Commonwealth is doing for the uplift of its negro citizens. Every intelligent citizen, black or white, who will note the substantial interest and splendid support that this institution is receiving from every State official and from the representatives of the people in every Legislature, must admire the wise and liberal treatment North Carolina is giving for the maintenance of helpful institutions for her negro citizens, and ever appreciate the excellent results that are being accomplished. It is certain no negro can study the important work of this institution and its influence for the advancement of all people without feeling a stronger sense of obligation to his State that he should strive to be a better, truer, and more patriotic citizen of the great State of North Carolina.\n\nThe institution is located in the eastern part of the city of Greensboro, about one mile from the railway station, upon an elevated tract of about 25 acres of land. About a mile from the college the institution has a farm of 103Â½ acres, most of which is under cultivation.\n\nThe college has four modern brick buildings, two barns, a small dairy building, two small greenhouses, a piggery, and a few smaller buildings.\n\nThe college has outgrown its facilities for instruction in mechanic arts. The present equipment, which is the original, with very few additions, is wearing out and in some cases obsolete. The influence of this department is far-reaching, as is evidenced by the work of the graduates. Among the graduates of this institution are some of the best and most progressive mechanics in North Carolina. There are substantial evidences of their work in Raleigh. St. Agnes Hospital is probably the most conspicuous. This building was erected by J. W. Holmes, a graduate of the A. and M. College. He is superintendent of industries at St. Augustine's School, Raleigh. The Tupper Memorial Building at Shaw University was designed and built by G. A. Edwards, a graduate of the A. and M. College. G. A. Edwards is in charge of the mechanical department at Shaw. There is a large demand for graduates in mechanics from this institution to organize and take charge of the mechanical courses in the schools of the State, showing that the other institutions are using the mechanical department of the A. and M. College as a model. The superintendent and\n\nPage 153\n\nmanager of the Durham Textile Mills, C. C. Amey, is a graduate of this institution. The negroes of the State are appreciating better every day the advantages of this school as a trade school, and this is due to the success of the trade students.\n\nThe A. and M. College, in order to keep its standard of instruction and usefulness, will have to increase its equipment for instruction in the trades. The efficiency of the mechanical department of the A. and M. College would be greatly increased if provisions were made for a thorough overhauling of such machines and tools as are now in that department and the addition of a few new machines and tools to meet the greatly increased demands for instruction.\n\nFor instruction in agriculture, the college has no building and practically no facilities, yet the college has made greater advancement and has achieved greater success along this than any other line. The best evidence of the value of the instruction in agriculture as given at the A. and M. College is found in the success of its graduates. W. T. Johnson, a graduate, is running a very successful farm near Greensboro, and is doing a thriving dairy business in the city. One graduate in Cumberland County is clearing over $1,000 a year on his farm; a graduate of the class of 1908, who is operating his own farm in Cumberland County, has recently organized a dairy company in Fayetteville which is doing a thriving business. Another graduate of the class of 1907, who has been running his own farm of 100 acres in Chatham County, has recently been appointed farm demonstrator by the U. S. Department of Agriculture for Guilford County. In a civil service examination held last year to secure eligibles for the appointment of a teacher of agriculture at the Carlisle Indian School, one of our graduates stood the highest and received the appointment. A number of our graduates are employed in dairy industries. A member of the class of 1910 is employed by the Rennie Dairy Company, of Richmond, Va., as buttermaker. This company churns over 1,000 gallons of cream daily. A graduate of the class of 1907 is employed as head teacher at the Voorhees Normal and Industrial School in South Carolina; one is superintendent of a 1,200-acre farm at the Brick School, Edgecombe County; another is running his own farm in Alamance County; a graduate of the class of 1902 is florist at Tuskegee Institute, Tuskegee, Ala.; another has charge of the orchards, and still another is in charge of the live-stock department at that famous institution.\n\nPage 154\n\nSeveral graduates are teaching in agricultural schools. One is in charge of the agricultural department of the Colored A. and M. College of West Virginia, and one of the graduates of the class of 1909 is teaching in the State Normal School at Fayetteville, N. C. Until recently one of our graduates had charge of the agricultural department in the State Normal School for negroes at Frankfort, Ky. A number of our graduates are farming and teaching rural schools during the winter months. A graduate in Halifax County is one of the few colored teachers who has succeeded in establishing a rural library in connection with his school.\n\nThe number of students in the agricultural department has increased fivefold in the past five years, which goes to show that the thoughtful colored boy is recognizing the fact that farming offers better inducements than any other line of industry, and he is, therefore, seeking training to that end.\n\nAll of the graduates of last year's class were from the agricultural department. These students come directly from the farm for the purpose of getting instruction in the modern methods of farming in order to produce maximum crops at a minimum cost. It is a business proposition to them, pure and simple. They are seeking an education in order to increase their productive capacity. Every time the A. and M. College increases the productive capacity of a student, it increases the productive capacity of the State, and thereby increases the wealth of the State to that extent. Therefore, every dollar expended by the State in increasing the productive capacity of its colored citizens is a business proposition in the present sense.\n\nIn order that the A. and M. College may meet the demands made upon it for instruction in agriculture, it is necessary that a building and equipment be provided for this purpose similar to that already provided by the State for instruction in the mechanic arts. Money invested by the State for this purpose will, in course of time, revert to the State in the form of taxes from increased agricultural development.\n\nPage 155\n\nSUMMARY.\n\nFounded 1891 Number of buildings 7 Number of acres of land owned 128Â½ Value of buildings and equipment $ 102,572 Value of land $ 27,000 Number of volumes in the library 1,494 Number of students (incomplete) 315 Number of faculty 19 Income from State appropriation $ 12,500 Income from Federal appropriation 14,850\n\nPRESIDENTS.\n\nJOHN O.

PICOT, M.D., Superintendent, Raleigh.\n\nThe State Hospital at Raleigh is situated one mile directly southwest of the city of Raleigh, just over the city's boundary line. The house was erected on the apex of the watershed between Walnut Creek on the south and Rocky Branch on the north and is drained in the best natural sanitary manner possible.\n\nEvery one knows that this institution was built for the unfortunate of North Carolina by the unceasing and persistent efforts of Miss Dorothy Dix, who appeared before the Legislature in 1848, and by the effective help and eloquent plea of the Hon. James C. Dobbin, of Fayetteville, the passage of the bill was secured by a vote of a hundred and one yeas and ten nays.\n\nThe act provided for the appointment of six commissioners--Honorables John M. Morehead, of Guilford; Calvin Graves, of Caswell; T. N. Cameron, of Cumberland; G. W. Mordecai, of Wake; C. L. Hinton, of Wake, and G. O. Watson, of Johnston--to select and purchase a tract of land upon which to erect a building for the purpose of providing for the insane. These commissioners did their work without compensation, and that they did it well is manifested by the elegant and substantial structure upon this site.\n\nIn 1856 the building was near enough to completion for the first board of directors to instruct Dr. E. C. Fisher to order in 40 patients, Dr. Fisher having been elected superintendent by the board. Dr. Fisher held this office until July 7, 1868, when he was superseded by Dr. Eugene Grissom. Dr. Grissom held the office until succeeded by Dr. William K. Wood, of Halifax County, who remained in office but a short while, and was succeeded by Dr. George L. Kirby, who died of pneumonia in February, 1901. Dr. James McKee was elected the following March as his successor. He died in office in 1912 and was succeeded by Dr. J. L. Picot.\n\nThe Legislatures have gradually awakened to the necessity of providing for the insane. The Legislature of 1904 gave the Hospital $40,000, and with it a more commodious fireproof building was erected, with a capacity of 80 additional female patients. The Legislature of 1907 enacted a law providing for a Hospital Commission, and gave them $500,000 to add to the building and erect upon the\n\nPage 160\n\ngrounds such structures as would be conducive to the comfort and restoration of the health of the insane. A storehouse was the first building put up by the commission, at a cost of $4,200; then a carpenter shop at a cost of $3,800. Next an annex for 100 men, at a cost of $48,265. Out of the $500,000 appropriation the Legislature required them to pay for the Grimes land, 1,136 acres, at a cost of $53,500.\n\nIn 1908 the commission disbursed the following amounts: In February, $11,405,75 for heating, plumbing, sewer pipes, sewers, and an addition to complete storeroom; in October, 1908, one building for women, $21,900; three groups of buildings, making nine, at $14,813 apiece, one of these groups being for male convalescent patients, and the other two male and female epileptic, respectively, and with the cost of sewer and pipe connection with the A. and M. College, costing $500, aggregating $66,919.\n\nSUMMARY.\n\nFounded 1856 Number of buildings 15 Number of acres of land 1,311 Number of patients 1,114 Number of attendants 58 Annual appropriation $175,000\n\nWESTERN HOSPITAL FOR THE INSANE.\n\nJOHN MCCAMPBELL, M.D., Superintendent, Morganton.\n\nThe State Hospital at Morganton was founded in 1875, but was not regularly opened for the reception of patients until 1883. At the time of its opening, it had a capacity of about 225 patients. Completion of the north wing brought the capacity up to 420 beds. From time to time buildings have been added until the entire plant now comprises ten buildings for patients, with a total capacity of approximately 1,250 beds. The present population, including those away on parol, is 1,309. The demand for admission is far in excess of the capacity of the house, and more than one-third of those applying have to be rejected for lack of room. The hospital is in sore need of increased capacity and better facilities for the treatment of acute cases. The annual appropriation for support during the past two years has been $195,000, which, with strict economy, has been sufficient.\n\nPage 161\n\nSUMMARY.\n\nInstitution founded 1875 Number of buildings 10 Number of acres of land 900 Number of inmates 1,309 Number of attendants 90 Annual appropriation $ 195,000\n\nSUPERINTENDENTS.\n\nDR.

I regret that I have been unable to secure from the Superintendent a revised statement for the present Manual.--ED.\n\nM. E. STREET, M.D., Superintendent, Aberdeen, N. C.\n\nThe North Carolina Sanatorium for the Treatment of Tuberculosis was authorized by an act of the General Assembly of 1907. For this purpose the General Assembly appropriated the sum of $15,000 for construction and $5,000 annual maintenance. The sum of $7,750 was expended for land amounting to 950 acres. Three buildings were begun in 1908, consisting of one two-story pavilion, 46 Ã 68, which would accommodate about 35 patients when completed, a kitchen and dining-room, dining-room to accommodate 20 patients, and one three-room cottage for help to live in. A part of this tract of land consists of a farm with an eight-room farmhouse; there are about 60 acres in cultivation.\n\nThe General Assembly of 1909 appropriated $30,000 to continue the work of construction and increased the annual maintenance to $7,500. This enabled the institution to install power plant, to furnish lights and pump water--a complete water system; plenty pure fresh water is furnished from two deep wells, one of these wells being 225 feet and the other 245 feet; plumbing in all the buildings, a complete sewer system; finish the buildings begun with the first appropriation, and erect the following new buildings: One two-story pavilion to accommodate about 20 patients; one large club-house for amusement of such patients as can take exercise; one fourteen-room nurses' building, superintendent's cottage, four-room cottage for colored help, four-room cottage for electrician at power plant, fumigating-room and crematory. A large kitchen and dining-hall to accommodate 100 patients are in course of construction, with funds in hand to pay for same. Also, repairs on farmhouse, for the fencing of 300 acres of land, including farm and 200 acres in park; 50 acres have been parked; and development of farm, and a dairy. Three hundred and twenty-five acres of land were purchased with the last appropriation for $1,200, making in all 1,275 acres of land.\n\nPage 163\n\nSUMMARY.\n\nValue of buildings and equipment $ 35,000 Number of acres 1,275 Value of land $ 18,000 Number of patients 30 Attendants 10 Annual appropriation $ 7,750\n\nSUPERINTENDENT.\n\nDR. J. E. BROOKS term, two years.\n\nNORTH CAROLINA SCHOOL FOR THE FEEBLE-MINDED.\n\nIRA M. HARDY, M.D., Superintendent, Kinston.\n\nAccording to the Constitution of North Carolina, Article II, section 9, the North Carolina School for the Feeble-minded was authorized by an act of the General Assembly of 1911 by a State bond issue of $60,000 to begin the work.\n\nOn account of the limited amount of bonds issued, the trustees decided to ask communities to make bids for the location of said school. After a spirited contest between several communities the county of Lenoir, through a committee of seventeen of its representative citizens, raised a considerable amount of money and bought 847 acres of land and donated it to the school, together with free electric lights from the power plant at Kinston for a period of five years. The board of trustees later bought 49 acres of land, making a total of 895 acres of land. On this land there are a number of good farm buildings which can be used to good advantage by the institution. The value of the gift is not less than $25,000, which does not include a side-track 3,000 feet long, from the railroad to the powerhouse, which the Norfolk and Southern Railway Company donated; estimated cost of building $5,000; making a total valuation of the property donated $30,000.\n\nOn this property is flowing artesian water. The land is part of the old Richard Caswell grant, near where his remains lie, located a mile and a quarter from Kinston, on the Norfolk and Southern Railroad at Hines Junction, and on the Central Highway that leads from Beaufort to Waynesville.\n\nPage 164\n\nThe buildings are on a semi-circular plan, 2,000 feet from the highway, on a hill facing the south, the railroad, and the highway, and present a commanding appearance. There will be four substantial and permanent buildings in the first group. The main building will contain a dining-room, a matron's office, and eight sleeping rooms. The kitchen is located in the rear of this building and is connected to it by a covered walkway. There will be a dormitory on each side of the central building, one for boys and one for girls, to accommodate about sixty-five each.\n\nThe superintendent already has in hand six times as many applications for admission as the institution will accommodate. This institution takes a class that no other institution in the State cares for, namely, imbeciles, idiots, backward and feeble-minded children. This institution is a part of the State's great system of public education.\n\nOXFORD ORPHAN ASYLUM.\n\nR. L. BROWN, Superintendent, Oxford.\n\nIn the year 1872 the Oxford Orphan Asylum was established by the Grand Lodge of Ancient, Free and Accepted Order of Masons of North Carolina.\n\nIt was the first institution of its character established in the State and one of the first in the South.\n\nThis property was originally the old St. John's College, and was established in 1855 by the Grand Lodge of North Carolina for educational purposes. After being tried for a number of years and proving a failure financially, the Grand Lodge in 1872 decided to turn the property into a home for the orphan children of the State.\n\nThis was accomplished largely through the instrumentality of John H. Mills, who offered the resolution at the meeting of the Grand Lodge and worked for its adoption without very great encouragement. It was, therefore, quite fitting that he should have been chosen to be the first superintendent of the orphanage.\n\nThe purpose of the institution is to provide a temporary home and training school for the homeless boys and girls of the State.\n\nThe conditions of admission of the white children of North Caroline are: That they are really destitute and homeless; that they are of sound mind and body; and they are not under six years of age or over twelve.\n\nPage 165\n\nThe benefits of Oxford Orphan Asylum have never been restricted to the children of Masons alone. Only about one-eighth or 12Â½ per cent of its children had fathers who were Masons.\n\nAbout 2,850 children have received the care and training of the institution since 1872.\n\nThe institution is providing the necessities of life for these children, the opportunity to acquire an English education, industrial training in cottages, kitchen, sewing-room, laundry, shoeshop, printing office, telegraphy and typewriting, woodworking shop, dairy, and on farm. Each child is in school at least the half of each school day during the school term of nine months. Moral and religious instruction is prominent in the work.\n\nIn recognition of the services of the Oxford Orphan Asylum, its value to our Commonwealth in its work, the State of North Carolina appropriates $10,000 annually to aid in its maintenance and extension.\n\nAnnually a report of the operations of the institution is made to the Governor of the State and to the State Board of Public Charities.\n\nAt the request of the Grand Lodge of Masons, the State of North Carolina is represented by three members on the board of directors of the Orphanage. These are appointed by the Governor of the State.\n\nSUMMARY.\n\nFounded 1872 Number of buildings 24 Number of acres of land 242 Value of land, buildings, and equipment $150,000.00 Number of volumes in library 1,800 Number of children in institution (Sept. 1, 1912) 320 Number of officers and teachers 35 Annual income (State appropriation) $ 10,000.00 Annual income (other sources) 22,300.00 Annual per capita cost 83.60\n\nSUPERINTENDENTS.\n\nJ.

LINEBERRY, Superintendent, Raleigh.\n\nSo far as can be ascertained from the records on file in the office of the Soldiers' Home, a home for indigent Confederate soldiers was first established in a rented house at the corner of Polk and Blood-worth streets, in the city of Raleigh, and declared to be opened on October 15, 1890, with five inmates. W. C. Stronach, under the auspices of the Daughters of the Confederacy, acted as superintendent, and looked after the personal comforts of the men.\n\nThe General Assembly of 1891, chapter 60, Private Laws, incorporated Gen. Robert F. Hoke, Col. William L. Saunders, Col. A. B. Andrews, Capt. S. A. Ashe, Gen. Rufus Barringer, Gen. A. M. Scales, Gen. Robert B. Vance, Gen. Thomas L. Clingman, Gen. W. P. Roberts, Gen. Julian S. Carr, Capt. Thomas J. Jarvis, Col. W. P. Wood, Gen. Matt W. Ransom and other members of the Confederate Veterans' Association, under the name and style of \"The Soldiers' Home Association,\" and conferred upon this association the usual corporate powers. The act gave to the Soldiers' Home Association a tract of land near the eastern section of the city of Raleigh, known as Camp Russell, to be used for the purposes of a Soldiers' Home, and, if it should cease to be so used, to revert to and belong to the State. The same act appropriated $3,000 for the maintenance of the Soldiers' Home and the support of its inmates. Section 6 of the act is as follows:\n\n\"The directors shall cause to be kept a minute-book of the home, in which full entries shall be kept concerning memorable incidents in the lives of its inmates. They shall also take steps to form a museum of Confederate relics and to perpetuate such historical records of the Confederate soldiers of North Carolina as they shall find it practicable to do.\"\n\nThe act was ratified February 14, 1901.\n\nOn April 27, 1891, the number of inmates of the Soldiers' Home having increased to 9, they were removed to an old building at Camp Russell which had been fitted up for the purposes of the home. Miss Mary Williams was appointed matron and served in that capacity until February 15, 1893, when Capt. J. H. Fuller was made resident\n\nPage 167\n\nsuperintendent. On February 1, 1898, Superintendent Fuller resigned. Feebleness of age and the increase in number of inmates had made the duties too arduous for one of his strength.\n\nCapt. R. H. Brooks was elected to succeed Captain Fuller, and served until his death on June 14, 1910. The number of inmates continued to increase during his term, and the necessity for new and larger buildings became urgent. A dormitory was built to accommodate 70 inmates, and furnished by liberal donations from the Daughters of the Confederacy and others. A large hospital was built, medical attention given, nurses employed, water, sewerage, and electric lights provided and the grounds made attractive. Such heavy expense exceeded the appropriation made by the State, and at the close of Captain Brooks' term the books showed the home to be in arrears to the extent of $6,000; but all felt confident that the Legislature would provide for the deficiency.\n\nThe present superintendent, Capt. W. S. Lineberry, was elected to succeed Captain Brooks, and entered upon his duties July 20, 1910.\n\nAn appropriation of $30,000 was made by the Legislature of 1911 for the support of the home, and a further appropriation of $3,500 for the construction of an additional building of ten rooms, which has been completed and is now occupied. The home is now out of debt; the buildings bright with new paint; the grounds ornamented with trees and shrubbery, and the walks clean. The old comrades are, as a rule, contented. The fare is good, the rooms comfortable, the regulations reasonable, and an air of cheerfulness pervades. All this has come from the humble beginning of October, 1890.\n\nSUPERINTENDENTS.\n\nMISS MARY WILLIAMS 1891-1893. CAPT. J. H. FULLER 1893-1898. CAPT. R. H. BROOKS 1898-1910. CAPT. W. S.

Ashe for the historical data contained in this sketch.\n\nThe greatest of all enterprises so far attempted by the State of North Carolina in the nature of a public or internal improvement was the building of the North Carolina Railroad from Goldsboro by way of Raleigh, Greensboro and Salisbury, to Charlotte.\n\nConsidering the experimental state of railroading at that time, the dread of public or private indebtedness, and the limited resources, the movement was a monumental enterprise--and one in advance of anything attempted by almost any other State in the Union. The success, however, which has crowned the labors and sacrifices of our fathers has established beyond all question that their wisdom was equal to, or superior to, any displayed before or since their day.\n\nIn 1833, the Raleigh and Gaston Railroad Company and the Wilmington and Raleigh, afterwards known as the Wilmington and Weldon Railroad Company, were chartered, and later these roads were built. In 1848 the former was in the hands of the State, and was in a bankrupt condition for the want of patronage. It was necessary to give it some connection, or to extend it. At the session of November, 1848, the western counties urged a charter for a road from Charlotte to Danville, asking no State aid; but the eastern members opposed that project. The finances of the State were in such an impoverished condition that it was generally deemed impracticable for the State to give any considerable aid to any railroad; but William S. Ashe, the Democratic Senator from New Hanover, introduced a bill to construct a road from Goldsboro to Charlotte, under the name of the North Carolina Railroad, and appropriating two millions of dollars for that purpose, on condition, however, that private parties could subscribe one million, and to secure the payment of the State bonds when issued, a lien was given on the State's stock.\n\nWhen the western men brought up the Charlotte and Danville bill in the House, Stanley and other eastern men opposed it so bitterly that it could not pass, and then in a dramatic scene, the friends of internal improvement agreed to send to the Senate and take the Ashe bill from the files and offer it as a substitute. After a great and\n\nPage 172\n\nprolonged struggle the bill passed the House of Commons. In the Senate it failed by an adverse majority of one; but the Senator from Cumberland was led to support it by passing the bill for the State to build the plank road from Fayetteville to Salem; and then the vote in the Senate was a tie. Speaker Graves, who had up to that moment maintained an impenetrable silence as to the measure, broke the tie in favor of building the road by State aid; and the measure was passed. Speaker Graves was never again elected to any office by the vote of his people.\n\nTo secure the needed one million of private stock, Speaker Graves, Governor Morehead, and Mr. William Boylan made great exertions, and by their efforts, aided by Joseph Caldwell, Governor W. A. Graham, Paul C. Cameron, and others, the necessary stock was eventually raised. On January 29, 1856, the railroad was ready for passage of trains from Goldsboro to Charlotte, and charters had been granted for two other roads--from Goldsboro to Morehead City, and from Salisbury to the Tennessee line.\n\nBy act, ratified 14th of February, 1855, the General Assembly increased the capital stock to $4,000,000, and subscribed for the State the whole of the added capital. From that time till now the State has owned three-fourths, and individuals one-fourth of this road.\n\nThe first president of the company was Governor John M. Morehead, to whom so much was due for securing the subscription of the private stock, and under his direction the road was constructed. His successors were Charles F. Fisher, of Rowan; Paul C. Cameron, Josiah Turner, Jr., of Orange, and William A. Smith, of Johnston. During the administration of Mr. Smith the road was, on the 11th day of September, 1871, leased to the Richmond and Danville Railroad Company for thirty years, at a rental of 6 per cent per annum. The subsequent presidents of the company have been: Thomas M. Holt, Lee S. Overman, S. B. Alexander, J. F. Kornegay, R. M. Norment, J. L. Armstrong, H. G. Chatham, Charles M. Stedman, and Bennehan Cameron.\n\nOn the 16th day of August, 1895, in view of the approaching termination of the lease, the property was leased to the Southern Railway Company for a term of ninety-nine years, at an annual rental of 6Â½ per cent for six years and 7 per cent for the remaining ninety-three years, and the stock of the company was selling at $186 per share until the panic of 1907.\n\nPage 173\n\nOn the readjustment of the debt of the State, the State renewed the bonds issued for the purchase of the North Carolina Railroad stock, pledging the original lien on the stock for the payment of the debt.\n\nCol. Peter B. Ruffin, for more than thirty years, was the faithful and efficient secretary and treasurer of the company.\n\nThe secretaries of the company in the order of their election and service are as follows: Cyrus P. Mendenhall, Julius B. Ramsey, R. M. Mills, F. A. Stagg, J. A. McCauley, W. F. Thornburg, P. B. Ruffin, H. B. Worth, Spencer B. Adams, D. H. McLean, and A. H. Eller.\n\nThe State, as is well known, has continued to own its $3,000,000 of the original capital stock, and has acquired two (2) additional shares, thus giving it 30,002 shares at par value, amounting to $3,000,200, which, however, at the recent market value aggregates $5,580,372. And it is confidently believed that if the State desired to part with a controlling interest in the company, its stock would command a much greater price, and those who have watched the constant advance in the price of this stock expect it to go to $200 per share at an early day.\n\nUnder the lease of 1871 to the Richmond and Danville Railroad Company, the company could not have claimed the betterments made by the lessee; but under the present lease the company is not only amply secured by bond for the prompt payment of its lease money and organization expenses, to wit, $143,000 on the first day of January and July of each year, but upon the termination of said lease for any cause, the company acquires the betterments made thereon.\n\nIn addition to the railroad and rolling stock leased to the Southern Railway Company, the company still owns valuable lands in and about Company Shops, now known as the city of Burlington.\n\nWhen the Board of Directors, appointed by Governor Aycock, took charge of the company's affairs, there was a floating indebtedness of $10,000. The May balance, 1912, of the present secretary and treasurer shows that said indebtedness has been paid and a special dividend of Â½ of 1 per cent, amounting to $20,000, and the company has to its credit in the bank the sum of $21,128.64, all of which, except a small balance, is drawing 4 per cent interest. Again on August 1, 1912, an extra Â½ of 1 per cent dividend, amounting to $20,000 was paid. Promptly upon the payment of the lease money on the first of January\n\nPage 174\n\nand July in each year, the directors declare a dividend and the secretary and treasurer pays to the State Treasurer immediately $105,000, and like dividend is paid to the private stockholders on the first day of February and August of each year. The present Board of Directors, as appointed by Governor Kitchin on the part of the State, are given below. The State's proxy is Jo. M. Reese; the expert is John W. Thompson, and the company's attorney is Frank R. McNinch.\n\nA true sketch of this company would be incomplete without calling attention to the long and invaluable services of Gen. R. F. Hoke as director. His experience and great knowledge of affairs, and lifelong devotion to the best interest of the company, entitle him to the gratitude of the State, as well as the private stockholders. His death on July 3, 1912, was deeply and universally lamented.\n\nThe question is sometimes asked why the organization of the North Carolina Railroad Company is kept up, and what particular functions it performs.\n\nThis company, as some people think, does not belong to the State of North Carolina. It is a quasi-public corporation like all other railroad companies, in which the State owns three-fourths of the stock. It is managed practically as any private corporation would be managed, the principal difference being that the Governor has the appointment of eight of the directors, while the private stockholders have the election of four of the directors.\n\nThe organization is maintained for the purpose of enforcing the terms of the lease to the Southern Railway Company, and, in case of the termination of that lease for any cause, to resume the operation of the road.\n\nIt is required to see that the bonds given for the prompt payment of the rent, and also the bond to maintain the rolling stock in good condition, are kept in force. It receives the rent money of $280,000 per year, payable semiannually, and declares a dividend and pays the same to the stockholders of record. It transfers stock like other corporations.\n\nIn leasing its property to the Southern Railway Company it reserved its office building, which is the residence of the secretary and treasurer, containing its vault and records, at Burlington, N. C. It owns certain real estate in and about the city of Burlington, which is sold by its land committee from time to time.\n\nThe secretary and treasurer is required to give a bond in the sum of\n\nPage 175\n\n$50,000 and his books and accounts are audited by a finance committee at stated times. It is required to file a report annually with the State Corporation Commission and one with the Interstate Commerce Commission as other railroad companies must do. It also reports its income for Federal taxation like other corporations. Its stock is the most valuable holding that the State of North Carolina has amongst its assets, and whether it will be the policy of the State to hold its stock perpetually or to dispose of the same, is a matter for the legislatures of the future.\n\nOFFICERS OF THE COMPANY.\n\nPresidents--John M. Morehead, Guilford; Charles F. Fisher, Rowan; Paul C. Cameron, Orange; Josiah Turner, Jr., Orange; William A. Smith, Johnston; Thomas M. Holt, Alamance; Lee S. Overman, Rowan; S. B.

Elliott, T. S. Fleshman, J. W. Graham, S. C. Penn, C. C. Hargrove.\n\nElected by the Private Stockholders--Bennehan Cameron, W. E. Holt, Hugh McRae, and Alexander Webb.\n\nTHE ATLANTIC AND NORTH CAROLINA RAILROAD COMPANY.\n\nD. J. BROADHURST, Secretary and Treasurer, Goldsboro.\n\nThe Atlantic and North Carolina Railroad was chartered by the General Assembly of North Carolina in 1852, duration of the charter being ninety-nine years. The charter was amended in 1854 and 1855. Work on the railroad was begun shortly afterwards, and pushed to completion from Goldsboro to a point on the seacoast now known as Morehead City, a distance of 95 miles, in 1858.\n\nPage 176\n\nNot having the necessary data at hand, I state from memory, and from information gained from other sources, the names of the different presidents of the railroad company, in the order of their service from the beginning up to the time when the railroad was leased to the Howland Improvement Company, during the administration of Hon. C. B. Aycock as Governor of North Carolina, on September 1, 1904, as follows: John D. Whitford, Charles R. Thomas, John D. Whitford, E. R. Stanley, R. W. King, L. W. Humphrey, John Hughes, John D. Whitford, Washington Bryan, W. S. Chadwick, Robert Hancock, D. W. Patrick, James A. Bryan.\n\nThe road was capitalized at $1,800,000; the par value of the stock was fixed at $100 per share. The State of North Carolina owns 12,666 shares of the stock. The county of Craven owns 1,293 shares, the county of Lenoir owns 500 shares, the county of Pamlico owns 202 shares. The balance of the stock of the road is owned by private individuals. The equipment of the road was by no means complete when the War Between the States began, 1861, and by reason of the fact that a good portion of the road was under the control of the Federal arms from the fall of New Bern in 1862 to the close of the war in 1865, the road when turned over to its rightful owners was little more, if any, than a burden to carry, which was in part the cause of no returns to the stockholders on their investments for thirty-four years after the road was constructed. Prior to the lease of the road to the Howland Improvement Company dividends were declared on the capital stock as follows:\n\nSeptember, 1892 2 per cent. August, 1893 2 per cent. September, 1894 2 per cent. September, 1896 2 per cent. February, 1897 1 per cent. October, 1897 1 per cent. June, 1898 1 per cent. December, 1898 1 per cent. September, 1899 2 per cent.\n\nDuring the administration of the Hon. T. J. Jarvis, Governor of North Carolina, the railroad was leased to W. J. Best, who had control and operated same for a short time only, and then turned it back to its rightful owner.\n\nPage 177\n\nThere is an outstanding bonded indebtedness against the road of $325,000, bearing interest at 6 per cent per annum, the interest payable semiannually. Bonds for same were issued in 1887 and will mature in 1917. During the last year of the presidency of James A. Bryan, two suits were instituted in the Federal Court for the Eastern District of North Carolina for the appointment of receivers of the road--first by K. S. Finch of New York, and the second by John P. Cuyler of New Jersey. Receivers were appointed in both cases, but relief was granted by higher courts. Since the execution of the lease of the Atlantic and North Carolina Railroad to the Howland Improvement Company the following named gentlemen have served as president of the company in the order of their service, viz.: Jesse W. Grainger, Samuel W. Ferribee, and L. P. Tapp. Dividends on the capital stock since the execution of the lease have been declared as follows:\n\nDecember, 1904 1 per cent. August, 1905 1 Â½ per cent. February, 1906 1 per cent. July, 1906 1 Â½ per cent. February, 1907 1 Â¼ per cent. July, 1907 1 Â½ per cent. January, 1908 1 Â½ per cent. August, 1908 1 Â½ per cent. January, 1909 1 Â½ per cent. July, 1909 1 Â½ per cent. January, 1910 1 Â½ per cent. July, 1910 1 Â½ per cent. January, 1911 1 Â½ per cent. July, 1911 1 Â½ per cent. January, 1912 1 Â½ per cent. July, 1912 1 Â½ per cent.\n\nThe vast amount of unsettled business in which the Atlantic and North Carolina Railroad Company was in any way interested at the time the Howland Improvement Company, \"lessees,\" assumed control of the railroad, was very largely adjusted during the first two years. The expiration of the third year of the lease found only a small amount of difference to be looked after, which in time was settled. Suit was brought in the Superior Court of Craven County in 1906, to annual the lease to the Howland Improvement Company, resulting in a decision upholding the lease, which decision was affirmed by the Supreme Court.\n\nPage 178\n\nThe contract for lease with the Howland Improvement Company terminates in ninety-one years and four months from the date of its execution, and the stipulations contained in same have, up to the last meeting of the stockholders of the Atlantic and North Carolina Railroad Company, in 1912, been largely complied with, as will be seen from the annual reports to the stockholders' meeting of the president, treasurer, and expert of the lessor company. The Atlantic and North Carolina Railroad has, with some other short lines in Eastern North Carolina, been merged into and now forms part of the Norfolk Southern Railway system.\n\nTHE NORTH CAROLINA AGRICULTURAL SOCIETY.\n\nJOSEPH E. POGUE, Secretary, Raleigh.\n\nThe North Carolina Agricultural Society, which operates the State Fair annually at Raleigh in the third week of October, was chartered by special act of the Legislature more than a half century ago, \"to provide a place for the holding of annual fairs, in order that the citizens may be encouraged by exhibitions, premiums, and other means to develop and improve the productions of agriculture, and every species of native industry; and to this end, and for these great and valuable purposes, and to no other, shall the corporation apply all the funds which by any means it may acquire.\"\n\nNo capital stock was provided for in that charter. Various public-spirited citizens of the State loaned to the society a sum of money sufficient to purchase grounds and erect buildings for the purposes of an annual fair, taking therefor the bonds of the society. The real property, pledged to secure this bonded debt, is held in trust. The bonded debt was originally $26,500, but was reduced in 1905 to $22,600, and refunded for twenty years at 5 per cent, instead of 6 per cent, the former rate. These bonds are now generally held at par value.\n\nAny profits made in the operation of the fair go into a surplus fund, which is spent in permanent improvements of all kinds at the fair grounds, for increased premiums, and other betterments that go toward making the fair more and more complete.\n\nPage 179\n\nThe present fair grounds are just west of the city of Raleigh, at the terminus of the electric street-car line. They were purchased about thirty-six years ago, and cover more than 60 acres of land, in one of the most desirable sections of Raleigh's suburbs. The society has a number of large buildings on these grounds, some of which were erected at the time this site was acquired. The others have been put up within the last few years.\n\nThe new grandstand was built a half dozen years ago with a seating capacity of about 2,000. This is a very substantial structure, with a metal roof, and is now in excellent condition. Last year its seating capacity was considerably enlarged by the addition of bleachers reaching from the front of the stand down almost to the racetrack fence, and extending almost the width of the grandstand.\n\nSeveral years ago a shed, covered with a metal roof, 48 Ã 200 feet, was put up for the accommodation of the exhibitors of large farm machinery. It proved a great boon to these exhibitors, and is much appreciated by the general public.\n\nIn 1910 a modern reinforced concrete building, 60 Ã 150 feet, was erected especially for the use of exhibitors of agricultural and horticultural products. This is a very handsome addition to the equipment of the grounds, being up-to-date in its appearance, and well arranged and convenient in its appointments.\n\nThe following year another building of the same size, also of modern fireproof construction, was built for the housing of poultry. It harmonizes perfectly as to architecture with the agricultural building just spoken of, and in its arrangement and lighting facilities offers all the advantages which the best experience of years has brought into use in such buildings.\n\nAmong other recent improvements might be mentioned the widening three times of the midway within the last dozen years, to afford room for the ever-increasing crowds, and the macadamizing of this thoroughfare; the overhauling, and remodeling of the Arts and Crafts building, known as Floral Hall; the addition of about one hundred new box stalls for the accommodation of exhibit and race horses; the wiring of the buildings for electric lights; the extension of the city water pipes into the grounds, and the consequent providing of running water throughout.\n\nPage 180\n\nThe auditing committee of the society, in their report last year, took occasion to state that after a brief but comprehensive review of the expenditures on the fair grounds since January, 1900, they found that the present management had paid out, in round figures, nearly $30,000 for permanent improvements. In this connection the auditing committee also found that during that period about $13,000 had been paid out for past-due coupons, bonds paid and canceled, unpaid debts, and premiums due from former fairs.\n\nAltogether, it may be said in the most conservative terms that the fair has grown from modest beginnings, until in recent years, just as the Old North State is taking her proper place among the foremost Commonwealths of the Union, her State Fair is taking rank with the leading institutions of its kind in the country. Moreover, it has been gaining more and more the enthusiastic support, coÃ¶peration, and advice of men in all industries of the State, a thing that is absolutely necessary for the making of a larger and a greater fair.\n\nIt is the intention of the management to continue to put up new permanent buildings as fast as the profits from the fairs will permit, or the public policy of the State towards her agricultural and industrial interests as expressed at the State Fair will make possible, finally replacing all of the old wooden structures with buildings that are adapted to the rapidly increasing needs of the more and more representative exhibits that are year by year demanding in tones less and less mistakable larger and better accommodations.\n\nSome definite idea of the tremendous growth of the fair during the last few years may be gathered from the fact that in one year the number of solid car-loads of exhibits jumped from 42 to 83, and the number of separate entries from 1,201 in 1909 went to 3,501 in 1910, and 4,136 in 1911.\n\nAs to attendance, no other occasion in North Carolina draws anything like the throngs that visit the \"Great State Fair\" at the Capital City each year. The railroads for years have been putting on special rates and extra trains to handle the crowds.\n\nKeeping pace with the most modern methods of stimulating the efforts to produce better and better crops of all kinds, the management during the last few years has instituted the corn contest feature for boys, cotton contests for men and boys, the tomato contest for girls, and still more and larger prizes for county and individual exhibits and agricultural products.\n\nPage 181\n\nThe list of great National live-stock associations offering their special premiums at the State Fair keeps growing longer as the years go by, and in the case of one of the most prominent of these associations the North Carolina State Fair is honored among only four Southern fairs. It is thus apparent that the State Fair is recognized as one of the greatest gathering points for pure-bred live stock in the South.\n\nFor years the management has been working away from the big midway and little exhibit condition of a fair back to the fundamental purpose of its existence, the competition of the best to make better, until the executive committee, upon the recommendation of the secretary, resolved unanimously that all questionable shows and doubtful games be absolutely forbidden in the grounds, and so gave a clear field to the best shows in the country offering legitimate amusement as well as educational features, and reached far toward the final rung of the climax, the ideal State Fair, which shall be the meeting place of agriculture and industry, a delightful outing for all the members of the family, a summer school for the men and women and boys and girls, the best short course in agriculture in the State, a great industrial exchange, a university of experience and experiment, an annual advertisement of the greatness of a great State.\n\nTHE NORTH CAROLINA STATE CAPITOL.\n\nOn the morning of June 21, 1831, the State Capitol of North Carolina was destroyed by fire. Though the public records of the State were saved, the State Library, containing many valuable books and manuscripts, was lost.\n\nThe citizens of Raleigh naturally bemoaned the destruction of the building, but Governor Stokes did not regard it as a great loss. In his opinion there were some mitigating circumstances. In his message to the General Assembly, when it met the following November, he said that the calamity was not so great, because the old Statehouse, built in 1794, was almost ready to tumble down of its own accord, and that perhaps many valuable lives had been saved by its being destroyed by fire instead of tumbling down on the Legislature while in session.\n\nPage 182\n\nAt once Senator Seawell, of Wake, brought forward a bill providing for the erection of a new Capitol on the site of the old one. At the same time a similar bill was introduced in the House of Commons. As there was a strong sentiment in the State favorable to the removal of the capital from Raleigh to Fayetteville, these two bills to rebuild at Raleigh met with vigorous opposition. Accordingly Senator Seawell's bill was quickly disposed of. Senator Wilson, of Edgecombe, moved to table it, and it was tabled. The House bill was longer discussed. The discussion was prolonged for two days, but on a yea and nay vote the bill failed, 65 to 68. The Assembly of 1831 refused to rebuild.\n\nA year passed, and the ruins of the old Statehouse still marked the site of the former Capitol. But the Constitution, or rather the Ordinance, of 1789 located the capital at Raleigh, and the Legislature had no power to move it. It was even questioned with great seriousness whether the Assembly could hold its sessions in the Governor's Mansion, at the end of Fayetteville Street, as that was outside of the limits of the town. To move the capital a convention was necessary, and a majority of the Legislature was not favorable to a convention.\n\nAt the session of November, 1832, the Assembly, by a vote of 35 to 28 in the Senate and 73 to 60 in the House, resolved to rebuild on the old site, and $50,000 was appropriated for the purpose.\n\nWilliam Boylan, Duncan Cameron, Henry Seawell, Romulus M. Saunders and William S. Mhoon were appointed commissioners to have the work done. The commissioners, with $50,000 at their command, did not dally. The rubbish was cleared away, the excavations made and the foundations were laid. On July 4, 1833, the cornerstone was set in place. Up to that time W. S. Drummond was the superintendent and chief architect, and he was one of the principal persons in the ceremony of laying the corner-stone.\n\nAfter the foundations were laid the work progressed more slowly, and it was so expensive that the appropriation was exhausted. The Legislature at its next session appropriated $75,000 more. To do the stone and finer work, many skilled artisans had been brought from Scotland and other countries. Part of the work was conducted under the supervision of W. S. Drummond and another part under Colonel Thomas Bragg, but these arrangements did not prove satisfactory,\n\nPage 183\n\nand a year later, in September, 1834, Mr. I. Theil Town, of New York, acting for the commissioners, contracted with David Paton to come to Raleigh and superintend the work.\n\nMr. Paton was an architect who had come from Scotland the year before. He was then thirty-three years of age. He was the son of John Paton, of Edinburgh, who was an extensive builder in that city and vicinity and who had built the greater part of the new town and constructed the famous Dean Bridge across the water of Leith, and he ranked high in his profession. Having received a liberal education at the University of Edinburgh, David Paton took up the profession of his father and was regularly bred as an architect and builder under his father and under Sir John Sloan, R. A., professor of architecture to the Royal Academy of London. He soon demonstrated his capacity. When he first came to Raleigh the cost of overseeing the work on the Capitol was $25 a day. He reduced that cost to $9. Twenty-eight stonecutters were paid $81 a day. This he reduced to $56. He made a saving in these two items alone of $42 a day. He found himself to be not merely the supervisor of the work, but the superintendent; not merely the superintendent, but the book-keeper and paymaster. He had every detail of the work on his shoulders. And, then, he had to make the working drawings. He was the builder, the architect, the designer.\n\nBoth the commissioners and the architect had large ideas. The former were wise enough to expend the original $50,000, which the General Assembly expected would complete the structure, on its foundation. Their work being severely criticised, they resigned, January 1, 1835. Their successors were: Beverly Daniel, chairman, Samuel F. Patterson, Charles Manly, and Alfred Jones. The Legislature was compelled to make appropriations for the work, from time to time. The following is a table of the several appropriations made:\n\nSession of 1832-33 $ 50,000.00 Session of 1833-34 75,000.00 Session of 1834-35 75,000.00 Session of 1835 75,000.00 Session of 1836-37 120,000.00 Session of 1838-39 105,300.00 Session of 1840-41 31,374.46 Total $531,674.46\n\nPage 184\n\nIt must be remembered that the stone with which the building was erected was the property of the State. Had the State been compelled to purchase this material, the cost of the Capitol would have been considerably increased.\n\nThe following is a description of the Capitol, written by David Paton, the architect:\n\n\"The State Capitol is 160 feet in length from north to south by 140 feet from east to west. The whole height is 97Â½ feet in the center. The apex of pediment is 64 feet in height. The stylobate is 18 feet in height. The columns of the east and west porticoes are 5 feet 2Â½ inches in diameter. An entablature, including blocking course, is continued around the building, 12 feet high.\n\n\"The columns and entablature are Grecian Doric, and copied from the Temple of Minerva, commonly called the Parthenon, which was erected in Athens about 500 years before Christ. An octagon tower surrounds the rotunda, which is ornamented with Grecian cornices, etc., and its dome is decorated at top with a similar ornament to that of the Choragic Monument of Lysicrates, commonly called the Lanthorn of Demosthenes.\n\n\"The interior of the Capitol is divided into three stories: First, the lower story, consisting of ten rooms, eight of which are appropriated as offices to the Governor, Secretary, Treasurer, and Comptroller, each having two rooms of the same size--the one containing an area of 649 square feet, the other 528 square feet--the two committee rooms, each containing 200 square feet, and four closets; also, the rotunda, corridors, vestibules, and piazzas, contain an area of 4,370 square feet. The vestibules are decorated with columns and antÃ¦, similar to those of the Ionic Temple on the Ilissus, near the Acropolis of Athens. The remainder is groined with stone and brick, springing from columns and pilasters of the Roman Doric.\n\n\"The second story consists of Senatorial and Representatives' chambers, the former containing an area of 2,545 and the latter 2,849 square feet. Four apartments enter from Senate Chamber, two of which contain each an area of 169 square feet, and the other two contain each an area of 154 square feet; also, two rooms enter from Representatives' chamber, each containing an area of 170 square feet; of two committee rooms, each containing an area of 231 feet; of four presses and the passages, stairs, lobbies, and colonnades, containing an area of 3,204 square feet.\n\nPage 185\n\n\"The lobbies and Hall of Representatives have their columns and antÃ¦ of the Octagon Tower of Andronicus Cyrrhestes, and the plan of the hall is of the formation of the Greek theater and the columns and antÃ¦ in the Senatorial chamber and rotunda are of the Temple of Erectheus, Minerva Polias, and Pandrosus, in the Acropolis of Athens, near the above-named Parthenon.\n\n\"Third, or attic story, consists of rooms appropriated to the Supreme Court and Library, each containing an area of 693 square feet. Galleries of both houses have an area of 1,300 square feet; also, two apartments entering from Senate gallery, each 169 square feet, of four presses and the lobbies' stairs, 988 square feet. These lobbies, as well as rotunda, are lit with cupolas, and it is proposed to finish the Court and Library in the florid Gothic style.\"\n\nIn the summer of 1840 the work was finished. The Assembly had, in December, 1832, appropriated $50,000 for the building. Mr. Boylan, Judge Cameron and State Treasurer Mhoon and their associates spent that sum in the foundation. They proposed to have a Capitol worthy of the State. At every subsequent session the Assembly made additional appropriations. There was some caviling, and the commissioners resigned; but the Legislature and the new commissioners took no step backwards. Year by year they pressed on the work as it had been begun, until at last, after more than seven years, the sum of $531,674.46 was expended. As large as that sum was for the time, when the State was so poor and when the entire taxes for all State purposes reached less than $100,000, yet the people were satisfied. The building had been erected with rigorous economy, and it was an object of great pride to the people. Indeed, never was money better expended than in the erection of this noble Capitol.\n\nSpeaking of this structure, Samuel A. Ashe, in an address on David Paton, delivered in 1909, says:\n\n\"Not seventy years have passed since the completion of this building, yet it has undying memories. It was finished the year Henry Clay was set aside and his place as the Whig leader given to General Harrison. Four years later Clay spoke from the western portico; but, like Webster and Calhoun, the prize of the presidency was denied him. The voices of other men of large mould also have been heard within this Capitol. Here, too, our great jurists--Gaston, Ruffin, Pearson and their associates--held their sessions and brought\n\nPage 186\n\nrenown to North Carolina. Here Badger, Mangum. Dobbin, and scores of men known to fame held high debates. Here was brought forth in great travail our system of internal improvements, and of education, ramifying the State, disseminating enlightenment and opening the pathways to prosperous, contented and happy homes for our people.\n\n\"Here Ellis and Clark and the mighty Vance directed the affairs of State in the trying days of war and suffering and desolation, the glories mingled with pain and sorrow, and fading away in heart-rending defeat; but through it all the women and men, alike heroes, worthy the poets' loftiest strains. Then, when the people were still bowed in anguish, Carolinians turned their faces to the future, and, with resolution and intelligence, themselves modified their laws and institutions to meet the new conditions; but in vain, for these mute walls are witnesses of the saturnalia of Reconstruction still awaiting some Dante to portray the scenes with realistic power. Yet the dark cloud had its silver lining, and the courageous devotion of Jarvis, John Graham and their Spartan band adds historic interest to that time of fearful storm.\n\n\"Later, here was the scene of the great State trial, the impeachment of the Chief Magistrate of the Commonwealth and the contest between the intellectual giants of that generation, Governor Graham and Bragg and Merrimon, contesting with Smith and Coningland and Richard Badger.\n\n\"And these walls have witnessed the reversal of that State policy forced on an unwilling people by the mailed hand of the conquering power, and the full restoration of Anglo-Saxon control. Never in history has a people been so clearly and effectually vindicated as those gallant souls of North Carolina, who, emulating the constancy of Hamilcar, swore their children to undying opposition to those who would destroy their civilization. Let the oppressed of future ages gaze on the scene and take courage. Already hallowed are the memories that these chambers evoke. What grand occasions yet await them! We may not lift the veil of the future, but experience warms us that history constantly repeats itself, and as the web woven by destiny unrolls itself there will yet occur within these enduring walls occasions of surpassing magnitude affecting the weal and woe of our posterity.\"\n\nPage 187\n\nTHE NORTH CAROLINA STATE BUILDING COMMISSION.\n\nWILLIAM E. SPRINGER, Secretary, Wilmington.\n\nMindful of the fact that only a little more than a generation ago the State Capitol of North Carolina was destroyed by fire, entailing the loss of many valuable records and papers, for some years prior to the convening of the 1911 session of the General Assembly the demand had been insistent for a safer housing of several departments of the State Government at Raleigh, notably the books and records of the North Carolina Historical Commission, which has now grown to be one of the most important branches of work at the seat of government.\n\nEarly in the session a movement was started for the building of a State administration building at the capital, and after numerous conferences and compromises of differences as to the amount that should be appropriated for that purpose, a bill was at length unanimously passed by both houses, appropriating the sum of $250,000 for this purpose and conferring upon the Governor the appointment of a State Building Commission for the consummation of this worthy undertaking. Soon after the adjournment of the Legislature Governor W. W. Kitchin named as the members of the Commission, Ashley Horne of Clayton, William E. Springer of Wilmington, Julian S. Carr of Durham, W. L. Parsons of Rockingham, A. S. Rascoe of Windsor, J. A. Long of Roxboro, and J. Elwood Cox of High Point, men of affairs and recognized business ability in the State.\n\nThe State Building Commission held its first meeting in the office of the State Auditor at 12:30 P. M., May 9, 1911, and organized by the election of Ashley Horne of Clayton as chairman, and William E. Springer of Wilmington as secretary. Following organization, a conference was held with the Board of Public Buildings and Grounds, composed of the Governor, Secretary of State, Treasurer, and Attorney-General. It was stated as the purpose of the General Assembly to provide ample room for the Supreme Court, all valuable State records, the State Library, offices for the Attorney-General, and several of the other State departments. The grounds were carefully gone over, the situation canvassed, and a subcommittee composed of Chairman Horne, Secretary Springer, and Commissioner Cox, was appointed to go further into the matter of a building and site.\n\nPage 188\n\nAt a subsequent meeting, on May 19, 1911, the committee reported that it had secured an option on three sites, and recommended the purchase of the Grimes tract for $45,000. This recommendation was accepted by the Commission as a whole, and on June 6, 1911, plans as prepared by P. Thornton Marye, of Atlanta, were accepted after hearing a number of others and after several conferences. These plans were later reviewed by Glenn Brown, of Washington, D. C., another expert in building construction, and were declared eminently proper and in order in every respect. The plans call for a modern fireproof building four stories in height and admirably adapted to the purpose to which it will be put.\n\nOn November 1, 1911, the Commission met again in Raleigh, after proposals had been invited for the building, and after considering a number of bids for the construction, the contract was at length awarded to the John T. Wilson Company, of Richmond, Va., at a cost of $188,000, the building to be completed and ready for occupancy by January 19, 1913.\n\nHow well the State Building Commission has wrought is attested by the splendid building which now stands opposite the Capitol grounds and which will be occupied by the several departments of government as agreed upon after the numerous conferences of the Commission since the building has been under way.\n\nNORTH CAROLINA DAY.\n\nThe following act, entitled \"An Act to Provide for the Celebration of North Carolina Day in the Public Schools,\" is chapter 164 of the Public Laws of 1901:\n\nThe General Assembly of North Carolina do enact:\n\nSECTION 1. That the 12th day of October in each and every year, to be called \"North Carolina Day,\" may be devoted, by appropriate exercises in the public schools of the State, to the consideration of some topic or topics of our State history, to be selected by the Superintendent of Public Instruction: Provided, that if the said day shall fall on Saturday or Sunday, then the celebration shall occur on the Monday next following: Provided further, that if the said day shall fall at a time when any such schools may not be in session, the celebration\n\nPage 189\n\nmay be held within one month from the beginning of the term, unless the Superintendent of Public Instruction shall designate some other time.\n\nSEC. 2. This act shall be in force from and after its ratification.\n\nIn the General Assembly read three times, and ratified this the 9th day of February, A. D. 1901.\n\nOctober 12th, the date selected for North Carolina Day, is the anniversary of the laying of the corner-stone of the University of North Carolina, October 12, 1793. In accordance with the provisions of this act, the Superintendent of Public Instruction has had prepared and distributed to the schools of the State each year a program of exercises devoted to the study of some phase of North Carolina history.\n\nSince the creation of North Carolina Day the following subjects have been studied each year (back numbers of the programs can be secured from the State Superintendent of Public Instruction, Raleigh, N. C.):\n\n1901. The Roanoke Island Colonies. Prepared by Fred. A. Olds.\n\n1902. The Albemarle Section. Prepared by a Committee.\n\n1903. The Lower Cape Fear Section. Prepared by R. D. W. Connor.\n\n1904. The Pamlico-Neuse Section. Prepared by Charles L. Coon.\n\n1905. The Scotch Highlanders in North Carolina. Prepared by R. D. W. Connor.\n\n1906. Charles D. McIver Memorial Day.

Connor.\n\nPage 190\n\nCONSTITUTION OF THE STATE OF NORTH CAROLINA.\n\nPREAMBLE.\n\nWe, the people of the State of North Carolina, grateful to Almighty God, the Sovereign Ruler of Nations, for the preservation of the American Union, and the existence of our civil, political and religious liberties, and acknowledging our dependence upon Him for the continuance of those blessings to us and our posterity, do for the more certain security thereof, and for the better government of this State, ordain and establish this Constitution:\n\nARTICLE I.\n\nDECLARATION OF RIGHTS.\n\nThat the great, general and essential principles of liberty and free government may be recognized and established, and that the relations of this State to the Union and Government of the United States, and those of the people of this State to the rest of the American people, may be defined and affirmed, we do declare:\n\nSECTION 1. That we hold it to be self-evident that all men are created equal; that they are endowed by their Creator with certain inalienable rights; that among these are life, liberty, the enjoyment of the fruits of their own labor, and the pursuit of happiness.\n\nSEC. 2. That all political power is vested in, and derived from, the people; all government of right originates from the people, is founded upon their will only, and is instituted solely for the good of the whole.\n\nSEC. 3. That the people of this State have the inherent, sole, and exclusive right of regulating the internal government and police thereof, and of altering and abolishing their Constitution and form of government whenever it may be necessary for their safety and happiness; but every such right should be exercised in pursuance of law, and consistently with the Constitution of the United States.\n\nSEC. 4. That this State shall ever remain a member of the American Union; that the people thereof are a part of the American Nation; that there is no right on the part of the State to secede, and\n\nPage 191\n\nthat all attempts, from whatever source or upon whatever pretext, to dissolve said Union, or to sever said Nation, ought to be resisted with the whole power of the State.\n\nSEC. 5. That every citizen of this State owes paramount allegiance to the Constitution and Government of the United States, and that no law or ordinance of the State in contravention or subversion thereof can have any binding force.\n\nSEC. 6. The State shall never assume or pay, or authorize the collection of any debt or obligation, express or implied, incurred in aid of insurrection or rebellion against the United States, or any claim for the loss or emancipation of any slave; nor shall the General Assembly assume or pay, or authorize the collection of any tax to pay, either directly or indirectly, expressed or implied, any debt or bond incurred, or issued, by authority of the Convention of the year one thousand eight hundred and sixty-eight, nor any debt or bond incurred or issued by the Legislature of the year one thousand eight hundred and sixty-eight, at its special session of the year one thousand eight hundred and sixty-eight, or at its regular sessions of the years one thousand eight hundred and sixty-eight and one thousand eight hundred and sixty-nine and one thousand eight hundred and seventy, except the bonds issued to fund the interest on the old debt of the State, unless the proposing to pay the same shall have first been submitted to the people and by them ratified by the vote of a majority of all the qualified voters of the State, at a regular election held for that purpose.\n\nSEC. 7. No man or set of men are entitled to exclusive or separate emoluments or privileges from the community but in consideration of public services.\n\nSEC. 8. The legislative, executive and supreme judicial powers of the government ought to be forever separate and distinct from each other.\n\nSEC. 9. All power of suspending laws, or the execution of laws, by any authority, without the consent of the representatives of the people, is injurious to their rights, and ought not to be exercised.\n\nSEC. 10. All elections ought to be free.\n\nSEC. 11. In all criminal prosecutions, every man has the right to be informed of the accusation against him and to confront the accusers and witnesses with other testimony, and to have counsel for\n\nPage 192\n\nhis defense, and not to be compelled to give evidence against himself or to pay costs, jail fees, or necessary witness fees of the defense, unless found guilty.\n\nSEC. 12. No person shall be put to answer any criminal charge, except as hereinafter allowed, but by indictment, presentment, or impeachment.\n\nSEC. 13. No person shall be convicted of any crime but by the unanimous verdict of a jury of good and lawful men in open court. The Legislature may, however, provide other means of trial for petty misdemeanors, with the right of appeal.\n\nSEC. 14. Excessive bail should not be required, nor excessive fines imposed, nor cruel or unusual punishments inflicted.\n\nSEC. 15. General warrants, whereby any officer or messenger may be commanded to search suspected places, without evidence of the act committed, or to seize any person or persons not named, whose offense is not particularly described and supported by evidence, are dangerous to liberty and ought not to be granted.\n\nSEC. 16. There shall be no imprisonment for debt in this State, except in cases of fraud.\n\nSEC. 17. No person ought to be taken, imprisoned, or disseized of his freehold, liberties or privileges, or outlawed or exiled, or in any manner deprived of his life, liberty or property, but by the law of the land.\n\nSEC. 18. Every person restrained of his liberty is entitled to a remedy to inquire into the lawfulness thereof, and to remove the same, if unlawful; and such remedy ought not to be denied or delayed.\n\nSEC. 19. In all controversies at law respecting property, the ancient mode of trial by jury is one of the best securities of the rights of the people, and ought to remain sacred and inviolable.\n\nSEC. 20. The freedom of the press is one of the great bulwarks of liberty, and therefore ought never to be restrained, but every individual shall be held responsible for the abuse of the same.\n\nSEC. 21. The privileges of the writ of habeas corpus shall not be suspended.\n\nSEC. 22. As political rights and privileges are not dependent upon, or modified by, property, therefore no property qualification ought to affect the right to vote or hold office.\n\nPage 193\n\nSEC. 23. The people of the State ought not to be taxed, or made subject to the payment of any impost or duty, without the consent of themselves, or their representatives in General Assembly, freely given.\n\nSEC. 24. A well-regulated militia being necessary to the security of a free State, the right of the people to keep and bear arms shall not be infringed; and, as standing armies in time of peace are dangerous to liberty, they ought not to be kept up, and the military should be kept under strict subordination to, and governed by, the civil power. Nothing herein contained shall justify the practice of carrying concealed weapons, or prevent the Legislature from enacting penal statutes against said practice.\n\nSEC. 25. The people have a right to assemble together to consult for their common good, to instruct their representatives, and to apply to the Legislature for redress of grievances. But secret political societies are dangerous to the liberties of a free people, and should not be tolerated.\n\nSEC. 26. All men have a natural and inalienable right to worship Almighty God according to the dictates of their own consciences, and no human authority should, in any case whatever, control or interfere with the rights of conscience.\n\nSEC. 27. The people have the right to the privilege of education, and it is the duty of the State to guard and maintain that right.\n\nSEC. 28. For redress of grievances, and for amending and strengthening the laws, elections should be often held.\n\nSEC. 29. A frequent recurrence to fundamental principles is absolutely necessary to preserve the blessings of liberty.\n\nSEC. 30. No hereditary emoluments, privileges or honors ought to be granted or conferred in this State.\n\nSEC. 31. Perpetuities and monopolies are contrary to the genius of a free State, and ought not to be allowed.\n\nSEC. 32. Retrospective laws, punishing acts committed before the existence of such laws, and by them only declared criminal, are oppressive, unjust and incompatible with liberty; wherefore no ex post facto law ought to be made. No law taxing retrospectively sales, purchases, or other acts previously done, ought to be passed.\n\nSEC. 33. Slavery and involuntary servitude, otherwise than for crime, whereof the parties shall have been duly convicted, shall be and are hereby forever prohibited within the State.\n\nPage 194\n\nSEC. 34. The limits and boundaries of the State shall be and remain as they now are.\n\nSEC. 35. All courts shall be open; and every person for an injury done him in his lands, goods, person or reputation, shall have remedy by due course of law, and right and justice administered without sale, denial or delay.\n\nSEC. 36. No soldier shall, in time of peace, be quartered in any house without the consent of the owner; nor in time of war but in a manner prescribed by the law.\n\nSEC. 37. This enumeration of rights shall not be construed to impair or deny others retained by the people; and all powers not herein delegated remain with the people.\n\nARTICLE II.\n\nLEGISLATIVE DEPARTMENT.\n\nSECTION 1. The legislative authority shall be vested in two distinct branches, both dependent on the people, to wit, a Senate and House of Representatives.\n\nSEC. 2. The Senate and House of Representatives shall meet biennially on the first Wednesday after the first Monday in January next after their election; and, when assembled, shall be denominated the General Assembly. Neither house shall proceed upon public business unless a majority of all the members are actually present.\n\nSEC. 3. The Senate shall be composed of fifty Senators, biennially chosen by ballot.\n\nSEC. 4. The Senate Districts shall be so altered by the General Assembly, at the first session after the return of every enumeration by order of Congress, that each Senate District shall contain, as near as may be, an equal number of inhabitants, excluding aliens and Indians not taxed, and shall remain unaltered until the return of another enumeration, and shall at all times consist of contiguous territory; and no county shall be divided in the formation of a Senate District, unless such county shall be equitably entitled to two or more Senators.\n\nSEC. 5. The House of Representatives shall be composed of one hundred and twenty Representatives, biennially chosen by ballot, to be elected by the counties respectively, according to their population, and each county shall have at least one representative in the House\n\nPage 195\n\nof Representatives, although it may not contain the requisite ratio of representation. This apportionment shall be made by the General Assembly at the respective times and periods when the Districts of the Senate are hereinbefore directed to be laid off.\n\nSEC. 6. In making the apportionment in the House of Representatives, the ratio of representation shall be ascertained by dividing the amount of the population of the State, exclusive of that comprehended within those counties which do not severally contain the one hundred and twentieth part of the population of the State, by the number of Representatives, less the number assigned to such counties; and in ascertaining the number of the population of the State, aliens and Indians not taxed shall not be included. To each county containing the said ratio and not twice the said ratio, there shall be assigned one Representative; to each county containing two but not three times the said ratio, there shall be assigned two Representatives, and so on progressively, and then the remaining Representatives shall be assigned severally to the counties having the largest fractions.\n\nSEC. 7. Each member of the Senate shall no be less than twenty-five years of age, shall have resided in the State as a citizen two years, and shall have usually resided in the district for which he is chosen one year immediately preceding his election.\n\nSEC. 8. Each member of the House of Representatives shall be a qualified elector of the State, and shall have resided in the county for which he is chosen for one year immediately preceding his election.\n\nSEC. 9. In the election of all officers whose appointment shall be conferred upon the General Assembly by the Constitution, the vote shall be viva voce.\n\nSEC. 10. The General Assembly shall have the power to pass general laws regulating divorce and alimony, but shall not have power to grant a divorce or secure alimony in any individual case.\n\nSEC. 11. The General Assembly shall not have power to pass any private law to alter the name of any person, or to legitimate any person not born in lawful wedlock, or to restore to the rights of citizenship any person convicted of an infamous crime, but shall have power to pass general laws regulating the same.\n\nPage 196\n\nSEC. 12. The General Assembly shall not pass any private law, unless it shall be made to appear that thirty days' notice of application to pass such a law shall have been given, under such direction and in such manner as shall be provided by law.\n\nSEC. 13. If vacancies shall occur in the General Assembly by death, resignation or otherwise, writs of election shall be issued by the Governor under such regulations as may be prescribed by law.\n\nSEC. 14. No law shall be passed to raise money on the credit of the State, or to pledge the faith of the State, directly or indirectly, for the payment of any debt, or to impose any tax upon the people of the State, or allow the counties, cities or towns to do so, unless the bill for the purpose shall have been read three several times in each house of the General Assembly and passed three several readings, which readings shall have been on three different days, and agreed to by each house, respectively, and unless the yeas and nays on the second and third readings of the bill shall have been entered on the journal.\n\nSEC. 15. The General Assembly shall regulate entails in such manner as to prevent perpetuities.\n\nSEC. 16. Each house shall keep a journal of its proceedings, which shall be printed and made public immediately after the adjournment of the General Assembly.\n\nSEC. 17. Any member of either house may dissent from and protest against any act or resolve which he may think injurious to the public, or any individual, and have the reasons of his dissent entered on the journal.\n\nSEC. 18. The House of Representatives shall choose their own Speaker and other officers.\n\nSEC. 19. The Lieutenant Governor shall preside in the Senate, but shall have no note unless it may be equally divided.\n\nSEC. 20. The Senate shall choose its other officers and also a Speaker (pro tempore) in the absence of the Lieutenant Governor, or when he shall exercise the office of Governor.\n\nSEC. 21. The style of the acts shall be: \"The General Assembly of North Carolina do enact.\"\n\nSEC. 22. Each house shall be judge of the qualifications and election of its own members, shall sit upon its own adjournment from day to day, prepare bills to be passed into laws; and the two houses may also jointly adjourn to any future day or other place.\n\nPage 197\n\nSEC. 23. All bills and resolutions of a legislative nature shall be read three times in each house before they pass into laws, and shall be signed by the presiding officers of both houses.\n\nSEC. 24. Each member of the General Assembly, before taking his seat, shall take an oath or affirmation that he will support the Constitution and laws of the United States, and the Constitution of the State of North Carolina, and will faithfully discharge his duty as a member of the Senate or House of Representatives.\n\nSEC. 25. The terms of office for Senators and members of the House of Representatives shall commence at the time of their election.\n\nSEC. 26. Upon motion made and seconded in either house by one-fifth of the members present, the yeas and nays upon any question shall be taken and entered upon the journals.\n\nSEC. 27. The election for members of the General Assembly shall be held for the respective districts and counties, at the places were they are now held, or may be directed hereafter to be held, in such manner as may be prescribed by law, on the first Thursday in August, in the year one thousand eight hundred and seventy, and every two years thereafter. But the General Assembly may change the time of holding the elections.\n\nSEC. 28. The members of the General Assembly for the term for which they have been elected shall receive as compensation for their services the sum of four dollars per day for each day of their session, for a period not exceeding sixty days; and should they remain longer in session they shall serve without compensation. They shall also be entitled to receive ten cents per mile, both while coming to the seat of government and while returning home, the said distance to be computed by the nearest line or route of public travel. The compensation of the presiding officers of the two houses shall be six dollars per day and mileage. Should an extra session of the General Assembly be called, the members and presiding officers shall receive a like rate of compensation for a period not exceeding twenty days.\n\nARTICLE III.\n\nEXECUTIVE DEPARTMENT.\n\nSECTION 1. The Executive Department shall consist of a Governor, in whom shall be vested the supreme executive power of the State; a Lieutenant Governor, a Secretary of State, an Auditor, a Treasurer,\n\nPage 198\n\na Superintendent of Public Instruction, and an Attorney-General, who shall be elected for a term of four years by the qualified electors of the State, at the same time and places and in the same manner as members of the General Assembly are elected. Their term of office shall commence on the first day of January next after their election, and continue until their successors are elected and qualified: Provided, that the officers first elected shall assume the duties of their office ten days after the approval of this Constitution by the Congress of the United States, and shall hold their offices four years from and after the first day of January.\n\nSEC. 2. No person shall be eligible as Governor or Lieutenant Governor unless he shall have attained the age of thirty years, shall have been a citizen of the United States five years, and shall have been a resident of this State for two years next before the election; nor shall the person elected to either of these two offices be eligible to the same office more than four years in any term of eight years, unless the office shall have been cast upon him as Lieutenant Governor or President of the Senate.\n\nSEC. 3. The return of every election for officers of the Executive Department shall be sealed up and transmitted to the seat of government by the returning officers, directed to the Speaker of the House of Representatives, who shall open and publish the same in the presence of a majority of the members of both houses of the General Assembly. The person having the highest number of votes respectively shall be declared duly elected; but if two or more be equal and highest in votes for the same office, the one of them shall be chosen by joint ballot of both houses of the General Assembly. Contested elections shall be determined by a joint ballot of both houses of the General Assembly in such manner as shall be prescribed by law.\n\nSEC. 4. The Governor, before entering upon the duties of his office, shall, in the presence of the members of both branches of the General Assembly, or before any Justice of the Supreme Court, take an oath or affirmation that he will support the Constitution and laws of the United States, and of the State of North Carolina, and that he will faithfully perform the duties appertaining to the office of Governor, to which he has been elected.\n\nSEC. 5. The Governor shall reside at the seat of government of this State, and he shall, from time to time, give the General Assembly\n\nPage 199\n\ninformation of the affairs of the State, and recommend to their consideration such measures as he shall deem expedient.\n\nSEC. 6. The Governor shall have power to grant reprieves, commutations, and pardons, after conviction, for all offenses (except in cases of impeachment), upon such conditions as he may think proper, subject to such regulations as may be provided by law relative to the manner of applying for pardons. He shall biennially communicate to the General Assembly each case of reprieve, commutation, or pardon granted, stating the name of each convict, the crime for which he was convicted, the sentence and its date, the date of the commutation, pardon, or reprieve and the reasons therefor.\n\nSEC. 7. The officers of the Executive Department and of the public institutions of the State shall, at least five days previous to each regular session of the General Assembly, severally report to the Governor, who shall transmit such reports with his message to the General Assembly; and the Governor may, at any time, require information in writing from the officers in the Executive Department upon any subject relating to the duties of their respective offices, and shall take care that the laws be faithfully executed.\n\nSEC. 8. The Governor shall be Commander in Chief of the militia of the State, except when they shall be called into the service of the United States.\n\nSEC. 9. The Governor shall have power, on extraordinary occasion, by and with the advice of the Council of State, to convene the General Assembly in extra session by his proclamation, stating therein the purpose or purposes for which they are thus convened.\n\nSEC. 10. The Governor shall nominate and, by and with the advice and consent of a majority of the Senators-elect, appoint all officers whose offices are established by this Constitution and whose appointments are not otherwise provided for.\n\nSEC. 11. The Lieutenant Governor shall be President of the Senate, but shall have no vote unless the Senate be equally divided. He shall, whilst acting as President of the Senate, receive for his services the same pay which shall, for the same period, be allowed to the Speaker of the House of Representatives; and he shall receive no other compensation except when he is acting as Governor.\n\nSEC. 12. In case of the impeachment of the Governor, his failure to qualify, his absence from the State, his inability to discharge the\n\nPage 200\n\nduties of his office, or, in case the office of Governor shall in anywise become vacant, the powers, duties and emoluments of the office shall devolve upon the Lieutenant Governor until the disability shall cease or a new Governor shall be elected and qualified. In every case in which the Lieutenant Governor shall be unable to preside over the Senate, the Senators shall elect one of their own number President of their body; and the powers, duties and emoluments of the office of Governor shall devolve upon him whenever the Lieutenant Governor shall, for any reason, be prevented from discharging the duties of such office as above provided, and he shall continue as acting Governor until the disabilities are removed, or a new Governor or Lieutenant Governor shall be elected and qualified.
