Third floor of the downtown Raleigh landmark was destroyed. Smoke and water extensively damaged the rest of the three-story, brick building. The building was built in 1921 by Calvin E. Lightner, father of Raleigh City Councilman Clarence Lightner. It was occupied by a number of businesses, including offices and stores: Cheap Johns clothing store, Peebles Cafeteria, Peebles Hotel Grill, Peebles Cleaners, and the Sweet Pea Green Record Store. There was a ballroom on the third floor. There were about twenty guests staying at the hotel. The fire started in a third-floor bathroom. Hundreds of spectators--estimated by the News & Observer as 500--watched quietly from behind a police cordon, as burning tar on the room billowed black smoke into the air, and often obscuring their view. Flames \"flashed about 20 feet high and smoke curled several hundred feet over the state capital,\" reported the News & Observer.\n\nNoted the Raleigh Times, \"the four pumpers, at full blast, poured out about 4,000 gallons of water a minute.\" And \"asked if his men were able to pour enough water on the blaze, Fire Chief Jack Keeter said 'No problems. We filled the basement with water.'\" At 8:56 p.m. and 10:02 p.m., additional firemen were dispatched to the scene, to relieve the crews already there. The fire was brought under control about 8:00 p.m., and the last truck left the scene at 12:35 p.m. Other than \"routine cuts and scrapes\" to the firemen, said the Times, no injuries were reported. The bulk of the damage was confined to the third floor, and the roof was a total loss. Said the newspaper, \"streams of water aimed upward through third floor windows could be seen arching into the air over the building.\"\n\nCrews also used the roof of Mamlin Drugs, beside the fire building and separated by a narrow alley, to fight the fire. As the blaze in the main building was being brought under control, noted the Times, a two-story addition in the rear of the hotel caught fire. Crews worked from a parking lot full of spectators, and brought that part of the fire under control, and prevented a spread to the second floor of the main building. Manager Victor Peebles declared the building a total loss. Kimbrell's Furniture Store, across the street, received some smoke damage on the top two floors of the building. The fire department recorded a loss of $110,220. E3, E1, T1, R1, E10, E5 at 1, T6, T7, E5, E4 at 1, T5 relief, E4 relief.

Fire was reported at 12:29 p.m. by police call. The half-acre fire consumed a pile of tires and several stacks of junked cars. Three large oil storage tanks were threatened, when fire spread under them, and caused a leak into a nearby pond. The heavy clouds of black smoke was caused by the intensely burning pile of tires, which burned for nearly 45 minutes. The main building was not damaged. One fireman was overcome with heat and treated on scene. E3, E1, E2, E5 at 1, E10, E7. [UF] (July 20, 1970)rt, no21jul70\n\nFirefighter residency requirements reviewed. This occurred after city policies were debated, after it was discovered that fire inspector Johnnie Turner had moved outside of Wake County. He appealed to City Council and the Civil Service Commission, was unsuccessful, and was fired for not conforming to the rules. He took the city to court and an order was signed reinstating Turner as suspended without pay, until the case was settled. A survey conducted by the city personnel department finds Raleigh's residency rules were more restrictive than four of the other five major cities in the state. Charlotte, Durham, and Greensboro have no rules, while Winston-Salem allows firemen to live anywhere in the county. Raleigh requires that firemen live in Wake County, be on a paved road, and have a Raleigh telephone. The only city more restrictive was High Point, which requires within Guilford County and within one mile of the city limits. The survey was made for the Law and Finance Committee, which was studying the existing rules. The City Council recently upheld the disputed rules by a four to three vote, but the committee looks into the rules at the request of a Councilman. They also survey Richmond, which has no requirements, and Columbia, SC, which requires residency within fifteen miles of the state. They also note that residency comparisons for policemen were more difficult to compare. Fire Chief Jack Keeter has since discovered at least two other firemen living outside the county, but won't take action until the rules were settled. [No changes were apparently made, as Turner's last date of employment was October 1, 1970.) (September 1970)rt1_sep70\n\nNorth Valley Apartments at 4343 Lassiter Mill Road burned. Fire was reported 12:46 p.m. by telephone. Three units were extensively damaged. One fireman cut \"his hand and shoulder\" and was treated and released at Rex Hospital. \"The fire was believed to have started in the attic over the building's corner apartment, where two young women were living.\" The apartment office was also heavily damaged. \"The blaze then spread to two more second-floor apartments.\" The fire was \"reported by a tenant who was taking a shower and looked up to seek the ceiling on fire.\" Loss $28,750.

One-story masonry structure, in a separate building from the motel. About 30 firefighters battled the blaze, which was brought under control about 1:30 p.m. Fire started around a grease duct in the kitchen, and spread from the ceiling back, and gutted the back of the building. At 1:23 p.m., a second alarm was requested, and Engine 9 responded. A few minutes later, a third alarm was requested. By 1:45 p.m., some of the companies were cleared from the scene. Loss $60,000.

Smoke spread over the highway and caused a \"near-monumental traffic jam.\" Some 35 firefighters battled the blaze, which was reported as a brush fire at 3:38 p.m. Upon arrival, \"the whole building was one fire\" said Fire Chief Jack Keeter. Crews were still on scene at 10:30 p.m., loading equipment. They were hampered by sub-freezing temperatures that caused ice to form on hoses and other equipment. The fire occurred in the same area as a blaze that burned the kitchen and restaurant of the Holiday Inn on US.1 north, earlier that afternoon. [MF] (December 7, 1970)rfd, no08dec70\n\n1971\n\nAlarm boxes discontinued. City Manager W. H. Carper recommended to City Council that pull boxes be replaced with a system of telephone call boxes. He noted that 84 percent of fire alarms from call boxes in 1970 were false, versus only three percent of calls by telephone. In a report to council, he noted that the system would be owned by the phone company, and leased to the city. Installation cost to the city would be $14,235, and annual rental for 414 units would be $103,320. The council refers the report to its Law and Finance Committee. The report noted that the percentage of false alarms from pull boxes had grown from 70 percent in 1965, to its 84 percent figure first reached in 1967. It dropped to 82 percent in 1968. Each call box would have a direct phone line to fire headquarters, and would provide a record and voice recording of all calls. The system would save time, the report notes. Also, the present pull box system needs an expansion and upgrade that would cost $127,000. The annual operating cost would be $44,000. Each false alarm costs the city $200 to $300, noted the Fire Chief, and that doesn't count the possibility of collisions involving the fire trucks while en route. The city has 314 pull boxes, and the proposal would replace those with telephone boxes, and add an additional 100 units. The proposal called for financial out of the present city budget, and becoming operational on July 1, 1972. City Council approved the recommendation on January 25, 1971. (January 1971)rt18jan71, rt26jan71\n\nFire Chief Jack Keeter recommended volunteer fire departments for supplementing the fire protection of a proposed annexation area in west Raleigh. The 3,494-acre annexation area extends along Highway 70 west, and includes the Brookhaven neighborhood, which opposed the plan. The Chief's plans call for \"volunteer and regular city crews to answer each alarm\" reports the Raleigh Times on January 26, 1971. All the fire calls already come into the fire department's central communications center. \"We just punch a button and their siren goes off. And we'd send a [Raleigh] pumper and service ladder truck to each of the calls from that area.\" He adds, \"They're equipped just like we are. We may put some small equipment--some hose, maybe--out there. It would be just the same as putting an extra station out there.\" Three volunteer departments currently service the area slated for annexation: Fairgrounds, Durham Highway, and Six Forks. The Chief said he'd need the help of FFD and DHFD, who cover the bulk of the area. The city has had similar arrangements in the past. At the time of the 1960 annexations, the city contracted with Six Forks FD for $350 a month, to answer newly annexed areas in north Raleigh. On the west side, however, the city activated a temporary fire station in a rented house until a permanent one was built.\" Both DHFD and SFFD receive 10 cents per hundred dollars of tax value on property in their service area. The city would probably pay the departments a monthly fee equal to what they'd lose in revenues from the annexation. Most of Brookhaven, however, already received protection, contracted by the city, and for which residents pay a special 40 cent tax levy. The city plans the eventual construction of a fire station in that area. (January 1971)rt26jan71\n\nAndrew Johnson Hotel Annex at 100 Martin Street burns. Two+ alarms. Fire reported 12:22 a.m. Firefighters rescued one person by ladder. Elderly resident died, his charred body removed from the third floor approximately 90 minutes into the incident. Twelve rooms of the Annex, facing Martin Street, were occupied at time of fire. Hotel was separated from the rear of the N&O building by an alley. Firefighters \"poured water onto the blazing roof from two aerial ladders\" and several \"climbed atop the News & Observer's loading platform roof to direct more streams of water into the third floor rooms.\" The \" temperature clock\" on the bank building across the street \"registered 27 degrees\" and some of the water flowing into the street \"was turning to ice.\" Cigarette cited as cause of fire, from smoking in bed.

The article also noted that Station 10 on Sanderford Road was \"near completion.\" The $1.5 million figure includes only \"land acquisition, construction planning, and major equipment costs. No figure was given for personnel or operating costs.\" One major recommendation was that sites be purchased \"as much as two years ahead to reduce land acquisition costs.\" The proposed timetable:\n\n1970-1971\n\nStation serving North Ridge and Brentwood.\n\nStation serving Lake Boone Trail and Blue Ridge Road.\n\n1971-1972\n\nStation in area of Blue Ridge Road and Highway 70.\n\n1972-1973\n\nStation at Poole and Williams Road.\n\n$120,000 classroom and training facility on S.

City Council voted in December 1978 to create the rank as an incident promotion for firefighters, and over the objections of City Manager L. P.

The position was created as a promotion between Firefighter I, the entry-level position, and Firefighter II, or engine-driver. Promotion to First Class would result in an automatic five-percent salary increase. Council members argued that the position was needed because of the number of firefighters who quit at rank of Firefighter I, and because a similar position exists in the Police Department. The new rank carried no special duties beyond those of Firefighter I, except that First Class Firefighters could serve as substitute drivers, when drivers were absent. The Raleigh Fire Fighters Association had also been pressing for the new rank in recent years. In March 1979, City Council killed a proposal to link the promotion to Emergency Medical Technician certification. The proposal was made by the City Manager.
