Conceived in 1921, built by private citizens, and completed in 1937, today the trail is managed by the National Park Service, US Forest Service, Appalachian Trail Conservancy, numerous state agencies and thousands of volunteers.\n\nParkway\n\nBlue Ridge\n\nBlue Ridge Mountains of Virginia and North Carolina, NC,VA\n\nA Blue Ridge Parkway experience is unlike any other: a slow-paced and relaxing drive revealing stunning long-range vistas and close-up views of the rugged mountains and pastoral landscapes of the Appalachian Highlands. The Parkway meanders for 469 miles, protecting a diversity of plants and animals, and providing opportunities for enjoying all that makes this region of the country so special.\n\nNational Seashore\n\nCape Hatteras\n\nNags Head, Buxton, Ocracoke, NC\n\nThe sound of ocean waves, the starry night sky, or the calm of the salt marshes, you can experience it all. Shaped by the forces of water, wind, and storms these islands are ever changing. The plants, wildlife, and people who live here adapt continually. Whether you are enjoying the beach, kayaking the sound, or climbing the Cape Hatteras Lighthouse there is something for everyone to explore!\n\nNational Seashore\n\nCape Lookout\n\nHarkers Island, NC\n\nA boat ride three miles off-shore brings you to the barrier islands of Cape Lookout National Seashore. Horse watching, shelling, fishing, birding, camping, lighthouse climbing, and touring historic villages--there’s something for everyone at Cape Lookout. Be sure to bring all the food, water, and supplies you need (and carry your trash out of the park) when visiting these remote beaches.\n\nNational Historic Site\n\nCarl Sandburg Home\n\nFlat Rock, NC\n\n“I make it clear why I write as I do and why other poets write as they do. After hundreds of experiments I decided to go my own way in style and see what would happen.” Carl Sandburg's free verse style of poetry, journalism, biography, children's stories, prose writing, and social activism provided a popular voice for the American people of the twentieth century.\n\nNational Historic Site\n\nFort Raleigh\n\nManteo, NC\n\nAmongst the shallow blue waters of the Outer Banks lies Fort Raleigh on Roanoke Island. Shaped by constant winds of change, Fort Raleigh has become a focal point of American history. From the first Algonquian-speaking people to the first English colonies, from formerly enslaved people starting anew to an inventor testing new radio technology, this island continues to be a place to forge new paths.\n\nNational Park\n\nGreat Smoky Mountains\n\nthe states of NC,TN\n\nRidge upon ridge of forest straddles the border between North Carolina and Tennessee in Great Smoky Mountains National Park. World renowned for its diversity of plant and animal life, the beauty of its ancient mountains, and the quality of its remnants of Southern Appalachian mountain culture, this is America's most visited national park. Plan your visit today!\n\nNational Military Park\n\nGuilford Courthouse\n\nGreensboro, NC\n\n\"I never saw such fighting since God made me. The Americans fought like demons.\" - Lt. General Charles, Earl Cornwallis On March 15, 1781, six years into the American Revolution, General Greene and Lord Cornwallis' troops faced off at a small courthouse community. The battle would change the course of the Southern Campaign of the American Revolution.\n\nNational Battlefield\n\nMoores Creek\n\nCurrie, NC\n\nIn the early morning hours of February 27, 1776, Loyalist forces charged across a partially dismantled Moores Creek Bridge. Beyond the bridge, nearly 1,000 North Carolina Patriots waited quietly with cannons and muskets poised to fire. This battle marked the last broadsword charge by Scottish Highlanders and the first significant victory for the Patriots in the American Revolution.\n\nNational Historic Trail\n\nOvermountain Victory\n\nNC,SC,TN,VA\n\nStretching 330-miles through four states (Virginia, Tennessee, North and South Carolina) the Overmountain Victory National Historic Trail traces the route used by Patriot militia during the pivotal Kings Mountain campaign of 1780. Follow the campaign by utilizing a Commemorative Motor Route which uses existing state highways marked with the distinctive trail logo, or 87 miles of walkable trails.\n\nNational Historic Trail\n\nTrail Of Tears\n\nAL,AR,GA,IL,KY,MO,NC,OK,TN\n\nRemember and commemorate the survival of the Cherokee people, forcefully removed from their homelands in Georgia, Alabama, and Tennessee to live in Indian Territory, now Oklahoma. They traveled by foot, horse, wagon, or steamboat in 1838-1839.\n\nNational Memorial\n\nWright Brothers\n\nKill Devil Hills, NC\n\nWind, sand, and a dream of flight brought Wilbur and Orville Wright to Kitty Hawk, North Carolina where, after four years of scientific experimentation, they achieved the first successful airplane flights on December 17, 1903. With courage and perseverance, these self-taught engineers relied on teamwork and application of the scientific process. What they achieved changed our world forever."
