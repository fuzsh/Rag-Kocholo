The plan of the work divides the information contained in the book into three parts: The first pages are devoted to the miscellaneous information, consisting of lists of city and county officers, church directory, secret and benevolent societies, schools, State government, post-office information, the police and tire departments, and many other useful items; this is followed by the Directory proper, showing the names, occupation and addresses of all of the residents of the city, and the whole is supplemented by a complete classified Business Directory, containing the names and addresses of all persons engaged in business, or the professions arranged under the headings to which they properly b3long. This information has been compiled and collected by competent and experienced persons, and we have spared neither time nor expense to make the work as complete and reliable as possible.\n\nWe desire to return our thanks to the business men and citizens who have favored us with their patronage, and who have so cheerfully given all information requested of them.\n\n^TuLY,JL889.____ ____M.

Provided with an ample faculty and with extensive means of illustration, its courses of study are fully up to all the requirements of modern thought.\n\nThe scientific departments are equipped with apparatus necessary for investigation, so that students can become familiar with the manipulation of instruments and do practical work. The equipments of the engineering, of the physical and of the chemical departments are especially complete. In Geology and Biology, the apparatus, while, however, sufficient for illustration, needs additions, which it is hoped, will soon be made. For students studying Agriculture there is connected with the University a good farm of sixty acres in charge of Dr. W. L. Jones, which is well equipped and arranged for field experiments.\n\nTuition in the University is free, board can be had from $13.50 per month to $18 the former being in the college boarding house, the last in private families. The college boarding house has lately been entirely renovated, and is now an exceedingly comfortable building. It is in charge of Rev. J. R. Stillwell, and substantial fare is furnished the students.\n\nThe library consists of some 17,000 volumes, and the leading magazines and newspapers are found on its tables. It is open all day, and students have access to it at all hours, to read, study or consult references. It is in charge of Miss Frierson, arid rigid order is observed, so that a student can always expect in the room the silence and order necessary for study. Religious exercises are held every morning in the\n\nS.
