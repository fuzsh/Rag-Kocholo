Much like the western side of the 400-500 block of McMannen St., the eastern side developed with a first generation of ~1870s-1880s houses (most likely) of which many were supplanted by larger dwellings during the 1890s-1910s. Some of the earlier dwellings persisted on the east side into the 1960s

511 S. Mangum - certainly one of the earlier generation.

511 S. Mangum appears to have been MA Angier's house from at least 1881; it first appears in the city directories as 135 McMannen, then 317 McMannen, then 511 McMannen. Angier was "Member of the General Assembly of the State, Mayor of Durham, Chairman of the Commissioners of the County, and Justice of the Peace for fifty years" per the historical marker outside the old County Courthouse. He ran the original general store in Durham, on the "Angier Corner" - Mangum and Main. He died 12.30.1900

In 1903-1904 the house was occupied by Edward L. Fleming, Maudant Fleming, May Fleming, and Zana Fleming. By 1915, it appears to be occupied by Charles Amis, a manager at the CD Kenney store, and Rufus Amis, a clerk at the Durham Hosiery Mill.
