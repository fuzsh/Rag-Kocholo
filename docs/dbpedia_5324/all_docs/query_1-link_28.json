Applications are available here and can be returned to 0108 Symons Hall or e-mailed to jsull@umd.edu.\n\nAdmission will be based on grades, background and work experience as well as evidence of the motivation and maturity necessary for the successful completion of the program. Admission will also be contingent upon the availability of a faculty adviser.\n\nIn addition to the academic and research experiences, all students enrolled in departmental honors are members of the University Honors Program and as such, may register for Honors courses and seminars offered through the program. Other benefits include eligibility for Honors scholarships, Honors housing, and participation in all Honors student activities and organizations.\n\nThe student who successfully completes the honors requirements and all other degree requirements while maintaining a cumulative GPA of 3.2 or above will graduate with \"Honors\"; while a student completing the above with a GPA of 3.6 or above will graduate with \"High Honors\".\n\nThe AGNR Honors Program requires a major commitment of time and effort. We encourage qualified students willing to make this commitment to apply.\n\nInterested students may direct questions or inquiries to the AGNR Associate Dean for Academic Programs at jsull@umd.edu."
