        "text": "Today, I posted about her sisters Estelle and Rosanna, so you may have guessed I would share information about my cousin, Emmy Award winning actress Esther Rolle for Black History Month. You may think you know her, but here are a few tidbits beyond her role as Florida Evans on Good Times, and a few photos you may not have ever seen. Esther Rolle is a first generation Bahamian-American, born in 1920 in Pompano Beach, Florida. She was the tenth of 18 children (including fellow actresses Estelle Evans and Rosanna Carter). She studied at Spelman College, Hunter College, and The New School. She graduated from Yale University. She was a member of Zeta Phi Beta Sorority, Incl She was a member of Asadata Dafora's dance troupe, Shogolo Oloba (later renamed the Federal Theater African Dance Troupe). She became the troupe's director in 1960. Esther’s earliest roles were on the stage; her New York stage debut was in the 1962 play The Blacks. Her most prominent early role was as Miss Maybell in the 1973 Melvin Van Peebles play, Don't Play Us Cheap. In 1977, She portrayed Lady Macbeth in Orson Welles' Haitian-influenced version of William Shakespeare's Macbeth at the Henry Street New Federal Theater in Manhattan. In 1979 she won an Emmy for her role in Summer of My German Soldier, a made-for-television movie. Esther released an album of music titled The Garden of My Mind in 1975. Her first screen appearance is a small, uncredited role in To Kill a Mockingbird (1962), and she later appeared in Gordon Parks' The Learning Tree (1969). Esther Rolle appeared early in her career in the film Nothing But a Man (1964). After Good Times ended, she appeared in a number of made-for-television movies and films, including Driving Miss Daisy and My Fellow Americans. A memorable role was that of Aunt Sarah in the film Rosewood (1997). She had a major role in I Know Why the Caged Bird Sings based on Maya Angelou's memoir of the same name, and has the distinction of having won the first Emmy Award for the category Outstanding Supporting Actress in a Miniseries or Movie, in 1979, for her work in the television movie Summer of My German Soldier. She was also in the film The Mighty Quinn (1989), starring Denzel Washington and Sheryl Lee Ralph, and featuring Robert Townsend. Her last film, Train Ride, was released in 2000 (filmed before her death in 1998). Her only marriage was to Oscar Robinson. The two were married from 1955 to 1975. She had no children. Esther died on November 17, 1998, in Culver City, California, from diabetes at age 78. Her funeral was at Bethel African Methodist Episcopal Church. Her final resting place is Westview Community Cemetery in Pompano Beach, Florida, a historically black burial ground created in 1952, a time when the laws did not permit white people and black people to be buried in the same cemetery. The family donated over 100 items of hers to the African-American Research Library and Cultural Center in Fort Lauderdale, Florida."
