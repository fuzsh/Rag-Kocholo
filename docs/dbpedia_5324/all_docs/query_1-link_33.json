To say thank you for your generosity, all Senior Signature donors will be recognized on the Senior Signature plaque in Tate Plaza.\n\nCONTINUE THE TRADITIONS\n\nMany of the resources and events you’ve experienced as a student were made possible by previous senior gifts. Through Senior Signature, you’ll give the gift of tradition to your peers for years to come.\n\nSUPPPORT THE CLASS GIFT\n\nThe Class Gift is a giving initiative coordinated by the Student Alumni Council that empowers each graduating class to make their mark on UGA. Each time a donor gives to Senior Signature, a portion of that donation supports the Class Gift—a grant that UGA student organizations can apply for. Each year’s Senior Signature donors vote to determine which group receives the funding.\n\nProposals for the 2025-2026 academic year will open November 1, 2024 and close February 28, 2025. The proposal form will become available here on November 1."
