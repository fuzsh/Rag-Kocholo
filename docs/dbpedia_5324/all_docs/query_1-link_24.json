        "text": "Sallie Baldwin Howard never let her present circumstances define her future. Instead, she rose above them.\n\nThat’s the powerful message Sallie B. Howard School of Arts and Science students will bring to the stage at 6 p.m. Wednesday in the school’s auditorium. The school’s chorus, gospel choir and theater students will perform a special showcase in honor of Howard, the school’s namesake, in celebration of Black History Month.\n\nCommunity members can attend the free performance and learn about the history of a woman who was the daughter of a sharecropper and became a lifelong educator and world traveler who studied under some of the greatest Black actors in history. Howard also championed opportunities for children to pursue their education and make a difference in the world around them.\n\n“The history of her life was amazing and very inspirational for Black history,” said Diana Torres, the school’s dean of arts, who wrote the play script. “It’s a story of resilience and victory. She was a pioneer in so many ways.”\n\nA question-and-answer session with Sallie B. Howard School founder and Executive Director JoAnne Woodard will follow the performance.\n\nStudents debuted the theatrical and musical tribute at the N.C. Museum of History’s 22nd annual African American Cultural Celebration in January.\n\n“I invite the community to come and see who she was and what she did,” Torres said.\n\nThe Sallie B. Howard School chorus will perform under the direction of Mavis Poole, and the school’s gospel choir will perform under the direction of Jeremy Herring.\n\nAN IMPORTANT JOURNEY\n\nHoward was born in 1916 in Wilson. She was the daughter of a sharecropper, and despite the many struggles and obstacles she faced, Howard excelled. She was valedictorian of her class at Darden High School, Torres said.\n\n“She goes on to stay in New York City to study,” Torres said.\n\nHoward was part of Harlem’s famous American Negro Theater, where she trained and performed with world-renowned performers like Esther Rolle, Sidney Poitier, Isabella Sanford, Harry Belafonte and Ruby Dee.\n\nHoward graduated from Hunter College and received bachelor and master’s degrees in elementary education. Torres said Howard was the first Black teacher in Queens, New York, too.\n\n“That’s really important because it led her to who she is today, and her leading this school entirely,” High school junior Tilaya Lyons said.\n\nTilaya portrays Howard in the play’s lead role.\n\n“For her to have that experience in the school before this was even thought of, I feel like that’s the most important in her journey,” she said.\n\nWhen Howard returned to Wilson, she continued her life’s passion of educating children. Howard died in 2018 at the age of 102.\n\nIN HER OWN WORDS\n\nTorres said the play is documentary theater. She wrote the script by pulling from Howard’s own writings, conversations and interviews. To prepare for the role, Tilaya watched footage of Howard and interviews to get a sense of how she spoke and the presence she had.\n\n“It’s really big role to play,” the 16-year-old said. “She has this big energy, big spirit every time she comes into a room.”\n\nTilaya also studied Howard’s writings. There are excerpts of the play that focus on Howard’s own words.\n\n“We need to remember her history, and for that to be able to happen, we have to be able to tell her story,” Tilaya said. “Even though she’s not here, we can have her life and her spirit still told throughout this performance.”\n\nTilaya said she met Howard the first year she started at the school when she was 11 years old.\n\n“She never missed a performance,” Tilaya said with a smile.\n\nTilaya said she was a novice when it came to acting at that time. But Howard personally told her that she stood out.\n\n“It meant so much,” she said. “I still carry that today.”\n\n‘SOMEONE WHO MADE A DIFFERENCE’\n\nTorres said she hopes to expand on the play in the future, too. She said the play is a compilation of the heart of Howard’s vision and how she wanted students to feel about themselves as they propelled themselves forward.\n\n“Your future does not depend on your circumstances,” Torres said. “It’s incredible the things that she accomplished. We never take the time to learn about our own community, our own figures, our own heroes. This is local. This is someone who made a difference in so many lives in our community. The life of this woman is fascinating.”"
