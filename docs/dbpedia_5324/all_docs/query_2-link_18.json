        "text": "Jennifer Coolidge is a versatile character actress and experimental comedienne, best known for playing Stifler's mom in American Pie: Wie ein heißer Apfelkuchen (1999).\n\nShe was born on August 28, 1961, in Boston, Massachusetts, USA, to Gretchen (Knauff) and Paul Constant Coolidge, a plastics manufacturer. Young Coolidge was dreaming of becoming a singer. She attended Norwell High School and Emerson College in Boston, Massachusetts, and earned her bachelor's degree in theatre in 1985. She moved to New York and joined the Gotham City improv group. Then, she headed to Los Angeles where she became a long-running member of \"The Groundlings\" comedy troupe. Coolidge made her television debut in a guest role on NBC's Seinfeld (1989), playing a voluptuous masseuse who won't offer her professional services to boyfriend Jerry in a 1993 episode. The following year, she had a regular gig on ABC's short-lived sketch series She TV (1994), then briefly became a cast member and writer on another short-lived sketch comedy series, Fox's Saturday Night Special (1996) produced by Roseanne Barr.\n\nCoolidge made her big screen debut as a nurse in Not of This Earth (1995), then in the courtroom comedy Noch dümmer (1997). Then, she appeared in small roles in several more feature films, and also continued her television work. Coolidge had her breakthrough role in American Pie: Wie ein heißer Apfelkuchen (1999), as a boozed-up and sultry mom who seduces her son's classmate with the comment that she liked her scotch and men the same way: aged 18 years. She recreated the character in the sequel American Pie 2 (2001). Then, she reprized her role as \"Paulette\" opposite Reese Witherspoon in the \"Legally Blonde\" franchise. Although, she lost the part of \"Lynette Scavo\" on Desperate Housewives (2004) to Felicity Huffman, Coolidge graced several TV comedies as well, with major guest appearances on Frasier (1993) and Sex and the City (1998). Then, she landed a recurring role in the ABC sitcom Joey (2004), as \"Bobbie Morgenstern\", Joey's agent, appearing in 37 episodes over two seasons.\n\nEventually, Coolidge emerged as a versatile character actress with her no-holds-barred approach to comedy and her vanity-free comfort with playing uninhibited, unappealing characters, and delivering lines with sexual innuendo. Her talent shines in a range of characters, from a gold-digging dog owner in Best in Show (2000), to a scheming wife of an elderly mogul in Einmal Himmel und zurück (2001), to an opportunistic mother in American Dreamz - Alles nur Show (2006). Coolidge's gift for altering her appearance and manner, as well as her mastery of timing, shines in her perfectly hideous performance as \"Fiona\", a wicked stepmother in Cinderella Story (2004) opposite Hilary Duff, for which Coolidge won a 2005 Teen Choice Award. Her lasting collaboration with director Christopher Guest continues in Es lebe Hollywood (2006).\n\nShe has been sharing her time between her two homes, one is in Hollywood, California, and one in New Orleans, where she bought a historic mansion before the Hurricane Katrina hit the city, and then became involved in its restoration.\n\nLaura Dern was born on February 10, 1967 in Los Angeles, the daughter of actors Bruce Dern and Diane Ladd. Dern was exposed to movie sets and the movie industry from infancy, and obtained several bit parts as a child. Her parents divorced when Dern was two and Dern lost contact with her father for several years as a result.\n\nHer parents' background and her own early taste of the movie-making world soon convinced the young Dern to pursue acting herself. Like so many young actors, her decision may have been influenced by social awkwardness -- the child of 1960s counterculture parents, she was steeped in Eastern mysticism and political radicalism, and was seen as an oddball by her more conservative classmates. Even before her teens, she had achieved most of her impressive 5' 10\" height and was rail-skinny with a slouching posture.. Perhaps the nine-year-old Dern found refuge by studying acting at the Lee Strasberg Theater Institute.\n\nThe first success for the young Dern came in 1980, with a role in Adrian Lyne's Jeanies Clique (1980), a teen movie starring Jodie Foster. She followed this with several small parts, or parts in small movies, such as Ladies and Gentlemen, the Fabulous Stains (1982) and Die Aufsässigen (1984), as a student who has an affair with a teacher. (Her mother objected to her active presence on movie sets at age thirteen, which required Dern to sue for emancipation so she could play her role in \"The Fabulous Stains\"). Her next roles, as the blind girl who befriends the deformed boy in Die Maske (1985), and as a teen-aged girl whose sexual awakening collides with a mysterious older man in Bedrohliches Geflüster (1985), gave her career an important boost. Dern appeared to have made it with a leading role in David Lynch's acclaimed Blue Velvet (1986), but it was four years before her next notable film, and this was the bizarre Wild at Heart: Die Geschichte von Sailor und Lula (1990), also directed by Lynch.\n\nThe following year, Dern starred in Die Lust der schönen Rose (1991), which would become her signature performance, as a sexually-precocious, free-spirited young housemaid in the South in the 1930s. Dern earned an Oscar nomination for her performance, and so did her mother and co-star, Diane Ladd. Dern continues to win prominent roles on the big screen, often in smaller, highly-regarded human dramas such as October Sky (1999), Ich bin Sam (2001) and Wir leben nicht mehr hier (2004), although she is perhaps most widely known for her repeat role as Ellie Sattler in the summer adventure movies Jurassic Park (1993) and Jurassic Park III (2001), or for her guest performance on Ellen (1994), as the woman to whom Ellen finally comes out as a lesbian.\n\nDern's pre-teen gawkiness matured into lithe beauty, but this doesn't prevent Dern from fearlessly throwing herself into a wide variety of roles which are sometimes unflattering, an excellent example being her unflinchingly comic portrayal of an intensely annoying loser whose pregnancy becomes a social and political football in Baby Business (1996). This results in Dern being one of the most interesting actors working in Hollywood today.\n\nHaving previously dated such Hollywood talent as Treat Williams, Renny Harlin, Kyle MacLachlan, Jeff Goldblum and Billy Bob Thornton, Dern eventually married musician Ben Harper in 2005. Early in her career, Dern was roommate to Marianne Williamson, the spirituality guru. Dern attended two days of college at UCLA and one semester at USC.\n\nMulti-talented, multi-award-winning actress Kathleen (Doyle) Bates was born on June 28, 1948, and raised in Memphis, Tennessee. She is the youngest of three girls born to Bertye Kathleen (Talbot), a homemaker, and Langdon Doyle Bates, a mechanical engineer. Her grandfather was author Finis L. Bates. Kathy has English, as well as Irish, Scottish, and German, ancestry, and one of her ancestors, an Irish emigrant to New Orleans, once served as President Andrew Jackson's doctor.\n\nKathy discovered acting appearing in high school plays and studied drama at Southern Methodist University, graduating in 1969. With her mind firmly set, she moved to New York City in 1970 and paid her dues by working everything from a cash register to taking lunch orders. Things started moving quickly up the ladder after giving a tour-de-force performance alongside Christopher Walken at Buffalo's Studio Arena Theatre in Lanford Wilson's world premiere of \"Lemon Sky\" in 1970, but she also had a foreshadowing of the heartbreak to come after the successful show relocated to New York's off-Broadway Playhouse Theatre without her and Walken wound up winning a Drama Desk award.\n\nBy the mid-to-late 1970s, Kathy was treading the boards frequently as a rising young actress of the New York and regional theater scene. She appeared in \"Casserole\" and \"A Quality of Mercy\" (both 1975) before earning exceptional reviews for her role of Joanne in \"Vanities\". She took her first Broadway curtain call in 1980's \"Goodbye Fidel,\" which lasted only six performances. She then went directly into replacement mode when she joined the cast of the already-established and highly successful \"Fifth of July\" in 1981.\n\nKathy made a false start in films with Taking Off (1971), in which she was billed as \"Bobo Bates\". She didn't film again until Stunde der Bewährung (1978), starring Dustin Hoffman, and that part was not substantial enough to cause a stir. Things turned hopeful, however, when Kathy and the rest of the female ensemble were given the chance to play their respective Broadway parts in the film version of Robert Altman's Komm' zurück, Jimmy Dean (1982). It was a juicy role for Kathy and film audiences finally started noticing the now 34-year-old.\n\nStill and all, it was the New York stage that continued to earn Kathy awards and acclaim. She was pure textbook to any actor studying how to disappear into a role. Her characters ranged from free and life-affirming to downright pitiable. Despite winning a Tony Award nomination and Outer Critic's Circle Award for her stark, touchingly sad portrait of a suicidal daughter in 1983's \"'night, Mother\" and the Obie and Los Angeles Drama Critics Award for her powerhouse job as a romantic misfit in \"Frankie and Johnny in the Claire de Lune,\" Kathy had no box-office pull, however, and was never a strong consideration when the roles transferred to the screen. Her award-winning stage went to established film stars. First Sissy Spacek took over her potent role as the suicidal Jessie Cates in 'Nacht Mutter (1986), then Michelle Pfeiffer seized the moment to play her dumpy lover character in Frankie und Johnny (1991). It would take Oscar glory to finally rectify the injustice.\n\nIt was Kathy's fanatical turn as the drab, chunky, porcine-looking psychopath Annie Wilkes, who kidnaps her favorite author (James Caan) and subjects him to a series of horrific tortures, that finally turned the tide for her in Hollywood. With the 1990 shocker Misery (1990), based on the popular Stephen King novel, Bates and Caan were box office magic. Moreover, Kathy captured the \"Best Actress\" Oscar and Golden Globe award, a first in that genre (horror) for that category. To add to her happiness she married Tony Campisi, also an actor, in 1991.\n\nQuality film scripts now started coming her way and the 1990s proved to be a rich and rewarding time for her. First, she and another older \"overnight\" film star, fellow Oscar winner Jessica Tandy, starred together in the modern portion of the beautifully nuanced, flashback period piece Grüne Tomaten (1991). She then outdid herself as the detached and depressed housekeeper accused of murdering her abusive husband (David Strathairn) in Dolores (1995). Surprisingly, she was left out of the Oscar race for these two excellent performances. Not so, however, for her flashy political advisor Libby Holden in the movie Mit aller Macht (1998), receiving praise and a \"Best Supporting Actress\" nomination.\n\nKathy has continued to work prolifically on TV as a 14-time Emmy winner or nominee thus far. She has also taken to directing a couple of TV-movies on the sly. As most actors, she has been in hit and miss TV shows. On the hit side, she has earned a Golden Globe and Emmy nomination for her portrayal of Jay Leno's manager playing tough politics in The Late Shift - Spätvorstellung (1996) and played to the hilt the cruel-minded orphanage operator, Miss Hannigan, in Annie - Weihnachten einer Waise (1999) for which she also earned an Emmy nom. She has done some eye-catching, offbeat turns on regular series such as Six Feet Under - Gestorben wird immer (2001) (for which she also earned a DGA award for helming an episode), Das Büro (2005), Harry's Law (2011) and especially American Horror Story (2011) for which she won an Emmy as Ethel Darling. She also won an Emmy for a guest episode on the hit sitcom Two and a Half Men (2003).\n\nInteresting millennium filming have included a Catholic school's Mother Superior in the comic drama Bruno (2000); Jesse James' mother in American Outlaws (2001); a quirky, liberal mom in About Schmidt (2002) for which she earned another \"Best Supporting Actress\" Oscar nomination; a brief but potent turn as Gertrude Stein in Woody Allen's Midnight in Paris (2011); Queen Victoria in the adventurous remake of In 80 Tagen um die Welt (2004); wacky parent types in the comedies Zum Ausziehen verführt (2006) and Relative Strangers (2006); Mother Claus in the seasonal farce Die Gebrüder Weihnachtsmann (2007); an over-gushy foster mother in the dramedy Gilly Hopkins - Eine wie keine (2015); and a wrenching performance as the mother of a suspected terrorist in Der Fall Richard Jewell (2019) for which she earned her third \"Best Supporting Actress\" Oscar nomination.\n\nDivorced from husband Campisi since 1997, Kathy has been the Executive Committee Chair of the Actors Branch of the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences Board of Governors.\n\nThe dark and classically beautiful British actress and social activist Julia (Karin) Ormond was born on January 4, 1965, in Surrey, into England, the second of five children. Born of privilege as the daughter of a well-to-do laboratory technician, her parents divorced when she was young. Julia attended Guildford High School and Cranleigh, a private school, where she showed interest in theatre at that time appearing in a couple of their musicals.\n\nJulia's grandparents were artists, and she initially intended to be one herself but, after one year of art school, renewed her dedication to acting and transferred to Webber-Douglas Academy of Dramatic Art, where she graduated in 1988.\n\nAppearing in the play \"Wuthering Heights\" as Catherine, she met and eventually married her Heathcliff (actor Rory Edwards) in real life. In 1989 she won the London Drama Critic's Award for her performance in \"Faith, Hope and Charity\" as \"best newcomer.\" Julia also made an immediate impression on TV with her debuting role as a young drug addict in the series Traffik (1989)\n\nShe earned star-making attention in the TV-movie Die junge Katharina (1991), in which she portrayed Catherine the Great (also featuring husband Edwards). She then portrayed wife Nadya in the TV movie Stalin (1992) starring Robert Duvall in the title role. She made the jump into feature films scoring a top-billed debut opposite Ralph Fiennes in Das Wunder von Macon (1993), a drama about a woman giving an \"immaculate birth.\" She followed this this with lead or second lead roles in such films as the European biopic Nostradamus - Prophezeiungen des Schreckens (1994); the romantic drama Captives - Gefangen (1994) co-starring Tim Roth; and the period war drama Legenden der Leidenschaft (1994) as the object of affection for both Brad Pitt and Aidan Quinn. It was around the time of this career rise (1994) that her marriage ended.\n\nWith Hollywood now taking a firm notice, Julia was given the fetching role of Queen Guinevere alongside Sean Connery's King Arthur and Richard Gere's Lancelot in Der erste Ritter (1995) and, more importantly, was entrusted with Audrey Hepburn's title role in the revival of Sabrina (1995), her radiant presence nearly stealing the picture away from handsome co-stars Harrison Ford and Greg Kinnear.\n\nStrangely, Julia's major rise led her in a different direction. From there she instead went on to grace a number of independents and foreign features. She played the title role in the Danish/German/Swedish co-production Fräulein Smillas Gespür für Schnee (1997) as a woman who gets involved with a strange murder mystery; the Russian period drama Der Barbier von Sibirien (1998) as a lovely American who gets dangerously involved with a young Russian cadet; and involved herself in another messy affair with Vince Vaughn in the indie drama The Prime Gig (2000). On stage, she appeared in David Hare's \"My Zinc Bed,\" for which she received a 2001 Olivier Award nomination for \"Best Actress.\"\n\nInto the millennium, Julia found herself busy film-wise with the political drama Resistance (2003), cult filmmaker David Lynch's thoroughly offbeat Inland Empire (2006), Ich weiß, wer mich getötet hat (2007), Der seltsame Fall des Benjamin Button (2008), The Music Never Stopped (2011), Albatross (2011), My Week with Marilyn (2011) (as Vivien Leigh), Chained (2012), Ladies in Black (2018) and Son of the South (2020). On TV she appeared in the mini-series Beach Girls (2005), and had recurring roles on CSI: New York (2004), Nurse Jackie (2009), Criminal Intent - Verbrechen im Visier (2001), Mad Men (2007), Gold Digger (2019), plus a series starring role as one of Witches of East End (2013). She also co-starred in the short-lived series Incorporated (2016).\n\nIn 1999, she married a second time to political activist Jon Rubin. They had one daughter, Sophie, before their divorce. On a political front, Julia has been involved fighting human trafficking since the mid-1990s. In 2005, she was appointed United Nations Goodwill Ambassador with a focus on anti-human-trafficking initiatives and awareness.\n\nAngular in features, reserved in demeanor and more-or-less plaintive in appearance, actress Jane Alexander has played down the glamour card for the most part. Her true brilliance has come from the remarkable range and depth of her talent. Heralded as one of the finest 70s actresses to arrive in films following a towering Broadway success, Jane went on to earn an Oscar nomination for her film debut, an acknowledgment given to very few of her acting peers.\n\nShe was born Jane Quigley in Boston, Massachusetts, on October 28, 1939, the daughter of Thomas, an orthopedic surgeon, and Ruth Elizabeth (née Pearson) Quigley, a nurse. Jane attended Beaver Country Day School, an all-girls facility, just outside of Boston. Here is where she first aspired to acting and made her stage debut as an adolescent in a production of \"Treasure Island\". Urged on by her father to find stability in her life, she first attended college before embarking on an acting career. She studied math as well as theater at Sarah Lawrence College in Bronxville, New York, where she thought computer programming might be a convenient alternative in case her acting dreams fell through. However, a chance to study at the University of Edinburgh in Scotland, wherein she became a member of the Edinburgh University Dramatic Society, dissolved any other career interests but acting.\n\nFollowing theater roles in \"The Inspector General\" and \"Look Back in Anger\", Jane found critical success in 1967 when chosen to play the mistress of black boxer Jack Jefferson in the landmark production of \"The Great White Hope\" at the Arena Stage in Washington, DC. opposite James Earl Jones. She and Jones both won Tony and Drama Desk Awards for their performances when the play went to Broadway the following year. Both also earned Academy Award nominations after making the transition to film. Die große, weiße Hoffnung (1970) would mark the first of four nominations for Jane. Although singled out for her supporting roles in Alle Männer des Präsidenten (1976), Kramer gegen Kramer (1979) and her heartfelt leading role in Das letzte Testament (1983) as a small town wife whose family is threatened by radioactive fallout, the Oscar trophy has remained elusive.\n\nOn stage, she received a plethora of Tony nominations over the years for such sterling work in \"6 Rms Riv Vu\" (1972), \"Find Your Way Home\" (1974), \"First Monday in October\" (1978), \"The Visit\" (1991), \"The Sisters Rosenzweig\" (1993), and \"Honour\" (1998). Other telling parts came as Gertrude in \"Hamlet\", Hedda in \"Hedda Gabler\", Cleopatra in \"Antony and Cleopatra\", Annie Sullivan in \"Monday After the Miracle\" and Maxine in \"The Night of the Iguana\".\n\nJane has triumphed just as notably on TV. She perfectly embodied the non-glamorous role of Eleanor Roosevelt opposite Edward Herrmann's FDR in the TV movies Eleanor and Franklin (1976) and Eleanor and Franklin: The White House Years (1977) and was Emmy-nominated both times for her efforts. Decades later she would portray FDR's mother, Sara Delano Roosevelt, in HBO's Warme Quellen (2005) starring Kenneth Branagh and Cynthia Nixon and won the coveted award for 'Best Supporting Actress'. Throughout the years she would play a myriad of quality leads in such TV-movies as A Circle of Children (1977); Arthur Miller's Das Mädchenorchester von Auschwitz (1980); which earned her a second Emmy, the title role in Calamity Jane (1984); Das verrückte Hollywood (1985), in which she portrayed notorious gossip maven Hedda Hopper; Blut und Orchideen (1986), and; Gefangene des Krieges (1987).\n\nAlexander met and married her first husband, Robert Alexander, in the early 1960s in New York City, when both were attempting to jump-start their acting careers. They had one son, Jace Alexander in 1964, an actor/director in his own right who co-founded the avant garde NYC theater company Naked Angels. Her marriage to Alexander, who was also a director, ended in divorce. She later met producer/director Edwin Sherin in Washington, DC, while he was serving as artistic director at the Arena Stage. He has three sons from his previous marriage. They married in 1975 and reside in New York City.\n\nIn 1993, Jane took a sabbatical from acting when President Clinton appointed her as the first chairman of the National Endowment for the Arts. Relocating to Washington, DC, she showed strong leadership and served for four years. Her 2000 book, \"Command Performance: an Actress in the Theater of Politics\" chronicles the challenges she faced heading up the organization when the Republican Congress unsuccessfully tried to shut it down. The agency survived but with a 45% cut in funding.\n\nIn 2004, Alexander, together with her second husband, joined the theater faculty at Florida State University (FSU). She holds honorary doctorates from 11 colleges and universities in the U.S. In addition, Jane has been active on many boards, including the Wildlife Conservation Society, Project Greenhope, the National Stroke Association, and Women's Action for Nuclear Disarmament. She has also received the Israel Cultural Award and the Helen Caldicott Leadership Award.\n\nReturning to acting into the millennium, Jane has appeared, often as professional types (judges, doctors), in such films as Ring (2002), Zauber der Liebe (2007), Gigantic (2008), The Unborn (2009), Terminator: Die Erlösung (2009), Mr. Morgans letzte Liebe (2013) and Three Christs (2017). She has also graced such TV programs as \"Law & Order,\" \"Forgive Me,\" \"The Black List,\" \"The Good Wife,\" \"Elementary,\" \"The Good Fight,\" \"Modern Love,\" and a steady role on the short-lived series Tell Me You Love Me (2007).\n\nSouthern-bred Mary-Louise Parker was born on August 2, 1964 in Fort Jackson, South Carolina, the youngest of four children of Judge John Morgan Parker, and the former Caroline Louise Morell. She is of mostly Swedish, English, and Scottish descent. Her father's occupation took the family both around the country and abroad while growing up.\n\nParker showed potential in her teens and majored in acting in her college years, graduating from the North Carolina School of the Arts. Beginning her acting career with a part on the daytime soap Ryan's Hope (1975), Mary decided to test the waters in New York, and after work on the off-Broadway stage in the late 1980s, made her Broadway debut with \"Prelude to a Kiss\" in 1990, where she won the Theatre World Award, the Clarence Derwent Award and a Tony nomination.\n\nFilms and TV quickly followed and she quickly gained attention. She provided both poignant and amusing as the token femme friend to a group of gay men in the AIDS drama Freundschaft fürs Leben (1989), but really caught fire with her feisty, standout performance in Grüne Tomaten (1991), holding her own against such female powerhouses as Jessica Tandy, Kathy Bates and Mary Stuart Masterson. Dubbed by some as the \"long-suffering girl next door,\" she played such noble offbeat miserables and cast-asides in Grand Canyon - Im Herzen der Stadt (1991), Naked in New York (1993), Bullets Over Broadway (1994), Der Klient (1994) Kaffee, Milch & Zucker (1995), in which she was the AIDS victim this time, Portrait of a Lady (1996), Der Macher (1997), Black Devil (1999), Roter Drache (2002) and Pipe Dream - Lügen haben Klempnerbeine (2001).\n\nPreferring quality over quantity, she perfected her craft with offbeat roles in independent features and did not abandon her theater roots. She copped a slew of acting prizes for her stage work in \"How I Learned to Drive\" (1996) and, most notably, \"Proof\" in 2000, wherein she won nearly every award there is to attain, including the prestigious Tony. Her marquee name still does not command what it should, but a picture or production with Mary-Louise Parker in it usually guarantees a strong critical reception. Unmarried, she did enter into a longtime companionship with actor Billy Crudup after the twosome appeared opposite each other in the 1996 play, \"Bus Stop\". They went their separate ways in 2003, amid major controversy (she was pregnant at the time).\n\nMary Louise continues to divide her time equally and skillfully on TV, film and the stage. The powerful TV miniseries adaptation of Tony Kushner heralded award-winning Broadway play Engel in Amerika (2003), directed by Mike Nichols, earned the actress supporting performance Golden Globe and Emmy awards. She also earned a Tony nomination for the Broadway show, \"Reckless\", a year later but truly turned heads and wowed audiences the year after that in the highly acclaimed 7-season Showtime series Weeds - Kleine Deals unter Nachbarn (2005), earning another Golden Globe and several Emmy nominations for her amazing performance as Nancy Botwin, a relatively naïve suburban housewife and mother who courts serious trouble with the law and drug cartels when she turns into a neighborhood drug dealer for sustenance after her husband dies suddenly.\n\nInto the millennium, Mary has continued with compelling work in such films as R.E.D. 2 - Noch Älter. Härter. Besser. (2013), R.I.P.D. (2013), Jamesy Boy (2014), Behaving Badly: Brav sein war gestern (2014), Chronically Metropolitan (2016), Golden Exits (2017) and Red Sparrow (2018). TV roles have included recurring roles on The Blacklist (2013) and the sci-fi thriller Mr. Mercedes (2017).\n\nHer first child is eighteen-year-old William Atticus Parker -- a director, writer and actor. Adopting a second child from Ethiopia, Mary Louise was acknowledged in 2013 for her significant contributions to Hope North, an organization that works in the educating and healing of young victims caught in Uganda's civil war. Her memoir-in-letters, Dear Mr. You, came out in 2015.\n\nOne of Broadway and Hollywood's perennial and cleverer talents who tends to shine a smart, cynical light on her surroundings, Stockard Channing was born Susan Williams Antonia Stockard on February 13, 1944 in New York City to a Protestant father and a Catholic mother of Irish descent. Her parents were Mary Alice (née English) and well-to-do shipping executive Lester Napier Stockard; the latter died when his daughter was 16 and left her a sizable estate.\n\nChanning attended the eminent Chapin School in NYC, then later attended the Madeira School, a girls' boarding school in Virginia. She majored in both literature and history at Radcliffe College, from which she graduated summa cum laude in 1965. In 1964 she married Walter Channing Jr., a businessman whose surname she kept for part of her own stage moniker after their divorce four years later.\n\nInterested in acting, she made her stage debut in a production of \"The Investigation\" at the experimental Theatre Company of Boston in 1966. She went on to play a number of offbeat roles with the company. She eventually migrated to New York where she took her first Broadway bow as a chorus member and understudy in the musical version of 'Two Gentlemen of Verona' in 1971. Two years later she would take over the prime role of Julia in the L.A. national company. Other theater roles during this time included 'Adaptation/Next' (1970) 'Arsenic and Old Lace' (1970), 'Play Strindberg' (1971), and 'No Hard Feelings' (1973).\n\nSomewhat plaintive yet magnetic and unique-looking, the dark-haired actress began first appearing in pictures with small parts in the dark comedy Hospital (1971) and the edgy Barbra Streisand fantasy-drama Sandkastenspiele (1972). Taking on the top female lead as an heiress and potential victim of shysters Jack Nicholson and Warren Beatty in Mike Nichols' comedy Mitgiftjäger (1975), the film, despite its male star power and her Golden Globe nomination, would not become the star-making hit for Channing as initially predicted.\n\nWhile her next two films, (Die haarsträubende Reise in einem verrückten Bus (1976) and Catch Ferrari (1976)), didn't get her to first base with the public either, Channing hit a major home run with the TV-movie The Girl Most Likely to... (1973), a clever black comedy written by Joan Rivers wherein she played a former ugly duckling-turned-beauty (à la plastic surgery) who decides to attract and knock off the men who cruelly cast her aside earlier. Channing found her niche with this smart, sardonic character and it would take her quite far in Hollywood.\n\nAt age 33(!), Stockard was handed the feisty role of high-school \"tough girl\" Betty Rizzo in the box-office film version of the hit musical Grease (1978), starring Olivia Newton-John and John Travolta. While long in the tooth for such a role (as were most of the others in the lead cast), she compelled the audience to suspend disbelief in her sly performance, which earned her a People's Choice Award (Favorite Motion Picture Supporting Actress). This blockbuster clinched her place as a top-ranking star contender.\n\nHanded two sitcom vehicles of her own within a year on CBS, Stockard Channing in Just Friends (1979) had her playing a newly-separated wife starting life anew in another city (L.A.) while The Stockard Channing Show (1980) starred her as a divorced lady again trying to find herself in L.A. Neither caught on and lasted but a few months. Stalled at a critical juncture in her career, she decided to return to her first love -- the theater. With 'Vanities', 'Absurd Person Singular', and 'As You Like It' (as Rosalind) already on her resume, she earned fine notices on Broadway with the musical 'They're Playing Our Song', succeeding Lucie Arnaz in 1980, then garnered rave reviews as the mother of a developmentally disabled child in the New Haven production of Peter Nichols' 'A Day in the Death of Joe Egg' in 1982. The actress repeated her role on Broadway a few years later (the title now shortened to \"Joe Egg\") and copped the 1985 Tony Award for Best Actress in a Play. Subsequent Tony nominations came her way for her offbeat work in 'The House of Blue Leaves' (1986); 'Six Degrees of Separation' (for which she also won an Off-Broadway Obie), 'Four Baboons Adoring the Sun' (1992); and for her Eleanor of Aquitaine in 'The Lion in Winter' in 1999.\n\nAward-worthy projects again came her way on TV. Nominated for an Emmy for the CBS miniseries Schatten in der Dunkelheit (1987), she also won a CableACE Award for her work in Tidy Endings (1988). In film, she received Oscar and Golden Globe nominations when her stage triumph, Das Leben - Ein Sechserpack (1993), was turned into a film. This was followed by a rare vulnerable role as an abused, small-town housewife in the popular drag queen dramedy To Wong Foo, Thanks for Everything! Julie Newmar (1995), a co-star role alongside Jennifer Tilly as two divorce-bound women who meet in Reno in Edie & Pen (1996), a prime role in the remake of Moll Flanders (1996) and as an eccentric aunt in the comedy/fantasy Zauberhafte Schwestern (1998). She also provided the voice of Barbara Gordon in several episodes of Batman of the Future (1999).\n\nChanning has remained a highly productive, award-winning presence into the millennium on film, TV and the occasional stage. Beginning with a London Film Critics Circle Award for Best Actress in the film The Business of Strangers (2001), her other movies have included co-star or featured roles in Leben oder so ähnlich (2002), Behind the Red Door (2003), Eine Affäre in Paris (2003), Frau mit Hund sucht Mann mit Herz (2005), Sparkle (2007), Multiple Sarcasms (2010), and Pulling Strings (2013).\n\nAs part of the acclaimed cast of The West Wing: Im Zentrum der Macht (1999) as \"First Lady\" Abigail Bartlet, audiences were so drawn to her shrewd, classy character that producers wisely started featuring her regularly into the third season, winning both Emmy and SAG awards and a slew of nominations for this long-running role. Other awards came for social dramas. She received a second Emmy for her supporting turn as mother Judy Sheppard in Die Matthew Shepard Story (2002), a docudrama about the gay-bashing murder of young Matthew Shepard, a Daytime Emmy for her role in the TV movie Jack (2004) in which she plays a wife who finds out her husband is gay, and a SAG nomination as a mother who discovers her teenage daughter is lesbian in Schmerzende wahrheit (2000).\n\nStockard thought she finally found sitcom success with the series Out of practice - Doktor, single sucht... (2005) and was even Emmy-nominated for her role as a sharp-tongued but caring doctor. As luck would have it, however, a core audience was not to be found and the show lasted but a mere season. She fared better in a recurring part as Julianna Margulies' mother on the popular dramatic series Good Wife (2009).\n\nReturning to the stage, Stockard played \"Lady Bracknell\" in a 2010 Dublin production of 'The Importance of Being Earnest', and the following year was nominated for a Tony and Drama Desk for 'Other Desert Cities'. In 2018, she appeared in the play 'Apologia', co-starring Hugh Dancy in London.\n\nDivorced four times, including to actor Paul Schmidt and writer/producer David Debin, she has no children. She has been in a three-decade-long relationship with cinematographer/gaffer Dan Gillham."
