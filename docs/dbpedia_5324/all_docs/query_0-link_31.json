        "text": "Servant Leadership Theory: An Empirical Test of Servant Leadership Perceptions of University Students in Ethiopia\n\nSolomon Chafamo Abiye | 2023\n\nAbstract\n\nIn this exploratory study, I examined the workability of servant leadership theory (Patterson, 2003) in an Ethiopian context for the first time. Patterson’s servant leadership theory is comprised of seven servant leadership virtues, agapao love, humility, altruism, vision, trust, empowerment, and service. I investigated the causal relationship between her servant leadership virtues using 211 participants from Wachemo University in Hossana, Ethiopia. The participants assessed the servant leadership of their instructors using Dennis and Bocarnea’s (2005) revised Servant Leadership Assessment Instrument. The simple and multiple regression analysis results revealed the causal relationship between the servant leadership virtues, which extended the findings of previous studies (Koshal, 2005; L. Nelson, 2003), which indicated the compatibility of Patterson’s servant leadership virtues with African cultural values. In addition, I performed t tests to answer the research question that addressed the perception of servant leadership of leaders by leader– follower gender similarities. The result of the tests indicated differences in three of the constructs, humility, altruism, and empowerment. However, it showed no difference in servant leadership by gender–follower relationship in the love, vision, trust, and service constructs. I discussed possible implications of the deviation in the results, and the role of the love construct to support the unconditional aspect of servant leadership. By testing Patterson’s servant leadership virtues in Ethiopia, I pioneered a new leadership model for the country that has been through a lot with an unsubstantiated socioeconomic and political structure to see itself and work toward human-centered leadership philosophy.\n\nFollowership and Preferred Leadership Behaviors: Conversion of Passive and Alienated Followers Into Exemplary Followers\n\nAyodele Adepoju | 2023\n\nAbstract\n\nThe review of existing literature established a need to explore the leadership behaviors that help transition passive and alienated followers, including quiet quitters, into much more actively engaged followers in the organization. It reviewed the relationship between Kelley Followers Styles (KFS) and the Leadership Practices Inventory (LPI). I utilized descriptive and correlation analysis, using the results of a self-administered survey of 135 individuals using a nonprobability convenience sampling. I derived the questionnaire using the instruments of Kelley’s Power of Followership Survey and Kouzes and Posner’s LPI. The hypothesis testing assessed the strength of the relationship, whether significant, in the 10 hypotheses developed from the five metacategories of LPI and two KFS dimensions. The findings established a positive correlation between the two KFS dimensions and LPI’s five practices. Second, the testing results showed that nine out of 10 hypotheses were fully supported as the correlation coefficients (r ranging between .701 and .784) showed a high correlation or marked relationship, and the results were statistically significant. Third, the top two LPI variables that correlate the most with KFS’s active engagement are Model the Way (r = .784) and Encourage the Heart (r = .776). Lastly, the top two LPI variables that correlate most with KFS’s independent critical thinking are Inspire a Shared Vision (r = .735) and Challenge the Process (r = .730). The results of this study contributed to the field of knowledge as it extended previous research on followership and leadership relationships. In addition, this is the first study to evaluate the type of leadership behaviors required to convert passive and alienated followers into a much more integral part of the team. It is also the first that examined the correlation between KFS and LPI. Future research can explore cultural effects, adopt qualitative or mixed research methods, explore the presence of mediating or moderating variables, or use other followership or leadership instruments.\n\nA Phenomenological Study of African American Women’s Experiences in Church Leadership\n\nDwayne Castro | 2023\n\nAbstract\n\nLeadership is among the most discussed topics in the contemporary world, as increased competence fosters the institutions’ success; however, continued research has shown that the phenomenon has been a reserve of the masculine males for many decades, leading to women being comprehensively underrepresented, especially in church leadership. Recent observations have shown that women have continually taken leadership roles, which have introduced a new set of challenges faced during their rise to church administrative duties and when they attain full pastoral positions. Some of the obstacles/experienced by clergywomen are related to the societal biases which have permeated society for centuries. These include unconscious bias (external), imposter syndrome (internal), and double-bide paradox. These biases have been reinforced by various biblical perspectives and misinterpretations and the patriarchal society, which has framed leadership as assuming the male figure leading to women leaders facing adverse experiences while undertaking their leadership roles. Further, there is an observed glass cliff situation where women are only appointed to positions of power in the face of crises, setting them to fail, an aspect that reinforces the societal view that women are not equally capable as leaders. Glass cliff is a situation in which women are promoted to leadership positions during a crisis. Based on the above, the researcher designed a qualitative study to investigate the diverse experiences faced by women in church leadership. The researcher used a semistructured interview to analyze the experiences of 12 women in leadership positions drawn from churches adopting egalitarian and complementarian philosophies to make solid inferences on the persistence of the experiences and offer diverse recommendations.\n\nKeywords: Egalitarian, leadership, bias, women leadership, experience, church, church leadership\n\nThe CRED Study: Reimagining the Work, Worth, and Well-Being of American Clergy\n\nWayne Emmanuel Credle | 2023\n\nAbstract\n\nThis qualitative study explored the lived experiences of 11 American full-time pastors at the senior and executive level to examine how personal, interpersonal, vocational, and social stress affect the well-being of clergypersons. Completing the study answered the calls of both Asimakoupoulos (1997) and Pooler (2011) who called for new models of organizational support for clergypersons. An exhaustive review of (a) spiritual leadership, (b) Christian leadership, (c) workplace spirituality, and (d) role identity theory was conducted, which yielded five research questions: RQ1: What does a typical day look like for American clergy? RQ2: How does clergy find purpose and meaning at work? RQ3: What is needed for clergy to have purpose and meaning at work? RQ4: How is the well-being of clergy? RQ5: What support do American clergy need to support their work, worth, and well-being? Ten interview questions emerged from the five research questions used in a one-on-one interview with the participants. Participants were chosen from a mixture of convenience sampling and purposive sampling for a 1-hour virtual interview. Participants were between the ages of 33-64, male and female, African American and Caucasian, and represented the Baptist (3), Presbyterian (2), and United Methodist Church (3) as well as nondenominational churches (3). Eight of the participants pastored a local church, and two of the participants served as chaplains at a university and in the Air Force. One participant served as a pastor of two churches and a hospital chaplain. The study concluded that clergypersons do more paperwork than pastoral care; are motivated inwardly, outwardly, and eschatologically; need place, space, and grace; handle stress by integrating, isolating, compartmentalizing, or being actively inactive; and need competitive pay, consistent practices, covenant people, and unconventional principles. As a result, the four domains of connection, restoration, empowerment, and development (CRED) emerged as a tool to assess the needs of clergypersons and assist with crafting strategies of intervention to maintain clergy well-being.\n\nA Qualitative Study of the Relationship between Self-Compassion, Self-Care, and Self-Efficacy Among School Psychologist Leaders\n\nLaura Gali | 2023\n\nAbstract\n\nSelf-compassion and self-care are challenges for leaders, including school psychologists who are especially vulnerable to burnout, which could cause harm. The purpose of the study was to explore the relationship between the self-efficacy of school psychologists as caregiving leaders and their self-compassion and self-care. Specifically, the researcher explored the behavioral relationships of self-efficacy, self-care, and self-compassion among school psychologists as caregiving leaders and the role of these relationships in informing stress or burnout in their leadership roles. The researcher used a qualitative descriptive design to gather the participants’ descriptions of the phenomenon to address the posed research questions. It provided an understanding of how to describe the characteristics of self-compassion, self-care, and self-efficacy through their descriptions obtained through semi-structured interviews from the target population, which included school psychologists at public schools in the United States. From the results of the study, the self-compassion behaviors shared by school psychologists include compassionate self-talk, self-advocacy and boundaries, welcoming help, and physical acts of kindness toward themselves. The school psychologists also shared several self-care characteristics, such as mindfulness, common humanity, and kindness. In addition, the researcher found that increasing the school psychologists’ self-confidence and positivity influenced their performance of their duties as caregiving leaders and improved their overall job performance. Additionally, school psychologists influence their colleagues and peers in many ways. School psychologists’ self-compassion, self-care, and self-efficacy helped them manage their stress and burnout. The primary outcomes of self-compassion on preventing burnout included improved mental health, increased resilience, stronger boundaries, and improved mental clarity. The lack of self-awareness among school psychologists contributed to high levels of stress and burnout, leading to adverse outcomes for both the psychologists and the students they serve. The implications for practitioners included mindfulness practice, developing support networks, and creating a culture of self-care and compassion.\n\nThe Balancing of Social Identity and Christian Identity in Christian Leadership: Successful Principles for Christian Leaders Operating in the Diverse Cultural Context of Ethiopia\n\nGirma Altaye Gebremedhin | 2023\n\nAbstract\n\nThe identity quest has intensified globally and locally (Friedman, 2000). The issues relating to identity vary from one context to another. In some western countries, sexual and gender identity-related issues have become critical (Carr, 2010). In the Ethiopian context, issues like ethnicity, language, and traditional religion have become the centerpiece of the sociopolitical life of Ethiopians (Zewde, 2004). Evangelical leaders are not exempt from these issues. The intensified identity quest makes balancing social identity and Christian identity a daily struggle for many evangelical leaders. This study intended to answer three questions: What is the proper balance between social and evangelical Christian identity in the Ethiopian context? How do exemplar leaders maintain the balance between the multiple identities they have? And how do exemplar Christian leaders manage to keep their Christian identity to be their core identity? Applying the qualitative case study method, framed by social identity theory and the related social categorization theory, and interviewing 18 exemplar leaders from the evangelical community in Ethiopia, successful principles were drawn. The study confirmed that balancing social identity and Christianity identity is a daily struggle for evangelical Christian leaders in Ethiopia. The study also revealed the growing importance of identity in leadership. Nicholson and Carrol (2013) concluded that the global identity quest resurfaced identity as an essential dimension of leadership. The findings of this study reveal that Christian leadership has to pay due attention to the issue of identity. One can argue that developing skills for balancing social identity and Christian identity has become crucial for effectiveness in Christian leadership. This study revealed some fundamental principles for balancing social and Christian identity, which are discussed.\n\nComparing Organizational Change Impacting Commitment and Burnout on Essential Childcare Workers During COVID-19: A Qualitative Analysis\n\nKimberly Amanda Gentry | 2023\n\nAbstract\n\nThe purpose of this qualitative research study was to determine the impact of organizational change on both organizational commitment and employee burnout, specifically related to COVID-19 through a postpandemic lens. The conceptual background of the study highlighted the importance of this research, and the study was designed to answer the call by numerous scholars including Yates (2022), Jung et al. (2020), Kim et al. (2016), Allen et al. (2007), and Peng et al. (2020). Based on the body of previous literature, a qualitative bounded case study fell into place as the research methodology. The researcher interviewed 12 research participants following the interview guide derived from literature and answered the two research questions: 1. Utilizing the theoretical constructs derived from Maslach’s Burnout Inventory and Meyer & Allen’s Organizational Commitment, in what ways did COVID-19 impact the essential worker’s organizational commitment and level of burnout in childcare-focused organizations comparing nonprofit and for-profit small businesses? 2. Through the lens of influence with Kotter’s eight steps of organizational change, is employee burnout related to organizational commitment within nonprofit and for-profit organizations? Qualitative data were collected and analyzed by the researcher and coded using ATLAS.ti software. The two cycles of qualitative coding including descriptive and thematic coding were used, and a total of 10 themes emerged for greater understanding. The themes found included leadership, COVID, communication, motivation, perspective, atmosphere, strategy, COVID accommodations, communication (comparison), and deficiencies. Practical implications, limitations of the research, and future recommendations are provided to conclude the study.\n\nSpiritual Calling and Authentic Followership of American Korean Workers\n\nSeongeun Kim | 2023\n\nAbstract\n\nRecently, the relationship between spiritual variables and job-related ones to organizations and their members has begun to be discussed in greater depth. Through this study, the researcher aimed to investigate the relationship between spiritual calling and authentic followership in American Korean workers. Based on the Spiritual Calling Scale of Neubert and Halbesleben (2015) and the Authentic Followership Profile (AFP) of VanWhy (2015), The researcher designed this study as a multiple regression analysis study to test 4 hypotheses under a central research question. Data were collected via survey from simple random sampling and snowball sampling methods of 146 American Korean workers through Facebook, email, and the Kakao Talk mobile messaging app. The participants completed the full questionnaire online anonymously using Google Forms. The sample size was 146 individuals. Multiple regression analysis was used to analyze the data using SPSS statistics. Hierarchical multiple regression analysis in SPSS 28 revealed that spiritual calling was positively related to authentic followership, p < .001, that spiritual calling was positively associated with authentic followership, p < .001, but that other gender, age, education, religion, and years did not play critical roles in any of these measured relationships. Therefore, positive relationships between the sense of spiritual calling and authentic followership were validated in American Korean workers. This study contributed to finding the positive relationship between spiritual calling and authentic followership by extending the GLOBE project and follower-centered leadership.\n\nKey Words: Spiritual Calling, Authentic Followership, the GLOBE project, and Multiple Regression Analysis.\n\nA Phenomenological Analysis of the Effects of Leader Toxicity: Examining the Lived Experiences of U.S. Naval Officers Exposed to Toxic Leadership\n\nEmmanuel Mamaril | 2023\n\nAbstract\n\nThe purpose of this dissertation was to understand the perspectives of followers/subordinates exposed and subjected to toxic leadership within the United States (U.S.) Navy. Specifically, this study centered on the lived experiences of U.S. Navy junior officers with leader toxicity and how they coped with such circumstances. The goals of this study were to add to the growing dark leadership literature with an emphasis on specifically contributing to the U.S. military toxic leadership literature from the U.S. Navy perspective. A phenomenological inquiry design was employed to capture the study participants’ perceptions and descriptions regarding their experiences with toxic leadership. To further investigate the study’s chosen phenomenon of understanding U.S. Navy junior officers’ experiences with toxic leadership and how they coped with the leader toxicity, an in-depth review of existing studies regarding dark leadership, toxic leadership, and subordinate coping strategies was conducted. The in-depth review of the available literature regarding these topics helped inform the generation of the study’s two research questions that consisted of the following: (a) What are the lived experiences of U.S. Navy junior officers with toxic leadership? (b) How do U.S. Navy junior officers cope with leaders and supervisors who exhibit actions, behaviors, and conduct associated with toxic leadership? In order to collect data to answer these two research questions, an open-ended format interview guide that contained 11 questions was applied during the interviews with the five study participants. Applying an iterative coding process to the collected data from the interviews yielded eight overall themes that provided insights in helping answer the study’s two research questions. Four of the themes described the lived experiences of the participants with toxic leadership as debilitating, negative, relentless, and resilience building. The other four themes explained how the participants coped with the leader toxicity through reframing, responding directly, avoidance, and seeking help. This study provided insights for U.S. Navy leaders to explore that may contribute to the emergence of toxic leadership and offered suggestions for subordinates and victims on how to manage challenges associated with toxic leadership.\n\nIdentifying Factors Influencing the Choice of Full-Time Ministry as a Vocation\n\nMark L. Milioni | 2023\n\nAbstract\n\nThe purpose of this qualitative analysis was to determine the identifiable factors in the life and environment of those that choose the vocation of full-time ministry. Churches in the United States are experiencing a concerning decline in the number of pastors available to fill their pulpits. Is it possible to understand better how God works in lives to encourage men and women to pursue a life of ministry? Can the factors surrounding the experience of those that have experienced a calling be identified? Can these factors help determine the environment in which God works to call a person? Can we better understand how God is preparing a person for a calling? If these questions can be answered, then perhaps the decline in the number of people choosing ministry as a vocation can be stemmed. The researcher sought to explore the phenomena of the environment in which specific influences may impact the choice of ministry as a career. The researcher employed a qualitative study to answer these questions. The primary method of gathering data for this study was semi-structured interviews. Twelve successful career ministry leaders who met the study criteria were asked eight questions in face-to-face narrative interviews. Evidence was gathered through these interviews to discover common themes, phenomena, and environmental influences that led to the participants’ choice of ministry as a career. The collected data was analyzed using multiple cycles of coding. Four primary environmental influences were identified that impact the choice of ministry as a career choice: Godly Family and Home Environment, Church is the Center of Family Culture, Mentors that Show Interest and Give Encouragement Toward Ministry, and Significant Spiritual Experiences. This study can contribute to understanding and identifying those with a life that God may be preparing for His service.\n\nA Qualitative Investigation of Organizational Communication During Change\n\nChad Matthew Minor | 2023\n\nAbstract\n\nThere is currently a gap in the literature surrounding organizational communication and its impact on follower emotions and workplace efficiency. This phenomenological qualitative inquiry investigated the organizational change of Christ Community Church, how it was communicated, and the impact that the communication style had on follower emotion and workplace efficiency. This research benefits organizations navigating through change, the impact change has on followers, and how organizations can effectively communicate change. This research identifies how the style and method of communicating change impacts followers’ emotions and workplace efficiency. This qualitative analysis determines if various organizational communication methods negatively affect followers’ emotions and workplace efficiency. Through snowball sampling, the research demonstrates data saturation that highlights the outcome of ineffective communication and its negative impact on followers’ emotions and workplace efficiency. This analysis provides literature on organizational communication, change, and followership while determining the importance of future research on how communication impacts followers. This phenomenological analysis provides organizations with research about the method of organizational communication during change and gives them the ability to identify follower emotions during change, thus allowing them to develop a positive organizational culture.\n\nMentorship Praxis: A Case Study of Regent University’s School of Business & Leadership Executive Mentor Program\n\nBrian T. Moore | 2023\n\nAbstract Purpose. This case study aimed to explore and explain the praxis and outcomes of contemporary mentorship and servant leadership in Regent University’s School of Business & Leadership Executive Mentor Program (EMP) from the perspectives of volunteer mentors and student mentees. Methodology. I used quantitative and qualitative approaches in a one-phase convergent mixed methods design to simultaneously collect quantitative and qualitative data for analysis and comparison. The quantitative approach included (a) nonexperimental and cross-sectional survey design, (b) internet survey data collection, (c) EMP mentor and mentee populations, (d) single-stage sampling procedures, (e) nonprobability sampling, (f) the Essential Servant Leadership Behaviors (ESLB) instrument, (g) independent t test for analysis of variance of mentor and mentee groups, and (h) single-sample t test for frequency analysis of groups. The qualitative approach included a phenomenological design with purposive sampling and semistructured interview methods. I analyzed data in a three-phase cycle: (a) first cycle Exploratory Coding methods, (b) second cycle Cumulative Coding methods, and (c) the development of first and second cycle coding tables for comparison, analysis, and theme refinement. Findings and Results. This case study (a) revealed three emergent servant leadership attitudinal, behavioral, and performance outcome themes; (b) exposed the need for improvements within the EMP; (c) recommended the need to modify the ESLB for testing and universal application; and (d) presented the emergence of the mentorship succession theory (MST). First, exploring the praxis of the EMP revealed the emergence of three overlapping and integrated servant leadership themes: (a) attitudinal outcomes (feelings and emotions), (b) behavioral outcomes (actions), and (c) performance outcomes (gains or improvements). EMP mentors and mentees perceived high levels of servant leadership attitudinal, behavioral, and performance outcomes while at the same time noting areas for improvement. Second, the ESLB instrument had two limitations: workplace and leaders-rating focus. Future research testing and validating the modified ESLB could lead to a one-factor servant leadership instrument with counterpart and self-ratings for universal application. Third, this dissertation presented the emergence of the MST. More specifically, with leadership as a means of succession, MST is a succession process whereby one generation perpetuates the next through servant leadership. First, succession is the beginning and continuation of generational groups. Second, the MST process is not bound to personal characteristics, traits, or designated leaders. The MST is the process of applying servant leadership attitudes and behaviors for succession. Third, generation under the MST construct encompasses groups to include, but is not limited to, individuals, families, organizations, nations, and mankind. Fourth and final, servant leadership in the context of MST is a system of leadership built on timeless biblical principles from which all other leadership theories spring: Servant leadership actuates succession. With this in mind, more research is needed to explore, explain, and validate the MST.\n\nThe Impact of Transformational Leadership on Successful Succession in Philanthropic Family Organizations\n\nJ. Todd Nichols | 2023\n\nAbstract\n\nSuccessful succession in philanthropic family organizations was analyzed through the lens of transformational leadership theory. The methodology used was a hermeneutic guided interview approach. Nine participants from four philanthropic family organizations participated in the research. In vivo coding, based in grounded theory methodology, was used to analyze each narrative. The coding stages follow: open coding (to see what themes emerge), axial coding (to ascertain the linkages between these themes), and selective coding (to make sense of the megathemes and examine the work from a holistic view). Eighteen noteworthy codes with three subcodes were identified. From these codes, three megathemes emerged: values, factors shaping succession, and leadership. Selective coding identified three primary themes: spirituality, strength of family relationships (loving, nurturing relationships, and communication), and succession as an elemental and organic process. Finally, these three megathemes were analyzed through the lens of transformational leadership theory attributes of individualize consideration, intellectual stimulation, inspirational motivation, and idealized influence. The analysis found that aspects of transformational leadership were observed in each philanthropic family organization. However, transformational leadership was not the only leadership style identified. Ultimately, successful succession occurred through the strength of family relationships, aspects of spirituality based in orthodoxy or orthopraxy, and that succession was an elemental and organic process.\n\nLeadership Presence Within Transformational Pastoral Leadership: An Exegesis of Matthew 16\n\nDoreen F. Oconnor | 2023\n\nAbstract\n\nThis study examined transformational pastoral leadership and ecclesial leadership presence through a sociorhetorical analysis of Matthew 16. The study of transformational pastoral leadership was derived from the literature on transformational leadership and distinguished through studies specific to the ecclesial context. Furthermore, leadership presence literature was reviewed, as was case study research on the burgeoning field of ecclesial leadership presence to establish behaviors and skill sets recognized as increasing perceptions of leadership effectiveness. The research applied exegetical methodologies of sociorhetorical criticism and included rhetorolect analyses, as well as analysis of the textural layers. The exegetical study provided data to assess support for the constructs of transformational pastoral leadership, including idealized influence, inspirational motivation, intellectual stimulation, and individual consideration within the ecclesial context. Furthermore, the data were compared to behaviors and skills recognized as contributing to principles of ecclesial leadership presences. The exegesis supported the four constructs of transformational pastoral leadership and provided guidance in the application of these constructs to the modern ecclesial context. The study provided limited support for the behaviors and skills that support ecclesial leadership presence as a method for increasing perceptions of leadership effectiveness and furthermore recommends additional exegetical study to develop operational definitions that will guide the expectations of these behaviors and skills.\n\nLeadership in Lutheran Church-Missouri Synod (LCMS) Universities: An Exploration of Perceived Organizational Support and Motivation to Lead in Relation to Gender, Marital Status, and Parental Status\n\nKellie Playter | 2023\n\nAbstract\n\nThere is a lack of women in leadership in organizations worldwide, but especially in Christian higher education (Longman & Anderson, 2016). While some research has been conducted to better understand this phenomenon in Christian universities, only one other study to date has examined gender differences in Lutheran Church-Missouri Synod (LCMS) universities that are part of the largest Protestant school system in the United States (Concordia University System [CUS], n.d.). With student bodies becoming increasingly diverse, it is even more important to have women and diversity among presidents and senior leadership because “leadership must reflect the voices of those served” (Hsu, 2021, p. 35). The purpose of this quantitative study was to better understand why there is a lack of women in senior leadership roles across the CUS, which is overseen by the LCMS, and compare perceptions of perceived organizational support (POS) and motivation to lead (MTL) by gender. In addition, marital status and parental status were considered to see if there was also a significant difference in POS and MTL within these groups. An online survey was distributed to full-time faculty and staff at three LCMS universities in the CUS. The data were analyzed through several t tests. While it was hypothesized that there would be significant differences in POS and MTL by gender, no support was found. There was also no significant differences in POS and MTL by parental status and marital status except for one significant difference between married and unmarried faculty and social-normative MTL. This finding demonstrates that married employees feel a stronger sense of duty to be leaders in their LCMS institutions. Other findings and directions for future research are discussed. While the results may not be generalizable to all Christian universities, it can help the seven LCMS universities across the United States better understand gender dynamics among their faculty and staff and help advance more women into senior leadership roles in the future.\n\nLeader-Follower Development: The Relationship Between Followers’ Perception of a Leaders’ Implicit Followership Theory and Psychological Empowerment\n\nLance Patrick Reichenberger | 2023\n\nAbstract\n\nIn the post-COVID-19 workplace, the devastation to the supply chain and corporate boards turned upside down as the world went home to work. Understanding and nurturing the leader-follower relationship is required for organizations to survive such challenges. It is time to put the followers first instead of the shareholders, as the followers bring success to the shareholder. This is the first empirical study focused on the human resource side of the business by expanding the critical follower-centered theories. The implicit followership theory (IFT) and concept of psychological empowerment (PE) can change how organizations attract, maintain, and grow their teams. The current dissertation was designed and undertaken to prove a relationship between IFT and PE to determine how to psychologically empower followers through a thorough understanding and growth of the post-millennial generations. This dissertation was designed as a quantitative correlation study with 24 hypotheses tested. The dissertation required a minimum of 128 respondents, as estimated using G*Power. A complex SurveyMonkey questionnaire was created and distributed via targeted emails, social media campaigns, and Slack direct to leaders and managers in the technology industry. The managers completed and IFT Likert scale instrument for each of their followers they chose to include in the research, and the followers completed a PE Likert scale instrument survey. To statistically aggregate the data received from the surveys, I used IBM’s SPSS software. The results from SPSS showed that a few variables and hypotheses were statistically significant and correlated, ranging from -.3 to .92 with a p < .05 within the Good Citizen, Conformity, and Insubordination of the IFT. These findings proved that the leader’s perception of their followers and the follower’s direct report of their PE are associated. The results determined that organizations and academia can benefit from the study, catapulting followership and leadership homogeny.\n\nSelf-Awareness and Development of Leader Self-Identification During Ascension to Judgeship: An Interpretative Phenomenological Analysis of Black Women Judicial Leaders\n\nMeghan N. Rivers | 2023\n\nAbstract\n\nIn 2022, Black women occupy a special place in the American judiciary and their occupation, leadership, and relevance as judges, beyond a mere demographic head count, are largely unexamined and misinterpreted. Within an interpretative phenomenological study of nine Black judicial leading women serving as active state or federal judges, this study answered three inquiries: What are the lived experiences that contributed to the success of Black women’s ascendancy from attorney to judicial leadership (judgeship), what factors contribute to the engagement experience and cognitive framework of Black women judges in their respective leadership roles in the judiciary, and to what degree does the culture within the judiciary and values within the legal profession impact the career progression of Black women? The literature review revealed that this investigation serves as a genesis for thorough empirical investigation of judiciary leaders representing this marginalized demographic. The findings indicated that these unique judicial leaders exhibited strong leader identity recognizing exceptionality within formative years. Established and realized self-identity of both leadership and minority identity, along with a strong desire to serve, exist as primary themes within this investigation. This and other nuanced thematic findings are presented within four categories: (a) the disposition, (b) the periphery, (c) the robe, and (d) the relationships. Overall, this study revealed multiple factors influencing Black women’s lived experiences of ascension from the attorney to state or federal judgeships.\n\nAn Investigation of Authenticity in Judges 4\n\nDeLoria Coleman Savoy | 2023\n\nAbstract\n\nImportant to Christianity is developing an understanding of the engagement of biblical context and contemporary relevance. Interpreting Scripture responsibly, studying the Word of God faithfully is necessary for gaining wisdom in applying biblical truth to living present-day. Authentic leadership, along with authentic followership, is taking space in present-day scholarly discussion. The social and cultural, moral, and ethical climate conditions are declining, and the well-being of one is not a consideration of another. Much of that decline is being blamed on modern leader behavior and people’s dismissal of basic concern for each other. This study investigated Judges 4 for the contemporary principles of authenticity as demonstrated by the behavior of the characters Deborah, Barak, and Jael. Judges 4 is a story of individuals acting out of authenticity in contradiction to their societal role customs for purposes greater than their individual preservation. The investigative process employed socio-rhetorical criticism as the analytic to organize and argue for the presence of the authenticity construct in biblical times. The investigation yielded inference of individual authenticity in character behavior in Judges 4.\n\nParadox and Transition: Exploring Women Veteran’s Leadership Identity Construction From Military Leader to Civilian Leader\n\nAmelia Frances Underwood | 2023\n\nAbstract\n\nThe purpose of this qualitative phenomenological research study was to explore the lived experiences of women veteran leaders and how they constructed and negotiated their leadership identity as they transitioned from leaders in active-duty military service to leaders in the civilian workplace. This study’s intersectional approach investigated the lived experiences of five noncommissioned officer women veterans and five officer female veteran leaders who currently or have served in a civilian leadership position. I applied Schlossberg’s (1981) 4S’s of transition (situations, self-directed actions, supports, and strategies) to better understand women veterans’ perceptions of their transitional experiences from military leader to civilian leader. Eight themes emerged in this study that addressed how the military-to-civilian (MTC) transition process positively and negatively impacted the participants’ perceptions of their leadership identity. As women combat veterans, all of the participants in this study expressed great pride in their military service and readily claimed their veteran status within their civilian work environments. The participants identified positive impacts of MTC to include valuable relationship-building with other military women and women veterans and an increased desire to help other women in the workplace. The participants experienced a multitude of struggles following MTC to include homelessness, posttraumatic stress disorder, alcohol addiction, legal trouble, serious health issues, grieving the loss of a spouse and fellow servicemembers, financial difficulties, and feeling a sense of loss that deteriorated their perceptions of themselves as leaders. The participants shared how their MTC transition offered them new insights into their leadership identity to include increased levels of empathy and understanding of others while also recognizing the need to establish personal and professional boundaries, speak up more, delegate more, and regulate their emotions. The findings indicated that women veterans require additional time, networking skills training, and opportunities to network such as virtual and in-person conferences before, during, and after MTC. Recommendations included civilian organizations efforts to recognize women veteran’s military contributions while also building communities of support for transitioning women veterans in their workplaces.\n\nToward Understanding the Mental Drivers of Transformational Leadership Behaviors\n\nMegan Weinkauf | 2023\n\nAbstract\n\nUnderstanding what drives transformational leadership (TL) behavior is a growing interest for researchers (Bauman, 2013; Gardner et al., 2011; Hurst, 2012; North, 2017; North et al., 2019; Rock, 2010; Yukl, 2012). To answer the call, this dissertation specifically sought to understand the mental drivers of TL behavior. Downtown (1973) sparked a movement to develop the theory of TL stemming from dissatisfaction with charismatic leaders’ actions not aligning with their words. Burns (1978), Bass (1985), and then Bass and Avolio (1992) answered the call of Downtown and built out the TL theory and framework. Hartman (1967) developed a way to understand thought patterns through value theory and the Hartman Value Profile. Blanchard (2003) built upon the work of Hartman and developed the Habit Finder Assessment, which provides a way to understand how mental drivers support or sabotage your behavioral efforts. The Multifactor Leadership Questionnaire (5X Short) in the study assessed TL behaviors and the Habit Finder Assessment to understand the mental drivers. In the hypotheses testing, each category of the Habit Finder (My Dreams, My Joy, My Self, People, Work, and Structure) was analyzed through Pearson correlation to determine a relationship. The relationship between TL and the Habit Finder People construct was β = .18 and p = .03. Although statistically weak, it is still significant due to the other factors in evaluating the complexities of human behavior and mental drivers (Pearl & Mackenzie, 2018). The amount of variance HF-People accounts for predicts or explains in TL behaviors unique to itself is significant. That means the HF-People score explains something in TL that the other five areas of Dreams, Joy, Self, Work and Structure did not explain. Thus, HF-People uniquely explained a significant amount of variance in TL behaviors. Additionally, the People category of the Habit Finder provided a level of correlation with TL. Although the other categories of the Habit Finder did not have a direct correlation, each habit within every category impacts the habits of thinking about people.\n\nDiverse Models of Change Agency: Sitting at the Table of the Black Church\n\nLionel Frazier White II | 2023\n\nAbstract This qualitative study explored the radical and revolutionary change agency of the Black church, looking to understand better the church’s impact on its congregation and community. Because research often selects who is readily available or who is preferred, this study focused on identifying the Black church’s diverse, underresearched perspectives. Lastly, the goal was to not summon the church to the table of research but for research to take a seat at the table of the Black church. It is enlightening, in recalling the traditions of the Black church, that qualitative study allows for the tradition of the testimony to be a vehicle for scientific research. It will be interesting if the use in a secular purpose will revive the practice in the religious context.\n\nAn Examination of Participative Leadership Theory in the Advice Given to Moses by Jethro: A Socio-Rhetorical Analysis of Exodus 18:13-27 and Deuteronomy 1:9-18\n\nShomari L. White, Sr. | 2023\n\nAbstract\n\nThis study examines participative leadership theory and the leadership adjustments made by Moses in Exodus 18:13–27 and Deuteronomy 1:9–18. Socio-rhetorical interpretation was utilized as the tool of exegetical investigation. Participative leadership creates an avenue for leaders to share power and delegate decision-making to subordinates. When organizations share leadership opportunities, it enhances job satisfaction, organizational buy-in, and proper citizenship and behavior. As Moses led the children of Israel, their administrative, judicial, and organizational structure was unsustainable. Moses acted as the sole authority and judge for all things. At Sinai, Jethro advised Moses concerning his poor administrative, judicial, and organizational systems and alerted him that leadership burnout and follower fatigue would soon follow. The Deuteronomy section of the pericope provides Moses’ reflection and transparency concerning his burdensome leadership duties. The research analyzes the pericope to look at how Moses adjusted his leadership. Jethro gave Moses specific instructions detailing how to choose participants to assist in leadership properly.\n\nCultivation of Instantaneous Leaders: A Phenomenological Study of Military Leaders’ Cultural Acceptance in Civilian Organizations\n\nTimothy Michael White | 2023\n\nAbstract\n\nThis study contributed to the betterment of the organizational leadership development process by examining the military leader transitionary process and the experiences of separated military leaders within their follow-on civilian positions. The results shed light on the critical elements of successful integration practices. These realizations can alleviate veterans’ challenges and offer civilian organizations a leadership development alternative that can decrease the cost of leadership recapitalization, increase the quality of their organizational workforce, and realize a more robust, effective, and efficient organizational structure. This phenomenological examination revealed and established veteran leaders’ experiences in their transition. The purposefully selected sample included eight retired military leaders from the U.S. Department of Defense, each with 20 years or more of military experience, who completed comprehensive interview. The findings generated a satisfactory saturation level through the use of in vivo, concept, and comparative coding, resulting in 20 codes arranged into the six themes of culture challenge, culturally disenfranchised, culturally stable, develop cohesive organization, develop cross-cultural education, and learned understanding. The responses indicated that even though cultural acceptance exists, a greater bias exists at the civilian organization’s supervisor, peer, subordinate, and overall cultural levels. Further, the responses indicated a bias by the veterans toward civilian organizations, which exacerbated the veterans’ civilian organizational disenfranchisement. The responses also indicated that the cultural acceptance occurred due to a learned understanding of the differing cultures and that civilian organizations could benefit from adopting a few military traditions to generate veteran understanding and organizational esprit de corps. This study represents a significant contribution to the body of knowledge by addressing and partially filling a research gap, providing civilian organizations with the information to address glaring inadequacies in their cultural biases toward veteran leaders in order to render solutions to the challenge. In doing so, a civilian organization could provide a vast supply of readily trained and operationally tested leaders to augment its leadership departments and prepare for future organizational changes.\n\nRelationship Between Followership and Psychological Empowerment Among Church Employees\n\nZachary Whitt | 2023\n\nAbstract\n\nThere is much leadership research focusing on the leader, but not as much centering on the follower. An understanding of followership is a critical component of successful leadership and will contribute to an organization’s success; however, there has been a lack of focused study in the field of implicit followship theories (IFTs), particularly among nonsecular organizations and populations. Furthermore, IFTs remain primarily an academic concept that is rarely considered for nonacademic use. A broader understanding of IFTs could lead to an improved understanding of the interconnection of leadership and followership. Therefore, the purpose of the current quantitative study was to examine whether a correlation exists between followership types and psychological empowerment among evangelical church employees. The sample included 69 evangelical church employees in North Carolina who completed an online survey. The findings revealed that critical independent thinking is associated with competence and impact. Church employees who exhibited greater independent critical thinking reported greater competence and impact. Additionally, active participation is associated with meaning, competence, self-determination, and impact. Church employees who reported more active participation reported more meaning, competence, self-determination, and impact. Some of these correlations are weak, however, and should therefore be interpreted with caution. The current study added to the literature through an examination of IFTs for nonacademic use. The findings are consistent with Kelly’s (1992) theory, as well as the conclusions of previous studies. Identifying the distinction between exemplary and alienated followers may be important for understanding the association between individual critical thinking and psychological empowerment.\n\nExamining the Role of Courageous Followership in Avoiding or Overcoming the Dark Side of Leadership: A Socio-Rhetorical Analysis of Jeremiah 23\n\nMark Atterson | 2022\n\nAbstract\n\nOrganizations can naively embrace visionary leadership without understanding the dark side of leadership, which surfaces at the highest levels of government, non-profit organizations, and for-profit organizations. The dark side of leadership can perpetuate toxic, inactive followership and lead to tragic results in organizations and society. In the current study, the researcher explored Jeremiah 23 and sought to better understand the role of courageous followership in avoiding or overcoming the dark side of leadership. The current research fills gaps in the literature concerning more socio-rhetorical studies in the Hebrew Scriptures, especially concerning organizational leadership constructs. Jeremiah 23 is an antecedent passage for many of the shepherd metaphors found in the New Testament. The pericope provides a window into ancient Judah’s fall into toxicity and the divine solution of YHWH. The dark side of leadership and courageous followership are theories that surfaced in the passage. Because of the gaps in the literature regarding these theories, this research provided new and fresh insight into the Jeremiah 23 pericope. The researcher sought to answer three research questions. First, what does a socio-rhetorical analysis of Jeremiah 23 uncover concerning the dark side of leadership and courageous followership? Second, what is the role of courageous followership in avoiding or overcoming the dark side of leadership from Jeremiah 23? Third, how do biblical models of leadership and followership, discovered in Jeremiah 23, compare and contrast with contemporary models of the dark side of leadership and courageous followership? The researcher utilized Robbins’ (1996b) socio-rhetorical textural method for analysis adjusted for the time and place of Judah, pending the fall to Babylon. The analysis included an inner, inter, social and cultural, ideological, and sacred textural analysis of Jeremiah 23. The results of the analyzed data are recorded in Chapter 4. The researcher concludes Chapter 5 with a discussion of the data, answering why this study is relevant and valuable along with practical implications for secular and ecclesial organizations.\n\nThe Effect of Moral Development and Moral Identity on Integrity\n\nTom Clark | 2022\n\nAbstract\n\nThis study assessed two personal level concepts—moral development and moral identity—to provide greater insight into how they influence moral integrity, with the ultimate goal of illuminating organizational effectiveness in teaching integrity and developing honesty and integrity in emerging leaders. In the end, the study addressed one of the most pressing leadership issues today: individual character development. The study followed a cross-sectional, quantitative, survey-based approach using a combined, three-part instrument to gather data from college-level participants enrolled in an established leader development program. This approach provided relative ease and efficiency in collecting data from numerous participants to test the hypotheses expeditiously and avoid biases. The combined instrument included the Defining Issues Test-2, which measures moral development; the Moral Identity Measure, which measures moral identity; and the Integrity Scale, which measures integrity. The findings supported the research hypotheses, indicating that a leader’s moral development and moral identity have a positive effect on the moral integrity that the leader exhibits. The paper concludes by recommending practical steps to enhance moral development and internalized moral identity—the strongest predictor of integrity based on the findings—and how integrity is taught and developed as a character virtue in leadership development programs.\n\nLeadership Standards of Excellence: A Qualitative Case Study of One High-Performing, High-Poverty Philadelphia High School\n\nPriscilla J. DuBose | 2022\n\nAbstract\n\nJulia R. Masterman has been one of the best-performing public secondary schools in Philadelphia and across the nation. Its high performance has exceeded expectations despite the challenges faced by the school, especially the location. The school is in a high-poverty neighborhood. This research, therefore, examined the impact of leadership on the school’s performance. The literature review section shows the direct correlation between leadership and achieving the set goals and objectives. Some of the most used leadership theories in high schools and the education sector, in general, include authentic leadership theory and the theory of academic performance. The qualitative study collected data using semi structured interview questions. Twelve participants answered six questions each. These participants were from the leader and nonleader levels: six from each group. After analyzing the data using NVivo software and the thematic data analysis method, 25 codes were identified, which were incorporated within 14 themes. These 14 themes concentrated on various issues, including the importance of prioritizing the process, supporting the teachers, collaborating and communicating effectively with the community and parents, and optimizing the school’s resources. All these were made possible by the leadership of Julia R. Masterman. The research is, however, not foolproof, as exhibited by the identified limitations. These limitations are a guiding factor to the recommendations given for future research.\n\nWhen the Goal is Perfection: Exploring Leadership Styles and Perfectionism\n\nKristen Marie Estorge | 2022\n\nAbstract\n\nThis study was designed to examine the relationship between leadership styles and perfectionism among coaches, gym owners, and judging officials at public and private gymnastics clubs throughout the Southeast region of the United States. The participants were considered leaders according to standards implied by Gandolfi and Stone (2016). The Multi-Factor Leadership Questionnaire (MLQ) Form 5XShort (Bass & Avolio, 1995) and the Multi-Dimensional Perfectionism Scale (Hewitt & Flett, 1991) were administered to 31 male and female individuals active in the gymnastics community in the southeastern United States. Gender, organizational tenure, organizational type (public or private), organizational profit orientation, for-profit and nonprofit organizational status, and organizational status/role were also obtained. Positive significant relationships (p < .05) were found between transactional leaders and other-oriented perfectionism and the transactional leadership subscales of contingent reward and management by exception (active). Moreover, negative significant relationships (p < .05) were also found between the leader’s identification with self-oriented perfectionism and one of the subscales of passive–avoidant leadership, namely laissez-faire. In conclusion, transactional leaders (Bass & Avolio, 1995) are more likely to possess other-oriented perfectionism (Hewitt & Flett, 1991), whereas self-oriented perfectionists are less likely to perform as transactional (laissez-faire) leaders in their gymnastics role.\n\nThe Amplification of Organizational Virtuousness Through Community at Work: Impact on Energy and Identity\n\nPerry E. Geue | 2022\n\nAbstract\n\nThe intent of this study was to investigate how virtuousness in the workplace is amplified to characterize the organization as a whole as evidenced by its effect on the energy and identity of employees. Cameron, Mora, Leutscher, and Calarco’s (2011) positive practices, comprised of six dimensions (respect, care, support, inspiration, meaning, and forgiveness), were used to measure organizational virtuousness, while energy and identity were measured, respectively, by work engagement and organizational identification. The mechanism for amplification explored in the study was a form of social capital comprised of high-quality connections between employees or the formation of a community at work. Thus, in this nonexperimental, cross-sectional, quantitative study, the mediation by community at work of the positive relationship between organizational virtuousness and the outcomes of work engagement and organizational identification was investigated by administering a questionnaire survey at Memorial Hospital in Jacksonville, Florida. Controlled for in the study were gender, age, job tenure, autonomy, and positive work-related identity. Baron and Kenny’s (1986) method was used to test for mediation. Results showed no mediation by community at work of the relationship between organizational virtuousness (or its subdimensions) and work engagement, while the relationship between organizational virtuousness (and its subdimensions) and organizational identification, though not significant, showed inconsistent (Kenny, 2018; MacKinnon, Fairchild, & Fritz, 2007) or indirect (Hair et al., 2021; Zhao, Lynch, & Chen, 2010) mediation by community at work (except for meaning). Interestingly, both the meaning dimension of organizational virtuousness, and the control variables of autonomy and positive work-related identity, were positively related to both of the outcomes—work engagement and organizational identification. The findings suggest that the formation of high-quality connections in the workplace facilitate the amplification of organizational virtuousness and its effect on employee identity within the organization, while employees’ experience of autonomy and meaning at work have a positive effect on both their energy and identity, but though related to positive relationships in the workplace, these relationships are not instrumental for this effect.\n\nExamining Agape and its Leadership Implications: A Sociorhetorical Analysis of 1 Corinthians 13 and Philemon\n\nTrevon Gross | 2022\n\nAbstract\n\nThis study examined the agape construct explained in 1 Corinthians 13 and demonstrated in the Book of Philemon. The project reviewed the research history of love across various disciplines and how the concept of love, altruism, and charity function within the ethical, spiritual, servant, and responsible leadership theories. The research used the exegetical tools of the historical–critical method and sociorhetorical analysis. The data were interpreted to identify traits of agape found in 1 Corinthians 13 and exemplified in the Book of Philemon. Further, the biblical concept of agape critiqued the use of love within the emerging leadership theories. The study results yielded eight themes and 15 traits of agape. When applied to the Letter to Philemon, Paul’s interaction with Onesimus and Philemon aligns with many of the traits and themes elucidated in 1 Corinthians 13, which suggests Paul lived the agape lifestyle that he taught to others. Agape overrode the societal titles and hierarchy to create a new familial relationship and a new social structure—the beloved community. The four research questions were answered by this study and future possibilities for research are proposed.\n\nUnexpected Virtual Leadership: U.S. Federal Government Internet Technology and Cybersecurity Leaders’ Perspectives of Trust, Communication, and Productivity During the COVID-19 Pandemic\n\nAmy S. Hamilton | 2022\n\nAbstract\n\nIn March 2020, a significant portion of the workforce in the United States transitioned from physical to virtual work environments practically overnight. Leaders were forced to change how they communicated with their teams as meeting around conference room tables was no longer an option. No longer able to account for a member physically being present in the office as working, leaders had to reassess their trust in staff to carry out work. Despite the change in the work environment, work deliverables that were defined in physical space still needed to be delivered in virtual space and performance still needed to be measured. This phenomenological study explored how leaders adapted their communication, maintained and developed trust, and drove performance during the pandemic in a virtual environment. This research found four main themes: pandemic, geography/time, mission, and leadership/management. This study provides insight into the stress and chaotic experience of information technology and cybersecurity leaders in the U.S. Government during the pandemic.\n\nFollower Experience During Toxic Reorganization\n\nDwayn Hanford | 2022\n\nAbstract\n\nThis phenomenological qualitative research study centered on the lived experiences of followers during a toxic reorganization with the aim of determining follower importance, emotions, and overall potential damage to the organization a toxic leader can bring. The understanding of these lived experiences highlights new variables in the leader-follower phenomenon. This research also adds to the understanding of the impact of a toxic leader’s influence on the organizational restructure from the follower’s perspective. The researcher sought to answer three research questions: (a) In a toxic leader environment, what relevance and value do followers perceive their input contributes to the organizational restructure, creation of new processes, and organizational focus? (b) What impact or difference do long-term legacy followers and short-term temporary followers have on follower satisfaction with the redesigned organizational effectiveness? (c) How do toxic leadership actions during a reorganization, perceived by followers, contribute to follower assessment of the final organizational structure and effectiveness? The theoretical concepts of situational leadership theory, transactional and transformational leadership theory, toxic leadership, and followership, reorganization and change, groupthink, the Abilene Paradox, and organizational climate and culture were used as a baseline for this study. The participants’ responses to open-ended interview questions indicated that a leader identified as toxic conducted reorganizational practices in a manner that would serve his own purpose with little regard to follower concerns. The responses of temporary and legacy employees regarding their leader noted similar observations similar regardless of employee status. In addition, the reorganization degraded the final organizational structure and effectiveness. The findings have value for any leader who seeks to understand follower concerns during a reorganization under a toxic leader. The results of this study are also intended to provide additional insights into the followership phenomenon: if leaders can only lead because followers give them authority, why do followers provide power to a toxic leader?\n\nSolidarity as an Antecedent of Consensus Decision-Making: A Mixed-Mode Study\n\nSusan K. Hares | 2022\n\nAbstract\n\nResearch by Koster and Sanders (2006) into alternatives to Organizational Citizen Behavior (OCB) found solidarity was a possible alternate concept to OCB. This longitudinal mixed-mode study examined whether solidarity and conflict were antecedents to effective team consensus decision-making in the Internet Engineering Steering Group (IESG), a virtual top management team (TMT) of the IETF. The IETF is a standards development organization (SDO) that has developed Internet technology standards since 1987. This research examined the IESG consensus decision-making in the 28 years of consensus decision-making from 1989 to 2016 from five different viewpoints (three different types of historical data and two surveys). Historiometric best practices guided the collection and IPA analysis of the historical data and the open-ended questions from the surveys. IPA analysis examined 3,458 group consensus decisions for group behaviors, with over 39.186 individual behavioral patterns consisting of 1 or more of the behaviors studied. The researcher surveyed all IESG members in 2013 and 2017. Every step of the five-strand methodology used triangulation (data triangulation, data collection, method triangulation in the analysis process [within-method and between-method], and theory triangulation). This web of triangulation used a majority strategy to resolve differences. This research concluded that solidarity was an antecedent to effective team consensus decision-making. Increases in solidarity behaviors in the TMT might increase the effectiveness of consensus decisions in team consensus decision-making. This research examined conflict based on the Jehn’s (1999) Intragroup Conflict Scale, concluding that conflict (task and relationship) correlated to effective consensus decision-making. However, the exact nature between conflict and effective consensus decision-making was complex. Relationship conflict was minimized in the publicly available IETF historical records, slightly dampened in the survey, and expressed in-depth in a set of open-ended questions on conflict. Future researchers may continue to examine the interplay of solidarity and conflict in the IESG and other TMTs in other organizations.\n\nExamining the Relationship Between Strengths Development and Implicit Leadership\n\nShelley Renee Harrell | 2022\n\nAbstract\n\nThis study expanded on the current theoretical understanding of implicit leadership theories and the theory of strengths development. This study combined the implicit leadership theory of Offermann and Coats (2018), which includes nine factors associated with good leaders (dedication, creativity, charisma, well-groomed, sensitivity, tyranny, masculinity, strength, and intelligence), with the theory of employee strengths development, which groups 34 talent themes grouped into four domains (executing, influencing, relationship-building, and strategic thinking; Rath, 2008). Four major hypotheses were tested to assess the nature of the relationship between the two theories. In addition, employees’ gender, educational level, and length of tenure at university were used as control variables. The relationship of the four StrengthsFinder domains with the nine implicit leadership theory factors were investigated in a sample of employees of a West Coast university in the United States. There were 159 (n = 159) valid responses. The results revealed that dedication was significantly larger for employees in the executing strengths domain compared to the other three domains. Creativity was not found to be significantly different when compared across the four strengths domain. Charisma was negatively related to the strategic and executing domains.\n\nGeneration Z is the Boss Baby: What Are Generation Z’s Thoughts on Entrepreneurship?\n\nLaquita Joyner-McGraw | 2022\n\nAbstract\n\nThe researcher of this qualitative phenomenological study aimed to gain a comprehensive understanding of the essence of the meanings derived from the experiences of a group of Generation Z adult business students enrolled in a public college located in Connecticut. The conduct of this research focused on how these Gen Z business students perceive success in relation to entrepreneurial leadership. The study was conducted to gather information about innovative and emerging technologies, strategies, programs, and training this generational cohort has used in order to become successful with their entrepreneurial endeavors. Drawing on previous studies, the researcher’s intent was to provide deeper knowledge and understanding to the literature-specific concerning educational programs, entrepreneurial training, and innovative resources of the era, which could enhance Generation Z entrepreneurs’ toolkit with the knowledge, experience, and motivation they need to be successful. The findings of the study suggest that it is valuable to understand the phenomenon of leadership and entrepreneurship when Generation Z, as new entrepreneurs, becomes the “Boss Baby” and creates novel entrepreneurship education opportunities with a mentor component. This phenomenological study concluded that a Generation Z entrepreneur (a) possesses an entrepreneurial mindset, (b) utilizes technology innovation for financial freedom to drive change, and (c) leads and inspires people to take the right course of action. Generation Z members’ definition of successful entrepreneurship demonstrated this entrepreneurial mindset and skills, as they described the importance of using innovative educational platforms to generate new ideas, reflect upon these ideas, and take a course of action on them in the future with the assistance of mentors. Future research can further help develop the Boss Baby principle by integrating social entrepreneurial leadership theory, experiential learning theory, and generation theory, which were the three major theoretical frameworks that guided the conduct of this phenomenological study.\n\nLeading in Times of Crisis and Complexity: A Phenomenological Study of the Lived Experiences of Leaders at Small Historically Black Colleges and Universities During COVID-19\n\nDavid Mahatha | 2022\n\nAbstract\n\nHistorically Black colleges and universities (HBCUs) in the United States, particularly small HBCUs, are no strangers to crises and unforeseen challenges. Through various challenges, including financial instability, low student enrollment, and accreditation challenges and crises—many beyond leadership’s control—most HBCUs have been able to weather the storm and endure. However, the global COVID-19 pandemic created a significantly unique and organizational-changing experience for these institutions and extraordinary lived experiences for those who served in leadership roles at the institutions during the pandemic. They were dealing with a completely novel, complex, and uncertain situation for which they lacked direct experience, knowledge, and prepared documentation and guidelines. This qualitative phenomenological study examines these leadership experiences and uses complexity leadership, crisis leadership, and HBCU identity as the components of the conceptual framework to guide the research and the critical incident technique as the data collection method. Research findings indicate that HBCU administrators employed leadership styles and behaviors that empowered and fostered autonomy, enabled creativity and innovation at all levels within the organization, and focused on meeting the needs of others.\n\nWhy Leaders Stay Instead of Quitting: A Qualitative Exploration of Organizational Citizenship Behavior Amid Crises\n\nCherie McKinnon | 2022\n\nAbstract\n\nBolino, Hsiung, Harvey, and LePine (2014) provided profound conceptual contributions to the existing literature regarding organizational citizenship behavior (OCB) burnout and fatigue. After the study, the researchers noted that further research into other threats to OCB should be conducted to build upon its findings. The current research study explored OCB fatigue among leaders of varying tenure during a pandemic using qualitative research methods. OCB theory (Organ, 1988, 1997), OCB burnout (fatigue), perceived organizational support, culture (individualistic), and faith and faith practices as related to coping and leading consistently in a crisis among leaders were cornerstone concepts of the study. Sources of inquiry were utilized to better understand potential challenges that may cause OCB burnout in extenuating circumstances. In-depth interviews were conducted to attain the lived experiences of six participants who were identified as OCB leaders from various job industries such as education, film, retail, and ministry. Analysis of the data resulted in the emergence of the following themes concerning OCB in crisis: care for others, diligence, resilience, commitment, team, self-motivation, empowerment, and faith. Research reflections, limitations, and recommendations for further research are presented.\n\nSent by the Father: Jesus as Follower in the Gospel of John\n\nAndrew Oates | 2022\n\nAbstract\n\nA follower-centered perspective on the followership of Jesus is missing in leadership literature. This gap is unfortunate because, by understanding only the leadership of Jesus, researchers and practitioners cannot fully address the leader–follower relationship between God the Father and Jesus Christ. The purpose in this study was to link the Trinitarian relationship of Jesus Christ with the Father to clear followership characteristics between leaders and followers. The emphasis on the follower of Jesus provided clear handles of what an empowered follower with the same goal and purpose represents to other followers. This addressed, from a content analysis, what it meant to be a sent follower with a clear purpose from the Gospel of John and how an exegetical analysis from John 6 followed a spiral of representative, submissive, servant, and revelatory followership and what that communicated about the follower and the leader. Followership is forever linked to the field of leadership through an interdependent relationship. The relationship between God the Father and Jesus completed the followership concept of Jesus when Jesus sent out the disciples, His own followers. This study offered a unique perspective of followership through portraying the relationship of Jesus with God the Father, the characteristics that He lived out, and how Jesus empowered His disciples when He sent them, in the same manner that He was empowered by God.\n\nLeadership in Transition: A Quantitative Study of Leadership Dimension Preferences Across Generational Cohorts\n\nNeftali Charles Olmeda | 2022\n\nAbstract\n\nGenerations come in cycles, and just as history produces generations, so too do generations produce history (Strauss & Howe, 1991). Within those cycles and historical structures, and so too from a leadership point of view, a sense of leadership status and influence arises that varies considerably because of generational differences and cultural forces (House et al., 2004; Lisbon, 2010; Sotelo, 2015). Similarly, at a more individual level, people—followers, employees, and subordinates—perceive the world and those around them differently because of their background, individual characteristics, and needs (Konopaske et al., 2018). Responding to the call to extend the field of study and fill a gap in research to include Generation Z in similar studies, this research used a quantitative, nonexperimental, cross-correlational approach to examine Baby Boomers, Generation X, Generation Y/Millennials, and Generation Z leadership dimension preferences. Leadership dimensions consisted of the six culturally endorsed implicit leadership theory dimensions using the GLOBE Phase 2 Alpha Questionnaire. The sample population derived via nonprobability, purposive sampling efforts. Efforts for recruiting potential participants included emails and social media. Potential participants were asked to complete the GLOBE Phase 2 Alpha Questionnaire distributed online via SurveyMonkey through Facebook, Instagram, and bulk emails where the researcher has a point of contact. Potential participants were also asked to forward the emailed or social media posted survey to anyone who may be interested in participating. Further, the statistical analyses were performed using multivariate analysis of variance via input data within the IBM Statistical Package for the Social Sciences software.\n\nThe Practice of Servant Leadership: A Qualitative Case Study of Watoto Church\n\nJacky Franco Onaga | 2022\n\nAbstract\n\nServant leadership has the capacity to bring about a paradigm shift in organizations, communities, and churches. Although it is older than most leadership theories, its acceptance as a theory and practice has been slow. Perceptions among researchers, academicians, practitioners, and leaders differ as to how the theory can be conceptualized and practiced. Much research has gone into defining the servant leadership theory and analyzing its difference from other leadership theories, but few have examined the practice of servant leadership. The purpose of this study was to seek to understand the practice of servant leadership in Watoto Church. The findings of this study are significant because they provided a critical understanding of servant leadership in a place where it works. The findings highlighted how servant leadership could impact communities and organizations and provide insights and guidelines to leaders of similar organizations. The study employed a qualitative case study design. This study method provided an opportunity to obtain the participants’ experiences, emotions, and feelings. A total of 10 pastors from different levels of leadership were selected using purposeful sampling. These were pastors who grew up in the ministry of Watoto Church’s servant leadership and therefore deemed to have relevant information. Data were collected through in- depth interviews. The in-depth interviews provided an open-ended approach that allowed the researcher to explore and probe to get rich information. The findings confirmed that Watoto Church is a servant leadership practicing church. The servant leadership practices included serving and caring for the community, empathy, leadership development, leadership accountability, character-based leadership, teamwork, and visionary leadership. The results further revealed that servant leadership had benefited and impacted Watoto Church by creating a smooth leadership succession, ownership and loyalty to the ministry, exponential church growth, and community care. Therefore, servant leadership is a good leadership style for social, community, and organizational transformation.\n\nKeywords: Servant leadership, leadership theory, practice, communities, organizations, transformation\n\nLeadership of Human-Machine Teams in Military Environments: An Exploratory Framework\n\nAnna Pierre | 2022\n\nAbstract\n\nThis is an exploratory study in response to two calls (Do et al., 2017; L. Larson & DeChurch, 2020) for more study on how artificial intelligence (AI) could influence leadership skills and behaviors in the future. This study, one of the first of its kind, is specifically focused on how the future use of human-machine teaming by the U.S. Department of Defense could change required military leadership skills. While the use of AI is at the beginning stages of ubiquity in organizations, there is still little understanding of how this technology could influence leadership behaviors and required skills. A Delphi study was utilized to garner expert opinion on the topic. It was discovered that the use of human-centric skills, such as creativity, empathy, and critical thinking, will be vital in the future. Additionally, it was found that there is still uncertainty on if there will be differences in leadership for civilian or military leaders of human-machine teams or how leadership development training will need to change to meet future requirements.\n\nKeywords: artificial intelligence, military leadership, information age, human-machine teaming, shared leadership, machine learning, U.S. Department of Defense, digital age, leadership skills, Delphi study, algorithmic leadership\n\nA Quantitative Study of Authentic Leadership, Authentic Followership, and Organizational Commitment, With Tenure as Moderator\n\nDaniel Sharma | 2022\n\nAbstract\n\nLiterature has presented that authentic leadership was positively related to organizational commitment. The first problem was validating this positive relationship in another setting. There was no quantitative evidence on authentic followership and its ties to organizational commitment, which formed the second problem. The third problem was limited research on tenure as a moderating variable in the relationship between authentic leadership and organizational commitment. The final problem was the gap on tenure as a moderating variable in the relationship between authentic followership and organizational commitment. These formed the fourfold purpose of the current research. The significance of the present study was to bridge these gaps and add to existing literature. Theoretical framework and literature review established that the authentic leadership variables of self-awareness, relational transparency, internalized moral perspective, and balanced processing were positively related to organizational commitment and that tenure provided a moderating effect to these relationships. Authentic followership variables of self-awareness, relational transparency, internalized moral perspective, and psychological ownership were theoretically positively related to organizational commitment, again with tenure providing moderation. Age and education were the control variables. The current research quantitatively tested these relationships with post hoc, convenience, and snowball sampling to a geographically dispersed target sample size of 100 participants spread between North America and parts of Oceania. A single, anonymous, voluntary, and noncompensable Google Forms survey reached the target audience, combining questions from the Authentic Leadership Inventory, the Authentic Followership Profile, and the Organizational Commitment Questionnaire, each reporting their Cronbach’s alpha in the range of .7 to .9. Data analysis was completed using IBM’S SPSS hierarchical multiple regression analysis, where positive relationships between authentic leadership and organizational commitment and between authentic followership and organizational commitment were statistically significant (p < .001). However, tenure’s moderation effects were disproved in this setting. Limitations of this research included nonprobabilistic sampling, uncontrolled variables such as gender, and response bias. Future research could focus on applying the authentic leadership and authentic followership to other contexts, conducting more tests of tenure as a moderating variable, and considering the possibility of how culture or migration might affect how individuals process these concepts.\n\nKeywords: authentic followership, authentic leadership, organizational commitment\n\nBurnout Among Pastors in Guatemala and the United States: A Quantitative Study\n\nBenjamin Louis Stoffel | 2022\n\nAbstract\n\nPastors experience burnout, and there are still unexplored factors that could impact pastoral burnout. Upon examining the literature, no research was discovered that tested burnout between pastors in two countries. I conducted this quantitative study to advance the extant literature by testing for differences in burnout scores between pastors in two different countries—Guatemala and the United States. I tested for burnout as defined by the three factors in the Maslach Burnout Inventory: (a) personal exhaustion, (b) depersonalization, and (c) personal achievement. I implemented a cross-sectional design using a t-test to determine if there were differences in the pastor’s self-scoring of the three variables from the MBI across the two national groupings of pastors. I successfully collected data through an online survey of the MBI from 180 respondents: 89 Protestant pastors from Guatemala and 91 Protestant pastors from the United States. The results showed that personal accomplishment scores varied significantly by country, even though there was no significant difference in emotional exhaustion or depersonalization scores.\n\nOrganizational Culture Influence on the Dimensions of Organizational Learning at the University of The Bahamas\n\nJason Keith Nathaniel Styles | 2022\n\nAbstract\n\nGlobally, higher education institutions (HEIs) face increasing pressure to learn, change, and adapt to survive and thrive in an increasingly complex and turbulent in today’s environment (Alsabbagh & Khalil, 2017; Coman & Bonciu, 2016; Tierney, 1988, 2008). Furthermore, HEIs are the catalyst to create new knowledge that contributes to economic and social growth by setting the framework for technology transfer, shifting demographics, globalization, and the recruitment of diverse students (Habtoor et al., 2019, 2020; Sayed & Edgar, 2019; Voolaid & Ehrlich, 2017). To effectively reduce the stress and strain produced in colleges and universities by the changing environment, HEIs must better understand the internal organizational culture (OC) to facilitate the progression of organizational learning. Important to realize, HEIs have been linked with economic prosperity and development of developing countries; the Bahamas needs to focus on the University of The Bahamas’ OC to determine the present and desired state of OC to bring about continuous improvements strategic redirection for organizational success. As a result, the purpose of this study was to examine the impact OC types—clan, adhocracy, market, and hierarchy—can have on the dimensions of learning at the University of The Bahamas, the oldest HEI in the Bahamas. This cross-sectional quantitative study used the Organizational Culture Assessment Inventory and the Dimension of Learning Questionnaire. The surveys were completed by 154 participants in this study: 15.0% (n = 70) were staff, 13.1% (n = 61) were faculty members, and 17.9% (n = 10) were administration. Additionally, the study examined the control variable of gender. This research indicates that hierarchy and market partially significantly predict individual learning, and adhocracy, clan, hierarchy, and market significantly predict organizational learning.\n\nAuthentic Leadership of Program Managers\n\nBeth L. Wilson | 2022\n\nAbstract\n\nIn today’s global, fast-paced markets, many organizations are shifting away from traditional departmental or functional structures to implement a complex yet more agile project-based, cross-functional matrix structure. A program manager typically leads these project teams with little to no positional authority over the team yet has significant responsibility for the project’s outcome. Despite this shift in organizational and leadership structures, there is a limited theoretical and practical understanding of the leadership skills necessary for program managers to lead their cross-functional teams and successfully achieve their projects’ objectives. This descriptive phenomenological study sought to fill that gap and bridge the theoretical concepts of authentic leadership, program managers, and the factors that define the success of modern organizational projects. It broadens the current literature using a multimethod approach, investigating the perceptions and experiences of program managers and their project stakeholders. This study used a qualitative method of collecting and analyzing data from leaders and members of cross-functional project teams of a multinational product development and manufacturing organization. This study shows that the perceptions of the program managers and project stakeholders align and bridge the authentic leadership constructs to the broader context-dependent, case-specific, and shared-values framework that accounts for a project’s success. It proved that program managers require a unique balance of developed skills and techniques with foundational moral and ethical leadership attributes. It also expands on the nomological framework of authentic leadership. It investigates a deeper essence of how and why program managers’ authentic leadership attributes influence their projects’ success. This understanding is crucial in helping today’s organizational leaders identify and embrace the breadth and depth of project success factors and the program managers’ leadership characteristics needed to lead the cross-functional team to achieve them.\n\nFollower Satisfaction With Leader Communication on Institutional Action of Student Retention in Higher Education During the COVID-19 Pandemic\n\nDebra A. Baker | 2021\n\nAbstract\n\nThis research explored the effects of internal organizational communication on institutional actions with student retention from top leaders in colleges and universities. This study looked at the perceptions of Christian university deans, chairpersons, and faculty on the United States’ west coast regarding the communication practices of their university president on student retention efforts, particularly during the COVID-19 global pandemic. Using a quantitative approach, this research used the Communication Satisfaction Questionnaire and found no significant difference between academic position, gender, or longevity with the institution and their satisfaction of the university president’s communication practices on student retention efforts. Significant findings did emerge identifying the importance of trust between university presidents and deans with the specific need to build trust with department chairs and faculty. Another significant finding included the value of university presidents adapting to emergencies by communicating to all levels of academic employees. A third significant finding was the importance of the president’s longevity at their current institution and the academic staff’s high level of satisfaction with their president’s communication practices. This study presents recommendations for university presidents as they navigate their communication practices when enhancing their leadership role within the organizational culture as supported through the leader–member exchange theory and student success theory. Given the reality of the COVID-19 pandemic’s effect on student enrollment and retention on higher education institutions, leaders must take notice of the importance of retaining students by paying attention to their actions of communication practices regarding student retention efforts with academic deans, chairpersons, and faculty.\n\nUnderstanding the Self-Efficacy and Call of Jarena Lee: A Narrative Case Study\n\nAmmie L. Davis | 2021\n\nAbstract\n\nThe purpose of this narrative case study was to explore the relationship of self-efficacy as evident in the life and ministry of Jarena Lee with her willingness to respond to her ministerial call as a predictor of her performance even though she was denied the opportunity to preach. In such a case, strong self-efficacy belief and determination informed the response to ministerial leadership and achievements among some women and how they perceived and responded to their call. I explored how self-efficacy informs the response to the call of female ecclesial leaders and their strong belief in their ability to excel in ministry. African American females have struggled in the past to maneuver their ways to better leadership positions amid the stained-glass ceiling’s impairments gelded in the church leadership. In this study, Jarena Lee’s account of her call to preach the gospel is the point of reference for understanding how self-efficacy is developed to inform the response to answering the call for women in ministry. My research unearthed Jarena Lee’s self-efficacy in her religious experience determined by her desire to continue battling against societal obstacles in the church regarding women’s leadership positions despite being rejected. Jarena Lee’s strong conviction in her ability to achieve demonstrates how self-efficacy influenced how she recognized and responded to her call to preach. Therefore, a greater level of self-efficacy, based on a person’s attitudes, abilities, and cognitive skills, may indicate a greater level of performance, allowing the person to effectively handle hard circumstances, strengthening one’s self-efficacy and well-being. I discovered that African American women have the capacity to react to their call with confidence as they understand how self-efficacy informs their recognition and response to the call to ministry as ecclesial leaders. Jarena Lee’s autobiography and the other sources used justified the themes related to the four major factors derived from the self-efficacy research. I discovered the social factors such as gender and racial bias did not hinder her ability to exercise self-efficacy beliefs. Therefore, self-efficacy influenced and positioned Jarena Lee to carry out the call; however, it was the inspiration of the Holy Spirit that guided her to fulfill her call with a message of hope to a broader community.\n\nEntrepreneurship and Emotional Intelligence: A Quantitative Evaluation of the Moderating Effect of Emotional Intelligence on Resilience and Entrepreneurial Orientation\n\nMyron Evans | 2021\n\nAbstract\n\nEntrepreneurship is a phenomenon that has been considerably researched in the academic fields of leadership and management. In particular, the entrepreneurial orientation (EO) construct has gained much attention with scholars when examining this concept at the firm level. However, limited research has been conducted on EO at the individual level and the antecedents that influence EO. Literature has also highlighted the importance of resilience (R) and emotional intelligence (EI) for entrepreneurial success. However, the lack of empirical evidence to support whether these constructs influence individual entrepreneurial orientation (IEO) have yet to be explored. The current study examined IEO with entrepreneurs who have engaged in entrepreneurial activity outside of the firm- level perspective with the intention of providing quantifiable answers to the following research questions: To what extent does R positively influence IEO? To what extent does EI effectively moderate the relationship between R and EO at the individual level? I drew on the self-efficacy theory to support the connection of this relationship. I used the IEO instrument developed by Bolton and Lane (2011) to measure the dimensions of IEO. Ciarrochi, Chan, and Bajgar’s (2001) four factors and subscales were used for Schutte, Malouff, and Bhullar’s (2009) Assessing Emotions Scale to measure the dimensions of EI. The Connor-Davidson Resilience Scale (CD-RISC) 25 was used to measure R based on the scales Ayala and Manzano (2014) proposed. I collected data from 156 self-identified entrepreneurs who had 3 or more years of experience and who were either self-employed or operated a small- to medium-sized enterprise of 500 employees or less. The nine main hypotheses and the 36 subhypotheses of this study were tested using moderated hierarchical multiple regression analysis. The findings of the research indicate that R does positively influence IEO and that EI was shown to strengthen this relationship. However, gender, as the control variable, did not have a statistically significant impact on the findings. I discuss the scholarly and practical implication of this study and recommend future areas for research.\n\nKeywords: emotional intelligence, individual entrepreneurial orientation, resilience, self-efficacy\n\nA Study of Junior Naval Officer Development From Their Perceptions of Authentic Leadership Behavior\n\nJason Arthur Grant | 2021\n\nAbstract\n\nThis qualitative study explored the relationship between follower development and the components associated with authentic leadership behaviors based on a research question that inquired how junior naval officers perceived the behaviors of their leaders. The study adopted the phenomenological approach, using in-depth interviews and the guided interview method, to explore the constructs. Leadership styles within an organization are influenced by the behavior of the leader, group dynamics, and organizational culture. The leadership style found in the military can vary in nature for followers as personnel routinely transfer. A purposeful sampling method allowed for the utilization of 11 junior naval officers across ranking, age, gender, warfare community, and location. The data collection was done through virtual teleconference interviews. Data saturation was determined to have been reached with eight interviews; three more interviews validated the saturation. The analysis section discusses how the results were examined. The conclusion summarizes the purpose of the study and how authentic leadership behaviors play a role in the leadership development process for junior naval officers.\n\nKeyword: qualitative method, phenomenological, authentic leadership behavior, development, retention\n\nHow Post-Millennial Soldiers Desire to be Led: Implications for Current and Future Army Noncommissioned Officer Leadership Training\n\nRoland David Hanks | 2021\n\nAbstract\n\nThis qualitative study explored the leadership preferences of post-Millennial U.S. Army soldiers born between 1996 and 2002 and stationed at Fort Rucker, Alabama. This study used structured in-depth interviews to discover firsthand what this generational cohort desired from noncommissioned officers (NCOs). A purposeful sampling system of 20 soldiers enabled a sample that was reflective of the current demographics of the Army in race, gender, and ethnicity. The interview responses provided the data, which the researcher analyzed using a variety of coding methods such as topic, thematic, NVivo, and analytic coding, which provided 34 codes. Secondary coding produced 6 themes, including Army values, confidence, fairness, and empathy. The responses illustrated that post-Millennial soldiers want NCOs who are honest above all else. Post-Millennial soldiers stated they wanted reciprocal relationships with their NCOs characterized by mutual respect, transparency, and constructive feedback. They desire professional, competent NCOs who are role models, coaches, and mentors. Post-Millennial soldiers want organized, stable NCOs who provide a rhythm and routine. They want selfless and empathetic NCOs who put their soldiers’ needs above their own and who understand that life is more than just work. An important insight for NCOs is that they can incorporate what post-Millennial soldiers stated as leadership preferences to become more successful. This study provides insights for senior Army leadership on the outdated condition of its NCO training and professional development education systems. The implications provide recommendations to Army training and doctrine leaders on areas of improvement. This paper concludes with suggestions for further research on this and similar topics.\n\nMultilevel Transitions Aided by Literary Analysis: An Exploration of the Organizing-Historical Framework in the Gospel of Matthew\n\nDipa Halder Hart | 2021\n\nAbstract\n\nThis research explored influence processes and intermediary elements during multilevel transitions to aid traditional organizations to simultaneously transition the leadership and the organization. Although members are not often evaluated in leadership research, the findings of this research suggest members’ responses contribute to multilevel transitions. Specifically, members’ acceptance of new leadership’s authority and willingness to receive their care were found to be influenced by organizational actions that remained clear and intentional, built trust, connected the past and the present, valued their designated future roles, and exhibited a hermeneutic of generosity that did not punish new members who once acted against the leader. The analysis separating the influence processes and t"
