        "text": "W.E.B. Du Bois in Africa\n\nTo commemorate the 40th anniversary of W.E.B. Du Bois' death, and in honor of the centennial anniversary of the publication of his classic work, The Souls of Black Folk, The Rutgers Institute On Ethnicity, Culture, & the Modern Experience organized the first-ever “one book” literary event for the city of Newark in cooperation with the Newark Mayor’s office. Modeled on the successful “One Book” events held in Chicago, Hartford and other cities, in which one city hosts a “book club” involving hundreds of thousands of citizens, the month-long literary event entitled, Newark Reads Du Bois, wsa kicked off at the 23rd Annual Marion Thompson Wright Lecture Series on Saturday, February 15, 2003.\n\nNewark Reads Du Bois was comprised of a series of literary events, produced throughout the city, designed to educate and inspire readers of all ages to celebrate Du Bois’ life and groundbreaking work. Two thousand free copies of The Souls of Black Folk were distributed to Newark residents through the 10 branches of the Newark Public Library, and special programs for students, adults, and the public focused on Du Bois, his classic text, and the history of African-Americans and the African Diaspora.\n\nThe Newark Reads Du Bois literary event festivities officially began with the 23rd Annual Marion Thompson Wright Lecture Series. Part of Rutgers University’s Black History Month observance, the Marion Thompson Wright Lecture Series is one of the nation’s oldest public scholarly programs devoted to the enhancement of literacy in African American and African history in a local community. The series regularly draws hundreds of observer-participants, as well as local dignitaries. With this event being titled, W.E.B. Du Bois in Africa, Newark Mayor, Sharpe James, an enthusiastic supporter and sponsor of Newark Reads Du Bois, attended the February 15th lecture series program, along with several Deputy Mayors, and other city and state officials. “W.E.B. DuBois is one of our nation’s greatest moral leaders and “The Souls of Black Folk” is central to the struggle for civil rights,” said Mayor James. “It is truly appropriate to honor Dr. DuBois and his legacy by fostering reading and literacy programs that focus on his work. It will be a pleasure and a privilege to support this exemplary project.”\n\nOther attendees included His Excellency, Alan Kyerematen, the Ambassador of the Republic of Ghana to the United States. Mr. Kyerematen’s attendance was especially significant as Du Bois spent his last years in Ghana, at the invitation of then Ghanaian President, Kwame Nkrumah, where he became a citizen six months before his death in 1963 at the age of ninety-four. He is buried in Ghana.\n\nAlso featured was New Jersey’s own Du Bois expert and Pulitzer Prize winning scholar, David Levering Lewis, who gave the keynote lecture. David Levering Lewis, the Rutgers University Martin Luther King Jr. University Professor of History, has twice received the Pulitzer Prize for biography for both volumes of his history of Du Bois, including Volume I: W.E.B. Du Bois: Biography of a Race, 1868-1919 (awarded in 1994), and Volume II: W.E.B. Du Bois: The Fight for Equality and the American Century, 1919-1963 (awarded in 2001).\n\nBrown vs. Board of Education of Topeka, Kansas: A Retrospective\n\nOn Saturday, February 21, 2004, the 24th Annual Marion Thompson Wright “Black History Month” Lecture commemorated the 50th anniversary of the Brown v. the Board of Education U.S. Supreme Court Decision, which ended racial segregation in public schools.\n\nThe theme, Brown v. Board of Education of Topeka, Kansas: A Retrospective, reflected upon the impact of this groundbreaking judicial decision and its resonance within American society a half-century later.\n\nRoger Wilkins, distinguished member of the Brown v. Board of Education 50th Anniversary Commission, established by President George W. Bush and the U.S. Congress, delivered the 24th Annual Marion Thompson Wright Keynote Address. Mr. Wilkins is currently the Clarence J. Robinson Professor of History and American Culture at George Mason University, and past chairman of the Pulitzer Prize Board.\n\nDuring the Johnson administration, Wilkins served as Assistant Attorney General. In a distinguished journalism career, he has written for both the New York Times and The Washington Post. While on the editorial page staff of the latter, Mr. Wilkins shared a Pulitzer Prize in 1972 for Watergate coverage with Woodward, Bernstein and Herblock. His highly acclaimed autobiography, A Man's Life (1982), was reprinted in 1991, and he was co-editor with Fred Harris of Quiet Riots in 1988.\n\nAmong an array of public service activities, Mr. Wilkins served as past chair of the Board of Trustees of the Africa America Institute and is a member of the Board of the NAACP Legal Defense Fund. He is publisher of NAACP's journal Crisis and is an appointed member of the District of Columbia Board of Education. Wilkins holds a law degree from the University of Michigan. His book Jefferson's Pillow: The Founding Fathers and the Dilemma of Black Patriotism was published in 2001 and won the 2002 NAIBA Book Award for Adult Non-Fiction.\n\nAdditional 2004 MTW speakers include: Glenda Gilmore, Peter V & C Vann Woodward Professor of History, African, Afro-American and American Studies, Yale University; Joseph DeLaine, Jr., member of the Brown v. Board of Education 50th Anniversary Commission and Briggs-DeLaine-Pearson Foundation member; Cheryl Harris, Professor of Law, UCLA School of Law, and Lonnie G. Bunch, President of the Chicago Historical Society. A video taped interview with Richard Kluger, author of Simple Justice: The history of Brown v. Board of Education, the epochal Supreme Court decision that outlawed segregation, and of black America’s century-long struggle for equality under the law, will also be shown.\n\nBROWN V. BOARD OF EDUCATION 50TH ANNIVERSARY PRESIDENTIAL COMMISSION:\n\nOn September 6, 2002, U.S. Secretary of Education Rod Paige and U.S. Attorney General John Ashcroft announced the creation of the Brown v. Board of Education 50th Anniversary Commission, created to encourage and coordinate activities to commemorate the May 17, 1954 ruling.\n\nSince its inception, the Commission has been working with the Department of Education and the Brown Foundation to “plan and coordinate public education activities and initiatives, including public lectures, writing contests and public awareness campaigns.” The co-chairs of the commission are Gerald Reynolds, assistant secretary of education for civil rights and Ralph F. Boyd Jr., assistant attorney general for civil rights. President George W. Bush worked with leaders from the U.S. Senate and the U.S. House of Representatives to select distinguished Americans from across the country to serve as commissioners representing all of the states where the Brown litigation began (Kansas, Delaware, the District of Columbia, South Carolina, and Virginia).\n\nTHE CASE:\n\nConsidered to be one of the most important decisions ever issued by the U.S. Supreme Court, the case of Brown v. the Board of Education of Topeka, Kansas was argued, from 1952 – 1953, by Thurgood Marshall, legal director of the NAACP. On May 17, 1954, the Supreme Court unanimously declared, “separate educational facilities are inherently unequal\" and, as such, violate the 14th Amendment to the United States Constitution, which guarantees all citizens \"equal protection of the laws.\"\n\nBrown v. Board of Education actually encompassed cases from Kansas, Delaware, the District of Columbia, South Carolina, and Virginia, all of which challenged the constitutionality of racial segregation in public schools that was established by the Plessy v. Ferguson Supreme Court decision of 1896. The Court consolidated these five cases under one name, “Oliver Brown et al. v. the Board of Education of Topeka.” One of the justices later explained that the Court felt it was better to have representative cases from different parts of the country. They decided to put Brown first “so that the whole question would not smack of being a purely Southern one.\"\n\nLessons from the Past\n\nOn Friday, February 18 and Saturday, February 19, 2005, the Marion Thompson Wright Lecture Series celebrated 25 years of bringing African American history and scholarship to public light during Black History Month.\n\nFocused on the topic, Lessons From the Past, the 25th annual conference offered an historic retrospect on some of the most significant themes of the previous 24 years by prominent scholars from across the country. The two-day program acknowledged the many changes that mark the research, presentation and appreciation of the history of black people in this country and beyond over the years of the Wright Lecture Series, as well as the likelihood that the field will continue to evolve far beyond its 19th century moorings.\n\nOn Friday afternoon, February 18th, the first day to the two-day conference, historians discussed changes in African American historical scholarship as a prelude to the Saturday program. The panel featured Professors P. Sterling Stuckey, the University of California at Riverside, Nell Irvin Painter, Princeton University and David Roediger, the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. Professor Adrienne Petty, Rutgers-Newark, moderated the panel.\n\nJames Oliver Horton, president of the Organization of American Historians, and the Benjamin Banneker, Professor of American Studies and History at George Washington University, delivered the 25th Annual Marion Thompson Wright Lecture. Professor Horton is a native of Newark, New Jersey, and along with his wife Lois Horton is the co-author of Slavery in the Making of American History.\n\nOn the Saturday afternoon Professor Margaret Washington, Cornell University, discussed the evolution of the historiography on slavery, and Professor Michael Gomez, New York University, examined the historiography on the African Diaspora. The program drew to a close after a brief panel discussion by younger historians engaged in the new scholarship on black American life. The panel featured Tiffany Gill, University of Texas, Austin; Anastasia Curwood, Boston College; and Miriam Petty, Geraldine R. Dodge Fellow, Rutgers-Newark. Professor George White, Jr., University of Tennessee, and Geraldine R. Dodge Fellow 2001-2002, moderated the panel.\n\nBlack Creativity and Modern American Life\n\nAfrican-American literary and musical voices filled the Paul Robeson Center at Rutgers-Newark, on Feb. 18 as scholars and interested public gathered to explore black influence on American culture through the Marion Thompson Wright (MTW) Lecture Series.\n\nThe oldest and one of the most prestigious scholarly celebrations of Black History Month, this series delved into the traditions of black Americans, those who placed black speech, music and movement at the center of American culture, making it truly distinctive and unique.\n\n“A growing number of Americans have discovered that black voices are at the center of American culture; that discovery has helped guide the nation toward a more sophisticated understanding of its history,” said Clement Alexander Price, co-founder of the lecture series and director of the Institute for Ethnicity, Culture and The Modern Experience (IECME), a MTW series sponsor.\n\nThe theme for this MTW program was not grounded by a specific historical event or cultural anniversary, rather it revolved around the black voice, be it literary, musical or even the voice of movement, in American culture. Series scholars presented the black voice as music, arguing that writers’ words are music in the same tradition as jazz, blues, gospel and be-bop.\n\nKeynote speaker Cheryl Wall, a Rutgers-New Brunswick English professor, borrowed a musical term as the title of her work exploring the voices and literary techniques of black women writers in “Worrying the Line: Black Women Writers, Lineage and Literary Tradition.”\n\nWall has taken “worrying the line” from blues tradition in which musicians worry the line or break musical phrases by changing pitch or adding embellishments - a shout, words or repeated sounds - to emphasize a musical passage.\n\nJust as the musicians break traditional phraseology, so too, did these early 20th Century women writers subvert literary convention and improvise on established literary tradition. These breaks in phraseology account for missing personal and cultural history and include the creation of spectral characters and dream interpretation.\n\n“My aim was to reach more than the few hundred scholars in my field and to inspire fans of black women writers to read and reread some of the classic works,” Wall said.\n\nOne of the nation’s foremost authorities on jazz and black literature, Robert O'Meally, currently sitting as the Zora Neale Hurston professor of English at Columbia University, offered comment on Wall’s work. His presentation; an “Ecstasy of Influence: Celebrating Professor Wall's 'Worrying the Line'\" will follow her morning lecture.\n\nThe afternoon session startsed with a dance by Newark native and Senior Arts High School dance major Justin Dominic Melvin. He was a pre-ballet teacher at the Newark School of the Arts and taught hip-hop at the Queen of Angels School in the city. He danced in the Queen Latifah Show, Amateur Night, Showtime at the Apollo and the NJ Performing Arts Center in the Harlem Nutcracker and Dance Jam.\n\nHis performance was followed by Brenda Dixon Gottschild, a professor of dance at Temple University. Guided by the premise that dance is a barometer of society, Prof. Dixon Gottschild measures the pulse of contemporary American cultural practice. By means of a slide lecture augmented with demonstrations on her own dancing body, she examined the pervasive Africanist presence in American culture and the sociopolitical implications of its invisibility. With dance as the focus and race the parameter, she reveals Africanisms in ballet, modern, and postmodern dance.\n\nRenée Ater, a University of Maryland professor with the department of Art History and Archaeology, explored “Aaron Douglas’s Into Bondage and Aspiration: The Representation of Race, History, and Modern American Life at the Texas Centennial Exposition of 1936.”\n\nAuthor, poet, critic and lecturer A.B. Spellman, formerly of the National Endowment for the Arts rounded-out the lecture portion of the program. Spellman started his career there as director of the expansion arts program and spent the last decade as the deputy chairman.\n\nAn expert on jazz, Spellman is the author of “Four Lives in the BeBop Business; now available as “Four Jazz Lives,” and other works of poetry and critical analysis. He has served on numerous arts panels. Spellman explored “The Black Arts Movement: Social Activism as Esthetic Guide,” during the afternoon. He returned to the Marion Thompson Wright lecture series after a 24-year absence.\n\nWrapping up the series was a live jazz performance by the Steve and Iqua Colson Sextet, followed by a wine and cheese interlude during which the professors and public can confer and socialize.\n\nLaboring in the Vineyard: Scholarship and Citizenship\n\n30th Anniversary of New Jersey’s Largest Black History Month Conference\n\nFourteen previous Wright lecturers and historical luminaries from the past three decades assembled to speak to the 2010 theme in a series of panel discussions examining the past, present, and future of African-American scholarship. Rutgers Professor Annette Gordon Reed, a noted Jeffersonian scholar and the 2009 Pulitzer Prize recipient for her book, The Hemingses of Monticello, gave the Wright Lecture on Saturday, February 20th. Special guest speakers will also include Lonnie Bunch, founding director of the National Museum of African American History and Culture, Smithsonian Institution.\n\nThe 2010 Wright Lecture Series opened with two panel discussions on Friday, February 19th. The Making and Evolution of the Field, featured panelists John Bracey, Eric Foner, Sterling Stuckey, and Cheryl Wall, who explored the extraordinary profusion of scholarship on African American historical narratives and themes over the past generation. Panelists Spencer Crew, James Oliver Horton, Joe William Trotter, and Deborah Gray White examined the role of the scholar as an actively engaged citizen in the second panel of the day, The Scholar in Civic Space.\n\nFollowing Annette-Gordon Reed’s keynote lecture on Saturday, February 20th, afternoon panel discussions looked at Citizenship, History, and Remembering African American Life, an exploration of African American historical scholarship, and the study race, as a contested feature of American democratic discourse and scholarship with panelists David Blight, Bob Herbert and Wilson Jeremiah Moses. The final panel of the conference, What’s Ahead for the Field? with panelists Nell Painter, Bernice Johnson Reagon and Bettye Collier Thomas, examined how the future of American historical scholarship is being shaped by the field.\n\nPast and current Geraldine R. Dodge Fellows at the Institute, Miriam Petty, Rosamond King, George White, Christina Collins, and Mark Krasovic, moderated the discussions over the two-day period.\n\nThe lecture series was co-founded in 1981 by Dr. Clement Price, Board of Governors Distinguished Service Professor of History at Rutgers University, and Giles R. Wright, from the New Jersey Historical Commission. Over the past 29 years, the conference has drawn thousands of people to the Rutgers-Newark campus, and has attracted some of the nation’s foremost scholars and humanists who are experts in the field of African and African American history and culture.\n\n“We know of no other campus, and certainly not of another community, that for so long has generously embraced the new ways we Americans and citizens of the world now understand and honor the historical narratives of Africans on American soil,” according to Dr. Price. “With that in mind, the Marion Thompson Wright Lecture Series is a civic ritual without peer. It is also a prominent symbol of civic engagement, public scholarship at a very high level, and community endearment to lifelong learning.”\n\nThe Marion Thompson Wright Lecture Series is sponsored by the Rutgers Institute on Ethnicity, Culture, and the Modern Experience, the Federated Department of History, Rutgers-Newark and the New Jersey Institute of Technology; and the New Jersey Historical Commission/Department of State. The 2010 conference is being mounted with major funding support from the Prudential Foundation, and receives additional support from the New Jersey Council for the Humanities, and the Rutgers Committee to Advance Our Common Purposes.\n\nBeauty and the Black Body: History, Aesthetics, and Politics\n\nThe evolution in the concepts of black beauty – and how they have changed over time – was explored at the 2011 Marion Thompson Wright Lecture Series, in partnership with the Newark Museum's featured exhibition, Posing Beauty.\n\nBeauty and the Black Body: History, Aesthetics, and Politics examined how the presence and persistence of African Americans in the United States have challenged and reshaped notions of beauty, especially in the realms of art, popular culture, and photography. Deborah Willis, professor of photography at New York University, gave The Marion Thompson Wright Lecture Saturday morning, in conjunction with her exhibition Posing Beauty: African American Images from the 1890s to the Present. Richard Powell from Duke University, whose research examines race and representation in the African diaspora, commented on Professor Willis’ lecture.\n\nAt the time of the MTW conference, Posing Beauty was on display at The Newark Museum, located within the footprint of the Rutgers-Newark campus. Immediately following the MTW conference, the audience was invited to attend a free reception at The Newark Museum to view the Posing Beauty exhibition and enjoy live musical entertainment by The Bradford Hayes Trio.\n\nThe MTW afternoon session featured three distinguished speakers who further examined the theme of \"Beauty and the Black Body\" from their perspectives: Professor Maxine Craig from the University of California at Davis who drew on her scholarship in the field of gender and race studies; Professor Tiffany Gill, from the University of Texas, Austin, whose scholarship looks at the emergence and importance of the black beauty industry in modern African American life and politics; and Dr. Okwui Enwezor, an internationally preeminent scholar, art critic and curator of African art.\n\nDuring a special presentation, Dr. Marc Mappen, historian and former executive director of the New Jersey Historical Commission, received the second Marion Thompson Wright Award in recognition of his steadfast support, and the Commission’s co-sponsorship, of the Series since its inception. The inaugural award was presented to Lonnie Bunch, director of the National Museum of African American History and Culture at the Smithsonian Institution, in 2007.\n\nTaking Good Care: A History of Health and Wellness in the Black Community\n\nThe centrality of health in the history of black Americans was the focus of the 2012 Marion Thompson Wright Lecture Series. New Jersey’s largest and most prestigious conference commemorating Black History Month celebrated its 32nd anniversary on Saturday, February 18, 2012.\n\nThe program, entitled Taking Good Care: A History of Health and Wellness in the Black Community, examined the intersection of health and race in American life. Dr. Joycelyn Elders, former Surgeon General of the United States under President Clinton, delivered the Marion Thompson Wright Lecture, Health Disparities in Black America. Dr. William Owen, former president of the University of Medicine and Dentistry of New Jersey, commented on Dr. Elders lecture.\n\nThe MTW afternoon session featured three distinguished speakers who further examined the theme of Health and Wellness. Dr. Sharla Fett, associate professor of History, Occidental College, Los Angeles, explored the healing work of enslaved women on U.S. Antebellum plantations; Dr. Dorothy Roberts, Kirkland & Ellis Professor, Northwestern University School of Law, looked at the new Biopolitics of Race and Health; and Dr. Priscilla Wald, Professor of English, Duke University, examined the intersections of literature, science and medicine.\n\nAt the time of the MTW conference, Generation Fit, an exhibit on health and wellness, was on display at The Newark Museum, located within the footprint of the Rutgers-Newark campus. Immediately following the MTW conference, the audience was invited to attend a free reception featuring live musical entertainment by The Bradford Hayes Trio at The Newark Museum as well as visit the Generation Fit exhibit.\n\nDuring a special presentation, Rutgers University President, Dr. Richard L. McCormick, received the third Marion Thompson Wright Award in recognition of the university’s steadfast support of the Lecture Series. Previous MTW awards were presented in 2007 to Lonnie Bunch, director of the National Museum of African American History and Culture at the Smithsonian Institution, and in 2011 to Dr. Marc Mappen, former executive director of the New Jersey Historical Commission.\n\nThe Marion Thompson Wright Lecture Series is sponsored by the Rutgers Institute on Ethnicity, Culture, and the Modern Experience, the Federated Department of History, Rutgers-Newark and the New Jersey Institute of Technology; and the New Jersey Historical Commission/Department of State. The 2012 conference received additional support from the New Jersey Council for the Humanities, UMDNJ, and the Horizon Foundation for New Jersey.\n\nThe 35th Anniversary of the Marion Thompson Wright Lecture Series\n\nCurating Black America\n\nIn Memory of Dr. Clement Alexander Price, 1945-2014\n\nSaturday, February 21, 2015\n\n9:30 am – 7:00 pm\n\nThe Paul Robeson Campus Center\n\nRutgers University, Newark Campus\n\n350 Martin Luther King Jr. Blvd.\n\nNewark, NJ 07102\n\nAfrican American history is American history, located at the center of the making of the American Republic. The 2015 Marion Thompson Wright Lecture Series entitled Curating Black America, used the imminent grand opening of the Smithsonian's National Museum of African American History and Culture (NMAAHC) in Washington, D.C., to invite a wide-ranging discussion of the ways we remember the black experience and present it to a diverse global audience, especially as the newest resident of the National Mall readies to spotlight such issues for the world. The 35th annual MTW conference was presented Saturday, February 21, 2015, from 9:30 a.m. to 3:00 p.m. at the Paul Robeson Campus Center at Rutgers University-Newark, in memory of Institute director, Dr. Clement Price, who co-founded the series in 1981 with the late Giles R. Wright.\n\nLonnie Bunch, inaugural Director of the NMAAHC, was the 2015 Marion Thompson Wright Lecturer. Dr. Bunch reflected on his experience launching the Museum and on the importance and challenges of presenting the African-American past. The day’s other speakers explored black history and culture through their experiences leading several other premiere museums and historic sites. Those speakers were: Robert Stanton, former director of the National Park Service; Thelma Golden, Director and Chief Curator of The Studio Museum in Harlem; and George McDaniel, Executive Director of the Drayton Hall Historic Site in Charleston, South Carolina.\n\nThe conference culminated in two special events that began at 4 p.m. at the Newark Museum, 49 Washington Street. They included a celebration of Dr. Price's life and a special announcement renaming the Institute. MTW attendees were invited to a reception in the Museum’s Englehard Court which featured live musical entertainment by The Bradford Hayes Trio. Then, the Institute on Ethnicity and the Chancellor's Office at Rutgers University - Newark mounted a special tribute to Dr. Price’s life and work beginning at 5 p.m. in the Museum’s Billy Johnson auditorium. Invited speakers participated in a moderated discussion about his work and contributions in the fields of public history, African American history, and the public humanities. They included: Pulitzer Prize-winning historians Taylor Branch and Annette Gordon-Reed (Harvard Law School); Spencer Crew, George Mason University; Johnnetta Cole, Smithsonian National Museum of African Art, and Nell Irvin Painter, artist and professor emerita, Princeton University.\n\nThe Marion Thompson Wright Lecture Series is sponsored by the Rutgers Institute on Ethnicity, Culture, and the Modern Experience; and the Federated Department of History, Rutgers University-Newark and the New Jersey Institute of Technology. The 2015 conference received additional support from: the New Jersey Historical Commission/Department of State; the New Jersey Council for the Humanities; the Rutgers Committee to Advance Our Common Purposes; and the Prudential Foundation.\n\nLong Time Here: Prisons and Policing in African-American History\n\nSaturday, February 20, 2016\n\n9:30 am – 3:30 pm\n\nThe Paul Robeson Campus Center\n\nRutgers University, Newark Campus\n\n350 Martin Luther King Jr. Blvd.\n\nNewark, NJ 07102\n\nIssues of policing and incarceration – both locally and nationally - will be in sharp focus as the thirty-sixth annual Marion Thompson Wright Lecture Series (MTW) invites a wide-ranging discussion of the historical developments that have brought us to events in Ferguson, Baltimore, Chicago, and so many other American towns. The annual Black History Month conference will be held on Saturday, February 20, 2016, beginning at 9:30 a.m. on the campus of Rutgers University-Newark.\n\nLong Time Here: Prisons and Policing in African-American History will emphasize, as MTW traditionally does, the ways that history helps illuminate our contemporary world. Ruth Wilson Gilmore, cofounder of Critical Resistance, author of Golden Gulag: Prisons, Surplus, Crisis, and Opposition in Globalizing California, and professor at the CUNY Graduate Center will give the MTW keynote lecture. Two other lectures will be given by Khalil Gibran Muhammad, director of the Schomburg Center for Research in Black Culture and author of The Condemnation of Blackness: Race, Crime, and the Making of Modern Urban America; and Heather Ann Thompson, professor at the University of Michigan and author of the forthcoming Blood in the Water: The Attica Uprising of 1971 and Its Legacy.\n\nMTW will also celebrate Newark's 350th with a panel discussion on the history of police reform in Newark, featuring Newark Mayor Ras Baraka; Junius Williams, director of the Abbott Leadership Institute at Rutgers University-Newark and chairman of Newark Celebration 350; Lawrence Hamm, chairman of the People’s Organization for Progress; and Deborah Jacobs, former director of the ACLU, New Jersey.\n\nFollowing the conference, MTW attendees are invited to a reception at the Newark Museum that will feature live musical entertainment by The Bradford Hayes Trio.\n\nAll events are free and open to the public.\n\nThe Marion Thompson Wright Lecture Series is presented by the Clement A. Price Institute on Ethnicity, Culture, and the Modern Experience; the Federated Department of History, Rutgers University-Newark/New Jersey Institute of Technology; and the Department of African American and African Studies. The 2016 conference received additional support from: Prudential; the New Jersey Historical Commission/Department of State; and the New Jersey Council for the Humanities.\n\nThe Erotic as Power: Sexuality and the Black Experience\n\nThe erotic is often seen as a realm of oppression and danger. But, as Audre Lorde argued forty years ago, it also contains the potential for empowerment and struggle. This tension will be explored as the 39th annual Marion Thompson Wright Lecture Series (MTW) brings together eminent scholars and performers to examine the political and social lives of the erotic in the African American experience.\n\nThe annual Black History Month conference will be held on Saturday, February 16, 2019, beginning at 9:30 a.m. in the Paul Robeson Campus Center, 350 Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. Blvd., at Rutgers University-Newark (RU-N). The conference is organized annually by the Clement A. Price Institute on Ethnicity, Culture, and the Modern Experience.\n\nAt a time in which the pursuit of sexual justice occupies such a prominent place in our city’s and nation’s political consciousness – in ugly national headlines, for sure, but also in the fearless work of local institutions like the Shani Baraka Women’s Resource Center, the Newark LGBTQ Community Center, and Rutgers-Newark’s own Queer Newark Oral History Project – The Erotic as Power: Sexuality in the Black Experience seeks a broad public reflection on these dynamics, guided by cutting-edge scholarship and artistic practice, and dedicated to a more inclusive and just city, nation, and world.\n\nThis year, the Price Institute brings to Newark renowned scholars and performers whose pioneering and award-winning work has powerfully shaped America’s understanding of sexuality’s history and its role in contemporary life. The first is E. Patrick Johnson, a scholar/artist who has published and performed widely on race, gender, and sexuality. His long list of publications includes two ethnographies of black queer life in the South entitled Sweet Tea (2011) and Black. Queer. Southern. Women. (2018) and several landmark volumes on performance, race, and queer studies. Chair of African American Studies and Carlos Montezuma Professor of Performance Studies and African American Studies at Northwestern University, Johnson regularly performs dramatic readings and plays based on his ethnographic research. He will open the MTW conference with an innovative lecture/performance.\n\nThe day’s other speakers and performers will be:\n\nCheryl Dunye, pioneering filmmaker, producer, and actor who emerged during the 1990s “Queer New Wave” with her landmark Watermelon Woman (1996), a deconstruction of documentary film, black performance history and its archives, and queer politics. A member of the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences, Dunye’s has garnered numerous awards, including a Guggenheim Fellowship and an Independent Spirit Award nomination for best director. The Watermelon Woman was restored by Outfest’s UCLA Legacy Project for the film’s 20th anniversary.\n\nMarcus Hunter, Associate Professor and chair of African American Studies at UCLA has written extensively on urban development and the role played in it by race and sexuality. His first book, Black Citymakers: How the Philadelphia Negro Changed Urban America (2013), revisits the neighborhood immortalized in W.E.B. DuBois’s The Philadelphia Negro as it faces dramatic transformations at the end of the twentieth century. He continues this remapping of black urban America with Zandria F. Robinson in their recent Chocolate Cities (2018), which reflects the diversity of the lived experiences and future of Black life in America.\n\nAlexis Pauline Gumbs, named one of UTNE Reader’s 50 Visionaries, is a poet and educator currently teaching at the University of Minnesota and the author of Spill: Scenes of Black Feminist Fugitivity and M Archive: After the End of the World. Working in the black feminist tradition of intersectional analysis and creative community-building, she is a mixed-media visual artist whose Black Feminist Breathing Collages toured the nation and an experimental poet who has been a Lucille Clifton Poetry Prize Honoree and who was featured in Best American Experimental Writing 2015.\n\nFollowing the conference, MTW attendees are invited to a reception in the Engelhard Court of the Newark Museum, 49 Washington Street. The reception will feature food and live musical entertainment by The Bradford Hayes Trio.\n\nBlack Futures: What Seems to Be, Need Not Be\n\nFor its 40th year, the recent Annual Marion Thompson Wright (MTW) Lecture “Black Futures: What Seems to Be, Need Not Be,” honored its long history while looking to multiple futures – of the series, of the field of African American Studies, and of Black America as a social, cultural, and political formation of power – to foreground a tradition of futurism in black intellectual and cultural life, as well as how that tradition and the freedom dreams it has generated have driven movements for change.\n\nThe MTW Lecture is a full-day event featuring several speakers, panels and performers who are experts in African American history and culture. This year’s event included songwriter, producer, and scholar Jason King of New York University; sociologist Ruha Benjamin of Princeton University; and author and filmmaker, Ytasha Womack, an Afrofuturist and Independent Scholar.\n\nThis year’s lecture began with welcoming remarks from the Price Institute’s Director, Jack Tchen, followed by a land blessing provided by Chief Vincent Mann, Turtle Clan of the Ramapough Lenape Nation, acknowledging that they were the first peoples to live in what is now Newark, NJ.\n\nIt was followed by a performance of “Lift Every Voice and Sing” by vocalist A-Larenée Davis accompanied by Sterling Overshown on piano.\n\nNewark Mayor Ras Baraka continued the theme of weaving past and present by telling the audience that “What you want to build in the future should be informed by the struggles of the present and the history of all those that got you here today.”\n\nChancellor Nancy Cantor continued the thread by exhorting the academics and students and members of the audience to “use our tools of technology and humanities to shake things up from what they are, to what they should be.”\n\nTen years ago, the thirtieth anniversary of the series looked back to take stock of its history and that of the field in which it works. For this anniversary, it brought back three of the early MTW Study Club members – Mary Sue Sweeney Price, Larry Greene, and Leonard Muse, who reminisced over their favorite moments of the early days of the series, while looking forward to how the series might more fully and meaningfully participate in bringing about a more just and inclusive future.\n\nThe first guest speaker of the day, Ruha Benjamin, author of “The New Jim Code? Reimagining the Default Settings of Technology and Society”, spoke about her research on bias inherent in AI and other technologies, giving extensive examples from around the world and in the U.S. “People think technology will either slay us – Hollywood loves that trope – or save us, like those who work in Silicon Valley,” she stated, “but technology is designed by people who embed their values into it.” Benjamin spoke of the dangers of using “social credit” systems like those used in China, and how those systems do more to reinforce the ideology of the dominant group than to bring about any kind of better society. She asked the audience, “how do we deal with technologies that unwittingly encourage racist and discriminatory practices through their algorithms?” Benjamin went on to cite how the tech workers themselves can help fight against these systems and mentioned that workers at places like Amazon and Microsoft successfully organized against the use of their tech for purposes they found morally objectionable. Her final slide was a proposition to everyone in the audience: “If inequity is woven into the very fabric of society then each twist, coil, and code is a chance for us to weave new patterns, practices, politics. Its vastness will be its undoing once we accept that we are the pattern makers.”\n\nThe afternoon sessions opened with the presentation of the Giles R. Wright Award, given each year and named in honor of the Director of the Afro-American History Program at the New Jersey Historical Commission who passed away in February 2009. Larry Greene of the NJ Historical Commission presented the award this year to the Newark Public Library for an exhibit marking 100th anniversary of the 19th Amendment titled: African American Women’s Suffrage Exhibit: Fighting for Power and the Right to Vote.\n\nThe day continued with filmmaker and leading expert on Afrofuturism, Ytasha Womack, who spoke about using “Afrofuturism as a Creative Tool for Transformation.” In defining “afrofuturism”, Womack said it is “a way of looking at the future and alternate realities through a black cultural lens.\n\nWomack, who is also a dance therapist, considers her role as a writer and a dancer as intertwined: “It’s storytelling, but also pattern-spotting. It’s creating a space.” She went on to add that while there is intelligence in the mind, there is also “wisdom and intelligence in the body that we must value.”\n\nThe final speaker of the day was Jason King, songwriter, producer and scholar at New York University. His talk entitled “A Brief History of Black Musicians Feeling the Future, from Thelonious Monk and Prince to Missy Elliott and Frank Ocean” spoke of the possibilities black music offers for the future through what he called its bent for ‘getting togetherness’ – prioritizing collaborations and dialogue. “Art proffers us the vision for a future we can’t yet imagine,” King said, “Black musicians feel the future.”\n\nWhen introducing the “Black Futures” guest speakers, the Price Institute’s Associate Director Salamishah Tillet said, “to dream of an ideal world is one thing. To plan, strategize, and execute it as a reality is far more challenging.” Every year, hundreds come together at MTW to do just that.\n\nVideo Footage from the 2020 MTW Lectures:\n\nMorning Sessions\n\nMorning Sessions included welcoming remarks, a panel featuring early MTW Study Club members, and speaker Ruha Benjamin\n\nAfternoon Sessions\n\nThe afternoon sessions included the presentation of the Giles Award and speakers Ytasha Womack and Jason King\n\nAll photos by Fred Stucker.\n\nPlay and Performance\n\nThe 42nd Annual Marion Thompson Wright Lecture Series\n\nWatch MTW 42 | WBGO Interview | The Marion Thompson Wright Reader | MTW Study Club & Friends Gathering-Performance\n\nExpress Newark and The Clement A.
