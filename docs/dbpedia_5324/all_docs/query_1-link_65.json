        "text": "A Proportional Response\n\nWhen Danny, a reporter, learns about Sam's relationship with a call girl, he doesn't write a story about it because C.J. gives Danny a lead on a much bigger newsworthy item in exchange for his silence. The President plots revenge on terrorists as he gathers his advisors in the White House. His foul mood intimidates his new aide, Charlie, a college-age man whose mother was recently killed while working as a police officer.\n\nLord John Marbury\n\nWhen India invades Kashmir and Bartlet worries about a nuclear threat to both countries, he asks the colorful, inebriated Lord John Marbury, a former ambassador to New Delhi and an expert on India, to help with the crisis. A Republican anti-Bartlet group accuses the White House of running an internal investigation concerning recreational drug use by White House staffers as a result of the Lillienfield accusation. Bartlet's daughter wants to date Charlie, and the President worries that the interracial young couple may elicit a reaction from racist hate groups.\n\nHe Shall, from Time to Time?\n\nThe President and his staff prepare the State of the Union Address, but the President becomes ill. His naval doctor examines him in the living quarters. Mrs. Bartlet, a physician, orders various medical tests. She later reveals to Leo--and only Leo--that President Bartlet suffers from Multiple Sclerosis (MS). Later Bartlet further explains to Leo that his type of MS is called relapsing-remitting, and he experiences total recovery after attacks that are induced by fever and stress. Mandy informs C.J. that news of Leo's addiction will be made public. Leo conducts a press conference revealing his stay in the rehabilitation facility for alcohol and Valium addiction. Danny and C.J. kiss.\n\nWhat Kind of Day Has It Been?\n\nAn American Air Force fighter plane gets shot down over Iraq, and, eventually, the pilot is successfully rescued. The space shuttle--with Toby's astronaut brother on board--can't land because of mechanical problems. During a town hall meeting on a university campus, the President impresses college students and others in the crowd with his answers combining fact with humor. While Zoey, Charlie, the President and members of his staff exit the building, gunfire erupts. Who is injured?\n\nLet Bartlet Be Bartlet\n\nTwo members of the Federal Election Commission resign. Sam and Toby meet with military officers and congressmen to discuss homosexuals serving in the military. Admiral Fitzwallace enters the meeting and agrees that he doesn't believe gays should be in the military. But he adds that 50 years ago, no one thought African Americans could serve effectively. And an inflammatory memo that Mandy wrote before joining the staff, which outlines the weakness of the Bartlet administration, surfaces. The President and his senior staff read the memo and find it enlightening. New polls reveal that their job approval rating has just dropped five more points. Leo tells the President it's time to do what he was elected to do, to support the issues in which he truly believes."
