I'll never forget how husband James went off to work on the new Alaskan pipeline, hoping for a break for the family. Except he either died in transit or almost immediately. I remember Rolle holding onto a cloth, a dishtowel or something and crying \"Damn, you James!\" I was only about 11 or 12, but it was hard to take. This is my Good Times memory.\n\nJames returned home to Mississippi to find work. He found a job and the family planned to join him. He was killed in a car accident; before the family moved.\n\nFlorida was holding a glass punch bowl. She drops the bowl and shouts “Damn, Damn, Damn.”\n\n[quote] [R26]. I agree with you. Had they not taken themselves so seriously, Good Times would have lasted more seasons, they could've educated people with some serious topics and Ether Rolle wouldn't have been hawking stupid psychic commercials.\n\nGays seem to understand why gay representation is important. Will & Grace, ground breaking for its time, receives a lot of criticism here. Rolle and Amos rightfully stood up and spoke out about how black people were represented. At a time when a show about a black family was groundbreaking. Obviously they were going to be criticized either way.\n\nI don't blame them for speaking up either. Plus, they were originally the stars of the show. And they wanted more balance to the show. Maybe some of it was ego but turning it from Good Times to the Jimmy Walker Show wasn't fair either.\n\nIt's like Family Matters. It was originally about the Winslows. But when Steve Urkle took off, it became about Urkle, every single episode. I guess the cast didn't care too much since they were getting paid and the show was a hit. But I think Rolle and Amos had a much more personal reason to keep the show to its roots than money or ratings.\n\nDo not agree with some of the above posts.\n\nWhen Mr. Amos and Ms. Rolle signed onto \"Goodtimes\" it was with understanding that the show as going to provide at least some counterpoint to common narrative about African Americans living in urban areas.\n\nThis was the 1970's when whites were still fleeing cities for safety of suburbs, and the common though about African Americans in \"the projects\" were that they were all single mothers scamming welfare, the men where basically criminals, wife beaters, and siring children left and right, but not being involved in bringing them up.\n\nWith the Evans family you had a strong father and mother figure trying against the very hard times of 1970's to bring up three children. Stagflation wasn't the only problem facing the Evans family, but systemic racism, high unemployment for AAs, crime, etc... all were piled on. Keep in mind this was also a time when labor actions in all forms were getting nasty as manufacturing began leaving mid-west/rust belt areas for overseas if not just shutting down all together. Thus what jobs were out there many white men felt should go to themselves, something that didn't help matters at all.\n\nAs the show progress both Jhon Amos and Ester Rolle felt there wasn't enough focus on the two younger Evans children ( Thelma and Michael), who both had high ambitions. Suits basically said \"no body wants to hear about a black kid wanting to become supreme court justice..., just keep on keeping on. Amos and Rolle increasingly were ticked off by how whenever things got serious or whatever out came JJ with his minstrel routine....\n\nIn firing John Amos and writing Jame Evans, Sr out of show suits of Good Times did not only what they promised not to do, but in process made Florida Evans same as many other AA women; a single mother. Not long after even Ms. Rolle got fed up and left the show, only to make few appearances in later episodes IIRC.\n\nOne of the problems was that the writing staff of Good Times was all white - yes the show was created by two Black men - but they left after the first two years, frustrated with their story pitches being rejected by the network\n\nSo the 3rd season (John Amos last) had an all-white writing staff, and that is when the shit hit the wall. As Ralph Carter (Michael) explained, in Black culture the son never over-shadows the father\n\nAnd that is exactly what happened on Good Times as the character J.J. was more important than James on the show. And John Amos & Norman Lear got into so many screaming matches about scripts. It got so bad one had to go, and it wasn't going to be Lear\n\nBut it worked out okay for John Amos - if he didn't get fired from Good Times, he wouldn't have had the chance to do Roots\n\nAnd Amos & Lear patched things up and even did another sitcom together (704 Hauser Street)\n\nR73\n\nFirst and foremost thanks to the economy all sorts of food simply were expensive. In opening credits of Mary Tyler Moore show you see her at supermarket picking up a small packet of meat, looking at the price, pulling a face then tossing it into cart. That was for someone working and (seemingly) middle class.\n\nAmericans were still into eating red meat which was expensive, even cheaper things like ground beef (chuck, never round). Yes, you had things like \"Hamburger Helper\", but you still needed some meat. There's a Mama's Family skit where Mama criticizes Eunice's meatballs as \"dry\". Eunice yells back that she had to use lots of bread crumbs to make a small amount of ground beef (about a pound IIRC) stretch to feed entire family.\n\nLink below gives prices for various items in 1970's. Notice you could get 12 cans of dog food for $1.00 USD. Meanwhile ground beef was $0.98 per pound in some areas.\n\nBest deal on \"cheap\" food was the infamous (or famous) welfare cheese. If you could find it also things like powdered eggs, SPAM, powdered milk, etc...\n\nR71\n\nYou need to read up on history of African American women in this country. Long before (and after) Wilona appeared on television real life WOC were out there making things happen on their own. Many times thanks to racism and other factors they had no other choice as their men were either killed or otherwise absent.\n\nThese women did all sorts of things from founding businesses (Madam C.J. Walker) to opening shops or working as independent contractors (laundresses, maids, seamstresses, etc..)\n\nYes, some of these women did marry (a few more than once), but they still kept their independent businesses going.\n\nWilona represented one of a long line of WOC who for reasons ranging from \"I can do bad all by myself\", to not willing to be held down by trifling and lazy men.\n\nPenny was truly an unbearable character, all all child stars adding to a faltering sitcom tend to be. Despite being an abused child she was very plump and healthy looking. She wanted to be a \"star.\" Some awful episode had Wilona take on a second job as a security person in a store in order to pay for her little darling's dancing (or was it acting?) lessons. It doesn't work out; she is supposed to watch people in the dressing rooms from behind a mirror to catch them shoplifting, but she lets a shoplifter go because she thinks it's wrong to invade someone's privacy, even if the person is committing a crime. Ugh. And little Penny wants to sleep with J. J.! \"Good Times\" was really getting desperate at that point. And weren't characters inexplicably breaking out into impersonations of people like Ed Sullivan and Mae West? Boy, it was getting really awful. The death of James really spelled the death of the show.\n\n[quote] [R89] YES! That was the oddest thing I've ever seen in a sitcom. By the final season, there were several instances in each episode of the characters imitating movie stars. Bookman would do John Wayne, Penny would do Mae West, or Cher, Keith (Thelma's football player husband) would do Clark Gable or Jerry Lewis. I guess it was an easy way for the writers to fill up some time, but man, it stood out like a sore thumb. —Anonymous\n\n“Several instances in each episode?” No but throughout the series the writers did feature the cast members other talents. Johnnie Brown (Bookman) was a stage performer/singer. He sang and did impressions in him stage act. Janet Jackson did her Mae West impersonation as a very young child performing with her family. Janet and Randy did Sonny and Cher songs. Early on the show featured Ralph Carter’s singing. Janet Dubois and Esther Rolle also sang. Bernadette Stanis was taking dancing classes.\n\n[quote]Good Times was not light entertainment, it was a message sitcom and very didactic at that\n\nI think black people and white people receive Good Times differently. It really should be a case study for university students in media perception and modern African American studies. I've heard white people call it dark and depressing to watch. I dont speak for all black people, but if you were a product of struggling black families in the 70s and 80s, you know the real depression that took place then. So for me Good Times was light entertainment.\n\nIf anything they threw in those stats and teaching moments to enlighten white people watching the show. Black people in those times, especially during the crack era, needed no education on that subject matter because we were living it. And by the 80s most network sitcoms followed the Good Times model with \"very special episodes\".\n\nThings have not always been easy for AA actors in Hollywood film or television. Even late as 1990's you still had largely white \"suits\" (directors, producers, etc...) disrespecting actors who were also POC.\n\nDella Reese speaks about how one such producer and some other suits treated Redd Fox on show \"Royal Family\". Treatment that continued to disrespect Mr. Fox even when he had a major heart attack on the set, and after he had died in hospital.\n\nAs already stated previously in this thread POC and whites often have totally different values/views when it comes to parenting.\n\nMike and Carol Brady never raised their voices to their children, much less laid a hand on them. This when they didn't tell the truth (or outright lied), went against explicit orders not to do something..... Mike or Carol would just say \"now, now\" then stand there and \"reason\" with the offending kid. John Amos/James Evans, Sr. had his own ways up to and including going for his strap.\n\nThere was one scene where family was in kitchen in morning having breakfast; James and Florida said something to each other, and Michael popped up with \"gee mommy and daddy get grumpy when they don't sleep together\" or words to that effect. James shot right back \"you want some strap with that oatmeal? . Michael shut up , put his head down and got busy eating his breakfast.\n\nA couple years, back, I watched a youtube video of a Good Times Reunion event. John Amos, Bernadette Stanis, and Ralph Carter spoke so respectfully of Esther Rolle; you could tell they admired her very much. Jimmie Walker still seemed a bit standoffish from the rest of them.\n\nThere was also a \"True Hollywood Story\" episode about the show. Janet Dubois said she believed part of the conflict was because \"in black culture, the son does not rise above the father\", though the JJ character was overshadowing the father character. Ironically, in real life, John Amos is only seven years older than Jimmie Walker. In an interview a few years back, Walker had nothing positive to say about his time with Rolle and Amos. Basically he said, \"I didn't talk to them.\"\n\n[quote] I guess the writers thought it would liven up the show to feature singing and impersonations. It didn't. It just made the show seem really dopey.\n\nIt seems to be a recurring thing in Norman Lear's shows- the once a year \"talent show\" where the main cast puts on some sort of benefit and they each get to perform. Maude did it nearly every season, One Day at a Time and The Jeffersons did it a few times, and certainly Good Times did in later years. About the only show that went unscathed was All in the Family, unless you count the school talent show with Stephanie and Edith.\n\n[quote] It seems to be a recurring thing in Norman Lear's shows- the once a year \"talent show\" where the main cast puts on some sort of benefit and they each get to perform.

About the only show that went unscathed was All in the Family, unless you count the school talent show with Stephanie and Edith.\n\nThere are only maybe 4 episodes of Good Times that featured talent shows. Early on they did it for the Rent Party episode. Later they did it for the Day Care Center episode (featuring Gary Coleman). The last season featured a talent show in the Christmas episode. There was no “once a year.” And I don’t believe this was necessarily unique to Norman Lear productions. Since sitcoms often featured actors (like Bea Arthur) who had had theater careers or who had stage acts; the writers found ways to include that aspect of their talent. It was a win for the writers and the actors.\n\nCannot recall name atm, but there is a film made in 1970's about a AA family living in the project/hood or whatever where the son does something really bad and arrives home to confront his mother. The mother hits roof upon hearing news and tells him to go and get her belt..... Young black man returns without the belt to find his mother sitting in a chair with her head down, he begins to tell her that he's grown or whatever and will be moving out on his own, only to realize in several moments his mother actually was dead.\n\nWas gifted a CD of various OBC and other recordings of songs from Tony award wining shows.\n\nPopped it into player and was astounded to hear young Ralph Carter singing \"Side Walk Tree\" from OBC musical Raisin in the Sun.\n\nRalph Carter had a pretty good theater C.V. for a child/young actor before appearing on Good Times. Role of Micheal Evans put him on map as nationwide star, but afterwards work pretty much dried up. Norman Lear having seen young Ralph Carter in Raisin actually bought out remainder of contract so the young actor would be free to join Good Times.\n\nFirst time saw Michael Evans the young kid pinged future \"family\". He's nearly 60 now and far as one can see never married and still pings to high heaven.\n\nMichael brought a bully home for dinner using the logic that he wouldn't be mean to Michael if Michael were nice to him.\n\nThe kid had major issues; no love at home and he mouthed off or did something and one of the Evans kids said that Dad would whip us for that and the kid says well, he ain't my dad but James decides to treat him as if he were and takes him into the bedroom (I SWEAR I\"M NOT MAKING THIS UP EVEN IF I DON\"T HAVE ALL THE SPECIFICS DOWN PAT) and the kid tries to escape but James pulls him back in and later James says he DOES care about the kid so he stays and experiences, at least for a little while, a family.\n\nI remember that episode.....\n\nWhen done (James Evans, Sr. seen putting his strap back on...) tells the kid if he was his own it would have been far worse....\n\nWhile no hitting was involved, James Earl Jones in Broadway play \"Fences\" shows what many AA fathers did then and now to set their sons straight on life. Bringing up young AA children in USA has never been easy, but for males it was harder because their fathers *knew* what was out there, and could only do their best to prepare their sons for the harsh often racist world they would have to survive.\n\nAn AA friend told me when he was young came home from school one day and asked his mother was she his \"friend\". Apparently the white kids at school called their parents \"friends' and were encouraged to do so by same. Guy's mother hit the roof. She told him those \"little hoodlums you hang out with in street are your *friends*, I'm your MOTHER....\"\n\nIt was a serious subject with Eddie, the tough kid who was taking Michael's lunch money and then later, he's getting a whooping.\n\nLike all of Lear's shows, there was humor in the drama. JJ describing the levels of whooping's in 'dad's repertoire'\n\nEddie's all set to bolt until James says maybe he does care...a little...that night probably changed Eddie's life.\n\nSadly, the actor who played him died suddenly in his sleep a few years ago; late 50s.\n\nRIP EDDIE\n\nPenny's mom was abused by her mom and it was what she knew. When the community looks upon beatings as something that needs to be done to raise a kid, there will be those who go overboard and the kids will be deeply scarred by it. Penny possibly could end the cycle by being raised by Willona but since James and Florida were of the belief that whooping were appropriate, did Willona as well? It was a cop out for Good Times to toss in the episode where she tries to set Willona up.\n\nMs. Rolle fought from the start to make sure she was not cast as a single AA mother. She and Norman Lear (who of course were well known to each other thanks to Maude, etc...), went many rounds before the latter relented and cast John Amos as James Evans, Sr.\n\nAgain what both senior actors wanted was a show that gave another point of view about AA inner city life; a happily married AA couple attempting to raise a family with everything else going on in world that was 1970's. James Evans, Sr. didn't drink, beat his wife, cheat on his wife, sell drugs, wasn't a pimp or any of the other common stereotypes of AA men depicted at the time. He was just a hard working husband and family man trying to do his best against odds that were simply stacked against him (and other AA men) at the time.\n\nEsther Rolle narrated an excellent program by Marlon Riggs called \"Ethnic Notions\". It explored common media images of African Americans well up until after WWII. When you watch it becomes clear what not just as actors but simply POC Esther Rolle and others struggled against, and why shows like Good Times seemed important to them.\n\nYou also see why Ms. Rolle and Mr. Amos got hot about James Evans, Jr little minstrel acts. It was something right out of the past (and noted in documentary Ethnic Notions) ; whenever things got too serious JJ would strut out his buffoon act to peals of laughter. White audiences could now calm down and not worry just as they did when watching mistral shows of old.\n\nSome of you may be ignorant of fact or simply don't know that race tensions in USA were far from over in 1970's. Whites were still fleeing urban areas for perceived safety of nice clean suburbs, but they liked watching the goings on \"in the hood\" from their safe distance. They also wanted to be reassured that the \"black problem\" wasn't going to get too out of hand and certainly not reach the places they went to avoid that issue.\n\nIt is worth nothing that only within past several months (largely in response to BLM riots), that Aunt Jemima, Uncle Ben and several other brands long rooted in depictions of AAs from another time finally are being retired.\n\n[quote] Tradition of beating children goes deep in AA community. It is just how generations of parents see themselves as setting their kids straight. Because Big Mommie or Big Daddy beat them, adults beat their kids.\n\n[quote] Penny's mom was abused by her mom and it was what she knew. When the community looks upon beatings as something that needs to be done to raise a kid, there will be those who go overboard and the kids will be deeply scarred by it.\n\nSpanking was considered acceptable, not abuse, and MOST Americans still consider spanking to be acceptable. You do know that up into the 1980s public schools still allowed corporal punishment.\n\nThe links that some of you go through to portray black people as inferior sub human monsters, even in a silly thread like this, is astounding!\n\n[quote] According to the 2016 General Social Survey (2002–2016), conducted by the National Opinion Research Center at the University of Chicago, 76 percent of men and 66 percent of women ages 18 to 65 agreed that a child sometimes should be spanked.\n\nI grew up in middle class Australia.\n\nI only discovered 'Good Times' about t 5 years ago, when it was played on new free to air 2nd tier stations.\n\nThe first few seasons were amazing but the continuing emphasis on all that was 'DynoMIIIIIte' was grating. I can only imagine how it felt for the two leads.\n\nI had no idea Janet Jackson was going to be in it. It was shocking to see this cultural icon at such a young age.........it was even more shocking to see her do that Mae West thing at such a young age. God knows what happened to that young girl?\n\n[quote] My all-time favorite!\n\n[quote] She was the best actress.\n\n[quote] Damn! Damn! Damn!\n\n[quote] She was so fucking ugly!\n\n[quote] Ugly!\n\n[quote] Poo poo 💩\n\n[quote] She was still ugly.\n\n[quote] I’m on a Rolle!\n\n[quote] R63 why the fuck would someone eat dog food when there is low priced food available with substantial calories? I saw that episode the other night.\n\n[quote] R74 JJ references “Big Macs” from McDonald’s often.\n\n[quote] Who in the fuck would eat Alpo? Unless you were fucked up and actually liked the taste of it.\n\n[quote] R84, pfffft!\n\n[quote] None could sing or dance\n\n[quote] Janet Jackson was 28 when she appeared on Good Times.\n\n[quote] Punch me with your lap!\n\n[quote] I wonder what Penny did while Relona fucked dudes?\n\n[quote] Penny had that stupid band aid on her forehead\n\n[quote] I bet she send pussy spray.\n\n[quote] She was ugly\n\n[quote] Real ugly\n\nAre you finished? Now take your meds."
