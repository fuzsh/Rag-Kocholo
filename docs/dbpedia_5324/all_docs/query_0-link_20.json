        "text": "A native of New Jersey and son of a mechanic, African-American John Amos has relied on his imposing build, eruptive nature and strong, forceful looks to obtain acting jobs, and a serious desire for better roles to earn a satisfying place in the annals of film and TV. He has found it a constant uphill battle to further himself in an industry that tends to diminish an actor's talents with severe and/or demeaning stereotypes and easy pigeonholing. A tough, often hot-headed guy with a somewhat tender side, John would succeed far better on stage than on film and TV...with one extremely noteworthy exceptions.\n\nBorn on December 27, 1939, John was first employed as an advertising copywriter, a social worker at New York's Vera Institute of Justice, and an American and Canadian semi-professional football player before receiving his calling as an actor. A stand-up comic on the Greenwich Village circuit, the work eventually took him West and, ultimately, led to his hiring as a staff writer on Leslie Uggams' musical variety show in 1969. Making his legit stage debut in a 1971 L.A. production of the comedy \"Norman, Is That You?\", John went on to earn a Los Angeles Drama Critics nomination for \"Best Actor\". As such, he formed his own theater company and produced \"Norman, Is That You?\" on tour.\n\nThe following year he returned to New York to take his first Broadway bow in \"Tough To Get Help\". By this time he had secured secondary work on the classic Oh Mary (1970) as Gordy the weatherman. His character remained on the periphery, however, and he left the show after three discouraging seasons. On the bright side, he won the recurring role of the sporadically-unemployed husband of maid Florida Evans (played by Esther Rolle) on Norman Lear's Maude (1972) starring Bea Arthur. The two characters were spun-off into their own popular series as the parental leads in Good Times (1974).\n\nGood Times (1974), a family sitcom that took place in a Chicago ghetto high-rise, initially prided itself as being the first network series ever to be created by African-Americans. But subsequent episodes were taken over by others and John was increasingly disgruntled by the lack of quality of the scripts and the direction Lear was taking the show. Once focused on the importance of family values, it was shifting more and more toward the silly antics of Jimmie 'JJ' Walker, who was becoming a runaway hit on the show as the aimless, egotistical, jive-talking teenage son JJ. John began frequently clashing with the higher-ups and, by 1976, was released from the series, with his character being killed in an off-camera car accident while finding employment out of state.\n\nAmos rebounded quickly when he won the Emmy-nominated role of the adult Kunte Kinte in the ground-breaking epic mini-series Roots: The Complete Miniseries (1977), one of the most powerful and reverential TV features ever to hit television. It was THE TV role of his career, but he found other quality roles for other black actors extremely difficult to come by. He tried his best to avoid the dim-headed lugs and crime-motivated characters that came his way. Along with a few parts (the mini-movie Willa (1979) and the films Beastmaster - Der Befreier (1982) and Der Prinz aus Zamunda (1988)), he had to endure the mediocre (guest spots on Love Boat (1977), \"The A-Team\", \"Murder, She Wrote\" \"One Life to Live\"). John also toiled through a number of action-themed films that focused more on grit and testosterone than talent.\n\nHe found one answer to this acting dilemma on the proscenium stage. In 1985, the play \"Split Second\" earned him the NAACP Award as Best Actor. He also received fine reviews in a Berkshire Theater festival production of \"The Boys Next Door\", a tour of O'Neill's towering play \"The Emperor Jones\", and in a Detroit production of Athol Fugard's \"Master Harold...and The Boys\". In addition, John directed two well-received productions, \"Miss Reardon Drinks a Little\" and \"Twelve Angry Men\", in the Bahamas. He took on Shakespeare as Sir Toby Belch in \"Twelfth Night\" at Joseph Papp's New York Shakespeare and earned strong notices in the late August Wilson's Pulitzer Prize-winning play \"Fences\" at the Capital Repertory Company in Albany, New York. Overseas he received plaudits for his appearance in a heralded production of \"The Life and Death of a Buffalo Soldier\" at the Bristol's Old Vic in England. Capping his theatrical career was the 1990 inaugural of his one-man show \"Halley's Comet\", an amusing and humanistic American journey into the life of an 87-year-old who recalls, among other things, World War II, the golden age of radio, the early civil rights movement, and the sighting of the Comet when he was 11. He wrote and has frequently directed the show, which continues to play into the 2007-2008 season.\n\nIn recent years, John has enjoyed recurring parts on \"The West Wing\" and \"The District\", and is more recently appearing in the offbeat series Men in Trees (2006) starring Anne Heche. John Amos has two children by his former wife Noel Amos and two children. Son K.C. Amos director, writer, producer, editor and daughter Shannon Amos a director, writer and producer. Amos has one grand child,a grand-daughter, Quiera Williams.\n\nSlender, attractive actress Margaret Avery, spellbinding in her role of Shug in Steven Spielberg's Die Farbe Lila (1985), is certainly no \"one-hit wonder\". Although filmgoers may be able to trace her back only to that once-in-a-lifetime part, Margaret has been a talented player on the large and small screens for well over three decades.\n\nBorn on January 20, 1944, in Mangum, Oklahoma, the daughter of a Navy man, she was raised in San Diego, California, where she completed high school. Margaret demonstrated a certain passion for acting while in her teens but decided to pursue a more stable career in teaching. Graduating from San Francisco State University, she joined the Los Angeles public school system as a substitute teacher, but the \"acting bug\" continued to nibble away at her. She auditioned for commercials on the sly and managed to also segued into stage work and singing jobs. Her early 1970s L.A. plays included \"Revolution\", \"Sistuhs\", and 1973's \"Does a Tiger Wear a Necktie?\", the last for which she nabbed the Los Angeles Drama Critics Award. Her skills as an actress helped her to move into TV roles, appearing in such established 1970s and 1980s series as The New Dick Van Dyke Show (1971), Einsatz in Manhattan (1973), Sanford and Son (1972), Der Nachtjäger (1974), Neu im Einsatz (1972), Baby... I'm Back! (1977), Mord ist ihr Hobby (1984), Miami Vice (1984), Spenser (1985), a recurring part in Harry-O (1973), and a regular role in the short-lived series A.E.S. Hudson Street (1977).\n\nHer film career ignited during the popular \"blaxploitation\" era. She somehow managed to avoid the pitfalls of many a black actress of that time, however, despite her sexy and revealing roles in her first two films, Cool Breeze (1972) starring Thalmus Rasulala and Lincoln Kilpatrick, and Heiße Hölle Harlem (1973), in which she found herself in the clutches of brawny former footballer Fred Williamson. Margaret carried on with Calahan (1973) (as a hooker) and the comedies Wie geht's aufwärts? (1977) and Das Wunder von Pittsburgh (1979), establishing herself as a solid, reliable actress.\n\nMusic was never far away from Margaret as attested by her roles in Louis Armstrong - Chicago Style (1976), starring Ben Vereen as \"Satchmo\", and Scott Joplin (1977), which showcased Billy Dee Williams. However, it was her riveting supporting turn as the drug-riddled, fly-by-night singer Shug Avery in Die Farbe Lila (1985) that put her on the map. Stories have long circulated that Spielberg wanted a star singer in the role and that Margaret received the role only after both Patti LaBelle and Tina Turner were approached and turned it down. She had previously worked with Spielberg in her first TV movie Das Haus des Bösen (1972). He remembered her from this and cast her. Earning an Academy Award nomination for \"Best Supporting Actress\", it was expected that her career would hit major cinematic heights. Unfortunately, Margaret didn't make another film for three years, when she played a jazz singer in the little-seen Blueberry Hill (1988) with Carrie Snodgress.\n\nOn TV she continued to grace episodes of Amen (1986), Die Bill Cosby Show (1984), Roc (1991), J.A.G. - Im Auftrag der Ehre (1995), Macgyver (1985), Bones: Die Knochenjägerin (2005), enhanced such commendable made-for-TV movies as Heat Wave (1990) with Cicely Tyson and James Earl Jones, and has been seen sporadically in films. She co-starred in The Return of Superfly (1990) -- a nod to her old blaxploitation days--Ihr Gewissen (1993), Straße der Rache (1995) with John Travolta, the Mario Van Peebles feature Love Kills (1998)\n\nInto the millennium, Margaret has been seen in Waitin' to Live (2006), directed by Travolta's brother, Joey Travolta; Welcome Home Roscoe Jenkins (2008) as well as Meet the Browns (2008) with Martin Lawrence and Angela Bassett, respectively; the crime drama Proud Mary (2018) and the family comedy Grand-Daddy Day Care (2019). She also appearing regularly alongside Gabrielle Union and Richard Roundtree on BET's Being Mary Jane (2013).\n\nDivorced (74-80) from director Robert Gordon Hunt, Margaret has one daughter, Aisha.\n\nHe was a master class in cerebral eloquence and audience command...and although his dominant playing card in the realm of acting was quite serious and stately, nobody cut a more delightfully dry edge in sitcoms than this gentleman, whose calm yet blistering put-downs often eluded his lesser victims.\n\nActing titan Roscoe Lee Browne was born to a Baptist minister and his wife on May 2, 1922, in Woodbury, New Jersey. He attended Lincoln University, an historically black university in Pennsylvania until 1942, when he enlisted in the U.S. Army during World War II, where he served in Italy with the Negro 92nd Infantry Division and organized the Division's track and field team. He graduated from Lincoln University in 1946, and studied French through Middlebury College's summer language program. He received his master's degree from Columbia University, then subsequently returned to Lincoln and taught French and comparative literature, seemingly destined to settle in completely until he heard a different calling.\n\nRoscoe relished his first taste of adulation and admiration as a track star, competing internationally and winning the world championship in the 800-yard dash in 1951. He parlayed that attention into a job as a sales representative for a wine and liquor importer. In 1956, he abruptly decided to become an actor. And he did. With no training but a shrewd, innate sense of self, he boldly auditioned for, and won, the role of the Soothsayer in \"Julius Caesar\" the very next day at the newly-formed New York Shakespeare Festival. He never looked back and went on to perform with the company in productions of \"The Taming of the Shrew\", \"Titus Andronicus\", \"Othello\", \"King Lear\" (as the Fool), and \"Troilus and Cressida\".\n\nBlessed with rich, mellifluous tones and an imposing, cultured air, Roscoe became a rare African-American fixture on the traditionally white classical stage. In 1961 he appeared notably with James Earl Jones in the original off-Broadway cast of Jean Genet's landmark play \"The Blacks\". Awards soon came his way -- the first in the form of an Obie only a few years later for his portrayal of a rebellious slave in \"The Old Glory\". Additionally, he received the Los Angeles Drama Critic's Circle Award for both \"The Dream on Monkey Mountain\" (1970) and \"Joe Turner's Come and Gone\" (1989). Roscoe found less successful ventures on 1960s Broadway, taking his first curtain call in \"A Cool World\" in 1960, which folded the next day. He graced a number of other short runs including \"General Seegar\" (1962), \"Tiger, Tiger Burning Bright\" (1962), \"The Ballad of the Sade Cafe\" (1964), \"Danton's Death\" (1965), and \"A Hand Is on the Gate: An Evening of Negro Poetry and Folk Music\" (1966), which he also wrote and directed. He did not return to Broadway until 1983 with the role of the singing Rev. J.D. Montgomery in Tommy Tune's smash musical \"My One and Only\" in which his number \"Kicking the Clouds Away\" proved to be one of many highlights. Roscoe returned only once more to Broadway, earning acclaim and a Tony nomination for his supporting performance in August Wilson's \"Two Trains Running\" (1992).\n\nAlthough he made an isolated debut with The Connection (1961), he wouldn't appear regularly in films until the end of the decade with prominent parts in the Elizabeth Taylor/Richard Burton film, Die Stunde der Komödianten (1967), Jules Dassin's Black Power (1968), Hitchcock's Topas (1969) and, his most notable, Die Glut der Gewalt (1970). Thereafter, he complimented a host of features, both comedic and dramatic, including Superfly (1972) (and its sequel), Samstagnacht oben in der Stadt (1974), Flucht ins 23. Jahrhundert (1976), Staatsanwälte küsst man nicht (1986), Mambo Kings (1992) and Hilfe, ich komm' in den Himmel (1996)\n\nElsewhere, Roscoe's disdainful demeanor courted applause on all the top 70s sitcoms including \"All in the Family\", \"Maude,\" \"Sanford and Son\", \"Good Times\" and \"Barney Miller\" (Emmy-nominated), and he played the splendidly sardonic role of Saunders, the Tate household butler, after replacing Robert Guillaume's popular \"Benson\" character on Die Ausgeflippten (1977). In 1986 he won an Emmy Award for his guest appearance on Die Bill Cosby Show (1984). His trademark baritone lent authority and distinction to a number of documentaries, live-action fare, and animated films, as well as the spoken-word arena, with such symphony orchestras as the Boston Pops and the Los Angeles Philharmonic to his credit. A preeminent recitalist, he was known for committing hundreds of poems to memory. For many years he and actor Anthony Zerbe toured the U.S. with their presentation of \"Behind the Broken Words\", an evening of poetry and dramatic readings.\n\nAt the time of his death of cancer on April 11, 2007, the never-married octogenarian was still omnipresent, more heard than seen perhaps. Among his last works was his narrations of a Garfield film feature and the most recent movie spoof Fantastic Movie (2007).\n\nNative New Yorker June Christopher was also raised in Germany and Jamaica. She started as a stage actress in New York and attended Barnard College at Columbia University there. She has acted at the renowned New York Public Theater and did \"Threepenny Opera\" off-Broadway. She was a member of the famed Negro Ensemble Company before going back to Germany to tour with \"Porgy and Bess\" and doing a television series while living in Munich.\n\nJune then moved to Los Angeles where she appeared on dozens of TV shows, including \"Now We're Talking,\" \"Rizzoli & Isles,\" \"Close to Home,\" \"JAG\", \"So Little Time,\" and \"The Jamie Foxx Show.\" She has also appeared in roles in the films \"Misery,\" \"Free Willy II,\" \"Dr. Dolittle,\" \"Blankman,\" web series \"Boxer,\" and more.\n\nHer heart is her family, husband Michael Haney and her twins Angie and Alex. While raising her children, June became a popular voiceover actor in film and television. Some of her voiceover film credits include \"Frozen,\" \"Frozen II,\" The Angry Birds Movie 2,\" \"Spider-Man: Into the Spiderverse,\" \"X-Men: Days of Future Past,\" \"X-Men: The Apocalypse, \"The Hunger Games: Mockingjay - Part 2,\" \"The Incredibles 2,\" \"Big Hero 6,\" \"Dawn of the Planet of the Apes,\" the Shield Computer voice on \"Captain America,\" \"Hidden Figures,\" \"The Big Short,\" and more. She has also been a regular performer for voice on television, appearing often on the series \"Law and Order,\" \"24,\" \"Chicago Med,\" \"Chicago PD,\" \"Chicago Fire,\" \"Homeland,\" \"Madam Secretary,\" \"Orange is the New Black,\" \"Power,\" \"Snowfall,\" \"Greenleaf,\" \"The Resident,\" \"Covert Affairs,\" the remake of \"Roots,\" \"Madam C.J. Walker,\" and others.\n\nAs a writer, June has had deals at HBO, NBC, and Motown Productions. For years, she wrote a one-hour, weekly national radio anthology on the history of black music called \"Music of the City,\" which led to a 12-hour history of Motown for radio and a 10-history of The Apollo Theater, which became \"Motown Returns to the Apollo\" for television.\n\nAs a producer, June and her husband, Michael Haney, produced the anti-bullying film \"Charity\" which won Best Family Film at the Hollywood Reel Independent Film Festival, Gold Remi Award at the WorldFest Houston, Award of Merit at the Accolade Global Film Competition. \"Charity\" was invited as an Official Selection to the Irvine International Film Festival, Sedona International Film Festival, Kansas City FilmFest, Julien Dubuque International Film Festival, and was nominated for the Best Social Commentary Award and Best Outstanding Cast Performance Award at the Action on Film Festival. She and her family have an anti-bullying foundation, the Stop Bullying Foundation, which uses this film to present in schools, college, and youth conferences to speak out against bullying. Looking to make the world a better place, June seeks to touch hearts and minds in everything she does.\n\nJudyann Elder graduated from Emerson College in Boston as the first recipient of the Carol Burnett Award in the Performing Arts. She began her professional career in New York off-Broadway as a founding member and resident actor with the Tony Award-winning Negro Ensemble Company. She originated roles in the premiere productions of The Song of the Lusitanian Bogey; Daddy Goodness; Kongi's Harvest; God is a Guess What; and Ceremonies in Dark Old Men and toured with the company to London and Rome. She later made her Broadway debut at the Ambassador Theatre as Coretta King opposite Billy Dee Williams in I Have a Dream. She returns to regional stages as frequently as possible in such plays as The Heliotrope Bouquet, An American Daughter, The Old Settler, The Story, and Fences. A television veteran with innumerable credits, her favorites include her stint on Murphy Brown as Candice Bergen's obstetrician; her recurring role as Gina's mother on the hit series Martin; her series regular as Harriet Winslow for the final season of Family Matters; and her guest turn as Terri Hatcher's psychiatrist on Desperate Housewives. A breast cancer survivor and former legislative ambassador for the American Cancer Society, her dramatic role as a woman confronted with breast cancer on the show ER remains her most personally enduring. Her feature films include, among others, A Woman Called Moses with Cecily Tyson, Forget Paris opposite Billy Crystal, and Seven Pounds opposite Will Smith. For radio, she most recently portrayed Lena Younger in Lorraine Hansberry's A Raisin in the Sun for LA TheatreWorks national radio series which received a 2012 Audie Award. Ms. Elder's work as an actor led to her foray into directing. Among her directorial credits: The Book of the Crazy African (Skylight Theatre); The Meeting (Inner City Cultural Center, LA and New Federal Theatre, NY); Ceremonies in Dark Old Men (Beverly Canon Theatre); The Member of the Wedding (LA Theatre Works); How's Your Love Life? and A Private Act (Robey Theatre Company). Her direction of Ceremonies in Dark Old Men at the Skirball Cultural Center for LA TheatreWorks radio series was broadcast nationally in February of 2010. She is an alumna of the American Film Institute's Directing Workshop for Women where she produced and directed the short film, Behind God's Back, based on an Alice Walker story and starring Beau Bridges. She is the recipient of a Screenwriting Fellowship with Walt Disney Studios, was honored in 2005 with a NAACP Trailblazer Award and in 2010 received a Distinguished Alumni Award from Emerson College.
