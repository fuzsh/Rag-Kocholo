        "text": "Hey, just wondering if anybody could he;p me locate a solid read for a trip I'm going on soon. I love books that are set in post apocalyptic worlds. However it seems like I've read through too many of them or just couldn't get into a lot of them.\n\nSome of the stuff I don't like is fairly simple stuff. I don't like book centered around a only a single survivor (last man on earth). I don't like fluffy luke warm stories i.e. books that obviously skip over what would be a violent scene or glaze over an unfortunate death. Now onto some of the things I do like. Obviously things like poor character development, sloppy writing, cliches (to an extent) need not be mentioned.\n\nOne of the things that I love about these kinds of stories is that factions that come up in this world and the power struggles taking place. I love gritty stories, stuff that leaves no grim detail out wither that gash in a person's leg or the last quiver of a lover's touch. I do like books with some kinds of combat in them. I do like stories with some kinds of romantic interests (as long as romance isn't the main feature). I do like stories set in the present or the near future.\n\nNow onto the real problem. It seems like I've exhausted a lot of the popular surface novels when it comes to post apocalyptic literature, I've read alot of the classics when it comes to this genre like the last man, I am omega, Anthem, stuff like that. I've also read most of the popular books in the genre, i.e. the stand, the road, world war z, divergent, the hunger games. So if anyone think they can help me out let me know thanks again!"
