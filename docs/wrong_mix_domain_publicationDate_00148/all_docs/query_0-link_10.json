        "text": "Review: Tsunami, Crawford Kilian, 1983.\n\nKilian’s Icequake turned out to be a surprising success. The author’s note on Kilian says it sold 300,000 copies worldwide. This isn’t really a sequel but a parallel story telling us what happened on the Pacific Coast of North America during the events of the previous novel.\n\nEven more so than that book, I have the impression this book would not be published as is today. It’s a mere 218 pages long. It would probably be three times that length today or maybe even a series. Kilian, in that brief span, takes us from the events just before the tsunamis, triggered worldwide by large portions of the Antarctic ice shelf catastrophically sliding into the ocean, through the disintegration of the old order and a tentative rebuilding of civilization.\n\nThis book has a little more detail on the troubles of the the pre-tsunami world than Icequake did. We hear about the devastation the new solar flares are wrecking on electronics and communications. (Oddly, Kilian only has disruption and not the actual destruction of electronic devices. That may be because there were a lot less transistors and microchips about in 1983.) Agricultural has been greatly affected by the increased UV from the sun. Crops are withering. Cattle wander about blinded if not equipped with sunglasses. Activity has largely become nocturnal for people. There is an interesting racial component here in that blacks can move about easier in the daylight hours though even they need to wear sunglasses.\n\nAnd things aren’t going to get better. Einar, a grad student in solar physics, says the recent solar flares have revealed new information about the sun. Its fusion has stopped, and it may be from 5,000 to 50,000 years before it starts again. An ice age is on the way.\n\nContinue reading →\n\nMichael Flynn died on September 30th. He made quite an impression on me with one of his earlier tales, “Eifelheim” — a tale of alien contact in medieval Europe during the Black Plague. It was turned into a fine novel as well.\n\nI always meant to read more of his novels, but those are his only two solo works I’ve read so far.\n\nWhile Jerry Pournelle was alive, Flynn was a frequent commenter on his website and exhibited not only a professional’s knowledge of statistics but a deep knowledge of obscure medieval natural philosophy, some which prefigured twentieth century discoveries. And, of course, Flynn collaborated with Pournelle and Larry Niven on Fallen Angels.\n\nRaw Feed (1991): In the Country of the Blind, Michael Flynn, 1990.\n\nThis book features implausible hypnoconditioning turning unsuspecting individuals into disposable pawns (I suspect this is as much a stock feature of modern espionage tales as double agents which this book also features a plethora of); an annoying, little explained rescue of Red Malone and Sarah Beaumont by Janie Hatch at, of course, the opportune cliffhanging moment; an obvious plot twist (Alan Selkirk being a double agent), a somewhat inconclusive ending (How is cliology going to impact society? Will its secret be released so the general public can do it? Will a confederation, a secret cabal, of cliologists be formed?), and aa plot rife with coincidence (Namely an individual with Sarah Beaumont’s talents making much of Brady Quinn’s scrap of notes after finding it. I suppose, though, the Secret Innocently Discovered plot must be granted the initial presumption of coincidence to work), characters alternately brilliant (like Sarah) and somewhat slow (in her objections to cliology which Red Malone has obvious answers for. Also, Jim Doang seems alternately brilliant and slow when he discovers the mathematical truth of cliology but doesn’t, as Vane does, see the analogy to physical laws.\n\nAll that said, I liked this book and thought it was well done.\n\nContinue reading →\n\nSince James Harris over at Classics of Science Fiction reviewed this book, I decided to get out my (at least to my more mature eye) not terribly insightful notes on that book. I also make way too much of the fact that Brunner, like almost every other science fiction author, wasn’t a successful prophet.\n\nRaw Feed (1990): The Shockwave Rider, John Brunner, 1975.\n\nI had wanted to read this book for awhile due to its subject matter and great title. However, I was disappointed on an ideational and literary level.\n\nFirst, this book, like many near-future, cautionary dystopias is a creature of its time. Brunner seems to have a somewhat tenuous idea of how computers and computer programming work (though perhaps not much less than cyberpunkist William Gibson who didn’t even know disk drives made noise.)\n\nOn the other hand, this is one of the first (I have seen it listed as the first which may be true for all I know) sf novels to ever mention computer viruses and almost calls them that (but usually tapeworms — another hacker term). But, to my untrained mind, their powers seem a bit excessive.\n\nBrunner, like so many writers, seems somewhat content to write nationalism off as a dead force in the future. Past years have only seen it grow stronger. (Jerry Pournelle’s CoDominium rightly recognizes nationalism’s longevity in human affairs.)\n\nContinue reading →\n\nSince I mentioned this novel recently — and because I still don’t have any new reviews written, you get this.\n\nRaw Feed (1998): Final Blackout, L. Ron Hubbard, 1940, 2991.\n\nAlgis Budry’s “Introduction” is somewhat incredulous about Hubbard’s purported accomplishments but has interesting things to say about this novel’s importance. Originally published in Astounding Science Fiction in 1941 (March through May I believe), this novel is remarkable. It’s not just a novel of future war. They existed before this novel. Budrys finds the novel original in its political sophistication. He explicitly compares it to George Orwell’s 1984 which was to come years later. (Though he doesn’t specifically mention it, both feature worlds under the thumb of constantly warring totalitarian states.) It was also one of the first (maybe the first) US novel to feature US Marines suppressing the “hero”.\n\nHubbard’s own “Preface” is for the 1948 postwar edition of his novel. (Unfortunately, I don’t know how it varies from the magazine edition.) Hubbard’s account of the controversy around the novel (he was called a Fascist and a Communist) is true. But the preface is a bit too fulsome and coy. Still, as Hubbard points out, when he wrote this novel Britain banned its publication and was not Socialist (as it became post war) and Russia was sitting out the war. It also predicted (no great trick) civilian casualties and atomic warfare (H. G. Wells did that first). His most awkward moment is when he thinks most of the novel’s critics were Communists.\n\nThis novel stands, I suspect, at the fount of modern military science fiction. There were certainly future war stories before. H.G. Wells’ The War of the Worlds springs to mind immediately. But the modern incarnation of military men in science fiction, the no-nonsense mercenaries of David Drake and Jerry Pournelle immediately come to mind, probably all go back to Hubbard’s Lieutenant. (He is never called anything else.)\n\nContinue reading →\n\nJohn F. Carr wrote two biographies on H. Beam Piper, this one and, later, Typewriter Killer: H. Beam Piper. (Thus, he has to write another book on Piper to comply with Robert Silverberg’s Law of Research.)\n\nReview: H. Beam Piper: A Biography, John F. Carr, 2008.\n\nA biographer of Piper has a challenge. Piper was a man of habitual secrecy, compartmentalization, and deceit. A habitual diary keeper, he burned years’ worth of diaries prior to his marriage late in life. And why did he divorce his wife? Was she really a golddigger who married him for a vacation in Paris? What did the convivial, hard-drinking Piper do for a living before he became a professional writer? His writing acquaintances variously thought he was a railroad detective or railroad engineer. He really worked for decades as the night watchmen in the yard of the Pennsylvania Railroad in Altoona, Pennsylvania. His friends didn’t even know what the “H.” stood for – Horace?, Henry?. It was really Herbert.\n\nAnd why did he, on November 6, 1964, put one of his guns to his mouth and pull the trigger?\n\nCarr met the challenge and presents us a biography of an interesting and fatally flawed man who produced some outstanding works of science fiction, a biography that surprised Carr associate Jerry Pournelle, a friend of Piper’s, with its revelation and the lies his old friend told. The sources are the reminisces of friends – sometimes as preserved by their children, Piper’s letters and diaries, letters from John W. Campbell, and the work of Piper friend and abortive biographer Mike Knerr. (Abortive because Knerr turned down the finder’s fee from Ace Books for turning over Piper’s lost manuscript of Fuzzies and Other People in exchange for them publishing the biography. They never did.)\n\nContinue reading →\n\nBetween Four-Day Planet and this story, Piper published “Naudsonce”.\n\nReview: “A Slave Is a Slave”, H. Beam Piper, 1962.\n\nIn Typewriter Killer, John F. Carr says this story may have inspired Piper’s later Space Viking. Both are in Piper’s Terro-Human Future History. Here the Space Vikings are mentioned in an almost mythical way, and Piper decided to detail some of their story in the latter novel.\n\nPiper started writing that novel even before this story was accepted by John W. Campbell and published in the April 1962 of Analog Science Fiction – Science Fact. As we’ll see, Campbell’s influence is noticeable.\n\nThe story is set on Aditya during the First Galactic Empire which grew up in the age following the Space Vikings and their collapse into decadence. Aditya is, in fact, the same communist planet mentioned in Piper’s “Ministry of Disturbance”, a story written earlier but set later in the series. It takes place in the mid-third century of the Empire, and “Ministry of Disturbance” takes place about 600 years later, and the sense one gets, between the two stories, is that things didn’t change much on the world.\n\nThis story is a philosophical examination of the supposed truism that all men yearn to be free and the wisdom of intervening to make them free if necessary.\n\nThe viewpoint character is Jurgen, Prince Trevannion (a name probably inspired by James Branch Cabell, one of Piper’s favorite authors). He’s heading an expedition to annex Aditya into the Empire. With him is Lance Debbrend officially,\n\nAssistant to the Ministerial Secretary. In practice, Lanze was his chess-opponent, conversational foil, right hand, third eye and ear, and, sometimes, trigger-finger.\n\nColonel Ravney is in charge of the Navy Landing-Troops. And there’s our do-gooder, Orbay, Count Erskyll. He’s young and his connected family, fearing he was being radicalized with liberal ideas at university, got him a job as the proconsul when the planet is taken. Trevannion thinks it was a mistake to give him the job, but he’s in charge until the planet if fully under Imperial control.\n\nContinue reading →\n\nReview: Null-ABC, H. Beam Piper and John J. McGuire, 1953.\n\nIt’s a world where department stores launch armed attacks on their competitors. Elections have gangs who beat up and occasionally kill the opposition. (And, if you don’t have your own gang, you can rent one.) Technology has stagnated. High school students assault their teachers regularly. And most of the population is illiterate.\n\nYes, there’s a Crisis in 2140. That was the better titled selected for the novel when it was republished as part of an Ace Double in 1957. It was originally serialized in the February and March 1953 issues of Astounding Science Fiction, and I suspect editor John W. Campbell gave it a title reminiscent of A. E. van Vogt’s Null-A series which ran in Astounding in the 1940s.\n\nThe work is part of a group of 1950s science fiction novels dealing with the theme of anti-intellectualism. They include Ray Bradbury’s Fahrenheit 451 and Fritz Leiber’s The Silver Eggheads (which I have not read). Like another such novel, James Gunn’s The Burning, it features a population that blames historical problems on intellectuals, and, in particular, has reacted against that basic intellectual tool: literacy.\n\nThere has always been, on the part of the Illiterate public, some resentment against organized Literacy. In part, it has been due to the high fees charged for Literate services, and to what seems, to many, to be monopolistic practices. But behind that is a general attitude of anti-intellectualism which is our heritage from the disastrous wars of the Twentieth and Twenty-first Centuries. Chester Pelton has made himself the spokesman of this attitude. In his view, it was men who could read and write who hatched the diabolical political ideologies and designed the frightful nuclear weapons of that period. In his mind, Literacy is equated with ‘Mein Kampf’ and ‘Das Kapital’, with the A-bomb and the H-bomb, with concentration camps and blasted cities.\n\nYes, in this society literacy is so rare – but still a necessary skill – that Literates have their own union, the Associated Fraternities of Literates. And men like Chester Pelton, owner of a department store, resent that their skills are needed. And he can do something about it. He’s a senator in the North American Confederacy.\n\nContinue reading →\n\nReview: “Operation R.S.V.P”, H. Beam Piper, 1951.\n\nThe shadow of a future nuclear war hangs over 1950s science fiction. Piper’s stories frequently mention it. Often, it occurs, but this is a rare story, tongue in cheek, that shows a way it might be avoided.\n\nPiper scholar John F. Carr, in his Typewriter Killer, quotes a March 22, 1963 letter from Piper to his friend Jerry Pournelle:\n\nYou know it must have been lovely, living in an era when the Clausewitzian ‘extension of politics by other means’ was accomplished by nothing more lethal or expensive, especially expensive, than black powder…Well, see you in Washington over the Labor Day week-end, if there still is a Washington then.\n\nOne suspects for Piper, who had known a world before atomic bombs, their invention was particularly irksome.\n\nThis story was first published in the January 1951 issue of Amazing Stories. It’s an epistolary story and not part of Piper’s Terro-Human Future History.\n\nIt opens on Jan. 15, 1984 with a letter from Vladimir N. Dzhoubinsky, Foreign Minister of the Union of East European Soviet Republics (the UEESR) and addressed to Wu Fung Tung of the United Peoples’ Republic of East Asia (the UPREA). In diplomatic language, it reminds Tung that the Union’s newest missile has a range more than sufficient to reach Peking. Tung might want to consider that in current negotiations over the Khakum River.\n\nContinue reading →\n\nRaw Feed (2006): The Day of the Triffids, John Wyndham, 1951.\n\nBrian Aldiss referred to the work of John Wyndham as “cosy catastrophe”. I don’t think, in retrospect, he meant that the disasters of Wyndham’s works are improbably nice and clean. I think he was referring to the narrative strategy Wyndham used in this and The Kraken Awakes: first person narratives centering around one or two individuals who have limited knowledge and explanation of the disaster they face. For instance, the narrator here has no definite proof that the blindness which strikes most of humanity is the result of satellite weapons — an interesting idea for the beginning of the satellite age — or that the lethal plague which breaks out after the blindness is an engineered disease — and limited means of dealing with it. This stands in direct contrast to the best-seller idiom of later American works like Larry Niven and Jerry Pournelle’s Lucifer’s Hammer. (I don’t know enough about styles of the time to know if something similar to Niven and Pournelle existed in disaster fiction prior to this book.)\n\nJohn Christopher, another English writer from the time, fits into this style, and a prior American work, George R. Stewart’s Earth Abides, does too. In fact, as the story progresses and we hear about how the houses and roads and bridges of England were being eroded away by nature, I was very much reminded of Stewart’s novel. Tonally and thematically, though, there is nothing cozy or comfortable about this novel. There is something very visceral about the blinding of most of humanity, an unclean disaster that requires, for disaster fiction, an unusual amount of lifeboat ethics in that the narrator and some of his fellow survivors realize they are not doing the blind any good by temporarily saving them from death.\n\nWyndham’s genius, of course, is combining the blindness with the “invasion” of genetically engineered, ambulatory, poisonous triffids. As with Wyndham’s Re-Birth and The Midwich Cuckoos, we are constantly reminded of the Darwinian struggle for life, of competing species and supplanters in our midst. As the narrator memorably remarks in a book of many memorable, philosophical lines, custom and tradition have been long mistaken for natural law.\n\nContinue reading →\n\nIn keeping with the World War One theme I started with The Russian Origins of the First World War, I picked this book off the shelf.\n\nReview: Timeslip Troopers, Théo Varlet and André Blandin, trans. Brian Stableford, 1923, 2012.\n\nWhen Lieutenant Renard rotates into command of a group of poilu defending on a small French village, he finds out that the officers have a very well-stocked wine cellar. But the Englishman who left it – he was shot as a German spy — also left behind a time machine and his journal. While the tone of the book is closer to Mark Twain’s A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur’s Court, it is explicitly a sequel to H. G. Wells’ The Time Machine since that Englishman is Well’s time traveler.\n\nWhen Renard discovers the journal and machine, he shows it to Sergeant Dupuy, the unit’s clever radio man and a mechanic before the war in the factory owned by Renard’s father.\n\nWhen an accident with a time machine transports a group of French soldiers from the Western Front of World War One to the Spain of 1321, we get a wry, entertaining novel. It’s the first science fiction work I know of in the tradition of radically displacing earthly soldiers in time and space. It blazes – without, presumably, any influence on those later works – the path followed by Poul Anderson’s The High Crusade, David Drake’s Ranks of Bronze, Jerry Pournelle’s Janissaries, and Pat Kelleher’s No Man’s World series.\n\nThe two take it out on some test flights for a bit of R & R in Paris before and during the war. Both trips are near disasters, and the Germans unexpectedly attack the unit during one, and Renard has to come up with an unconvincing story about why he and Dupuy were gone at such a critical time.\n\nContinue reading →"
