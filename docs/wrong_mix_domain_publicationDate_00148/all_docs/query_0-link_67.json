        "text": "Countless science fiction books, from short story collections to novels, line the shelves of book stores and libraries. Which to read next?\n\nIt can often be difficult to find out what suits your interests or sort out the good sci fi books from the great sci fi books. After all, for every great science fiction novel, there are many terrible and mediocre ones that will just waste your precious reading time.\n\nThat’s why we book together this list of the top sci fi books on the market. We’ve also included some handy references for your reading journey, hopefully leading you away from the riff-raff and toward the best sci-fi the genre has to offer.\n\nWhat Makes a Must Read Sci Fi Book?\n\nSci Fi novels are not unlike normal novels. The best sci fi novels are, at their core, great literature regardless of genre.\n\nToo often, lists of this type become more “best sci fi book series,” with individual and standalone books taking a back seat. Especially standalone novels. Yes, we included multiple series on the list, but we tried to include a plethora of standalone novels.\n\nWhat is the Best Book in All of Science Fiction?\n\nThis is an impossible question to answer, but let us explain why.\n\nIt depends on if you’re looking for the best new sci fi books or classic sci fi books. It depends on if you’re looking for subgenre or something indicative of the genre as a whole, such as a tentpole novel that inspires many more after it.\n\nDo series count? Do you count all books in a series or just the best ones?\n\nEven if you can agree on taste and preference, these questions aren’t going away. So, to that end, let’s talk about our criteria.\n\nConsiderations & Criteria\n\nFirst, we had to determine, what is a sci-fi book? Certainly, it’s a story of speculative fiction. Something unlike our world today.\n\nBut how many fantasy elements until science fiction books become fantasy books?\n\nUltimately, we decided that this isn’t a best fantasy books list. We’ll save that for another list. So, if it was too close, we yanked it.\n\nAs for series, we decided to include them and include all books in the series. If we didn’t include series, we’d skip some of the genre’s best. And if we cherry picked books from the series, it wouldn’t help very much as a reader’s guide, which we intend this list to be, at least in part.\n\nOur Picks: Best Science Fiction Books\n\nWith that in mind, here are the 100 best Sci-Fi books in no particular order.\n\n#-C\n\n2001: A Space Odyssey by Arthur C. Clarke\n\nOnce an enigma is uncovered and investigations begin, things begin to take a horrifying turn for everyone involved.\n\nA Canticle for Leibowitz by Walter M.

Dick\n\nThis scathing metaphysical comedy of death and salvation is a tour de force of paranoid menace and absurd comedy, in which the dead offer business advice, buy their next reincarnation and run the risk of dying agai\n\nUplift Series by David Brin\n\nDavid Brin’s Uplift novels are among the most thrilling and extraordinary science fiction ever written.

Explaining too much would spoil the joy of discovering it firsthand. We can’t recommend this one enough.\n\nThe War of the Worlds by H. G. Wells\n\nThe War of the Worlds story has been told countless times across a variety of media.
