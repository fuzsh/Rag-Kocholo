Tickets for Sunday events will also be available at the gate on the day of the Concours, Sunday beginning at 9:30 AM based on availability.\n\nAll ticket prices per person except for the Bill O’Connell Memorial Road Rally which includes driver and navigator.\n\nNomination, Entry, & Application Forms\n\nPaper Free\n\nOnline Forms\n\nOur Organization\n\nOver Twenty-Five Years of Distinction\n\nIn the early 1990s, a small group of automobile enthusiasts banded together to organize the Philadelphia Vintage Grand Prix which was held in Fairmount Park. The event was well attended, and the roster of vintage competitors was impressive. However, several factors caused the event to end after a few years of operation. That enthusiast group then considered another way to bring these wonderful vintage vehicles together for the public to enjoy. The idea was to create a Concours d’Elegance, inviting only the most interesting and significant automobiles for display and judging on the concours show field.\n\nMichael G. Tillson III was one of those organizers. In 1997, Michael and his fellow enthusiasts decided to bring together classic cars and the world of horses and fox hunting – by staging a benefit Concours d’Elegance at the Radnor Hunt in the rolling country of Chester County, Pennsylvania. Over the years, the event has grown from it’s humble beginnings with a handful of exceptional cars, to a showfield of one hundred entries chosen by the Car Selection Committee. In 2005, vintage motorcycles were added to the show field, making Radnor Hunt Concours d’Elegance the first nationally ranked event of its type to include motorcycles. The addition of horse drawn coaches and carriages in 2007 made Radnor Hunt Concours d’Elegance the only concours to feature the earliest forms of wheeled transportation.\n\nRadnor Hunt Concours d’Elegance has grown from its humble beginnings to a three-day event that starts off with a Friday Night Barbecue, followed Saturday by the Bill O’Connell Memorial Road Rally and Black Tie Gala, culminating in the main event on Sunday; the Concours d’Elegance.\n\nToday, this is an event with show field entries from all over the country, and vehicle nominations that exceed the capacity of the grounds. The Marketplace features vendors of both automotive and lifestyle interests to round out the Sunday activities. Proceeds from the event benefit two local non-profit organizations; Thorncroft Equestrian Center in Malvern, PA and the local Boy Scout troops.\n\nWho We Are\n\nFind out more about the people that have made this event a success year after year, our board members.\n\nHistory & Results\n\nCheck out the history of our event and the results of previous events.\n\nWho We Help\n\nLearn more about the beneficiary of our event, Thorncroft Equestrian Center.\n\nSponsors\n\nPlease support our sponsors that help us make this event a success every year.\n\nOur Beneficiary\n\nThorncroft Equestrian Center\n\nThorncroft Equestrian Center is a 501(c)3 non-profit located in Malvern, PA, whose mission is to develop the physical and emotional well-being of all people regardless of their individual challenges. Thorncroft is committed to personal growth and education in an equestrian environment of respect, love, and inclusion.\n\nBoard Members\n\nWho We Are\n\nMichael G. Tillson III\n\nChairman and Founder\n\nThe career of Michael Tillson’s grandfather spanned two eras – although he was deeply involved in horse transportation, he also entered the automobile business. In the next generation, Michael’s father extended the family’s involvement in the world of cars. Michael G. Tillson III, today one of the most highly regarded authorities in the country on classic and sports cars as well as a lover of fine horses, began his career ferrying cars from one of his father’s facilities to another – at the age of 12. The world of very special and exotic cars opened when Michael became associated with the Derham Body Company of Rosemont, Pennsylvania – a firm that had crafted the finest custom bodies for chassis supplied by manufacturers such as Packard, Cadillac and Duesenberg. During Mike’s tenure, Derham was still hand-crafting custom work for clients on Philadelphia’s famed Main Line as well as armor-plating limousines for diplomats and dictators. For Michael Tillson, it was then on to the position of service manager for the legendary Ferrari dealer, Algar of Rosemont. Tillson’s encyclopedic knowledge of Ferraris and Alfa Romeos owes much to this experience. By now, he had entered another phase of the automotive scene – he had become a serious and respected sports car racer, appearing regularly on the SCCA and IMSA tracks. He burned rubber at Daytona, Sebring, and Lime Rock as well as courses in Mexico and Canada. Among his treasured memories of this period are the races where he was co-driver with such legends of the track as Innes Ireland, Al Holbert, and Bruce Jennings. In 1997, Michael decided to bring together two of his great loves – classic cars and the world of horses and fox hunting – by staging a benefit Concours d’Elegance at the Radnor Hunt in the rolling country of Chester County, Pennsylvania. In a way, this is a happy synthesis of the two passions that have characterized three generations of the Tillson family – Michael is a governor of the Hunt and an avid horseman. Since then, the Concours has continued to grow and is now a recognized prestige event that showcases the most elegant Packard, Cadillac, Du Pont, Bentley, Duesenberg, Rolls-Royce and Mercedes Benz automobiles from around the nation. The sporting marques that have graced the show field include Ferrari, Alfa Romeo, Aston Martin, Jaguar and Porsche. His hard work and dedication have produced an event that brings great pleasure to many classic car enthusiasts and has resulted in significant gifts to various charities and, for the past several years, has focused on Thorncroft Equestrian Center and the local troops of the Boy Scouts.\n\nThomas H.

She can be reached at Lisa@Brandfarmllc.com.\n\nOver the Years\n\nHistory\n\nMichael Tillson and several of the present board members of the Concours played major roles in the organization and supervision of the Fairmount Park Vintage Grand Prix events that were held from 1990 to 1995. Featuring several hundred vintage sports racing cars, these four-day racing weekends honored the memory of the famous Fairmount Park races that took place in Philadelphia’s vast Fairmount Park system during the period of the First World War. At the time, the Fairmount Park races were the premier racing events in the United States, comparable in scope and reputation to the later Vanderbilt Cup races and the Indianapolis races of the 1920s and 1930s.\n\nIt was Michael Tillson’s concept to stage an elegant invitational classic car event on the spacious, historic grounds of the Radnor Hunt in Chester County that would compare to the elegance and quality of such national events as the annual Pebble Beach Concours d’Elegance in California.\n\nThe concept of the event was far removed from the typical “car show.” It would be invitational, the cars would be carefully and individually selected and each car would represent an educational and aesthetic experience for guests. There would be a balance between historic, classic, sports and performance racing cars.\n\nTo recall the great traditions of the classic French Concours d’Elegance originally held in the Parc des Princes, Paris, there would be a automotive art, high-style fashion, and jewelry shows to compliment the latest fashions in motor cars.\n\nPlans included a black-tie dinner party the night before the Concours to benefit a worthy charity, Thorncroft Equestrian Center and the Boy Scouts of America.\n\nMost important it would have its own unique ambience, combining the most relaxed qualities of an English garden party with a celebration of the cars that have written memorable chapters in the history of the motor car. Over the years, motorcycles were added in 2004 and horse drawn coaches and carriages joined the Sunday field in 2008.\n\nThe Radnor Hunt Concours d’Elegance has faithfully held to those standards. Surveying carefully the progress of the Concours, the committee elected to restrict the number of entries in order to maintain very high standards and to allow the best possible display of each car. Thus evolved the concept of Radnor Hunt Concours d’Elegance.\n\nPrevious Winners\n\n2023 Results\n\nCategoryAwardsPresented ByWinnerVehicle VeteranRadnor AwardDebbie & Bob Cornman1905 Franklin Model A

A new tradition began with the Best Sporting Marque of the Show going to the Simeone Foundations’ Ferrari 375MM Spyder.\n\n2009\n\nA new trend was started in 2009 by Radnor Hunt featuring a collector instead of a single marque, and Jack Rick was so honored.

The Timeless Elegance award was presented to Jack Rich for his dramatic 1939 Rolls-Royce Phantom III by Labourdette.\n\n2006\n\nThe Figoni Falaschi bodied Talbot-Lago is one of the most striking designs of the coachbuilding era. Bill Marriott’s beautiful 1938 T150C Cabriolet features sweeping pontoon fenders, low windscreen, and intimate seating for two. The car appears in motion while standing still. We are most proud that this wonderful rolling sculpture was honored as our tenth anniversary Best of Show in 2006.\n\n2005\n\nIn 2005, Joseph Cassini became the first multiple Best of Show winner with his 1930 Bentley Speed Six by Gurney Nutting. This great car was originally built for Lt. Cmdr. Glen Kidston so that he could compete in the 1930 Monte Carlo Rally. Commander Kidston was one of the famous “Bentley Boys” who achieved a kind of immortality for his spirited adventures with Bentley cars.\n\n2003\n\nThe tradition of excellence continued in 2003 as the green and black 1937 Lagonda LG 45 Rapide, presented by Judge Joseph Cassini, III swept the top spot. John Rich took home a beautiful IWC wristwatch from Govberg Jewelers for winning the Timeless Elegance award with his 1938 Mercedes-Benz 540K Cabriolet B by Norrmalm.\n\n2002\n\n2002 saw John Moir’s popular 1925 Voisin C3L Berline Transformable win Best in Show, while Jerry Saul’s won the Timeless Elegance Award for his stunning red and blue 1939 Delage D8 120 Roadster.\n\n2004\n\nFor 2004, Best Of Show went to the famous 1933 Pierce Arrow Silver Arrow of Tom Derro. Both the duPont Homsey Award and The Timeless Elegance Award Presented By Govberg Jewelers went to Dean Edmonds for his fabulous 1932 Bugatti Type 55 Roadster.\n\n2000\n\nThe 2000 event was captured by a 1939 Bugatti 57SC Roadster by Saoutchik and proudly presented by Jerry Sauls of Bucks County, Pennsylvania.\n\n2001\n\nIn 2001 Radnor honored the 100th anniversary of Rolls-Royce and fittingly, the 1926 Rolls-Royce Phantom I Salamanca of Baltimore’s Charles Gillet took Best in Show. In the first year of the Timeless Elegance Award, Wendy Garthwaite DeMarco won a beautiful watch presented by Govberg Jewelers for her 1938 Bentley 4 Litre Coupe by Van Vooren.\n\n1999\n\nIn 1999 George Hahn won that honor with his 1931 Cadillac Fleetwood Sport Phaeton.\n\nVolunteer Information\n\nAre you interested in helping the event?
