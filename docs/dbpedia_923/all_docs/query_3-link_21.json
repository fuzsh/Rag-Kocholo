        "text": "Korey, they had your prayer service today but I’m sure you know that already. I’m positive you can feel the love and the hurt from the heavens. Your classmates came together again for you and paid their respects with nice words and unforgettable memories.\n\nIf you google “Korey Sims” you’ll see some things that’ll give you nightmares, but I remember you differently. I remember the young boy who transferred to St. Aloysius and left as a young man. You impacted many in your 18 years on this Earth. If you don’t believe me just ask all the people who came to honor your name. You had the stands packed tonight just like you did when you scored 15 points on your senior night. I’ll miss covering your games.\n\nAugust 4th will never be the same. Once I found out it was you, I immediately called your coach. That’s a conversation I wish on no one.\n\nYour family was there tonight, but you know that as well. I’ll never be able to unsee that pain but everything’s going to be ok. We know you’re still here with us in spirit.\n\nTo your classmates, coaches, teachers, teammates, and friends, losing someone like Korey is never easy, but honor him by keeping his name alive and cherish those memories. To your family, these are darker days but Korey wouldn’t want you to hurt. He loved you dearly.\n\nWe often joked about me being able to beat you in basketball. I never did get that 1 on 1 game you promised, so be ready for me in the next life. I’ll miss you, man.\n\nWe wished you were still here, but God needed you more.\n\nThere’ll be a lot of hate over this situation but we have to forgive everyone. Even those who caused us harm.\n\nCorey, again we will all miss you. I spelled your name with a “C” that time because I remember you always hated it when I did that lol.\n\nRest easy Korey, keep smiling over us."
