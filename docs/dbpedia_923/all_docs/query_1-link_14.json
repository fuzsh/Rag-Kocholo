        "text": "Statehood\n\nDecember 7, 1787\n\nState Motto\n\n\"Liberty and Independence\"\n\nState Nickname\n\n\"The First State\"\n\nDelaware is known by this nickname due to the fact that on December 7, 1787, it became the first of the 13 original states to ratify the U.S. Constitution. “The First State” became the official State nickname on May 23, 2002 following a request by Mrs. Anabelle O'Malley's First Grade Class at Mt. Pleasant Elementary School.\n\nDelaware Code Title 29 § 318\n\nOther Nicknames\n\n\"The Diamond State\"\n\nThomas Jefferson gave this nickname to Delaware, according to legend, because he described Delaware as a \"jewel\" among states due to its strategic location on the Eastern Seaboard.\n\n\"Blue Hen State\"\n\nThis nickname was given to Delaware after the fighting Blue Hen Cocks that were carried with the Delaware Revolutionary War Soldiers for entertainment during Cockfights.\n\n\"Small Wonder\"\n\nThis nickname was given to Delaware due to its size and the contributions it has made to our country as a whole and the beauty of Delaware.\n\nState Capital\n\nDover\n\nThe town of New Castle, a port on the Delaware River, became the colonial capital of the \"Three Lower Counties\" (Delaware) in 1704. Under Pennsylvania's Deputy Governor John Evans, the assemblies of the colonies of Pennsylvania and Delaware separated though legislation enacted in both assemblies still required the Pennsylvania governor's signature. In November of 1704, four representatives from each county - New Castle, Kent, and Sussex met in the town and passed the colony's first two laws. One confirmed all laws previously enacted by the joint assembly of the colonies of Pennsylvania and Delaware. The second law changed the number of representatives from each county from four to six.\n\nWilliam Rodeney (as he spelled his name) of Kent County, grandfather of Caesar Rodney, served as the first-known speaker of the assembly. His grandson, Caesar, presided over the last colonial assembly in Delaware. The \"Three Lower Counties\" remained a part of Pennsylvania until 1776 when economic, cultural, and political differences fostered a permanent separation. The capital was moved from New Castle to Dover in 1777.\n\nState Government\n\n\"Delaware became a state on June 15, 1776,...\" on September 11, 1776, at a special constitutional convention,... Delaware enacted the Delaware Declaration of Rights...\n\nDelaware became a state on June 15, 1776, when the Delaware Assembly formally adopted a resolution declaring an end to Delaware’s status as a colony of Great Britain and establishing the three counties as an independent state under the authority of “the Government of the Counties of New Castle, Kent and Sussex Upon Delaware.” After the signing of the Declaration of Independence on July 4, 1776, the Delaware Assembly called a special constitutional convention, which assembled at New Castle on August 27, 1776. On September 11, 1776, the convention enacted the Delaware Declaration of Rights, similar in style to the later U.S. Bill of Rights. On September 21, 1776, the convention enacted the first Delaware Constitution. That first constitution served the state for a period of some 16 years until Delaware’s second state constitution was enacted by another constitutional convention in 1792. Our third state constitution was enacted in 1831 and our fourth, and current, constitution was enacted in 1897. Today, Delaware has a cabinet form of government.\n\nThe General Assembly, Delaware's lawmaking body, is comprised of a State House of Representatives, whose 41 members are elected for two-year terms, and a State Senate, whose 21 members are elected for four-year terms. Half of the Senate seats are contested in each general election.\n\nThe State Supreme Court consists of a chief justice and four associate justices. All members are appointed by the governor, with confirmation by the Senate, for a term of 12 years.\n\nState Seal\n\nThe state seal was first adopted on January 17, 1777, and contains the coat of arms. It also bears the inscription around it \"Great Seal of the State of Delaware\" and the dates 1704, 1776 and 1787. Descriptions of the contents of the seal are as follows:\n\nThe Wheat Sheaf\n\nAdapted from the Sussex County seal and signifies the agricultural vitality of Delaware\n\nThe Ship\n\nA symbol of New Castle County's ship building industry and Delaware's extensive coastal commerce\n\nThe Corn\n\nTaken from the Kent County seal, the corn also symbolizes the agricultural basis of Delaware's economy\n\nThe Farmer\n\nThe hoe represents the central role of farming to the state\n\nThe Militiaman\n\nWith his musket, the militiaman recognizes the crucial role of the citizen-soldier to the maintenance of American liberties\n\nThe Ox\n\nRepresents the importance of animal husbandry to the state economy\n\nThe Water\n\nAbove the Ox, stands for the Delaware River, the main stay of the state's commerce and transportation\n\nThe Motto\n\nDerived from the Order of Cincinnati, and approved in 1847\n\nThe Dates\n\n1704, the year that Delaware established its General Assembly; 1776, the year that our independence from Great Britain was declared; and 1787, the year that Delaware became \"the First State\" by being the first colony to ratify the United States Constitution.\n\nDelaware Code Title 29 § 301\n\nPlease Note\n\nThe State Seal can only be used with permission from the Delaware Secretary of State.\n\nSubmit a request to use the State seal here.\n\nDelaware Code Title 29 § 2306"
