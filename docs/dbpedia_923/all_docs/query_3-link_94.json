        "text": "It's all hunky-dory, because Joseph's decided to set out to see his childhood sweetheart. That'd be Fanny Goodwill, who lives back at Sir Thomas's country house.\n\nAdams told Joseph and Fanny to hold off on marrying until they were a bit older, even though they were totally in love.\n\nWeirdly enough, Joseph and Fanny haven't stayed in touch since Joseph headed off to London. Well, okay, that's because Fanny can't read or write.\n\nStill, Joseph is dead set on surprising Fanny. As he's gallivanting along the road, a surprise hailstorm forces him to hole up in an inn for a while. The owner of the inn is a dude named \"plain Tim.\"\n\nOnce the storm passes over, Joseph hits the road.\n\nJoseph only makes it about two miles before being accosted by some dastardly dudes. Obviously, they're out for Joseph's money.\n\nUnfortunately for Joseph, they're also after his clothes.\n\nWhen Joseph mouths off to the ruffians, they beat him up and leave him naked in a ditch by the road.\n\nJust when Joseph is about to lose hope, a stagecoach comes by. None of the fancy-schmancy occupants are interested in helping him out.\n\nâ€¦ That is, until a lawyer in the coach points out that ignoring this naked dude in the ditch could get everyone in some real legal trouble. Gotta love a lawyer.\n\nThe ruffians are still hiding out, waiting for some richer folks to come around so they can rob them. They take everyone's money, but Joseph's got nothing more to give.\n\nEven though the crew in the coach makes some jokes at Joseph's expense, they end up taking him to an inn to get fixed up.\n\nA kind maid, Betty, makes up a bed for Joseph while the innkeeper, Mr. Tow-wouse, gets him a shirt to wear. He's naked, remember?\n\nMrs. Tow-wouse, the innkeeper's wife, is none too pleased with this development. She plans to give Betty a stern scolding about her kindness.\n\nA surgeon's been sent for to put Joseph back together again.\n\nThe surgeon is totally convinced that Joseph is going to die. So much for optimism.\n\nMr. Tow-wouse sends for a clergyman, Mr. Barnabus, to give Joseph his last rites.\n\nMr. Barnabus is much more interested in lecturing everyone about religion.\n\nJoseph wants to write a letter to Fanny, even if he is dying. He's going to explain everything and say goodbye. Poor guy.\n\nAfter writing to Fanny, Joseph pens one last letter to \"adorable Pamela,\" his beloved sister. Looks like he's really planning to peace out.\n\nEven though Mrs. Tow-wouse refuses to bring Joseph tea, Betty takes pity on him and brings him a nice cuppa."
