        "text": "1. Introduction\n\nThe novel \"Joseph Andrews\" was written in the middle of the 18th century by Henry Fielding. In the novel, Fielding talks of human nature and of the need for control of sexuality. He does not fall back on the typical ideas of the time when dealing with such issues - he just goes about it in his own secular way. Fielding is rather on the side of acceptability, a look before you leap sort of mentality. He also reflects through the characters the views of vanity and of good breeding and its effect on your reputation in the 18th century. Fielding believed that our worth was not based on the obvious factors - he thought it was decided by those who knew us. As a result, he holds his characters to a higher standard than the rest of the world. He uses satire to reach his views. This satire is an all but openly sarcastic way of holding that higher standard over a character while pointing out the flaws in his logic and conduct. He holds each character up to ridicule while at the same time letting down his guard and letting the reader know that he is actually quite fond of that character.\n\n1.1 Background of \"Joseph Andrews\"\n\nThe original full title of Joseph Andrews clarifies the proposed scope of Fielding's writing, as it reads \"The History of the Adventures of Joseph Andrews, and of his Friend Mr. Abraham Adams. Written in Imitation of the Manner of Cervantes, Author of Don Quixote.\" Though many disagreements arise as to Fielding's primary intention - whether it was simply to mock the current sentimental/popular literature of his day, or if there was a more specific intent to parody Samuel Richardson's Pamela - Fielding categorically states his purpose. Joseph Andrews is seen on many levels as a response to the contemporary work of Richardson, a novel whose moral complexity and concern for the reality of everyday life grates against Fielding's own perception of a realist-based theory of the novel. Given the purpose of his imitation, and our understanding of the relationship between Fielding's early career as a playwright and his later novel writing (often the novel writing is seen as an admission of his inability to effect social change through the theatre), it is important to consider the work in its dramatic context. In the dedication to his sister's Journal of a Voyage, Fielding states that depictio ad imitandum is the key to understanding his literary intention. The writing is always an imitation of some experience/subject in order to represent it for didactic purposes. Such a method, when applied to the novel form, is imitative of life itself, with the novel functioning as a separate but connected existence to the living world. Fielding became angry over the public response to his plays, often claiming that his plays were the subject of political attack, and yet his private correspondence satirized their lack of popularity. This tension between the playwright and the stage can be related to the tension between novel and life within the work of Joseph Andrews.\n\n1.2 Overview of the Theme of Vanity\n\nThe field of aesthetics has perhaps been dominated by the concepts of transience and permanence with relation to materials, and it is works of art that concern the latter which have been most prized. Yet material objects are valuable only inasmuch as they occupy a position in space and time, and exist as indices to the reality, status, and power of their possessor. With the realization of the transience of the reality, status, and power of the possessor himself, there often comes a preoccupation with leaving some more lasting memorial, and hence the conception of the immortality of the soul has been linked with the vanity of being. The vanity of \"all human show\" has generally been taken for granted as a theme in Fielding's novel. How this bears upon the particular theme of the immortality of Parson Adams is not clear at first sight, yet Levy has stated that the \"argument\" of Joseph Andrews is the Progress of the Human Mind. This progress leads from the foolish simplicity and credulity of Parson Adams to a higher degree of knowledge and \"ripeness of understanding,\" which is frequently symbolized in the novel by his getting the better of his low crafty wife. The Parson's character is often assumed to represent that which Fielding approves. Viewed as a good man according to his lights, he embodies the honest and virtuous. Yet the dignity of man is usually said to consist in his potentiality rather than his actuality, and it is the potentiality of Parson Adams which makes him most interesting as a field for the progress of mind. It is his being a fine scholar and a good Christian, with the contrast between learning and Christianity to the Irony of the Augustan age, which provide him with the reason to lament his fate as man and consider the immortal soul. This suggests that Parson Adams is intended as a representation of the Human Mind itself, a theory which finds some evidence in the \"intrigues\" between the author and his character's.\n\n2. Vanity in Characters\n\nFoster uses several characters that are shown to be \"vain,\" in the sense that they are perceived to be overly concerned with appearances and social and economic advancement. Several of these characters are utilized to show the folly of vanity, and the negative ramifications of being too caught up in one's appearance and station. Lady Booby does not appear to be satisfied with any of her admirers at Booby-Hall as she has brought Joseph away for two overtime, to become more acquainted with him, and because she finds him pleasing to the eye. Even after hiring Joseph as her footman, she tries to push that advancement even further. This is evidenced by the incident with the purse where discovering that her attempts to fund Joseph had been misconstrued, she resolved to show him more favor, and offered to make him her steward. This incident Joseph narrowly ended up avoiding by threatening to leave her. At the end of the novel, as Lady Booby has become increasingly infatuated with Joseph, she is on the brink of trying to seduce him to enhance and signalize her self-importance. Lady Booby is depicted as so dissatisfied with her position in life that she will stop at nothing to try and change it, and even desires at failing any improvements she tried to make for the serve good of others be it Adams, Fanny, or Joseph. Lady Booby doesn't care about there being minor benefits to her very wrath and disappointment would be useful: but that came out of it afterwards, but things serve-meat to cure and looked at me; resounded as it is that I may be miscarried.\n\n2.1 Analysis of Lady Booby's Vanity\n\nThe novel states, \"The man of vanity will always provoke the man of pride to lay any man and himself under the weight of expense necessity.\" This book confirms the truth of this maxim, dealing with minute and petty characters unless they bring themselves to notice and voice results on Joseph and Fanny after they leave service as youth to decide that they cannot live a more suitable life on a servant's income. Lady Booby, when she hears of her husband's health, leaves the country to see to it that she will be in a position to become further dependent and become a widow who is still young and in need of some suitable companionship. Lady Booby's concern for her own welfare is great, and we see here that she is afraid of falling to the state of humiliation described by the maxim. This is why she follows Joseph to the country and manages to influence him as a relative and sometime perhaps by marriage Fanny Goodwill to move to the next village. We should note that this is not to be the only marriage of vanity. The story of Mrs. Slip and her marriage to \"the most remarkable amongst them for understanding and improvements\" is worthy of mention. Joseph and Fanny, however, are a pure and innocent pair who have grown up in the lower class. Thus, their primary concern is their welfare and the welfare of those around them. Lady Booby's decision to visit Let's the wages one of the first of many attempts to provoke an association and gain the companion she so long desires. We will read on and see she is purposeful and at all times focused on getting her way. Any and all foils to her plans meet with her strong opposition, culminating in violence and elimination of those who oppose her ideal state. Lady Booby resolves to spare no value in attempting to attain her goal.\n\n2.2 The Role of Joseph Andrews in Exposing Vanity\n\nJoseph's character foils Lady Booby's vanity in a comic and satirical manner. Fielding's use of the word 'put' in the narrative voice, as Joseph resolves to leave, accentuates Lady Booby's frustration and lack of independence. From the beginning of the novel, Joseph is defined as a 'handsome footman', whose external appearance often deceives those he meets. When we look at his encounter with Bloomer and the execution of him as a surgeon, the scene is hysterical. The fact that Joseph attacks him, later realizing it is not the same man who tried to rape Fanny, only to further beat him, demonstrates his naivety. The characters' insolence and lack of respect for social hierarchy cause 'upper' characters to lower themselves and thus expose their true natures. Lady Booby's attraction for Joseph offers evident jealousy from Slipslop; \"Lady Booby had a hint or two thrown out... that she thought Joseph handsome,\" although lustful, it is Joseph's proposed marriage to Fanny that truly infuriates Lady Booby and taints her conduct and reputation. During a conversation where she tries to affect an air of superiority, Joseph brings Lady Booby down to his lowly status with an uncharacteristic show of intelligence; \"Joseph,\" said she, \"I believe thou art a very good sort of fellow, and as I have some interest with your lady, I will make the butler put thee in the alehouse and give thee a mug of her strong beer.\" \"No,\" said Joseph, \"I won't change my old master and mistress for any other in England.\" This is proven as she lambastes him in her letters to lawyer Scout and later confronts Fanny, in a desperate attempt to hold on to Joseph and maintain her reputation. Lady Booby's failure to realize her high society aspirations defines her, and others are fooled by Joseph's mocking of his own social aspirations, readily supporting his 'high birth' in the view that it will improve his chronic. Lady Booby cannot cope with the fact that she is being rejected by a lowly footman, and her actions to oppose this only result in tainting her reputation and leaving Joseph and Fanny in a better position. Lady Booby's motive to remove Joseph from the parish springs from vanity and an attempt to prevent a future humiliation of her affections, and the novel reveals that their sarcastic high society scenes are merely role reversals at the expense of Lady Booby. Lady Booby employs Lawyer Scout to scare Joseph and prevent a marriage with Fanny through slandering her name by calling her a harlot and falsely prophesying great things for Joseph's future with an \"old lady at a neighboring seat.\" Lady Booby only accomplishes entangling herself in her own web contrivance and ignorance due to ambiguous terms which lead to Scout's advances on her, and the revelation of both the legend of her and Joseph's true status at the gentry dinner. Lady Booby's further humiliation and damage to her reputation is evident on Joseph's return from captivity, through illness Fanny and Adams have been left poor and jobless. Lady Booby offers them money to 'lay in' some Gonson's medicine; \"as she would never trouble them more, and he should see there was no malice for what was past.\" This is more an attempt to disguise her guilt and alleviate herself from having to deal with them, and Joseph's retort; \"I humbly thank your ladyship; I don't know a body upon earth who hath so much to give as you.\" is a final mocking of her pretensions and aspirations.\n\n2.3 Parson Adams' Contrast to Vanity\n\nLady Booby's character demonstrates that this type of vanity is more sexual vanity. She often is motivated by lust. After being rejected by Joseph, she turns her lustful glances onto other people, focusing for a while on the aged but wealthy Mr. Booby and then on Joseph's best friend. This is why she eventually gives up her pursuits and runs off with someone else when she doesn't gain her desire. This is Fielding's way of showing that a person will not always gain that which they desire to possess and the moment they realize this, they will cease all efforts to obtain it. This is unlike Adam's, who will pursue what is right and just and never acknowledge defeat. Parson Adams provides the contrast for vanity, being a man who is benevolent, kind-hearted, innocent, and unassuming. Though Parson Adams' vanity is of the more innocent and comical kind, he is often unwittingly self-satisfied and dogmatic in his belief that he is always right. His vanity is associated with his great love of learning and his desire to be considered learned. He exhibits a complete lack of common sense in situations where common sense would serve him better than scholarly knowledge. For example, when he has to decide what to do with his money in order to get Fanny back from her captors, he addresses his problem to the captive who knows only to steal and lose his money.\n\n3. Vanity and Society\n\nFielding uses Vanity to delve into the mechanics of the society of his time. The society was corrupt because there was a great information. Vanity gave people belief that they belonged to a different class than where they fell, for example, Shamela states that she is the daughter of gentry throughout the book. Fielding tries to demonstrate that there are fundamental flaws in the structure of a society where someone can be of low class and not have a good reputation yet be full of vanity and consider themselves a cut above the rest. Fielding does this through the example of Shamela who is not much above a servant in class but through vanity attempts to win over Joseph and force a marriage completely beyond what anyone of her status could have ever hoped to achieve. Though the book is humorous and often on the lighter side, Fielding is very serious in attempting to point out these flaws in society as they would have been seen by him. Fielding works specifically to show how vanity is detracting from the strength of good relationships between people. An excellent example is the short stay at the country inn where the host offers Joseph his daughter, a marriage with great advantage. The daughter gives Joseph more money than he asked to drink to her health in the future in too familiar a manner. Here Fielding is playing with the ideas of class and wealth in the marriage market and showing how vanity can lead a person of higher class to go against their own best interests and to statistics lower marriage. The daughter will have spoiled her chance of upward social mobility. Fielding presents a situation that is absurd and meant to be laughed at, but he is constantly using it as a vehicle to show the ill effects of vanity on these relationships.\n\nThe detour in Booby's and Shamela's carriage is occasioned by different sins, but both authors depict how individual events are used to satisfy their whims. Both want to make ostentatious displays of their wealth by having a grandiose wedding. Shamela would descend from the high life then resort to being a lady squire for \"I design to live in the imitation of my lady Booby.\" This, of course, is a clever ploy by Shamela to improve her situation and satirizes those who had the same intentions. Fielding had expressed a similar sentiment when Booby had decided to marry her in the grand style of a Lord's wedding. These are two examples which show through different classes and circumstances the attempts of vanity to dignify itself by apeing others. Furthermore, these two events create a double bind in the relationships of Shamela and Booby, Joseph and Fanny. A Peacock claims that Shamela's goal for a higher station of life has affected Booby, who now wants to keep her as his mistress rather than marry her. This could be to ensure Shamela does not blow all his assets and especially now she will not be heiress to them. The reason being a marriage is less prestigious than the previous one proposed. Joseph's concern is Fanny's lost honor, and he as a footman cannot properly repair the damage that has been done to it. This is all a sharp dissection of how vanity can have ill effects that transcend class lines and further damage the prospects of the vain individual as well as others around him.\n\n3.2 The Effects of Vanity on Relationships\n\nVanity is a characteristic of narcissistic pride and self-worth. It can lead to the downfall of an individual as they can be overtaken by their arrogance. It is often expressed through appearance, relationships, and status. Vanity can initially be mistaken for high self-esteem. Margaret Dobson argues, \"People with high self-esteem value individual freedom and responsibility. They feel competent and they feel deserving.\" High self-esteem differs from vanity as it does not bolster the way an individual perceives themselves as superior to others. Self-esteem is a healthy standard of self-worth and is key to psychological well-being. Vanity can be harmful to our minds and bodies. It can lead to overspending, unhealthy diets, body dysmorphic disorder, and plastic surgery. People often feel better about themselves when they have a new haircut, purchase new clothes, or have lost weight. This is not directly related to vanity as it is a normal way to increase self-perception. High vanity is displayed when an individual compulsively exercises, becomes obsessed with their appearance, and looks down upon others less attractive. Vanity has always been a vice that people despise because of the negative connotations associated with it. This paper will be discussing the way vanity shapes the relationship between Joseph Andrews and Lady Booby as well as the consequences the lady suffers because of her vanity.\n\n3.3 Critique of Vanity in Fielding's Time\n\nFielding was writing in the Augustan age, where society was often avaricious and of avaricious intent, which greatly contributed to the increase of social and personal vanity. He was satirizing a very tumultuous period in English history, for it was an age in which sharp class distinctions collided, a time when there was a growing population, a strong economic expansion, and a large degree of political unrest. Fielding's England was one in which individuals of all walks of life were clamoring to move up the social ladder, and it was every man's hope to attain higher status and limit the gap between those of higher birth. The result was an extreme self-consciousness about one's social situation, a culture that concentrated on reputation and an outsider's perception of an individual, mute testimony to the age's vanity. This vanity was not limited to the common man and the gentry, but even the nobility, or the \"persons of higher rank,\" were not immune to social desire and often chased rainbows of higher status. Fielding's disillusionment with his society was much due to the belief that individuals were seeking status in order to improve their well-being and stand well in society, and very rarely took into account whether the position would enable a person to perform a societal duty. This is illustrated through the character of Mr. Slipslop, who is convinced that marrying the gamekeeper would be a step down and not worthy of her beauty, although she will remain hopelessly devoted to him while pursuing a now unattainable higher social life. The age's social mobility led individuals to desert relationships and old ties in climbing the ladder, a practice that would greatly undermine social unity and further depreciate an already devalued worth of a man in his true status.\n\n4. Conclusion\n\nRefrain from vanity seems to be a great message to take out of this book. Henry Fielding installs a strong emphasis on the ill effects of vanity. Not only does he create characters that fully encompass vanity, but he shows how it has direct effects on their life-changing decisions, and generally doesn't bode well with them. Throughout Joseph Andrews, many characters seem to be detached from their natural inclinations for one reason or another, and this is because they are following or trying to accomplish something due to the pressure vanity has put upon them. Lady Booby provides the clearest example of this. Having vowed to remain loyal to her husband until his death, she quickly changes her mind at his funeral. She has vowed to maintain the position of a woman whose husband held an esteemed place in society. Her vanity has gotten the best of her, and she vows not to stay in Henreietta's cottage, but rather, maintain her rank and station in Henreietta's heart. This prompts her to make later advancements on Joseph, for she is trying to maintain the high standards she has set for herself. Hence, the aforementioned change from their natural state destroyed the joy of many people. Lady Booby ends up returning to London, for the sake of keeping up appearances. She knows that she has stepped out of her social sphere and does not think she can deal with it whilst maintaining her vanity. Lady Booby's misadventures end up having a butterfly effect on her nephew and maid, and it is all in an attempt to make a quick recovery back to her old way of life. Lady Booby becomes an example for the ill effects of vanity in old age when she barely escapes a mishap involving her legs in the countryside. Lady Booby attempts to cover up her folly by trying to get Joseph to admit he caused her ailment. This is in stark contrast to a just and honorable outcome of their problem. Lady Booby saying she finally won't have Joseph with her old legs puts much emphasis on her improvement in state. This situation illustrates what Fielding is trying to accomplish by showing people their actions and how they have changed. Lady Booby has a short reversion to her earlier behavior, in trying to employ Joseph to satisfy her lust, but she is soon disillusioned and makes a decision to swallow her pride and return to her proper station in life. She resigns herself to no longer have Joseph and Parson Adams around, for she now knows that their presence only deprives her of serving her own interests. Lady Booby's final action of sending for her nephew and niece is an attempt to have Gurtrude mend the trail of disaster she has left, and it is here that Lady Booby is seldom content with what she has had. This entire saga has a detrimental effect on Fielding's beloved couple, but Lady Booby leaving the country and dying before she can fully realize her results is a very satisfactory end to a woman who acted out of her vanity.\n\n4.1 Recap of the Theme of Vanity\n\nThe forms of vanity that Joseph Andrews, Parson Adams, and Lady Booby exhibit are typified by a kind of \"unnaturalness\" because each presumes to be something that he or she is not. Lady Booby, in her attempts to be a young flirtatious lady, makes herself appear vulgar and graceless. Her attempts to seduce Joseph do not at all befit her position as a widow of high social standing. Parson Adams shows vanity in thinking that he is a man of learning and wit. This is a far stretch from the truth, for Adams is an ignorant man and the situations in which he tries to use his \"learning\" are very comic. He attempts to save the reputation of the Folly Theatre with his classical knowledge. However, he stumbles upon saying, \"Pygmalion changed a raggamuffin female into a goddess and the statue of dame Nature into Jupiter or a satyr\" (FA p. 86) and he is met with roaring jeers from the audience. His discomfiture and anger with the failure of his attempt show his assumed superiority and is quite uncharacteristic of a man of true learning and confidence. Joseph, as a man true to his class, shows little vanity and when he does it is the natural sort. This is seen when he attempts to wear the jacket of a servant in order to conceal his identity and run away from Lady Booby. Fielding gives thorough treatment of the consequences of this vanity in others in Book II, Chapter I where he narrates the story of the friendship between Leonora and Laetitia and the calamities that befall them stemming from Lady Booby's attempt to marry Leonora to the \"nephew\" of Adams. These events are highly representative of what Fielding as a justice had often seen during his career and his views are reflected in the scathing rebuke that he makes Adams deliver to them after Leonora's ruin. An even more vivid picture of the ill effects of vanity is given throughout the whole affair of the impostor Peter Pounce. Fielding's didactic purpose is quite clearly seen as he epitomizes the natural man, Joseph, in contrast to the consummate poseur, Mrs. Slipslop. Her attempts to mimic her mistress and engage in an affair with Joseph lead to her stupidity and complete humiliation. This is punctuated by the episode in which she loses the horses and Joseph in her attempt to outdo Lady Booby, dress finely with the intention of seducing Joseph and becoming his wife. Her scam with the ring and his denial of it followed by her pathetic attempt to follow him in this guise on foot are quite humorous and are meant to show the consequences of one who is false to his true state. She reappears briefly as an illustration of the vanity of attempting to rise in Book III chapter XII but much of this is unfinished. Unfortunately Joseph's character as a pure man of the people is inconsistently portrayed and when he accepts his position as Fanny's husband, he takes on airs that are quite unnatural and seem vainglorious, curiously mirroring one whom he has scorned. But the ultimate comparison is between Joseph and the squire who is representative of the downfall of the aristocracy in Fielding's time and it will be shown briefly.\n\n4.2 Fielding's Message on Vanity in \"Joseph Andrews\"\n\nIntroduction When we talk about the theme of vanity in Joseph Andrews, it looks like Fielding's main aim was to reveal the hypocrisy of a certain class of contemporary society. His moral intention became specific as he saw the vices and follies of his age in the context of the eternal human predicament. Fielding exposes human vanity and pride in their true perspective and how these affect social conduct, behavior, and attitude even towards individuals who are closely related. He found the fashionable society given to \"foppery,\" and to augment the comic effect of Joseph's finery, he was persuaded. Folly is generally speaking a comic vice for Fielding. His representation of Lady Booby shows how this snobbery grew out of class pride; she despairs of Joseph because he is not a gentleman, and her preference for the 'racish' dishonorable method of securing Joseph to her footmen shows the only value she places on social distinction. Fielding's Message on Vanity Fielding takes a realistic account of life in his society, therefore trying to relate the behavior of some individuals to the society which makes them behave in such a manner. Joseph, being sincere and honest but lacking strength to remain so when confronted with the varieties of persons and events, is the hopeful representative of a nascent middle class in its upward struggle from the state of dependence and difficulty. Lady Booby is representative of the decadent nobility and the servant class from whose anxieties maintenance the middle class was seeking escape. And the story of Joseph's trials and expedients in remaining honest is the story of the middle class in the modern and the morrow."
