        "text": "Turning the Hearts of Our Enemies The Game-Theoretical Design of Henry Fielding's Joseph Andrews\n\nOverheads for a lecture\n\nin Elizabeth Heckendorn Cook's English 30, W97\n\nFrancis Steen\n\nDepartment of English, UCSB\n\nMonday, March 3, 1997\n\nThemes\n\nGame-theoretical model: how to achieve cooperation\n\nCheater detection: how to tell the truth behind appearances\n\nCommercial society versus the traditional agrarian society: resolving the conflict in a creative conceptual blend\n\nThe destabilization and reaffirmation of gender codes\n\nEvents in Book I\n\nJoseph is dismissed for refusing Lady Booby's advances\n\nRobbed on the way home, he is left for dead in a ditch\n\nA lawyer in a coach saves him to prevent a lawsuit\n\nBetty the chambermaid gives him a bed at the Tow-wouse's inn\n\nThe surgeon and parson Barnabas pronounce him dying\n\nParson Adams arrives and makes sure he recovers\n\nBetty tries to seduce Joseph and ends up with Mr. Tow-wouse\n\nA. Cooperation\n\nJoseph doesn't want to give in to Lady Booby\n\nThe thief takes his money for nothing and beats him up too\n\nThe people in the coach at first see no reason to help him\n\nMrs. Tow-wouse thinks he's not worth taking care of\n\nJoseph's failure to enlist people's cooperation almost kills him\n\nThe Problem of Cooperation in Game Theory\n\nJoseph (player B)\n\nCooperate\n\nDefect\n\nCooperate\n\nA provides service and gets\n\nbenefit (R)\n\nA provides service but gets no benefit (S)\n\nA\n\nB accepts service and pays\n\ncost (R)\n\nB accepts service but pays no cost (T)\n\nDefect\n\nA provides no service but gets\n\nbenefit (T)\n\nA provides no service and gets no benefit (Z)\n\nB gets no service but pays\n\ncost (S)\n\nB gets no service and pays no cost (Z)\n\nT = Temptation\n\nR = Reward for cooperating\n\nZ = Zero outcome; no cooperation\n\nS = Sucker's payoff\n\nT > R > Z > S\n\nThe thief falls for Temptation and leaves Joseph with a Sucker's payoff\n\nThe people in the coach worry about Sucker's payoff and prefer no cooperation (Z)\n\nMrs. Tow-wouse worries about Sucker's payoff and prefers no cooperation\n\nParson Trulliber worries about Sucker's payoff and prefers no cooperation\n\nLogic keeps pushing people towards Z/Z: no trust, no cooperation. In this way, people avoid the worst outcome (S)--but fail to realize what would be better for all (R/R). Scoundrels keep trying for T, the best of all outcomes.\n\nThe problem of any community: how to realize the benefits of cooperation, or move from Z to R.\n\nWhat makes it even more difficult is what is known as Banker's Paradox: the bank will lend you money only if you can prove you don't need it.\n\nJoseph becomes victim to the Banker's Paradox: he's really in trouble and needs help badly--and this is precisely when people are the most reluctant to help him, because they're worried they'll be stuck with a Sucker's payoff\n\nParson Adams' Solution to the Cooperation Problem\n\nIn Richardson's Pamela, the actions of the heroine could be interpreted to be basically selfish--as Fielding's parody Shamela shows\n\nThis morality doesn't overcome the Banker's Paradox, since you would only help people who can provide you with significant advantages\n\nIn Joseph Andrews, Fielding wanted to propose a more radical morality: always cooperate, on the basis of\n\nEmpathy\n\nEmpathy means to be open to experiencing another's distress, which will lead you to cooperate even if the favor cannot be instantly (or ever) reciprocated, at least not personally\n\nParson Adams showed \"a great deal of emotion at the distress of this poor creature\" (50), before he knows it is Joseph\n\nHe holds \"it was the duty of men of all professions to apply their skill gratis for the relief of the poor and necessitous\" (51)\n\nHe says of the second inn-keeper, who shows no compassion for Joseph's bruised leg, \"he believed the devil had more humanity\" (99)\n\nHe asks Trulliber to lend him money \"which, peradventure, I shall return to you\" (140)\n\nHe argues we should \"forgive others their debts\" (184)\n\nHe is \"the good parson, whose heart was naturally disposed to love and affection\" (145)\n\nHe \"always sympathized with his friends on [sad] occasions\" (189)\n\nIn contrast, Mrs. Tow-wouse shows \"an insensibility to human misery\" (160)\n\nIf most people are empathic and compassionate, this works as insurance: the risk is spread out, and on average everyone is much better off\n\nAs Adams puts it at the end of the book, the aim is \"not only to defeat the designs of our enemies, but even to turn their hearts\" (265)\n\nThat is, to move not from Sucker's payoff to Zero (which is the main concern of the unvirtuous characters), but to a stable cooperation.\n\nThe empathic strategy, however, is vulnerable to cheaters, who consistently fall for Temptation and leave you with a Sucker's payoff\n\nSince nobody has infinite resources, nobody can survive a long string of Sucker's payoffs--Joseph is cutting it very close\n\nParson Adams doesn't deal with cheaters very well--he is too gullible\n\nB. Seeing through appearances, cheater detection\n\nThe second book is a string of people who are not what they seem\n\nParson Adams is not very good at seeing though people\n\nHe sees no further into people than they desire him to\n\nThis makes him extra vulnerable to the Sucker's payoff\n\nEvents in Book II\n\nAdams walks off and Joseph is stuck with the bill for the horse\n\nAdams hears the two lawyers blame and praise a justice (the pretend virtue of truthfulness)\n\nSlipslop rescues Joseph; in the coach they hear the story of Leonora\n\nAdams encounters the self-proclaimed patriot (the pretended virtue of courage)\n\nHe rescues Fanny from rape before he knows it's her--but almost gets killed\n\nThe assailant manages to stick the blame on them (the pretended virtue of the innocent victim)\n\nThey are recognized at the justice's and released, and walk to the next inn\n\nFanny faints when she hears Joseph, and Adams throws his Aeschylus on the fire\n\nJoseph and Fanny meet, and Adams dances for joy\n\nAdams visits Trulliber, the avaricious parson who pretends to be a man of charity (the pretended virtue of charity)\n\nThey encounter the man of false promises (the pretended virtue of magnanimity or generosity)\n\nAdams and the alehouse keeper discuss book learning and life experience\n\nAt this point, Joseph begins to assert himself:\n\nAdams' gullibility has got them into trouble again--they're stuck with the bill\n\nJoseph knows Adams is wrong to believe that \"knowledge of men is only to be learnt from books\" (150)\n\nNor do we have much reason to rely on his conviction that \"a skilful physiognomist will rarely be deceived\" (155)\n\nIn the next book, the whole sequence with the Roasting Squire demonstrates that Adams lacks the ability to detect deception\n\nThe doctor, for instance, \"could laugh inwardly without betraying the least symptoms in his countenance\" (211), tricking Adams into a tub of water\n\nThe moral of this is that Joseph cannot rely on Adams alone: society is not what Adams thinks it is, and poses a set of problems that are not all solved in old books\n\nC. Literature as a Social Reference Library\n\nDevelopmental psychology\n\nHumans tend to look to others--elders and peers--for guidance for how to behave\n\nA six month old infant crawling on a glass floor with a 'visual cliff' will pause and look to the mother\n\nIf the mother shows anxiety, the infant will retreat and maybe start crying\n\nIf the mother smiles and nods, the infant will crawl onto the glass--in spite of its fear of heights\n\nEvolutionary psychology\n\nFor much longer than recorded history, human beings have lived in tribes of around a hundred people\n\nA vital aid for survival has consistently been the knowledge obtained from others in the group--typically elder teaching\n\nHumans are biologically disposed to acquire culture--to look to others, rather than continually reinventing the wheel\n\nEmpathy is the cognitive adaptation for solving the cooperation problem--but culture, or elder-teaching, determines how it is activated\n\nHuman cooperation is enabled by empathy and regulated through emotions such as affection, goodwill, gratitude, trust, and confidence; and also guilt, anger, fear, and resentment\n\nThe Historical Village Community\n\nRenaissance society still has elements of the tribal community\n\nMost people still live in villages--perhaps 90%\n\nEven in the cities, craftsmen live in guilds, or stable neighborhoods\n\nA single morality--or standard of behavior--is preached from the pulpits\n\nThe world was imagined to be a single coherent body--the Great Chain of Being\n\nThe Late Seventeenth and Early Eighteenth Centuries\n\nSociety is conceived of as a mechanism rather than an organism\n\nMassive urbanization: people move into spaces without real communities\n\nTrade becomes a significant new source of wealth\n\nEconomic efficiency creates room for social mobility and independence\n\nThe aristocracy loses its idiological dominance\n\nThe new society needs a new set of morals\n\nThe Birth of the Novel\n\nPeople are looking for a set of social reference points to orient themselves\n\nRichardson's Familiar Letters sets out to do this--a form of elder teaching\n\nIt grows into a novel, Pamela, which functions as social reference\n\nSince \"examples work more forcibly on the mind than precepts\" (13), the novel--or \"biography\" as Fielding calls it--is a more effective form of elder teaching than moral treatises\n\nThe Hollywood bankrobbery on Friday appears to have been scripted in the movie Heat, down to the costumes\n\nFielding claims \"emulation inspires our imitation in an irresistible manner\" (13), and focuses on describing good individuals\n\nDeceitful behavior will also be depicted, \"to hold the glass to thousands in their closets, that they may contemplate their deformity, and endeavour to reduce it\" (159)\n\nThe kinds of things that can go wrong are depicted, and the cause is frequently a lack of good advice:\n\nLeonora ends in a pickle because she gets poor advice from her aunt\n\nThe female narrator of the story deplores the \"blameable levity in the education of our sex\" (109)\n\nMr. Wilson imputes all his misfortunes to an \"early introduction into life, without a guide\" (170)\n\nBut Joseph Andrews does more than describe human nature, or give a stock set of rules of behavior. It provides--in the figure of Joseph, the hopeful hero of the emerging middle class--a way of working out a solution that did not exist before.\n\nEvents in Book III\n\nAdams, Joseph, and Fanny get scared by lights and voices\n\nThey are invited in to Mr. Wilson's house to rest\n\nHe tells them his story of the Rake's Progress\n\nThis is how he becomes a good judge of character, and learns to see through false appearances--such as the coquettes, who \"are never what they seem\" (177)\n\nMr. Wilson in a man of the world who has deliberately constructed his life in the country, drawing on the best of both worlds and creating his own\n\nThey depart and are entertained by the Roasting Squire\n\nIll treated, they flee and take in at The New Inn\n\nThe squire's men come to kidnap Fanny, and succeed\n\nShe is freed by Peter Pounce, Lady Booby's steward\n\nThey cover the final miles to Lady Booby's parish\n\nCommercial society versus traditional agrarian society: resolving the conflict in a creative conceptual blend\n\nThe Novel is the space where the ideology of the middle class is developed\n\nWilson, the Gentleman Farmer, embodies the virtues of the self-sufficient man--with money deriving from the wine-business in London\n\nDesire is acceptable if its gratification does not destabilize the social order\n\nCompassion and empathy is reduced by the insulation provided by a retirement from the world--the forerunner of suburbia--and tempered by skilful cheater detection\n\nAt the end, Joseph \"declares he will imitate [his parents] in their retirement\" (298)--we here have the social referent of choice\n\nD. Reaffirming Destabilized Gender Codes\n\nEvents in Book IV\n\nThey all arrive at Booby-Hall\n\nLady Booby is still torn between love and pride\n\nShe tells Adams to prevent the match; he refuses\n\nShe enlists lawyer Scout to get rid of them; he acquiesces\n\nHer nephew Mr. Booby and his wife Pamela arrive\n\nAs Joseph and Fanny are about to be sent to prison, Mr. Booby frees them\n\nLady Booby is jealous of Fanny and schemes to get rid of her\n\nShe talks her nephew into trying to convince Joseph; Joseph stands firm\n\nBeau Didapper accosts her and kisses her on the street\n\nHis servant pimp tries to buy her and rape her, but is beaten by Joseph\n\nMrs. Adams advices the parson to stay out of trouble\n\nAdams advices Joseph not to love Fanny too much\n\nThe pedlar saves his son Dick from drowning\n\nLady Booby and Beau Didapper comes to visit the parson's house\n\nDick reads them the story of Leonard and Paul\n\nBeau offers Fanny settlements and starts fondling her\n\nJoseph boxes him on the ear, but a fight is averted\n\nThe pedlar announces that Fanny is Joseph's sister\n\nSlipslop informs Lady Booby that Beau's servants will kidnap Fanny\n\nThe project is dropped when they find out she is Fanny Andrews\n\nThe whole gang spends the night at Booby-Hall\n\nBeau goes to rape Fanny, but ends up in Slipslop's bed\n\nSlipslop holds on to him and cries rape\n\nAdams comes and beats up the masculine Slipslop\n\nLady Booby discovers them both naked\n\nAdams returns to his room, but ends up in Fanny's\n\nJoseph finds them (innocently) together in the morning\n\nGammar Andrews reveal the babies had been exchanged\n\nMr. Wilson testifies that Joseph is his lost son; Lady B leaves in agony\n\nThey all go to Mr. Booby's place, celebrate the wedding, and undress Fanny in front of the narrator, \"discovering, not putting off, ornaments\" (297), unlike Shamela, who is \"with all the pride of ornament cast off\" (305).\n\nAfter a pleasant wedding night, Fanny gets £2,000 from Mr. Booby, Adams a living of £130 a year, and Joseph and Fanny settle near his parents.\n\nReaffirming Destabilized Gender Codes\n\nIn Book I, there is the assumption of a symmetry of gender codes:\n\nFemale mistresses desire their servants as much as male masters desire their maids\n\nWomen (Lady Boody, Slipslop, and Betty) are attracted to men exclusively because of their external appearance and youth, just as men are conventionally attracted to women for their youth and beauty\n\nWomen attracted to men desire to sleep with them instantly, just as men conventionally have little inclination to delay consummation\n\nMale servants have has much reason to preserve their 'virtue' (chastity) as female maids do\n\nAt the end of Book I and throughout Book II, the traditional gender codes begin to reassert themselves:\n\nBetty's active desires are diverted to make her the \"the vanquished one\" who \"quietly submitted to her master's will\" (72)\n\nMrs. Tow-wouse is furious, but mainly at Betty, and quickly composes herself; his infidelity is no very serious matter\n\nLeonora makes a fatal female mistake: she is inconstant, and spends the rest of her life bemoaning it\n\nHoratio still loves her, she is (for what we know) still a virgin; the mere knowledge she has loved another spoils her in the respectable marriage market\n\nFanny is rescued from a rapist, after a violent fight: a lot is clearly at stake\n\nWhen Fanny and Joseph meet, Fanny is shy and coy, Joseph forward and eager\n\nIn Book III, the value of Fanny's virtue in general and virginity in particular comes to the fore:\n\nWomen do wisely to consider \"the many occasions on which the strength of a man may be useful to you\" (163), most notably to keep other men off\n\nShe is more frightened of men than ghosts (165)\n\nMr. Wilson's youth demonstrates what happens to young girls who don't take care of their virtue\n\nHe ruins a girl promised in marriage to a humbler but better man; her mind is ruined by the company of other kept mistresses, she steals money from him and leaves him, and ends up as a prostitute\n\nThe unfaithful wife is abandoned by her husband, and Mr. Wilson's fondness for her does not last\n\nFinally, the constant Harriet Hearty wins all his affection, gets him out of prison, marries him, and has children with him--the perfect glue in a companionate marriage (\"for what union can be so fast as our common interest in the fruits of our embraces?\" (191)\n\nThe Roasting Squire's designs to rape her heighten the sense of the pivotal value of her virginity; Joseph, tied to the bedpost, agonizes over her \"untained innocence\" (225)\n\nIn Book IV, the continued fuss about Fanny's virtue is supplemented by these final elements:\n\nGammar Andrews knowledge about Joseph not being their son that she conceals from her husband\n\nHow can a husband be sure that his wife's child is his?\n\nPerhaps men are obsessed with female virtue because men who didn't care much ended up raising other men's children?\n\nFielding proudly announces Fanny is pregant at the end--and the implication is that Joseph can't possibly have anything to worry about\n\nBack to Literary Resources: The Rise of the Novel Back to Cognitive Literary Studies CogWeb index"
