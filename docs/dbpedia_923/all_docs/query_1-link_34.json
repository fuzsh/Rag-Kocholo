        "text": "Non-Voting Members\n\nLt. Jim Andrews, Oregon State Police\n\nCherie Barnstable, Adapt Integrated Health Care\n\nTheresa Haworth, Oregon Youth Authority\n\nMission Statement\n\nThe Local Public Safety Coordinating Council (LPSCC) updated and adopted a new Mission Statement during their Council meeting on February 6, 2024. The Mission Statement is as follows:\n\nThe Douglas County Local Public Safety Coordinating Council is a collaborative leadership panel comprised of representatives from County, City and Tribal governments, law enforcement agencies, nonprofits, medical and local businesses tasked with addressing critical issues affecting community safety by implementing evidence-based strategies. The Council reviews uses for State and local resources, develops ongoing improvements to policies and procedures, determines the most effective rehabilitation strategy, and cooperatively builds relationships to reduce barriers and access to mental health services, homelessness, substance use disorders, clean and sober housing, employment opportunities, housing shortages, crime, and recidivism for a healthy community.\n\nAbout the Council\n\nThe Douglas County Local Public Safety Coordinating Council (LPSCC) acts as an advisory body to the Board of Commissioners on public safety policy matters.\n\nSenate Bill 1145, passed by the Legislature in 1995, requires every county in Oregon to convene a Local Public Safety Coordinating Council. Required membership is outlined in state statute under ORS 423.560. LPSCC coordinates local criminal justice policy and planning, oversees Douglas County's Justice Reinvestment Grant Program, and makes recommendations to the County Board of Commissioners regarding the use of state and county resources to supervise local offenders. The Council brings together criminal justice leaders, service providers, and other stakeholders to ensure cross-system collaboration and a cooperative approach to public safety policy and programs.\n\nSubcommittees\n\nDouglas County's LPSCC has a Behavioral Health and Housing Subcommittee that also acts as the steering body for Douglas County's Stepping Up Initiative and Sequential Intercept Mapping (SIM) efforts, both aimed at strengthening the local services continuum for justice-involved individuals with mental illness. When needed, there is a Justice Reinvestment (JRI) Subcommittee focused on managing Douglas Countyâ€™s state Justice Reinvestment grant."
