        "text": "André House of Arizona became more than a concept on October 1, 1984, when two Holy Cross priests from Notre Dame University rented a house in a working-class neighborhood in Phoenix. They came to live in the community and serve in the tradition of the Congregation of Holy Cross and the Catholic Worker Movement. Their mission was to respond to the basic needs of the poor while encouraging others to do the same. On November 29, 1984, the first guest was welcomed into their house, beginning a long tenure of hospitality.\n\nOn Christmas night, 1984, André House and a community of volunteers made a thick turkey stew from donated food and served it at a nearby city shelter. The recipients were deeply appreciative and the volunteers enthusiastic. From this humble beginning, the food-line developed: serving one night a week, then two, then three… Volunteers and donations increased and the evening meal is now offered six nights a week, serving on average 600 plates per night.\n\nOther services sprang up in response to the needs of the guests, including: a house in which to welcome homeless women (January 1987), emergency foodbox distribution to the neighbors, free clothing distribution, and education and recreation programs for the neighborhood children.\n\nFrom its modest beginnings in 1984, André House has grown to be a significant provider of basic and transitional services in Phoenix. Despite its size, it has not lost the hospitality which is its essence. Throughout Phoenix, André House is recognized as a place where faith and service meet, where generosity is discovered and praised, and where the Body of Christ both serves and is served.\n\nDearest Friends of Andre House,\n\nIt is with the heaviest of hearts that we share that our beloved Br. Richard Armstrong has gone home to be with our dear Lord. For the past 38 years, Br. Richard has been the heart, soul, conscience, foundation, and center of love for all that Andre House is. We truly will miss him dearly.\n\nIf I had to choose 3 words to describe the remarkable character of Br. Richard, I would choose 1) Humility, 2) Dedication, and 3) Community. Year after year, Br. Richard did the hardest work at Andre House – cooking 6 turkeys every Mon at 5:30am, hoisting 50 pound bags of potatoes and onions from the food bank in and out of our cars, scrubbing down our guest bathrooms with the Core Staff each day before and after dinner, and doing the bookkeeping. And he did all of this with his infectious smile.\n\nEach year, he welcomed in a new Core Staff of 5 – 7 dedicated young adults in their year of service, and shepherded them through the challenges that come with serving our guests at their low points. He was patient, kind and wise, and he led by the amazing example of his tireless work. He inspired so many of our longest serving volunteers, and he treated them all as family. I cannot think of a better example of the charism of Saint Br. Andre Bessette, our name sake.\n\nI had the privilege of learning at his side and under his watch over the past 11 years, and I have never had a better teacher of what it means to give selflessly and to truly be “a man for others.” My favorite thing that Br. Richard said to me on many occasions was, “I love to sit at our back gate in the dining room each night, and watch the smiles on our guests’ faces after they’ve had dinner, and then smile back at them.” Br. Richard could say so much, with so few words.\n\nThank you Br. Richard. We all love you dearly, and we will miss you. May your soul rest in peace with our dear Lord Jesus."
