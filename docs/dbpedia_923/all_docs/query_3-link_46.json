        "text": "December 27, 2016\n\nFew great books can have inspired two other great works of literature that were written for the purpose of ridiculing it. There can also be few works of literature that helped to inspire another author of conservative leanings to contribute towards one of the greatest innovations in English literature. However, this was to be the fate of Pamela, an epistolary novel by Samuel Richardson, which was to provide the springboard for the two works of Henry Fielding contained in this book.\n\nRichardson’s novel comprises a series of letters written by a chaste and virtuous servant called Pamela Andrews who resists the attempts to seduce her, sometimes forcibly, by her employer, Mr B. The book was a huge success in its day and its puritanical morals were greatly admired. It also proved to be an important landmark in the development of the British novel, a medium that barely existed at the time.\n\nHowever, there was a backlash by a number of writers who sought to expose the book’s annoyingly priggish and hypocritical morality, and the most memorable works were by Henry Fielding. The first of Fielding’s large-scale works satirising Pamela was called Shamela and this was a short and brilliantly scathing work that followed the basic narrative drive of Pamela whilst subverting it.\n\nIn this version of events, we learn that Pamela’s real name was Shamela, and that Mr B was known as Lord Booby. The work is preceded by the letters of a shocked member of the clergy who has discovered Shamela’s true character and proceeds to lay out the letters that she really wrote in order to expose her.\n\nLord Booby proves to be an appropriate name, as Fielding’s work depicts him as the victim, and Shamela as the predator. Here Shamela is seen as a corrupt and flighty Miss, conducting a secret affair with a clergyman, and deliberately withholding her ‘Vartue’ (virtue) from Lord Booby as a device to lure the lusty aristocrat into marrying her since this is the only means by which he can persuade her to satisfy his desires.\n\nIndeed it has been suggested that Fielding’s work is merely another way of looking at the same events as Pamela, but with a more cynical eye. It is certainly true that in Pamela the heroine is willing to hold out on her virtue until she receives an offer of marriage, at which point her seducer suddenly becomes a desirable husband. Hence Pamela’s chastity, like that of Shamela, is a commodity that can be bought with the right offer and her pretences to virtue are a mere humbug.\n\nOf course Richardson never intended this reading although there are passages in Pamela, which suggest an uneasy awareness of this possible interpretation. Shamela merely strips away the layers of hypocritical virtue and shows us the economic calculation beneath. It is funny, crudely vulgar and unsubtle, but this makes it the perfect antidote to the solemnly virtuous prosings of Richardson’s work.\n\nHowever Fielding did not stop there. Indeed Pamela even inspired Fielding to take Richardson on in the field on novel-writing, and in the process Fielding was to make a major contribution to the development of English Literature, almost by way of a knee-jerk reaction to Richardson’s novel.\n\nThe satire against Pamela continued into Joseph Andrews, Fielding’s first novel. The hero as his name suggests is a brother to Pamela, and indeed we see him writing to Pamela. Later Pamela and Lord Booby (as Fielding continues to call him) make an appearance in the book and Pamela is notably down on the idea of Joseph marrying beneath him, even though she has also married out of her class. Hence she is once more seen as hypocritical and negative.\n\nHowever, the emphasis of Fielding’s humour here is on Joseph, who begins the book as Pamela in reverse. This time the book follows a virtuous footman scorning the advances of Lady Booby, and a number of other lusty women who seek to take his virtue. By changing the gender around, Fielding has a good deal of fun since the idea of a man protecting his honour against female seducers seems obviously more ludicrous, and serves to further render the ideas in Richardson’s novels as silly.\n\nHowever one of the curious aspects of Joseph Andrews (and later Tom Jones, Fielding’s greatest novel) is that Fielding’s attitudes towards chastity are not as diametrically opposed to Richardson’s as they first appear. Joseph Andrews may appear ludicrous in his emphasis on ‘honour’ and virtue, but it seems likely that Fielding supports Joseph in his pursuit of virtue. He is similarly concerned with Fanny’s attempts to prevent herself from being raped by a number of male characters.\n\nThe female characters in the book who act without chastity are often portrayed in a bad light. Lady Booby and Mrs Slipslop are unpleasant women who are unscrupulous and immoral in other ways, and not only in their willingness to seduce Joseph. The servant Betty provides us with a better model. She is the only person to help the stricken Joseph after he is robbed. However after an unsuccessful attempt to seduce Joseph, she instead sleeps with her employer and loses her place. Her actions only lead to trouble too therefore.\n\nThis tells us more about the emphasis of Fielding’s concern with chastity, male and female. Fielding does believe in the importance of chastity, male and female. He is sympathetic to Joseph’s wish to save himself for his sweetheart, Fanny Goodwill, and he is therefore right not to complicate his life through infidelities with his corrupt employer, Mrs Slipslop or the good-hearted but flighty Betty (who has already had a bout of venereal disease).\n\nAnother model of acting without sexual restraint lies in the story of Mr Wilson, a man who led a wild life and had a number of involvements with women before settling down happily with his wife. The other additional tale interpolated into the book deals with a jilt who leaves a decent partner for a less honourable man, and ends up unmarried as a result. There is a price to pay for immodest or flighty behaviour.\n\nHowever, while Fielding shares the sense that unchastity is a sin to be avoided he clearly sets less stock on it than Richardson. For Fielding it is a mild sin and sometimes even an excess of good nature. Hence Mr Wilson is not damned forever by his early life and Betty remains one of the better characters in the book, who suffers from her lack of restraint, not from a bad nature.\n\nIt has been suggested that Fielding’s opposition to Pamela comes from conservative motives. Richardson’s book has a potentially subversive element in that it sets a servant’s honour against that of her master and ends in a resolution that involves her marrying above her station.\n\nThis may be true, but we may set against this argument the fact that Fielding himself went on to marry one of his servants. Was Fielding a hypocrite, or did he change his mind later? I think not, since Joseph Andrews and Tom Jones both show heroes who struggle against the cruelty of a society that does not allow people to marry beneath them. Fielding opts for the conservative conclusion of ensuring that discoveries are made that put the lovers back on an equal footing but the point has been made.\n\nWhile Joseph Andrews certainly devotes quite a few pages to its attack on the content of Pamela, it may also been as a reaction against the style of Pamela, and in this way Fielding takes the work off in a very different direction that makes Joseph Andrews into something much more than a satire of another writer’s work. While Richardson stuck to an epistolary style, Fielding chose to write a proper connected storyline held together by a semi-omniscient narrator, rather than the potentially unreliable first person narrator of Pamela.\n\nAfter the Pamela send-up in the first Book, the remainder of the novel moves on to other matters. The hero now is Parson Abraham Adams, a benign but naïve clergyman who helps Joseph and Fanny to get back home, amidst a series of picaresque misadventures in the manner of Don Quixote (whom Adams clearly resembles).\n\nThis is a very different form of novel from Pamela and it allows Fielding to turn his satirical aim at a number of other targets. By putting a parson at the centre of his book, Fielding is able to offer up his own opinions about the role of the clergy. Parson Adams is certainly a foolish man in some ways, blinded by his own good nature from seeing the wicked wrongdoings of others, easily gulled, and trying unsuccessfully to get his sermons published, even though nobody would want to buy them.\n\nNonetheless, Adams offers a better view of how the clergy should live and what they should preach in Fielding’s opinion. For example, Adams argues that the clergy should preach the importance of actions over faith, a doctrine contrary to some Protestant traditions. Hence while he meets a number of clergymen along the way who are selfish and refuse to help him, he remains an active and muscular Christian, sometimes literally so, as when he saves Fanny from assault.\n\nThe other important aspect of Adams’ attitude towards religion is his emphasis on the importance of a clergy that is not concerned with wealth. Adams lives in comparative poverty for most of the book, with his appearance causing others to disrespect him. Indeed he is appalled by the excesses of wealth in the church and he stands in opposition to other clerical characters in the book who have been corrupted by money and comfort.\n\nThis emphasis on the corrupting power of wealth is an important concern in Joseph Andrews and Fielding often shows us the bad behaviour of powerful and influential members of society. Lady Booby and Mrs Slipslop seek to act against Joseph and Fanny to get them expelled from the local area. A corrupt lord seeks to humiliate the travellers and to rape Fanny.\n\nSet against this we see examples of virtue in the poor even in those from whom we may not expect to see it. I have mentioned how Betty showed kindness to Joseph when her masters would not. Similarly when Joseph is robbed and loses even his clothes, he is denied access to a Coach by ladies whose morals are more concerned with avoiding a naked man than helping a traveller in distress. It is left to the Postilion (“A Lad who hath been since transported for robbing a Hen-roost” as Fielding informs us in parenthesis) to provide Joseph with a cloak. Later when Adams fails to get help from the wealthy clergyman Trulliber he is helped instead by a Pedlar. The wealthy are frequently corrupt, Fielding says, and the poor are frequently virtuous.\n\nThis can also be seen in Fielding’s depiction of the law in Joseph Andrews. Fielding was an enthusiastic advocate for the law and he even contributed to the establishment of the Bow Street Runners, an organisation that set the model for the later establishment of a police force. The world of Joseph Andrews is one where the law cannot be counted on. The man who robs Joseph is able to escape justice by bribing a constable.\n\nLater when Adams saves Fanny from rape, the two of them only narrowly escape being prosecuted by her attacker, who is taking advantage of a self-important and biased judge. Later still Joseph and Fanny face the ire of the law again for no greater offence than the trumped up charge of picking a twig, when Lady Booby wishes to act against them.\n\nFielding does not advocate any significant change to the law here. He may make pious assertions about the vanity of wealth or the virtue of poverty, but he is not seriously proposing to change the social system. He identifies the injustice of the class system in preventing marriages, but does not offer any serious suggestion that this is wrong. At best he suggests ameliorative changes.\n\nHowever, any conservative of imagination cannot help undermining the very values they defend. The conservative who lacks compassion is likely to leave the reader unsympathetic to the hard values they propose. A compassionate and empathic conservative cannot help leaving us with a sense that this is a dangerous world in need of more reform than the writer perhaps intends us to see.\n\nFielding belongs to the latter group. He may defend the system of which he is part, but the world that he portrays in Joseph Andrews is corrupt to the core with innocent people constantly at risk of being robbed, raped or imprisoned, falling foul of both criminals and the law, whilst the wealthy are free to engage in corrupter sins.\n\nSimilarly whilst Fielding promotes good Christian values, we do not have a sense that this is a world in which those values truly prevail. They do in the book but only by virtue of Fielding’s god-like power as a narrator which piles on enough contrivances to rescue our heroes. We know that if this was reality, the injustices would not be so addressed. Hence it is only the indulgence of Fielding that allows a Holy Fool like Parson Adams to escape the full consequences of his gullibility.\n\nFielding and Richardson sought to establish two different styles of book writing that were to influence future generations of novelists. It is often felt that Richardson won the battle for the future, with a style of writing that laid more on characterisation, seriousness of purpose and a concentrated storyline.\n\nIt is certainly true that Fielding’s style is not always easy for the modern reader to appreciate. There are some aspects of style that make this so. Fielding follows the offputting habit still prevalent in Germany of capitalising every noun, and he does not divide paragraphs in the modern style, so we need to read long paragraphs in which the dialogue of several characters is incorporated, sometimes without quotations marks.\n\nOther aspects that make Fielding sometimes unappealing is his use of broad and vulgar humour and lashings of unsubtle irony, which contrasts with his use of very learned and classical allusions, gained from an education that people no longer receive nowadays. Fielding’s characters also have little depth. We remember nothing of Joseph Andrews except his priggish focus on honour. After that he becomes so bland and generic a hero that we hardly notice him. The other characters are similarly defined by only one or two characteristics.\n\nHowever, there are aspects of Fielding’s tradition of writing that have survived the test of time better. There have been plenty of picaresque and journey novels since, and many works are written via an omnipotent, omniscient narrator controlling events, though not always with the benevolence of Fielding. His abandonment of the epistolary style in favour of a clearer narrative, interspersed with other narrative devices, is also closer to the modern novel than that of Richardson’s, not to mention his abandonment of the other writer’s Puritanical standards of moral virtue.\n\nWhile both writers have their merits, I do not personally have much relish for Richardson’s proselytising and I prefer the vulgar warmth and humanity of Fielding."
