        "text": "Welcome one and all to the 2nd episode of the Wrestling Society X review series. Last week was an interesting start as Jack Evans beat Matt Sydal and Vampiro and 6-Pac grabbed the contracts to become #1 Contenders for the WSX Title match tonight. There’s a lot on the plate tonight so let’s get crackin’!\n\nOur special musical guest this week was Three 6 Mafia, and I note this because all night both DJ Paul and Juicy J are on commentary and J says some of the most unintentionally funny or just plain bizarre things I have heard on commentary since Art Donovan. I love them so much, I’ll make sure to highlight some as we progress through the program.\n\nWe get a recap of last week’s giant ass Battle Royal as we head into our opening contest.\n\nMatch #1- Human Tornado vs. Luke Hawx\n\nTornado comes out and just looks stylish as all hell, so much so I made it the heading photo of the review. J remarks that “He looks like the old Michael Jackson”. Tornado and Hawx get into a test of strength but Hawx gets owned by Tornado’s styling and profiling. Tornado is bounced into the ropes and Hawx attempts a kick to the nuts, but Tornado no sells it, having “Balls of Steel”. I love it.\n\nHawx gets some heat with an awesome array of moves until Tornado does something I can only describe as a Leapfrog leg scissor takedown over the top rope followed by an AMAZING tope senton over the top rope and barricade onto Hawx! Have I mentioned how much I love Human Tornado? Juicy J agrees as he slurs his way into say “That Little Skinny Dude can move man!”\n\nBoth get back in the ring as we get constant reverse Irish Whips into a corner which leads into springboard Tornado DDT which gets the 3 count. Good fun match for what it was. That Tope was insane and will easily be the highlight of the show.\n\nRating: 2 Fly for a White Guy out of 5\n\nBut we narry get a breather as Aaron Agulera comes in and attacks Hawx only to have Alcatrazz come in for the save, followed by Kaos as he brings in tables and ladders. Kaos sets up Alcatrazz on the table but Agulera is too busy being distracted by attractive ladies ringside to notice Hawx rebounding and putting Kaos through a table. Agulera’s face when he realizes what happens is priceless.\n\nWe cut to a promo from “M-Dogg20” Matt Cross and Teddy Hart, who will debut as a tag team next week as “The Filth and the Fury”. Guess who is which and win a free cookie.\n\nMatch #2- That 70’s Team (Disco Machine and Joey Ryan) vs. Team Dragon Gate (Horiguchi and Yoshino)\n\nThat 70’s Team comes out and does their dancing schtick as Juicy J comments that they make “Starsky and Hutch look like *BLEEP*”. Feel free to replace that with any word.\n\nWe get fast paced and fundamental action to start things off as J again comments that “They lost girlfriends for being that quick”. I don’t know why, but now I feel the need to do a review of the Urban Wrestling Federation’s first PPV. We get a funny spot where Joey runs out of breath and Disco tosses him an inhaler as TDG looks on in befuddled confusion. We get more comedy spots as DM gyrates above one of TDG and a sunset flip on Joey that depants him. The mindless fast fun continues until Joey lands a superkick on Yoshino to pick up the W. TDG, not ones to be humiliated by people who listen to the “Saturday Night Fever” album on repeat, retort by breaking their disco ball as the crowd gleefully chants that “Disco Sucks”.\n\nQuick match with comedy spots. Nothing else to it.\n\n1.5 Disco Ducks out of 5\n\nWe get another tag team promo showcasing the “Trailer Park Boys” for next week.\n\nMatch #3- Vampiro vs. 6-Pac for the WSX World Heavyweight Championship\n\nI noticed the belt seems similar to the WWF Smoking Skull title as Vampiro makes his way to the ring as Juicy J remarks that he “is a man I wouldn’t want to meet in a dark alley”. My sentiments exactly, Mr. J. A casket is at ringside for a spot later (not a spoiler if it’s obvious) as Pac spray’s Vampiro in the face with water as the action gets underway. Pac goes for two Bronco Busters but Vampiro reverses the 2nd one. Vampiro goes up top for a corkscrew senton but misses as Pac gets more heat on him.\n\nDropkick by Pac sends Vampiro to the outside as Pac follows up with a tope senton onto the floor and goes for the pin? Apparently there is a falls count anywhere rule in WSX. Go figure. Vampiro gets on a comeback and sends Pac into the turnbuckle in an awesome spot that is then cut to a hot girl in the crowd. I love this show.\n\nVampiro sets up a table on the outside but Pac counters and puts Vampiro through his table with a tornado DDT that only gets a 2 count. Pac also hits the 6-Factor (X-Factor but not copyrighted) and Vampiro also kicks out at 2. Vampiro mounts a comback and tombstones Pac through the casket as fireworks go off to secure the 3 count and win the title.\n\nAs a match, I had no problems with this what so ever and as a way to build Vampiro as this dominant force, it worked well. Overall, pretty good match and ending to the 2nd episode.\n\n3 Exploding Caskets out of 5\n\nWSX chugs along with another fun show capped off with a solid main event. Nothing more, nothing less.\n\nFinal Grade: 2.5 out of 5\n\nAh. Wrestling Society X. If there was a company that I would say needed to be resurrected more than ECW and classic NWA, it’d be WSX. Throughout it’s 9 episode MTV run, WSX had some of the most batshit crazy high flying stunts and insane hardcore deathmatches this side of the Pacific ocean. With a stacked roster of big Indy names, to former XPW (ugh) wrestlers, and even former WWE guys, the show was a mix of that crazy Cage of Death show your one buddy went to last year, WWE style editing and storytelling, bad Scy-fy movie acting, and that one Dragon Gate DVD you bought a while back because another buddy told you it would blow your mind.\n\nAnd I’m going to review not just every episode that was produced, including the unaired 10th episode, but also the webisodes that were produced along side and were included in the Box Set, which I highly recommend anyone to buy because the bonus features make it worth it. So without any more dilly dalying, let’s take a look at WSX Episode 1.\n\nINTRO\n\nThe WSX intro is a pretty cool video. It’s a 1st-person shot of a guy running around an underground like setting inter cut with shots of WSX wrestlers doing what they do. I love it. With the generic rock song playing along, it gets you set into the atmosphere and tone of the show, an Underground kind of setting with grit and grime everywhere.\n\nMATCH #1: MATT SYDAL (Evan Bourne to you WWE People) W/H LIZZY VALENTINE VS. JACK EVANS\n\nOur first real shot of the ring is when WSX Announcer Fabian Kaelin welcomes all to WSX and is so into the whole Intro, he makes Don West selling stuff seem tame and relax. That said, I love the ring design. It looks run down, worn, and has seen better days, again, really setting us into the atmosphere and feel for the promotion.\n\nOur opening contest is heel Matt Sydal, with his college sweetheart Lizzy Valentine, taking on the perpetual “King of the #FlippityFlips” and full time Eminem Wanna-be, Jack Evans.\n\nWe start the action with Evans doing a spinaroonie which causes the crowd to chant “You got served” at Sydal. Sydal, not being one who takes kindly to being served by Mr. Vanilla Ice, launches into some flips and tricks. It goes back and forth until Sydal hits Evans with a spinning back kick and after an unsuccessful pin attempt, latches on the Siamese Twin submission, which more people need to do because it looks awesome. Evans gets the rope break and kicks Sydal so hard he sells it by landing on his neck. Ziggler, take notes.\n\nWe get more flips and tricks until another flip to the outside where the commentators (will talk more about them at the end of this review series) remind us that there are no mats in WSX, just concrete. Why do I feel Bill Watts had something to do with that? Both try to get back in the ring, but Lizzy, not just being eye candy, hangs onto Evans, and doesn’t get DQ’d because I guess there are no DQ’s in WSX. This sets up an awesome spot where Evans gets out, uses Lizzy as a step stool and hits Sydal with a tornado DDT. Awesome. Evans then hits the 630 Splash for the win. Afterwords, he puts the moves on Lizzy who, despite being used as a step ladder not a few seconds ago, seems smitten at first before going to attend to her boyfriend.\n\nThis was great for what it was. Not too long and really set up what WSX is about: Being different and awesome. There was no psychology, but that isn’t what it was supposed to have.\n\nRating: 2.5 Flippy Flips out of 5.\n\nAfter that, we get a look at the tag teams of WSX and some promos leading up to the WSX Rumble with words from cats like New Jack, Justin Credible, Catty- I mean Teddy Hart, etc.\n\nMATCH #2: 10 MAN WSX RUMBLE MATCH\n\nThe Rules: starts out as a Royal Rumble match and when all the participants have arrived, the match then becomes a Ladder match. There is an exploding cage and electric barbed wire. I see someone is trying to win the prestigious “Trying too hard to be edgy” award.\n\nEntrant #1 and #2: Justin Credible and Teddy Hart\n\nTeddy throws a water bottle right at Credible to which look like it hurt to which I laughed my ass off. They proceed to do some moves, Teddy doing the flips that got him banned from ROH, which leads into…..\n\nEntrant #3: Kaos\n\nKaos starts to clean house until Teddy starts no selling his offense (naturally) and then Justin and Teddy start to double team Kaos.\n\nEntrant #4: Vampiro\n\nVampiro is the king of cleaning house, I swear, because the cleanhouse spot with him in this was awesome. Throwing clotheslines like they were nuthin’ and giving out chokeslams from hell. Damn. That is how you make an entrance.\n\nCOMMERICAL BREAK!\n\nWe come back from commercial to see that Entrant #5 Puma is already out from a chokeslam by Vampiro and now Entrant #6 Alkatrazz is now in.\n\nEntrant #7 6-Pac (X-Pac)\n\n6-Pac hits the facebuster. That’s really all that happens until\n\nEntrant #8: Chris Hamrick and Entrant #9 New Jack\n\nWe only see these two backstage for like 4 seconds as New Jack gets angry (Shocking, right?) at Hamrick for being a racist, according to the commentators. Can I just say I freaking love New Jack? He never ceases to entertain me being angry almost 24/7 and beating people up. Anywho, Hamrick and Jack fight a bit until Jack dumps Hamrick to the outside and also goes out to eliminate himself. The refs try to stop New Jack from inflicting more damage but Jack just doesn’t have any of it and hits him with a guitar. Jeff Jarrett would be proud.\n\nThings break down as Alkatrazz’s partner, Luke Hawx eliminates Kaos and by doing so both get dumped into the Electric Barbed wire which explodes which transitions into New Jack jumping off a balcony and breaking Hamrick through a table. Chaos, chaos everywhere.\n\nAlkatrazz is dumped out by vampire as we get……\n\nEntrant #10 Youth Suicide\n\nTeddy is eliminated and the ladders are now in play. Youth puts down thumbtacks because EXXXXXTREEEEEEEMMMMEEEE(!!!!!!!!) and I note that the ladders are 15-20 feet tall. Not that big in WWE, HUGE in smaller companies. Anywho, Vampiro freaking powerbombs Suicide into the thumbtacks (#Irony) as 6-Pac gets the first contract. Justin Credible is now climbing up with Suicide and Vampiro as Credible knocks Suicide into the cage, Vampiro hangs on and gets the contract and almost immediately after that it cuts to credits with one of the most jarring edits I have seen.\n\nOverall, a really rushed and chaotic match, but I feel like they were trying to go for that and does set up Vampiro and 6-Pac at the next show. I guess it was good in that regard, but as a normal match, meh.\n\n2 Overbooked Matches out of 5\n\nWhile the wrestling was meh for the most part, the show was entertaining for the most part and for a 22 minute show, they packed in quite a bit. So far a good opening for the show as we all hop all aboard on the WSX train. CHOO CHOO MUDAFOKKAS!\n\nFinal Grade: 2 out of 5\n\nI freaking love Kaiju (Japanese Giant Monster) movies, and by proxy, I love Godzilla. There is something cathartic, awesome, and nostalgic about watching Godzilla tear up Tokyo, Kyoto, Osaka, etc., while at the same time beating the snot out of a bunch of badass monsters either by himself or with a few friends. If I had to pick favorites, personally I’d choose the original 1954 Gojira (and to a lesser extent the 1956 American re-cut), 1962’s King Kong vs Godzilla, and 2004’s Godzilla: Final Wars. As for worst? 1971’s Godzilla vs. Hedorah, 1973’s Godzilla vs. Megalon, and by far the worst of them all and a possible contender for worst Kaiju movie of all time, 1969’s All Monsters Attack, A.K.A Godzilla’s Revenge. I don’t count Tri-Star’s 1998 Zilla because it is a Godzilla movie in name only. But yeah, being the big fan of the King of the Monsters I am, I was actually pretty hyped when I saw the trailers to the 2014 American reboot Godzilla. And after watching it, I can safely say that if this is the beginning of a new series (and reports are saying sequels are on the way), then this is a series I can get behind because I came out of Godzilla 2014 one happy camper.\n\nGiving a plot synopsis is a little useless because if you have seen any Kaiju movie, honestly, you have a pretty good idea how the movie goes; establishing human characters, disturbances, guy finds the answer, is too late or no one believes him, enemy monster awakens, stuff is destroyed, Godzilla appears, kills it, goes back into the water, roll credits. Despite simplicity and predictability, this formula has been done well many times in the past, and really, any simplistic and predictable story can still make for a tense and epic story. Such is the case here. While parts drag at times and you do spend more time with the human characters, you really don’t notice while watching nor care because the writing is good enough to make you see past those shortcomings.\n\nEasily the strength of the movie is it’s casting, with a fantastic and tragic performances by Bryan Cranston and Ken Watanabe and surprisingly good performances like Aaron Taylor-Johnson and Elizabeth Olsen. This cast and direction really breath life and emotion into characters that, in lesser hands, would be cliched at best or insulting at the worst. Props to director Gareth Edwards that. However, it should be stated that all of the child actors in this movie are terrible, even by child actors standards. Either they are too wooden or too boring, but their scenes don’t last too long, so it’s not that worth griping about.\n\nAnd, of course, it wouldn’t be an awesome Kaiju movie without Kaiju action, and I’ll say that I was satisfied by the action scenes. The cinematography was great in following the action, no shaky cam, and gave us a good idea of scale. The fights themselves were awesome and made me return to that little kid inside all of us where we just gleefully squeal as Godzilla goes mano-y-mano (or in this movie mano-y-manos) with a crazy creature. I’m not ashamed to say that I yelled “YEAH!” when Godzilla used his trademark blue radiation fire.\n\nIs Godzilla perfect? No. While I thought the movie was paced well, for some, it may drag on and feel like a chore to get through to see the monsters. There is also a few fake-out scenes, that to me were hilarious, to others where really annoying and was nothing more than cop-outs. Also, this is not a movie where science is the most accurate. It may just be nit-picking, but when the MUTO (the monster whom Godzilla faces) is flying through San Francisco, how is it that the building’s windows do not shatter under the gust? Or is that just me?\n\nI enjoyed Godzilla, plain and simple, and give it 3 and a half stars out of 4 possible stars. It’s great action with great pacing with great characters with a GREAT monster battle. I would readily recommend it to any monster movie fan, or anyone who loves “popcorn” movies. Don’t be put off by the fact that Godzilla looks like he put on the Madea fat suit, because when he steps onto the screen and roars his trademark roar, all you will care about will be how bad his opponent is screwed.\n\nI was going to do my review on the 2014 Godzilla that I went to see last Friday, but one thing came up that I really feel the urge to address instantly. Don’t worry, I will get that review out soon enough. With that said…..\n\nI have not watched WWE since January this year. That doesn’t mean I don’t know what is going on, as I am apart of a few wrestling related groups on Facebook, liked several wrestling meme pages, and do a show every Tuesday where me and my friends catch up on Yesterday’s RAW (I just monitor the chat) at http://www.livestream.com/oawrestling. Naturally, I’d be aware of the going-ons in storyline.\n\nThe reason I stopped watching was as simple as this: Shit booking. Since Summer Slam of 2013, WWE slowly went under a change in booking that subconsciously depressed me, that being the heels won more than the babyfaces. Not equal amounts, no less, more. Even when they lost, they would come back with a cheap shot, a beatdown, or something similar to that nature. The only time faces truly won are PPV’s. There are exceptions, but more often than not, the heel kept the upperhand in the feud. Now this isn’t bad per say, as what drama would there be if there isn’t a face underdog or a thought that someone may lose. This is booking 101. The problem comes from where and with whom do you tell the story. If it was a squeaky clean face trying his hand at revenge against a guy who is bigger and badder than him, that’s fine and perfectly acceptable for a feud. If your face champion is feuding with a heel challenger who poses a legitimate threat to his belt, that is also great. If your face is the top guy with the top belt and you have him running away like a sissy school girl from a rampaging monster who every week beats him down, that is freaking stupid.\n\nI don’t even need to watch WWE TV to understand or realize how wrong this sounds. If you are not in the know, for 8 months, current WWE champion Daniel Bryan was constantly beaten down week after week by the Authority faction in his pursuit of the WWE Championship, setting him up to be the ULTIMATE underdog until ultimately winning the title at Wrestlemania XXX. This really was the storyline that made me quit WWE, and trust me, I can rip that story a new one, but that is neither here nor there. What I’m discussing right now is how Bryan is being booked as WWE Champion since, mind you, winning the title in a triple-threat match that was set-up like a handicap-match with constant opposing interference and shenanigans after winning another match against arguably one of the biggest names in the history of WWE. This is the man who was the ultimate underdog, the guy who proved he didn’t need to be the strongest, biggest, or most good-looking to be the best; just getting by on skill, determination, and guts. The man who has the crowd firmly in his hands, started a chant that transcends his sport into others, and had Mick Foley destroy a television in support of his movement. Now, he sits on top of the professional wrestling world, with the most prestigious award in wrestling history that is to be won in the biggest wrestling company on the planet. That belt is to signify to others that he can beat and best any man in the world in a wrestling match and that he has the courage, honor, and dignity to defend that belt with respect for the tradition that comes with the title and at the risk of his own life.\n\nAaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaannnnddddddddd there he goes, running away, scared shitless, with his tail tucked between his legs from a guy who has not been taken seriously in 2 years.\n\nYour world champion, folks!\n\nCall me old fashion, but when it comes to face champions, you shouldn’t see them do anything demeaning like, gee, I dunno, run away like a cowardly heel. And before ANYONE writes in the comments that “Oh, he was trying to defend his wife. That makes him chivalrous and doesn’t make him look bad at all.” First off, read WrestleCrap’s induction of Kane vs. Zack Ryder here. Read that then come back to me saying it doesn’t make anyone look like a tool. Second, if Bryan wanted to protect his wife, why not stay and fight? Guy went through 8 months of shit to get that belt, only to wet his pants at a guy who wrestles in slacks? And is a libertarian? And yeah, he’s wearing the mask again, but come on, it’s literally the same guy who jobbed to the Shield in under 5 minutes at Wrestlemania. This story is based off the idea that the fans have a 5-second memory and would instantly think of Kane as a threat again, but he’s not.\n\nAnother argument I hear in favor to this story is that Bryan works better as an underdog and that having him work as an underdog to matches is better than having him be a total winner. Yes, you heard right, people think that having a UNDERDOG WORLD CHAMPION is a good thing, at least in Daniel Bryan’s case. You know, I asked a kid in my class today who is into MMA (Since I am not at all) and asked him if Jon Jones would ever be considered an underdog when in a fight. His response? “No, he’s the champ. If he’s an underdog and still the champ, he doesn’t deserve to be a champion.” No, you read that again. Engrave it into your psyche and memory so that when you are 86 with memory loss, you will still be able to remember that line. Good? Okay, the point I’m making is that YOU DON’T MAKE YOUR WORLD CHAMPION A DAMN UNDERDOG! He’s the freaking WORLD CHAMPION! He should be able to take on all comers, small or big. Say what you will about Cena, at least I can believe him as a world champion because he jobs to no one. He dominates his opponents and you actually feel like he is good enough to be called the best in the world. I’m not asking for much with this am I? I’m not saying Bryan should be a Cena, but I’m asking that he not be a Honkey Tonk Man either.\n\nPeople say I take wrestling too seriously. I do. I think it’s one of the best forms of entertainment out there, combining theatrics with athletic skill. You can have stories that make you laugh, cry, scream in anger, personalities you can latch onto and grow with. There is no other comparison I can make. I love wrestling with every fiber of my being. So when stupid crap like this happens to a company I used to watch every single week and continues to degrade what the definition of a world champion is, naturally I’d get defensive and aggressive.\n\nIf you had the patience to sit through my ramblings, I thank you wholeheartedly. You will be rewarded with my Godzilla review, hopefully coming out this week. Until then, have a nice day and be good humans.\n\nTo be brutally honest, I thought this show was going to be a little bit of a mess after I heard that Ty Colton, TDT, and even Kevin Steen had to drop out because of personal reasons and in response to this, AIW Management said on social media that they were going to shake up the card and replace the open bookings with either returning stars or new blood. Don’t get me wrong, AIW is awesome and I truly do enjoy their product, but there was a nagging thought in the back of my head that this show could have felt like a jumbled catastrophe. But low and behold, AIW went #Clutch and presented a show that was better than ANYONE expected. Hell, it may have even been better than what the original card could have been. Like I said in my preview, I was joined on this excursion by my brother Jarett who never attended a wrestling show. His overall reactions were positive but said that we are not coming early again because of the 2 hour line wait. With that said, let’s go through the card starting with:\n\nMatch #1: Tim Donst defeated Alex Shelly\n\nReactions: This match was pushed to the opener to get the crowd hot, and get them hot it did. Shelly and Donst both looked great and their back-and-forth action was tight and fast-paced. This match pretty much set up the rest of the night.\n\nHighlights: Donst and Shelly going from shaking hands to spitting in each other’s faces during the course of the match. Great Storytelling.\n\nMatch #2: Tyson Dux defeated Shane Hollister\n\nReactions: The one low point of the match, for me. It wasn’t bad per say, but I expected a bit more of a faster and more hard hitting match between the two. I think I was spoiled by the 4-way at GftG9, with Hollister’s beast mode and Dux’s sheer intensity, that, while still present in this match, weren’t turned to 11 like last time.\n\nHighlights: The dueling “USA” and “Canada” chants from the crowd.\n\nMatch #3: Seleziya Sparx defeated Veda Scott in a “Pick Your Poison” match decided by Greg Iron\n\nReactions: Quick, brutal, and fun. Just how I like my undercard matches. Sparx’s use of lighttubes on Scott’s back as shrapnel flew into the crowd was the scariest thing I have ever experienced as my time as a wrestling fan. Iron came out at the end to screw over Scott and afterwords through himself on her. The feud between these two isn’t over by a long shot and I am glad for it. It’s one of the best Indy feuds going right now.\n\nHighlights: Bulb shrapnel. Bulb shrapnel everywhere.\n\nMatch #4 Matt Cross defeated Bobby Beverly, Davey Vega, Lucas Towns, Brent Baker, and Cheech\n\nReactions: My thoughts before the bell: “Who the hell are Towns, Baker, and Cheech and what the hell are they doing on my AIW show?” My thoughts after the bell: “Oh. So that’s who they are. I’d like to get more acquainted with these gentlemen.” Towns, Baker, and Cheech looked great in their debut match in AIW and put on a spot-fest with Cross, Beverly, and Vega that was lightning quick-paced, fun, and ultimately an enjoyable experience. AIW is known for giving younger, not-so-well-known guys a chance at making an impression, and for the most part, like here, it pays off big-time. Dux came out and attacked Beverly with a chair, which led Cross to pick up the win. The prospect of that match makes my wallet want to jump out and force itself into Chandler Biggins and John Thorne’s pockets.\n\nHighlights: Cheech holding up two people at once for his relatively small frame.\n\nMatch #5 Gregory Iron defeated Josh Prohibition in a “Pick your Poison” match decided by Veda Scott\n\nReactions: Iron gets his ass beat for the better part of the match but, though through some interference by the Iron Curtain and a surprise heel turn on Josh by long-time friend and partner Matt Cross, Iron is able to pick up the W. After the match, Cross cuts a really damn good heel promo on Josh, calling him a “part-timer” and saying he had no respect for the business. If the shit didn’t hit the fan yet, it sure did now.\n\nHighlights: The turn and Iron who performed and sold Josh’s offence like a true champ.\n\nMatch #6 Athena defeated Nikki Storm to retain the AIW Woman’s Championship\n\nReactions: Athena has basically made AIW her bitch in the past 2 months. Not only beating long-time queen of AIW Allysin Kay for the Woman’s Title at GNO 12 last month, she now is on the war path, beating Nikki Storm, who in my opinion, played a great heel in this match. With a new gimmick, a clear direction, and the crowd behind her, Athena is going to make 2014 her year, not only in AIW, but I think in other promotions as well.\n\nHighlights: “The O Face” and Storm’s bickering with the crowd.\n\nMatch #7 The Jollyville Fuck-Its (T-Money and Russ Myers) defeated Faith in Ryan (Eric Ryan and Rickey Shane Page) and Flip Kendrick/The Duke to retain the AIW Tag Team Championship\n\nReactions: There is a difference between watching a hardcore match on TV and live. You see it on TV, video, whatever, and you just shake your head sadly while cringing. Live, however, you become terrified for your life. Light bulbs, guitars, bottle caps, ramen, barb wire, crutches, fish hooks, skewers, and freaking BEA ARTHUR will never be seen the same by me again after this match. It’s your standard hardcore match, to be sure, but seeing as this was my first one live, I spent most of my time in fear for my life. Still, average match that led to the formation of “The Forgotten” a stable consisting of BJ Whitmer, Jimmy Jacobs, and the returning Tommy “Crimson” Mercer, who say that they will not be forgotten and will make their mark on AIW. Excuse me while I mark the hell out.\n\nHighlights: The varied weapons, the “Bea’s Hardcore” chants, that ending promo, T-Money MURDERING Flip with an over-the-top-rope PPPOOOUUUNNCEEE!!!\n\nMatch #8 Michael Elgin defeated Colin Delaney to retain the AIW Absolute Championship\n\nReactions: This match was funny, intense, competitive, and just a joy to watch. Great back and forth between the two the entire match, telling a great story of respect and determination. Elgin wins, is challenged by Donst, management breaks it up, and Elgin puts his title on the line during the entirety of the JT Lightning Tournament in May. Again, excuse me while I mark the hell out.\n\nHighlights: The beer toast, Delaney’s devotion to staying in the match, Elgin coming out dressed as New Jack.\n\nMatch #9 #ALLEGO Ethan Page and Louis Lyndon defeated Johnny Gargano and ACH\n\nReactions: I was worried by the news that Steen had to drop out and postpone the debut of the Panda Express. His replacement, ACH, came out as a HUGE surprise and proceeded to join the 3 other workers in a fun little match that really didn’t warrant being the main event, but was still enjoyable. My biggest “Oh Shit” moment came at the end when ACH was presumably injured, which turned out to be thankfully nothing serious. Nice funny match, but did not need to be the main event.\n\nHighlights: ACH’s surprise return, Gargano and ACH channeling their inner Dudley Boyz.\n\nFinal Thoughts: Shit didn’t hit the fan here. Shit hit the airplane turbine. This show sets up SOOO many possible storylines and match ups with such grace and skill. An obvious “must buy” for when it comes out on DVD. If you haven’t started watching AIW, pick up the DVDs or .MP4 files from SmarkMarkVideo.com right away. $15 a pop is a great price for these shows.\n\nMatches of the Night: Delaney vs. Elgin, Donst vs. Shelly\n\nWrestler(s) of the Night: The Forgotten\n\nOriginally Written during May of 2013\n\nCinema, the final frontier. These are the voyages of the Starship Reece’s Riffs. It’s continuing mission, to explore strange foreign films. To seek out new classics and avoid clunkers. To boldly go where no critic has gone before.\n\nI doubt I will feel as much passion for a movie like I did with Star Trek Into Darkness this year, but for all the wrong reasons. I must admit to being a “Trekkie”, growing up with reruns of the original 1960’s television show on TV Land and the movies. And when I heard that there was going to be a prequel/reboot of the franchise back in 2009, I was less than excited. But, J.J. Abrams’ Star Trek was a thrilling, action-packed, entertaining joy ride from start to finish, that even non-Trekkies can enjoy. So you imagine that I was hyped as heck for it’s sequel. And low and behold after I left the theater after the Saturday matinee at the AMC, and, while I did have a problem or two, I was satisfied………… for about 3 minutes. After the initial rush wore off I began to see more and more of it’s flaws, and found myself hating it more and more with each passing day. But before we get to that, we must set the story.\n\nFrom IMDB: When the crew of the U.S.S Enterprise is called back home, they find an unstoppable force of terror from within their own organization has detonated the fleet and everything it stands for, leaving our world in a state of crisis. With a personal score to settle, Captain Kirk (Chris Pine) leads a manhunt to a war-zone world to capture a one man weapon of mass destruction. As our heroes are propelled into an epic chess game of life and death, love will be challenged, friendships will be torn apart, and sacrifices must be made for the only family Kirk has left: his crew.\n\nFirst, the good stuff. The acting is amazing. Chris Pine, Zachary Quinto, Zoe Saldana, Karl Urban, Simon Pegg, John Cho, Bruce Greenwood, Anton Yelchin, Alice Eve, and Benedict Cumberbatch are all outstanding in their roles and are one of the reasons I don’t completely hate this film. Everyone are putting 110% into their roles and making sure that you don’t see actors, but the crew and villains of the U.S.S Enterprise. I’m especially pleased with Cumberbatch’s performance of who is perhaps the greatest Star Trek villain of all time, Khan Noonien Singh. Keep in mind, he had to play the role made famous by the late great Ricardo freakin’ Montalbán, and found someway to make the character his own, turning Khan from a cold yet calculating strategist, into a calm yet bloodthirsty warrior and still convinced me he was Khan.\n\nHowever, that’s the biggest problem with the movie, the fact Khan is in it and the story. Don’t get me wrong, the story isn’t bad per say. The first half is actually really good and interesting. But after that halfway point, the ball is dropped so hard, it’s at the center of the Earth. The story stops trying to be original, and becomes a remake of Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan. The problem with this? Star Trek II is considered a Science-Fiction classic, arguably the best of the Star Trek films, and contains some of the most iconic scenes and lines in cinema history. Actually, calling it a “remake” is being too nice, rip-off is more fitting as it lifts entire SCENES AND LINES FROM IT! It got to the point where Spock yelling out Khan’s name became uncomfortable,embarrassing, and hard to watch. Some may call this a nitpick but it’s this that truly keeps me from enjoying this movie. Star Trek as a franchise is to represent exploration, to seek new possibilities, to boldly go where no man has gone before. Not going back to already discovered land.\n\nBut does it live up to Wrath of Khan? Bluntly put, Into Darkness fails as a remake/ode to Wrath of Khan because of the story and the motivations of the characters. The reason Khan was such an effective villain was because he was an old villain from the TV show, who was stranded by Kirk on a deserted planet for trying to take control of the Enterprise. And when he shows up in Wrath, his main motivation is to gain revenge on Kirk and the crew and will do close to anything to obtain it. Into Darkness’s Khan has some of the motivation of Khan, wanting revenge on Starfleet and wants to protect his comrades who were put into cryo-freezing with him, but we don’t have a grasp on his motives and actions as tightly as we were on the original Khan. And that is what makes Star Trek II: Wrath of Khan such a good movie, it mainly focuses on what it should, the feud between Khan and Kirk. In Into Darkness, there seems to be a confusion on what the focus should be on. Is it about the coming Klingon/Federation war? Is it about corruption in Starfleet upper command? Is it about capturing Khan? Is it about Khan wanting revenge on Starfleet for abusing his skills? It’s a mess.\n\nI’m torn on how to grade this movie. I won’t say it’s a bad film, but on the other hand, it’s not a great one either. The acting is tremendous, the visuals are pretty darn good (if a bit too lense-flarey), and the overall cinematography and direction are well-executed. But on the other, we have a re-hashed story that fails to live up to the glory of it’s predecessor and can’t hold a candle on it’s own, at least past the halfway point. The “Trekkie” in me gives it ** stars while the film critic in me gives it ***. I’ll meet myself in the middle and give it ** ½ stars. If you’re a fan of the 2009 film or not, you will most likely enjoy it. If you are a fan of the franchise, you may feel the same way I do. Either way, I suggest you rent this on DVD if you must see this.\n\nAuthor’s Note: Looking back on this review, it may be my least favorite one I did, not because I think it’s badly written, but because I was WAY too easy on this movie. Since this review was written, I’ve grown more and more hatred for this movie. Really, I’d even avoid watching it on DVD. If you want my updated rating of the movie, 2 stars out of 5 at the most. At the least? 1 1/2 stars.\n\nSadly missing “Girls Night Out”, I continue my trend of going to every other AIW show I can go to, on Friday April 25th 2014, I will return to Turner’s Hall in Cleveland Ohio for AIW’s yearly rap show “Nuthin’ But a ‘G’ Thang”. The idea of the rap shows is that all matches are contested under “Compton Rules”, really just “No Disqualifications”; and this time, I’m not going alone. I managed to talk my brother Jarett, who hasn’t watched or attended a wrestling show since 2012 (A January RAW in Cleveland), into coming with me. He is very skeptical about this, but agreed anyway. And damn, what an awesome card to attend it is. So let’s run down this card (As of April 21st, 2014) and see just how flippin’ awesome this show is gonna be.\n\nMatch #1: Bobby Beverly vs. Davey Vega\n\nVega and Beverly are two of AIW’s better young stars. Beverly has an ability to be able to work a fine match with anyone, and Vega just has an infectious enthusiasm about him that makes him impossible to hate. The story going into this one is that both guys have the capabilities to be top guys and AIW, but as soon as they get close to the brass ring, they can’t quite grasp it. This match is probably going to be a showcase of both men’s talent and skill, with the victor continuing on to make a mark in AIW.\n\nMatch #2 AIW Tag Team Championship Match: The Jollyville Fuck-Its (c) vs. Dicks and Flips vs. Faith in Ryan vs. La Tabarnak De Team\n\nAnother 4-way tag match. Not too interested, but I’ll still be interested in it because of T-Money’s POOOOOOOUNCE! which will one day kill a man. Mark my words.\n\nMatch #3: Shane Hollister vs. Tyson Dux\n\nFor those who read my review of “Gauntlet for the Gold 9”, you know how much I loved the 4-Way match that featured these two, and now they are going to go at it again in singles action. These two guys are intense, hard hitting, and beyond athletic. Expect fast-paced action and hard kicks. Oh god, expect the hard kicks.\n\nMatches #4 & #5: Veda Scott vs. An Opponent of Greg Iron’s Choosing & Greg Iron vs. An Opponent of Veda Scott’s Choosing\n\nI’m lumping these two together as they are really both apart of the same storyline. I’ve really enjoyed the rivalry between these two over the past few months, but I am guessing that this will go on until we see a definitive end at Absolution. It’ll be fun to see who comes out for both of them.\n\nMatch #6 AIW Women’s Championship Match: Athena (c) vs. Nikki Storm\n\nAthena won the title from Allysin Kay last month during “Girl’s Night Out”. Although I have never seen this two women wrestle before, I’ve heard some damn good stuff from both of them and I can’t wait to see what these two can bring to the ring.\n\nMatch #7 Tag Team Grudge Match: The Panda Express (Kevin Steen & Johnny Gargano) vs. Louis Lyndon & #ALLEGO w/ his Manager\n\nA match that has been brewing since Hell on Earth last year, Kevin Steen and Johnny Gargano finally get a chance on taking out two guys who have made their life in AIW pretty much suck, the Intense Division Champion Louis Lyndon and Ethan Page with Selezya Sparx. The vintages building up this match have been hysterical on the Panda Express’s part, so I am not sure if I am going to expect a serious or a lighthearted match. Either way, it’ll probably kick ass.\n\nMatch #8 AIW Absolute Championship Match: Michael Elgin (c) vs. Colin Delany\n\nDelaney finally gets another shot at the title after Page stole his golden moment from him at Absolution last year. This time, he is taking on who I proclaim to be the most dominant wrestler in AIW right now, the Absolute Champion himself, Michael Elgin. I don’t expect Delaney to win this, but it’ll be cool if he does. Elgin’s matches are always fun and Delaney just oozes infectious energy.\n\nMatch #9: Tim Donst vs. Alex Shelly\n\nThis is the true main event, folks. If you know me, you know Tim Donst is one of my favorite wrestlers of all time, top 10 easily. And if you don’t know me, let me tell you that the Motor City Machine Guns are one of my favorite tag teams of all time. So, putting two of some of my favorite performers in the ring, this match is the reason I bought tickets. Tim Donst has just been incredible for the past 8 months, beating Hutter, Hero, Havoc, Kingston, winning the Gauntlet for the Gold, and now is taking on Alex Shelly. Am I hyped? You bet your ass I am!\n\nBuy your tickets here: aiwrestling.com/gthang.php or go to shop.aiwrestling.com\n\nAm I the only person who is getting a little sick of Zombies? I mean, granted, it’s not as annoying as the Vampire craze a few years back, but it’s getting to the point where it reaches that level. It seems that the best way to get people to buy your game or watch your movie or read your book is to make the main focus Zombies, becoming more than a marketing ploy than a real topic. Now that’s not to say everything that has zombies that has come out in the last 10 years or so has completely sucked. Shaun of the Dead is still beloved as a hilarious horror comedy, The Walking Dead has garnered a HUGE following leaving us with a glorious game from Telltale, and Zombieland is one of my favorite movies of all time. But what makes these works, well, work is because they are doing something different with the idea of a zombie apocalypse. The Walking Dead is more of a soap opera with it’s focus on characters and MULTIPLE character deaths, Shaun of the Dead is a smart comedic look at the sub-genre, and Zombieland is just a fun, buddy comedy that takes advantage of the fact that it is a zombie movie. So where does that leave our topic of today, the 2010 anime Highschool of the Dead? Is it another cheap cash-in of the Zombie genre, or is it actually a decently made, well-executed entry? Well, to answer your question, it’s neither. It’s a HOLY CRAP THIS IS FREAKING AMAZING OH MY GOD zombie entry that’s a cheap cash-in on that cashes in on the ecchi genre of anime. I think I better explain.\n\nFrom Wikipedia:\n\nHighschool of the Dead is set in present day 2010 Japan, beginning as the world is struck by a deadly pandemic that turns humans intozombies, euphemistically referred to by the main characters as “Them”. The story follows a group of high school students, the school’s nurse, and a young girl as they fight their way to safety through the deadly streets of Japan during the worldwide catastrophic event known as the “Outbreak”. As the cast tries to survive the zombie apocalypse, they must also face the additional threats of societal collapse, in the form of dangerous fellow survivors, and the possible decay of their own moral codes.\n\nLet me start off by saying I friggin’ love this anime. From the characters to the animation to the story to the writing. But before we go further into why I love it, let me address the elephant in the room. This anime is notorious/infamous for it’s insane excessive amounts of female fanservice, which is an Otaku (Anime Fan) term for anything the show does to appease it’s fanbase. It could range from giving a popular character more screen time, to the more famous example, COUNTLESS SEXY FEMALE SCENARIOS. In Layman’s terms, breast zoom-ins, panty shots, and bottom shots. I mean, even during some serious moments, a panty shot can come in from nowhere, that’s how bad it is. Now, while this may come off as extremely sexist, I have no problem with it in this anime. Why? It’s kinda hard to say. It may be the fault of the dub, which plays the whole story as a dark comedy or the fact that it’s so blatant that it comes off as unintentionally hilarious. I know a lot of people can’t stand excessive fanservice of this caliber, so if you are one of these people, I can completely understand why people do not like this series. But personally, it doesn’t really effect me that much. And hey, if I’m looking at an ass, it might as well be an ass from a character I like, and luckily for this show, most of the characters are extremely likable. Which is a great segway into the main reason I love this show, the characters.\n\nIf I had to choose one thing that I liked about the characters in Highschool of the Dead, is that none of them are idiots. A big problem for me with teen-centered shows or movies, or hell, even zombie movies and shows, is that the characters are idiots. They don’t react like how normal people would. Thankfully Highschool of the Dead has a cast that is relatively smart and likable: Takashi Komuro, the leader of the rag-tag group of survivors; Rei Miyamoto, Takashi’s old flame and best friend; Saeko Busujima, the calm and collected katana wielding valkyrie; Saya Takagi, the arrogant yet brilliant hothead; Shizuka Marikawa, the ditzy but well-meaning busty school nurse; Arisu Maresato, the cheery little girl whom they rescue; and my personal favorite of them all, Kohta Hirano, the nerdy fat kid who starts off seemingly useless, but over time, reveals himself to be a gun fanatic who is a sharpshooter with just about any weapon.\n\nBut why are they smart? Well, for starters, they realize what you are not supposed to do around zombies in a matter of seconds; and that isn’t because they are science majors or anything, but because they understand BASIC COMMON SENSE. I also like the fact that they do address some biological problems with the zombie drama, specifically, the fact that the zombies don’t decompose even in the hot summer sun. It’s writing like that that makes this a bit more than your typical cheesecake, testosterone thrillride.\n\nAnother big praise I have for the series is the animation and cinematography, and I’m not talking about the jiggle physics or the countless cleavage shots. The animation for the series, while not on Studio Gainax levels of amazing, are still pretty damn good in their own right. And since this is an animated zombie show, you can go to places and show a lot more than any live-action show. Again, I’m not talking about the tits and asses. If I had to choose the most awesome moment of animated zombie action badassery, it would be Samurai School Girl Humvee Tilt Zombie Kill.\n\nIs HighSchool of the Dead a “good” anime? Maybe not. But is it entertaining? Oh hell yeah,no doubt! If you have 6 and a half hours to spare, I’d highly recommend watching all 13 episodes. Even if you don’t like it, I think you can still take away one or two things you like about it.\n\nWhat can you say about Tyler Perry? It can’t be denied that Perry is one of the most successful and polarizing personalities in entertainment today with people either loving him, remaining indifferent to him,or straight up loathing him. Personally, I fit more into the neutral category in regards to him. On one hand, I think he isn’t that half-bad of an actor, as he is very charismatic and can be very charming. But on the other hand, his screenplays are among the most cliched train-wrecks I have ever had the displeasure of sitting through. As evidence, let’s take a look at Perry’s debut film (both acting and as a screenwriter), which also happens to be the first entry in the Madea franchise. That’s right folks, I am going to review Tyler Perry’s 2005 romance comedy-drama, Diary of a Mad Black Woman.\n\nA Synopsis:\n\nHelen McCarter (Kimberly Elise) is a happily married woman who is married to her husband of 18 years, Charles (Steve Harris), who is a very rich attorney. On the night of their anniversary, however, Charles is found with another woman and then tells that he is divorcing Helen and kicks her out of their house, with only a Uhaul truck, driven by obvious love interest Orlando (Shemar Moore). Helen is now taken in by her crazy grandmother, Madea (Tyler Perry), and now has to survive as an independent woman who need no man but is also trying to find that second opportunity at love.\n\nOkay, let’s get the positives out of the way before I tear into this. One thing that genuinely shocked me was that, even though the writing is utter garbage, the acting is surprisingly good, especially from Elise, Harris, and Moore who play their roles with 100% gusto, trying as hard as they can to salvage their lines. I’ll also admit that there were a few times in the movie where I kind of half-smiled at the comedy, but those times were rare. And that’s all I have to say about the positives.\n\nAs for the negatives, oh boy there are a lot of them. While there were times I smirked at the comedy, for the most part, the annoying, psychotic screeches of Madea running around and flailing her arms drove me insane and made me actually yell at the movie to shut up. A minor complaint I have with this movie is that there are a ton of characters with a ton of subplots, which becomes tiring after a while and half-way through the movie, it becomes aggravating.\n\nBut my biggest problem with the movie is how predictable it is. In film, predictability isn’t that bad for the movie as a whole, but you need to balance that out with twists and turns which has people guessing what happens next. If during the entire movie, you can predict everything that is going to happen as soon as something is set-up, what’s the point of even watching? You know that Helen and Orlando are going to get together at the end, you know that Charles is going to be hit by kharma, and you know everything is going to turn out fine for the main characters in the end, which isn’t helped by the fact that the writing and characters are so transparent and so…… boring. This is a really boring movie. This is one of the most boring movies I have ever seen in my life. Had I not wanted to do a review on a Tyler Perry movie, I would have fell asleep.\n\nThis may be my shortest review I have ever published, and I wish I had more to say about this movie, but the simple thing is that this movie just blows. Laughably transparent and two-dimensional characters, bland and predictable writing, and some of the most annoying comedy of all time. The only credit I can give this movie is it’s acting, which, again is good, but isn’t enough to save the movie. I give Diary of a Mad Black Woman a solid 1 out of 5 possible stars. If you felt the same way as I did about this flick, I’d highly recommend the Boondocks episode “Pause”, which is a great, hilarious parody and satire of not only Tyler Perry, but also the following his productions receive."
