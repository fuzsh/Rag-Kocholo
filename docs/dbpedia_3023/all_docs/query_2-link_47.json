        "text": "Members of the Pawnee Nation united with Nebraska farmers to preserve the tribeâ€™s ancestral corn. Sacred to their heritage, the corn can be traced back to when the Pawnee were expelled from their homeland in 1877. They carried their prized seeds from Nebraska to Indian Territory (Oklahoma), but the corn wouldn't grow in Oklahoma. Set aside for years, the corn was on the verge of extinction until an unexpected friendship created an opportunity for the Pawnee to grow their corn once again in Nebraska."
