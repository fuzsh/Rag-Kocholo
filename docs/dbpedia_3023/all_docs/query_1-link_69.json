Sakura confirms Kunakida's suspicions--the US can't help until they are specifically asked for assistance by the Japanese government, due to the terms of the joint-treaty. The TAC hopes that the apartment is inconspicious enough that they will be able to continue their Arigami research without disturbance. Unfortunately, that isn't the case. Murakumo shows up. Yaegashi is wounded trying to protect Kome, and Momiji is carried off by Murakumo. Murakumo takes Momiji back to the place where Kaede and Susano-oh are residing.

The prime minister reveals that that Momiji's pictures were released to the press by an Arigami spy in the government, whom they have been unable to identify. Meanwhile, Japan is in an uproar.
