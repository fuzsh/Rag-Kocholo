        "text": "I've patched and played FF2-3 on the NES. of cource both of those never made it to the US. I found a place with patches you applied over the rom. that was several years ago. Now that i'm getting into Saturn so heavily I'm finding RPG's that I can't seem to find English versions of, Like Blue Seed. Anyone know of such a place that has patches for Saturn cd games?\n\nI remember awhile back there was a group that is trying to translate langrisser 3 (warsong) in english...I don't know how far they went...but they did offer the iso on the net to test it out...\n\nI will look to see if i still have that link...\n\nI wouldn't be surprised if there are more of this type of translating for japanese sat games...\n\nKyosuke75\n\nCase in point (you can figure that one out).\n\nPart of the reason is, well, it's in Japanese, and a solid Japanese to English translator is needed. Another part is: that's a whole lot of text to translate. Dedicating that much time to translation is a pain. And finally, with the Saturn being quite the dead system, it's hard to find a groundswell of support which equals volunteering for this kind of venture.\n\nCase in point pt. 2: how many members does this board have? And of those members, how many people regularly post (as opposed to asking a stupid question then moving on)? And of that smaller number, how many people post something worthwhile (or, in other terms, how many people are 'contributing' to the community)?\n\nAnd so on. Many a night ago I did the math (why? because I had nothing better to do). Essentially, they were very disheartening numbers (and they were very, very conservative estimates).\n\nAs a final note, after the above prerequsites are answered, you have to keep in mind this system (the Saturn) is being pillaged as a warez console, much like roms (I think it's plainly/painfully obvious, anyways). Much like coders for emulators, it gets frustrating; why would you dedicate that much time for something that is a) free and people don't appreciate fully anyways?\n\nI wasn't flaming you, just saying that the people who put so much time into making translations do it for free and you shouldn't complain about their output (or percieved lack of). Be grateful for what you can get. All you need to do is whack 'Saturn translation' and whatever game into a few search engines and you'll see whats going on, if something is in progress or whatever. Possibly you should change your attitude, this forum is very helpful in general.\n\nwhatever, I encode (thats produce for all you Leeches) for Soldats Anime we translate and put a lot of time into our videos so don't give me your bleeding heart \"I know but I don't do\" crap. I hate getting lectured by a bunch of do nothing leechers. If you don't know fine, don't post. Just because there are few people doesn't mean the morons should answer all posts so please, if you can't help, go back to your Pron are whatever else it is you do."
