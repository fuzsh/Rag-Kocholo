        "text": "WWE RAW (formerly WWF Monday Night Raw, WWF RAW Is WAR, and WWF War Zone) is a wrestling program that has aired on Monday nights since January 11, 1993.\n\n1993\n\n[edit]\n\nJune 14\n\n[edit]\n\nMean Gene Okerlund: We are here at the just-concluded King of the Ring. I am here with the brand new World Wrestling Federation Champion, Yokozuna, and his manager Mr. Fuji. In an interview conducted earlier, you stated you would hold a celebration here in America. Why?\n\nMr. Fuji: Why? Simple. Because my Yokozuna won WWF Heavyweight Belt right here in beautiful America, so we celebrate, Yokozuna and myself, in America.\n\nMean Gene: Now when would this celebration take place?\n\nMr. Fuji: Perhaps...July 4.\n\nMean Gene: Well, wait a minute. July 4th...well, it's a big holiday. As a matter of fact, the 4th of July is America's birthday. Why would you celebrate on the 4th of July?\n\nMr. Fuji: Why? Because America celebrates Independence Day, Yokozuna and Mr. Fuji celebrates with America.\n\nMean Gene: Where would this celebration take place?\n\nMr. Fuji: Ah... perhaps beautiful landmark in America. Historical! Historical landmark in America!\n\nMean Gene: Wait a minute, Mr. Fuji. You've got to be kidding me. That's disgusting!\n\nMr. Fuji: What?\n\nMean Gene: I think you're actually trying to desecrate an American holiday, aren't you?!\n\nMr. Fuji: No, no, no, no...\n\nMean Gene: You and Yokozuna up to your... is this what we're going to expect from you?! Come on!\n\nYokozuna: Yosh nay [sic]. Hulkamania is dead!\n\nAugust 2\n\n[edit]\n\nVince McMahon: What a victory for the 1-2-3 Kid, Razor Ramon at ringside adding insult to injury to the SummerSlam match-up. I'll tell you what, this is gonna be something extraordinary. Ted DiBiase, very, very upset.\n\nBobby \"The Brain\" Heenan: Well, you've made an enemy now out of Ted DiBiase, the Million Dollar Man, and Money Inc. What you do, McMahon, is your business. When you get into the ring...\n\n[Vince and Bobby notice someone has entered the ring]\n\nVince: Speaking of business, what's this man doing here?\n\nBobby: Wait a minute!\n\nVince: He has no business here.\n\nBobby: Do you know? Do you know who that is?! Do you have any idea who... Do you have any idea who that is?! Jimmy! Jimmy!\n\nVince: Jim Cornette. Don't get carried away. I've never seen Bobby Heenan so delighted. What is this?! [Bobby and Jim Cornette share a delighted hug in the ring] Oh, look at this! It's a reunion! Bobby Heenan and Jim Cornette from Smoky Mountain Wrestling!\n\nBobby: Ladies and gentlemen, I don't believe this! I do not believe this! Do you know who this is?! Do you have any, any idea who this man is?! [To Jim] No, I'm gonna talk right now. You listen! Relax. I'm gonna talk for you. This, ladies and gentlemen, this is the greatest manager in the history of the sport of wrestling! Yes! I couldn't... I couldn't even surpass what this man has done. Jim Cornette, what are you doing here in the WWF?\n\nJim Cornette: First of all, Bobby, I wanna say something. I'm only the greatest manager in wrestling only because that you're no longer managing. I gotta say... and by the way, my mother really liked that bouquet of roses you sent. But you know something? Everybody's wondering, \"Jim Cornette...\" I know all the people out there, they got their false teeth laying on the floor, man, and they gotta have their wives slap 'em, bring 'em back around, sit 'em up on the couch. \"Jim Cornette's on the WWF, man!\"\n\nBobby: Tell me, Jim, what is going on with Smoky Mountain Wrestling?\n\nJim: Let me just explain for all you genetic defects out here living downstream from the nuclear plant. Jim Cornette has done everything in his career. I've done everything in professional wrestling. I've traveled coast to coast, border to border. I've managed the greatest tag teams in wrestling. The one thing I haven't done is appeared in the World Wrestling Federation. I'm here to do that now because I finally have my knockout blow.\n\nA year and a half ago, I settled in the great Smoky Mountains down there in Knoxville, Tennessee, and I became involved with the hottest wrestling promotion in the South, Smoky Mountain Wrestling. And I formed, I handpicked a tag team guaranteed to be the pièce de résistance, the cream of the crop, the greatest combination that I have ever managed. None other than the Heavenly Bodies: The Doctor of Desire Tom Prichard and the Gigolo Jimmy Del Ray. And they are, without a doubt, the object of every American woman's desire.\n\nBobby: Talk about surprises! You never cease to surprise me, Jim!\n\nJim: That's exactly right, and I'm full of surprises, because I've got another one. I'm here in the WWF for one reason. Because, like I said, I manage the greatest tag team in wrestling, the Heavenly Bodies. They have dominated Smoky Mountain Wrestling for a year and a half. And now, I hear you've got some big fish up here. A couple guys called Rick and Scott Steiner that every... [off the audience cheer] Yeah.\n\nVince: Oh, boy, Cornette wasting no time.\n\nBobby: They're the WWF Tag Team Champions.\n\nJim: That's exactly right. They're the World Wrestling Federation Tag Team Champions, but they're not the best tag team in the world. The Heavenly Bodies are. So what I'm saying, Rick and Scott Steiner, now I'm ready for the knockout blow, the only step I've never taken! You got a challenge on your table, Steiner Brothers. Either you can get in the ring with the Heavenly Bodies, defend those belts, get beat, of course, but at least these people will know that you had some guts. And hey, it's no disgrace getting beat by the best. Or you can just overlook my challenge, and then every single one of these people will know that you're yellow, stinkin', dog-cur cowards, and I know you are.\n\nBobby: Ladies and gentlemen, this man is gonna set the World Wrestling Federation on fire! And Jimmy, you're the man that can do it! You're here! You're really here!\n\n1994\n\n[edit]\n\nNovember 7\n\n[edit]\n\nVince McMahon: At this time, obviously conspicuous by his absence, is the “Macho Man” Randy Savage. And I’d like to announce, unfortunately, that Randy Savage has been unable to sign a contract with the World Wrestling Federation—not unable to, rather to come to terms with the World Wrestling Federation for a new contract. But Randy, I know you’re out there listening, and on behalf of all us here in the World Wrestling Federation, all of your fans, and certainly me, the number one fan, I’d like to say thank you for all of your positive contributions to the World Wrestling Federation. Thank you, Randy Savage, for all the wonderful memories for so many years here in the World Wrestling Federation. We wish you nothing but the best. God speed, and good luck.\n\n1995\n\n[edit]\n\nNovember 20\n\n[edit]\n\n[Diesel comes out to the ring and interrupts a match between Savio Vega and Skip.]\n\nDiesel: A lot of people are wondering where Big Daddy Cool's head's at right now. I thought about it and I thought maybe I'd come out here and apologize for what I did to Bret. For what I did to all my dear fans. I don't think so! You know, last night when I went back to my hotel room, I wondered if I could get any sleep. For the first time in a year, I slept like a baby! When I woke up this morning and I looked in the mirror, you know what I saw? I saw a smile on my face! It's the first time I saw myself smile in a year. As I saw myself, not some corporate puppet that you decided to create Vince! No. You missed the ball on this one, baby! You missed the ball. After I won the title, 24 hours later I'm up in Titan Tower with marketing suits, the merchandising suits. \"Hey Diesel, we need you to smile a little bit. We need you to be a little more polictiaclly correct. A little more corporate.\" Well baby, what you saw last night was a tip of the iceberg! Big Daddy Cool's back! That same guy you saw in Providence at the Royal Rumble a couple of years ago. [Puts on his shades] The only thing that matters to me right now is my family, my friends, that includes you, Shawn Michaels! And I'm not saying I'm not going to smack hands, but it better have a black glove on it so I know that you're with me. Whether you like me, love me, or hate me, that's the way it's going to be. I'M BACK!\n\n1996\n\n[edit]\n\nFebruary 19\n\n[edit]\n\n[after Goldust walks out on Razor Ramon during their Intercontinental Championship match, getting himself counted out but keeping his title]\n\nRazor Ramon [taking a microphone]: Hey yo! Cut the music! [his music stops] Everybody, listen...to me. Goldust...I don't want your belt. I want...your ass!\n\n[the crowd cheers]\n\nVince McMahon: Well, we said it was RAW!\n\nJerry \"The King\" Lawler: What?!\n\nRazor: You know...I've been hearing so much about...the return, of the \"great one\"; the legend from the glory days is back. He's our new president, Roddy \"Rowdy\" Piper.\n\nJerry: He's been knocked senseless, McMahon.\n\nRazor: Well Piper, I heard you say one time...that you got six kids. And that makes you \"Hot Rod\". \"Well, Razor...Razor, he loves the little kids.\" I love the kids, and Piper, you like me, you from the streets - different neighborhoods, same streets. I don't want my kids watching this kind of stuff on TV!\n\n[the crowd cheers again]\n\nJerry: What's he saying, McMahon??\n\nRazor: So Piper, the only thing missing, chico...is make a match! I want Goldust, anywhere, anytime! And Goldust! And Goldust, everybody knows...that you want me! You think I'm sexy? You think I'm hot? You right! So Piper, ooh, Roddy \"Rowdy\" Piper...okay, big shot, I challenge you, you the, uh...matchmaker...make me a match. Goldust, let's have a date. YEAH!!\n\nVince: Razor Ramon, ladies and gentlemen, obviously wants a rematch, with Goldust, and I'm not too sure that he's overly concerned with the title!\n\nMay 27\n\n[edit]\n\nVince McMahon: Alright, standing by, a very unhappy Ted DiBiase. Mr. DiBiase, you're not very happy at all with the latest turn of events, are you?\n\nTed DiBiase: [with Stone Cold Steve Austin] No, I'm not happy at all, McMahon. To say that Savio Vega's victory last night was a fluke, is an understatement. I mean, the lights were out. Who knows how many times Savio Vega touched the turnbuckles. What I'm saying is, there's no way on his best day Savio Vega defeats Stone Cold Steve Austin...\n\nVince: Well, you were counting on Savio being your chauffeur; that did not happen, and Savio Vega was victorious. Now, the rematch has been signed for tomorrow night, and again, it's going to be a Caribbean Strap match, and I would suggest that you still want Savio to...well, that provision, you still want to challenge him, do you?\n\nTed: I want to sweeten the pie, McMahon.\n\nVince: Sweeten the pie?\n\nTed: Savio Vega, you keep that stipulation in there, 'cause you're gonna be my chauffeur. And I'll tell you what. I'm so confident that this man is gonna beat you tomorrow night that I'll put a stipulation in there. If Steve Austin, if Stone Cold Steve Austin doesn't beat you tomorrow night, Savio Vega, the \"Million Dollar Man\" Ted DiBiase will forfeit his career! I will leave the World Wrestling Federation! Did you hear me, McMahon?! Did you hear me, Vega?! I will leave the World Wrestling Federation!\n\nSeptember 23\n\n[edit]\n\nJim Ross: In just a couple of minutes, I'm going to bring Big Daddy Cool, Diesel and Razor Ramon right out here. But before I do, I'd like to beg your indulgence for just a minute and tell you something I got on my mind. There's something I've been wanting to say for a long long time. And when I'm through telling you, many of you are going to question my loyalty to the World Wrestling Federation so let's clear that up right now. I have no loyalty to the World Wrestling Federation, I only got loyalty to good ol' J.R., and let me tell you why. In 1993, I left a great job in Atlanta, Georgia, and I left the Atlanta Falcons of the National Football League to go to the recognized leader of sports entertainment, the WWF. I came here to be the primary play-by-play man in the WWF. I don't think anybody here is going to disagree that I am the best play-by-play man in the whole damn business! So I show up for work the first day at WrestleMania IX in Las Vegas, Nevada, and they give me a sheet to wear. They said, \"Oh it's going to be a toga. You'll look good in a toga, J.R.\" I leave the National Football League for a toga. It's crap! And then, ladies and gentlemen, I go to the first King of the Ring in Dayton, Ohio, and I guarantee you, you listen to that broadcast, I carried the broadcast from ringside. And then did you ever wonder where ol' J.R. went to? Why doesn't ol' J.R. do play-by-play anymore? Let me tell you why. Because the egotistical owner of the World Wrestling Federation—and you know who I'm talking about, I'm talking about Vince McMahon—couldn't stand the competition. So J.R. disappeared. And then on Super Bowl Sunday of 1994, I woke up with an affliction called Bell's Palsy, and my entire left side of my face looked like it had a stroke. You think I like that? You think I like that my left eye doesn't open all the way because I got sick? Well, let me tell you how warm-hearted Mr. McMahon is. Mr. McMahon called me into his office on February 11th, 1994, and he fired my ass! So I get back in my car and I drive into my home in that overpriced hellhole Connecticut, and I'm trying to figure out how I'm going to tell my wife and my two little girls that their daddy had just got fired. And so then, remember when McMahon got indicted? They needed somebody to come back and do Raw? They called up J.R. and then they let me go again. So finally they called me back, hired me back for fifty cents on the dollar to come back and work for the front office. Do you think that all these guys leaving the WWF was an accident? Hell no, it's not! You think all these guys coming here was an accident? Absolutely not, I've been very busy. And right now, I want to bring back one of your favorites. He's the Bad Guy, Razor Ramon!\n\nNovember 11\n\n[edit]\n\n[Brian Pillman is being interviewed by Vince McMahon and Kevin Kelly at the Pillman house while Stone Cold Steve Austin is out looking for him]\n\nVince McMahon: Notwithstanding the bravado, do you feel like a hostage? Do you feel like a hostage in your own home?\n\nBrian Pillman: Hah. Steve is a dead man walking, because when Austin 3:16 meets Pillman [draws and slides pistol on camera to everybody's shock] nine-millimeter Glock...\n\nKevin Kelly: Oh my God, oh my God!\n\nPillman: ...I'm gonna blast his sorry ass straight to hell!!\n\n1997\n\n[edit]\n\nJanuary 20\n\n[edit]\n\n[Bret Hart comes into the ring at the start of the show]\n\nBret Hart: There's something I gotta say!\n\nLawler: What's he doing out here?\n\nBret Hart: There's something I gotta say to you! [Points at Vince] You know, when I decided to come back to the World Wrestling Federation, you promised me that I would get an opportunity to fight for the World Wrestling Federation Championship belt. You put me in the ring with Stone Cold Steve Austin and said that if I could beat Stone Cold Steve Austin, that I would be the number one contender for the World Wrestling Federation Championship belt. Now don't you think it's just a little bit convenient that for some stupid reason, Shawn Michaels finds himself out at ringside announcing in my World Championship match with Sycho Sid? I don't think it was any kind of a coincidence either. So Shawn Michaels jumps up and sticks his nose in my business and costs me the World Wrestling Federation Championship Belt with blatant interference. The Boy Toy costs me the championship and they go, \"Oh that's okay. Don't worry about it, cause now you can go in the Royal Rumble and you only have to fight 29 other guys and then you'll get your opportunity for the World Wrestling Federation Championship belt.\" So I went in the ring, and it's very, very clear to me that I won the Royal Rumble and I should be getting a World Wrestling Federation Championship bout. Where is my opportunity? You know, the way I look at things right now, I've been screwed by Shawn Michaels the Boy Toy, I've been screwed by Stone Cold Steve Austin, I've been screwed by the World Wrestling Federation, and I've been screwed by you! (Vince) I don't like to make idle threats, but the way I see things, it doesn't look like I'm going to get my opportunity for a shot at the World Wrestling Federation Championship belt. So I quit! (slams the microphone down.)\n\nSteve Austin: You gonna get me a piece of equipment that works, son, or do I have to whip your ass? Bret Hart, you can sit there and bellyache and complain with the best of them, son. Ever since you came back, you ain't done nothing but cry! You sit there and talk about how Vince screwed you, how everybody screwed you, how I screwed you. The bottom line is, son, when the going gets tough, the Harts get going back home! Knock it off! Go on back to Canada, son, because the only person you can possibly beat is your wrinkled up old man in his little old basement. You talk about being jerked around, I've been jerked around for seven years, and then I get here. I'm supposed to face Sycho Sid tonight and some guy, a 350-pound buffoon that calls himself Gorilla Monsoon the commissioner says, \"No, no. Sycho Sid is at home with a concussion.\" Sycho Sid may be at home with a concussion and an ice pack on his head, but he's also got a yellow stripe running right down the middle of his back. As far as Gorilla Monsoon goes, I got a big bunch of bananas and I can tell you where to stick each and every one of them. You want me to face The Undertaker, you can bring his dead ass out here, because I threw him over the top rope last night, and I'll do the exact same thing right now, so bring him out, I got something for him!\n\nFebruary 13 (Thursday RAW)\n\n[edit]\n\n[Vince McMahon brings out Shawn Michaels, who talks about his recent woes]\n\nVince McMahon: I know you're just as disappointed, more so than anyone else, that you're not defending the WWF title against Sycho Sid, or for that matter whomever would have been stacked up against you. And no one has taken on more challengers, no one in the history, who has ever won this championship belt, has ever had the schedule, has ever had to endure the kind of schedule that you have so readily taken upon yourself.\n\nShawn Michaels: Well there's uh, one thing about me is I can't do anything halfway and I, and I come here and I hear the people and they chant uh, Sid's name or they chant Bret's name or they chant a lot of peoples' names, and one thing's for sure, you're going to have all of that in the future, um, and that's what I want for the World Wrestling Federation fans. In spite of, uh, what people may think about me, what I've always wanted for all these people is, is for them to have a good time and to enjoy themselves.\n\nI've always tried to be the one to provide it whether it was on the good side or the bad side. But what was always important to me was the performance, was the performance so that these people, each time they reached in their pocket, they paid to get a WWF ticket, they didn't regret it because they knew that if they saw my name on the card they could yell, they could come and they could cheer and they could boo and they could do whatever they wanted as long as they had a good time.\n\nOver the last couple of months, uh, there's been a lot of talk of people, uh, having bad attitudes and a lot revolving around this belt. Uh, all I know today is that one thing that's not going to revolve around this belt, for a long time, is going to be Shawn Michaels. I don't know where I'm at right now. I have to, uh, I have to have everything checked. I may have... I may be beyond reconstructive surgery. I may, or may not be able to fix it. But if I can't come back and perform at the level I performed at, before... I can't, I can't perform. I can't come out here and just go half-ass. I have to come out here and I have to romp and stomp and I have to get tossed around. I have to toss people around and I have to have fun.\n\nThe schedule over the last year I took on because I didn't feel like I could say no. I wanted to do everything. I wanted to enjoy my life as the WWF Champion. I wanted to, I wanted to ride in Learjets and ride in limousines and I wanted to be on TV shows and I wanted to do autograph sessions and I got to do every bit of that. If nothing else, I have all of that to take with me. Again, and I know right now we're in the middle of a time where toughness is real big here in the World Wrestling Federation, and unfortunately all I've got right now for you is a lot of sorrow, a lot of tears, and a lot of emotion. I don't have any toughness for anybody, so I guess, here you go, here's your belt. [gives Vince the WWF Championship]\n\nWhat I'm going to do is go back home and see what's left for me; whether it'll be in this ring... whether it'll be out of this ring. I know that over the, uh, the last several months I've lost a lot of things and one of them has been my smile. And, and I know it doesn't mean a whole lot to everybody else, but it means a lot to me. So I have to go back and fix myself, and take care of myself, and I have to go back and I have to find my smile because somewhere along the line I lost it and I don't care, really, I don't care if it's unpopular, and I don't care if, uh, people want to make fun of me because I'm an emotional guy. But, um, this is all I've ever wanted to do and uh, over the last year I got to do it and whether you like me or not, I just want to tell you that, uh, last year was the most wonderful year of my life. And, uh, if I never do get to do it again, it'll be okay because I got to live one full year as being the number one guy in this business and it was the single greatest year of my life. And I have you to thank, and I have everybody here to thank, and it means a lot to me and, uh, I'm gonna go home now. Okay?\n\nMcMahon: Ladies and gentlemen, SHAWN MICHAELS!\n\nMarch 3\n\n[edit]\n\n[Vince is showing footage of the Final Four where Stone Cold Steve Austin inadvertently helped Bret Hart win the WWF Title, and later where he hit Bret with a steel chair, causing Sycho Sid to win the title the next night.]\n\nVince: Your response? Do you show any remorse, whatsoever, for your actions?\n\nSteve Austin: The only remorse I got is that I didn't hit him harder with that steel chair! Bret Hart runs around talkin' about everybody's screwin' him. Hell, for the past seven years, I've been screwed, and it's the same old song! How come when Shawn Michaels hurts his knee, you make a video out of him? How come when Shawn Michaels gets sick, you tell the world that he's got the FLU?! Well, when I went to the Final Four, I was sick as a dog, and I had a blown out knee! Let me ask you a question: How many one-legged people can go 25 minutes with 3 of the top wrestlers in the world? NONE! Stone Cold Steve Austin went out there, and did just that! And I ain't making fun of no one-legged people, I'm sittin' here just tryin' to make a point. As far as I'm concerned, I truly am the World Wrestling Federation Champion, and can't nobody tell me different! Not you, or ANYBODY! As far as the Submission Match, it's a buncha bull! Bret Hart, he's supposed to be the big technician, the Sharpshooter. BIG DEAL! I don't know a whole lotta couple of submission moves, but it doesn't matter, because I'll beat the hell outta Bret Hart! And as far as Ken Shamrock says on TV the other day; \"Oh, I don't know. Bret Hart's the better technician, but Stone Cold ain't got no quit in him.\" Well, you hit the nail right on the head, son, because I ain't got no quit in me at all! And you can bet your bottom dollar that Stone Cold ain't gonna look at the referee and say \"I quit! I submit! I've had too much!\" There ain't NOBODY... there ain't NOBODY in wrestling who can make me QUIT! And that's the bottom line, 'cuz Stone Cold SAYS SO!\n\nVince: Why of all this... why are you so bitter? Why this bitterness?!\n\nSteve Austin: You treat me like a dog, and you expect me to SMILE? You remind me of a jackass!\n\nMarch 17\n\n[edit]\n\n[Bret Hart has just lost a WWF title cage match with Sycho Sid]\n\nJim Ross: We're back here ladies and gentlemen, a few more moments and Vince McMahon is going talk to a very, obviously a very consumate Bret Hart.\n\nVince: Bret Hart, you've got to be terribly frustrated. Extremely frustrated over what has just happened.\n\n[Bret shoves Vince down and takes the mike]\n\nLawler: WHOA!!\n\nBret Hart: FRUSTRATED ISN'T THE GODDAMN WORD FOR IT!! THIS IS BULLSHIT!!!\n\nJim Ross: We apologize, ladies and gentlemen.\n\nBret Hart: You screwed me, everybody's screwed me and nobody does a goddamn thing about it! Nobody in the building cares, nobody in the dressing room cares, so much goddamn injustice around here, I've had it up to here!!\n\nJim Ross: We apologize ladies and gentlemen.\n\nBret Hart: Everybody knows it! I know it! Everybody knows it! I should be the World Wrestling Federation Champion!\n\nLawler: Get him out of the ring!\n\nBret Hart: Everybody just keeps turning a blind eye! You keep turning a blind eye to it! I got that Gorilla Monsoon, he turns a blind eye to it! Everybody in that goddamn dressing room knows that I am the best there is, the best there was and the best there ever will be!\n\nLawler: Cut him off!\n\nBret Hart: And if you don't like it, tough shit!!\n\nSteve Austin: Conspiracy my ass Bret! All you want to do anytime you go in the ring is cry like a baby! I tried to go out there and help you and you threw it all away because you're a loser! It could have been you and me for the championship at WrestleMania, but you blew the whole damn thing because you're a loser! At WrestleMania, you will quit and one of these days when it's you and me for the title, you're looking at the next champ. AND THERE AIN'T NOTHIN' YOU CAN DO ABOUT IT!\n\nBret Hart: [As Austin begins saying \"At WrestleMania,...] You know why they call you Stone Cold? Because your stones are so cold, you won't come out here and step in the ring with me myself! You always got to jump me from behind! You haven't got the guts to come out here! Come on!! Everybody knows whether it's Sycho Sid, [Sid comes out] If you think for one second that that belt belongs to you, you are wrong! It is my belt. You know it, I know it and everybody in this building knows it!\n\nSid: I don't know shit, crybaby!\n\n[as Bret Hart brawls with Steve Austin and Undertaker brawls with Sid]\n\nVince: Bret Hart has snapped! Bret Hart thought for sure he would be the WWF champion and there's no conspiracy! Bret Hart, ladies and gentlemen is talking about a conspiracy. There is no conspiracy at all, only in his head and it's sad that a man as great as Bret Hart has resorted to this! This is not what we've talked about! This is not the legacy of Bret Hart! Not this! Not this bawling! Not this whining! Not this crying!\n\n[officials pull Bret away from Austin]\n\nLawler: You're right! He's snapped McMahon! He's lost it! Get him out of here, drag him out!\n\n[Bret nails Pat Patterson and goes back to Austin]\n\nVince: OH HE JUST HIT, HE JUST HIT HALL OF FAMER PAT PATTERSON!! THAT DIRTY ROTTEN SON OF A...!!\n\nMarch 24\n\n[edit]\n\nVince: Ladies and gentlemen, joining us now, yes, from the ultimate fighting war... world, rather, yes, it is war, for sure. There is Ken Shamrock, and Mr. Shamrock, in your officiating last night, firstly, why did you stop the match?\n\nKen Shamrock: Well, you know, I was in the match, and Steve Austin was in a great deal of pain even throughout the whole match. I asked him several times; he did not respond. As far as I could see, he was unconscious, I had to stop the match in order to protect his body because he was in severe, severe shape. So that is why I stopped the fight.\n\nVince: Alright, but you did not hear him say the words, \"I quit,\" did you? You did not hear him say the words, \"I quit,\" did you?\n\nKen: No, the words weren't said, \"I quit,\" but when a man goes unconscious and he cannot protect himself properly, that is why I was hired to do this match: was to make sure one man won. There was no cheating around, there was no holds here. And therefore, when Steve Austin passed out, he could not protect himself. So therefore, that is why I stopped the fight.\n\nVince: Alright, but then, as he could not protect himself, \"The Hitman\" Bret Hart, after the match was officially over, went back and attacked Stone Cold Steve Austin.\n\nKen: Yes, he did. And, you know, throughout the match there, there was a lot of dishing out pain going on in there, but one of the things that I guess I had to step in on was because after Stone Cold was on the mat, he was passed out and really could not protect himself, the reason why I stopped the match, Bret Hart decided to take it upon himself to go in there and put more pain upon him. And from what I could see, he was trying to end Stone Cold Steve Austin's career. I had to step in and stop that.\n\nVince: Indeed. Well, the Hitman wanted no part of you, no doubt about that. Let me ask you, as far as your opinion of Stone Cold Steve Austin. What is your opinion of him as far as last night' match is concerned?\n\nKen: Well, you know, particularly... me and Steve Austin have had some harsh words in the past. I particularly really don't care for him much. But there's one thing you cannot take from this man. Let me tell you, he went through a lot of pain, and there was no quit in that man. He kept fighting and fighting. You got to give him that, he is one tough character. I've seen a lot of tough people going through my life, going through the no holds barred competitions, and this guy is by far one of the toughest guys that I've seen.\n\nVince: All right, thank you very much for joining us.\n\nBret Hart: First of all, I wanna apologize. I'd like to apologize to all my fans over in Germany. I'd like to apologize to all my fans over in Great Britain. Actually, I like to apologize to all my fans all over Europe. All over Japan and the far east. I like to apologize to my fans in the middle east. All the way as far down as South Africa. And I especially like to apologize for all my great fans in Canada.\n\nAnd to you, my great fans across the United States of America...to you, I apologize for nothing! You know, it seems real strange to me that no matter how much I try that when I beat Stone Cold Steve Austin to a bloody pulp, I thought to myself, no matter how much I win, when I walked back to the dressing room. The way you American fans treat me across the United States of America, I feel like I lost. I mean I took a gutless creep like Stone Cold Steve Austin and beat him to a bloody pulp, even though he knows, and you all know that he lost, you cheer him on the way back to the dressing room like he won!\n\nYou know it didn't just start right here. Let's go back to WrestleMania last year when I was the World Wrestling Federation Champion. When that belt was around my waist and where it belonged. You cheered on a pretty boy like Shawn Michaels and you allowed him to screw me out of the World Wrestling Federation Championship belt. I found myself sitting at home watching the WWF on TV in Canada and saying to myself, \"The World Wrestling Federation needs a hero, they need a role model. They need someone to look up to.\" Not somebody who has earrings all over himself and tattoos. Not somebody who poses for girly magazines. By the way, I don't think it was a girly magazine, I think it was a gay magazine! So I felt this calling to come back to set the record straight and clean up the World Wrestling Federation. So I came back in the Survivor Series and I beat Stone Cold Steve Austin there and I think I garnered a little bit of respect. Then I found myself stepping in the ring with Sycho Sid and your hero, your pride and joy Shawn Michaels costs me the World Wrestling Federation championship belt. Nobody cared! Nobody did anything about it! You people didn't do anything about it.\n\nThey say \"Oh, don't worry about that. You can get in line with 29 other guys and you can go in the Royal Rumble.\" So being the man that I am, I got no problem fighting 29 other guys. So I went in the Royal Rumble, and I won. I was the last legal man standing in the Royal Rumble. But again, everyone just turns their back on it. You somehow justify in your minds that Stone Cold Steve Austin won. You know, a better man would've quit. Maybe I should have quit and gone home.\n\nVince: You did Bret, that's what you threatened.\n\nBret Hart: I got Gorilla Monsoon and Vince McMahon on their hands and knees begging me to come back. \"Don't quit! Think of your fans.\" Well, I thought of my fans and I came back. And they come up with this idea for the Final Four. The winner of the Final Four will get a World Wrestling Federation title fight at WrestleMania 13. That sounds good to me. So I accept, I came back. Then all of a sudden, your champion, your hero, Shawn Michaels comes up with this life ending, career ending knee injury and he forfeits the title so he can go home and find his smile. But that's okay, you people think that that's just fine. I see people in the audience crying for that. You talk about me crying. So I go into the Final Four with the outcome now being that whoever wins the Final Four will now be the World Wrestling Federation Champion. And who won the Final Four? I did. Right in the middle of the ring, I defeated three other guys in one night. I defeated Vader, I defeated Stone Cold Steve Austin, and I defeated the Undertaker, and I became the World Wrestling Federation Champion for a fourth time. Then they come up to me and go \"Well wait a minute! You don't get to rest even though you fought three other guys, even though you're beat up and sore. You got to go in the ring and fight 6'9\" Sycho Sid, and defend the title.\" Do you think I ran and hid? Do you think and found me forfeiting any titles? NO! I put the title on the line and I took Sycho Sid and I tied him in a big knot right in the middle of the ring. There he was in the Sharpshooter after being booed all the way through the match by my American wrestling fans, you somehow justify, only in America you can do this, Stone Cold Steve Austin climbs into the ring and whacks me in the back of the head with a chair. Somehow, you justify that that's okay, that's acceptable in America.\n\nSo I ask, or as you see it, I cried to Gorilla Monsoon. I asked and I begged and I pleaded and I said \"Give me Stone Cold Steve Austin. Give me a match with this guy who seems to be making my life a miserable hell.\" So I got Stone Cold Steve Austin and they agree to a match, a submission match. And then they go, \"Wait, we have some even better news for you. We will give you Sycho Sid in a 15-foot high steel cage match and no one will be able to interfere in that and you will have your shot at the World Wrestling Federation championship belt because we respect you.\" Well in that match, outside interference played a big factor again and somehow for some reason, The Undertaker is out there and he finds himself slamming my head in the door and he costs me the World Wrestling Federation Championship belt for the 5th time.\n\nSo I got one thing on my mind. After being screwed over by everybody in the World Wrestling Federation, after being abandoned by all you good fans right here in the United States of America, I decide that I'm going to go into this submission match with Stone Cold Steve Austin and give him every bit of what he deserves, just a good old fashioned ass whipping. And so when I do it, when I actually take that lousy stinking hyena Stone Cold Steve Austin and beat him to a bloody pulp, you somehow find it in your hearts to abandon me and cheer for him.\n\nYou know, I've proven myself so many times in the World Wrestling Federation and I've tried to be everything that you wanted me to be that it seems to me that you don't understand. You don't understand what it means to have dignity, to have poise, to bring prestige to the World Wrestling Federation, to be a man that brings a little class. Because you rather cheer for heroes like Charles Manson and O.J Simpson. Nobody glorifies criminal conduct like the Americans do and all the countries around the world, they still respect what's right and what's wrong. Respect. Now that we made everything real clear with ourselves tonight, it's obvious to me that all you wrestling fans coast to coast, you don't respect me. Well the fact is, I don't respect you. You don't deserve it. So from here on in, the American wrestling fans coast to coast can KISS MY ASS!!\n\n[Shawn Michaels comes out to the ring]\n\nShawn Michaels: Yo, Hitman! Let's get one thing perfectly straight. You can come out here and say whatever you want about me. Everyone does. And you don't have to explain to me or the World Wrestling Federation that you would never give up the WWF title because no one knows better than me or the WWF that it takes a hand written note from the lord almighty to take that belt from you. But Bret, what you don't understand is just because I come out here and choose to live my life openly and freely instead of putting a facade like you does not make a you a better man Bret. I am well aware of my faults. I can admit them up and down the line. And as far as Steve Austin is concerned, Bret, I was there last night. He didn't give up, alright? Now I'm no fan of Steve Austin but he passed out and even you have to admit somewhere in there, there's gotta be some of the old Hit Man left, even you have to admit that he is one tough S.O.B. Now Bret, I have tried and tried and tried to take the high road and I am in no shape to wrestle and I know, you're tougher than me blahblahblah, whole thing. I admit that, that's fine. I don't have to be number one Bret. I don't obsess like you do. I do it because I like it. You do this because in your mind, marked man, you really think that all of this is yours! Now what you need to understand is that every time they reach into their pocket to watch you, me or anybody else is that they have the right to cheer or boo anybody that they want! Now, hey, you don't have to tell me \"They're cheering me now.\" But they've booed me before. But you didn't see me getting all bent out of shape about it. You wanna know why Bret? It's because in this country, we something that's called the first amendment. And that amendment allows us to live our lives as we sit fit as long as it's causing harm to no one. If that guy there wants to stick a belly button piercing through his navel he can do it whether you like it or not! If that girl over there chooses to go out with someone you don't you approve of, \"Tough kitty\" said the kittie if she's going to do it! Now I'm going to get on my high and mighty roller coaster Bret. But you my friend, you gotta look at this, I'm in no shape to go. But if you want to go? What the hell? Let's go now.\n\nVince: Don't tell me. Bret Hart and Shawn Michaels. Shawn is in no condition to wrestle here.\n\nLawler: Then what's he doing out there.\n\nVince: Because he's got more guts than brains.\n\nLawler: Right.\n\nShawn Michaels: Do you know something? We've got a saying in the United States in American and it's called \"America, Love it or Leave it!\"\n\nBret Hart: Shawn Michaels, Boy Toy, I think you should go back to the dressing room, get the hell out of my face.\n\nShawn Michaels: You know me, Bret, I'm not real good with authority. By the way, how did you know I was in that girly magazine? You couldn't help yourself, could you? You had to flip through the pages just a little bit!\n\n[Bret attacks Shawn in the injured knee and puts him in the figure four around the ring post.]\n\n[Bret comes back out to do commentary during the Rocky Maivia/Leif Cassidy match-up]\n\nVince: What has made you snap, Bret Hart?\n\nBret Hart: I haven't snapped, I just opened my eyes.\n\nVince: What?!\n\nBret Hart: I call it opening my eyes! Why don't you open yours? Everybody in this building, they sit here and they cheer on Stone Cold Steve Austin, all these guys that set no example for anybody anywhere. And they have the nerve to actually cheer these guys on? Undertaker, there's a great role model. You know, I've had it up to here; I think people should open their eyes. I was the guy going to the ring every night wearing a white hat, trying to be a good person. Trying to be someone they could look up to.\n\nVince: [As Shawn Michaels is shown being carried to an ambulance.] There's a good person. Look what you just did, Shawn Michaels.\n\nBret Hart: Hey, I didn't ask him to come to the ring! I was trying to make a point and that is the point right there. Look at the screen, that is the point. I've had it up to here! Understand? Very simple.\n\nVince: I think we do. But again, I don't understand the logic. I don't understand why you're throwing away your legacy! You're throwing it away! You're flushing your legacy down the toilet, Bret!\n\nBret Hart: I didn't flush any legacy down any toilet. My toilet was flushed by all these people right here in this building. Not just in this building, but every building that I've wrestled in in the last three or four months. The only place I went to where I got a little respect was in Germany or England. Everywhere else-- or Canada. But in the United States of America, little kids holding up signs going \"You suck!\" You know what? I don't suck, they do!\n\nVince: It's almost as if you're at war with yourself.\n\nBret Hart: No, I'm not at war. Hey I feel like I got a million pounds off my chest. You want to see bad? I'll show you bad. Bad is something that you have never seen the likes of. You want to talk about wickedly bad? I'll show you wickedly bad! [runs into the ring and attacks Rocky Maivia]\n\nJune 30\n\n[edit]\n\nPaul Bearer: \"Well, we're gonna have to go back a few years, Mr. McMahon. About 20 years to be exact. We're talking about a little funeral home, sitting up on a hill – beautiful old trees all around – and a wonderful, wonderful family-owned funeral home. The family lived upstairs. The father was a mortician who ran the funeral home. The mother was the secretary, the receptionist. But there were two little kids there. One kid was a little red headed punk. And then there was a second kid – a sweet little kid named Kane. Now I was the apprentice at the funeral home. I worked under the red headed punk's father, who by now you properly know as The Undertaker. The Undertaker's father was a mortician of excellence. He told me everything I know. He told me the correct way to prepare a body for burial, how to do the make-up, how to deal with the families. He told me from A to Z. But while I was working on the funeral home, I've seen a lot of things going on, that shouldn't been happening.\n\nThis little red-headed punk, there was nothing funny about him. He had a look in his eye – the look of the devil! It was the devil's see if you know what I mean. What was so sad about the whole situation, is that poor little Kane, the little brother followed The Undertaker around everywhere he went. The Undertaker was little Kane's hero. Anything The Undertaker did was fine. It went on for about two years, my apprenticeship. I was at the college that night taking courses at Mortuary Science at the same time. The Undertaker and Kane would run around the funeral home like wild men. They had three reigning properties. They'd sneak out behind the garage. I'd see what they were doing. Their mom and daddy wouldn't see what they were doing but I saw what they were doing. I saw them, taking chemicals out of the embalming room in that funeral home. I saw them sneaking behind the garage, smoking cigarettes - when they were little kids.\n\nBut you know, one particular afternoon I was leaving to go to school. As I backed my car out of the funeral home, I looked behind and who do I see? That red head devil-seen Undertaker with his little brother. Something wasn't funny – it ain't. Something didn't seem right. But I went ahead and to the drive way, went to school. I came back from school about ten o'clock that night. And what do I see? I see fire trucks. I see ambulance. I see steam and smoke and I see that funeral home in ashes. Someone burnt down the funeral home. Inside that funeral home was this lovely family that took care of me. I looked over to the bushes. Who did I see in the bushes but The Undertaker? Undertaker, you burnt the funeral home to the ground. And along with the funeral home, you killed your parents. You killed your family, Undertaker! I know it. I've had to stick that on my inside all my life – 20 years. You've killed them. Undertaker, you are a MURDERER! YOU ARE A MURDERER! YOU'RE A GOD-DAMN MURDERER!\n\nJuly 7\n\n[edit]\n\nBret Hart: A few weeks ago, I was told ‘America: love it or leave it.’ Well, I’ve traveled all around the world, I’ve been all over the United States of America, and the one thing that I’ve in particular looked forward to is loving leaving it!\n\n[after Stone Cold Steve Austin defeats Hunter Hearst Helmsley thanks to interference from Mankind, whom Helmsley hit in the head with a steel chair. Austin grabs a microphone]\n\nJim Ross: This could be damning.\n\nVince McMahon: I hope he doesn’t say anything to the Canadians.\n\nSteve Austin: Get your ass up, you long-haired freak!\n\nMcMahon: He’s talking - he’s talking to, to Mankind.\n\nAustin: There ain’t no way one chair can keep your ass down, get in the ring! [Mankind crawls into the ring] You come out here every week, saying “Pick me, Steve! Pick me, Steve!”. I’ll lay it on the line for you, you piece of trash: I don’t like you one bit! But I’ll damn sure go to war with you, if that’s what you want. All you gotta do is shake my hand, and we’re a tag team.\n\nJerry Lawler: Whoa!\n\nRoss: Well, I guess the man with the personality of a rattlesnake is softening a little bit.\n\nLawler: Finally Mankind gets what he wants!\n\nRoss: All Mankind ever wanted was to be accepted.\n\n[Mankind outstretches his arms]\n\nLawler: He don’t want a handshake, he wants a hug!\n\n[Mankind and Austin share a big hug]\n\nMcMahon: I can’t believe it. Another moment in the WWF. Mankind, now a partner - [suddenly Austin gives Mankind the Stone Cold Stunner] - oh!\n\nRoss: No! No! Not the Stunner! Damn him!\n\nAustin: DTA, you stupid piece of trash! Don’t ever trust nobody! You ain’t gonna be my partner, never, ‘cause you’re a long-haired freak, and you suck! [drops the microphone and raises his arms for the crowd]\n\nMcMahon: My! Can’t believe that!\n\n[Austin leaves the ring and walks up the ramp to the cheers of the crowd]\n\nRoss: Well, if you’d like to have a pet rattlesnake, I’ll give you Austin’s phone number!\n\nMcMahon: Thank you, no. This capacity crowd-\n\nMankind [grabbing the microphone]: Austin! Austin!! I was just looking for a little bit of respect. I was looking for a friend, and you’ve ruined that all!!\n\nAustin [from the top of the entrance ramp, grinning]: Damn right!\n\nMankind: So it’s become very apparent, that drastic measures will be taken! Because, next week, well, I’m going to have to do something I never thought I’d do again. [Austin leaves] And it will become very obvious that the World Wrestling Federation will never be the same! Steve Austin, you will never be the same! And without a doubt next week, Mankind...will NEVER BE THE SAME!!! [whimpers]\n\nAugust 4\n\n[edit]\n\nVince: Well, I guess maybe that pretty much tells you something - a mixed reaction by this capacity crowd. And there is no doubt whether you did your job or you didn't do your job, but if it haven't had been for you, the Undertaker might still be the World Wrestling Federation Champion.\n\nShawn: So let me get this straight. You, the Undertaker, Bret \"The Hitman\" Hart and — the best that I can tell — all of the fans of the World Wrestling Federation are dumpin' this in my lap!\n\nVince: I don't know if that's necessarily fair...\n\nShawn: Shut up! Because you know something? It's just like you, it's just like Bret Hart and whether anybody in this arena likes it or not, it's just like all the fans of the World Wrestling Federation to not take responsibility for themselves and pass the buck on to the Heartbreak Kid because everybody knows I don't give a damn what anybody thinks of me! Shut up!\n\nI went out there last night, for the first time in my career put on a referee's shirt and did one hell of a job. I called it down the middle. Right or wrong?\n\nVince: Yes, you did.\n\nShawn: Exactly.\n\nVince: May I ask you a pertinent question, please?\n\nShawn: Yeah, cough it up!\n\nVince: Alright, it's on a lot of people's minds. It's something like this — it's controversial as it always is: Are you in any way in cahoots with Bret Hart? As preposterous as that may sound, a lot of people are wondering that.\n\nShawn: You know, I've always known you are a nimrod, but now you have convinced me that you are the dumbest sonofabitch I've ever met in my life.\n\nVince: Well, first of all, I don't appreciate that. Let's get that straight, okay?\n\nShawn: Ooohh, shoot me while I shudder in my loafers, McMahon!\n\nVince: Well you just might be shuddering come September 7, when you step into this ring with the Undertaker. That's when you gonna be shuddering! You can take this here.\n\nShawn: Get your ass out of here! [Vince leaves] You can move it or lose it, McMahon! Let me tell everybody what the story is. I am not in any way, shape or form in cahoots with Bret Hart. It is no secret that Bret Hart doesn't like me, Bret Hart doesn't respect me, but one thing is for damn sure, Bret Hart needs me! Because I am the only man in the World Wrestling Federation that has beat his ass! And that is the truth!\n\nAnd Undertaker... Undertaker, you and I, for as long as we've been in the World Wrestling Federation have never crossed paths. EXCEPT FOR NOW!\n\nCrowd: [chanting] Michaels sucks!\n\nShawn: Oh, I'm gonna tell you people something. Undertaker, the Heartbreak Kid Shawn Michaels lays down for absolutely no one! I don't do it for Bret Hart, I don't do it for you, I don't do it for the fans of the World Wrestling Federation, I don't do it for anybody. Undertaker, the next time you see Shawn Michaels, his Super...\n\nCrowd: You suck!\n\nShawn: Ten years! Ten years I've given you, and this is the respect that you give me. Each and everyone of you can go to hell! Undertaker, the next time you'll see me, my Superkick is gonna be one foot down your throat!\n\nAugust 18\n\n[edit]\n\nJim Ross: Steve, I want to thank you for allowing us to come to your hotel room here, I know you've got a very busy and a very crucial 24-hour period here in Philadelphia, seeing a specialist tomorrow about your neck, but thanks for giving us a little of your time.\n\nSteve Austin: Well you're welcome for the time, but if you're here to ask a bunch of questions, you might as well start asking, otherwise I'll throw your ass out the window. And to come to the hotel room, this ain't a hotel room that I would stay at! You know, when I got hurt at SummerSlam, when I got dumped on my head, no one called me and said, \"Hey, Steve, you okay?\" No one ever sent a card, nothin' like that. Not that I would expect it, but at least I would have, you know, maybe a call just to see what the hell's goin' on with the hottest damn wrestler in the world, but I got nothin'! So the WWF sees fit to put me in a room like this, with all this fruit and trash like this, you want a pear? [Starts tossing fruit at Jim Ross] You want an apple? You want a banana or somethin'? Here, make yourself at home, man! [Austin tosses the entire fruit basket at Ross] But if you got questions to ask, you go ahead and ask 'em, 'cause I'm gettin' a little tired of you!\n\nJim Ross: I'd like you to address three things, if you don't mind.\n\nSteve Austin: Sure.\n\nJim Ross: One is SummerSlam, your paralysis after being driven in the mat from the Tombstone by Owen Hart; the second thing is what the doctors have told you; and thirdly, and lastly, what you perceive your future to be here in the WWF.\n\nSteve Austin: Well, let's start with SummerSlam. The bottom line is I'm the Intercontinental Champion. Right?\n\nJim Ross: Right.\n\nSteve Austin: Well, that's that. But aside from that, at the end of the match, close to the end of the match when Owen Hart dumped me on my head - you figure I weight 245, 250, bam, you get planted in the mat, shit happens! And that's, for basically about 50 seconds there, I couldn't move my arms or my legs, and I didn't know if I ever would move again! It felt pretty damn scary, so, um, you know, I'm through with that, looking past that, I've watched that on tape probably 30 or 40 times and it still sucks every time I see it! But I'm over it, and I'm movin' around, and I'm happy about that! But Owen Hart has got hell to pay! You get dumped on your head, you get in the position that I was put in, it ain't worth a damn. And I, I'm just, uh, a little bit pissed off No, I'm not a little pissed off, I'm a whole lot pissed off, but you know what they say, it's better to be pissed off than pissed on. But Owen Hart's got hell to pay when I come back, and as you say, you've got another question, what was the other question?\n\nJim Ross: The doctors, you've seen several doctors...\n\nSteve Austin: I've seen a couple of doctors, and one guy said, uh, uh, \"Maybe you should do something else.\" Well, Steve Austin doesn't do anything else, what I do is wrestle, and I'm the best wrestler in the world, and can't nobody tell me different! So I'm supposed to see the top guy, uh, the top spine guy in the country tomorrow here in Philadelphia, and see what he has to say, and it doesn't matter really what he says, the end result, the decision's mine! He can sit there and say, \"Don't do this, try not to do this,\" whatever, but the bottom line is I'm the one that makes the decision, so I'll sit there, rethink things, and go from there. But regardless of what he says, Owen Hart's got hell to pay! You know, when you do something to...when you do what he did to me, you know, if it's my last step in life, you can damn well bet he's gonna get the shit kicked out of him one way or the other, and that's it. You know, I don't know when, where or how, or what, but it's gonna happen.\n\nAs far as my future - don't sit there and try to butt in because I'm talkin', right? Okay, as far as my future goes, hell, like I said, I'll listen to what the doctor says, but I'm gonna do what I want. The future for Steve Austin, as far as I'm concerned, is to put on his black trunks and black boots and show up. Im'ma take a few days off, I'll probably take a few weeks off, because, you know, when you're sittin' there at the house, you watch a film of, uh, you gettin' paralyzed for another 50 seconds, you watch that 30 or 40 times, you know, it kinda, you get a little depressed! So I drank a few cases of beer, I'll tell you exactly what I did. I just ride around in my Ford, drink a few beers and sit there and think about it. But, uh, I'm gonna go see this doctor and see what he has to say, and, but as far as I'm concerned, the only way I can see my future is to be Stone Cold Steve Austin, continue on right through the top in the WWF, just like I've done since I've been here! All the damn bureaucratic red tape, all the bullshit I've been through, it's taken me eight years to get where I'm at right now! If you think for one split second that a piledriver's gonna stop me, it ain't gonna happen. Did it slow me down? Damn right, but it ain't gonna stop me. Ground Zero, Sub-Zero, whatever the hell you wanna call it, Louisville, I'll be there! Whether it's to hand the belt over, if I decide maybe it's time to hang it up, I'll do that! I don't think that's gonna happen. I think when, uh, Ground Zero rolls around, you'll see Stone Cold - don't wipe your nose, it pisses me off - you'll see Stone Cold Steve Austin - and don't smile - you'll see Stone Cold Steve Austin in a black pair of trunks and a black pair of boots, and I'll be out there whippin' somebody's ass! I don't know what kind of match it is, it's some kind of little, uh, four tag teams of some kind of shit like that, is that right?\n\nJim Ross: That's right.\n\nSteve Austin: Okay, well, I'll be there! And... what gets me is, is that Steve Austin's in a new level now, because, you know, if,if I was pissed off before, I'm a lot more pissed off now, and that makes me even more dangerous, not a liability, and that's the bottom line! You got anything else you wanna say?\n\nJim Ross: No sir.\n\nSteve Austin: Then get the hell out.\n\nSeptember 22\n\n[edit]\n\n[Before the police arrest Austin, Vince comes into the ring]\n\nVince: What’s the matter with you?! Get ahold of yourself!\n\nLawler: Arrest him!\n\nVince: [To the police] Just give me a minute. Just give me a minute! [To Austin] What is the matter with you? You had to forfeit the Intercontinental title, the Tag Team title, of course everybody can understand why you’re upset. I can understand you being upset not being able to compete, I can understand that. But don’t break the law!\n\nLawler: He already did...look at this!\n\nJim Ross: Stone Cold's not gonna win this fight with New York City's finest.\n\nVince: Don't you understand? Don’t you understand why you’re not allowed to compete? Can’t you get that through your head? Don’t you know why? Don’t you know that you’re not physically able to compete? Your doctors say you’re not ready. If you compete, you could injure yourself for good! You could wind up paralyzed! And the WWF is not gonna stand by and let you do that to yourself. These people don’t want you to wind up in a wheelchair! They wanna see you compete. Everybody wants to see you compete. But in due time, Steve. In due time. [Austin looks at his watch]\n\nLawler: Listen to McMahon, get the violins.\n\nVince: Get ahold of yourself.\n\nJim Ross: He's telling the truth. Makes all the sense in the world.\n\nLawler: [indicating the cops] He'd better be talking to those guys over there. I say put him in the slammer!\n\nVince: Listen, don’t you know people care? In the World Wrestling Federation, we care. They care, they care about you, that’s all it is. And you just gotta go with it. In other words, you simply, you gotta work within the system. That’s all you gotta do, is just work within the system.\n\nSteve Austin: You know as well as I do that this is what I do for a livin’. This is all that I do, and can’t nobody tell I ain’t the best in the damn world. Don’t even say nothin’. Don’t say nothin’. You sit here and tell me to work within the system. You ain’t the one sittin’ on your ass in the house like I am. But if that’s what it takes to make you or the World Wrestling Federation happy, hell, I feel like Cool Hand Luke. I’ll work within your stupid little system.\n\nVince: That's all that these people a—\n\nSteve Austin: I appreciate the fact that you and the World Wrestling Federation care. And I also appreciate the fact...that, hell, you can kiss my ass!\n\n[Austin kicks McMahon in the gut and Stuns him]\n\nJim Ross: Oh, God! Oh my God!\n\nLawler: Put him in jail! Put him in jail right now!\n\n[Hunter Hearst Helmsley is waiting for his match with Dude Love with a chain in hand, but the Dude appears on the TitanTron]\n\nDude Love: Oh, ho ho ho ho! Owww, have mercy! Hunter and especially your finer Chyna, I know what you must be thinking. 'Dude, what are you doing back here, when you should be out there kicking some heavy duty booty all over The Garden?' Hunter, my man, I do believe it's time we had a little rap, ho-ho. Because you see, Falls Count Anywhere— Well, that not exactly my bag, baby. The pinfalls in the hot dog stands, the pinfalls in the street, the chairs, the tables, it's not exactly a Love thing. But I know somebody, daddy, who's bag it indeed is. He's my man, he's my main man, you might even say, well daddy, he's a kind man. A kooky type of cat, let's bring him out right now.\n\n[Mankind's music plays as Mankind walks into the picture]\n\nDude Love: Ho ho, Mankind, my main mandible— up high big man, down low— Owww, you're too slow, ho ho. Mankind, good to have you at the Love Shack.\n\nMankind: Hi, Dude. Thanks for having me here.\n\nDude Love: The pleasure's all mine.\n\nMankind: You really are eye candy for the chicks, Dude.\n\nDude Love: That much I know, Daddy, but you gotta tell me about this wacky match: Falls Count Anywhere.\n\nMankind: Dude, as much as I've dreamed about destroying Hunter Hearst Helmsley...\n\nDude Love: I know you have.\n\nMankind: ...as many horrible things as I'd like to do to him...\n\nDude Love: I know you can.\n\nMankind: I know someone who dreams about it even more.\n\nDude Love: Who is it, Manny?\n\nMankind: Someone who's willing to do even worse things than I have.\n\nDude Love: Oh no, are you thinking what I think you're thinking?\n\nMankind: I think I am thinking what you think I think you're thinking.\n\nDude Love: Can you bring him out, Manny?\n\nMankind: Here he comes.\n\nDude Love: Where is he?\n\nMankind: CACTUS JACK... IS BACK!\n\n[Cactus Jack walks into the picture carrying a trash can, Helmsley loses it with the referee]\n\nDude Love: Somebody spank me, I thought he was dead!\n\nMankind: He's alive. HE'S ALIVE!\n\nCactus Jack: Don't blink. It may be the darkest day of your life, because it's Madison Square Garden, and Mrs. Foley's little boy...is finally home. BANG BANG!\n\nDude Love: [overlappping] Bye bye, Hunter, have fun! Owww, have mercy!\n\nJerry Lawler: What in the world!?\n\nJim Ross: [overlapping] Oh my God. Drastic times call for drastic measures!\n\n[A garbage bin is thrown from off-curtain, followed by a large broom before Cactus Jack enters with a trash can]\n\nJim Ross: And for a man, that has wrestled on nails, and barbed wire and set himself on fire, this will be a day at Central Park!\n\nOctober 6\n\n[edit]\n\n[Paul Bearer is at the ring with Kane, who just trashed the Hardy Boyz]\n\nPaul Bearer: Now that I have your undivided attention— Yes, laugh at the fat man. Go ahead! Here's your chance. Go ahead and laugh at me. Stand up, call me names, do what you wanna do. Here's your chance. The one you should be laughing at is your so-called phenom. The one you should be laughing at is your hero, The Undertaker. The proof is here. I tried to go back to The Undertaker, he wouldn't take me back. I had to do what I had to do. He slapped me around, he called me a liar. He burned me! Burned!\n\nLadies and Gentlemen, let me present to you, The Undertaker's little brother: Kane! Look close, Undertaker. The whole world saw your face last night, when you stood for the first time in twenty years face-to-face with your own brother. We can all tell by the look in your eyes that you knew it was him. Yes, oh yes, he's alive. Look at his eye, Undertaker. He's missing an eye. And it's your fault! The 20 years of suffering, the 20 years of hiding-out is now over. And we have you to thank, Undertaker.\n\nUndertaker, this is your Stop sign on your highway to eternity. Starting with these boys tonight, we are gonna walk through the World Wrestling Federation, take each one, each wrestler, one by one and destroy them. Until we reach you! You, Undertaker. That is why Kane is here. And we have you to thank. Every time you look around, you're going to see your brother behind you. Every time you close your eyes to go to sleep, you're going to remember that terrible night. The fire! Oh yes, the fire. Undertaker, welcome to your worst nightmare.\n\nShawn: [waiting for footage from Badd Blood] Now I know we don't have any brain surgeons in that truck, but this is a television studio per se. Do you think, Vince McMahon, you could get one of those idiots in your truck to send out my performance at Badd Blood? [Footage appears on TitanTron...] All right, here we go... [...not of Badd Blood, but of the MSG \"Curtain Call.\"] Whoa. Wait a minute!\n\nHunter Hearst-Helmsley: [both feigning shock] Oh my God, what is that?\n\nShawn: That's not Badd Blood, that's...\n\nHunter: That's Madison Square Garden!\n\nShawn: That's May 19th, Madison Square Garden!\n\nHunter: That's you, Shawn!\n\nShawn: And that's...that's...that's Razor!\n\nHunter: And Big Daddy Cool Diesel!\n\nShawn: But who's that...that's you, Triple H! Wait a minute! Hey, you were a bad guy, I was a good guy!\n\nVince: What is this?\n\nHunter: You were a good guy, I was a bad guy!\n\nShawn: What were you doing in there? That's...wait a minute! Wait a minute...that was supposed to be Vince McMahon's biggest day—the first time Madison Square Garden had been sold...aw, it's off the screen. Oh, Vin-man, what's the matter? That subject's still a little too sensitive for you, big man. [Both get out of ring and approach Vince at announcers' desk] Vinnie Mac, what's the matter? Come on, what's the matter? Is your dad rolling over in his grave? The family traditions in the McMahon...has it come to an end because me and my buddies made an ass out of ya? Come on, you were an ass long before I made one out of ya!\n\nJim Cornette: This is Jim Cornette, and the views that I'm about to express are not necessarily those of anybody else but me. But they oughta be. And as a matter of fact, they probably are.\n\nYou know, a lot of things in the wrestling world make me cranky these days, especially the way some talent is treated and some talent is looked at by not only the promoters, but the wrestling fans as well. For example, a man like Arn Anderson who just had to retire from this sport, after giving it his entire life, because of an injury that he suffered; a guy like \"Nature Boy\" Ric Flair, who in my opinion, is one of the greatest talents in the history of this business; guys like Mankind, Cactus Jack, Dude Love, whatever you want to call him. Great talents in the WWF or WCW.\n\nBut who gets a lot of the attention, from the wrestling fans especially? Guys like the NWO, the New World Order. You know, all the fans think these guys are so cool and so sweeeeet, and so funny. Well, as far as I'm concerned, the NWO is like a bunch of guys meeting out in the backyard in a clubhouse in a tree. They're guys who, all they have to do... They got the easiest job in the world... All they have to do is go out there and be themselves—childish, obnoxious, adolescent guys with a case of severe arrested emotional development, and a fixation on trying to act macho.\n\nYou got a guy like Kevin Nash, 40 years old, trying to act like a teenager. Far as I'm concerned, the biggest no-talent in the business. He's got six moves, no mobility, and enough timing to cover up for some of it. But what he does is he goes around and he manipulates. Kevin Nash had a multi-million dollar promotional company, the WWF, push him to the moon to make him a star, and then what does he do? He leaves—after he gives his word he's staying, so by the way, he's a liar, too—he leaves and he goes to WCW for a big contract. Why? More on that later.\n\nYou got a guy like Scott Hall, who's a good wrestler, but \"good\" is about it. He's the best of the bunch. But he had the same million dollar promotional company make him a star, after he'd been in the business 10 years without putting three asses in a seat. And what does he do? He goes to WCW for a big contract. Why? More on that later.\n\nAnd then you got a guy... Syxx, 1-2-3 Kid, his name's Sean Waltman. Whatever you want to call him. As far as I'm concerned, the only reason that he's employed is because the other guys think that he's funny when he gets drunk and throws up on himself. He has the distinction, in case you haven't noticed, of being the only guy since this \"wrestling war\" got started, that was released from a valid contract from one company to go to the other side, which shows you how valuable he is.\n\nYou know why they're all employed? Why they're all in the spot they are today? Because of Eric Bischoff. The boss of WCW, not the NWO. Look at the credits on their PPV if you can get one for free! The idiot's name is on it! He's the boss of WCW, he works for Ted Turner, and he throws a billionaire's money around, just like water, so he can have guys that he likes to hang out with.\n\nBecause, even more than being a mark—yeah, for his own face and his own voice—Eric Bischoff is a guy who's a big fan of hanging around studly guys with long hair and beards, that smoke cigars, and ride Harleys. So that some of that can rub off on his little pansy-ass frame. So he takes that billionaire's money, and he throws that around like water to buy guys that he can hang around, to prove that his johnson is bigger than everybody else's. And that's the sole reason the NWO guys are employed.\n\nI think, me personally, that it's about time that the wrestling fans and the promoters, all of them in this business, start recognizing guys like \"Nature Boy\" Ric Flair, like Arn Anderson, like Cactus Jack. Guys who bust their ass, who work hard, and have ability and have talent to get where they are, instead of a bunch of guys that get to their spot by hanging around with the boss and sucking up. I'm Jim Cornette, and that's my opinion.\n\nOctober 13\n\n[edit]\n\nBret: [to Shawn and Hunter on the TitanTron] Why don't you two degenerates come down here right now and step in the ring with me right now? Either one of you, I don't care! Either one of you, right now!\n\nShawn: Is he challenging me?\n\nHunter: Is he challenging us?\n\nShawn: Now regularly, regularly I would take him up on his challenge. But you know why I'm not gonna? You know why I'm not gonna? I'll tell you why. Because the last time I took him up on a challenge was WrestleMania, and I beat his ass for that stupid piece of tin he's got on his shoulder; and at Survivor Series, I'm gonna take that stupid piece of tin you got on your shoulder once again. I've beaten you, I've beaten your brother, I've beat both your brother-in-laws, and I'll beat up your whole family if you get in my face one more time.\n\nHunter: And as far as I'm concerned, Bret Hart, you want a piece of me, huh?! [Shawn holds him back] You want a piece of me?! Come on! I'll take you on, Hitman! I'll give you the worst beating of your life! Hey, wait a second. I did that last week. I did that last week, Hitman! So never mind, I don't need to do it twice! I already did it!\n\nShawn: I tell you, I took so many shots to my head, I almost forgot how bad we beat him up last week. Hitman, I got news for you. Sometime during this show, we are gonna cross paths. And you talk about us being degenerates. You know what, I'm tired of Generation X getting a bad rap.\n\nHunter: Do you think you're a degenerate?\n\nShawn: Well, do you think you're a degenerate?\n\nHunter: Well, I mean...\n\nShawn: I mean, I'm positive I'm one.\n\nHunter: I guess I'd have to be one then.\n\nShawn: Well you know what? Generation X always gets a bad rap, everybody calls us degenerates. Degeneration X, is that us? Degeneration X—Triple H, HBK, Chyna, Ravishing Rick. We are Degeneration X—you make the rules, and we...will...break 'em!\n\nJim Cornette: I'm Jim Cornette, and the views I'm about to express are my own, but as you'll see, they may be yours, too.\n\nThere's a man named Phil Mushnick who writes columns for the New York Post and for TV Guide. You probably never heard of Mr. Mushnick, but you should because he's had some pretty nasty things to say about you. You see, Phil Mushnick hates pro wrestling and he's not content just to change the channel. He doesn't want you be able to watch it, either. Not the WWF, WCW, ECW, nothing.\n\nAnd for the past several years, Mushnick has led a one-man campaign to have the wrestling industry abolished. Recently, when Ted Turner donated one billion dollars to charity, Mr. Mushnick said \"the world would be better served if he closed up WCW.\" Phil Mushnick is the man who called for and spearheaded the media and publicity barrage over the federal indictment of Vince McMahon and the WWF on steroid charges. And even though McMahon and the WWF were proven totally innocent in a federal courtroom, Mushnick ignores that fact to this very day and writes his columns as if it were a fact that they were proven guilty just so he can continue his one-man crusade. He even wrote a column one time about the Madison Square Garden Network firing Marv Albert, saying that the Garden should cancel wrestling matches, too.\n\nBut Phil Mushnick not only hates wrestling, he hates wrestling fans. Here's a few things he's had to say about you, and I quote:\n\n\"If not for America's lunatic fringe and the disaffected, WCW would be out of business. If you can tell me that you would bring an important child in your life to a pro wrestling match, I have no gripe with you because you clearly don't know right from wrong. And the overwhelming majority of the wrestling fans who contact me simply prove my point by flooding my mailbox with profanities, obscenities, and other acts that show them to be a disenfranchised sub-culture.\"\n\nWell, Mr. Mushnick, I'm a wrestling fan and a lot of the people who read the New York Post and TV Guide are wrestling fans, too. And we don't enjoy being insulted by publications we pay money to read. We don't appreciate being told we don't know how to parent our children! We don't want a pompous, self-righteous man with a grudge sitting on top of Mount Olympus looking down his nose at us campaigning to take away the constitutional right that every American is guaranteed, to freedom of speech, freedom of choice, and freedom to enjoy whatever entertainment we choose! Those are facts, Mr. Mushnick, not rumors, not suppositions, but facts. You oughta try to deal in them sometime. And I think it's time that the millions of people you belittle as subhuman every chance you get tell the New York Post and TV Guide what they think of ya.\n\nBut if this has been going on so long, why am I mad right now? Because recently, Phil Mushnick used Brian Pillman's death to call for another outcry against wrestling, and I quote once again:\n\n\"The problem is the mainstream media don't look hard enough at pro wrestling. Imagine if middle-aged pro baseball players dropped dead on a regular basis, this would be page one stuff, and a federal inquiry would be launched.\"\n\n[At this point, Cornette is seething with anger.]\n\nWell, Brian Pillman was a friend of mine. From the time he was born with throat cancer, he had the courage to undergo 36 different throat operations. He had the courage to withstand the punishment of pro football and ten years as a pro wrestler. He had the courage to come back from a car wreck that shattered his ankle, and from a lot of other personal tragedies. And then one night, he went to sleep in a hotel room and he died. And for you, Phil Mushnick, to use his death as an excuse for another call to action in your one-man vendetta against pro wrestling is more vulgar and more obscene than anything that you've ever falsely accused the wrestling industry of being guilty of! So on behalf of the wrestling fans, the wrestling industry, the friends and family of Brian Pillman, and anyone in this country that denies any one man the right to force his morals and his beliefs on all of us and to take away our constitutional rights, on behalf of those people, I say go to hell, Phil Mushnick! And try to reform things down there because we're doing just fine without you!\n\nI'm Jim Cornette, and that's my opinion.\n\nOctober 27\n\n[edit]\n\nJim Cornette: I'm Jim Cornette. I'm just wondering if there's any people that are sick and tired as I am to be the icon of wrestling. Hulk Hogan and Roddy Piper claim to be the icon, Shawn Michaels is the icon that can still go, Bret Hart would claim to be the icon if he wasn't too busy crying about being screwed, and Randy Savage is still \"Thinkin', Thinkin'!\" Well, Shawn Michaels is still the single most talented athlete inside the ring, but outside he's an adolescent obnoxious jerk who takes the tights and goes home if he doesn't get his way. Bret Hart is one of the greatest wrestlers of all time, but if he'd have been screwed as many times as he claims, he'd have struck oil by now. And Randy Savage is a legend, but let's face it, how many records did Frank Sinatra sell last year? But the pinnacle of this icon garbage came at last night's cage match between Hulk Hogan and Roddy Piper to determine—in their minds only—who the real icon is. WCW had the gall to say that this is the greatest cage match in history when it was the greatest in three weeks since Hell in a Cell. But here, you've got a 46-year-old, bald-headed movie star wannabe who looks like Uncle Creepy with a good build, taking on a guy with an artificial hip that hasn't wrestled a full schedule in ten years. It's a tribute to the massive egotism in my mind of both men and an indictment of WCW's promotional policies that this match took place, much less being in the main event when the card was probably the best that WCW was capable of having. By the ten minute mark, they were sucking wind so bad, the first three rows passed out of oxygen deprivation. Would've been funny if it wasn't sad. Well, I'm sick and damn tired of hearing guys claim to be the icon, especially when it used to come from guys who usually didn't know when to quit. Roddy Piper was my idol when I was a teenager, but that was 20 years ago. Hulk Hogan, during his best years, was 50% media recreation, and those days are long gone. This match was a slap in the face to every wrestler that takes pride in his profession, and in my mind, no one man is bigger in this sport. But if there is an icon, it would be a man who has great ability inside the ring, and professionalism and maturity outside of it. Let's leave all the petty backstabbing \"I make more money than you,\" BS with the hat check girl and let's concentrate on talent and attitude. The Undertaker, Ric Flair and Steve Austin have never claimed to be icons, which means that they are big candidates to be just that. And on a personal note to Hulk Hogan, you are a household word, but so is garbage and it stinks when it gets old too. I'm Jim Cornette, and that's my opinion.\n\nNovember 17\n\n[edit]\n\nJim Ross: Let's cut right to the chase here. Seven days ago at the Survivor Series, did you, or did you not, screw Bret Hart?\n\nVince: Some would say I screwed Bret Hart; Bret Hart would definitely tell you I screwed him. I look at it from a different standpoint. I look at it from the standpoint of the referee did not screw Bret Hart, Shawn Michaels certainly did not screw Bret Hart, nor did Vince McMahon screw Bret Hart. I truly believe that Bret Hart screwed Bret Hart, and he can look in the mirror and know that.\n\nJim Ross: I'm sure in some parts of the country right now, there's a collective groan that you're not accepting responsibility, that you orchestrated the situation, and the fact that there are people not gonna understand what you mean by, \"Bret Hart screwed Bret Hart,\" so what do you mean by that?\n\nVince: Well, I will certainly take responsibility for any decision I've ever made; I've never had a problem doing that. Not that all of my decisions are accurate—they're not—but when I make a bad decision, I'm not above saying I'm sorry and trying to do the best about it that I can. Hopefully, the batting average is pretty good—I make more good decisions than I do bad decisions. And as far as screwing Bret Hart is concerned, there's a time-honored tradition in the wrestling business that when someone is leaving, that they show the right amount of respect to the WWF superstars, in this case, who helped make you that superstar. You show the proper respect to the organization that helped you become who you are today. It's a time-honored tradition, and Bret Hart didn't wanna honor that tradition, and that's something I never, ever would've expected from Bret because he is known as somewhat of a traditionalist in this business. It would've never crossed my mind that Bret would not have wanted to show the right amount of respect to the superstar who helped make him and the organization who helped make him what he is today. Nonetheless, that was Bret's decision. Bret screwed Bret.\n\nJim Ross: Some folks along the Internet know that, in 1996, Bret signed a 20-year contract with the WWF. Then I'm sure there are some at home now, some folks are saying, \"well, how could Bret Hart be...he's got 18 years left on the contract. How can he leave?\" Did Bret Hart ask you to leave the WWF, or did you ask him to leave the WWF?\n\nVince: This was a joint decision and it vacillated somewhat as well. It was a joint decision from both Bret and me. And ultimately what happened was the two of us got together and orchestrated the opportunity for Ted Turner's wrestling organization to quote, \"steal,\" Bret. I felt that, for business reasons, that Bret Hart and the salary we were paying him was not justified. And Bret felt that for creative reasons and the fact that he had become sort of second banana in his own mind to Shawn Michaels who had, quote, \"stolen his spot.\" So for financial reasons on my part, and creative reasons on Bret Hart's part, the two of us got together and decided, \"okay, let's do the very best we can for you, Bret.\" So the two of us orchestrated Bret Hart receiving a three-year deal, in which he is paid $3 million a year, which I believe is the richest deal in all of professional wrestling, and that's for working 125 days a year. So I felt from a personal standpoint that if Bret wasn't a great investment any longer for the WWF, although I really didn't want him to go, but nonetheless, that the least I could do for Bret is to help him help himself. And I told Bret, \"Bret, if you in fact get this deal from Turner, I am going to be the first person personally to congratulate you.\" And I was. From a business standpoint, I didn't really want to lose Bret. He wasn't paying off from a financial standpoint, but nonetheless, I really didn't want to lose Bret.\n\nJim Ross: Certainly, the bitterness of the loss at the Survivor Series could never be more prevalent. He stands in the ring and spits in your face. Shortly thereafter, he is destroying WWF television equipment. Were you prepared for what happened after the match?\n\nVince: I was disappointed in Bret when he hit me. Very disappointed. Um, I sustained a concussion, as a result of it, with vision problems to this day. I'll get over it. I didn't think it was the right thing to do. Bret seems to be crowing about that, that I've read, where, you know, he feels proud of striking me. And it wasn't a question of a confrontation because even at 52 years old, I dare say that perhaps things would have been a little different if there was a confrontation. I allowed Bret to strike me, I had hoped that he wouldn't. I had hoped that we could sit down and try and work things out as gentlemen. That's what I had really hoped for. But that's not what happened.\n\nJim Ross: Have you considered pressing charges or perusing legal remedies for that situation in his locker room?\n\nVince: I have considered it. I think those options are still available. I'm not pursuing it at the moment. I guess it all depends on Bret as to whether or not I do.\n\nJim Ross: If you were only a story writer, and the Survivor Series was the final chapter in the story of Bret Hart, the WWF years, how would have preferred to write the final chapter?\n\nVince: As a storyteller, I would have hoped that Bret's story would be a dramatic one. I would hope that Bret's story would be one that would give him dignity, that would give him the poise to state that, \"I was, maybe, the greatest WWF Superstar ever,\" in terms of his departure. And one way of being able to give back to the company, being able to give back to those individuals, those superstars, who helped you achieve the level of success that you have, when you know that you are leaving in a time-honored tradition, might have been, for argument's sake, that after the most grueling match that Bret ever had in his life, that Bret was pinned. But in that small moment of defeat, Bret would have stood straight up and shown the whole world what a true champion, both as a human being and a wrestling persona, he really is. And if I had been Bret, if I were writing the story, I can see Bret, after a 1-2-3, simply saying, \"Okay,\" to his opponent, \"you got the best of me. I want to congratulate you. I want to stick my hand out and congratulate you. And furthermore, I want everyone in the whole locker room to watch my match, so that I can show, for those who follow in my footsteps, the way in a time-honored tradition, this is to be done. To show every individual, every secretary, everyone in Titan Sports, the WWF, who counts on me to do the right thing, that I was there, that I was a Superstar, maybe the greatest of ever. And I went out the way a true champion would go out.\"\n\nJim Ross: Are you able to step back and objectively look at this thing and evaluate your friend, your perhaps former friend Bret Hart, the human being, and have sympathy for this man?\n\nVince: Sympathy? I have no sympathy for Bret whatsoever. None. I have no sympathy for someone who is supposed to be a wrestling traditionalist, not doing the right thing for the business that made him, not doing the right thing for the fans and the performers and the organization who helped make him what he is today. Bret made a very, very selfish decision. Bret's gonna have to live with that for the rest of his life. Bret screwed Bret. I have no sympathy whatsoever for Bret.\n\nJim Ross: This is a crazy question. Would you welcome Bret Hart back? If he said, \"you know Vince, I've changed my mind. Can I come back?\" Would you allow him to return to the WWF? I mean, he spit in your face, notwithstanding destroying television monitors & equipment, certainly notwithstanding the fact that he punched you. Would you allow him to ever come back to the WWF if that was an option?\n\nVince: This is a strange business, and yes, I would. We would have to have a real frank understanding. I would want to hear Bret say, \"Vince, I'm sorry. I didn't mean to be selfish, I just kind of lost it there for a while.\" And I have no problem saying, \"Bret, jeez, I'm sorry that I had to do what I had to do as well.\" Would I welcome him back? I also would tell Bret no more free shots. I would want that strictly from a man's standpoint, I'd want him to know that. And in the future if we're going to have problems along those lines, in the locker room or anywhere else, okay, we're going to have them, but no more free shots. Yeah. If Bret could tear up his contract with the other guys right now and return, I'd welcome Bret back under those conditions.\n\nJim Ross: Was his motivation...do you believe his motivations then, primarily? He said he didn't leave here for the money.\n\nVince: There were signs in the arena following Survivor Series, \"Bret sold out.\" Bret seems to be sensitive to that subject, that he doesn't want to be known as someone who sold out. I'm proud of the fact that I helped Bret sell out. And that's what Bret did, he sold out. And it's not a big deal because I helped him do it. So, do I think that Bret left for the money? I think that when your making $3 million a year, and you're working 125 days of that year, I think Bret sold out, and I don't blame him for selling out. I helped him sell out. Matter of fact, I would suggest there could be a long line outside the next locker room with wrestlers begging me, \"Vince, help me sell out.\" So, do I think he sold out? Yeah, and I think that every time Bret says, \"No, I didn't do it for the money,\" I think that Bret loses credibility every time he says that.\n\nJim Ross: Did this whole ugly ordeal with Bret Hart affect you more professionally, the businessman side of Vince McMahon, or the personal side of Vince McMahon?\n\nVince: From the business side, the WWF will go on beyond Bret Hart. From the personal side, it definitely has affected me. I think that Bret and I...you can't end a 14-year relationship like was ended without having feelings. I regret that I felt that I was forced into making the decision that I made. I regret that Bret didn't do the right thing for the business and for himself, because it wouldn't have cost him one dollar less with his deal with Turner. I regret that his fans, if there is such a thing separate from WWF fans, are in any way hurt by any of this. I regret that his family is enduring...having to endure this tirade that Bret seems to be on. I regret that a member of my family, my son, had to witness some of this, especially in the locker room. I regret all of that, from a personal standpoint, yet steadfast remain that I made a tough decision, but it was the right decision for the WWF fans and the WWF superstars that remain here loyal to us.\n\nJim Ross: If you had the opportunity to speak with Bret, and now's not a bad opportunity, because you know he watching. Everybody involved in this situation is watching this right now. What would you say to him now?\n\nVince: Probably what I said to him in the locker room, and that is that he made a mistake, that I believe he'll regret from a professional standpoint, didn't have to be made that way. I felt I had to do what I had to do for my company, and our fans, and our superstars that remain here. And I'm unwavering in that point of view, and perhaps Bret is unwavering in his point of view. I don't know that we'll ever get together, I hope we will one day. It's too bad that a 14-year relationship was destroyed because one member of that relationship forgot that we're in the sports-entertainment business. Forgot where he came from.\n\nJim Ross: When will you be over this?\n\nVince: I'm over it now. At the same time, Bret has been such a part of the WWF. Bret will always...a part of Bret will always be here in the World Wrestling Federation, and I'm going to remember the good times. I'm going to remember all the things that we did with Bret, which he performed to his greatest degree possible, and told those wonderful stories. I'm going to remember Bret as the Excellence of Execution. It's just too damn bad that in the end, Bret really wasn't \"the best there is, the best there was, and the best there ever will be.\" And he had that opportunity to live up to that in his final match in the WWF, and he failed.\n\nDecember 15\n\n[edit]\n\nJim Ross [describing Steve Austin’s trip after leaving the arena]: This could be a P.J. Carlesimo situation.\n\nJim Cornette: Who?\n\nVince McMahon: Owen Hart, I know you are here tonight. You've been spotted. Owen Hart, I know you can hear my voice, wherever you may be in this arena. And I must inform you that you've been endangering indeed the safety certainly of our ringside fans with your antics as of late.\n\nJim Cornette: McMahon's turning into Fire Marshall Bill with all this \"fan safety\" business.\n\nVince: You've been crawling over ringside fans coming into the ring interfering in matches with Shawn Michaels. And make no mistake: I don't give a damn about Shawn Michaels – it's just that you're endangering the safety of ringside fans by coming in and coming out. That will not be tolerated. I know you can hear me. I like to remind you, Owen: You are still under contract to the World Wrestling Federation. And as such, I'm ordering you to appear in this ring, right now. [Owen Hart walks to the ring from somewhere in the audience to \"Owen\" chants] What's this all about, and who do you think you are?\n\nOwen Hart: [takes off shades] Who do I think I am? [pokes Vince] Who the HELL do you think you are?! You think I owe you a goddamn apology?! I don't owe you a goddamn thing! I'm sick and tired of trying to please everybody else around here, and the bullshit stops right here!\n\nCornette: Well, that's showing McMahon plenty of respect!\n\nJim Ross: This could get very, very ugly in a hurry.\n\nOwen: Now my brother, Bret, and Neidhart, and Bulldog, they did what they had to do, and now it's time for me to do what I have to do, and that is remain right here in the World Wrestling Federation! [crowd cheers] Now, I spent nine years breaking my back day-after-day to earn a reputation in this company, and nobody, and I mean NOBODY, is going to run me out of this company, and you know EXACTLY who I'm talking about!\n\nVince: Oh yeah, I have a real good idea who you're talking about. You're talking about self-professed \"Showstopper,\" right? You're talking about the Icon, you're talking about the WWF Champion, Shawn Michaels. And isn't that really what it's all about, Owen? Huh? Isn't that what this whole thing's all about? You attempting to gain the only title that's eluded you in your career here? It's all about the WWF Title, isn't it?\n\nOwen: How stupid are you? Is that what you think this is about?! Do you think I give a damn about a worthless title: a piece of leather with tin on it?! This is real life, Vince. This is real life - MY life! MY reputation! MY respect! MY dignity! And McMahon, don't you get me wrong. I'm not ASKING you, I am TELLING you exactly what I am going to do! And that is... and that is make Shawn Michaels' life a living HELL!\n\nRoss: A lot of that going around these days.\n\nCornette: I--I know what you mean!\n\nVince [exasperated]: Let me tell you--\n\nOwen: Listen to me for a second. You can call me the \"Sole Survivor,\" you can call me the \"Black Sheep,\" I really don't give a shit!\n\nRoss: Uh-oh. Not good.\n\nOwen: Shawn Michaels, this is not a game, this is real life, and you started it... and now, it's time for this \"little nugget\" to end it!\n\nRoss: Shawn Michaels is a marked man, and so is Helmsley!\n\nVince: All right, now let me tell you what I'm going to do, Mr. Hart. I believe we have some uniformed security I'd like to ask to come to the ring. [crowd boos] And the reason I'd like to ask for uniformed security, Mr. Hart, is to make sure that, again, we do not endanger the safety of any of our ringside fans, because next week... next week, right here, you're gonna come in to the ring down the ramp like every other WWF superstar, and you're gonna compete in this ring next week just like every other WWF superstar. You're not gonna run over any more ringside fans – all right?!\n\nCornette [as security surrounds Owen]: That's every cop in New Hampshire!\n\nRoss [as Owen approaches Vince]: Look out here. I don't like the look in Owen Hart's eyes. He's been under a tremendous amount of stress.\n\nCornette: Looks like a hungry dog eyeing a steak!\n\nRoss: Owen could snap at any--\n\n[Owen grabs Vince and stares him down]\n\nCornette: Hey!\n\nRoss: Oh, uh-oh!\n\nCornette [as Owen pushes Vince away and Vince motions for security to get Owen out]: Just to prove he can do it! Whatever Shawn Michaels has to say, I'll tell you what: in my opinion, Owen Hart's got some big nuggets! [Owen gets taken out of the arena through the crowd as they chant his name]\n\nVince McMahon: It has been said that anything can happen here in the World Wrestling Federation, but now more than ever, truer words have never been spoken. This is a conscious effort on our part to \"Open the Creative Envelope\", so to speak, in order to entertain you in a more contemporary manner. Even though we call ourselves \"sports entertainment\" because of the athleticism involved, the key word in that phrase is \"entertainment\". The WWF extends far beyond the strict confines of sports presentation into the wide open environment of broad-based entertainment. We borrow from such program niches like soap operas like The Days of our Lives, or music videos such as those on MTV, daytime talk-shows like Jerry Springer and others, cartoons like The King of the Hill on Fox, sitcoms like Seinfeld, and other widely accepted forms of television entertainment. We in the WWF think that you, the audience, are quite frankly tired of having your intelligence insulted. We also think that you're tired of the same old simplistic theory of \"good guys vs. bad guys\". Surely the era of \"The superhero who urge you to say your prayers and take your vitamins\" is definitely passe. Therefore, we've embarked upon a far more innovative and contemporary creative campaign that is far more invigorating and extemporaneous than ever before. However, due to the live nature of Raw and The War Zone, we encourage some degree of parental discretion as it relates to the younger audience allowed to stay up late. Other WWF programs on USA such as Saturday Morning LiveWire and Sunday Morning Superstars, where there is a 40% increase in the younger audience, obviously however need no such discretion. We are responsible television producers who work hard to bring you this outrageous, wacky, wonderful world known as the WWF. Through some 50 years, the World Wrestling Federation has been an entertainment mainstay here in North America and all over the world. One of the reasons for that longevity is as the times have changed, so have we. I am happy to say that this new vibrant, creative direction has resulted in a huge increase in television viewership, for which we thank USA Network and TSN for allowing us to have the creative freedom, but most especially we would like to thank you for watching. Raw and the War Zone are definitely the cure for the common show.\n\nDecember 22\n\n[edit]\n\nJim Ross: Remember, the European Title on the line. Shawn Michaels putting the European Title on the line here, as he will the WWF Title at the Royal Rumble in that much-anticipated casket match with the Undertaker. [Shawn and Hunter lock up and Hunter immediately shoves Shawn down] Collar-and-elbow tie-up.\n\n[Hunter over-dramatically runs the ropes over a supine Shawn for 14 seconds]\n\nJim Cornette: And reluctantly on his part, on both of them. He didn't want to put the title up either.\n\nRoss: Wait a minute. Why is Michaels just lying there?\n\nCornette: Well, why doesn't Helmsley slow down and stop? What is it?\n\nRoss: [catching on] It's a mockery. [Hunter jumps and softly splashes Shawn, hooking his leg] We thought that... oh, here it is.\n\n[Hebner counts to three. Hunter celebrates while Shawn \"cries.\"]\n\nCornette: [over Tony Chimel's announcement] It was a ruse!\n\nTony Chimel: Here is your winner and the new World Wrestling Federation European Champion: \"Triple H\" Hunter Hearst-Helmsley!\n\nCornette: [cont'd] A ploy, a plot, a plan, a charade, a conspiracy, a sham! We've been conned, hoodwinked, bamboozled, flim-flammed, had the wool pulled over our eyes even!\n\nRoss: Slaughter apparently has been watching this on the monitor, we've just been informed, and is on his way to the ring. Helmsley with the European Title. We thought it was gonna be Slaughter's revenge.\n\nCornette: Look at these two jackasses! Michael [sic] cries every time he comes to this town!\n\nDecember 29\n\n[edit]\n\nJim Cornette: Well, the WWF has asked me to do a commentary on the state of wrestling in 1998; I guess they figured, \"Cornette's always good for a couple of laughs.\" Well, I'm not really gonna be too funny tonight. Because you see, I think the state of wrestling in 1998 stinks! I think WCW stinks, I think the nWo stinks, I think ECW is embarrassing, and I think the WWF stinks! And I'll tell you why. You don't have to go back any further than last week on Raw, you got a guy coming out dressed like a Christmas tree, you got a woman dressed like a reindeer, you got two adolescent mulletheads showing their butt cheeks on national TV, and having a phony match for a championship! I think it stinks! I think it's disgusting! I think nobody has any respect for wrestling anymore! Where is \"wrestling\"? Not \"sports entertainment\", but wrestling! You know, just a couple of years ago, I left my home in Tennessee and I moved to Connecticut, which is like trading a Hawaiian vacation for a bed in a cancer ward, to come to work for the WWF full-time, the biggest wrestling promotion in the history of the planet! And I moved to Connecticut with snow on the ground seven months out of the year, real estate prices that would make Donald Trump's hair stand on end, the rudest bunch of people I've ever seen where English is the second language, and traffic jams at four o'clock in the morning! But I think that's OK, because I'm with the biggest wrestling promotion of all time, the WWF! But over the last couple of "
