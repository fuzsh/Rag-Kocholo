        "text": "LIVE from Yokohama for 32 American dollars and some odd cents or something! I bought this PPV because I just cannot get enough wrestling and I want to see Mercedes vs Mayu something fierce, let’s be real. There are other matches I really want to see, too — Giulia vs Tam Nakano, notably, plus Syuri vs Chihiro Hashimoto, Saya Kamitani vs Mina Shirakawa, and so on, I know names, and things — but I probably don’t do this live if not for Mercedes vs Mayu.\n\n(Ko-fi)\n\nYokohama Rumble\n\nThis is a pre-show “Ranbo,” featuring, you know, people. Waka Tsukiyama! Hanako! Koguma! Momo Kohgo! Saya Iida! Lady C! Oh shit Lady C and Hanako are going to have a Big Show vs Kane staredown. Yuna Mizumori! Aya Sakura! Hina! Rina! Hanan! Ram Kaicho! Fukigen Death! Mai Sakurai! Momoe Nakanishi! I think I missed Chanyota somewhere in there. Yeah, I did. The Stardom Machines! I’m not really paying attention to what is happening, in all honesty. Why would I? I had a long work night and got in for this. I’m using the first hour to just “settle in,” as one does. Mai Sakurai wins!\n\nMariah May, Xena, Jessie & Thekla vs Ruaka, Momo Watanabe, Saki Kashima & Natsuko Tora\n\nThekla hanging out with Club Venus somewhat against her will is a good bit. Oedo Tai are still very cool. Again, first hour just about kicking it for me. Thekla jumps off the shoulders of Xena and Mariah May at one point. Club Venus are very amusing, antics-wise they remind me a lot of The Iiconics. Jessie winds up pinned by Saki Kashima after Thekla and Club Venus argue over their strat at one point. Not paying super attention here but it was a fun … quads match, it seemed. Mariah carries a distraught Thekla to the back.\n\nAZM & Mei Suruga vs Starlight Kid & Mei Seira\n\nAZM eats shit on her wings during her entrance, but she’s OK. Suruga and SLK do some cool shit. This is truly “high speed.” The two Meis do cool shit. AZM with a big dive onto the Meis, leaving SLK in the ring, then she gets into it but just gets dragged down to the floor by AZM instead of getting her own dive in. More “high speed”! Suruga having a nice showing here. I think she’s fun, and funny. Seira, wrestling her first match since Aug. 2021, gets the pin on AZM, which should set her right up for a shot at AZM’s High Speed title. She actually had a shot at it back in Dec. 2020, also against AZM, losing in Osaka. 3.5/5\n\nUtami Hayashishita & Miyu Amasaki vs Fuwa-chan & Hazuki\n\nFuwa-chan is some YouChoober turned Stardom superstar who learned dropkicks from Kazuchika Okada. I mean, if you’re gonna learn dropkicks. This is just Fuwa’s second match. In October, she and Hazuki lost to Hina and Saya Kamitani in Tokyo. So I am apparently watching Japanese lady Logan Paul now. Which I think is fine. Is she good? Well. “Good” is a funny idea. You can tell she would like to be. Her Boston crab is not great. Her flying dropkick is OK! She takes elbows from Hayashishita alright enough. This match’s current lack of Hazuki is dreadful, but this is going to be shown on real TV later because of Fuwa-chan, so I do get it. It’s about Fuwa-chan. Fuwa tributes Inoki. Then she takes a side slam in the style of 1996 Hacksaw Jim Duggan. All the greats! Hazuki occasionally cameos in the match to keep Fuwa alive, basically. Fuwa with a bad vertical suplay, the lift is a mess. Then a release German where Utami barely is able to get over. Way more Fuma. I’ve personally seen enough but it is not up to me. Utami drills her with a lariat and bless Fuma she takes a really cool looking bump on that. Basically the match is Fuwa vs Utami and Utami wins with a German suplay. Look it wasn’t good but Fuwa worked extremely hard and did about the best you could realistically hope.\n\nHimeka vs Maika\n\nThis is Himeka’s retirement match against her best friend and tag team partner Maika. The match goes out to the floor quickly, a bit of action there, back in for the big ol’ forearm trades. Running clotheslines in the corner. Nice single leg from Himeka and Maika gets the ropes, screaming in pain, big sell there. Maika clotheslined out of the ring to the floor and Himeka is GOING UP TOP! The dive lands, with Thekla there to get behind them for the safety. Himeka’s fired up, if she’s going now at 25, she’s leaving it all out here. Back in and Himeka is back up top! Maika cuts her off this time. BIG superplex from the second rope, holding it for the delay, landing it clean. Lots of big offense: JP Coaster, Rainmaker from Maika, backdrop driver from Himeka, sit-out power bomb, Maika with an STO and a powerslam. Michinoku Driver II from Maika. Nothing’s getting the pin, so Maika tries to choke Himeka out, but Himeka is able to get a long leg to the rope. Jumbo knee from Himeka! Running power bomb gets two! Michinoku Driver II from Maika again! A third one! Big emotions pouring out from Maika as she delivers more Michinoku Drivers, crying and begging Himeka to kick out so they can keep going. A headbutt, another one, and Maika wins it with tears flowing. Bro, I know I’m tired, but this got me. 4/5\n\nOK here is where I went to bed because I’d been working 12 hours straight right into watching this show, basically. So from her I am watching MORE AWAKE, if my tone shifts and whatnot. Also not watching live anymore.\n\nGoddesses of Stardom Championship\n\nNanae Takahashi & Yuu (c) vs MIRAI & Ami Sourei\n\nAmi and MIRAI try to chop Yuu. Yuu is disinterested. She is very interested in press slamming her opponents to the floor. Yuu is cool. Nanae does chops. Nanae does kicks. Weird match. A lil’ sandbaggy at times from Nanae and Yuu, but also stiff and worked tough and hard.\n\nI really like Mariah May on commentary. She has a sort of effortlessly cool presence and voice, slyly funny and not “doing comedy,” she kind of reminds me of when I was a kid doing backyard wrestling (it was the 90s, man, leave me alone), and we had this one kid who was sort of similar. For instance, once there was a cookie sheet grabbed, and he just deadpanned, “I think he’s gonna hit him with the cookie sheet. Yep. He hit him with the cookie sheet.” It probably doesn’t translate to text.\n\nAnyway, this has a title-changing countout finish, which isn’t necessarily ideal, sure, and the crowd don’t seem into it, and maybe it’s Nanae and Yuu being dicks with the POLITICS, I don’t really know and don’t actually care! It’s an intriguing idea to show that it can happen once out of the 30,000 times it gets teased in title matches. I’m not necessarily arguing it’s the right thing to do, because again, clearly the crowd not into it. But I do think it’s kind of bold, and the crowd thing may be partially the disbelief that the exact same spot didn’t turn out like it always does. 3/5\n\nArtist of Stardom Championship\n\nRisa Sera, Suzu Suzuki & Hiragi Kurumi (c) vs KAIRI, Natsupoi & Saori Anou\n\nAll the “unit” stuff is so laborious to put into text. Club Venus defected from Cosmic Angels recently, and Saori Anou returned to Stardom to join Tam Nakano’s withering CA group. Now we have REstart, a sub-group of Cosmic Angels with KAIRI, Natsupoi, and Saori.\n\nThis starts on the floor, but goes inside pretty quickly, with a kendo stick used. What is this, the Game Changing Wrestlers? Risa does some nasty shit to Natsupoi, just hurling her into the buckle pad with a power bomb. Big dumb corner spot with everyone and Natsupoi tripping the base. Suzu and Anou light each other up, hell yeah. A lot of the story, laid out nicely by Mariah May, is that the Prominence side are very much a team, and the REstart side are still working the kinks out with that. When they do it, they get the advantage. They struggle otherwise. Just proper, classic tag team stuff. But you can see REstart hitting the right notes as the match goes along. KAIRI and Natsupoi do a double dive to the floor, leaving Saori and Suzu in the ring. Suzu hits a German, then another, and Natsupoi is trying to shake them off, but Suzu hits a spin kick to the jaw, only for Anou to hit a bridging German for two. I could watch these two get at it any time, this shit rocks. Saori gets the sudden pin and we have new champs. This is mostly a pretty good match, except the Suzu Suzuki vs Saori Anou parts, which are excellent. 3.5/5\n\nWonder of Stardom Championship\n\nSaya Kamitani (c) vs Mina Shirakawa\n\nKamitani messed Shirakawa’s jaw and teeth up something awful last November because of a Phoenix Splash that went a little awry, and Mina is back once again trying to take her title. It was entirely treated as an accident, and the match’s opening story point is that Kamitani has actually been far more affected by the injury to Shirakawa than Mina herself has, and this even annoys Shirakawa.\n\nKamitani, a confident and long-running champion, gets Mina in position for the Phoenix, hits the Starcrusher set-up and all, and then emotionally freezes up top. This leads to Mina taking over big time, until Kamitani is able to battle big and primal scream herself into going for the Phoenix, hitting, and it not being enough, which also takes its emotional toll on Kamitani.\n\nBut that doesn’t end up being the reason the match turns out the way it does. By that point, the Phoenix fear is overcome, and the story’s real point is clear, that this is Mina Shirakawa’s night, it’s her time, she’s going to the next level, and her determination to win this match and this belt is going to take her there, come hell or high water. Everything Saya throws at Mina is just not enough, and though Kamitani is anything but easy to put away herself, it’s her that breaks first, and Shirakawa gets the three count. This is, in form and all that, Stardom at its best, just the style, the storytelling, and these two wrestlers making a match that is more than the sum of its parts. It’s fantastic, a lot of respect and nobility and shit after the match, Saya strapping Mina up and shaking her hand as she passes the belt to the woman who simply beat her. 4.5/5\n\nKnockout or Submission Match\n\nSyuri vs Chihiro Hashimoto\n\n“Here we have a clash of two women who hate one another, and have full confidence that they are, indeed, the strongest.” I don’t take much more salesmanship than that.\n\nSyuri has a cool way of getting into the ring and showing everyone her styyyyle and the heat that she brings. This is a very straightforward match. A big, badass martial artist fights a big, badass wrestler to see who is the biggest badass. The submission aspect favors Syuri, the knockout submission may favor Hashimoto simply from the impact of her power moves. Both of them have serious heat on their striking. And they just beat the fucking shit out of each other. Chihiro drops Syuri at one point, but Syuri comes back up with a series of horrendous elbow strikes, only for Hashimoto to fire back with her own strikes. Hashimoto goes for a power bomb, Syuri gets her with a guillotine, and Hashimoto counters by suplaying her way out.\n\nThis shit just kicks fucking ass. There is no epic drama in the “we tell stories” sense. They are beating the hell out of one another. Syuri with a thudding, brutal headbutt to the back of Hashimoto’s skull. A buzzsaw kick, learned from trainer Tajiri. Hashimoto down for a count and emotionally trying to get up, making it up at nine — almost. She falls back for the 10 count. Syuri isn’t in much better shape, in all reality. Sheer brutality, violence for the sake of violence, just making a point of it. 4.5/5\n\nIWGP Women’s Championship\n\nMercedes Mone (c) vs Mayu Iwatani\n\nI know “Mone” has an accent mark but I am just not doing that over and over. Mercedes wears a black tiger mask to get into Mayu’s head because Mayu was trained by Tigre Fuka, they insist to me, but I’d guess maybe, you know, Eddie Guerrero’s Black Tiger days.\n\nMercedes’ theme still cracks me up. I genuinely like it at this point but there’s just something funny about it. Well, until it gets to the second part where she’s rapping. Then it’s just funny because it’s quite bad. Starting with the scrapping, Mayu with a PK to the spine, dropkick, then hits the match’s first dive.\n\n“She said, ‘I’m a superstar, I came here to raise the level of competition in Stardom. I’m on ‘The Mandalorian,’ my hair tonight is for my favorite Star Wars character, Darth Maul, that is what Mercedes—”\n\nMariah May: “Her favorite Star Wars character is Darth Maul?”\n\nMercedes takes the advantage, a lot of posing, some Meteoras and the three amigos suplays. Mayu has a crew rooting for her. Mercedes has nobody. In a stunner, Naomi keeps not being part of any of this. Mercedes wants the MoneMaker, doesn’t hit, Mayu with a crucifix bomb for two, and Iwatani takes the momentum there. Mayu with the frog splash for two, but she misses a moonsault and reacts as though she has suddenly been hit with appendicitis. Mayu just sort of beating Mercy Money’s ass, but Mone comes back with an, uh, ambitious maneuver for two. After that, once again the MoneMaker just does not look good. It’s just not a good move. It’s going to look bad way too often, it’s a difficult move for both people to pull off correctly. Mercedes goes for about 116 straight pins. Mercedes talks a lot, they start trading offense, delayed tombstone hits for Mayu.\n\nThere’s a bit of “Roman Reigns in the ThunderDome” to this. If I am not clear, “Roman Reigns in the ThunderDome” is some of my least favorite shit to ever happen in wrestling. This isn’t so bad like that got, but the talking and Acting made me think of it. And then Mayu wins with a dragon suplay to take the belt and end Mercy Money’s reign at 64 days.\n\nI do not think this was “too short” in the context of this show, I just don’t think it was a great match. But what I think doesn’t matter, and anyway, it was good, and I’m certain they have a better one in them. To be totally honest, I think Mercedes’ actual best style in Stardom would be with the High Speed style like she worked with AZM and Hazuki, and not so much this or the KAIRI match. Mercedes has a big lump on her forehead when she comes back at Mayu’s request. Then they do some “goddamn it, I respect you” stuff and Mercedes reveals that actually she’s a nice person. 3/5\n\nWorld of Stardom Championship\n\nGiulia (c) vs Tam Nakano\n\nTAM! TAM! TAM! I am fully in the bag for Tam. This rivalry is fantastic. The tension. The hatred you can feel before they actually start. That stare down in the middle of the ring after the belt photo with Rossy is just pure, silent energy.\n\nSpeaking of tension, there’s a tense start, quiet, grappling about as you do, and then Giulia hits a fuckin’ Northern Lights Bomb suddenly, and we rocket to the next level. Nakano wisely rolls out of the ring because she’s in immediate trouble there, but Giulia sets up a table out on the floor. DDM members hold the table while Giulia sets for a piledriver on it, but Tam gets free. At the moment, Tam is still just trying to recover, not let things get worse, and keep herself away from Giulia. BRUTAL knee from Giulia in the ring, that didn’t even get much reaction but it looked and sounded wicked.\n\nTam does wind up going through the table, snapmared from the top down through it, after she’d turned it around a bit with a lifted sleephold there. Giulia goes for a Glorious Driver on the ramp, but Tam counters with an inverted DDT, getting her distance on the big entrance ramp to get a running start and a strike at the end of it. Reminds me of Tam before a High Speed match some years ago bemoaning how bad her dash time had always been. She hits another one, though. Don’t need to be fast there, anyway.\n\nMariah May continues to do a marvelous job on commentary, laying out the ideas that Giulia and Tam have a rivalry that has made even DDM and Cosmic Angels sort of uneasy, that they don’t really know how to deal with the pure violence and obsession of these two when they’re faced with one another. And they just start absolutely beating the fuck out of one another on the turnbuckles to put an emphasis on that, so it’s also good timing.\n\nThey both fall to the floor. There really is a sort of hush at how personal and ugly the fighting between these two seems. There’s been plenty of hard-hitting action on this show, but these two are just operating on a different wavelength. The aura of their interaction, from the stares to the strikes, is mean. There’s a ruthless ferocity to their strikes. They are just fighting each other, and it’s all with pure hate, true hostility and anger. You look into their eyes and it’s all there, too.\n\nTam with another unbelievably vicious headbutt. The sort of headbutt that becomes uncomfortable even if you’re pretty desensitized. And then Giulia just full on fucking punches Tam in the face. She gets a warning but doesn’t really give a shit.\n\nGiulia goes on a run of big offense trying to end this, but also not not enjoying simply beating Tam up more. Nakano fights back with the Northern Cross submission. You can look at Tam’s face and she’s just swollen and lumping up. The moments where they’re actually doing, like, Wrestling Moves are almost a relief because they aren’t just clubbing each other in the skull.\n\nRight after I type that, Giulia crushes Tam with a big, wound-up, right hand. That one Giulia did just enough to reasonable argue that it was the back of the hand connecting, not the knuckles. She turned the hand just enough before impact. Mariah May’s reaction on commentary is small and sincere, laced with genuine disbelief. The crowd are jeering Giulia a bit on that. She does not care, and she knees Tam in the face. Tam barely gets to the bottom rope before a three count.\n\nAnother Northern Lights Bomb from Giulia, this one has a pin attempt and it only gets two. Another Glorious Driver attempt, Tam blocks even though she’s basically knocked out on her feet at this point. Giulia trying for a super Northern Lights Bomb, Nakano again fighting it off, or at least trying. Giulia instead switches up to a double underhook, trying to take Tam’s arms out of it, but Tam uses her leg strength to block and manages to get free, but runs into a Giulia boot.\n\nBut Nakano will not stop. She has to win. Basically we wind up with a double underhook superplex from Nakano. Tam’s cheekbone where Giulia clocked her with those punches is swollen so badly.\n\nBoth struggle to their feet in opposite corners, then just charge. Tiger suplex from Tam, Giulia kicks at HWAN! Backdrop driver from Giulia! Tam kicks at HWAN! Tiger suplex from Giulia! Northern Lights Bomb from Tam!! Giulia’s out of it! Twilight Dream GETS TWO! The crowd are really getting up now. This has hit third or fourth gear at this point.\n\nTam with the Violent Screwdriver! SHE GOT IT! SHE DID IT! TAM IS THE CHAMPION! TAM IS THE GREATEST WRESTLER IN THE WORLD!"
