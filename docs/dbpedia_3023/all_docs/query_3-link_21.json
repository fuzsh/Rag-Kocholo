Changed Times\n\nWhen I was coming up through undergrad, Wikipedia was still relatively new. It was easier for us than going through having to go to the library and leaf through an encyclopedia. We were always told back then: don’t trust Wikipedia. In an era when Google could still find you useful information, it was reasonable advice, and for those of us who were at college at schools like mine, there were always plenty of books to be had, be they through our own library stacks or the interlibrary loan service.\n\nWikipedia was easily accessible, and anybody, even us college dipshits, could edit it. So we read on, and we wrote on.\n\n20 years later, things are a little different. Google doesn’t find you good information reliably anymore, paper encyclopedias are an increasingly quaint relic, and Wikipedia is still free to edit. But it has evolved a measure of moderation that renders it more reliable by comparison, and it has moderator and administrator oversight that keeps things reasonably cited.\n\nMost of the time.\n\nBack in the day, Wikipedia nonsense could be as inocuous as the people who cited video games on bare bones Japanese history articles, to an article on the Shimabara Uprising that was so wrong it caused an incident at Middlebury College and made news in the New York Times, and then some.\n\nArguably the worst in Wikipedia’s early history was the 2005 Siegenthaler Incident, wherein a then-anonymous editor who thought Wikipedia was a joke site, uploaded an article on journalist and First Amendment advocate John Siegenthaler, claiming he was suspected of involvement in the Kennedy assassinations. This prompted a number of changes on Wikipedia, including the curtailing of unregistered users’ ability to create new articles, and stricter verification standards on the biographies of living people. That was 19 years ago.\n\nI remember these things. I was active on Wikipedia back then. I saw some of these things unfold in realtime.\n\nClearly today, it is not quite so bad.\n\nBut it’s still got places where either sources cited or claims made are just plain wrong. Which brings me to what this all has to do with this podcast and my now delayed for a month episode on the 1739 Genbun no Kurofune incident where Russians first visited Japan in Sendai domain.\n\nII. Words and Choices of Words\n\nI’ve got the next episode mostly drafted, but today I realized that I’d forgotten a really important thing: the Russians didn’t use the Gregorian calendar when these events happened. This may seem obvious, but the fact of the matter is, I’ve spent the last 2 decades flipping back and forth between Japanese lunar and western Gregorian dates, and I haven’t usually dealt with Russian sources in translation that are this old. So I’m taking another week to correct the dates and triple check my citations.\n\nI also know, for instance, that when I say something on this podcast, some of you in listener land out there go out and look for your own information on the subject, and that’s good. The problem is that Wikipedia is high on the list of easily accessible, ready references, and that’s got some constraints of which you might not be aware.\n\nAnd in poking around a bit, sure enough, I found a directly relevant example. As I write this, the current article on Danish-born Imperial Russian Navy officer Martin Spanberg, on whom we’re going to be focusing the next episode, says:\n\n“He charted 30 of the Kurils. On the second voyage, he gained a fourth ship—the Bolsheretsk (Большерецк)—and was the first Russian commander to visit Honshu in Japan, establishing Russo-Japanese diplomatic relations.”\n\nWhich on its face, sounds impressive– not only did Spanberg visit Japan during the Bering expeditions, he established Russo-Japanese diplomatic relations! This cites pages 35 to 37 of Glynn Barratt’s Russia in the Pacific, except there’s one small problem: Barratt doesn’t say this. And in the first place, Spanberg did no such thing.\n\nHow do I know this? Because the Treaty of Shimoda, signed by Vice Admiral Yevfimy Vasil’evich Putyatin, established those relations when it was signed on February 7, 1855, two years after the Perry mission first arrived at Uraga and forced the beginning of the modern era of Japan as a country actually, properly, for real, open to the world.\n\nIn the second place, Barratt says that Spanberg was charged not with diplomacy but cartography of the sea approaches to Japan. Quoting Barratt:\n\n“Spanberg was entrusted with the survey of the Kurile Island chain south to Japan (Hokkaido) and with the study of Japan itself. If any Kurile Islanders would pay him iasak and acknowledge Russian sovereignty, that was excellent; however, he was not to pass his time extorting iasak from the hostile or independent-minded, but to chart the sea approaches to Japan with some precision.”\n\nYes, this mentions the “would be nice to have” fealty of the Kurile Island natives, who were mostly the Ainu people. Nowhere is anything said of diplomacy with Japan.\n\nThird of all, Spanberg only ever met a handful of Sendai domain officials when he was on and around Aji Island in Sendai Bay, and none of those officials were in a position to be making treaties for the entire country. That was the Shogunate’s purview, and the domains didn’t dare directly threaten the Shogunate’s prerogatives like that.\n\nSo Wikipedia still has some issues, and it pays to be skeptical and diligent, even as readers.\n\nSpanberg was responsible for the first Russo-Japanese interaction on Japanese soil. This is true.\n\nSpanberg met with Sendai domain officials, who were Japanese and political officials. This is also true.\n\nBut they didn’t sign anything, and in the end, again, Spanberg wasn’t there for forcing diplomacy or anything more than reprovisioning as he was pursuing his mission of cartography. And none of this is the same as Japan and Russia establishing diplomatic relations.\n\nWe need to understand that difference.\n\nIII. Dates and How they Differ\n\nSpeaking of skeptical and diligent: as noted above, I’ve been delayed for a month now on the next episode, the one on Vitus Bering and Martin Spanberg. Having lost July to my partner’s COVID, and having caught that date conversion issue mentioned earlier, I want to be absolutely sure I can give you the best possible product rather than rushing unnecessarily.\n\nThe other part of the problem is that the more I dig, the more the chronology I had seems a little muddied. This is in part the result of Spanberg having had 3 ships, which got separated several times during this mission, and which went back and forth along their course. So I’m going to try and nail that down a little better, too.\n\nFinally, there’s a bit of reading I just today realized I was missing, on the Sendai domain side of this story. You’ll see why, when the finished product hits the airwaves.\n\nIn the meantime: I will see you next week.\n\nSources\n\nGlynn Barratt.

Accessed 8 August 2024.\n\nIt’s been awhile since the first installment of this series, and lately I’ve felt that it’s high time for me to pick it up again, because there are questions with which I’ve grappled, since the first installment went live.\n\nIt’s hard to explain what exactly I am, when what I am is something that the average person probably hasn’t heard of. But there are labels, umbrellas and niches, to which I belong, as do others like me. Even if these are new concepts to the average person, they are nonetheless valid, and by using them and talking about them, we can broaden awareness and encourage understanding. I’m standing on the shoulders of giants as I do so, amidst my hope of helping others like me in turn.\n\nSo, let’s talk about labels, about which ones are mine, about the things that are, and the things that may yet be.\n\nOne: Nesting Categories\n\nThere are any number of broad labels that might apply to someone in my situation for whom, as a friend put it, the specific expression of my identity would require entirely or mostly prosthetic bodies to achieve. Transhuman and alterhuman are two of them. I’ve seen these applied extremely broadly, applying to everything from a cybernetic being like me, to people who consider themselves therian– animals in human form. So it works, but it is clunky, and over the past year I’ve felt I need something a little more closely fitting. “Doll” is the very specific term I’ve adopted, and a combat doll at that, to be more precise. I’ve explained it in some depth in Part 1 of this series. Here’s a link if you haven’t read that yet— please go read that first so that this makes more sense, if this is all new to you.\n\nBut what is the category into which that nests best? I’ve thought a lot about this, in the year since I first thought to write about what this all means to me. Being visible as a combat doll, especially in public events like Anthrocon, has prompted curiosity and delight from strangers and from some who are like me, relief to see one of their own, just living her life.\n\nSo what, then, is the word I’m looking for?\n\nTwo: Old Spirit, New Language\n\nAltersex.\n\nThe word is altersex.\n\nIs it a sex (as in fucking) thing? Not really. Alright, then what is this? Where can you read more about it?\n\nWell, it’s a term that’s still relatively new in common usage, having originated in July 2015 as a term for describing characters that have “body plans that are a mix of things, rather than the usually-found configurations.” It was not originally intended for use by real-world people, but evolved to encompass them. An altersex person is someone whose physical expression of identity– including primary, secondary, and/or tertiary sex characteristics– is something other than found in nature.\n\nYour humble author, a combat doll who wrote an entire novel in the name of figuring out her identity, most definitely fits into that category, and I’ll say more on that below.\n\nYes, the word “sex” is in the name. No, this isn’t just about genitalia, though that can be in there if an individual so chooses. It’s about bodies overall, about their features, about their composition, their color. It’s about– to use the term that some combat dolls like me use– the preferred and ideal arrangement of the chassis.\n\nSo is this concept new overall, even if the term is, as I write this, barely a decade old?\n\nWell, not really.\n\nIt is a new term, yes, but one that’s emerged in order to make different, more specific ideas and identities– like combat doll– more comprehensible and cross-compatible. Another term that nests within this category is salmacian– an altersex person with a desire for a mixed genital set, named for Salmacis, a Greek nymph who had such a body. Like “lesbian,” it’s a label with an etymology that evokes antiquity.\n\nOur binaries in the modern day west, be they of gender, sex, or any number of other things, are the result of centuries of genocide and erasure of identities like this. Thus, in that context, altersex and the other new, inventive, and poetic ways for articulating our diversity, is some of that beautiful diversity reasserting itself via a new vocabulary.\n\nAnd thank gods for that.\n\nThree: The Doll Defines Herself\n\nBut aren’t you a binary trans woman? you may well ask, as well you may.\n\nYes, that is my gender identity. And yet, integral to my ideal expression of identity in body includes colorful sleeves, seam lines and servos, a heads-up projection over my field of vision, and clearly artificial hair color and bustline. Some of that I can have, some I can acquire, some I cannot have at all given the current state of technology and medical science. All of the above are not things that human bodies naturally possess.\n\nSo I am, in a word, altersex. These things are how it’s supposed to be, for me. This is how it’s supposed to look.\n\nTo speak most simply, I can point to my hair. My hair is one way I like to express who I am– in style, and in color. I’ve tried dark hair and it isn’t my usual taste. I’ve tried short hair and it’s actively dysphoria inducing. So I wear my hair long– thanks to the wonderful work of the wig makers of Arda Wigs USA– and I wear it a permanent bright blue that isn’t this reliably possible with dyed natural hair.\n\nThe long, bright blue hair is one way I say this is me. This is not an affectation, it is me. Were I able to grow my own hair, I might be able to undercut it, as I wish I could. But I would have to be aggressive about dyeing it, and it would never be quite this blue, a color so important even when it pertains to my spirituality. Were restoration of my hair possible, I would take it, but were it possible to modify myself to grow hair in this color, I would also do it. Perhaps one day that will be possible.\n\nSo in the meantime, I use the means at my disposal to have that color in the here and now.\n\nI likewise have plans for tattoo sleeves that are floral and colorful, but are framed with seam lines that indicate access panels and points of articulation where mine ought to be. Tattoos are often seen as cosmetic, but many people, myself included, see them as an important part of expressing ourselves. But tattoos are expensive, so these days, I make do by drawing those seam lines on with waterproof eyeliner or tattoo markers.\n\nI wasn’t quite sure how I’d react, the first time I did that. But when I did– haphazardly and backhanded with Sharpie– I remember sitting there and crying in relief. This is how it’s supposed to be. This is how it’s supposed to look.\n\nIt is well known by now, likewise, that I’ve got plans for extra-large breast implants, a process that will require at least two procedures. A friend very kindly sent me her old forms meant to simulate the minimum size for which I’m hoping. Again, I wasn’t sure what to expect, but I was smiling ear to ear even as I was sobbing in relief, when I looked in the mirror.\n\nThis is how it’s supposed to be. This is how it’s supposed to look.\n\nThis is why I point to River M59A1 and say that her story in Confluence and One Heart Together, her way of being, the contours of her body, the ways she expresses the fullness of her identity in its physical manifestation, are the truest things I’ve ever written about myself. More than a character I invented, she is what I would be, in a world that was somewhat more technologically advanced and allowed me to be myself more fully in body.\n\nFour: The Things that May Yet Be\n\nThe Apple Vision Pro debuted last year to much fanfare and lampooning. “Those dorks with the giant ski goggles,” every late night talk show host seemed to say. “Why bother?”\n\nAnd while I agreed with the jokes about the giant bizarre goggles, it was seeing videos of the interface that made me weep in joy, at people manipulating heads-up displays projected over their field of vision with nothing but their bare hands and fingertips. This is how I’ve always felt my own field of vision ought to look, though I have reservations about wearing ski goggles over my head. So, inasmuch as I’m not going to be in a rush to buy and wear the Vision Pro because I have qualms about Apple and the technology is in its infancy, it is nevertheless on the way.\n\nThis is how it’s supposed to be, I said, replaying the footage for the umpteenth time, reaching out my hand, the ghost of what should be just beyond my sight. This is how it’s supposed to look.\n\nSo I take comfort in the things that may yet be, but I know also that who I am is valid and has substance in the here and now, regardless.\n\nEven now, I am who I am regardless of medical science or technology. And in an age when so much seems so dark, I intend through audacity to clear the way and light a path.\n\nEven now, I am a combat doll– even now, I am altersex.\n\nSources\n\n“Altersex.” LGBTQIA+ Wiki.

Indeed, this is not a story told in one piece, either, but rather several pieces.\n\nBut seriously, folks. Let’s start from the Tamura family.\n\nThe Tamura family is a very old and very blue-blooded local elite family of northern Honshu. It claims descent from Sakanoue no Tamuramaro, the 9th century imperial general who led long, costly campaigns in the north that only partially succeeded in conquest, but which left a long trail of legends that survive even today. I should underline however that this origin of the Tamura family is not confirmed but rather claimed– either way, it’s the story the family tells itself about its own roots. Those who are familiar with the life of Date Masamune might recognize it as the birth family of his wife, Tamura Mego, daughter of Miharu Castle lord Tamura Kiyoaki. For those familiar on that level, it’s usually understood that the Tamura line briefly died out, before being reestablished at Lady Mego’s behest later in the 17th century, with one of her grandsons becoming the inheritor of the Tamura lineage and name. The reestablished Tamura family became daimyo of Ichinoseki domain, which is a curious case of a domain that both was and wasn’t independent, and whose daimyo owed two sets of alternate attendance obligations– one to the shogun, the other to the Date daimyo. But I’m getting off-track here.\n\nThe thing about the Tamura family is that it didn’t die out, and thus we get to Tamura Osaru– Osaru, written “boy monkey”– the subject of today’s episode. Born in the Shiroishi castle town, he was raised in Sendai Castle by the request of his aunt, Lady Mego. But we need to explain why it is that the Tamura line didn’t actually end with Mego but also wasn’t in a position to continue via primogeniture. This might get a little confusing, as noble families lineages tend to be anywhere in the world, so check out the blogpost for a graphic depicting the relations that’s going to follow this point in the script. With that said, here goes.\n\nMego’s father Kiyoaki adopted a nephew, Muneaki, who inherited Tamura headship. But as we’ve seen in recent weeks, Toyotomi Hideyoshi in 1590 either affirming or denying landholdings of local lords in the Tohoku region cut both ways, and the Tamura were just one local lordly family that lost its holdings after Hideyoshi issued his settlement for the north. We saw another case of it recently, in the Waga and Hienuki families, who Masamune tried to coopt in making a grab for territory north of his northernmost border. After Hideyoshi’s orders stripped him of his domain and income, Tamura Muneaki changed his name to Ushikubi Sadaaki, and lived in Shiroishi under the care of the Katakura family, who were high level Date vassals and held the one on-the-record extra castle the Shogunate allowed Sendai domain to possess.\n\n“Ushikubi” is a pretty Monty Python worthy name, as you can interpret it as meaning “Cowstrangler.” This Ushikubi Sadaaki, living somewhat incognito compared to his prior status, had two sons, Sadahiro and Osaru. By then, Sendai domain was secure and it was the early Edo period, and so they were cared for directly by their aunt and uncle, which is why Osaru, born in 1614, was raised in Sendai Castle and was named Osaru by his aunt.\n\nIn 1627, by Masamune’s order, Osaru and his brother Sadahiro succeeded not to the Tamura name but the Katakura name. This was not of the main Katakura line, who were the Sendai retainers who held Shiroishi Castle whose town was where the two brothers were born, but of Masamune’s wetnurse Katakura Kita. Thus, Tamura Osaru became Katakura San’emon– alias Katakura Yoshitane– and headed a separate lineage of the Katakura name under the auspices of the Katakura castellan of Shiroishi.\n\nHunting, Beating, and Frighteningly Deadly Skills\n\nStarting in the days of second generation Sendai daimyo Date Tadamune, Yoshitane was a frequent companion on lordly hunting trips. As we’ve said on the podcast many times before, hunting trips during the Edo period weren’t just because hunting– usually involving trained hunting birds– was a mark of lordly culture and daimyo wanted to keep up appearances. It was also a way of disguising military exercises in a socially acceptable way that didn’t violate the letter of the Shogunate’s law. During Masamune’s reign, Sendai domain developed an extensive network of hunting grounds both in the domain and in the vicinity of Edo, a regular rotation of hunting at these locations, and its hunting birds were said to eat better than the humans assigned to care for them. In short, the Date family took hunting– and the things that were disguised as hunting– seriously.\n\nYoshitane was by this point an experienced hunter and leader of hunting parties to the point of seeming to accomplish impossibly large kill counts during these lordly trips. Leading parties of beaters numbering in the thousands– beaters are people that drive the hunted animals out of cover by making loud noises with sticks or other tools– he would net a couple thousand deer at a time, and on one occasion even as many as three thousand. We know this because Yoshitane set up monuments to honor the spirits of the deer he took in these hunts, and they survive in that part of Miyagi Prefecture even today.\n\nThe Origins of Aoba-ryū matagi technique\n\nBy Tadamune’s order, Yoshitane’s hunting skill was acknowledged, and he was named as the head of Sendai domain’s official tradition of matagi techniques– Aoba-ryū, the Aoba tradition, after the new castle in Sendai where Osaru was raised.\n\nNow here’s where we have to sidebar again.\n\nLast week we talked in general about matagi as both a community and a loosely grouped set of hunting techniques and beliefs in northern Honshu that first emerged from the long, long contact of Yamato settlers and Emishi locals as the north was brought into the empire but remained “inside yet outside.” Yes, this is centuries after that, in the 17th century, and not only that, it’s a matagi tradition that’s established by order of the north’s preeminent political power in that era. But if we read between the lines, I think we might surmise that Yoshitane picked up at least some of these techniques as a result of paying attention to how hunters already operating in Sendai domain hunted, in his younger years. Yoshitane was known for having a deep understanding of the domain’s terrain far beyond what someone of his status usually possessed– he had to have learned that from somewhere. We must also remember that the Date daimyo, starting from Masamune, saw themselves as heirs to the mantle of northern primacy that had once rested with the Northern Fujiwara and their Emishi forbears. So yes, it’s a bit latter-day, this Aoba tradition, and it had the backing of a major domain, but it doesn’t come out of nowhere and it isn’t just because of one man’s extreme hunting skills.\n\nAoba-ryū survived the Boshin War, but is no longer extant. Today, most matagi live not in Miyagi but in nearby Akita Prefecture.\n\nEpilogue: Between the Rivers\n\nAccording to the inscription on his grave in Shiroishi, Katakura Yoshitane– alias Tamura Osaru– died in 1712 at 98 years of age, during the reign of 7th shogun Tokugawa Ietsugu and 5th generation Sendai daimyo Date Yoshimura. He is buried beside his brother Sadahiro. In a hunting career spanning five generations of Sendai daimyo and even surviving the tumult that was the fractious Date clan of the late 17th century– the period that gave us the kabuki plays based on that discord– Yoshitane had amassed thousands and thousands of deer, serow, bears, and even wolves as kills. His descendants continued in Date service through 1871, albeit as rear-vassals– they were retainers of the Katakura family of Shiroishi, rather than drawing their income from the Date daimyo himself.\n\nBut there’s a curious postscript to this story.\n\nJapan’s 11th ambassador to Iraq, who held the office during the Gulf War, was the last Japanese ambassador in Baghdad until diplomatic relations were resumed the early 2000s. He and his wife were an authorial team, and wrote a great deal about Japanese perspectives on the Islamic world. As I write this, he’s still alive today, and is in his 90s. Who was this man who undertook such a job amidst times that were more and more full of long odds?\n\nHe is Tamura Osaru’s male-line descendant, Katakura Kunio.\n\nSources\n\nKobayashi Seiji.

The events are graphic, awful, and only a small glimpse into the hell that was Mamuret ul Aziz vilayet from 1915 to 1918 at the hands of the Young Turks who led the Ottoman government. But to quote the closing words of the piece, it was written lest we forget, and I felt it my duty to translate, annotate, and release to the English speaking world. I will explain why in the historical essay that follows.\n\nThe article, one of many by the author, appeared in the Boston-based Hairenik newspaper, Vol. LVIII, no. 13,569, on Friday, 7 December 1956, nearly 40 years after the events it describes. Bear that in mind as you read, for that, too, is its own victory.\n\n“The Closure of the American Consulate in Kharpert: Lest We Forget”\n\nOn Sunday mornings, before first light, we would carefully slip out of Mezire to the killing fields. The wind would bring to our nostrils the stench of decaying bodies. That day there were five of us on horseback– two cavasses, me, Dr. Atkinson, and consul Davis. In the forest from a distance we noticed a hanged man, and directed our horses in that direction. Before our eyes appeared a horrifying sight. In that killing field the butchers had enacted all the types of murder, on more than fifty Armenian men, some of them hanged, some of them butchered like sheep, some of them burned, others dismembered with axes, others they’d strangled with rope and water, and they’d dug out the eyes of many. After photographing all of this carefully, we descended into the valley. There we saw about three hundred bodies, which were half buried in the sand after the flooding rains. After that we went to the other side, to the nearby village, and came upon an elderly Turkish man.\n\nDr. Atkinson asked, “Old man, who killed this many people?” the old man said “Don’t ask, efendi, don’t ask, the police brought the infidels here, those poor women and children, and confined them in that valley hungry and thirsty, they shot anyone who tried to escape, and after keeping them there for days, most of them died. The police didn’t wait for all of them to die– they came to our village, beat us, and drove us out of our homes, insisting that we go and kill those who still lived. The village didn’t have any men apart from us elders, all had gone to be soldiers. The women, the children, the boys, we all armed ourselves with scythes and axes and boards. The scene was awful, those who were still alive were so worn and sick that with arms outstretched they begged us for a quick death. I killed six women with my own hands. Those poor souls’ pleading won’t leave my ears. My life’s end is close, and how shall I stand before Allah to give account of my life with my hands so bloodied?”\n\nWe’d given word to the governor about that inspection trip. He called me to the serail and said “I heard the consul leaves the city and takes pictures despite it being strictly forbidden. Because of the war, the country’s safety is shaky, and on the mountains there are many deserters from the Army as well as Armenian fedayi, and if anything happens to the consul’s life, I am not responsible. In times like these, you must not leave the city to go sightseeing.” I notified the consul of that veiled threat, and after that we never left much.\n\nCorps commander Mehmed Wehbi bey spoke French with the consul. One day during a visit he expressed an interest in learning English. The consul took every opportunity to win the friendship of the highest Turkish officials, and told him ‘my interpreter is an able teacher and will gladly teach you twice a week.’ Without informing me, they decided on Tuesdays and Thursdays at 8 PM. At that time a soldier with a lantern was to come to the consulate and escort me to Wehbi bey’s quarters, and after lessons the same soldier was to return me to the consulate.\n\nI told the consul that this might be a plot against my life, and it might be that one evening they take me and don’t bring me back. The consul laughed at my idea and said that that kind of ingratitude of asking for a teacher and then taking them to be slaughtered was unthinkable and impossible. But it seems that he too felt that that might happen, because until he heard my voice on return, he would not go to bed.\n\nAfter two or three lessons I would find [Wehbi bey] before the table laid out with a mixed rakhi drink and snacks, his head hot [with drink] and not in a frame of mind to learn. We would speak of all manner of topics, and this continued for some months and we became friendly.\n\nIn his drunk state, he would give me news from the battlefronts that was the sort that I clearly knew were military secrets. He would show me telegrams. I was afraid that these were traps to arrest me at gunpoint, but this did not happen.\n\nOn Sunday, 3 May 1917, I sat alone in the consulate’s garden, the bloody scenes of massacre playing out in my mind like a film. Somehow the starry flag flying from atop the consulate building caught my eye, fluttering against the spring wind. I wondered if someday I’d be able to pass through this valley of the shadow of death, and reunite with my family– my two young boys and my elderly father and mother who because of their trade had escaped the slaughter and eagerly awaited my return to my birthplace of Marsovan.\n\nI, as eyewitness to slaughter and ruin, knew these animals by their names and their crimes and I could point to them personally on the Day of Judgment. But I also called to mind the famous Turkish maxim that says “A severed head tells no secrets.”\n\nI was convinced the Ittihad-ve-Terraki would not leave me alive; my only hope and shelter was American protection. I wanted to live by that faith that immediately after this terrible slaughter would dawn the sun of the Armenian nation’s freedom. Someone who’s seen thousands of dead bodies has a strange feeling, an inexplicable mental state, death doesn’t cause much fear anymore, it brings an indifference to you. You accept that these dead had no less reason to live than you do.\n\nLetters from our embassy in Istanbul started to grow increasingly delayed, and in those that arrived there seemed to be a mood of ill portent, a meaning one might guess. While I was lost in these thoughts, someone banged strongly on the door. I went and opened it personally. The Lord Commissar Ahmed strood before me, straightened himself out, and said “America has declared war against our powerful ally Germany, the Ottoman government has severed ties with America. The governor demands that you immediately take that flag down” and left.\n\nI hurried to tell the consul of this news. Mr. Davis was taken by surprise, and internal employee Mr. Garabed Bedrosian, myself, and the consul went out to the balcony and from its staff lowered the flag and, kissing it tenderly, folded it and stowed it in its tin case, and removed the coat of arms from the outer door. I felt we were lost already, it was like the axe had fallen on my neck. At that moment I remembered one of my students at the imperial high school who announced that he wanted to personally sever my neck. The next week, Morgenthau’s secret order arrived, by which he notified us that the minister of internal affairs has allowed that the consulate with all its employees, as well as all American citizens, were allowed to come to Istanbul. For our safety would be provided policemen. Get going as soon as you can, burn all writings that are damaging to the Turkish state and people, destroy the consulate’s seal, lock the building and give the key to the governor. Those orders brought me great hope.\n\nThat week, the governor was dismissed from his post. Corps commander Mehmed Wehbi bey was chosen as interim governor. I immediately made a list of our employees, the missionaries, and a few Armenian women who were US citizens and gave it to my student, Wehbi bey, and he was very happy and congratulated me on my upcoming trip to Istanbul. He called the police chief and ordered that documents be prepared for everyone on my list and give them to me at once. The hour was already late, and the police said come tomorrow to receive the documents. That night, Ali Ihsan bey, the new governor, arrived from Istanbul. The police chief showed him my list, and the governor struck out every name that ended in “ian.” I was again caught in a trap.\n\nThat entire night I burned all the damaging papers in the consulate’s washroom and destroyed the consulate’s seal. the governor did not accept the consulate’s keys. On the 16th of May, the preparations for the trip were complete. Exhausted, I fell into bed, and suffered sleepless until 3 AM, when I saw a dream that has never left me. In my dream, I found myself in Cairo where I had an honorable friend named Toros Torosian, and I was in his shop. I embraced him and in my relief I shouted, “Toros agha, congratulate me, I quickly escaped death! Congratulate me!” But my joy did not last. The cavass [Garabed Bedrosian] came into my bedroom to wake me.\n\nThe dark clouds engulfed my soul on 17 May 1917. The missionaries came from the upper city, all of them on horseback, and there came also 12 police, and departed shortly thereafter. There were two of us hopeless Armenians there, I held the right stirrup of Consul Davis’s horse, Mr. Garabed held the left stirrup, with the Americans following behind us. We passed in front of the serail and walked until Khan Springs. The police made us all stand there and carefully inspected the names, and sent us two Armenians back toward Mezire.\n\nUtterly spent and hopeless I fell to the ground, and the consul and his entourage soon passed from our sight. I wanted to resign myself to my fate and end my miserable life, but Mr. Garabed did not allow me, he took me to his home and encouraged me.\n\nIn those days, there was a big typhus epidemic in Mezire. Mr. Ehmann’s interpreter and the director of the orphanage, Mr. Haroutune Dikijian, had died 3 days after getting infected. Mr. Ehmann called me to his service and I moved to the Germans’ building.\n\nLest we forget.\n\nSome Historical Context and A Few Remarks from a Descendant\n\nI am a historian of Japan by training, but the source translated above has commanded my attention because it intersects with my own history, and involves historical figures that might not be world-famous but are nonetheless significant to my people’s darkest chapter. As such, I’d like to offer a few remarks to contextualize some of the above.\n\nHaroutune Pekmezian (1880?-1960) was my great grandfather. He was clerk and interpreter to Mezire-based US consul Leslie A. Davis, during the years of the Armenian Genocide. (For those unfamiliar, Mezire was the lower, newer city; Kharpert was the older, upper city, Husenig was the community just to the east of Mezire; all are shorthanded by Armenians today as “Kharpert” and form the modern city of Elazig)\n\nHe saw some deeply heinous, unspeakable things, and nearly gave up on life, yet amidst it all he never let go of his humanity. Even here, with a price on his head, he was still trying his best to do the work to survive and help others survive, too. What’s more, his grief for his Turkish neighbors– coerced into complicity in genocide by their government’s army– is also palpable.\n\nThough he died long before I was born, I have heard from elders who knew him that aside from brave, he was strong-willed to the point that he didn’t care what people thought of him. Amusingly, one elder remembers him as having sung along to movies in the theater. He was writing practically until the day he died. He liked York Peppermint Patties. He remained forever haunted by what he saw, but the more important thing is, he lived and saw his children and grandchildren live. And now here am I, having translated his words, further embodiment of his victory. A worthy legacy for a man whose name means “resurrection.”\n\nWehib bey— better known as Wehib Pasha (1877-1940), was an Ottoman Army general. A year after the events covered in the close of this article, he commanded the Ottoman forces at the Battle of Sardarabad, where he was defeated by an Armenian army led by Movses Silikyan and Tovmas Nazarbekian. An outspoken critic of the Young Turk regime’s genocide of the Armenians, he was later rendered stateless by the Kemalist government– and Wehib Pasha himself despised Kemal. He commanded Ethiopian forces against the Italian fascists in the 1930s. Wehib Pasha returned to Turkey shortly before his death in 1940.\n\nWhile he decried the genocide, and today is one of the important eyewitnesses cited by historians, he was still a high Turkish official and my great grandfather’s discomfort at being forced to be friendly with him is, I think, entirely understandable.\n\nAli Ihsan bey— better known as Ali İhsan Pasha (1882-1957)– was likewise an Ottoman Army officer and high government official. He commanded the VI Corps during the fighting in Iraq against the British. He was notorious for having ordered the deaths of many Armenians, and claimed to have killed some with his own hands. He also claimed to have been personally responsible for the deaths of half a million Armenians.\n\nEven in his brief appearance in my great grandfather’s writing, Ali Ihsan Pasha’s meticulous attention to dispossessing and murdering Armenians– even those who were American citizens– is clear.\n\nDr. Henry Herbert Atkinson (1870-1915) was an American physician and missionary active in Kharpert in those years. We see him in the beginning of the article, documenting the slaughter together with my great grandfather and Mr. Davis. Atkinson’s wife Tacy’s diary of the Genocide years, underlining German complicity, is aptly titled “The German, the Turk and the devil made a triple alliance.” Dr. Atkinson died in 1915 of typhus during the epidemic in Kharpert, as did many of the Armenians he struggled to save.\n\nGarabed Bedrosian (1883-1977) was the cavass– the bodyguard– of the American consulate from 1905 to 1917. Leading a convoy of orphans out of Kharpert in 1922 to Syria, he eventually settled in Fresno and lived a long, full life as a farmer and lay leader of the Armenian Brethren Church. It is because of his words lifting my great grandfather out of suicidal despair that I exist today. If his descendants should read this, I want them to know that my family is in their debt, and that I hope they have made as much of the “dawn[ing] the sun of the Armenian nation’s freedom” as we have.\n\nAnd finally, Leslie A. Davis (1876-1960) was the American consul for whom my great grandfather worked. A New Yorker by birth, he was first a lawyer and later a career diplomat.\n\nWorking in Kharpert was especially remote for a US diplomatic posting, but Davis saved as many lives as he could, documented as much as he could, and continued to do his best to help Armenians long after his assignment to Kharpert ended. His reports are usually cited together with those of his superior on that diplomatic mission, Istanbul-based Ambassador Henry Morgenthau.\n\nHis report on the Genocide in Kharpert is aptly, and starkly, titled The Slaughterhouse Province.\n\nI would like to close these remarks by making an observation. Lake Dzovk– which the Turks now call Lake Hazar– was one of the places in the “Slaughterhouse Province” where the Ottoman state piled the bodies of the dead high.\n\nBut it was not always so.\n\nTime was that Lake Dzovk was where the local population, Armenians included, went there for picnicking, swimming, and boating. Time was, Armenians, Turks, Greeks, Assyrians, Kurds, all were neighbors. In my view, we Armenians especially do a grave disservice to the past if our image of Lake Dzovk is forever stuck in 1915 and the mountains of dead.\n\nIt was not always like this, in a land where government fiat still dictates silence, denial, and erasure of any trace of the indigenous population.\n\nIt was not always like this. It does not have to stay like this.\n\nSo it behooves us to remember what was, before– in Turkish poet Nazim Hikmet’s words– the Young Turks “smeared this black stain on the forehead of the Turkish people.” We can fight for what can yet be, in the name of the liberation of all of Anatolia’s children, including Armenians and Turks. We can tear down the walls of silence and denial that hurt us all.\n\nIf only we fight for it, for the sun on Lake Dzovk, then we, too, can have resurrection.\n\nSources\n\nTaner Akçam.

Unlike the court’s conquest and annexation of southern Kyushu, in one scholar’s words it remained “inside but outside” the rest of the empire. One especially visible reminder of this is that the names given to the two massive provinces the empire created, Mutsu and Dewa, survived until 1871. Because of how the empire expanded its early claim in the north, local elites among the Emishi peoples– I say peoples because we don’t know if they were one people or many– cemented their status. The empire opted for what had seemed an efficient course of action by simply keeping local elites in place and putting them in charge of newly created districts or counties in that area. This backfired, and cemented the development of strong regional semiautonomy which merged Emishi authority with Yamato authority and began a tradition that survived in political form through 1868 and in some cultural forms still survives today.\n\nDespite this imperfect and ultimately failed attempt at completely subduing local autonomy, another part of how the court expanded its reach was by gradually northward advancing frontier settlement via a campaign of armed colonization beginning from the turn of the 8th century. The settler-soldiers in this project initially numbered 6,000, the number peaked at 10,000 in 768; by the late 9th century it settled at around 8,000. And together with that settlement, there was a tense cultural exchange that necessarily followed with the non-Yamato peoples to the north, in practices, in beliefs, and in language.\n\nOne of the byproducts of this was the emergence of the mountain hunting communities called matagi, which are attested from the late Heian era (1180s). And as ever with these things, say it with me now, it’s complicated.\n\nTwo: Symbiosis\n\nFirst, let’s understand who matagi are. The matagi are a community of hunters who share loosely connected language, beliefs, and practices. They were historically spread broadly across northern Honshu in the Tohoku region and Niigata Prefecture in the adjoining Hokuriku region. Today, though, most of the surviving matagi communities are in Akita Prefecture. “Matagi” is just the most common term for them– different parts of the region had slightly different names for them.\n\nBear, deer, and serow– and now more often specifically bear, as the serow is protected– are the animals they usually hunt. There are different traditions of hunting techniques for matagi– we’ll be talking about Aoba-ryu, the matagi tradition in Sendai domain, next week. But whatever the particular tradition, the matagi exist in a symbiosis with the terrain and the animals they hunt, which they usually hunt in wintertime. They use rifles today, but also a traditional tool called a nagasa, which is a kind of utility knife with a hollow handle for ease of attaching to a pole and turning into a spear. A regular companion on these trips would be Akita dogs, which if you’re not familiar are sort of like if a Shiba inu– you know, like the doge meme– were taller. The Akita dogs are still known for having been the preferred canine colleagues of the matagi. You might not know the Akita dogs as a breed, but you might know the name of Hachikō, the loyal dog who waited at Ueno Station for his deceased human and is now commemorated by a statue there– Hachikō was an Akita-born Akita dog.\n\nTo get a visual sense of matagi and their methods and equipment today, check out the video in the blogpost version of this episode– it’s short, but if you’ve never seen modern matagi before, I think it’s a good introduction.\n\nThe matagi also have their own spirituality focused on the animals they hunted, showing them respect by wasting none of their bodies, and reaffirming their interconnection. To me, as a Shintoist, this sense of interconnection is familiar– we believe that everyone and everything is a part of Great Nature (daishizen). But the matagi also have their own dialect of Japanese, which shares some cognates with Aynu-itak, the language of the Ainu people. But weren’t we talking about Emishi? Ah, but stay with me– here is where it gets especially interesting and tells us something about regional interconnection.\n\nThree: The Emishi, the Matagi, and the Ainu\n\nWe need to begin by understanding a point of interconnectedness in the region– or reiterating it, since on this podcast it comes up so much. The polity ruled from Hiraizumi by the Northern Fujiwara had trade networks that connected it not only to the Yamato state to the south, but to mainland Asia to the west and to what today is called Hokkaido and the Kuriles, to the north. Indeed, the Northern Fujiwara were called by one 20th century author “lords of the sea,” in contrast to the Taira who were lords of the land, for how connected they were over the water to the rest of the world. Tosaminato– the port whose ruins are now part of Goshogawara, Aomori Prefecture– was one of the major ports of Michinoku under the Northern Fujiwara that served as a conduit for this trade. But we must remember also that the Northern Fujiwara were, as I’ve mentioned often on this podcast before, of mixed Yamato and Emishi origin, and combined the imperial court’s authority together with local Emishi sources of legitimacy to cement their claim to rule. As archaeologist Mark Hudson observes, the archaeological record underlines just how far the Northern Fujiwara were connected by trade to the rest of the world, and how that trade had an influence in driving the development of Ainu culture to the north. Goods flowed in both directions, yes– seal fur and eagle feathers, for instance, came south from Hokkaido, and horses from Michinoku went south into the land ruled by the Yamato court. But also, Ainu people themselves came south to the lands which Hiraizumi controlled, and they didn’t simply stop when the Kamakura Shogunate destroyed Hiraizumi and the Northern Fujiwara. In parts of Aomori Prefecture, there were Ainu well into the Edo period, and we discussed this in a past episode about Tsugaru domain military activity in Hokkaido early in the Edo period, where these Ainu served as interpreters. So with that said, it should come as no surprise that there are Ainu influences on place names in the Tohoku region, particularly from Sendai on north, and on the matagi culture’s language in particular. Indeed, the word “matagi” itself is cognate with the Ainu word “matangi,” which also means “hunter.” I’ve seen some dispute over whether Japanese got that particular word from Ainu or the other way around, but I feel like that debate is missing the point. The point, to me, is that in this context the linguistic connection between Ainu and the matagi is less unusual and more a mark of that regional interconnection. The world of the Northern Fujiwara, who were Emishi that had risen high and carved out the nearest thing to an independent Michinoku, was a part of and important driver of that web.\n\nFour: “Tanigaki-nispa”\n\nThe matagi of course still exist today, albeit fewer in number. There are museums about them, including the Matagi Shiryōkan in the city of Kitaakita. But they have also, perhaps unsurprisingly, had an enduring place in popular depictions. Right now, perhaps the most famous one is the manga and anime Golden Kamuy. An imperial army sniper named Tanigaki Genjirō, who begins as an antagonist and then becomes an ally, is a matagi. He has an understanding of the Ainu communities in the story that is superior to that of other Japanese characters. This makes sense, given the Ainu influence on matagi stretching back nearly a millennium. There’s also a 1994 novel by Haji Eisai called Matagi Monomitai Tenmatsu (Particulars of the Matagi Scout Troop), which follows matagi in the Boshin War; Haji also wrote a 2011 novel featuring matagi, called Matagi Hanzō Jikenjō.\n\nIn my own prior work, in the background writing I did for my 2020 debut novel Grey Dawn, Leigh’s maternal grandmother Shigeko came from a matagi family. This didn’t come up directly in the book as published, but it did contribute to one pretty important point of the story which was there throughout.\n\nIn memory of her Japanese matagi ancestors, Leigh kept her original paternal surname of Hunter.\n\nSources\n\n____.

Luke Roberts, professor of history at UC Santa Barbara, wrote a really good book on this called Performing the Great Peace, and I highly recommend it– it’s available for borrowing for free on Archive.org, and it’s worth the read. And one of the chapters has a name that sounds suspiciously like a zombie movie, and for good reason: Politics of the Living Dead.\n\nIn short, until a domain officially announced its lord’s death, the daimyo wasn’t actually, officially, for real dead. And believe it or not, an undead daimyo could actually come in handy for a domain, as Roberts explains in great detail.\n\nSo, let’s explore this per what Roberts describes, based on the historical record. Obviously individual cases could vary, but we’re trying to get a general, broad sense of what’s entailed here with the whole undead daimyo thing.\n\nDaimyo dies without an heir. The domain’s in trouble– with no heir, the Shogunate has every reason to confiscate the domain and give the land to another lord– what in English is called by the now archaic term “attainder.” If the daimyo’s death is confirmed, and the domain gets attaindered, the vassals all automatically become ronin and they’re shit out of luck.\n\nBut until the daimyo’s officially announced as dead, there’s still time to save the day. So I need you to imagine the retainers of this undead daimyo going around the back doors of daimyo estates in Edo and banging on them furiously and asking in an overdramatic whisper, YOU GOT ANY SPARE BABIES?\n\nAnd all the while, the Shogunate already knows the daimyo’s dead.\n\nLet me say that again, this whole song and dance so far, the Shogunate knows. But until propriety has been observed and the daimyo’s death has been officially announced, the daimyo isn’t actually dead.\n\nSometimes this was a really fast deal, with the situation getting fixed and the daimyo’s death getting formally reported as close as 2 days off from the daimyo’s actual death. In one case Roberts notes, the difference was as gigantic as 104 days, in the case of Miyake Yasuaki of Tahara domain, who died 7/10/1827 and whose official death date was 10/23/1827. I know, I know. The smell…\n\nBut anyway, let’s get back to this hypothetical undead daimyo, shall we?\n\nA lot of daimyo families would indeed often have “spare babies,” because after all, this is a system that operates on primogeniture, which means only the firstborn, or the child considered the firstborn, gets the headship, and it’s helpful to have spares. If the others are fortunate, they get their own stipend and get to live comfortably at their sibling’s estate, or maybe they get lucky and they get their own landholding split off and they get stood up as their own daimyo. But more often than not, they only got to live as dependents of their parents and eldest sibling, so getting adopted out to other daimyo families to inherit *their* headship was, in fact, something of a step up. So yes, there were spare babies.\n\nSo the retainers of the undead daimyo find a spare baby. But the undead daimyo is still technically alive, so the Shogunate has to come witness him adopting the baby, right?\n\nAnd again, the Shogunate knows the daimyo’s undead. This is all happening with tacit understanding, because the appearance of following the law is what’s paramount.\n\nSo they invite the Shogunate’s inspector to a ceremony. The undead daimyo is half obscured by a folding screen. And I need you to imagine the ensuing scene: the retainers go in behind hte screen and say WHAT’S THAT, YOUR LORDSHIP WISHES TO ADOPT THIS BABY AS YOUR HEIR?\n\nWHAT’S THAT, YOU WISH TO ADOPT THIS BABY AS YOUR LITERAL LAST ACT BEFORE DYING?\n\nHERE, LET ME HELP YOUR LORDSHIP STAMP THE DOCUMENT.\n\nAnd they’d bring out the document, show the inspector, and the inspector would duly recognize the inheritance. And then from behind the screen, the other retainer would declare OH NO, HIS LORDSHIP IS DECEASED. LAMENTATIONS.\n\nSo now the zombie daimyo was actually proper dead, with the Shogunate inspector in attendance.\n\nBut that’s not all.\n\nSometimes this would all happen entirely under the radar.\n\nConsider the case of Nanbu Toshimochi, who was actually two people– one of them 1808-1821, the other 1803-1825. Nanbu Toshimochi A became lord at 12. But before he could be received in audience by the shogun and have his title and everything else recognized, he died suddenly after roughhousing in the estate garden one day. Story goes he fell out of a tree and just died.\n\nAnd so the Nanbu domain replaced him with a cousin, who they also named Nanbu Toshimochi, who immediately succeeded his predecessor at the age of 18. To this day, the official version of the Nanbu lineage subsumes both into one person who was the 11th generation daimyo of Morioka. But the Shogunate didn’t particularly make an issue out of it, and so Morioka wasn’t attaindered and survived until 1871.\n\nIn general, this points to a bigger issue that I think we need to keep in mind, which is that some of these rules in the Tokugawa system that we think were ironclad and punishable by death, weren’t actually as ironclad as they seem. The closed-country edicts, the one castle per domain rule, and even the policy of attainder if a daimyo died without an heir, all had fuzzy boundaries and lots and lots of exceptions to the point that we need to be careful of how we think of them. Thinking of them in the sense of laws in a modern polity isn’t *quite* what fits. There were the facts, and then there were the “facts”– you can’t see me doing the scarequotes but imagine me doing the scarequotes– the data points as the official parties involved all agreed to.\n\nI want to quote Roberts here:\n\n“For modern historians to use this information as facts in the modern sense, as if the Tokugawa had worked according to the logic of a modern nation, is not being sensitive to how deeply history writing itself is bound by historical context.”\n\nIn other words, there’s facts, and then there’s the official version of events, and the people in the Tokugawa system– in the Shogunate and in the domains– understood the distinction, and so should we. We should also remember the thing that my methodology professor said in my first week of grad school that so shook my world: “you do know ‘history’ isn’t ‘what actually happened,’ right?”\n\nIt’s true. The events of the past are not the things we write about the events of the past.\n\nTo sum this all up, as Roberts puts it, the Tokugawa Shogunate– which operated on the basis of the appearance of propriety and open political secrets, like the zombie daimyo situation– maintained order by performing order. Which I guess comes down to what I’ve been arguing on this podcast and elsewhere for a long time now, both in my capacity as an author of fiction as well as my capacity as an historian: stories have power. To quote Roberts again, “it is certainly important for historians to be aware of the complex politics of omote [public] and naisho [secret], if only because these politics influenced the documentary record in ways that cannot be ignored.”\n\nAnd with that, I will see you next time.\n\nSources\n\n“Nanbu Toshimochi.” Kotobank.jp, Accessed 24 August 2023.\n\nLuke Roberts.
