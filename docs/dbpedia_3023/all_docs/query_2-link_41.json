Its particularly beautiful, bi-colored flowers are lilac-pink and wine-red, fading to blue as they wilt; pods are deep maroon to inky purple, fading to blue and leathery brown when mature. It is best used as a soup pea by picking when the pods are full; but it can also be grown as an edible-podded sugar pea by harvesting before peas have developed.\n\nThis English, or shelling, pea prefers cool, moist conditions. Direct sow the seeds in fertile garden loam 4-8 weeks before the last spring frost. Monticello gardeners support the twining vines with tall branches, or \"pea sticks\". Approximately 15-20 seeds per packet."
