        "text": "Post by The Kevstaaa on\n\nUnforgiven 2001\n\nSeptember 23rd, 2001 – Mellon Arena in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania\n\nOver the years, I've purchased the Royal Rumble and SummerSlam Anthology collections, as well as some random other Pay-Per-Views on DVD. The beauty of the WWE Network is getting to relive the Pay-Per-Views that I don't remember, like this Unforgiven 2001 show for instance. I remember the WWF and WCW Title matches, but nothing else really so these are the shows that I most look forward to.\n\nWWF Tag Team Championship Fatal Four Way\n\nThe Dudley Boyz (c) d. The Hardy Boyz, Lance Storm & The Hurricane and Spike Dudley & Big Show in 14:21\n\nIt was pretty clear by the participants that the tag team division was beginning to suffer after the high that Edge and Christian, the Dudleys and the Hardys helped it rise to. We get two thrown together tag teams in this one but, Shane Helms was getting very over with the Hurricane character. His poses and mannerisms were great here and I got a kick out of him trying to chokeslam the Big Show. However, despite being very over, his team is the first one out. I really would've liked to see Lance Storm and The Hurricane as a long term team where Storm was the straight man to Hurricane's antics. Maybe even have him be a sidekick down the road. Spike Dudley earns his paycheck with some big bumps and they are the next team out. It's down to the Hardys and Dudleys again, and to be honest, it's been done to death. Not bad though and the Dudleys retain after a 3D. ***\n\nPerry Saturn d. Raven w/ Terri Runnels in 5:07\n\nI was a big fan of both of these guys in both ECW and WCW, but Saturn never did much for me in the WWF. It wasn't only that he wasn't used very well, his heart just didn't seem into his performances. Raven was great for the Hardcore division though. Anyway, this is about Saturn's broken heart after Moppy was shredded by Terri. Yes, Saturn was in love with a mop and his girlfriend at the time, Terri, got jealous and put it in a wood chipper. For those who never saw it, yes that's a real wrestling angle. To be fair, Saturn made it work as his time with Moppy was pretty funny. This match however, was just not good in nearly any way. The crowd didn't care at all which hurt. *\n\nIntercontinental Championship\n\nChristian d. Edge (c) to win the title in 11:53\n\nAs an eleven year old boy, Edge and Christian were the coolest thing ever to me. I wore their shirt to a Raw that I went to in 2001, so when they broke up I was crushed. But, I was looking forward to their series of matches. This would be the first after Christian got jealous of Edge's success and hit him with the one man Conchairto in Canada. Because angles between Canadian wrestlers should always happen in Canada. I really wanted to love this match as it has two of my all time favorite performers but it just wasn't great. Don't get me wrong, it was a good, solid match and Christian seemed to enjoy working the heel role again but maybe this was just a warm up to the Ladder match that I remember from No Mercy. Christian wins after a low blow with a chair. ***\n\nWCW Tag Team Championship\n\nThe Undertaker and Kane (c) d. Kronik w/ Steven Richards in 10:22\n\nKronik was pretty cool during their run in WCW. I never was a big Brian Adams fan but I loved me some Bryan Clarke. So, I lied earlier as this is a match that I remember, but only because I've heard such negative things about it. The Undertaker was in a pretty big “I'm not going to sell for anyone” mood throughout the Invasion and it was in full effect here. Kronik looked awful and Brian Adams looked winded within a minute or two of the match. This went just over ten minutes but felt like thirty. It's boring, there's zero selling from the champs and it's as bad as people say it is. No stars\n\nHardcore Championship\n\nRob Van Dam (c) d. Chris Jericho in 16:34\n\nDuring my WrestleMania X-Seven review I stated that the Hardcore Title match that night was my all-time favorite. That was because I forgot about Rob Van Dam and Jeff Hardy at Invasion and SummerSlam, which top it. However, I totally forgot about this match ever happening and it is now my new favorite Hardcore Title match of all time. I can't believe I forgot this because these were my two favorite guys in 2001. I loved how RVD's Hardcore Title matches always started with wrestling and only brought in basic weapons like chairs or ladders. It kept the matches more focused. Anyway, this was all around awesome and is a must see. Jericho complimented RVD well and takes some rough shots with the ladder. Overall, an absolute blast. ****1/4\n\nWCW Heavyweight Championship\n\nThe Rock (c) d. Booker T & Shane McMahon in 15:23\n\nSomething about this just didn't click. It wasn't as good as the WCW Title match at SummerSlam. The heels dominate the early goings with underhanded tactics, because WCW wasn't allowed to look good. Test, Bradshaw and a bunch of referees get involved as overbooking was the story of this match. This seemed like a Raw or Smackdown main event that made it to a pay-per-view. It also dragged on a bit and couldn't The Rock have pinned Shane to at least keep Booker looking somewhat credible? **1/2\n\nUnited States Championship\n\nRhyno d. Tajiri (c) w/ Torrie Wilson in 4:51\n\nTorrie Wilson makes me drool a bit. I honestly don't remember Tajiri or Rhyno as United States Champion. Torrie gets in the ring at one point and twists her ankle, allowing Rhyno to set up for the Gore. I thought Tajiri would jump in the way and eat the Gore, leading to the finish but he kicked Rhyno in the face instead. Shortly after that, Rhyno hit the Gore and won the belt. **\n\nWWF Championship\n\nKurt Angle d. “Stone Cold” Steve Austin (c) in 23:12 to win the title\n\nWe start with a brawl on the ramp and the crowd is red hot for Angle. Austin is hesitant to hit the Stunner, setting up a good story that Angle is in Austin's head, especially after kicking out of three Stunners at SummerSlam. The brawl goes up the ramp where Angle tosses Austin off of it, as yet another callback to earlier things in their rivalry. Something that I love to see. They use another favorite of mine, by removing the padded mat and exposing the concrete. Who doesn't love old school spots? By the way, Angle hits the concrete with a sickening thud. The continued attempts at the piledriver are also well done. Angle wins after Austin taps to the Ankle Lock even though his hand was under the rope. They had to do the switch here after 9/11, and Angle would drop the back belt in a few weeks. The faces come out to celebrate in a nice moment. ***1/2\n\nOverall: 6/10; Pretty good show that could've been better. You can go out of your way to see the excellent Hardcore Title match and Kurt Angle's moment to close the show. The Intercontinental Title match was good but not great and the opener was decent. The WCW Tag Title match was horrendous and everything else was average. The Invasion angle just wasn't as hot as it should've been.\n\n2001 Pay-Per-View Rankings\n\nWrestleMania 10/10\n\nRoyal Rumble 9.5/10\n\nNo Way Out 9.5/10\n\nSummerSlam 8.5/10\n\nInvasion 7/10\n\nJudgment Day 7/10\n\nKing of the Ring 6.5/10\n\nBacklash 6.5/10\n\nUnforgiven 6/10\n\nInsurrextion 3.5/10\n\nPost by The Kevstaaa on\n\nWrestleMania VI\n\n4/1/1990 - Skydome in Toronto, Ontario, Canada\n\nSo, the Pay-Per-Views that I'm not watching and reviewing in chronological order, have been put into a hat basically and I will randomly pick one out and review it in my free time. First one out, WrestleMania VI which is coincidentally, the first WrestleMania that I was alive for. A fourteen match card is pretty hefty so I'm getting right into it.\n\nRick “The Model “Martel d. Koko B. Ware in 5:31\n\nThe Model character was something I always thought was cool and it was relatively fresh here. For an opener, this wasn't outstanding but the crowd was pretty hot for it. Koko and Rick did a fine job with a small amount of time. Rick started in control, but Koko got on a flurry that made the crowd roar. It was a fun little opener that helped to establish Rick Martel, who was always a good hand in the ring. **1/4\n\nWWF Tag Team Championship\n\nDemolition d. The Colossal Connection (c) w/ Bobby Heenan in 9:14 to win the titles\n\nI have to give credit to Haku because at this point, Andre The Giant was so broken down that Haku had to do a hefty chunk of the work during their tag team run. This was no different as Andre stayed on the apron throughout the entirety of the match. That made for an interesting match as normal tag formula would not be able to work here. Instead, the match dragged on a bit, but once the finishing sequence came it picked up. Andre got in, got tied up in the ropes and the Demolition Decapitation gave us new Champions. **\n\nAfter the match, Bobby Heenan decides to slap around Andre and he takes a beating for it. In Andre's last match, he gets to exit to a standing ovation as a babyface.\n\nEarthquake w/ Jimmy Hart d. Hercules in 4:50\n\nGoing into this, I was totally not looking forward to it. Two guys that I was not a fan of in what is sure to be a tedious affair. Hercules tries some tests of strength with Earthquake that don't go so well and, shortly after, Earthquake puts him down with the Earthquake splash. Extended squash. *\n\nBrutus “The Barber” Beefcake d. Mr. Perfect w/ The Genius in 7:49\n\nConsidering that I was less than six months old when WrestleMania VI aired, I never got the chance to be upset at this result. Now that I'm going back, my goodness do I hate that Mr. Perfect's unbeaten record ends at the hands of Brutus the Barber. I never liked Brutus and this match saw Perfect in control for the majority of it, until Brutus hit a slingshot and won from out of nowhere. **1/4\n\n“Rowdy” Roddy Piper and Bad News Brown wrestle to a double count out in 6:48\n\nRoddy Piper is sporting his infamous half black face for this one. I totally never knew that he wore half black body. The match is a decent brawl as I was always a fan of both guys. I totally would have preferred if Roddy Piper actually just went over Brown but they decided to go with a draw. Not entirely sure why as the crowd was hot for Piper. *1/4\n\nThe Hart Foundation d. The Bolsheviks in 0:19\n\nEverybody remembers this. The Bolsheviks go to sing the Russian national anthem, only to have Jim Neidhart attack from behind (this has happened in nearly every match). A Hart Attack ends this in very fast time. It's noted that they issued a challenge to Demolition for the Tag Team Titles. No Ranking\n\nThe Barbarian w/ Bobby Heenan d. Tito Santana in 4:32\n\nJesse Ventura kills me every single time he calls Tito Santana “Chico Santana.” Not a bad match for what it was. Tito was getting up there in age and the Barbarian was never great. Tito hits the Flying Jalapeno but the Brain puts Barbarian's foot on the ropes. Barbarian then hits a flying shoulder block and ends it. *1/2\n\nDusty Rhodes and Sapphire d. “Macho King” Randy Savage and Queen Sherri in 7:28\n\nI've heard some bad things about this. Macho Man and Dusty Rhodes are two of the greatest of all time and Sherri is pretty great as well. When Dusty & Sapphire are announced at a combined 465 pounds, Jesse says that Dusty is only 200 of that. Miss Elizabeth shows up even though she had an interview earlier where she said she was unsure if she'd ever be back. Damn red herrings. Some sloppy work from two guys who usually deliver and the girls struggle as well, mainly due to Sapphire. Sapphire rolls up Sherri to stop the bleeding but at least the crowd was incredibly into it. *\n\nThe Orient Express w/ Mr. Fuji d. The Rockers via countout in 7:38\n\nThese two teams had an awesome match at the following Royal Rumble if I remember correctly. Hopefully this is nearly as good. It's crazy to think how great Shawn Michaels would become. I miss the days of great managers like Mr. Fuji. He and the Orient Express did the little things that help make a match better. Near the end, some good old fashioned salt in Marty Jannetty's eyes causes him to blindly walk over the guardrail and into the crowd as the referee counts to ten. **1/2\n\n“Hacksaw” Jim Duggan d. Dino Bravo w/ Jimmy Hart & Earthquake in 4:14\n\nI know a lot of people love Jim Duggan and I see the appeal, but I was never a big fan of either of these guys. Jesse Ventura makes a good point as Duggan comes out and tries to get a USA chant going in Toronto, which fails even though he's over. Ventura is the best part of this match. Duggan wins after stopping Earthquake's interference attempt and hitting Bravo with the 2x4. *1/4\n\nMillion Dollar Championship\n\nTed Dibiase (c) w/ Virgil d. Jake “The Snake” Roberts via countout in 11:56\n\nWhen getting ready to review this show, I did my best to not read the card in advance but I ended up doing so about halfway through and this was the match, besides the main event, that stood out. According to the video beforehand, this has a six or month build. Those were the days. Jake goes for the DDT early followed by some arm work. Dibiase takes control but the match stays relatively slow. The crowd busts out into a wave which does make them loud. Jake hits the beautiful short arm clothesline and Virgil pulls him out of the ring. Roberts takes care of Virgil, but Dibiase tosses him into the ring post and earns the countout win. A disappointment but not terrible. **1/2\n\nThe Big Boss Man d. Akeem w/ Slick in 1:45\n\nSeeing Slick and the African Dream make this WrestleMania worth it. I know that Akeem wasn't the best gimmick ever, but it's a lot of fun. Anyway, the Twin Towers collide here and, even with a pre-match attack, Boss Man wins in less than two minutes. But, Boss Man is a jive soul bro, a jive soul bro and he always lying to his friends. *\n\n“Ravishing” Rick Rude w/ Bobby Heenan d. “Superfly” Jimmy Snuka in 3:51\n\nMore Bobby Heenan and I am completely for that. Jimmy Snuka was past him prime and this was an extended squash for the Ravishing One. Not much to write about here except that Rude hadn't started the whole “wearing my opponent's face on my junk” thing with his attire yet. *3/4\n\nWWF and Intercontinental Championships\n\nThe Ultimate Warrior (c) d. Hulk Hogan (c) in 22:46 to win both titles\n\nThere is definitely a big fight feel in the atmosphere. Both men show off their strength by shoving each other into the corner at the start. An actual test of strength follows with both men getting the better at one point. They're clearly trying to hammer home how equal these two are. They trade spots ending with body slams and the Warrior gets the better of that. Hogan sells a leg injury that disappears a few minutes later. Just over ten minutes in and we get a double clothesline and Warrior's face paint is pretty much completely gone. Warrior starts to “hulk up” and we'll see how Hogan likes being on the other end. Warrior locks on the dreaded bear hug for a while until Hogan gets out and the referee takes a bump. Hogan and Warrior both get three counts that Earl Hebner is down for. Hogan badly sells Warrior's gorilla press before kicking out and hulking up. Hogan misses the leg drop, Warrior hits a splash and wins the gold. Hogan kicks out a split second after three because he's god, but he hands over the belt and Warrior is set to be a mega star. ***1/2\n\nOverall: 4/10; At fourteen matches, a majority of this card is filler. Only six of the fourteen matches get at least two stars. If the card was cut down it would've been better. Still, it was a fun trip down memory lane and the main event is a good time. Next up on my random non 2001 review list is WCW World War 3 1996.\n\nPost by TKO Propagandist on\n\nNo Way Out 2000\n\nFebruary 27, 2000, at the Hartford Civic Center in Hartford, Connecticut.\n\nComing off the back of the Royal Rumble the previous month, we would see a return match for the WWF Championship featuring Triple H and Cactus Jack, this time in Hell in a Cell and with Cactus career on the line. The semi main event saw the controversial winner of the 2000 Royal Rumble The Rock take on Big Show. Rock's feet were alleged to have touch the floor first and that Big Show was infact the legitimate winner. They would square off to see who would be the number one contender for to the WWF Championship at Wrestlemania 2000.\n\nWWF Intercontinental Championship Kurt Angle def. Chris Jericho. Already the European Champion, a title he had won two weeks prior, Angle defeats Jericho in a very good opener with some good wrestling to win the Intercontinental title and become the 'Eurocontinental Champion'. The finish came when Kurt used the belt to intercept Jericho's Lionsault, which gets the three. Throughout the rest of the show we see various backstage segments of Angle celebrating his victory which are very entertaining. 2.5 Stars.\n\nWWF Tag Team Championship The Dudley Boyz def. The New Age Outlaws. This would be the last time the Outlaws compete together in WWE until many many years later. It would also be the last time they held the Tag Team titles until earlier this year: 2014. Nothing really to this match, Dudleys get the 3D for the win. 0.5 Stars.\n\nMark Henry def. Viscera. Viscera had gave Mae Young who was pregnant with a hand a splash, so Mae's boyfriend Mark Henry got his revenge in this match. Wins with the World Strongest Slam. DUD.\n\nEdge and Christian def. Hardy Boyz. Really good traditional tag team wrestling, as two of the most popular teams of the time wrestle here. Edge and Christian get the win after Terri distracts Matt Hardy. Awesome match. 3 Stars.\n\nTazz def. Big Boss Man via DQ. Tazz get's his ass kicked by Bossman and Albert but keeps getting back up, before being cracked in the head with a nightstick. DUD.\n\nX-Pac def. Kane. Tori had turned on Kane for X-Pac, so Kane was angry and wanted revenge. It made for some enjoyable TV in the build up to the match, but the match itself wasn't good. X-Pac wins after he dropkicks the steps into Kane. 1.5 Stars.\n\nToo Cool and Rikishi def. The Radicals. Rikishi had a bad leg so The Radicals worked that over for the rest of the match. Rikishi get's the hot tag towards the end of the match and get's the win with a Banzai Drop. Decent match. 2 Stars.\n\nBig Show def. The Rock. Kinda pointless match because they both ended up in the main event at Wrestlemania 2000 anyway. Not a great match, more about the storyline and the finish as Rock, while going for the People's Elbow is hit with a chair by Shane McMahon and Show pins him. 1.5 Stars.\n\nWWF Championship Hell in a Cell match Triple H def. Cactus Jack. Probably my all time favourite Hell in a Cell match. Highlights include a piledriver onto the announce table which doesn't break. Cactus brings out the barbwire baseball bat and lights it on fire on top of the cell and hits Triple H with it. Cactus goes for a piledriver on top of the cell but is reversed by the Game as Jack is backdropped through the cell and into the ring. Pedigree get's the win and Mick Foley is no more, or so we thought as he is back a month later. This is a great great match and probably the second best Hell in a Cell match after the first one. 4.5 Stars.\n\nOverall this is a decent show, there is some avoidable matches but also some really good matches. With the main event being the highlight of the PPV. I give it a 5.5/10.\n\nPost by The Kevstaaa on\n\nNo Mercy 2001\n\nOctober 21st, 2001 – Savvis Center in St. Louis, Missouri\n\nAnother show that I don't fully remember except for the Triple Threat main event, the WCW Title match and the Intercontinental Title Ladder match. This is around the time that the Alliance started getting more and more WWF people. Let's see how this show does.\n\nWCW Tag Team Championship\n\nThe Hardy Boyz (c) w/ Lita d. Lance Storm and The Hurricane w/ Ivory & Mighty Molly in 7:42 to retain the titles\n\nIt's completely weird to see the Hardy Boyz with the WCW Tag Team Titles. Weirder than the Dudley Boyz for some reason. As I said when reviewing Unforgiven, I like the team of Lance Storm and the Hurricane. Right off the bat, The Hurricane is once again awesome as he's completely in character and makes it work so well. Hurricane makes Storm tag him in with a fist bump which is great. He flies after getting his cape put on by Molly in another well done spot, to which Paul Heyman adds a “whoosh” on commentary. Jeff hot tags Matt in after a botched enziguri, before a roll up from Hurricane gets a very close near fall. The girls get involved before a Twist of Fate/Swanton Bomb combination wins it. Very fun and energetic opener that I really enjoyed ***1/4\n\nTest d. Kane in 10:08\n\nMan I feel like the WWF really missed the boat with Test. In 1999, I felt that he could've been huge and even win the WWF Title at Survivor Series that year. At this point though, Test was just a bore. Kane gorilla presses Test to the outside, which was impressive. Nick Patrick ignores blatant cheating from Test. The match doesn't get off to a good start as it's pretty boring. Kane seems to alternate good and bad stretches and during the Invasion, he's been in a bit of a funk. Test wins after a low blow and big boot, for some reason. Slow and plodding. *3/4\n\nLingerie Match\n\nTorrie Wilson d. Stacy Keibler in 3:07\n\nOkay, so this is another match that I remember for obvious reasons. Sunny's theme plays while they show the graphic for the match which brings me back. I expect this to be hot and pretty bad as Stacy and Torrie are not very good in the ring. In the build up video we get to see Stacy Dudley, which was very hot. Stacy busts out a whip and uses it on Torrie and Jack Doane. This wasn't as bad as I expected. They worked hard, I saw a serious of roll ups attempts, a foot choke and a lot of booty. Torrie uses Tajiri's handspring elbow to end it. Not terrible. *1/2\n\nIntercontinental Championship Ladder Match\n\nEdge d. Christian (c) in 22:15 to win the title\n\nIn my review of Unforgiven, I mentioned that I was looking for a classic between these two and I hoped this Ladder match would be just that. Christian's entrance is all around awesome, the theme and pyro. A brawl in the entrance starts this and there are honestly too many ladder spots for me to recount here. They do have some nice callbacks to old ladder matches like Christian's reverse DDT off a ladder and Edge's Spear off a ladder. These two know what they're doing in a match like this and Edge brutally ends it after a con-chair-to on top of ladders before pulling down the belt. This again wasn't a classic, but it was a very good to great ladder match. ***3/4\n\nWWF Tag Team Championship\n\nThe Dudley Boyz (c) d. Big Show and Tajiri in 9:20 to retain the titles\n\nThe lack of Stacy Keibler and Torrie Wilson accompanying the teams is highly upsetting even though I saw them in lingerie earlier. Another makeshift team shows the struggling tag team division. Some good old heel tactics allow the Dudleys to dominate Tajiri. Tajiri does make the hot tag and Big Show cleans house until he gets chop blocked. Tajiri makes the dumb move of tagging himself right back in and blinds the referee with the mist by mistake. Rhyno interferes because the Alliance isn't allowed to win any match cleanly and Tajiri eats a 3D. Not bad but the Dudleys were going through the motions. **1/4\n\nThe Undertaker d. Booker T in 13:12\n\nConsidering how WCW guys have looked against The Undertaker during the Invasion, this doesn't bode well for Booker. Jim Ross makes a comment about Booker T feeling buried alive which is ironic because Booker has not beaten anyone from the WWF besides getting the pin at the Invasion main event. Maybe this is an unpopular opinion, but I only really enjoy The Undertaker's work in 1996, 1997, some 2002 and most of his second deadman run. Besides that, I don't care much for his matches. He kicks out of the scissors kick and hits a Last Ride, effectively killing Booker T. The WCW's top guy has now lost to The Rock on back to back pay-per-views and The Undertaker now. It's really hard to take the Alliance seriously. **\n\nWCW Heavyweight Championship\n\nChris Jericho d. The Rock (c) in 23:43 to win the title\n\nWWF vs. WWF for the WCW Championship? Again, this proves how little the bookers thought of the Alliance guys. Regardless, this should be good. It starts with some mat wrestling until Chris Jericho slaps The Rock and it gets more physical. Both men tease their finishers but get nowhere with it and the crowd is split. It really makes me wonder why they turned Jericho heel. They trade chops in the corner and Jericho's are better. Side note, Jericho's attire is great tonight. Good stuff so far, that has been made better by the hot crowd. Things spill outside and stay physical until Rock busts out a snap mare and its rest hold time. Jericho takes us back to the 90's by pulling out a hurricanrana. He hits a Rock Bottom followed by a Lionsault but Rock somehow kicks out. He misses the People's Elbow and The Rock applies a Sharpshooter that's better than his usual. Big time Rock Bottom through a table before things go back in the ring. Jericho awesomely counters the People's Elbow into the Walls of Jericho to a huge pop. Rock doesn't tap and Stephanie McMahon is out and throws a chair in the ring but she takes a Rock Bottom. Jericho connects with the little used Breakdown finisher on the chair and wins the belt. Match of the night, though the not so clean finish hurt it a bit. ****\n\nWWF Championship\n\nSteve Austin (c) d. Kurt Angle and Rob Van Dam in 15:14 to retain the title\n\nI feel like Rob Van Dam was the only Alliance guy booked to look really good. He hit a long range Five Star Frog Splash on Kurt Angle in the build up video that was sweet. Angle hits three Germans and a belly to belly suplex as we start hot. Heyman mentions that we have a great high flier, great wrestler and great brawler in this. RVD hits some phony looking punches on Angle before turning his focus to Austin. Austin ends up putting RVD in a bad looking half crab. Austin ends up being taken out by a leg drop outside and Angle hits a big suplex and gorgeous moonsault on RVD. Shortly after, Angle and Austin both miss Stunners and clothesline each other down, but then RVD misses a Frog Splash on both. With everybody down, Vince comes out and there's questions if he's down with RVD. Top rope belly to belly from Angle when it looked like he might take a Frog Splash. Vince hits Austin with a chair, allowing a Five Star Frog Splash but Angle stops the pin. He follows with four Germans and an Angle Slam before Shane McMahon comes out because overbooking is the way to go. Shane attacks Kurt and Vince attacks Shane. Austin picks up RVD, hits a Stunner and retains the belt. Enjoyable match despite the overbooking. ***1/2\n\nOverall: 7/10; Another solid show from 2001. Despite the misuse of the Alliance, the in-ring action was well done. Plus, the T&A of the Lingerie match. The opener, Intercontinental Title and double main events were all very good to great. I'd recommend going out and seeing this show."
