        "text": "When it comes to tackling the modern beast of football management simulators, it’s more about undoing old habits than anything else. Your assistant manager was responsible for all the donkey work such as setting up preseason friendlies, training and dealing with the press. All of this was done with the aim of keeping your inbox relatively under control. Yet now is the time to take back control. Lead, my minions. Lead!\n\nUnearthing a South American starlet, dubbed the next Lionel Messi or Gabriel Batistuta, and allowing him to run amok in Europe is one of the best feelings you can get on the game. It doesn’t necessarily have to be South American, even though most of them are, but turning a wonderkid into a world class performer is what most people are looking to do. You know, aside from winning every competition available. Yet I’ve sometimes found more enjoyment in watching a player develop than my side lifting a trophy. Being a Tottenham fan certainly helps maintain this mindset.\n\nYet wonderkids are no longer a secret. You can’t go unopposed as you lure Kim Kallstrom from Djurgårdens IF or Anatoli Todorov from Litex Lovech. The game has advanced, through scouting and other technology, and the competition for any emerging talent is fierce. There’s no time to dwell on your decision either. As soon as they appear on the database, there will be a horde of onlookers in the stands. So how do you stay ahead of the competition?\n\nPICK THE BEST SCOUTS\n\nThis one is fairly self-explanatory but it’s important you don’t waste money on scouts that are simply not good enough. Naturally, this can be scaled down depending on the quality of the league you play in but a low rated scout, with less than desirable stats, could get it horribly wrong and end up costing you a lot of money.\n\nIn terms of finding the best young players, Judging Player Potential is the key stat you’re after. Sure, Judging Player Ability is also desirable but the player in question is unlikely to slot straight into your team. He’ll need time to adapt, possibly learn the language too, so his potential is what matters ahead of everything else.\n\nAlthough as a disclaimer, such as in real life, a potential world class player doesn’t always develop into a world class player. Injuries, internal and external factors, their attitude and performances on the field can all alter the end result.\n\nTAKING CONTROL OF YOUR SCOUTS\n\nOnce again, this is part of the hangover from playing previous versions of the game. Don’t amass a talented scouting network and then have them sat around doing nothing, or waiting for a competition to come up that might be interesting to look at. There’s a desire to delegate control of the scouting network to your Director of Football but don’t do that. They might have a high reputation but computer-controlled staff members aren’t as thorough and precise as you want them to be.\n\nGo to ‘Staff’, ‘Responsibilities’ and then choose ‘Scouting’. There are then two options: Assigning Scouts and Handling Scouting Meetings. The first of those is the most important. This gives you complete freedom over where to send your scouts and who is responsible for each assignment. The second is personal preference. In my long running Spurs save, I’ve handed the scouting meetings over to my Director of Football because I was tired of reading all the reports. I’d recommend you sit in those meetings, at least in the beginning, just so a potential bargain doesn’t slip through the cracks.\n\nSEND ‘EM WHERE YOU NEED ‘EM\n\nOnce you’ve wrestled back complete power of the scouting network at your disposal, the next step is to send them off around the world. Choose ‘Scouting’ from the left panel and go into assignments. By default a Data Analyst will be checking out your next opponents, as will a scout. These reports can offer you important information so don’t just skip past them when they appear in your inbox.\n\nAbove the list of scouts you’ll see ‘Create new assignment‘. Maybe one of your midfielders is starting to decline and you want somebody who could eventually replace him. If this was the case you choose ‘Replacement For’, click on a position in the formation image, then choose the player who is reaching the end of his time at your club. My advice would be to then choose a specific scout for this task rather than letting the computer automatically assign it.\n\nYet if wonderkids are the order of the day, you can choose ‘Hot Prospect’ from the Player Type menu. Next, go up to the top right and click on Scope. The options available are Competition, Nation, Region and Continent. Pick a specific nation, for example Brazil, and assign a scout with high Judging Player Potential AND Adaptability. The Duration can be set to ‘Ongoing’ and therefore he’ll remain in Brazil until you decide to allocate him a new task.\n\nIf you don’t have enough scouts to choose the traditional wonderkid hot spots individually, you can assign someone to the Continent or Region instead. But remember this is one person trying to encompass a vast amount of land. The progress will be a lot slower but, as a potential upswing, it’ll increase your scout’s knowledge of various countries at the same time.\n\nDON’T RUSH, WAIT FOR FULL REPORTS\n\nWhen a five-star potential striker lands on your desk, even if you don’t need one, the immediate response is to sign him. But it’s important to wait until you get a full report from your man in the country. There could be an issue which is flagged up that turns any move from a no-brainer to a serious head-scratcher.\n\nHow many times have you watched a match and thought someone looked unreal, only for them to be largely disappointing the next week? The more thorough the report, the more accurate it’ll be. Aside from his potential being slightly lower, there could be other undesirable characteristics too. Maybe there are injury concerns, adaptability issues and other hidden attributes which contribute to a player’s progress (lack of consistency, uncomfortable in big matches, poor professionalism, etc). Those attributes won’t appear initially so patience is the key.\n\nDON’T STOP MANUAL SEARCHING\n\nSo you’ve brought in some good scouts, sent them off in search of the next big thing and now you’re waiting for the reports to come flooding in. Wrong. Now just because you have a 20-20 scout in Argentina doesn’t mean he will unearth every gem in the country. As we mentioned earlier, these countries are huge and covering every team to a good standard will take a while. And, in some cases, by the time someone pops up on his radar they’ll already be plying their trade in France or Italy.\n\nWhilst your perfectly assembled team is on the ground, continue to search for players manually. Most of the high-potential options will skip the youth ranks and be already attracting interest from other European giants, so it might be worth adding them to your shortlist and getting a report before someone beats you to the punch.\n\nI regularly search for players no older than 17, then order it by ‘INF’ (information). Here you’ll see the people who are wanted by other sides. With the greatest respect, a player who is attracting interest from Girona isn’t going to be good enough for say Liverpool. If you see PSG, Real Madrid or Bayern keeping tabs on the guy then it might be worth checking him out too. It’s a dog eat dog world in the transfer market so don’t feel bad if you pitch someone from a European rival’s grasp. They would gladly do the same to you.\n\nPOACHING ACADEMIES\n\nThe last piece of advice I can offer when it comes to finding the best young talent around is an unethical one but a scenario which exists in real life too, so that makes it okay, right? Basically, there’s a window of opportunity – usually 7-10 days – where you can steal away the best youth candidates at other elite sides before they pen a provisional deal.\n\nFor Premier League sides, you will initially receive a preview of the next batch of youngsters before they end up on trial with your U18s in March. It can happen at any time during that month – for both you and your domestic rivals. Other major European leagues receive their intake from February to April.\n\nHow do you do check, I hear you ask? Go to Globe icon at the top right, then select ‘World’ and finally ‘Transfers’. In the drop down menu, click on ‘Youth Intake’ and sort by date so the newest appear first.\n\nIt’s worth remembering that it’s going to be extremely hard to get an accurate scout report on a player before they sign a deal with a club. Valuations can also be wrong. Attack minded players are more expensive than defensive ones and, if you’re poaching from a league rival, the compensation fee can run into the millions. You’ll need to weigh up whether each person is worth the potential outlay or not.\n\nOne thing I’ve done is offer contracts to promising players and then delayed confirming the deal until I have a full scout report. Even then, a word of caution is needed. Players develop at varying speeds and their potential can also fluctuate. Don’t immediately cast someone aside unless they are way below the recommended level. In my experience, signing youngsters from abroad – with or without work permits, depending on your Brexit outcome – has yielded a lot more success than raiding domestic rivals.\n\nNow you are ready to locate, scout and sign the best young talent from around the virtual world of Football Manager. How that youth talent is nurtured, developed and ultimately given the best chance to succeed is another story for another day.\n\nHappy hunting.\n\nOne of the most intimidating aspects of jumping into the modern version of Football Manager is the level of detail at your fingertips. Those who grew up on Championship Manager 01/02 could smash through a season in one session. That isn’t really possible on FM20 unless, well, you don’t plan on doing anything else for the rest of the day. Or, you know, can survive on less than four hours sleep. But my advice to you would be to embrace the detail, the foreplay of management sims if you will, as eventually you’ll find out what you like and don’t like.\n\nAnd don’t feel embarrassed to admit that you, like myself, used to immediately assign all the tedious tasks such as arranging friendlies and handling training to the assistant coach. We’ve all been there and, for the most part, it’s perfectly fine. But don’t be put off by the chance to delve further into the tasks available to you. There’s a joy and sense of achievement to be had knowing you played a greater role in the club’s development.\n\nI dipped my toes into the welcoming chasm of love and respect that is Twitter to ask budding managers which areas of the game they found too overwhelming. And, just as a tiny disclaimer, it’s perfectly fine to not care about certain aspects. There is a reason you can sign so many staff members and when you click on their responsibilities, it barely fits onto the page. Take control of what you can – and want to – without losing your enjoyment for the game. After all, we should all be playing this game to have a bit of fun.\n\nFirst up we’re going to tackle that very thing I just mentioned: your staff.\n\nHow important are your staff?\n\nThe answer is, unsurprisingly, very important. A team is only worth the sum of its parts. If you amass a group of mediocre staff, it’s going to produce predominantly mediocre players. You can have all the knowledge in the world, armed with a downloaded shortlist of the best wonderkids in the game, but if your staff is below par then they are less likely to reach their high-end potential.\n\nWhenever you load up a game, there’s a distinct lack of quality in most areas of the staffing roles. Football Manager tends to fill in the blanks and assigns available staff members to teams based on reputation ahead of anything else. And whilst reputation is fine, it ultimately sees a lot of bang average people being hired by the best clubs in the world. Whoever you start with, in whatever nation, you can probably upgrade every member of staff.\n\nAnd remember, those existing staff member will accept a mutual termination the day you walk through the door. Don’t forget though or it’ll cost you a lot more money. Of course, if you are further down the league and finances are tight, there’s less flexibility when it comes to chopping and changing. But I am going to assume that most people who want greater control are likely to be starting off with a top division side before trying their hand at a lower league club.\n\nCoaching Team\n\nFrom my experience, a lot of Premier League sides tend to start the game with a couple of general coaches and then a load of fitness based ones. Some people have suggested that trying to secure 5-star coaches in each category (Defending, Attacking and Possession: Technical and Tactical; Fitness: Strength and Quickness as well as Goalkeeping: Shot Stopping and Handling & Distribution) isn’t necessary and that loading up with Fitness Coaches, like the computer-controlled sides does, is the way forward. Personally, I disagree. A well rounded coaching staff is crucial to your players development.\n\nThe most important stats you need from your coaches are the holy trinity of Determination, Motivating and Level of Discipline. More often than not one of these three will be on the low side and, depending on your club’s status and who is available, those expectations might need to be lowered even further. If one of those three stats is criminally low, make sure it is Level of Discipline. All it essentially means is the sessions will be more laid back. Ideally you want all three to be above 13/14 with a couple touching 18/19.\n\nAt the start you only need one 4 or 5 star coach to lead each individual category. To see what additional stats are needed alongside the holy trio you need to click on ‘Training’ and then choose ‘Coaches’ from the little sub menu.\n\nFinally, click ‘Edit Coach Assignments’. Here you’ll see the list of your coaches and if you hover over the box in each column, it will highlight what stats are needed for that role.\n\nDepending on the level of coaching badges you started with, you can either lead one of the categories yourself or simply add you and your assistant to every session to reduce the workload of the main coach. Think of the highest rating coach leading the drills and the others setting out the cones and partaking in playful banter. We’ll have an in-depth look at Training in another blog because there’s a lot to digest.\n\nRecruitment Team\n\nThis section also has a heavy dose of personal preference. Some people don’t want a Director of Football and prefer to handle everything themselves. My advice would be to appoint one anyway, a good one, if only to be an extra scout as well as take care of the contracts for the youngsters. It’s a similar story for the new – at least I think it’s new – Technical Director and Loan Manager roles. The former controls the contracts of your staff members and the latter provides reports and advice when it comes to loaning out players. The rest of the section seems self explanatory.\n\nAs for your scouts, aside from Judging Player Potential and Ability, there are two other desirable attributes: Adaptability and Scouting Knowledge.\n\nAdaptability is important because there are certain countries and regions that produce a lot of wonderkids and you’ll want one of your best scouts on hand to identify them before others do. As in real life, being adaptable allows them to settle quicker and essentially do their job better. Anything below 10 in that stat and you’ll probably want to keep them exclusively for individual reports rather than a long term assignment. As per Training, a more in depth look at Scouting will come later on.\n\nScouting Knowledge does what it says on the tin but it’s something a lot of people overlook. Having a fantastic set of scouts is one thing but if they are all only clued up on a couple of countries, the pool of players which appear in your searches will be limited too. This can be remedied by assigning your scouts – with high adaptability – to different countries and picking up scouts and coaches with knowledge of other regions.\n\nThe medical team and their respective roles are, again, pretty easy to understand. You can’t replace the Club Doctor but everyone else is interchangeable.\n\nFinding the Best Staff\n\nWhen it comes to searching for the best staff available, don’t limit your search to people who currently fulfil the role you need. Due to the copious amounts of staff roles available in the current game, some of which are uncommon even at the top sides, there’s an incredible pool of newgen staff members available on a yearly basis.\n\nFor example, in my Spurs save, I’ve got two incredibly talented newgen staff members managing my U23s and U18s sides: Silvio Wilkins and Giovanni Ojeda. Both have outstanding managerial stats but neither of them would have appeared in a search for a manager and/or assistant manager.\n\nOjeda and Wilkins are Head of Youth Developments by default but were free agents, so were enticed to try their hand at coaching by the magic of offering them more money.\n\nThis doesn’t work for everyone though. Sometimes you’ll stumble across a HOYD or Technical Director who is better than Pep Guardiola, on paper, but won’t take any role that isn’t their preferred one. Believe me, I’ve tried and offered stupid money but nothing works.\n\nAll I’m saying is don’t rule out someone who ticks all the boxes just because they are experts in a different role. Almost everyone has a price.\n\nAnother key component when it comes to staff that many people forget is who gives you the coaching reports on players. Somebody who has low stats for Judging Ability and Potential isn’t going to have the most accurate opinion on the players in your squad. You can’t choose one of your scouts to evaluate your players so, in most cases, your HOYD is the go-to man. Unless, of course, you happen to have a coach with better stats in those two fields.\n\nOn the surface it might look a minor difference but as it’s such a simple thing to change it makes sense to assign an appropriate member of staff to handle the reports. All you have to do is click the name of the person in the ‘COACH REPORT BY’ column and choose someone else. In the case above, you’ll notice the guy with worse stats has a higher opinion of the player – both in terms of current ability and his potential – than my HOYD.\n\nThere’s also an extra entry to the Pros column regarding my right back’s performance in training. Every little helps, right?\n\nFinal thoughts\n\nAnd that is my introduction to the basics of choosing your staff and assigning them the correct roles so you get the most out of them. For lower league teams, as well as your U23 and U18 staff, lower the parameters of your search. It’s highly unlikely a fantastic coach, stat wise, is going to accept a role beneath his reputation. Although a few might be tempted should you offer them the chance to manage one of your developmental sides.\n\nIf you are trying to improve your staff levels in the youth teams, another tip is that you can get away without having a specific goalkeeping coach and even one less fitness coach. This is because your senior staff members are heavily involved in the training sessions for the kids too. To prove this click on ‘Dev. Centre’, choose either the U23 or U18 side and then ‘Training’, and finally ‘Edit Coach Assignments’. It frees up a space to add another outfield coach to aid your players’ progression.\n\nWhen it comes to bringing in a Head of Youth Development, their personality is arguably the most important factor. This man is responsible for overseeing the development of youngsters before they appear in your youth intake. If he’s got a poor personality trait it can rub off on those kids coming through. He doesn’t determine the quality of the players coming through. That is based on a combination of Youth Recruitment and Junior Coaching. The best personality in the game is Model Citizen but they are rare. Professional, Resolute and Driven are also good. A positive personality trait can be the difference between a player being a solid squad option and a world class teenager.\n\nIf you want the HOYD to be involved in training as a secondary role then impressive coaching attributes are also desirable. Then it’s down to the standard default high stats for Working with Youngsters, Judging Player Ability and Potential. But I can’t stress enough how important personalities are to a player, their potential and their development. Maybe I’ll add a blog on personality traits at some point too.\n\nIn order to avoid missing a self-set deadline, I won’t commit to specific days but there will be a strong desire on my part to publish two blogs per week.\n\nEight seasons of groundwork, preparation and learning from our mistakes has left us on the cusp of the ultimate glory once again. Any side can fluke their way to the top but it’s much more difficult to maintain your place amongst the elite. We’ve helped make Tottenham Hotspur a very good side but can we push them one step further and cement our legacy as one of the truly great teams?\n\nThe first honour up for grabs is the FA Cup. When you look at how impressive this Spurs side has become, it’s a trophy which doesn’t really make or break our season. That isn’t meant to devalue the longest running cup competition in the modern game but Arsenal fans can attest that winning it doesn’t catapult you into the elite. However, once your team steps out onto the Wembley pitch you don’t want to see them coming off it with just a runners’ up medal either. Every trophy matters and retaining the FA Cup would be a fine achievement.\n\nFA Cup Final\n\nOur chosen XI to face Manchester United is Wells; Villani, Harvey, Sule, Sessegnon; Rice, Camavinga, Gaillard, Foden; Kean and Dembele. Young Keran Tal is obviously missing through injury but everyone else is fit and ready to go.\n\nIt definitely feels like this is the season we say goodbye to Dembele as an ‘untouchable’ in our XI, assuming Tal doesn’t inherit Ledley King’s knee. There is absolutely no way I’d consider selling Moussa though. He covered the absence of Harry Kane and then took it onto a whole new level. A club legend in every sense of the word.\n\nThe opening 45 minutes see us dominate possession – and attempts on goal – but we’ve been unable to find the breakthrough. Unfortunately Dembele picked up a thigh injury and is replaced by young – is 25 still considered young? – Troy Parrott at half-time.\n\nApproaching the 60-minute mark, I signal for Reinier to get warmed up. Camavinga is struggling to impose himself on the game so the plan is to move Foden back and have the Brazilian sit behind my front two. This change is held off as we have a freekick 40 yards out. Gaillard stands over it. The ball is sent to the edge of the six yard area where young Harvey leaps highest to direct his effort goalwards. De Gea has come off his line and is stuck in the middle of nowhere.. so can only watch as it goes in!\n\nUnited have to offer more going forward now which should, in theory, allow more space for us to exploit on the counter. However the former English giants are unable to cope with our tempo and remain camped in their own box. Their only hope at the moment seems to be throwing themselves in the way of shots.\n\nFoden twice tries to test the Spaniard in goal but sees his efforts cannon back off a defender. Phil, who obviously hates United due to his City past, is quickest to every rebound and manages to swing in a delightful cross to the back post. It goes beyond Kean and falls at the feet of Villani, who steadies himself before unleashing a wonderful half-volley into the far corner.. and de Gea can’t get there! 2-0. With 11 minutes to go, that should be it.\n\nTwo minutes later and the contest is over. What started from a United corner ends with Villani powering down the right, skipping past a couple of challenges as he gets into the box. Despite scoring a fine goal moments earlier, he pulls it back for Moise Kean and the Italian stallion beats De Gea at the near post. 3-0. A mullering. An absolute mullering.\n\nAs it commonplace in Football Manager, a collapse usually results in the opposition scoring an obscene amount of late goals. Gaillard sends in another freekick that eventually comes to Reinier on the edge of the area. With no real option available out wide, he plays it back to Gaillard and the French superstar drills a strike along the floor.. through a crowd of people.. and into the bottom corner.\n\nOur academy keeper Chris Wells might be the most significant newgen of the save but Aurelien Gaillard, who cost just 725k and is now worth over 80M, is easily the best one I’ve signed on any Football Manager game. Vive la France!\n\nThis turned out to be Niko Kovac’s last game in charge of Manchester United.\n\nAnd then we move onto Europe. After eight long, but largely successful seasons we come full circle and face Liverpool in the Champions League final.\n\nBruno Fernandes, Chris Wells, Sandro Tonali and Renan Lodi all picked up minor knocks in the week leading up to the contest. Standard. Dembele’s injury against United was a thigh strain but, with this being the final match of the season, he will have an injection to play and then recover through the summer. Tal is on the bench but not fit enough to play more than 60 minutes.\n\nChampions League Final\n\nOur starting XI is unchanged from the FA Cup final (Wells; Villani, Harvey, Sule, Sessegnon; Rice, Camavinga, Gaillard, Foden; Kean and Dembele). Liverpool are without Dani Olmo, Paulo Dybala, Dayot Upamecano and Antony through injury. Unlucky.\n\nThe match starts with Liverpool pushing forward and they get a throw-in deep in our half with only a few minutes on the clock. It’s thrown towards Rosinha, Dybala’s replacement, and is cleared. But wait, the referee has given a penalty. VAR confirms it. Apparently Rice nudged the Brazilian striker. What an absolute joke of a decision. Talk about deja vu.\n\nFabinho steps up for Liverpool.. and beats Wells. We’re 1-0 down early on in the European final because of a horrible call from the officials. And I’ve just realised that I’m playing a half-fit club legend in attack. Spooky.\n\nSpeaking of which, the next highlight is to let me know Dembele can’t continue. Worryingly, it isn’t his thigh but his knee this time. Cometh the hour, cometh the man. I send on the half-fit Tal to replace him.\n\nThe match itself is extremely even. I’m sure the early goal helped boost their confidence but on paper, with their absentees, we are the stronger side. Our defence is doing quite well the midfield hasn’t turned up. Either way, these guys are our best shot at turning things around and I don’t want to make another early change because we’ll almost certainly need to take Tal off again before the end of 90 minutes. Big balls or pure stupidity, you decide.\n\nAs the second half gets underway Liverpool have a freekick but we manage to clear it. Sander Berge has time and space on the edge of the box as he probes for the killer pass but Tal robs possession from him. The youngster charges forward into the space and it’s two-on-two.. but a fantastic tackle from Jerome Onguene allows the Reds to regroup somewhat.\n\nThe ball actually rolls out to Villani on the right, he gets past one challenge and swings a cross into the penalty area.. and there’s Kean! The Italian gets the run on his marker and powers his header into the bottom corner before Alisson can even move. 1-1! Now let’s kick on, lads.\n\nOnce again, Liverpool don’t wilt and instead begin to create some chances of their own. Alexander Trent-Arnold is a threat down the wing but we’ve got plenty of cover to limit his options. This means he’s forced to pass inside to Kai Havertz.. but Foden intercepts. It’s three-on-three and Kean has made a great run down the middle.. but Foden opts against playing it.\n\nDamn you, Phil!\n\nThe former City man instead plays the ball down the right for Tal but Cannata, Liverpool’s left back, gets there first. However his first touch is awful so Tal pounces on the loose ball before smashing it goalwards.. and Alisson is unable to stop it! We’ve turned this match around in 12 second-half minutes. Cometh the hour, eh? An absolutely massive goal from Tal.\n\nNow it’s our turn to try and handle the pressure.\n\nSessegnon makes a fantastic header to deny Lewis Cook a golden opportunity to bring Liverpool immediately level. It’s then sent out wide to Trent who swings in one of his dangerous crosses but Sule belts it upfield.\n\nThe clearance actually goes all the way to the half-way line where Tal cushions his header into the path of Kean. The Italian has the pace on his two markers and reaches the box. Fabinho is closing down the angle and with no one to aim for across goal, his only option is to shoot. Kean swings his left boot at the ball and it flies towards Alisson’s near post.. he gets a hand to it.. but the power is too much and he can only push it onto the post.. and into the back of the net! 3-1! A Kean brace, plus a goal and assist from young Tal. What a turnaround! Could this be it?\n\nTal comes off for Tonali. Haidara replaced Gaillard earlier and we switch to a flat-looking 4-4-1-1 (it’s actually more of a 4-1-3-1-1). Kean is left upfront with Foden supporting him but our midfield is packed to absorb Liverpool’s attempts at getting back into the game. However, Pep Guardiola’s lack of attacking options mean he is forced to use Ilaix Moriba as an emergency striker.\n\nAnd there it is! The final whistle goes and Spurs are once again Champions League winners!\n\nThree finals in a row, two of which were successful, and we banished both the ghost of Pochettino’s past (Liverpool) as well as our own (PSG) along the way.\n\nThe fans, board and club legends are all happy with our achievements. There is, however, some bad news. Dembele’s knee injury is a serious one and he’ll be out for 5-7 months.\n\nAt 30 years old, this is one of those injuries that shortens a career. However we’ve got Troy to play backup to Kean and Tal until Moussa is ready to return. As long as I’m at the helm, Dembele has nothing to worry about. He’ll retire at Tottenham Hotspur.\n\nEnd of Season Awards\n\nMaybe Kean’s desire to move upset the fans as Tonali is the new favourite.\n\nAlthough Kean still sells more shirts than anyone else, so who knows?\n\nAnd he’s arguably the best striker in the world on my save.\n\nHere is the Champions League’s Best XI\n\nWhat happens next?\n\nThere are a host of budding youngsters coming through, both in the U18s and U23s sides, as well as those I’ve poached from around Europe. Oh, and I agreed to sign Neymar on a free transfer to boost the ‘sign high reputation players’ objective as part of the club’s vision. He’s happy to be an Impact Sub and can cover the attacking midfield role even with limited physical stats. Maybe he can retire at the Spurs just like Lionel Messi did.\n\nMy U23 side won the Premier League Cup (finished 2nd in the league) and the U18s won their league, won the Premier League Cup and the FA Youth Challenge Cup (they lost in the final of the UEFA Youth League).\n\nBruno Fernandes will be sold in the summer and I’m tempted to either promote Rice to captain (from vice) or hand the armband to someone like Kean, who has developed into a real leader of the team.\n\nSadly a lot of our original season signings are approaching the ends of their careers and, as such, it feels like the rebuilding part is over. The next era should be built in someone else’s vision. As I added to Poch’s groundwork, so must the man – or woman – who follows in my footsteps.\n\nFernandes, Ake, Sule, Dembele, Haidara and Lodi are all aged 29-32. The vast majority of the youngsters we brought in are about to enter their peaks and there’s a new crop of wonderkids ready to step up.\n\nWhat happens to our French star Gaillard? Will he establish himself as an icon at Spurs or look to rebuild PSG? Will Keran Tal be able to fill Dembele’s boots, just like Moussa did when Kane left? Those are questions for you to find the answer to, not me.\n\nWe’ve also contributed to the future of English football on a national level. Their most recent XI featured seven players who currently turn out for Tottenham, with a couple more on the bench and a few others who we’ve had a hand in their development. The Premier League is also ranked as the number one league in Europe, ousting LaLiga from top spot.\n\nThere’s almost 290M in club’s coffers so you won’t have to balance finances like we had to as the team forced their way into upper echelon of world football. I’ve asked Daniel Levy to expand the stadium and he’s kindly agreed. This will see the capacity extended to just over 70,000 going forward.\n\nOur matchday income is already insane and this should help sustain our place at the top. There’s a naming rights deal in place so that’s an extra wedge of cash every season to look forward to. Even my staff are the best in the league across every level.\n\nBasically, Spurs are set up to dominate football for the foreseeable future. It’s the perfect time to say goodbye.\n\nThank you to everyone who has followed the series, especially during the lulls of updates, and those who recently discovered the blogs during lockdown. I’m not sure what the next project will be. It would be interesting to try out the lower leagues and see if I’m able to learn, adapt and achieve success without the riches of the Premier League.\n\nMaybe I could take over at Scunthorpe United, my hometown team, and try to get them to the top of English football. Or perhaps we could switch countries and attempt to bring say Malaga, or Real Oviedo, back to LaLiga.\n\nThanks for the memories, Tottenham.\n\nIf you want to continue on the legacy of this Spurs side, here is the save game file for you to do just that: Download\n\nLet me know on Twitter how you got on, who you kept, who you sold, etc.\n\nBefore we get into the blog, I just wanted to give an insight to my current situation. Like many others during this outbreak/lockdown, my regular sources of income have taken a major hit. If you can afford to – and want to – please consider a pledge to my Patreon page here. The blogs won’t ever be put behind a paywall because we all need distractions right now. More importantly than anything else, please keep safe and stay inside as much as possible.\n\nThe January transfer window has closed and that means the current squad is the one tasked with turning this season into a glorious one. After moving on an unhappy Jan Oblak, handing Amadou Haidara a new contract and playing Reinier enough for him to ease his concerns, Ryan Sessegnon believes I broke my promise to him. I don’t get it. He played plenty. It doesn’t matter because I wouldn’t sell Sess even if the transfer window was still open. Might need to tweak his squad role at some point though. Once again, I feel compelled to question Bruno Fernandes’ leadership of this group.\n\nWe lose 1-0 to Huddersfield at home in the league because, well, Football Manager loves to create a rage moment in the ‘anything can happen’ virtual realm. That doesn’t really matter but losing 2-1 at the Camp Nou, despite taking the lead, does. Not least because their winner came in the 89th minute through Ruben Neves. Keran ‘The Chosen One’ Tal put us ahead before Bernando Silva equalised almost immediately after. Not a horrible result though.\n\nA narrow 1-0 victory over they-are-so-bad-it’s-actually-funny Chelsea sees us march on in the FA Cup before we complete something of a growing trend by losing ahead of a Champions League knockout tie. Leeds United claimed at three points at Elland Road to keep their top four hopes alive. Now it’s time to head over to Spain and face Harry Kane’s Barça side for the second season in a row.\n\nAnd, for the second season in a row, we absolutely smash the Catalan giants. Tal and a brace from Moise Kean give us a 3-0 lead before Ousmane Dembele pulls one back for the visitors on the stroke of half-time. I can’t fault the boys though as the contest is over with just over an hour on clock. Tal completes his hat-trick and books our place in the Quarter Final of the Champions League.\n\nThere’s more good news as Renan Lodi, Reinier and Claudio Trecco are coming back to full fitness as midweek matches become the norm again.\n\nThe Champions League draw has taken place and we’re paired with Thomas Tuchel’s Manchester City. The 1st leg is at home.\n\nPerhaps more interesting is if we get beyond our domestic rivals, it’ll be Hoffenheim or – brace yourselves – PARIS SAINT GERMAIN who await us in the semi-finals.\n\nAs for my Youth Intake, it’s a disappointing year. The best candidate is a centre back, the same as last time around, but there isn’t anyone you feel is going to set the football world alight in years to come. Naturally, I poach a lot of the best talent from around Europe to make up for that. The two Chelsea lads remain the best prospects in my U18s side.\n\nA rotation XI that includes Troy Parrott and Moussa Dembele does the job against Aston Villa in the FA Cup and we’re paired with Watford in the semi-finals. The Hornets started the season well but have fallen way, way off the pace and sit down in 11th.\n\nSpeaking of the club legend, I manage to get Dembele to sign a new deal – he had 12 months left on his existing one – and even take a pay cut. The World Cup winner actually wanted a pay rise, despite turning 30, but he eventually settled for 300,000 (25,000-per-week less). After all he’s done, I’m not going to complain. We’re 2M-per-week under our wage budget anyway.\n\nNathan Ake and Bruno Fernandes are in the same position. My current plan is to give the Dutch defender one last contract as he’s willing to accept a squad role but Fernandes has been disappointing. I’ve not been a fan of his leadership and think, at 32, it’s time to bid farewell to the Portuguese playmaker.\n\nManchester City come to the Tottenham Hotspur Stadium in good form. They’ve won 10 of their last 12, losing only to ourselves and Leicester City, both away from home.\n\nCamavinga puts us ahead early in the second half but less than 10 minutes later and City are level. Damn you, away goals. Fernandes is struggling and Tal isn’t having much luck in front of goal. Foden and Dembele, their replacements, immediately link up and the legend puts us ahead. He doubles his tally with five minutes to go to give us a 3-1 lead going into the return fixture. I could kiss you right now, Moussa.\n\nIn the build-up to that match, we inexplicably lose to then-bottom of the table Derby County. It was a heavily rotated XI as the Champions League is the priority this season but, yeah, I didn’t expect us to be outfought and outplayed by a Derby side who had won just once in their previous 17 league games.\n\nThere’s a slight change in our system for the match against City as I drop my attacking attacker into midfield in an attempt to offer more stability when we’ve got to defend. It doesn’t seem to impact our attacking threat as Kean gives us the lead after 16 minutes. That should be it. Max Aarons adds another immediately after half-time and that most definitely is it. The gamble paid off.\n\nPSG won the home leg 4-1 against Hoffenheim so everything suggests they will be our opponents in the semi-finals. As we click continue.. Hoffenheim did win.. but not by enough. They won 2-0, just one goal away from knocking the French side out on away goals. Our on-loan winger Jake O’Neill got on the scoresheet. This does mean it’ll be down to us to end our horrible run of form against PSG if we are to advance.\n\nA Tal brace helps us beat Watford 3-1 in the FA Cup semi-final (Aarons scored the other) before we finish off the month with London fixtures against Arsenal (A) and Fulham (H). Tal bags another two goals at the Emirates to see us strengthen our lead at the top of the Premier League table and also dent their hopes of making the top four. It does, however, come at a massive cost.\n\nBollocks.\n\nIt’s also nice to see Miguel D’Agonstino boosting the confidence of the players going into the PSG clash. I might have to reconsider who I send to all these press conferences if you keep this up, Miguel.\n\nThe 11 heros I send out to vanquish the ghost of Champions League past are Wells; Aarons, Harvey, Sule, Sessegnon; Rice, Haidara, Gaillard, Reinier, Kean and Dembele.\n\nFour minutes on the clock and Mbappe gives PSG the lead. I hate this game. Aarons first switches off at a throw-in and then Sess is out-muscled at the far post by Kylian. I wish I could’ve bashed their heads together rather than taking it out on my poor desk. Not again, lads. Not again. Por favor.\n\nThe reaction from the team is exactly what I wanted. PSG are being forced further back and all the chances are coming our way. Sessegnon races away down the left before cutting it back for Gaillard on the edge of the area. PSG have five defenders in the box so the world-class midfielder (no longer a ‘wonderkid’) smashes it across goal.. and into the top corner! What a goal! And against the side we poached him from four years ago!\n\nSadly our dominance (30-5 in shots, 13-2 on target) doesn’t translate to the final score and it finishes 1-1. On reflection, it’s a horrible result. We need to score in France and hope to keep PSG out, despite us failing to keep a clean sheet in the previous four matches against them.\n\nAs the world awaits the second leg against PSG, we beat West Ham – who are a point outside the relegation places – and Manchester United at home. The victory over United sees us secure the Premier League title with three matches to go. Five defeats in the competition is our worst record since seasons one and two when we finished 5th and 4th respectively.\n\nAfter an earful from me, Miguel is much better with his pre-match comments going into the PSG fixture. Así es, Miguelito. Así es.\n\nI make two changes for the second leg with Camavinga replacing Haidara and Foden coming in for Reinier. The Brazilian has really gone off the boil in the last couple of months.\n\nWe need someone to stand up and be a hero, someone to create a moment of magic that will go down in Tottenham history. You look to your Keans, Dembeles, Gaillards and Camavingas – this is when you prove your worth as the best around.\n\nAs we tick into the 27th minute the ball is with Sessegnon, who might still be questionable in defence but is a live wire going forward, and he charges down the left before crossing into the box. It goes beyond everyone to Aarons, who heads it towards goal from near the edge of the box. It evades Dembele and is too far ahead of Kean.. and goes into the net?! Kepa might have been unsighted or worried about someone getting a touch but who gives a shit? That is an absolutely HUGE goal from Max!\n\nLess than a minute later and PSG equalise. Bollocks. Sessegnon has been pulled out of position so Aaron Wan-Bissaka is in acres of space down the right. He sends in a low cross that (newgen) Dole pokes past Wells. Whatever happens, we’re incapable of keeping a clean sheet against PSG. 1-1 after 28 minutes.\n\nDespite the lapse in concentration, our defence is performing well. It’s in the final third where it just isn’t clicking. Not for us or, thankfully, PSG. Eriksen is hooked for the home side at half-time but we wait until the hour mark to bring on Troy Parrott and (newgen) Lucas Alves – another PSG academy graduate – for Dembele and Foden. Gaillard and Camavinga are continuing to pull the strings in midfield.\n\nIt finishes 1-1 and the match is going to extra time. The most surprising thing I’ve noticed from Ancelotti is he’s taken off both Mbappe and Florentino Luis for Cengiz Under and Rodri. Not sure about that one, Carlo.\n\nThe first half of extra time is incident-free but we’ve got possession as the match enters the 105th minute. There are tired legs everywhere but Gaillard and Camavinga continue to search for openings. Eventually the latter sprays it out wide to Sessegnon on the left. He gets to the area before crossing to the penalty spot. Alves volleys it at goal but his effort is blocked by a defender.. only into the path of Troy. The man, the myth, the legend has the entire stadium silent. Without even thinking he smashes it towards the near post.. and Kepa.. can’t get there! WE LEAD 2-1 IN EXTRA TIME!\n\nPSG need two goals now in the final 15 minutes.\n\nAlves drops deeper into midfield, Tonali replaces Rice and Ake comes on (for Camavinga) to play as the anchor man, sitting in front of the defence.\n\nIt’s all PSG, as you’d expect, but Sule, Tonali, Aarons and Alves put their bodies on the line. Every highlight ended with a block by one of those guys. Maybe it was because of all the history with PSG, maybe it was the occasion. Whatever it was: the team gave absolutely everything they had.\n\nAND WE ARE THROUGH TO THE CHAMPIONS LEAGUE FINAL FOR THE THIRD YEAR IN A ROW!\n\nIn that final we’ll face.. Pep Guardiola’s Liverpool. They beat Atletico home and away in the other semi-final and I gotta say, I feel confident. Since 2021, we’ve only lost against them on neutral ground once. Sure, it came earlier this season in the Community Shield, but no one really cares about that.\n\nAnd isn’t it ironic that we’ve come full circle with these two sides meeting in the final again? Rebuilding Tottenham, baby.\n\nSo we are left with what could turn out to be the very last entry in this project. An FA Cup final against Manchester United and a Champions League final against Liverpool is what awaits us.\n\nTo dare is to do.\n\nBefore we get into the blog, I just wanted to give an insight to my current situation. Like many others during this outbreak/lockdown, my regular sources of income have taken a major hit. If you can afford to – and want to – please consider a pledge to my Patreon page here. The blogs won’t ever be put behind a paywall because we all need distractions right now. More importantly than anything else, please keep safe and stay inside as much as possible.\n\nThe defeat to Paris Saint Germain in the Champions League final hurt. Not because there’s any shame in losing to the French kingpins but because it was supposed to be the happy ending for this generation of Tottenham players. And, in a way, it would have solidified our own legacy and not made the previous season’s triumph not look like a fluke. Now we’ll have to deal with an ambitious squad that will question whether we’ve already peaked and if it’s the right time to search for a new challenge.\n\nSounds familiar, doesn’t it?\n\nBut like Mauricio before me – remember, the Jose Mourinho era doesn’t exist in this virtual world – I’m not going to walk away when there’s still work to be done. There won’t be a massive overhaul of first-team stars because this group is good enough to challenge on all fronts but there are a few big earners who are nearing the end of their current contracts.\n\nReal Madrid offer a deal worth up to 113M for Reinier whereas Barça go a bit higher and feel 119M for Kean is a fair price. I don’t want to lose either of them so I demand over 200M for each and the bids are subsequently removed. Fine by me!\n\nHowever, that doesn’t necessarily mean I am against streamlining the squad. Brace yourselves, an exodus is coming:\n\nMost of those moved on are U23 players who aren’t good enough to make the step up or who don’t have a natural role in my system. Hoogervorst has all the stats to be world class but with Kean, Dembele, Parrott and young Tal infront of him it feels like I’d end up stunting his development. 47.5M is a fantastic fee though.\n\nFabbri and Karamoko Dembele are right wingers – “I don’t do wingers” – and their sales cause another issue.\n\nBruno Fernandes, my captain, is suddenly concerned about the lack of depth on the right wing. We haven’t used wingers, even as a rotational option, for about three years but the fiery Portuguese playmaker is worried. To compound that, 26 players share his concern. Are you kidding me, lads?\n\nI’m actually trying to sell another winger, this time it’s 21-year-old Lamine Negi, but only Porto made a bid and it’s 10.5M. Nah. I then transfer-list Negi and, for reasons only known to Benfica, I receive a 76M offer for the French winger’s services. I’ve never clicked the accept button so quickly. Sorry Bruno.\n\nMy man management skills also take a knock as I go on to upset Amadou Haidara. The Mali star wants a new deal, which is fair enough, but he’s after 320,000-per-week. I can’t stretch that far and he’s complaining to his teammates. After some time to cool off, I promise we’ll restart negotiations. When we do, both sides fail to agree on terms. Now I’ve apparently broken too many promises and he wants to leave. Okay. This is fine.\n\nThe start of the season produces mixed results. We lost to Liverpool in the Community Shield, then lost to the scousers again in the Premier League. I decided to give Chris Wells the number one shirt at Spurs after Oblak missed three weeks of the season through injury. Naturally, Wells was then ruled out for a month himself. Football Manager things.\n\nKeran Tal, who I want to start ahead of the ageing – and sadly declining Moussa Dembele – broke his ankle at the World Cup so didn’t begin playing until the end of September. Moise Kean also had a spell on the sidelines but my striker options are never a concern.\n\nSpeaking of club legend Moussa, he actually scored in the World Cup final. His incredible club form hasn’t transitioned to the national team. In fact, he’s often overlooked (not sure why) but it was nice to see the guy add yet another magical moment to his glittering career.\n\nThe tournament also saw Aurelien Gaillard, the French boy wonder, announce his arrival on the scene. He scooped two awards for his performances in the tournament.\n\nI forgot to mention that the fine coaching staff we’ve amassed is drawing interest both domestically and internationally. Joao Tralhao, who’s been with me since season two, is poached by Southampton. Good luck, Joao.\n\nBy the end of October, we are top of the Premier League but only by a point. Wolves, under the tutelage of Erik Ten Hag now, are challenging us for the title. They’ve got a nice blend of experience and youth in their squad.\n\nTal is our joint-top scorer, despite missing the first couple of months, and is level with Dembele on 6. Even more impressive is those 6 goals for Tal have come in just three league appearances so he’s averaging a goal every 45 minutes. Moise Kean is only on 4.\n\nAs for Europe, which has to be the main objective for us this season, we were drawn in a group alongside Slavia Prague, Lille and Real Madrid. It’s going well so far and I think this result will put a smile on everybody’s face.\n\nAs we enter November, three of my staff inform me they’ll be retiring at the end of the season. Jan Wouters (U18 Assistant Manager), Norbert Elgert (U23 Assistant Manager) and Bryan Klug (Head of Youth Development) have handed in their notices. Two of those are long-serving members of my team. Wouters was one of my first signings at the club and Elgert has worked with the U23 side since 2020.\n\nAnother departure, this one immediate, is that of Pepijn Lijnders. When Klopp got sacked by Liverpool in 2022, I added the Dutchman to my coaching staff. He now feels the time is right to branch off on his own and help save Nottingham Forest from relegation in the Championship.\n\nPatience isn’t a quality I possess on Football Manager so I waste no time in bringing in PSG’s Head of Youth Development, Jochen Sauer, and Federico Di Placido to replace Lijnders.\n\nOblak is unhappy because he wants to start more games. Reinier has the same issue. I’ve got quality across the park so I’m finding it difficult to give my all squad adequate playing time. Yet Bruno, my (dis)loyal captain, is worried about right wingers.\n\nWe are still topping the league by a single point, have already secured top spot in our Champions League group and are through to the Quarter Final of the League Cup (vs Crystal Palace). The FA Cup draw will see us face either Stevenage or Scunthorpe United(!). Got my fingers crossed for the Iron. Two stand-out results in the Premier League were thanks to our new Tal-isman.\n\nManchester United absolutely crush us 4-0 at Old Trafford. I think that might be the heaviest defeat I’ve suffered in eight seasons at Spurs. Brutal collapse from the boys. Thankfully, Wolves have lost two on the spin themselves so we don’t lose top spot.\n\nScunny beat Stevenage so they’ll be our opponents in the FA Cup 3rd Round. We’re going home, baby. The Champions League 1st Knockout Round draw isn’t as king though as we get Barça. Time for you to come home again, Harry. The Catalan giants came 2nd in their group to Manchester City. Elsewhere on-loan Jake O’Neill has helped Hoffenheim qualify for the KO rounds, as well as lead the way in the Bundesliga. PSG, our arch nemesis, got drawn against Zenit. Hot balls anyone?\n\nNow Sessegnon wants more playing time. Seriously, this kind of revolt would never have happened under Henderson’s tenure at the club. Thankfully, whilst everyone wants to piss and moan at Spurs the chasing pack continues to slip up.\n\nAs we enter January, there are a couple of new faces added to the squad. The most high profile of those is an exciting Brazilian full back called Jose Roberto, who can also play on the right of midfield. The others are more with an eye on the future. Although I will point out that my Director of Football actually signed one of them: a young Scottish striker called Dean Martin (“The King of Cool”). He looks really good too.\n\nOh, and you might be glad to know that after seven seasons Daniel Levy finally agreed a naming rights deal for the Tottenham Hotspur stadium. 20M per season. Hopefully it doesn’t take that long in real life.\n\nWe breeze past Scunny and are rewarded with a home tie against Liverpool later in the month. A 2-1 victory over Chelsea at Stamford Bridge sees us complete the league double over them. John Terry was in charge of the Blues for the home tie and we’ve just dampened the mood under new coach Zinedine Zidane. We also squeeze past Pep Guardiola’s Liverpool in the FA Cup.\n\nIt isn’t all good news though as Jan Oblak remains unhappy about his playing time. What’s irritating about this is I actually made a massive effort to give him regular games and he still complains. Maybe it’s time to move on big Jan, especially as Chrissy Wells is now considered a better goalkeeper than him. We also lose another coach to a managerial post. Newgen Marco Perri take overs at affiliate club Charlton.\n\nOur defence of the Carabao Cup is ended by apparent bogey-side Manchester United. We drew 0-0 at Old Trafford but then lost 1-0 at home. Not an excuse but it’s by far the least important of the competitions we are involved in.\n\nAs the season enters February, it’s time to finish off the winter transfer window. Celtic launch a bid for Oblak and the keeper is desperate for a new challenge. In an ideal world it’d be nice to see him end the season with us but, as was the case with Kane, the fair decision is to let him go. We’ll be paying half of his 230,000-a-week wages but will rake in 30.5M for 34-year-old Jan.\n\nJames Terry, one of our academy graduates, is sold to Southampton for 18.5M. He’s been a solid performer but now finds himself as fifth-choice centre back. Barry Kerslake is another academy graduate who spent last season on loan with Charlton. Unfortunately, he doesn’t look good enough to make our first team squad either. Newcastle United offer 40M and that’s probably 20M more than I expected. We also loan out Lucas Eduardo, my rash January signing from last season, to Real Madrid for six months.\n\nIn terms of incomings, I toy with the idea of signing Paul Pogba on a free transfer from PSG. The board want high reputation players but he’s 33 now, so I’m torn. We do bring in a solid goalkeeper to be third choice now that Oblak has departed the club. And, as is commonplace in every winter window, I sign a right back – who can also play on the wing. There’s also three world-class options to choose from so why not make it four? He’ll spend the rest of the season at Real Betis but welcome to the family, Eduardo Dumpierrez.\n\nWe are drawn against Chelsea in the 5th Round of the FA Cup. As for the internal issues with the squad, I manage to negotiate a new deal with Haidara for much less than the 325,000 he originally wanted (195,000) but he still won’t remove his transfer request. Okay. I have added him back to my Champions League squad though.\n\nIt’s been an injury-ridden start to 2027 for Camavinga. The midfielder has only made three appearances (of the 10 matches available) so far. He’s currently out for another two weeks.\n\nKean is ahead of Tal on the top scorers chart with 14 to Tal’s 13, although he has started eight matches more than the young English striker. Perhaps a concerning stat is the lack of assists from my midfield. Out-of-favour Haidara is highest with five, the same as Lodi, but where are Fernandes, Reinier or Foden?\n\nDespite all that, we remain top of the Premier League after a last-minute victory over Manchester City at the Etihad Stadium. Rotten runs of form for early front-runners Norwich and Wolves mean they’ve slipped down the standings with more familiar faces United and Liverpool rounding off the top three.\n\nI hope you’ve enjoyed this streamlined update as we power through the campaign much more quickly. It’s time to enter the business end of the season with Barça next up in the Champions League, as well as Chelsea in the FA Cup.\n\nCome on you Spurs.\n\nBefore we get into the blog, I just wanted to give an insight to my current situation. Like many others during this outbreak/lockdown, my regular sources of income have taken a major hit. If you can afford to – and want to – please consider a pledge to my Patreon page here. The blogs won’t ever be put behind a paywall because we all need distractions right now. More importantly than anything else, please keep safe and stay inside as much as possible.\n\nParis Saint Germain have been our kryptonite throughout this entire save. We’ve managed to beat every top side we’ve faced with except for the French champions. To go even further, we haven’t even managed a draw. This is, in many ways, the version of PSG that their fans dreamt of. It’s the one sold to them ever since they were bought by Qatar Sports Investments. None of their stars have left, not even the 34-year-old Neymar, and Spurs old boy Christian Eriksen remains a key part of their midfield.\n\nPSG have invested heavily in the squad but there’s no deadwood like the current one. It’s rock solid. 2026 saw them raise the Ligue 1 trophy for the ninth season in a row. As mentioned in a previous entry, the French giants finally broke their Champions League duck in 2023. They also have one of the best, if not the best, academies on the save. There’s a 20-year-old centre back in the first team who is arguably the best defender in the world right now.\n\nTheir starting XI for the Champions League final includes plenty of recognisable names too. Kepa Arrizabalaga; Wan-Bissaka, Marquinhos, Roussel (the defender I mentioned), Reguilon; Florentino Luis, Pogba; Salah, Eriksen, Gaillard (no relation to our wonderkid); Mbappe. On the bench you’ll find Rodri, Pedrinho, Junior Firpo, Neymar, Carles Aleña and Xavi Simons. Hirving Lozano is injured and Cengiz Under was simply left out. Stacked.\n\nEduardo Camavinga is passed fit but hasn’t returned to full training yet. There’s less good news when it comes to Trecco and Gaillard. Firstly, the Argentine picked up a thigh strain in the week leading up to the final. It was a similar story for my French wonderkid, already valued at 69M, with his injury being minor but serious enough to force him out of the squad. Not ideal but hey, it is what it is.\n\nMy XI for the Final is Oblak; Aarons, Sule, Harvey, Lodi; Rice, Haidara, Camavinga, Reinier; Kean and Dembele.\n\nWith just two minutes on the clock, Lodi whips in a freekick but Kean’s header goes wide. A nice, energetic start. I like it.\n\nPSG force their first opportunity on goal on the 10-minute mark. After some good work down the right flank, Salah crosses to Pogba on the edge of the box. His effort is hit with a lot of power but whistles over the bar.\n\nNearly all of our chances are coming from set-pieces. Lodi finds Dembele this time but it’s a poor header from the club legend. He must do better.\n\nWith 20 minutes gone, Reguilon sends his cross to the front post and Mbappe’s header is inches away from giving PSG the lead. As if anybody expected any different, this is going to be decided by fine margins.\n\nKean is putting in a shift down the left hand side and plays it to Camavinga, who has space inside the box. He knocks the ball across to Dembele and the legend smacks it towards the top corner.. but Kepa denies him with a wonderful save. That was the first real chance of the game.\n\nWe are growing into the game here after a shaky start. Much better lads.\n\n30 minutes in and Wan-Bissaka finally gets the beating of Lodi. He speeds into the box, looks up and sends it deep to Gaillard, who has been left unmarked by Aarons, and the tall winger beats Oblak with ease. The Ligue 1 giants lead after 35 minutes.\n\nOur momentum has gone now. The half finishes with wave after wave of PSG attacks.\n\nI’m not a happy chappy at half-time and make two changes. Dembele just isn’t working this season. I don’t know if it’s to do with age catching up with him or niggling injuries taking their toll. Keran Tal is thrown on to partner Kean upfront. In midfield, Haidara – not the half-fit Camavinga – is hooked for Tonali.\n\nThe first opportunity of the second half goes to PSG. Thankfully Sule, my absolute monster in defence, stops Wan-Bissaka and whacks it down the line for Kean. The Italian stallion powers forward but only has Tal to aim for in the box. Instead, he cuts it back for Rice who hits it first time.. but Kepa pushes it away! Another fantastic stop from the former Chelsea man.\n\nIt’s such an open game which, I suppose, benefits us. PSG’s latest attack is broken up by Aarons and he spots Tal in acres of space on the half-way line. A bit like Kean moments earlier, there isn’t much to aim for after reaching the box. He stops, turns back and finds Aarons charging forward. The former Norwich man powers his effort towards goal.. and Kepa denies him! I hate you, Kepa.\n\nWe are finally beginning to show what we’re capable of now. Marquinhos dallies in possession and Kean robs the ball off his toes. There’s just open space between the Italian and a chance on goal. Young Roussel keeps up with him but there’s more to Kean’s game than just (a lot of) goals. He lays it back for the supporting Rice and his thunder-bastard is destined for the top corner.. and Kepa is beaten! That was magnificent and fully deserved.\n\nBruno Fernandes replaces Camavinga who doesn’t have anything else left in the tank.\n\nWe are being so, so wasteful from our seemingly endless amount of set-pieces. Lodi and Fernandes’ deliveries are on point but our finishing is wayward.\n\nThe real chances to score seem to come from open play. Fernandes pinches possession from Wan-Bissaka and swings in a wonderful cross, one centre forwards dream of seeing, and Tal is there.. but his header goes narrowly over the bar. Was that the chance to wrap it up inside 90 minutes?\n\nFernandes has been sensational since coming on.\n\nAfter Rice regains possession for us in injury-time, he finds the Portuguese playmaker and the ball is sent forward to Tal. The youngster continues his run into the box and finds Kean.. but he can’t find the room to get his shot away. It goes back to Rice, who sprays it out wide to Aarons, and the full-back only has one thing on his mind: shoot. He winds up and hits it as sweet as you like and it’s flying towards the top corner.. it beats Kepa.. but smashes off the post!\n\nAnd that is the end of 90 minutes.\n\nAarons comes off at the start of extra time because he’s running on fumes but Villani is an able replacement. PSG have moved Mbappe to the right of attack, brought on a young striker called Dole as well as the veteran Neymar.\n\nMost of the chances continue to fall our way but there’s a lot of tired legs on display. Neither keeper is forced into making a save. The final bit of action is marred by two injuries. Wan-Bissaka takes out Villani and both are forced off.\n\nPenalties it is.\n\nMbappe steps up for PSG. The talisman. He aims right.. and Oblak denies him! Magnificant from the loveable Slovenian. Kean is first for us, our talisman. He smashes it left, Kepa goes right.. but it cannons off the post. YOU CANNOT WRITE THIS SCRIPT.\n\nNeymar goes the same way as Mbappe, Oblak guesses right, but the Brazilian’s effort is too good. 1-0 PSG. Up steps our experienced man, Bruno Fernandes, and he doesn’t miss. 1-1.\n\nPogba scores. 2-1 PSG. Young Tal has volunteered to go next for Spurs. He looks calm. Like Kean, he goes left.. Kepa goes right.. but like Kean his effort comes back off the post. Bollocks. We need you to do something special again, Jan.\n\nPedrinho is PSG’s third spot-kick taker. He shoots right down the middle.. and Oblak stands tall! It remains 2-1 but Lodi has the chance to bring us level. He takes a deep breath and goes to his right.. Kepa dives that way.. but it goes in! 2-2. I can’t watch.\n\nReguilon is the man PSG are trusting to put the pressure back on us. Cool as you want, the full back slots it into the bottom corner. Oblak went the wrong way. 3-2 PSG.\n\nIt’s all down to.. Joseph Harvey. Our new centre back signing is showing balls of steel here. He has to shut out the noise, try to reduce the pressure on his shoulders. One last deep breath. He hits it hard enough.. but Kepa pushes it away.\n\nPSG have won the Champions League on penalties. They make it three wins out of three against Tottenham Hotspur and lift the European trophy for the second time.\n\nFor the first time during this entire save, there was no doubt we were the best team in Europe. We didn’t need a kind draw or fortune to favour us.\n\nSpurs crushed Barça and Atletico Madrid in the big quarter-final and semi-final ties. And tonight, for long periods of the game, we outclassed a strong PSG side. Aarons was denied a last-gasp winner and then both Kean and Tal hit the woodwork from the spot. Lady luck wasn’t on our side.\n\nIn the aftermath of PSG’s celebrations, young Harvey said he would step up again if asked. Great attitude. But right now, it still hurts.\n\nEnd of Season Awards\n\nMoussa Dembele has finally been ousted as the Fans’ Player of the Year. Don’t worry, he’s still firmly in the legends column. Declan Rice has really stepped up and absolutely loves the club too. Kean makes sense due to his incredible goal return (49 in all competitions) and Tonali is somewhat of an unsung hero. Not to the fans though.\n\nDembele remains the top shirt-seller amongst the squad, even with a below-average campaign. Surprised to see Foden so high. I guess supporters love themselves an English superstar.\n\nOur 2025/26 season review was so close to perfection. I’ve never seen a return like this since I used to scumsave – what the kids call reloading a save if you get a bad result – in my teenage years. Then again, perfection doesn’t quite align with the Tottenham way.\n\nI really don’t think you can put into context just how good Kean has been. He scored 27 goals in the Premier League, 13 in the Champions League. He also topped the assists chart for the year (16). The very definition of a complete striker. I’m so happy his name appeared when I searched for players similar to Harry Kane. As much as it pains me to say it, we haven’t missed Harry at all.\n\nAfter the Premier League and Champions League payouts, our finances don’t look too bad. A huge 224.5M is added to the kitty. At one point this season we slipped to 60M in the red. That was the lowest its been since 2023 (74M in the red at that time).\n\nWhat happens next?\n\nI don’t want to finish this series on a negative but there will probably be a change with how I do the blogs. There isn’t anything left to achieve in the Premier League, or even in the domestic cup competitions really.\n\nWhilst the emergence of newgens and talented kids is great, I want the core to be those we initially brought in and have seen grow at the club. Jordan Henderson and Virgil van Dijk were much older when we signed them so moving them on doesn’t really matter, but we let Nelson Semedo go last summer. Oblak (33), Fernandes (31), Ake (31), Sule (30) and Dembele (29) are all either approaching their peak or near the end of it.\n\nThe plan was to rebuild Tottenham Hotspur into a force to be reckoned with. We did that. However, there won’t be a rebuilding process once these experienced figures have departed. There’s probably 2-3 seasons left to do that but I know this save has gone on longer than you or I expected it to. As such, it deserves a fitting ending. After that, you can download the save and take over the next rebuild if you want.\n\nWe’ll return on Monday or Wednesday, I’m not sure yet, with a more streamlined version of season eight. Whilst an agonising defeat in a European final might have been the moment Mauricio Pochettino’s project fell short, I’m confident we can bid farewell on better terms.\n\nUnless, you know, Levy decides to cut us short.\n\nBefore we get into the blog, I just wanted to give an insight to my current situation. Like many others during this outbreak/lockdown, my regular sources of income have taken a major hit. If you can afford to – and want to – please consider a pledge to my Patreon page here. The blogs won’t ever be put behind a paywall because we all need distractions right now. More importantly than anything else, please keep safe and stay inside as much as possible.\n\nIt’s crunch time. This is potentially the defining season of the entire save so far with Tottenham Hotspur. We’ve won the Premier League with weeks to spare as well as every single final to date. Aside from the league, every other trophy we’ve picked up has been minor or something you would expect from this dominant team. Yet the two competitions that remain undecided will provide stern tests. Not of our quality, but of our mental strength. Do we want to be simply great or legendary?\n\nManchester City have been the undisputed FA Cup kings throughout the seven seasons we’ve been in charge of Tottenham. They’ve won three of the six campaigns to date and it was us who stopped them from making it four-in-a-row. Two years it was the other side of Manchester, the red half, who denied us in the final. And in a similar pattern, Liverpool then beat United in the 24/25 season’s curtain call. Retaining the FA Cup isn’t as easy as City made it look.\n\nAtletico Madrid also have history with the Champions League. And no, I’m not talking about their agonising final defeats to Real Madrid. In the 2019/20, season one of this save, Diego Simeone’s men finally got the monkey off their back by beating PSG in the final. Instead of catapulting them into becoming European juggernauts, the wheels fell off. Three quarter-final exits were followed by a Round of 32 defeat to Liverpool and last year they didn’t even make it out of the group stages. This time around they mean business.\n\nAlthough we did smash them 8-0 in the group stage. Just throwing that out there.\n\nFA Cup semi-final vs Manchester City\n\nCity are first up and I never like facing them on neutral ground. Home advantage is a genuine thing, even in the virtual world. It’s worth remembering we’ve already thrown away a 2-0 lead against this lot at Wembley. Thankfully, we went on to beat them in the penalty shootout of the Carabao Cup final.\n\nSandro Tonali has been extremely consistent ever since he joined in season two but his form in the rotated side has been sensational. He anchors the midfield with Declan Rice on the bench. Chris Wells is fully fit and will remain our cup keeper. The full XI is Wells; Villani, Harvey, Sule, Sessegnon; Tonali, Haidara, Gaillard, Fernandes; Kean and Parrott.\n\nIt’s a feeling out process at the beginning but thankfully the first chance falls to us. Tonali, my other Italian stallion, switches play to the left and finds Sessegnon. He spots Moise Kean hanging off the back of the last defender and loops a long ball to him. Kean brings it down with his left before powering a right-footed effort beyond Sousa. Another fine start.\n\nFive minutes later and this time it’s City’s turn to put the pressure on. De Bruyne floats in a corner that ‘the new Messi’ Cristian Palacios heads towards goal. As Wells moves to block the striker’s effort, Skriniar manages to deflect the ball in the opposite direction. 1-1. That didn’t last long.\n\nAs much as it pains me to admit, City are the better side here. De Bruyne is still a creative genius at 34 years of age and Palacios, well, I want him in my side.\n\nWe make a triple substitution on the hour mark, standard football management here folks, as I look to spark the team into life. Gaillard, Fernandes and Parrott make way for Camavinga, Foden and young Keran Tal. There’s an improvement, sure, but the scoreline remains 1-1 as we complete 90 minutes. I don’t think Spurs are capable of lucking out in two penalty shootouts in one season.\n\nOn the cusp of half-time in extra time, Harvey sends it long towards Tal. The forward, who I have great hopes for next season, wins the flick-on. Kean darts ahead of Skriniar and smashes it past Sousa. What a hit and what an important goal.\n\nEarly in the second half, City’s woes are compounded by the fact their right back is sent off for a second bookable offence – and then Kean puts an end to the contest. He’s freed down the left against a makeshift full back before swinging in a cross towards the penalty spot. Running onto the ball is Rice, a former City man himself, who volleys it into the bottom corner. 3-1. We’re going back to Wembley one more time!\n\nIn the lead up to facing Atletico at home, I name a rotated side for Chelsea’s visit to North London. We throw away a 2-0 lead to draw 2-2. Erling Haaland scores in the 90th minute. That man and his last-minute goals. He’s a cheat code, I swear.\n\n1st leg vs Atletico Madrid (Tottenham Hotspur Stadium)\n\nOblak returns for the first leg against his former side. Young Terry replaces Harvey in central defence due to a knock. Declan Rice returns to anchor the midfield with Tonali moving slightly ahead of him. Camavinga comes in too with Reinier replacing Bruno Fernandes at the point of the diamond. Kean and Dembele, just like old times, lead the attack.\n\nWe are in control of the opening 30 minutes but are yet to fashion a clear-cut opportunity. Perhaps Atleti have learnt their lesson from a few months ago. This is a good start though.\n\n…\n\nLemar sends in a freekick from the byline and Oblak charges out to catch the ball.. but he misses it! Benjamin Nygren, another one of those players I really need to search for in real life, has the simplest of tasks and heads the ball into an empty net. Jan, mate. We’re 1-0 down at home because of another set piece disasterclass. Seriously, that explains the majority of our European failures to date! Bloody hell.\n\nReinier didn’t make the most of his opportunity and is hooked for Fernandes at half-time. 20 minutes later and there’s still no change in the scorelines. Dembele picks up a knock so I roll the dice and bring on Tal and Gaillard, the French wonderkid replacing a tired Tonali. Come on, lads. Not like this. Not after I brought up smashing these guys 8-0!\n\nMy little virtual man is constantly demanding more from the team. He – and I – ain’t happy. After a quick throw-in, Kean plays the ball back for Sessegnon on the left flank. He searches for Tal but the striker is beaten to the ball by the Atleti centre back. It comes back to Kean on the edge of the box, he takes a couple of steps forward before curling it.. into the bottom corner! Now my virtual manager is kissing the Italian stallion’s head, akin to Blanc and Barthez. Cometh the hour, cometh the man!\n\nNow the momentum is fully on our side and Atleti’s confidence is dented. We push and push but, to the LaLiga side’s credit, they’ve been pretty solid at the back this time around. It took a moment of magic to get us back into the contest.\n\nThe match edges towards its conclusion but we have a corner. Fernandes aims for the penalty spot but it’s cleared to the edge of the box. Terry heads it across for Camavinga and, with the ball slightly behind him, the Congolese superstar manages to get a shot away. Pavlenka, either unsighted or worried Kean might deflect the ball in another direction, stands still and.. it rolls into the bottom corner! We lead with just three minutes to go!\n\nA much-needed advantage but the tie remains very much in the balance.\n\n2nd leg vs Atletico Madrid (Wanda Metropolitano)\n\nHarvey is fit enough for the second leg but Dembele has to make do with a place on the bench. Haidara, someone you might have noticed wasn’t involved in either of the matches so far, is also regaining full fitness after suffering a pulled abdominal muscle in training. Troy the Boy is injured so Tal partners Kean up top. In midfield, I opt for Trecco to add extra muscle alongside Camavinga.\n\nAn early goal would do us the world of good here to cancel out their strike in North London.\n\nAs has been quite commonplace this season, the first chance does come our way. We are trying to pass it around Atletico’s high press before the ball eventually goes to Trecco. He immediately pings it forward to young Tal. Showing wisdom beyond his ages, the young striker gets his head up and notices Kean in the penalty area. The cross is perfect and.. Kean sweeps his shot into the bottom corner! We’re ahead at the Wanda! For those relatively new to the series, Tal was actually poached from Everton so our attacking duo both have Merseyside connections.\n\nThe home side are in a state of shock, as am I. Away goals can be so big in these matches.\n\nChances are exchanged before we reach the 30th minute. Sessegnon throws it to Kean, who finds a bit of space and threads it to the lurking Camavinga. The only man in the box is Tal and he’s surrounded by four defenders. Simeone would be proud. So instead, Camavinga evades the challenge of the onrushing defender and lets fly with a thunderous effort.. that goes into the top corner! Unbelievable Jeff! That’s two big strikes in both legs of this tie for the Congolese midfielder.\n\nAs we go into the dressing room at half-time I don’t know what to say. They have turned this around and then some. Atletico need to score four to beat us and not even my managerial shortcomings are that bad. No one deserves to come off just yet. Foden is doing okay but we’ll give him until the hour mark. Three players are on a booking – Aarons, Harvey and Rice – which isn’t ideal.\n\nI expect we’ll have to weather something of a storm in the early stages of the second half but the team is in such a strong position. There’s no need to panic.\n\nAarons is kicked but manages to keep hold of the ball. Cool head, Max. He plays it back to Rice, who finds Aarons, who finds Trecco. The Argentine was a surprise starter but, like Tonali, has impressed with the rotation side. He returns it to the full-back, who sends the ball into Tal’s feet. He shoots.. but it’s blocked. The ball falls back to him and the striker smashes it in at the near post! 3-0 at the Wanda. IN-CRE-ÍBLE! That’s it. We’re going to another European final.\n\nAlvaro Morata comes off the bench and scores a consolation goal for Atletico with 10 minutes to go. Kean and Reinier, on for Foden, make sure the scoreline finishes heavily in our favour though. After beating Barça 5-1 in London, we’ve just beaten Atleti 5-1 on their own patch. For the record, these are the current top two sides in LaLiga.\n\nWe will face Arsenal in the FA Cup final and PSG in the Champions League decider. We’ve had the Gunners’ number in recent times but the Ligue 1 giants have a 100% record against us. In that same season, the 2022/23 campaign, they went on to win the competition. Damn.\n\nFA Cup Final vs Arsenal\n\nOur North London neighbours stand in our way of making it a clean sweep (domestically). The most depressing part of the build up is losing Eduardo Camavinga for three weeks immediately following the Atletico result. He’s a serious doubt for the Champions League final too. This means our XI is as follows: Wells; Villani, Harvey, Sule, Sessegnon; Rice, Trecco, Gaillard, Reinier; Kean and Tal. On the bench are Oblak, Aarons, Ake, Tonali, Haidara, Fernandes and Dembele.\n\nIt’s a nervous start from both sides. Arsenal have a corner and it’ll be taken by one of their originals: Lucas Torreira. The Uruguayan swings it to the back post and Jonathan Tah, clearly not an original, powers his header towards goal and it beats Oblak.. but crashes back off the bar! Yikes. Don’t make me replace you again, Jan.\n\nThere isn’t a good opening for us until the 30th minute. Gaillard is 35 yards out but is confident of testing Angus Gunn in goal. I’ll be honest, I hadn’t even noticed he was starting. A quick glance at Arsenal’s squad shows Leno injured himself by falling over the day before the final. Gaillard’s effort is a decent one but Gunn palms it around the post.\n\nNow I’m far from unbiased here but we’ve been the better side. Defences are proving king so far with last-ditch blocks and tackles preventing any other real chances of note.\n\nSpeaking of kings, I bring on Dembele for Tal as we might need a bit of experience to break down this Arsenal backline.\n\nVillani is proving to be a menace down the right with his pace. As for the Gunners, Tah is a constant threat from every set piece. I bring on Haidara for Trecco as we need less muscle and more intelligent in the centre of the park.\n\nWe’re about to enter the final 10 minutes and Arsenal are still defending for their lives. The switches in play need to be quicker. A throw-in from the left eventually ends up with Haidara, on the right, and he passes it forward to Villani. The Argentine darts into the box, narrowing the angle, before putting all his power behind a shot.. and it flies past Gunn at his near post!\n\nWould Leno have stopped it? I don’t know. Nor do I care. COYS!\n\nFernandes comes on for Reinier and drops a little deeper. No need to take any risks at this point. We don’t want to see any more goals.\n\nBut there is one!\n\nArsenal’s counterattacks keep falling down at the final moment but they have shown on various occasions that they like a late, late goal. Olivier Ntcham looks to change that by running through my non-existent midfield. He plays it to Traore but his first touch is heavy and Sessegnon recovers possession.\n\nRyan looks up and sends it long for Kean. The Italian stallion only has Dembele for support but continues to push Arsenal’s defence back. He reaches the edge of the penalty area, cuts inside and sends in a searching cross.. which Dembele nods past Gunn! 2-0! We’re going to win the FA Cup!\n\nTwo goals in five minutes (79th & 84th) give us a deserved victory.\n\nAccording to the media, this means we’ve won the quintuple! Oh, okay then.\n\nMy finances are still a major concern. We’re 37M in the red despite raking in a whopping 73M this month. I’d really, really love for Daniel Levy to find a stadium sponsorship deal to ease the bleeding of cash at the club. It’s probably a wise idea to move on some of my higher earners that are either getting too old or I’m shipping out on loan every season.\n\nThis blog has already reached the 2500 word limit which means the Champions League final against PSG will have to wait until next time. But don’t worry, you won’t have to wait until Monday. It’ll be posted tomorrow as a one-off special.\n\nFor now, let’s bask in the glory of already winning five trophies this season.\n\nOh, but before you go. Check out this news report on how Jose Mourinho is doing at Stoke City.\n\nBefore we get into the blog, I just wanted to give an insight to my current situation. Like many others during this outbreak/lockdown, my regular sources of income have taken a major hit. If you can afford to – and want to – please consider a pledge to my Patreon page here. The blogs won’t ever be put behind a paywall because we all need distractions right now. More importantly than anything else, please keep safe and stay inside as much as possible.\n\nI’m taking the executive decision to try and get us into the pivotal matches and speed through those we steamroller on a consistent basis. Whilst a lesser side like Bournemouth, Southampton or West Ham might surprise us once in a blue moon, we know it won’t happen season after season.\n\nSurprisingly, or perhaps unsurprisingly, Jose Mourinho has taken over at struggling Stoke City. This sounds like a better match on paper than ‘The Special One’ taking over at Spurs, eh? Mourinho is trophyless since leaving Manchester United and had mixed spells with Roma, Leicester City and Atalanta before returning to England.\n\nThe transfer window closed but I did make one signing on transfer deadline day. A group of my scouts aren’t allowed to leave South America and young Lucas Eduardo has been touted as a future star. The squad doesn’t need any more attacking midfielders but with Bruno Fernandes fading and Phil Foden proving difficult to fit in, he could offer a solution. He’ll remain on loan with Palmeiras until the summer.\n\nThere was also a, let’s call it a hiccup, with one of my youngsters. Jay Bull arrived from Manchester United 18 months ago for just 650,000. He’s upset that I didn’t name him in my Champions League squad – yeah, okay then pal – and feels I’ve mistreated him. He wouldn’t listen so I put him on the transfer list. Derby bid 14M, his current value, but the board blocked it as they feel 53M is the least we should accept. Erm, Daniel, mate.\n\nWe pick up routine victories over Brighton (3-1) and West Ham (3-1) in the Premier League, squeeze past Brentford (1-0) in the FA Cup and beat The Hammers again (2-0) to book our place in the Carabao Cup final against.. Manchester City. Damnit. High-flying Norwich then lose 2-0 at the Tottenham Hotspur stadium which brings us to Juventus in the Champions League.\n\nI’ve got a full squad to choose from for our trip to Turin. Our XI is Oblak; Aarons, Harvey, Sule, Lodi; Rice, Haidara, Camavinga, Fernandes; Kean and Parrott.\n\nThe first highlight belongs to us. Fernandes whips in a corner but Juventus clear it. Eventually the ball is switched to the right and Aarons tries to find Parrott in the box. De Ligt – yep, still there – heads away but only to Rice some 30 yards out. He rolls the ball across for Camavinga and the Congolese international rifles it into the top corner. Take a bow, son! We’re 1-0 up at the ‘Zebre Stadium’ with barely five minutes on the clock.\n\nAnd to be honest, that was about it. Juventus huffed and puffed but didn’t really test Oblak throughout 90 minutes. Aarons, Harvey and Sule all stood firm. Lodi struggled against Bernardeschi so I needed to deploy Ake at left back for the final 20 minutes. A crucial away victory. Whilst I might be getting ahead of myself, I’m confident we’ll make it to the next round now.\n\nAfter coming back from a fiercely contested draw in Italy, we have Liverpool at Anfield to deal with next in the Premier League. Once again, it’s a defensive masterclass as the match finishes goalless. Pep’s side actually had the best chance, from the penalty spot no less, but Ilaix Moriba fluffed his lines.\n\nWe follow that with a narrow 1-0 victory over Wolves. It was one-way traffic for 90 minutes but Kean’s penalty in the 3rd minute ended up being the only goal. And then it was time for our first piece of (genuine) domestic silverware: the Carabao Cup.\n\nThe first chance falls to Tuchel’s City. Tielemans sends a freekick deep into our box but man-mountain Sule clears. It goes all the way back to Sousa – I guess they’re resting Ederson – who hoofs it forward. Camavinga picks off the loose ball, finds Dembele who immediately threads it through to Kean. Despite being 25 yards out, the Italian stallion chips it over Sousa and we’re ahead after just six minutes. A finish worthy of the current Ballon d’Or holder.\n\nJust before half-time and another wild Sousa clearance kickstarts a Spurs attack. French superstar Gaillard gathers the ball and sends it forward to Dembele. It’s been a really slow season for the club legend but he drives into the box and beats Sousa at his near post. 2-0 and we are cruising here.\n\nAs we pass the hour mark I bring on Fernandes and Haidara for Camavinga and Reinier to keep the team fresh. Sessegnon is the only guy struggling out there. In his defence, Ryan has been forced to mark Jadon Sancho and later Myron Boadu. Ake replaces him in the 79th minute.\n\nCity finally beat our press and my side are chasing shadows. Their young left back, Lopes, sends in a cross that Ake doesn’t quite reach. It falls to Sekou Koita and he doesn’t miss from five yards out. 2-1 with 10 minutes to go. Come on lads, don’t do this to me.\n\nIt’s all City now and they have a freekick as we enter injury time. Sule, what a leader, heads it out but only as far as Boadu. He plays it inside to Malcom Boxall – a wonderkid who turned us down to join City two years ago – and the kid’s effort goes through a host of bodies but there’s Oblak.. or not. It evades the Slovenian’s long frame and squeezes into the bottom corner. It’s 2-2 in the 91st minute. Bollocks.\n\nMy players are getting tired now. I really could’ve done without extra time, folks. In the 111th minute, Haidara sends a ball forward to Kean, he brings it down and volleys it across Sousa. The fans go wild! But wait.. the linesman has his flag up. VAR rules it out for offside.\n\nPenalties it is!\n\nKean scores, Riccardi makes it 1-1. Dembele scores.. then Oblak denies Boadu! 2-1. We have a chance to make it 3-1 but Bruno ‘El Capitán’ misses. Koita could level the scores again.. but Oblak saves! Qué grande es, hombre. Harvey scores to make it 3-1 to us. Skriniar makes it 3-2 but Haidara will win it for Spurs if he scores… and he does! We retain the Carabao Cup!\n\nThere’s another Cup match up next as we travel across London to face Millwall at The Den. A rotated side gets the job as we comfortably win 3-0. Aarons and Reinier scored the first two and the final goal went to young Keren Tal from the penalty spot. Tal, who was born in Tel-Aviv but has decided to represent England, is scoring goals for fun with my U23s but hasn’t carried that record over to the senior side. It was his first goal of the season. I’m hoping he will step up and replace Dembele soon.\n\nWe crush Blackburn 4-1 in the Premier League to go 14 points clear at the top after United draw four in a row. Then we welcome Juventus to North London.\n\nAs is becoming a familiar tale this season, Spurs come flying out of the blocks. Juventus are sat deep in their half and just looking to absorb our attacks. To their credit, it’s working. Kean, Dembele and Gaillard are all being creatively stifled. Tonali is pulling the strings in midfield. The good news is that Juventus aren’t creating much either, if anything.\n\nAnd we’re through! 0-0 on the night means we advance 1-0 on aggregative thanks to our victory in Italy. Tighter than expected, not gonna lie.\n\nAs we enter the beginning of April, we beat Aston Villa (2-1) and Newcastle (4-1) in Premier League. Sandwiched between those results is a 1-1 draw away at the Etihad as 10-man Spurs earn a point. Yet it’s the result at home to Newcastle which brings about sooner-than-expected news:\n\nIn other competitions we beat Leicester City in the Quarter Final of the FA Cup. Naturally, it was at home (otherwise we’d be out). Goals from Harvey, Trecco, Foden and Tal (!) ensure we’ll return to Wembley. Liverpool, who might miss out on Champions League football, are our opponents.\n\nSpeaking of which, the Champions League Quarter Final draw took place and we’ve got FC Barcelona. Yep, after not seeing Harry Kane for four seasons we are now crossing paths for the second – and third – time in less than 12 months. Kane is currently out of the Barça team as new signing Fabio Silva is leading the line instead. Maybe a cheeky low-ball offer to bring King Harry back in the summer?\n\nBarça, and Kane, will come to North London first. Our XI is Oblak; Aarons, Sule, Ake, Lodi; Rice, Camavinga, Haidara, Reinier; Kean and Dembele.\n\nAs for the visitors, Marc-Andre ter Stegen, Frenkie de Jong and Ousmane Dembele are the only Barça originals still at the Camp Nou. Other well-known names in the XI are Virgil van Dijk, Ruben Neves, Bernardo Silva and Joao Felix. Raheem Sterling, Leroy Sane, Fabio Silva and the aforementioned Dembele are on the bench.\n\nThe first highlight goes to Barça. They work the ball around the box before sending a cross to the far post. Felix manages to out-jump Aarons but Oblak deals with it easily. Then it’s our turn to launch an attack. Ake finds Reinier and the Brazilian skips through a couple of challenges but runs into traffic. Eventually the ball goes out to Lodi and he aims for Dembele.. who powers it past ter Stegen! Another early goal on the clock. What a start!\n\nHalf an hour in and Lodi is standing over the ball at the corner flag. It’s another wonderful cross that Kean gets on the end of. His effort is palmed upwards by ter Stegen but the Italian reacts quickest to poke the ball into an empty net. 2-0! Whose name is Harry Kane?\n\n…\n\nTwo minutes later and Kane scores for Barça. It’s another sloppy goal as Lodi gives away possession to Silva. The Portuguese wide man wriggles his way into the box before sending it across the six-yard line. Ake somehow lets it pass by and there’s Harry, it had to be him, to make it 2-1 and give Barça a vital away goal. Bollocks.\n\nIt’s hard to know what to change as we’ve utterly dominated the Catalan giants but they’ve got the individual quality to punish us at any given moment. Haidara is having a nightmare so I bring on Gaillard to add a bit of extra goal threat to our midfield. We need at least another goal this evening to advance.\n\n10 minutes into the second half and Barça have a freekick. Silva is no doubt looking for Harry ‘you’re dead to me now‘ Kane but Oblak plucks the ball from the sky. He sets Aarons away down the right who immediately finds Dembele hugging the touchline. The Mouss cuts inside and sends a cross aimed towards Kean.. but van Dijk heads it away. Only to Gaillard though and the French wonderkid glides the ball into the bottom corner. Ice is running through his veins. Can I get a ‘what an inspired substitution’ in the comments section please?\n\nDembele and Reinier come off for Parrott and Fernandes just as we have a freekick of our own. Lodi, the man of the moment, remains on set-piece duty despite Bruno being on the pitch. He launches it towards Parrott but Camavinga races ahead of him and powers it past ter Stegen! 4-1. Three headers, too. Are we Bolton in disguise?\n\nWe’re approaching the final 10 minutes and Barça are pushing for a second goal. A corner is homing in on van Dijk’s head but Sule clears. The attacking players get a lot of praise but Sule, a player we signed in the very first transfer window, has been nothing short of sensational. Worth every penny of the 70M we paid Bayern for his services.\n\nAnother quick piece of build-up play sees Fernandes charging across the halfway line. Parrott pulls off down the left and leaves space open down the centre for Kean. Bruno plays in the Italian, who turns his marker inside out before unleashing a rocket past ter Stegen! 5-1. FIVE. ONE. What a performance.\n\nWe lose 1-0 at the Camp Nou but that doesn’t matter. The tie was won in North London. Kane didn’t score this one but he did assist a former Premier League man in Sane. We are through to the Champions League semi-finals where we will face.. Atletico Madrid. LaLiga again.\n\nBoth matches against Atletico as well as the FA Cup semi-final against Manchester City will feature in Friday’s update. Hopefully it’ll also include a couple of finals too. Is it possible to do what only Real Madrid have managed and retain the Champions League trophy? FC Bayern and PSG are in the other semi.\n\nCrucially, we haven’t suffered any major injuries either.\n\nBefore we get into the blog, I just wanted to give an insight to my current situation. Like many others during this outbreak/lockdown, my regular sources of income have taken a major hit. If you can afford to – and want to – please consider a pledge to my Patreon page here. The blogs won’t ever be put behind a paywall because we all need distractions right now. More importantly than anything else, please keep safe and stay inside as much as possible.\n\nDecember isn’t a month I relish in Football Manager because there’s always at least one result or one injury that ruins the entire mood. The flow of games can be good in terms of rotating your squad, keeping everyone happy, but it takes a toll on their fitness. And the concept of rotating heavily is dangerous as we all know the game likes to give you a swift kick in the balls if things are going well.\n\nLet’s try and find some positives though: the only match which, on paper, should cause us some problems is Wolves away. Everybody else is certainly beatable. Ajax is a dead-rubber in the Champions League so even a loss wouldn’t hurt anything but possibly morale. Well, that and the fans being up in arms whenever we don’t obliterate an opponent. Even Nottingham Forest in the Carabao Cup looks comfortable on paper as they’re currently struggling at the bottom of the Championship. I feel better now, do you?\n\nBack to back away matches against Newcastle (2-0) and Aston Villa (4-0) yield the six points we would expect. Kean bagged a brace in both with Gaillard and Aarons scoring the others against the Midlands’ giants. It makes sense to rotate for the Ajax game but my hand is forced into another change when this email arrives in my Inbox:\n\nYoung Chris Wells had wrestled the number one jersey from Jan Oblak this season but, as fate would have it, now the Slovenian international is back between the sticks. Look at that record, too. 909 minutes without conceding a goal. 12 clean sheets in 15 appearances. I shouldn’t complain too much really because Oblak is still technically better. But this is what I get for trying to plan for the future.\n\nAmadou Haidara is also injured at the minute but I’ve got plenty of cover in midfield. The Malian international won’t be back until January because of a groin strain.\n\nThere’s also an update on the next batch of youngsters who will be promoted to my U18 side after Christmas. Apparently, it isn’t good news. Seriously, what I am paying all these people for?\n\nRoutines wins against Ajax (2-0) and Blackburn Rovers (4-2) see us maintain that 100% record for December. Joseph Harvey is the latest name to add himself to the treatment room and won’t be back until the new year due to strained ligaments. That earlier positivity didn’t do much good, did it?\n\nNext up is Nottingham Forest in the Carabao Cup quarter final. My XI is Oblak; Villani, Terry, Ake, Lodi; Rice, Tonali, Gaillard, Fernandes; Kean and Parrott. Strong.\n\nAll the chances are falling to us but we can’t seem to get the ball in the back of the net. Unsurprisingly, Forest are sitting deep and frustrating us. Guess what happens next? Yep, Forest take the lead. Declan Rice trips Danny Loader and the man himself coverts from the spot. “Demand More” is going to be abused here.\n\nOn the stroke of half-time, my cries for more work. Renan Lodi has space to attack down the left and his cross is bundled home by captain Bruno. 1-1 at the break but I’m still not happy.\n\nAt the "
