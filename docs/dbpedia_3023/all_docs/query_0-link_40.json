Lyra or Nia, Orton or Gunther, who will reign and head for SummerSlam?\n\nOFFICIAL RESULTS\n\nCountdown Show – WWE Women’s Tag Team Championships: Bianca Belair & Jade Cargill VS Candice LeRae & Indi Hartwell; Bianca & Jade win and retain the titles.\n\nWWE Women’s World Championship: Becky Lynch VS Liv Morgan; Liv wins and becomes the new WWE Women’s World Champion.\n\nWWE Intercontinental Championship Triple Threat: Sami Zayn VS VS Bronson Reed VS Chad Gable w/ Otis; Sami wins and retains the title.\n\n2024 Queen of the Ring Finals: Lyra Valkyria VS Nia Jax; Nia wins and will challenge for a title at SummerSlam.\n\n2024 King of the Ring Finals: GUNTHER VS Randy Orton; Gunther wins and will challenge for a title at SummerSlam.\n\nUndisputed WWE Championship: Cody Rhodes VS Logan Paul; Cody wins and retains the title.\n\nPLAY BY PLAY\n\nIt’s the King & Queen of the Ring Countdown Show!\n\nJoin Michael Cole, Corey Graves, Wade Barrett & Big E in discussing, analyzing and predicting all the action for this historic night!\n\nCorey Graves interviews Cody Rhodes.\n\nCorey sits with The American Nightmare and talks about his role has changed since becoming champion. It’s only been a couple months, but Corey wants Cody to best describe the feeling of “finishing the story.” Cody would say whatever that feeling is, that’s the feeling he wants to chase for the rest of his life. It was a sensation that he can’t describe. It made him happy, it made him smile, it made him cry, it was everything. That moment met if not exceeded expectations. Corey says Cody got what he was chasing, he is now WWE Champion and the face of this company. What does that responsibility feel like?\n\nIf that is true and Cody is the face of this wonderful company, he feels more appreciative of the team around him more than he ever was. He told Logan Paul and stands by this, this is a team effort. What is the time requirement of being THE WWE Champion in this day and age? Fans might hear this often, think this is hyperbole about how much your life changes winning the Royal Rumble and winning the WWE Championship. Media, teleconferences, “stuff.” It feels pretty balanced and he’s able to do it all.\n\nThen are there any superstars, past or present, that have been world champion who Cody has gone to for advice? He’s stayed connected to Randy Orton, remembering back to 2008 when John Cena was on top. Cody is doing his best to do what they did right, but do it his way. He wants to do it bigger. Then what is the opinion on the state of the industry? What’s great about the last three years is new fans. From little kids or returning adults. There’s this almost pat on the back for the ones in Cody’s generation, because they were beaten over the head with how “wonderful” The Attitude Era was. And it was, it really was.\n\nBut sometimes, Cody’s bitter about it because this era is here, they’re the ones doing it now. Biggest arena attendance, and that’s on Cody’s name, not on The Rock or Austin, and that’s something Cody can be proud of. Then if Cody had to give his younger self advice, what would he tell that Cody? When you’re in the position of that Cody, “Undesirable,” low on the role sheet, then bet on yourself. Stardust shouldn’t be in any main event anywhere, so Cody had to figure out how to make Cody better. If you’re the same as you were, that’s not good, you’re not growing. He made the call to “get better.” More of this interview later on in the show.\n\nBackstage interview with Jade Cargill & Bianca Belair.\n\nByron Saxton is with the StrongEST Storm, and he says it is a big night to say the least. First televised tag title defense for them, how do they feel? Jade is beyond excited, this is her first PLE in Saudi, who gets that this soon? And with The EST, they will take these belts like they always do. Byron asks about Bianca’s knee, and she says it is not 100%. She lost out last night because of Candice. Candice started this, but Bianca beat her before so she will do it again. She and Jade will remain champions. Byron wishes them luck and Jade says who needs luck? Will nothing stop this dynamic duo when they stand side by side?\n\nBackstage interview with Lyra Valkyria.\n\nKayla Braxton is with The Morrigan and says tonight is the night. She is about to embark on the biggest challenge of her WWE career, and only after being called up for a month now. She could be the NEW Queen of the Ring, how surreal is it to realize she’s made it here so fast? So surreal! She was just in NXT wanting to regain the title, but now she’s here in Jeddah! She can’t imagine a more surreal start as a rookie on Raw. And now, the finals of QOTR! She will be facing Nia Jax, who had choice words for her. Has Lyra marinated on those claims?\n\nLyra can’t wait to prove Nia wrong. Nia says she’s gonna “buzz” through her, but surely everyone else thought the same. Dakota Kai, Zoey Stark, Iyo Sky, all former champions, but Lyra is the one here. She is the one that will be Queen and going to SummerSlam. Lyra is gonna launch herself into the WWE Women’s World Championship scene! Lyra is ready to fly, but can she get through the Irresistible Force?\n\nBackstage interview with Triple H.\n\nByron is with The Game and says there is a lot of excitement already tonight, with the finals of King & Queen of the Ring tournaments. How important are these matches? They’re massive. And the excitement is an understatement, the whole week, the moment WWE landed, being in Riyadh and the WWE Experience, HHH can’t imagine how as a kid it’d feel to go to such an immersive world. But last night, in Jeddah for SmackDown, it was off the charts. They’ve had a great time, but this whole night is the main event. It is the reason we are here.\n\nAnd these aren’t just fancy titles you win and get to say you’re king or queen. This is about cementing legacies. The competition for these crowns is massive. When you look at tonight, Nia Jax since her return has torn through everyone. From going toe-to-toe with Rhea Ripley to tearing through Becky Lynch, Naomi, Bianca, Jade, all to get here. Can Nia finish that job? Can she establish herself as Queen? She has to go through Lyra Valkyria. In many ways, a lot of accolades on her own, but should Lyra be here already? It’s been “a cup of coffee.” But also, Lyra beat Iyo Sky to be here. And when you beat a former Women’s Champion to be here, anything is possible.\n\nAnd of course, Randy Orton returning form near career ending injury. Can The Viper solidify his legacy? Can he put the stamp on his return? Can he finish this and take another step forward as one of the greats? In his way is Gunther, who has been like no one before him in WWE. Longest reigning Intercontinental Champion, went through just about everyone to get here. Orton VS Gunther is impossible to call, but HHH will be doing what we’re doing: sitting on the edge of his seat and watching with baited breath. A king is crowned, a queen is crowned, and they’ll each face top champions at SummerSlam. This is gonna be awesome.\n\nByron thanks HHH for sharing his thoughts on a night that will be talked about for years. The Game set things out pretty well, so who will be crowned and move on to “The Land” to fight for gold?\n\nMichael Cole & Corey Graves tag out of the panel.\n\nIn their place, Kayla Braxton and Kevin Owens are here to help Wade & Big E for the second hour! The Prizefighter is back, and he saved Randy Orton from The Bloodline. Kevin says yes, you’re welcome, he loves praise. And he’s glad to have made it here at all. He made sure Orton would have some support, check the shirt. It’s good, right?\n\nCorey’s interview with Cody, part two.\n\nSaudi Arabia, it will be Cody VS Logan Paul. Cody’s had limited access to Logan in Logan’s short time in WWE, but to Cody, who is Logan Paul? Cody looked up the definition of “maverick.” An unorthodox or independent minded person. Cody doesn’t dislike that, and it describes Logan. The ventures Logan has gone on, he has just been so successful. And as a pro-wrestler, he is more fundamentally sound than he has any right to be. Then there’s a healthy professional respect there, but what about personal? Well, fortune favors the bold, but everything Cody just said about Logan has informed Logan’s decisions. Logan is too bold in taking credit for WWE’s success.\n\nKnowing Logan actually believes that, the best thing that can happen to him is slip on a banana peel, fall on his face, and we see what he does next. Then what are Cody’s thoughts to Logan taking his US Championship out of the deal? Titles mean everything. Cody knows a lying wrestler when they say they don’t care about a title or a list. Cody would’ve loved to get the Grand Slam, maybe he’ll finish that story later. Then how does Cody plan on neutralizing Logan’s lethal right hand? This might not be the best person to quote, but JBL talking about HBK’s Sweet Chin Music, “Just duck.” That’s JBL for ya.\n\nThat is Cody’s current strategy, in that he doesn’t need to get to the point where he’s off balance. No matter how quick, how athletic, how in-your-blood, it’ll end quickly at that right hand. Then as we approach that match, how does it go down? As much positive things and wonderful platitudes Cody could throw out at Logan, to be completely honest, he doesn’t stand a chance. Logan finds out that he’s great and all, but not on the level he thinks. That’s actually a great thing for Logan to find out. Corey wishes Cody luck, they shake hands, but will Cody still be Undisputed Champion after facing the ImPAULsive One?\n\nBackstage interview with Liv Morgan.\n\nByron is with the #1 contender to the Women’s World Championship and notes her Liv Morgan revenge Tour. This tour could reach an epic conclusion if she wins the title off Becky Lynch. Where is her confidence level right now? Liv thanks him for asking that, because she has never felt better in her whole life! She’s been waiting for this day the last 8 months of her life, ever since Rhea Ripley injured her. And she completes the LMRT by taking what Rhea loves most, in the Women’s World Championship. Becky is charged up, too, how is Liv going to change that?\n\nLiv says Becky keeps reminding everyone that Liv has yet to beat her, but that changes tonight because Becky’s never face this Liv. There’s nothing she can throw at Liv because- Wait, what’s Dominik Mysterio doing here? Dom says Liv knows what he’s doing here. He flew all the way to Saudi Arabia to make sure Liv doesn’t get her hands on Mami’s gold. Dom leaves, and Liv definitely didn’t expect that. Will Liv be able to focus on The Man when she has Mami’s Latino Heat lurking?\n\nCountdown Show – WWE Women’s Tag Team Championships: Bianca Belair & Jade Cargill VS Candice LeRae & Indi Hartwell!\n\nThe StrongEST Storm said it themselves, they’re gonna get even with The Poison Pixie for the damage done and leave here still holding the gold. But while Candice & Indi may have last their way and gone to the dark side, will they come away the winners?\n\nThe introductions are made, the belts are raised, and we see who is the greatEST!\n\nThe teams sort out and Jade starts against #IndiWrestling. They tie up., Indi waistlocks but Jade throws her off! The fans cheer but Candice says that’s okay. Indi gets up, goes for a leg, but Jade lifts her up!

Cover, TWO?!?! Gunther survives, because of the bad leg! Ghost pin, GUNTHER WINS!!!\n\nWinner: Gunther, by pinfall (2024 King of the Ring Winner)\n\nThe fans can’t believe it, but Der Ring General snatches this one away outta nowhere! The crown continues to elude Orton, will he ever finish his WWE checklist? As for Gunther, HHH returns to give him the crown, and the King General is born! Byron is here to interview and congratulate Gunther. Gunther was confident he’d win, he achieved this goal, how does it feel to be King of the Ring? Gunther takes a moment, and there are fans who chant, “You Deserve It!” Gunther thanks them for that, but what he does or doesn’t deserve is none of their business. The fans boo, but Gunther says it doesn’t even matter that he defeated Orton here in the finals!\n\nWhat happened today was the Apex Predator becoming the prey of Der Ring General. Der Ring General is now King of the Ring! And at SummerSlam, the King becomes the World Heavyweight Champion! Gunther has put Damian Priest on notice, and also in effect all of Raw. Will Gunther keep the mat sacred from here to The Land?\n\nCrown Jewel returns!\n\nRiyadh will once again host the landmark spectacle of the Fall! Saturday, November 2nd, who will return to the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia as champion?\n\nBackstage interview with HHH.\n\nKayla is now with The Game and says he has some breaking news. Yes, he does. It has been an incredible night so far, congratulations to Liv Morgan, to Nia Jax, and to Gunther. But for big announcements, earlier tonight, the medical staff just cleared Drew McIntyre! And true to his word, Damian Priest agreed to defend his World Heavyweight Championship against the Scottish Warrior. The match is now official! Priest VS McIntyre for the title, June 15th in Glasgow, Scotland! It will be a Clash at the Castle to be sure, but will McIntyre bring about Priest’s judgment day? Or will even all of Scotland rise for El Campeon?\n\nUndisputed WWE Championship: Cody Rhodes VS Logan Paul!\n\nThe American Nightmare was able to #FinishTheStory at WrestleMania 40, and he had a phenomenal first defense at Backlash. But now, he goes up against the Maverick United States Champion who is known for pulling fast ones over on his opponents. After all, Logan won his US title by cheating Rey Mysterio, and even found a way to not defend it here tonight. But will Cody show Logan that this business isn’t about ability but dedication? Or will we all have to call him #TwoBeltLogan?\n\nAs special guest ring announce, Saudi Arabia’s own Ibrahim Al Hajjaj is here! Ibrahim makes the introductions, Cody’s belt is raised, and it’s time to see who is truly Undisputed!\n\nThe bell rings and the fans sing “CODY~!

Logan throws hands, his posse is there to cheer him on! They help him hydrate with Prime, but then Cody kicks low! Cody takes that bottle and SMACKS Logan with it!

Cover, Cody wins!!\n\nWinner: Cody Rhodes, by pinfall (still Undisputed WWE Champion)\n\nLogan tried all his tricks and then some, and Cody makes him pay for it! Will Logan have to learn to do this the right way? As for The American Nightmare, his story as champion continues on. Gunther will be facing the World Heavyweight Champion at SummerSlam, so who is next for THE WWE Champion?\n\nMy Thoughts:\n\nAn awesome show for this year’s King & Queen of the Ring. Really good interview promos throughout the “countdown” show, and a really good women’s tag title match to top it off. That finishing string of moves was also used at Backlash but it wasn’t a finisher then, so I’m glad they used it as a finisher now. Shayna Baszler & Zoey Stark won the right to be challengers next, maybe we get them against Jade & Bianca for Clash at the Castle. Speaking of, glad to learn Priest VS McIntyre is official for Clash at the Castle, what else would they do? There’s a very good chance McIntyre wins, as Priest has been adamant about Judgment Day not cheating for him, and Priest could end up arguing with Finn or McDonagh and that costs Priest the title.\n\nGreat Women’s World Championship match, and great tie-in of the story, Dom costing Becky when he meant to cost Liv. Becky wants her rematch, she’ll probably get it, but there’s a good chance Liv uses another dirty tactic to keep the title, only for Rhea to return and challenge Liv. There’s something brewing with Liv and Judgment Day, as she’s been spotted Easter Egg style with Finn Balor. There’s all the memes of Liv VS Rhea for “custody” of Dom, guess we’ll see. The Triple Threat for the Intercontinental Championship was also great stuff, and while Sami was of course winning, we got a great moment of Otis accidentally clobbering Gable. That will definitely be a major point on Raw, and Sami can move on to any number of contenders now.\n\nAwesome Queen AND King of the Ring matches tonight, and it makes sense the brands split the two. Lyra is great but she wasn’t gonna be the challenger to a world title so soon, and what a creative finish with Nia crushing Lyra’s powerbomb attempt. As I figured just last night with SmackDown, Bayley will have to take on some powerhouses with Piper Niven in Glasgow and Queen Nia in Cleveland, really bringing out that classic Underdog Face side of her. At the same time, we have to remember Money in the Bank is in July, who knows who will be Miss Money in the Bank by SummerSlam, they could take advantage of Nia almost having Bayley and snipe the title.\n\nGunther VS Orton was so good, and they played up Orton’s bad leg and bad back to perfection. It was one of the few times where Orton hits an RKO and can’t make the cover. Plus, Gunther winning not with a finisher but a fast pin was a great move to protect Orton in the loss but to still make sure it was Gunther getting the crown and getting in on the world title scene. Priest VS McIntyre in Glasgow, a new Mr. MITB to worry about after July, and Gunther VS World Heavyweight Champion at SummerSlam. It’d be rather fitting if Priest got cashed in on, and we also have to worry about Bash in Berlin on August 31st. Gunther’s gotta be doing something for that, and could possibly be champion going into that.\n\nAnd of course, awesome main event from Cody and Logan. Gotta admit, it was clever for Logan to have other people sneaking him knuckles, and it was good Heel Heat for him to resort to this. But of course Cody won by making it through all the cheap tricks and he has a win on the US Champion. As I was theorizing last night, it feels like Cody VS Styles 2 should happen for Clash at the Castle, and then because Cody got a win over a champion and Cleveland is Logan’s hometown, Cody VS Logan 2 for the US Championship should happen. Now, whether Cody becomes Grand Slam Champion at SummerSlam, who knows. MITB will also be in play, someone could use that to snipe the Undisputed title off Cody while Cody gets the US title, a wild switcheroo if they go for it.\n\nMy Score: 9.1/10\n\nPowered by RedCircle\n\nLet us know what you think on social media @ChairshotMedia and always remember to use the hashtag #UseYourHead!\n\nWho steps closer to gold?\n\nBash In Berlin is days away, and while Gunther prepares for Randy Orton, the WWE Intercontinental Championship contender’s tournament begins!\n\nOFFICIAL RESULTS\n\n8 Man Tag: The Judgment Day VS The LWO; Judgment Day wins.\n\nIyo Sky & Kairi Sane VS Shayna Baszler & Zoey Stark w/ Sonya Deville; Iyo & Kairi win.\n\nWWE Intercontinental Championship Contender’s Tournament Triple Threat: Kofi Kingston VS Karrion Kross VS Jey Uso; Jey wins and advances.\n\nBronson Reed VS Braun Strowman; No Contest.\n\nWWE Intercontinental Championship Contender’s Tournament Triple Threat: The Miz VS Xavier Woods VS Pete Dunne; Dunne wins and advances.\n\nChad Gable VS “Uncle Howdy” Bo Dallas; Howdy wins.\n\nPLAY BY PLAY\n\nWWE mourns the loss of Sid Eudy.\n\nKnown by his nicknames of Sid Vicious, Sid Justice and even “Sycho Sid,” he was bad to the bone, and made his initial impact in WCW. His 6’9″ physique and fierce demeanor made him the perfect muscle for the Four Horsemen. It also set the stage for his WWE debut in 1991. Eyes wide open, imposing size, and unmatched intensity, Sid rose to the top quickly, going toe to toe even with Hulk Hogan at WrestleMania 8, and main-eventing against The Undertaker at WM 13. Sid backed up his athleticism with mind games, won multiple world championships over nearly 30 years. But despite his menacing presence in the ring, Sid was known for his kind heart outside it.\n\nA devoted family man, Sid will be remembered as a man of strength, kindness and love. He was a larger than life star who stood out in an era of larger than life characters, with a legacy that will live on forever.\n\nThe Judgment Day is here!\n\nProvidence, Rhode Island boos as Finn Balor leads the way for JD McDonagh, Carlito, Dominik Mysterio & Liv Morgan as they head down to the ring. They huddle up first, then break for the WWE World Tag Team Champions and Caribbean Cool to roll in first. Then Liv & Dirty Dom nuzzle noses before they hop onto the apron. The fans boo more as the group gets the mics. Liv starts by welcoming us to Monday Night Raw, and telling us to ALL RISE for The Judgment Day! Prince Finn says let’s remind everyone what Judgment Day is all about! Roll the tape!\n\nWe see replay of last week, when Dom was almost demolished, but Liv saved him. Then the rest of Judgment Day beat down “Terror Twins,” Damian Priest & Rhea Ripley, doing a lot of damage this close to Bash In Berlin. Carlito says now that was cool. JD tells Priest & Rhea that that beating was a long time coming! Finn agrees, and says let’s make one thing clear: They’re not the bad guys around here! It’s Priest & Rhea! If you ask this Judgment Day, Priest & Rhea betrayed them, and they got what they deserved!\n\nAnd by the way, last week was just a preview of what happens at Bash In Berlin! Liv says she almost feels she should thank Rhea. If Rhea wasn’t so selfish, self-centered and egotistically, none of this could’ve happened. And at Bash In Berlin, when they stand over the lifeless, pathetic bodies of Priest & Rhea, hopefully they finally realize Dom & Liv are always on top. Dom starts but the fans boo even louder now. They even chant “DOM YOU SUCK! DOM YOU SUCK!” Carlito and Dom tell them all to shut up so Dom can talk!\n\nDom finally manages to say that Liv does things for Dom that Rhea has never done! Like help him beat his deadbeat dad, Rey Mysterio. With Liv’s full support, Dom is now entering the Intercontinental Championship Contender’s Tournament! And he will win the whole damn thing! So everyone will see why he is El Jefe! Especially Damian Priest and- WAIT! Here comes Rey! And he’s brought the Latino World Order! Dragon Lee returns, alongside Joaquin Wilde & Cruz Del Toro, and they storm right down to the ring! Rey gets a mic so he can tell his son, “Have you looked in the mirror recently? You’re a lost soul! You need help! You’re outta control, son!\n\n“At least when you were with Rhea, one of you had a set! And it sure wasn’t you. Someone needs to put you in your place.” Dom laughs and asks if that’s gonna be Rey. Dom already beat Rey, and then he disappeared for weeks. Rey says Dom just had to go there. Dom’s always been a jackass, but now that he’s hanging out with wera Liv, he’s an even BIGGER jackass! Liv says no one talks about the Women’s World Champion like that, especially not some deadbeat. Dom, go get him! Yeah, Dom hit Rey! Rey would love to smack that stupid mustache off his face! The fans fire up for that!\n\nDom tells Rey he’d like to see Rey’s old ass try. JD runs up but Rey DECKS him! And the brawl is on! Liv gets back as the boys all throw hands! The LWO DUMPS out Judgment Day, and then Dragon builds speed to FLY! Direct hit on all of Judgment Day! Are Dom and his pals about to learn why you don’t mess with the LWO?\n\n8 Man Tag: The Judgment Day VS The LWO!\n\nRaw returns and this is already underway as Finn CHOKES Dragon. Finn whips Dragon corner to corner but Dragon BOOTS him, then RANAS him! A rough tumble but Finn is up, only for Dragon to JUMP KICK, leg sweep, and COMBINACION DRAGON! The fans fire up as Dragon then drags Finn over. Tag to Rey, they mug Finn, then Rey fires hands. Rey whips corner to corner, Finn goes up and over then comes back, but into an ELBOW! Rey wheelbarrows to BULLDOG! Cover, TWO! The fans rally as Rey storms up on Finn, but Finn kicks low.

Cruz BOOTS Carlito, goes up, then springboards to CROSSBODY! Cover, TWO! Carlito stays in this but Cruz stays on him. Tag to Wilde and they double whip to DOUBLE ELBOW!

Cruz bumps Carlito off buckles, then CHOPS!\n\nThe fans fire up as Cruz whips. Carlito reverses, Cruz goes out and around, springboards, but Finn helps Carlito dodge! There’s a bit of chaos as Finn distracts the ref, but Cruz still kicks Carlito. Cruz runs, but JD gets a cheap shot in! Carlito LARIATS Cruz, the fans boo, but Carlito drags Cruz over. Carlito fires hands, tags Dom, and fans really boo now. Dom stomps Cruz, lets off as the ref counts, and JD gets his shots in. Fans boo, LWO protests but the ref stops them, so that just lets Carlito get shots in, too! Finn and Dom flex to soak up heat, then Dom goes back for Cruz. Dom stomps Cruz, rains down fists, then wags his fingers at fans.\n\nDom stomps Cruz, but Cruz hits back! Cruz fires hands, but Dom knees low! Dom brings Cruz over, tags Carlito, and they mug Cruz. Carlito fires more hands, then tags Finn. Finn tags JD, the tag champs double whip but Cruz KICKS Finn! Cruz fires hands on Finn & JD, but Finn kicks low! Then Finn & JD BLAST the LWO corner! The fans boo but Cruz DOUBLE DROPKICKS Finn & JD! Hot tag to Wilde! He slingshots, ducks ‘n’ dodges then CLOBBERS JD! Wilde mule kicks, spins and FACEBUSTERS!

Cruz does the same to Carlito! The fans fire up as LWO all build speed, only for Judgment Day to run away. But then LWO set up, BOOSTER SPLASH!! Wilde bowls a strike on Judgment Day, and the fans are thunderous as Raw goes to break.\n\nRaw returns again and Carlito grinds Wilde down with a chinlock. Wilde endures as the fans rally up, and he fights to his feet. Carlito CLUBS Wilde down, then he drags Wilde over as fans boo. Carlito snapmares Wilde, tags Finn, and Finn slingshot STMOPS! Finn tags Dom to slingshot SENTON! Dom tags JD and he ARABIAN PRESSES! Cover, TWO! JD argues with the ref, but then he stalks Wilde. JD clamps onto Wilde’s arm and grinds.

Priest CLOBBERS JD, Carlito and Finn, Rhea catches Liv before she can get away! The fans fire up as Rhea SMACKS Liv off the desk! And POSTS her!\n\nDom is stuck up top like a cat that climbed a tree!

Will Bash In Berlin be the day Judgment Day faces the consequences of their actions?\n\nBackstage interview with The Miz.\n\nJackie Redmond is with The Hollywood A-Lister and notes his part in the Intercontinental Championship Contender’s Tournament. That title is one Miz has held an impressive EIGHT times, but this opportunity comes on the heels of a rough couple of weeks. What is Miz’s mindset going into tonight? Miz says it was good, until Jackie had to bring that up. Miz has had a bad time. Awesome Truth lost the tag titles, Miz didn’t get to complete in Cleveland for SummerSlam, and Bronson Reed crushed R-Truth. When Miz tries to avenge Truth, Bronson gives Miz a Tsunami. It feels like whenever Miz tries to do what’s right, it goes wrong.\n\nBut tonight, he can right those wrongs because tonight, he has a chance to get one step closer to the title HE made matter! The title that if he wins, he could tie for the most reigns ever! He’s talking about THE Intercontinental Championship. But in steps Bronson Reed. And he tells Miz that Miz came after him because he took out Truth. Truth came after Bronson because Bronson took out Seth Rollins. And now Miz has gone and gotten Braun Strowman involved. Bronson has lost track of all the people he has to maim. So once he maims the Monster, and he will, Bronson is coming back to finish Miz.\n\nBronson smiles and leaves, will Miz be able to survive these dog days of summer to make it to the Fall? Or will he just fall here tonight?\n\nThe New Day meets up backstage.\n\nXavier Woods and Kofi Kingston know tonight is a big night! But Kofi asks, weren’t they doing matching green? Woods says he hit up Johnny and asked to put some special flare on it. Well alright, all good. But Kofi is glad they talked last week. The best thing about The New Day is that when they have an issue, they talk it out like grown men! You just don’t see that in wrestling! Emotionally mature grown men are rare, but that is why they’re going on ten years! They are the best! They communicate, just like with that tag last week. Odyssey Jones was closer, the footage shows it, they talked it out, it’s all good.\n\nSo like tonight, Kofi and Woods each have a shot at becoming #1 contender to the Intercontinental Championship. The best part is that they don’t have just one shot, they have TWO~! They can bring the title to the house of ya bois, the NEW~ DAY~! They swivel it out, “Hey~, we want some New~ Day!” Will Woods and Kofi make it through to the Fatal 4 Way finals? Or will the odds not be in their favor?\n\nIyo Sky & Kairi Sane VS Shayna Baszler & Zoey Stark w/ Sonya Deville!\n\nWhile neither Damage CTRL nor The Pure Fusion Collective came away with the tag titles last week, the chase never ends. Alba Fyre & Isla Dawn will be going to Berlin to face Bianca Belair & Jade Cargill, which team here will “welcome” the champs when they get back?\n\nRaw returns and Cathy Kelley is at gorilla with PFC. Cathy paraphrases Sonya from a few weeks ago that the entire women’s division is on notice now that this group is together. What impact do they feel they’ve made already? Sonya says, “Oh, I dunno, Cathy. Why don’t you ask all the people sitting at home about what kind of impact we’ve made?” First there’s Dakota Kai. She might never walk again, let alone wrestle. Or ask Zelina Vega, with how Shayna owns her arm. Zoey says better yet, ask Kayden & Katana, who are now sitting at home, broken both mentally and physically. Oh wait, Cathy can’t, because they’re so pathetic that they didn’t even show up for work. How’s that for impact?\n\nShayna says after tonight, add Iyo & Kairi to the list. DMG CTRL, you wanna step up? Then shoot your shot! These three head to the ring, will they tear down the Sky Pirates limb by limb?\n\nThe teams sort out and Zoey starts against Iyo. They tie up, Zoey headlocks but Iyo powers out. Iyo drops, Zoey rolls, and they go again. Zoey ducks, handsprings over, but Zoey back suplexes! Iyo lands out, kicks low, and fires off forearms! Iyo whips, Zoey ducks ‘n’ dodges, Shayna tags in! Iyo runs up but Shayna DUMPS her out! Zoey taunts Iyo while Shayna taunts Kairi! The ref is distracted so Sonya KNEES Iyo down!

Kairi and Iyo coordinate, In-SANE ELBOW and an ARIHARA MOONSAULT!! Cover, DMG CTRL wins!\n\nWinners: Iyo Sky & Kairi Sane, by pinfall\n\nThe Sky Pirates are flying high, and PFC just got a reminder that their “victims” are now just their enemies. Will PFC soon learn what it is to be bullied?\n\nBo Dallas speaks.\n\nAnother video from the Wyatt Sick6, and Bo says, “I stopped to marvel at all our accomplishments. Nearly stepped on a serpent. We won’t make that mistake again. The false prophet continues to reveal himself to the world. Masquerading as a loving shepherd while marching his lambs into the mouth of wolves! A bond forged in the tears of the innocent is NOT a family. It’s a blasphemy!! Chad… We have given you chance after chance, inflicting fear and suffering. And yet, you refuse to remove the scales from your eyes. Your arrogance is like a beast, risen from the sea. We must cut off the head so the blood of the damned rains down, washing away the sins of the wicked.\n\n“I accept your challenge. Your… ‘invitation.’ This is more than a reckoning. This… is a purge! There you are…!” Will Uncle Howdy make sure Gable learns this lesson?\n\nDrew McIntyre is here!\n\nProvidence boos The Scottish Terminator as he makes his way out to the ring, CM Punk’s stolen friendship bracelet clear on his wrist. McIntyre gets a mic to mock CM Punk with, “Boy, is it great to be alive in Providence, Rhode Island on a Monday night or what?” McIntyre smirks while fans boo, and he says he can keep going. he knows the whole routine because Punk is so predictable! Punk then talks about his favorite subject, CM Punk, for the next ten minutes or more. Then he’ll say how hot the industry is, how WWE is selling out shows around the world, as if he were part of it instead of sitting on his arse for 8 YEARS while the rest of them did the work!\n\nAnd then Punk gets sentimental, where he tells a story about how “Lil’ Timmy flew 239 THOUSAND miles from the Moon to worship his Lord and Savior, CM Punk.” McIntyre then sits down cross legged like Punk to say, “Do I have your attention now?” No, this isn’t a bit, this isn’t him being cute, this is McIntyre doing what he always has, and that is telling the truth. And the truth is CM Punk is SCARED of Drew McIntyre! The fans don’t believe him? McIntyre has known since the Royal Rumble and SummerSlam! Punk keeps attacking from behind, every opportunity that he gets! And why? Because the fans keep chanting his name every single week!\n\nThe fans chant “C M PUNK!” even now, and McIntyre just smirks. Do any of them know what an enabler is? No, of course they don’t, so let him explain. “An enabler is someone that encourages someone to do something that is detrimental to their well-being! Like handing an alcoholic a drink, every time you chant Punk’s name, he gets this big ego! He gets full of himself, he makes dumb decisions like challenging me to a Strap Match!” Then when Punk sobers up, he realizes McIntyre is going to kill him! And McIntyre will. But that will be on all of you who chanted his name. Every time McIntyre lashes Punk, that’s on them.\n\nIf you chant for Punk, every scar put on Punk’s body, the fans will have to live with it. The fans continue to chant but McIntyre just sighs. They have chosen nostalgia over the warrior who has always been there for you during the dark times. But he forgives you, because you know now that you do. McIntyre says it’s funny how this “fifty cent piece of trash” causes Punk so much emotional damage. And it is ironic that the weapon Punk chose to fix to McIntyre’s wrist will now inflict so much physical damage. Because McIntyre will lash him again, and again, and- CM Punk is here! The fans fire up and McIntyre is ready, but Punk attacks from behind, with the strap!\n\nWell, McIntyre did say it himself… Punk goes after McIntyre, he wants to either put on the strap or take off the bracelet! McIntyre ROCKS Punk first, then SMACKS him off steel steps! McIntyre SMACKS Punk off the desk, fires off hands, and then just hammers away on him! McIntyre lets his hair down, gets the strap, and he seethes as he looks it over, McIntyre runs up, btu Punk TOSSES him onto the desk! Punk LASHES away with the strap, then punches with leather bound fist! The security rushes out here, the fans boo, but McIntyre bails! Punk starts LASHING the guards! Punk TOSSES them, then LASHES the last one!\n\nThe fans are all fired up, and Punk glares at McIntyre in the crowd! Punk attacked from behind but he isn’t afraid, he’s enraged! Will nothing stop Punk from beating McIntyre down and tagging the corners? Or will his rage get the better of him like it has before?\n\nBraun Strowman speaks.\n\n“‘Big’ Bronson Reed. You think you’re a somebody because you put Seth Rollins on the shelf? You talk about how you’re gonna bully me? Let me remind you that I’m not a child and this isn’t the playground anymore. Because when you step foot in that ring with me tonight, you’re gonna find out why they call me The Monster of All Monsters.”\n\nJey Uso is in the concourse.\n\nThe fans are all fired up as Main Event Jey the new IC Champ is coming soon. So hey Uce, please, hit his music! And oh yeah, uh, YEET! The fans fire up as Jey makes his entrance through the stands, and everyone in Providence bounces with him. Will this Triple Threat be just step on in Jey finally having himself a singles title? Or will he have a hard time getting past both Kofi and Kross?\n\nWWE Intercontinental Championship Contender’s Tournament Triple Threat: Kofi Kingston VS Karrion Kross VS Jey Uso!\n\nRaw returns and Kross makes his entrance first, accompanied by his femme fatale, Scarlett. Then Kofi makes his entrance, the bell rings, and Kofi runs up to fire off on Kross! Jey watches Kofi fires off and stomp away, then he storms in. Jey pushes Kofi back, so that he can stomp Kross! The fans “YEET! YEET! YEET!” Kofi pushes Jey back, and the former rivals say YEET, and they stomp Kross together! The fans cheer, Kofi & Jey let off, then Jey whips Kofi in to DROPKICK! Kross bails out, so Jey rolls Kofi up! ONE!! Kofi goes to a corner, Jey whips, but Kofi reverses. Jey goes up and over, keeps moving, but Kofi drops, hurdles, then hurdles again!\n\nKofi ELBOWS Jey down, the fans fire up, and Kofi covers. TWO, and the fans rally. Kofi brings Jey up, mule kicks, and the fans clap, “NEW! DAY ROCKS!” Kofi wrenches, whips, but Jey ducks ‘n’ dodges. Kross trips Jey up and then LARIATS him! Kross says NO yeet, but Kofi DROPKICKS Kross! Kofi climbs the corner and the fans fire up for the SUPER TRUST FALL! Direct hit on Kross AND Jey, and the fans fire up while Raw goes to break.\n\nRaw returns again and Kross grinds Jey down with a chinlock. Jey fights up, fires body shots, then blocks to counter punch! The fans “YEET! YEET! YEET!” as Jey fires more hands! Jey then pops, locks ‘n’ ptus some stank on the HAYMAKER! Kofi runs up, blocks a kick and spins Jey, but Jey DRAGON WHIPS Kofi down! Jey sees Kross and Kofi in corners, “UCE! OH!” HIP ATTACK for Kofi! But Kross SUPERKICKS Jey! NO yeet!

Jey keeps moving, to SPEAR!! The fans fire up and Jey climbs up! USO SPLASH!! Cover, JEY WINS!\n\nWinner: Jey Uso, by pinfall\n\nYEET! Main Event Jey moves on to that huge Fatal 4 Way in two weeks! Who else joins Jey in that match? And can Jey still find his way to a title opportunity?\n\nGunther speaks.\n\nVia Instagram, Der Ring General let us know he is part of the WWE Europe tour run-up to Bash In Berlin, and over there, the people recognize his greatness. But do not misunderstand, Gunther’s focus is still aimed at Saturday. As much as SummerSlam went down in history as the day that Gunther saved this great sport, Bash In Berlin will be remembered as the day where Randy Orton finally met his match. And Der Ring General will leave Berlin still World Heavyweight Champion. But what will The Viper have to say in return? We find out next, because Orton is headed to gorilla!\n\nRandy Orton heads to the ring!\n\nRaw returns as Providence fires up for the Apex Predator. Orton steps in the ring, does his iconic pose on the corner, then gets a mic. Orton smiles as the fans cheer him on, and he says for almost the entirety of his career, he has listened to the voices in his head. But it seems as of late, the voices he listens to now are each and every one of the fans. He thanks them, they cheer, and Orton says he wants to thank them for singing along to his music. Orton would be remised if he didn’t say that it means the world to him. Even if it took them 15 years… But still, thank you. The fans cheer again, and Orton smiles.\n\n“Providence, listen to this. I have won a lot of titles throughout my career. But there’s one title, one world title in particular, that I loved most, and it’s the World Heavyweight Championship. Now the reason for that, is that is the first world title that I won. And I am the youngest man in history to have his name engraved on that belt.” The fans cheer that, and Orton says 10 years ago, he was given the honor, the privilege, to unify the two world titles WWE had at the time. And in that moment, Orton retired that World Heavyweight Championship, his name once again engraved upon it.\n\nNow a year ago, this NEW World Heavyweight Championship was born, but Orton wasn’t here. He was at home, recovering from spinal fusion surgery, and he didn’t know if he’d ever make it back here. But Orton knew that if God allowed him to compete and perform again, then he would deo everything in his power to one day make sure his name was engraved on this World Heavyweight championship! This Saturday in Berlin, Orton gets his opportunity. A new World Heavyweight Championship, a new title, and a new legacy. The fans chant “You Deserve It!” Orton takes a moment to soak that in.\n\nOrton continues by saying he does know he’ll be stepping into enemy territory in Berlin. He also knows he will be facing a living legend to Europe. Gunther is a European legend. But Orton also knows that he will be facing a man whose head is shoved so far up his own ass that Gunther has no idea that he’ll be facing the most dangerous, decorated, controversial yet successful this business has seen in almost 20 years. The fans cheer that! Orton then says that he grew up in front of each and every one of these fans. Orton signed to the WWE at 19 years old. The fans have watched him grow up, be humbled over and over again, and learn from his mistakes.\n\nEventually, Orton had to step out from behind the shadows, take out each of those shadows one by one, and earn every ounce of respect that comes with his name! When Gunther first stepped in, he was already a 30-something, egotistical little pr*ck! That might be the one thing that these two have in common. But the difference is that Orton was humbled. Gunther has never been put in his place. But this Saturday, that happens! All this title match ever had to be about was the title. That’s all! But Gunther had to make it personal. He talked about Orton’s family, and all the demons in Orton’s past he had to overcome.\n\nAnd yeah, Orton has faced his share of them. Each one of those demons was tougher than Gunther ever was. Orton beat those demons just like he’s gonna beat Gunther and become a FIFTEEN-TIME World Champion! And if you’re curious at all as to how Orton will do it, he’ll use the three most dangerous letters in sports entertainment: R K O! The Viper has responded to Gunther’s ultimatum with one of his own, but who will back up those words with a definitive victory?\n\nAlba Fyre & Isla Dawn speak.\n\n“All we’ve been told is that Jade & Bianca are an unstoppable force.” “Two mega powers, superheroes come to life, ready to demolish the tag division.” But then, why does The Unholy Union still have the belts? Everyone likes to roll out the red carpet for Jade & Bianca, from media to interviews, but what good does that do when the bell rings? They scoffed at Alba & Isla going into Clash at the Castle, saying these two didn’t have a chance. But look how it turned out! Just because everyone wants Jade & Bianca to be the best, doesn’t mean it’ll happen.\n\nSo in Berlin, Alba & Isla prove the doubters wrong, prove Jade & Bianca for the frauds that they are, and then walk out still your WWE Women’s Tag Team Champions! Will these wicked witches make their predictions a reality? Or will the StrongEST Duo prove a Triple Threat is far different from going 2v2?\n\nBronson Reed VS Braun Strowman!\n\nThese behemoths have said their parts, now it is time to see them fight it out! It is a kaiju monster movie come to live, will Auszilla use a Tsunami to wash away the Monster of All Monsters? Or will “Big Bronson” find he’s not as bad as this One Big SOB?\n\nRaw returns as The Colossal Aussie makes his entrance. The bell rings, the two run up, and Braun SHOTGUN DROPKICKS!

Bronson shoves Braun down, then HEADBUTTS him! Bronson runs to STEAMROLL SENTON! Braun flounders to a corner but Bronson goes after him.\n\nBronson RAMS into Braun again and again, but lets off as the ref counts. Bronson HEADBUTTS Braun, CLUBS him, then stands him up to CHOP! Braun just puts Bronson in the corner, to CHOP! The fans fire up, Braun gets moving, and he CROSSBODIES?! Bronson falls, Braun fires up, and Providence fires up as Braun watches Bronson. Bronson stands, Braun runs in again, but into a BOOT! Bronson goes up, to CROSSBODY back!! Braun bails out, Bronson catches his breath, these big men are going hard! Bronson BOOTS Braun down, then gets a wild idea to build speed! TITAN SIZED TOPE!! The fans lose their minds while both men are down, and Raw goes to break!\n\nRaw returns again and the hands are going back and forth! Braun gets the edge but Bronson kicks low then DDTs!

Bronson whips Braun into spare stage girders! Bronson picks a piece up, takes aim, but Braun choke grips! And he CHOKE SLAMS Bronson onto a car hood!!

Braun then runs up to POUNCE Bronson over another car hood!! This is not even a match anymore, it’s just a fight! Braun TOSSES Bronson onto a road case!\n\nBraun climbs up onto the cases to CLUB away on Bronson! But Bronson SMACKS Braun with a pipe! And CLUBS him on the back with it! Braun flounders onto the roof of a car, and Bronson climbs up onto a ledge!?! MEGA TSUNAMI onto Braun and the car!!! Windows are blown out, Adam Pearce and refs rush out, and Pearce shouts for medics to get out here! Providence is losing its mind, and someone just lost the deposit on their rental. But will either of these monsters be able to get back up?\n\nRaw returns and…\n\nMedics are checking Braun and Bronson. Braun can’t feel his fingers, and wait, Bronson is walking away under his own power! Just how unstoppable is the Colossal Aussie?!\n\nWWE Intercontinental Championship Contender’s Tournament Triple Threat: The Miz VS Xavier Woods VS Pete Dunne!\n\nThe A-Lister is most certainly synonymous with the WWE Intercontinental Championship, but he has a hard road back to that title picture. At the same time, New Day still has their shot at it, and The Bruiserweight is looking to get himself some gold once again. Will Dunne be the one to #FigureItOut?

Will Dunne also have what it takes to win that Fatal 4 Way? Who else will join them out of this star-studded Raw roster?\n\nBackstage interview with Bron Breakker.\n\nJackie Redmond is with the champion, and this tournament is officially underway. Surely he has been watching, what does he make of the field so far in Jey Uso and Pete Dunne? Bron says bravo. Great work by both guys. Jey Uso, yeet. Dunne, hard fought win for the Bruiserweight. But he also heard last week, Jey was namedropping Bron. Jey better watch his mouth. Because there has never been a member of Jey’s family that’s beat a member of Bron’s! Jey is not gonna be the one to do it. As for Dunne, beating Bron for the title? C’mon. Don’t think so.\n\nTo whoever wins this tournament, Bron promises them that he is “that dude, that dog,” THE Intercontinental Heavyweight Champion, “and the worst is yet to come.” The Big Bad Booty Nephew puts everyone on notice, but will he be the one to eat those words?\n\nAmerican Made gets a workout in.\n\nChad Gable finishes up a bench press, and he tells Uncle Howdy, “You call me a false prophet? I’m not the one that hides behind a mask. I’m not the one who sends my family to do my dirty work every week while I sit back and watch. That’s all you, Howdy: Completely false. But I know the man behind the mask. And tonight, the bell’s gonna ring, the lights are gonna go on, and everyone’s gonna find out that you’re just an ordinary guy. And you’re gonna tap out just like an ordinary guy, and you’re gonna find out that you’re dealing with someone that is anything but ordinary. I’m a genius! A master! An Olympian! And the guy that’s gonna lead The Creed Brothers and Ivy Nile to greatness! Tonight, you’re gonna find out that Chad Gable is American Made.”\n\nGable is ready to have it out with Bo Dallas, but will this genius find he still has much to learn about himself?\n\nDamian Priest & Rhea Ripley speak.\n\nThe Punisher says, “So The Judgment Day gave us an explanation. They explained why they stabbed us in the back. And they think we’re the bad guys. You damn right we’re the bad guys.” The Eradicator says, “It never felt so good to be so bad! And I mean, you guys made us the villains that you can’t live without.” Priest says they wanna play victims, but they won’t have to play at Bash In Berlin. Priest & Rhea will make Dom & Liv the victims. They didn’t become the most destructive forces in the WWE by being good. And at Bash In Berlin, the Terror Twins show no mercy. They will be the devils that are coming to end Judgment Day!\n\nWith as angry and determined as Priest & Rhea are, will Dom & Liv even make it back to the States? Or will they make sure not to go in there without some back-up?\n\nBREAKING NEWS on next week’s Raw!\n\nRaw will be live from Denver, Colorado, and the WWE Intercontinental Championship Contender’s Tournament continues! In one Triple Threat, we see Bronson Reed take on Sheamus and Ludwig Kaiser, plenty of animosity between all those men. In the other Triple Threat, Dominik Mysterio will take on Dragon Lee and Ilja Dragunov! Can Dirty Dom survive two dragons at once? Or will he be burned and left out of the Fatal 4 Way?\n\nChad Gable VS “Uncle Howdy” Bo Dallas!\n\nWhile Ivy Nile & The Creed Brothers see him out to the stage, they leave this in the hands of “Master Gable.” Will Gable be able to bring Bo Dallas back to reality? Or is he the one in denial and needs someone to slap some sense into him?\n\nThe lights go down, the fireflies come out, and the fog rolls in as the piano plays. Gable watches the eerie light as Uncle Howdy and the Wyatt Sick6 step out! Howdy picks up the lantern, and continues to lead the way. Then he blows the lantern out, the lights come back on, and Gable is clearly worried as he stands by the Hydration Station. Gable slowly returns to the ring, the fans rally behind Howdy, and the bell rings. They tie up, go around, and Howdy cravats for knee after knee! Then H"
