We have a set of episodes that patrons on Patreon voted on, and I’m preparing the first in the set, on the Byakkotai and the coopting of its memory in the ensuing decades after the Boshin War. But in order to do that, I need to finish reading Michael Wert’s Meiji Restoration Losers, the most recent text on the subject, so I need more time. So in the meantime, this week, I want to talk about something that’s going to be part of the long form history project, my monograph on Miyagi in the US occupation. As mentioned previously in patrons’ updates, the project is built in 4500 word increments.\n\nsuch that I cover each of the Occupation-era US bases and the history of the land they sit on, and while I’m working on Part 1 of the first base (Camp Schimmelpfenning, in Haranomachi, part of modern Sendai), here’s an even higher up, roughly 1500 word view of another, the Ōjōjihara Meneuver Area, which sits nestled among the mountains in Taiwa, Miyagi Prefecture. Today it’s a JGSDF base and range, but it was US-owned for awhile, and before that, it was property of the imperial army. So where did this all begin?\n\nOne: The Underfunded Post Station\n\nThe facility now called the Ōjōjihara Maneuver Area or Ōjōjihara Proving Ground began in Meiji 14– 1881- as the Ōhara Artillery Practice Range. At its inception, it was 495,850 square meters. Today, it’s over 46 million square meters, and represents the Self-Defense Forces’ largest maneuver range in eastern Japan. But I’d like to help you better appreciate why it’s there in the first place. The facility is run by nearby JGSDF Camp Taiwa, a military facility in the Yoshioka district of Taiwa, Miyagi Prefecture, roughly astride Japan National Route 4, which is the modern name for the old Ōu Highway.\n\nSo what is the deal here? What is the significance?\n\nFirst, to situate this in context of prior episodes on this podcast, we’re talking about the area around Mount Funagata, which we covered in a prior episode about the legends surrounding the Nanatsumori hills and their purported construction by the superhumanly strong Asahina Saburo. JGSDF Camp Taiwa is in Taiwa, but the territory of the Ōjōjihara Range is divided between the towns of Taiwa and Shikama, and the village of Ōhira. Stick the proverbial pin in that point about the three municipalities, because it’s going to be important later.\n\nDuring the Edo period, Yoshioka– in Kurokawa County– was a post station on the highway, and the seat of the Tadaki family’s 1500 koku holding. Tadaki was a Date retainer family, and together with Endō and Gotō, one of the 3 hereditary families of shukuro, the senior administrators who ran the domain’s day to day affairs. If you watch Japanese period drama and hear the title of “karo” used for a clan elder, that’s the same thing, just by a different name. Tadaki Nariyuki, better known as Tadaki Tosa, was the chief shukuro in the 1850s to 1860s, and both helped save the domain from financial insolvency and organized its leadership of the Northern Alliance during the Boshin War. But we can talk more in depth about him another time– we’re here to talk about Ōjōjihara.\n\nBecause of Sendai domain’s decentralized organization, Yoshioka had to be administered directly by the Tadaki family without help from the domain’s central government. Remember, the idea was that the domain was a microcosm of the national model where daimyo received income from their fiefdoms, which were territories that the Shogunate could confiscate and award, but which the holder otherwise controlled semi-independently. And so, as a post station, a horse relay station, and a vital strategic point along the road north from the Sendai Castle town, Yoshioka was important, even if it was financially difficult for the Tadaki family to administer without subsidy from the domain. Given that importance, it should come as no surprise that the imperial garrison in the region, which became the imperial army’s 2nd Division, had a post in Yoshioka, which grew into Camp Taiwa and the Ōjōjihara Maneuver Area. The imperial garrison was set up in the wake of the Boshin War and was headquartered in Sendai Castle, in order to ensure Sendai domain’s obedience, and wouldn’t you know it, its former headquarters was another US base during the Occupation, which will get its own chapter in the book that results from the long-form history project.\n\nTwo: Hidden Airfield to Joint Exercises\n\nDuring Ōjōjihara’s time as an imperial army installation, it took its present name, starting in 1912. But in the 1940s, the maneuver area rather notably was the site of a secret airbase slated for use during the anticipated allied invasion of Japan. In one of his historical videos, even Miyagi cultural touchstone and singer songwriter Kikkawa Danjuro mentions having heard talk of hidden aircraft around Miyagi turning up in the postwar years when he was growing up.\n\nAlmsot immediately after the war, US forces led by the 11th Airborne Division took charge of the Tohoku region and its military installations, and the Ōjōjihara Maneuver Area was preserved for US use. The 11th Airborne made regular use of these bases as part of the aggressive system of replacement training set up by General Joseph May Swing. The 11th remained in Miyagi through the end of the 1940s.\n\nSomething that seems to come up in my research for the long-form history project is that after the Korean War’s outbreak, the US didn’t quite seem to have a clear sense of what to do with its bases in Miyagi. They emptied out pretty quickly once units were sent off to the war, as with many such installations across Japan, which was still under US occupation at the time. While other units were shuffled in and out of the prefecture, they were never quite with the scale or purpose they’d had through 1949 and the departure of the 11th Airborne Division. So in 1958, together with the remaining US installations in Miyagi, the Ōjōjihara Maneuver Area was returned to the control of the Japanese government, and passed into the operational control of the garrison at Camp Taiwa. Despite this, the US has again used the facility since the 1980s, and even more so since the turn of the century, in part because of realignments, closures, and legal changes on Okinawa which restrict things like artillery training and other military exercises there. Today, both the US and the JSDF routinely conduct joint exercises in artillery, tank warfare, urban warfare, and attack helicopter based air support at Ōjōjihara, along with exercises at other ranges in Honshu and Hokkaido.\n\nThis is of course not without its problems for the community. Artillery pieces especially make a lot of noise, as do tank guns, and from the nearest point of the range to the nearest point of the Sendai city limits is just under 9 miles as the crow flies. That’s plenty close for people in the prefectural capital to hear the sound of howitzers. So the Japanese Ministry of Defense has to do a lot of community facing work in Taiwa, Shikama, and Ōhira, as well as Sendai proper, to give advance notice of field exercises and try to maintain some semblance of cordiality. But while Sendai residents mostly have to deal with what sounds like thunder, people who live in the 3 municipalities whose land the range sits on have to manage shaking ground and breaking windows.\n\nThree: Why Indeed\n\nHere’s where I can offer a measure of lived experience to further underline this.\n\nWhen I lived in Sendai, I lived nearby in the northernmost bit of Izumi, the city’s northern ward. Periodically I’d see JSDF trucks going north on Japan National Route 4, and didn’t think much of it– I didn’t know where the local SDF bases were at the time, let alone that Miyagi had so many of them. But that was the beginning of my interest in the Northern Alliance which led to my dissertation. I already knew about Tadaki Tosa’s role in the alliance’s organization, so I wanted to visit his grave in Taiwa. So I went up to the university’s international affairs office and asked for directions on how to get to Taiwa by public transit. An administrator with an incredulous look on her face said bluntly, “why on earth would you want to go there?”\n\nOf course, Japanese cultural norms being what they are, “no” is not polite, so I heard the unspoken no there, even if, when I pressed, she told me which bus would get me there, provided I was willing to walk a bit.\n\nWell, Mizuno-san, now I get it. Even if there’s Edo period history there, my question was kind of strange, given the thunder of artillery in the mountains.\n\nSources\n\n“‘Kokuonki’ Yukari no Chi” Taiwa Town.

Indeed, this is not a story told in one piece, either, but rather several pieces.\n\nBut seriously, folks. Let’s start from the Tamura family.\n\nThe Tamura family is a very old and very blue-blooded local elite family of northern Honshu. It claims descent from Sakanoue no Tamuramaro, the 9th century imperial general who led long, costly campaigns in the north that only partially succeeded in conquest, but which left a long trail of legends that survive even today. I should underline however that this origin of the Tamura family is not confirmed but rather claimed– either way, it’s the story the family tells itself about its own roots. Those who are familiar with the life of Date Masamune might recognize it as the birth family of his wife, Tamura Mego, daughter of Miharu Castle lord Tamura Kiyoaki. For those familiar on that level, it’s usually understood that the Tamura line briefly died out, before being reestablished at Lady Mego’s behest later in the 17th century, with one of her grandsons becoming the inheritor of the Tamura lineage and name. The reestablished Tamura family became daimyo of Ichinoseki domain, which is a curious case of a domain that both was and wasn’t independent, and whose daimyo owed two sets of alternate attendance obligations– one to the shogun, the other to the Date daimyo. But I’m getting off-track here.\n\nThe thing about the Tamura family is that it didn’t die out, and thus we get to Tamura Osaru– Osaru, written “boy monkey”– the subject of today’s episode. Born in the Shiroishi castle town, he was raised in Sendai Castle by the request of his aunt, Lady Mego. But we need to explain why it is that the Tamura line didn’t actually end with Mego but also wasn’t in a position to continue via primogeniture. This might get a little confusing, as noble families lineages tend to be anywhere in the world, so check out the blogpost for a graphic depicting the relations that’s going to follow this point in the script. With that said, here goes.\n\nMego’s father Kiyoaki adopted a nephew, Muneaki, who inherited Tamura headship. But as we’ve seen in recent weeks, Toyotomi Hideyoshi in 1590 either affirming or denying landholdings of local lords in the Tohoku region cut both ways, and the Tamura were just one local lordly family that lost its holdings after Hideyoshi issued his settlement for the north. We saw another case of it recently, in the Waga and Hienuki families, who Masamune tried to coopt in making a grab for territory north of his northernmost border. After Hideyoshi’s orders stripped him of his domain and income, Tamura Muneaki changed his name to Ushikubi Sadaaki, and lived in Shiroishi under the care of the Katakura family, who were high level Date vassals and held the one on-the-record extra castle the Shogunate allowed Sendai domain to possess.\n\n“Ushikubi” is a pretty Monty Python worthy name, as you can interpret it as meaning “Cowstrangler.” This Ushikubi Sadaaki, living somewhat incognito compared to his prior status, had two sons, Sadahiro and Osaru. By then, Sendai domain was secure and it was the early Edo period, and so they were cared for directly by their aunt and uncle, which is why Osaru, born in 1614, was raised in Sendai Castle and was named Osaru by his aunt.\n\nIn 1627, by Masamune’s order, Osaru and his brother Sadahiro succeeded not to the Tamura name but the Katakura name. This was not of the main Katakura line, who were the Sendai retainers who held Shiroishi Castle whose town was where the two brothers were born, but of Masamune’s wetnurse Katakura Kita. Thus, Tamura Osaru became Katakura San’emon– alias Katakura Yoshitane– and headed a separate lineage of the Katakura name under the auspices of the Katakura castellan of Shiroishi.\n\nHunting, Beating, and Frighteningly Deadly Skills\n\nStarting in the days of second generation Sendai daimyo Date Tadamune, Yoshitane was a frequent companion on lordly hunting trips. As we’ve said on the podcast many times before, hunting trips during the Edo period weren’t just because hunting– usually involving trained hunting birds– was a mark of lordly culture and daimyo wanted to keep up appearances. It was also a way of disguising military exercises in a socially acceptable way that didn’t violate the letter of the Shogunate’s law. During Masamune’s reign, Sendai domain developed an extensive network of hunting grounds both in the domain and in the vicinity of Edo, a regular rotation of hunting at these locations, and its hunting birds were said to eat better than the humans assigned to care for them. In short, the Date family took hunting– and the things that were disguised as hunting– seriously.\n\nYoshitane was by this point an experienced hunter and leader of hunting parties to the point of seeming to accomplish impossibly large kill counts during these lordly trips. Leading parties of beaters numbering in the thousands– beaters are people that drive the hunted animals out of cover by making loud noises with sticks or other tools– he would net a couple thousand deer at a time, and on one occasion even as many as three thousand. We know this because Yoshitane set up monuments to honor the spirits of the deer he took in these hunts, and they survive in that part of Miyagi Prefecture even today.\n\nThe Origins of Aoba-ryū matagi technique\n\nBy Tadamune’s order, Yoshitane’s hunting skill was acknowledged, and he was named as the head of Sendai domain’s official tradition of matagi techniques– Aoba-ryū, the Aoba tradition, after the new castle in Sendai where Osaru was raised.\n\nNow here’s where we have to sidebar again.\n\nLast week we talked in general about matagi as both a community and a loosely grouped set of hunting techniques and beliefs in northern Honshu that first emerged from the long, long contact of Yamato settlers and Emishi locals as the north was brought into the empire but remained “inside yet outside.” Yes, this is centuries after that, in the 17th century, and not only that, it’s a matagi tradition that’s established by order of the north’s preeminent political power in that era. But if we read between the lines, I think we might surmise that Yoshitane picked up at least some of these techniques as a result of paying attention to how hunters already operating in Sendai domain hunted, in his younger years. Yoshitane was known for having a deep understanding of the domain’s terrain far beyond what someone of his status usually possessed– he had to have learned that from somewhere. We must also remember that the Date daimyo, starting from Masamune, saw themselves as heirs to the mantle of northern primacy that had once rested with the Northern Fujiwara and their Emishi forbears. So yes, it’s a bit latter-day, this Aoba tradition, and it had the backing of a major domain, but it doesn’t come out of nowhere and it isn’t just because of one man’s extreme hunting skills.\n\nAoba-ryū survived the Boshin War, but is no longer extant. Today, most matagi live not in Miyagi but in nearby Akita Prefecture.\n\nEpilogue: Between the Rivers\n\nAccording to the inscription on his grave in Shiroishi, Katakura Yoshitane– alias Tamura Osaru– died in 1712 at 98 years of age, during the reign of 7th shogun Tokugawa Ietsugu and 5th generation Sendai daimyo Date Yoshimura. He is buried beside his brother Sadahiro. In a hunting career spanning five generations of Sendai daimyo and even surviving the tumult that was the fractious Date clan of the late 17th century– the period that gave us the kabuki plays based on that discord– Yoshitane had amassed thousands and thousands of deer, serow, bears, and even wolves as kills. His descendants continued in Date service through 1871, albeit as rear-vassals– they were retainers of the Katakura family of Shiroishi, rather than drawing their income from the Date daimyo himself.\n\nBut there’s a curious postscript to this story.\n\nJapan’s 11th ambassador to Iraq, who held the office during the Gulf War, was the last Japanese ambassador in Baghdad until diplomatic relations were resumed the early 2000s. He and his wife were an authorial team, and wrote a great deal about Japanese perspectives on the Islamic world. As I write this, he’s still alive today, and is in his 90s. Who was this man who undertook such a job amidst times that were more and more full of long odds?\n\nHe is Tamura Osaru’s male-line descendant, Katakura Kunio.\n\nSources\n\nKobayashi Seiji.

The events are graphic, awful, and only a small glimpse into the hell that was Mamuret ul Aziz vilayet from 1915 to 1918 at the hands of the Young Turks who led the Ottoman government. But to quote the closing words of the piece, it was written lest we forget, and I felt it my duty to translate, annotate, and release to the English speaking world. I will explain why in the historical essay that follows.\n\nThe article, one of many by the author, appeared in the Boston-based Hairenik newspaper, Vol. LVIII, no. 13,569, on Friday, 7 December 1956, nearly 40 years after the events it describes. Bear that in mind as you read, for that, too, is its own victory.\n\n“The Closure of the American Consulate in Kharpert: Lest We Forget”\n\nOn Sunday mornings, before first light, we would carefully slip out of Mezire to the killing fields. The wind would bring to our nostrils the stench of decaying bodies. That day there were five of us on horseback– two cavasses, me, Dr. Atkinson, and consul Davis. In the forest from a distance we noticed a hanged man, and directed our horses in that direction. Before our eyes appeared a horrifying sight. In that killing field the butchers had enacted all the types of murder, on more than fifty Armenian men, some of them hanged, some of them butchered like sheep, some of them burned, others dismembered with axes, others they’d strangled with rope and water, and they’d dug out the eyes of many. After photographing all of this carefully, we descended into the valley. There we saw about three hundred bodies, which were half buried in the sand after the flooding rains. After that we went to the other side, to the nearby village, and came upon an elderly Turkish man.\n\nDr. Atkinson asked, “Old man, who killed this many people?” the old man said “Don’t ask, efendi, don’t ask, the police brought the infidels here, those poor women and children, and confined them in that valley hungry and thirsty, they shot anyone who tried to escape, and after keeping them there for days, most of them died. The police didn’t wait for all of them to die– they came to our village, beat us, and drove us out of our homes, insisting that we go and kill those who still lived. The village didn’t have any men apart from us elders, all had gone to be soldiers. The women, the children, the boys, we all armed ourselves with scythes and axes and boards. The scene was awful, those who were still alive were so worn and sick that with arms outstretched they begged us for a quick death. I killed six women with my own hands. Those poor souls’ pleading won’t leave my ears. My life’s end is close, and how shall I stand before Allah to give account of my life with my hands so bloodied?”\n\nWe’d given word to the governor about that inspection trip. He called me to the serail and said “I heard the consul leaves the city and takes pictures despite it being strictly forbidden. Because of the war, the country’s safety is shaky, and on the mountains there are many deserters from the Army as well as Armenian fedayi, and if anything happens to the consul’s life, I am not responsible. In times like these, you must not leave the city to go sightseeing.” I notified the consul of that veiled threat, and after that we never left much.\n\nCorps commander Mehmed Wehbi bey spoke French with the consul. One day during a visit he expressed an interest in learning English. The consul took every opportunity to win the friendship of the highest Turkish officials, and told him ‘my interpreter is an able teacher and will gladly teach you twice a week.’ Without informing me, they decided on Tuesdays and Thursdays at 8 PM. At that time a soldier with a lantern was to come to the consulate and escort me to Wehbi bey’s quarters, and after lessons the same soldier was to return me to the consulate.\n\nI told the consul that this might be a plot against my life, and it might be that one evening they take me and don’t bring me back. The consul laughed at my idea and said that that kind of ingratitude of asking for a teacher and then taking them to be slaughtered was unthinkable and impossible. But it seems that he too felt that that might happen, because until he heard my voice on return, he would not go to bed.\n\nAfter two or three lessons I would find [Wehbi bey] before the table laid out with a mixed rakhi drink and snacks, his head hot [with drink] and not in a frame of mind to learn. We would speak of all manner of topics, and this continued for some months and we became friendly.\n\nIn his drunk state, he would give me news from the battlefronts that was the sort that I clearly knew were military secrets. He would show me telegrams. I was afraid that these were traps to arrest me at gunpoint, but this did not happen.\n\nOn Sunday, 3 May 1917, I sat alone in the consulate’s garden, the bloody scenes of massacre playing out in my mind like a film. Somehow the starry flag flying from atop the consulate building caught my eye, fluttering against the spring wind. I wondered if someday I’d be able to pass through this valley of the shadow of death, and reunite with my family– my two young boys and my elderly father and mother who because of their trade had escaped the slaughter and eagerly awaited my return to my birthplace of Marsovan.\n\nI, as eyewitness to slaughter and ruin, knew these animals by their names and their crimes and I could point to them personally on the Day of Judgment. But I also called to mind the famous Turkish maxim that says “A severed head tells no secrets.”\n\nI was convinced the Ittihad-ve-Terraki would not leave me alive; my only hope and shelter was American protection. I wanted to live by that faith that immediately after this terrible slaughter would dawn the sun of the Armenian nation’s freedom. Someone who’s seen thousands of dead bodies has a strange feeling, an inexplicable mental state, death doesn’t cause much fear anymore, it brings an indifference to you. You accept that these dead had no less reason to live than you do.\n\nLetters from our embassy in Istanbul started to grow increasingly delayed, and in those that arrived there seemed to be a mood of ill portent, a meaning one might guess. While I was lost in these thoughts, someone banged strongly on the door. I went and opened it personally. The Lord Commissar Ahmed strood before me, straightened himself out, and said “America has declared war against our powerful ally Germany, the Ottoman government has severed ties with America. The governor demands that you immediately take that flag down” and left.\n\nI hurried to tell the consul of this news. Mr. Davis was taken by surprise, and internal employee Mr. Garabed Bedrosian, myself, and the consul went out to the balcony and from its staff lowered the flag and, kissing it tenderly, folded it and stowed it in its tin case, and removed the coat of arms from the outer door. I felt we were lost already, it was like the axe had fallen on my neck. At that moment I remembered one of my students at the imperial high school who announced that he wanted to personally sever my neck. The next week, Morgenthau’s secret order arrived, by which he notified us that the minister of internal affairs has allowed that the consulate with all its employees, as well as all American citizens, were allowed to come to Istanbul. For our safety would be provided policemen. Get going as soon as you can, burn all writings that are damaging to the Turkish state and people, destroy the consulate’s seal, lock the building and give the key to the governor. Those orders brought me great hope.\n\nThat week, the governor was dismissed from his post. Corps commander Mehmed Wehbi bey was chosen as interim governor. I immediately made a list of our employees, the missionaries, and a few Armenian women who were US citizens and gave it to my student, Wehbi bey, and he was very happy and congratulated me on my upcoming trip to Istanbul. He called the police chief and ordered that documents be prepared for everyone on my list and give them to me at once. The hour was already late, and the police said come tomorrow to receive the documents. That night, Ali Ihsan bey, the new governor, arrived from Istanbul. The police chief showed him my list, and the governor struck out every name that ended in “ian.” I was again caught in a trap.\n\nThat entire night I burned all the damaging papers in the consulate’s washroom and destroyed the consulate’s seal. the governor did not accept the consulate’s keys. On the 16th of May, the preparations for the trip were complete. Exhausted, I fell into bed, and suffered sleepless until 3 AM, when I saw a dream that has never left me. In my dream, I found myself in Cairo where I had an honorable friend named Toros Torosian, and I was in his shop. I embraced him and in my relief I shouted, “Toros agha, congratulate me, I quickly escaped death! Congratulate me!” But my joy did not last. The cavass [Garabed Bedrosian] came into my bedroom to wake me.\n\nThe dark clouds engulfed my soul on 17 May 1917. The missionaries came from the upper city, all of them on horseback, and there came also 12 police, and departed shortly thereafter. There were two of us hopeless Armenians there, I held the right stirrup of Consul Davis’s horse, Mr. Garabed held the left stirrup, with the Americans following behind us. We passed in front of the serail and walked until Khan Springs. The police made us all stand there and carefully inspected the names, and sent us two Armenians back toward Mezire.\n\nUtterly spent and hopeless I fell to the ground, and the consul and his entourage soon passed from our sight. I wanted to resign myself to my fate and end my miserable life, but Mr. Garabed did not allow me, he took me to his home and encouraged me.\n\nIn those days, there was a big typhus epidemic in Mezire. Mr. Ehmann’s interpreter and the director of the orphanage, Mr. Haroutune Dikijian, had died 3 days after getting infected. Mr. Ehmann called me to his service and I moved to the Germans’ building.\n\nLest we forget.\n\nSome Historical Context and A Few Remarks from a Descendant\n\nI am a historian of Japan by training, but the source translated above has commanded my attention because it intersects with my own history, and involves historical figures that might not be world-famous but are nonetheless significant to my people’s darkest chapter. As such, I’d like to offer a few remarks to contextualize some of the above.\n\nHaroutune Pekmezian (1880?-1960) was my great grandfather. He was clerk and interpreter to Mezire-based US consul Leslie A. Davis, during the years of the Armenian Genocide. (For those unfamiliar, Mezire was the lower, newer city; Kharpert was the older, upper city, Husenig was the community just to the east of Mezire; all are shorthanded by Armenians today as “Kharpert” and form the modern city of Elazig)\n\nHe saw some deeply heinous, unspeakable things, and nearly gave up on life, yet amidst it all he never let go of his humanity. Even here, with a price on his head, he was still trying his best to do the work to survive and help others survive, too. What’s more, his grief for his Turkish neighbors– coerced into complicity in genocide by their government’s army– is also palpable.\n\nThough he died long before I was born, I have heard from elders who knew him that aside from brave, he was strong-willed to the point that he didn’t care what people thought of him. Amusingly, one elder remembers him as having sung along to movies in the theater. He was writing practically until the day he died. He liked York Peppermint Patties. He remained forever haunted by what he saw, but the more important thing is, he lived and saw his children and grandchildren live. And now here am I, having translated his words, further embodiment of his victory. A worthy legacy for a man whose name means “resurrection.”\n\nWehib bey— better known as Wehib Pasha (1877-1940), was an Ottoman Army general. A year after the events covered in the close of this article, he commanded the Ottoman forces at the Battle of Sardarabad, where he was defeated by an Armenian army led by Movses Silikyan and Tovmas Nazarbekian. An outspoken critic of the Young Turk regime’s genocide of the Armenians, he was later rendered stateless by the Kemalist government– and Wehib Pasha himself despised Kemal. He commanded Ethiopian forces against the Italian fascists in the 1930s. Wehib Pasha returned to Turkey shortly before his death in 1940.\n\nWhile he decried the genocide, and today is one of the important eyewitnesses cited by historians, he was still a high Turkish official and my great grandfather’s discomfort at being forced to be friendly with him is, I think, entirely understandable.\n\nAli Ihsan bey— better known as Ali İhsan Pasha (1882-1957)– was likewise an Ottoman Army officer and high government official. He commanded the VI Corps during the fighting in Iraq against the British. He was notorious for having ordered the deaths of many Armenians, and claimed to have killed some with his own hands. He also claimed to have been personally responsible for the deaths of half a million Armenians.\n\nEven in his brief appearance in my great grandfather’s writing, Ali Ihsan Pasha’s meticulous attention to dispossessing and murdering Armenians– even those who were American citizens– is clear.\n\nDr. Henry Herbert Atkinson (1870-1915) was an American physician and missionary active in Kharpert in those years. We see him in the beginning of the article, documenting the slaughter together with my great grandfather and Mr. Davis. Atkinson’s wife Tacy’s diary of the Genocide years, underlining German complicity, is aptly titled “The German, the Turk and the devil made a triple alliance.” Dr. Atkinson died in 1915 of typhus during the epidemic in Kharpert, as did many of the Armenians he struggled to save.\n\nGarabed Bedrosian (1883-1977) was the cavass– the bodyguard– of the American consulate from 1905 to 1917. Leading a convoy of orphans out of Kharpert in 1922 to Syria, he eventually settled in Fresno and lived a long, full life as a farmer and lay leader of the Armenian Brethren Church. It is because of his words lifting my great grandfather out of suicidal despair that I exist today. If his descendants should read this, I want them to know that my family is in their debt, and that I hope they have made as much of the “dawn[ing] the sun of the Armenian nation’s freedom” as we have.\n\nAnd finally, Leslie A. Davis (1876-1960) was the American consul for whom my great grandfather worked. A New Yorker by birth, he was first a lawyer and later a career diplomat.\n\nWorking in Kharpert was especially remote for a US diplomatic posting, but Davis saved as many lives as he could, documented as much as he could, and continued to do his best to help Armenians long after his assignment to Kharpert ended. His reports are usually cited together with those of his superior on that diplomatic mission, Istanbul-based Ambassador Henry Morgenthau.\n\nHis report on the Genocide in Kharpert is aptly, and starkly, titled The Slaughterhouse Province.\n\nI would like to close these remarks by making an observation. Lake Dzovk– which the Turks now call Lake Hazar– was one of the places in the “Slaughterhouse Province” where the Ottoman state piled the bodies of the dead high.\n\nBut it was not always so.\n\nTime was that Lake Dzovk was where the local population, Armenians included, went there for picnicking, swimming, and boating. Time was, Armenians, Turks, Greeks, Assyrians, Kurds, all were neighbors. In my view, we Armenians especially do a grave disservice to the past if our image of Lake Dzovk is forever stuck in 1915 and the mountains of dead.\n\nIt was not always like this, in a land where government fiat still dictates silence, denial, and erasure of any trace of the indigenous population.\n\nIt was not always like this. It does not have to stay like this.\n\nSo it behooves us to remember what was, before– in Turkish poet Nazim Hikmet’s words– the Young Turks “smeared this black stain on the forehead of the Turkish people.” We can fight for what can yet be, in the name of the liberation of all of Anatolia’s children, including Armenians and Turks. We can tear down the walls of silence and denial that hurt us all.\n\nIf only we fight for it, for the sun on Lake Dzovk, then we, too, can have resurrection.\n\nSources\n\nTaner Akçam.

Unlike the court’s conquest and annexation of southern Kyushu, in one scholar’s words it remained “inside but outside” the rest of the empire. One especially visible reminder of this is that the names given to the two massive provinces the empire created, Mutsu and Dewa, survived until 1871. Because of how the empire expanded its early claim in the north, local elites among the Emishi peoples– I say peoples because we don’t know if they were one people or many– cemented their status. The empire opted for what had seemed an efficient course of action by simply keeping local elites in place and putting them in charge of newly created districts or counties in that area. This backfired, and cemented the development of strong regional semiautonomy which merged Emishi authority with Yamato authority and began a tradition that survived in political form through 1868 and in some cultural forms still survives today.\n\nDespite this imperfect and ultimately failed attempt at completely subduing local autonomy, another part of how the court expanded its reach was by gradually northward advancing frontier settlement via a campaign of armed colonization beginning from the turn of the 8th century. The settler-soldiers in this project initially numbered 6,000, the number peaked at 10,000 in 768; by the late 9th century it settled at around 8,000. And together with that settlement, there was a tense cultural exchange that necessarily followed with the non-Yamato peoples to the north, in practices, in beliefs, and in language.\n\nOne of the byproducts of this was the emergence of the mountain hunting communities called matagi, which are attested from the late Heian era (1180s). And as ever with these things, say it with me now, it’s complicated.\n\nTwo: Symbiosis\n\nFirst, let’s understand who matagi are. The matagi are a community of hunters who share loosely connected language, beliefs, and practices. They were historically spread broadly across northern Honshu in the Tohoku region and Niigata Prefecture in the adjoining Hokuriku region. Today, though, most of the surviving matagi communities are in Akita Prefecture. “Matagi” is just the most common term for them– different parts of the region had slightly different names for them.\n\nBear, deer, and serow– and now more often specifically bear, as the serow is protected– are the animals they usually hunt. There are different traditions of hunting techniques for matagi– we’ll be talking about Aoba-ryu, the matagi tradition in Sendai domain, next week. But whatever the particular tradition, the matagi exist in a symbiosis with the terrain and the animals they hunt, which they usually hunt in wintertime. They use rifles today, but also a traditional tool called a nagasa, which is a kind of utility knife with a hollow handle for ease of attaching to a pole and turning into a spear. A regular companion on these trips would be Akita dogs, which if you’re not familiar are sort of like if a Shiba inu– you know, like the doge meme– were taller. The Akita dogs are still known for having been the preferred canine colleagues of the matagi. You might not know the Akita dogs as a breed, but you might know the name of Hachikō, the loyal dog who waited at Ueno Station for his deceased human and is now commemorated by a statue there– Hachikō was an Akita-born Akita dog.\n\nTo get a visual sense of matagi and their methods and equipment today, check out the video in the blogpost version of this episode– it’s short, but if you’ve never seen modern matagi before, I think it’s a good introduction.\n\nThe matagi also have their own spirituality focused on the animals they hunted, showing them respect by wasting none of their bodies, and reaffirming their interconnection. To me, as a Shintoist, this sense of interconnection is familiar– we believe that everyone and everything is a part of Great Nature (daishizen). But the matagi also have their own dialect of Japanese, which shares some cognates with Aynu-itak, the language of the Ainu people. But weren’t we talking about Emishi? Ah, but stay with me– here is where it gets especially interesting and tells us something about regional interconnection.\n\nThree: The Emishi, the Matagi, and the Ainu\n\nWe need to begin by understanding a point of interconnectedness in the region– or reiterating it, since on this podcast it comes up so much. The polity ruled from Hiraizumi by the Northern Fujiwara had trade networks that connected it not only to the Yamato state to the south, but to mainland Asia to the west and to what today is called Hokkaido and the Kuriles, to the north. Indeed, the Northern Fujiwara were called by one 20th century author “lords of the sea,” in contrast to the Taira who were lords of the land, for how connected they were over the water to the rest of the world. Tosaminato– the port whose ruins are now part of Goshogawara, Aomori Prefecture– was one of the major ports of Michinoku under the Northern Fujiwara that served as a conduit for this trade. But we must remember also that the Northern Fujiwara were, as I’ve mentioned often on this podcast before, of mixed Yamato and Emishi origin, and combined the imperial court’s authority together with local Emishi sources of legitimacy to cement their claim to rule. As archaeologist Mark Hudson observes, the archaeological record underlines just how far the Northern Fujiwara were connected by trade to the rest of the world, and how that trade had an influence in driving the development of Ainu culture to the north. Goods flowed in both directions, yes– seal fur and eagle feathers, for instance, came south from Hokkaido, and horses from Michinoku went south into the land ruled by the Yamato court. But also, Ainu people themselves came south to the lands which Hiraizumi controlled, and they didn’t simply stop when the Kamakura Shogunate destroyed Hiraizumi and the Northern Fujiwara. In parts of Aomori Prefecture, there were Ainu well into the Edo period, and we discussed this in a past episode about Tsugaru domain military activity in Hokkaido early in the Edo period, where these Ainu served as interpreters. So with that said, it should come as no surprise that there are Ainu influences on place names in the Tohoku region, particularly from Sendai on north, and on the matagi culture’s language in particular. Indeed, the word “matagi” itself is cognate with the Ainu word “matangi,” which also means “hunter.” I’ve seen some dispute over whether Japanese got that particular word from Ainu or the other way around, but I feel like that debate is missing the point. The point, to me, is that in this context the linguistic connection between Ainu and the matagi is less unusual and more a mark of that regional interconnection. The world of the Northern Fujiwara, who were Emishi that had risen high and carved out the nearest thing to an independent Michinoku, was a part of and important driver of that web.\n\nFour: “Tanigaki-nispa”\n\nThe matagi of course still exist today, albeit fewer in number. There are museums about them, including the Matagi Shiryōkan in the city of Kitaakita. But they have also, perhaps unsurprisingly, had an enduring place in popular depictions. Right now, perhaps the most famous one is the manga and anime Golden Kamuy. An imperial army sniper named Tanigaki Genjirō, who begins as an antagonist and then becomes an ally, is a matagi. He has an understanding of the Ainu communities in the story that is superior to that of other Japanese characters. This makes sense, given the Ainu influence on matagi stretching back nearly a millennium. There’s also a 1994 novel by Haji Eisai called Matagi Monomitai Tenmatsu (Particulars of the Matagi Scout Troop), which follows matagi in the Boshin War; Haji also wrote a 2011 novel featuring matagi, called Matagi Hanzō Jikenjō.\n\nIn my own prior work, in the background writing I did for my 2020 debut novel Grey Dawn, Leigh’s maternal grandmother Shigeko came from a matagi family. This didn’t come up directly in the book as published, but it did contribute to one pretty important point of the story which was there throughout.\n\nIn memory of her Japanese matagi ancestors, Leigh kept her original paternal surname of Hunter.\n\nSources\n\n____.

Luke Roberts, professor of history at UC Santa Barbara, wrote a really good book on this called Performing the Great Peace, and I highly recommend it– it’s available for borrowing for free on Archive.org, and it’s worth the read. And one of the chapters has a name that sounds suspiciously like a zombie movie, and for good reason: Politics of the Living Dead.\n\nIn short, until a domain officially announced its lord’s death, the daimyo wasn’t actually, officially, for real dead. And believe it or not, an undead daimyo could actually come in handy for a domain, as Roberts explains in great detail.\n\nSo, let’s explore this per what Roberts describes, based on the historical record. Obviously individual cases could vary, but we’re trying to get a general, broad sense of what’s entailed here with the whole undead daimyo thing.\n\nDaimyo dies without an heir. The domain’s in trouble– with no heir, the Shogunate has every reason to confiscate the domain and give the land to another lord– what in English is called by the now archaic term “attainder.” If the daimyo’s death is confirmed, and the domain gets attaindered, the vassals all automatically become ronin and they’re shit out of luck.\n\nBut until the daimyo’s officially announced as dead, there’s still time to save the day. So I need you to imagine the retainers of this undead daimyo going around the back doors of daimyo estates in Edo and banging on them furiously and asking in an overdramatic whisper, YOU GOT ANY SPARE BABIES?\n\nAnd all the while, the Shogunate already knows the daimyo’s dead.\n\nLet me say that again, this whole song and dance so far, the Shogunate knows. But until propriety has been observed and the daimyo’s death has been officially announced, the daimyo isn’t actually dead.\n\nSometimes this was a really fast deal, with the situation getting fixed and the daimyo’s death getting formally reported as close as 2 days off from the daimyo’s actual death. In one case Roberts notes, the difference was as gigantic as 104 days, in the case of Miyake Yasuaki of Tahara domain, who died 7/10/1827 and whose official death date was 10/23/1827. I know, I know. The smell…\n\nBut anyway, let’s get back to this hypothetical undead daimyo, shall we?\n\nA lot of daimyo families would indeed often have “spare babies,” because after all, this is a system that operates on primogeniture, which means only the firstborn, or the child considered the firstborn, gets the headship, and it’s helpful to have spares. If the others are fortunate, they get their own stipend and get to live comfortably at their sibling’s estate, or maybe they get lucky and they get their own landholding split off and they get stood up as their own daimyo. But more often than not, they only got to live as dependents of their parents and eldest sibling, so getting adopted out to other daimyo families to inherit *their* headship was, in fact, something of a step up. So yes, there were spare babies.\n\nSo the retainers of the undead daimyo find a spare baby. But the undead daimyo is still technically alive, so the Shogunate has to come witness him adopting the baby, right?\n\nAnd again, the Shogunate knows the daimyo’s undead. This is all happening with tacit understanding, because the appearance of following the law is what’s paramount.\n\nSo they invite the Shogunate’s inspector to a ceremony. The undead daimyo is half obscured by a folding screen. And I need you to imagine the ensuing scene: the retainers go in behind hte screen and say WHAT’S THAT, YOUR LORDSHIP WISHES TO ADOPT THIS BABY AS YOUR HEIR?\n\nWHAT’S THAT, YOU WISH TO ADOPT THIS BABY AS YOUR LITERAL LAST ACT BEFORE DYING?\n\nHERE, LET ME HELP YOUR LORDSHIP STAMP THE DOCUMENT.\n\nAnd they’d bring out the document, show the inspector, and the inspector would duly recognize the inheritance. And then from behind the screen, the other retainer would declare OH NO, HIS LORDSHIP IS DECEASED. LAMENTATIONS.\n\nSo now the zombie daimyo was actually proper dead, with the Shogunate inspector in attendance.\n\nBut that’s not all.\n\nSometimes this would all happen entirely under the radar.\n\nConsider the case of Nanbu Toshimochi, who was actually two people– one of them 1808-1821, the other 1803-1825. Nanbu Toshimochi A became lord at 12. But before he could be received in audience by the shogun and have his title and everything else recognized, he died suddenly after roughhousing in the estate garden one day. Story goes he fell out of a tree and just died.\n\nAnd so the Nanbu domain replaced him with a cousin, who they also named Nanbu Toshimochi, who immediately succeeded his predecessor at the age of 18. To this day, the official version of the Nanbu lineage subsumes both into one person who was the 11th generation daimyo of Morioka. But the Shogunate didn’t particularly make an issue out of it, and so Morioka wasn’t attaindered and survived until 1871.\n\nIn general, this points to a bigger issue that I think we need to keep in mind, which is that some of these rules in the Tokugawa system that we think were ironclad and punishable by death, weren’t actually as ironclad as they seem. The closed-country edicts, the one castle per domain rule, and even the policy of attainder if a daimyo died without an heir, all had fuzzy boundaries and lots and lots of exceptions to the point that we need to be careful of how we think of them. Thinking of them in the sense of laws in a modern polity isn’t *quite* what fits. There were the facts, and then there were the “facts”– you can’t see me doing the scarequotes but imagine me doing the scarequotes– the data points as the official parties involved all agreed to.\n\nI want to quote Roberts here:\n\n“For modern historians to use this information as facts in the modern sense, as if the Tokugawa had worked according to the logic of a modern nation, is not being sensitive to how deeply history writing itself is bound by historical context.”\n\nIn other words, there’s facts, and then there’s the official version of events, and the people in the Tokugawa system– in the Shogunate and in the domains– understood the distinction, and so should we. We should also remember the thing that my methodology professor said in my first week of grad school that so shook my world: “you do know ‘history’ isn’t ‘what actually happened,’ right?”\n\nIt’s true. The events of the past are not the things we write about the events of the past.\n\nTo sum this all up, as Roberts puts it, the Tokugawa Shogunate– which operated on the basis of the appearance of propriety and open political secrets, like the zombie daimyo situation– maintained order by performing order. Which I guess comes down to what I’ve been arguing on this podcast and elsewhere for a long time now, both in my capacity as an author of fiction as well as my capacity as an historian: stories have power. To quote Roberts again, “it is certainly important for historians to be aware of the complex politics of omote [public] and naisho [secret], if only because these politics influenced the documentary record in ways that cannot be ignored.”\n\nAnd with that, I will see you next time.\n\nSources\n\n“Nanbu Toshimochi.” Kotobank.jp, Accessed 24 August 2023.\n\nLuke Roberts.

What’s more, his neighbors, especially on the other side of the Ōū Mountains and north of Esashi County, weren’t always on the best of terms with him at the turn of the 17th century. And today we’re going to talk about his family’s relationship with house Nanbu of Morioka Domain– and what all of this has to do with a hollow between two mounds.\n\nMasamune Tries to Have His Cake and Eat it Too\n\nIn the immediate aftermath of the Sekigahara Campaign, Date Masamune was gunning to get a boost to his domain, because he’d thrown in with Tokugawa Ieyasu and secured Ieyasu’s northern flank by engaging the Uesugi clan at the battle of Hasedō and at Shiroishi in Katta County. Ieyasu promised to bump Masamune’s income up to 1 million koku. And in typical fashion, Masamune tried to have his cake and eat it too, so he figured that while Ieyasu was distracted, he’d just try to provoke a revolt north of his border in Nanbu territory and then swoop in in the name of restoring order. So he supplied weapons and logistics support to survivors of the Waga and Hienuki clans, two local clans in that area’s Isawa and Waga Counties, part of which were ruled by the Nanbu clan in 1600. Waga Yoshitada and Hienuki Hirotada, each clan’s respective lord, had lost their fiefdoms when Toyotomi Hideyoshi issued the Ōshū Settlement in 1590 and either confirmed or dispossessed local lords in the Tohoku region. Their sons, Waga Yoshichika and Hienuki Shigemasa, led the 1600 uprising with Date aid, and failed almost immediately. Indeed, Nanbu Toshinao, the Nanbu daimyo, wrote to Masamune demanding answers about the uprising because Date markings were found on captured Waga and Hienuki weapons– a letter to which Masamune gave a lengthy non-answer hemming and hawing about how busy he was. But the word reached Ieyasu, and this effectively ended the chances of the income boost, though Masamune got to keep the land in Katta County to his south, which his forces had taken from the Uesugi clan in battle. So in short, Date and Nanbu went into the Edo period amid bad blood. But what they also had was a poorly defined border running from the Ōū Mountains in Esashi County to the Pacific coast in eastern Kesen County. But given that they were both astride two major routes of travel and commerce– the Ōshū Highway and the Kitakami River– they were going to have to work out some kind of agreement.\n\nOn Things that Slip Through the Space Between Mounds\n\nMasamune did not live to see the settlement by which both domains drew the border. That settlement instead came during the reign of Masamune’s son Tadamune and Nanbu Toshinao’s son Shigenao. After a survey, the two domains erected 68 large mounds along their border in 1642, 6 years after Masamune’s death. Some of these are still around and taller than an adult human, to give you a sense of scale. The space between these paired peaks was the border line. But the problem was that it wasn’t defined enough, and it enforced a status quo that clearly favored Sendai domain, which was six times bigger than Nanbu. Even marked, the border ran through rough terrain, and even now it’s rough terrain, so imagine how much rougher it was with Edo period technology and transport. A very lively cross-border rice smuggling trade emerged. Reportedly, rice from Sendai domain swamped the Nanbu market, and sold for double its usual asking price. In part to better control this, and in part to better mark the border, the domains added approximately 89 smaller mounds, again in pairs, to the gaps between the paired larger mounds, between 1688 and 1721.\n\nAs we’ve discussed ages ago in Friday Night History #69, Sendai domain also arranged the surveillance and defense of its northern border as much with an eye toward defense in depth as for better border control. But given that Sendai domain had the advantage of size and the smuggling was going out more than coming in, I’d question the extent and sincerity of that commitment. Indeed, peasant uprisings in neighboring Nanbu territory were as much of a concern in that planning, especially as applied to the cluster of fortresses just south of the border at Kamikuchinai, Hitokabe, Iwayadō, and Mizusawa. Sendai domain also detached foot soldiers (ashigaru) to operate under the command of local officials who managed the border; the ashigaru unit’s role was part military and part colonizing– they worked as much in security as they did local agriculture meant to benefit Sendai domain.\n\nFoxes, Folklore, and Fixing Boundaries\n\nOf course, there emerged folklore about the border in general and the main Ōshū Highway border crossing at Aisari in particular. Aisari was the northernmost point of Date territory; just north of Aisari was Hanamaki, the first major Nanbu post town astride the highway.\n\nOne story about the border’s origins had it that a white fox, a purification wand in its mouth, marked the border. This fits in with the similar stories in the area. The story of Kamiwarisaki, which is further south in Date territory and a village border rather than a domainal boundary, but similarly has divine intervention in a seemingly unresolvable human border dispute. My favorite has to be the story that the folklorist Mihara Ryokichi most notably related. Apparently the name of the border crossing at Aisari, and the border’s uneven shape which favored Sendai domain, prompted this particular manifestation of mythmaking. The story goes something like this:\n\nLords Date and Nanbu corresponded about the border dispute. While in an earlier era they might have fought over it, this was an era where all were subject to the Shogun’s peace, and so different solutions had to be sought. The two men agreed on a solution– each would ride a horse– one north from Sendai, the other south from Morioka, and wherever they met would be the border. It’s important to note here that “horse” today is written 馬, but at the time it was also written 午, which is the zodiacal sign of the horse. The thing is, 午 looks like 牛, which is another zodiacal sign, this time of the Ox. For those of you listening rather than reading, these are almost the same character, except the vertical stroke on the one for ox is slightly taller. You’d think, given the proximity of Morioka to the border region, that the advantage would seem to clearly be on Lord Nanbu’s side. But when the day came, Lord Date tore up the Oshu Highway at great speed on horseback, while Lord Nanbu showed up late and astride an ox.\n\nLord Nanbu complained, of course, that he’d been outwitted and cheated, because he’d read horse 午 as ox 牛. But Lord Date simply laughed and said “not my problem that you can’t read properly– I clearly wrote ‘horse’ and not ‘ox.'” And lo, the place of their meeting and parting (会い去る aisaru) became Aisari 相去.\n\nThese are just two of several forms that the story of the border takes. Regardless of how the story was told, the fact of the matter is, despite a porous border, a smuggling problem, and a landscape that over time was full of pairs of mounds amidst the gaps in the mountains, the border was a living, changing thing. At least, this was the case until by Meiji government fiat in 1869, that land was confiscated from Sendai domain and the border disappeared almost overnight. Today, the former Date lands that lie between the Miyagi border and the city of Hanamaki, are not part of Miyagi Prefecture but rather Iwate Prefecture– Iwate, whose capital city is the old Nanbu castle town of Morioka.\n\nSo given that that’s the case, who do you suppose would’ve had the last laugh?\n\nThe Aftermath\n\nWhether or not house Nanbu liked it, though, it was beholden to Sendai domain’s policies and dictates. We’ve discussed this on prior episodes, including some recent ones– Friday Night History #83, “The Sendai Horse Market,” mentioned this in passing. In the end, Nanbu had no choice in the fact that the road to Edo, and the Kitakami River, both ran south– bigger, longer-term forces of economy and the flow of goods obliged their cooperation. This is part of that concept of longue duree of the Annales school, which I’ve frequently invoked on this podcast– forces that are bigger and harder-hitting and longer-term than individual agency have a way of shaping history to point in a certain direction.\n\nToday, many of the mounds survive, including some in modern Kitakami, Iwate Prefecture, which are listed as a National Historic Site. They aren’t the only such border markers from the Edo period, but they’ve survived exceptionally well, which sets them apart.\n\nI wonder if there are foxes that still hang out between them.\n\nSources\n\nNyri A.

Historical figures famous in their own right, like Date Masamune, sometimes framed things in their lives by drawing parallels to the Three Kingdoms. In Masamune’s case, it was to the story of Xiahou Dun’s lost eye. In recent weeks, I was asked by a Twitch subscriber to dig in to anotehr example of a historical figure who tried to emulate ROT3K, and the name that immediately came to mind was Kondō Isami, famous as Shinsengumi commander.Decades ago, one of the first things I learned about the man was his love of ROT3K and that he read it more than once. It appears in some popular depictions, too, like the early 2000s manga Getsumei Seiki: Sayonara Shinsengumi by Morita Kenji.\n\nBut the challenge with this sort of thing for me is being constrained by geography, finances, or academic affiliation and lack thereof, with the result that I have to look in open source journals, digital archives, and whatever’s within my reach via the interlibrary loan department of Carnegie Library of Pittsburgh. And within these constraints I know where I can find confirmation specifically for Kondō’s love of ROT3K, but I can’t actually look inside the books because they haven’t been digitized or are forbidden to access for people outside Japan, or are otherwise beyond the reach even of ILL.I say all of this as preamble to the fact that I’ve necessarily had to adapt the scope of the topic this week, given the sources I do have at hand. So while I have heard that Kondō was particularly drawn to Guan Yu, we’re going to look more broadly at an episode early in Kondō’s life, and its intersection with ROT3K. I think there’s a lesson we can draw from it that goes beyond ROT3K.\n\nThe Peach Orchard Oath\n\nAn early, memorable scene in Romance of the Three Kingdoms is the Peach Orchard Oath, wherein Liu Bei, Zhang Fei, and Guan Yu swore an oath of brotherhood. My translation of the oath is as follows.\n\n“Though we, Liu Bei, Guan Yu, and Zhang Fei have different names, today we swear an oath of brotherhood. Therefore we pledge cooperation and accord, assistance in times of danger and distress, to revere the nation above and comfort the masses below. We do not seek birth on the same day, month, and year, but only ask to die on the same day, month, and year. May the gods bear witness to what is in our hearts. If any of us betrays justice and forgets this favor, may heaven and the people strike us down.”\n\nThe three men, having become brothers, went on to do the great things which form the crux of the novel. The oath’s phrasing influenced the phrasing of other oaths and texts in Asian history, including the treaty that established the Northern Alliance of 1868. And it was likewise influential on three wealthy peasants that we’re going to talk about now, who swore a similar oath of brotherhood in the late Edo period. The fact that they did has some things to say about how the Edo period caste system blurred around the edges, and indeed had started to erode altogether.\n\nSworn Brothers and Self Made Men\n\nThe three men were Kojima Shikanosuke, Kondō Isami, and Satō Hikogorō, all of them sons of the farming community in the rural Tama County of Musashi Province, in what is now part of Tokyo metropolis. The peasant caste in this part of Japan were in the heartland of Shogunate controlled territory, and in that area in particular they had a long history of blurring the boundaries between castes. The usual wisdom has it that the caste system in the Edo period was rigid, but it always blurred around the boundaries. One of the local Tokugawa Shogunate units in the area was the Hachiōji Sennin-dōshin, shogunal retainers who ensured the area’s safety but were also part farmer, having begun as ex-Takeda retainers who sought refuge by appealing for hire by the Tokugawa clan. And by the late Edo, if a peasant had enough money, they could buy the right to wear swords and have the trappings of samurai status, and in some cases, even become retainers of the Shogunate or a domain.\n\nEven with just this much about the trio so far, we can already spot a pretty big sign of this: all 3 men began life as peasants, but had family names, which most peasants in Japan did not have.\n\nKojima Shikanosuke, four years Kondō’s senior, had the background in Chinese studies. He was born in Onoji Village in 1830, the eldest son of Kojima Kakuzaemon, the headman (nanushi) of Onoji. He entered the sword tutelage of Kondō Shūsuke in 1848 and became one of the leading pupils of the Tennen Rishin ryū, the Kondō sword school. The Kojima family’s garden in Onoji was frequently the site of the Kondō school’s outdoor training. Kojima was a man of book learning too, and had been a student of Tōyama Unjo and Kikuchi Kikujō, noted Neoconfucian scholars of the time. Kikuchi in particular was a scholar with outsized influence through countless pupils. Rather surprising to me was that Meiji era industrialist Shibusawa Eiichi was one of his more famous students. Kikuchi and Tōyama offered lectures at the Kojima home, and Kondō Isami, Shūsuke’s adopted heir, was thus steeped in those values. He also had the run of the Kojima house library, which reportedly contained thousands of volumes including the ROT3K.\n\nSatō Hikogorō, born in 1827, was another senior Kondō student in the same years. He was the eldest son of Satō Hikoemon, headman of Tama, a post town on the Kōshu Highway. In the 1860s, he was rather significantly involved in handling the Kondō school’s affairs while its headmaster was, at the risk of a gross understatement, away on business in the Kansai region. He was a poet of some renown, as well as a sometime leader of peasant militia on the eve of the Boshin War.\n\nAnd finally, Kondō Isami is a man who I’m tempted to say needs no introduction, but for those who don’t know: Kondō Isami was born in 1834 in Kamiishihara, in the Tama County, to the farmer Miyagawa Hisajirō. Kondō Shūsuke adopted him as heir to the Tennen Rishin ryū in 1849. He’s famous for later becoming commander of the Tokugawa Shogunate’s Shinsengumi paramilitary organization, and in that role he rose to fame and infamy, Shogunate retainer status, and near the end of his life, almost became a daimyo. There’s a lot that we can say about Kondō, and I don’t want to get lost in the sauce, because just by dint of what he did with his career, he seems to always prompt a combination of admiration and loathing, which makes it all the more important to be as rigorous as we can when discussing him in a context of history rather than fiction. But the point is, from those relatively humble roots, Kondō rose to very high status.\n\nWhile Kondō did not survive the Boshin War, Satō and Kojima did, eventually becoming involved with the early Meiji era Freedom and Popular Rights Movement, which we’ve mentioned on the podcast before and which was a movement to which many who lost in the Boshin War turned as a means of pushing back against the empire. In their own way, they too rose pretty far. But they rose together by choice, all three of them, for despite having begun as neighbors in the same farming community which blurred the lines of the late Edo caste system, they swore an oath of brotherhood in the style of ROT3K.\n\nA bold choice for three farm boys from Tama County. They could not have known what the future held for them, of course. But they knew what swearing an oath of that sort meant and how grave it was.\n\nKeeping the Oath\n\nDespite fundraising and recruiting for Shinsengumi and affiliated units, Satō and Kojima managed to avoid getting in trouble with the imperial government, and remained important in their community for the rest of their lives. They also devoted themselves to the reclaiming of Kondō’s good name. Many years after the war, they were involved in memorializing Kondō and his second in command Hijikata Toshizō at Takahata Fudōson, a Buddhist temple in Hino. This was in the 1880s, in a time when any memorial of the man was still a risk, and histories that challenged the Meiji government’s orthodoxy usually got the author imprisoned. Today, the memorial– which now includes an impressive sculpture of Hijikata– remains an important part of the temple and one that is popular with tourists even from beyond Japan.\n\nBut it began with a brave act by Satō and Kojima.\n\nThe men had sworn an oath, as had the three heroes of the Three Kingdoms– and sure enough, they kept their word.\n\nSources\n\n“Dai 114kai: Shibusawa Eiichi ni mo Oshieta Jugakusha Kikuchi Kikujō.” Kuki City. 1 April 2024.\n\nKikuchi Akira.

This continued through primogeniture– that is, inheritance via eldest son, by birth or by adoption. This wasn’t always the case in a prior shogunate. Minamoto no Yoritomo may have founded the Kamakura Shogunate, but his male-line successors as shogun lasted only two further generations before being replaced by a succession of imperial princes who held the shogunal title and were controlled by the Hōjō regents and their councils. Ieyasu wanted to take lessons from the Kamakura and Muromachi Bakufu at their best, and correct for their shortcomings wherever he could.\n\nSo what do you do when there are no heirs by birth? You turn to the 6 major branches of the Tokugawa tree. We’re looking at them as six, but there were over the Edo period other Tokugawa branch families set up as daimyo whose lines later died out. Not only that, but in the case of the Three Lords, who we’re going to talk about a bit later, two were set up first, with the third following later. But in the interest of ease of introduction, we’re just looking at them in their final form as six. So here we go.\n\nThe Three Houses\n\nThe senior three of the Tokugawa branches eligible for adoption by the shogun were the houses of Kii, Owari, and Mito. Kii and Owari were also known by their castle towns’ names as Wakayama and Nagoya domain, respectively.\n\nEach of these domains was founded by one of Tokugawa Ieyasu’s sons. All of them were thus suitably given very large domains, with yearly tax income assessed in the hundreds of thousands of koku. They were also strategically located– Kii overlooked the seaways into Osaka from the east, Owari controlled the crossroads of the Tokaido at the entrance to the Kansai region, and Mito sat east of Edo overlooking the roads that ran south from the Tohoku region, and defended against the possible threat of Sendai domain. Collectively, these three daimyo of Kii, Owari, and Mito were called the Gosanke, the Three Houses. And sure enough, two of the three were eventually called upon to furnish heirs to a childless shogun. Kii did so in 1716 and 1858, Mito in 1866, although Mito’s also counts as one of the Three Lords, who we’ll get into later. The daimyo of the Three Houses enjoyed precedence at the Shogun’s court in Edo and were influential in the making of Shogunate policy. But they were also their own daimyo, with all the semi independent prerogative with which that came: a castle, a relatively easily defensible and mostly contiguous domains, and vassals who answered to them and not directly to the Shogunate. And indeed, in the end, none of the gosanke stood with the Shogunate in the Boshin War, with Owari and Kii siding with Sat-cho almost from the beginning, and Mito too mired in its own civil war to be meaningfully engaged. As Harold Bolitho observed regarding the fudai daimyo in the same period, the Three Houses’ independence all but sealed their prioritizing their own interests over loyalty to the Shogunate.\n\nOwari and Kii enjoyed higher status at court than did the daimyo of Mito; however, the daimyo of Mito was excused from alternate attendance duty and could reside in Edo for years at a time in what Conrad Totman calls “an advisory role” to the ruling shogun. Partly because of this, the Mito daimyo was popularly called the vice shogun (fukushogun), even if that wasn’t an official title.\n\nEach of these domains had branches of their own. However, those branch domains’ lords did not use the Tokugawa family name, with the incumbent being known instead as Matsudaira so-and-so, Matsudaira being the Tokugawa family’s prior name. Even in the households of the Three Houses, only the incumbent daimyo used the Tokugawa name, with everyone else being called Matsudaira. There was likewise a taboo on using the three-leaved asarum caulescens Tokugawa crest for regular wear; you see this in surviving photos of the members of these families, who more often wear a variant form of the Tokugawa crest featuring six leaves pointing outward rather than three pointing inward. I will admit I’m not entirely sure about the specifics of this, but it seems that it was a custom beyond just house Tokugawa– I’ve seen it with photos of the Date clan, too.\n\nBut the Gosanke were not the only ones who were spares for the shogunal line. And for that, we need to turn to a discussion of the Gosankyō.\n\nThe Three Lords\n\nThe lesser of the major six Tokugawa branches were the Tayasu, Shimizu, and Hitotsubashi houses. The Tayasu and Hitotsubashi lines were first, at which time they were collectively called the Goryōkō (Two Lords), which grew to the Three Lords with the addition of the Shimizu-Tokugawa in 1758.\n\nThey furnished replacement heirs to the Tokugawa line twice; once in 1866 with the accession to shogun of Tokugawa Yoshinobu, a Mito adoptee into the Hitotsubashi line, and once in 1868 with Tokugawa Iesato of the Tayasu line’s designation as successor to Yoshinobu. I call the Three Lords the “lesser” of the six because they enjoyed prestige at the shogun’s court but were not daimyo per se, though they enjoyed the income of a middling daimyo with 100,000 koku. Or as Conrad Totman put it in Politics in the Tokugawa Bakufu:\n\nTheir domains, with a putative yield of 1000,000 koku apiece, consisted of parcels taken from the [Tokugawa] house land and assigned to the Three Lords. The men who collected the taxes and administered the areas were designated their vassals. In their mansions they had attendants, house officials, and a modest complement of guards, all considered their direct vassals. And they had house codes and regulations based on the laws governing the military houses (buke shohatto) and other bakufu documents.\n\nThese three houses thus had most of the trappings of regular daimyo except for a castle on their lands and a seat in the honorary chambers at Edo.\n\nBut despite these nominal similarities to daimyo, the Three Lords were different from other daimyo and easier for the Shogunate to control. This was partly because of their lack of castle, independent retainer band, and contiguous land, but also because the Three Lords didn’t get to pass family headship to their firstborn sons as any other daimyo or hatamoto did. The Three Lords’ sons were not just destined to be spares for the Shogunal line, but also as alternative heirs for other Tokugawa cousins who might have been childless and in need to ensure the continuity of their family lines. Matsudaira Sadanobu, famed late-18th century shogunate senior councilor, was one case of this, born into the Tayasu Tokugawa family.\n\nThis lack of automatic primogeniture, and the continuing possibility that their income and status could be taken away by the Shogunate at the stroke of a brush, meant that they were easier to control. But this system also included clear procedure for furnishing the Three Lords with heirs, and with only 3 brief interruptions, all three lines continued through 1868.\n\nToday, their names survive as toponyms around what today is the Tokyo Imperial Palace.\n\nPop Culture\n\nThe Three Houses have enjoyed some attention in popular culture, especially over the past 50 years.\n\nMito in particular casts a long shadow because of pop culture, thanks to the Mito Kōmon TV series. This follows the travels of the 2nd generation Mito lord Tokugawa Mitsukuni, traveling incognito after his retirement with two loyal retainers and fighting injustice across Japan. There are callbacks to it in many other shows and films, animated and live action, usually by referencing the climactic scene in every episode where one of Mitsukuni’s men says “fool! do you not know who stands before you?!” and reveals the Tokugawa crest emblazoned on an inro, which is a kind of small, lacquered medicine case.\n\nKii, meanwhile, has had its share of the limelight, thanks to the TV series Abarenbō Shogun. This long running series follows a similar formula to Mito Kōmon, wherein reform minded 8th shogun and ex-Kii daimyo Tokugawa Yoshimune secretly slips out of Edo Castle and fights injustice and the malfeisance of low and mid-level Shogunate bureaucrats on behalf of the people of Edo. Actor Matsudaira Ken played Yoshimune across the monumental run of 831 episodes from 1978 to 2008, and it made his career– it was also one of the first Japanese period dramas I watched, in the late 1990s.\n\nIt’s also significantly Abarenbo Shogun that has ensured a negative image of Owari, as the Owari daimyo Muneharu was portrayed as a primary antagonist in Abarenbo Shogun, opposite Yoshimune. The real Muneharu was an ideological opponent of Yoshimune’s commitment to extreme frugality, but was not quite the cartoonish villain that the show presents.\n\nAn Unlikely Epilogue\n\nBut there’s a curious epilogue to this tale of heirs and spares.\n\nTokugawa Yoshitoshi was the late Meiji heir to the Shimizu Tokugawa line. He was a baron in the Meiji peerage, and an officer in the imperial army, in which he rose to the rank of lieutenant general. But it was in 1910 that he made a different sort of name for himself, for having earned a license in France, he performed Japan’s first heavier than air flight in 1910.\n\nSources\n\nHata Ikuhiko.

It was also where Japan reached out to the rest of the world. This was especially the case when it came to Qing dynasty China. Merchants based in Nagasaki handled exports on behalf of domains that had things to send out to the wider world. There may have been only one Dutch ship a year allowed, but many more Chinese ships were allowed. It was a very lucrative trade.\n\nWhich brings us to Aizu domain and ginseng. Ginseng is a root vegetable common in East Asian cuisine as well as an important ingredient in traditional Chinese medicine. Aizu domain, a mountainous, landlocked domain in the Tohoku region, was a ginseng growing region in the Edo period. Even today, the Aizu district remains one of very few ginseng growing regions in Japan.\n\nHandling ginseng exports to Qing dynasty China was Nagasaki merchant Adachi Jinjūrō. Originally from Tajima Province, he moved to Nagasaki and went into the ginseng export business. And it was there that he became the official ginseng exporter for Aizu domain from 1830 to 1866.\n\nGinseng was a cash crop. Taxes got mostly paid in rice, but of course, you can’t live on rice alone, and aside from the other staples, there were cash crops that varied from domain to domain and region to region. In Aizu, the cultivation of ginseng would prove to be a lifesaver.\n\nSaving Strained Finances\n\nAizu domain had always been in a position of high honor in the Shogunal administration, but also great material demand. The Shogunate placed Aizu domain where it did, under a daimyo who was the Shogun’s relative, in order to keep an eye on potentially hostile rivals, most notably house Date of Sendai. In the 19th century the Shogunate routinely called on Aizu to join coast defense missions in the face of increasing foreign incurions off Japanese waters. We’ve covered a bunch of these incidents on the podcast before, but to sum up, the growth of the Pacific whaling trade,\n\nand the expansion of steam power, along with the eastward expansion of the Russian empire, meant that a whole lot of foreign vessels were straying into Japanese waters and an increasing number of shipwrecked sailors actually coming ashore. The Shogunate assigned Aizu domain, Sendai domain, and other major Tohoku domains to coast defense duty in response. But the thing about these missions is that they were expensive, as such missions are even today. The Shogunate made it a matter of standing policy to drain domains’ finances via the alternate attendance system to forestall revolt, so this was expense on top of expense. Consider also that this was squarely in the era when the Tenmei and Tenpo Famines were badly impacting domains’ incomes, especially in the Tohoku region.\n\nWhen the Shogunate issued an order it was very hard to get out of obeying it no matter what the financial burden, and for the Matsudaira family of Aizu domain, even moreso. The legal code that was the basis for its entire ethos obliged it. So the domain went, to Hokkaido and to the Boso Peninsula, and nearly bankrupted itself in the process.\n\nGinseng saved it, but the ginseng itself goes back further than this. It was third generation Aizu lord Matsudaira Masakata who first petitioned the Shogunate for a grant of ginseng seeds, which he had planted in the Oyakuen, an herb garden in Aizu that still exists today. But it wasn’t until 1803 and the tenure of reformist Aizu domain elder Tanaka Harunaka (1747-1808) that the ginseng cultivation was seriously expanded and turned into an industry. It was one of a package of measures Tanaka promoted to turn the domain’s finances around, along with cotton, safflower, and increases in sericulture and sake production. Tanaka died in 1808, but the industries he set up would sustain the domain through the hard times of the Tenpo famine and the ensuing Bakumatsu period.\n\nEnter Adachi Jinjūrō, circa 1830. The domain contracted him to handle ginseng exports to China, in the interest of improving the domain’s finances. There followed 36 years of record profits for both Adachi and Aizu domain, and the introduction to Aizu of other things from Nagasaki. Once every two years, Adachi would trek out to Aizu to meet with domain officials. This is also when Adachi brought goods from Nagasaki that would have been of interest to Aizu men as novelties or curiosities. One rather notable one whose current ubiquity we may take for granted was kasutera cake. Another was a kind of Nagasaki kite called a Tōjindako– a Chinese kite.\n\nBut this isn’t all that Adachi’s management of the Aizu ginseng trade made possible.\n\nGinseng to guns\n\nFor his service to the domain, Adachi was given bushi status, the position of junior councilor (wakadoshiyori) in the administration, and a stipend of 500 koku. As a now senior Aizu retainer, he was called Adachi Kenmotsu.\n\nAnd the lucrative ginseng trade didn’t just save the domain’s finances and personally enrich and elevate Adachi. It also made its breakneck military modernization possible. Aizu’s 1868 arms dealers the Schnell brothers are famous, but these earlier Prussians, Carl Lehmann and Oskar Hartmann, were first. Aizu retainers Yamamoto Kakuma and Nakazawa Tatewaki contracted with them to import guns. It was Adachi Jinjūrō that connected Yamamoto and Nakazawa with Lehmann and company, through whom Aizu domain ordered 4300 breech-loading Snider-Enfield rifles, of which Aizu was to acquire 1300 and Kii domain, a major domain in central Japan that was nominally allied with Aizu, received 3000. This was a significant investment made at a time when domains across Japan were rapidly modernizing their fighting forces in whole or in part. Aizu, as with the rest of the northern domains, was far from Nagasaki and the usual port of entry for imports like guns, but having that Nagasaki based official made the process more convenient for the domain. It was also necessary because Aizu was actively engaged in the urban warfare that characterized life in and around Kyoto in the 1860s.\n\nHowever, the coming of the Boshin War meant that the new Satsuma-Chōshū led imperial government confiscated that year’s ginseng export. While the Sniders indeed arrived, Saga domain intercepted them, and they never reached the hands of the Aizu troops who needed them the most. The bill went unpaid by Aizu domain, understandably, and some years later the Lehmann-Hartmann Company sued the now defunct Aizu domain for unpaid bills, and the records are now digitized and in the JACAR (Japan Center for Asian Historial Records) operated by the National Diet Library, where you can read them today.\n\nBut that wasn’t the end of Aizu or Adachi Jinjūrō.\n\nThe Bloodsucking Carpet\n\nAdachi Jinjūrō performed one last act of service to Aizu domain before its end. When Aizu-Wakamatsu Castle fell, retired daimyo Matsudaira Katamori came out of the castle to surrender to the imperial forces in a short ceremony outside the castle gate.\n\nAkizuki Teijirō, an Aizu domain liaison officer later known for having worked alongside Lafcadio Hearn, who called him a man who was like a god, penned a poem that I think sums up that day well.\n\nThe way of loyalty and filial piety is on the wane\n\nWhat have I done for these forty-odd years?\n\nAlone I lament, and having had no chance to test this precious sword\n\nI plant the flag of surrender outside Wakamatsu Castle’s gate.\n\n至 今 忠 孝 道 方 虧\n\n四 十 余 年 何 所 為\n\n独 恨 宝 刀 未 全 試\n\n松 城 門 外 植 降 旗\n\nThe surrender ceremony, happening as it was outside a castle that had been under siege for a month, took place on a large red carpet in order to provide some semblance of ceremony. As it was associated wth the end of a bloody siege, Aizu people remember it to this day as the kyūketsusen, the blood-sucking carpet.\n\nThe carpet, on which Aizu was finally spared further bloodshed, was acquired thanks to Adachi.\n\nRetirement\n\nUnlike many Aizu leaders, Adachi was neither imprisoned nor executed upon the Boshin War’s end. He later returned to his hometown in Tajima and continued his involvement with ginseng cultivation and trade. But while he was still in Nagasaki in the early Meiji era, he was involved in the early education of young Aizu warrior Kusaka Yoshio, who went on to become governor of Nagasaki and then governor of his native Fukushima Prefecture.\n\nAnd today, there are three primary ginseng growing regions in Japan: Nagasaki, Hyogo– which used to be Tajima Province– and Aizu.\n\nSources\n\n“Topikku Tenji: Bakumatsu Nagasaki to Aizuhan Kyushu to Tohoku o Tsunagu Kataki Kizuna.” Nagasaki Museum of History and Culture, Press Release News No. 7, 2 May 2013.

Yokoo Tōsaku was born there in 1839, the son of a doctor, and he seems to have shown great promise as a scholar from a young age. Studying first at the Yōkendō Academy in Sendai, then in Edo at the shogunate’s Shoheizaka Academy, Yokoo followed the path of many of his contemporaries in the warrior caste who pursued advanced education. Going to the Shoheizaka Academy was the equivalent of going to graduate school, so it’s not that unusual a thing to have done.\n\nWhat I think is more unusual and interesting is that he went on to study English, and develop a keen awareness of the world beyond Japan.\n\nA Well-Connected English Language Education\n\nSendai domain Edo-based liaison officer and Commissioner of Finance Ōwara Shindayu recommended Yokoo for further study, first with Fukuzawa Yukichi at the Keiō Gijuku (today’s Keiō University) and then with missionary Samuel Robbins Brown. Ōwara was one of the forward thinking Sendai domain leaders responsible for the education of people who went on to prominence in both the domain as well as Meiji Japan. Yokoo was one. Another, far more famous, was Takahashi Korekiyo, later Prime Minister and Finance Minister. Takahashi studied with James Curtis Hepburn. You might not be familiar with Hepburn’s name, but if you’ve seen how I render Japanese words in the Latin alphabet in blogposts, you’ve seen a modified version of the romanization system that Hepburn invented. Takahashi, Yokoo, and other Sendai warriors of their time joined the ranks of Japanese people with English language skill, a population that was rapidly growing since the Phaeton Incident forced the Tokugawa Shogunate to rapidly bootstrap its capability in the English language.\n\nIncidentally, one of Yokoo’s classmates in Brown’s tutelage was a Matsuyama retainer named Oshikawa Masayoshi. Oshikawa, together with William F. Hoy, founded Tohoku Gakuin University, one of Sendai’s preeminent institutions of higher learning which I am proud to call an alma mater.\n\nBut that’s a story for another time.\n\nTohoku Makes a Case to the World\n\nBecause of Yokoo’s skill in English, Sendai domain orders came down placing him as an English language instructor at Yōkendō Academy. But then the war came, and Sendai domain rallied the Northern Alliance in its fight against the Sat-cho dominated imperial forces. And far from a reactionary conservative last stand of the old order, the Alliance had a foreign policy agenda, which it hoped to pursue by way of presenting its case to the foreign diplomatic corps in Japan, first in the newly opened port of Niigata and then after a secret trip aboard the British merchant vessel Albion, in Yokohama. Yokoo headed the delegation that argued the Alliance’s case before the representatives of 11 countries. He did not succeed; however, he made enough of an impression locally that word got out that he was in greater Edo, and the imperial government put a price on his head, dead or alive. They did not manage to capture him before the war’s end. Yokoo escaped safely aboard one of Enomoto Takeaki’s ships and made it back to Sendai Domain via Sabusawa Island.\n\nAfter the war, he was again involved in English language education in Sendai, teaching at the Shinbikan, one of the domain’s post-Boshin War schools which went on to be a predecessor of Miyagi Prefectural Sendai Daiichi High School. But a new career soon took Yokoo to greater Tokyo, where he served in a variety of government positions in Kanagawa Prefecture and Tokyo proper, including the Tokyo Metropolitan Police Department. However, Yokoo was also one of many vocal proponents of something called Nanshinron.\n\nEmpire and Expansionism\n\nNanshinron was a doctrine in the empire that advocated for its attention toward and expansion south and east into the islands of the Pacific. Yokoo himself is on record as having argued for Japanese settlement on the Philippine islands of Palawan, Sulu, and Mindanao. And in 1887, Yokoo petitioned Enomoto Takeaki– now Minister of Communications and Transportation– who allowed Yokoo to take a survey trip aboard the Glasgow-built lighthouse ship and later imperial yacht Meiji maru. The voyage surveyed the islands that comprise the Kazan-retto, the Volcano Islands, including one with curious black sand and a mountain on one corner. This trip became the impetus for Japan’s formal annexation of the islands a few years later. They were settled by people from the Izu Islands, which lie some distance to the north, between the Volcano Islands and Honshu itself. A few decades later they played a strategic role in the later stages of the Pacific War, when the allied forces fought to take them over and use them as forward bases in the campaign against the home islands of Japan, in 1945. Some of the most iconic photos of the Pacific War, arguably of the 20th Century as a whole, were taken on those islands that Yokoo surveyed.\n\nYokoo remained a proponent of Nanshinron for the rest of his life. He died suddenly in 1903, while visiting Tomita Tetsunosuke, a friend and fellow ex-Date retainer– a colleague of Takahashi, who we mentioned earlier– who’d risen to serve variously as governor of Tokyo and governor of the Bank of Japan. The Volcano Islands, meanwhile, remain a part of Japan, despite having been b"
