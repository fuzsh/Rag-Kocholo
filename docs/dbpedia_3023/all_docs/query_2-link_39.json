As soon as I saw it was a hot springs ep i immediately thought oh goodness, here comes a lousy episode with nothing but fan service. But I was pleasantly surprised. I liked the art style, there was fan service, but nothing gratuitous, and the story line kept me hooked. If you only watch one ep of Blue seed 2, make it ep 3. Eps 1 and 2 were just ok in my opinion. I could easily take or leave them. As a fan of the main series I ... don't think they added anything of note to my Blue seed experience .\n\nReviewer’s Rating: 7\n\nWhat did you think of this review?\n\nNice 0\n\nLove it 0\n\nFunny 0\n\nConfusing 0\n\nInformative 0\n\nWell-written 0\n\nCreative 0\n\nShow all\n\nI’m not going to lie, what the hell happen? I loved the first series and all the fun Omakes that were in it. And then this one came out. It changed the story around badly. The ending of the first one was perfect and really didn’t leave any room for a second series to be made unless they wanted the bad guy from the first one to come back angry again but this one has a bad guy and in America no less. Basicly the whole secret organization that was in the first was picked up and brought to America and I’m pretty sure the ... American government would have never said alright to this! There is a lot less action and a lot more fucken drama between Momiji and Kusanagi which really makes me feel stupid for even picking this up and thinking it would be good. It’s one of those things that I want to be in my own little world and say that there was no season 2 and there is no way they could make a season 2 but here it is in my face. (God I hate reality sometimes.)\n\nThe animation is more shotty then Gonzo, which says a hell of a lot in my book. Character designs have been changed for the worse, what action there is (And that is not much) is speed lines, hold posses, and even just cut away’s where they cut to someone talking and then back to the now killed creature.*Face…. Palm*\n\nVoices are ok, close to the original if not the same characters but I really couldn’t pay much attention to that as the whole thing was really making me feel sick for even watching this.\n\nReviewer’s Rating: 2\n\nWhat did you think of this review?\n\nNice 0\n\nLove it 0\n\nFunny 0\n\nConfusing 0\n\nInformative 0\n\nWell-written 0\n\nCreative 0\n\nShow all\n\nInterest Stacks\n\nRecommendations\n\nRecent News\n\nNorth American Anime & Manga Releases for December\n\nHere are the North American anime & manga releases for December Week 1: December 4 - 10 Anime Releases Akame ga Kill!
