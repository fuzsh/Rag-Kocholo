        "text": "Book One\n\nSummary\n\nBook one covers fourteen years in the author’s married life, from the year 954 to the year 968. The author, Michitsuna’s Mother, is a woman of the middle-ranking aristocracy. She is about nineteen when the proposal for marriage comes from Fujiwara Kaneie, one of her kinsmen from a distant and more powerful branch of the family. It is assumed the author began writing the diary around 971, many years after the events recorded in book one. The first indication that the diary was actually begun later is in the introductory paragraph, where she states that the events of years past are vague in her memory.\n\nShe starts the diary in the third person, giving it the feel of a fictional piece of writing. However, within one long sentence she moves to declare her purpose to write a sort of antiromance, the record of a real person’s life, her own. The reader will see her struggle through book one as she alternately recaptures the moments in her marriage that accorded with the romantic ideal and laments the points at which the relationship fell short.\n\nRunning through the narration is her record of correspondence and the exchange of poetry that was an integral part of communication in the period. In fact, in many respects, book one is more like an anthology of poetry than a diary, at least in conventional Western terms. Her style of narration is elliptical and fragmentary. She is not interested in filling out the picture so that we get a clear sense of who all the actors are and what the chronology is. Her focus is rather on heightened moments of sensibility, which usually involve the composition of poetry.\n\nthere is one - She begins speaking of herself in the third person, which gives the beginning of her diary the feel of a monogatari, “tale.”\n\nold tales - Romantic tales perhaps like the Tale of Lady Ochikubō, a Cinderella story where a mistreated stepdaughter is rescued from her cruel situation by a handsome, high-ranking man.\n\nplaces where I have just left it at that are indeed many - This phrase is vague in the original and has been subject to many varied interpretations ranging from “There are many things I have written that were best left unwritten” to “There are many descriptions where I’ve thought this will do.” I have left it vague. A possible interpretation of “at that\" is “as vague and fragmented as my memory.”\n\n“a tall tree among oak trees” - Conventional metaphorical expression for the position of captain of the Right Guards, which her husband-to-be, Kaneie, is known to have held at that time. From this, we also know the year is 954. He is twenty-six; she is about nineteen.\n\nAn ordinary person would have sent - Given that women (other than those serving at court) were hidden away behind ranks of relatives and servants and layers of walls and curtains (even their layers and layers of clothing seem emblematic of the barriers to intimacy), a Heian man wishing to initiate a relationship could either approach the woman through her male protectors, fathers, and brothers, as Kaneie does in this case, or try to reach her secretly through her personal female attendants and set up direct correspondence. Michitsuna’s Mother, it seems, would have preferred the latter, which would have accorded more with the progress of a love affair in a romance.\n\nmy father- She uses an indirect expression, “the one who is recognized as my parent.” She does this with all terms of family relation, but they are rendered more directly in this translation. Her father is of the Fujiwara clan too, a distant cousin to Kaneie. Her father’s branch of the family had been relegated to the sidelines of the political world.\n\nsuch a letter- A letter of proposal. An alternate interpretation of this passage is that she is surprised to see such bad handwriting because she had heard he had a fine hand, but then the mention of paper does not quite fit. It seems more likely that she is disappointed by the casualness in choice of paper and hand, that it does not seem like a serious letter of proposal. Again her expectations in this regard would have been shaped by romantic tales.\n\ncuckoo bird—From this we know that the season of their first correspondence is early summer.\n\nThus the time has passed and there is one in the world who has lived such a vain existence, catching on to neither this nor that. As for her appearance, she can hardly be compared to others, and her intelligence—to say she has some is as good as saying she has none at all—so it is only natural that she has come to such a useless state she thinks again and again; it is just that in the course of living, lying down, getting up, dawn to dusk, when she looks at the odds and ends of the old tales—of which there are so many, they are just so much fantasy—that she thinks perhaps if she were to make a record of a life like her own, being really nobody, it might actually be novel, and could even serve to answer, should anyone ask, what is it like, the life of a woman married to a highly placed man, yet the events of the months and years gone by are vague; places where I have just left it at that are indeed many.\n\nWell then, for this ultimately disappointing affair, there was, of course, the exchange of love letters; from about the time that he became “a tall tree among oak trees,” it seems that he made his intentions known. An ordinary person would have sent a discreet letter using a serving maid or someone like that as a go-between to make his feelings known, but this man goes right to my father, half-joking, half-serious, hinting at the idea, and even though I told my father that it did not suit me at all, just as if he did not know, one day he sends a retainer riding on a horse to pound on our gate. Who was bringing whose messages, we had not a hint, so there is a big commotion, we were quite perplexed, and accepting the message brings on another commotion. When I look at it, the paper and so on are not what you would expect in such a letter; I had heard from of old that in such a case the hand would be perfect, but the writing in this is so bad that I feel it couldn’t be that sort of letter; it is so very strange. The words were:\n\nmy old mother - She says “person of the older generation,” but “mother” is the generally agreed upon interpretation.\n\nI have someone write—Revealing her own hand would be the first step to intimacy, so, adopting a posture of resistance, she delays his seeing her handwriting. Since it is not written in her own hand, he will even be uncertain as to whether it is her composition or not. Of course, the posture of resistance is conventionally required.\n\nflutter a voice - Pun on two meanings of the same word furu, one meaning “to brandish, wave in front of one,” and the other, “to be shaky, have a quavering sound.”\n\nsoundless waterfall - There is an actual waterfall of this name in the Ohara district of Kyoto.\n\ntracks … letters in the sand - This poem puns on the word fumi, which means both “footsteps, tracks of animals or birds” and “writing” in the sense of “letters, books, and writing in general.” It is a pun that occurs often in Heian poetry. There is also a pun here on naki, “not there,” which is embedded in the word nagi-sa, “shore.” Orthographically, naki and nagi were not distinguished in the Heian period.\n\nwave - Metaphor for someone interfering with their correspondence, perhaps another suitor, which derives from the well-known and often quoted Kokinshū poem, no. 1093:\n\nif ever I should\n\nchange my mind and banish you\n\nfrom my heart then would\n\ngreat ocean waves rise and cross\n\nSuenomatsu Mountain\n\n(Laurel Rasplica Rodd, Kokinshū: A Collection of Poems Ancient and Modern [Princeton: Princeton University Press, 1984], 372)\n\nIt is impossible that the waves could rise and cross the mountain, so the Kokinshū poem is like the pledge, “my heart will never change toward you.” Here the allusion implies that her heart may no longer be true. The majority of allusions throughout this text are to the Kokinshū, the first anthology of Japanese poetry compiled by imperial command. It was completed in 905, and by the time of this diary had become the model text for the composition of Japanese verse, which is why it is alluded to so often. The poem numbers given make it possible to find the poem in any edition of the Kokinshū, whether in Japanese or English translation. As above, I will generally use L. R. Rodd’s translations, but where the translations are not noted as Rodd’s, they are my own.\n\nserious response— The word “serious,” mame, means “with serious intent.” In other words, this is a correspondence leading to marriage.\n\nand that was all. When we all discuss it, “How about it? Does it require a reply?” my old mother says, “It does.” So feeling obliged, I have someone write:\n\nWith that as a beginning, there were missives one after another, but as I did not reply, there came this:\n\nWhen I send back, “I will answer soon,” he sends this so quickly that I wonder if he was in his right mind:\n\nWhen this arrived, my mother said, “How awful, hadn’t you better be a bit more mature about this and send him a reply.” So, I had a suitable person write a suitable reply. Even with that, he was genuinely happy and corresponded abundantly.\n\nAnother time, this was attached to a letter:\n\nThat time too, using a person who could write a properly serious response, I deceived him. There was another letter. “While I am glad to have your seemingly serious response, if this time again there is nothing from you yourself, how painful it will be,” and so on. Written in the margin of this grave epistle:\n\nno cries of deer… - Allusion to Kokinshū no. 214:\n\nhere in this mountain\n\nvillage autumn brings special\n\nmisery all through\n\nthe night the sound of the\n\nbelling deer awakens me\n\n(Rodd, Kokinshū, 109)\n\neyelids meet not and see…-Pun on ahanu me, “not meeting eyes,” in other words, eyes that do not join lids in sleep, and me in the sense of “occasion,” “the occasion of not meeting.”\n\nto which I reply—This is the first time she has replied directly, presumably in her own hand.\n\nTakasago - Place-name that is a pillow word (fixed associated word) for deer.\n\nMeeting Slope—Border point between Kyoto and the Lake Biwa region. The name Meeting Slope makes it a popular pillow word for meeting.\n\nNakoso—Place-name that conveniently means “come not this way.”\n\nwhat kind of morning - With this indirect phrase she indicates that this is the morning after they have first slept together. It is the content of his poem that answers her rhetorical question. He is no longer pleading for admittance to her presence; now he is smitten and cannot wait to see her again.\n\nWaiting the while … - Contains puns: yufugure-kure, “evening\"/“rafts,” nagare-nakare, “flow\"/ “cry,” ohowi, “Ōi (river name)”/“many.”\n\nEven though he said this, I continued to deceive him as before. With our corresponding in this serious fashion, the days and the months passed.\n\nAutumn has arrived. In another letter he writes, “How painful it is to me that you seem to regard me with such prudence; I have borne it till now, but how can we go on like this?”\n\nto which I reply:\n\n“How truly strange it is.”\n\nAfter awhile, again from him:\n\nIn return:\n\nand so on, these serious missives went back and forth until—what kind of morning was it?\n\nBrooding on many … – Her poem echoes the puns of his poem. The posture of resistance has yielded to one of uncertainty and reflection.\n\nthird morning – From this we know that the marriage has formally begun. As is the normal custom of the time, it will be a visiting marriage; she will not expect him to move in with her nor will she expect to move to his residence (see introduction, pp. 9–11).\n\nhe visits me there – That he seeks her out to visit even when she is away from home is indicative of the strength of his affection.\n\npink – This is the nadeshiko, “wild pink,” a type of carnation associated with autumn. Characters used to write the name phonetically also mean the “caressed child,” so the flower name also puns for “beloved girl” and the like.\n\nas much as two nights in a row – That she finds it remarkable that he stays away for two nights in a row indicates indirectly the height of his ardor during this early period of marriage.\n\nMy reply:\n\nThen again, on about the third morning:\n\nMy reply:\n\nThings went on like this, then for one reason or another, as it comes about that I should be away from home for a while, he visits me there, and the next morning comes this note, “I had thought to spend a leisurely day with you there, but as it was not convenient. … What is this all about anyhow? To me, sometimes it seems as though you are hiding yourself away in the mountains.” In reply, I send just this:\n\nWith such exchanges going on, the ninth month arrived.\n\nToward the end of the month, I did not see him for as much as two nights in a row—my response when he sent only a letter:\n\nbefore I could complete a reply – In passages like these, one can see her quietly exulting in the power of her person and poetry to move him. In response to her poem, he not only reciprocates with a poem of his own but also rushes to her side.\n\noak forest – It is to be remembered that the euphemistic title for his office at this time is “a tall tree among oak trees.”\n\nhe cheated me by showing up himself – It is clear that she regards herself as being shortchanged when he does not reply with a poem. Shinozuka Sumiko, whose interpretations I have found most illuminating, has singled this passage out for attention: “not only Kaneie but almost anyone would assume that showing up in person to meet her directly would be a much more profound expression of love than taking part in an exchange of poetry. However, it seems Michitsuna’s Mother felt a little differently. … I would conjecture that for Michitsuna’s Mother, the domain of communication between hearts that could be reached through the exchange of poetry was more important than anything” (Shinozuka Sumiko, “Kagerō nikki no shudai o megutte,” in Joryū nikki bungaku kōza, vol. 2 [Tokyo: Benseisha, 1990], 102-3).\n\nperiod of abstinence – The activities of Heian aristocrats were directed by a complicated calendar based on the principles of Chinese yin-yang cosmology. This calendar, which plotted the moves of unseen forces, could determine which directions it was safe to move in, whether you should stay away from your residence for a specified period of time, whether you should stay secluded at home, and so on. Regular periods of abstinence were part of the calendar. During these periods, one abstained from contact with others, sexual activity, and certain foods. Being in violation of Shinto taboos, such as coming into contact with death or blood, could also require a period of abstinence. Underlying the whole system was the belief that staying in harmony with these prohibitions would assure health and good fortune and, conversely, breaking them would invite disaster (see introduction, pp. 22–24).\n\n/ turn my sleeves inside out – A folk belief held that sleeping with one’s sleeves turned inside out would cause either one’s lover to appear in one’s own dream or oneself to appear in one’s lover’s dream.\n\nrather trite – This is one of the places where she seems to be assessing something in the past from the vantage point of her present moment of writing. Looking back she seems to feel that this poem did not do justice to her emotions.\n\nfire of loving – This phrase comes from the pun on hi, “fire,” that is embedded in the word omohi, “love, longing.” Some commentators speculate that it was her use of this conventional trope in this poem that occasions the above evaluation of the poem as trite (Uemura Etsuko, Kagerō nikki kaishaku taisei, vol. 1 [Tokyo: Meiji Shoin, 1983-95],111-12). However, most tropes in this age were conventional, and she uses the same trope in other poems without seeming to be bothered by its well-worn quality.\n\nmy father, was to leave for Michinoku Province - This marks the point when her father embarks on the career path of provincial governor, a position that was lucrative but socially inferior. It is most likely that this first post was obtained through the influence of his new son-in-law, Kaneie. Characteristically, Michitsuna’s Mother is not interested in recording here what this move may have meant in terms of status or economic rewards, but rather the poignancy of parting from her father.\n\nImmediately, this reply came back:\n\nAnd before I could complete a reply, he arrived himself.\n\nThen another occasion, after some time had passed and I was not seeing him as often as before, on a day when the rain was falling, there was a message, “I’ll come in the evening,” and I sent back:\n\nFor a reply, he cheated me by showing up himself.\n\nAnd thus, the tenth month arrived. It was a period of abstinence for me; continually fretting at our forced separation, he wrote:\n\nIn reply, though it was rather trite:\n\nWith things going on in this way, there came a time when the person I relied on most, my father, was to leave for Michinoku Province.\n\nThe season, late autumn, is such a sad time itself, and I still can not say that I am really used to seeing my husband; every time I see him now, I just burst into tears, and feel so sad and uneasy, there is nothing to\n\nthe one who is to go– Her father.\n\nSue pines – Reference again to Kokinshū no. 1093 (cf. p. 58), where the lover pledges that his love could never change or else waves could rise and sweep over “Sue pines” mountain. Suwe also means “end,” and Kaneie cleverly embeds the suwe of suwe no matsu into yukusuwe, “the end of the road ahead,” the word borrowed from the father’s poem.\n\nYokawa – One of the three centers of the Tendai Buddhist monastery on Mt. Hiei in northeast Kyoto. It is recorded that on the fifth day of the twelfth month in this year, Kaneie’s father attended a series of lectures on the Lotus Sutra at Mt. Hiei, and Kaneie may well have accompanied him (Zenshū, 134).\n\nwhich I can compare it. My husband expresses sympathy for me and although he keeps saying he will never forget me, as I wonder if his heart will really be true to his words, I only feel even more sad and anxious.\n\nNow the day has come for them all to leave; the one who is to go cannot restrain his tears, and I, the one who is to stay, am sadder than I can say. “We are way behind schedule\"—even though urged thus by his attendants, he cannot leave, rolling up a letter and pushing it into an inkstone box beside him, once again breaking into tears that sprinkled down, he left the room. For awhile, I have not the heart to look at what he has left. Having watched until he went out of sight, pulling myself together, I approach, and when I look at what sort of thing was there, this poem is what I see:\n\nThinking that he intended to have this seen by my husband, I feel so sad, and place it back just as he had left it; not long after that, my husband comes to visit. As I am lost in my own thoughts and do not meet him with my eyes, he consoles me by saying, “Come now, this is a perfectly ordinary occurrence in the world. Your persistence in going on like this must mean you do not trust me.” Noticing the letter in the inkstone box, “Ah, how touching,” he says, and sends off after my father this:\n\nIn this way, the days passed. Imagining my father traveling under strange skies brought sadness, and my husband’s heart did not appear to be something I could rely on that much.\n\nThe twelfth month came. From him, who had gone up to Yokawa on some business, there was this, “I am snowed in. I miss you very much.” I sent back with the messenger:\n\ngave birth to a child – The phrase in the original is the vague monoshitsu, “[I] did something,” but from the context we know this is the birth of her first and only child, Michitsuna.\n\nletter’s tracks – The familiar pun on fumi, “letter, writing” and “footsteps, tracks.”\n\nthree nights in a row – In the circumstances, this could easily mean he has consummated a marriage with this other woman.\n\nMachi Alley – A small street that ran north and south between Muromachi Street and Nishi no Tōin Street. Some commentators identify it as present-day Shinmachi Street.\n\nAs we exchanged such words, the year, fleetingly and without purpose, came to an end.\n\nAround the time of the new year, when I had not seen him for two or three days, I was to be away for awhile, so I left this with the instructions, “Should that person come, give him this”:\n\nHis reply:\n\nAs we carried on saying such things, something that had never been before came to be; I passed a miserable spring and summer, and then, around the end of the eighth month, somehow gave birth to a child. His care for me at that time was most tender.\n\nThen, around the ninth month, just when he had left one day, for no particular reason, I opened a box that happened to be there and saw a letter obviously intended for another woman. Greatly astonished and thinking I would at least let him know that I had seen it, I write on the letter:\n\nAs I worried, things went much as I feared, and around the end of the tenth month, there comes a time when I do not see him for three nights in a row. With an air of unconcern, he excuses himself by saying, “I just wanted to test your feelings by staying away for a while.”\n\nWhen evening fell, he says, “There is some business at court that I can’t get out of,” and leaves; I do not believe him and have a man follow him who came back saying, “It seems that his Lordship went to a certain place on Machi Alley and stayed there.” So that is how it was; although I was utterly miserable, I didn’t know what to say; it was about two or three\n\nso I composed – It is very unusual for her to initiate an exchange. She might write a poem in response to an inquiry in prose from him, but this is one of the few places where she initiates the communication.\n\nSorrow, sorrowing … – This is one of her most famous poems. It has been included in several poetry anthologies, most notably in Hyakunin issbu (One Hundred Poets, One Poem Each), the poetry anthology that became the basis for the poem card game that has to a certain extent kept the court poetry tradition alive for a large audience up until this day. For a recent translation of Hyakunin issbu that gives detailed information about the text’s tradition of interpretation, see Mostow, Pictures of the Heart.\n\nIn the Japanese poetic tradition, there are hundreds of poems expressing a woman’s chagrin and sorrow at waiting alone through the night in vain for her lover to come, but this is perhaps the only poem by a woman who intentionally barred access to the lover. The last line of this poem has a staccato quality to it, almost as though the words overcome great reticence.\n\nIt is interesting that the headnotes to this poem in several anthologies and historical accounts make no mention that Kaneie had just taken up with another woman and change the context by saying Michitsuna’s Mother’s poem was a response to the chagrin of her husband when she took her time opening the door (Helen McCullough, Ōkagami, 167). This gives the poem a more conventional context, since it was almost unthinkable that a wife would bar the door to her husband.\n\nto be so late to open – Kaneie picks up the verb akuru, “to dawn,” literally, “to open into day,” from Michitsuna’s Mother’s poem and puns on “to open a door.” His poem along with his note seems to indicate that he is confident she would have opened the door to him if he had only stayed long enough.\n\nThird Day Festival – The third day of the third month was the momo no sekku, “Peach Festival,” a celebration originally imported from China. It was customary to decorate the house with peach blossoms and drink wine in which peach blossom petals had been steeped. This festival is still observed in modern Japan, where it has been designated the Doll Festival and honors girls through the display of dolls that evoke Heian court culture.\n\nMy sister’s husband – This is an interpretation based on the vague phrase in the original, ima hito kata, “that other person.” From the context, it is assumed that she is speaking of the husband of an elder or younger sister about whom we have very little information outside of what is provided in the diary. There is a record of Fujiwara Tamemasa marrying a daughter of Tomoyasu, Michitsuna’s Mother’s father, and from that piece of information, it is conjectured that the author is referring here to Tamemasa.\n\nthe wine drunk - The word sugi, “passed,” can also be taken as a pun for suki, “drink wine.”\n\ndays afterward, just before dawn, that there was a knocking on my gate. Thinking that it must be him, I felt wretched, and as I did not have the gate opened, he went off to that other place. The next morning, I felt I couldn’t just leave things as they were, so I composed:\n\nI wrote this with more than usual care and sent it attached to a faded chrysanthemum. His response, “I was going to wait until dawn to see what would happen, but just then a messenger from the court came and called me away. It was just as you say”:\n\nWell, it got very strange; he carried on quite openly as though there was nothing amiss when one might have expected him to try and hide the affair a little and make excuses about having to work at court and such. He became more and more inconsiderate; there was no end to it.\n\nThe year changed over and the third month arrived. We had the whole place decorated with peach blossoms for the Third Day Festival; I wait; he does not come. My sister’s husband, who has hardly wanted to leave her side, did not come either. Then early on the morning of the fourth, both men arrived together. Our attendants, who had been living in a state of expectation since the night before, thinking there should be more blossoms, went out to gather them here and there. From within the house, watching them break off branches with such determination, I couldn’t quite enter into the spirit of it all, and so I scribbled:\n\nHaving written it, I thought to myself, Why not leave well enough alone, it\n\n“once in three thousand years” – A legendary peach tree in China was said to bring forth fruit only once in three thousand years. Kaneie turns this into a metaphor for the eternal quality of his love.\n\n[ ] – These square brackets note a place where the manuscript is damaged and a piece of text is missing.\n\nI seemed to feel strange – Zenshū notes that this locution “seemed to” indicates a sense of distance between her feelings at the moment of writing and the feelings at the time of events: “She probably wrote it that way because in the midst of her recollection, she felt that her feelings at that time were so miserable she can hardly identify with them as her own” (Zenshū, 139).\n\ntrees of sorrow–The word for sorrow, nageki, can also be interpreted as nageki, “abandoned trees.”\n\npart and wither– Pun on karuru, “separate” and “wither.”\n\nwould be disagreeable to have it seen, but he noticed my attempt to hide it and snatched it away, making this reply:\n\nMy sister’s husband, hearing this, responded with:\n\nNonetheless, now he was visiting the Machi Alley in a totally open manner. [ ] … him at least; I seemed to feel strange and to brood on regrets. Although I was caught in this inexpressible misery, what was I to do?\n\nI have been watching the comings and goings of my sister’s husband; now he is moving her to a more settled place. I who am to be left behind feel all the more the loss. Realizing that it will be difficult to see her at all, I am truly sad, and when the carriage comes to fetch her, I send this out:\n\nThe response was made by her husband:\n\nLeaving these words behind, they departed together.\n\nJust as I thought would happen, I have ended up going to bed and waking up alone. So far as the world at large is concerned, there is nothing unsuitable about us as a couple; it’s just that his heart is not as I would\n\nthe place that he has been familiar with for years – A reference to Tokihime, Kaneie’s first wife, who had already borne him a son before he entered into the relationship with Michitsuna’s Mother. She went on to bear him four more children through the years.\n\nTokihime and Michitsuna’s Mother were social equals, coming from the same middle-ranking aristocratic class of provincial governors. It is clear from how Michitsuna’s Mother writes about Tokihime that much as she seems to have wanted Kaneie to herself, she did not expect that his relationship with Tokihime would end. In fact, as is the case here, she seems to feel some sympathy with Tokihime when she knows that they are both being neglected. Judging from Tokihime’s responses, however, the feeling of sympathy was not mutual. After all, Michitsuna’s Mother was a distinct threat to the continuity of her marriage much as the Machi Alley woman was a threat to Michitsuna’s Mother. Since they are from the same social class, she replies politely to inquiries from Michitsuna’s Mother, but one can sense a guarded quality to her responses.\n\nEven from your pond’s depths … – There are three puns in this poem: soko, meaning both “your” and “bottom of pond,” karu, “to reap” and “to be separated,” and finally, ne, “root” and “to sleep.”\n\nYodo marsh – Yodo is a place-name in Kokinshū associated with makomo, “wild rice.” Yodono can also mean “night-time dwelling.” Tokihime here demonstrates her poetic erudition and indirectly makes the point, “This is his real home.”\n\ncolor deeply fades – Reference again to the notion that the dew and frost of autumn bring out a deeper color in leaves before they wither and die. It looks like a paradox in English because the verb utsurofu means “to change color,” either to a deeper or lighter shade, whereas “fade” means “to change to a lighter color.” Nonetheless, the change betokens imminent demise, and in that sense, the English “fade” is a better translation. In the sixth month, which is still the season of summer rains, it is usually the fading of flowers that is invoked in poetry. For her to speak of the lower leaves changing to a deeper color is to speak ahead of season. But then, the changing/fading of her husband’s love is also “ahead of season.”\n\nthese gazing eyes, I grow old – Pun on nagame furu ma ni, “while the long rains fall” / “while I grow old gazing.”\n\nsplendid will their color be – He turns her out of season motif into a positive statement to the effect, “your beauty/our love will only grow deeper as time passes.”\n\nMeeting fall—from favor – Pun on aki, “autumn” and “to grow tired of.”\n\nhave it; it is not only me who is being neglected, I hear he has stopped visiting the place that he has been familiar with for years. As I have exchanged correspondence with that lady before, I send this to her on the third or fourth day of the fifth month:\n\nHer reply:\n\nThe sixth month arrived. From the first part of the month, long rains poured down. Looking out at the garden, something I wrote for myself:\n\nAs I pondered these things, the seventh month came.\n\nAround the time when I was thinking to myself, if the marriage is over and done, perhaps that would he better than just having him come infrequently, there was a day when he visited. As I said nothing, there was an uncomfortable feeling in the room; in the course of making conversation, one of my attendants happened to mention the “lower leaves” poem that I had written the other day. Upon hearing it, he said this:\n\nAt which, I drew the inkstone to me and wrote this:\n\nhe would be floored, then get up and leave – This colloquial translation attempts to capture what Zenshū describes as “seemingly a proverbial expression of the time.” It involves a play on the meaning of tafururu, “to fall down” and also “to be silenced” (Zenshū, 141).\n\nSmoke from salt fires… – Salt fires are the fires used to boil the vats of brine to make salt. This poem pivots on several puns, fusube, “to smolder/to be jealous,” kuyuru, “to smoke/to suffer,” and the embedded pun hi, “fire,” within omohi, “thoughts.”\n\nsmall arrow – Miniature arrows were often attached to the pillars of the sleeping place as talismans to ward off evil.\n\nAlthough I thought… – The subject and object for omohi idzuru, “to think of,” are not specified, and commentators vary in their opinions as to whether she is saying “I thought you no longer thought of me” or “I thought I no longer thought of you.” Zenshū commentators, whose interpretations I am in general following, have opted for the latter, but I have decided to render both possibilities in the translation. The poem also contains a pun on the word ya, “arrow/hey!” The use of such a colloquial expression as “hey” is unusual in court poetry. Zenshū notes that this poem was included in a later poetry anthology under the “humorous poems” category (Zenshū, 142). Perhaps this use of colloquialism was the reason for such a categorization. It is also interesting that she should use such playful language in an apparently serious poem.\n\nmy house was on his way – As we learn later in the diary, the author’s residence was “at the edge of the training ground for the horses of the Left Imperial Guard,” which would have put it on the eastern edge of the imperial palace compound at approximately present-day Ichijō Avenue and Nishi no Tōin Street. Kaneie’s residence at this time is unknown.\n\n“In the long nights of autumn, when there is no sleep” – Most commentators agree that this line is a quote from the “White-haired woman of Shang-yang” by the famous T’ang poet, Po Chü-i. The poem is about the woman of Shang-yang who came to the palace of the T’ang emperor, Hsuan-tsang, at the age of sixteen, but because of the popularity of his favorite consort, Yang Kuei-fei, never had a chance to meet her lord and died at the age of sixty without ever seeing him. A couplet from this poem is included in the popular Wakan rōeishū (An Anthology of Japanese and Chinese Verse for Recitation) (Kawaguchi Hisao, ed. Wakan roeishū. Ryōjin hishō, vol. 73 ofNihon koten bungaku taikei [Tokyo: Iwanami Shoten, 1967], 106). Although this anthology was compiled after the writing of this diary, since it was an anthology of the best-known couplets of Chinese poetry, the poem’s inclusion there attests to its wide currency.\n\nThus his behavior continued; not breaking off relations entirely, he visited from time to time, but our hearts did not melt toward one another and so we drew farther apart. If he came and I was in a bad temper, he would be floored, then get up and leave abruptly. On one occasion, someone living nearby who understood the situation said this upon his leaving:\n\nAnd so on, our exchange of resentments had got to the point that the neighbors were even meddling; these days I have not seen him for a particularly long while.\n\nIn ordinary times, I was not like this, but when my heart was thus distracted, I had a tendency not to notice the objects around me. I thought to myself, Will it be thus, our relations will end without there being a single keepsake for me to remember the affair by? About ten days after this, a letter from him arrived; among other things, he said, “Send back the small arrow attached to one of the pillars of the bed chamber.” So there was a keepsake, I thought as I untied and took down the arrow. I sent it back with this:\n\nThus, he as good as stopped coming at all, but as my house was on his way to and from court, at dusk and at dawn, try as I might not to listen, I could not help hearing him clear his throat as he passed by and I would be unable to melt away into sleep. “In the long nights of autumn, when there is no sleep\"—yes, it is just like that; seeing, hearing, feeling these things defies description. And just when I was wishing that somehow I would not have to be subjected to such sights and sounds, I hear my attendants in low whispers saying things like, “The one who used to\n\nthe place … that has a lot of children - Once more a reference to Tokihime, Kaneie’s first wife. This manner of referring to her is particularly interesting because at this time in the diary Tokihime did not yet have a lot of children. She had only the one son, Michitaka. This is a place where it is clear Michitsuna’s Mother is writing a long time after these events with a consciousness of what eventually happened.\n\n“How shall 1 do it? There is something I would ask …” – A quotation from a poem that was anthologized in Yamato monogatari, section 89. The full poem is:\n\nHow shall I do it?\n\nThere is something I would ask\n\ntrout in the fish weirs,\n\nwhere is he caught, the one who\n\ndoes not ask after me?\n\n(Katagiri Yoichi ed., Taketori monogatari. Ise monogatari. Yamato monogatari. Heichū monogatari, vol. 8 of Nihon koten bungaku zenshū [Tokyo: ShSgakkan, 1972], 327)\n\nBy quoting the first half of the poem, the author intends us to understand her real meaning, which is the second half of the poem. For another translation, see Mildred M. Tahara, Tales of Yamato: A Tenth Century Poem Tale (Honolulu: University of Hawaii Press, 1980), 50.\n\nanother year- The first year of the Tentoku era, that is, 957.\n\ntraces and books –The now familiar pun on fumi, “traces, footsteps/writing, letters, books.”\n\nonly in your bay – The reader may wonder why Kaneie persists in protestations of steadfast love when his actions contradict it. When I asked this question of Akiyama Ken, he replied, “Within the conventions of waka poetry, the only mode of expression available to him is the avowal of devoted love.”\n\nbe so fond of her never seems to come now.” Hearing such whispered gossip, I feel so unhappy; the fall of every evening is just wretched.\n\nI understand that his visits to the place that one hears has a lot of children have definitely stopped as well. How sad, thinking her pain must be even worse than mine, I send her a letter of consolation. It was around the time of the ninth month, I wrote profusely and included this:\n\nHer reply, written with great care:\n\nYet, seemingly unable to break off relations with me entirely, he visited from time to time and winter came. Going to bed, rising, I had only my little one for a companion; without meaning to, I would find myself reciting the old poem, “How shall I do it? There is something I would ask trout in the fish weirs …”\n\nWe crossed into another year and spring came. Around this time, he forgot to take a book he had been reading and had me send it to him. On the wrapping paper, I wrote:\n\nHis reply sent back as a sort of excuse:\n\nAs his messenger was there, I sent back:\n\nplace that was in such ascendancy – The Machi Alley woman’s place.\n\nchoosing an auspicious direction – That is, choosing a direction in accordance with the astrological calendar.\n\nhe rode out in a single carriage with her– For him to ride in a single carriage with her is to make a public display of his intimacy with her.\n\nritual pollution – Due to the connection of childbirth with blood, birth was considered polluting.\n\nbizarre– She seems to regard it as bizarre that he would communicate with her so casually about the matter.\n\nsumo tournament – The sport of Sumo wrestling had been part of the court’s annual celebratory activities at least from the eighth century. The tournament was held in the seventh month, which was closer to the present calendar’s August.\n\ntwo bundles of cloth – One of a wife’s chief contributions to the marriage relationship was the production of clothing for the husband and his household. For someone of Kaneie’s rank, participation in court ceremonies and festivities required a large quantity of fashionable and beautiful clothing. Later, in book three, we will see her describing with nostalgia some of the garments that she had made for her husband. Her skill as a designer and seamstress may have been one of the qualities that attracted Kaneie to the author in the first place.\n\nCloth was very valuable and therefore recycled, which is why he sends both old and new cloth. The production of the clothing was a joint activity for the women in the household, as we can see from their participation in the discussion and eventual decision about the request. The obvious chagrin of Michitsuna’s Mother and her women attendants could be because some of the requested garments might be women’s clothing intended for the Machi Alley woman, or simply because the request comes at a time of estrangement.\n\nSome of the more outspoken attendants – The phrase in the original here is namagokoro aru hito, “persons with a raw heart,” the basic meaning of nama being “uncooked.” Accordingly nama can be extended to mean “immature,” “inexperienced.” I have further extended this to “outspoken.” Furthermore, I differ from the Zenshū commentators here in interpreting this remark about the attendants as part of the narrative prose in this section as opposed to part of quoted speech.\n\nand, exchanging such words as these, we came into summer.\n\nAt the place that was in such ascendancy these days, it became time for the birth of a child, and choosing an auspicious direction in which to remove her for the lying in, he rode out in a single carriage with her, raising a continuous din that could be heard over the entire capital. It was such a racket, so painful to my ears, and did he really have to pass right by my gate? I scarcely felt like myself at all, unable to say anything, and hearing noisy complaints from the lowliest servants to my closest attendants, who were saying things like, “Such a thing, it tears one apart. And there are so many other streets he could have taken,” I thought that all I wanted to do was die, yet things do not go as we want. From now on, I thought wretchedly, if the best is not to be, then it would be better to break off relations entirely so that I wouldn’t have to see him. About three or four days after this, there is a letter from him. Thinking over and over to myself as I read it how awfully cold it was, I noticed this, “Someone has not been feeling well here, so I have not been able to come and visit. However, just yesterday, a safe delivery was accomplished. I haven’t wanted to trouble you with the ritual pollution.” This surpassed all for being bizarre. I merely sent back, “Message received.” When I heard that in response to my servant’s inquiries, the messenger had responded, “The household was blessed with a boy,” I felt as though my chest were blocked. About three or four days later, he showed up himself as though nothing were the matter. With a look on my face of what are you doing here, I did not welcome him in, and finding things very uncomfortable, he left. This happened often.\n\nThe seventh month arrived and around the time of the annual sumo tournament, two bundles of cloth, one of used and one of new cloth, are delivered. “Please, sew these,” is the message. I am appalled, what on earth does he mean by this. Just looking at them, I feel my eyes darken with anger. My mother says, “How regrettable. There must be no one over there who can do these.” Some of the more outspoken attendants gathered around and said, “This is really the limit. Suppose we don’t do it and just see what sort of bad things they’ll say about us.” And so it was decided; we sent the bundles back and as we suspected, we heard he had to divide them up here and there to get them done. He must have\n\nplumes of words– Plumes of the pampas grass were conventionally likened to putting things forth clearly; therefore the phrase “put forth plumes” could also mean “to express one’s meaning clearly.”\n\neast wind – The word for east wind, kochi, also means “here” and can be used to express “come here.”\n\na good exchange – It is interesting to note that the author’s sense of what constitutes a “good exchange” is not necessarily related to the content of the verses. There is no need to overtly express conciliation in the poems; it is the engagement in the poetry exchange that is the most important.\n\nWhile still lying down – There is very little of the explicitly erotic in the diary. However, the inclusion of this phrase about lying down implies that they are still lying in bed after making love, and it charges the next section and particularly the poems exchanged with a muted erotic quality.\n\nwild-looking hue–In the classical lexicon the word iro, “color,” is full of connotations ranging from the “world of the senses” and “the beauty of a woman” to “sensual love.” Its meaning in this poem is nonspecific, partaking of all those connotations.\n\nwhite dew – Again this is a reference to the notion that it is the dew of autumn that brings out the most brilliant color in the flowers and leaves. With the images of the pampas grass a few poems before, it is clear that the setting of the diary has shifted to autumn. As with “color” above, the meaning of dew here is indeterminate but points to a constellation of connotations, which here include the season of autumn, tears, sorrow, and a hint of eroticism introduced with the notion of wetness.\n\nfound it very cruel, for more than twenty days, there were no inquiries from him.\n\nThen, on what occasion I can’t quite recall, there was a letter from him. It said, “I would very much like to come and see you, but it seems you are feeling very cold toward me. Certainly, if you were to say ‘Come,’ in fear and trembling, I would be at your door.” I thought not to send a response to this, but as on all sides there were cries of “That would be too cruel of you. It would really be too much,” I sent back:\n\nHe sent back:\n\nAs there was a messenger to take back a response, I wrote:\n\nand so on, we had a good exchange and he came to visit again.\n\nWhile still lying down and gazing at the flowers of the front garden blooming in rank, multicolored profusion, we said the following. It seems we both had feelings of resentment toward each other. When he breaks the silence with this:\n\nI reply:\n\nlate rising moon – In the lunar calendar, the dates of the month correlated with the phases of the moon, so we can infer that this exchange was taking place after the twentieth of the month.\n\ndesperate – This word is an interpretation. The original has only sa, “like that.” The implication appears to be that she does not feel so desperate for him to stay that she would stoop to pleading. It is remarkable how well the author conveys the meaning of what was not said in this conversation.\n\nso he stayed – With these words, she signals her victory in this dance of emotion, poetry, and will.\n\nleaves of words – Pun on koto no ha, “words,” which includes the word ha, “leaves.”\n\nthe tree trunk itself– Pun on mikara, “myself,” which includes the word kara, “tree trunk.”\n\nSaying such things, it was painful between us as always.\n\nAs the late rising moon was just about to emerge from behind the mountain ridge, he makes as though to depart. Then, perhaps seeing the expression on my face as I think surely, tonight at least he doesn’t have to go, he says, “Well, if you really think I ought to stay …?” But I didn’t feel that desperate, so I say:\n\nHe replies:\n\nand so he stayed.\n\nOn another occasion, there was something like a typhoon and he came calling about two days later. “With a wind like the other day, no matter what, an ordinary person would have inquired after our well-being,” I say, and he seemed to think there was some truth to this, yet with nonchalance he replies:\n\nI reply thus:\n\neast ivind… here – This poem and the next poem pun on kochi, which means both “east wind” and “here.”\n\nhe seemed to acknowledge –Here was another victory.\n\nrainfalls… shake me off– A pun on furi, “to fall” (of rain), and furi idzu, “to shake someone off and leave.” It implies the simile, “to shake me off like cold rain.”\n\nwell, isn’t he a willful person – With this elliptical sentence, she acknowledges this time when poetry failed.\n\n“wild oats” – The phrase is “dropped seed” and refers to a child not officially recognized by the father. “Illegitimate” is too legalistic a term for this fluid society.\n\nunrecognized son – Similar to the “dropped seed,” the expression denotes the male offspring of a prince from a union with a low-ranking attendant.\n\nHe rejoins with:\n\nBeing in no mind to be beaten on this one, I say further:\n\nAt this, he seemed to acknowledge that what I said was reasonable.\n\nAt another time, around the tenth month, he says, “There is some business I simply must attend to” and makes as though to leave. While it is not quite raining hard enough to be called “winter downpour,” it is quite miserable and still he intends to go out. In some astonishment at this, I can’t help saying:\n\nbut even at this—well, isn’t he a willful person?\n\nThings going along in this fashion, it seems that after the birth of her child, that “splendid” personage of Machi Alley lost favor; in the midst of my feelings of hatred, I had wished to see her live long enough to suffer just as I had; now not only had that come to pass, but to top it all off, was not the child that had been the occasion of all that annoying clatter dead? The lady was the “wild oats” of an unrecognized son of a prince. Needless to say, she was extremely base. Just for a time, she had been able to cause a stir among unknowing people; now suddenly it had come to this—how must she be feeling? When I thought she must be even a little more miserable than I had been, at that moment, I felt as though I\n\nI felt as though I could breathe again - Literally the expression is “my chest clears.” This passage is one that has occasioned a lot of comment. It shocks because it bares thoughts that we as human beings may have but tend not to make public. For that reason, the passage is often singled out as an example of her honesty. For instance, Murai Jun has said, “Here the hatred of the author for the Machi Alley woman is nakedly expressed. Due to this, there are some readers who criticize the author, but as for me, I am inclined to feel respect for this author who has written down her true feelings to this degree with no prevarication as the truth of her heart” (Murai Jun, Kagerō nikki zenhyōkai [Tokyo: Yūseidō, 1978], 81).\n\n“swept the pillow” for him at his former place - This means he is again being welcomed to Tokihime’s place. Pillows were usually made of wood so they were swept clean of dust after not being used for a while.\n\n“It is because you are so young” - In this elliptical citation of criticism from an acquaintance may be seen the implied norm of forbearance to which she was expected to conform. Her refusal to conform is attributed to her immaturity.\n\njust write it all down - This introduces her long poem. Since the production of long poems was very rare at this time, it is an unorthodox form of expression for her to choose. The question arises of why she would choose poetry over prose in this situation. Shinozuka Sumiko suggests that “it can be said particularly of book one that there is a gap between Michitsuna’s Mother as a composer of poetry, whether waka or long poems, and Michitsuna’s Mother as a writer of prose, almost as though she were a different person. She chose the long poem form precisely because she had that much to say. There is no doubt she would not have been able write it in the form of a prose letter. . . . We can also see here the strength of Michitsuna’s Mother’s ability to write poetry” (Shinozuka, Kagerō nikki no kokoro to hyōgen, 80).\n\ncolor of your leaves of words - Pun on koto no ha, “leaves” and “words.”\n\nleft beneath a neglected tree sorrowing - Pun on nageki/nagekareki, “tossed out, neglected tree” and “to sorrow, lament.”\n\nWinter . . . regrets for him - Reference to her father’s departure for the north country in late autumn of the year before last and the grief she felt that first winter that he was gone.\n\nhe had left words - Reference to her father and his parting poem for Kaneie.\n\nquick as frost falls and melts - This simile is implied in the original with an image that is embedded in the associative vocabulary of shimo, “frost,” and okitsu, “fell” (as of frost), as well as “left” (with respect to his words), and hodo mo naku, “quickly.”\n\ncould breathe again. Now, I hear they have “swept the pillow” for him at his former place. However, as for here, since he visits as irregularly as before, there are times when I think there is no affection left between us. My little one here has just begun to say a few words. Whenever his father takes leave of us, he always says, “See you soon,” and the little one hearing this goes around imitating him.\n\nThus again, it is still not a world in which I can feel at ease even though meddlesome people say things like, “It is because you are so young”—I just find it too cruel of him when he says things like “Have I done anything wrong?” with such an air of innocence and unconcern that I don’t know what to do. There are just these millions of thoughts milling around in my mind; when I get so riled up that I want to tell him every bit of what is on my mind, I am so upset that I just can’t say anything at all.\n\nI think to myself, what if I just write it all down and show it to him:\n\nno eggs were laid – An associated image with wild geese and a pun on kahi nasbi, “no eggs” and “nothing happened.”\n\nempty as the cicada’s shell – When a cicada larva has emerged from the ground and climbed up a tree, its exterior dries and cracks open; the flying insect emerges, leaving the shell behind.\n\nhow shallow it was – This begins a long string of associative vocabulary related to water and containing the puns, ura, “heart”/“bay” and ukise, “shoals”/“wretched world.”\n\nwould it vanish, let it go – A reference to the possibility of her death. She is so miserable she would just as soon die.\n\nlike a bear vine creeping down Azalea Hills – Associated images with Michinoku, the northern province where her father is posted.\n\nif I were to go to a world where the tears of grief would not fall – Reference to becoming a nun. This is the first time she explicitly considers this option as a way out of her troubles.\n\nfine Chinese robes – Well-worn robes were a conventional metaphor for one’s spouse.\n\neven without warm lining – Pun on ura mo naku, literally “without a lining,” but also taken figuratively to mean “without ulterior motive or prejudice,” which I have rendered here with the adverb “simply.”\n\nleave this world – Reference again to becoming a nun.\n\nwith heaven’s drifting clouds – Allusion to Kokinshū no. 784:\n\nas distant as those\n\ndrifting clouds in the heavens\n\nhas my love become\n\nand yet each day I see him\n\nhere before my searching eyes\n\n(Rodd, Kokinshū, 274\n\nThis poem is a particularly appropriate allusion here because it was composed by the family of a woman to criticize her wayward husband, who had ceased visiting in the evening.\n\nour young pine – Her infant son, Michitsuna.\n\nseaweed you don’t see me – There is a pun here on miru, a type of seaweed, and miru, “to see.”\n\nshells of meeting – The word for shell, kahi, is homophonous with meeting. The two halves of a bivalve shell meeting is also an image in the background of the pun.\n\nIf the white waves roll up – Metaphor for his visiting her.\n\nThis I wrote and placed on the two-tiered shelf for him to find.\n\nIn a few days, he visited as usual, since I did not go out from my inner chamber to meet him, it was painful for him to stay, so he went\n\nI received this from him! – Her surprise at receiving a long poem back from him is registered with an exclamatory particle here. This was quite an effort on his part, and he does express his feelings openly, which is perhaps why although his poem is critical of her and offers nothing in the way of apology, it still serves as a basis for reconciliation.\n\nfades with each meeting, not so . . . – With a pun on aki, “autumn” and “to grow tired of,” and a play on the range of meaning that tsune can have, from “usual” to “always,” Kaneie can say simultaneously, “Love is usually thought to wane with each meeting” and “Meeting each autumn [the anniversary of our marriage], my love is always true.”\n\n“protect this child” – Reference to her father’s parting poem.\n\ntree of sorrow – Perennial pun on nageki, “neglected tree”/“sorrow.”\n\ngreen pine who pines – He picks up her reference to their son as a young pine and then makes the conventional pun on matsu, “pine”/“to wait.” Pines by association call up Tago Bay in the Suruga district, which in turn evokes the famous view of Mt. Fuji from Tago Bay.\n\naround Mt. Fuji – Mt. Fuji was an active volcano in this era, hence its use as a metaphor for hidden passions and jealousy.\n\ncut the tie – This begins a string of associative language related to thread, including the pun mahikuru, “to wind on a spool” and “come.”\n\nconfused and lost…falcon – An extended pun elaborates the sense of this passage. Hashitaka no suzu means “falcon’s bells”; hashitaka no suzuro nite means “having nothing to hang on to, unsettled.”\n\nflew to ask after you – Contains pun on tohikuru, “to fly and come” and “ask and come,” which makes a bridge between the falcon image and his relation of a particular visit.\n\nbut you lay down alone – Reference to the night she barred the door to him.\n\nthe wakeful moon shone with every drop of its light on your fine wooden door – A metaphor for himself pounding on her door.\n\naway taking only the letter. Then, I received this from him!\n\nWho then would see dawn with the woman of one night? – Reference to a casual liaison. He frames this as a rhetorical question implying the answer, “Surely not I.”\n\nbecome bound to someone unbound – Another possible interpretation for kakaranu, which I have translated as “unbound,” is “someone who would not occasion your complaining.” Either way he is going so far as to suggest that she consider taking a different husband.\n\nChinese robes – Once again he takes up a phrase from her poem and alters its context.\n\njust lay them over the bamboo frame – It was the custom of the times to scent robes by laying them on bamboo frames over censers of incense.\n\nkindled by our memories passing through the censer’s lattice eyes – The embedded pun of hi, “fire,” in omohishi ide, “recall,” brings the notions of heat and memories together. The openings in the censer and the bamboo frame are called me, “eyes,” and Kaneie uses it as a pun for his own eyes.\n\nin the vale of Hemi in the country ofKai – An area in present-day Yamanashi Prefecture famous at that time for the production of fine horses for the court, and thus preparing the introduction of the string of images and vocabulary associated with horses.\n\nthe colt – Their son, Michitsuna.\n\nand so on.\n\nAs the messenger was still there, I send this:\n\nMichinoku – This is an area in northern Japan also famous for horses, and since it is where her father is, it is appropriate as a reference to herself.\n\nRight away comes back – The quickness of his reply gives a sense of the excitement of their exchange.\n\nColt of Obuchi – Obuchi in present-day Aomori Prefecture was associated in poetry with wild, uncontrollable horses.\n\nunbridled colt – The word koma, “colt,” is also a pun for “to come.”\n\nAt Shirakawa Border – There were border checkpoints between the provinces in Heian Japan. One would pass through the Shirakawa Border if one were bringing a horse down to the capital from Michinoku Province in the north.\n\ndifficult going – This phrase contains the same pun as above, koma, “colt”/“come.”\n\ntryst on the seventh night – The seventh day of the seventh month was famous in Chinese legend as the night when the heavenly herdsboy and the weavermaid (thought to be the stars of Altair and Vega) were allowed to meet. They were separated for the rest of the year because they loved one another so much they neglected their work if they were together.\n\nthat place that I had thought so alarming – The Machi Alley woman’s place.\n\ntrying every stratagem under heaven – Presumably these were efforts to draw Kaneie back to her. The author feels relieved because she knows the attempt will be in vain.\n\nWhat must he have thought of it? Right away comes back:\n\nAnd I reply:\n\nHe replies:\n\nThere is a note with it, “I’ll cross the border day after tomorrow.” It was the fifth day of the seventh month. And as it was around the time of a long abstinence for him, I send back a reply like this:\n\nHe seemed to think there was some justice in what I said and began to treat me with a bit more consideration, and the months go by.\n\nAs for that place that I had thought so alarming, I was relieved to hear that she was now frantically trying every stratagem under heaven. While I was spending the time worrying myself to pieces, thinking, I have never known what to do about this relationship right from the start, as he was promoted to the fourth rank – This was a significant promotion for Kaneie, who was thirty-four years old at the time. When she married him, he was fifth rank and captain of the Right Guards. In 956, he was promoted to the post of lesser counselor, still within the fifth rank. The position of lesser counselor was not one with great responsibilities but as part of the government office directly serving the emperor, it did allow access to the inner court and an opportunity to be in the presence of the emperor. With his promotion to the fourth rank, he was obliged to retire from his post as counselor. The promotion to the fourth rank was of major importance in the court hierarchy because it involved a significant increase in entitlements of income-producing land, servants, cloth, and other goods. It was a feature of the Heian court system that remuneration was based primarily on rank rather than office (McCullough and McCullough, A Tale of Flowering Fortunes, 802, 829). Yet service in office was important for placing oneself in a position to be promoted in rank.\n\nassistant to some stuffy sort of ministry – This is the War Ministry. The low esteem in which this ministry was held in the Heian period can be seen in the author’s dismissive tone here and by Kaneie’s own lack of interest in the post. Moreover, as his assigned post of assistant could be done by someone in the fifth rank, it is no wonder he found it distasteful. Thus, although the promotion in rank was welcome, his actual posting condemned him for the time being to political obscurity. Ironically, this low point in her husband’s political career is actually one of the happiest periods in the marriage from her perspective.\n\nthe prince, who was in charge of the ministry – This is Prince Noriakira, who would have been about thirty-nine at the time. He was noted as a man of elegant tastes, being skilled in the composition of Chinese poetry and the playing of the koto. He was not, however, in the first circles of power as is indicated by his posting in the unpopular War Ministry. McCullough notes that the ministry “had little to do aside from choosing and rehearsing contestants for the Court’s archery matches” (McCullough and McCullough, A Tale of Flowering Fortunes, 810). Nonetheless, Noriakira had the aura of royal prestige about him, which can be felt in the respectful tone the author reserves for him in the diary. This was one of the high points in the author’s married life, when she is able to participate in her husband’s playful and courtly correspondence with royalty.\n\nProbably one of the reasons Kaneie wanted to have Michitsuna’s Mother for a wife was her skill at poetry composition. He may actually have expected her not only to help him with the composition of poems for occasions like this interaction with the prince, but also to be the collector for his poems, creating just such a record as the following.\n\nLike scattered threads – With this image, the prince introduces the textile motif that they spin out with elaborate wordplays on vocabulary associated with cloth, spinning, and weaving through the series of six poems. The following translations of the poems are quite free in an attempt to convey the playfulness in the exchange. The puns in this and the following poem are tsukasa, “office,” containing tsuka, “spool,” and kuru, “to come”/“wind on a spool.”\n\nsummer-spun thread–Natsuhiki, “summer spun,” is a pillow word for thread. This poem is founded on an allusion to a verse of a popular song, which puns on me, the word for wife and a weight measure for cloth: “Of white summer-spun thread, I have seven measures, let me weave them into robes and wear them as wives.” The other pun in the verse is on furu, “to pass” (of time)/“to string the warp threads on a loom.” I left this pun out of the translation.\n\nAs numerous as seven – Kaneie takes up the allusion to the popular song introduced in the previous poem by bringing in the number seven. He doesn’t mean literally that he has seven wives.\n\nunbearable as it is, it must be the result of my own deplorable sins in a previous existence, and such, it so happened that having served as a lesser counselor for some years, he was promoted to the fourth rank and accordingly retired from his present position at court. In the next round of promotions, since he was given a position he did not particularly like as assistant to some stuffy sort of ministry, the world of affairs came to seem distasteful to him, and as there was nothing else for him to do but to visit here and there, he would come to stay leisurely for two or three days at a time with me.\n\nOne day, there comes this missive from His Highness, the prince, who was in charge of the ministry toward which my husband did not feel attracted:\n\nHis respectful reply:\n\nA response comes back right away:\n\nHis respectful reply:\n\nAgain, from the prince:\n\nWith time’s passage … – The textile motif in this poem is maintained with a pun on i, “thread,” embedded in itodo, “how could,” and a pun on futomo, a form of the verb furu, “to pass,” and “to string on the loom,” but in this case they are there to keep the associative language play going rather than to strongly convey metaphorical meaning. I have suggested the presence of the textile motif with the word “unravel,” which is not explicitly in the poem.\n\nin avoidance of a forty-five day period of abstinence – If the movements of unseen powers determined that one would have to remain secluded in one’s own residence, one could avoid it by moving somewhere else temporarily. Her father is presumably away attending to his duties as provincial governor.\n\nExtending into the sixth month – The fifth month was the season for the monsoon rains. This year the rains seem to have continued longer than usual.\n\nthis message that was quite mad – Presumably she considers it mad because it makes fun of their very real and practical problems.\n\none stares out at the long rain – This sense is actually conveyed in the pun on nagame, “to stare, gaze out” and “long rain.”\n\n“Two or three women would really be too few but as I have probably already overstepped the bounds of propriety, I shall stop here.”\n\nHis respectful reply:\n\nAround that time, somewhat after the twentieth of the fifth month, in avoidance of a forty-five day period of abstinence, I moved into my absent father’s residence, which was only separated by a hedge from the residence of the prince. Extending into the sixth month, the rain poured down ferociously and we were all cooped up on account of it. Since the house is quite run down, we had a big commotion dealing with rain leaking in. Noticing this, the prince deigned to send over this message that was quite mad:\n\nHis respectful reply:\n\nAgain, he deigned to correspond, “So you can’t take it easy?”\n\nmuddy path of love—pun on kohidji, “muddy” and “path of love.”\n\nYou who with the night… - This translation follows the interpretation of Murai Jun in taking the yo in the first line as “night” rather than “world” (Murai, Kagerō nikki zenhyōkai, vol. 1, 102). However, I do not agree with Murai in assuming that the reply poems throughout this section are actually by Michitsuna’s Mother spoken in her own voice. From that perspective, in this poem, Michitsuna’s Mother would be empathizing with the prince’s lovers on the basis of her own experience. While this is an interesting interpretation, it seems to me that this exchange is still ostensibly between Kaneie and the prince.\n\nAs we looked at this together- There are only a few places in the diary where she notes explicitly that they did something together. They mark places of exceptional intimacy and harmony (see Shinozuka, Kagerōnikki no kokoro to hyōgen, 94).\n\nhe said something like, “How outrageous of him” - It is difficult to know what Kaneie means by this remark. Perhaps he is remarking on the crazy turn the poetic exchange has taken. Having started with joking about the problems with a leaky roof, the prince’s bantering has lead to an exchange where male and female speaking positions have become blurred. The prince’s last poem is particularly ambiguous. It may be taken as a reproach of Kaneie for not visiting, which would mean that the prince is assuming a feminine persona. Yet, the first line speaks of Kaneie as the one“damp with tears,” which in association with the previous poem would put Kaneie in the feminine position of waiting for the prince.\n\nhis usual place - Presumably his first wife, Tokihime’s place.\n\npinks—The author spoke of herself as a pink in an earlier poem (cf. p. 63). Here a different name, tokonatsu, which can also mean “eternal,” is used for the same flower. However, given that it is the same flower with the meaning of “maiden,” the reference still has connotations of woman. A pun on woru, “to pick, break off” and “be in a place,” along with the tokonatsu pun makes it possible to derive two paraphrases of the poem’s meaning: “Do you not know that the pinks soothe thoughts of love and that I have picked them from your hedge,” and “Do you not know how being at your hedge soothes my thoughts of eternal love.” This poem could easily be interpreted as being flirtatious.\n\nI show this to him - Since the prince’s poem and note could easily be interpreted as an amorous advance, it is interesting that she does not hide it from her husband. Moreover, although the correspondence that follows is characterized by ambiguity and indirection, it is nonetheless evident that the prince is not upset to think that Kaneie might have seen the poem, nor is Kaneie disturbed to have seen it. In a conversation about this passage, Akiyama Ken remarked that Kaneie was likely flattered to have the prince show an interest in his wife. Her stock goes up, as it were, since she is desired by a member of the royal family. Of course, this good humor might have evaporated had the flirtation exceeded the realm of play.\n\nThe water is high … - There are two puns in this poem: the first one is ura mo nagisa, “the bay too, the beach,” and the embedded ura mo naki, usually meaning “no ulterior motive” and here interpreted by the Zenshū commentators to mean “nothing between the hearts” (Zenshū, 160). The second one is the frequently occurring pun on fumi, “footprints‘7’letters.” Variations on these same puns recur in the following poems.\n\nHis respectful reply:\n\nAnd again from the prince:\n\nAs we looked at this together, he said something like, “How outrageous of him.”\n\nOn a day when my husband had taken advantage of a break in the rain to visit his usual place, there comes a missive from the prince. My attendant said, “Although I sent word, ‘The master is away,’ the messenger said, ‘Deliver it anyway.’” When I looked at what had been brought:\n\n“However, since this can come to nothing, I must bid you farewell.”\n\nA couple of days later when my husband appears, I show this to him, telling him, “This is what happened,” and so on, he says, “With this much time passed, it is not suitable to send a reply poem,” so we just send a note, “Recently, we have not had the honor of your communication.” The prince deigned to send this in response:\n\nin “man’s hand” -This is one of the most difficult passages to decipher in the diary. The three participants are playing a cat-and-mouse game with each other. The fact that Kaneie and the author ignore the prince’s poem about the pinks has puzzled him. He is trying to find out whether Kaneie saw the poem or not. When he says, “Is it true I shall hear from you yourself?” in the context of the communication between the two men alone, he may mean that he expects a personal visit from Kaneie. In the context of the communication involving the three of them, he may be looking for a direct response from the author. After all, his sending the poem about the pinks may simply have been to acquire a poem of hers in her own hand just for the fun of it.\n\nThis brings us to the matter of “hands,” which further complicates this passage. Why does the author specifically mention that the prince wrote in “woman’s hand” and their response was in “man’s hand”? “Woman’s hand” was the name for the cursive style of writing Japanese that was preferred by women (see the introduction, pp. 19–20). It was not written exclusively by women, however, since it was a mark of courtliness for a man to be able to write it fluently. “Man’s hand” refers to a stiffer writing style in which the graphs are closer to the square forms of Chinese characters (see illustrations on pp. 108-9).\n\nThe prince’s choice to write in woman’s hand could be construed as a display of his elegance, or as an indication that his correspondence is meant for the author as well as Kaneie. Or, if his previous letter had been written in woman’s hand, he may be simply being consistent so as not to arouse suspicion. Whatever the prince’s motives in the choice of hands, Kaneie’s response in man’s hand has the effect of bringing the communication solidly back into the “man’s world” again.\n\npurification ceremonies— She refers to the Shinto purification ceremonies, which were normally performed at the edge of a river or a lake in the sixth month. She will describe in detail one of these purification ceremonies in book two.\n\nTanabata Festival— The festival celebrating the legend of the herdsboy and weavermaid stars on the seventh day of the seventh month.\n\ndeparted spirit’s bad influence - In this period, disease was thought to be primarily caused by the malign influence of spirits of the dead. Therefore Buddhist rites to pacify those spirits were the usual prescription.\n\nmountain temple I have visited before—From later evidence in the diary, it is assumed she is speaking of Hannya Temple at Narutaki, located in the northwestern hills of Kyoto.\n\nObon Ceremony—The festival to celebrate the souls of departed ancestors who it was thought returned from the world of the dead at this time of the year. One therefore had the opportunity to fete them with offerings of food and other gifts before sending them back.\n\nwatching this together- From this phrase alone we know that Kaneie came to visit her at the temple. Again a feeling of warmth and intimacy suffuses the scene. She makes nostalgic reference to this occasion again in book two when in very different circumstances she returns to this temple (p. 233).\n\nThe year changed over - It is 963. She has been married for nine years.\n\nadmitted to serve in the inner chambers—Although his actual post does not seem to have changed at this time, Kaneie was once more granted the privilege of access to the inner chambers of the imperial court.\n\nKamo Purification Rites - These were Shinto rites of purification performed on the bank of the Kamo River in the fourth month by the high priestess of the Kamo Shrine. It entailed a grand procession that people liked to watch as a parade.\n\nhis villa next door— From this remark, it seems that the author is once again staying at her father’s residence.\n\n“This is what I have been thinking. Your complaint of no news is misplaced. Is it true that I shall hear from you yourself?” This was written in “woman’s hand.” Though it seemed graceless to reply in “man’s hand.”:\n\nAgain from the prince:\n\n“Or so I think; I hope there has been no misunderstanding.”\n\nThings going on in this way, the time for the purification ceremonies passed and the next day was the day of the Tanabata Festival. It was the fortieth day of a forty-five day period of abstinence for me. These days, I have not been feeling well and have been troubled by a cough; wondering if it might be the result of some departed spirit’s bad influence, I think to try a Buddhist rite, and as my place is so cramped and the weather so awfully hot, I go up to a mountain temple I have visited before. Since it is the fifteenth or sixteenth of the seventh month, it is time to celebrate the Obon Ceremony. Looking out I see a procession of servants hurrying to bring offerings, carrying them in the oddest of ways, some on their shoulders, some balanced on their heads, watching this together, we find it so engaging and laugh. Then since I was feeling quite back to normal and the abstinence period had past, I went back to the capital. Autumn and winter sped by with my barely noticing them.\n\nThe year changed over, there was nothing particularly different. The times when his heart was unusually affectionate were times when all seemed peaceful. From the first of this month, he was once again admitted to serve in the inner chambers of the court.\n\nIt was the day of the Kamo Purification Rites in the fourth month, when the prince from before graces us with this letter, “If you are going to view the event, I would like to ride in your carriage.” In the margin, he had also written a little poem that began “This year for me…[missing text].” The prince had not lately been at his villa next door. We thought he\n\nWe thought he was off visiting a place nearMachi no Koji, and inquiring about this - The details are not given for their movements, but Zenshū commentators assume that Kaneie and Michitsuna’s Mother go off in a carriage together to pick up the prince (Zenshū, 162—63). There seems to be some uncertainty about his location, but they appear to have guessed right that he is visiting someone (presumably a wife or lover) in the Machi no Koji area.\n\nRequesting an inkstone- Kaneie requests an inkstone from the Machi no Koji house in order to send in a note. This detail informs us that Kaneie and the author are in a carriage and not back at her house when this note is written. The author’s presence is assumed because she would not report on this if she had not seen it. It is most likely that she also helps with the composition of the poem.\n\nThus, it came about that we went out together—The original contains the phrase morotomo ni, “together,” which the author uses very sparingly to indicate times when she felt a particular sense of intimacy with Kaneie. In this case, she is not only together with Kaneie but also with the prince. This experience would have been a very unusual one for her.\n\nthe bank of the Kamo River- It seems that both her father’s residence and the prince’s fronted the Kamo River.\n\nbrief purification rite - Pouring water from the river over one’s hands while praying to have one’s sins and defilements washed away was a purification rite. It might have been a customary thing to do when one walked by the river.\n\nwish for it … digging efforts- Pun on horu, “to wish, desire”/“dig.”\n\nHowever, when I think of what I have written up to this point, I really wonder how it is - This is a difficult passage. For a history of commentators views on it, see Uemura, Taisei, vol. 2, 93–94. The original is very elliptical: saredo, sakizaki mo ikaga to obohetaru kashi could be rendered literally as, “However, the preceding, how [is it]? I am wondering.” The question is, to what does “the preceding” refer: her account of the immediately preceding poem, or is it everything she has written up to that point? I prefer the latter. I also think that the author is actually pausing here to ponder how her diary will appear to her readers.\n\nSpring passed by - This is a new year, 964.\n\n“cries at sunset” - Pun on the name of the type of cicada, higurashi, and “sunset.”\n\nwas off visiting a place near Machi no Koji, and inquiring about this we were told, “Yes, he is here.” Requesting an inkstone, he wrote this:\n\nThus, it came about that we went out together.\n\nThat season passed. At another time, when the prince was in residence next door, we passed by his garden. Last year we had noticed some luxuriantly growing pampas grass that had lovely flowers and looked very graceful. My husband had requested, “If you are going to divide the roots sometime, please be so kind as to give me a little.” Now, time had passed and we were with a companion going along the bank of the Kamo River; we just pointed out to our guest, “That is the prince’s place,” and my husband sent a servant in to pay his respects. He told him, “Just give this message to his servants, ‘I should like to visit but now is not such a good time as I have someone with me. I thought I might inquire about the pampas grass that I spoke of some time ago.’” We went on our way. Since we just performed a brief purification rite, we were back before long. One of the servants called out, “Pampas from the prince,” and there it was, carefully dug up and placed in a long box with a slip of green paper attached to it. When we looked at it, this was what was written:\n\nIt was so charming but since I have forgotten what sort of poem we sent back, I will have to leave it at this. However, when I think of what I have written up to this point, I really wonder how it is.\n\nSpring passed by, and around summer, I felt that he was getting a lot of night duty. He would come early in the morning and stay the day but it seemed strange to me that he should always leave at night; just as I was thinking this, I heard for the first time that year the voice of the higurashi, “cries at sunset,” cicada. It startled and moved me so:\n\nit is unlucky— It was apparently a superstition that talking while sitting in moonlight was unlucky.\n\nlam the only one who really knows - In other words he is assuring her of his faithfulness. Just as the moon invariably takes a course to the west, he will stay true.\n\nthe place he really considered his home - Again, it is likely she means Tokihime’s place.\n\nlam still without a lot of children - They have been married now for ten years, and she has only the one son, Michitsuna.\n\nat a mountain temple - When the family realized the mother’s illness was serious, they had taken her to a mountain temple, probably the temple at Narutaki, in the hopes that the rituals and holy atmosphere might effect a cure. It is there that she died, and the author fell ill as a consequence.\n\nWhen I said this, he seemed to find it difficult to leave. Thus, uneventful days passed and his heart seemed not to flag in faithfulness.\n\nOne full moon night, even though it is unlucky, we talked to each other lying in the moonlight, as I spoke of all the things that had made me sad over the years, it brought back memories of the past, thus sunk in my thoughts, I could not help saying:\n\nHe replied in a playful manner:\n\nThus, although he seemed to be someone I could depend on, as the place he really considered his home was different from mine, it is just not a world I would have wished for. Despite my having consorted with this most fortunate man for months and years, I am still without a lot of children, and thus, my position is uncertain and these worries are the only things of which I have a surplus.\n\nThings being as they were, nonetheless, while at least I had my mother, it was one thing—but then, she succumbed to a lengthy illness, and finally around the beginning of autumn, passed away. My feelings of utter helplessness and loss were much greater than usual for people at such a time. Of all the family members, I was the one who lost myself in thoughts of, / don’t want to stay behind, let me die now too, such that—what a thing it was—my arms and legs became stiff and unmovable and it seemed as though I couldn’t breathe. Things being as they were, having met with this fate at a mountain temple, since the person to whom I had so many things to say was down in the city, I called our young one to my side and with difficulty managed to say, “I will likely die here. What I would like you to convey to your father is this, ‘As for myself, do not go to any trouble when I die, but for my deceased mother, over and beyond\n\nMy father— Apparently at this time, her father was serving as governor of Kawachi Province, which was a province close to the capital.\n\nabout to ignore the prohibitions - If he were to come into the room and kneel at her side or touch her, he would take on her defilement, that is, the defilement of contact with death, and have to enter into a period of ritual seclusion himself. This would mean he would not be able to perform his duties at court. This could be avoided by remaining at the door in a standing position.\n\n“the foot of the mountain” - Allusion to a poem from Shū’iwakashū:\n\nAs the river mist\n\nhas risen and enfolded\n\nits foot, it is now\n\nin the sky that the autumn\n\nmountain is visible.\n\n(Komachiya Teruhiko, Shut wakashu, vol. 7 of Shin Nihon koten bungaku taikei [Tokyo: Iwanami Shoten, 1990], 58.)\n\nintoning the Buddha’s name - This refers to the chanting of the name of Amida Buddha, who is thought to dwell in the Western Paradise.\n\nwhat others do for her, please hold special services.’” Then, just saying, “What is to be done?” I could no longer speak. After the long days and months of my mother’s suffering, people of the household had somehow accepted that it was over and nothing further could be done; now with this illness of mine, everyone was caught up again in worry; there were so many people bewildered saying, “What are we to do?” “How has it come to this?” and having already cried would begin to cry again. Even though I was unable to speak, I was still conscious and could see. My father, the person most concerned about my welfare, came, and said, “You still have one parent. How could you have come to this?” He urged me to swallow some broth, and drinking things such as this, my body began to mend. However, still brooding on things, I felt as though I was not really alive. I remembered how on some of those days when my mother was suffering so and was unable to talk, the only thing she would say, thinking about the uncertainty of my life, which I lamented night and day, was “Alas, what is to become of you?” This she would say often under her breath; remembering this brought me to a state of barely feeling alive.\n\nHe heard about my mother’s death and came to visit. I was hardly conscious, aware and not aware of things around me. He was met by one of my serving maids, and when she told him of my condition, “She really is in such a bad way,” he burst into tears and seemed about to ignore the prohibitions concerning defilement to come to my side, but was dissuaded. “Really, your lordship, you must not,” so he stayed standing. His whole bearing and attitude were such that it seemed he really cared deeply for me.\n\nThus, all the various tasks connected with the funeral service were attended to; many people took great pains and so it was accomplished. Presently, we were together at this melancholy mountain temple with nothing in particular to do. At night, I would lie awake, grieving until dawn; when I looked at the mountain’s countenance, I saw that just as in the old poem, “the foot of the mountain” was truly enfolded in mist. I thought, In the capital, who do I really have to go home to? No, better just stay here and die, yet even thinking this, I was pained for my little one who would have me live.\n\nIn this way, the tenth of the month passed. I listened to the monks telling stories when they took a rest from intoning the Buddha’s name. They said, “There is a place where you can actually see a person who has passed away. It seems that the form of the person disappears when you get close. But from a distance you can see it.” “Where is this country?” I asked. “It is called ‘Comfort to the Ears Island.’” Hearing them speak about it one after another, how much I wanted to know where it was. Feeling sad, I could not help saying:\n\nmy elder brother - This is the first mention of her elder brother, Masayoshi, who shares the same mother with the author and is therefore on close terms with her throughout her life (cf. p. 26). From periodic references throughout the rest of the diary, it appears he was often living at the same residence as the author.\n\nThe closest members of the family, particularly the children by the same mother, would have been all in seclusion together at the mountain temple for the week following the mother’s death.\n\n“where insects pipe lonely calls”- Allusion to poem number 853 from the “Poems of Grief” section of Kokinshil:\n\nthat single clump of\n\nwaving plume grass planted by my lord long ago\n\nis now an overgrown field\n\nwhere insects pipe lonely calls\n\n(Rodd, Kokinshū, 294)\n\nhigh enough office to serve in the inner court - None of her male or female relatives serve at court, so no special provisions need to be made for their accommodation during the ritual confinement.\n\nAnd as I spoke, my elder brother hearing this broke into tears, saying:\n\nWith things going along like this, although each day he came to ask after me, paying his respects while standing, just at that time, I had no heart for anything, and it was also irritating that he could not stay on account of defilement. I was in a dazed condition; we did carry on a correspondence that was somehow difficult, but I guess because I was not in a state of mind to remember things, I have forgotten all that we said.\n\nI was in no hurry to go home but it was not something to leave up to one’s feelings. This day when we are all to leave has come. When we were coming here, my mother lay across my lap, and worrying only about how to make her more comfortable, I was bathed in sweat, yet, even so, there was hope in my heart and I still felt there was something I could do. This time, no matter how comfortable I was and able to ride with such an awful lot of space in the carriage, the trip home was miserably sad. Even getting home, getting down from the carriage and looking around, without being fully aware of it, I was all the more sad. Here where we used to come out on the veranda and sit together were the plants we had cared for; from the time when she became ill, they had just been abandoned, yet here they were growing in a great tangle blooming profusely. Performing a Buddhist rite in mother’s memory, everyone was lost in their own thoughts. I alone remained just gazing at the scene around me in a vacant way, and intoned the old poem, “plume grass … where insects pipe lonely calls,” and feeling like this:\n\nSince no one in the family was of high enough office to serve in the inner court, we could pass our period of ritual confinement in the\n\nThe ceremony for the forty-ninth day-In Buddhist belief it is thought that the soul of a dead person remains for forty-nine days after death. At the end of forty-nine days, the soul is then reborn according to its accumulated karma. Services were held every seven days after death, but the service on the forty-ninth day was the largest and in a sense the funeral proper.\n\nmy husband took care …—It appears that Kaneie takes care of the arrangements for the funeral, and, as we learn later in the diary, he continues to take responsibility for the mother’s memorial services for many years. This was one of the ways he supported her economically.\n\nintentions for the ceremony— People would commission works of Buddhist art as an expression of their prayers for the future of the deceased. The intention is to have the departed person be reborn as a Buddha.\n\nnominal ordination— When an illness appeared grave, it was common to administer a nominal ordination in the hopes that it might save the person’s life.\n\n“Cloud Forest” hermitage - Unrin’in, a temple of the Tendai school of Buddhism located in the Murasakino district of northern Kyoto.\n\nsame place, each making a chamber for themselves with curtains. In the midst of all this, I alone could not get my mind onto other things; at night, from the time when I heard them start to invoke the Buddha’s name, I would just cry continuously until dawn. The ceremony for the forty-ninth day was held with everyone present at the house. Since my husband took care of most of the arrangements, a lot of people attended. As an expression of my own intentions for the ceremony, I had an image of the Buddha painted. After that day was over, everyone went their separate ways. I was left feeling even more bereft; there was no help for it, but he, having some compassion for my helplessness, visited much more often than before.\n\nThen, when in an absentminded sort of way, I set about putting in order the things that had been scattered about when we left for the temple, just looking at the things that she had used everyday from dawn to dusk, or the letters that she had written, nearly stopped my heart. At the time when she was weakening, on the day when she received the Buddhist precepts for nominal ordination, she had died just like that with the reverend priest’s stole laid over her. Now I found that stole among the other things. Thinking that I should really return it, I got up very early in the morning to write a note. The moment I set down on the paper, “This, your venerable stole,” my eyes clouded over with tears; I carried on, “Thanks to this”:\n\nand with this poem I sent it back.\n\nA little later, I heard that the elder brother of the owner of the stole, who was also a monk and whom we had had offer prayers and services, suddenly died. What must the brother be feeling? I felt very sorry for him, and at the same time it seemed that all the people I depended on were disappearing. Thinking thoughts like that I felt quite disturbed, and often made inquiries after the younger monk and sent offerings. Due to certain circumstances, he was serving at the “Cloud Forest” hermitage. When the Forty-Ninth Day Ceremony for his brother was complete, I wrote this:\n\n“whether in the mountains or in the fields” - Allusion to poem number 947 from the “Miscellaneous” section of Kokinshū:\n\nwhere shall I go to\n\nrenounce this sorrowful world\n\nwhether in the mountains\n\nor in the fields my heart surely\n\nwill be distracted and stray\n\n(Rodd, Kokinshū, 321)\n\none brother and an aunt -Her brother, Masayoshi. The aunt is unidentifiable, but she is most likely one of her mother’s sisters.\n\nThe year changed - It is 965.\n\nremoving our mourning clothes— It is now the end of their official year of mourning. They remove the clothes and purify them by immersing them in the river.\n\ndusting my koto - The koto is a horizontal zither. She would have been prohibited from playing it during the year of mourning.\n\nfrom my aunt came - The original is just anatayori, “from over there,” but it is assumed to be the author’s aunt. The aunt would have been staying in a separate room and would have sent this in writing.\n\nand sent it along; mind you, my own feelings of misery and loss were like those in the old poem, “whether in the mountains or in the fields.”\n\nFeeling empty and alone, I passed through autumn and winter. In the same place are living with me one brother and an aunt. Although I think of my aunt as a parent, still there are times when I weep until dawn longing for the past. The year changed, spring and summer passed by, and soon it was time to commemorate the first anniversary of mother’s death; for this time only we held the service at the same mountain temple as before. Remembering so many things from the year before deepened the sadness I was already feeling. From the moment the monk leading the service began to speak, “Clearly, it is not that you have come here seeking the autumn mountain scenery; you are here to have made clear to you the heart of the scriptures to which your eyes have been closed.…” Hearing just that much, I became unaware of everything around me and I barely noticed all the things that came afterward. Once everything that should have been done was done, we returned. Quickly removing our mourning clothes, we performed a purification ceremony with our grey clothes and even our fans. As we were doing that, this poem came to me:\n\nI cried wretchedly, but just left it at that without saying anything to anyone.\n\nSo the commemoration ceremony was complete, and as usual I had nothing in particular to do. Without really intending to play, as I was dusting my koto, my fingers strayed to play a few notes and it struck me that indeed the period of mourning was over. Sadly, it had passed so quickly. As I was brooding on this, from my aunt came:\n\nAt this, even though it was nothing very special, thinking about it, my tears overflowed:\n\nmy sister— This would appear to be the same older sister that moved out with her husband, Tamemasa.\n\nmove far away - She is likely accompanying Tamemasa on a tour of duty in the provinces.\n\ninauspicious behavior -To cry too much at parting was thought to bring on misfortune.\n\nmountain barrier-She is thinking of the Ōsaka Barrier, the border checkpoint between the capital and Ōtsu.\n\na new year arrived - The year 966.\n\nMeanwhile, among all my family, my sister was one on whom I particularly relied, but this summer, it had come about that she would have to move far away. Now that the official period of mourning was complete, she is getting ready to leave. Thinking about this I feel so bereft, I am quite dazed. Now, finally, it is the day of departure and I go to see her. I take as parting gifts just one outfit of clothes and some trifles placed in a lidded box. Her household is in a terrible commotion with all the fuss. Both she who is going and I are unable to look one another in the eye; we just stand in front of each other unable to stop our tears. Everyone says things like, “What are you crying for?” “Get a grip on yourselves.” “How very inauspicious behavior for a departure.” Then just as I was thinking how terrible it would be to see her get in the carriage to leave, someone came from my own household to relay a message from him. “Hurry back. I have just got here,” and the carriage was brought up for me. My sister, who was wearing a double, dyed overrobe, and I, who was only wearing a thin overrobe of red ochre, parted by taking off and exchanging these robes. It was just past the tenth day of the ninth month. When I came back to my house, I cried wretchedly until he said, “Why on earth do you behave so? You’ll bring bad luck.”\n\nThen, at night, I was thinking to myself, They must have got as far as the mountain barrier either yesterday or today. The moon was so affecting, I was gazing at it, and my aunt was still awake playing the koto. She said this:\n\nShe was indeed one who felt the same as I. I answered:\n\nWhile I spent my time imagining their journey, a new year arrived.\n\nit is not convenient - He does not seem to regard her place as appropriate for holding the various rituals for his cure. Or, he may not want to cause her the inconvenience. One can understand that he would like to be back in his own residence where he can be attended by those servants who have looked after him since he was a child.\n\nnot likely you will remain single - It is difficult to know what is in the background of this remark. Does he mean, “With your beauty and talents, another man will surely marry you,” or “You will not be able to survive without the support of another man”? It could be a bit of both.\n\nhow on earth could you ever come to me— This remark indicates how unusual it was for a woman to visit the residence of a man. There seems to have been a feeling of impropriety about it.\n\nelder brother - Again we assume she is referring to Masayoshi.\n\nsomeone who took that amiss— Most likely Tokihime.\n\nAround the third month, one day when he had just come here, he took ill, and I was bewildered by this suffering, about which it seemed nothing could be done; it seemed very serious. He said, “Much as I would like to stay here, as it is not "
