        "text": "Last week’s Raw had a huge overarching angle that dominated the bulk of the show and saw Stone Cold take Vince McMahon hostage, torture him, and then threaten to shoot him in the head in the middle of a wrestling ring. It was not a thing I was a fan of back in the day and 23 years after the fact it hadn’t gotten any better. So will this week be more of the same or will we get two hours of hot in-ring action? Probably not the latter since the only thing announced in advance for this episode was the fact that Motley Crue would be showing up. Oh goody…\n\nHighlights For Children!\n\nWe get highlights of last week’s hostage angle to kick things off for us. What was in the letter that Austin gave to Vince McMahon?\n\nMeanwhile Backstage…\n\nStone Cold Steve Austin arrives in the arena with a huge smile on his face.\n\nMeanwhile in the Arena…\n\nVince heads out in his wheelchair accompanied by Patterson, Brisco, Slaughter, Big Bossman and a gaggle of men in suits that I do not recognize. Vince gets on the mic and says that Austin is in the building tonight. He then says that he holds Austin responsible for everything that happened to him last week but he wants to know where everyone was in his hour of need. He calls out Patterson, Brisco, and Slaughter for abandoning him last week. Bossman I guess is spared from his wrath since Vince sent him away to protect the rest of the McMahon clan and apparently didn’t fuck that up. Vince then wants to know where the good people of Madison, Wisconsin were last week.\n\nHe asks them if they have morals, values, or a sense of basic human decency and they respond by chanting, “ASSHOLE!” at him which…fair play. I mean Vince got kidnapped and held hostage in Milwaukee last week and while it’s not impossible that someone in the audience went to both shows seeing as how Madison and Milwaukee are only like 80 miles apart I’m going to guess the vast majority of people in the crowd that Vince is calling out for their bloodthirst and/or inaction were probably watching at home the week before and couldn’t do much to help out old Vinnie Mac.\n\nVince then talks about all the indignities he suffered at the hands of Stone Cold last week. Not only did he reinjure his ankle but he also ruined a perfectly good Armani suit via urination. But all the threats of violence and literal crimes the Stone Cold committed against Vince McMahon are not all that important as the main thrust of Vince’s promo is the letter that Austin stuffed into his pocket last week.\n\nVince reveals that it was a legal document but Vince doesn’t elaborate any further on what sort of legal document it actually was just that he plans to fight it and take that fight all the way to the supreme court if need be hence the cadre of lawyers he’s brought out with him tonight. Vince then tells Austin that he’d do well to take stock in himself before he continues any further down this path.\n\nStone Cold then appears on the TitanTron and says that Vince should buy stock in Pampers. It’s funny because Vince pissed himself last week! Vince does not dignify this with a response and instead leaves with his entourage.\n\nMeanwhile at the Announce Table…\n\nWe then check in with JR and Jerry Lawler who confirm that Motley Crue will in fact be here and we’ll also get at least two (2) wrestling matches as Steve Blackman will face X-Pac for the European Championship in a match that I’m assuming will be happening next since as Lawler and Ross run down the card Blackman’s entrance music starts playing. The second match we’re promised will see Mankind & Al Snow take on the New Age Outlaws for the tag team titles.\n\nMeanwhile in the Arena…\n\nAs X-Pac makes his entrance we get some clips of Chyna getting arrested last week. Jim Ross informs us that she was arrested for failure to appear for a court date related to the Mark Henry sexual harassment suit. Ross goes on to explain that Chyna was released on her own recognizance but has taken a leave of absence from the WWF to deal with her legal issues.\n\nMeanwhile Backstage…\n\nWe see Vince McMahon conferring with his lawyers. He tells them he wants the document Austin gave him last week broken. They sort of hem and haw and Vince pounds his fist on the table.\n\nMatch 1: Steve Blackman vs. X Pac (c)\n\nWWF European Championship Match\n\nThe match finally gets underway. Since this week is pre-taped we didn’t actually miss a thing because of the wonky layout the show has had thus far. Blackman unloads on X-Pac with kicks and then puts him down with a side slam. We get a chinlock from Blackman and then a flying clothesline. This has been all Blackman thus far.\n\nHe whips X-Pac into the corner hard and then works him over with a series of elbows and then chops. X-Pac fires back but gets slammed and then nailed with a clothesline that sends him tumbling out of the ring to the floor.\n\nSteve Regal then shows up in his jorts, flannel vest and Timbs and starts wailing on X-Pac. The New Age Outlaws then head out to help their buddy X-Pac while a confused looking Steve Blackman watches on from the ring. While referees try to restore order Jim Ross wonders what reason Steve Regal could possibly have for attacking X-Pac. Jerry Lawler speculates that it might have something to do with the fact that X-Pac is holding the European Championship in spite of not being European.\n\n“You think X-Pac’s ever been to Luxembourg or Transylvania for that matter?” asks Lawler. I kind of love that Luxembourg and Transylvania are the first two European locales that popped into Jerry Lawler’s mind.\n\nWinner: X-Pac(?)\n\nI’m honestly not entirely sure what the outcome for this match was since there was never an official ruling and I’ve seen refs allow outside interference before without disqualifying folks so I’m not sure if X-Pac won the match via DQ, got counted out, or the match was just thrown out entirely. Cagematch has him being declared the winner so I’ll tentatively go with that but I know they’ve been wrong with stuff before so who knows? Not really sure why I care since it really doesn’t matter anyway it was a two minute match designed to set up a feud between X-Pac and Regal and it accomplished that. I am kind of bummed that we didn’t really get the karate kick showdown for the ages this match could have been. [NR]\n\nMeanwhile Backstage…\n\nWe check back in with Vince and his lawyers. He’s screaming at them, “You wrote it! Find a way out of it!” I guess these lawyers are responsible for whatever legal document Austin gave Vince last week.\n\nProducts & Services\n\nCall 815-734-1161 to get your own Rock “Layin’ the Smack Down” t-shirt for $25 plus $6 shipping and handling…or don’t because this commercial is 23 years old and the number is probably no longer in service.\n\nMeanwhile in Dok Hendrix’s Slam Jam Lair…\n\nDok Hendrix hypes up the November 29, 1998 Sunday Night Heat show in Philadelphia and encourages us to buy tickets. Stone Cold, Undertaker, Kane, Sable and all our favorite WWF Superstars will be there!\n\nMeanwhile Backstage…\n\nMichael Cole is standing outside a door with Stone Cold Steve Austin’s name on it. He says that last week Austin was unemployed but this week he’s got a private dressing room with his name on it. We will hear from Austin about this entire situation after the next match.\n\nMatch 2: Droz (w/ Hawk & Animal) vs. The Rock\n\nThe Rock does not have that wacky entrance music he had last week so I guess that really was something they just used for a single week. As he makes his entrance the announcers mention that he is already officially in the title tournament at Survivor Series and mention that he’s also technically the number one contender for that title. Lawler wonders if he’ll get a bye because of that but Jim Ross has no idea since this entire tournament is a Vince McMahon creation.\n\nIn the ring Droz and The Rock lock up and work back and forth for a bit until Droz manages to take the Rock down. They then exchange armbars. The Rock is apparently from the Hulk Hogan school of being a babyface and pokes Droz in the eyes to take over on offense. He runs Droz into the corner and pops him in the face but Droz nails him with a shoulder block to take back over.\n\nDroz armdrags the Rock and gets him in an armbar but the Rock comes back with a DDT. Droz, however, manages to get a sunset flip and earn himself a near fall a moment later. Surprising amount of offense from Droz in the early going but then the Rock remembers that he’s the Rock and Droz is just Droz.\n\nThe Rock clotheslines Droz and then taunts Hawk who gets on the apron and distracts the referee. This distraction allows the Rock then punches Droz in the cock to take over on offense. The Rock hammers away on Droz, driving him into the corner with rights until the ref pulls him back. Droz then comes back with some shots of his own and ends up planting the Rock with a powerslam for two. Droz heads up to the middle rope and looks for a flying shoulder block but ends up missing.\n\nThe Rock then plants Droz with a Rock Bottom and then sets up for the People’s Elbow. The Elbow connects and the crowd rejoices. The Rock covers and actually wins via the elbow drop with theatrics. Is Droz the first guy to actually get pinned off a People’s Elbow? I think he might be.\n\nAfter the match Hawk gets in the ring to console Droz who starts to get into it with Hawk, blaming him for his loss for some reason. Animal briefly tries to play peacekeeper but then just ends up leaving with Droz, leaving Hawk alone in the ring. We’re getting close to Hawk throwing himself or possibly being pushed off the TitanTron folks…\n\nWinner: The Rock\n\nNot a great match but at least it was a match with a finish that was more or less completely free of bullshit (yes a Hawk distraction did lead to the Rock punching Droz in the cock but did not lead to the finish at all). I will say that I am a big fan of guys higher up on the card randomly having matches with dudes lower down on the card since they can get clean wins without damaging the undercard guy’s credibility and in many cases making the undercard guy seem like a big deal just by being able to hang with someone that much higher up on the card than him. [**]\n\nMeanwhile Backstage…\n\nMichael Cole knocks on Stone Cold’s door and asks him about the document he gave Vince McMahon last week. Austin tells him to hold on then closes the door and can be heard conferring with someone else. Austin opens the door and tells Cole, “I’ve been advised not to say anything at this time, but we’ll have a statement in front of the people later on tonight.”\n\nElsewhere Backstage…\n\nVince’s meeting with his lawyers seems to be wrapping up. A pair of attorneys exit the room and as they walk past the cameraman stationed outside the door one mentions to the other that Vince, “doesn’t get it.”\n\nMeanwhile on the Stage…\n\nDX members Road Dogg, Billy Gunn, and X-Pac come out with Road Dogg doing his shtick but instead of introducing the “tag team champions of the world” he introduces “tag team champions of rock n’ roll” who are apparently Motley Crue. Not sure about how accurate that was in 1998 but whatever.\n\nMotley Crue then comes out and performs “Wild Side” with the DX lads doing some backing vocals. Vince Neil’s got a t-shirt proclaiming “FUCKER” on it. Stay classy Vince Neil. Anyway they sing a song. Billy Gunn continues his transformation into Mr. Ass by mooning everyone at the end of the song and Motley Crue’s bodyguard, a fella by the name of Test, gets a crazed “fan” in a torture rack and carries him away while JR and Lawler hype Motley Crue’s first ever greatest hits album. JR actually knows all the Motley Crue guys names this week so he’s got that going for him.\n\nSo I knew that Test’s gimmick was that he was Motley Crue’s security guy but I’d always assumed that was a shoot since I have zero memory of Motley Crue actually showing up on WWE television. I honestly don’t think I ever saw this episode before which seems weird to me. Back in 1998 did I get annoyed by the previous week’s angle and skip out on this week’s episode? I couldn’t say.\n\nHype!\n\nWe then get some hype for Stone Cold taking on Vince McMahon this week…on MTV’s Celebrity Deathmatch.\n\nMeanwhile Backstage…\n\nVince continues to rant about the document Austin gave him last week and wants to know why they can’t just void the contract.\n\nMatch 3: Kane vs. Gangrel (w/ Christian)\n\nKane heads out and Jim Ross lets us know that Kane will also be in the WWF Championship tournament at Survivor Series. The story here is that Kane’s apparently depressed and lonely after being abandoned by Paul Bearer and Undertaker last week.\n\nKane predictably dominates in the early going of the match, clubbering Gangrel around the ring before sending him out to the floor. Kane goes out and pounds on Gangrel and runs Christian over before heading back in. He continues to dish out the abuse, grabbing Gangrel by the throat and hurling him across the ring.\n\nGangrel gets hammered in the corner and planted with a side slam. Kane then heads up top but Christian grabs onto his leg to try and prevent him from jumping. Kane kicks him off but Gangrel has recovered and heads up to try and cut Kane off. He too ends up getting shoved off by Kane who then hits the top rope clothesline. Kane then goozles Gangrel, whose eyes hilariously pop out of his skull, and chokeslams him for the easy win.\n\nAfter the match Christian climbs up to the top rope and leaps off at Kane but just bounces off the Big Red Machine, barely staggering him. Gangrel also tries to topple Kane but even two on one Kane manages to endure. Edge then runs out and JR wonders if he is there to even the odds and help Kane. That is a good assumption on JR’s part since Edge hates Gangrel and Christian and JR had just spent the bulk of this match talking about how Kane had no one now that Paul Bearer and The Undertaker turned their backs on him.\n\nBut if there’s one thing I’ve learned watching all these Vince Russo booked shows, logic has no place in wrestling angles and Edge chopblocks Kane in the knee to topple him. He, Christian, and Gangrel then spam elbow drops on Kane until he does the zombie sit up and the vampires bail and escape through the crowd as a trio.\n\nWinner: Kane\n\nThe match was a fine squash and was apparently the impetus for the foundation of The Brood who kind of ruled but at present the creation of that faction seems completely random if you consider everything that has happened to date between Edge, Christian and Gangrel. I mean there is a chance that it all gets explained next week (or even later in this show) but it’s just as likely that it never gets mentioned again. Here’s hoping it’s the former. [*½]\n\nMeanwhile Backstage…\n\nWe check in with Michael Cole who says that he just spoke to Shane McMahon and the McMahon family will have a statement about the Stone Cold Steve Austin situation after the break.\n\nMeanwhile in the Arena…\n\nStone Cold heads down to the ring and gets on the mic. He says he’s not sure why Vince is so angry at him. He had told the cops that he signed autographs for that his gun was a toy and he told Vince that there wouldn’t be any pain and there wasn’t (except for all the times Austin slammed Vince’s injured leg in walls and roadie cases while pushing his wheelchair around backstage). He then says that he told Vince that he wouldn’t feel anything and he didn’t but he still pissed himself like a baby in the middle of the ring. Austin says that he did everything he said he would so maybe Vince should believe him when he says something but then again maybe he shouldn’t.\n\nAustin then pulls out a paper and says that he’s gotten himself a new WWF contract, one that guarantees him at least one world title shot which is all he needs to get the WWF Championship back. Austin then says the only way he’s ever leaving the WWF is if he quits and he has no intention of doing that…at least until they asked him to lose clean to Brock Lesnar in a match with no build a couple years later.\n\nAnyway Vince gets wheeled out by his stooges who he yells at to “STOP RIGHT HERE DAMMIT!” He does not seem to be in a particularly good mood. The fans are instantly on him, chanting, “ASSHOLE!” at the top of their lungs. Vince ignores them and tells Austin that there might not be anything he can do about Austin’s contract but he will make him say that he quits as tonight in that very ring Stone Cold will compete against Ken Shamrock in an “I Quit” match.\n\nVince then begins to rant about Austin having no conscience and the “ASSHOLE!” chants get really loud again. Vince gets further infuriated when Austin helpfully points out that 15,000 fans are calling him an asshole. Vince closes his eyes and talks about how Austin took an underachieving kid and turned him into a monster and in the process drove a wedge between a family.\n\nShane McMahon then appears from who knows where (he’s like halfway down the entrance ramp suddenly). Vince pleads for Shane to come to him but Shane instead walks down to the ring where Austin hands him a mic.\n\nShane tells Vince that he’s a man and an officer in the company and doesn’t have to listen to him anymore. He says that what Vince did to Austin was wrong so he hired him back and now after 28 years he finally has Vince’s attention. He says that while stars have come and gone in the WWF the one thing that has been a constant is that it has always, at the end of the day, been about Vince’s ego. He says that people always used to come up to him and be like, “Man it must be so cool to be Vince McMahon’s kid!” and he would lie and say that it was but no more.\n\nShane then goes on a lengthy rant about how nothing he ever did was good enough for Vince. He said that all he ever wanted was for Vince to be proud of him or tell him he did a good job but that will never happen because it’s always been about Vince. Vince calls him his boy but Shane tells him he’s not a boy anymore and Vince looks like he’s on the verge of tears. Shane tells him that he had the brass to stand up to him and now he’s just like his old man. He seems like he’s about to cry too.\n\nUp on the stage, Pat Patterson tries to console Vince but Vince shoves him away and gets rolled backstage. Shane and Austin then leave together as we head to commercials.\n\nOn it’s own this was a fine wrestling as soap opera segment but with the gift of hindsight this would unfortunately be the beginning of years upon years of McMahon vs. McMahon storylines that would come to dominate the entire company for better or for worse (mainly for worse).\n\nMeanwhile Backstage…\n\nBack from break, Shane McMahon goes to leave the arena but before he can Stone Cold reenacts that “Mean” Joe Greene Coca-Cola commercial and tells him, “Hey Kid, catch!” and tosses Shane a Steveweiser.\n\nMatch 4: Tiger Ali Singh (w/ Babu) vs. The Godfather\n\nTiger Ali Singh heads out with Babu for what will be the first actual match of this cat I’ve seen since starting this stupid rewatch project. That’s kind of amazing when you take into consideration the fact that the dude first got a video package announcing his imminent arrival back on the February 2, 1998 episode of Raw. He’d wrestled one televised match prior to this but it was on Shotgun Saturday Night in a battle royal and like that old zen koan asks, “If a wrestler makes his TV debut in a battle royal on an episode of Shotgun Saturday Night did a wrestler truly make his TV debut?”\n\nAnyway he’s taking on The Godfather tonight as the result of a woman deepthroating a kielbasa on last week’s show. “THE ATTITUDE ERA WAS SO MUCH BETTER THAN WRESTLING IS TODAY!”®\n\nAnyway The Godfather comes out sans sex workers. He has a mic though and as he walks towards the ring he tells Singh that he’s not going to make his usual offer tonight but is instead going to show Tiger Ali Singh that pimping ain’t easy. He then bumrushes the show and knocks Singh to the mat with a clothesline.\n\nSingh retreats to the floor and Godfather goes out after him only to get punted and then dropped onto the guardrail. The Godfather slowly heads back in but gets knocked off the apron. He recovers enough to trip Singh up and then slam his leg down into the ring apron.\n\nBack in the ring Singh recovers and stomps away on the Godfather. He follows up by working over Godfather’s arm and then connecting with a dropkick but Godfather takes back over on offense a moment later with a clothesline. He runs Singh from pillar to post and then takes off his belt and begins whipping Singh with it.\n\nSingh comes back with a bulldog and covers but only gets one. The Godfather then dumps Singh out to the floor and heads out after him. Singh hides behind Babu who Godfather ends up tossing to the floor. Godfather and Tiger Ali Singh then brawl out on the floor for a bit before heading back in.\n\nSingh takes back over on offense by poking Godfather in the eyes. The crowd is visibly bored at this point and doing the wave to amuse themselves so Singh and Godfather wisely decide to wrap things up by rolling around on the mat and punching each other. This lasts maybe 5 seconds before the referee decides that he has lost complete control of the match and calls for the bell.\n\nGodfather and Singh control to roll around on the mat until WWF officials come out and get them separated.\n\nWinner: No Contest\n\nThis fucking sucked. Neither of these dudes are all time greats in the ring and they had zero chemistry with each other. Add to that the fact that the finish was completely stupid and this was just no good. [-**]\n\nMeanwhile Backstage…\n\nMichael Cole tries to interview Vince McMahon about what happened earlier tonight, asking him how he feels about what went down. Vince doesn’t reply for a while and then asks Cole what he just asked him in a way that made him seem like he was just completely out of it and didn’t really register what Michael Cole had said as opposed to “WHAT THE HELL DID YOU JUST ASK ME?!” just in case it’s not really clear in print.\n\nMatch 5: Kaientai (w/ Yamaguchi-san) vs. The Oddities & ICP (w/ Luna Vachon & Giant Silva)\n\nKaientai are already in the ring when The Oddities and ICP head out en masse. Kaientai now all have blue and white wrestling attire that matches Taka Michinoku’s gear rather than the jorts and t-shirts they’d been rocking up to this point.\n\nGolga and Funaki start things off for their respective teams. Golga throws his weight around so Men’s Teioh comes in to try and double team the big man only to end up getting crushed in the corner along with Funaki. Taka Michinoku then heads in and the three Kaientai lads finally are able to get Golga off his feet. Dick Togo then comes in as well and all four Kai En Tai lads drop elbows on the former Earthquake.\n\nIt’s then off to Kurrgan who levels Kaientai dudes with big boots and lariats and shit for maybe all of ten seconds before tagging in Violent J. The ICP member hammers away on Funaki and Shaggy 2 Dope also gets involved dropping big legdrops and shit. They are surprisingly not terrible as they work Funaki over with double teams.\n\nThe referee keeps trying to get one of them out of the ring even though he had no problem with Kai En Tai running train on Golga earlier in the match. Violent J eventually gets annoyed by this and shoves the referee leading to the DQ victory for Kai En Tai.\n\nThe rest of the Oddities are not particularly happy with this turn of events but the Insane Clown Posse doesn’t seem to give a shit. They head up the ramp by themselves and a furious Luna Vachon runs after them and attacks Violent J on the ramp.\n\nWinners: Kaientai\n\nAnother stupid finish after like a three minute match but this honestly wasn’t that bad. ICP are a lot better in the ring than they have any right being (out of the Oddities they’re probably just behind Tenta and Luna in terms of in-ring acumen). [*½]\n\nMeanwhile Backstage…\n\nA despondent Vince McMahon gets in his limo with the stooges vowing that they’ll take care of things tonight before he leaves.\n\nElsewhere Backstage…\n\nMichael Cole is standing by with Ken Shamrock. He tries to ask Shamrock about his match against Austin but Shamrock tells him to shut up and then proceeds to cut a promo on Stone Cold. He wants Austin to listen carefully and then says, “I quit. Austin, that is the only time you will ever hear me say those words.” He talks about being the world’s most dangerous man and then wraps things up by saying it’s time to “knuckle up.”\n\nMatch 6: Marc Mero (w/ Jacqueline) vs. Goldust\n\nBoth these guys are former Intercontinental Champions which Jim Ross mentions. He does not bring up the fact that they had a blood feud earlier in the year over the valets that neither of them are currently paired up with.\n\nGoldust starts out strong taking Mero down with a clothes line at the start and then mounting him and pounding away in the corner. Goldust follows with a slingshot belly-to-back suplex and covers but only gets two.\n\nJackie then distracts the ref allowing Mero to punch him in the cock and take over on offense. Mero follows with a swinging neckbreaker and covers but Goldust manages to kick out at two. Mero chokes Goldust out in the ropes for a bit and then sends him off the ropes with an Irish whip only to telegraph the back body drop and pay for it with an uppercut to the mug.\n\nGoldust follows up with an INVERTED ATOMIC DROP and a clothesline and then hits a bulldog. He then sets Mero up in the corner for the Shattered Dreams but Jacqueline gets up on the apron to try and prevent him from kicking Mero in the cock. She slaps Goldust who responds by doing that classic good guy bit and forcibly kissing her against her will. I’m not a fan of that bit but I will say that Jackie’s sell along with the camera wildly zooming in on her as it happened was pretty hilarious.\n\nAnyway with Jackie dispatched via sexual assault, Goldust turns his attention back to Marc Mero and punts him in the dick with the Shattered Dreams to pick up the DQ loss. Goldust doesn’t really seem to care that he lost the match though.\n\nWhile Jackie is helping Mero with his destroyed cock, Sable heads out and stands on the stage to challenge her to a match for the WWF Women’s Championship at Survivor Series. Sable is so bad at cutting promos. It’s like she’s out there cold reading cue cards or something. I’d ask why she was ever popular but I know exactly why. Regardless Jackie and Mero mock her from the ring but it’s not clear if Jacqueline accepts the challenge or not.\n\nWinner: Marc Mero\n\nAnother match, another DQ finish. The stuff we got was perfectly fine TV wrestling especially for a match that very clearly only existed so Sable would have an opportunity to challenge Jackie to a title match at Survivor Series. [NR]\n\nJVC Kaboom Box Kaboom! of the Week!\n\nThis week’s Kaboom! is Jeff Jarrett hitting Al Snow in the head with a guitar and Snow selling it by laying on the mat and trembling with laughter.\n\nMeanwhile Backstage…\n\nMichael Cole is with Mankind and Al Snow who will be facing the New Age Outlaws tonight for the Tag Team Championship. Mankind puts over Snow as a great wrestler even if Head is the dumbest thing ever. Snow takes umbrage with this and asks Mankind who he is to talk since he’s out here talking to a sock. Mankind says that he knows Mr. Socko is just a sock since he painted his face himself. Will these two nutjobs be able to coexist? We’re going to find out next!\n\nMatch 7: New Age Outlaws (c) vs. Mankind & Al Snow\n\nWWF World Tag Team Championship Match\n\nThe Outlaws head out first and do their shtick much to the delight of the crowd in Madison. Mankind and Al Snow head out separately and Al is crazy over with the fans. Jim Ross informs us that Mankind will also be in the tournament at Survivor Series.\n\nSnow and Gunn start things off and Gunn quickly takes control with a gorilla press slam. He then boots Snow in the gut and Snow rolls back to his corner and tags in Mankind who enters the ring waving at Billy Gunn. Gunn seems confused by this but eventually locks up with him only to get shoved into the corner.\n\nGunn fires off with some shots and then makes the tag to Road Dogg who continues to work Mankind over with punches. He follows up with the shaky leg knee drop while Al Snow does a jig out on the apron. The action eventually spills out to the floor where Mankind turns things around.\n\nRoad Dogg gets sent back in and Mankind does some shaky leg stomps which are about as ugly as you would expect. Mankind then hits the double-arm DDT and looks to put him away with Mr. Socko but Billy Gunn comes in to break things up. Mankind then looks to use Head but Al Snow prevents him from doing so.\n\nSnow gets tagged back into the match and hammers away on Road Dogg in the corner. Billy Gunn comes in which brings in Mankind. Gunn clotheslines Mankind and himself out to the floor while back in the ring Snow plants Road Dogg with the Snow Plow and has a visible pin but the referee is dealing with Billy Gunn and Mankind.\n\nMankind gets back in the ring and wants to finish off Road Dogg with Mr. Socko but Snow wants to use Head. They argue for a bit which leads to Al Snow getting rolled up by Road Dogg while Billy Gunn pulls Mankind out to the floor.\n\nAs soon as the match ends Mark Henry and D’Lo Brown show up and beat down Road Dogg and Billy Gunn and then leave with D’Lo bellowing at the cameraman about how much ass he and Mark Henry rule.\n\nOver by the announce table Snow has Socko and Mankind has Head but after a tense moment they eventually trade their gimmicks back.\n\nWinners: The New Age Outlaws\n\nNo one seemed to be on the same page here which is a bummer since in general all these guys are perfectly capable of having good matches. I’m fine with Mark Henry and D’Lo Brown beefing with the Outlaws over the titles since there are literally no other tag teams around who are close to being credible contenders. [*½]\n\nMatch 8: Ken Shamrock vs. Stone Cold Steve Austin\n\n“I Quit” Match\n\nShamrock jumps Austin as he gets in the ring and starts pounding on him before he even takes his vest off. He sends Austin off the ropes and nails him repeatedly with knee strikes. Austin eventually fights back and gets his vest off and proceeds to choke Shamrock with it.\n\nThe Stooges come out pretty early on in the match and stand at ringside watching and cheering Shamrock on. Meanwhile in the ring, Austin works Shamrock over with shoulders in the corner but Shamrock slugs him back only to get back dropped out to the floor. Austin goes out after him and rams Shamrock into the announce table much to the dismay of Jerry Lawler. Austin then strangles Shamrock with a camera cable.\n\nShamrock mule kicks Austin in the dick to get free and then slams him onto the announce table and starts pounding on him. Shamrock then runs Austin in the ring post and then sends him over the guardrail into the crowd. Shamrock goes in after him and backdrops him onto the concrete.\n\nThey then head back over the barrier to the ringside area where Shamrock runs Austin in the ring steps and knees him in the face before dropping him onto the ramp. Austin gets sent back into the ring where Shamrock continues to dominate, stomping away on Austin before grabbing a chinlock.\n\nAustin fights out of the hold and fires back. He hits the Thesz Press and starts wailing on Shamrock. Austin looks to hit the ropes but gets tripped up by Brisco from out on the floor while Slaughter lays out the referee. Austin goes out to the floor and after the Stooges and while that is happening Mankind randomly comes out and gets Ken Shamrock in the Mandible Claw.\n\nAustin lays waste to the Stooges and then grabs a chair and heads back in. He blasts Shamrock in the face with it, knocking him out as the referee comes to. Austin then takes Shamrock’s hand and taps it onto the mat for the win.\n\nThe Stooges then hit the ring and Austin proceeds to give them all Stunners to send the crowd home happy. And that’s the show.\n\nWinner: Stone Cold Steve Austin\n\nClassic overbooked Attitude Era main event. You got a couple big names, a bunch of run-ins, a stipulation that ultimately didn’t matter, and a finish that made no sense. It’s kind of a shame since I think these two could have had a very good match without all the gaga. [**]\n\nFinal Thoughts\n\nPretty mediocre episode that I have absolutely no memory of. I think this might be the first episode since I started this project (save for those wheel spinning Saturday Night Raws) that I have absolutely no memory of. Generally when I rewatch these things there’s at least a segment or two per episode that I’m like, “Oh it’s THIS episode!” when they hit but this week? Absolutely nothing. I’m guessing that back in 1998 I just stayed on Nitro for the duration of it which might have been true for a lot of people since Nitro beat Raw this week. It would be the last time that it did."
