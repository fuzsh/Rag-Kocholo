        "text": "DAY ONE (PRE-SHOW):\n\n(Video package plays, highlighting the feud between Tarah Nova and Cleopatra)\n\nRA: The following contest is a Barbed Wire death match! The match will end by either pinfall, submission, or knockout, and has a thirty minute time limit! There are no rope breaks, no count outs, and no disqualification!\n\n(“ChiRaq” by Nicki Minaj plays as a procession of Egyptian garbed ‘priestesses’ begin to walk out, their heads bowed low. As the music continues, Cleopatra herself makes her appearance at the stage, her garb inlaid with gold and sparkling with ‘diamonds’ it appears. As she continues to walk down the entrance ramp she lets two of the bigger priests lift her up and set her onto the apron.)\n\nRA: Introducing first, from Montreal, Canada! She is the Queen of the Nile and the Empire General Manager! None other than: CLEOPATRA!!!\n\nStarr Stan: Save us from the reign of Tarah Nova Cleopatra! Only you can save us!\n\nSG1: Would you stop that?! Look, I appreciate all that Cleopatra has done for Empire, but she’s also probably one of the most…sickening and abusive general managers we have had, using her power to pull strings and generally make life a living hell for everyone. I’m not a fan of her at all, but…well…that’s how it is.\n\nStarr: Fake news, all of it. Cleopatra has been the least biased and most professional woman on our entire roster, and that’s the honest truth!\n\nSG1: Right…\n\n(“You think I’m just a doll. A doll that’s pink and light. A doll you can arrange anyway you like. You’re wrong. Very wrong. What you think of me is only a ghost of time. I am dangerous. And I will show you just how dark I can be.” rings out across the loudspeakers. As Harley Quinn’s voice fades out “Wreak Havoc” by Skylar Grey plays. Barking can be heard, followed by animalistic laughing before pyro goes off and Tarah Nova races forward, holding on a leash two spotted hyena’s. Their manes painted Green and Purple respectively.)\n\nRA: And her opponent! From Detroit, Michigan! She is the Vixen Killer! Tarah Nova!!!\n\nStarr: LET’S GO TARAH! KICK THAT DESPOT’S ASS BACK TO THE STONE AGE AND LEAD US TO GREATNESS!!!\n\nSG1: Starr…Starr…are you cheering for both sides just in case one wins so you don’t get fired?\n\nStarr: Exactly. I mean, what else would I do? Listen, this place is going to be in anarchy depending on who wins what right? Might as well make sure you are on the side of winning team no matter what.\n\nSG1: Talking about this match in particular, this match honestly benefits Tarah Nova a bit more rather than Cleopatra. Tarah is willing to do anything and everything to win this matchup, and that also means facing her own fears.\n\nStarr: That flicker of fear that showed on Tarah’s face when Cleopatra proclaimed that this would be a barbed wire death match. After her encounter with Eclipse, seemingly that’s the only thing she fears anymore. So maybe the advantage does actually go to Cleopatra.\n\n(Ding! Ding! Ding!)\n\nSG1: Well, we are about to find out. Tarah Nova glancing over at the barbed wire ropes and moving forward cautiously, hoping to not touch them. Cleopatra doing the same, trying to stay as close to the middle of the ring as possible. Cleopatra going for the right hand of Tarah but Tarah yanking her hand away, throwing a hard kick to the stomach of Cleopatra and now we have a fight! Cleopatra throwing a jaw jacking punch to Tarah’s jaw and now the slugfest happens! Forearms by Cleopatra trying to force Tarah into the barbs but Tarah throws some elbows of her own towards Cleopatra. Both girls going back and forth in these strikes and now Tarah wrapping her arm around the arm of Cleopatra! Irish whip and Cleo stops herself just short of the ropes!\n\nStarr: But here comes Tarah! Tarah running right for her but Cleopatra scouts it and dodges to the side and Tarah goes leg first into the barbed wire! Tarah’s leg caught in the wire and she’s screaming in agony right now, and now here comes Cleopatra! Cleopatra with a devastating kick to the thigh of Tarah Nova! Tarah pulling her leg from the barbs but Cleopatra is already right on top of her, throwing more strikes to push her against the barbs. Tarah shoving Cleopatra off and here she comes again but this time Tarah responds, catching her with a big boot right to the skull!\n\nSG1: Cleopatra stunned and rocking backwards but here comes Tarah again, delivering a knee to the stomach and now spinning around to deliver another boot to the top of the head! Cleopatra falling back and Tarah yanking her up to her feet by her hair, delivering a knee right into the nose of Cleopatra. And now Tarah is going all out, continuing to grab her by the hair and yank her up for another knee to the skull. And now Tarah is just drilling her with knees.\n\nStarr: And check this out! Tarah dragging Cleopatra by the hair towards the barbs and now just digging her forehead into the barbs! Tarah finally getting a modicum of revenge on Cleopatra here as she drags her forehead across the barbs and yanks her from them throwing her straight to the ground and pinning her boot right onto the throat of Cleopatra. Cleopatra writhing away from her, and finally pushing herself away from Tarah, dragging herself to the middle of the ring as Tarah Nova follows after her. Tarah wants to end Cleopatra quickly. She wants her to suffer and drown in her own blood…which is honestly how I think this match is going to go. Because I don’t see Cleopatra just laying on her back and quitting. Tarah checking her knee, noting the blood that is flowing from it right now.\n\nSG1: Yeah but that’s just giving Cleopatra time to get up, and she’s taking it. Cleopatra up to her feet and delivers a painful kick to the knee of Tarah which causes her to stumble back. Cleo following that up with a knife edge chop and forcing her into the barbs and now Cleo has Tarah where she wants her! Blood covered face and all, Cleopatra is throwing heavy strikes to the skull and body of Tarah Nova, lighting her up with these punches and finishing them off with a final kick to the chest forcing her entire back into the barbs!\n\nStarr: Cleopatra walking away from Tarah to the chorus of boos from the crowd as she primes her fist. Tarah is stuck in the barbs! No way of getting out! CLE-O!!! KNOCKOUT PUNCH BY CLEOPATRA TO TARAH NOVA’S JAW AND TARAH DROPS STRAIGHT DOWN FROM THE BARBS, HER HANDS HANGING STRAIGHT UP! GOD! TARAH MIGHT JUST BE OUT! Cleopatra just staring down at her and ordering the ref to check her. Tarah has to be unconscious for a ten count! Cleopatra may have just won this one!!!\n\nONE!\n\nTWO!\n\nTHREE!\n\nFOUR!!\n\nFIVE!!\n\nSIX!\n\nSEVEN!\n\nSG1: Wait! Wait! Tarah is starting to stir! Cleopatra’s back is turned but Tarah is pulling herself up, the barbed wire still wrapped around her arms!!! Tarah struggling up and…TEARING THE BARBED WIRE OFF OF THE TURNBUCKLES!!! JESUS!!! TARAH ACTUALLY YANKING THE ENTIRE SHEET OF BARBED WIRE WITH HER! CLEOPATRA TURNING AROUND TO LOOK AT THE SIGHT, AS TARAH IS STANDING TALL AND LOOKING DIRECTLY AT HER!!! CLEOPATRA CHARGING RIGHT FOR HER AND TARAH CATCHING HER IN THE SKULL WITH A JUMPING KNEE TO THE FOREHEAD!!! AND THE BARBED WIRE CAUGHT HER THERE AS WELL!!! TARAH NOVA JUST DRILLED CLEOPATRA DIRECTLY IN THE SKULL WITH THAT MOVE!!!\n\nStarr Stan: CLEO IS STAGGERED!!! AND TARAH HOOKING HER ARM AROUND THE THROAT OF CLEOPATRA, SPINNING HER AROUND! REVERSE DDT INCOMING MAYBE?! MAYBE?! NO!!! TARAH WITH A GTR!!! LARIAT TO THE CHEST OF CLEO WHO DROPS DIRECTLY INTO THE BARBED WIRE KNEE OF TARAH NOVA!!! HER WHOLE BODY ARCHING BACK, AND HER BLOOD JUST POOLING OUT OF HER SPINE!!! TARAH MAY HAVE JUST PUT THIS AWAY!!!\n\nSG1: Not quite yet. Not quite yet! Tarah wants to destroy her. Tarah wants her to suffer. And Tarah is going to do just that. Tarah picking up the lifeless body of Cleopatra and setting her on her shoulders! Tarah Nova signaling for the end here!! MURDER! CITY! PLUNGE!!! TARAH NOVA DRILLING CLEOPATRA’S SKULL INTO HER KNEE AND CLEOPATRA SLUMPS TO THE GROUND WITH BLOOD JUST POOLING OUT OF HER BODY! TARAH NOVA HAS ALL BUT WON THIS, AND SHE HAS DONE IT WITH AN EMPHATIC STATEMENT!!!\n\nStarr: Tarah now gingerly placing her body on top of Cleopatra, going for the cover!!\n\nOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOONNNNNNNNNNNNNNNEEEEEEEEEEEEEE!!!\n\nTWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!!!\n\nTHREEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE!!!\n\n(DING! DING! DING!)\n\nRA: Here is your winner, and the new Empire General Manager!!! TARAH!!! NOVA!!!\n\nSG1: I can’t believe it! I honestly can’t! Tarah Nova said that she would make her pay! She said that she would put her away!!! And Tarah did not lie! She did not waver! Tarah Nova did indeed do the impossible! Tarah has beaten the woman that thought herself invincible! And Tarah has done it with an emphatic statement here tonight!\n\nStarr: Tarah Nova told the world that she was going to beat Cleopatra to death, and that is what she did! She destroyed Cleopatra, and now it is undeniable what the plan is moving forward. For Tarah, whether she wins the EE or not, is going to take her place on Empire as its new General Manager! I’m Starr Stan, that’s SG1 and we will see you right back here LIVE for Pain for Pride!!!\n\n(Dia Del Diablo Ad)\n\n(Video package plays, highlighting the feud between Stuffed Crust and The High Rollerz for the EAW Unified Tag Team Championships)\n\nRing Announcer: Ladies and Gentlemen… this next TABLES, LADDERS AND CHAIRS TAG TEAM CONTEST IS FOR THE UNIFIED TAG CHAMPIONSHIPS!! THE ONLY WAY TO WIN IS TO CLIMB A LADDER AND RETRIEVE THE CHAMPIONSHIPS…\n\n(“The Boys Are Back” – Dropkick Murphy’s hits as the crowd EXPLODE as Stuffed Crust makes their way through the curtain.)\n\nRA: INTRODUCING FIRST, WEIGHING AT A COMBINED WEIGHT OF FOUR HUNDRED AND FORTY THREE POUNDS!!… THE ARE THE TEAM OF NOBI AND LIONCROSS!!… STUFFED CRUUUUUUUUUUSSSSSTTTTT!!\n\nCherish: THE FINAL MATCH IN THE STORIED CAREER OF LIONCROSS HAS FINALLY COME! WHAT A STORIED FINISH IT COULD BE AS THESE TWO MEN LOOK TO TAKE AWAY THOSE CHAMPIONSHIPS HANGING ABOVE THE RING!!\n\nPierre: They have one hell of a tall order to get past to do so. Both men look fired up and in a stipulation like this, anything and everything could happen.\n\n(Both Lioncross and Nobi enter the ring and look up at the championships above before turning their attention back up to the stage waiting for the champions to make their arrival.)\n\n(“I Get Money” – 50 Cent hits as The High Rollerz make their way through the curtain to a THUNDEROUS roar of boos.)\n\nRing Announcer: INTRODUCING THEIR OPPONENTS WEIGHING IN AT A COMBINED WEIGHT ON FOUR HUNDRED AND TWELVE POUNDS!! THEY ARE THE TEAM OF DAVID DAVIDSON AND JACK RIPLEY!!… THEY ARE THE UNIFIED TAG TEAM CHAMPIONS!!… THE HIGH ROOOOOOOLLLLLLLLLEEEEEERRRRRRZZZZZ!!\n\nPierre: HERE THEY ARE!! THE CHAMPIONS!!

ONE HICCUP THEY’VE HAD SINCE RETURNING, AND THEY TOOK THOSE CHAMPIONSHIPS BACK JUST A MERE WEEK LATER!! I’M GOING TO PUT MY MONEY ON LIONCROSS’ FINAL MATCH ENDING IN MISERY FOR THE MAN!\n\nCherish: Don’t count Stuffed Crust out before the match begins, Pierre. Pain for Pride is the event where miracles can happen.The High Rollerz look focused, but so do Stuffed Crust. This one is going to be a barnburner, I have no doubt about it!\n\n(The High Rollerz stand before the ring and take a look at the Tables, Ladders and Chairs set up around the ring, before grabbing a chair each and making their way into the ring.)\n\nCherish: THE HIGH ROLLERZ AREN’T WAITING TO GET THIS ONE STARTED!!\n\n(Ding! Ding! Ding!)\n\nCherish: BOTH DAVIDSON AND RIPLEY SWING THEIR CHAIRS WILDLY – BUT, BOTH LIONCROSS AND NOBI DUCK UNDERNEATH! RIGHT HAND FROM LIONCROSS TO RIPLEY!! A LEFT FROM NOBI TO DAVIDSON!! BOTH MEN DROP THEIR WEAPONS AS THE CHALLENGERS CONTINUE TO FIRE AWAY!! BOTH THE CHAMPIONS BACKED UP AGAINST THE ROPES — AND STUFFED CRUST SEND THEM OVER THE TOP IN UNISON WITH CLOTHESLINES!!

LIONCROSS STANDING IN THEIR WAY AS NOBI QUICKLY CLIMBS UP — BUT THE HIGH ROLLERZ GRAB LIONCROSS BY THE ANKLES AND SLIDE HIM OUT OF THE RING!! RIPLEY SENDS HIM CRASHING INTO THE BARRICADE AS DAVIDSON SLIDES BACK INTO THE RING AND RUSHES UP THE LADDER, GRABBING NOBI BY THE ANKLE BEFORE HE CAN UNHOOK THOSE CHAMPIONSHIPS!!\n\nPierre: Davidson yanking Nobi back down, but Nobi lands on his feet! Davidson with a stiff spinning back kick to the stomach, dropping Nobi down to a knee – BEFORE DAVIDSON GRABS HIM BACK THE HEAD AND DRIVES IT INTO THE LADDER!! Nobi grabbing at his head as he rolls out of the ring; Ripley driving his boot into the ribs of Lioncross as Davidson picks up a full head of steam AND FLIES OVER THE TOP ROPE WITH THE TOPE CON HILO TAKING OUT NOBI!! These men not looking to warm up in the slightest! Nobi is down; Lioncross is trying to get back to his feet, but Ripley maintains that pressure. Both High Rollerz locking eyes; they don’t need to say anything, they’re both completely on the same wavelength. Davidson rolling back into the ring and begins to climb that ladder already set up in the ring, but Nobi is already back up and clubs him in the back! But, there’s Ripley!

Nobi’s back into the ring and Lioncross instructs him to set that ladder up and start climbing. Lioncross said that he can take care of those two, and with that chair in his hand, he may just do so. Nobi grabbing that ladder and sets it up and begins to climb up high! Lioncross lifting that chair high into the air and DRIVES IT INTO THE SPINE OF JACK RIPLEY! NOBI INCHING CLOSER AS LIONCROSS DRIVES THAT CHAIR INTO THE SPINE OF RIPLEY AGAIN!!\n\nPierre: COME ON, GUYS!!

IT WAS A GALIANT FIGHT, CHERISH, BUT THE HIGH ROLLERZ ARE MOVING CLOSER TO RETAINING THEIR TITLES!!\n\nCherish: Davidson looking to grab that ladder, but Ripley cuts him off. He wants to make sure they’re going to stay down. Nobi is barely moving. Lioncross is defiantly getting back to his feet. Ripley pointing to another table to the outside as smiles cross the face of both of the High Rollerz.

Both Davidson and Ripley walk past Lioncross and wave goodbye before arrogantly making their way back up the ramp, obviously in pain. The stand on the stage and raise their titles in the air before the camera cuts elsewhere.)\n\nDAY ONE (Main Show):\n\n( EAW Intro plays )\n\n( The intro sounds of “I’ll Keep Coming” by Low Roar starts, with the original logo fluttering on the screen… the opening footage shows CM Banks – then known as CM Ronn, at a press conference with Mak and Evan, shaking hands with major execs from Yahoo!, and other well established billionaires such as John Conning, James Shields, and other members of the current EAW Board of Directors. )\n\n( We get a collage of news stories reporting the first year of EAW’s existence. )\n\nTV news host: Apparently a new show is in town in the land of the squared circle, they’re backed by major North American investors seeking to take a different approach at the resurgence of mainstream professional wrestling. This one calls themselves “Extreme Answers Wrestling.\n\nFemale TV news voice: An upstart by three professional wrestlers themselves – lead by CM Ronn! Who claims they want to offer the alternative to what the mainstream business has to offer now. This one looks like it might have potential.\n\n( The intro of “I’ll Keep Coming” continues. We see the fluttering of the AWF: EAW logo and soon see newspaper and brief press coverage on EAW closing due to internal conflicts, with AWF quickly acquiring the company and turning it into a brand. )\n\n( We see the reign of Mak as the EAW Champion with Jenny at his side in his legendary reign of complete dominance. We see CM Ronn in competition. The footage also airs the genesis of the careers of wrestling’s most influential figures who would change the course of history; such as Jaywalker, Killswitch, Master of Puppets, among others. )\n\nMale news pundit # 2: The Answers Wrestling Federation which is the leading wrestling organization in the world, currently, seems to have a new flagship show: EAW!\n\nFemale ESPN anchor: EAW yet again drawing the highest ratings of the AWF wrestling league, perhaps solidifying themselves as the premiere brand after a month long streak of dominance!\n\n( The intro of “I’ll Keep Coming” nears its end, with press coverage showing the collapse of AWF in Winter 2007, as well as the emergence of two different companies: Answers Championship Wrestling and Extreme Answers Wrestling. )\n\n“Faintly I’ll go”\n\n“To take this head on”\n\nSports Anchor: One can’t help but be pessimistic, I’m not liking EAW’s chances this time around. Could we see a repeat of before?\n\nSports co-Anchor: Given EAWs track record and ACWs dominance, I don’t see them lasting two months.\n\nThe EAW 08′ symbol flutters on the screen, and we see CM Banks at a press conference in January 2008 with EAWs mega-star acquisitions from AWF: HRDO and Mr. DEDEDE, who stand by posters of EAWs newest creations: “Showdown” and “Dynasty”. We also see a younger Jaywalker, Masters, CIC, and the rookie versions of Captain Charisma and Rated R Shaman in the background with ambitious looks on their faces.)\n\nCM Ronn (overheard): EAW will go to the top and stay there forever!

Stark grabs Rex by the head and drags him to where his top half hangs of it, walking back towards the fans in the front row, as he turns around and eyes his opponent! STARK SPRINTS IN AND BASHES REX WITH A STIFF KNEE SHOT TO FACE AS REX’S EYES MIGHT HAVE JUST GLAZED OVER FROM THAT IMPACT! Stark starts to take in the adulation of the crowd before he situates Rex back to where he was and climbs on the ring apron, looking towards straight to the fans as he starts to do his taunt for them, sprinting ahead BEFORE HE DROPS A KNEE STRAIGHT DOWN ONTO THE BACK OF HIS NECK THAT CAUSES BOTH MEN TO COLLAPSE TO THE FLOOR!\n\nPierre McGuire: Both men on down on the floor when Stark becomes the first to reach a vertical base, bending down to grab Rex McAllister by his head as he throws him back into the ring, climbing onto the ring apron as he holds onto the top rope!

Stark grabs Rex by the arm THROWING HIM CLEAR ACROSS THE RING INTO THE OPPOSITE TURNBUCKLE AS HE RU– REX EXPLODES OUT OF THE TURNBUCKLE AND STRIKES WITH A RUNNING LARIAT TO DROP HIM DOWN TO THE CANVAS! HE JUST CAME OUT OF NOWHERE WITH THAT LARIAT AND HAS TURNED THIS MATCH AROUND!\n\nPierre McGuire: Rex McAllister has taken the high ground in his match with Stark lifting himself up to his feet WHEN REX RETURNS TO DRIVE HIS SHOULDER BEHIND HIS LEFT LEG WITH THE CHOP BLOCK!

His body is in absolutely no condition to compete, so we’ve made certain he will not be here. After the assaulted he endured at the hands of Jaywalker and Ares last week, I have officially pulled him from the match.\n\nBanks: And what the Hell are we supposed to do?\n\n(Murrow shrugs before Devan grabs him by his jacket)\n\nDevan: You just don’t give a damn, do you? Since this means nothing to you, after all! You can’t just take him out of the match if he wants to compete!\n\nMurrow: I can, and I have. He’s not here, and he won’t be either. The Heart Break Boy, as far as either of you are concerned, is gone indefinitely. If you want, you can find a partner to replace hm.\n\nBanks: Where do you expect us to find somebody to replace him this late in the game? Are you an idiot?\n\nDevan: I don’t care.\n\nBanks: What?\n\nDevan: I don’t care if we find a partner. I don’t care if it’s just the two of us out there against all of them. We’re gonna win this, or I’ll die trying. I’ve been waiting a year and a half to get redemption on Ares, and I’m gonna make Jay pay for what he did to my Hall of Fame Championship, so I don’t give a damn! I’m going out there whether we have a partner or not!\n\n(Devan Dubian storms off as CM Banks looks on. Banks turns his attention to Murrow)\n\nBanks: You’re kind of a shitty GM, you know that? He’s right. We’re not done. I’ll find somebody.\n\n(Banks walks off as Damien Murrow sighs once more, going back to his desk as the camera transitions back to the stage at MetLife Stadium)\n\n(The camera focuses back on the center of the ring where Erica Ford stands wearing a sleeveless satin emerald-colored dress holding a microphone.)\n\nErica Ford: Ladies and gentlemen, the following contest at Pain for Pride X is the 24/7 Contract Battle Royal!\n\n(The crowd lets off a massive ovation forcing Erica to wait until they finish cheering. Once the stadium calms down, Erica continues to speak.)\n\nErica Ford: The bell will sound once all competitors have entered and will continue until there is only one Elitist remains. There is no time limit. There are no pinfalls, submissions or disqualifications. The only way a competitor is eliminated by being thrown over the top rope and to the arena floor. When the winner is decided, they will receive the 24/7 Contract: a contract that can be used at any time by the holder for an immediate championship opportunity within one calendar year of winning it. So…. are you ready?\n\n(The MetLife Stadium crowd rises to its feet as they cheer wildly.)\n\nErica: WITHOUT WAITING ANY LONGER, HERE THEY ARE, THE PARTICIPANTS…\n\n(Plays as pyro goes off near the entrance ramp.)\n\nStew-O: A quick survey around on a winner, guys? We’ll start with you, WWEFan….\n\nWWEFan: I’m gonna go with Sheridan Muller, she’s on a roll of late and despite any size disadvantage she may have she may be the best wrestler in this match.\n\nStew-O: Stan?\n\nStarr Stan: Anybody but Haruna or Azumi…PLEASE.\n\nWWEFan: Will you be serious? Pierre, prediction?\n\nPierre: I like Darkane here to pick up the win, a gut feeling if you will.\n\n(The camera pans over the stage once more as the first entrant makes his way down the ramp followed by the others)\n\nANTHONY LEONHART!\n\nEL IRONICO!\n\nJACOB MOORE!\n\nLETHAL CONSEQUENCES!\n\nMEGAN RAINE!\n\nSAIKO HOTARU!\n\nARETE SILVERLANCE!\n\n(Ryan Savage steps onto the stage to a huge pop, holding his arms in the air…)\n\nRYAN SAVAGE!\n\nP. O…P…. THE PRINCE OF PHENOMINAL!\n\nSHAKER JONES!\n\nCHRIS BRADSHAW!\n\nRYAN LECAVLIER!\n\nStarr Stan: The prettiest Ryan in EAW.\n\nWWEFan: Can’t disagree with ya there….\n\nKHASMIN!\n\nTHEODORE HILFIGER!\n\nMARK MICHAELS!\n\n(The crowd starts cheering loudly out of respect as Sheridan Mueller makes her way to the ring with a focused stare.)\n\nSHERIDAN MULLER!\n\nSIR KILLIAN CHARLEMAGNE!\n\nKIMI HENDRIX!\n\nTHERON NIKOLAS!\n\nCARSON RAMSAY!\n\nHARVEY YORKE!\n\nDARKANE!\n\nTIG KELLY!\n\nLAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA DIVA!\n\n(After cheering for La Diva as she makes her way down, the crowd immediately starts to heavily boo an American flag-waving Cody Marshall.)\n\nCODY MARSHALL!\n\nKAISE BOETIUS!\n\n(Haruna and Azumi Goto come out together, seemingly having a disagreement as they go down to the ring arguing.)\n\nHARUNA SAKAZAKI!\n\nTHE CONTROL IN THE VAULT HOLDER, AZUMI GOTO!\n\nMARCO FEDOR!\n\nSCOTT DIAMOND!\n\nJOHNNY NOVA!\n\n(Erica is motioned quickly towards a group of officials, one of them getting word via headset about something.)\n\nWWEFan: What’s going on?\n\nStarr Stan: Not sure. There seems to be a hold up in the back….\n\nPierre: We’re getting word that there is a commotion backstage, we’re rushing to get a camera back there now!\n\n(The camera pans over the ring full of competitors waiting for the match to begin. Seconds later, the picture moves to the backstage area. Jon McAdams and Mike Showman are assaulting ONI, slamming his head against a steel beam, busting him open and leaving him unconscious before backstage agents rush them away.)\n\nStarr Stan: Well there’s one soldier who ain’t gonna make it home!\n\nStew-O: It was a cowardly assault but an effective one! Our thirty-four-elitist battle royal is down to thirty-three. Oni is being tended to and it’s not looking too good for him competing tonight I must say.\n\nWWEFan: These two call themselves the People with Class and frankly this doesn’t display much class.\n\nStarr Stan: Well it is smart, though. Why go it alone if you are already partners who can be an effective pairing against the rest of the field.\n\n(Jon McAdams and Mike Showman make their way down to the ring to a chorus of boos, joining the already full ring of people as Erica raises the microphone to speak.)\n\nErica: Ladies and Gentlemen, it appears that ONI has been injured and will not be able to compete.\n\n(The boos get even louder before the lead official, after conferring with the other referees, rings the bell)\n\nDING DING DING!!!\n\nWWEFan: AND HERE…. WE GO! The most massive battle royal in Pain for Pride’s history is underway with representatives from all four brands slugging it out. Scott Diamond…he’s already got Sheridan Muller in his sights as he goes charging in with a running big boot! Sheridan moves out of the way and Diamond crotches himself in the ropes….AND SHERIDAN KNOCKS HIM OUT OF THE RING WITH AN ELBOW STRIKE RIGHT TO THE FACE!\n\nStarr Stan: WHAT!? WHAT!?\n\nPierre: I CAN’T BELIEVE WHAT I HAVE JUST SEEN! SHERIDAN MULLER JUST ELMINATED ONE OF THE MOST DECORATED PARTICIPANTS IN THIS MATCH! A FORMER WORLD CHAMPION!\n\nErica Ford: Scott Diamond is ELIMINATED!\n\n(The fans cheer insanely loud as Diamond stands on his feet, eyes wide in absolute shock before snapping into a fit of rage, trying to get back into the ring, pushing and shoving referees as he is escorted away.)\n\nScott Diamond: I WASN’T READY! I WASN’T READY! DAMN IT! GET OUT OF MY WAY YOU DICKHEADS!\n\nStew-O: I have never seen anything quite like this!\n\n(The replay on a split-screen shows Diamond looking to score with a big boot, missing and being eliminated.)\n\nWWEFan: We can’t mourn forever though as the action begins to pick up inside the ring! Kaise Boetius and Johnny Nova trading punches! Shaker Jones and Harvey Yorke are laying into each other on one side. Saiko Hotaru, the smallest competitor in the match by quite a bit, is trying to fend off the attack of La Diva! La Diva has her on the ropes, trying to push her over, but Hotaru smashes a foot right to La Diva’s nose!\n\nPierre: Showman and McAdams continue their rampage, they immediately have Chris Bradshaw up on the turnbuckle, struggling to get him out! Bradshaw fighting for his life but he’s up, over and out to the floor, he’s done!\n\nErica Ford: Chris Bradshaw is Eliminated.\n\nStew-O: I know that neither of us picked him, but we all assumed Scott Diamond was going to go much further in this contest than he did and many considered him a favorite to win this match. Now that he’s out, who do you keep an eye on here?\n\nStarr Stan: Sheridan obviously! She’s already taken one of the big dogs out and you notice that nobody has anything in mind for her. All the participants are keeping their distance and Sher is just standing there, waiting for someone to dare take the fight her and Shaker Jones does…. he whiffs on a LARIAT……GERMAN SUPLEX!\n\nWWEFan: SHERPLEX CITY! GERMAN EFFICENCY ON FULL DISPLAY IN THE EARLY GOING!\n\nPierre: Meanwhile over there in the far corner you see Lethal Consequences laying into Mike Showman with some hard chops to the chest but Jon Adams is there to rake the eyes and ward him off. The People with Class working collectively here in the early going.\n\nStew-O: Over there in the corner! Haruna and Azumi have someone going out over the top rope…. it’s Ryan Lecavlier! She’s been eliminated by the Power Couple from Empire!\n\nErica Ford: Ryan Lecavlier has been eliminated!\n\n(Ryan slaps her hands down on the apron in frustration as Haruna and Azumi share a hug in the ring.)\n\nStarr Stan: I don’t know if I can take these two for a whole battle royal.\n\nPierre: But you’re used to it! You see them all the time on Empire.\n\nStarr Stan: Wrestling again is sounding better by the day….\n\nWWEFan: Focus here, guys! We’ve got Johnny Nova and Kaise Boetius still battling in the center of the ring! Kaise tries a high kick but Nova catches the leg, pulls him in and delivers a devastating spinning spinebuster! Haruna and Azumi have picked out their next target as they decide to double team another Empire elitist, the young Kimi Hendrix!\n\nPierre: Anthony Leonhart is working over Sir Killian Charlemagne in the corner with a vicious choke hold…. Killian manages to get a thumb to the eye and then scores a vicious European uppercut! Prince of Phenomenal showing a little fire here in this match suddenly attacking everything in sight! Running high knee to Mike Showman! A spinning back fist to Sheridan, stunning the German! Then a missed clothesline by Harvey Yorke…PELE KICK! THE PHENOMINAL PRINCE KICKING SOME MAJOR LEAGUE ASS RIGHT NOW!\n\nStew-O: WATCH OUT WATCHOUT! KAISE BOETIUS FROM BEHIND WITH A RUNNING KICK RIGHT TO THE BACK, STUNNING POP AS HE WAS TRYING TO GET UP FROM THAT PELE KICK…KAISE GRABS POP BY THE NECK AND NOW HE’S GONE!\n\nErica Ford: The Prince of Phenomenal has been eliminated!\n\nPierre: Wow. That is two former Answers World Champions eliminated now!\n\nWWEFan: And only one remains now as Lethal Consequences is in bad shape, trying to get out of the grips of Jon McAdams and Mike Showman, they have him teetering on the verge of elimination here on the ropes, but Theron Nikolas, a man we hadn’t seen much of tonight, comes in and pulls at Mike Showman’s EYES from behind with fingers!\n\nStarr Stan: AND LOOK AT THIS…La Diva is challenging Sheridan Muller to battle! I don’t think this is smart…\n\nPierre: I’m not sure anyone would mistake La Diva for a MENSA member, but she’s in the face of Sheridan who is just standing there stoically until La Diva tries an elbow strike…Sheridan counters with an elbow strike of her own to that same elbow! La Diva recoils in pain but Sher doesn’t relent, kick to the midsection…. Sheridan picks her up…. She’s looking towards Haruna, Azumi and Kimi Hendrix, who the married couple are trying to eliminate…. SHERIDAN THROWS LA DIVA TOWARDS THE THREE OF THEM FROM A POWER BOMB POSITION! DIVA CRASHES INTO KIMI AND BOTH TUMBLE OVER THE TOP ROPE AND TO THE ARENA FLOOR!\n\nStarr Stan: WOW.\n\nStew-O: I have seen it….and I STILL CAN’T BELIEVE IT!\n\nErica Ford: Both La Diva and Kimi Hendrix have been ELMINATED!\n\nWWEFan: That’s definitely going in the highlight montage! We’re down to 28 people now as-\n\nStarr Stan: 27, Fan. ONI is not here now and from the way the People with Class left him bloodied it doesn’t look like we’re going to be seeing him tonight.\n\nPierre: The action fast and furious though as Cody Marshall has both Kaise Boetius and Carson Ramsay, another great champion involved in this match, in a choke hold, one hand for each arm…Dakane and Carson look at each other…. DOUBLE KICK TO THE GROIN…DOUBLE DDT! They get up and celebrate a little bit, the crowd roaring in approval but they are attacked from behind! McAdams and Showman at it again as Showman knocks over Kaise and McAdams dumps Ramsay up over and out! CARSON RAMSAY IS OUT!\n\nErica Ford: Carson Ramsay is eliminated!\n\nWWEFan: This is astonishing. We’ve already seen some highly decorated, well-respected veterans like Carson Ramsay, POP! This field is wide open right now and anyone can come up and take it!\n\nStarr Stan: What about Lethal Consequences? Former World Champion on multiple occasions, back in the fray for his chance to return to previous glory! He’s not backing down from a fight! And Cody Marshall is trying to eliminate Darkane now, Darkane’s arms wrapped around the ropes, his body in an extremely dangerous position!\n\n(Suddenly “She Looks Good” (Angry Kids Remix) By Jim Johnson plays and the picture switches to just behind an emerging figure walking to the entrance way with long legs taking a confident, model-like stride. Amy-Jayne emerges onto the stage holding a microphone to a chorus of boos as the action in the ring for the most part stops, everyone turning to see what’s going on. Anthony Leonhart smiles and points towards the stage.)\n\nStarr Stan: We are in the presence of the IT Girl from Baton Rouge, the lovely and talented Amy-Jayne!\n\nWWEFan: For those of you not familiar, she’s a competitor on Empire. Very talented and with a great upside but why is she out here in the middle of this battle royal!?\n\nAmy-Jayne: Good evening, little people! It’s a pleasure to be here in America’s Used Enema, East Rutherford, New Jersey!\n\n(The crowd boos a bit as the camera pans over the confused expressions of the battle royal participants, Haruna and Azumi sharing a word with each other.)\n\nHaruna: She…. work here?\n\nAzumi: (Shrugs)\n\nAmy-Jayne: Now, I know you all see the wonderful muscles of my lovely beau and tag team partner, Anthony Leonhart in the ring!\n\n(Anthony blows a kiss to Amy as the crowd continues to boo heavily.)\n\nAmy-Jayne: I saw what happened to that ONI guy. It’s unfortunate. Howevah, since he is unable to compete, I guess I can fill his spot. Maybe I can show Sheridan there how to pick out better clothing. Basic black, it’s not really you, shug. Oh! It’s the married couple……and I’m not talking about the People with Class.\n\n(The crowd laughs a bit as McAdams scoffs a bit, Showman much more furious, holds the ropes demanding for her to come into the ring.)\n\nAmy-Jayne: Relax, my baby…. I’m talking about Haruna and Azumi. Don’t you already have a floating contract thing amajigger, Azumi? And Haruna, how many times are we going to see you get your ass beat in a title match, huh? I mean…. I see a lot of old guys like Lethal Consequences, nobodies like Kaise , guys who can’t hold a candle to my partner in sexy, Anthony……what?!\n\n(The crowd cheers as several members of security come to the stage, surrounding Amy-Jayne.)\n\nAmy-Jayne: WHAT IS THIS ABOUT!? CAN’T YALL SEE IM TALKING!?\n\nOfficer: Commissioner HRDO sent a message and requested that you be removed not only from the stage, but from the building. Your presence is considered an unnecessary disruption and you are not in this match. Please…this way.\n\n(A furious Anthony Leonhart is screaming at the top of his lungs for them to let Amy go, but she is escorted from the stage area, microphone still in hand.)\n\nAmy-Jayne: YOU CAN’T DO THIS TO THE IT GIRL! LET ME BACK OUT THERE!\n\nWWEFan: Well that was ……unique.\n\nStew-O: Looks like she was trying to get involved in the Battle Royal but our Chairman Said no.\n\n(Anthony turns around, still seething, pointing to random Elitists in the ring, shouting at them before shoving Sheridan and then Cody Marshall, Marshall responds with an uppercut and the resulting melee restarts the battle royal)\n\nPierre: After that self-advertisement from Amy-Jayne, we are back to the action in the ring as Sheridan, Lethal Consequences, Cody Marshall and others are all ganging up on Anthony Leonhart in the corner! His girlfriend’s mouth wrote checks that his ass will have to cash! But he’s holding his own! Headbutt sends Sheridan flying! A hard right hand takes down Cody Marshall! Darkane is taken down with a right elbow shot to the face! Haruna and Azumi of all people come at him and try to attack him and they get him in position for a vertical suplex….IT DOESN’T WORK, THEY GO UP AND DOWN AS ANTHONY SHOWS OFF HIS STRENGTH WITH A DOUBLE VERTICAL SUPLEX!\n\nStarr Stan: That kid is a Hoss. He’s having his way……WAIT A SECOND!\n\nWWEFan: DARKANE FROM BEHIND WITH A STEEL CHAIR RIGHT TO THE BACK! THAT SENT HIM RIGHT TO HIS KNEES! HOW DID HE GET THAT IN THERE!\n\nPierre: He slid out of the ring while everyone was distracted by Amy-Jayne a few moments ago and now he’s wearing out the back of Anthony Leonhart with vicious chair shots…. El Ironico tries to intervene and gets taken out with a chair shot straight to the head! MY GOD! Theron Nikolas feasting on the scraps, tossing a lifeless man over the top rope and to the floor!\n\nErica Ford: El Ironico has been eliminated!\n\nStew-O: Darkane laying waste to anything within chair’s length! A strike to the back of Kaise Boetius! A shot to the head of Marco Fedor……and….it appears that some of his “followers” are jumping over the barricade and pulling the White Wolf to safety on the outside! Darkane swinging wildly barely misses taking off the head of Jacob Moore, who wisely slides out to the floor as well!\n\nStarr Stan: Looks like we have a chairman in case HRDO gets his clock cleaned by Eclipse.\n\nWWEFan: Really, man?\n\nPierre: What is Saiko Hotaru doing? She’s sliding out of the ring and digging underneath the ring apron…. she’s pulling out a pair of wooden tonfa? What on earth!?\n\nStarr Stan: WHY DOES EVERY ASIAN GIRL ON EMPIRE HAVE TO BE A NUTJOB OR LIKE TO USE WEAPONS!? CAN’T PEOPLE JUST WRESTLE ANYMORE!?\n\nPierre: Darkane has his back turned, looking for people to swing at with his chair but nothing but a sea of laid out Elitists is greeting him! He turns around and Hotaru strikes him with a quick pair of body blows with her tonfa, taking him down! Anthony tries to do something and he gets a shot right to the GROIN!\n\nWWEFan: Amy-Jayne is not going to be pleased with that!\n\nStew-O: Leonhart, for obvious reasons, is on the ground and Saiko is standing tall in the ring, but JON MCADAMS AND MIKE SHOWMAN AGAIN WITH A DOUBLETEAM! THIS TIME A PAIR OF AXEHANDLE BLOWS FROM BEHIND! SHE’S BARELY HALF YOUR SIZE, GUYS! COME ON! AND THE TWO OF THEM TEAM UP TO TOSS HOTARU OUT!\n\nErica Ford: Saiko Hotaru has been eliminated.\n\nStarr Stan: Another Empire representative gone….\n\nWWEFan: 24 people remain here in this 24/7….\n\n(“Breakdown” by Lady of Rage plays as La Diva returns to the stage with her signature glowing shoes, dancing on the stage before taking a huge sprint and sliding about halfway down the stage as the crowd cheers her on.)\n\nWWEFan: Uhh?\n\nPierre: It’s time to FEEL LA GLOW apparently as La Diva returns to this match that she’s already eliminated from! What is she doing!? She’s going down and grabbing a ladder from underneath the ring. This is the second time in the match that we have had the entire ring stop and stare at someone from Empire. Stan, what on earth goes on over there?\n\nStew-O: I thought I saw weird every week…..\n\n(La Diva sets up “La Ladder” in the ring, climbing it as everyone else looks around in confusion.)\n\nMegan Raine: WHAT THE HELL ARE YOU DOING!?\n\nLa Diva: Where’s the briefcase!? Isn’t this Cash in the Vault Contract ladder match at Pain for Pride PPV 10!?\n\nMegan Raine: No….this is the same match that you got eliminated from.\n\nLa Diva: Oh……\n\nPierre: Wait a second..DARKANE IS TIPPING THE LADDER OVER! LA DIVA CRASHES TO THE ARENA FLOOR FROM NEAR THE TOP OF THE LADDER! WHAT THE HELL!?\n\nWWEFan: Well she did already get eliminated. She had no business in the ring.\n\nStew-O: Wait! Anthony Leonhart picks up the ladder, left behind by La Diva and is using it as a weapon, hammering people left and right with it. Mike Showman, Shaker Jones! Even takes a swing at Ryan Savage! He’s crushing everyone! He swings at Darkane and misses…and Darkane takes him down with a vicious chop block and Anthony’s own head bounces off of one of the rungs! MY GOD!\n\nPierre: Meanwhile, Haruna and Azumi are working together again, this time to throw out Arete Silverlance! Both of her feet touch the floor and she lands standing up, but the refs are telling her she’s outta here!\n\nErica Ford: Arete Silverlance has been eliminated!\n\nPierre: The field continues to whittle down here in Metlife Stadium as Marco Fedor is back in the ring and immediately gets taken down with a Superman punch from Ryan Savage! The former champion is asserting himself in this match, trying to work his way back into title contention…..SPEAR TAKES DOWN TIG KELLY! Savage is running wild here but Darkane is up and takes him down with a DDT RIGHT ONTO THAT SAME STEEL CHAIR HE WAS USING EARLIER!\n\nStew-O: And now Kaise Boetius, Lethal Consequences and Johnny Nova are all triple teaming Savage trying to take him out, but Theron Nikolas and Anthony Leonhart join in the battle and now we have a six man melee in the middle of the ring!\n\nWWEFan: Sheridan Muller is in trouble on the ropes via Cody Marshall, who is trying to throw her out….Sherridan is so close to elimination but she manages to break free, CODY MARSHALL GOES OVER THE TOP AND HE’S ON THE APRON! HE’S HANGING ON TO THE ROPES TRYING TO KEEP HIMSELF IN BUT SHERIDAN IS ON THE ATTACK, MARSHALL USES ONE HAND TO PUSH THE MUCH SMALLER MULLER AWAY EFFORTLESSLY AND SCRAMBLES BACK INTO THE RING!\n\nStarr Stan: Azumi and Haruna from behind, attacking Sheridan, trying to beat her up some more! But Megan Raine comes forward to even the odds….THERON NIKOLAS COMES IN FROM BEHIND AND USHERS HER OVER THE TOP ROPE AND TO THE FLOOR!\n\nErica Ford: Megan Raine is Eliminated!\n\nStew-O: Another elimination for Nikolas, who has been picking off people and picking his spots, fighting a very intelligent battle royal so far…..Oh My God.\n\nWWEFan: NO WAY…NO DAMN WAY!\n\n(An obviously injured but smiling ONI staggers to the stage, a smile on his face as he makes his way to the ring, a still bloody bandage over his head and a chain wrapped around his arm.)\n\nPierre: One of the most dangerous people in EAW is walking down to the ring and Jon McAdams and Mike Showman are prepared for battle! They tried to take this man out and now they’re going to have to pay the piper! Oni slides into the ring as Showman charges forward….ONI IMMEDIATELY CLOTHESLINES HIM WITH THE STEEL CHAIN! MCADAMS COMES IN FOR THE SUPER KICK AND MISSES, ONI TAKES HIM DOWN WITH A HEADBUTT!\n\n(The contact sends McAdams down and the camera zooms in on Oni’s bleeding face as blood starts to trickle down his forehead, the smile still there.)\n\nStarr Stan: And now ONI turning his attention to the other participants in the match….SHAKER JOKES CLOTHESLINED OUT AND TO THE FLOOR, RIGHT AT THE FEET OF FEDOR, WHO IS STILL RECOVERING ON THE OUTSIDE!\n\nErica Ford: Shaker Jones has been eliminiated!\n\nWWEFan: He’s not done, boys! He takes out Harvey Yorke with a sensational Busaiku running knee strike! He’s gone as well!\n\nErica Ford: Harvey Yorke is eliminated!\n\nPierre: The rampage of this monster, this Atrocity continues as Sheridan tries to assert herself and she gets taken down with a hiptoss. ONI turns around into a charging Sir Kilian Charlemagne…ONI BACKBODY DROPS HIM OUT TO THE ARENA FLOOR! OH MY GOD!\n\nErica Ford: Sir Killian Charlemagne has been eliminated!\n\nStew-O: Tig Kelly and Khamsin are trying to intervene now and stomp away at this house of fire now, they manage to get the chain off of him and Kelly takes him down with a snap suplex…but ONI SITS RIGHT UP AND THE TWO OF THEM FREEZE IN THEIR TRACKS! ONI is getting back up but Showman is now attacking him from behind! Showman in a frenzy tries to send him over and does, but ONI lands on the apron!\n\nStarr Stan: And Tig and Khamsin try to take HIM OUT! Sending him over the ropes as Jon McAdams comes over to try to make the save! Showman is on his feet on the apron, as is ONI! Showman tries a super kick but ONI, even with the limited space, avoids it. ONI PUTS SHOWMAN ON HIS SHOULDERS…….DEATH VALLEY DRIVER ON THE APRON! OH MY GOD! SHOWMAN IS OUT AS HE FALLS THE FLOOR A CRUMPLED HEAP!\n\nErica Ford: Mike Showman has been eliminated!\n\nWWEFan: Erica Ford getting busier with ONI here in this match! He has arrived and made a huge impact! He’s got to get back into the ring and he does, the crowd cheering on this monster of a human being! I don’t think I’ve ever seen anything quite like what we’ve seen here in this battle royal!\n\nStew-O: That elimination got us down to 19 participants as the ring is starting to get a lot less full. We have heavy favorites, dark horses and long shots. Former champions and rookies! Marco Fedor goes straight after ONI, these two have had their battles in the past as members of the Sanatorium and Wolvesden, the fight continuing here! Hard rights and lefts from both men, slugging it out in the center of the ring. FEDOR getting the better of the exchange, rocking a seemingly exhausted ONI! BUT JUST AS FEDOR GAINS THE ADVANTAGE, THERON SWOOPS IN AND THROWS HIM OVER THE TOP ROPE!\n\nPierre: He grabs that top rope, catching himself on the apron! Incredible display of agility and improvisation…..but lookout….TIG KELLY WITH A SPRINGBOARD DROPKICK SENDS HIM FLYING AMONGST HIS FOLLOWERS, BOTH FEET TOUCHING THE FLOOR!\n\nErica Ford: Marco Fedor has been Eliminated!\n\nStew-O: Tig Kelly gets a nice elimination of the night with an assist from Theron Nikolas! The action continues in the ring as Cody Marshall and Anthony Leonhart hook up in the ring, doing battle like two giant battling bulls! Leonhart is getting the better of it and is trying to eliminate him but Cody responds with a thumb to the eye, managing to stay alive for now!\n\nWWEFan: This has been some crazy fight and we’re still not even halfway through! Eighteen of our starting thirty four remain and the action is still just as intense. Khamsin and Jacob Moore are doubleteaming Ryan Savage though, trying to get him over the ropes….double team clothesline sends him reeling but he’s still alive…They go for another and this time Savage ducks underneath, Savage from behind slips between the two, picking up a leg of each man and dumping them both over and out to the floor! An incredible show of strength by Savage!\n\nErica Ford: Both Khamsin and Jacob Moore are Eliminated!\n\nStarr Stan: Great display of strength by SAVAGE! Kaise Boëtius FROM BEHIND, CLOTHELINES SAVAGE OUT AND HE’S ELMINATED AS WELL, TO THE DISBELIEF OF THE CROWD!\n\n(Ryan Savage has to be restrained as he tries to rush back into the ring after Kaise who waves goodbye with a smirk.)\n\nErica Ford: Ryan Savage has been eliminated!\n\nPierre: And isn’t that a shocker, gentlemen? The man returning to Dynasty to try and seize an opportunity at greatness denied. Meanwhile, Haruna and Azumi have now singled out Sheridan Muller for assault, clubbing her with elbows and knees in a corner as Sheridan tries to cover up! They have been Harassing that woman for a while!\n\nWWEFan: Tig Kelly is attacking Mark Michaels in the corner trying to lift him out…DARKANE COMES CHARGING OUT OF NOWHERE WITH A RUNNING KNEE THAT DESTROYS TIG AND SENDS MICHAELS OUT!\n\nErica Ford: Mark Michaels has been eliminated!\n\nStarr Stan: Look at this! Lethal Consequences and Johnny Nova working as a unit, attacking Anthony Leonhart and Tig Kelly! Theodore Hilfiger comes into the fray to help Eliminate Tig Kelly…they dump him out to the apron but he survives. BUT NOT FOR LONG! A SUPER KICK FROM KAISE BOETIUS SENDS THE FORMER NATIONAL ELITE CHAMPION CRASHING TO THE ARENA FLOOR!\n\nErica Ford: Tig Kelly is eliminated!\n\nStew-O: We are getting down to some real serious business, boys! Just the lucky thirteen left! Sheridan is still here! Theron Nikolas, Cody Marshall….and look at this! Lethal Consequences and Johhny Nova are swarming over Theodore Hilfiger! The two of them work together and get him into the ropes!\n\nStarr Stan: Look at this though, Azumi and Haruna have Sheridan in a similar situation! Darkane makes the save there, taking down Haruna with a leg sweep! That enables Sheridan enough to get free, driving her boot right into Azumi’s chest! Darkane being a good Samaritan and all but he better hope that move doesn’t come back to haunt him!\n\nWWEFan: Meanwhile, Cody Marshall and Anthony Leonhart are still locked into a wild battle. Leonhart and him tie up but then break up. Anthony’s gesturing to his chin? Does he want Marshall to attack? He does…..MARSHALL WITH A FOREARM SHOT! I swear I saw a tooth fly out of Anthony’s mouth! But he is unfazed and responds with a vicious strike of his own! And now Marshall! And Anthony! And Marshall! AND ANTHONY! MARSHALL! ANTHONY! MARSHALL! ANTHONY! MARSHALL! ANTHONY! MARSHALL!\n\n(The crowd cheers as the two men continue to hammer away at each other, both landing forearms to the face in succession, neither man falling down.)\n\nPierre: What’s a battle royal without some strong style action going on! The two of them are exchanging blows, toe to toe, face to face! Neither man backing down! MARSHALL LANDS A PAIR OF THEM! HE’S DARING MARSHALL TO RESPOND! MARSHALL DOES RESPOND WITH A VICIOUS FOREARM OF HIS OWN! AND THEN A SLAP TO THE FACE! ANTHONY LANDS ANOTHER SHOT RIGHT TO THE FACE….CODY GOES FOR ONE BUT ANTHONY BLOCKS IT….SLAP TO THE FACE….BIG TIME LARIAT THAT SENDS MARSHALL DOWN TO THE CANVAS!\n\nStew-O: Uh-oh, watch out! Kaise Boetius and Jon McAdams grab Anthony by the tights and are trying to force him over the top rope and out! Theodore Hilfiger comes to help out and together all of them take out Anthony Leonhart! He’s been eliminated!\n\nErica Ford: Anthony Leonhart has been eliminated!\n\nWWEFan: ONI WITH ANOTHER KNEE STRIKE SENDS HILFIGER OUT AS MCADAMS AND KAISE GET OUT OF THE WAY! ANOTHER ELIMINATION!\n\nErica Ford: Theodore Hilfiger is elmimnated!\n\nPierre: Look here now, Cody Marshall has Kaise Boetius in a precarious position in one corner…..but he manages evade the attack and now it’s Kaise landing a lot of vicious, shoot kicks right to the chest and midsection of Marshall! He’s taking a beating right now! Theron tries to attack from behind but Lethal takes him down with a brilliant jumping roundhouse kick right to the chest! Darkane from behind though on the attack as Cody pulls him in by the arms, holding his ribs exposed as Darkane rams that damn steel chair of his right into the abdomen of Darkane!\n\nWWEFan: Sheridan locks in a sleeper hold on the former World Champion Lethal Consequences, jumping on his back in attempt to put him to sleep! Lethal is struggling, he’s losing breath and bloodflow and he’s taking a knee! He could be on his way out!\n\nStarr Stan: I don’t like this strategy though! Sheridan doesn’t have the power to just pick up Lethal Consequences and drag him to the elimination if-\n\nPierre: I’m not going to doubt that young lady’s ability after watching her lift another human being and throw her like a shotput into another human being. I’m not putting anything past her.\n\nStew-O: Doesn’t look like we’re going to have to worry about it though because Lethal Consequences manages to drive her back into the corner breaking the hold. Sheridan, fatigued and reeling, walks right into an Acid Reign diamond cutter! What a maneuver!\n\nWWEFan: Johnny Nova is getting hit in the corner with some shoot kicks from Darkane and he gets hit with a vicious one that sends him doubling over, Darkane picks him up….He’s going for a tombstone!? NO! Nova overpowers him and takes him over into a tombstone position! Darkane is trying to escape but Nova transitions into a fireman’s Carry! Benadryller! And now Darkane is in trouble…..he’s fallen to the canvas but is picked up by Haruna and Azumi, two women trying to set themselves up as winners! Azumi lands a vicious kick right to Darkane’s face! Haruna follows up with palm thrusts to the body! Cody Marshall trying to eliminate Oni as Haruna and Azumi prepare to try to take out Darkane……Cody gets sent reeling into Haruna who bumps into Azumi, taking her down!\n\nStarr-Stan: Azumi gets up and turns her attention to Haruna, giving her spouse a shove as she gets up?\n\nAzumi: OI! WATCH WHERE YOU’RE GOING!\n\nHaruna: Tranquilo, Azumi. I got bumped into by-\n\n(Azumi pushes her again as the crowd stars to cheer a bit.)\n\nAzumi: You watch yourself….I don’t care who bumped into you. You don’t TOUCH me when we’re in a wrestling ring!\n\n(Haruna, getting a bit frustrated pushes back as the two square off face to face.)\n\nPierre: This is a bit surreal! Two women who have recently married square off in the ring, staring each other down, each one poised for combat…SHERIDAN FROM BEHIND ON HARUNA…REVERSE EXPLODER SUPLEX! AZUMI RUSHES IN…..EXPLODER SUPLEX RIGHT INTO THE TURNBUCKLES FOR AZUMI! Lethal Consequences behind Sheridan as she gets up to her feet….he misses on the Acid Reign this time as Sheridan makes him pay….GERMAN SUPLEX! Lethal Consequences trying to scramble to get to his feet but gets cut off by Theron ad gets thrown out! Lethal holds onto the ropes….but a SHOULDER BLOCK BY KAISE BOETIUS SENDS OUT THE FORMER WORLD CHAMP!\n\nErica Ford: Lethal Consequences has been eliminated!\n\nWWEFan: We’re down to 10, guys! Who is going to walk away with the contract and an opportunity of a lifetime!? Cody Marshall just made Kaise Boetius do a 360 flip with a running big boot! He takes down Sheridan with the same! And another one to ONI THAT SENDS HIM OVER THE ROPES! ONI IS ON THE VERGE OF ELIMINATION BUT EVERYONE IS BEING TAKEN DOWN WITH RUNNING BIG BOOTS! SHERIDAN! AZUMI! JOHNNY! MCADAMS! DARKANE!\n\nStarr Stan: Look at this though, ONI manages to skin the cat and pull himself back into the ring, Marshall looking for a discus clothesline…ONI ducks under it….ONI rises….AND SLAPS THE TASTE RIGHT OUT OF MARSHALL’S MOUTH!\n\nStew-O: I’m not sure that’s the wisest decision ONI has made as Cody is trying to track him down….but look at this! DARKANE! KAISE BOETIUS! JOHNNY NOVA! EVERYONE STILL IN THE MATCH IS HELPING ONI GET RID OF CODY MARSHALL INSTEAD! CODY MARSHALL IS OVER THE ROPES! CODY MARSHALL IS PUSHED TO THE FLOOR! CODY MARSHALL IS GONE!\n\nErica Ford: Cody Marshall has been Eliminated!\n\nPierre: We are down to 9 here in this match as 24 have gone by the wayside. Azumi, Haruna, Sheridan, ONI, Johnny Nova, Jon McAdams, Theron Nikolas, Kaise, and Darkane! One of them will be leaving here with a life and career-changing opportunity! It’s a chance to guarantee you’ll be millionaire overnight! Kaise is trying to battle with ONI, slugging it out!\n\nWWEFan: This has to be the part of the match where those who are so accustomed to brawling and slugging it out have a distinct advantage over technical wrestlers. Pinfalls and submissions don’t count! Kaise getting the better of the exchange….or SO WE THOUGHT UNTIL ONI RESPONDS WITH ANOTHER VICIOUS HEADBUTT….Kaise turns right around into a doubleteam SUPERKIIIIIIIICK COURTESY OF Darkane and Johnny! ONI finishes him off with a clothesline sending him up over and out!\n\nErica Ford: Kaise Boëtius has been eliminated!\n\nStarr Stan: JON MCADAMS! HE FINALLY CAUGHT ONI BY SURPRISE, ELMINATING HIM! ONI IS OUT AND AS HE GETS UP TO HIS FEET HE REALIZES IT’S OVER!\n\nErica Ford: ONI has been eliminated!\n\nStew-O: The numbers are getting thin here! Jon not wasting a second of his opportunity to gloat about eliminating ONI, the young man screaming in his loudest voice! He is screaming at the top of his lungs for ONI to leave but ONI is just casually walking around ringside!\n\nJon McAdams: YOU, ARE YOU DEAF! ITS TIME FOR YOU TO LEAVE! ITS TIME FOR YOU TO…OHHHH!\n\n(The crowd erupts as ONI spits his dreaded black mist into the eyes of Jon McAdams, leaving him a blind, confused mess as ONI makes his way to the back after picking up his chain.)\n\nPierre: That black mist just made Jon a vulnerable target, a target that Darkane takes advantage of using his GraveDigger! Darkane pulls McAdams out and tosses him over and to the floor, ending his bid for the 24/7 contract!\n\nErica Ford: Jon McAdams is eliminated!\n\nWWEfan: This match is getting more bizzare by the second! We’ve only got seven fighters left though now so the end is nigh! Azumi and Sheridan continue their battle, but here comes Darkane! He starts punching at both women indiscriminately! Haruna coming in to help her friend and one of her long-time rivals…\n\nStarr Stan: In her imagination.\n\nStew-O: The shade! But Haruna does catch a vicious elbow to the face from Darkane before he starts working over both ladies again…..ARE YOU KIDDING ME! THERON NIKOLAS THROWS HARUNA OUT OF THE RING TO THE FLOOR! WHERE IS THE HONOR IN THAT!?\n\nErica Ford: Haruna Sakazaki is eliminated!\n\nPierre: The action continues as Azumi muscles her way out of the corner in a blind rage, kicking at everthing that moves! Sheridan, Darkane, Theron, and even Johnny are feeling her wrath! She is inscencesd that Haruna was eliminated!\n\nStarr Stan: Why the hell would she care? This is why I find the two of them crazy! They spent all this time saying it was about themselves, that they would prove that they were number one, And she was all about how Haruna was holding her back or whatever!? Why be sad that she got dumped out! It wasn’t you!\n\nWWEFan: Good points but right now it doesn’t matter as Azumi tries to eiminiate Darkane, Johnny Nova coming over to help out but runs into Darkane, the two of them exchanging punches! Sheridan watching all of this and trying to get a rest but decides to attack Azumi! She’s got Darkane almost out but now Sheridan has her…LIFTING HER UP AND OUT TO THE ARENA FLOOR BOTH AZUMI DROPS TO THE OUTSIDE WHILE DARKANE NARROWLY SAVES HIMSELF ON THE APRON, ROLLING BACK IN!\n\nErica Ford: Azumi Goto has been eliminated!\n\nPierre: And just like that we’re down to four! Theron Nikolas, Sheridan Mulller, Darkane and Johnny Nova! Who will survive!? Sheridan, Theron and Darkane all look at each other and then at Johnny Nova….and Johnny knows that they are all gunning for him, fatigued but defiant, he holds both hands up, telling them all to bring it! The heart and guts on display from this young man are extra ordinary!\n\nStew-O: Will guts be enough though? Looks like we’re going to find out as Sheridan makes a move first, Johnny parries her away with a forearm blow. Darkane goes for a strike but misses and Nova hits a standing dropkick! Johnny is on fire as he dodges an elbow from Theron and takes him down with a textbook belly to belly Suplex! This man is on fire as he gets to his feet, he knows that his time is close!\n\nStarrSTan: He has to finish them off now! The time is now!\n\nWWEFan: Nova pulls up Darkane by the hair, a vicious chest chop and he drives him into the ropes, trying to get him over! Sheridan is up and….so much for allinances, she comes to give Johnny a hand! How about that!\n\nPierre: Life comes at you fast, my friends! Sheridan Is pushing with all she’s worth, as is Nova, trying to save himself from Elimination, Darkane has a frenzied grip on those ropes…he’s got Johnny by the ear….pulling him over! That’s got to be excruciating but Johnny is holding on…now Sheridan is trying to eliminate both men…Johnny doesn’t have a good grip on the ropes….HE SLIPS TO THE FLOOR, HIS BACK SMACKING AGAINST THE APRON BEFORE HE FALLS HELPLESSLY TO THE FLOOR!\n\nErica Ford: Johnny Nova is eliminated!\n\nStarr Stan: Darkane and Sheridan are battling as he manages to pull himself up and back into the match….here comes THERON, BUT DARKANE BACKDROPS HIM OVER THE TOP ROPE! ITS ALL OVER FOR THAT GUY!\n\nWWEFan: LOOK AT THE AGILITY DISPLAYED BY THERON THOUGH! HE MANAGED TO LAND FEET FIRST ON THE APRON, HE JUMPS OFF THE ROPES…SPRINGBOARD EUROPEAN UPPERCUT! SHERIDAN LETS DARKANE FALL BACK INTO THE ROPES, SINGLE LEG…LIFTING UP….THERON COMES TO HELP HER AND DARKANE IS GONE! A MAN WHO HAS BEEN A SPECTRE ALL BATTLE ROYAL IS FINALLY ELMNATED AND WE ARE DOWN TO TWO!\n\nErica Ford: Darkane has been eliminated.\n\nStarr Stan: You can hear this crowd, I think a lot more of them are leaning in Sheridan’s direction as the two of them stand poised to do battle in the center of the ring. Sheridan has beaten men much larger than Theron but I’m not sure if she can say she’s beaten someone this chaotic. The two of them tie up and Sheridan manages to slip behind, she goes for a German Suplex but Theron counters with a headbutt! Sheridan lets go…and Theron immediately pulls her in for a blue thunder bomb!\n\nStew-O: This is not good for Sheridan! She’s been fighting nearly the entire time while Theron has been able to pick his spots and make this look much easier than it is! He pulls a nearly limp Sheridan up from the mat, he should just throw her over and be done with it. He’s toying with her, and Sheridan is not someone you want to mess around with. A vicious uppercut and then a slap to the face REVIVES SHERIDAN AS SHE LANDS PUNCHES, ELBOWS, KNEES, ANYTHING AND EVERYTHIING SHE CAN MUSTER! SHE SLIPS BEHIND THERON, THE YOUNG MAN REALIZES HE IS IN TROULBE TRYING TO ESCAPE BUT CANNOT!\n\nPierre: GERMAN SUPLEX! SHERIDAN KEEPS HER GRIP AND PULLS HIM BACK UP….A SECOND GERMAN! SHE’S PULLING HIM UP FOR A THIRD!?\n\nWWEFan: No way……IS SHE GOING TO TRY TO DUMP HIM OUT TO THE FLOOR!? SHERIDAN SETTING HIM UP TO BE TOSSED, GERMAN SUPLEX! ITS OVER!\n\nStarr Stan: He landed on his feet! He landed right on his feet! HE PULLS SHERIDAN IN FROM BEHIND! THE WRISTLOCK…..TOUCH….OF HEROINE!\n\nStew-O: NO! SHERIDAN DODDGED IT AND LANDS A FOREARM….SHE STEPS BACK AND LANDS A KICK TO THE MIDSECTION! DOUBLE UNDERHOOK! IS SHE GOING TO TRY TO SUPLEX HIM OUT OF……OH MY GOD! THERON BACKBODY DROPS SHERIDAN OUT OF THE RING!\n\n(DING DING DING!!!)\n\n(“I Hope You Suffer’ by AFI plays as Theron collaspses on the arena floor, screaming in exaltation as a referee enters the ring and gives him the 24/7 Contract certificate and trophy.)\n\nErica Ford: Ladies and Gentlemen, the winner of the 2017 24/7 Battle Royal………..THERON NIKOLAAAAAAAAAASS!\n\nPierre: I have never seen anything quite like this battle royal! Theron played the game perfectly, avoiding all the extra curricular activities and focused on the basics, rest and eliminating people! He was by far the freshest of the four final participants and made good on that energy with what has to be considerd his biggest career win in EAW to date! He’s bringing the prize home to Showdown and has an extremely good chance of wearing gold.\n\nStarr Stan: It’s truly incredible, absolutely incredible.\n\nWWEFan: I can’t say I was a big fan of all his hiding from legitimate competition during this battle royal, but a win is a win and this is one of the biggest wins you can get in EAW.\n\nStew-O: it’s a career launcher. Sheridan almost had it but this isn’t horse shoes, you can’t get points for being close as she surely knows, getting up now in disappointment and heading to the back.\n\nPierre: Thirty-four people entered the fray and now only one remains…. THERON is that one!\n\n(Ad for the updated EAW Site plays)\n\n( http://i.imgur.com/Lt28Un5.png )\n\n( “Bloodlust” by contRoVersy plays as Ares Vendetta walks out from behind the curtain in a burgundy and black variation of his wrestling gear, with a white skull image on the front of his torso attire. )\n\nRing Announcer: Introducing first… from The Land of The Rising Sun, weighing in at 217 POOOUNNNDSS…. AREEEEEEEEEEESSS VEEENNNDETTAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA!!!!!!\n\n( With every step Ares takes, it creates a ‘yellow brick road’ LED image beneath his feet on the floor panels, and he walks somewhat down the ramp before stopping and waiting…. soon after, “Play for Keeps” – B.o.B plays over the loud speakers as Jaywalker walks out in a bejeweled maroon and black robe with silver trim. )\n\nRing Announcer: His tag team partner… from Scarborough, Canada weighing in at 250 POOOOUNNNDS…. JAAAAAAAAAYYYYYYYYYYYYWALKEEEEEEEEEEEEEEER!!!!\n\n( As Jay walks down the LED yellow brick road on the floor panels, his passing leaves a trail of blood and mangled images of broken limbs behind each foot step. He and Ares continue to the ring together. )\n\nPierre: Jaywalker makes his 8th Pain for Pride appearance, and Ares Vendetta makes his 3rd; these two men have become acquainted by their shared passion for bloodlust and unrelenting malice! They have shown zero regard for anyone in this world, and after using their strength in numbers for months against Devan Dubian and Heart Break Boy, they walk in tonight perhaps in confidence – knowing that they might that same kind of advantage tonight!\n\nCherish: You may unfortunately be right about that, especially with the news that broke about HBB earlier tonight.\n\n(Lights in Metlife Stadium completely cut out….as sounds of thunder and showings of lightening are seen around the arena, Camera pans to Metallica next to the stage wearing mask resembling the face paint of Cage as Lead singer James Hetfiel"
