        "text": "Welcome back to more Dream Matches! This time, I have another fun “One-Off Show” review for you, as I was recommended some All Japan TV and found that their first episode of 1990 was ALL Dream Matches, to the point where we get Bulldogs/Misawa and Fantastics/Kawada in tag bouts, among others!\n\nALL JAPAN TV (Jan. 6th 1990):\n\n* It’s time for another “Full Show” review! This time it’s All Japan’s first weekly TV show of 1990! A friend turned me on to this one, as it’s got some of the weirdest dream matches possible, all while leading to further things for the promotion’s regular cast! What kind of Dream Matches? Well, in JUST THIS SHOW, we have The British Bulldogs vs. Mitsuharu Misawa & Masa Fuchi, The Fantastics vs. Toshiaki Kawada & his “Footloose” tag partner, Kenta Kobashi vs. The Great Kabuki in singles, and main eventing with Genichiro Tenryu vs. IVAN KOLOFF! Like, this is insanity! Four matches all featuring worshipped-in-America Japanese dudes and guys most known for runs in the U.S.! Read on!\n\nSo the whole deal with All Japan at this point is it tends to bring in a lot of foreigners for their tours- spending a few weeks getting in TV matches, and things usually come to a head on a big Budokan show. If guys do well, they might be brought back for other tours. The midcard is often based off of whatever seems to interest Baba, which is why the Fantastics (fading American undersized workers) and the British Bulldogs (a famous team but with Dynamite Kid actively falling apart and about to retire) are kicking around doing matches with natives (and once with each other, which I’ve already reviewed for this column). Randomly you’ll get Great Kabuki come in, and a few months after this show the Miracle Violence Connection (Steve Williams & Terry Gordy) come in and wreck house, immediately becoming top main eventers.\n\nBut these foreigners (gaijin) often swap out (Stan Hansen, still a top-level star, is among the few to stick around constantly). The promotion’s ace is Jumbo Tsuruta, with Genichiro Tenryu still around for a year or so, and Mitsuharu Misawa still decked out as “Tiger Mask” (the second one). And he’s facing the Dynamite Kid, the man who was made legendary fighting the ORIGINAL Tiger Mask!\n\nHogan (in blue!) versus the already-42 Terry Funk in the main event while some VERY 1980s people watch.\n\nWWF SATURDAY NIGHT’S MAIN EVENT:\n\n(Jan. 4th 1986)\n\n* So I decided to take another look at SNME from the ’80s! There’s a handful of them on YouTube, but this appears to be particularly interesting because the main event is Hulk Hogan vs. TERRY FUNK, as Hogan moves through all the midcarders and upper-card guys in the company during his first year as WWF Champion. Macho Man Randy Savage vs. George “The Animal” Steele! Corporal Kirschner vs. Nikolai Volkoff in a “Peace Match”! Plus Hillbilly Jim, Cousin Luke & Uncle Elmer taking on “Rowdy” Roddy Piper, Bob Orton & Jesse “The Body” Ventura! OHH YESSSSSSSS!!! Hook it up to my VEIIIIIIIIIIINNNNNNNNNNNSSSSSS! Read on!\n\nHulk Hogan shows up before the intro to hype his Hulk Hogan “Protein Drink” to Mean Gene (looking classy in a t-shirt with a tuxedo design printed on it). Vince runs down the card, giving us an “and then from there” and “notwithstanding” mere seconds apart and then Ventura comes down to whine about his treatment at the hands of those hillbillies at the last SNME. Vince is at least thankful he won’t have to listen to Jesse’s “biased commentary”, but Jess promises him he won’t be able to just talk to himself, as BOBBY HEENAN is his replacement tonight. Oh man, Bobby Heenan commentating on the hillbillies match- tremendous.\n\n“ROWDY” RODDY PIPER, JESSE “THE BODY” VENTURA & “ACE COWBOY” BOB ORTON vs. HILLBILLY JIM, UNCLE ELMER & COUSIN LUKE:\n\n* OH MAN YES!! A heel asshole dream team up against the comedy babyface pin-eaters of the company. This stems from Uncle Elmer’s (apparently) legit wedding on Oct. 1985, with tons of mean-spirited commentary from Jesse (“it looks like two carp in the Mississippi River goin’ for the same piece of corn!”). I’ve seen only one Elmer match before, and Luke is someone I’m unfamiliar with. He was only there a few months, playing a silent hillbilly- an ankle break caused him to miss WrestleMania 2 and he was soon fired after hoping to be repackaged. He’s that kind of “Mo from Men on a Mission” fat, where he’s fat but not, like, enough to get a push out of it- just hard to move around. Elmer is that exact kind of fat, though, but is a 49-year old 430-lb. bald guy. Hillbilly’s the only one shirtless, owing to his Hogan-esque physique. Speaking of physiques, Jesse’s lost a bit of is, still packing muscle but being a lot softer, with his tie-dyed tights being woefully out of fashion here. Bleach-blond skullet, too. Roddy & Ace are in blue trunks.\n\nhttps://archive.org/details/arsion-07-21-1998-complete-arsion-vol.-1-487517522-456239301\n\nThere’s a version on YouTube, but it’s almost without sound, so I used Archive.org.\n\nARSION COMPLETE, VOL. 1:\n\n(July 21st 1998)\n\n* At last! It’s time for another ARSION show! One from Korakuen Hall, attended by… oh god, 1,450 people? That does NOT sound good. *checks* okay the max is 2,000 so if they’re not lying (they probably are) it’s not THAT bad. But this show features the first time I’ve seen Mika Akino in my watchthrough, so there’s that! And the main event is newly-pushed Rie Tamada (who won that ARS ’98 Tournament, remember?) vs. undersized JTTS Yumi Fukawa! Yeah, that’s uh… a CHOICE for main event.\n\nThis is on Archive.org but thankfully isn’t messing up in my browser. The YouTube one doesn’t have any sound. We’re immediately greeted by a shot of Candy Okutsu tapping out Reggie Bennett at the ARS ’98 Tournament, followed by Yumi Fukawa’s ass in a blue bikini. Yeah, Rossy Ogawa is in charge, alright. A ton of it is a clip show of everything the promotion’s done since it’s Feb. 1998 debut. Then the girls do a tour of Los Angeles for something, then we’re introduced to Ayako Hamada… in a red bikini. Wait I already mentioned Ogawa. Then it’s Mariko Yoshida fighting Lady Apache for the CMLL Women’s Title in June 1997, being tapped out by a wacky lucha submission in less than 5 minutes, then winning the next two falls quickly. She holds that belt well into 1999! Then it’s clips of Yumi Fukawa dropping a fall to Aja Kong in 21 minutes (!!) and Reggie Bennett in 18, as they really emphasize her “tries hard and pushes everyone to the limit before jobbing” thing.\n\nFinally, an HOUR IN, we have our first match:\n\nTHE FIRST STARLIGHT:\n\nMARIKO YOSHIDA vs. MIKA AKINO:\n\n* It’s Mika Akino! She later becomes AKINO and a decent star for the era, and she’s a big trainee of ARSION’s, as the company is also doing in-house training and is getting its own rookies to be threaded into the cards. And of course Akino comes out to be destroyed by one of the promotion’s top stars. Akino’s classmate is Ayako Hamada, who also gets a huge push because of her looks and athleticism, and they form a “Sporty Girl/Pretty Girl” pair pretty much immediately, in a clear attempt at recapturing old Joshi standbys, started by Beauty Pair, the Marine Wolves, and later Manami Toyota/Toshiyo Yamada. In any case, Akino comes out with “Sporty Girl” short hair and a more elaborate outfit than most rookies- the Sporty Girl two-piece get-up but in green, white & yellow. Yoshida’s in the incredible black & red Spider-Woman gear.\n\nWelcome back to more Dream Matches! This time I’m starting off with another of those “wait, THAT happened?” WTF matches, as The Great Kabuki takes his gimmick from the US to All Japan in 1984, teaming up with a very young Prince Tonga (Haku) against aged British veteran Billy Robinson… and Bobby “The Brain” Heenan shortly before he retired! Come see Heenan’s “sniveling heel twerp” act completely fail to get over with Japanese audiences as these four completely disparate guys go out there and wrestle!\n\nThen it’s the end of my look at Dangerous Danny Davis as he takes on Koko B. Ware in 1988! The second of Giant Silva’s solo WWF matches, as he takes on notable luchadore Pantera on WWF Super Astros! And finally, it’s a very notable match between KENTA and Naomichi Marufuji in 2006 NOAH. The famous Dragon Gate 6-Man at ROH from the same year is one of the matches that most-influenced what the American Indie style became… now come see the other one! Because HOLY SHIT every single part of this match looks like it was lifted 100% for today’s AEW Dynamite matches.\n\nTHE GREAT KABUKI & PRINCE TONGA vs. BILLY ROBINSON & BOBBY “THE BRAIN” HEENAN:\n\n(All Japan, June 9th 1984)\n\n* Oh HELL YES!! It’s Haku vs. Bobby Heenan! With great gimmick wrestler Kabuki teaming with young “Prince Tonga” against Heenan and legendary Billy Robinson, a British star wrestler. He’s got curly black hair and a cheesy moustache (like the guy you gotta kick out of a children’s playground), and looks super-old, but gets a pretty good reaction (Heenan gets nothing- they don’t know him). He’s in red trunks while Heenan’s in his standard one-strap tights, looking scrawny and flabby (he was NOT wrestling for long after this). Tonga’s at this point pretty slender compared to his later self, lacking the roid muscle OR bulk. He & Kabuki are in baggy pants.\n\nLADIES LEGEND PRO WRESTLING- LIVE BATTLE ’98:\n\n(June 21st 1998)\n\n* It’s time more more LLPW! As I’ve found a pretty big (by their standards) tape they put out featuring various matches. I think from different dates. This one is headlined in a Double Title match, as Shinobu Kandori defends the LLPW & WWWA World Titles against FMW’s Shark Tsuchiya! As Shark is one of the peak heels behind the G-MAX stable (combining the heel armies of LLPW, FMW & JD’ into one), that’s a pretty big deal, sure to be full of lots of cheating. Also featured are AJW’s top star Yumiko Hotta against Mizuki Endo, a bunch of LLPW-focused matches, and Michiko Nagashima shows up! That’s awesome- I’ve just been getting into her stuff! And here’s her… retirement match.\n\nGODDAMMIT!!\n\nAt least it’s against Yasha Kurenai! Oh, and we’re starting off with the biggest match first:\n\nWWWA WORLD TITLE & LLPW WORLD TITLE:\n\nSHINOBU KANDORI (w/ LLPW loyalists) (LLPW) vs. SHARK TSUCHIYA (w/ goons) (FMW):\n\n(June 13th 1998)\n\n* Remember in the very beginning of my 1998 reviews when Kandori beat Yumiko Hotta in a short shoot-style match for AJW’s Red Belt? But there’s little follow-up since AJW & LLPW have ass presence on YouTube for 1998? Well she’s still champion! And she’s up against Shark Tsuchiya, the infamously bad worker who was FMW’s dominant heel for years, using matches full of weapon shots and cheating, and now she’s part of a mega-heel stable. Shark’s in green & black and Kandori’s in her day-glo yellow & orange bodysuit. Shark takes a casual gangster pose in the corner while the office guy does the opening-match Title spiel, and actually whacks his scroll away with her barbed-wire shinai, drawing in Kandori to shout at her incredible lack of respect and decorum!\n\nWelcome back to more Dream Matches! This week, I have another of those completely bizarre mish-mashes of styles as one of the iconic Attitude Era midcarders takes on one of the FOUR PILLARS, as D’Lo Brown goes to All Japan in the 2000s and wrestles Toshiaki Kawada! In Korakuen Hall! Wrestling is amazing!\n\nNext up, I found one of two Giant Silva SOLO matches on WWF television, as he made Super Astros against jobber J.R. Ryder! Then it’s some classic “Throwaway WCW Stuff” as Booker T takes on Bobby Duncum, Jr. on WCW Saturday Night in 1999. Then it’s an AMAZING squash as Big Daddy V takes on three jobbers in WWE’s version of ECW as they’re building up the former Mabel as a Monster Heel again! And finally, an epic pre-Dragon Gate match as Toryumon puts the UWA Trios Titles up for grabs in a massive match featuring New M2K vs. Do Fixer vs. Crazy Max vs. The Italian Connection! Come see all the weirdo lucha-esque spots, elaborate jumping sequences, YOSSINO’s sprinting, and comedy routines built up from months of house shows!\n\nTOSHIAKI KAWADA vs. D’LO BROWN (w/ Taka Michinoku):\n\n(All Japan, July 30th 2006)\n\n* hahahaha EXCELLENT. I knew D’Lo left WWF and ended up in All Japan for a while, so this fits, but still… the iconic Attitude Era “rising midcarder” fighting one of the FOUR PILLARS? One some random house-show looking thing in Korakuen Hall. I love wrestling. D’Lo’s in a sharp red & black singlet coming down to DMX music. Kawada is at this point 43 years old and had stuck with his old promotion while nearly everyone else in AJPW started their own cooler promotion! With blackjack! And YakuzaImean hookers. D’Lo’s quite a bit bigger and more muscular than his squat opponent. Only Kawada gets ribbons from the fans. Don’t they know they’re lookin’ at the real deal now?\n\nWelcome back to more Dream Matches! Today, I have the wildest thing I’ve found in ages- a match featuring Cactus Jack against ANDRE THE GIANT!! And even weirder, it’s a tag match featuring Mighty Inoue teaming with Andre, and the future King Kong (of the Colossal Kongs) teaming with Cactus as “Texas Terminator Hoss”! I love wrestling!\n\nNext up, it’s the atrocity of The Oddities (Kurrgan & Golga) vs. The Disciples of Apocalypse (Skull & 8-Ball) vs. Too Much! Yes, not even “Too Cool” yet- it’s just a collection of the three most bottom-tier tag teams in the division made to fill 7 minutes of screen time on WWF Shotgun. Then it’s more Sick Boy, as he takes on ex-Flock member Perry Saturn on WCW Saturday Night! More Saturday Night as “Above Average” Mike Sanders shows up in his early days against muscular JTTS (and former Kevin Nash partner) Al Green! And finally, someone put a SOLO NASTY BOYS MATCH on TV, as Jerry Sags (as as BABYFACE!) takes on Beau Beverly! Read on!\n\nANDRE THE GIANT & MIGHTY INOUE vs. CACTUS JACK & TEXAS TERMINATOR HOSS:\n\n(All Japan, April 15th 1991)\n\n* Yes, ANDRE THE GIANT vs. CACTUS JACK. It really happened! Twice, apparently, as Cactus was then a travelling brawler going through as many companies as he could and teaming up with fellow gaijin Texas Terminator Hoss (one of the Kongs- King Kong, in fact). The duo fought Andre and Dory Funk once, and wrestled this match against Andre and Mighty Inoue, the latter an aging star in his 40s. Inoue’s in red trunks (and, at only 5’9″, absolutely dwarfed by everyone in the ring), Andre in a dark singlet, Cactus in a black top & probably animal-print tights, and Hoss is dressed with a blue cowboy hat, black vest, and a red & black singlet. This is taped from a house show, so it’s a single-camera, VERY fuzzy and with poor audio. But still! Andre vs. Cactus!\n\nGAEA JAPAN THIRD ANNIVERSARY SHOW:\n\n(April 19th 1998)\n\n* Hey look! GAEA’s third anniversary! This is a good way to assess things, as by this point most of the First Class has turned into good workers, but as yet still don’t have the credibility to truly press the veterans. GAEA itself has grown, though- initially the vets were just Chigusa (the top wrestler) and KAORU, but now Toshiyo Yamada AND Akira Hokuto have shown up. Hokuto is often injured and wrestling at half-speed still, and is not the draw she once was, but both make the promotion a bit healthier. Yamada’s feud with KAORU has ended and both are sorta on that same “below Chigusa” tier.\n\nThis show features Chigusa’s heel character “Zero” (UGH), FMW’s Bad Nurse Nakamura, a KAORU/Yamada team against the invading heel super-stable from LLPW, and a “600 Seconds” tournament for the First Class, where matches have a 600 second time limit! And after winning THREE MATCHES, the winner becomes Chigusa’s partner against a Super-Veteran squad of Aja Kong & Mayumi Ozaki, who are a new alliance!\n\nZERO (GAEA) vs. BAD NURSE NAKAMURA (FMW):\n\n* OH GOD DAMMIT WE’RE NOT DONE WITH ZERO YET. Yes, Chigusa’s evil heel character returns, complete with black & purple lighting all over the place. At least her minion Zera has returned to her home planet or whatever. Bad Nurse is an FMW heel- the villainous persona of Nurse Nakamura. Both are in mostly dark clothing, with Zero packing the silver & black facepaint. There’s also weird Halloween-ish “howling” going on over the arena while this is going on.\n\nHey- it’s another one-match Joshi Spotlight review, since I posted Dump/Yamazaki earlier this week but needed to fill things out with another. This is from a show I don’t otherwise have, and it’s said to be one of the best early ARSION matches.\n\nAJA KONG vs. MARIKO YOSHIDA:\n\n(ARSION, June 21st 1998)\n\n* This is from a short “ARSION Behind the Scenes” tape, which features the final Rie Tamada/Yumi Fukawa team match, a clip of the ARSION women training in Pancrase with Minoru Suzuki (yes, that one), upcoming prospect Ayako Hamada modeling bikini pictures in Mexico (oh yeah, Rossy Ogawa is running this promotion, alright), a 2.5-minute clip of a 15-minute Reggie Bennett/Mikiko Futagami draw, and this one. This features the #1 and #2 wrestlers in ARSION, more or less (though Yoshida hasn’t quite been “made” yet)- Aja in particular was a Main Eventer and top challenger in All Japan Women’s Pro Wrestling during 1997. Aja’s in blue & black, and Yoshida’s in the red & black spider-lady gear.\n\nThey circle each other VERY carefully to start, jockeying for position and doing non-committal grappling into the ropes- Aja lies back and dares Yoshida to come at her from there, and Yoshida taunts her by leaning casually in the corner, refusing to give in and waits her out. Aja goes to all fours, then finally backs Yoshida into the corner and viciously slaps her, Yoshida trying not to give her the dignity of a sell-job, but failing. Aja follows with the corner lariat for two and gets the mount, but each counters to get it- Aja tries to wear Yoshida down with kicks, but gets caught and taken down, only to make the fans laugh by resting her head on her hands as if she’s lying casually when she stiffens up to refuse Yoshida any leg submissions. Aja no-sells some strikes and powers Yoshida down when she attempts to grapple, showing dominance and grinding her down with a forearm. Yoshida again catches a swiping kick and tries to get a leghold, and finally gets a heel-hook to make Aja holler a bit and she has to make the ropes and work on the ankle outside the ring for a while. Back in the ring, Aja just swats the crap out of Yoshida and headbutts her, setting up the piledriver as she’s now relying on her specialty rather than trying to match Yoshida’s skillset- I feel that’s important psychology.\n\n1980s sex symbols!\n\nNWA WCW SUPERSTARS ON THE SUPERSTATION:\n\n(World Championship Wrestling, Feb. 7th 1986)\n\n* By request, it’s a supercard featuring the NWA guys! I’m going in totally blind, so I wonder what we’re gonna see.\n\nJust a reminder- I AM NOT A WRESTLING HISTORIAN. I never watched NWA growing up, I don’t think I saw any non-WWF wrestling until 1996 and the only stuff I know about this era comes from WWF DVD sets and Scott Keith reviews. So you can take your “Whattaya mean you’ve only seen one Magnum TA match or never seen Ivan Koloff before?” and stick it in your ear! YOUR EAR, I SAY!\n\nWe open with Magnum TA (I think- he’s a blonde guy with a country rock mullet!) riding a motorcycle while hillbilly Willie Nelson music plays. Oh yeah, this is how you fight Hogan’s WWF, alright. Your hosts are Magnum and Linda Curry, who has the GREATEST ’80s hair. She appears to have no link to wrestling- maybe some local newscaster or semi-celebrity? Others reviewing this show compare her to Susan St. James showing up in the WWF. Oh, but actual commentary is by David Crockett (ah, so that’s what he looks like) and Tony Schiavone.\n\nNWA WORLD TAG TEAM TITLES:\n\nTHE ROCK & ROLL EXPRESS (Ricky Morton & Robert Gibson) vs. THE MIDNIGHT EXPRESS (Beautiful Bobby Eaton & Loverboy Dennis Condrey, w/ Jim Cornette):\n\n* Oh hey, these two teams have good chemistry I bet! They carried their feud in all the Southern territories. I don’t think I’ve ever seen the Eaton/Condrey version of the MX. Condrey is the image I have of all Southern wrestlers- short, squat, portly and with a hairy dad-bod and bad hair. He’s in short black trunks and Eaton’s in black tights. The RnRs are in matching black tights with tassels hanging off them, looking like Chachi’s jeans in Happy Days. The difference between WWF & WCW is very obvious here- a dimly-lit arena and a bunch of portly or skinny guys in plain outfits and an aversion to sunlight. Of course, they’re all AWESOME but the visual differences are important here!\n\nHey, Joshi fans! Here’s a temporary look back into 1986, with the peak of the “Gokuaku Domei” era of Zenjo, as Dump Matsumoto and her stable of schoolyard bullies freak out Japan’s population of teenage girls as she faces Itsuki Yamazaki of the Jumping Bomb Angels in a freaky, chaotic mess! Featuring classic schoolgirl shrieking, wild comebacks, insane athletics from the Angel and Dump basing an entire match around the psychology of using SCISSORS to ruin an opponent’s appearance! Read on!\n\nDUMP MATSUMOTO (w/ The Gokuaku Domei/Atrocious Alliance) vs. ITSUKI YAMAZAKI (w/ Noriyo Tateno):\n\n(AJW, Aug. 21st 1986)\n\n* Hell yes! Back to the 1980s for more of prime Dump Matsumoto in all her heelish glory! Here, she has a solo match against the faster half of the Jumping Bomb Angels- Yamazaki! Herself a former heel, Yamazaki is no stranger to cheating, and is backed by her partner (plus a squadron of rookies), though Dump has the entire Gokuaku Domei (often translated to “Atrocious Alliance”) with her, including Bull Nakano & Grizzly Iwamoto. And the referee is former stable-mate, Crane Yu. Dump’s in a black swimsuit that is ENTIRELY too small and sports a mohawk and tons of harsh makeup, while Yamazaki is in a blue one with dorky long ’80s hair. Which she is quite protective of, as we’ll learn.\n\nWrestling’s most unpleasant assholes challenge against the WWF Tag Team Champions!\n\nWelcome back to more Dream Matches! This week, I have a sequel to last week’s Saturday Night’s Main Event review, as I look at a rematch between Demolition and the Brain Busters for the WWF Tag Team Titles! Following that, it’s another Bill Goldberg squash, as he faces the Flock’s Sick Boy on WCW Thunder! Then it’s a bizarre WWF Action Zone match as Mabel & Adam Bomb prep for the Survivor Series in 1994 by teaming up against Barry Horowitz & Reno Riggins! Then we hit one of those dreaded “this is what Nitro became” matches, as the nWo B-Team fighting leaves us with VINCENT vs. HORACE HOGAN on the A-show. Tremendous. And finally it’s more Blitzkrieg goodness as he faces Kaz Hayashi on WCW Worldwide.\n\nWWF TAG TEAM TITLES:\n\nBEST TWO OF THREE FALLS:\n\nDEMOLITION (Ax & Smash) vs. THE BRAIN BUSTERS (Arn Anderson & Tully Blanchard, w/ Bobby Heenan):\n\n(WWF TV, 1989)\n\n* It’s time for a sequel to their Saturday Night’s Main Event fuck finish match! We start with a pair of promos- Tully subtly puts over Demolition as having “slammed the door” on every possible team over three years, but announce that they’ll be different. Arn adds that all the “spoonheads” will roll out of bed Monday morning, open the sports page, and find “BIG. BOLD. PRINT!” of NEW Tag Team Champions- bitchin’ promo. Ax & Smash counter by proclaiming death to Bobby Heenan and saying he can’t interfere for three falls in a row- when asked about strategy by Mean Gene, Smash says “It’s called TOTAL DESTRUCTION for the Brain Busters!”, so clearly he’s thought this out. Mean Gene: “This could prove to be the greatest victory for the good guys since the invasion of Grenada!”. We see the SNME clip of Ax throwing the referee and getting DQ’d, to the disgust of Jesse Ventura. The Busters are in matching trunks with white on front and red in the back- they sure did switch colors a lot.\n\nNEO JAPAN LADIES PRO WRESTLING- BE HAPPY 1ST:\n\n(May 6th 1998)\n\n* It’s time for more Neo Ladies at last (I found a LOT of March-April shows after already writing this one up), this time with Kyoko Inoue vs. Lioness Asuka in one of the most-loved joshi matches of 1998! The TWF World Title is up for grabs, with Kyoko defending the belt in her home promotion against a veritable heel brigade! The rest of the show is apparently a “random draw” of singles matches, leading to Neo’s top stars again flattening the younger generation!\n\nNeo Ladies Roster: Kyoko Inoue, Las Cachorras Orientales, Chaparrita ASARI, Yoshiko Tamura, Tanny Mouse, Yuka Shiina, Misae Genki, Saya Endo\n\nWe start off with everyone drawing names out of a box, setting up matches on the show!\n\nMIMA SHIMODA vs. CHAPARRITA ASARI:\n\n* ASARI was part of a “kid squad” that got demolished 3-on-2 by LCO a while before, and now she’s solo against Shimoda. Mima’s always a bit of a different animal in singles matches, where she doesn’t have as much physical credibility (translation: Mita as a beast to back her up). Both are in red & gold here, looking like a tag team- Shimoda’s snippiness with ASARI reveals that ain’t so, of course.\n\nGAEA JAPAN- FULL BLOOM:\n\n(April 24th 1998)\n\n* It’s time for more GAEA- this time from April, as I kind of go back & forth in the first half of 1998. Joshi’s kind of a mess at this point, so I guess it’s fitting that I keep finding pre-May stuff after I’ve reviewed May shows, lol. The name of the game- ROOKIE-SLAYING!! Chigusa Nagayo, Aja Kong and even AJW’s MANAMI TOYOTA come in for some beatdowns of GAEA’s First Class, which is always fun, as much as I assume it doesn’t help the late-90s narrative that the veterans were “burying” the younger generation. In reality, third years have no business being competitive with veterans so these kids doing as well as they are is semi-unprecedented, but the “Rookies Held Down” narrative holds strong in wrestling commentary.\n\nCHIGUSA NAGAYO vs. SONOKO KATO:\n\n* Chigusa, in a blue/yellow/black outfit, takes on Kato in a clipped (edit: NOPE) match. NEW GEAR ALERT- not only for Chigusa, but Kato now has yellow outlines on her blue gear!\n\nSATURDAY NIGHT’S MAIN EVENT:\n\n(May 27th 1989)\n\n* Yes, I’ve decided to review another entire wrestling show! And this one is SATURDAY NIGHT’S MAIN EVENT! Visible on YouTube! With a gloriously 1980s opening! So much synthesizer! Vince McMahon & Jesse Ventura are our hosts, and Vince runs down the card: THREE Championship matches- Hulk Hogan defends the WWF Title against the Big Boss Man in a STEEL CAGE MATCH (with one of the all-time spots of the 1980s), “Ravishing” Rick Rude defends his IC Title against “Hacksaw” Jim Duggan (now KING of the WWF!), and Demolition defend the Tag Titles against the Brain Busters! Then Randy Savage tries to get back into title contention with a match against Jim “The Anvil” Neidhart!\n\nSNME as a whole was devoted to PPV-tier matches for the most part, with some “filler” mixed in that would ideally by the main event of a weekly TV program like Superstars or Prime Time Wrestling- where it’s midcarders fighting. But entire shows of big matches was a true rarity back then, making shows like this come off as absolutely nuts. You did NOT see Hogan in cage matches on any of the normal TV shows, let me tell you. As this occupied the slot typically given to Saturday Night Live, they front-loaded the show with good stuff and then put the weaker matches on the back end. Everyone typically gets hype promos to set up the matches, as well as cool chyrons in this fancy 1980s screen.\n\nWe’re about two months removed from WrestleMania V, to set the stage. The belt-holders are thus giving their first major defenses.\n\nINTERCONTINENTAL TITLE:\n\n“RAVISHING” RICK RUDE (w/ Bobby Heenan) vs. KING “HACKSAW” JIM DUGGAN:\n\n* A big defense for Rude- Duggan was a heavily-pushed, very protected midcarder at this point, and had recently defeated Haku to win the crown of “King” of the WWF. This had previously been a heel trophy (Harley Race & Haku were the previous Kings), and the cross-eyed, tongue-wagging Duggan was a deliberately incongruous type to swing around that much gold and fancy attire. Rude had just beaten the Warrior at WrestleMania V with the famous “Heenan trips Warrior during a suplex into the ring, and holds his foot down while he’s pinned”. Mean Gene admonishes Heenan’s rule-breaking, but Bobby blows it off “I didn’t break Rule Number One” , Rude: “Just win, baby!”). Duggan, meanwhile, points out he has one eye on Heenan, and one eye on the flag (okay, that’s pretty good), but declares Rude “looks a bit pink to me, if you know what I mean”. Rude’s wearing yellow tights with his own face on his ass, and the IC Title on the front- Duggan’s in the usual blue, and gets the “King” music that Race used, and later went to Jerry Lawler.\n\nWhen you always post Joshi Spotlights on Mondays but it’s Christmas Day, so you don’t wanna waste a BIG column.\n\nJOSHI SPOTLIGHT- MAIKO MATSUMOTO:\n\nBilled Height & Weight: 5’5″ 154 lbs.\n\nCareer Length: 1996-1999\n\n-Yes, it’s time for my favorite thing- padding out a week of Joshi Spotlights (it was gonna be one after a shorter show, but I realized a Spotlight was gonna fall on Christmas) with a bio of a short-lived non-star: Maiko Matsumoto gets a bio! aka “The Brown Swimsuit One”.\n\nOkay, so Maiko is barely in any of GAEA Japan‘s YouTube uploads- they tend to spam out Meiko Satomura & Sonoko Kato matches as those ended up the biggest stars in the long run (put down that knife, Sakura Hirota fans!), and the “middle years” of GAEA were particularly… iffy, when it came to great talent “gets”. The first GAEA class (from 1995) is of miraculous scope, with Meiko, Kato, Chikayo Nagashima, Sugar Sato & Toshie Uematsu all turning into good workers within a couple years- some were having ***+ matches against each other by 1996, and the booking had set them up early on as the backbone of the entire promotion, and they wrestled like it.\n\nMaiko is part of that SECOND class- the Class of 1996 that saw her, Makie Numao, Rina Ishii, Chihiro Nakano and Sakura Hirota debut. And they weren’t as good. They didn’t have the hustle, nor the moveset development, nor the technique to really move forward. And I’ve heard that part of it was the prior expectations not falling on them- instead of forming GAEA’s backbone and filling out the roster and getting lots of focus, they were just endlessly getting their asses kicked with 10+ senpais above them. GAEA’s First Class was getting drilled by Chigusa Nagayo (their trainer & boss), KAORU and like… Bomber Hikari until she quit. The Second and Third Classes had to get their asses kicked by them AND a whole squad of senpais who’d all turned out to be legitimately incredible finds. So imagine Japan’s rigid training structure and the “senpai/kouhai” relationship where you have to be deferential and dutiful to your seniors and there’s not that light at the end of the tunnel where you’re gonna get pushed ahead of them and score some definitive wins.\n\nWelcome back to more Dream Matches! This time, I have the last match in the great AJPW trilogy from 1990-92, as Jumbo Tsuruta leads aging shitbird Masanobu Fuchi & young upstart Akira Taue against Mitsuharu Misawa & the next generation of superstars- Toshiaki Kawada & Kenta Kobashi! This one pays off all the dramatic struggles in past matches and settles their score for good, I think!\n\nBut that’s not all! I have wonders comparable to that, as I’ve found TWO Alex “The Pug” Porteau vs. Faarooq Asad matches from WWF TV in 1996 for your approval! Plus the most “1999 WWF” match possible as “The Lethal Weapon” Steve Blackman takes on a post-Meat Shawn Stasiak!\n\nJUMBO TSURUTA, AKIRA TAUE & MASANOBU FUCHI vs. THE KIDS WHO WON’T GET THE FUCK OFF JUMBO’S LAWN (Mitsuharu Misawa, Toshiaki Kawada & Kenta Kobashi):\n\n(All Japan Pro Wrestling, May 5th 1992)\n\n* It’s the last in the trilogy! Jumbo is the aging veteran, desperate to maintain his spot and get these kids off his lawn. Taue has turned on his generation of stars to join Jumbo’s group, acting as a Mini-Me “Clone Buddy”. Fuchi is the worst person in the entire world, and a cowardly shitass who only does anything against vulnerable opponents. Misawa is the stoic Perfect Japanese Man, unflappable and the leader. Kawada is a brutish, nasty hellraiser but currently Misawa’s friend- easily provoked but deadly when they do it. Kobashi is their young, pretty, dumb ally, easily vulnerable to the other side but with more fighting spirit than brains. This match is in Sapporo, unlike the other two, which were Korakuen shows in Tokyo meant to juice the big Sumo Hall events. The sides are tied at 1-1, with vulnerable Kobashi being beaten in the first, and young (30-ish) Taue isolated in the second after Kawada successfully provoked Jumbo and delayed Taue’s protectors, netting the win. Each side’s top wrestler scored the final pin. But now it’s two years after their first one, and Jumbo’s noticeably older and the younger guys much more elevated and credible.\n\n* It’s time for a rarity! A Friday Dream Matches, this one with just one bout! The sequel to the one I just did! Next week I’ll complete the trilogy!\n\nJUMBO TSURUTA, AKIRA TAUE & MASANOBU FUCHI vs. THE KIDS WHO WON’T GET THE FUCK OFF JUMBO’S LAWN (Mitsuharu Misawa, Toshiaki Kawada & Kenta Kobashi):\n\n(All Japan Pro Wrestling, April 20th 1991)\n\n* Six months after their last classic, the six men come together once more! Last match, Fuchi kept vulturing on on vulnerable opponents, Taue kept provoking Kawada (who himself likes to provoke others, but is ill-tempered too), who kept losing his temper and pummeling him, and Kobashi was a total dumbass charging into the big guys and paying for it, while his partners were smarter and learned from his mistakes. But Jumbo was just too much for them, directing traffic and letting the guys punch themselves out and destroyed Kobashi with repeated big moves.\n\nSo it’s established that Fuchi is clever and can tie people up, Taue means well but is in over his head against his opponents (often relying on his sumo training origins whenever he’s pressed), and both guys require Jumbo to come in and mop up for them. Jumbo is more than any of the babies can handle, but he himself is an aging veteran and as soon as the pace quickens, he starts getting battered- and he’s grumpy and easily annoyed by their adventures across his lawn. But he can still get any one of them to punch themselves out, and he and his squad are MUCH smarter and more strategic. Now it’s the rematch! And what happens is an all-timer.\n\nIt’s Kenta/Taue… and ONCE AGAIN, Taue swats Kawada off the apron in a cheapshot, this time with a slap! Kawada has to be calmed down by Kobashi (Misawa is blank-faced as ever), but Taue lariats him down and then knocks Kawada off the apron AGAIN. Kawada’s totally dead, having hit the railing, and soon Jumbo calls out Misawa! Misawa gets the best of an elbow battle by being faster, so Jumbo’s just “alright, then” and hits knees to the gut instead. Fuchi tries to follow his lead, but Misawa catches his knee and stretches him… but Taue nails him… and knocks Kawada off again! Oh you motherfucker. Jumbo’s clapping makes the spot. Misawa gets pummeled by Jumbo in the corner, but as soon as Jumbo picks up the pace Misawa nails him off the turnbuckles and Kobashi lights him up. Jumbo slows him by weighing him down and getting a dirty break on the ropes. Fuchi twists at Kobashi’s arm, then Taue takes over… and IN COMES KAWADA to murder his ass for all that apron bullshit! Eat those kicks, you pig! Taue decks him going back to the corner and now it’s just a full-blown fistfight while the referee desperately tries to restore order and everyone hits the ring to try and interfere! Kawada of course gets a MASSIVE reaction for this as he beats Taue into goo, even as his teammates are like “oh NOOOOOOO” and try to break it up.\n\nWelcome back to more Dream Matches! This time… a GOOD match! It’s part of my trilogy of All Japan Legendary Six-Mans, as Jumbo Tsuruta leads his two minions (young ex-sumo Akira Taue and lightweight dickhead Masa Fuchi) against AJPW’s young upstarts- Mitsuharu Misawa, Kenta Kobashi & Toshiaki Kawada! Come see Kobashi’s best “fiery young guy” selling, Kawada’s best “hot tag BeamSpam kicker” murder and Jumbo being the grumpiest old man in history, with magnificent spots throughout.\n\nThen a match that could prove to be just as much a classic, as King Kong Bundy faces Duke “The Dumpster” Droese in the most “1994 WWF” match possible! And finally, the WWF debut of ALEX “THE PUG” PORTEAU, as he faces Barry Horowitz in a shockingly-decent amateur-style contest!\n\nJUMBO TSURUTA, AKIRA TAUE & MASANOBU FUCHI vs. THE KIDS WHO WON’T GET THE FUCK OFF JUMBO’S LAWN (Mitsuharu Misawa, Toshiaki Kawada & Kenta Kobashi):\n\n(All Japan Pro Wrestling, Oct. 19th 1990)\n\n* OHHHHHHHHH yeah- time to hook up some of the famous All Japan 6-Mans! This is the first of a trio someone gave me. The deal here is Ace of All Japan, Jumbo Tsuruta, has turned into the very thing he used to fight in the 1970s- a grumpy, aging veteran, taking potshots at these young turks every chance he gets, showing desperation to keep his spot and title. Misawa of course leads these young punks in their adventures across Jumbo’s lawn, with his tag partner Kawada, and the exciteable even younger guy, Kobashi. Akira Taue is Jumbo’s resolute partner- a fellow giant at like 6’5″, acting like a Clone Buddy but a baby-faced 29-year old. Fuchi is a career partner of Jumbo’s as well- a top Junior star and looks much older than his 35 years, with “old guy hair” and an unimpressive physique. Misawa, Kawada & Kobashi are all in their iconic gear- Jumbo & Fuchi are in black trunks & Taue’s in red. Both team leaders seem super over, as Misawa stoically leads his team while Jumbo looks like someone just woke him up and is going to regret it.\n\nLADIES LEGEND PRO WRESTLING:\n\n(Feb. 15th 1998)\n\n* WOO IT’S TIME FOR MORE LLPW! Which is like… my LEAST favorite of all the joshi promotions, but still! Completion! At least to say I watched some of their stuff! This one is billed as “LLPW vs. Guren-Tai” as Eagle Sawai’s heel stable blasts forth. And it’s also Eagle combining her stable with those of Shark Tsuchiya & Lioness Asuka (from FMW & JD’, respectively) to form a SUPER stable! So we see matches from all three of them tonight, culminating with a 6-Woman Street Fight in the main event! And HOLY JESUS that one is a spectacular mess of non-stop action, and a total must-see! Like I was dreading watching this one, but that match alone is a reason to watch this.\n\nWe start off with a TV studio interview with Yasha Kurenai, hidden behind dark shades and a dark sweater.\n\nMIHO WATABE (LLPW) vs. MAIKO MATSUMOTO (GAEA Japan):\n\n* It’s Rookie Mayhem! Maiko is still pretty new and is developing some power-themed offense (so I hope you like atomic drops). I don’t know squat about Miho. She’s… jesus christ, she’s *4’9*!!?! She actually has a decently long career (1996-2005 as Baby-A) and is of similar experience to Maiko here. Maiko’s in yellow & brown, and Watabe’s in frilly orange.\n\nANATOMY OF A DISASTER: SCOTT STEINER vs. STEVIE RAY:\n\n-It’s time for another Anatomy of a Disaster! This one is a special request from our very own Oprah (who goes by variants of that name in the threads most of the time)- a Title vs. Career Nitro bout between newly-crowned WCW World Champion Scott Steiner, and Stevie Ray, late of Harlem Heat!\n\nTHE STAGE: WCW Monday Nitro (Nov. 27th 2000)\n\nTHE PERFORMERS:\n\nScott Steiner: I’ve gone over Scottie’s career in this column before, but at this point, he had finally been made a standard Main Eventer in WCW, at last being elevated to that position after years of stop & start pushes, and him puttering around the midcard since his heel turn when he first joined the nWo. Scott had finally gained the charisma of a top guy, mixing his psychotic personality with some entertaining mannerisms and a proper ego… but in the process had done so many steroids that he’d lost so many steps in the ring that he no longer resembled the same man who had blown minds in the early 1990s in any way, shape or form. At this point, he was bloated, veiny and gross (denying steroid abuse with “they’re all just jealous!”), and had slowed down into a basic brawler.\n\nStevie Ray: Stevie’s career has largely been summed up as “the Marty Jannetty of Harlem Heat”, having been a major player in the “nWo B-Team”- like Scottie, he’d turned on his brother and joined the nWo, but as he was a poor worker and medium talent otherwise, he hadn’t gotten a push and was instead just a tough-talking midcarder who hit people with a slapjack, heading up the “Black & White” sub-faction after all the cool guys had joined the Wolfpac and Hogan’s followers kept the old colors, then a team (which was called the “B-Team” ON CAMERA) of subordinates like Vincent, Brian Adams, etc. By this point he’d been doing commentary already (with lines such as “Suckas gotsta know” and talking over promos), and he was only wrestling a couple of times a month. In fact, this was his first match in two months, according to Cagematch (his last was another bout against Steiner in September).\n\nThe lesson here is: “Don’t put a foreign guy on excursion into a stupid jobber role, because if he turns out to be a future Ace, you’ll look like morons and people will snark on you forever”. I mean it’s not gonna come up that often, but it’s a lesson nonetheless.\n\nWelcome back to more Dream Matches! This time, I have a weirdo “WTF?” Dream Match featuring the legendary Ace of New Japan, KAZUCHIKA OKADA… against Stevie Richards. Yeah, because both were in TNA at the same time, back when Okada was a midcard loser on excursion and Richards was an ex-WWE guy they loved to snap up. Then it’s a battle of European wrestlers famous for their girth, as Loch Ness (Giant Haystacks) takes on Alex Wright on WCW Nitro!\n\nNext up, it’s the weird singles run of “Chaz” (Headbanger Mosh) as he faces Ken Shamrock on WWF New York! Then a massive criss-crossing of disparate lightweight stars as Jeff Hardy & X-Pac take on Rob Van Dam & Billy Kidman in the midst of the WCW/ECW InVasion! This one’s interesting because of how different an ebb each of the four were on their careers at this point, despite all having the same core concept of “High-Flying White Guy Getting Noticed”. Finally, I’ve found ANOTHER instance of an Indie Legend working as a WWF jobber, as Christopher Daniels is trotted out to face Droz of all people on New York as well!\n\nOKADA vs. STEVIE RICHARDS:\n\n(NWA TNA Xplosion, Nov. 16th 2010)\n\n* Oh hey, Stevie Richards was in TNA! I wasn’t paying attention at all back then, but he’s brought it up on his YouTube channel! And more importantly, OKADA was in TNA, too! But of course the future top star of New Japan was then a random rookie on his American excursion, in a run famous for the would-be superstar being misused horribly. Checking it out, he was in the company a whole YEAR before making his second appearance on Impact (he’d only been on Xplosion, mostly jobbing, before that), in a move that is credited with ruining any potential relationship between New Japan (who wanted their boy given some experience and likely good opponents, not just getting squashed) and TNA. Stevie cuts a boring promo before the match, I think botching what he was gonna say, going “In a world of CAN… I CAN!”. Okada looks downright sleepy before the match. Richards is in white trunks and still has his physique, representing the ECW-loving group EV2, which is now just him & Tommy Dreamer. Okada’s super-baggy pants are a vision.\n\nWhy did it take so long to do a Spotlight on Rie Tamada? Well, I forgot I hadn’t already done one! Which… really says it all about Rie Tamada, if you think about it.\n\nJOSHI SPOTLIGHT- RIE TAMADA:\n\nBilled Height & Weight: 5’2″ 125 lbs.\n\nCareer Length: 1991-2004\n\n-Rie Tamada is… really one of those weird forgotten wrestlers who stuck around FOREVER, but never really left any kind of a defining mark. A wrestler for All Japan Women’s Pro Wrestling, then ARSION, he peaked at “just okay” to “pretty good”, never showed much charisma, didn’t have the physical credibility to be a bigger star in her era, nor was she fast enough to make up for being kinda small. Just one of those Eternal Midcarder roles you still actually need in a good, healthy company, but nothing to write home about. Like she doesn’t SUCK or anything, but she’s just never even in the top five most interesting wrestlers on a card.\n\nOf particular note: Rie doesn’t develop any UNIQUE MOVES. It’s a standard thing in joshi for a wrestler to start to eke out their own offense, making up the occasional thing or having some “specialty” stuff. But she’s just using the Communal Joshi Offense in every single match I’ve ever seen her in- missile dropkicks, DDTs, etc.- ending matches with a Dragon Suplex, which is a pretty common upper-tier move. It’s not the WORST thing in the world, but it’s really notable when someone who is already pretty vanilla just does the same basic stuff that half the joshi industry is doing.\n\nRie is in a tough spot- she’s fast, but certainly not mind-blowing- her high-flying is not more impressive than Chaparrita ASARI’s, and not even moreso than Manami Toyota (who is four inches taller and far more physically credible and explosive). She can hit all the suplexes but they just look pretty basic. She’s not a botch machine, but nor is she super impressive in her execution. Like, she ends up peaking as a ***-***1/2 performer, with the latter end of the scale being so rare I can’t think of any examples off the top of my head. So she’s never embarrassing but she’s certainly never that INTERESTING, either. And it seems like once she realizes that no push is ever really forthcoming, she just settles into that “midcard” role and never leaves it, dropping her effort level down. Notably, you can see stuff in ARSION where everyone is trying their asses off and there’s this brand new precision submission style going on, and instead of trying to learn that style she’s just doing the same basic Zenjo restholds as before.\n\nANATOMY OF A DISASTER: THE UNDERTAKER vs. THE UNDERTAKER:\n\n-It’s time for another Anatomy of a Disaster! The infamous battle of the Undertakers, where they have one of the worst matches in WWF history… and at SUMMERSLAM of all things!\n\nTHE STAGE: WWF SummerSlam 1994\n\nTHE PERFORMERS:\n\nThe Undertaker: The Undertaker had been a big deal since his debut in the WWF (introduced by Ted DiBiase, who then immediatley stepped aside, as Taker was managed first by Brother Love, and then Paul Bearer), becoming World Champion within a year (for a week), and had been pushed strongly ever since. However, in early 1994, he was defeated by Yokozuna at the Royal Rumble in a Casket Match when a dozen other heels attacked him, and then “lightning” struck the casket, Taker appeared on the viewscreen shot from above while lying in the casket, then floated above the screen and into the heavens or something. This was done to give Taker some time off. Various “interviews” were filmed of people across the United States swearing they’d seen the Undertaker popping up here and there, almost like a cryptid, leading to a big mystery as to where he was. And then…\n\nEver see shitty wrestlers buried so hard you actually feel kinda sorry for them? The Public Enemy is one of those those situations.\n\nWelcome back to more Dream Matches! Today I have another dramatic example of someone being buried on TV, as the infamous WWF run of The Public Enemy continues with a 4-team match with the on-screen storyline being “LOL everyone in the locker room hates these guys and they’re just not fitting in”. Which would be fine if that wasn’t what was ACTUALLY happening, and it totally buries the team!\n\nThen it’s a “dream match” between World Champions, but a couple years early, as Booker T defends the WCW TV Title against Yuji Nagata in 1998 when one was a rising star and the other was on his US excursion! And it’s on the C-show! Then we get an atrocious match representing the “well we need Al to do comedy stuff…” run of Al Snow as he takes on the Super Minis, four Luchadore dwarfs, on WWF Shotgun in 1999! Then it’s another great example of “Future Names as WWF Jobbers” as future ECW guys Steve Corino & Julio “Dinero” Sanchez team up as jobbers against the New Midnight Express (that’s right- a double whammy as I continue my “Bombastic Bob & Bodacious Bart” run!) in 1998! And finally, it’s Owen’s turn to beat up Dangerous Danny Davis, as the Blue Blazer takes on the former & future referee in the continued existence of Davis as the bottom-tier heel JTTS in 1989 WWF!\n\nTHE PUBLIC ENEMY (Flyboy Rocco & Johnny Grunge) vs. THE HARDY BOYZ (Matt & Jeff Hardy) vs. THE DISCIPLES OF APOCALYPSE (Skull & 8-Ball) vs. TOO MUCH (Brian Christopher & Scott Taylor):\n\n(WWF Shotgun Saturday Night, 04/03/1999)\n\n* OOH, excellent! A throwaway Shotgun match but it’s a four corners tag match featuring wildly disparate acts with extremely varied careers! The Hardyz are about to take off and be a huge deal but are currently jobbers, the DOA flame out and end up having careers lasting ten years longer than they should for talentless Nazi fucks, Too Much are about to take off as “Too Cool” but not as much as the Hardyz, and TPE are about to flame out of wrestling as a whole. Their WWF career did NOT last long. Which means almost every match they fought was against guys they’d almost never meet again- Dream Matches personified! Except with shitty workers! Well, shittiER. They’re no Jim Powers, is what I’m saying. Oh man Matt & Jeff are actually in dweeby OMEGA tights with ultra-early ’90s spackle on them and shit. Too Much are in matching neon yellow tights (and hilariously dorky bike helmets, owing to an association with DOA). And you know TPE’s getting shit on because the COMMENTARY is digging on how much they’re hated, stating that “as soon as they bring their bags into the locker room, everybody leaves” but that publicly both them and the other wrestlers deny anything is going on “but it’s so evident- it’s so plain to see!”.\n\nMikiko Futagami in the main event! And… it’s awesome?!? Read on!\n\nhttps://archive.org/details/arsion-04-17-1998-starlet-98-487517522-456239306\n\nSomeone on Reddit gave me a link to the show! It’s free and I think not illegal! Hooray!\n\nHYPER VISUAL FIGHTING ARSION- STARLET:\n\n(March 17th 1998)\n\n* Hooray! More ARSION! Someone on Reddit was good enough to send me a link to Archive.org’s copy of ARSION: Starlet. Of course now it’s out of order with the last show I did- I haven’t been this embarrassed since I learned the sit-out powerbomb and Ligerbomb were different moves. But ARSION doesn’t have any real continuity yet, so it doesn’t matter! This show goes from “meh” to FANTASTIC, as the main event is one of the best joshi matches of the year, and a true eye-opening performance by both wrestlers! Also come see just how hard they’re pushing Michiko Omukai!\n\nThe English-speaking voiceover says “Welcome to Hyper Visual Fighting ARSION- exciting, BEAUTIFUL, excellent lady fighters! Fighters for the new millennium- are you ready?!”. Everyone runs out in their street clothes which, because it’s 1998, looks like a scene from MTV’s Daria. Like, check Yoshida’s neon green belly-shirt with SUSPENDERS and baggy white pants.\n\nMusic is overplayed throughout, all of which is adorably “1998” as well, sounding like the songs from the Spice Girls that DIDN’T get singles or music videos. Or like the J-Pop mix-tape my host family made for me this year.\n\nREGGIE & JESSIE BENNETT vs. MICHIKO OMUKAI & YUMI FUKAWA:\n\n* And immediately we finally get the Bennett “family” (they are not related) together, and the powerhouses are taking on the youngest Japanese women in the company in Omukai & Fukawa, both semi-experienced types who were near the bottom of the card and joined ARSION in hopes of a push. The Bennetts are in their black bodysuits, Fukawa’s in blue & Omukai’s in red & white.\n\nSome guys improved in look slightly as their careers went on.\n\nWelcome back to more Dream Matches! I have a great assortment of complete crap for you today, folks! MonsoonClassics has uploaded a horde of random WWF & WCW matches, and it’s a real smorgasbord of “wait, that happened?” nonsense- the stuff Dream Matches are made of!\n\nWe start off with Essa Rios vs. SAMOA JOE, as Joe was in fact one of many indie darlings cast as jobbers on WWF weekend TV in the early 2000s along with Bryan Danielson & Low-Ki. Then it’s over to WCW as the Flock breakup continues with a workrate paradise of Van Hammer vs. Reese! Then we get more of the NEW MIDNIGHT EXPRESS, with Bombastic Bob & Bodacious Bart being made to fill Shotgun Saturday Night time with the Headbangers after the WWF had given up on both teams!\n\nThen it’s a fascinating match as Dean Malenko takes on “Just Joe”, indie dweeb Joe E Legend with a “shit-disturber” gimmick- itself not interesting… what IS interesting is Kevin Kelly and Michael Cole doing the most vicious bury job I’ve ever heard on commentary. It seriously has to be heard to be believed- this goes way beyond even Monsoon & JR’s biggest digs and has to be based off of reality.\n\nFinally, it’s late-stage WCW with CHRIS HARRIS turning up as a job guy, teaming up with Mike Rapada against the super-rookie squadron of Mark Jindrak & Sean O’Haire!\n\nESSA RIOS vs. SAMOA JOE:\n\n(WWF Metal, March 3rd 2001)\n\n* Oh man I love bullshit like this. Going-nowhere forgotten WWF acts taking on fuckin’ legends like Samoa Joe back when they were just starting out as jobbers. Joe hilariously has curly bleach-blond hair and is only a little doughy (but wearing the ECW t-shirt of shame), while Rios has given his last fuck and just has this “YUP- workin’ the D-shows…” look to him as he comes out post-turning on Lita and has nothing going on. Joe is billed at 280 lbs. but looks barely larger than Rios at all, and I think they’re the same height (their billed heights are four inches apart, of course). Rios is in black & blue tights while Joe looks like he’s just come from a Linkin Park concert."
