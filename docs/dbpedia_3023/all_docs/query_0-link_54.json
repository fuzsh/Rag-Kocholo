        "text": "[/vc_row]\n\nDAY 1\n\n( EAW Intro plays )\n\n(The picture comes into focus of the scenic view of downtown Miami, colorful and vibrant, music playing as people converse in various restaurants, hotels and shops. All over Miami has propaganda and advertisements of PFP 9 in the form of posters, billboards, murals and etc. Suddenly everything stops and all that the viewer can see is the empty New Miami Stadium and the Pain for Pride IX set built onto its field.)\n\n(Voice Over): Eight times before, warriors have gathered from around the world in the biggest gathering of stars the wrestling universe has ever known. Blood, sweat, tears, souls…everything has been given. Thousands arrive year after year, stadium after stadium to see the greatest in the professional wrestling world ply their trade.\n\n“Announcer: Here is your Winner… and the NEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEW EAW Hardcore Champiooon!!! The Rated R!!! SHAMANNN OOOF SEXYYYY!!!”\n\n(Pictures from previous Pain for Pride decorate the screen in a collage of combatants. Legends, Hall of Famers, rising stars are all seen. Each time a commentator can be heard, a still photo of each victorious athlete comes into focus.)\n\n(Voice Over): Do you hear the echo of the past? Have you learned from the eight previous trips to the Pinnacle of Professional Wrestling?\n\n( Flash back to PFP 2 )\n\n“AND BOBBY THROWS THE FINAL PUNCH, BRASS KNUCKLES RIGHT INTO EXTREME ENIGMA’S FA— NO!!! ENIGMA BLOCKS THE SHOT USING THE CITV BRIEFCASE!!!!! AND EXTREME ENIGMA WITH THE BRIEFCASE BASHES IT STRAIGHT INTO BOBBY’S SKULL, AS BOBBY CASH FALLS OFF OF THE LADDER!!!!”\n\n“Deadprez: HE’S GOT IT! HE’S GOT IT!!!!! BAH GAWD ALMIGHTY HE’S GOT IT!!!!”\n\n“Stew-O: AND EXTREME ENIGMA UNHOOKS THE CITV BRIEFCASE!!!!!!!!!!!!!! IT’S OVER!!!!!”\n\n“( DING! DING! DING! )”\n\n“Announcer: The winner of this match…. AND THE 2009 MR.CASH IN THE VAULT…. EXTRRRRREEEEEEEEEEME…. EEEEEEEEEEEEEEENIGMAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA!!!! ”\n\n(Voice Over): They have learned. Whether experienced or young, they all know the lessons of this event’s legendary history. It’s not just a wrestling show spanning a weekend. It’s not just a series of the best matches EAW can produce for the entire universe to behold. It is a movement. It is a tradition. It is a chance to define a legacy. It has made men champions, champions legends, and legends immortals.\n\n“(Ding! Ding! Ding!)”\n\nRing Announcer: The winner of this match… and NEWWWWWWWW… HEAVYWEIGHTTTT CHAMMMPIONNNN OF THE WORRRLLLLLLDDDDDDD…. ROBBBBBB-BIEEEEEE-V!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!\n\n“Deadprez: THE DREAM HAS COME TRUE!!!! ROBBIE V IS WORLD HEAVYWEIGHT CHAMPION!!! HE DEFEATS RRS IN FRONT OF A CAPACITY CROWD HERE IN DALLAS!!!… THE FOURTH ANNIVERSARY OF PAIN FOR PRIDE! THE STARS SHINE BRIGHT TONIGHT AS ROBBIE V PICKS UP THE WIN!!!”\n\n(Voice Over): Epic confrontations. Classic matches. Stunning victories, painful defeats. Everything that we see and feel and experience year after year at this incredible gathering has one lesson that above all must be remembered by those who dare to dream, dare to fight, and defy the odds. Even though the lesson may be bloody, painful, hard, you best pay attention! Because you never know when things may end and the chance to apply its knowledge lost forever…\n\n“(Scott Diamond exits the ring and yanks the apron off of the ring with the “EAW Pain for Pride” logo and rips through it. He’s surrounded by security as he’s screaming)”\n\n“Scott: IT’S!!!!! OVER!!!!!!!!! IT’S!!!!!!!! OVER!!!!!!!! IT’S!!!!!!! OVER!!!!!!”\n\n“(Camera pans over the shocked and dismayed fans in the audience as people are filing out of the arena)”\n\n“(Scott Diamond goes to the side of the ramp and picks up a cable and pulls the plug as the camera cuts to nothing.)”\n\n(Voice Over): What is that lesson? It’s simple: The pain that one feels will eventually heal. It is merely temporary, and unfortunate affirmation of the human condition. Pride is forever. One thing, pain, must be given up in order to obtain something else of value. Everyone talks of glory. What are you willing to give up to attain it?\n\n(“Better Hide, Better Run” by The Glitch Mob ft./Mark Johns plays as a fast-forwarded video of Elitists and Vixens arriving and the beautiful New Miami Stadium quickly fills with fans from all over the world. Highlights of all the buildup leading into the show from Dynasty, Showdown, Battleground, Voltage and the revamped Turbo are shown.)\n\n(The music continues as dimly lit rooms are shown with various elitists and vixens standing face to face with one another.)\n\n(Voice Over): One of the greatest women to ever wrestle will stare at the Future….and look to prove that her time is still now.\n\n(Cameron Ella Ava and Jamie O’Hara face off, Cameron sporting a little smirk.)\n\n(Voice Over): Old scores between bitter foes are settled as Elite, for one brutal moment, will go Extreme once more.\n\n(Scott Diamond and Diamond Cage stare each other down intensely, Scott beating at his own chest wildly.)\n\n(Voice Over): Men made of iron will clash to prove once and for all whose mettle is stronger.\n\n(Jaywalker and Lannister, draped in the German flag, stare into each other’s eyes, fists clenched.)\n\n(Voice Over): Latin Pride will not be the only thing on the line as Champion Faces Challenger for the EAW Interwire Championship.\n\n(Mexican Samurai holds up the Interwire Championship in the face of an unbowed TLA, his face covered with a bandanna.)\n\n(Voice Over): A legend takes his final bow on the greatest stage to do so. One man looks to make sure that he meets his retirement in defeat….and in the process retain his Pure Championship.\n\n(A grinning Carson Ramsey, wearing his Pure Championship stands face to face with Starr Stan, wearing his Olympic medal.)\n\n(Voice Over): Two former World Champions collide to finally conclude a rivalry that the genesis of can be traced over three years ago at this very event. In the end, one must say “I Quit.”\n\n(Jacob Senn and Zach Crash stare each other down, nearly coming to blows.)\n\n(Voice Over): Unlikely partners unite to face a common, twisted enemy hell-bent on conquest and expanding their sadistic reach.\n\n(Hades and Kevin Devastation stand shoulder to shoulder to stare down a laughing Eclipse Diemos and a silent Erebos.)\n\n(Voice Over): Men and women clash in a unique battle of traitors and partners, Champions and Challengers, relative unknowns and future legends. Who will keep their friends close…and their enemies closer?\n\n(The Vixens Team of Cailin Dillon, Tarah Nova, Stephanie Matsuda, Erica Ford and Azumi Goto stand shoulder to shoulder to meet the New Breed Team of JJ Silva, Haruna Sakazaki, Lucas Johnson, Piff Fumador and Venom. On either side, teammates glance uncomfortably at each other, Tarah and JJ both clutching their championship belts.)\n\n(Voice Over): A model of new-era efficiency will face off with one of the standard bearers of the Vixens Division with the Vixens Cup becoming the undisputed property of the winner.\n\n(Sheridan Muller and Kendra Shamez face off, the Vixens Cup trophy on a glass platform standing in-between them.)\n\n(Voice Over): Winner. Take. All. With the men involved, there is no more need for words…. besides perhaps Tables, Ladders and Chairs.\n\n(Drake, Jones, Judas sit across from Pizza Boy, Cyclone, and Brian Daniels in steel chairs, a table separating them….and a ladder leading to both the Unified World Tag Team Championships and National Elite Championships in the background.)\n\n(Voice Over): An Empress on the way to becoming a legend. A ferocious dragon whose greed for gold knows no limits. One looks to further their Hall of Fame Legacy; the other looks to surely cement her status as the leader of the New Generation of Vixens.\n\n(Aria Jaxon and Heart Break Gal face off, the EAW Vixens Championship on her shoulder of Jaxon.)\n\n(Voice Over): A field of hungry participants look to attain a golden ticket to ensure them the fast-track to EAW Superstardom…. while one warrior looks to swoop in and take their shining moment for himself.\n\n(Liam Catterson is shown in a suit, an arrogant grin on his face as he holds the 24/7 contract in his hands.)\n\n(Voice Over): One of the most dangerous matches in EAW history. Eight men daring to dream. Who will claim the right to call himself Mr. Cash in the Vault? The veteran Lioncross? The ruthless Rex McAllister? The brash Angelo? The resilient Tig Kelly? The hard-working Nick Angel? The Sensational Phoenix Winterborn? The Prince of Showdown, Chris Elite? Or The Nas?\n\n(None of the participants are shown. Only a room chock full of ladders, the CITV briefcase resting at the top of the tallest one.)\n\n(Voice Over): Omerta’s Dragon faces its latest challenge to the crown: a beast of a human being looking to finally claim the elusive World Championship he has been so tantalizingly close to before.\n\n(Scott Oasis stands wearing the World Heavyweight Championship in front of Lucian Black, who simply smirks and signals at his waist.)\n\n(Voice Over): A brilliant Prince of a Champion looks to claim the moment that proves he is here to stay amongst EAW’s elite: his coronation to become King. Will he overcome the former ruler of Showdown and another Champion who also wishes to cement his legacy and end eight years of frustration?\n\n(Carlos Rosso, wearing the CWF Championship belt faces off with Aren Mstislav, wearing the EAW Championship, as Victor Vendetta stands in the background, his eyes giving a cold stare straight into the camera.)\n\n(Voice Over): An fanatical Champion must overcome three challengers, three former World Champions, three of the greatest of all time to retain his stranglehold on gold.\n\n(Ares Vendetta is shown standing in the center of a room, dim lighting picking up the features of Y2Impact, Devan Dubian and Tyler Parker surrounding him.)\n\n(Voice Over): The Best in the World. The Best Ever. Two EAW Icons meet in one of the most anticipated clashes in EAW history.\n\n(Xavier Williams and DEDEDE face off in a room much more brightly lit than all the others, golden hues all around as Williams holds up the Hall of Fame championship in the face of his challenger, who angrily slaps it away.)\n\n(Voice Over): Pride has its price. It’s paid for in Pain. Who will be the teachers and who will the students? Tonight we find out! THE TIME IS NOW!\n\nNarrator: AND NOW…. Elite Answers Wrestling proudly presents to you…. THE NINTH EDITION OF PAIN FOR PRIDE, LIVE FROM NEW MIAMI STADIUM!!!!!\n\n( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rGmofIZ4vPk )\n\n(The full New Miami Stadium comes into view now, thousands of standing, screaming fans waving flags from countries all over the world and holding signs as pyrotechnics explode from the enormous stage area as well as in the sky above the stadium. )\n\n( Fighter jets piloted by the Blue Angels fly overhead as well, delighting the fans as the fireworks finally cease. As the jets depart, a massive blimp also comes into focus for a moment featuring the EAW and Pain for Pride logos with the banner reading “Time of Your Life” whipping behind it. )\n\nStew: WE ARE LIVE!!!! WELCOME, PEOPLE OF THE WORLD, TO THE STAGE OF ALL STAGES!!! WELCOME TO THE TIME OF YOUR LIFE!!! WELCOME TO PAIN FOR PRIDE NIIIIINEEEE!!!!!\n\n( MASSIVE red and white pyro and fireworks blast everywhere on this cloudy late afternoon, as the newly renovated New Miami Stadium. )\n\nStew-O: IF YOU CAN HEAR MY VOICE, YOU CAN FEEL THIS ENERGY!!! NEW MIAMI STADIUM IS FILLED IN RECORD ATTENDANCE OF 81,452 MEMBERS OF THE EAW UNIVERSE!!! THIS IS THE SHOWCASE OF THE IMMORTALS!! THIS IS WHAT WE’VE ALL BEEN WAITING FOR!!

THIS IS WHAT WE ALL WORKED HARD FOR FOR SO LONG, THIS IS MAGNIFICENT, THIS IS ILLUSTRIOUS, THIS IS PAIN FOR PRIDE!!!\n\n( DING! DING! DING! )\n\nRing Announcer: THE FOLLOWING CONTEST IS SCHEDULED OR ONE FALL…. AND IS THE MATCH DUBBED “THE BEST IN THE WORLD VS. THE BEST EVER”, TO BE CONTESTED FOR THE HAAALLLLL OFFF FAAAAAAAME CHAMPIOOONNNSHIIIPPPPP!!!\n\n( “Feedback” by Kanye West hits. )\n\n( Smoke gathers at the top of the stage, and Mr. DEDEDE rushes through the smoke wearing his signature trenchcoat over his ring gear as he takes in the energy of the stadium. Tarah Nova walks out alongside him. )\n\nRing Announcer: INTRODUCING FIRST… ACCOMPANIED BY TARAH NOVA; FROM DENVER, COLORADO, WEIGHING IN TONIGHT AT 224 POOOOOOUUNNNNNDS….. “THE GAWD”, MMMMISSTEEEEEEEEEEEERRRRRRR DEEEEEEEEE DEEEEEEEEEEE DEEEEEEEEEEEEE!!!!\n\n( DDD stops at the center of the ramp and throws up his double corna taunt as pyro rockets up from the stage, and fireworks shoot up from the top of the stadium and into the sky. Following this, DDD and Tarah continue their way to the ring. )\n\nKawajai: BY MANY ACCOUNTS, HE IS THE BEST EVER. MAKING HIS NINTH STRAIGHT PAIN FOR PRIDE APPEARANCE, A 6 TIME WORLD CHAMPION, 6 TIME MATCH OF THE YEAR AWARD WINNER, TWO TIME ELITIST OF THE YEAR, AND POSSIBLY THE BIGGEST REASON THERE IS A PAIN FOR PRIDE 9! I COULDN’T IMAGINE ANY BETTER WAY TO START THIS TREMENDOUS SPECTACLE, THAN WITH THE GAWD!\n\nMercer: He’s said he’s more prepared for this match than he’s been for any other match in his career! The accolades cannot be ignored, the greatness cannot be denied, but it is a steep, steep hill for this man to climb tonight. How deep into the will is Mr. DEDEDE going to have to go in order to leave Pain for Pride as Hall of Fame Champion, and better than the Best in the World???\n\n(DEDEDE stands in the ring with his eyes locked up the ramp as the lights slowly shut down throughout the arena as a single spotlight shines down onto the center of the stage. A shroud of white smoke begins to cover the stage and the ramp as a piano with Steven Tyler seated in front of it begins to rise through the stage. He begins to play as the lights throughout the arena suddenly turn back on, revealing glass statues of HRDO, Jaywalker, CM Banks, Lethal Consequences, Y2Impact and the Heart Break Gal.)\n\n“Everytime that I look in the mirror…”\n\n“All these lines in the face a getting clearer…”\n\n“The past is gone….”\n\n“It went back like, dust to dawn…”\n\n(“Dream On” continues to play as Xavier Williams slowly makes his way through the curtain to a THUNDEROUS amount of both cheers and jeers with a sledgehammer in hand.)\n\n“Isn’t that the way…”\n\n“Everybody’s got their dues in life to pay…”\n\n(Xavier Williams stands next to the first statue: HRDO before smashing the sledgehammer through it and it shatters.)\n\n“I know, nobody knows, where it comes and where it goes…”\n\n“I know, everybody sins, you got to lose to know how to win…”\n\n(Xavier Williams slowly makes his way down to the next statue: Jaywalker, and once again it shatters. Xavier continues to makes his way through the statues, smashing through Banks, Lethal Consequences, Impact and HBG, before standing at the bottom of the ramp and dropping the hammer.)\n\nKawajai: All of the people that DDD has faced at past Pain for Pride’s…\n\nMercer: XAVIER WILLIAMS SENDING THE MESSAGE THAT THERE IS NO ONE FROM DEDEDE’S PAST THAT COMPARED TO WHAT STANDS BEFORE THE MAN NOW! THE BEST IN THE WORLD! THE HALL OF FAME CHAMPION! THE ALPHA! THE OMEGA! AND LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, IF YOU DIDN’T HEAR ME THE FIRST TIME LET ME SAY IT AGAIN!! THE BEST!! BEST!! BEST!! BEST IN THE WORLD!!\n\nRing Announcer: AND INTRODUCING THE CHAMPION FROM DETROIT, MICHIGAN, WEIGHING IN TONIGHT AT 215 POUNDS!!!! HE IS THE SELF PROFESSED “BEST IN THE WORLD!!”… HE IS THE REIGNING AND DEFENDING HALL OF FAME CHAMPION!!!!!! XAAAAAVVVVIIIEEEEEEERRRR WIIIIIIIIIILLLLLLLLIIIIAAAMMSSSSSS!!!!!\n\n(Xavier stands on the apron, both DEDEDE’s and the Hall of Fame Champion’s eyes locked on each other. Xavier Williams makes his way into the ring and slowly backs into his corner as “Dream On” cuts, leaving only the crowd’s atmosphere to be heard. Xavier Williams gives the Hall of Fame Championship one last kiss before handing it to the referee. The referee shows the championship to Mr. DEDEDE before making his way back to the middle of the ring and raising it high into the air. The referee hands the championship to the time keeper before calling for the bell.)\n\n(DING! DING! DING!)\n\nKawajai: The atmosphere I feel right now… it’s something that you only feel a few times in your life if you’re lucky. The first Elitist of the Year against the last Extremist of the Year. The Best in the World against The greatest performer that this business has ever known to lace up a pair of wrestling boots. Xavier Williams against Mr. DEDEDE… both men just standing in their respective corners, soaking every piece of this in. Both the Hall of Fame Champion and the six time World Champion slowly making their way to the middle of the ring, nose to nose; eye to eye. The two exchanging words, but I have no idea what they’re saying. Which man is going to throw the first punch… big smile crosses the face of Xavier Williams as Mr. DEDEDE as they take a step back and slowly begin to circle around the ring; I’ve been waiting for this from the moment that the match was announced. HERE WE GO! The two locking up and Mr. DEDEDE takes the advantage, twisting and wrenches the arm. Xavier dropping down to a knee as DEDEDE applies more pressure, but Xavier beautifully transitions into a hammerlock! DEDEDE wasting no time, firing back with an elbow to the side of the head, stunning the Hall of Fame Champion. DEDEDE with enough time to break free from the grip of Xavier Williams and transitions behind the champion. DEDEDE looking to take the Hall of Fame Champion down with a belly to back suplex, but Xavier’s able to land of his feet. DEDEDE turns around – STRAIGHT INTO A ROUNDHOUSE TO THE SIDE OF THE HEAD! No, DEDEDE just able to duck underneath and locks the waist! German Suplex! No, Xavier Williams uses his leg to block! Xavier swings back for an elbow of his own, but DEDEDE ducks underneath and tries to take the champion overhead with a Northern Lights Suplex, but Xavier hits him in the chest with a hard knee! Xavier able to fight his way back down to his feet and drives the point of his knee into the stomach of Mr. DEDEDE; Xavier looking to take DEDEDE down with a neckbreaker, but DEDEDE counters with a backslide!\n\nONE!!…\n\nMercer: Xavier using the momentum to roll through and takes control with a front facelock! DEDEDE trying to fight his way back to his feet, but Xavier drives the point of the knee into the top of the head. DEDEDE’s stunned as Xavier’s able to transitions around to the back of the former World Champion and isolates the right arm, driving his elbow into the top of the shoulder. DEDEDE trying to work his way into a seated position, but Xavier transitions back around into the front facelock and once again drives the point of the knee into the top of the head. Neither of these men seem to be willing to give their opponent and inch in this match. DEDEDE able to break the grip of Xavier Williams and twists out and applies a front facelock of his own. Xavier able to quickly fight his way up to a knee, but DEDEDE takes him down with a snap suplex! DEDEDE not releasing his grip, dragging a stunned Xavier Williams back up to his feet and transitions behind the champion! DEDEDE looking to send Xavier overhead with a German Suplex, but Xavier uses the leg to block again. DEDEDE driving Xavier chest first into the ropes and looks to roll back into a pin, but Xavier latches onto the top rope! The momentum sends DEDEDE back and he rolls through – STRAIGHT INTO A SUPERKICK! DEDEDE catches the leg and sweep the free one from under the champion! Dragon Screw! DEDEDE keeping a hold of that leg – SHARPSHOOTER!! DEDEDE LOOKING FOR A SHARPSHOOTER, BUT XAVIER QUICKLY DRAG HIMSELF TO THE BOTTOM ROPE! That devious hint of a smile crossing the face of the challenger as Xavier Williams rolls over to the corner. Xavier getting back to a knee as DEDEDE tells him he was that close to submitting the champion on the grandest stage of them all in the opening moments of this match.\n\nKawajai: I think that the champion is beginning to understand what he’s facing tonight; it’s nothing like anything he’s faced in the past. Xavier getting back to his feet and the two waste little time, locking up once more. This time it’s Xavier Williams who gains the advantage with a side headlock. DEDEDE quickly pushes Xavier into the ropes, gaining momentum and is able to free himself. Xavier hitting the ropes on the opposite side of the ring – and rebounds straight into back body drop! Xavier lands on his feet AND LIFTS DEDEDE UP ONTO HIS SHOULDERS THE MOMENT THAT HE TURNS AROUND!! GO TO SLEEP!! NO, DEDEDE JUST ABLE TO PUSH HIMSELF OFF THE BACK OF THE SHOULDERS OF THE CHAMPION!! A smile crossing the face of the champion as he’s more than willing to let the challenger know how close he was to putting that nail into the coffin. Neither Xavier Williams and Mr. DEDEDE able to gain complete control over the other. DEDEDE getting back to his feet and offers the Hall of Fame Champion a test of strength, which Xavier hesitantly accepts. The Hall of Fame Champion’s hand meeting DEDEDE’S, but DEDEDE cuts him off with a kick to the stomach! Xavier caught the leg! Xavier spins DEDEDE around AND CATCHES HIM FLUSH ON THE JAW WITH A BEAUTIFUL DROPKICK! DEDEDE rolling over to the corner, holding his jaw as Xavier Williams backs into the opposite. DEDEDE stumbles back to his feet AND XAVIER WILLIAMS CRUSHES HIM INTO THE CORNER WITH A RUNNING EUROPEAN UPPERCUT! DEDEDE trying to shake out of the cobwebs as he clutches onto the top ropes with both hands, obviously stunned. Xavier Williams with a standing European Uppercut to the cornered DEDEDE! Another! Another! Another! Four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten! Xavier Williams relentlessly fires away at the challenger before dragging him out of the corner and taking him down with a neckbreaker! Xavier Williams getting back to his feet as the arrogant smile returns to his face.\n\nMercer: Xavier Williams knows how good the man is and he’s not afraid to show it in the slightest! Xavier dropping an elbow to the heart of DEDEDE – it’s been awhile since we’ve seen the man do this! Repeated Elbow drops to the heart of the challenger! Xavier running his fingers through his hair as he takes a deep breathe, soaking in the atmosphere before leaping high into the air and dropping one last big time elbow straight to the chest of the six time World Champion! Xavier Williams holds his elbow across the chest for a pin, but DEDEDE gets the shoulder up before one. Perhaps the arrogance came to hurt the champion there. Xavier laughing as he gets back to his feet, shaking his head; DEDEDE pushing himself back to a vertical base as the Hall of Fame Champion stalks. DEDEDE’s up and he’s met by a stiff spinning back kick to the stomach! DEDEDE dropping back down to a knee and Xavier drives the bottom of his boot into the back of the head of the challenger with a Scissors Stomp! DEDEDE stumbling back to his feet – WHAT A DISCUS FOREARM TO THE JAW! DEDEDE stumbling back into the ropes as Xavier Williams looks to send him up and over with a clothesline!

XAVIER WILLIAMS TAKEN DOWN BY A FLYING DEDEDE AS THE REFEREE BEGINS TO COUNT!\n\nONE!!… TWO!!… THREE!!…\n\n(The camera cuts to a slow motion replay as Mr. DEDEDE leaping over the top rope and connecting with that Vintage DEDEDE.)\n\nKawajai: Both men are down; DEDEDE still obviously feeling the effects of the opening minutes of this matchup, but wastes as little time as he can, dragging the Hall of Fame Champion back up and rolls him back into the ring. DEDEDE shooting the half, but this time it’s Xavier Williams who gets the shoulder up before one. DEDEDE looking a little shocked, possibly believing that he was going to get a little more out of that pinning predicament. Xavier sitting up and DEDEDE applies a chinlock! Xavier trying to quickly push himself back to his feet and is able to do so. Xavier able to position himself behind the challenger and looks to take him down with a Back Suplex! DEDEDE flipping back and lands on his feet! DEDEDE falling back into the ropes as Xavier turns around – AND ALMOST HAS HIS TAKEN OFF FROM A BICYCLE KICK FROM THE CHALLENGER! Xavier falling down into a heap as Mr. DEDEDE slowly begins to circle the champion. DEDEDE driving the boot into the right arm of the Hall of Fame Champion. A boot to the right knee! A boot the left knee! Now one to the left arm! The hint of a smile returning the face of DEDEDE before he drops the knee across the bridge of the nose! DEDEDE looking to pick the champion apart! Xavier shaking his head as he rolls onto his stomach and pushes himself back onto his hands and knees.

DEDEDE grabbing the arm of the Hall of Fame Champion and whips Xavier Williams into the corner! DEDEDE lining up the champion and connects with a running forearm! Xavier Williams stumbles out of the corner as DEDEDE hits the ropes and takes him down with a spinning heel kick! Both Xavier Williams and DEDEDE thus far have been wrestling risk free; doing whatever they can to make sure that they don’t make the first mistake. Xavier Williams holding his jaw as DEDEDE shoots the half!\n\nONEEEEEEEEEEEEEE!!… TWOOOOOOO-KICKOUT!!\n\nMercer: Xavier Williams able to get the shoulder up just before two! The counter wrestling in this match has been nothing but outstanding, but DEDEDE has taken complete control. Xavier slowly rolling across the ring into the corner as DEDEDE stalks. Xavier pushes himself back to his feet and DEDEDE meets him with a stiff chop of the chest! DEDEDE grabbing the arm of the champion and whips him across the ring AND DRIVES THE SHOULDER INTO THE STOMACH OF THE HALL OF FAME CHAMPION LIKE AN ABSOLUTE FREIGHT TRAIN! NO, XAVIER JUST USES THE TOP ROPE TO PULL HIMSELF OUT OF THE WAY AND DEDEDE CRASHES SHOULDER FIRST INTO THE CORNER POST! DEDEDE caught in the corner before finally dropping to the outside; you can see by the look in the eyes of Xavier Williams, he’s found his opening. Xavier slowly rolling under the bottom rope as DEDEDE drags himself up as he clutches at that arm! DEDEDE’s back to a knee and Xavier Williams hits him with the shoulder with what may have been one of the hardest kicks I’ve seen in years!\n\nONE!… TWO!… THREE!… FOUR!…\n\nKawajai: DEDEDE almost curling over in pain, defiantly pushing himself back up, but Xavier with another unforgiving kick to that injured arm! DEDEDE almost curls over again, but still defiantly pushes himself back up – BUT XAVIER WILLIAMS GRABS HIM AND SENDS HIM CRASHING SHOULDER FIRST INTO THOSE STEEL STEPS! DEDEDE BOUNCES AWAY CLUTCHING AT THAT SHOULDER AS XAVIER WILLIAMS SLOWLY STALKS! Xavier dragging the steel steps out as DEDEDE uses that one good arm to pull himself back to his feet with the help of the barricade. Xavier Williams grabbing a handful of the challenger’s hair and pulls him up the steps! DEDEDE trying to fight away with a right hand to the midsection of the champion, but Xavier cuts him off with a European Uppercut which connects flush on the jaw. Xavier Williams pulls DEDEDE in and traps the arm in that inverted hammerlock BEFORE TAKING DEDEDE OVERHEAD WITH AN ARM TRAP SNAP SUPLEX OFF THE STEEL STEPS! XAVIER WILLIAMS HAS FOUND HIS OPENING AND LIKE A SHARK THAT SMELLS BLOOD, ATTACKS IT UNRELENTINGLY!\n\nFIVE!… SIX!…\n\nMercer: Xavier Williams getting back to a knee as DEDEDE rolls away while clutching onto that shoulder; Xavier rolls into the ring and back out, breaking the referee’s count.\n\nONE!… TWO!… THREE!… FOUR!…\n\nMercer: DEDEDE pushing himself back to a knee AND XAVIER WILLIAMS DRIVES BOTH FEET INTO THE SIDE OF MR. DEDEDE SENDING HIM SHOULDER FIRST INTO THE BARRICADE WITH A RUNNING FRONT DROPKICK! DEDEDE GRITTING HIS TEETH AS HE CONTINUES TO CLUTCH AT THAT SHOULDER; THERE HAS TO BE SERIOUS DAMAGE DONE! A DISLOCATED SHOULDER; A BROKEN ARM – XAVIER WILLIAMS HAS SEEMED TO COMPLETELY TAKE THAT RIGHT ARM OUT OF PLAY!\n\nFIVE!… SIX!… SEVEN!…\n\nKawajai: That sick smile crossing the face of the champion as he watches his challenger struggle in front of thousands. Xavier Williams grabbing the steel steps and slightly drags them out; DEDEDE using that one good arm to pull himself back up, but Xavier with another brutal kick to that right arm. Xavier grabbing the arm of DEDEDE and grabs him over to the steel steps… you can’t think he’s going to do what I think he is. NO – NO, DON’T DO IT XAVIER! WE SEEN HIM DO THIS TO JAMIE O’HARA BACK IN NOVEMBER! XAVIER TRAPPING THE ARM OF DEDEDE IN BETWEEN THE STEEL STEPS AND THAT STEEL RINGPOST! IF THERE ISN’T SERIOUS DAMAGE DONE TO THE ARM OF DEDEDE NOW, IT’S CERTAINLY GOING TO BE DONE IF XAVIER DOES THIS! THE REFEREE TRYING TO STOP XAVIER, BUT XAVIER PUSHES HIM ASIDE – AND DRIVES BOTH FEET INTO THE STEEL STEPS! DEDEDE’S ARM HAS TO BE BROKEN! NO! DEDEDE JUST, JUST ABLE TO PULL HIS ARM FREE! THERE WAS NOTHING MORE THAN INCHES IN IT!\n\n(The camera cuts to a replay of Xavier Williams trying to crush the arm of Mr. DEDEDE between the steel steps and the ringpost, and DEDEDE freeing himself just in time.)\n\nKawajai: You can see how close Xavier Williams was from doing some SERIOUS damage to the arm of the former six time World Champion! A scowl crossing the face of Xavier Williams as DEDEDE tries to get the blood flowing to that arm. Xavier Williams with ANOTHER kick to that arm, but this time DEDEDE fights through what has to be excruciating pain AND FIRES BACK WITH A STRAIGHT SLAP TO THE CHEST! MY GOD, I ALMOST FELT THAT ONE MYSELF! Xavier fires back with another kick BUT DEDEDE WITH ANOTHER STRAIGHT SLAP TO THE CHEST – YOU CAN ALREADY SEE SOME OF THE BLOOD VESSELS IN THE CHEST OF XAVIER WILLIAMS HAVE BROKEN! DEDEDE POPS UP WITH A HEADBUTT TO THE JAW! Xavier’s stunned and stumbles back into the steel steps – AND DEDEDE WITH A ROLLING BIG BOOT SENDING XAVIER CRASHING BACK OVER THE STEPS!\n\nEIGHT!… NINE!…\n\nMercer: DEDEDE just breaking the referee’s count and rolls back into the bottom rope to the outside.\n\nONE!… TWO!… THREE!… FOUR!…\n\nMercer: The back of Xavier Williams caught the edge of the steel steps as he fell backward; blood beginning to flow from a NASTY gash on his back. DEDEDE desperately trying to get that arm back to a point where it’s usable. That right arm just hangs – that shoulder has to be dislocated. DEDEDE hitting his own arm, trying to get some feeling back as Xavier Williams drags himself back up! BUT LOOK AT DEDEDE! DEDEDE CHARGES AND LEAPS OFF THE STEEL STEPS, TAKING THE HALL OF FAME CHAMPION WITH A CLOTHESLINE! NO! XAVIER CUTS HIM OFF WITH A DROPKICK STRAIGHT TO THAT ARM! DEDEDE LANDING BADLY; NO MATTER WHAT HE TRIES TO DO, XAVIER CUTS HIM STRAIGHT OFF! DEDEDE clutching straight back at the arm, slamming that good arm on that thin padding that covers the concrete flooring out of pure frustration.\n\nFIVE!… SIX!… SEVEN!… EIGHT!…\n\nKawajai: Xavier Williams making his way up onto the apron, the face that once carried that arrogant smirk as turned to a look of nothing less than pure focus and determination. DEDEDE uses that good arm to push himself back up to his feet AND THE MOMENT HE DOES, XAVIER WILLIAMS MEETS HIM WITH A SICKENING PENALTY KICK THAT CONNECTS DIRECTLY TO THE SIDE OF THE HEAD OF THE CHALLENGER! THE PURE VELOCITY BEHIND THAT KICK ALMOST CAUSING MR. DEDEDE TO LAND ON THE BACK OF HIS HEAD! Xavier breaking that count again, there’s absolutely no chance of the man taking a countout victory tonight. The hint of a smile crossing the face of Xavier Williams as he takes a look out at the thousands and thousands in attendance – AND XAVIER WILLIAMS CHARGES AND LEAPS OFF THE APRON, DRIVING BOTH FEET INTO THE CHEST OF THE CHALLENGER WITH A DOUBLE FOOTSTOMP!\n\nONE!… TWO!… THREE!…\n\nMercer: Xavier Williams dragging Mr. DEDEDE back to his feet and rolls him under the bottom rope; DEDEDE trying to push himself back up, BUT XAVIER WILLIAMS SLINGSHOTS OVER THE TOP ROPE AND BRINGS ALL THAT BODY WEIGHT DOES ACROSS THE CHEST WITH A HILO! All in the one motion shoots back back to his feet and hits the ropes AND DROPS A JUMPING ELBOW STRAIGHT TO THE HEART OF MR. DEDEDE! WHO WOULD HAVE THOUGHT THAT XAVIER WILLIAMS WOULD HAVE THIS KIND OF CONTROL OVER MR. DEDEDE ON THE STAGE DEDEDE HAS RULED FOR YEARS! Xavier Williams shooting the half!\n\nONEEEEEE!E!!! TWOOOOO-KICKOUT!\n\nMercer: DEDEDE getting the shoulder up just before two, but Xavier Williams hooks the injured arm and drives the point of the elbow into the top of the shoulder! DEDEDE trying to fight free, but this time Xavier Williams drives the elbow into the side of the ribs! DEDEDE yells out in pain AS XAVIER WILLIAMS TRIES TO TRANSITION INTO THAT CROSS ARMBREAKER! DEDEDE LOCKS THE HANDS, BUT YOU HAVE TO WONDER HOW MUCH STRENGTH HE HAS LEFT IN THAT ARM! DEDEDE pushing Xavier Williams back up onto his shoulders!\n\nONEEEEE!!!! TWOOOOO!!!\n\nKawajai: NO, XAVIER WILLIAMS IS ABLE TO BREAK THE GRIP OF DEDEDE AND USES HIS LEGS TO FORCE DEDEDE BACK DOWN TO THE CANVAS! DEDEDE IS TRAPPED! HE’S TRYING TO REACH OUT TO THE ROPES; COULD YOU IMAGINE IF MR. DEDEDE WAS FORCED TO SUBMIT AT PAIN FOR PRIDE! DEDEDE ROLLING BACK, BUT HE MAY HAVE JUST GIVEN XAVIER WILLIAMS EVEN MORE ROOM TO PULL THAT ARM BACK! THAT ARM COULD BREAK AT ANY MOMENT! DEDEDE ROLLS BACK FORWARD AND IS ABLE TO LOCK THE HANDS! DEDEDE PUSHING XAVIER BACK ONTO HIS SHOULDERS AGAIN!\n\nONEEEEEE!!!!! TWOOOOOO!!!!\n\nKawajai: OH MY!!! DEDEDE POWERS XAVIER WILLIAMS UP AND DRIVES HIM BACK DOWN INTO THE CANVAS!! THAT LOOKS TO HAVE HURT THAT HALL OF FAME CHAMPION, BUT HE REFUSES TO RELEASE THE ARM! DEDEDE POWERS XAVIER WILLIAMS BACK UP; YOU CAN SEE BY THE FACE OF DEDEDE, HE’S IN ABSOLUTE EXCRUCIATING PAIN – AND DEDEDE DRIVES THE HALL OF FAME CHAMPION BACK DOWN AND NOW XAVIER WILLIAMS RELEASES THE ARM! DEDEDE just rolling away clutching at that shoulder, finally given some breathing room and the chance to recover. Xavier already rolling onto his hands and knees and begins to push himself back to his feet. DEDEDE trying to do the same, but seems to be struggling. Xavier’s the first back to his feet as DEDEDE makes his way back to a knee AND AGAIN XAVIER WILLIAMS WITH ANOTHER VICIOUS KICK TO THE RIGHT ARM OF MR. DEDEDE! DEDEDE slamming his fist into the canvas as Xavier looks on shaking his head. DEDEDE defiantly pushing himself back up AND XAVIER WILLIAMS ALMOST SLAPS THE TASTE OUT OF HIS MOUTH!

A stunned Xavier Williams woozily stumbles out of the corner AND DEDEDE TAKES HIM DOWN WITH A RUNNING BIG BOOT! DEDEDE giving the Hall of Fame Champion no room to recover AND DROPS THE LEG ACROSS THE HEAD AND NECK OF XAVIER WILLIAMS! DEDEDE shooting the half!\n\nONEEEEE!!! TWOO–KICKOUT!\n\nMercer: Xavier Williams quickly getting the shoulder up BUT DEDEDE GRABS THE ARM AND USES IT TO TURN XAVIER ONTO HIS STOMACH! DEDEDE LOOKING FOR A CROSSFACE, BUT XAVIER WILLIAMS IS DOING EVERYTHING HE CAN TO BLOCK IT! DEDEDE HAS THE ARM TRAPS AND IS TRYING TO LOCK THOSE HANDS… AND DOES! CRIPPLER CROSSFACE IS LOCKED IN! MR. DEDEDE REARING BACK AT THE HEAD WITH THE HALL OF FAME CHAMPION, WHO’S FORCED TO ATTEMPT TO INCH HIMSELF CLOSER TO THE BOTTOM ROPE! XAVIER WILLIAMS TRYING TO DRAG HIMSELF ACROSS THE RING, INCH BY INCH AS DEDEDE APPLIES AS MUCH PRESSURE AS HE PHYSICALLY CAN! OH MY!! XAVIER WILLIAMS’ SPINE IS ALMOST BENDING LIKE A FREAKING ACCORDION! XAVIER WILLIAMS ROLLING DEDEDE OVER ONTO HIS SHOULDERS!\n\nONEEE!!!!! TWOOO!!!!\n\nKawajai: DEDEDE RELEASES THE HOLD AND THE TWO SCRAMBLE BACK TO THEIR FEET, BUT DEDEDE IS A STEP AHEAD! XAVIER WILLIAMS SWINGS FOR A WILD CLOTHESLINE, BUT DEDEDE DUCKS UNDERNEATH AND HITS THE BACK ROPE! XAVIER SWINGS WITH A BACK ELBOW BUT DEDEDE DUCKS UNDER AGAIN – AND DEDEDE TAKES THE CHAMPION DOWN WITH A VICIOUS LARIAT! NO, XAVIER WILLIAMS USES THE BOOT TO BLOCK THE LARIAT!

BOTH MEN ARE DOWN, BUT EVERY SINGLE PERSON IN THIS ARENA ARE ON THEIR FEET FOR THESE TWO MEN! Both men sitting up and take a look at each other; never man letting the other getting best of each other, and the scary part is that I don’t think this thing is even close to being finished, not while the two of them can still physically breathe. Both men dragging themselves back to their feet; Xavier’s up first and hits DEDEDE in the jaw with a forearm! DEDEDE fires back with one of his own! Xavier with another! DEDEDE fires back! Xavier! DEDEDE! Xavier! DEDEDE! XAVIER! DEDEDE! XAVIER! DEDEDE! THESE TWO MEN JUST FIRING AWAY; NEITHER MEN GOING TO STOP UNTIL THE OTHER FALLS! XAVIER! DEDEDE! XAVIER! XAVIER! XAVIER! XAVIER!

DEDEDE’s hung up on the top rope as Xavier Williams regains his bearings; these two men going at one hundred miles an hour!\n\nMercer: Xavier making his way back up to the middle rope as DEDEDE tries to push himself up, shaking his head, obviously dazed. Xavier Williams lifting DEDEDE back up and hits him with a forearm, and then a European uppercut. Xavier Williams takes a look out at the thousands in attendance as the hint of a smile crosses his face. DEDEDE seated up on the top as Xavier moves up one more step!

DEDEDE HOLDS THE PIN!\n\nONEEEEEEE!!!!!! TWOOOOOOOOOO!!!!!!! THREEEEEEEEE—KICKOUT!!!\n\nMercer: NO, XAVIER KICKS OUT! XAVIER WILLIAMS JUST GETS THE SHOULDER UP BEFORE THREE!!\n\n(A replay of a birdseye view of the Sitout Powerbomb and kickout is shown. DEDEDE just lies back as Xavier rolls onto his stomach.)\n\nMercer: What is willing these two men on; it doesn’t seem to matter what the other does, they continue to dig deeper and deeper. DEDEDE pushing himself back to his feet as Xavier Williams slowly, gingerly pushes himself back to his hands and knees. DEDEDE making his way into the corner, that arm doesn’t seem to be giving him the same trouble that it once did. DEDEDE stalks, we all know what he has in mind, but this time it seems different. There are few times throughout his entire career that I’ve seen Mr. DEDEDE THIS focused. He man staring a hole through the Hall of Fame Champion as he wills himself back to his feet. Stay down, Xavier! You’re not going to like what’s waiting for you! XAVIER’S UP! SPEEEEAAARRRR!!!!! NO, XAVIER CAUGHT HIM IN THAT FRONT FACELOCK AGAIN!! BUT THIS TIME DEDEDE SAW IT COMING AND TWISTS OUT OF IT BEFORE THE HALL OF FAME CHAMPION CAN TAKE HIM DOWN! DIAMOND CUTTER!! NO!! XAVIER WILLIAMS CUTS HIM OFF– SLEEPER HOLD!

THIS TIME IT CONNECTS! DEDEDE FLOATING BACK OVER AND HOOKS THE LEGS OF XAVIER WILLIAMS! DEDEDE ARCHING BACK… METH LOCK! XAVIER WILLIAMS IS TRAPPED IN THAT METH LOCK! DEDEDE PULLING BACK AT THE HEAD OF XAVIER WILLIAMS WITH EVERYTHING HE HAS! XAVIER WILLIAMS REFUSING TO QUIT; THE MAN SAID IT HIMSELF! XAVIER WILLIAMS WOULD RATHER DIE THAN LOSE TO DEDEDE TONIGHT! BUT XAVIER HAS A LONG WAY TO GO AND I DON’T KNOW TOO MANY MEN THAT COULD ENDURE THIS MOVE FOR TOO LONG! XAVIER WILLIAMS INCHES HIMSELF CLOSER TO THE ROPES; EACH SCRATCH, EACH CLAW GETTING SMALLER AND SMALLER! XAVIER’S STARTING TO FADE; THE PAIN MAY BE TOO MUCH!\n\nMercer: COME ON, XAVIER!! YOU CAN’T LOSE LIKE THIS!! YOU’RE THE BEST IN THE WORLD!! THE BEST IN THE WORLD DOESN’T GIVE UP!! FIGHT!!\n\nKawajai: XAVIER WILLIAMS LOOKS TO BE OUT!! WE COULD BE ABOUT TO CROWN A NEW CHAMPION! DEDEDE APPLYING EVEN MORE PRESSURE AS THE REFEREE RAISES THE ARM OF XAVIER WILLIAMS!!!\n\nONEEEEEEEEEEEEE!!!!!!!!!!\n\nKawajai: IT DROPS!! XAVIER WILLIAMS IS LIFELESS!!

HE GETS ONE FREAKING FINGER ON THE BOTTOM ROPE AND DEDEDE IS FORCED TO RELEASE THAT METH LOCK!!\n\nKawajai: How much did that just take out of the champion; the man COULDN’T have any more in the tank, and I think that Mr. DEDEDE knows that. DEDEDE pushing himself back up onto his knees as the arm of Xavier Williams drops back down to the canvas, both men absolutely exhausted. Xavier Williams slowly, slowly pushing himself back up onto his hands and knees as DEDEDE just stands over the champion. DEDEDE telling the champion to stay down, that this fight is over, but I can’t see Xavier Williams waving up the white flag, not after what the two of these men have been through tonight. One man is walking out of this. Xavier Williams grabbing the tights of DEDEDE, using them to drag himself back up. DEDEDE grabbing a handful of the hair of the Hall of Fame Champion, lifting Xavier Williams back up – WAIT A MINUTE, XAVIER WILLIAMS PUSHES DEDEDE AWAY! SUPERKICK?! NO, DEDEDE SEEN IT COMING, CATCHING THE BOOT OF THE CHAMPION AND SWINGS HIM AROUND! SPINNING BACKFIST! DEDEDE CONNECTS FLUSH WITH A SPINNING BACKFIST TO THE JAW; XAVIER FALLING BACK INTO THE ROPES, THE ONLY THING KEEPING THE MAN STANDING, BUT HE REBOUNDS STRAIGHT INTO A ROUNDHOUSE KICK! NO, XAVIER WILLIAMS DUCKS UNDERNEATH— ROLLING ELBOW!!!! XAVIER WILLIAMS WITH A ROLLING ELBOW TO THE BACK OF THE SKULL – THE HALL OF FAME CHAMPION PUT EVERYTHING HE HAD INTO THAT ONE!\n\nMercer: XAVIER WILLIAMS DOESN’T ALLOW THE CHALLENGER TO FALL, PULLING HIM IN! REGALPLEX! MR. DEDEDE DROPPED RIGHT ON THE TOP OF HIS HEAD! XAVIER WILLIAMS PUSHING HIMSELF BACK TO HIS FEET AND LOOK AT THE EYES OF THE CHAMPION! THEY’RE THE EYES OF A MAD MAN! SOMEHOW DEDEDE PUSHES HIMSELF BACK UP ONTO HIS HANDS AND KNEES – AND XAVIER WILLIAMS PUNTS HIM RIGHT ON THE TOP OF THE HEAD WITH THAT HEADSHOT! THE FORCE PUSHES DEDEDE BACK UP ONTO HIS KNEES, BUT HE LOOKS STUNNED, POSSIBLE OUT OF IT! XAVIER WILLIAMS POWERS DEDEDE UP AND TAKES HIM OVER WITH THAT NORTHERN LIGHTS SUPLEX! XAVIER FLOATS BACK OVER AND… THE STRENGTH OF THIS MAN SHOCKS ME EVERY TIME I SEE HIM DO THIS!! XAVIER WILLIAMS DEADLIFTING MR. DEDEDE BACK UP INTO THE AIR AND DRIVES HIM BACK DOWN WITH THAT SHEERDROP BRAINBUSTER! BOTH MEN JUST LYING THERE… AND XAVIER WILLIAMS KIPS BACK UP TO HIS FEET!! XAVIER WILLIAMS DEMANDING, SCREAMING, BEGGING DEDEDE TO GET BACK UP, BUT I DON’T KNOW IF THE MAN PHYSICALLY CAN! DEDEDE TRYING TO SIT UP, BUT HE JUST FALLS BACK DOWN ON HIS SIDE, THE MAN IS ABSOLUTELY SPENT!! XAVIER WILLIAMS SPACES BACK AND FORTH, HE CAN TASTE IT!! HE KNOWS THAT HE HAS DEDEDE ON THE EDGE!! DEDEDE SLOWLY, SLOWLY, SLOWLY PUSHING HIMSELF UP ONTO HIS HANDS AND KNEES!!\n\nKawajai: XAVIER WILLIAMS GRABBING DEDEDE AND DRAGS HIM BACK UP ONTO HIS KNEES!!\n\nXavier: That’s God.\n\nKawajai: KING’S FALL!!!!!!! WHAT A SUPERKICK TO THE FORMER SIX TIME WORLD CHAMPION!!! XAVIER WILLIAMS HOOKS BOTH LEGS!!!!!\n\nONEEEEEEEEEEE!!!!!!!!! TWOOOOOOOOOOOOO!!!!!! THREEEEEEEEEEEE!!!!!\n\nKICKOUT!!!!!!\n\nKawajai: WHAT?! DEDEDE KICKED OUT?!\n\n(The crowd roars as Xavier Williams stares at DEDEDE in complete disbelief as he slowly pushes himself back and sits in the corner.)\n\nKawajai: THE FACIAL EXPRESSION ACROSS THE FACE OF THE HALL OF FAME CHAMPION TELLS THE ENTIRE STORY!! XAVIER WILLIAMS HIT DEDEDE WITH HIS BEST SHOT AND IT WASN’T ENOUGH TO KEEP THE MAN DOWN!! DEDEDE SAID THAT WE WERE GOING TO GET MORE THAN WE THOUGHT POSSIBLE TONIGHT – HE SAID THAT HE WAS GOING TO BE SUPERHUMAN AND I DO NOT DOUBT IT IN THE SLIGHTEST!! Xavier just shakes his head, I think what the man faces tonight has just finally began to set in. Xavier Williams is going to have to go above and beyond to walk out with that Hall of Fame Champion; to walk out as undoubtedly, the Best in the World. DEDEDE slowly rolling onto his stomach and tries to push himself back up onto his hands and knees. I don’t know what’s keeping this man going, but at this point I don’t know what’s going to keep this man down. Blood dripping from the mouth of the challenger… and he’s laughing? DEDEDE turning his head towards the champion and laughs through that bloodstained smile. It’s as if he’s asking the champion if that’s the best he’s got. Xavier reaches up and grabs the top rope, pulling himself back up to his feet as DEDEDE forces himself back to a knee. Xavier Williams slowly walking towards the champion.\n\nXavier: Stay down.\n\nKawajai: Xavier Williams places his boot across the side of the head of DEDEDE and pushes him back down. DEDEDE defiantly pushing himself back up to his hands and knees again, but again Xavier Williams uses the boot to push himself back down.\n\nXavier: Stay down.\n\nKawajai: Xavier Williams shaking his head, DEDEDE refuses to stay down as Xavier reaches down and grabs a handful of the challenger’s hair and pulls him up to his feet – AND DEDEDE WITH AN OPEN HANDED SLAP TO THE FACE OF THE HALL OF FAME CHAMPION!\n\nMercer: HE MAY HAVE JUST MADE THE BIGGEST MISTAKE OF THE MAN’S STORIED CAREER! XAVIER WILLIAMS HAS SNAPPED; XAVIER DRAGGED DEDEDE BACK TO HIS FEET AND BEGINS TO DRIVES THAT KNEE INTO THE STOMACH OF THE CHALLENGER! XAVIER WILLIAMS WITH A SPINNING BACKHAND WITH THE LEFT AND SWINGS HIS RIGHT ELBOW BACK, CONNECTING FLUSH TO THE SIDE OF THE HEAD!! XAVIER FOLLOWS IT UP WITH A STIFF KICK TO THE STOMACH – AND THEN ALMOST TAKES DEDEDE’S HEAD OFF WITH A SWINGING ENZIGURI! DEDEDE DUCKS AND XAVIER WILLIAMS HITS THE CANVAS; XAVIER SCRAMBLING BACK TO HIS FEET, BUT THE MOMENT HE DOES DEDEDE SWEEPS HIS LEGS FROM UNDER HIM!! DEDEDE LOOKING FOR THAT INVERTED SHARPSHOOTER, BUT XAVIER WILLIAMS IS FIGHTING IT! BOOT TO THE SIDE OF THE HEAD OF THE CHALLENGER! ANOTHER! DEDEDE STUMBLING BACK INTO THE ROPES, THEY KEEP HIM STANDING AS XAVIER SHOOTS BACK UP! DEDEDE SWINGS FOR A WILD CLOTHESLINE, BUT XAVIER DUCKS UNDERNEATH AND CATCHES THE ARM, SWINGING HIM AROUND!! XAVIER LIFTING DEDEDE UP ONTO HIS SHOULDERS!!!! HE HAS HIM SET!!! GO TO SLEEP!!!!! NO, DEDEDE FIGHTING IT!! ELBOW! ELBOW! ELBOW! ANOTHER! ANOTHER! DEDEDE FIGHTING IT WITH EVERYTHING HE CAN PHYSICALLY MUSTER! XAVIER DROPPING DOWN TO A KNEE AS DEDEDE SLIDING BACK DOWN ONTO HIS FEET! XAVIER WILLIAMS STUMBLES BACK UP TO A VERTICAL BASE! THE CHAMPION IS STUNNED – AND DEDEDE DRIVES THE BACK OF HIS KNEE INTO THE BACK OF THE SKULL OF THE HALL OF CHAMPION!!\n\nKawajai: THIS IS DEDEDE’S OPENING!! XAVIER WILLIAMS COULD BE OUT ON HIS FEET!! OH MY GOD!! SPEAR!! SPEAR!! SPEEEEAAAARRRR!!!!!!! DEDEDE LIKE A FREIGHT TRAIN, ALMOST BREAKING THE HALL OF FAME CHAMPION IN HALF! I DON’T THINK THAT I’VE SEEN DEDEDE HIT THAT SPEAR AS IMPACTFULLY IN MY LIFE!! DEDEDE NEEDS TO COVER, BUT THAT LOOKS TO HAVE BEEN THE LAST THING IN THE TANK!! BOTH MEN ARE DOWN; NEITHER MAN HAS MOVED AN INCH!! THE REFEREE DOESN’T KNOW WHAT TO DO!! BOTH THESE MEN HAVE LEFT ABSOLUTELY EVERYTHING OUT THERE TONIGHT AND GOD KNOWS WE DON’T WHAT TO SEE THIS THING END BY A COUNTOUT!! THE REFEREE FORCED TO BEGIN THE COUNT!!\n\nONE!!…. TWO!!… THREE!!…\n\nKawajai: DEDEDE SLOWLY, SLOWLY BEGINNING TO STIR; THE HALL OF FAME CHAMPION HASN’T MOVED A MUSCLE SINCE THAT SPEAR!! DEDEDE ROLLING ONTO HIS STOMACH, TRYING TO DRAG HIMSELF INTO THE COVER, BUT HE DOESN’T SEEM TO HAVE THE STRENGTH LEFT!\n\nFOUR!!… FIVE!!…\n\nMercer: XAVIER WILLIAMS FINALLY BEGINNING TO STIR AS DEDEDE REACH OUT, BUT HE’S STILL TOO FAR AWAY TO DRAG HIMSELF INTO THE COVER!! I can’t believe this… Xavier Williams rolls onto his stomach; whether he still has enough wherewithal, or whether it was just instinct, it’s stopped the challenger from capitalizing on one hell of a spear! DEDEDE trying to pushes himself up to his hands and knees as the Hall of Fame Champion pushes himself onto his own. DEDEDE forcing himself onto his knees as Xavier tries to do the same, but clutches down at his ribs. What damage did that spear do? Xavier finally getting back to his feet and DEDEDE meets him with a forearm! Xavier with one of his own! DEDEDE with another! Xavier with another! DEDEDE! Xavier! DEDEDE! Xavier! DEDEDE! Xavier! These two men firing away again! Both men fighting back to their feet as this war for control continues! No matter what they’re going through; no matter the pain, neither man willing to back down or surrender! DEDEDE with a HUGE shot that rocks the champion! Xavier falling back into the ropes and fires back with a STIFF shot of his own! DEDEDE falling back into the ropes and fires back with another! The ropes the only thing seemingly keeping both men upright! Xavier looks to fire back with another – BUT DEDEDE CUTS HIM OFF WITH ANOTHER FOREARM! ANOTHER FOREARM! FOUR! FIVE! SIX! SEVEN! EIGHT! NINE! TEN!\n\nKawajai: DEDEDE JUST FIRING AWAY AT THE DEFENSELESS CHAMPION! Xavier Williams is on jelly legs as DEDEDE lines him in up AND ALMOST KNOCKS THE HALL OF FAME CHAMPIONS TEETH DOWN HIS THROAT WITH A ROARING ELBOW! SUPERKICK?! XAVIER WILLIAMS CUT HIM OFF WITH A SUPERKICK! SOMEHOW DEDEDE REMAINS ON HIS FEET— END OF HEARTACHE!! ZIG ZAG TO MR. DEDEDE!! DEDEDE BLOCKS IT!!

DEDEDE IS ALMOST PULLING HIS HAIR OUT; HE THOUGHT IT WAS THREE, I THOUGHT IT WAS THREE, BUT THE HALL OF FAME CHAMPION MANAGED TO FIND SOMETHING TO WILL THAT SHOULDER UP!! DEDEDE just sitting there; he reached deep down into his bag of tricks with that Bottomless Elbow, what more is the man going to have to do. DEDEDE looking over at the corner, possible thinking of the one of the few things that has brought him so much justice in the past. Xavier Williams’ eyes completely glazed over as he slowly begins to stir; DEDEDE making his way back to his feet and calls the champion back to his feet.\n\nMercer: I never once thought that I would say it, but you can feel the Hall of Fame Championship slipping from the hands of Xavier Williams. You can feel that claim of being the Best in the World being ripped away. Both men have left absolutely EVERYTHING out there tonight and they both have to be one big move away from this thing being over. DEDEDE almost stoic; the man is completely focused, blocking out everything around him. This is what the man has made a career out of – moments like this, matches like this. Heart, determination, everything that has made DEDEDE great throughout his entire career showcased on the biggest stage of them all. Xavier Williams gingerly making his way back to a knee as DEDEDE drags him back to his feet AND DROPS HIM BACK DOWN WITH ANOTHER GRAND SLAM!!! THIS HAS TO BE OVER, BUT DEDEDE DOESN’T GO FOR THE PIN, INSTEAD SLOWLY ROLLING UNDER THE BOTTOM ROPE ONTO THE APRON!! DEDEDE WANTS TO MAKE SURE THAT THE MAN STAYS DOWN; DEDEDE WANTS TO PUT THAT FINAL NAIL INTO THE CASKET!! DEDEDE DRAGGING HIMSELF BACK UP AND NOW HAS TO MAKE THAT LONG CLIMB TO THE TOP!! DEDEDE FORCING HIMSELF UP, EACH STEP MORE DIFFICULT THAN THE LAST!! DEDEDE FINALLY GETS TO THE TOP AND GAINS HIS BALANCE!! THE CHALLENGER HUFFING, PUFFING, WHEEZING AS THE HINT OF A SMILE CROSSES HIS FACE!! HE CAN TASTE IT!! THE CHAMPION HASN’T MOVED AN INCH!! OH MY GOD!! OH MY GOD!! OH MY GOOOOOODDDD!!!! CORKSCREW!!! NORTH!!! STAR!!!!! CORKSCREW SHOOTING STAR PRESS!!!\n\nKawajai: XAVIER ROLLS OUT OF THE WAY, BUT DEDEDE LANDS ON HIS FEET!! XAVIER WILLIAMS SHOOTING BACK UP AS DEDEDE TURNS AROUND — WIDOWMAKER!!!!!! DEDEDE DODGES!! XAVIER TURNING AROUND AS DEDEDE HITS THE ROPES… SPEAR!! SPEAR!! SPEAR!! DEDEDE ALMOST CUTTING XAVIER WILLIAMS IN HALF WITH EVERYTHING HE CAN STILL PHYSICALLY MUSTER!! DEDEDE HOOKS THE LEG!!\n\nONEEEEEEE!!!!! TWOOOOOOOO!!!!!! THREEEEEEEEE!!!!!!\n\n(DING! DING! DING!)\n\n(“Feedback” – Kanye West hits as Mr. DEDEDE slowly rolls off of Xavier Williams and is handed the Hall of Fame Championship.)\n\nKawajai: HE DID IT!!!! HE DID IT!! MR. DEDEDE IS THE NEW HALL OF FAME CHAMPION!!\n\nRing Announcer: THE WINNER OF THIS MATCH…. AND THE NEWWWWWWWWW HALL OF FAME CHAMPION!!!!!!!! MISTER… DE… DE… DE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!\n\n( Tarah Nova rushes into the ring to hug and kiss a weary, barely conscious Mr. DEDEDE. DDD does all he can to struggle to his feet, and the ref raises his arm as he raises the HOF title with his other arm. )\n\nMercer: NO!! HOW?! XAVIER WILLIAMS IS THE BEST IN THE… HE COULDN’T HAVE LOST!!\n\nKawajai: NOT ANYMORE, MERCER!! YOUR MAN – YOUR GUY, THE SELF PROFESSED “BEST IN THE WORLD” HAS FALLEN AGAINST THE GAWD ON THE GRANDEST STAGE OF THEM ALL!! XAVIER HAS LOST THE HALL OF FAME CHAMPION, BUT MORE IMPORTANTLY THE THING HE SAID HE CHERISHED MORE THAN ANYTHING!! THAT TITLE – THE RIGHT TO CALL HIMSELF THE BEST IN THE WORLD HAS DIED TONIGHT IN FRONT OF MILLIONS!!\n\n(DEDEDE stands on the turnbuckle as Xavier Williams painfully pushes himself back into the corner, physically frustrated as he drops his head.)\n\nKawajai: You can see in the face of the former champion of how much this actually meant to the man; a year of preparation leading to the man falling inches short.\n\n(Xavier drags himself under the bottom rope and begins to limp back up the ramp as DEDEDE looks on. Xavier looks back over his shoulder as DEDEDE raises the Hall of Fame Championship before continuing to make his leave with Tarah.)\n\nMercer: I can’t believe this…\n\nKawajai: WHAT AN OPENING TO THE FIRST DAY OF PAIN FOR PRIDE, AS WE OPEN THE SHOW WITH THIS INSTANT CLASSIC, AND A VICTORY FROM THE BEST EVER! AND LADIES AND GENTLEMEN IF THAT WAS ANYTHING TO GO BY, THIS EVENT MAY GO DOWN AS THE GREATEST EVER!!\n\n(DEDEDE continues to celebrate as Xavier Williams walks backstage before cutting away.)\n\n(The camera transitions backstage to an uncomfortable-looking Max A. Million, dressed in a suit with a microphone in hand as he stands in front of a large Pain For Pride background)\n\nMax: Welcome, everyone, to Pain For Pride 9… I’m… I’m here with…\n\n(The camera slowly zooms out to reveal Drake Jaeger and Tiberius Jones – both wearing bath robes – standing on both sides of Max as they impatiently stare at him)\n\nMax: I’m standing here with–\n\n(Drake quickly snatches the microphone from Max’s hand, staring at him intently)\n\nDrake: You need to work on your introductions, Max. I recommend not looking like you’re one bad break-up away from offing yourself. It’s Pain For Pride! TJ, how are YOU feeling?\n\n(Drake thrusts the microphone back into Max’s hand and moves the microphone-in-hand over to Tiberius)\n\nTiberius: I’m feeling extremely sweaty, thank you for asking.\n\nDrake: Right? This town is Goddamn BROILING, I swear.\n\nMax: Well… You’re both wearing bath robes, so–\n\nDrake: So what? You think we’re wearing these to start a new fashion trend?\n\n(Drake and Tiberius look at each other for a moment before looking back at Max)\n\nDrake: That’s not actually a bad idea, but that’s NOT why we’re wearing them tonight. Max, I don’t know if you know this, but we’ve got an entire fanbase that relishes the thought of what we might show up in at a show this big. We wouldn’t want to spoil the surprise, now would we?\n\nMax: Uh huh… And what about Judas?\n\nDrake: I don’t think I understand the question.\n\nMax: Where’s Judas?\n\n(Drake’s begins to look confused)\n\nDrake: Where’s Judas? How the Hell should I know? He’s probably in the bowels of the building, watching The Crow on blu-ray.\n\nTiberius: Or listening to My Chemical Romance CDs.\n\nDrake: I bet he only plays Reaper in Overwatch too. You know, Judas is doing whatever people like Judas do.\n\nMax: And you’re fine just talking about him like that?\n\nDrake: What, it’s not like he’s here.\n\n(Drake starts to cautiously look around)\n\nDrake: He’s NOT here though, right? You said he wouldn’t be here, T-Dogg.\n\nTiberius: Relax, relax, Judas isn’t here, but I’m sure wherever he is, he’s getting ready. He’s every bit as prepared as we are. He’s got a National Elite Championship to defend and we’ve got Tag Team Titles to take back.\n\nMax: So you’re both ready for what’s to come tonight? There’s a lot of people who would find a match like this daunting.\n\nDrake: And that’s why I don’t like a lot of people, Max.\n\nMax: And seeing how all of this began when you two retired the Heart Break Boy, and then you both got involved in The Pizza Boy’s National Elite Title match at Triple Threat, causing him to lose – you can only imagine how much he wants to get his hands on you.\n\nTiberius: And you know what? We WELCOME it. We weren’t afraid of the Pizza Boy then, and we aren’t afraid of The Pizza Boy now. You think a looking a little banged up and attacking people with weapons is gonna change anything? You know what it certainly won’t change? His size. It won’t change the fact that he’s still a scrawny, hundred-pound little pissant that doesn’t belong in the same ring as us.\n\nDrake: Yeah, besides… We’ve got a secret weapon.\n\nMax: … You do?\n\nDrake: Yeah, yeah…\n\n(Drake leans in)\n\nDrake: What if I told you… The Heart Break Boy himself… Is on OUR side?\n\n(Max’s eyes widen)\n\nMax: No way…\n\nDrake: Yes way… You want proof?\n\nMax: Sure, I guess.\n\n(Drake smiles and nods as he goes off-camera for a moment. Max looks off to the side with an exasperated look)\n\nMax: … Seriously?\n\n(A proud Drake Jaeger steps back into view of the camera, holding up a table with a crudely-painted caricature of the Heart Break Boy on the surface of it)\n\nDrake: Here he is! Feast your eyes!\n\nTiberius: But wait! There’s more!\n\n(Max sighs as Tiberius goes off-camera and quickly returns with a thick table that has a painting of Judas, Drake Jaeger, and Tiberius Jones murdering Brian Daniels, Cyclone, and The Pizza Boy)\n\nDrake: The Sistine Chapel, the Mona Lisa, and now this! You’re a master of your craft, Ti!\n\n(Tiberius proudly looks at the painting on the surface of the table, knocking hard on it)\n\nTiberius: And that’s oak, baby! Thick as a Goddamn milkshake! Anyone that goes through this won’t be going through it alive!\n\nDrake: I love it!\n\nMax: Isn’t this a bit much, guys?\n\nDrake: A bit much? A bit MUCH? Max, I don’t think it’s enough! Don’t go doubting us now! Don’t kill our buzz! We–\n\n(A curious Drake puts his ear up to to the caricature of the Heart Break Boy on his table)\n\nDrake: What’s that, HBB? Wha–ohh boy! Oh boy!\n\n(Drake starts to overdramatically shake the table)\n\nDrake: He’s feeling it, Max! He’s feeling the power of the LAWD! The voice of God himself is speaking through him, Max! He’s telling me we’ve got to prove our loyalty! We’ve got to show that we too are good, honest, God-fearing Christian boys! We’ve got to put someone through these tables tonight and help send them on their way to meet the big ghost man in the sky himself! Oh laaawd! I’m feeling it, Max!\n\nTiberius: Praise Jeebus! Praise the Holy Poltergeist! And we’ve even got a Judas with us! It’s all coming together, Max! You’re witnessing the start of a new book of Genesis!\n\nDrake: And God said “Let their be asskicking, and it was GOOD!” Let’s show them our newfound faith! For our own dearly departed Heart Break Boy!\n\nTiberius: For the Heart Break Boy!\n\nDrake & Jones: Amen!\n\n(Drake and Tiberius rush off, leaving a confused Max A. Million behind as he looks on)\n\n(The camera transitions back to the packed New Miami Stadium)\n\nRing Announcer: The following contest is a tag team match and it is scheduled for one fall!\n\n(The lights in the arena shift off as a hush falls upon the crowd. As the lights begin to blink, a sickly yellow color fills the arena and the sound of children laughing can be heard. The titantron flickers for an instant before cutting on as a swing set can be seen, a child wearing a porcelain doll mask is on it swinging.)\n\nChild: Are you afraid?\n\n(Her voice echoes into the night as the camera seems to glitch, when the screen reappears there is nothing left but a tattered cloth hanging on the swing itself. The image transitions to a crossroads for a split second before cutting to the playground once more, as two children play on a seesaw, both faces obscured by the porcelain doll mask, though these are decidedly more blood covered.)\n\nChild: Are you afraid?\n\nChild: Are you afraid?\n\n(They look at the camera and once more the camera itself seems to glitch before the image reappears, cloth draped across the seesaw itself. The crossroads image appears once more, a rocking chair rocking back and forth on it as lightning cracks across the sky. The image cuts out again, this time replaced with a familiar sight. The stage ramp itself. A red light picks up, illuminating not only Jocelyn in a blood soaked porcelain mask, but Oz in a Plague Doctor’s mask, Elise in a broken Queen’s Crown and helm, and Toby in deep red face paint. The group of children all lift up a vial that they hold, roiling with sickly yellow liquid. The titantron cuts to the crossroad image one last time, as lightning cracks across it, illuminating Eclipse. He leans forward in the chair, grinning at the camera.)\n\nEclipse: Everyone…scared yet?\n\n(Lightning cracks again and the children throw the vials to the ground, the entire stage filling with the roiling yellow smoke as the lights switch off. There is nothing but silence, until…)\n\nTech N9ne: I’M HELLA MIXED UP YES I KNOW, A LOT OF GOOD AND BAD STUFF AS I GROW, SO NOW THAT I GOTTA LIVE LIFE WITH BOTH ALL I CAN SAY\n\n(The lights quickly switch over to a bright red as Tech N9ne races out from the yellow smoke, looking out as the crowd goes ballistic.)\n\nTech N9ne: WHAT’S MY NAME?!\n\nCrowd: EBAH!\n\n(EBAH by Tech N9ne plays)\n\n(As Tech begins to perform EBAH for the crowd, Eclipse’s figure steps out from the back, his body garbed in tattered robes and a crown of skulls and barbed wire fitted upon his head. His face is marked with facepaint, spelling out the word: FEAR in bold letters, which seem to resemble a true skull. In all accounts, he appears to the world as the primordial god of fear in every sense. He steps out onto the stage, bowing his head to the audience before slamming his fists into the ground, pyro erupting all around the arena as he rears his head back, roaring up at the sky.)\n\nRing Announcer: Introducing first from Prescott Hills Sanitarium, Arizona! Weighing in at 286 pounds! He is the EAW 2016 King of Elite….”The Bleeding Smile”…….ECLIPSEEEEE DIEMMMOOOSSS!!!\n\nWWEFan: What a crazy entrance from an even more crazy individual. Since this feud began, Eclipse Diemos has made it his mission to rehabilitate Hades The Hellraiser and turn him into what he believes he once was. His way of doing so is by breaking him down both physically and mentally so that he may pick up the pieces and rebuild him in a way he sees fit.\n\nKawajai: That approach sounds outright psychotic but it seems that there might be a method to his madness as we have slowly seen Hades return to his old ways. Tonight might be the breaking point, right here at Pain For Pride where the pressure is on for every Elitist. When put up against a competitor like Eclipse, that pressure will definitely weigh even heavier. We could finally see a breakthrough on the grandest stage of them all!\n\n(Eclipse slides into the ring towards the corner, removing the tattered cloak and setting the crown aside as he sits down in the corner.)\n\n(The lights in the arena go dim once more and eventually go completely black. A spotlight hits the stage and begins to slowly move up the tron. The spotlight continues its way up to the rafters, where a large, black Crow rests on the safety rail.)\n\n(A shadowy figure emerges behind the crow. The figure wears a black, expressionless mask and black hooded cloak.)\n\n(The man points off into the distance, and the crow flies away. The man slowly removes his hood, revealing the face of Erebos!! The fans erupt, but those cheers turn to boos rather quickly. Erebos sheds the jacket and pulls himself up onto the safety rail. He looks around…and takes a step off…)\n\n(The spotlight follows Erebos as he descends from the rafters. He lands in the middle of the ramp. The second his feet touch, bright red lights fill the arena, and “Nightmare” by Avenged Sevenfold plays over the P.A.)\n\nAnnouncer: Aaaaand his partner…from TARTARUS….weighing in at two hundred and forty pounds….THE PRIMORDIAL GOD OF DARKNESS…..ERRRRRRRRRRRRREBOOOOOOOOOOOS!!!\n\nWWEFan: Erebos is coming from above in fantastic and perhaps to some, even frightening fashion. This may be Erebos’ first Pain For Pride but it’s no different to him, this is just another opportunity for him to allow the darkness to spread and infect EAW – this time infecting two men he considers relics who once carried his very message of darkness.\n\nKawajai: We have seen a much darker side from Erebos in recent weeks and it turned even worse last week when he exploded like never before and ended up trying to choke the life out of Hades the Hellraiser! This match is personal! He may not be with Eclipse on bringing these two back to top form, but he is definitely with the idea of breaking them down!\n\n(Erebos slowly stalks to the ring and climbs the steps. In one fluid motion, Erebos steps through the ropes and up onto the second turnbuckle. Erebos raises his arm…and the Crow lands on it. The music fades out as Erebos steps down into the ring and stands beside Eclipse Diemos.)\n\n(The arena goes to complete blackness, as three spotlights are seen around the arena, all shining down on a small stage. On each stage there is a large box sitting on it, as the music starts.)\n\n“What of the dollar you murdered for…”\n\n“Is that the one fighting for your soul…”\n\n“Or your brother’s the one that you’re running from…”\n\n“But if you got money, fuck it, because I want some”\n\n(The boxes all lower into there respective stages as Big Sean, Jay Z and Kanye West are all shown on their individual stages, as www.youtube.com/watch?v=h19x8Wqpkq8 plays throughout the arena.)\n\n(The entire stage, along with most of the arena begins to have smaller spotlights everywhere, showing men dressed like KD, women dressed like Amie Devastation, older men dressed in suits like Gio, and some dressed like Dark Emperor.)\n\n(More spotlights show around the arena as men dressed like Ricky Razor, Adrian Christ, Mr. Blood and other underlings Kevin Devastation has used over the years. 1000’s of smaller spotlights surround a dark arena show them all.)\n\n(One final giant spotlight appears center stage as Kevin Devastation is shown standing next to the real Amie, Gio, DE, Ricky, Adrian, Blood. All throw up a Kliq symbol as Kevin Devastation smirks, and begins to make his long walk to the ring with Amie by his side.)\n\nRing Announcer: And their opponents, introducing first from Paradise Island, by way of Charlotte, North Carolina! He weighed in at 285 pounds! He is “The Lone Legend”…..KEEEEEVVVIINNNN….DEVASSTAAAATTTIOOONNNNNNN!!!!\n\nWWEFan: Well at least we know it’s the same old KD. The guy may be cocky but don’t let this entrance fool you, he’s an amazing competitor, a former World Champion and a Hall of Famer! The guy has it all, definitely one of the most complete Elitists out there.\n\nKawajai: It’s great to have him back honestly, he definitely shocked the world when he came out of retirement to aid Hades but it was certainly needed to even the odds. Kevin is all about respect and that lack of it toward a fellow Hall of Famer set him off for sure. He’s out here with a purpose and that’s to show that the old guard isn’t going to fall behind and take crap from the new breed!\n\n(All the spot lights begin to converge from the people around the arena to just KD, as he walks to the ring as pyro goes off all around this open arena. The word Kliq posted everywhere, and above the ring a giant Kevin Devastation banner unfolds above.)\n\n(Kevin Devastation enters the ring, and shows off the HOF Ring he has one last time before taking it off, kissing his wife Amie and handing it to her. Kevin throws up one last Kliq sign as all the 1000’s of the Kliq also does around the arena.)\n\n(The fans begin to murmur…Kevin Devastation just smirks…)\n\n(The lights go off.)\n\n(Every member of the audience is on the edge of their seats, not daring to make a sound.)\n\n(A motorcycle revs, and the tron illuminates in a blinding flash. The fans lose their minds. After the revving dies down, a line of SWAT members exit through the curtain. One by one, they file out and line the entrance ramp. By the end, twenty SWAT members line the ramp. They stand on opposite sides and turn to face each other, hitting their batons rhythmically against their riot shields. Bam Bam Bam Bam BAM…)\n\n(With one final hit, the lights go out and “Wanted Man (Acoustic)” hits the P.A.)\n\n(The curtain flies open, and out rides HALL OF FAMER HADES THE HELLRAISER! The fans are on their feet as Hades revs his custom Harley Davidson a few more times. He smirks and raises a fist…then begins his ride down the ramp.)\n\nAnnouncer: AND HIS PARTNER!! FROM DEVIL TOWN, NORTH CAROLINA…..HE IS A 2016 EAW HALL OF FAME INDUCTEE….LADIES AND GENTLEMEN….HAAAAAAAAAADES….THE……HELLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLRAIIIIIIIIISERRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRR\n\nWWEFan: The big dog is here and he is ready to defend his yard from those who dare to step upon it! He’s coming down to the ring with fire in his eyes ; fire that I have never even seen from Hades. These two have made Hades put up with so much BS but tonight he has the chance to do away with them and do it on the platform that he’s always been known to perform greatly at: Pain For Pride!\n\nKawajai: You have to think that Hades is riding high right now, he has so much momentum and is making his way to that ring with an expectation to meet! Last night he got inducted into the HALL OF FAME, joining his partner Kevin Devastation in the prestigious group! These two are proven to be students of the game, they love a good brawl, and are very bad men when it comes to being inside that ring. We’re looking at a dream team right now and if I were The Sanatorium even I would be worried!\n\n(Hades rides around the ring, past the on-looking Sanatorium, and back to the ramp. He stops the bike and swings his tree-trunk leg over. Hades effortlessly climbs into the ring and steps over the top rope. He throws his right fist into the air, which prompts fireworks and pyro to go off around the ramp and rafters. Hades removes his Hall of Fame shirt and throws it into the audience as the music fades out…)\n\nKawajai: Here we go, all four men are finally in the ring as this match is ready to begin!\n\n(DING! DING! DING!)\n\nWWEFan: The bell has rung and this match is underway! The atmosphere right now is intense, Hades has been tormented by these guys for months and is obviously heated as Kevin Devastation remains calm and tries to restrain him! Hades listens but Eclipse Diemos is doing no favors for him. Look at him just staring across from Hades sporting that grin of his, chuckling at him right now! The teams need to decide who is starting, the referee is growing impatient and is beginning a count. Kev does not want to risk Hades coming in angry so he convinces him to head to the sidelines while Eclipse puts out his arm and motions for Erebos to let him have this! KD and Eclipse Diemos are face to face in the middle of the ring as Kevin mocks him and — OH! Eclipse slaps Kevin Devastation right in the face and things turn serious! He grabs Kev by the hair and SLAMS his face directly into his knee! Kevin Devastation falls back in a daze but makes a recovery on his feet!\n\nKawajai: Not for long though as Eclipse backs into the ropes and comes back with a running shoulder block that sends Kevin falling into the ropes himself, grabbing onto the middle one to keep himself from hitting the mat! Eclipse Diemos barrels into him with a battering ram like dash to the chest! He backs away again, this time even farther and comes in like a bull! DIRECTLY INTO A BOOT! ECLIPSE’S BATTERING RAM ATTACK CAUSES HIM TO GO HEAD FIRST INTO KEV’S BOOT AS YOU CAN HEAR HIS SKULL CRACK! Eclipse Diemos falls down and is met with a roundhouse that catches him in the mouth! Kevin Devastation follows it up with a leaping elbow drop to the sternum!\n\nWWEFan: Eclipse Diemos rolls over and then pushes himself up to his feet as Big Kev cocks back his fist and pops him in the face! Eclipse Diemos winds back and responds with a throat thrust that leaves Kevin gasping for air! Eclipse comes dashing for him but with Kevin’s one free arm he shows some surprising agility for a guy his size with an arm drag as the crowd gives him props! He raises up his fist and he is feeling the ovation as he turns back around! Watch out! Running crossbody by Eclipse Diemos that takes him down as he heads over to the corner and tags in Erebos who jumps over the ropes and drops his knee across Kevin’s face! Kevin sits up and is hit in the spine and then dragged up! Erebos has the hair and drags Kev with him as he runs! RUNNING BULLDOG! Kevin Devastation gets up and puts his fists up to get back to fighting but Erebos evades him and pushes him into the corner of his partner!\n\nKawajai: Erebos WANTS Kevin to tag in Hades!? Erebos, stone faced as ever looks on as Kevin gives the go-ahead to Hades and tags him in! The two are face to face! Hades and Erebos have their gazes fixed upon one another as — HADES PUTS HIS HAND AROUND EREBOS’ THROAT AND EREBOS DOESN’T EVEN FLINCH AS HADES GRIPS HIM! CHOKESLAM! EREBOS LOOKS LIKE HE WAS DAMN NEAR DRIVEN THROUGH THE MAT WITH THAT CHOKESLAM AS HADES GETS UP AND LETS OUT A SHOUT! Hades laid him out just like that and — WHAT IN THE HELL!? Erebos is already getting up! Erebos stands up straight and looks at Hades, barely even hurting!? We’ve seen Erebos do things like this before but not in a long time! Hades is at first unsure of himself but now we’re starting to see a smirk from him, I think he likes this challenge!\n\nWWEFan: Erebos has no urgency as he slowly walks to Hades! Hades is in a stance ready to fight! RIGHT FROM HADES! A LEFT! EREBOS LEANS BACK AND THEN SHUFFLES TO THE SIDE TO GET OUT OF DODGE FOR BOTH BLOWS! HE TAKES HIS HAND AND PLACES IT AROUND HADES’ FACE, SHOVING HIM INTO THE TURNBUCKLE! Erebos backs away! BIG SPLASH INTO THE CORNER AS HE BACKS AWAY FOR A SECOND SPLASH! BUT WAIT! HADES FOLLOWS HIM AND DELIVERS A CORNER ATTACK OF HIS OWN! CLOTHESLINE! Erebos goes out of the corner and walks right into a sidewalk slam! Hades gets up but already Erebos is rising to his feet too! Hades is up first and clubs him in the back but Erebos just catches him with an uppercut to keep him at bay!\n\nKawajai: That blow might have woke Hades up as he cracks his neck and goes back to work! A fake out as he forces Erebos to retreat from a shot to the face and instead catches him with a body shot! Multiple body shots now as Erebos is pressed into the ropes and is now taking shots after shot! Eclipse Diemos goes to intervene but takes an elbow shot to the face which nearly knocks him off of the apron! Hades goes back to Erebos and catches him running toward him! BACKBODY DROP! NO! EREBOS LANDS DIRECTLY ON HIS FEET! NECKBREAKER! Erebos is stalking Hades now, watching and waiting for his next move while he gets to his feet! Hades gets up and Erebos goes behind him as he is looking to deliver that Scorpion Death Drop of his ; the move he calls The Pitch Black! Hades struggles though as he twists Erebos’ around and pulls him in by the wrist into the spinebuster!\n\nWWEFan: Hades is back in this as this move seems to have done the trick! Erebos is hurting and there is a delay in his step while he attempts to return to a vertical base! Hades does a cut throat motion and yells at him to get up, egging him on as he is closer and closer! Hades sees Erebos fully get up and heads to him, but then hang on! Eclipse Diemos has him by the singlet and reels him in, dragging him over the top rope and then tumbling into the floor! Come on! Hades is caught completely by surprise as Eclipse kicks him while he’s down and bumps him into the steel steps! Eclipse Diemos brings the dazed Hades up to his feet now as Erebos hauls it up to the top rope! HE GOES FLYING ON TOP OF HADES, HADES IS DOWN!\n\nKawajai: Eclipse Diemos and Erebos celebrate with one another but there will be no time as Kevin has moved around the ring and is now behind them on the apron! NO WAY! Kevin leaps off of the apron and pulls both of them down by the head for a DUAL DDT ONTO THE HARD ARENA FLOOR! Those floor mats are paper thin almost and that fact is evident from the splat we heard upon impact as their craniums hit the ground! Kevin goes to help Hades up but there is no need as Hades is already moving and giving out instructions! He’s telling Kevin to hold them while he rolls back into the ring! KD listens and pulls them both up, letting them have a quick meeting of the minds to keep them stunned before having his arm around both of them to keep them together!\n\nWWEFan: I’m wondering what Hades has in mind here! Hades looks around at this sold out crowd, doing a scan of the audience as he hears them roar! He hits the ropes! OH MY GOD! HADES THE HELLRAISER GOES OVER THE ROPES AND DELIVERS A SUICIDE DIVE STRAIGHT FROM THE HEAVENS!\n\nKawajai: Heavens? That seemed more like hell for his opponents! Kevin Devastation seems to have got caught in the crossfire there and even Hades is in pain! Then again who can blame him as he fell like a meteor at incredible velocity through those three! This is what Hades is willing to risk for his pride, for his reputation, for immortality! He can barely stand as he gets up with assist from the barricade and approaches a downed Eclipse as — OUCH! SPEAR FROM ECLIPSE DIEMOS DRIVING HIM DEEPER INTO THAT CROWD RESTRAINT! Hades falls forward at the bottom of the ramp and Eclipse Diemos does a quick roll into the ring as he appears to be threatening the referee to slow down his count before getting back out and revisiting Kevin! Kevin is looking to fight back but Erebos from behind grabs him and delivers a Russian leg sweep, sacrificing himself as the back of his head bounces off of the floor as well! Eclipse Diemos looks down at the three fallen men and abruptly turns his back on them, walking up the stairs and hitting the apron! You don’t think….\n\nWWEFan: Nah, nah, not happening! He goes into the ring and backs into the corner opposite to where all of the carnage is to watch them get up. I thought he was about to go high risk for a moment but it seems that won’t be the case as…..wait a minute! YOU GOTTA BE KIDDING ME!? ECLIPSE DIEMOS RUNS ACROSS THE RING, USES THE ROPES TO SCALE UP TO THE TOP TURNBUCKLE AND HITS A SENTON INTO THE THREE OPPONENTS! A BIG DIVE DELIVERED TO PERFECTION! HE CAUGHT THEM OFF GUARD THERE WITH HIS HESITATION! ECLIPSE DIEMOS LOOKING TO TOP HADES THERE AS EVERYONE HAS BEEN WIPED OUT! I NEVER WOULD HAVE THOUGHT ECLIPSE WOULD HAVE HAD IT IN HIM BUT IT MIGHT HAVE BEEN SOMETHING HE WAS SAVING JUST FOR TONIGHT! JUST LOOK AT HIS FACE! HE IS FLAT ON HIS BACK, NOT GETTING UP, YET IS STILL LAUGHING!\n\nKawajai: He is feeling confident after that! He gets up and brings Hades to his feet so that he can toss him into the ring! Erebos follows suit upon Eclipse’s instruction and grabs him by the hair as he gets in the ring, pulling him in! NO! HADES WITH A BACKFIST! Hades turns around for a follow up — INTO A SPINNING SIDE SLAM! THE GATES OF TARTARUS! EREBOS IS BACK IN CONTROL NOW! He stands over Hades as he takes his two thumbs and goes to DRIVE them into HADES EYEBALLS! HADES HAS TO STOP HIM AS EREBOS LEANS IN FOR A HEADBUTT AND THEN BITES AT THE FOREHEAD! THE REFEREE IS WARNING HIM AS HE BEGINS A FIVE COUNT!\n\nReferee: Enough Erebos! ONE! TWO! THREE! FOUR!\n\nKawajai: Erebos finally backs off and leaves Hades be but keeps him in his sight while he gets back up! SCORPION DEATH DROP! THE PITCH BLACK AND THIS TIME IT CONNECTS! EREBOS HOOKS BOTH LEGS OF THE BIG MAN AS HE GOES FOR A COVER!\n\nReferee: ONEEEEEEEE…….TWOOOOOOOO………THRRRRR —\n\nWWEFan: KEVIN DEVASTATION BREAKS IT UP WITH A LEG DROP TO THE NECK OF EREBOS! Eclipse Diemos runs in to help out but then there is Kevin with a Thesz Press as he leans in with heavy rights! Hades feebly takes his hand and grabs Kev’s foot, yanking at it for his attention as he tells him to put Eclipse on the apron! Kevin pushes Eclipse onto the apron with his foot and grabs the hand of Erebos, dragging him off and leaving him to make a tag as the referee tells him to go to the corner himself! Hades can barely stand as he gets up on wobbly legs and motions for Eclipse to get up and head to him!\n\nHades: (without mic) This is what you wanted Eclipse! You and me! Get up and fight me like a man!\n\nWWEFan: Eclipse Diemos is doing just that as he crawls into the ring, still a bit disoriented but not bothered as he looks upon Hades and is now happier than ever! This is what he wanted! He gets up and gets settled in as now both men have recovered and stand across from one another! Finally after all of this time they are face to face in a match! They don’t even wait, they just run up and lock horns in a mess of rights and lefts! The two wind up falling against the ropes! Eclipse digs his knee into Hades’ gut with major force but Hades pushes him off onto the mat in response! Eclipse quickly gets up! LARIAT BY HADES,TURNING THE BIG MAN INSIDE OUT! Hades drags Eclipse up! He has him slung over his shoulder and heads to the corner! SNAKE EYES BY HADES! ECLIPSE’S HEAD BOUNCES OFF OF THE TURNBUCKLE AND HE IS RUN DOWN BY HADES’ BIG BOOT SOON AFTER! HADES GOING FOR A QUICK COVER!\n\nReferee: ONEEEEE….TWOOOOO…….KICKOUT!!!\n\nKawajai: Eclipse Diemos gets the shoulder up just in the knick of time! Eclipse Diemos is now going to roll off for some distance but Hades follows him and grabs him by the shirt! OH! Eclipse suckers him in with a drop toe hold that leads to Hades falling throat first into the ropes! He staggers into Eclipse’s grasp! RUNNING STO! Hades is down on his back as Eclipse stands himself up on the middle rope! FLYING AXEHANDLE AS HADES GETS UP ONTO HIS FEET! Hades manages to stay on a vertical base but soon his legs are taken out from under him and he is spun around in a giant swing! Round and round Hades goes as WOAH! Hades pulls Eclipse in mid-swing! HE’S GOT HIM IN THAT TRIANGLE CHOKE OF HIS! HE’S YANKED ECLIPSE DOWN AND GROUNDED HIM IN THAT SUBMISSION! HADES IS SQUEEZING WITH ALL OF HIS MIGHT! ECLIPSE DIEMOS IS LOOKING FOR A MEANS OF ESCAPE AS HE GRABS HADES BY THE PANT LEG AND PULLS HIM UP! BUCKLE BOMB WITH AN ASSISTED KICK TO THE BACK OF THE HEAD BY EREBOS!\n\nWWEFan: Eclipse Diemos then goes for a Samoan drop attempt but Hades floats over! OH! HE’S LOOKING TO GO FOR A BRIMSTONE PILEDRIVER HERE! ECLIPSE DIEMOS SLIDES OFF! GLASGOW SMILE! NO! HADES CATCHES HIM WITH A CHOKESLAM! Hades rolls over and tags in Kevin Devastation who comes in with his hands ready! He’s behind Eclipse! THE FINAL ATONEMENT! THE FINAL ATONEMENT CONNECTS HERE! KEVIN DEVASTATION HOOKS BOTH LEGS TO WRAP THIS UP FOR HIS TEAM!\n\nReferee: ONEEEEEEEE……TWOOOOO……THRRRRR —\n\nKawajai: Erebos dropped off of the apron and socks KD in the face from the outside to stop it! That was a hard right! Erebos hops back onto the apron and Eclipse tags him in! Kev is on his knees and that makes the playing field even for Erebos who nails him with a picture perfect dropkick! Erebos showing some incredible strength here! SNAP SUPLEX ON BIG KEV! Kev’s legs are still up in the air as Erebos goes by and grabs them! HE’S TURNING KEVIN OVER! THE DARKNESS WRATH! THE DARKNESS WRATH IS LOCKED IN AND TEARING AT THE LEGS OF KEVIN! YOU TAKE AWAY THE LEGS FROM A GUY LIKE HIM AND YOU TAKE OUT EVERYTHING! EREBOS PULLING BACK WITH ALL HIS MIGHT — AS HE STOMPS ON THE BACK OF KEVIN’S HEAD SIMULTANEOUSLY! OH MY GOD THAT IS BRUTAL! ENOUGH! HADES DECIDES TO GO THROUGH THE ROPES BUT THE REFEREE IS TELLING HIM NO!\n\nWWEFan: Hades doesn’t care, he has to help and so he pushes the referee to the side and mows Erebos down to stop it! Erebos falls forward and tags back in Eclipse Diemos who shoots through the ropes and this time his Glasgow Smile connects on Hades as he attempted to duck underneath it! Hades goes to the outside as it is now Eclipse Diemos and Kevin Devastation left as the two legal men! Kevin could be concussed after those brutal stomps by Erebos but no matter as he still has his fighting spirit left within! Kevin gets up and is asking Eclipse Diemos to bring it on! Eclipse has no problem doing that! AVALANCHE IN THE CORNER! BACK SUPLEX AS A FOLLOW UP! Kevin Devastation is down as Eclipse awaits his return to his feet!\n\nKawajai: That one tag has been a game changer as now things are falling into place for The Sanatorium! Eclipse Diemos is pacing himself in the corner ; absolutely losing his mind as he chomps at the bit to see Kevin get up so that he may finish this! Kevin Devastation is making the slow climb to his feet and with each agonizing second Eclipse is growing more and more impatient! Kevin is finally up but not much is going on upstairs! All he needs to do is turn around!\n\nEclipse Diemos: You should have never got involved Kevin!\n\nKawajai: ROOM 13 BOOT BY ECLIPSE! WHAT!? IT’S CAUGHT! EXPLODER SUPLEX BY KEVIN! THAT MUST HAVE BEEN INSTINCT, IT HAD TO BE! KEVIN DEVASTATION CAN BARELY EVEN GET UP FOLLOWING THAT, HITTING THE MOVE WAS EVEN MORE STRENUOUS! Kevin turns over and forces himself up but Eclipse is getting up too! WOAH! Kevin puts his hands under Eclipse and lifts him up! HE GOES UP HIGH FOR A GORILLA PRESS SLAM! Kevin may have a chance to finish this here but EREBOS! EREBOS REACHES OVER AND WITH HELP FROM THE ROPES, HITS A MODIFIED VARIATION OF THAT SCORPION DEATH DROP! Erebos now heads to the corner and is looking to climb up for a high risk entrance into the ring but wait just a minute! HADES IS THERE TO STOP HIM!\n\nWWEFan: Hades with a hit to the back that takes Erebos off balance as he goes under and grabs him by the legs in powerbomb position! No! No, NO! THE LAST CALL! THE LAST CALL AS HE LOOKS TO SEND EREBOS FLYING TO OUR ANNOUNCE TABLE — NO! EREBOS IS CLINGING ON! HE’S FIGHTING IT! EREBOS GETS OFF THE TOP ROPE AND GETS ON THE APRON TO SAVE HIMSELF! HE SWINGS AT HADES BUT HADES CATCHES THE HAND! OH! THEN THERE’S KEVIN WHO PUSHES ECLIPSE INTO EREBOS! HADES PUT EREBOS’ HAND UP AND IT MAKES CONNECT WITH ECLIPSE!\n\nKawajai: We got a tag there as Kevin Devastation grabs the ropes and slingshots Erebos into the ring while Hades goes around the ring to his corner! Kevin Devastation heads to him! A TAG IS MADE ON THEIR SIDE! Hades is in the ring and waits for Erebos to get up! CHOKESLAM TO EREBOS AND HE STAYS DOWN FROM THIS ONE! Hades isn’t even done either! He scrapes Erebos off of the canvas and then turns him over onto his shoulders! HE DROPS HIM ON HIS HEAD WITH A BRIMSTONE PILEDRIVER! COVER!\n\nReferee: ONEEEEEEEEE!!! TWOOOOOO!!!! THREEEEEEEEE!!!!!\n\n(Ding! Ding! Ding!)\n\n(“Wanted Man” by Rev Theory plays as Hades gets up and stands over the body of Erebos. Kevin Devastation gets back into the ring and pats him on the back, offering for a handshake and raising Hades hand soon after.)\n\nRing Announcer: Here are your winners………HAAAAAADES THE HELLRAISEEEERRRRR AND KEEEEVIN DEVASTAAATTTIONNNNNN!!!!\n\nWWEFan: They did it! The Hall of Fame duo has managed to put away The Sanatorium! There was a lot of doubts ; these two have been going at it for a while and many thought they might not have it in them, but when the lights shined bright and the grand stage of Pain For Pride presented itself these two proved that they had another battle in them.\n\nKawajai: More than another battle in them, these two still got it! The last two outlaws in town entered a duel with the Devil and the God of Darkness and walked away victorious. That tells you something! These guys didn’t need any rehabilitation, they were more than ready to show their dark sides and get their hands dirty.\n\nWWEFan: Indeed! What a moment this is! Two titans standing in the ring after a hard fought match! That’s Pain For Pride for you folks! Kudos to not just them but The Sanatorium as it seems even Eclipse right now is watching on!\n\nKawajai: Eclipse may have lost but in a way he won at the end! Hades returned to top form tonight and that’s what he wanted! It took a lot to do so but he got it! Not just Hades, but KD did awesome!\n\n(Hades does a cut throat motion as he looks outside of the ring at Eclipse Diemos and Kevin Devastation taunts him from behind before pumping up his fist and drawing excitement from the crowd as he calls for Hades’ attention and suddenly his mood changes.)\n\nWWEFan: WOAH! WHAT THE HELL!? KEVIN DEVASTATION JUST SWUNG AT HADES WITH HIS FIST AND KNOCKED HIM DOWN! WHAT IN THE WORLD!? KEVIN DEVASTATION IN STOMPING ON HIM, NOT LETTING HADES GET UP! HADES HAS A LOOK OF CONFUSION IN HIS EYES AS KEVIN JUST CONTINUES WITH THIS BEATING! BOOT TO THE SIDE OF THE HEAD BY KEVIN! HADES TRIES TO GET UP BUT THEN THERE’S A PENALTY KICK TO THE STOMACH!\n\nKawajai: Why is he doing this? Why after such a great match these two had? Kevin Devastation backs away for a moment and leans in, watching Hades get up! Hades is trying to drag himself up using Hades as he looks up at him! Staring into his eyes as Kevin coldly looks on! HADES REACHES OUT HIS HAND FOR KEVIN DEVASTATION’S THROAT! NO! KEVIN PUSHES HIM AWAY! KICK TO THE STERNUM! FINAL ATONEMENT! THE FINAL ATONEMENT TO HADES! KEVIN GETS UP TO HIS FEET AND STARES OVER THE BODY OF ONE OF OUR LATEST HALL OF FAME INDUCTEES! HADES HAS BEEN LAID OUT BY HIS PARTNER KD AFTER ALL THEY’VE BEEN THROUGH! WHAT WAS THE MEANING OF THIS!?\n\n(Kevin Devastation stands over the body of Hades, sarcastically clapping as he says something inaudible)\n\nWWEFan: He’s lost it! Kevin Devastation has just HUMILIATED Hades – what reason could he possibly have for this?!\n\nKawajai: He should have known better than to trust Kevin Devastation, Fan! I knew from the get-go that Kevin wouldn’t offer his help if he didn’t want something in return! Looks like he got what he REALLY came for!\n\n(Kevin begins to take his leave as Hades struggles to get up, still in pain. Kevin stops himself at the ropes and turns back to look at Hades once more)\n\nWWEFan: No… Hey, come on! You got what you wanted, leave it at that!\n\n(Kevin goes back to Hades, reaching down and grabbing him by the throat as he drags him back up to his feet)\n\nKawajai: That look of HATE in the eyes of Kevin! He loathes this man! KEVIN PICKS HIM UP NOW! BRIMSTONE PILEDRIVER!!!! KEVIN DEVASTATION LAYS OUT HADES THE HELLRAISER WITH A BRIMSTONE PILEDRIVER OF HIS OWN, MOCKING THE MANNERISMS OF HIS FALLEN PARTNER!!\n\nWWEFan: Absolutely disgusting.\n\n(Kevin kicks Hades to the side and goes through the ropes, walking down the ramp as he passes Eclipse and Erebos who even seem to be shocked as he carries on and tries to regain his composure. A chorus of boos come his way as we fade elsewhere.)\n\n(The camera pans backstage… where The Pizza Boy is seen preparing for his match, he tapes up his wrist, then puts on his black leather jacket, before the door behind him is heard opening.)\n\n???: You don’t know how proud I am of you.\n\n(The Pizza Boy eyes widen, his face seems a little bit shocked, as he turns around to hear a familiar voice, the camera revealing… The Heart Break Boy grinning at The Pizza Boy.)\n\nThe Pizza Boy: Holy overpriced delivery fee’s… it can’t be, it really can’t…\n\nHeart Break Boy: I had to stop by just to see my protege compete at the pinnacle of all wrestling; Pain for Pride.\n\n(The Pizza Boy’s face turns from very excited, to a straight face…)\n\nThe Pizza Boy: … you left me, HBB. Do you know how painful that has been? It’s changed me as a person, and Drake and Jones taunts me, mocks me, because they want to believe they retired you.\n\nHeart Break Boy: Retire me? That was a decision I made a long time back. It’s only ironic that we lost to them, but doesn’t mean they retired me.\n\nThe Pizza Boy: That’s besides the point. I’m trying to sum this up as… why? Why then?\n\nHeart Break Boy: Because I wrestled in this industry for far too long, it was my time to go. I had done everything I possibly could, and elevating your career was one of those important things. I think you and I knew that I wouldn’t be here for much longer, and it was a tough pill to swallow. But look at you, you’ve done completely fine without me at your side. You don’t need me anymore, Pizza Boy, trust me.\n\nThe Pizza Boy: … I guess, but still, you didn’t even let me throw you a goodbye pizza party! Do you know how disappointing that was?!\n\nHeart Break Boy: Heh, same ol’ Pizza Boy, they haven’t broken your spirit, your humor stays the same.\n\n(The Heart Break Boy pulls The Pizza Boy in for a hug, and The Pizza Boy receives it.)\n\nHeart Break Boy: Good luck out there, I know you won’t disappoint.\n\n(The Heart Break Boy pulls back, smiling at The Pizza Boy, he nods, HBB nods back… before exiting the locker room, leaving a rather cheerful Pizza Boy to finish gearing up for his match, and the camera transitions elsewhere.)\n\n( The camera fades to the ring )\n\nRing Announcer: The following contest is scheduled for one fall… AND IT IS FOR THE VIXEEEEEEENNNNSSSSSS CUP!!\n\n( ‘We Hate Everyone’ by K.
