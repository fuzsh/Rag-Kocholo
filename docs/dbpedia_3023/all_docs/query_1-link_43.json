        "text": "Contrary to what my role with New Japan Pro Wrestling and the professional wrestling community at large might indicate, my primary objective here has never been about statistics or the detailed history and research that I’ve been blessed with the task of compiling for broadcasters and fans. I’ve always hoped that my work would make a product that I am passionate about easier to explore, more accessible, or more palatable for new fans. Translating pro wrestling results to commonly understood sports metrics seemed like a great lane to jump into, and it continues to be a thrill to provide that for the community, but early in 2023, I wanted a project that would take a different form to clearly serve my objective.\n\nInspired and buzzing with excitement after Wrestle Kingdom 17, I was determined to do my part to expand this community full of curiosity and new NJPWWorld subscribers, so I tasked myself with compiling an all-encompassing resource to point people to as they seek out a deeper understanding of this tremendous professional wrestling product with often intimidating history, a deep reverence for its role in the industry, and (usually) clear lines to the next stages of its story.\n\nSo, of course, I reached out to my partner in NJPW deep dives, J. Michael, to create a primer for new fans. And while I continued to anchor myself with data and history-driven single-event content, J. Michael started writing, and I’m convinced he never stopped.\n\nThe 25,000 or so words that you’ll find beyond this foreword started as an outline and one of my most altruistic ideas in the pro wrestling space, and without much help from me, J. Michael took that outline and made it into a reality. J. left no stone unturned, so my hope is you’ll be inspired to bookmark this page and use command-F to search through it as you dive into the nuances of New Japan Pro Wrestling’s 50+ year history. –Chris Samsa\n\nAbout The Author\n\nJ. Michael grew up in the sleep West of the woody East. He spent years doing meaningless, lowbrow things like digging cellars and scrutinizing 16th-century Papal bulls until he started writing about wrestling for VOW in 2020. Enjoy about a week of G1 Climax coverage @ryugu_jo until he gets distracted by the World Fencing Championships.\n\nBrief History of NJPW\n\nNew Japan Pro Wrestling was founded by Antonio Inoki in 1972, following his break from the Japanese Wrestling Association (founded in 1953 by Inoki’s trainer, the legendary Rikidozan). The company of today bears partial resemblance to the company of Inoki, having changed ownership twice but still pays immense tribute to their founder.\n\nThey still refer to New Japan’s philosophy and style as Strong Style, a phrase coined by Inoki that most find difficult to define; most attempt end in a hodgepodge of hard striking, stubborn fighting spirit, an appreciation of simplicity, but also a flair for dramatically charismatic bursts of roaring. Modern NJPW matches attempt to capture this essence, though often filtered through a framework reminiscent of classic King’s Road All-Japan (the company founded in 1972 by Giant Baba, Rikidozan’s other star pupil.)\n\nNew Japan flourished through the ‘70s and ‘80s, centering on Inoki, homegrown talent, and a parade of foreign menaces. By the ’80s, a new crop of wrestlers trained by Inoki had emerged, including Tatsumi Fujinami, Riki Choshu, and the original Tiger Mask, Satoru Sayama. Into this mix were thrown foreign wrestlers such as Hulk Hogan and Big Van Vader, who both achieved massive success in Japan before they did so in America.\n\nStarting around 1990, the next generation of New Japan legends began to assert themselves: Keiji Mutoh, Masahiro Chono, Shinya Hashimoto, Jushin Liger, and Hiroshi Hase, among others like Choshu acolyte Kensuke Sasaki. This generation would draw incredible attendances and gates and influence an entire generation through their partnership with World Championship Wrestling. Many traditions in New Japan, including the G1 Climax and Best of the Super Juniors, started in this period.\n\nNJPW continued to successfully produce tremendous wrestlers, several of whom would become known as the “Third Generation:” Yuji Nagata, Satoshi Kojima, Hiroyoshi Tenzan, Manabu Nakanishi, Osamu Nishimura, and Koji Kanemoto, among others. Unfortunately, this period saw gate success falter, partly due to the rise of mixed martial arts (especially Pride Fighting Championships and K-1) and a larger wrestling recession of the early-2000s.\n\nInoki’s response was not favorably received. Intoxicated by the allure of MMA, to which he had always considered himself a proto-MMA fighter (obviously including his famed, and derided, battle with Muhammed Ali), Inoki leaned into this concept. He had several of his wrestlers enter MMA fights with mixed results. Shinsuke Nakamura did adequately, while Yuji Nagata was obliterated by Mirko Cro Cop and Fedor Emelianenko. Inoki heavily pushed wrestlers like Kazuyuki Fujita, who had MMA success but did not catch on in pro wrestling.\n\nInoki departed New Japan in 2005, selling to Yuke’s. This is where New Japan began a slow comeback story. Hiroshi Tanahashi led the way, willing himself to ace status. Shinsuke Nakamura, originally a supernova rookie that plateaued, went to Mexico and returned with the flamboyant character he portrays to this day. And most importantly, two kids from the dojo system, Tetsuya Naito and Kazuchika Okada, would return from excursion in 2010 and 2012, respectively.\n\nYuke’s sold NJPW to Bushiroad in 2012, the year Okada returned. From this point, wrestling history would be fundamentally changed by a sequence of events originating in New Japan:\n\nOkada and Tanahashi would embark on a four-year feud over the IWGP Heavyweight title, confirming Tanahashi’s status as one of the greatest wrestlers of all time and elevating Okada into a superstar that could take New Japan global.\n\nThe company launched New Japan World, with English commentary on most major events.\n\nTetsuya Naito went to Mexico in mid-2015, leaving as a face but returning as the lethargic heel he portrays today, having aligned with Los Ingobernables during his month in CMLL. His chase of Okada from 2017-2020 brought the company to unprecedented heights.\n\nKenny Omega and Kota Ibushi fully transfer from DDT. Omega’s reign as BULLET CLUB leader from 2016-2018, including a legendary four-match rivalry with Okada and Wrestle Kingdom match with Chris Jericho, essentially laid the groundwork for All Elite Wrestling.\n\nNJPW now finds itself transitioning into a new era. The pillars of the old way, like Tanahashi and Naito, are slowly losing steam, and their bodies are starting to crumble. Okada, being the younger of this generation, has shifted towards a role as an easily provoked, ornery veteran that refuses to capitulate to the next generation. New returns like Yota Tsuji and Shota Umino have taken shots at titles well before schedule. As New Japan eases into its sixth decade, things are brewing.\n\nNJPW Tours\n\nNew Japan tours year-round but not continuously. The typical New Japan tour lasts for roughly two to two-and-a-half weeks, followed by a break of roughly a week and a half to two weeks. It offers a nice reset and breather for the wrestlers, fans, and promotion. Over the course of a calendar year, New Japan travels to all points of the main Japanese islands. There are towns and cities they visit multiple times a year, and some only once per year, but every tour includes at least one night at Korakuen Hall in Tokyo.\n\nEach tour culminates in a big event, with the lead-up shows being labeled “Road to” shows, although the nature of the tour differs based on the event. For instance, a major event like Dominion will build towards that one show, with the other shows on the tour being referred to as “Road to Dominion” shows.\n\nFor lesser events like New Beginning, they spread out big matches and promote multiple “New Beginnings” based on their location. For instance, in 2023, there were four New Beginning shows: New Beginning in Nagoya, New Beginning in Sapporo, and two New Beginning in Osaka events. In between each event were Road to New Beginning shows.\n\nWhile they have TV partners and their New Japan World streaming network, NJPW is not a TV-based product and does not air every house show. They generally air two shows per tour, though their practice is to air every Korakuen Hall show, which can cause the overall numbers to vary. This became especially gruesome during the heart of the pandemic, when they ran Korakuen Hall for the bulk of each tour.\n\nMajor Events\n\nAlmost every New Japan tour culminates in a big event of some kind. Some are spread out over multiple dates and venues. In other cases. Some are tournament finals. And some are the most important and significant events in the entire professional wrestling landscape for the entire year.\n\nThe most major of all would be Wrestle Kingdom, held on January 4 every year at the Tokyo Dome. New Japan has run a show on that date, at that venue, since 1992. This has not always been to their benefit; because they run on a specific day every year, sometimes they’ve drawn lesser houses when January 4 falls mid-week. That said, Wrestle Kingdom remains their premiere event, and by that nature, it remains one of the premiere events in all of wrestling.\n\nThe major events on the New Japan calendar are spaced out. The big stand-alone events are Wrestle Kingdom in January, Sakura Genesis in April, Dominion in June, and King of Pro Wrestling in October. In between these, there are multi-night events, such as New Beginning in February and Destruction in September, which spread shows out over multiple weeks. The rest of the calendar is filled out mostly by tournaments.\n\nOne could comfortably follow New Japan by watching only these major events. That changed somewhat during the pandemic, as the merciless onslaught of Korakuen Hall shows during 2021-2022 necessitated drawing matches. And even before the pandemic, they would have lesser belts, such as the NEVER Openweight 6-man and Junior Heavyweight Tag Team championships defended on “Road to” shows.\n\nEven so, the vast majority of important matches, development, and sequences happen during these major events. These are the major events of the New Japan calendar, as well as the lesser ones:\n\nJanuary\n\nMajor Event: Wrestle Kingdom (January 4)\n\nMajor Event: New Year’s Dash!! (January 5)\n\nLesser Event: Fantasticamania (co-promoted with CMLL)\n\nFebruary\n\nMajor Event: New Beginning (Always broken into two or three shows)\n\nMarch\n\nMajor Event: Anniversary Show (Held first week of March, usually at Ota Ward General Gymnasium, the site of the first New Japan show in 1972)\n\nMajor Event: New Japan Cup Final\n\nApril\n\nMajor Event: Sakura Genesis (Always held at Sumo Hall in Tokyo)\n\nMay\n\nMajor Event: Wrestling Dontaku (Held since 1993; always in Fukuoka)\n\nJune\n\nMajor Event: Dominion (Held since 2009; second-biggest single-night event; always in Osaka)\n\nJuly\n\nAugust\n\nMajor Event: G1 Climax Final\n\nSeptember\n\nMajor Event: Destruction (Always broken into two or three shows)\n\nOctober\n\nMajor Event: Sumo Hall in Tokyo\n\nThis event was King of Pro Wrestling until 2019. Its name is currently in flux.\n\nNovember\n\nMajor Event: World Tag League/Super Junior Tag League\n\nDecember\n\nLesser Event: Road to Tokyo Dome (Christmas Week – Korakuen Hall)\n\nNJPW Tournaments\n\nBesides the unit system, the key element of New Japan’s structure are tournaments.\n\nTournaments account for at least one-quarter of the year, and are the fertile cauldrons from which countless rivalries and story points emerge. For most of the roster, the bulk of their singles matches for a year will come in either the G1 Climax or Best of the Super Juniors. Because wins and losses are treated consequentially, wrestlers will reference tournament losses as their motivation for years.\n\nThese tournaments are also used as ways to normalize a new character or persona, which is why you will often see wrestlers debut such things leading into a G1 Climax or New Japan Cup. This can become tedious for those that follow every night of a tournament. For instance, if a wrestler debuts a new cheating heel persona before a G1 Climax, you can be assured that the wrestler will cheat in every G1 Climax match. It is effective in diffusing the new character to up to 18 different crowds.\n\nThe G1 Climax is New Japan’s flagship summer tournament, and is often treated as a fixed point in the wrestling calendar. Besides Wrestle Kingdom, it is the most substantial event on the New Japan calendar. Wrestler and Match of the Year considerations are generally held up in the air until the G1 Climax. The G1 Climax stretches back to 1991, and in its current form consists of roughly 18-19 shows stuffed into a grueling month. Since 2012, the winner of the G1 Climax tournament has earned the right to challenge for the IWGP (World) Heavyweight Championship at the next year’s Wrestle Kingdom.\n\nAs a round-robin tournament, the field of wrestlers are broken up into smaller pools, with each wrestler facing the other members of his pool once. Wins are worth two points, and draws are worth one point. The other major tournaments of the year all follow the same round-robin system, with pools of wrestlers fighting to advance to a final.\n\nThe formats have changed over the years, but generally have fallen into two categories:\n\nOne wrestler or team advances from two blocks, with a one-match final\n\nTwo wrestlers or teams advance from two blocks, with a four-man mini-tournament final\n\nThe current G1 Climax format, set for 2023, is unique and never before attempted: four blocks, with two wrestlers from each block advancing to an eight-man tournament final.\n\nThe tournament outlier is the single-elimination New Japan Cup, which has risen in stature in recent years. The anchor of New Japan’s spring run, the New Japan Cup is increasingly the FA Cup of New Japan, with the number of participants jumping dramatically. From 2005 to 2018, the Cup field was always limited to 12-16 wrestlers. It jumped to 32 in 2019, reaching an apex of 48 in 2022 before settling back down to 24 in 2023. The winner of the New Japan Cup can challenge for any title, not just the IWGP World Heavyweight Championship. The wide field and open challenge concept has produced unpredictability, allowing wrestlers to make tremendous leaps with a deep tournament run or tournament win.\n\nNew Japan’s tournaments are spaced well throughout the year, a built-in rest point for many wrestlers. For instance, most heavyweights will get the month off during Best of the Super Juniors, while the juniors get their break during the G1 Climax (although this has changed as the company runs more international shows).\n\nThese are the tournaments run by New Japan during the year:\n\nMarch: The New Japan Cup\n\nSingle Elimination\n\nHeld since 2005\n\nWinner receives a title shot of their choosing, usually at Sakura Genesis\n\nMay-June: Best of the Super Juniors\n\nRound Robin\n\nHeld since 1994 as Best of the Super Juniors, with continuity back to 1991\n\nWinner receives a shot at the IWGP Junior Heavyweight Championship, usually at Dominion\n\nJuly-August: G1 Climax\n\nRound Robin\n\nHeld since 1991 as the G1 Climax, with loose continuity stretching back to 1974\n\nWinner receives a shot at the IWGP World Heavyweight Championship at Wrestling Kingdom\n\nOctober-November or November-December: Super Junior Tag League\n\nRound Robin\n\nHeld since 2018 as Super Junior Tag League, with continuity back to 2012\n\nWinner receives a shot at the IWGP Junior Heavyweight Tag Team Championship\n\nNovember-December: World Tag League\n\nRound Robin\n\nHeld since 2012 as World Tag League, with continuity back to 1991\n\nWinner receives a shot at the IWGP Heavyweight Tag Team Championship at Wrestling Kingdom\n\nInfrequent: Young Lions Cup\n\nRound Robin\n\nHeld 1985-1987, 1989, 1993-1996, 2000, 2004-2005, 2017, 2019\n\nInfrequent: Super J Cup\n\nSingle Elimination\n\nHeld 1994-1995, 2000, 2004, 2009, 2016, 2019-2020 (both in the United States)\n\nHas run under several host promotions, has been exclusively New Japan since 2016\n\nNJPW Titles\n\nTitles are difficult to decipher in New Japan. At times, New Japan seems like a petrie dish in a lab experiment meant to test the asexual reproduction capabilities of title belts. The key thing to remember is that the titles are treated with reverence for the main singles titles, title matches are important, and title reigns are significant. The problem: all the other titles. The many, many titles.\n\nLike most Japanese promotions, New Japan title matches are restricted occurrences, and title defenses are tracked. Each title is defended less than ten times per year, and the distribution is not even. For instance, the IWGP World Heavyweight Championship is usually defended six or seventimes by June, but only one or two times the rest of the year. This predictability has its advantages and disadvantages, but a clear advantage is the ability to market title defenses by number. Most champions rarely defend more than four or five times; anything beyond that escalates stakes and foments intrigue.\n\nThere are three tiers of belts in New Japan: IWGP, NEVER, and STRONG. The highest prestige belts are under the International Wrestling Grand Prix moniker. The IWGP is the storyline governing body of New Japan that sanctions the company’s title matches. These titles hold the greatest significance; the sign of a wrestler’s ascent in the New Japan hierarchy is often shown when they win an IWGP belt.\n\nThe IWGP distinction is held in esteem, which is why a new title carrying those letters is always an indication of the company’s grander motives. When expanding into the United States more fervently, the company created the IWGP United States Championships, and booked Kenny Omega to be their initial champion.\n\nIn 2022, New Japan made their first steps towards including women in their events. This began with a co-promoted show with Stardom, Historic X-Over, which took place in November 2022. It was at this event that an inaugural IWGP Women’s Champion was crowned, and it was someone with international recognition: Kairi. Shortly thereafter, Mercedes Mone was brought into the mix, with an actual New Japan contract.\n\nNEVER stands for “New Blood,” “Evolution,” “Valiantly,” “Eternal,” and “Radical.” NEVER is a holdover from a series of shows held in 2010-2012. Initially, this concept intended to highlight young wrestlers and outsiders, but by 2014 the NEVER title had evolved into a showcase for the resolute, Spartan style of wrestlers such as Tomohiro Ishii, Katsuyori Shibata, and Togi Makabe. Though these titles are listed as “openweight,” and the 6-man titles have been held by junior-heavy combination teams, the singles title has never been held by a junior heavyweight, and rarely has a junior ever challenged for it.\n\nSTRONG is the branding of New Japan of America’s flagship show, which has aired on New Japan World every Saturday since August 2020. Initially, the show did not have any champions. The first champion was crowned on April 23, 2021, with Tom Lawlor winning the inaugural title tournament. A later tournament established the STRONG Openweight Tag Team titles on July 24 2022, with Aussie Open as the first champions, and the STRONG Women’s Championship on April 27, 2023, won by Willow Nightingale in a single-night tournament.\n\nThese are the current titles in New Japan.\n\nInternational Wrestling Grand Prix (IWGP)\n\nIWGP World Heavyweight Championship\n\nThe IWGP World Heavyweight Championship is a unification of two previous titles:\n\nIWGP Heavyweight Championship\n\nIWGP Intercontinental Championship\n\nIWGP Junior Heavyweight Championship\n\nIWGP United States Heavyweight Championship\n\nIWGP Heavyweight Tag Team Championship\n\nIWGP Junior Heavyweight Tag Team Championship\n\nIWGP Women’s Championship\n\nNew blood, Evolution, Valiantly, Eternal, Radical (NEVER)\n\nNEVER Openweight Championship\n\nNEVER Openweight 6-Man Tag Team Championship\n\nSTRONG\n\nStrong Openweight Championship\n\nStrong Women’s Championship\n\nStrong Openweight Tag Team Championship\n\nThere are two titles that do not fall under these categories:\n\nNJPW World Television\n\nThis title is presented as a partnership between New Japan and its television partner (and 10% minority owner) TV Asahi.\n\nMatches are under 15-minute time limit\n\nEvery match is uploaded to Youtube and can be watched for free\n\nKOPW\n\nThis title was established by Kazuchika Okada in the summer of 2020\n\nIt is essentially a gimmick title. Each wrestler presents a gimmick concept before the match. Fans vote, and the winning gimmick becomes the official stipulation of the match\n\nThe title is defended throughout the year. The person holding the title at the end of the year becomes that year’s KOPW champion. The process then begins anew at Wrestle Kingdom.\n\nNJPW Units\n\nThe New Japan roster is broken into a number of different units:\n\nCHAOS\n\nBULLET CLUB\n\nSub-unit: HOUSE OF TORTURE\n\nLos Ingobernables de Japón\n\nThe United Empire\n\nJust 5 Guys\n\nTMDK\n\nThose that don’t fall into these factions are considered part of the “Main Unit,” usually referred to by its Japanese name, Hontai. Hontai has two sub-units: Guerrillas of Destiny and Strong Style. In recent years, CHAOS has become more integrated into Hontai and often team with them in multi-man tags.\n\nThe entire company functions from the dynamics created by the unit structure. Units can generally be described as heel, face, or tweener units. The mix-matching of wrestlers and tags from these units against each other is the fundamental vehicle of the booking. And because each program involves a series of multi-man tags between the factions, any number of fruitful interactions can develop.\n\nThe units themselves help propel storytelling. Obviously, the most significant aspect of unit storytelling is a wrestler joining or leaving a stable. The excitement generated by a Young Lion returning from excursion is largely based on how that wrestler will fit into the current landscape, particularly which unit. Likewise, when foreign wrestlers debut, there is a tangible sense that they haven’t truly situated themselves into the company until they’ve officially joined a faction. Time in a unit allows these wrestlers time to acclimate and find their voice.\n\nBut the most influential action any wrestler can take in New Japan is leaving a unit to start another. In the list above, nearly every one was born from a messy separation. CHAOS was formed in 2009 when Shinsuke Nakamura lured several members of Great Bash Heel away from Togi Makabe. The United Empire began in 2020 when Will Ospreay betrayed Kazuchika Okada and left CHAOS. Just 5 Guys formed from the wake of Suzuki-gun’s voluntary dissolution in late 2022, but became a relevant stable when SANADA abruptly left LIJ to join them.\n\nThere is one thing to note, regarding an unofficial unit of sorts: the Three Musketeers (Toukon Sanjushi). The original Three Musketeers was comprised of Keiji Mutoh, Shinya Hashimoto, and Masahiro Chono, all members of the same New Japan dojo class (1984). This trio was so successful that the promotional tactic was repeated twenty years later with the early-00s trip of Hiroshi Tanahashi, Shinsuke Nakamura, and Katsuyori Shibata. This group found great success, but not together. The company has recently revitalized the title, bestowing it upon Ren Narita, Shota Umino, and Yota Tsuji, dubbed the Reiwa Musketeers, despite all three being in different official units.\n\nMulti-Man Tag Team Matches\n\n“Road to” shows, and the undercards of most second and third-tier events, are entirely multi-man tags and Young Lion matches. Each match is centered around one pairing of wrestlers or tag teams, supported by other members of their faction. Over the course of a tour, the supporting faction members will shift, but the core pairing remains the same.\n\nThese matches simultaneously serve multiple purposes, all of them essential.\n\nPurpose #1: build an upcoming match. The multi-mans are not just busy work: they almost always give some insight into how the core pairing wrestlers will interact. In some cases, the story of a match is established, usually with one wrestler harming an arm or leg during the match or in a post-match scrum. There is a drawback to this: one might be “spoiled” when the match incorporates these sequences into the big culminating match. But New Japan wrestlers generally change things up enough that this prior knowledge actually enhances the match.\n\nPurpose #2: cultivate intra-faction chemistry and reinforce faction hierarchy. As noted, factions can be fluid in who challenges for titles and such, but the hierarchy of the faction remains resolute. Part of this is undergirded by multi-man tag results. One of the core pairing wrestlers often pins a junior heavyweight from the other team. But another common finish is found when the leader of a faction is not one of the core pairing wrestlers, but support: they score the fall. But sometimes, when the leader is in the core pairing, the person on their side scoring the fall does so to cement them as the #2.\n\nIt is equally important to pay attention to who takes the fall. Just as a wrestling scoring falls signals their ascent in the hierarchy, someone taking fewer falls could signal a change in their status. A good example of this is El Desperado. Desperado was a pin eater for a period of time in Suzuki-gun, clearly the subordinate in his tag team with Yoshinobu Kanemaru. Then, a switch occurred: Kanemaru started taking these multi-man falls instead of Desperado. It was a clear sign of a shake-up.\n\nPurpose #3:lay the foundations for future pushes and/or inter-faction rivalry. Because wins and losses are not arbitrary in New Japan, a lot can be learned from paying attention to the wrestler that scores falls in the multi-mans, and who takes the falls. In many cases, they are a glimpse into the future. One technique New Japan often utilizes is having wrestlers wrack up falls in multi-mans to accrue credibility and validate future pushes. Likewise, at the end of tours, future programs are set in place during multi-man tags.\n\nBackstage Comments\n\nStorytelling in New Japan is simple. Programs emerge from the matchmaking: at either the beginning or end of a tour, wrestlers interact during seemingly inconsequential multi-man tag matches. From there, a feud begins. Title programs are slightly different; after a title match, a wrestler often emerges from backstage to either attack or challenge a titleholder in the ring.\n\nThe key element here is that the important things–the catalysts, escalations, interactions, physical conflicts, promos, etc.–almost always happen in the ring. It can feel a bit sparse, but everything you need to engage with an angle/program is easily consumed.\n\nBut not all New Japan promos take place in the ring. In fact, almost every single wrestler speaks to the gathered cameras and media backstage after a televised match. These “backstage comments” are uploaded to either:\n\nNJPW World (as long continuous video of every backstage comment)\n\nNJPW World YoTtube (separated by match, with the backstage comments of everyone that participated in the match)\n\nNJPW World’s Twitter (separated by individual wrestlers)\n\nThey generally last between one-to-two minutes, although some go longer. Some wrestlers talk ceaselessly, especially the older veterans. Some wrestlers do entire bits and sketches. Some wrestlers spew platitudes or babble. Some deliver exquisitely pithy monologues. The backstage comments are the best place to find this sort of differentiation amongst the roster.\n\nAt their peak, backstage comments provide something as exceptional as KENTA’s great “All’s Well That Ends Well Promo,” in which he uses his victory over Hiroshi Tanahashi at Power Struggle 2020 as a chance to tell a personal story of a meal he shared with Tanahashi, Shinsuke Nakamura, and Asuka when KENTA was still Hideo Itami in WWE. Without question, you could skip this promo and easily follow the story, but by watching it you gain so very much:\n\nSpeaking of YOSHI-HASHI, here is Juice Robinson threatening to literally murder him during G1 Climax 32:\n\nAnd, more recently, here’s Shota Umino showing glimpses of why he’s been pegged as a future ace, drawing upon childhood memories of Yujiro Takahashi prior to their New Japan Cup 2023 match:\n\nThe Young Lion Dojo System\n\nOne of the trademarks of New Japan is its dojo system, which has produced some of the greatest wrestlers in the history of the medium. The roll-call of names is stunning, to name just a handful: Yoshiaki Fujiwara, Satoru Sayama, Jushin Liger, Masahiro Chono, Shinya Hashimoto, Keiji Mutoh, Hiroshi Hase, Hiroshi Tanahashi, Shinsuke Nakamura, Katsuyori Shibata, Prince Devitt, Tetsuya Naito, Kazuchika Okada, Jay White, and so many more.\n\nThe system is defined by simplicity and an almost ascetic limitation on what Young Lions can do in the ring. The training is intense, with outrageous amounts of squats, pushups, neck rolls, and runs. There’s a heavy emphasis on grappling. When trainees actually make their in-ring debut, they begin with 10-minute time-limit matches against each other, always ending in draws. Their gear: black trunks and boots. Their moveset: forearms, stomps, bodyslam, hip toss, dropkick. They are allowed to finish matches with a Boston crab. It is this minimalist base from which legends of the business emerged.\n\nYoung Lions eventually move through a gradual pattern. Eventually, they are able to defeat each other. Slowly, they incorporate a few suplexes and signature moves into their arsenal. They challenge veterans, gaining momentum but never winning. Eventually, they have a big send-off and are sent to either Mexico, England, or the United States for an “excursion,” a two-to-three year period where they experience another culture, wrestling and otherwise.\n\nWhen they return, they enter a unit or remain with the New Japan Main Unit. Their return is as hyped as their departure for excursion. New Japan places heavy emphasis and loyalty on those that have made it through their system, native and foreign. You rarely see them give up on a Dojo graduate, no matter how shaky their return. Likewise, fans will follow a wrestler, supporting them from their debut, similar to an idol in music.\n\nThe dojo system also plays into New Japan’s global aspirations. In 2019, the company established the LA Dojo in Los Angeles. Previously, New Japan ran an American dojo in the early 2000s, through which such wrestlers as Brian Danielson, Samoa Joe, Lyoto Machida, and TJ Perkins emerged. This new incarnation was settled with Katsuyori Shibata as the head trainer. The pandemic stilted plans, but already feuds have been sparked between Japan’s Noge Dojo and the new LA Dojo, suggesting a new phase of generational rivalries.\n\nPromotional Alliances\n\nNew Japan has partnerships with several wrestling promotions, an international alliance to varying degrees of mutualistic benefit. Some of these allegiances stretch back decades, while some are more recent, but all of them play a crucial role in the company’s long-term mission.\n\nNew Japan currently has partnerships with:\n\nMexico – CMLL (Consejo Mundial de Lucha Libre)\n\nThe United Kingdom – Revolution Pro Wrestling\n\nThe United States – Impact Wrestling\n\nThe United States – Ring of Honor\n\nThe United States – All Elite Wrestling\n\nThe first three are the most important, as these are the promotions where New Japan currently sends their Young Lions on excursion. These partnerships also result in co-promoted events. New Japan often runs a handful of shows in the UK every year, co-promoted with Rev Pro, and heavily featuring Rev Pro talent. In the United States, New Japan has run WrestleMania Weekend shows with Impact.\n\nBut the biggest co-promoted tour, by far, is Fantasticamania. Traditionally run after Wrestle Kingdom, Fantasticamania is a two-week period where CMLL essentially takes over New Japan. Fans bring Mexican flags to shows, cheer the technicos, and boo the rudos. It is a genuine celebration of lucha libre. New Japan wrestlers who did their excursions often participated in these shows, sometimes donning the personas they had while in Mexico. Fantasticamania is the most inessential tour on the calendar, but possibly the most joyous.\n\nCo-promoted Events:\n\nJanuary/February: Fantasticamania (w/ CMLL)\n\nJune: Forbidden Door (w/ AEW)\n\nNovember: Historic X-Over (w/ Stardom)\n\nThese do not include New Japan’s work with companies such as All Japan Pro Wrestling and Pro Wrestling NOAH. The current higher-ups at New Japan have expressed a much firmer desire to co-promote with domestic rivals in the post-pandemic environment, especially with talent sharing on particular shows. It should be expected that more of these cross-overs will occur.\n\nNJPW Units & Roster Members\n\nCHAOS\n\nFounded: April 23, 2009\n\n1st Leader: Shinsuke Nakamura (April 29, 2009 – January 6, 2016)\n\n2nd and Current Leader: Kazuchika Okada (January 5, 2016 – Present)\n\nCurrent Members (by order of join date): Tomohiro Ishii, Toru Yano, Rocky Romero, YOSHI-HASHI, Kazuchika Okada, Hirooki Goto, YOH, Robbie Eagles, Lio Rush\n\nOriginal Members: Shinsuke Nakamura, Toru Yano, Tomohiro Ishii, Gedo, Jado, Giant Bernard, Karl Anderson, Black Tiger V\n\nProminent Former Members: Will Ospreay, Jay White, Tetsuya Naito, Robbie Eagles, SHO, Kazushi Sakuraba\n\nCHAOS is increasingly hard to define. For the entirety of the recent New Japan peak (2012-2020), the group has been at the forefront, led first by the immensely popular Shinsuke Nakamura and then by the dominant champion Kazuchika Okada.\n\nThe group was a staunchly heel faction when it formed in April 2009, the result of several members of Great Bash Heel turning on Togi Makabe and siding with Nakamura. Gradually, the group became a face unit, and a ridiculously successful one. The group accounts for EIGHT IWGP/World Heavyweight title reigns, as well as:\n\nSix Intercontinental title reigns\n\nFive Heavyweight Tag Team titles\n\nSix Junior Heavyweight runs\n\nFourteen Junior Heavyweight Tag Team championships\n\nFive G1 Climaxes\n\nThree New Japan Cups\n\nThree World Tag Leagues\n\nTwo Best of the Super Juniors\n\nFive Junior Tag Leagues\n\nThirteen NEVER Openweight championships\n\nThree NEVER Openweight 6-Man titles\n\nThat said, the saturation of the group, as well as multiple turns, has left the group largely amorphous. They often team with Hontai members in multi-man tag matches. Even further, some members end up teaming with former Great Bash Heel stablemates. You can’t escape CHAOS, but you also can’t determine them, either. Unless, of course, they are celebrating in the back when someone wins or defends a title. Ironically, despite losing their identity, they are the only group that consistently does that.\n\nKazuchika Okada\n\nNJPW Debut: August 26, 2007\n\nJoined CHAOS: January 4, 2012\n\nChampionships and Accomplishments:\n\n2 IWGP World Heavyweight Championships\n\n5 IWGP Heavyweight Championships\n\n1 NEVER Openweight 6-Man Tag Team Championship (with Hiroshi Tanahashi and Tomohiro Ishii)\n\n4 G1 Climaxes (2012, 2014, 2021, 2022)\n\n2 New Japan Cups (2013, 2019)\n\nOne of the most consequential wrestlers alive, and the face of the company. Upon his return to New Japan from excursion on January 4, 2012, Okada made an immediate impact, ending Hiroshi Tanahashi’s historic title reign a month later, the legendary “Rainmaker Shock” moment. His full ascension to the throne of New Japan in 2015 has changed the global wrestling landscape, particularly his match with Kenny Omega at Wrestle Kingdom 11 in 2017, which launched Omega as a worldwide superstar and put him on the path to executive vice presidentship. The story of Tetsuya Naito chasing Okada, starting in 2016 and culminating in 2020, brought New Japan to unprecedented heights.\n\nOkada’s matches are the perfect entry point for New Japan. He has defined the main event style of the company, with slow, methodical starting periods that gradually build in escalation until reaching a blistering climax, often with finishing sequences of unbelievable complexity. He uses a bounty of signature moves, which some consider formulaic; they work because of Okada’s charisma and his remarkable intuition for when to use them in a match.\n\nWhen Okada went onto the Wrestling Observer Hall of Fame ballot in 2021, he received 92% of the vote. Historically, that places him behind only Kenta Kobashi and Jushin Liger. At only 34, he is already a living legend of mythical proportions. Explicitly promoted as the inheritor to founder Antonio Inoki’s will (and robe collection), Kazuchika Okada’s legacy is growing incredibly.\n\nTomohiro Ishii\n\nNJPW Debut: December 11, 2004\n\nJoined CHAOS: April 23, 2009\n\nChampionships and Accomplishments:\n\n1 IWGP Tag Team Championship (with Toru Yano)\n\n6 NEVER Openweight Championships\n\n3 NEVER Openweight 6-Man Tag Team Championships (1 – with Beretta and Toru Yano, 1 – with Hirooki Goto and Yoshi-Hashi, 1 – with Kazuchika Okada and Hiroshi Tanahashi)\n\nBuilt like a solid steel mailbox, and possessing some of the staunchest striking and spirit in the company, Ishii has established himself in the heavyweight ranks. He is not only one of the best in New Japan, and not merely amongst the best in the world; he is one of the greatest in-ring wrestlers in the history of the business. Ishii has placed in the top 10 of the Most Outstanding Wrestler category of the fan-voted Wrestling Observer Awards for nine straight years, from 2013 to 2021. No other wrestler has placed in the category every year during this timeframe. Not Omega, not Okada… just Ishii.\n\nSome consider his match structure and techniques formulaic. There is some truth to that. If you are uninterested in stiff strike exchanges, perfectly executed no-selling, and dramatics so compelling they make a match feel like a legitimate strong style battle, then Tomohiro Ishii is not your man. But, through these idiosyncrasies, the stalwart of the NEVER division has found success both in Japan and in America, where his popularity rivals the company’s top performers.\n\nHirooki Goto\n\nNJPW Debut: July 6, 2003\n\nJoined CHAOS: March 12, 2016\n\nChampionships and Accomplishments:\n\n2 IWGP Intercontinental Championships\n\n4 IWGP Tag Team Championships (1 – with Katsuyori Shibata, 3 – YOSHI-HASHI)\n\n1 IWGP Junior Heavyweight Tag Team Championship (with Minoru Tanaka)\n\n5 NEVER Openweight Championships\n\n2 NEVER Openweight 6-Man Tag Team Championships (1 – with Yoshi-Hashi and Tomohiro Ishii, 1 – with YOSHI-HASHI and Yoh)\n\n1 STRONG Openweight Tag Team Championship (with YOSHI-HASHI)\n\n1 – G1 Climax (2008)\n\n3 New Japan Cups (2009, 2010, 2012)\n\n4 World Tag Leagues (2012 – with Karl Anderson, 2014 – with Katsuyori Shibata, 2021 and 2022 – with Yoshi-Hashi)\n\n1 Young Lion Cup (2005)\n\nHirooki Goto also has a bounty of accomplishments since arriving as a Young Lion in 2003: 2-time IWGP Intercontinental champion, 3-time IWGP Tag Team champion, 5-time NEVER Openweight champion, 2008 G1 Climax winner, 3-time New Japan Cup winner (2009, 2010, 2012), 4-time World Tag League winner (with three different partners). He’s one of the most decorated active wrestlers on the roster, with incredible longevity… but there is one title missing, the IWGP World title.\n\nGoto has challenged for the IWGP (World) Heavyweight Championship eight times, coming short every time. As in traditional sports, this has increasingly overwhelmed the discourse on Goto. He has assumed the mantle many pro athletes attain: the guy that can’t get it done. And it certainly doesn’t help that he joined CHAOS in 2016 after losing a title match to Okada for the third time in his career. But, as the list above proves, Goto is an exceptional wrestler with an impressively voluminous moveset. He is also an adorable dad.\n\nYOSHI-HASHI\n\nNJPW Debut: July 6, 2008\n\nJoined CHAOS: December 28, 2011\n\nChampionships and Accomplishments:\n\n3 IWGP Tag Team Championships (all with Hirooki Goto)\n\n2 NEVER Openweight 6-Man Tag Team Championships (1 – with Hirooki Goto and Tomohiro Ishii, 1 – with Hirooki Goto and YOH)\n\n1 STRONG Openweight Tag Team Championship (with Hirooki Goto)\n\n2 World Teag Leagues (2021 and 2022 – both with Hirooki Goto)\n\nYOSHI-HASHI had one of the most hilariously unfavorable returns in New Japan history, if not wrestling history: a dual-return match at Wrestle Kingdom 6 against Kazuchika Okada. Within a month, Okada would be IWGP champion. YOSHI-HASHI, unfortunately, has yet to win an IWGP singles title.\n\nYOSHI-HASHI has turned into a very exciting and dynamic wrestler, his matches full of superkicks, spirited screaming, and cool moves. Of course, his breakthrough came during the pandemic, where he seemingly put everything together. He cut his awful hair and started spamming superkicks and big moves. Now his physical action matches his vocal energy. Since then he has won the IWGP Tag Team championships twice, won two World Tag Leagues, and almost single-handedly legitimized the NEVER Openweight 6-Man Tag Team Titles.\n\nToru Yano\n\nNJPW Debut: May 18, 2002\n\nJoined CHAOS: April 23,2009\n\nChampionships and Accomplishments:\n\n3 IWGP Tag Team Championships (1 – with Togi Makabe, 1 – with Takashi Iizuka, 1 – with Tomohiro Ishii)\n\n4 NEVER Openweight 6-Man Tag Team Championships (2 – with Jay Briscoe and Mark Briscoe, 1 – with Trent Beretta and Tomohiro Ishii, 1 – with Ryusuke Taguchi and Togi Makabe)\n\n2 KOPW Championships (2020, 2021)\n\nEven as a comedy wrestler, Toru Yano is an acquired taste. While harmless, many utterly despise him. Many others (especially domestic Japanese crowds) adore his ring frivolity. Undoubtedly, Yano is a unique presence in New Japan Pro Wrestling. His devious style has netted Yano three IWGP Heavyweight Tag Team Championships and two KOPW championships.\n\nYano provides variety with his comic relief, but his comic relief doesn’t have much variety. He has a limited amount of tools (rolls of athletic tape, turnbuckle cushions, and elaborately orchestrated low blows, mostly); the burden is on Yano to make the matches interesting from that narrow palette. Every so often, Yano mixes in his amateur wrestling background, as well as his notoriously strong grip and preposterously loud voice.\n\nYOH\n\nNJPW Debut: November 19, 2012\n\nJoined CHAOS: 9 October 9, 2017\n\nChampionships and Accomplishments:\n\n5 IWGP Junior Heavyweight Tag Team Championships (All with SHO)\n\n1 NEVER Openweight 6-Man Tag Team Championship ( with Hirooki Goto and Yoshi-Hashi)\n\n1 Super Jr. Tag Tournament (2017 – with SHO)\n\n3 Super Junior Tag Leagues (2018 and 2019 – with SHO, 2022 – with Lio Rush)\n\n“They say I don’t have emotions. But this is also part of pro wrestling… Wrestling wouldn’t be interesting if everyone was the same, if there weren’t people like this.” Those were the words of YOH on May 25th, 2022, after defeating his perpetual rival Hiromu Takahashi. It sums up YOH, who is effortlessly great at everything, but even after five Junior tag title reigns and four Super Junior Tag League triumphs, singles success eludes him.\n\nYOH has shown the ability to wrestle any match style, a level of adaptability on par with his abnormal athleticism. But he is expectedly above average. Without the panache, some are left uninspired. The course correction through Best of the Super Juniors 30 is an unrestrained, cartoonish personality shift.\n\nYOH won the Observer Rookie of the Year award in 2013. A decade later, and entering his mid-30s, we are still waiting for the company to follow through on that.\n\nLio Rush\n\nNJPW Debut: November 20, 2022\n\nJoined CHAOS: November 23, 2022\n\nChampionships and Accomplishments:\n\n1 Super Junior Tag League (2022 – with YOH)\n\nSome people are just made to wrestle in Japan. A veteran of eight years and still only 28, Rush is a fascinating performer. Exceedingly ambitious (to controversial levels, at times) and unfathomably quick, his dexterity in the ring is astounding. Rush was released by WWE during the pandemic, and has drifted since then, popping up in AEW, on New Japan Strong, retiring, releasing music… but his performance in the 2022 Super Junior Tag League, his first time wrestling for the company in Japan, showed how well he fit into New Japan, an effervescent addition to the roster. His performance against Hiromu Takahashi on the New Japan Cup 2023 final card confirmed that Rush is an otherworldly wrestler and a potential foundational piece of the Junior heavyweight division moving forward.\n\nRocky Romero\n\nNJPW Debut: October 6, 2002\n\nJoined CHAOS: October12, 2010\n\nChampionships and Accomplishments:\n\n1 IWGP Junior Heavyweight Championship (as Black Tiger)\n\n8 IWGP Junior Heavyweight Tag Team Championship (2 – with Davey Richards, 2 – with Alex Koslov, 4 – with Trent Beretta)\n\n1 Super Jr. Tag Tournament (2016 – with Trent Beretta)\n\nYou wouldn’t expect Night 9 of the Best of the Super Juniors to hold many landmark matches, but it does hold one: Rocky Romero vs. El Phantasmo, May 24, 2019 at Korakuen Hall. Pushed to the brink of the 30 minute time limit, and with El Phantasmo’s undefeated record (5-0) in that year’s Super Juniors on the line, the closing stretch of that match reached sensationally dramatic heights. The crowd was raucously frenzied, clamoring for Rocky to defeat the loathsome Head Banga. When Rocky pulled it out, the eruption was overwhelming. Rocky’s Roppongi 3K proteges, SHO and YOH, hit the ring in spontaneous delight. It was a peak moment during peak New Japan. That is what Rocky is capable of, beyond his general comedic demeanor, or the exhaustion he must feel balancing so many different roles outside the ring. Rocky has wrestled 773 matches in New Japan, one of the most ever for a foreigner. He’s more than earned that distinction.\n\nLos Ingobernables de Japon\n\nFounded: November 21, 2015\n\n1st and Current Leader: Tetsuya Naito\n\nOriginal Members: Tetsuya Naito, EVIL, BUSHI\n\nCurrent Members (by order of join date): Tetsuya Naito, BUSHI, Hiromu Takahashi, Shingo Takagi, Titan\n\nProminent Former Members: EVIL, SANADA\n\nThe most popular faction in New Japan, they propel the storylines, main title picture, and sell an unfathomable amount of merchandise.\n\nThe history of Los Ingobernables de Japon is hard to separate from the history of Tetsuya Naito. Prior to 2015, Naito was a prodigy known as the Stardust Genius, a nod to his preternatural ability to construct matches. Unfortunately, that only took him so far. The greatest indignity was when his match-up with Kazuchika Okada for the IWGP Heavyweight title at Wrestle Kingdom 8 was voted out of the main event, losing a fan vote to the Shinsuke Nakamura vs. Hiroshi Tanahashi Intercontinental title match.\n\nNaito found his career in flux in 2015 and went to Mexico to sort things out. Like Nakamura, he returned with an entirely new persona: a brazenly cavalier attitude, the byproduct of having joined Rush and La Sombra’s immensely popular Los Ingobernables stable.\n\nBy the time he won the IWGP Heavyweight title from Kazuchika Okada at Sakura Genesis 2016, and then lost it back to Okada at Dominion a couple months later, it was a fait accompli for Naito to take the top spot in popularity. Greatly helping him was his new stable; not only EVIL and BUSHI, but SANADA, who debuted in New Japan by helping Naito defeat Okada for the title.\n\nThat’s like a decidedly heel action, and the group were explicitly heelish until Hiromu Takahashi joined the group in December 2016. Takahashi’s relentless, crazed energy and whimsical eccentricities single-handedly babyfaced the group. The disinterested frostiness of the group had no choice but to thaw under Takahashi’s endearing antics.\n\nSince then, the IWGP (World) Heavyweight title has largely been held by LIJ or LIJ adjacent acts. Naito won both the Intercontinental and Heavyweight titles at Wrestle Kingdom 14. He lost the titles to EVIL, who had betrayed the group to join BULLET CLUB. His first defense: Hiromu Takahashi. Shingo Takagi, who joined the group in 2018 after he departed Dragongate, held the title for nearly nine months in 2021. More recently, SANADA chose to forsake the group and join Just Four Guys; he immediately won the title and entered a program with Takahashi. Long a defiantly insular group, as it splinters LIJ’s web is starting to envelop the company.\n\nTetsuya Naito\n\nNJPW Debut: May 27, 2006\n\nJoined LIJ: November 21, 2015 (joined the original Los Ingobernables in CMLL on May 27, 2015)\n\nChampionships and Accomplishments:\n\n3 IWGP Heavyweight Championships\n\n6 IWGP Intercontinental Championships\n\n1 IWGP Junior Heavyweight Tag Team Championship (with Yujiro Takahashi)\n\n2 IWGP Tag Team Championships (1 – with Yujiro Takahashi, 1 – with SANADA)\n\n1 NEVER Openweight Championship (1 time)\n\n2 G1 Climaxes (2013, 2017)\n\n1 New Japan Cup (2016)\n\nTetsuya Naito’s popularity is not a debatable subject: he is the most popular wrestler in New Japan Pro Wrestling, the most popular wrestler in Japan altogether, and one of the most popular wrestlers in the history of Japanese wrestling.\n\nThe rise and peak of New Japan is almost completely aligned with Tetsuya Naito’s chase of the IWGP Heavyweight Championship, the Wrestle Kingdom main event slot in the Tokyo Dome, and Kazuchika Okada. Naito’s explosion of popularity provided a sturdy platform upon which the company’s profits and profile rose globally.\n\nA key element of that is not merely Naito’s persona, but his ability. Naito matches are thoughtful and erudite, but accessibly traditional. He has a specific sense of when to introduce an emotional element into a match, whether it be fury, composure, conceit, grandeur, or any of the plethora of tones and moods in his palette. Like Okada, he has a distinct cluster of signature moves that he employs, but he avoids feeling repetitive.\n\nHis journey to the title culminated at the 2020 Dome show. That should have signaled an end to the New Japan peak era, but a red hot angle with KENTA indicated that Naito’s triumph was not a culmination, but a catalyst to a new and equally impressive era.\n\nThen… the world went to hell. Still a genius of the ring, with a fervent desire to main even Wrestle Kingdom once more, and still the most popular wrestler in the country (as attested to the outrageous amount of LIJ merchandise in every crowd), Naito’s story might have climaxed but there are more chapters left to tell.\n\nShingo Takagi\n\nNJPW Debut: October 8, 2018 (had one match prior on July 20, 2007 when wrestling for Dragongate)\n\nJoined LIJ: October 8, 2018\n\nChampionships and Accomplishments:\n\nIWGP World Heavyweight Championship (1 time)[67]\n\nIWGP Junior Heavyweight Tag Team Championship (1 time) – with Bushi[68]\n\nNEVER Openweight 6-Man Tag Team Championship (1 time)[69] – with Bushi and Evil\n\nNEVER Openweight Championship (2 times)[70]\n\n1 KOPW Championship (2022)\n\nShingo Takagi was one of the most outstanding wrestlers in wrestling history before he ever stepped foot in New Japan, and his legend has increased exponentially since, due to an incredible catalog of matches. Escaping Dragongate in 2018–a messy time in Kobe–Shingo immediately confirmed his importance by debuting for the most popular faction in the company. Shingo spent the next year in the Junior division, a bizarre transition year where he went undefeated in the Best of the Super Juniors league play (losing the final to Will Ospreay), but never challenged for the title, nor facing anyone of significance (his non-BOSJ singles matches were against Young Lion Shota Umino and Yoshinobu Kanemaru).\n\nShingo moved to heavyweight in mid-2019. As he eased into the role, the pandemic hit and a number of factors overlapped, producing the conditions for Shingo to claim the IWGP World Heavyweight title in June 2021. His win came on the heels of a pair of remarkable matches against Will Ospreay (both in losing efforts), but Shingo has had great matches against nearly everyone, everywhere, for two decades. His matches are engulfed by his zealous intensity, power junior repertoire, and overwhelming determination. He’s one of the surest bets in the business.\n\nHiromu Takahashi\n\nNJPW Debut: August 24, 2010\n\nJoined LIJ: December 10, 2016\n\nChampionships and Accomplishments:\n\n5 IWGP Junior Heavyweight Championships\n\n4 Best of the Super Juniors (2018, 2020, 2012, 2022)\n\nHiromu might be the most genuinely adored wrestler in the company. Before Hiromu, LIJ generally acted like supercilious derelicts, frustrating opponents and desecrating sacred elements like title belts and sportsmanship. The group was instantly popular, but making a group like them endearing took a herculean effort; such is the power of Hiromu Takahashi’s likability.\n\nEssentially, Hiromu babyfaced his faction by carrying around a stuffed cat plushie and forcing the other group to treat it like a member. But Hiromu could have done it without a prop. He burst back into New Japan, winning the IWGP Junior Heavyweight Championship from KUSHIDA with a uniquely frenetic, uninhibited style. If it wasn’t totally reckless, it appeared reckless, the manic, sanguine contrast to KUSHIDA’s cooly phlegmatic approach.\n\nHiromu has since dominated the division, holding the Junior championship and/or winning Best of the Super Juniors pretty much any time he is active. But there is a distinct downside to that; the combination of a reckless style and intense schedule has not been kind to Hiromu. He suffered a scary spinal injury in 2018, missing over a year of action. He suffered a pectoral injury in 2021 which cost him another six months. Subsequently, Hiromu’s style has evolved, with less of the sublime irrationality of old, but sacrificing none of the intensity.\n\nBUSHI\n\nNJPW Debut: May 27, 2012\n\nJoined LIJ: November 21, 2015\n\nChampionships and Accomplishments:\n\n1 IWGP Junior Heavyweight Championship\n\n1 IWGP Junior Heavyweight Tag Team Championship (with Shingo Takagi)\n\n4 NEVER Openweight 6-Man Tag Team Championships (3 – with Evil and Sanada, 1 – with Evil and Shingo Takagi)\n\nA stalwart of the Junior division, BUSHI is a popular member of LIJ, even if he sits at the bottom of the groups pecking order. Originally in All Japan, BUSHI made the jump to New Japan in 2012. Despite enduring a sequence of unfortunate injuries in 2014-2015, in the years since he’s been consistently healthy, which is the best you can say for him. Although he’s found success in Mexico, winning the CMLL Welterweight title, he’s largely been a role-player in his home promotion. He will generally place in the upper-middle of a Best of the Super Juniors, will challenge for the Junior Heavyweight Tag Team belts periodically, and eat a lot of falls in multi-man tags. Of course, you can’t ignore him totally; he has the best tope suicida in the company, a legitimate highlight of every match.\n\nTitan\n\nNJPW Debut: January 18, 2013\n\nJoined LIJ: October 10, 2022\n\nChampionships and Accomplishments: None in New Japan Pro Wrestling\n\nFor one of the most exciting and dependably awesome wrestlers in the world, Titan’s induction into Los Ingobernables de Japon was one of the most awkward segments in recent memory for NJPW. Having assisted LIJ against the United Empire on October 10, 2022 at Declaration of Power, Titan spent an excruciatingly long period of time before removing his top mask, revealing himself to a befuddled crowd who barely remembered him.\n\nDespite that painful silence, Titan has been involved with New Japan dating back to 2013, and his performance during the 2022 Best of the Super Juniors was a highlight. Titan moves gracefully and fluidly through the ring, darting and flying, a pure lucha experience filtered through his worldly travels and knowledge. His reign as CMLL Welterweight champion has exceeded 1200 days, a record, and he is every bit the global ambassador that such a record would suggest. Along with Mistico, he carried Fantasticamania 2023, having great performances every night of the most unique tour on the New Japan schedule.\n\nYota Tsuji\n\nNJPW Debut: April 10, 2018\n\nJoined LIJ: June 3, 2023\n\nChampionships and Accomplishments: None\n\nYota Tsuji began his New Japan career in April 2018, which meant that his excursion was delayed by the COVID-19 global pandemic. This was particularly unfortunate, because Tsuji was so cheerfully vocal about his desire to wrestle in Mexico. The pandemic stifled that dream, but did not stunt his growth. Alongside Gabriel Kidd and Yuya Uemura, Tsuji wrestled an incredible amount of televised matches in 2020-2021, ending with a five match gauntlet in June 2021, plus bonus matches against Kota Ibushi and Tetsuya Naito. He then spent a year in England, before living his dream of wrestling for CMLL.\n\nTsuji re-debuted for the company at Wrestling Dontaku on May 3, 2023, a surprise return after a months-long campaign video hyping the return of a “monster” to Japan. He attacked SANADA, challenged the champion to a match at Dominion, and suggested himself as the new member of Los Ingobernables de Japon. He officially joined LIJ on June 3, 2023, and the next day pushed IWGP World Heavyweight Champion to the limit in his very first match back from excursion.\n\nNo longer a dark horse, Tsuji’s creativity might push him farther, much farther, than people expect. That certainly must have been on the mind of the company when they included him in the new Reiwa Musketeers with Ren Narita and Shota Umino, despite being in the class after those two. Tsuji responded acrimoniously to the distinction, suggesting that he truly will be an unruly force for years to come.\n\nHontai\n\nHiroshi Tanahashi\n\nNJPW Debut: October 10, 1999\n\nChampionships and Accomplishments:\n\n8 IWGP Heavyweight Championships]\n\n2 IWGP Intercontinental Championships\n\n3 IWGP United States Heavyweight Championships\n\n3 IWGP Tag Team Championship (1 – with Yutaka Yoshie, 1 – with Shinsuke Nakamura, 1 – with Kota Ibushi)\n\n1 NEVER Openweight Championship\n\n4 NEVER Openweight 6-Man Tag Team Championships (1 – with Michael Elgin and Yoshitatsu, 1 – with Manabu Nakanishi and Ryusuke Taguchi, 1 – with Ricochet and Ryusuke Taguchi, 1 – with Kazuchika Okada and Tomohiro Ishii)\n\n3 G1 Climaxes (2007, 2015, 2018)\n\n2 New Japan Cups (2005, 2008)\n\n2 IWGP U-30 Openweight Championships\n\n1 G2 U-30 Climax (2003)\n\n1 IWGP U-30 Openweight Championship League (2005)\n\nHe may not have the incredible (if inflated) attendance numbers of his predecessors, nor the international success of his successors (though he’s close), but the case the Hiroshi Tanahashi is the greatest wrestler of all time is a robust one:\n\nHe carried this company through a very dire period\n\nHe not only carried the company but resurrected it through his willpower and charisma\n\nHis matches are frequently cited as powerfully influential by some of the most consequential wrestlers of the modern era, including Jom Moxley, CM Punk, Brian Danielson, etc.\n\nWhen the time came to pass the torch, he did so (learning from some of his, ahem, less willing mentors), carefully bringing Okada up to legendary status with him\n\nHe’s spent the better part of the last decade building upon his drawing and in-ring legacy, while still solidifying new talent\n\nTanahashi famously called Antonio Inoki’s “strong style” moniker a curse. As someone who lived through the worst effects of that curse, and enduring through some of the most selfish wrestlers, Tanahashi emerged as one of the most important catalysts for the modern wrestling era. The way he emotes and displays a fiery, resolute determination is distinctly Japanese, but he combines it with American wrestling showmanship. He is paradoxically both inaccessible and engaging, delighting crowds with his famous air guitar routine to close out shows.\n\nAs Tanahashi creeps towards 50, his body is starting to betray him. He certainly can’t move with the nimbleness of even 3-4 years ago, but his wrestling aptitude is still so off-the-charts that his main events are still reliably great.\n\nShota Umino\n\nNJPW Debut: April 13, 2017\n\nChampionships and Accomplishments: None\n\nShota Umino is one of the more recent excursion returns, confronting Will Ospreay onNovember 5, 2022, but his history with New Japan stretches back deeply. Although he debuted in 2017 as a Young Lion, his time around a New Japan ring would rival anyone in the company; he is the son of head referee Red Shoes Unno, who has been with the company since 2001.\n\nUmino’s Young Lion tenure was notable, as Jon Moxley inexplicably took Shota under his wing during 2019, something which continued in the lead-up and aftermath of 2022’s AEW/NJPW Forbidden Door show. Unfortunately for Shota, this attachment has obfuscated some of his personality upon returning to Japan. He has Moxley’s entrance (and the literal jacket Moxley gave him, as some sort of massive talisman), Tanahashi’s pants, and Naito’s hair.\n\nWhat he doesn’t lack is self-confidence. He’s shown substantial, almost immediate growth in his backstage comments, and has all the tools and trademarks there for in-ring progress. Only 25, he’s the sort of “rookie” you expect to make the big second year jump. Being named one of the Reiwa Musketeers puts immense pressure on the youngster, but also provides him a base to build himself.\n\nKatsuyori Shibata\n\nNJPW Debut: July 21, 1999\n\nChampionships and Accomplishments:\n\n1 IWGP Tag Team Championship ( with Hirooki Goto)\n\n3 NEVER Openweight Championships\n\n1 New Japan Cup (2017)\n\n1 World Tag League (2014 – with Hirooki Goto)\n\nIn wrestling, there is an art to the debut, but there’s also an art to the exit, and Katsuyori Shibata’s relationship with NJPW is the exemplar of that notion. When Shibata first left New Japan in 2005, it was met with little fanfare, nor distress. Despite being one of the new Three Musketeers (with Shinsuke Nakamura and Hiroshi Tanahashi, an attempt to replicate the success of the Mutoh-Hashimoto-Chono triad), Shibata was exceeded by his peers and left during a nadir in the company.\n\nHis second departure was quite different. After returning to New Japan in 2012, Shibata slowly regained the trust of the fans (and a particularly sour Tanahashi). Shibata’s austere presentation and wrestling style turned him into a legitimate fan favorite and heartthrob. He won New Japan Cup 2017 and faced Kazuchika Okada at Sakura Genesis 2017 in one of the greatest matches of all time. Yet, a gruesome headbutt during the match left Shibata with a severe, potentially fatal subdural hematoma. Shibata recovered, but has wrestled one official match for the company since, shifting instead to running the LA Dojo. Unlike 2005, Shibata’s departure in 2017 was involuntary, and established him as a unique living legend. His returns to Japan have garnered some of the loudests reactions of the last several years.\n\nEl Phantasmo\n\nNJPW Debut: May 4, 2019 (one previous match on October 14, 2018 in England)\n\nJoined BULLET CLUB: May 4, 2019\n\nChampionships and Accomplishments:\n\n3 IWGP Junior Heavyweight Tag Team Championships (all with Taiji Ishimori)\n\n2 Super J-Cups (2019 and 2020)\n\nELP debuted in 2005, but his career really took off in 2017. The numbers are perplexing and incredulous: from 2005-2016, he averaged 20 matches a year, the low being 8 matches in 2014. In 2017, the year he debuted for England’s RevPro, he wrestled 42 matches. Then, in 2018… 137 matches! From there he debuted with New Japan in 2019, and almost from the outset he has been cultivated to be a potential babyface superstar.\n\nThe pandemic derailed ELP slightly, but nowhere near as much as others, because Phantasmo managed to make several trips to Japan, sometimes staying for months at a time. That admirable sacrifice was to our benefit, because ELP’s ringwork is world-class. His abilities as a flier and his ability to string together moves are amongst the absolute tip-top best in the world, but it’s the gift he has as a comedy troll wrestler that put him above the rest.\n\nAnd that is why he is such a potent babyface; he is detestable as a heel, but with a slight tweak the exact same insufferable mannerisms become charming. This was the slow burn set in place since his return to Japan in January 2021, after a year’s absence. His feel for a match and crowd control is otherworldly, and now that he has been expelled from BULLET CLUB, his potential is finally being tapped.\n\nMaster Wato\n\nNJPW Debut: January 3, 2016\n\nChampionships and Accomplishments:\n\n1 IWGP Junior Heavyweight Tag Team Championship (with Ryusuke Taguchi)\n\nHirai Kawato was an incredibly empathetic Young Lion. People loved him because of his inherent underdog charisma. Unfortunately, several things have worked against Master Wato:\n\nA shaky excursion in Mexico\n\nA oddly lame gimmick with a weird look\n\nReturning right in the worst stages of pandemic lockdowns\n\nHis backstage promos were stammering and unconvincing (when he wasn’t being interrupted by mentor-figure Hiroyoshi Tenzan), and his matches were replete with misfires and stumbles. Yet, Wato persevered. He amended his look, got in tremendous shape, and slowly asserted enough self-assurance to win crowds over again, as he did in a four-way match Junior Heavyweight title match at Wrestle Kingdom 15. His ringworm has exciting elements, and he is still in his mid-20s. He looks like he could run a marathon, and perhaps he has been all this time.\n\nRyusuke Taguchi\n\nNJPW Debut: November 22, 2002\n\nChampionships and Accomplishments:\n\n2 IWGP Junior Heavyweight Championships\n\n7 IWGP Junior Heavyweight Tag Team Championships (1 – with El Samurai, 4 – with Prince Devitt, 1 – with Ricochet 1 – with Master Wato)\n\n3 NEVER Openweight 6-Man Tag Team Championships (1 – with Manabu Nakanishi and Hiroshi Tanahashi, 1 – with Hiroshi Tanahashi and Ricochet, 1 – with Toru Yano and Togi Makabe)\n\n1 Best of the Super Juniors (2012)\n\n1 Young Lion Cup (2004)\n\n2 J Sports Crown Openweight 6 Man Tag Tournaments (2010 and 2011 – both with Prince Devitt and Hirooki Goto)\n\nRyusuke Taguchi is an irredeemable pervert, and his matches are generally constructed around the potpourri of salacious, scatological, defiantly stupid gimmicks he has amassed through his 20+ year career. Taguchi should work better than Yano because, unlike Yano, Taguchi is constantly refining his act, a gamut of both explicit or oddly abstract bits. The problem: Taguchi always sells the bit, and sometimes the bit is unsettling. Or embarrassing to watch.\n\nOf course, a lot of this is a smokescreen for one of the most proficient wrestlers on the roster. Tagcuhi’s ability to shift from a befuddled dope helplessly clutching his injured coccyx/anus/perineum to a refined, accomplished wrestler is truly remarkable. That said, his act can be exhausting, especially during a Best of the Super Juniors or Super Junior Tag League. But, when the inspiration is valid, he’s a joy to watch.\n\nKUSHIDA\n\nNJPW Debut: May 8, 2010\n\nChampionships and Accomplishments:\n\n6 IWGP Junior Heavyweight Championships\n\n3 IWGP Junior Heavyweight Tag Team Championships (2 w/ Alex Shelley, 1 w/ Kevin Knight)\n\n2 Best of the Super Juniors (2015, 2017)\n\n1 Super J-Cup (2016)\n\n1 Super Jr. Tag Tournament (2012 – with Alex Shelley)\n\nKUSHIDA certainly controlled the junior division from roughly 2015-2018, deservedly so considering that he is such a well-rounded, complete wrestler. But then, he became a victim of his success.\n\nWithout any interest on New Japan’s part to move him to heavyweight, and having exhausted all possibilities in the Junior division, KUSHIDA reluctantly went to WWE. Despite brief flashes of triumph, it was an unfortunate tenure. His return to New Japan has been even more cursed; at one point, KUSHIDA’s title shot against Taiji Ishimori was canceled because KUSHIDA contracted hand, foot, and mouth disease. KUSHIDA is still a superb wrestler, one of the legitimately captivating ground-based wrestlers alive. But he seems as lost in 2023 New Japan as he did in 2018.\n\nKevin Knight\n\nNJPW Debut: December 12, 2020\n\nChampionships and Accomplishments:\n\n1 IWGP Junior Heavyweight tag Team Championship (w/ KUSHIDA)\n\nWith an inconceivable amount of burst, and a dropkick with height that would make Okada jealous, Kevin Knight is one of the brightest prospects from Shibata’s L.A. Dojo. Like DKC, Knight had a couple of years in wrestling before debuting on NJPW Strong and accelerating his growth under Shibata’s tutelage. Knight was KUSHIDA’s partner in Super Junior Tag League, incredibly graduating from Young Lion status mid-tour and scoring a pinfall over Tiger Mask. That led to a title match against Catch 2/2 for the IWGP Junior Heavyweight Tag Team titles, with the newly-dubbed Intergalactic Jet Setters winning the championship. Considering how rarely rookies win titles in this company, even today, Knight appears to be a very big factor in future plans.\n\nAt only 26 years old and with less than 100 matches to his name, that future projects large. Finding the balance between his explosive athleticism and growing strength, Knight also displays a promising, humble attitude in backstage comments. Amongst the abundance of young talent emerging in the company, and the fierce battle to reach the top that is to come, the future ace might end up being a Jet from Atlanta.\n\nYuji Nagata\n\nNJPW Debut: September 14, 1992\n\nChampionships and Accomplishments:\n\n2 IWGP Heavyweight Championships\n\n2 IWGP Tag Team Championship (1 – with Manabu Nakanishi, 1 – with Wataru Inoue\n\n1 NEVER Openweight Championship\n\n1 G1 Climax (2001)\n\n2 New Japan Cups (2007 and 2011)\n\n1 G1 Tag League (2000 – with Takashi Iizuka)\n\n1 G1 Tag League (2010 – Wataru Inoue)\n\nWith his brutally resonant kicks and crisp suplexes, Yuji Nagata would have been a distinguished figure in any era; unfortunately for him, his time came during a very grim era for the company. Nagata debuted in 1992, and finally became IWGP Heavyweight Champion in 2002. Unfortunately, this reign was sandwiched between two of the most preposterous decisions the company ever made:\n\nHaving soon-to-be champion Nagata face Mirko Flipovic, one of the greatest Mixed Martial Artist of all time, in a shoot MMA fight in December 2001\n\nHaving former champion Nagata face Fedor Emelienko, the greatest Mixed Martial Artist of all time, in a shoot MMA fight in December 2003\n\nNagata lasted 21 seconds in 2001, and 81 seconds in 2003. Keep in mind, Nagata’s 2002-2003 reign set the record for title defenses at 10. This was lunacy, the worst of Inoki’s 2000’s management. In retrospect, these losses did not irreparably damage Nagata. He went on to win the title again in 2007, as well as NOAH’s GHC Championship in 2014 and All-Japan’s Triple Crown Championship in… 2023. Nagata has been so good for so long, he is still winning world titles.\n\nSatoshi Kojima\n\nNJPW Debut: July 16, 1991\n\nChampionships and Accomplishments:\n\n2 IWGP Heavyweight Championships\n\n7 IWGP Tag Team Championships (6 – with Hiroyoshi Tenzan, 1 – with Manabu Nakanishi)\n\n2 NEVER Openweight 6-Man Tag Team Championships (1 – with Matt Sydal and Ricochet, 1 – with David Finlay and Ricochet (1)[78]\n\n1 G1 Climax (2010)\n\n1 Super Grade Tag League (1998 – with Keiji Mutoh (1998)\n\n2 G1 Tag Leagues (2001 and 2008 – with Hiroyoshi Tenzan)\n\n1 Young Lion Cup (1994)\n\nWith massive arms and personality, Kojima played a more significant role in the resurgence of New Japan than he is credited. Kojima debuted in 1991, after Hiroyoshi Tenzan but before Yuji Nagata, Kojima spent eleven years languishing in New Japan before spurning Inoki’s vision for 2000’s New Japan and leaving for All-Japan with Keiji Mutoh. It was a remarkably shrewd decision. He won the Triple Crown Championship on February 16, 2005. Incredibly, he won the IWGP Heavyweight Championship from Tenzan four days later, the first person to hold the top two championships in Japan simultaneously.\n\nAfter the controversial match, Kojima blithely tossed the IWGP belt at Shinsuke Nakamura, which ignited a near riot as Hiroshi Tanahashi stormed out of the ring and chased Kojima down the aisleway. Six years later, Tanahashi would later challenge Kojima for that title at Wrestle Kingdom V, winning it to begin his record-setting 11-defense reign. That reign, in turn, would set the stage for Okada’s return. Kojima’s main weapon is the lariat, a smart decision since his arms are ludicrously massive. Even in his 50’s, Kojima is a specimen, larger than nearly all the younger wrestlers. Mostly genial but with a streak of volatility, Kojima is the most viable member of his generation still competing.\n\nHiroyoshi Tenzan\n\nNJPW Debut: November 6, 1990\n\nChampionships and Accomplishments:\n\n4 IWGP Heavyweight Championships\n\n12 IWGP Tag Team Championship (5 – with Masahiro Chono, 6 – with Satoshi Kojima, 1 – with Osamu Nishimura)\n\n3 G1 Climaxes (2003, 2004, 2006)\n\n3 G1 Tag Leagues (2001 and 2008 – with Satoshi Kojima, 2003 – with Osamu Nishimura)\n\n1 Super Grade Tag League (1995 – with Masahiro Chono)\n\n2 G1 Tag Leagues (2001 and 2008 – with Satoshi Kojima)\n\n1 Young Lion Cup 1993\n\nCertainly, that list of accomplishments places Hiroyoshi Tenzan amongst the greatest New Japan competitors of all time. So why does his name never arise in discussion of all-time greats? Here’s a quick stat: those 4 IWGP Heavyweight Championship reigns, tied for 5th all time with Keiji Mutoh, amounts to a total of… 197 days. Less than 50 days per reign. Two total title defenses. For comparison, Mutoh’s four reigns amount to 1,238 days and 19 title defenses.\n\nThe company never committed to Tenzan, despite how over he was in the 00s, another eye-rolling strategy of that era. Watching Tenzan today doesn’t necessarily provide a glimpse into what fans at the time adored. He still does the Mongolian chops (even though he technically lost the move to Great-O-Khan), his suplexes are still technically sound, but his hips have lithified and his movements are the worst of the vets.\n\nTogi Makabe\n\nNJPW Debut: February 15, 1997\n\nChampionships and Accomplishments:\n\n1 IWGP Heavyweight Championship\n\n2 IWGP Tag Team Championships (1 – with Toru Yano, 1 – with Tomoaki Honma)\n\n2 NEVER Openweight Championships\n\n1 NEVER Openweight 6-Man Tag Team Championship (with Ryusuke Taguchi and Toru Yano)\n\n1 G1 Climax (2009)\n\n2 World Tag League (2015 and 2016 – with Tomoaki Honma)\n\nIn summer 2018, Kazuchika Okada gave a backstage comment where he promised to beat Togi Makabe so badly that people would shout, “That’s enough, Okada, he’s already dead!” That ended up being untrue, but Okada did say something that might have been true: that Makabe was the most well-known wrestler on the roster. For years now, Makabe has been a favorite on the Japanese talk show circuit, particularly for his obsessive love for sweets. The gap moe appeal is off the charts: this gruff, intimidating man with dyed hair and chains around his neck having a child’s taste palette.\n\nOf course, The Unchained Gorilla is respected in the wrestling world as well. He is a dojo product pre-dating the Tanahashi-Nakamura-Shibata coterie, a former IWGP Heavyweight champion, one of the great brawlers of his era, and he still moves fairly well compared to others of his generation. He is more sporadic these days, to the point that people place over-under bets on how many bumps he will take in a match, but crowds still love him; he always gets a noticeable response to the King Kong Knee Drop.\n\nTomoaki Honma\n\nNJPW Debut: September 2, 2004\n\nChampionships and Accomplishments:\n\n1 IWGP World Tag Team Championship (with Togi Makabe)\n\n2 World Tag League (2015 and 2016 – with Togi Makabe)\n\nTomoaki Honma is the ultimate sympathetic underdog. The last time he beat someone in a single match–besides Young Lions–was the 2016 G1 Climax. He also moves like he is wearing a medieval suit of armor with welded joints. Of course, he wouldn’t need armor, because no blade on Earth would have a chance against Honma’s leathery, mahogany skin. And yet, he is incredibly over. His series of matches with Togi Makabe and Tomohiiro Ishii in the mid-2010s were legendary for the fierceness of the action and the vociferousness of the crowd support for Honma.\n\nPrior to his move to New Japan in 2006, Honma was already something of a death match specialist. He is credited as the first wrestler to use light tubes in a match, so you have him to thank for that. He is a well accomplished brawler, though most of his matches since the early-2010s involve theatrical set-ups to his Kokeshi falling/diving headbutt, and a spectacular miss most of the time.\n\nTiger Mask IV\n\nNJPW Debut: January 4, 2002\n\nChampionships and Accomplishments:\n\n6 IWGP Junior Heavyweight Championships\n\n2 IWGP Junior Heavyweight Tag Team Championships (1 – with Jushin Thunder Liger, 1 – with Robbie Eagles)\n\n2 Best of the Super Juniors (2004 and 2005)\n\nThe longest wrestler to hold the Tiger Mask moniker, although probably the least renowned. The current incarnation has been in practice since 1995, and was trained by the original Tiger Mask, Satoru Sayama. Tiger Mask IV spent six years in Michinoku Pro, before moving to New Japan in 2002. A solid competitor, but lacking the otherworldly charisma of his elite peers, TM IV still stands as one of the premier juniors of his era. His work is robust, an all-around talent who sprinkles in flying, but generally works the ground and big moves. He seemed to be slowing down in the late 2010s, but after the pandemic and an injury hiatus, he seems rejuvenated. He won the IWGP Junior Heavyweight Tag Team championships with Robbie Eagles, and his work has recaptured a crispness and stiffness of his heyday. Of the Dads, he is the most overlooked, but possibly the most viable.\n\nGuerrillas of Destiny\n\nFounded: March 12, 2016\n\nLeader: No Official Leader (Though Tama Tonga Fits the Role)\n\nCurrent Members (by order of join date): Tama Tonga, Tanga Loa, Jado, Hikuleo\n\nOriginal Members: Tama Tonga, Tanga Loa\n\nProminent Former Members: No former members\n\nThis isn’t necessarily a group, as much as an extended tag team, but if we stretch back to the roots of the tag team G.O.D. are one of the longest units in the company. They are second only to CHAOS, who have a loose gravitational connection to each other at this point, Guerrillas of destiny have a far sturdier bond: they are brothers. Even further, they are the sons of wrestling great Haku.\n\nHaku raised some great boys. Their work is stiff but energetic. Led by Tama, they present the sort of understated hubris that could only be inspired by the sports world. There is a genuineness to them, but also a sublime self-confidence. With Tanga Loa injured since 2022 and Hikuleo inexplicably sporadic in appearances, Tama Tonga has performed spectacularly as the leader of the group.\n\nTama Tonga\n\nNJPW Debut: May 8, 2010\n\nJoined GOD: March 12, 2016\n\nChampionships and Accomplishments:\n\n7 IWGP Tag Team Championship (all with Tanga Loa)\n\n2 NEVER Openweight Championships\n\n4 NEVER Openweight 6-Man Tag Team Championships (1 – with Bad Luck Fale and Yujiro Takahashi, 2 – with Bad Luck Fale and Tanga Loa, 1 – with Taiji Ishimori and Tanga Loa)\n\n1 World Tag League (2020 – with Tanga Loa)\n\nAfter over a decade with the company, and nearly as much time in the BULLET CLUB, as an original member of the unit, Tama’s persona had been pushed beyond its limits by 2021. In a never-ended wheel of IWGP World Tag Team title defenses and challenges, having won the title a record seven times with brother Tonga Loa (in less than five years, no less), Tama found himself in early 2021 playing a Mad Hatter sort of character, possessed by Takash’s Iizuka’s Iron Fingers. The nadir: a 27 minute ladder match with Taichi over the prop in May 2021.\n\nAnd then, during the G1 Climax that year, Tama wrestled all of his matches with honor and dignity, absolutely zero nonsense. The reward: he beat Kazuchika Okada. Clean. He would uneasily remain in BULLET CLUB until being ousted from the group inFebruary 2022. From there, it’s been all ascent. He started entering alongside Hiroshi Tanahashi, his steadfast, resolute expression a true reflection of his babyface power. Tama is authentic, his ring style and backstage comments exploding with conviction, the conviction that makes you believe in someone. He has a knack for when to fire up, when to break out his speed, when to call upon the crowd for support. He stepped up when his chance emerged, and there should be no limit on how far that could take him.\n\nTonga Loa\n\nNJPW Debut: April 1, 2016\n\nJoined GOD: March 12, 2016\n\nChampionships and Accomplishments:\n\n7 IWGP Tag Team Championship (all with Tama Tonga)\n\n3 NEVER Openweight 6-Man Tag Team Championships (2 – with Bad Luck Fale and Tanga Loa, 1 – with Taiji Ishimori and Tanga Loa)\n\n1 World Tag League (2020 – with Tama Tonga)\n\nSeveral wrestlers leveled up during the pandemic, and Tonga Loa stands amongst the most striking. After five years in WWE and a year-long bridge in Impact, Loa entered New Japan in March 2016. He went right into the Guerrillas of Destiny tag team with his brother Tama Tonga and did not budge from the position for years. Obviously this was greatly successful, winning seven tag titles. But besides a match in New Japan Cup 2017, Tanga did not have a singles match in Japan until February 2021.\n\nBut Tanga showed a fire and level of bruising, stiff viciousness unseen in the previous five years of tag team action. He performed admirably in G1 Climax 31. His matches against the likes of Shingo Takagi, Kota Ibushi, and Tomohiro Ishii revealed thatTanaga used his pandemic downtime wisely. Unfortunately, he has been on the shelf with injury since mid-2022, right as G.O.D. were booted from BULLET CLUB. When he returns, he projects to be a fruitful member of the NEVER division.\n\nHikuleo\n\nNJPW Debut: November 12, 2016\n\nJoined GOD: September 25, 2022\n\nChampionships and Accomplishments: None\n\nA collegiate basketball player standing 6’8” and over 250 pounds, Hikuleo has been with the company since 2016, and the process since has been glacial. That is largely because Hikuleo’s ACL was torn in 2018; when the dojo graduate was ready to return, a global pandemic halted his progress. Because of this, he was a mainstay on NJPW Strong, his story revolving around his relationship with Jay White. After White exiled Hikuleo’s brothers, Tama Tonga and Tanga Loa, Hikuleo was given an ultimatum: BULLET CLUB or G.O.D. Hikuleo not only chose G.O.D., he defeated White at New Beginning in Osaka 2023, banishing White from Japan. Despite the stipulation, Hikuleo largely didsappeared from Japan himself after the match. Hikuleo makes good use of his size, reminiscent of Kevin Nash with more athleticism but less charisma. At 31, Hikuleo has a good chance to be a unique force on the roster.\n\nJado\n\nNJPW Debut: March 19, 1989 (left shortly thereafter; reappeared once in 1994 before rejoining for good on 28 June 2001)\n\nJoined GOD: March 12, 2022\n\nChampionships and Accomplishments:\n\n1 IWGP Junior Heavyweight Championship\n\n4 IWGP Junior Heavyweight Tag Team Championships (all with Gedo)\n\n1 Super J Tag League (2010 – with Gedo)\n\nHe can’t bend his knees, he can’t twist his hips, and both his vertical leap and running speed top out in the single digits. Even so, Jado is the heart and soul of G.O.D. He was the bellwether of the group’s face turn in 2021; even while still in BULLET CLUB, Jado’s support for his team was jarringly sincere and honorable, a clear shift in tactics and demeanor. His defiance of longtime partner Gedo, and their subsequent series in tag matches, were oddly compelling, and produced notable crowd responses. And deservedly so, considering that Jado and Gedo had been together since 1989.\n\nUnited Empire\n\nFounded: October 16, 2020\n\n1st and Current Leader: Will Ospreay (October 16, 2020 – Present)\n\nCurrent Members (by order of join date): Will Ospreay, Great-O-Khan, Jeff Cobb, Aaron Henare, Kyle Fletcher, Mark David, TJP, Francesco Akira, Gideon Grey, Dan Maloney\n\nOriginal Members: Will Ospreat, Great-O-Khan, Bea Priestley\n\nProminent Former Member: Bea Priestley\n\nNew Japan is not a subtle company, especially with pushing wrestlers to the top. When it was Will Ospreay’s time, it did not matter that it came during the deepest throes of the pandemic in late 2020, or that those throes would continue on Japanese soil nearly two years further. Ospreay’s push came in succession:\n\nBetray Kazuchika Okada and leave CHAOS\n\nBring back Great-O-Khan from England to establish his new unit\n\nAssemble an international group of ambitious malcontents\n\nWin the New Japan Cup\n\nWin the IWGP World Heavyweight Title\n\nAll of this happened within six months (October 16, 2020 to April 4, 2021). Ospreay was forced to relinquish the title due to injury only six weeks later, but United Empire have not faltered. They have held court on the tag team titles in both the Heavyweight and Junior Heavyweight divisions for much of their run. They continue to add members from around the world. They perform well in both the New Japan Cup and G1 Climax. They win a resounding majority of their multi-man tags. And, despite having the best in-ring wrestler alive as their leader, each member produces their share of astoundingly great matches, both singles and tag team. In short, they are the strongest unit in the company, and possibly the most incredible collection of talent in the world.\n\nWill Ospreay\n\nNJPW Debut: April 10, 2016\n\nJoined United Empire: October 16, 2020\n\nChampionships and Accomplishments:\n\n1 IWGP World Heavyweight Championship\n\n1 IWGP United States Heavyweight Championship\n\n3 IWGP Junior Heavyweight Championships\n\n1 NEVER Openweight Championship\n\n1 New Japan Cup (2021)\n\n1 Best of the Super Juniors (2016 and 2019)\n\nWill Ospreay is a marvel, and we can pinpoint the exact moment when one of the greatest wrestlers to ever live was set on the most propitious path to his development: his singles match against IWGP Heavyweight Champion Kazuchika Okada on October 3, 2015 in Reading, England.\n\nFrom that match, Ospreay was brought to New Japan in March 2016 at Okada’s behest. So began a deliberate, multi-year process in which Ospreay slowly matured to the apex of the junior ranks, joined the heavyweight division in 2019, turned on Okada and formed his own faction in 2020, and won the world title in 2021. All while continuing to wrestle worldwide and seizing the title of Most Outstanding wrestler twice (2019 & 2022, with 2020 thwarted by COVID and 2021 by an injury hiatus).\n\nEarly Ospreay was certainly an unapologetic acrobat, brazenly performing mind-boggling feats with panache. As he progressed through New Japan, he solidified a set of signature moves and set a pattern. As a heavyweight, he abandoned that pattern, amalgamating aspects of his former aerial style with a new style reliant on lethal striking and power. A complete wrestler in every way, Ospreay is hitting his peak, one of the all-time peaks, as he enters his 30s. Injuries have eaten up large chunks of his 2021 and 2023, though, so savor whatever moments he provides.\n\nGreat-O-Khan\n\nNJPW Debut: February 25, 2016\n\nJoined United Empire: October 16, 2020\n\nChampionships and Accomplishments:\n\n2 IWGP Tag Team Championships (both with Jeff Cobb)\n\nAs a Young Lion, Tomoyuki Oka–former national wrestling champion of Japan–was a classic gut-wrenching technician. Thus, it’s a mystery why Oka was given this Great-O-Khan character, suggesting dynastic Mongolian heritage, but also a Jiangshi hopping vampire, yet dressing like a stately Mandarin bureaucrat (or a straight up Mandarinfish). To his credit, he has embraced the character wholeheartedly, all the way back to his excursion in England. O-Khan embraces pretty much everything, like the time when, in real life, he saved a young girl from an attacker and consoled her with pancakes until police arrived. O-Khan brought his certificate of recognition to the ring to taunt his opponents.\n\nO-Khan’s ring style remains firmly mat-based. O-Khan’s arsenal is replete with throws, suplexes, and deeply elaborate holds, but it is also theatrical. He uses Hiroyoshi Tenzan’s Mongolian chops (which he cleanly won the right to in a stipulation match, which Tenzan did not honor), and the iron claw with his excessively taped fingers. O-Khan has floated around the midcard and progression appears glacial. One wonders when the company will embrace this jock otaku hero, as he has embraced this bizarre persona.\n\nJeff Cobb\n\nNJPW Debut: November 18, 2017\n\nJoined United Empire: November 15, 2020\n\nChampionships and Accomplishments:\n\n2 IWGP Tag Team Championships (both with Great-O-Khan)\n\n1 NEVER Openweight Championship\n\nJeff Cobb is the powerhouse of New Japan; few in the world use their size and strength as spectacularly as he does. But timing is everything. If Jeff Cobb had joined a heel faction in 2019, or even early 2020, it would have been premature. Something about pre-pandemic Cobb– his character, his connection with the fans, his ring work–was very good but not clicking.\n\nThen, during G1 Climax 30 (2020), suddenly Cobb captured the spirit and charisma that he had displayed in other promotions. Everything fell into place: the timing, the sequencing, the stature… everything worked magnificently and it was revelatory. It was then that he joined the United Empire. His subsequent match with Shingo Takagi at Wrestle Kingdom 15 was an unexpected classic, and it was clear that Jeff Cobb was going to be a major factor in New Japan going forward.\n\nJeff Cobb is power and grace, amplified. Even with his massive frame, the power he generates is unfathomable, able to perform seemingly impossible moves on the largest wrestlers in the company. This only accentuates the grace of his dropkick and standing moonsault. He stalks the ring and mocks his opponent with such assurance that there are never dull, static, or complacent moments in a Jeff Cobb match.\n\nAaron Henare\n\nNJPW Debut: September 1, 2016\n\nJoined United Empire: Apri 4,l 2021\n\nChampionships and Accomplishments: None\n\nA menacing figure with pernicious striking ability, Aaron Henare’s chance might have finally arrived. There are no drawbacks to being patient with a wrestler, especially someone that came through the dojo system. With someone like Henare, one’s patience might have been stretched to the molecular level, watching him flounder in stasis for years, even after joining the United Empire in 2021.\n\nOf the United Empire’s members, Henare is the truest example of someone developing a more heelish style and persona after joining. Henare projected a rage-based character upon his entry to UE, and matches have incorporated his training in Muy Thai and kickboxing to reflect this. No one gets more out of a well-timed, demonstratively held body shot than Henare. It is a thing of beauty, and something worth waiting for, like his release felt with his rise.\n\nAussie Open (Kyle Fletcher and Mark Davis)\n\nNJPW Debut: April 10, 2022 (Fletcher had one prior match on August 31, 2019 in England; Davis had prior matches on October 14, 2018 and August 31, 2019, both in England)\n\nJoined United Empire: September 19, 2021\n\nChampionships and Accomplishments:\n\n1 IWGP World Heavyweight Tag Team Championship\n\n1 Strong Openweight Tag Team Championship\n\nIt’s a golden age for tag teams, with several openly competing for the status as the best tag team in the world; Aussie Open are the likely candidates to usurp that throne next. Finally reaching Japan in November 2022, reaching the World Tag League final and eventually winning the titles from Bishamon at Sakura Genesis 2023. They were supposed to come in sooner, but were derailed by the pandemic. During that time, they were nurtured by Will Ospreay, who soon brought them under the United Empire banner.\n\nBoth complement each other well. Kyle Fletcher’s angular features and gliding offense is a nice counterbalance to Mark Davis’ gruff, hirsute, ironclad striking and power moves. They make incredible use of the different paces each brings. And, considering their performances in New Japan Cup 2023, Aussie Open’s additional legacy could be as the starting point for two future singles stars. Their catalog grows commensurately to an absurdly dense schedule; their matches with FTR and Bishamon were not merely tag team match of the year candidates, but match of the year overall.\n\nTJP\n\nNJPW Debut: October 6, 2002\n\nJoined United Empire: September 26, 2021\n\nChampionships and Accomplishments:\n\n2 IWGP Junior Heavyweight Tag Team Championships (both with Francesco Akira)\n\n1 American Young Lions Tournament (2004)\n\nTJP is a virtuosic wrestler, as elegant as the form gets. His work is seamless, effortlessly amalgamating incongruous styles in fluid sequences. Because he started so young–beginning at 13 and finding himself in the famed original New Japan LA Dojo at 17–he’s equipped with an incredibly diverse arsenal.\n\nIncredibly, besides the 2011 Best of the Super Juniors, there was a fourteen year gap between TJP’s New Japan matches in 2005 and his return in 2019. In between, he wrestled nearly everywhere, most notably winning the legendary Cruiserweight Classic in WWE, followed by an infamous reign as the inaugural Cruiserweight Champion, with baffling booking and inhumanely atrocious scripting.\n\nIn New Japan, thankfully, he is a perfect fit. The scheduling keeps him fresh, delivering exquisite matches and unique backstage comments based around press-conference platitudes, assuredly learned from years of following his godawful local basketball team. A young veteran, TJP’s player-coach status feels distinctly earned, a benefit to everyone.\n\nFrancesco Akira\n\nNJPW Debut: May 15, 2022\n\nJoined United Empire: Apri 9,l 2022\n\nChampionships and Accomplishments:\n\n2 IWGP Junior Heavyweight Tag Team Championship (both with TJP)\n\nThe greatness of Catch 2/2, Francesco Akira’s team with TJP, is almost incomprehensible. Prior to their first match, on June 3 2022, Akira and TJP had never even shared the same ring. From literally day one, their matches have been masterpieces of pacing, eloquently shifting between the frenetic and the calculated. The team’s greatest asset might be their seemingly endless supply of captivating tandem offense, which TJP fully credits to this dynamic, high-strung 23 year-old Italian.\n\nAkira debuted at Best of the Super Juniors 29. He seemed to find solid footing by the end of the tournament, and then was immediately shuffled into Catch 2/2, a shrewd blessing to learn under TJP’s tutelage. Akira’s strengths are his indefatigable reserves of energy, his perpetual irritability, and his bounty of ideas. He has a preternatural ability to fill space with something interesting. He matches up well against anyone on the roster. New Japan clearly knows that they have something special in someone so good at such a young age.\n\nGideon Grey\n\nNJPW Debut: September 2, 2022 (one prior match on November 9, 2017 in England)\n\nJoined United Empire: August 23, 2022\n\nChampionships and Accomplishments: None\n\nLord Gideon Grey is the perfect orchestrator for the United Empire, manifesting their barbarous brutality into eloquent prose. He made his ring debut in Japan on September 2 2022, but his influence stretches much further back. As the manager for Great-O-Khan in the NJPW-affiliated English promotion RevPro, Grey is largely credited with helping that character move from bafflingly bizarre to endearingly bizarre. His reward has been his run with the United Empire. His ring style is pure comedy. Lacking physique or fiber of courage, he largely flees from opponents, his pallid, blanched complexion turned vermillion from the beating he endures. But, driven by his Plantagenet devotion to his colleagues, he manages to persevere until they can rescue him. In short, a perfect multi-man tag wrestler, legitimately funny and oddly captivating, akin to Gedo in BULLET CLUB.\n\nBULLET CLUB\n\nFounded: May 3, 2013\n\n1st Leader: Prince Devitt (May 3, 2013 – April 6, 2014)\n\n2nd Leader: AJ Styles (April 6, 2014 – January 5, 2016)\n\n3rd Leader: Kenny Omega (January 5, 2016 – October 30, 2018)\n\n4th Leader: Jay White (December 22, 2018 – February 18, 2023)\n\n5th and Current Leader: David Finlay (April 8, 2023 – Present)\n\nCurrent Members (by order of join date): Bad Luck Fale, Chase Owens, Taiji Ishimori, Gedo, KENTA, Chris Bey, Rock Hard Juice Robinson, Ace Austin, David Finlay, Clark Connors, Dan Moloney, Gabriel Kidd, Alex Coughlin\n\nOriginal Members: Prince Devitt, Karl Anderson, Bad Luck Fale, Tama Tonga\n\nProminent Former Member: Prince Devitt/Finn Balor, AJ Styles, Kenny Omega, Jay White, The Young Bucks, Adam Cole, Hangman Page, Cody Rhodes, Tama Tonga, El Phantasmo\n\nIt may not have had the nonpareil supernova effect of the nWo, or the landmark legacy of the Four Horsemen, but considering its longevity and impact on the landscape of wrestling, the BULLET CLUB might be the most significant faction in wrestling history. Originally a vehicle for the elevation of Prince Devitt in 2013, the BULLET CLUB could have quietly disbanded and diffused when Devitt bailed for WWE in 2014. Instead, New Japan established a pattern: out with the old, in with the new. Unapologetically and remorselessly.\n\nDevitt was ejected by Karl Anderson and Doc Gallows, replaced by the incoming AJ Styles. Styles’ reign as BC leader resurrected his career, spectacularly. He went from a respected veteran to a slam-dunk hall-of-famer within two years. When the allure of Stamford tempted Styles in early 2016, he was evicted by Kenny Omega. Tomes and monographs will–and have–been written about the magnitude of this event. Within three years, Omega had established himself as a global star, of such extensive critical and commercial success, that a second national wrestling company–AEW, of course–was able to emerge largely from Omega’s stature.\n\nOmega’s departure was… understated, to be polite, and Jay White’s sovereignty indicated a shift in BULLET CLUB orthodoxy. Previously, the leaders had been established wrestlers with substantial workrate credentials. White was less than two years removed from his return from Young Lion status, and in the process of developing a homeric, grandiose main event wrestling style. White navigated the CLUB through the highs and lows: the high being a main event at a sold-out Madison Square Garden, the low being his largely absent period during the pandemic.\n\nAs the group entered its second decade, a return to BULLET CLUB standards came with David Finlay’s usurpation of the unit’s throne in 2023. After White lost a loser-leaves-town match in America, Finlay shocked the world by attacking and berating White. Finlay then reappeared in Japan, with Gedo as a manager and the leadership of BULLET CLUB secured. Finlay’s acknowledged goal is to return BULLET CLUB to its origins: small, brazen, and single-mindedly set on taking over New Japan.\n\nDavid Finlay\n\nNJPW Debut: May 22, 2015\n\nJoined BULLET CLUB: March 6, 2023\n\nChampionships and Accomplishments:\n\nI NEVER Openweight Championship\n\n1 IWGP World Heavyweight Tag Team Championship (with Juice Robinson)\n\n1 NEVER Openweight 6-Man Tag Team Championship (with Ricochet and Satoshi Kojima)\n\n1 World Tag League (2019, with Juice Robinson)\n\nA fourth-generation wrestler, most assumed that Finlay would have waltzed into WWE. His father, Fit Finlay, had emerged as one of the company’s most influential trainers and agents. Yet, David Finlay III chose to enter New Japan in 2015, undertaking the Young Lion lifestyle. Finlay would graduate from that status in 2016, and endure a long period of mid-card stasis.\n\nBut clues began to emerge that the company had big ideas for Finlay. He made a surprise semi-finals run in New Japan Cup 2021, defeating long-time nemesis and tormentor Jay White along the way. That was clue #1. Finlay then disappeared until G1 Climax 32 in 2022, his first G1 after years of lobbying. He went 3-3, but his three wins were eye-opening: Juice Robinson, Shingo T"
