        "text": "Stardom Rebirth 2018 Days 1&2 Review\n\nDay 1: Yokohama Radiant Hall 4.14\n\nShow opens with a rapid fire performance of all new Stardom original songs, live.\n\nMatch 1: Leo Vs. Nao Vs. Hanan\n\nShort rookie affair, with Hanan getting the pin. Not much to say here, Nao and Leo both still seem pretty green, but didn’t make any huge mistakes. Soft looking strikes is probably their biggest problem. Hanan was in charge here, and she looked solid leading the match to the finish. (2 out of 5)\n\nMatch 2: Candyfloss Vs. Shiki\n\nCandyfloss has a good match and reaction in her debut. Her comedy spots of hugging Shiki and dropping next to them on the mat like it’s a sleepover got nice pops. She then surprised the crowd with a very good armbar attempt, and that mostly became the story of the match as Candyfloss would counter and make attempts to submit Shiki with various holds. Shiki got in her usual offence, although she is another rookie who could add a little more power to her strikes. Candyfloss finally submits Shiki with an armlock, after twisting a few fingers as well. (3 out of 5)\n\nMatch 3: Kyona, Natsuko and Natsumi Vs. Kaori, Ruaka, and Konami\n\nThis was a fun one, and everyone involved got a chance to show off what they could do. Natsumi further showed her development, utilizing various lucha transitions and holds, including the Paradise Lock. She continues to show great potential, although there is still a good amount of hesitation, which lead to some slight botches. Action was frantic, and ended with Kyona getting the pin off a splash. Nice little side story in the match dealing with the obvious fact that their were Team Jungle members on opposite sides of the ring. Lot’s of Kyona, Natsuko and Kaori shouting “Jungle! Jungle!” at and with each other. Part of me wonders if this would have been a different match had Tam not been injured. (3.5 out of 5)\n\nMatch 4: Bea, Chardonnay and Martina Vs. Kagetsu, Hana and Sumire\n\nMy personal favorite match of the night, as “Session Moth” Martina makes her debut in Stardom. Crowd was immediately into her comedy gimmick, and got into ridiculous entrance. Oedo Tai’s responses were excellent as well, a mix of confusion and disgust that would pay off the next day during the draft. The match was a fast paced brawl. Early on Oedo Tai took the fight to the outside, but the World Selection team brought it back to the ring and started to take charge. Martina and Kagetsu got into a spitting mist contest for a good laugh, and Martina ends up hitting a crowd popping bronco buster. Bea finishes it with a double foot stomp to Sumire’s head and the pin. Afterwards, Martina continues to party while Bea and Chardonnay gesture they want a shot at the tag belts. (4 out of 5)\n\nMatch 5: Mayu, Saki, and Starlight vs. HZK, Momo and AZM\n\nAnother great match, this one really kicked into high gear from the start, and didn’t really stop until then end. Everyone looked good here, and they all hit their big spots. Lot’s of flying around, and Starlight gets the win with a float over splash. I gave this match the same as the previous one, and for those that like action and highspots, it will probably be their favorite. The match lacked real stakes tough. At the end it did further the AZM and Starlight feud. (4 out of 5)\n\nMatch 6: Io Vs. Mari (Wonder of Stardom title match)\n\nIo broke out her lucha skills against the veteran luchadora, and the match certainly had its moments. A solid effort overall, but not the best either had done. The major issue I had with it was that Io probably needed to slow down and let the match build more naturally, like in the Mari Vs. Kay Lee Highspeed title match from January. While Mari carries the Highspeed title, she clearly was a step behind the champ, and it lead to a weird rush feel to the match, which ended at about 12 minutes with a reversal from Mari’s torture rack into a roll up by Io. Some good moments, but the chemistry felt off. (3.5 out of 5)\n\nAfter the match Mayu, Io and Kagetsu come out to talk up the big 3 Way Draft match at Shin-Kiba the next day to close the show.\n\nFinal Thoughts:\n\nA good “Go home show” before the big match and “rebirth” that has been built up recently. Candyfloss and Martina had solid debuts and got over with the crowd. Title feuds for the Future and Goddess of Stardom belts were teased and the matches were fun.overall.\n\nDay 2: Shin-Kiba 1st Ring 4.15\n\nSame opening as last show, a quick performance of songs, then on to the show. Guessing this will now be standard with Fuka and K-Gang babies not being around anymore. Or at least until they feel they don’t need to promote the new album anymore, lol.\n\nMatch 1: Leo Vs. Hanan\n\nThis one went a little longer than the previous opener match, and gave the young Leo a little more time to shine. The crowd certainly likes the rookie, and there was solid support for her throughout. An interesting moment in the match is when the referee started to also yell at Leo to fire up more and hit harder (I’m assuming they are related somehow, as it seemed like a older family member talking to a younger one). Some minor fumbling in the match, but Hanan is able to execute a Juji Gatame armlock for the win. One of the better showings for the rookies, thanks to more time and focus on just a simple 1 v 1 match. There was a slight flub by the time keeper though, which led to a slightly awkward finish (2.5 out of 5)\n\nMatch 2: Kaori, Ruaka and Nao Vs. Natsumi, Mari and Shiki\n\nAn entertaining match, if mostly anchored by Kaori’s typical comedy heel skit and the parent/child wrestling team of Mari and Natsumi. Some fun spots, including a triple submission by Mari, Natusmi, and Shiki for a nice triple submission photo-op. Shiki get’s the win on Nao after a missile dropkick. The veteran’s carry this match, but Natsumi shows she’s not too far behind, if still a bit too hesitant. (3 out of 5)\n\nMatch 3: Hana and Sumire Vs. Martina and Candyfloss\n\nAnother entertaining match, mostly for the antics, but there was solid wrestling underpinning the whole thing. Martina again got the crowd pumped with her entrance, and Candyfloss did her cutesy “let’s be friends” gimmick as well early on. Some good back and forth including some brawling, a double bronco buster from Martina to Hana and Sumire, and more good counters into armbars and armlocks by Candyfloss. Ultimately though, Hana shows she can take an arm also, and submits Candyfloss with her savage looking armbar. From a storytelling / wrestling quality perspective, it was match of the night for me. (4 out of 5)\n\nMatch 4: Natsuko and Konami Vs. Bea and Chardonnay This one was a bit of a mess unfortunately. While Bea and Konami did well and had some great striking, Chardonnay and Natsuko seemed more than a little rough out there. Both are capable of better matches, and have had better in the past, but for whatever reason, they could not get on the same page in this match. Chardonnay hits a Butterfly Suplex for the pin. (2.5 out of 5)\n\nMatch 5: Saki, Jungle and Starlight Vs. HZK, AZM and Momo\n\nA solid 3 v 3 match, that mostly seemed to exist as a way for AZM to get her pin back on Starlight from the previous show. Some good spots, and Saki continues to impress in her comeback. Some good double teams, including QQ doing a triple drop kick on Starlight, followed by an assisted lionsault from AZM to get the pin. I feel it could have used another 3-5 minutes, but it was a good warm up for the main event. (3.5 out of 5)\n\nMatch 6: Io (Queen’s Quest) Vs. Mayu (Stadom Army) Vs. Kagetsu (Oedo Tai)\n\nThis was a reverse 3 way elimination match. Essentially, the first person to get a win would get the first draft pick for their team, and the leave the match. The remaining 2 have to fight it out for second and third pick. Pins, submissions and sending opponents over the top count as wins.\n\nThe match starts with a 3 way test of strength, but quickly speeds to a frantic pace as all three try and do whatever they can to win, including lots of outside Oedo Tai interference. In an act of desperation / nostalgia, Io even gets Mayu to team up for their old Thunder Rock top rope double dropkick. A lot of attempts at over the top eliminations, culminating in the first win coming about 9 minutes into the match. Kagetsu has Io hanging from the ropes after almost throwing her over, and uses a mist spray to finish the job. This leaves Io and Mayu to fight, which surprisingly only goes for a few more minutes. Io throws Mayu over the top, and the match is over. Yet another match that could probably have used about 5 more minutes, but the show was getting late and there was the draft to do. (3.5 out of 5)\n\nThe Draft\n\nIn a lot of ways, this was the main event, as it was promoted very much as a freshening of Stardom’s roster. Initially, things seem to go smoothly as all three factions choose previous members for their first 2 picks. Kagetsu chooses Hana and Sumire, keeping the core of Oedo Tai intact. Io chooses AZM and Momo. Mayu drafts Starlight and Saki. The third round is where things get interesting as Kagetsu chooses HZK. A visibly angry HZK yells at her former leader for not picking her earlier, and Hana and Sumire don’t seem too happy to have a former mortal enemy as a teammate. Somewhat shaken by this, Io then surprises by choosing Bea and Chardonnay as her next two picks. Io explains later that with her sixth pick of Viper, Bea and Chardonnay will now complete the formation of the European contingent of Queen’s Quest. Io also chooses Konami, who is surprised and a bit anxious about joining QQ. Oedo Tai gets rounded out with Nao (to the anger of Hana) and Martina (to the anger of Sumire). Kagetsu then ends her drafting, as she feels 6 is more than enough, especially for Oedo Tai’s famous intro dance (7 or more would just be too complex). Io agrees, and says anyone left can join the Stardom Army. At this point Mayu has added Shiki, Natsumi and a very grateful Tam. Jungle Kyona, angry at both not being picked and also having team Jungle ignored in the draft, rejects the idea of just joining Stardom Army for no good reason. She storms off with Kaori and Natsuko, despite Mayu trying to get her to stay.\n\nBefore things wrap up, Bea and Chardonnay challenge for the tag belts, while Martina challenges Io for her White belt. Both challenges are accepted for the Osaka shows next week. The show closes with all three teams flashing their hand signs.\n\nPost show notes:\n\nDue to the trios team breaking up, the Artist of Stardom belts are vacated.\n\nVia the official Stardom account, the Stardom Army has now been renamed simply “Stars”. A group photo shows the 6 members previously shown, along with rookies Ruaka, Leo and Hanan and a very sullen Team Jungle.\n\nOedo Tai’s update photo from backstage shows a smiling Kagetsu, but an otherwise unhappy, scared or furious team. She may have one the battle, but Kagetsu might have lost the long term war with a fractured team.\n\nQueen’s Quest is the only one to show a smiling united front, all six members sitting together confidently (although Konami still seems uncertain).\n\nAn interesting note, Candyfloss does not seem to have been taken in by any of the teams (poor kid, halfway around the world on her first tour, and now she’s alone). Additionally, Toni Storm was not mentioned as being drafted either, which means Stardom’s World champion is a free agent of sorts.\n\nFinal Thoughts\n\nPersonally I’m happy with the changes overall, not so drastic as to make the landscape of Stardom unrecognizable, but enough change to make some fresh feuds and stories. In no particular order, here are some of my personal takes:\n\nThe European QQ faction could be very cool…if they get booked regularly together, and treated like a big deal. I heard a few fans reference LIJ when Io announced QQ Europe, lets hope it goes half that well.\n\nKonami joining a dedicated faction is interesting, as she’s been floating mostly since coming into Stardom (chibi’s group notwithstanding). Hopefully this gives her more direction, and maybe some gold.\n\nKagetsu’s continued ability to be the most charismatic leader in Stardom, while at the same time lacking any real managerial capability, continues to be one of my favorite story lines. While her drive and vicious determination often win Oedo Tai battles, her impulsive and poor thought out choices continue to hobble the team in confusing and amusing ways. I am very interested to see how the new additions get on, especially the ever growing talent of HZK. She had a great 2017, and 2018 could be even bigger for her. Will OT slow her down or speed her up?\n\nJungle Kyona has been a Stardom star that has been on the cusp of being a top player, and her breaking off to form a full fourth faction might be the thing to do it. Mayu’s first battle as leader of Stars might be from Jungle’s rising anger and rebellion.\n\nWAVE PRO: Saturday Night Fever. 5.26.18\n\nThe show opens with Gami, Yumi Ohka and Misaki Ohata, all in black suits, coming out to address the events of the DDT Street Wrestling show that took place at the Toshimaen Amusement Park. Misaki had taken part in the event, as the theme of the show was teams of three made up of two male wrestlers and one female. During the ensuing DDT chaos, Makoto Oishi ended up proposing to Misaki, who initially refused, but then decided to accept after Makoto jumped in front of a car for her. Makoto gave her a large metal nut as a ring, and then the new happy couple rode off in the very car that had hit Makoto earlier (it was all very DDT).\n\nWith the engagement now public, the senior staff at Zabun (Wave`s parent company) felt the need to address the situation. I realized that the black suits and very dry formal nature of the opening was probably a parody of the very real serious situation involving Ayako Hamada. Looking at social media, Yumi and Gami had came out in the same suits to address that situation about a week earlier. That said, the seriousness in this situation quickly devolved into comedy, as an overly happy Misaki began to get on Yumi`s nerves. I believe the last straw was Misaki wishing the single, almost 40, Yumi happiness in her future. Yumi then attacked Misaki, although Gami quickly grabbed her ending it. The theme of happily married/engaged women Vs. single women would continue into the first match.\n\nMatch 1: Kaori Yoneyama & Cherry Vs. Sakura Hirota & Moeka Haruhi\n\nAs you can guess from the players involved, this was a great comedy match. Sakura immediately starts things on the wrong foot by bragging about her happily married live with children and how she can still be an amazing pro wrestler. All three of the other participants jump her and begin to beat her down, including the ref. Yumi at ringside attempts to join in, but is halted by other wrestlers. The ref proceeds to slow count every one of HIrota’s pin attempts, and fast count her opponents. This was a fun and hilarious match, and maybe almost my favorite of the night. HIrota’s excellent comedy timing and her still very sharp ring work, make for an excellent match, especially working with the newly formed tag team of Kaori and Cherry, called BBA. I don’t think I have ever seen Moeka perform before, but she kept up her side. Overall, a great opener. ( 4 / 5 )\n\nMatch 2: Keisuke Goto Vs. Daiki Shimomura\n\nThis was an aggressive match between two young competitors, it would not have looked out of place on a Lion’s Gate Project show. Keisuke plays the fiery young boy well against the DDT/DNA visitor, Daiki. Match moves pretty fast, and all the action was crisp and on point. Keisuke is looking like he’s almost ready to trade in his young boy gear for real stuff, but maybe he can get a few more rounds in DDT next time. ( 3.25 / 5 )\n\nMatch 3: Miyuki Takase Vs. Fairy Nihonbashi\n\nAnother comedy heavy match, mostly based off of Fairy’s supposed magical powers. This one might test the limits of some fans, as it involves some really out absurd spots, such as a lightsaber attack (Don’t tell Disney), use of a freezing spell, and use of a magic wand. The wrestling itself is solid, and Miyuki drops a vicious second rope guillotine leg drop. Kind of a filler match, but nothing really wrong with it. (3 / 5)\n\nMatch 4: Yuki Miyazaki & Nagisa Nozaki Vs. Makoto & Himeka Arita\n\nProbably the best match for just straight wrestling, as Yuki and Nagisa show why they are the wave tag champs. Yuki does get some of her comedy spots in, like her humiliating crotch stretch, and generally trying to smooch the other wrestlers against their will. Really great tag work overall between the champs. Himeka mostly played the powerhouse in this match, and pulled it off well enough, going toe to toe with equally strong Yuki. Makoto was a real star here though, and it was nice to see her back at 100%. She’d been out for so long with injury, and coupled with the “suspension” of her promotion REINA, I have been worried about how that might affect her performance. That said, she’s been tearing it up lately as a freelancer, and if a company were looking to replace a member, they could do worse than someone who was trained by Emi Sakura and Tajiri. Makoto broke out some vicious kicks, nice reversals and her patented cartwheel double knees. A hell of a match, and highly recommended if you like good joshi or tag wrestling. ( 4.25 / 5 )\n\nMatch 5: Yumi Ohka, Misaki Ohata & Ryo Mizunami Vs. Asuka, Hiroe Nagahama & Rina Yamashita.\n\nThe match was advertised as a “Showa” versus “Heisei” era match, or essentially veterans vs. rookies. Things get off to shaky star for the veteran team, when Yumi attacks Misaki again early on, targeting her ring finger. This would be a theme during the match, as Yumi would constantly attack her supposed teammate, even getting the other wrestlers to team up on Misaki. Misaki takes the beating well, and shows why she is the reigning Wave champ. Asuka stepped it up with her usual array big of boots and ariel offense, but really made a case for her as challanger to Misaki’s belt. Everyone else in the match made sure to keep things running at a great pace, even if things got a bit chaotic (which tends to happen in these 6 person tags). A really exciting long battle here, even if the core of it is how pissed Yumi is at the newly engaged and happy Misaki. (4 / 5)\n\nFinal Thoughts:\n\nA great show, and I was really impressed by the whole roster. While I have seen most of them working in other promotions, this was my first time to see a Wave show proper. I was surprised by how much comedy was mixed in, but I guess I should have known after seeing Sakura Hirota’s name on the card. A side note, I caught Hirota leaving around the break with her twins in tow. It’s amazing how night and day her ring persona and regular persona are. Her over the top heel comedy character seems so larger than life, and then she’s changes to this super friendly and unassuming mom. Some people just have it all!\n\nDespite a lot of ill warnings about Wave’s online offerings, I plan to sign up and dive into the back catalog. I’ve heard they upload slow, so this match might not pop up for awhile, but I do recommend checking it out. It feels like they were trying to entertain as much as possible, maybe to help relieve the dark cloud bad press they got from the Ayako Hamada situation.\n\nStardom Cinderella Tournament 2018.\n\nThe Bracket: https://twitter.com/we_are_stardom/status/990743693844926465\n\nThis one hit the ground running, not much wasted time as there was a lot of matches to get to. Quick introduction video, probably by Samurai TV or Tokyo Sports, and then the wrestler’s came out (except for Kagetsu) and did a line up dressed in Cinderella tournament shirts. Mayu did a greeting speech, and then we were off to the races.\n\nQuick review of the tournament rules, you can win by pinfall, submission, count out, sending your opponent over the top, or a time limit draw.\n\nOpening Match Mary Apache, Starlight Kid, Natsumi, Nao & Hanan Vs. Natsuko, Leo, Ruaka, Shiki and AZM.\n\nWhat you expect from a Stardom opener at this point, quick fun match. Leo and Natsumi both showed growth, with Leo showing a lot more fire and Natsumi looking a little more confident. Some comedy as Nao mostly seemed to cause chaos outside for what looked like both teams. Starlight gets the pin with a top rope float over splash.\n\n2.5 / 5\n\nMatch 1: Konami Vs. Momo\n\nThis one was a flurry of kicks from the get go. I think this might have been Konami’s strongest Stardom showing yet, some real aggression got shown off here. Konami gets the upper hand a bit when she transitions to a ground game, but Momo puts her away with her running double knees (Blue Demon Sword). A great, if short, first match for the tourney, and Momo moves on!\n\n3 / 5\n\nMatch 2: Saki Vs. Candyfloss\n\nAnother short but exciting match. Candyfloss attacks early and seems to get the upper hand with some superior match and catch wrestling techniques. Saki fights back with a flurry of fast moves including some nice suplexes. Saki takes it home with an impaler (My Emblem).\n\n3 / 5\n\nMatch 3: Bea vs. Martina\n\nMoth does her usual entrance to a solid crowd reaction. This is a match that seemed to benefit from both wrestlers being familiar with each other, and the back and forth was excellent. Moth pulled of some nice comedy spots, including a submission move with the ropes while she “refreshed” herself with an alcoholic beverage at the same time. Bea ultimately takes control and hits her double curbstomp for the win. If this had been give more time, could have been great I feel, but these openers went fast.\n\n3.5 / 5\n\nMatch 4: Brandi Vs. Natsu\n\nBrandi Rhodes has a fine debut, although a lot of the entertainment of the match comes from Oedo Tai interfering, surprisingly to Brandi’s favor. Those following online know that Hana and Kagetsu recruited a confused Brandi while in Vegas for the Women of Honor Tournament. Apparently making their newest member happy took priority over their current member, Natsu, winning. Natsu does well leading the match and playing the heel, but Brandi gets the roll up, and win. Oedo Tai all go back through the curtain happy, except for a confused Natsu.\n\n2.5 / 5\n\nMatch 5: Hazuki vs. Hana\n\nThe animosity between these two Oedo Tai members leads to the most intense match of the tournament up to this point. Anyone who remembers the QQ vs. OT elimination match earlier this year will see shades of that fight here also. Lot’s off hard hits and both wrestler’s end up on the apron after going over the top rope. I had a moment of fear thinking they were going for the powerbomb to the outside that looked like it almost seriously injured Hana last time, but they ended up trading a few more blows, leading to Hana falling, and Hazuki winning. Another match that could have used more time, but the story after is what made it.\n\nKagetsu and the rest of OT come out and congratulate Hazuki, who seems to shed her last bits of trepidation about joining OT, and offers a signature lollipop to Hana as a peace offering. She accepts and then returns the favor by draping her kimono over Hazuki’s shoulders. The rest of OT accept lollipops, and the group walks off looking like a real team.\n\n3.5 / 5\n\nMatch 6: Mayu Vs. Tam\n\nLike the opening Konami/Momo, Tam comes out of the gate on fire against Mayu. Lot’s of nice kicks on Tam’s part, and she shows no signs on holding back against her fellow Stars member. Mayu fights back with her usual mix of high flying and reversals, ultimately leading to her signature dragon suplex pin. Another quick match that made both challenger and winner look strong.\n\n3 / 5\n\nMatch 7: Io Vs. Chardonnay\n\nThis match suffers a little from speed differential again, but the two get into sync near the end of the match. Chardonnay’s height advantage should have been played up a little more, as it is Io seemed mostly in control during the match, draining some off the drama. Io locks in a Texas Clover Leaf for the win.\n\n2.5 / 5\n\nMatch 8: Kagetsu Vs. Kyona\n\nA focused Kyona makes her way to the ring, only to be presented with a less than serious Kagetsu. Now in her cutesy Kage-Ko persona, the OT leader comes out to some kind of saccharine theme music, wearing a strawberry print dress and long blond wig. She parades around the ring, seemingly to taunt Kyona. Early in the match she plays the cutesy angle to the hilt, calling for rope breaks and screaming at Kyona for being too mean. Kyona responds with aggression, and looks great taking charge of the Canadian backbreaker rack. This ultimately causes Kagetsu to break out of Kage-Ko character, shedding her dress and going on offense. Some good back and forth and the two end up on the apron. Some dangerous teases, which leads to an impressive, but safe, powerbomb by Kyona onto the other Oeda Tai members. Kyona wins by sending Kagetsu over the top.\n\n3.75 / 5\n\nMatch 9: Hazuki Vs. Bea\n\nBig story here will probably be Hazuki debuting her new OT mask and doing the famed Oedo Tai Dance. She seems to have taken Kris Wolf’s place in the routine, joining Kagetsu in the break dance portion of the routine. For a first performance? 4 / 5\n\nOn to the match, it’s fire again from both of them out of the gate. Good kick and strike exchange, and both break out pretty much their whole arsenals in rapid succession. Cheeky Nando’s kick in the corner by Bea to try and setup her double stop from the top, but it’s countered and Hazuki lands a big splash, but Bea kicks out. Bea ultimately fights back and hits her double curbstomp for the win. Some minor interference/fighting on the outside by OT and QQ, but the match was pretty much a showcase for Bea and Hazuki. A surprisingly happy OT walks off to the curtain, and flashes their sign, having won a prize greater than a pinfall: Unity.\n\n3.75 / 5\n\nMatch 10: Mayu Vs. Saki\n\nWatching these two wrestle, it’s erie some of the similarities they have. Beside the obvious build comparisons, the way they sell and execute certain moves is almost mirror like. These similarities do lead to an entertaining back and forth match, if again, a short one. Saki works Mayu’s arm a bit, but Mayu fights back to win it with another Dragon Suplex pin.\n\n3.75 / 5\n\nMatch 11: Io Vs. Brandi\n\nThis match seems to work better, because Io leads it and Brandi just has to follow. Brandi gets some good offense in, including a decent Crossroads, which leads to a two count. Ultimately Io takes it with a double underhook facebuster to setup a beautiful moonsault and the pin.\n\n3 / 5\n\nMatch 12: Momo Vs. Kyona\n\nI really liked the intensity in this match. Kyona plays a power game, trying to batter Momo down. Momo counters with more kicks and a running double knees, but Kyona kicks out. Over the top to the apron again (at this point, they could have at least changed which side the did it on, although I understand they were trying to make sure they were facing the cameras). More teasing of dangerous moves on the apron, until Momo hits a cradle back to belly piledriver on Kyona, and then kicks her lifeless body to the ground for an over the top win.\n\n3.5 / 5\n\nMatch 13: Io vs. Mayu\n\nIo and Mayu are arguably the top two talents in Stardom, and so it should be no surprise that they had a great match here. These two have wrestled each other so many times they could probably do it blindfolded, and it would still have been great. Lots of fast counters and flips into other moves and other counters. I sometimes criticize Io for going too fast with some of her opponents, but when you have someone like Mayu who can go toe to toe at that speed, the results are hard to argue with. Io does a perfect springboard moonsault to the outside (after smartly slipping through the middle rope). As the announcer starts counting down the finish, Mayu goes for a final Dragon Suplex for the pin, but time runs out (actually ran out just as Mayu was setting up, leading to the suplex looking more spiteful than useful, but that’s Mayu for you, lol). A time limit draw means both Io and Mayu are eliminated, making the next match the final!\n\n4.5 / 5\n\nMatch 14 (Final): Momo vs. Bea\n\nHaving to follow an Io Vs. Mayu match is a tough hand to be dealt, but these two warriors stepped up to the challenge. Another heavy striking match early on with kicks, stomps, and chops as both try and finish this one as quick as they can. Bea hits a Cheeky Nandos kick in the corner, but later takes a pair of double knees from Momo on the apron. More back and forth in the ring, until Momo hits a Tequila Sunrise (half nelson bridging suplex) for the win! A frantic match, only slightly overshadowed by the longer and equally frantic match before it. Hopefully these two can get a future match to build on what they showed here!\n\n4.25 / 5\n\nAfter the match Momo gets streamers, Rossy hands her the victory dress, and there is a slight intermission so she can change for her coronation. Momo returns to accept her tiara and trophy, and thanks the crowd. She then announces her challenge to Io for her white belt. Io is prepared to accept, when Kagetsu comes out to remind them both she has a shot at the upcoming Oedo Tai produced show. Momo acknowledges this, and says she will challenge whoever has the belt at the time of her match. Io and Kagetsu leave, and Momo poses for some pictures.\n\nFinal Thoughts:\n\nI initially considered removing the individual match reviews since I felt that with all of them being very short it might be better to simply give each wrestler an overall score for their tournament performance. Then I figured some people might like to use those scores to prioritize viewing if they have limited time, although I highly recommend watching the whole tournament in order ideally. So as a compromise, I’ve decided to rate the the Top 5 performances in the tournament:\n\nMomo Watanabe: Cinderella gets to be the star of her ball, and so does Momo. She had 3 great matches where she looked strong in everyone of them. If this was meant to be her elevation to the top of the card, she gave a convincing performance at this tournament.\n\nBea Priestley: She came up a little short, but she showed she has skill and drive to fight at the top. Bea used her full arsenal on her opponents to great and entertaining effect, and made you believe she could have gone all the way.\n\nMayu Iwatani: The Sky Blue Hyper Technician did not let the crowd down, with three solid matches against two very good opponents. She might not have been able to get her third Cinderella win, but she had the best match of the night with Io.\n\nJungle Kyona: The only one on this list to only have 2 matches, but I argue they were two of the best all tournament. Kyona has been on the cusp of breaking into the top tier of Stardom for awhile now, and her performance here is proof the time is now. She looked serious and carried a solid intensity in both of her matches. The old, comical Kyona, would have fallen into Kagetsu’s antics and lost her match, but the new more focused and aggressive Kyona won the day. Something tells me the Team Jungle leader is not ready to be second banana to anyone, and I’m really hoping the momentum continues.\n\nIo Shirai: The Ace had a fantastic match with Mayu, but her other two were mostly okay. She was carrying much less experienced talent, but deserves credit for leading them through it. Her upcoming match with Kagetsu (and then possibly Momo) are probably going to be where she really kicks things up a notch.\n\nHonorable Mentions:\n\nKonami: This was the most consistently aggressive she has been (at least in Stardom). The Fighting Princess proved her name, and I’m hoping this continues throughout the year, maybe leading to some gold around her waist.\n\nSaki Kashima: Despite being away from Stardom for 5 years, Saki has fallen into the roaster like she never left. She feels like another potential star that can stand with Mayu and Io in both skill and presentation.\n\nOedo Tai: They may have been all eliminated before the semis, but they arguably won the biggest victory: A Unified Front. They were also very entertaining, from Moth’s hilarious first match and Kagetsu’s Kage-Ko antics, to their boosting of Brandi over Natsu and Nao’s general goofy chicanery at ringside. Their story of finding unity culminated in their first 6 person team dance that had the crowd pumped. Oedo Tai reminded everyone that to them, fun and chaos are the real prizes sometimes.\n\nOverall another fun and entertaining Cinderella Tournament in the books, and I hope that a lot of what was shown here is setting up what we will see soon over the summer, and into the rest of the year. Stardom needs to move people up and this feels like the show were the really started to do it in earnest.\n\nOZ Academy 5.20.18 Shinjuku Face Review\n\nBeen awhile since I’ve gone to an OZ show, but it the card did not disappoint. A good mix of fast action, brawling and comedy. Nothing that’s going to earn match of the year, as this was clearly about setting up future matches. Shinjuku face remains a favorite pro-wrestling venue of mine, with the intimacy of Shin-Kiba 1st Ring, but a better layout in my opinion.\n\nMatch 1: Akino & Kakeru Sekiguchi Vs. Sonoko Kato & Kaho Kobayashi\n\nA reunion match for Mission K Four (MK4) as Kaho returns to OZ for the first time since her excursion to Mexico. She continued to show off her newly honed lucha skills, as well as her classics like the 120% school boy, excellent drop kicks and top rope corkscrew splash. Her and Kakeru did a lot of the high speed work, while the veterans made a nice contrast with their more strike based submission style. A good back and forth opener, and the group celebrated after, showing they plan to move back into a more prominent position in OZ. (3.5 / 5)\n\nMatch 2: Yako Fujigasaki Vs. Rina Yamashita\n\nGood singles match that mixed all types of wrestling (comedy, striking, submissions, etc) into a fun match fast paced bout. Yako and Rina got in each others faces early, although mostly to critique each other’s waistlines, which got the crowd laughing. Strike exchange lead to some submission attempts, although mostly to stretch each other’s faces for comedy again. There were also some hard hits here, as Yako nailed a hip attack on Rina that looked like a ticket to concussion city. Rina also broke out some savage lariats, and her Rainmaker is looking pretty solid. No real ongoing story in here as far as I could tell, just a match to fill the card, but it was very solid. (3.75 / 5)\n\nMatch 3: Mayumi Ozaki & Yumi Ohka (With Police) Vs. Kaori Yoneyama & Aja Kong\n\nGreat brawl and story here by a lot of vets. OZ crew gets the jump on Kaori and Aja in classic heel fashion, as they ambush them at the entrance way. Aja is taken out early by OZ enforcer Police, as he buries her under steel chairs. This leaves Kaori to take a hell of a beating for the majority of the match, until Aja gets back into it. The ref was also clearly in Mayumi’s pocket, as she let the heels do pretty much whatever they want, and alternating between slow counts for the faces and fast counts for the heels. This was a fun brawl, and everyone knew their part and stayed true to their characters and the match story. For example, when Aja finally came in and put Yumi in a submission, Mayumi kicks the ref instead of Aja, playing up the fear and danger Aja represents, as well as playing into the story of the ref being on OZ’s side. Kong at her age and with her injuries still knows how to tell a story and play an imposing character, and the fact that others play to it makes the whole act work. 37 year old Kaori, the youngest wrestler in the match, is left to play the baby in peril, milking the crowd for sympathy. It’s an old school brawl tag match with clear heels and faces, but it’s done very well. I feel this is the type of match OZ fans come for. (4 / 5)\n\nMatch 4: Aoi Kizuki Vs. Takako Inoue\n\nAoi continues her farewell tour against veteran Takako Inoue. At 48 years old, Takako still looks great and did a fine job in what was purely a comedy match. The two bantered back and forth and did a bit of gimmick swapping, with Aoi waving around Takako’s taser while Takako wore her wings. The wrestling was mostly okay, with both mostly focusing on getting laughs to keep crowd engaged. Aoi does pull of a beautiful northern lights suplex, and Takako does an impressive top rope diving knee for her age. After the match, MK4 comes out and wishes Aoi the best on her upcoming retirement, and to keep giving it her all till the end. Aoi promises to do so, and then they group all take a photo together, with Kizuki I guess technically making the group MK5 for a night. (3 / 5)\n\nMatch 5: Yoshiko & Hiroyo Matsumoto Vs. Hikaru Shida & Tsubasa Kuragaki\n\nHikaru returns to OZ after coming off her injury, and she didn’t seem to holding back at all. It’s a hard hitting match as expected with the participants involved. Tsubasa and Hiroyo play the heavies to the younger and faster Hikaru and Yoshiko, similar to the dynamic in the opening MK4 match. Some good tag team moves from Hiroyo and Yoshiko, including a savage looking second rope Doomsday Device on Hikaru. This match was clearly to setup a challenge between Hikaru and Yoshiko at the next show, and Hikaru cut a fiery promo at the end to accept that challenge. Overall a good match, although I feel it lacked some of the heat of the previous tag match. (3.5 / 5)\n\nFinal Thoughts:\n\nThis felt like a solid “TV” episode to setup a bigger “PPV” style show, namely their upcoming 6.3 show at Korakuen. If you enjoy OZ, then you should definitely check this out, but someone new might want to dig in the back catalog a bit (I recommend the October 29th 2017 Yokohama show, as it is the beginning of the current champs reign). MVP of the night was Takako Inoue, who took home a 100,000 Yen bonus. I would probably have given that to Kaori, but considering it’s probably for show, whatever. Yako and Rina’s match impressed me more than I expected, especially Yako, who has really come into her own over the last year or so. I remember seeing her a couple years ago against Konami and thinking she was solid, but definitely still needed to be carried. She more than kept up in this match, and I feel she seems more confident in her moves and character. Rina Yamashita continues to perform beyond her years, and I really think she’s ready for another top title run. Her against Yoshiko for the OZ belt would be a great match in my opinion, and Rina would carry that belt well if she won (certainly with less controversy).\n\nStardom 7th Anniversary 1.21 Korakuen Show Review\n\nProbably one of the most memorable Stardom shows I’ve gone to in awhile, so I decided to do a review. Ratings out of 5.\n\nOpening: Fuka Announcement and Musical Numbers\n\nK-Gang Babys opens the show with Fuka as per usual. After the surprise announcement of Fuka’s pregnancy and impending retirement, we get three musical performances from the new Stardom album. The one of note is Tam’s solo performance, in which she really gives it her all, although maybe she got too excited because it sounded like she might have been running out of breath at the end. Purple glowsticks were handed out before the show specifically for her performance. This felt like fore shadowing of things to come.\n\nMatch 1: Hanan, Shiki, and Starlight Vs. Hirmoi, Konami and Ruaka\n\nNot much to this one, decent opening and not much else. Everyone gets a few moves in, and then Starlight get’s the pin on Ruaka with a nice float over splash from the turnbuckle. (2 out of 5)\n\nMatch 2: Kyona, Natsuko and Kaori Vs. Nicole, Xia and Miranda\n\nA little more energy to this one, as well as some nice storytelling. Nicole brought a lot of suplexes, as she tends to do, and Xia’s kindness continued to be her undoing. Team Jungles superior teamwork wins out, with captain Kyona getting the win via her finishing power bomb on Miranda. (2.5 out of 5)\n\nSide note, it was nice to see Hiroyo show up for support, despite not wrestling.\n\nMatch 3: Mari Vs. Kay Lee (HIgh Speed Title Match)\n\nMy second favorite match of the night, Mari and Kay Lee tell a great story here in the ring. While maybe not living up to the high speed name, the smoothness of the their technique and timing often makes you forget. A lot of excellent grappling and mat work, building to some big spots near the end. Mari wins with a Michinoku driver, after a great back and forth match. (4.5 out of 5)\n\nMatch 4: Mayu Vs. Rachael\n\nMayu brought out the whole arsenal for her comeback match, and that might be why I rated it a little lower than the previous one. The match was entirely built around Rachael being a bully so Mayu could get the heat and execute her moves. While still very exciting to watch, it lacked the back and forth tension of Mari Vs. Kay Lee. I will say it was superior to Racheal’s match against Io at the previous show, and I hope she returns to fight Mayu again, because there is some solid chemistry there. Mayu wins with a Dragon Suplex. (4 out of 5)\n\nMatch 5: Queen’s Quest Vs. Oedo Tai\n\nMain event, and it lived up to the hype. QQ and OT spent the better part of last half year at war, and it lead to some of Stardom’s best matches and moments, but it’s time for the payoff. A definite match with high stakes, and it was executed almost perfectly, with only a few bumps. Going in order of competitors:\n\nAZM Vs. Kris A quick 10 second pin by AZM to start the match, and it sent a shock of surprise through the crowd. Considering Kris is apparently just recovering from an injury, this is understandable I guess. Also considering what’s to come, it might have made sense for someone to go out quickly for the later match ups.\n\nSumire Vs. AZM Sumire underestimates AZM initially, which leads to some good offence from the young QQ member. Sumire ultimately gets the upper hand and the pin (with some help from Oedo Tai), but AZM comes out looking strong still.\n\nIo Vs. Sumire Opening of this match sets the tone, as Sumire initially says she’s just gonna lay down because she doesn’t want to fight Io, only to turn that into a pin opportunity. Back and forth as Sumire tries to cheat as much as possible, but ultimately can’t stop Io’s superior fire power, and is submitted.\n\nKagetsu Vs. Io Here’s where the real crazy work gets done, as arguably the top two wrestlers in Stardom go at it. Both throw everything they have at each other, and it’s highspot city for a bit there. Kagetsu finally gets the upper hand with some blue mist, and knocks Io over the ropes with a vicious chokeslam from the apron! Hopefully these two meet again this year in a singles, because this only made me excited for another match with them.\n\nViper Vs. Kagetsu Not to be overshadowed, Viper brought it, showing her versatility to adapt to whatever Kagetsu could throw at her. They fight to a time limit draw, eliminating each other in the process. Maybe the second best bout of this 5v5 match, and only by a hair. Again, great back and forth here, and Viper continues to impress.\n\nHZK Vs. Hana High energy to start as the two go at it right away with forearms to the face. The pace never really lets down, but the finish probably should have pumped the brakes a bit. Hana places HZK on the top of the ring post while she stands on the apron. This leads to HZK going for a sunset flip powerbomb to the floor. I’ve seen this done before and it always looks nasty even when done “safely”. I’m not sure what happened (the landing was obscured from my seating position) but I heard a loud thud that did not sound good. This led to a double elimination, as both had traveled over the top to the apron already. Hana was tended to by the trainer and other wrestlers, although the match continued. Hana eventually got up, and she stayed to the end to cheer her side, but she was holding the back of her head, and Kris and Sumire both took turns checking in on her. She ultimately was helped to the back after the finish, while the closing speeches were being done.\n\nMomo Vs. Tam So it comes down to the last two members of each team, and they fight like their lives depend on it. Maybe the best showing for both in Stardom to date, and it makes sense since both have something to prove. Lots of near falls and the tension was high right up to the finish, where Momo hits the Somato (running knees) and gets the pin.\n\nFinal Score (5 out of 5)\n\nDespite some blips like the short Kris bout and Hana getting hurt, I felt that match itself flowed perfectly, and told a great story with a great payoff. Also the post match really added to it. The whiplash of emotion as Kagetsu and OT sadly say goodbye to Tam, is quickly reversed with excitement as Io and Mayu both make plays for Tam’s friendship, with Mayu “persuading” her to join the Stardom Army (which apparently includes Team Jungle). Also, Momo challenging Io was a nice and logical move, and should make for another step up moment for Momo. 2017 was kind of an off year for Stardom, and I chalk that up to a combination of roster uncertainty and unfortunate injuries (and that’s mostly the latter half of the year). 2018 is already looking more exciting, with a clearer picture of where the promotion is going and potential fresh programs. As Stardom enter’s it’s 8th year this show made me very optimistic about the upcoming months and year in general.\n\nMarvelous Shin-Kiba 1st Ring 4.15\n\nOpening ceremony, the team does introductions and welcome Takumi Iroha back from injury. Good use of simple lighting and a smoke machine really helped make the show look nice, and production is something that stuck out to me throughout the show. More on that later.\n\n(Pic for reference) https://twitter.com/naozan3380/status/985526805107888128\n\nMatch 1: Mio Momono & Ibuki Hoshi Vs. Tsukasa Fujimoto & Asahi (Ice Ribbon Match)\n\nNever start a show with a show stopper, and that’s what almost happened here! Mio and Tsukasa do most of the heavy lifting this match, and when they tie up it’s excellent. Maybe two of the best joshis out there now, I have yet to watch a bad match with them. Ibuki mostly is there to focus on the rookie Asahi, although she does do some double teaming with Mio on Tsukasa. Obviously a match made to give the young Asahi some practice, she took the pin like a good rookie, in a fun tag match. Asahi fumbles a bit here and there, and seems to get a little confused at the finish when Ibuki goes for the pin off a splash from the top rope. Still, energetic opener and great way to star the show. (3 out of 5)\n\nMatch 2: Tomoko Watanabe Vs.Super Moe-Chan\n\nGet this out of the way, Super Moe-Chan has an awesome remix of The Legend of Zelda theme as her ring entrance, and it really got me hyped. Moe-Chan definitely has personality and presence in the ring. The match itself was good, if not particularly spectacular. Pretty standard wrestling with decent strikes. Tomoko lead Super Moe-Chan through most of the match with solid strikes and submission attempts, but the newcomer to Japan showed some decent fighting spirit. A little comedy gets mixed in, as Moe-Chan has to beg off a few times after few submission attempts. Tomoko goes over with an armbar in the end. (3 out of 5)\n\nMatch 3: Reina Isis & La Jarochita (CMLL) Vs. Kaoru & Chikayo Nagashima\n\nCMLLs luchadoras had an exciting match with the heelish W-Fix members, Kaoru and Chiyako. The action was fast paced, and both sides held up, with the heels getting the edge through constant cheating and double teaming. Kaoru used one of her signature weapons, a wooden board, to great effect, although failed to drop it edge wise on her opponent in the corner. Double paradise lock spot by Karou and Chikayo, with the added bonus of them sitting on their opponents, making the ridiculous move even more hilarious, and somewhat more realistic. W-Fix gets the win when Chikayo hits a brainbuster. (3.5 out of 5)\n\nMatch 3: Yuu Yamagata Vs. Megumi Yabushita\n\nMatch starts with Yuu working Megumi over with her superior strength, culminating in some nasty slaps to Megumi’s inner thigh. The spot is somewhat comical and Megumi sells the injury, at least early on. W-Fix comes out to support their teammate Megumi, and the match spills out into the audience. Yuu is helped by Level 5 stablemate Tomoko, and the too fight back against the 3 on 2 assault, until Kaoru’s board comes into play. Some hits from the board takeout Tomoko, but Yuu almost gets it out of Kaoru’s hands. Chikayo kicks it away, which sets Yuu up for a big boot from Kaoru and a roll up by Megumi. Fun quick match obviously to setup a faction match between the 2 in the future. (3 out 5)\n\nMatch 5: Takumi Iroha, Rin Kadokura & Leo Isaka Vs. Yuki Miyazaki, Nagisa Nozaki & Kesisuke Gotoh (WAVE Pro / Independents)\n\nLet me get this out of the way, a large part of the reason I had to see this show live was to experience the disco fever dream that is the New-Traditional entrance. It did not disappoint, as Takumi and Rin came out and danced with the crowd in dope light up jackets, while a disco ball lit the usually dark Shin-Kiba 1st Ring, and their logo was projected on the ceiling. I got my money’s worth from that alone.\n\nThe match itself was great also. Good mix of tag action, fighting rookie spirit and comedy (via Yuki constantly trying to kiss all her opponents. Her and Dino could use some HR lessons on personal space). Match opens with the rookies Leo and Keisuke squaring of for a quick round of strikes and grappling. Rin and Yuki tag in, and Yuki immediately goes for a lip lock, while Rin fends her off. More hilarity ensues as Yuki gets Rin into an inverted stretch that forces her into an unflattering splits pose. Nagisa takes the ringside camera and does an extreme close up (which is pixelated in a parody of the censorship often found in Japanese adult films in the streaming version, lol). Takumi comes in to break it up and proceeds to unleash some vicious kicks. For someone who just returned from a foot injury, she doesn’t seem to be holding back.\n\nThe rest of the match is a flurry of tag action, kisses, and some big spots by the young Leo, including a suicide senton. New-Tra hits a sweet cannonball-senton combo off/into the same post, and this leads to the finish with Leo hitting a sweet corkscrew moonsault, something I’m sure he learned from Kaoru (who was watching intently off to the side). Very fun main event. (4 out of 5)\n\nPost match, New-Tra signal they want to get the Pro-Wrestling Wave tag belts back, and Yuki and Nagisa seems to accept the challenge. Chigusa Nagoya gets in the ring, and congratulates Leo on his first anniversary in wrestling, and his first win! Also, Chigusa seems to tease him that he might have had his first kiss also, since Yuki caught him during the match. She then invites Chikayo into the ring to celebrate her 23 years in the business. Chikayo receives flowers and a picture of the old GAEA crew is shown. Karou comes in and says a few words, as well as Takumi, and the show closes, while the disco ball lights the place up.\n\nFinal thoughts:\n\nI waited on this one because I wanted to see how it looked on the recorded version. Also, it had been a long weekend of JoshiPro for me (two other Stardom shows and the Joshi Olympics event) so details were getting fuzzy. That said, I was interested in the final broadcast product, since it’s obvious this is a promotion with production in mind. The lights, smoke machine, bubble machine, intro videos and multiple cameras all made for a slick production. I counted at least 3 cameras, one set high, one hand cam run by Chigusa, and one near the entrance to capture the wrestlers going to the ring. While not every match was as lit up as the New-Tra one, they all seemed to take advantage of the equipment on hand.\n\nThis all leads to a pretty nice final product. Watching the streaming version on their Fresh! channel, I enjoyed how all the parts came together to give the sense of a big show, at least by Japanese indie standards. The multiple cameras still suffer from slight lighting differences, but it’s not as bad as other promotions I’ve seen. I think the combination of extra lighting, probably buying all the cameras at the same time, and some post production color matching leads to a more uniform product, which makes for a nicer viewing experience. That said, there were a few rapid cuts that made me wonder if Kevin Dunn has decided to visit Japan for a bit.\n\nThe crowd was definitely hot, and I could see they were dedicated to the brand. Some New-Tra fans had come with prepared lights, and clearly had practiced the hand gestures from the entrance routine. They didn’t quite fill the place, but it was a solid house, especially considering how young the company is (They’ve been only really running their own shows for about a year).\n\nLooking at the talent, Takumi, Rin and Mio could be future legends if they can stay healthy. All of them are solid wrestlers and performers, and if they can build a roster around them, Marvelous has a real shot at being something big.\n\nI highly recommend anyone who enjoys joshi pro check out their Fresh! Channel, and subscribe. The fee is 600 yen, or roughly $5.50 USD. Skip a dinner out each month, and spend some time with some excellent joshipro at home.\n\nOther Random Post Show Thoughts:\n\nI really need to go watch a WAVE show. Also, more Ice Ribbon.\n\nMarvelous tracksuits are dope.\n\nI’m totally gonna buy that New-Tra entrance theme CD, and maybe learn the dance.\n\nKaoru is almost 50 years old, yet she could give Jeffy Hardy a run for his money in the highflying moonsault/senton department.\n\nI will probably buy a W-Fix/Hookers T-shirt, and then regret I can never wear it out in public.\n\nSEAdLINNNG 5.3 Yokhama Golden Week Show\n\nI’ve debated whether I should go to a SEAdLINNNG show for a while, obviously because of the history of some of the talent involved. That said, I felt I was cheating myself not going to watch a show that has Nanae Takahashi and Arisa Nakajima on it. This card was pretty solid, with performers from Ice Ribbon, WAVE, FREEDOMS and Asuka Project all participated. Also, freelancers Makoto and Kaho Kobayashi (fresh from her excursion to Mexico) were in attendance.\n\nI’ll give more thoughts about the promotion itself, but let’s cover the show and matches first.\n\nOpening ceremony, and the SEAdLINNNG roster comes out to greet the crowd. You’re usual stuff, until they invite guest Takashi Sasaki from FREEDOMS to join them. He greets the crowd and talks about his show tomorrow in the same location. He then suggests doing a warm up with the crowd, and asks everyone to stand. He goes through some basic level stretches, while elementary school warm up music plays. Crowd plays along, and at the end everyone does the lowercase “d” with their arms, apparently the sign for the promotion and it’s fans. Then it’s on with the card.\n\nMatch 1: 5 Minute Exhibition. Nanae Takahashi (SEAdLINNNG) Vs. Takashi Sasaki (FREEDOMS).\n\nJust a simple warm up match to get the crowd going. Both Nanae and Takashi show good levels on intensity, striking and grappling to a time limit draw. Show of respect at the end, and we move on. Nothing much else to say, maybe given more time, this could have been something interesting.\n\n2 / 5\n\nMatch 3: 4 Way High Speed Match. Shunsuke Sayama (Asuka Project) Vs. Dragon Libre (FREEDOMS) Vs. Nagisa Nozaki Vs. Asuka (WAVE).\n\nA lot of comedy in the match, especially at the start. Alliances are formed quickly and forgotten. Shunsuke suggests Asuka team with him, because he is from the Asuka Project. Dragon Libre pretty much just plays everyone. Natsuki Taiyo, the referee, seems to have a grudge against Asuka, which leads to everyone else teaming up on her to get an advantage. Asuka spends most of the match fighting back, hitting some solid moves including an asai moonsault. Ultimately Dragon Libre rolls up Shunsuke with La Magistral and gets the pin. Some shows of respect, until Natsuki takes one more swipe at Asuka, before gunning out of the ring with Asuka in hot pursuit through the curtain. Fun match, if a bit messy and sometimes confused.\n\n3 / 5\n\nMatch 3: Yoshiko (SEAdLINNG) Vs. Asahi (Ice Ribbon).\n\nRookie Asahi takes on “She Who Shall Not Be Named (but will be in this review for ease of writing)”, Yoshiko in a really exciting match. The rookie plays her part, charging at her bigger more experienced opponent like a bat out of hell. Yoshiko mostly no sells, battering the young rookie with chops, lariats and brutal kicks. Asashi does slowly wear down Yoshiko, and starts to get some offence in. A fun wristlock spot sees Asahi use the ropes to flip out and reverse the move, only for Yoshiko to do the same, albeit with a little more of a struggle. Yoshiko makes a few attempts to go for a submission win, but Asahi is able to fire up and get to the ropes for breaks. Yoshiko hits a flurry of slams and power moves, putting the rookie away after a surprisingly long intense match. Yoshiko seems to offer to help the beaten Asahi up, but the rookie lashes back, leading to an amused Yoshiko giving her the old Stone Cold salute and leaving the ring.\n\nCredit to both performers, they played their parts well. Yoshiko was every bit the heelish monster she had to be, but at no time did she seem to be dangerous with the younger Asahi. The Ice Ribbon rookie showed real energy, but also a solid amount of skill given her experience. I can see a bright future for her and look forward to how she develops.\n\n3.75 / 5\n\nMatch 4: Ultra777 U-21 Tag Tournament Match. Makoto & Kaho Kobayashi Vs. Hamuko Hoshi & Ibuki (both of Ice Ribbon).\n\nThe tag matches seemed to be the highlight of this show, and the tournament is building to a final at Korakuen Hall in about 2 weeks. The concept (as far as I can tell) is that the teams with mixed levels of experience (but under 21 years total) enter into a randomized bracket of 6 teams. 2 “Lucky” teams get a bye.\n\nThis was a really good match. Kaho returns from a 3 month excursion to Mexico and is energetic as ever coming to the ring draped in the Mexican flag. She teams with former REINA teammate Makoto, and the two work great together. The Ice Ribbon team of Hamuko and Ibuki also gel well, although it’s more of a rookie mentor dynamic. The match is fast, as an energized Kaho takes charge, looking to show off what she learned in Mexico. Good team work from both sides, and this is the best I have seen Makoto be in awhile. She seems to have gotten back to 100% again, after what felt like over a year on the shelf. Hamuko and Ibuki fight hard, and Ibuki uses some Ice Ribbon favorites like the sideways rolling school boy to try and get a pin. Kaho wins this one for her team with a beautiful fisherman’s suplex, and advances to the next round.\n\n4 / 5\n\nMatch 5: Arisa Nakajima (SEAdLINNNG) & Tsukasa Fujimoto (Ice Ribbon) Vs. Akane Fujita (Ice Ribbon) and Ryo Mizunami (WAVE).\n\nI may have a new favorite “Best Friends” tag team in Arisa and Tsukasa. The two came out in matching gear, and proceeded to have a fantastic match with Akane and Ryo. Having just come from the TJPW show and watched the spectacular main event of Rika Tatsumi Vs. Miyu Yamashita, I did not expect to see that topped, at least not in the same 24 hours! I still probably like Rika Vs. Miyu more, but this was a hell of a main event.\n\nThis match is a blur of tag team double team moves, vicious drop kicks, brutal strikes and suplexes. In particular, Ryo and Arisa seem to go to war with some of the hardest strikes I’ve seen in any match, regardless of gender. Ryo even unleashes a few headbutts that were either very well timed with slaps, or very painful for all involved. The match ends in a 15 minute draw, but since a winner needs to be decided for the tournament, the match gets extended with a new 2 count rule. After a short break for the teams to drink water and regroup, the action resumes and at a breakneck speed. More strikes, and rapid pin attempts. Akane absorbs a lot of punishment including 3 PKs in the a row, and ultimately takes Tsukasa’s Infinity finisher, giving “Best Friends” the win.\n\n4.5 / 5\n\nAfter the match, Arisa and Tsukasa receive a prize from a local sponsor, and while posing with an ad board, are attacked from behind by Yoshiko. Yoshiko makes it clear she plans to win this tag tournament with her partner Rina Yamashita at Korakuen hall. Makoto and Kaho come out to remind Yoshiko they have to beat them first. Kaho also seems to indicate she wants a shot at Yoshiko’s titles (I assume the OZ academy championship). Nanae comes out to break things up, and notes that Arisa and Tsukasa will have to beat the team of Saki Akai (DDT) and Sae (Nagoya Dream Girls). The wrestlers then clear the ring, and allow the winning team to celebrate with the audience, using variation of the SEAdLINNNG lower case “d” sign to for a lower case “b” for Best Friends.\n\nFinal Thoughts:\n\nThis was a great show, stacked with amazing talent from multiple promotions. The variety really lead to a fun card. SEAdLINNG is probably one of the smallest promotions I’ve seen, consisting of Nane Takahashi, Arisa Nakajima, Yoshiko and Natsuki Taiyo (who is a referee). That said, their overall presentation was about on the level of Stardom, Marvelous or Sendai Girls. There was a camera team and a good sized staff, and their merch game was on point. I did see what looked like might be a trainee or two running around, so there is a chance we will see some new rookies out of the promotion in due time.\n\nI know some of you will still be cautious about watching this promotion, and I can understand because of the Yoshiko factor. That said, I noticed more than a few Stardom regulars, like white under shirt dude. A lot of the crowd struck me as older joshi fans, and they all seemed fine with Yoshiko’s inclusion. Additionally, Yoshiko definitely had some female fans, who connect with her “Yankee” non conformist style. The match she had was very good, and while I don’t think she should be forgiven completely yet, she seems dedicated to the art of pro-wrestling. I highly recommend tracking down this show, and probably this tournament in general. I know I’ll be keeping my out more for SEAdLINNNG shows and appearances in the future.\n\nRandom Notes:\n\nThe announcer seemed to make some funny errors early on, including calling Takashi Sasaki “Takeshi”, mispronuncing the sponsors name and not seeming to be able to explain the name of the tournament.\n\nAfter Asahi’s match with Yoshiko, Tsukasa carried the young crying rookie off on her back (as she tends to do with her trainees). Hilariously, as I was headed to washroom during the intermission, I passed the two in the hall, the crying Asahil still piggyback riding Tsukasa. They carried on the act all the way to the elevators, for anyone around to see. Now that is protecting the business!\n\nI bought special Golden Week 8X10 signed by all four members, not realizing there was a stipulation that came with it. As I was paying, Natsuki Taiyo came over and thanked me, then shouted to Nanae who was in the ring making announcements that I had bought the second to last one. Nanae thanked me, and then proceed to challenge me to a very public game of rock-paper-scissor. Apparently if you won, you got a polaroid photo for free with a member of your choice (a sign I did not notice hanging off the table explaining this). I’m proud to say that despite being confused and nervous as hell, I went three rounds with the joshi legend before getting felled by “rock”. And I thought riding the elevator silently with Sanshiro Takagi in Korakuen hall was going to be my most exciting moment today!"
