        "text": "I’m probably more excited than I should be, so I’m expecting to be disappointed to a degree. Being a fan of TNA for nearly…20 years…wow, 20? God damn, I feel super old now. BUT! Not the point, being that I remember FSN, Spike, Weekly PPVs, Destination America, POP and now AXS era, this is pretty awesome. The three letters that never really died, much like ECW, and now when people refer to it as TNA; they’re not wrong anymore!\n\nAlex Shelley and Chris Sabin as singles champions kicks off the brand well, The ABC are young guys who could really be the future of TNA, Knockouts division is rebuilding, but has a bit of unproven potential and thankfully on the preshow Crazzy Steve took the Digital Media title off of Tommy Dreamer!\n\nThis is just fun, so I don’t really have coherent thoughts. Let’s just get to the show!\n\nRatings:\n\nKnockouts #1 Contender Ultimate X: Tasha Steelz vs Alisha Edwards vs Gisele Shaw vs Jody Threat vs Dani Luna vs Xia Brookside: Gisele wins – ** 1/4\n\nPCO vs Dirty Dango w/Alpha Bravo & Oleg Prudius\n\nPCO, Jake Something and Rhino vs Dirty Dango, Alpha Bravo and Oleg Prudius: PCO wins via PCO Sault – **\n\nTNA Knockouts Championship: MK Ultra (Masha Slamovich & Killer Kelly) (c) vs Decay (Rosemary & Havok): Decay win via Assisted Sit out Chokebomb – ** 1/2 – TITLE CHANGE!!!\n\nX Division Championship: Chris Sabin (c) vs El Hijo Del Vikingo vs Kushida: Sabin retains via Cradle Shock – *** 3/4\n\nJosh Alexander vs Alex Hammerstone: Josh wins via C4 Spike – *** 3/4\n\nTNA Tag Team Title 4 Way Dance: ABC (Ace Austin & Chris Bey) (c) vs The Rascals (Zachary Wentz & Trey Miguel) vs Grizzled Young Vets (James Drake & Zach Gibson) vs Mike Bailey & Laredo Kid: ABC retain via 1-2-Sweet – *** 1/2\n\nTNA Knockouts Championship: Trinity (c) vs Jordynne Grace: Jordynne wins via Juggernaut Driver – *** – TITLE CHANGE!!!\n\nTNA World Championship: Alex Shelley (c) vs Moose: Moose wins via Lights Out – *** 1/2 – TITLE CHANGE!!!\n\nResults:\n\nKnockouts #1 Contender Ultimate X: Tasha Steelz vs Alisha Edwards vs Gisele Shaw vs Jody Threat vs Dani Luna vs Xia Brookside\n\nEveryone scurries off into pairs to stop certain people from climbing early, and we get a quick stare down between Dani, Xia and Jody. Nothing fancy, just a little but of the Triple Threat style of wrestling to give Xia an early shine since she’s brand new to TNA, but Tasha kicks Dani’s head off to change the dynamic. Xia continues to showcase some of her offense while Tasha continues to show she’s too slow for some of the spots (look at the Satellite feed into the tandem move, and Tasha makes it look super awkward and slow). Jody and Dani get a few isolated minutes and Dani hits her with the ole Sack of Shit, into an Exploder, followed by another Exploder to Gisele and a Dive. Xia sees the opportunity, and flies into both Gisele and Dani. Jody decides to ignore climbing for the X and Cannonball’s into the previous three. I hate moves like that when they don’t make logical match sense.\n\nAlisha I’ll give credit, she grabs Jody but Jody keeps climbing with Lish on her back. As she climbs the truss, Lish falls into the pile of 3, then Tasha cuts off Jody and goes for the Okurrr to the outside into the pile. Lish tries to sneak back into the ring, but Tasha cuts her off and…for Christ sake’s we don’t need a damned Tower of Doom…that move is so overused. Xia climbs on the other side, Gisele tries to stop her, but Dani plucks Gisele off the corner. Xia tries to slide across but slips onto Dani’s shoulders and eats a Powerbomb. Dani takes out Tasha and Jody, but now Lish tries to sneak across but she falls down onto Dani and turns the catch into a DDT.\n\nLish grabs Kendra her Kendo Stick and starts lighting up her opponents. Xia stops Lish with a Codebreaker, then we get a bit of a signature spam from all the women to neutralize each other. Ending in a stacked Pop Shove-It from Jody onto Xia and Lish. A bit more chaos ensues as they start to just swing and lay each other out. I ends up with Tasha, Gisele and Dani making a dash for the X. Gisele hits Tasha with the X, Dani loses her grip and Gisele manages to grab the X!\n\nIt’s taken a little bit, but Gisele might finally be on her way to get a real push.\n\nPCO vs Dirty Dango w/Alpha Bravo & Oleg Prudius\n\nPCO goes back to an ROH flavored entrance of being shocked back to life by a team of ‘doctors’.\n\nDango gets rocked quick, Alpha Bravo slides in to try and interrupt the PCO Sault and he’s successful. So Dango gets disqualified. Prudius slowly motions to the ring, and then Rhino comes out for the save. Dango and Bravo stop Prudius from engaging, but then the Depictionator of Authorization arrives to makea-a-tag-teams match. Three versus three, and Jake Something is the third member of PCO’s team.\n\nPCO, Jake Something and Rhino vs Dirty Dango, Alpha Bravo and Oleg Prudius\n\nJake flies into the ring literally, and there’s a huge brawl. PCO Sault connects, Deanimator on Dango, and just a lot of the Babyfaces wailing on the heel team. PCO finally tags in Jake, and Jake keeps Dango on a string and rocks him with heavy lariats and strikes. Rhino comes in, Las Vegas pops, and the Manbeast is in control. Rhino heads to the far corner for a Gore but gets laid out with a Prudius Clothesline.\n\nBravo and Dango work over Rhino, tag Prudius in and now we get a glimpse of something that could be cool, but this isn’t the match for that. So Bravo tags back in with Rhino trying to fight back. Dango tags and we see typical quick heel tags, Dango tries to land an exposed Knee Drop from the top, but Rhino moves and Jake Something comes in fast. Dango counters Into the Void and shoves Jake into the corner. PCO tags himself in, Bravo tags out Dango, but PCO eats Bravo. Lungblower into a Guillotine Leg Drop, but Prudius attacks PCO and lays him out. Rhino and him have the stare down, Rhino manages to take him off his feet with the Shoulder Tackle. Gore aims for Dango, but Dango moves out of the way and lets Bravo eat the Gore. Jake Powerbombs Dango into Bravo, PCO Sault on Bravo, and he dead.\n\nTNA Knockouts Championship: MK Ultra (Masha Slamovich & Killer Kelly) (c) vs Decay (Rosemary & Havok)\n\nAdmittedly I’m gonna miss JesSICKa, but I’m definitely not gonna miss Courtney Rush. But I guess Rosemary’s return is worth the sacrifice.\n\nHavok charges the championship corner, and Masha is on the receiving end of some fast offense. It’s not until Kelly grabs Rosemary’s feet to give Masha an opening, and the champions start to put some of their own aggression together. Kelly keeps the offense rolling until she gets a little cocky and starts to crawl over top of Rosemary. Rosemary does her ‘rise from the grave’ spot, and rains down some punches onto Kelly. Simultaneous tags to Masha and Havok, but Havok easily handles both Masha and Kelly at different points.\n\nA little bit of chaos distracts Havok, Waterwheel Kick connects, Russian Death Device, but Havok kicks out at 1! Havok hits the Double Chokeslam on both women, they hit an Assisted Sit out Chokebomb finisher, and Decay wins!\n\nX Division Championship: Chris Sabin (c) vs El Hijo Del Vikingo vs Kushida\n\nA triple collar elbow is kinda dumb, but they also realize that, so Sabin and Kushida team up real quick on Vikingo, but he fights back quickly and there’s rolling quick attacks. Speaking of rolling, Kushida lets the spots breathe for a second and then literally rolls forward and hits the Low Dropkick on Vikingo and we’re back to locomotion attacks. Kushida tries to focus on Vikingo’s arm, and gets in a few strikes before Vikingo stops him in his tracks with a kick, a flashing kick to Sabin and then continues the variety of kicks. Kushida gets kicked back into the Corner and Vikingo hits Flipping Dragonrana on Kushida into a standing Bow and Arrow.\n\nSabin lets the offense sink in a little before breaking it up. Sabin cuts off Kushida’s attempted Back Handspring and then slides between Vikingo’s Legs and rolls into the Boston Crab. Indian Deathlock tandem submission using Kushida as a tool against Vkingo. Sabin is in charge until Kushida turns the tables on creative tandem attacks. Kushida looks for a dual Hoverboard Lock, but Vikingo bails, Sabin fights it off and throws Kushida into the corner. Monkey Flip from Kushida, Vikingo turns it into a Flying Headscissors and goes as Kushida. The inadvertent assisted moves are pretty great and there’s never a ton of space between the spots.\n\nTornado DDT from Sabin off of Vikingo. Then Sabin hits the Pump Handle Michinoku Driver for 2. Vikingo starts to fight back, hits a Go To Sleep variation, followed by a Step Over 450 Splash onto the ramp. Kushida starts hunting for Hoverboard Locks. He’s got Sabin in a standing Hoverboard, so Vikingo just lands the Double Stomp while Kushida is prone. Springboard Canadian Destroyer from Sabin to Vikingo on the ramp. Kushida looks to take advantage, but Sabin slips under for the Avalanche Belly to Back Suplex. Cradle Shock…but no! Kushida tries to counter with Hoverboard lock, but Sabin fights it off. Vikingo can be seen crawling down the ramp trying to get to the ring as Sabin pulls off the Cradle Shock and retains!\n\nJosh Alexander vs Alex Hammerstone\n\nFairly even start until Josh tries a quick Ankle Lock, so Hammerstone kicks him off, Pump Kicks Josh out of the ring, and then hits a Plancha before he basks in some crowd noise. As things head back in, Josh fights back and we’re back to a close parity. Hammerstone misses a Chop, so the Dragon Screw from Josh gives him a very meticulous advantage. Hammerstone gets back up, then Josh starts lighting him up in the corner with Chops; but those are just pissing off Hammer.\n\nHammer reverses the Irish Whip, Josh bounces out of the corner and a Belly to Belly leaves Josh reeling for a second. Hammerstone keeps going for power moves but Josh is doing a good job keeping out of anything big. Josh dodges another Pump Kick, Rocks Hammer, Scoops him up and drops him onto the apron and starts focusing Hammerstone’s back. Low Crossbody to the outside, Rolling Senton, and a Knee Drop into an Ankle Lock just keep pushing the advantage towards Josh. Hammer starts to Hulk up, and Josh tries to chop him down but a goozle into a Gorilla Press and then a swing out Uranage. Corner Lariats ala Vader or Kojima, Josh tries to comeback, Hammer with the Up and Over but seems to tweak something. Josh thinks he has a moment, but Hammer still pulls off the Scoop Power Slam.\n\nPump Kick, gets blocked, Hammer gets wrestled down, Ankle Lock, into a Grapevined Ankle Lock, but Hammerstone manages to barely get to the ropes. Hammerstone tries something but sells the leg, Josh charges and Hammer manages to pull off the Nightmare Pendulum, but he can’t cover. By the time he tries to go for a pin, Josh is aware enough to roll to the outside. Hammer has to limp to the apron, goes for a Death Valley Driver, and gets it on the second shot. Rolls Josh in, heads to the top for a Missile Dropkick, TKO, kick out at 2! They stand up, Fightning Spirit spot, Hammerstone blocks a Rolling Forearm with his neck, German Suplex into a Powerbomb, for only 2. Nightmare…no Inside Cradle from Josh. Forearm to the back of the head from Josh, German Suplex, C4 Spike, and Josh pulls it off!\n\nTNA Tag Team Title 4 Way Dance: ABC (Ace Austin & Chris Bey) (c) vs The Rascals (Zachary Wentz & Trey Miguel) vs Grizzled Young Vets (James Drake & Zach Gibson) vs Mike Bailey & Laredo Kid\n\nGYV and ABC start off for ownership of the Alphabet. Ace gets worked over a bit by both Vets, but when Bey finally comes in we do get a hot moment for the champions. Rascalz blind tag Zach Gibson as he reels, then Rascalz light up Bey. Bey stumbles into the Mexican Speed corner. Things get hectic as all 8 men get in there at some point and the referee has to forcibly settle things and call in two people.\n\nGibson and Speedball face off, Bailey hits the rapid fire kicks but the GYV work together fluidly and you see a lot of quick Tandem Attacks, Drake flies over a prone Bailey and connects a Missile Dropkick onto Laredo out of nowhere. Bailey keeps looking for a tag, and in Speedball’s desperation he kicks Drake into the Rascalz corner and Wentz tags himself in. Drake and Wentz argue and fight a bit, which gives Bailey the chance to fight back and get out of the match finally. Laredo Kid takes out Drake and Trey, Wentz tries to take advantage of things, but Laredo turns the attack into an Avalanche Michinoku Driver, only for 2! ABC take a blind tag in, and start flowing until Ace screws up his Triangle Kick. He loses his footing while Bey has Wentz in a Torture Rack, but goes back to the it and hits it. He calls to Bey that it was his bad, so he owns the botch, which is smart. But hell this action is quick, complex and its just bodies everywhere.\n\nBailey hits a Moonsault to the outside. Laredo kid slips in the bad corner, but Bailey makes the save, Tornado Kick, into Ultima Weapon for 2 because The Rascalz make the pinfall save! Trey takes out Miguel, UFO Cutter from Wentz on Bailey. Spinebuster, Superkick, Double Stomp by The Rascalz, but Ace breaks it up. Double Cold Cock, Cut Off Dropkicks from The ABC, 1-2-SWEET! ABC RETAIN!\n\nTNA Knockouts Championship: Trinity (c) vs Jordynne Grace\n\nThe reveal was sadly Dana Brooke now being called Ash by Elegance, which is stupid. So TNA gonna TNA I suppose.\n\nWell it feels like the reveal of Dana Brooke did nothing for the crowd or this match. The match starts slow, but not meticulous slow, just stupid slow, and Trinity’s combination kicks look slow, weak and bad. It’s a lot of Trinity going for bad offense, and Jordynne just catches her and drops her. Very slow Crossbody from the top rope, into her weird little Headscissor’s Spike…but again…this has been bad.\n\nPatrick Mahomes got his helmet cracked on his scramble. Damn, that’s crazy…oh the match is still going on? Jordynne has manhandled Trinity, Trinity gets in a few desperate Backdrops, there’s a strike spot where Grace asks for more punishment and still fights through it to trade. Bulldog into the middle turnbuckle from Trinity finally starts looking alright, Split-Legged Moonsault gets Trin a 2. Trinity tries to fight from the corner, Spinning Backfist from Jordynne, Kinniku Buster for 2! Jordynne drops down on the Cradle attempt, Trinity rolls things into the Starstruck, but Jordynne fights through it for a near fall, Rear View from Trinity for 2!\n\nJordynne fights through another Starstruck, just stands up, Trinity tries to grab the ropes as they come up but a Wheelbarrow Suplex rocks Trinity, Juggernaut Driver for the win.\n\nTNA World Championship: Alex Shelley (c) vs Moose\n\nDeAngelo Williams comes out with Moose and the rest of The System. Harkening back to their tag match together at Slammiversary 2017 against Chris Adonis and Eli Drake.\n\nMoose goes for the handshake, Shelley slaps it away, Moose palms his face and Shelley Water Mists Moose in response and then fires right after him. Shelley tries to work the left arm and wrestles Moose down to the mat. Shelley really is going for the ground game, but Moose immediately finds the ropes and tries to get this back up to a vertical position. Working over the left arm from different angles continues to be Shelley’s gameplan, but he gets a little arrogant and Moose makes him pay with that beautiful Okada Dropkick. The champion powders, and Moose follows, lighting him up with the one arm, bouncing Shelley’s face off the apron and Moose is starting to use his size and power to his advantage.\n\nShelley catches Moose, and starts going for the arm, and utilizing the old adage of ‘ever see what a chainsaw does to a tree’. He keeps chopping Moose down at the legs and finding different ways to injure Moose’s left arm. Shelley looks to go for his own Hoverboard Lock, and Moose is trying to fight back and throws Shelley into the corner with Snake Eyes! Moose hit Garvin Stomps on the downed champion, and lords over him, taking his time with deliberate slaps. Shelley fires but then eats an Uranage for 2! Shelley tries to fire with an Enzuigiri, eats a Pump Kick from Moose, Moose tries a Powerbomb but Shelley pulls off a DDT and both are selling.\n\nThey rise slowly, Shelley with the John Woo kick to the corner, a Forearm Splash, and now looking for a Brainbuster but Moose counters, Shelley breaks it with his knee, dumps Moose to the outside, looks for a big Dive, Plancha redirect because Moose moves, picks the ankle and bounces Shelley’s face off the apron. Sliced Bread, countered, Moose tries to drive Shelley into the post, Shelley slips out the back and then hits Shell Shock on the outside. Shelley looks willing to accept a count out victory, but Moose slides in at 9. Punt Kick, Flat Liner into the Middle Turnbuckle from Shelley, goes for the School Boy, only 2, Forearm, 2, floats over to the Border City Stretch, but Moose counters. Powerbomb from Moose and only a 2! Moose goes for Lights Out but misses, Shelley with a few big Lariats but they aren’t doing a ton. SHIRANUI but only for 2!\n\nDeAngelo Williams walks out, as well as the rest of The System. Sabin and Kushida take out Edwards and Myers, but DeAngelo is still there. Moose charges, low bridge and Moose spills out to the ramp. Chokeslam attempt from Moose, but no, Suplex attempt from Shelley and definitely no. Powerbomb countered, and then Facebuster from Shelley, sending Moose face and left shoulder first into the ramp. They both get back in, Chop exchange, Moose seems to be getting the best, even with only one arm at this point. Rolling Forearm 3 times from Shelley, Kawada Kicks, PK got countered by a Headbutt from Moose, Moose hits the ropes, HUGE LARIAT FROM SHELLEY! Misawa, Kawada, Suzuki and Kobashi homages, Superkick into a Shell Shock attempt but Moose spins out, Shell Shock attempt again, spin out from Moose, he hits the ropes and LIGHTS OUT! MOOSE WINS!\n\n1983 Vince Niel shows up! Nic Nemeth’s music hits, he sneaks up behind Moose, hits the Zig Zag, and runs into the crowd, and the crowd is totally loving it.\n\nOverall Score: 7.25/10\n\nWell I’ll admit it wasn’t as awesome as I was hoping for, and that Dana Brooke with the dumbest name imaginable really took a dump on any momentum the show had. Moose going over is great, Gisele winning the Ultimate X is nice if they let her be more aggressive and less chicken shit heel with a team. Not sure if Trinity losing means she’s on her way out, but she might be back on the road to WWE since that match really had bad pacing and poor contact for the better portion of the early goings. I was happy to see Hammerstone in TNA, but judging from how that match went, he obviously hasn’t agreed to anything with TNA. Also I won’t overlook the 4 Way Tag, it would’ve been a bit better if there were less noticeable botches and hitches, but it was still crazy entertaining.\n\nThe rest of the show was…alright. Given the fact the last month or so was highlight reels, parody shows and not a lot, this really felt like a clean restart. So I’m hoping it will just take a little bit of time and momentum to find their new TNA rhythm, but Ash by Elegance is almost as cringe as Emmalina. I have no clue why they would give Dana Brooke attention. Nic Nemeth was the biggest confirmation of the night, so lets see if Ziggles can help revitalize this new era of TNA.\n\nPowered by RedCircle\n\nLet us know what you think on social media @ChairshotMedia and always remember to use the hashtag #UseYourHead!\n\nWho feels great after round eight?\n\nThe G1 Climax keeps heating up, and now we see Heat Storm battle Gene Blast once again!

Finlay takes a swing, but Cobb gets under. Finlay fights another lift so Cobb shoves him to a corner. Cobb runs in to UPPERCUT! Cobb then hoists Finlay up for an atomic SHOTPUT!

Finlay drags Cobb up, reels him in, but Cobb fights the lift! Cobb starts to lift Finlay but Finlay CLUBS away! Finlay SPITS at Cobb! Cobb ROCKS Finlay!\n\nFinlay rebounds, into an URENAGE, and FALLING HAMMER! Cover, TWO!! Finlay survives, but the GACHIMUCHI MOONSAULT hits! Cover, TWO!! Finlay survives again and Gedo shouts at him to get up. The fans rally as Cobb rises, and Cobb storms his way over. Tour Maker Pose, and the fans cheer. Cobb drags Finlay up, ripcord and- NO, Finlay ROCKS Cobb first! Then ROLLING ELBOWS! Finlay cravats to ACID DROP! Cover, TWO!! Finlay brought out a classic but Cobb is still in this, and we’re past 10 minutes. Finlay still feels he has this, and he drags Cobb up.

Cover, Finlay wins!\n\nWinner: David Finlay, by pinfall (gains 2 points; Cobb earns 0)\n\nIt’s hard to say what is more shocking! The fact Finlay defeated the bigger, stronger Jeff Cobb, or that he did it cleanly! And perhaps bigger than that, Finlay now leads B Block because of it! Will he be the one with the first round bye in the playoffs? Or can Cobb turn the tide in the final round?\n\nG1 Climax 34 B Block: Yota Tsuji VS Yuya Uemura!\n\nIn the year 2024, Gene Blast and Heat Storm are 1-1. Tonight’s main event is a pivotal tiebreaker! While Yota lost at WrestleKingdom 18, he avenged himself in the New Beginning, but will he take something more important than Yuya’s hair from him? Or will Yuya cut off Yota’s playoff hopes?\n\nThe bell rings and the fans rally up for “YO~TA! YO~TA!” Yota grins as Red Shoes assesses it is definitely more Yota than Yuya territory. The two circle, feel things out, then Yuya goes for a leg. Yota holds him off, waistlocks, but Yuya switches. Yota spins around but Yuya lets off, and the fans applaud the standoff. Yuya and Yota reset, circle, and tie up collar ‘n’ elbow. Yuya waistlocks, Yota wrenches free to switch, but Yuya wrenches back to wristlock. Yota spins, slips through, half nelsons, then headlocks.

Yuya then shifts back around, keeps on the hold, and the fans rally. Yota fights, reaches back and headlocks again, but again Yuya bridges! Yuya goes back around, the fans rally up, and Yuya SNAP LOCKS the arm! And SNAP LOCKS it again! Yota endures, even as Yuya puts on more pressure. Yota fights up, slips through, but Yuya puts the hammerlock right back on! Yota fires elbows, gets free, and runs, but into an arm-drag! The fans cheer as Yuya again has the armlock.\n\nYota endures, fights up, and we pass five minutes. Yota fires body shots, then DUMPS Yuya out, only for Yuya to hold onto the arm! Yuya drags Yota outside with him, and the fans rally. Yuya and Yota go around the way, and then to the other side of the ringside area. They end up by commentary and Yota pulls hair!

Yuya fights over, but Yota drags him back! The bad arm is struggling, so Yota holds both legs with one arm! But Yuya fights forward and has the ROPEBREAK! Yota lets go while the fans cheer, and he takes a moment to catch his breath. Yota looms over Yuya, the fans rally up, and Yota drags Yuya up. Red Shoes has Yota back off, he needs to check Yuya first. Yuya’s arm seems to be bothering him now, did it dislocate during the match? Yuya tries to stand, but he can’t take a swing!\n\nSo Yuya HEADBUTTS instead!! Yota staggers back, and Red Shoes does check the arm now. Yota is annoyed now and he drags Yuya up to ROCK him with a forearm. And ROCK him again! Yuya staggers to ropes, but Yota puts him in a corner to CHOP! The fans rally, Yota eggs Yuya on, then ROCKS him with another forearm! And another! And another! Yuya sputters, but Yota stands him up to ROCK him again! Yota brings Yuya around, and LARIATS him right down! Yota roars, the fans fire up, and Yota drags Yuya around. We hit 15 minutes as Yota goes up and up and MAROON CRUSH!

Suplex and- NO, Yuya cradle counters! YUYA WINS!!!\n\nWinner: Yuya Uemura, by pinfall (gains 2 points; Yota earns 0)\n\nWhat a turnaround! Just as it seemed Yuya was out of this fight, he found a way to snatch one from Yota! Does this mean the GENE1 isn’t happening this year, either?\n\nAs for Yuya, after having his hand raised, it is clear he is still in pain from that arm. He storms out to get the mic now, then storms back into the ring. “OI! Everyone, don’t get me wrong. This is a battle!” The fans applaud that, and Yuya takes a breath. Yuya admits, he “stole” this win from Yota, but he vows that he’s not giving up. He admits, he hurt his arm here tonight, but he doesn’t care. Boltin Oleg is his last opponent, and he can use that win to go to the playoffs! The fans cheer that determination!\n\nYuya says there’s one more thing! He doesn’t care about this talk of “new generation” and all that. He alone will be what stirs up the excitement for pro-wrestling in Japan! And to do that, he has to become the strongest! He will be the one to heat things up again!\n\nHowever…\n\nThere is unfortunate news. Despite his bravado at the end, Yuya was checked by NJPW Medical, and NJPW officially posted that Yuya’s arm is NOT okay. He will sadly miss the ninth and final round of the round robin, and points will be forfeited to Boltin Oleg. A pyrrhic victory tonight for the Heat Storm, when and where will we see him back in action?\n\nHere are the current A Block standings!\n\nZack Sabre Jr: 6-2, 12 points [PLAYOFF BERTH]\n\nEvil: 5-3, 10 points\n\nTetsuya Naito: 5-3, 10 points\n\nShingo Takagi: 4-4, 8 points\n\nGreat-O-Khan: 4-4, 8 points\n\nJake Lee: 4-4, 8 points\n\nSanada: 4-4, 8 points\n\nGabe Kidd: 3-5, 6 points [ELIMINATED]\n\nShota Umino: 3-5, 6 points [ELIMINATED]\n\nCallum Newman: 2-6, 4 points [ELIMINATED]\n\nHere are the NEW B Block standings!\n\nDavid Finlay: 5-3, 10 points\n\nJeff Cobb: 5-3, 10 points\n\nRen Narita: 5-3, 10 points\n\nHirooki Goto: 4-4, 8 points\n\nKonosuke Takeshita: 4-4, 8 points\n\nYota Tsuji: 4-4, 8 points\n\nYuya Uemura: 4-5, 8 points [INJURY]\n\nHenare: 3-5, 6 points [ELIMINATED]\n\nBoltin Oleg: 4-5, 8 points [ELIMINATED]\n\nEl Phantasmo: 3-5, 6 points [ELIMINATED]\n\nMy Thoughts:\n\nA great round for B Block, but a bittersweet one given the ending. It’s hard to say what exactly damaged Yuya’s arm, but clearly they kept going with the plan of Yuya winning this match because that was to make things very interesting in B Block. Still great action tonight overall, and what great wins for Oleg and ELP even though they’re not making it to the playoffs. Ren of course had to cheat to win, but at least he did it all on his own. Cobb VS Finlay was great stuff, and since A Block has a clear leader with ZSJ, there of course has to be the competitive traffic jam in B Block, which is why Finlay won tonight. Three men at 5-3, four at 4-4, seeing it all come down to round nine for all of them is going to be awesome stuff.\n\nMy Score: 8.8/10\n\nPowered by RedCircle\n\nLet us know what you think on social media @ChairshotMedia and always remember to use the hashtag #UseYourHead!\n\nJust how “fair” will Father Christian be?\n\nEveryone wants to tear down The Patriarchy and take those AEW World Tag Team Championships, but not if Christian Cage has anything to say about it!\n\nOFFICIAL RESULTS\n\nDarby Allin & Holo.grm VS The Premier Athletes w/ Mark Sterling; Darby & Holo.grm win.\n\nTexas Bull Rope Match: Thunder Rosa VS Deonna Purrazzo; Rosa wins.\n\nFTR VS The Outrunners; FTR wins.\n\nRush VS Preston Vance; Rush wins.\n\nAEW World Championship Eliminator Open Challenge: Swerve Strickland w/ Prince Nana VS Tomohiro Ishii; Swerve wins and denies Ishii a title match.\n\nHikaru Shida VS Aleah James; Shida wins.\n\nAEW World Trios Championships #1 Contenders Match, Special Guest Referee Christian Cage: The Bang Bang Gang VS The House of Black; Double TKO.\n\nPLAY BY PLAY\n\nDarby Allin & Holo.grm VS The Premier Athletes w/ Mark Sterling!\n\nThe Relentless One just went on a Rampage against The Butcher last night, but he wouldn’t be relentless if he took it easy.

Or will Tony Nese & Josh Woods finally put their money where their muscles are?\n\n“Smart” Mark of course has to give the introductions for his team. “It’s no secret that this Texas residency has been a slack jawed nightmare for our team.

Will he be the shining star of AEW’s future?\n\nDustin Rhodes speaks.\n\n“1978, my father put a bull rope on his wrist, set the standard for brutality. You do not take a Texas Bull Rope Match lightly. I’ve had my share, and you don’t agree to it unless you’re prepared to put your body through Hell, and drag your opponent with you. Thunder Rosa embodies the Texas spirit. A lifetime little warrior who looks each failure in the face and dares it to try again. Deonna Purrazzo is a ruthless mastermind. She can break your limb, knock you out, and still won’t stop until you beg.\n\n“Twelve feet of raw rope, a brass cowbell in between that has beaten generations of men. And these two women on either end, looking to make violent history.

Rosa slumps to the floor while Collision goes picture in picture.\n\nDeonna backs off, and goes looking under the ring. Deonna doesn’t find what she wants, so she goes around the corner to CLUB Rosa.

However, BREAKING NEWS, AEW Dynamite will see The Young Bucks return and defend the AEW World Tag Team Championships against The Acclaimed! Will Matthew & Nicholas Jackson stay on top? Or will Max Caster & Anthony Bowens prove they are the best in the world today?\n\nBackstage interview with Kip Sabian.\n\nLexy Nair is with Superbad and says he explicitly told Nick Wayne to come find him. However, wasn’t it Kip who went and “found” Nick? Kip says he just wants back in the action! But this is more than about him. This is about his family, about his dad, about- Nick walks in. Nick asks why Kip is ignoring the question. Or more importantly, why is Kip still in Nick’s business? Is Kip obsessed with him or something? Not that Nick blames Kip. Nick is the youngest champion in AEW history. And after five years, Kip is still a nobody. But no more games. Kip will end it next Friday on Rampage as they go 1v1.\n\nAnd Nick adds that Kip’s dad definitely died a loser, so he’ll make sure Kip goes out the same way. Christian Cage’s Prodigy is just as awful a person, but will he see he’s not better than Superbad?\n\nAEW shares footage from after Wednesday Night Dynamite.\n\nMJF asks if everyone saw that! That is the difference between a “foreign freak like Will Ospreay, and an American Hero, MJF.” MJF is referring to how he defeated Kyle Fletcher. Ospreay simply watched Kyle get decimated by the greatest champion in the world, Maxwell Jacob Friedman. MJF doesn’t let his brothers in arms get hurt. He cares about his friends and about his country. Ospreay is inferior to a true American like MJF! But Ospreay knows the truth. He was trapped in his room. Kyle does have to ask Ospreay why he won’t just hit “that move?” Ospreay asks Kyle if he was in that match with Bryan Danielson.\n\nBryan is a man Ospreay looked up to, and he dropped that man on his head and neck! And for weeks, Bryan couldn’t pick up his child! Ospreay does NOT want to hit such a move. Even if MJF is a piece of crap, nobody deserves to take that move. Kyle says if there is one person to deserve that move, it’s MJF. MJF has now called out another of Ospreay’s friends in Michael Oku of Rev-Pro in the UK! MJF vows to destroy Oku as another example to Ospreay. MJF will do what Ospreay cannot, and hit a Tiger Driver 91! Then MJF will do that to Ospreay, too! The American Hero says nothing but facts, so thank him later.\n\nRush VS Preston Vance!\n\nDon Callis told El Toro Blanco that if he truly wants to be the best, he has to be willing to do anything, and do it to anyone. Perro Peligroso used to be Rush’s amigo, but will he simply be a dangerous dog that Rush puts down?\n\nThe bell rings and Vance gets in Rush’s face. They argue over what they’re even doing here, and Vance lifts the Ungovernable fist! Rush says okay, and then he DECKS Vance! Don Callis is watching backstage, and he likes what he sees already. Rush CHOPS Vance, whips him, but Vance dodges to LARIAT! And LARIAT again! Rush ducks ‘n’ dodges but runs into a SPINEBUSTER! Vance roars, Rush bails out, but Vance CHOPS! And ROCKS! And CHOPS! Repeat! Vance whips Rush but Rush reverses to send Vance into railing! Rush then whips Vance into more railing! And then back into more railing!\n\nThe fans rally as Rush dribbles Vance’s face off the railing! Rush CLUBS and HEADBUTTS, and even BITES Vance’s face! The ref reprimands, Rush lets off, and Vance flounders. Rush refreshes the ring count, and he grabs a chair. Rush sets it nearby to then stand Vance up. Vance is bleeding, and Rush tastes the blood! Rush SMACKS Vance off the chair! And again, and again, and again! Rush puts Vance in, then he revels in the cheers. Rush storms in, the fans rally behind him, and Rush scuffs Vance. Rush tells Vance to fight, so Vance grabs him by the neck! Rush CHOPS, CHOPS and CHOPS! Vance ROCKS Rush! Vance runs, Rush sidesteps to SNAP GERMAN!\n\nVance is right up, Rush runs but into a SPEAR! Cover, TWO! Vance drags Rush up, but Rush fights the nelson to ELBOW! Vance DISCUS LARIATS! Cover, TWO! Vance seethes but Rush is in a corner. Vance says you mess with the bull, you get the horns! But then Rush OVERHEAD BELLY2BELLY SUPLEXES Vance! Rush scuffs, kicks, and HEADBUTTS away on Vance’s bloody forehead! The ref counts, Rush lets off, and the fans rally again. Rush runs, and he proves Vance right! BULL’S HORNS!! Cover, Rush wins!\n\nWinner: Rush, by pinfall\n\nA fast ‘n’ furious fight from both men, and Callis is very impressed. Will Rush finally start to see things Don’s way? Speaking of, Rush sees Vance is still moving… Rush storms back into the ring, for BULL’S HORNS!! Vance sputters but Rush goes looking under the ring. Rush finds his favorite camera cables, but the ref stops him! More refs hurry out here before this gets any worse! Rush tells Callis that this is what he wanted, so it’s time for Rush to get what he wants! Will Rush soon be El Campeon de AEW?\n\nJack Perry watches back tape.\n\nSpecifically, Darby setting him on fire at Double or Nothing, and Darby wanting to set him on fire at Blood & Guts. “Everything in life has a price. The question is how much you’re willing to sacrifice for it.” Darby was TNT Champion, and he wants to be TNT Champion again. There is footage of other TNT Champions in the mix, such as Adam Copeland, Samoa Joe, Sammy Guevara and Scorpio Sky. “Those who shape the future carry the burden of destroying the past.” Jack SMASHES the screens with a fire ax! And only The Scapegoat remains. Will he make sure that’s how it is after All In?\n\nAEW World Championship Eliminator Open Challenge: Swerve Strickland w/ Prince Nana VS ???\n\nFirstly, The Realest has Bryan Danielson to prepare for at All In. Secondly, he’s going to face Wheeler Yuta this Wednesday on Dynamite as part of that preparation. So then, is this just the champ getting ready to show off? Or is he about to regret gambling before going All In?\n\nSwerve gets a mic to ask Arlington, Texas, “What’s going on?” The fans cheer and chant, “Whose House?” “SWERVE’S HOUSE!” Swerve says they could not honestly think they’d have the All In Summer Series at the Esports Stadium without THE AEW World Champion showing up. Two weeks from now, the main event of All In London will be Swerve Strickland VS Bryan Danielson. And in those two weeks, Swerve owns Bryan’s legacy. Until then, time for a warm up! Until then, Swerve gives this Open Challenge. So to whoever is coming out here, just understand, you’re stepping into Whose House? SWERVE’S HOUSE!\n\nPrince Nana says you heard The Boss speak. Swerve is not a man to be played with! So then, ladies and gentlemen, whoever they’re sending out, Nana hopes they know they’re facing the most dangerous man in AEW. Wait, Tomohiro Ishii!? This is no longer just a “warm up!” Is the Stone Pitbull about to make Swerve’s House into his dog house?\n\nThe bell rings, the fans rally up and the two step up. They tie up, Ishii headlocks, Swerve powers up and out. Ishii RAMS Swerve, but Swerve and Ishii each bob ‘n’ weave, block and duck! Swerve avoids the enzigiri but Ishii avoids a Penalty Kick, and the fans fire up as the two stand off! Swerve and Ishii reset, tie up, and Swerve headlocks.

Swerve BODY SHOTS Ishii first, then steps in to SHOTGUN! The fans fire up as Swerve stands tall.\n\nSwerve storms over to Ishii, covers, TWO! Ishii’s tougher than that, but Swerve drags Ishii into a chinlock. The fans rally, even bark, as Ishii fights up. Ishii pries the hold open but Swerve clamps it on tighter.

Swerve says these are all just appetizers, but will he still have room for the full course at All In?\n\nClaudio Castagnoli speaks.\n\nThe Swiss Superman reviews how he, Claudio Castagnoli, won the Continental Collision to become contender to the Continental Championship that was introduced in the Continental Classic. Now that may come off as a tongue twister for most, but don’t get it twisted. Claudio wants that gold before we do another “C2” later this year. And Claudio has a great idea for a place and a time. How about the first-ever Dynamite IN Europe? Continental Championship combat in Cardiff! If that was too fast for Okada to keep up, don’t worry. Claudio will see him this Wednesday on Dynamite.\n\nLexy Nair is in the ring.\n\n“Ladies and gentlemen, please welcome my guests at this time, Kris Statlander & Stokely Hathaway.” Stokely says get on your feet because every night is #StaturdayNight! Big Stoke & The Galaxy’s Greatest Traitor make their way to the ring. Lexy brings up the ongoing issues between them and Willow Nightingale. Last night on Rampage, Willow spoke about these issues with Renee Paquette, and how to resolve them. We watch a quick clip from that, and Willow found out that Ishii isn’t much for Stokely. Willow implied she has an idea, so BREAKING NEWS! It will be Willow & Ishii VS Kris and- Stoke stops Lexy their, he knows exactly what this “idea” is!\n\nStokely wants to just say that it is tacky, reprehensible, and disgusting that Willow needs some “short, bald guy” following her around to do her bidding! Stoke & Kris are from New York, they have all the connections they need! As far as a tag partner goes, they can go to The Bronx to get a partner! They can go to the dojos in Harlem to get Kris a partner! They can- Lexy has Stokely hold on. In this specific match, there is a specific partner in mind: Stokely himself. The fans like the sound of that! Stokely looks to Kris with concern, and then he laughs. People say he’s funny, but that’s funny. Stokely says there’s no way, and Kris says, “that we’re gonna pass this up.”\n\nKris ACCEPTS the challenge! Stokely isn’t sure this is going to work out, but will he finally pay for everything he’s done in tearing apart the friendship of Willow and Kris?\n\nBackstage interview with Top Flight.\n\nLexy Nair is now with Action Andretti, Dante & Darius Martin, and the “Top Flight Attendant,” Leila Grey. She brings up that The MXM Collection have requested time to speak with them, yet Lexy isn’t sure where Mansoor & Mason Madden are. Leila points out that they’re right over there. Pan over, and MXM rises up from the ground, to pose! Mansoor & Mason were here the entire time. But to take it from the top gun, they’ll speak from the soul plane. Because they don’t wanna be a couple of snakes on a plane, they are just going to say they’re sorry. Sorry that they didn’t make more fun of their stupid haircuts! HAHAHAHAHA!\n\nWho is their barber? Helen Keller? HAHAHAHAHA! Action says ENOUGH. Top Flight is done watching the Maximum Male Barbies speak this nonsense! Talk is cheap, like that chain. And isn’t Mansoor a little short to be a model? So how about MXM walks down that runway to meet them in the ring tonight? They’d love to, but Mansoor broke a nail, he is not cosmetically cleared to compete! Is he ever? Mansoor & Mason are flustered, so this interview is over! Lio Rush steps in to say hold on, he has a question. MXM flies together a lot, but who gets the middle seat? Mansoor or “Stretch?” STRETCH!? No, he’s tight! Really tight!\n\nLio asks them to read this message. It says, “Hey, Lio. It’s TK. Tell the guys when you see them, it’s Top Flight VS MXM Collection next week on Collision.” Now that is tight. MXM storms off, to then “go down the elevator.” Well, will Mansoor & Mason make sure next week’s Collision is stylish and sophisticated? Or will they just get a one class ticket to another loss?\n\nHikaru Shida VS Aleah James!\n\nThe Shining Samurai is fighting her way back up towards championship opportunities, and she isn’t about to stop now. Will Shida carve a path right back to the title scene? Or will little Discocita from Essex have quite the debut?\n\nThe bell rings, the two tie up, and Shida powers Aleah right to ropes. The ref counts, Shida lets off, and the fans rally behind her. Aleah comes back, they tie up again. and go around. Shida puts Aleah in a corner, lets off, and brushes herself off. Aleah runs up, gets around, and fires forearms! Aleah whips, Shida reverses but Aleah reverses back. Shida goes up and MISSILE DROPKICKS! Then Shida fires up to waistlock and GERMAN SUPLEX! Shida holds on, rolls Aleah, and has the ARMBAR! Aleah stacks Shida but Shida slips around to gator roll, roll back, GUILLOTINE! Aleah endures so Shida BUZZSAWS! Cover, TWO!!\n\nAleah survives, but Shida doesn’t let off! Shida suplexes but Aleah fights free to RANA! Aleah runs, but into a JUMP KNEE! Shida hauls Aleah up to FALCON ARROW! Cover, Shida wins!\n\nWinner: Hikaru Shida, by pinfall\n\nThe Shining Samurai did the deal and that’s another one in the win column! But who will Shida be aiming for after All In?\n\nJim Ross has a sit-down interview with Bryan Danielson.\n\nJust as he did with Swerve, Good ol’ JR is now with The American Dragon. And JR asks Bryan how he counts his success and assesses his journey. Bryan says it has been quite incredible. When JR signed Bryan to the WWE roughly 24 years ago, and the contract had their names at the bottom of it, that was wild. That was the most mind-blowing thing. And now, 2024, Bryan is ending his career, and it is just an honor to be here with JR. Looking back, it just feels like there are these moments that he’ll never quite understand. How’d he get so lucky to do these things with these great people? Just blessings all over.\n\nJR does acknowledge Bryan’s body has been failing slowly over these 24 years. What does Bryan think of when it comes to that? From neck to arms to knees. Bryan mostly worries about his neck and the concussions. Those are the things he really has to worry about. But he also thinks about how his body has served him well. He’s put it through a lot. A lot of wrestlers who have wrestled for a long period of time, they didn’t do the crazy stuff Bryan did just to get noticed on the indies. And he sure got noticed. Looking back, Bryan wonders what he was thinking, but he knows those were things he had to do.\n\nSo looking back, and even how he feels now, he’ll need neck surgery before the end of this year. That is just the reality of it. It is something he has accepted. It is coming down the pipe. Then is he prepared to do what it’ll take to win against a hungry, driven champion? A wrestler always thinks they are. Bryan has had four chances before to win the world title, and if you had asked him each time if he was ready, he would’ve said yes. And then each time, Bryan failed. But each time he failed, he learned something about himself. So now, despite being 25 years in, Bryan is the best mentally he has ever been.\n\nIf you have to ask Bryan what it is going to be the difference maker, it is that Bryan is the mentally strongest he’s ever been, and that will pull him through. Is The American Dragon ready in mind, body and spirit for not just his biggest but his last opportunity to become AEW World Champion?\n\nBackstage interview with Hikaru Shida.\n\nLexy congratulates her on her win tonight, and says she wanted this time to speak. Shida says the last time she spoke with Lexy, it was after facing Britt Baker. Britt got that win on Dynamite. Shida congrats Britt, because they’re now 2-2. One day, they’ll settle the score. So for now, Shida NEEDS real competition, and a chance to go to Wembley. And the last chance is… MERCEDES MONE. Mone says Britt is the first but not the best? Yeah, that’s true. SHIDA is the best! Shida is a THREE-TIME Women’s’ World Champion, the longest reigning AEW Women’s World Champion ever, and the Ace of AEW!\n\nSo CEO, put that title on the line this Wednesday, and after Shida takes that title, then it will be her and Britt at Wembley. The Shining Samurai is willing to go All In, but will she be right on the money with this gamble?\n\nAEW World Trios Championships #1 Contenders Match, Special Guest Referee Christian Cage: The Bang Bang Gang VS The House of Black!\n\nCaptain Charisma said it last week that this is quite the conundrum. Juice Robinson & The Gunns were AEW World Trios Champions, so they are owed a rematch. But now that Buddy Matthews is back, he, Brody King & Malakai Black want to reestablish their status as contenders. So like the “good father” he is, Christian is taking charge! He has a ref stripe turtleneck for the occasion, but will he be completely and absolutely unbiased towards these teams?\n\nThe trios sort out and Juice starts against Brody. The bell rings, the two circle, and they tie up. Brody puts Juice against ropes, then in a corner. Christian counts the break, Brody lets off, but then Juice headlocks. Brody powers up and out, then he RAMS Juice down! Brody barks, Juice shoves, so Brody shoves back! Austin tags in, but everyone steps in! Christian steps between them all and he actually is being a fair authority. Bang Bang Gang cools off, as does The House, and Malakai tags in. Malakai and Austin circle, feel things out, and tie up. Malakai wrenches Austin, wristlocks, then headlocks.\n\nAustin powers up and out, Malakai rolls to kick, but Austin blocks! Malakai BOOTS, Austin rebounds, ducks ‘n dodges to get a leg, but Malakai wrenches free. Tag to Buddy and he goes up top, to DOUBLE STOMP Austin’s arm! The fans cheer, and Buddy stares Christian down. After all, it was The Patriarchy who jumped Buddy and sidelined him. But Christian reminds Buddy that right now, he’s the ref, they can’t touch him. Buddy still gets right in Christian’s face, but Brody has Buddy back away. Juice calls to Christian because Bang Bang Gang wants a tag. Colten tags in, then he rolls Buddy, ONE!\n\nBuddy rolls Colten, TWO! A faster count, but still not enough. Buddy hits a headlock takeover, Colten headscissors and Buddy kips free. Colten sweeps, covers, ONE! Buddy sweeps and covers, ONE! The fans cheer and Collision goes picture in picture.\n\nBuddy and Colten circle, tie up with knuckle locks, then Buddy shoots around to waistlock. Colten switches, goes to ropes, but Buddy bucks the O’Conner Roll. Buddy TOSSES Colten, BOOTS him, then runs, only for Juice to be in the way. Christian reprimands, Colten returns, but Buddy DUMPS him out! And then AX HANDLES to the floor! Buddy stares down Juice & Austin, then goes back for Colten. Buddy wrenches to CHOP! The fans are torn, but Buddy puts Colten back in the ring. Buddy goes up the corner, but Austin distracts him! Christian reprimands Austin but Colten SHOVES Buddy down! Buddy hits railing, Austin tags in!\n\nAustin drags Buddy up, and brings him around to whip hard into railing! Austin fires up, drags Buddy back into the ring, and then tags Juice. Bang Bang Gang mugs Buddy, then Juice snap suplexes Buddy, and Collision goes to break.\n\nCollision returns and Juice turns Buddy for a NECKBREAKER! The fans chant for “TURTLENECKS! TURTLENECKS!” Juice covers, ONE! Juice complains Christian wasn’t fast enough, and he tags in Colten. Bang Bang Gang mugs Buddy, then Austin tags in. Austin tags Juice back in, Colten whips Austin in to forearm SMASH! Juice sends Colten in to STINGER SPLASH! Then the Gunns feed Buddy to a LEG LARIAT! Juice covers, TWO! Juice is annoyed, but he drags Buddy up by an ear. Buddy pulls hair! Christian reprimands them both, but doesn’t do much more than that. Juice then HEADBUTTS Buddy down!\n\nJuice runs to STRADDLE ATTACK Buddy on the ropes! The fans fire up for #RockHardRobinson, and he CHOKES Buddy on ropes! Christian counts fast, and Juice lets off at 4. The fans rally, Juice drags Buddy around, and “pees” like a dog! The fans are torn but The House is pissed. Christian has them stay back, Buddy fights back against Bang Bang Gang! Buddy DUMPS Juice, ELBOWS Austin, BOOTS Juice then KNEES Colten! The fans fire up as Buddy crawls for the corner! But The Gunns are back! Christian stops them, but he misses the tag! The fans boo but Christian warns Brody to back down!\n\nThe Bang Bang Gang mugs Buddy, the fans chant “REF YOU SUCK!” Juice sends Colten in but Buddy TOSSES him! Juice tires but Buddy DUMPS him! Buddy BOOTS Austin, ELBOWS the others, but Austin keeps Buddy from the corner! Austin whips Buddy to the corner, runs in, but only gets buckles! Buddy crawls, but Austin runs to intercept! Only for Buddy to POP-PU KNEE! The path is clear, hot tag to Malakai! The fans fire up as The DARK Father is in, and The Bang Bang Gang narrowly avoids The End! Malakai dodges Colten, BOOTS Juice, then ELBOWS Colten. Juice runs up, Malakai fires off a strike fest, and sweeps the leg!\n\nColten whips, Malakai goes up the corner to KNEE Colten down! Malakai goes up and out, tags Brody, then MOONSAULTS Juice! Then QUEBRADA for Austin! Malakai whips Austin to a corner, Brody runs to SPLASH! Austin flops down, the fans bark it up, and The House of Black takes corners. Juice saves Austin, but then Brody DIVES onto the whole gang!! The fans are thunderous and Brody says “The House Always Wins!” Christian tries to restore order while Collision goes picture in picture.\n\nBrody stalks back out there to stand Colten up. Brody CHOPS Colten, then he does the same to Austin! Buddy fetches Juice to RAM him into railing! Christian tells them to get this in the ring, but Brody grabs a chair! Christian reprimands Brody, but Buddy THROWS Juice back into railing! Brody fires knees on COlten and sits him down next to Austin. Buddy ROCKS Juice, Malakai & Brody mug The Gunns, and now the whole gang is together in the corner. The fans rally as The House lines up the shot. Brody TRIPLE CROSSBODIES Bang Bang Gang against the railing!! The fans love it, and Brody drags Austin from the pile.\n\nBrody CHOPS Austin, puts him in the ring, and then storms in. Brody TOSSESS Austin right back out! Austin is down on the ground, but Brody goes out to fetch him again. Collision returns to single picture, and Brody puts Austin in. Brody drags Austin up, CHOSP him again, then whips him to the corner. Austin BLASTS The House! The fans rally, Austin dodges Brody to hot tag Colten! Tag to Juice, and Juice JABS away on Brody!

Austin has Buddy in ropes, DRAPING FAMOUSER! But THE END hits Austin! Colten runs up, spins Malakai, COLT 45!! But Brody is there! Colten dodges once, but not the BLACK HOLE SLAM on the return! Juice has Brody, JUICE IS LOOSE! But the METEORA takes Juice down! All six men are down so Christian starts a standing count! The fans are thunderous, and we’re already at 5 of 10!\n\nThe count is going pretty quick, but Buddy stands at 9! SPEAR from Christian!!! And he says that’s TEN! So count it out!!\n\nDouble TKO\n\nOh well NOW Christian screws everyone over! And here comes The Patriarchy! Nick Wayne & Killswitch-Luchasaurus beat down all six men with CHAIRS! As does Christian!

He wants to reinjure Buddy, he SMASHES the leg with a chair!\n\nThe fans boo as Luchasaurus drags Colten up, CHOKE SLAM onto a chair! Christian has his “sons” stand Malakai up, and they bring him around for the chicken wings. FULL METAL KILLSWITCH!!! The AEW World Trios Champions stand tall above their competition, but surely someone in AEW management will fix this miscarriage of justice! Or will The Patriarchy always get their way?\n\nMy Thoughts:\n\nA great Collision, and while talky as usual, we did get some great stuff set up for All In. After Ishii gives Swerve a great match tonight, they were very quick to officially booking Ishii & Willow VS Stokely & Statlander in a Mixed Tag for All In’s Zero Hour. And a good promo from Claudio to not just hype up the face-to-face with Okada, but to set up a title match for Dynamite in Cardiff. Not for All In because All In is already shoved full of stuff, but for the go-home episode. It’s like Claudio understands that AEW PPVs need to trim down a bit. But he also kinda brushed over how the Continental Classic is returning later this year, though I suppose what else was going to happen?\n\nSpeaking of Swerve, Bryan gets to have his interview to parallel Dynamite. The interview doesn’t add much, other than that it is wild to think Bryan’s been active since 2000. And they did kind of bury the lead that win, lose or draw, Bryan’s going to need neck surgery and that alone would basically put an end to Bryan’s wrestling career. Swerve has momentum going into Dynamite, and he’ll certainly win against Yuta, but I’m not sure what Bryan is to do in the last couple of weeks. I suppose Swerve defying go-home math wouldn’t be the worst thing, though. With everything planned past All In, it still makes sense if it is Swerve VS Darby at Grand Slam.\n\nDarby and Hologram got a great win off The Premier Athletes, and I like Hologram’s updated ring gear. The silver they used in his first gear just came off as bland grey, so now he wears black and white with green trim, a much better look. I appreciate they replayed Jack Perry’s promo from Dynamite minus the Taco Bell interruption, not that it changed anything. Outrunners had a goofy video that was made to be very 1980s, though it should’ve been 4:3 ratio to match. Great showing from The Outrunners against FTR, but of course FTR won. Though, them just dropping the news of AEW World Tag Team Championships on Dynamite, that’s a big move to do.\n\nAt the same time, them shying away from Acclaimed VS FTR at this time is disappointing. Make that the match for next Wednesday, winner goes to All In to face Bucks, the loser waits until All Out or something. Because duh, how is that not obvious to TK? Though it seems he can “text” Lio Rush to announce Top Flight VS MXM, another obvious move. Hilarious promo from them all, though, and that match will be great stuff. But then there’s also the odd move of Shida challenging Mone for the TBS Championship, which we know she isn’t winning. Not sure the point other than to give Mone momentum to face Britt.\n\nGreat Texas Bull Rope Match, includin"
