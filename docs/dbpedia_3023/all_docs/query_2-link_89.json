        "text": "Chapter Text\n\nThere’s a crow outside Chigiri Hyouma’s window.\n\nIn and of itself, this is not necessarily out of the ordinary. Hyouma has a bird feeder on his back porch, enchanted to keep away predators and any other would-be thieves. It’s not uncommon for the starlings and thrushes to flutter around his house after feeding, and since Hyouma doesn’t bother them, some of them have gotten downright friendly. Last spring, there was a little grey-and-white starling that ate seeds right out of his palm on a couple of occasions.\n\nBut this is different. It’s not the first crow Hyouma has ever seen in his life—they’re relatively common familiars for certain types of witches—but it’s certainly the first one he’s seen around these parts, and totally unaccompanied. Definitely not an ordinary occurrence.\n\nHe first spotted it about half an hour ago, a flash of black feathers outside the window catching his attention. The feeder, an intricate little thing carved by Kunigami as a housewarming gift, is all but centered in his main window, giving Hyouma an excellent view of all the comings and goings of the birds in his yard. Which means he’d immediately noticed when the crow landed on the perch and stuck its beak inside, large talons wrapped awkwardly around the smallish perch. Before long, it finished its meal and came over to settle right by the window, where it’s been ever since.\n\nAdmittedly, he’d been a little worried. Concern for the safety of his other birds had taken priority. But a quick online search informed him that while it is possible for crows to prey on other birds’ nests, it isn’t as common as a lot of people think. Most of what he read indicated that crows are intelligent, social, and even likely to befriend humans that feed them; no wonder they’re such popular familiars, then. And befriending a crow significantly reduces the likelihood of it going after the other birds.\n\nSo apparently Hyouma has to make a new friend.\n\nGreat.\n\nIt’s not like he has anything against the idea. Or even against crows specifically—they’re perfectly fine birds. If it had eaten some of the food and then left, he wouldn’t be bothered. But it’s just sitting outside his window, like it’s watching him, and frankly, it’s making it difficult to focus on his work.\n\nMaybe if he ignores it, it’ll go away.\n\nTen minutes pass. Every time Hyouma glances up from the spell he’s weaving, the crow is still there.\n\nGlaring at it seems to have no effect.\n\nAnother five minutes go by. What should be an average, run-of-the-mill protection charm—a spell Hyouma must have perfected nearly a decade ago, when he was sixteen and still a bright-eyed novice—has taken twice as long as it should’ve, because that damn bird is still there.\n\nAfter another five minutes, the spell is finally done. The crow is still sitting there, preening its feathers without a care in the world.\n\nHyouma has had enough.\n\nScowling fiercely, he storms over to the window and flings it open with enough vehemence that the crow hops back with a faint, startled squawk.\n\n“What do you want,” Hyouma grits out.\n\nThe crow tilts its head at him, dark eyes twinkling as if it’s laughing.\n\nA sudden, awful thought occurs to him. “You’re not some kind of spy, are you?” he demands, leaning down to look more closely at the crow, as if he’ll get better answers that way. “Did somebody send you? Who was it? The Wanimas? Zantetsu?” Well, that one’s probably a reach, but he has to ask.\n\nPredictably, the crow does not answer him verbally. But Hyouma is fairly sure it understood him. It lets out a short caw, then cocks its head the other way, ruffling its glossy feathers in a way that somehow manages to read pretty clearly as disdain. Almost like it’s saying, A spy? Seriously? What kind of bird do you take me for?\n\nHyouma’s lips twitch. Determined not to smile, he presses them together, channeling his expression into a stern glare. “Well, whatever you’re hanging around here for, you’re not going to get it. So shoo. Can’t you see that I’m busy?”\n\nThe crow stares at him.\n\n“Go on, get out of here,” Hyouma insists, flapping his hands at it—not trying to scare it, just trying to get the message across. “You can come back for more food tomorrow.”\n\nApparently satisfied by this, the crow caws at him again, then spreads its wings, lifting into the air with a mighty flap that stirs the hair around Hyouma’s face. Leaning against the windowsill, he watches it climb higher and higher into the sky, until it's little more than a black speck amidst the endless blue. The breeze blowing in from outside is chilly enough that Hyouma shivers lightly; autumn is moving fast, and winter will be upon him before long.\n\nOnly when he can’t see that speck of black anymore does Hyouma step back and close the window. The crow is gone, but for whatever reason, Hyouma has a sneaking suspicion that he hasn’t seen the last of it. Something about that bird feels like trouble.\n\nHyouma just hopes it isn’t the bad kind.\n\nKarasu Tabito is a crow.\n\nWell, that’s not entirely accurate. Sometimes Karasu Tabito is a crow. The rest of the time, he’s just an ordinary guy. A guy that kinda looks like a bird, maybe, but a guy nonetheless. If it weren’t for the fact that he needs to spend at least four days a month with feathers and a beak and talons, he’d be a perfectly normal human. But, well, here he is.\n\nBeing a crow ain’t all bad, honestly. Flying is pretty sweet, and Tabito thinks he makes a damn handsome bird, if he says so himself. He does miss having thumbs, though.\n\nWhen he isn’t a crow, Tabito works a variety of odd jobs that keep him almost constantly on the move. There’s only so much he can do, given that he’s not one of those lucky few that are blessed with the ability to use magic, but he likes to keep busy. Likes to meet new people, really. People-watching is a bit of a hobby of Tabito’s, and it’s lucky for him that there are so many interesting people around this city.\n\nHis favorite job, though, is the one he started just a couple of months ago. It was presented to him as a simple delivery job—once a week, he’d drive out to pick up packages from a witch who lived on the outskirts of town, a guy called Chigiri Hyouma. Apparently, this Chigiri rarely left home, but he ran a small business doing hand-crafted spells on commission, and he needed someone to deliver his packages to the post office in town.\n\nTabito had admittedly been a little skeptical at first. “Y’sure about this? What if I get murdered or somethin’? Ya gonna take responsibility if I die alone in the woods?”\n\nIsagi, the friend who’d offered Tabito the job, gave him a long-suffering look. “You’re not gonna get murdered, Karasu,” he said. “Chigiri isn’t a bad person. He’s just… slow to trust people.”\n\nWell, Tabito could definitely relate to that. “Alright, fine. Might as well give it a shot,” he said, and grinned at Isagi. “Wanna give me this guy’s address?”\n\nTrue to Isagi’s word, Chigiri doesn’t seem like a bad person at all. He’s quiet, withdrawn—he barely said two words to Tabito the first time they met, depositing the packages in his hands along with a wad of cash for his trouble and then disappearing back into his house. And that pattern had continued for a while. The way he eyed Tabito warily through the half-open door reminded Tabito of a street cat, ears flat and tail swishing, hiding under a dumpster and refusing to come out until you walk past.\n\nIt’s all well and good with Tabito—he doesn’t need to have a conversation with the guy—but there’s one part that Isagi conveniently forgot to mention.\n\nChigiri is the most gorgeous person Tabito has ever seen.\n\nNow, Tabito’s no stranger to these types of crushes. Chigiri is hardly the first unattainable person to catch his interest; he still remembers his very first crush, the cutest girl in his class, kind and pretty and so far out of his ordinary-guy league that it was laughable. Tabito’s got a type, it seems: beautiful, exceptional, and with about a zero percent chance of ever liking him back. They usually tend to pass pretty quickly, once Tabito gets his brain and his heart on the same page.\n\nBut. Well. Maybe it’s just Tabito’s curiosity, the analytical part of his brain that he’s never quite been able to turn off, but there’s just something different about Chigiri Hyouma. Thoughts of him won’t leave Tabito alone, circling round and round in his mind like downy feathers caught in the wind. On occasion, when he drops by for his weekly delivery pickup, he gets a glimpse of Chigiri sitting in the window, gazing out at the sky with such a wistful expression that Tabito can’t help but feel a little pang in his chest.\n\nThat image sticks with him. Makes him wonder. He doesn’t want to think of Chigiri as nothing more than a puzzle to solve, but there’s undeniably something mysterious about him that Tabito finds… appealing. Intriguing.\n\n“Just ask him out, dude,” Otoya says around a mouthful of rice. “What’s the worst that could happen?”\n\n“Oh, I dunno,” Tabito drawls. “He could fire me. He could turn me into a lizard. He could curse my entire bloodline. Ya want me t’keep goin’?”\n\nNot that he thinks Chigiri would actually do most of those things. He doesn’t seem like the bloodline-cursing type. But he’d be well within his rights to fire Tabito, and Tabito doesn’t want that. He’s got other jobs, sure, but he likes working for Chigiri. And not just because he, uh, likes Chigiri.\n\nOtoya, on the other hand, seems to believe every word, which is kind of hilarious. He shudders. “You really think he’d curse you just for asking him on a date? Witches are fucking scary, bro.”\n\n“Hiori’s a witch,” Tabito points out.\n\n“I said what I said. I’m telling you, there’s a sadist behind that cute little face.” Otoya shoves another bite of chazuke into his mouth. Then he keeps talking, but whatever he’s trying to say is completely indecipherable.\n\nTabito smacks him over the head. “Quit talkin’ with yer mouth full, ya dunce. I can’t understand ya.”\n\n“Ow!” Otoya whines—he’s such a wuss, Tabito didn’t hit him that hard—and rubs the back of his head, choking down his mouthful of food. “Geez. I was just saying that maybe you should try getting closer to him slowly. Get to know him a little better, see if he’s open to being friends first, and then make your move.” He brightens. “Maybe you could even get him a present or something. Everyone likes presents, right?”\n\nHuh. That’s surprisingly not the worst advice in the world. Tabito squints at him. “Who are ya and what have ya done with Otoya?”\n\nOtoya sits up straighter. “Hey, c’mon, what’s that supposed to mean? You think I can’t give good dating advice?”\n\n“With yer track record?” Tabito snorts. “Hell no.”\n\nBlowing out a heavy breath, Otoya shakes his head. “That’s cold, Karasu. Real cold. You know what, I take it back, maybe you do deserve to be cursed—ow! Dude! Stop hitting me, I’m sensitive!”\n\nOtoya’s a dumbass, but he’s Tabito’s best friend. And it really is decent advice. It’s just a matter of putting it into practice.\n\nThat’s easier said than done, though. He’s been running deliveries for Chigiri for a couple months now, and it’s still tough to get him to actually engage in conversation. The red-haired witch just seems wary to a fault. Either that, or he just doesn’t like Tabito, which—he can’t entirely rule out that possibility, but Tabito considers himself to be good at reading people, and he doesn’t think it’s anything personal. Probably.\n\n“So, Red,” Tabito says one day, as Chigiri is handing off the packages to him. “What kinda spells’re ya sellin’, anyways?”\n\nChigiri just sort of blinks at him. Not startled, exactly, but a little taken aback by the question. Then his eyes narrow. “Why do you want to know?”\n\nTabito shrugs, hefting the boxes in his arms a little. “Been doin’ this for ya for a while. Figured it was about time I asked ya ‘bout it.”\n\nThat answer doesn’t seem to impress Chigiri. One perfectly trimmed brow arches, devastatingly slow. “So you took this job without even knowing what kind of packages you were delivering?” His head tips a few degrees to one side. “Were you desperate for money, or are you just stupid?”\n\nWell, now Tabito’s the one who’s taken aback. “I. Uh. Neither?”\n\nChigiri regards him coolly. “Neither,” he echoes.\n\nIt takes a lot to make Tabito feel stupid, but boy, is he feeling it now. “I-I mean, I know ya take commissions for charms n’shit,” he stammers. “Isagi told me that much. I took the job ‘cause he said ya needed the help, and I had the time to spare.” Also because he’d sort of owed Isagi a favor, but that’s a long story that he doesn’t particularly feel like telling.\n\nThere is a pause, one that feels a lot longer than it probably is, in which Tabito can feel himself starting to sweat. Chigiri’s unimpressed look doesn’t waver. In fact, it only seems to have grown sharper.\n\n“Well, let me set the record straight,” Chigiri says at last. Without breaking eye contact, he picks up another box and stacks it on top of the ones already in Tabito’s arms, setting it down with enough force to make Tabito wobble a bit. “I appreciate your help, but I don’t need it. I managed just fine before you came along, and I’d be just fine without you again. And,” he leans in and drops his voice, enunciating every word clearly, “I am capable of far more than just ‘charms and shit’.”\n\nThen he places Tabito’s payment on top of the box, steps back into his house, and shuts the door in his face.\n\nTabito stands there, stunned silent, arms straining from the weight of the packages in his hands. His face feels hot, his heart is slamming against his ribs, and his stomach churns with butterflies.\n\nShit. Tabito is completely fucking smitten.\n\nOkay, so winning Chigiri over is going to take a little patience. That’s fine. Tabito can be patient, when he chooses to. If Chigiri needs some time to warm up to the idea of being friends—or more—with Tabito, he’ll give him that. And if he doesn’t end up wanting anything in the end? That’s fine, too.\n\nEven if Tabito can’t stop thinking about that wistful loneliness he sees on Chigiri’s face when he sits in the window. Even if he can’t stop thinking about wanting to make him smile. Tabito might be an asshole, but he’s still respectful, dammit. He doesn’t want to make Chigiri uncomfortable.\n\nWhat happens next is a total coincidence.\n\nTechnically, Tabito’s required “bird days” can be anytime during the month. He could knock out all four in a row right at the beginning, if he wanted. But he prefers to keep things to a consistent schedule; the first and third Monday and the second and fourth Wednesday of each month are his designated days, and if at all possible, he doesn’t stray from them. It might not seem like a big deal, but having some kind of control over his transformation—this undeniable aspect of his life that he never really asked for in the first place—is important to him.\n\nAnd again, it ain’t all bad. It’s kinda nice to just relax and fly around. Tabito sees it as a chance to explore and get a new perspective on the world. Plus, it’s a great opportunity for people-watching.\n\nOn that particular second Wednesday of the month, he doesn’t have a particular destination in mind when he takes to the skies. It’s a clear, crisp morning, a bit chilly for late autumn despite the lack of any clouds, but Tabito’s flapping along steadily, feathers keeping him nice and warm. Zoning out and letting the wind take him wherever it wants is easy, which means he doesn’t really notice that he’s flying out near a familiar area until he’s almost directly above Chigiri’s house.\n\nHuh. Truth be told, he’s never even thought about visiting Chigiri like this. But surely it can’t do any harm. The possibility of actually revealing his secret has never crossed Tabito’s mind—the fewer people that know, the better, in his eyes—but just dropping by and seeing how he’s doing can’t hurt, right?\n\nPlus, Tabito is pretty sure Chigiri likes birds. There’s a beautiful little bird feeder in his front yard, right in view of that window Tabito has seen him sitting at. Maybe he’ll be more partial to Tabito in this form.\n\nAlmost immediately after landing, though, he encounters a bit of an issue. He’s never exactly used a bird feeder before. And while it’s a pretty intuitive process—sit on perch, stick beak in hole, get seeds—he quickly finds that it makes him feel very undignified. Plus, the feeder doesn’t really seem made for a bird his size, based on how awkwardly small the perch feels under his talons.\n\nIt’s kind of demeaning, honestly. Come on, Tabito, you’re better than this. Even if the seeds are yummy.\n\nTime to change tactics.\n\nThis is how Tabito ends up sitting directly outside Chigiri’s window, waiting for the witch to notice him. Or, well, to actually acknowledge him. He’s definitely been noticed, if Chigiri’s occasional glares are anything to go by, but so far, Chigiri seems to be more focused on his work than on the crow outside his window. But Tabito has nowhere else to be, so he settles in, preening his feathers a bit, but mostly observing.\n\nWatching Chigiri work is enchanting. Tabito finds himself cataloging everything he can about Chigiri: the quick, precise movements of his elegant fingers, the concentrated furrow to his brow, the glow of his irises casting a delicate pink-red light on his cheeks as he uses his magic. Plenty of mages and spell-weavers describe their work as a craft, but Chigiri truly looks like he’s creating art. Even if he does look kind of annoyed.\n\nThe inside of his place looks pretty nice, too, from what Tabito can see. Lived-in. There’s a crocheted afghan in bright colors draped over an armchair and a teacup with a chipped edge on the table beside Chigiri where he’s working. Deeper into the main room, he can make out a truly massive bookshelf on the back wall, stretching all the way up to the ceiling and practically overflowing with books.\n\nSo he’s a big reader, huh? Cute. Tabito wonders what kind of books he likes. He can picture Chigiri curled up in that armchair on a snowy day, that blanket draped over his shoulders, sipping tea and devouring chapter after chapter of his latest favorite novel. The image makes his chest feel kind of tight.\n\nHell, he’s a mess. He can practically hear Otoya in the back of his head telling him how “down bad” he is.\n\nDistracted by that thought, Tabito nearly misses the moment Chigiri gets up and storms toward the window, but he snaps back into focus just in time to see him approaching. Still, it startles him when Chigiri flings open the window far more aggressively than Tabito’s expecting.\n\n“What do you want,” Chigiri demands, like he’s actually expecting an answer. And, well, Tabito technically could try to respond verbally, but his vocabulary is pretty damn limited in this form. And it might freak Chigiri out if the crow outside his window randomly just started speaking Japanese. While it’s a little tempting to do it just to mess with him, Tabito ultimately decides against it. He just tilts his head at Chigiri, amused by his frustration.\n\nChigiri carries on, demanding to know if he’s a spy—even though Tabito doesn’t recognize either of the names he spouts off, it’s obvious Chigiri thinks he might be a rival witch’s familiar, or something along those lines. Tabito damn near scoffs at the implication, cawing and ruffling his feathers in a way that’s meant to clearly convey his annoyance with the idea. If he was a spy, would he really be this obvious about it?\n\nAt least Chigiri seems to get the message. He frowns at Tabito, flaps his hands at him and tells him to come back for more food tomorrow. Which isn’t going to happen, Tabito has his schedule, but the offer is appreciated. He does linger a bit at first, but even he can take a hint—he’s obviously distracting Chigiri from his work, and as much as he’s enjoying being a mild nuisance, he doesn’t want to actively piss Chigiri off. He wants Chigiri to actually like him, even if it’s only in this form.\n\nSo it’s with only a bit of reluctance that Tabito flies away, ascending once more into the blue, blue sky with a belly full of seeds and a plan to return next Monday."
