        "text": "This thread will be pretty much a grab bag of randomness. Reviews of matches from NJPWWorld, YouTube, WWE Network, etc. There's going to be some friggin weird pairings, hidden gems, lost classics, pre-show matches/squashes from 90s PPVs, you name it. With everything going on in the world (stay inside people, don't be assholes, seriously), I need to watch some wrestling to distract me a little bit. So hopefully some of these matches will make you seek them out or just start watching random matches as well. These will have no order whatsoever. ENJOY!\n\nHulk Hogan & Stan Hansen vs Bob Backlund & Antonio Inoki\n\nMadison Square Garden\n\nDecember 10, 1980\n\nHell yeah I’m watching some early Hogan in New Japan. Let’s see what The Hulkster had before he was The Hulkster! Hansen misses a clothesline & tumbles to the floor literally within seconds as he’s back in & the heels double team Inoki with Hogan trash talking Backlund in the process. Hogan grabs a headlock almost immediately, quickly tags out & hits a double clothesline for 2. The heels tag back & forth one more time before Inoki dives for a tag & here comes Backlund throwing dropkicks & bodyslams. Backlund using his speed to avoid the heels as he’s making Hogan look foolish, taking him down with leg sweeps. Both tag & we ultimately get a rowboat with the ref stumbling around in the middle as he restores order & Inoki works Hansen’s leg. Inoki avoids a dropkick, but Hansen rakes the eyes & tries for some nearfalls as Hogan comes back in & puts the boots to Inoki. Jumping knee & shoulder breaker gets Hogan 2 as Hogan follows with a hip toss & elbow drop for another 2. Inoki pops a dropkick & Backlund tags in & takes the fight to both heels again until Hansen takes over. Heels are making quick tags as Backlund is taking some punishment. I should point out the ref is leaping so high in the air every time he goes to count a pin it’s hilarious. Hogan gets a bear hug, Hansen gets a leg lock, all the wear down holds you’d expect until Backlund gets a piledriver & the hot tag to Inoki. He jumps off the top rope onto his feet, then delivers a dropkick, which was weird as Hansen murders Inoki with a lariat for 1…2…Backlund breaks it up. Hogan hits a running bodyslam on Inoki and the ref makes a count, but there was never a tag I don’t think as Inoki hits a backslide on Hogan for the 3! Honestly, 80% of this match was boring, but the other 20 I thought was good stuff. Hogan & Hansen were good heels, made quick tags, took some comedy bumps and then Inoki & Backlund got cheered loudly, but I just thought it took forever for Inoki to get the hot tag.\n\nScott Hall vs Hiroshi Tanahashi\n\nSeptember 9, 2001\n\nI should point out the video title on YouTube says “Scott Hall vs Japanese Young Boy” it didn’t say that the young boy was Hiroshi friggin Tanahashi! Hall absolutely towers over Tana, as he tosses the toothpick in his face & grabs the arm, paint brushing Tana like Hall does. Brutal corner chop before Hall hits a fall away slam & sinks in his abdominal stretch with the foot grabbed before transitioning into a STF. To the corner we go as Hall hits his back suplex & signals for the end. He drags Tana up & plants him with a Razor’s Edge but doesn’t cover him; instead he opts for the microphone & calls out Keiji Mutoh. He said if he ever steps in the ring with him, this will be him right as Tanahashi gets a school boy 1…2…3!!! I friggin’ love it! Squash match that Hall was too cocky with & ended up losing to the young boy, where have I heard that before?\n\nKeiji Mutoh (c) vs Scott Hall\n\nAJPW Triple Crown Championship\n\nSeptember 23, 2001\n\nMutoh slowly works the arm early, but Hall gets a rope break. Hall gets a cheap shot & punches away, misses a lariat & eats a dropkick before Mutoh gets a head lock take down. Hall gets Mutoh down, misses an elbow, but Mutoh hits a snap elbow of his own before settling back in with the headlock. Hall gets a slingshot back suplex off of the headlock as he applies a sleeper. Hall chucks Mutoh to the floor as Masa Chono stares him down, but doesn’t do anything. Hall to the floor & rams Mutoh into the railing before tossing him back in. Hall paintbrushes Mutoh & just slowly is beating him down. This match is insanely slow as Hall gets an abdominal stretch, that Mutoh gets out of & starts dropkicking the leg of Hall repeatedly. Dragon screw into the Figure Four by Mutoh until Hall gets the ropes. Mutoh wants a moonsault, but Hall stops him & connects with a corner back suplex for a 2 count. Chokeslam gets Hall another near fall, but Mutoh hits another dropkick to the leg to cut Hall off. Top rope moonsault connects for Mutoh 1…2…NO! Mutoh with a Shining Wizard, but Hall pops up first & hits a lariat as we have a double down. THE FIGHTING SPIRIT OF SCOTT HALL!! Corner chops & clothesline by Hall, who hits a fall away slam for 2. Hall signals for the end as he wants a Razor’s Edge, but Mutoh wiggles free & hits a heel kick & step up knee in the corner for 2. Shining Wizard glances Hall for the 1…2…3. Yeah, I didn’t care for this match. It didn’t suck, but it was just so slow & boring for a lot of it. I wasn’t expecting a sprint or anything, but I was just expecting a little more.\n\nWith WrestleMania this weekend, thought it'd be cool to check out the Undertaker before he became the Undertaker and when he was briefly in Japan.\n\nBam Bam Bigelow & Punisher Dice Morgan vs Masa Saito & Shinya Hashimoto\n\nMarch 2, 1990\n\nI needed to review this as young Taker teaming with Bigelow is something I never knew happened. Hashimoto & Bam Bam trade shoulder blocks until Bigelow gets sent to the floor with a big kick. Back inside here’s Taker, who throws right hands, but Hashimoto no sells & Taker spits at him and wants a test of strength. Taker wins that & slams Hashimoto down for 2. Hashimoto fires back with his signature spinning heel kick & DDT, then tags Saito, who chops away & hits a big back body drop. Boston Crab then applied to Taker, then in comes Hashimoto and they double team the legs as Taker is selling until he just throws a big boot to get free. Here comes Bigelow who hits Hashimoto with a stalling vertical suplex for 2! Rest hold by Bigelow already as Hashimoto quickly escapes & throws kicks, but Bammer backs away as Saito gets tagged, so he tags in Taker. Fucking VINTAGE UNDERTAKER as he connects with a leaping clothesline as he tags Bam Bam, who nails a dropkick for 2. Desperation Saito Suplex drops Bam Bam, but Saito follows with a super sloppy body slam that Bigelow didn’t go up for. Taker back in as he slams Saito & hits a leg drop for 2. Rest hold by Taker before tagging back in Bigelow, but that’s only briefly as Taker is back in & swinging with Saito. Bigelow trips Saito as Hashimoto & Taker brawl inside. Saito rolls back inside & Taker connects with a suplex & cover, but Hashimoto breaks it up. Bodyslam/Splash combo as Hashimoto takes Bigelow to the floor while Taker connects with a TOP ROPE ELBOW for the 1…2…3!!! Taker gets the pin and I tell you what, he looked fucking really good in this one, for being as young as he was in the business. Job well done Punisher Dice Morgan!\n\nPunisher Dice Morgan, Mike (Corp) Kirschner & Nord The Barbarian vs Masa Saito, Kengo Kimura & Osamu Kido\n\nMarch 5, 1990\n\nThe quality of the video I found was awful, so no screencap, but know that it's out there if you search for it. That said, the sheer randomness of the future Undertaker, future Berzerker & former Corporal Kirschner teaming is a match I couldn’t skip. Match begins with Nord fighting his way out of the babyface corner & tags in Morgan squares off with Saito. Morgan dares Saito for a test of strength, but Saito is too short so Morgan modifies & gets Saito down. Saito gets a tag to Kido, but Morgan tags in Kirschner, who just wears Kido down & chucks him outside so Nord & Morgan can beat him up. Nord is a mad man, who smacks Kido with chairs in the front row (he’s HUSSING like a son bitch) as Kirschner throws Kido back inside & suplexes him down. Back in comes Nord who hits a leg drop for just a 1 count. All Nord is doing is kicking away before hitting a back suplex for 2. Tag to Morgan as he & Nord hit the sloppiest double clotheslines you’ll ever see before Morgan hits his patented flying clothesline. Rocket Launcher using Kirschner misses as here comes Saito, who is a house of fire. Kimura brawls with Nord as Kido brawls with Morgan while Saito hits a Saito Suplex on Kirchner for the 3.\n\nShinya Hashimoto & Masa Saito (c) vs Punisher Dice Morgan & Big Scott Hall\n\nIWGP Tag Team Championship\n\nMarch 19, 1990\n\nFlying shoulder tackle by Morgan on Hashimoto, who fires back with a kick sending Morgan to the floor. Back inside, Morgan clubs away at Hashimoto before tagging Hall, who gets a leg drop off a Morgan drop toe hold as they use fast tags until Hashimoto gets an arm breaker on Morgan. Here comes Saito, who headbutts & clotheslines the shit out of Morgan before bodyslamming him down. Quick tags by the champs as they’re really focusing on the left leg of Morgan. Out of nowhere Morgan locks in a Claw before tagging Hall, who hits a RAZOR’S EDGE ON HASHIMOTO for 2! Holy shit! Hall then sinks in a Scorpion Death Lock before Saito chops him in the head. Morgan in with a gut wrench suplex & leg drop for 2 before going back to the Claw. Hall back in as they hit a double big boot, but send Hashimoto right into his corner. Saito in & takes the fight to Hall with backdrops & clotheslines, then a Saito suplex. Hashimoto back in & hits a running bodyslam & elbow drop for 2 as Hall tags Morgan, who tries for the Claw a third time, but Hashimoto has it scouted & tags in Saito, who in turn gets hit with the Claw. Morgan is all about The Claw in this one as he tags in Hall, who beats on Saito long enough for Saito to Hulk up briefly before Hall slaps on an abdominal stretch then tags back in Morgan. Flying clothesline hits perfect as Morgan gets 2. Hall in & puts a Boston Crab on Saito before he gets the ropes, he ducks a Hall clothesline & hits a Saito suplex for 2. Hashimoto gets in & punts Morgan in the chest & hits a spinning leg kick on Hall for 2, then hits a Superkick on Morgan sending him to the apron. Hashimoto drops Hall with a DDT, then a spinwheel kick for 1…2…3!! A little sloppy towards the end, but Hall & Taker did a really solid job in this. All things considered, this was a pretty darn fun tag match.\n\nRic Flair vs Lord Steven Regal (w/Sir William)\n\nThe Marquis of Queensbury Cup\n\nBefore Hulk Hogan came to WCW & steamrolled him for months (years?), Ric Flair found himself competing in a rare months worth of matches against Lord Steven Regal. The Marquis of Queensbury was inspired by World of Sport in the UK and featured five 5 minute rounds, one each week. If there wasn’t a winner in those 5 minutes, we went to the judges who were WCW official Jimmy Jett, Sgt. Craig Pittman (why, I don’t know, but this was a year before he started wrestling) and then Grizzly Smith/Terry Taylor/Pee Wee Anderson traded the third slot.\n\nRound 1\n\nApril 30, 1994\n\nRegal reluctantly gives Flair a handshake before getting a drop toe hold as Flair turns the tables with a takedown, a near fall, then applies a head scissors, which Regal escapes. Headlock takedown by Flair, Regal with a head scissors, but Flair headstands out of it & takes Regal down with another headlock. Flair works the arm as the crowd loudly chants USA as they trade small package attempts. Heenan & Tony on commentary don’t even know how to score this as Flair gets another near fall, then takes Regal down with yet another headlock. Rope break as Regal gets backed to the corner, clean break, we get a test of strength with a minute left, then Flair almost gets a cobra twist roll up for 2. Regal catches Flair with an uppercut, the ref puts a 10 count on Flair, which is nuts, as Regal hits a vertical suplex, they again tease a 10 count as Regal applies an abdominal stretch as time expires. Grizzly & Jett gave the round to Regal and Pittman gave it to Flair 10-9. WINNER OF ROUND 1: LORD STEVEN REGAL\n\nRound 2\n\nMay 7, 1994\n\nWe start with another reluctant handshake as its Flair who gets the first takedown & Regal escaping into a WOOO as Flair takes him down with an arm triangle. Head scissors reversal by Regal, but Flair quickly escapes with a side headlock. Heenan demands someone smack the other with a chair as Regal gets an arm wringer, but Flair somersaults out & kicks Regal away. They tease a test of strength as Flair gets a drop toehold & works the ankle as Regal gets the ropes. Another takedown by Flair, but Regal rolls him up for 2. Side headlock & judo throw by Regal, but Flair rolls through into a 2 count. Regal picks the leg & goes to the arm, wrenching away. Snap mare gets a 2 count for Regal, who gets a headlock, only for Flair to get an atomic drop onto the knee, tries for a Figure Four, but can’t get it. Regal hits an uppercut, Flair with a chop, Regal desperately tries for another toehold as Flair gets up & chops away as they lock up, Regal with a takedown as time expires. WINNER OF ROUND 2: DRAW Very weird because Flair took nearly that whole round, but we also never heard how the judges scored this either.\n\nRound 3\n\nMay 14, 1994\n\nVentura replaces Bobby on commentary this time, which sucks. Flair shoots a leg & gets a quick half crab before Regal gets the ropes. They pretty much repeat the spot as Flair again goes for the ankle pick, but Regal gets a small package for 2. Kimura by Regal, but Flair gets a fireman’s carry & places Regal on the apron. Back inside Regal again goes for the arm; Flair rolls through & again goes for the leg. Regal counters into an arm triangle almost as he wrenches the wrist simultaneously. They scatter quickly as Flair again gets the takedown with the leg (that Tony called a chin lock), but Regal counters into another kimura, as Flair shoots Regal off, shoulder tackle by Regal, only for Flair to hit a back suplex, then sinks in the Figure Four with 20 seconds left. Regal holds on as the round expires. Pittman, Taylor & Jett all give the round to Flair 10-9. WINNER OF ROUND 3: RIC FLAIR\n\nRound 4\n\nMay 21, 1994\n\nCrowd pops huge as Flair gets a side headlock takedown to start (think about that) as Regal gets a near fall counter. They continue to counter each other as Regal gets a cravat for another 2 count as they quickly pop up. Fireman’s carry takedown, wrenches the arm, as Regal pops him with a forearm. Big time uppercut drops Flair as the 10 count is applied, then again. Regal tries for a butterfly, but Flair backs to the corner. Bodyslam by Regal, who sinks in a bow & arrow, but Flair turns it into a pinning predicament for 2. Flair murders Regal with chops for 2, then sinks in a head scissors. Regal maneuvers his way out into a headlock, Flair with the atomic drop to the knee, snaps the hamstring, fires a chop, but Regal tries for a backslide 1…2…NO! Flair gets shoulder blocked over the top rope (not a DQ I guess since its different rules) as time expires in the round. All three judges score it 10-10 each man. WINNER OF ROUND 4: DRAW\n\nRound 5\n\nMay 28, 1994\n\nRegal is claiming Flair got a thumb to his eye early as Flair just WOOs, then tries for a Figure Four, but Regal escapes, rolls into a front face lock, but Flair reverses with a waist lock. Regal twists at the arm, but Flair somersaults out & picks the leg. Huge chop by Flair sends Regal back as Flair ends up on the apron & Regal suplexes him back inside. Flair takes his signature flip in the corner sends him outside as Sir William hits Flair with the umbrella. The ref didn’t see it, but all 3 judges did as Regal slams Flair down for a 2 count inside. Snap mare gets another 2 as Regal applies an abdominal stretch, but Flair hip tosses his way out at the 10 second mark as the round expires with Flair trying for a pin attempt. All 3 judges declare it a DRAW, which is dumb since they saw Regal cheat. Regardless they’re calling for 5 more minutes.\n\nFlair gets a small package for 2 then sinks in a half crab. Tony tells Jessie the reason for the draw is Regal was winning, but the cheating cost him the round. Eh, at least it’s something, good on you Tony. Flair applies a leg lock, but Regal wrenches at the face to escape. Flair is relentless going for the leg as this allows Regal to throw forearms repeatedly, but Flair fires back with chops. Flair does his corner flip & HITS THE AXE HANDLE!! I never thought Flair hit that aside from his final match! Figure Four is applied as Regal quickly grabs the ropes. Flair punts Sir William in the back of the head before hitting a back suplex on Regal 1…2…NO! Big time chops by Flair as he goes for the Figure Four, but another rope break. I should point out there’s a large woman in the front row who is losing her damn mind at this match. Regal got an eye poke as the ref admonishes him; William gets another cheap shot (in front of the judges once more). Uppercut by Regal, chop by Flair who hits the ropes, tripped by Williams (the referee saw this) as Flair ducks a shot, backslide 1…2…3!! WINNER OF ROUND 5: RIC FLAIR\n\nThis was really unlike anything we’d seen in WCW and a really cool change of pace, even if some of the “judges” decisions were questionable. Seeing Regal & Flair paired up like this was great and I’d really take the 20-25 minutes to check this series of matches out. I added the playlist for all 5 of the matches in sequence up top.\n\nHulk Hogan vs Andre the Giant\n\nMay 27, 1983\n\nNo way I wasn't using that pic for Andre/Hogan, way too good. 8 months before Hulk beat Shieky baby for the WWF Title and 4 years before Wrestlemania 3. Andre is stalling like crazy to start, so Hogan takes the fight to him on the floor & brings it back inside. Andre slaps on a bear hug immediately and we already have a rest hold, haha. Andre has this applied for at least 4 minutes before Hogan fights free & takes Andre down with a front face lock (think about that), but Andre turns the tables & locks one in of his own. They now both have front face locks & have been stuck in this position for over 5 minutes. Hogan gets the best of it as Andre rolls to his back & now Hogan has a sleeper before Andre knees Hogan in the head. Hogan hits a jumping knee when they get back up as they are drenched in sweat. Hogan gets an arm bar & works it over as Andre is screaming. Andre is up & chopping away, shoots Hogan off the ropes, but Hulk throws a clothesline that drops Andre for 2. Hulk drops a leg on the arm as Andre rises & headbutts Hogan down. ANDRE WITH THE IRISH WHIP & BIG BOOT!! He does it again, then sits down on Hogan’s chest, but Hogan kicks out with so much authority that sends Andre tumbling outside. Andre starts chucking chairs inside & chases Hogan with one as the chase is on around ringside! Andre catches Hogan, they brawl so long we get a double count out. I tell you what, remove the 10-14 minutes worth of rest holds, this match was pretty damn fun & beat the shit out of their WWF matches (aside from the historic bodyslam at Mania 3).\n\nShinya Hashimoto vs Oz\n\nMay 17, 1992\n\nI had zero clue Nash played Oz in May of 92. I thought he was well into his Vinnie Vegas phase, but apparently Japan didn’t like the Vin Man and wanted Oz? (I tweeted Nash a while back & he said it was a Dusty call. Shout out to Big Kev for that info!) I’m not lying to you when I say Hashimoto threw a leg kick & Oz (KEVIN F’N NASH) threw a head kick that sent Hashimoto to the floor!! Back inside we get some pretty sloppy wrestling before Hashimoto drops an elbow for 2. Oz back up & rains down rights before hitting a flying clothesline for a near fall. Side headlock applied as this gives us time to admire the silver dyed locks of Oz, who shoots Hashimoto off the ropes AND LEAP FROGS HIM before dropping an elbow of his own for 2. Chinlock applied & back to looking at the hair, not one out of place. Hashimoto gets up & Oz dares him to hit him, so we get a collar elbow tie-up late in the match, haha. Hashimoto punches him right in the face & we get another lock up. Oz misses a clothesline & eats a spinning heel kick for 2. Stiff kicks to the chest & another spinning heel kick gets Hashimoto another 2. Oz puts his head down off an Irish whip & Hashimoto hits a DDT for another 2. Hashimoto plants him with another DDT for 3. I immediately needed to watch this match when I saw it was available.\n\nLifeguard Steve Collins vs Buddy Valentine\n\nMay 6, 1996\n\nWhat in the hell is this? Valentine looks like Captain Kangaroo’s brother. Steve Collins looks like a jobber from the early 90s who was given a shitty gimmick. Collins doesn’t have the body of a lifeguard. Chris Cruise & Dusty mock that we’re seeing too much of his body as he hits a dropkick & works the arm. Dusty is cracking up on commentary about how close we are to seeing his junk fall out of his trunks. Valentine hits a dropkick, but Collins fights back with a back body drop. Flying clothesline off the top, then COLLINS MURDERS VALENTINE with a botched flapjack that Buddy took as a back drop for the 3 count. Dusty didn’t say a word after that as Chris Cruise called the finish. You don't get Dusty speechless all that often, but it was warranted in this case. I added the match so you can watch this all in its glory. Take 3 minutes and soak in the suckiness.\n\nRandy Savage vs Rick Steiner\n\nTokyo Dome 2000\n\nJanuary 4, 2000\n\nWith the exception of a house show match for WCW against Sid 10 days after this show, this was Randy Savage’s last wrestling match (I’m not counting the TNA 6 man tag he didn’t wrestle in or the WCW battle royal on Thunder that he did nothing in either), which is a real bummer. Savage shit talks Masa Saito ringside before the bell as he takes the fight to Steiner immediately & grounds him soon after a shoulder tackle. Steiner gets out & hits a few suplexes, before destroying Macho with a clothesline for 2. Savage fights back & rakes Steiner’s face across the ropes before locking in a Camel Clutch. Steiner blocks a suplex attempt as they fall into the ropes & Savage gets a cheap shot. Steiner answers with three German suplexes & connects with the Steiner Bulldog off the top 1…2…KICK OUT! Savage with a blatant low blow as he throws Steiner onto the ramp & drops a few elbows. Savage sends Steiner off the ramp & grabs a chair as Steiner rolls back inside. Chair shot right to the head as Savage hits his top rope elbow drop 1…2…KICK OUT!! Savage can’t believe it, so he attacks the referee, sending him to the ramp as Steiner avoids another chair shot, hits a clothesline & connects with a DDT on the chair. Steiner goes to the top, but loses his balance & drops to the floor as he tries it once more & hits the bulldog for the 1…2…3! Damn, that ending was brutal. The match was just ok, the visual of seeing Savage & Steiner wrestle in 2000 in the Tokyo Dome was more impressive than the match. Post match Steiner held Savage so Saito could hit him. Not the ideal end to one of the greatest of all time.\n\nChris Candido vs The Great Singh (Khali)\n\nFebruary 1, 2002\n\nThis is one of those matches you’d only imagine could happen if you drew the names from a Lethal Lottery tumbler (I’ve used that line before, but it warrants using again for this one). Bell sounds & Candido struts all around the ring before getting hit with a shoulder tackle & a massive choke slam as he rolls to the floor. Khali goes after him & presses him clear over his head over the top rope back inside. Candido is selling his ass off as he’s bumping all around the ring. Khali with a big boot, but Candido foolishly starts chopping, but 1 Khali chop sends him down. Candido takes a flip bump over the top to the floor, but rakes Khali’s eyes as he goes up top, but Khali goes to the apron & TOSSES CANDIDO CLEAR OFF THE TOP ONTO THE RAMP!! Candido literally bounces on impact as Khali powerbombs him from the ramp back into the ring for the 1…2…3! I have zero clue why this match happened, but Chris Candido made Khali look like a million bucks, so like usual, he did his job to perfection. Candido was so fucking great, he’s sorely missed. So happy I got to see him wrestle early 2005.\n\nGood of time as any, right?\n\nBrawl For All\n\nFirst Round\n\nSteve Blackman vs Marc Mero\n\nBell sounds & Blackman gets a takedown 10 seconds in, then another 10 seconds later. Crowd already booing within 30 seconds, haha. Another takedown by Blackman, who throws an overhand right, then a 4th takedown as the round ends. Holy shit the crowd is booing badly. Round 2 starts with another takedown from Blackman, then another, then another. WE WANT WRESTLING!” chants break out as the round ends. Round 3 starts with the 7th takedown by Blackman, 8th takedown, 9th takedown, Mero throws some jabs because that’ll do it, but the bell sounds & Blackman wins this by a country mile. However, Blackman had to withdraw from the tournament due to “injury training”. So regardless of getting destroyed, Mero advances.\n\nMark Canterbury vs Bradshaw\n\nSome heavy leather thrown out the gate, both connecting the same amount. Canterbury wearing sneakers and Bradshaw wearing his ring gear is hilarious. Mark tries for a takedown, but JBL avoids it and that’s literally the end of Round 1. Bell sounds & we’re scrapping again as JBL does windmill punches & Canterbury staggers to the ropes, eats an uppercut as they fall into the corner. It takes like 20 seconds to break it up & they finally get back to the center with 5 seconds left as the round ends. Boring chants as we start Round 3 with Canterbury getting a takedown, they’re up & Mark gets a single leg and JR says that doesn’t count as a takedown (the fuck it doesn’t, Jim). Round ends and they announce Bradshaw as the winner, I have zero idea why since they threw an even amount of punches & Canterbury got 2 takedowns. Eh, whatever.\n\nBrakkus vs Savio Vega\n\nSavio tries for a takedown right away, but Brakkus stuffs it, then gets a takedown of his own (JR is already confused). They’re both up & start throwing as Savio is connecting a lot more as Brakkus is staggered as the round ends. Brakkus starts round 2 by literally diving for a leg, but Savio backs away. Savio is absolutely destroying the German as he knocks Brakkus down & keeps clipping the big man as the round ends. Brakkus has a death stare as the former Kwang shoots a double leg at the start of Round 3 and gets the takedown. Brakkus is so gassed as Savio knocks him down yet again. Couple more jabs seals it for Savio.\n\nDroz vs Hawk\n\nHawk connects with the early shots as Droz tries batting them away, but the LOD member keeps the jabs coming. King calls Droz a “Lunch Blower” as Hawk loses his mouth piece & Droz gets a double leg as the bell sounds, but not sure if they takedown counts. Hawk’s takedown stuffed to start Round 2 as Droz pops Hawk with some shots as Hawk stumbles into the corner. Droz clearly hurt his right hand during that, but he keeps throwing as that does it for the round. I think we’re tied heading into Round 3 as Droz hits some jabs as Hawk throws wildly, not connecting. Hawk’s mouthpiece falls out again, so Droz spits his out & we got a slugfest before we get a break in the corner. They throw more jabs as these two are gassed & hurt as they announce a DRAW. Droz actually advanced since Hawk was injured in the fight.\n\nBart Gunn vs Bob Holly\n\nBodacious Bart & Bombastic Bob go to WAR as jabs by Bart to start as Holly is trying to go for the body, but he’s getting clocked with shots in doing so. They’re both sticking & moving as we don’t get much the second part of the round as the crowd is getting rowdy already. Jabs by Bart start round 2 as Holly back to the body. Same story as Bart is connecting & Holly simply isn’t as the round ends. Bell sounds as Holly finally starts throwing some shots, but gets clipped as Bart just throwing the hell out of that left. Left hook, left uppercut, left jab, it’s all Bart Gunn, who wins this easily.\n\nGodfather vs Dan Severn\n\nBell sounds and Severn tries for a takedown, but can’t get it. Godfather instead almost keeps him down, but Severn gets a single leg & full mount (Jack Doan says it isn’t a takedown, which baffles me). Severn tries for another single leg, but doesn’t get it. Bell sounds & Severn refuses to let go of the leg & gets scolded in doing so. Round 2 starts with Kama getting one shot, but Severn holds him on the ropes, takes him down & then stalls again. Kama stuffs a takedown, but Severn holds on yet again. Severn doing himself zero favors in this as “We Want Wrestling” chants break out again. Round 3 Godfather stuffs a takedown, clean break, uppercut by Kama, Severn shoots a single, but can’t get it (JR says it is, but c’mon). Severn does it again & mercifully this is over. Most boring fight of the tournament so far & it’s not the Godfather’s fault at all. Thankfully Severn pulled out of the tournament saying he had “nothing to prove” which was code for “not wanting to lose to a wrestler in a shoot fight”.\n\nPierre vs Steve Williams\n\nDr. Death gets a takedown within seconds, then starts hammer fisting Pierre, then another takedown. They try for takedown at the same time; butt heads, Pierre uses Doc’s momentum & gets a takedown at the end of the round. Doc clearly won that one as bell sounds for round 2 & Doc gets another takedown. He’s throwing lefts to Pierre’s bad eye as they scramble & break, Pierre is getting clocked with shots as he’s saved by the bell. Bell sounds & Doc unloads shots as Pierre is doing nothing but absorbing a ton of punches. He’s completely gassed as he’s standing there, hands down & turns his back as the ref calls it. Doc demolished PCO.\n\n8-Ball vs Scorpio\n\nWe only get highlights as 8-Ball throws bombs early on, but he gassed himself out as Scorpio got a takedown in round 2, then threw body shots & more overall punches in the final round to win it. I have zero clue why they decided to not air this, the only fight in the tournament they didn’t air. Just strange as it’s not like we’re getting all time classics in this deal.\n\nSecond Round\n\nBart Gunn vs Steve Williams – July 27\n\nWhere it all fell apart in terms of booking as Doc gets a takedown out the gate. Bart throws some lefts as they tangle in the ropes. More lefts, Doc throws some of his own, they’re trading body shots, uppercut left by Bart as the bell sounds with them clinched. Round 2, Doc is seemingly just shoving Bart to the corner as Bart is throwing. This happens the entire round as Bart gets a takedown that almost knocks Doc out to the floor (this is where Bart says “sorry” as Doc said “whoa”). The “Unofficial Score Card” says Doc is winning, but I have zero clue why (then again, maybe I do). Bell sounds as Doc tries for a takedown while chants of BORING rain down. Doc gets taken down by Bart & this is where his leg is thrashed, with 25 seconds left. They both start THROWING as Bart connects with more, specifically the left as he hits a perfect left uppercut with 7 seconds left. JR goes pretty much silent as The King takes over for a bit before he gets back into it. I think this was both being concerned with his friend & also oh shit, he was supposed to win this thing kind of deal.\n\nGodfather vs Scorpio – August 3\n\nScorpio is offered the Ho’s by The Godfather, but he declines. Pretty foolish in the long run as Kama is sticking & moving, connecting with more shots as its head shots, body shots, you name it, this was all Godfather. We hear “these guys are out of their element” for the 90th time on commentary. Round 2, Godfather connects with more heavy shots as Scorpio is just trying to survive, wishing he would’ve taken the ladies. Round 3, Scorpio tries a takedown, but gets stuffed and JR says Godfather gets points for the takedown despite it not being one. More jabs by Kama, who dares Scorpio to come at him & he simply doesn’t as Godfather easily wins this.\n\nSavio Vega vs Droz – August 10\n\nHey did you know these guys are out of their element? Kwang with a takedown, but the ref says no points, which is ludicrous. These guys are getting knock downs & the ref keeps saying “Slip! No Points!” as the round expires. Jack Doan clearly has money on this fight. Bell sounds & they have a brief exchange before separating. Did you also know when you put gloves on a wrestler, it negates the offense they can do? Droz gets a big double leg takedown & the CROWD EXPLODES, not kidding. Savio throws some punches, but Droz tosses him down as the round expires. Round 3 as we get a touch of gloves, Droz gets a takedown & crowd pops again as they exchange some wild shots, Savio on spaghetti legs, but time expires before we get a KO. Droz wins it as they hug. Aside from Bart KO’ing Dr. Death, this was the biggest crowd reaction of the tournament.\n\nMarc Mero vs Bradshaw – August 10\n\nJBL rests on Mero in the corner to start. Mero tries a front face lock, but JBL charges forward & gets a takedown, something I don’t think he was even trying for. Mero backs him to the corner & the bell sounds. JBL rushes him, front face lock, but we get a break & Mero tries for a punch, but JBL gets a takedown. Mero tries throwing some punches, but gets hugged in the corner to end the round. Crowd booing this fight as JBL clearly is winning this, despite some rabbit punches. Unofficial scores say it’s even headed into the final round. Mero with some jabs, but JBL just powers him to the mat. Ref says that’s 5 points and Mero literally says “he didn’t fucking break!” as all JBL is doing is hooking Mero’s arms & falling down on top of him over & over. Mero is pretty annoyed, JBL is gassed and we get a DRAW, so one more round. That’s a mix of boos & cheers as JBL hasn’t turned around yet. Bell sounds & Mero backed to the corner, arm tangled in the ropes as JBL tries pulling him down again, but doesn’t work. They separate & JBL gets the CLEAN takedown finally as Mero tries to counter, but JBL is stalling & runs the clock. Winning because of that sole takedown.\n\nSemi-Finals\n\nBart Gunn vs The Godfather – August 17\n\nJabs by both, but it’s Godfather who gets in the first hard shot with a left, so Bart shoots a double, but gets stuffed & we get a break. Bart avoids some hooks, starts throwing haymakers, but Godfather does a good job blocking them as Round 1 ends. Pretty even round, which I’d probably give to Godfather since he blocked a lot of Bart’s offense (judges give it to Bart, so the hell do I know?). Round 2 starts with Bart trying for a quick takedown, but Godfather avoids it and we get a break. Jabs by Bart, but Godfather backs him to the corner, unloading body shots before Bart throws a wild left & again & again & again, all connecting as he knocks down Godfather at the bell. Round 3 Godfather coming out with wobbly legs & Bart capitalizes with a picture perfect right hook to KO Godfather, almost falling out of the ring.\n\nBradshaw vs Droz – August 17\n\nDroz hits 3 rights to start, but JBL answers with one of his own. JBL with a flurry as he keeps that jab going as well & clearly takes round 1. Round 2, Droz blocks some jabs, throws some shots of his own that are getting through, but a cheap shot in the back of the head by JBL, ref does nothing. Droz connects with some more shots, but JBL hugs him in the ropes. Droz gets a takedown with 5 seconds left & takes the round as the crowd cheers. They scramble early as Droz wants a leg to start the round, but can’t get it. JBL with an uppercut, Droz with one as well. JBL tries for a takedown, but Droz gets in the ropes. JBL hits one punch, then locks up. Pretty much nothing happened in that round. I have zero idea how Bradshaw won that. I’m glad he won though, because we all know what happens in the finals. Droz did get an ovation for the effort though.\n\nFinals\n\nBradshaw vs Bart Gunn – August 24\n\nNot gonna lie, out of all of these, I watched this one first for obvious reasons. Both guys are swinging for the fences immediately as Bart clocks JBL with a left hook, then another that plants Bradshaw down to the mat. He slowly stumbles to his feet, already out of it, but says he’s fine, despite having a serious case of the Jimmy Legs & Bart levels him with 2 more lefts. Bradshaw face plants to the mat & he’s done already.\n\nYou're a LEGEND, Bart Gunn!\n\nONITA IN NEW JAPAN\n\nAtsushi Onita is one of the all time greatest hardcore wrestlers in the world, his ultraviolent style is something that was insane when I first saw it back in the 90s on VHS and remains insane even to this day. He’s retired many times, so we never know when it’ll truly stick (it hasn’t yet as he’s wrestled as early as December 31st last year at the time of this writing), but he’s an insane person and legit has some of the wildest matches I’ve ever seen in my life. So I was interested if New Japan World had any of his matches and come to find out, there were 5, the only 5 times he’s wrestled for them. Three of which are of the Hardcore Death Match variety, 1 normal match & a 6 man tag. I should point out; these are nowhere near the level of intensity & insanity that he’s done elsewhere in his career. If you're up for it, they're out there, I'm not a big ultraviolent fan, but Onita as a character is fucking awesome. I still thought it’d be cool to check out what New Japan World had to offer from the death match legend.\n\nAtsushi Onita vs Kensuke Sasaki\n\nWrestling World 99\n\nJanuary 4, 1999\n\nOnita swings a chair & breaks it across Sasaki’s head and SASAKI NO SELLS IT! Onita gets chucked to the ramp where his jacket is ripped off Onita fights back, but gets chucked into the ring and immediately tumbles to the floor. We get the same exact spot as Sasaki just rag dolls him around before Onita breaks another chair over Sasaki’s head ringside. We see a chair fly in from off screen, so I don’t know if a fan chucked a chair at Onita or not. Onita hits a piledriver through the announce table, but both men get up immediately & start swinging chairs. Back in the ring Sasaki hits a lariat as red mist sprays in the air from Onita. Another Sasaki lariat as the camera is clearly on Onita grabbing the lighter & flash paper out of his jeans as he throws a fireball at Sasaki and the ref calls the bell. Well then, that was something. I’m conflicted because this was a fun little brawl, but the finish was super weak. These two brawled the entire match, chairs, tables, but the fireball was cause for the DQ. Pretty lame if you ask me.\n\nAtsushi Onita vs Masahiro Chono\n\nNo Rope Exploding Barbed Wire Match\n\nApril 9, 1999 – Strong Style Symphony\n\nOnita with a DDT immediately that Chono no sells, so Onita stacks him up with a powerbomb for 2. We get sirens as the corner lights start flashing and we get a countdown as Chono sank in a STF. Randomly they all stopped and Chono let go of the hold confused. I think something was supposed to go off, so Chono chucked a chair at Onita, who ducked & the chair hit the barbed wire so we get an EXPLOSION! Chono sort of takes a bump from this as Onita hits a bulldog on the chair. Chono is whipped into the barbed wire and EXPLOSION! DDT on the chair gets 2 as Onita wants a Scorpion Death Lock, but Chono gets an ankle lock instead. We get a slap battle until Onita charges at Chono, who moves & Onita runs into the barbed wire for another EXPLOSION! We see a super nasty deep cut on Onita’s arm that’s bleeding as Chono targets it. Chono is daring Onita to fight back & he obliges as he hits another stack up powerbomb for 2. Both men slowly rise as Chono hits a Yakuza Kick that sent Onita into the barbed wire a little bit, but no explosion. Onita is grabbing the referee before Chono hits another Yakuza Kick and all three men (ref included) fall into the barbed wire & we get an EXPLOSION!! They all collapse as Red Shoes pops in and replaces the original ref as Chono gets multiple near falls off multiple Yakuza Kicks. Onita won’t quit as he pops up & grabs a random head lock (guess where this goes) as Chono runs them both into the barbed wire, EXPLOSION! Red Shoes puts the 10 count on both men as Onita rises at the 9 count, but face plants, so the ref counts 10. We get a DOUBLE COUNTOUT in an EXPLODING BARBED WIRE MATCH. That’s insanely stupid. Did they need to protect both men that badly? Why even have this match if you’re going to do a finish like that? The crowd is more annoyed than angry as this was just an awful ending. Post match though, Chono put Onita’s jacket on him almost reluctantly earning his respect. That image made this worth it, but had it not been for that, it felt like both guys (Onita especially) destroyed themselves for nothing.\n\nAtsushi Onita, AKIRA & Masahiro Chono vs Hiro Saito, Hiroyoshi Tenzan & Keiji Mutoh\n\nJuly 21, 1999 – Summer Struggle 99\n\nI’m not going to review the first half of this match. It’s your typical isolate the babyface type deal as Onita faked getting in multiple occasions just for the reaction & when he did, Chono accidentally kicked him allowing Tenzan to get a flying headbutt. AKIRA took Tenzan down & hits a suicide dive as Saito hit a senton on Onita. Mutoh hit his snap elbow before the heels attacked him allowing Onita to go outside & waffle Mutoh with a chair. AKIRA tags in, but immediately gets beat down by Tenzan. Spinning wheel kick gets Tenzan 2 before AKIRA hits a flying clothesline tagging in Chono who connects with a Yakuza Kick, then sinks in the STF. Saito breaks it up as Chono hits more big kicks that Tenzan no sells & hits a Samoan Drop. Handspring elbow in the corner by Mutoh for 2 as he rolls through a Yakuza by Chono, but eats the second attempt. Saito in & hits sentons on AKIRA as Onita has grabbed another chair. Match has broken down as Saito goes to the top, but Onita cracks him with the chair. The ref is in the ring as Onita is hitting people with chairs. Mutoh tries for a figure four, but ONITA WITH THE GREEN MIST!! AKIRA hits a big splash and pins Muta 1…2…3!! I’m surprised Onita didn’t get the pin, but I guess it makes sense as it leads us to our next Onita match.\n\nThe Great Muta vs The Great Nita\n\nNo Rope Barbed Wire Barricade Mat Electric Land Mine Double Hell Death Match\n\nAugust 28, 1999 – Battle of Last Summer\n\nDid you get all of that stip title? I press play and Nita is hitting Muta with a sickle, A FUCKING SICKLE!! Luckily Muta has on a huge jacket, but Nita tosses him into the barbed wire EXPLOSION as it really doesn’t have an effect. Muta takes his jacket off (dumb move) as Nita tries throwing him off the ring, but Muta puts on the brakes as Nita wraps the chain of the sickle around his throat. GREEN MIST by Muta as he grabs the sickle & hits an elbow drop (with a sickle in hand, so that meant nothing, haha). Full minute of Muta choking Nita, but it’s so Nita can get some mist & GREEN MISTS MUTA! He’s mocking Muta & hits him with the sickle, then DDT for 2. Multiple headbutts as Nita messes around too much & is sent into the barbed wire for an EXPLOSION! It’s just sickle shots & boots by Muta as Nita almost rolls to the floor of land mines, but it was to throw a FIREBALL on Muta! He sets off the alarm on the corner post as sirens sound as he powerbombs Muta for 2. DDT, sickle shots, but Muta gets more GREEN MIST to take over. The ring announcer is counting down as Nita is rolled to the land mines & we get a little explosion before Muta & the ref scramble & we get a pretty tame brief series of explosions (it was really silly). Nita looks like a wreck outside as he’s slowly getting up from the barbed wire & inside. Muta hits him in the gut with the sickle and Nita spits RED MIST in the air (I know this is Onita’s signature to make us believe it’s blood spraying, but they’ve been hitting each other with this sickle the whole match and neither man has bled up to that point). Haha, Muta sets off a fireball, but he’s facing the wrong way so he just does a little twirl with the fire. He sents Nita into the barbed wire & we get another EXPLOSION as the red mist Nita used earlier is really cool visually as he collapses while Muta covers him for 2. We get what fells like the 90th sickle shot of the match as Muta wins it 1…2…3. Onita is so good at selling (he’s literally fighting fans post match) these kinds of gimmick matches, but the stuff in between was pretty bad IMO. So many sickle shots, zero to show for it. The timed explosion was really silly too. I wish it was just a plain wrestling match with Nita vs Muta.\n\nRiki Choshu vs Atsushi Onita\n\nNo Ropes Exploding Barbed Wire Match\n\nJuly 29, 2000 – Riki Choshu Revival\n\nChoshu attacks immediately, choking Onita down as the ref calls for a break (in a barbed wire match mind you) as Choshu shoves Onita into the ropes and we get our first EXPLOSION as the shirt is ripped from Onita. Choshu then bodyslams Onita into the barbed wire for another EXPLOSION!! We’re 1 minute in and Onita is bleeding from the mouth & badly from the arm. Choshu is just beating the hell out of him until Onita gets 4 low blows and a DDT. Choshu no sells & takes Onita in the wire again for a third EXPLOSION! Choshu wants a brainbuster & connects as he sinks in the Scorpion Death Lock and you’d think Onita would be screwed with no ropes around, but he grabs the barbed wire & the EXPLOSION causes Choshu to release the hold. He chucks Onita into the wire for another EXPLOSION, but only gets a 2 count. He hits a big time lariat, then another, THEN CHOSHU HITS THE BARBED WIRE LIKE THEY’RE RING ROPES (no explosion mind you) as he hits another lariat & locks in the Scorpion Death Lock once more. Onita says he doesn’t quit, but the referee calls for the bell anyway and awards the match to Choshu. This was a one sided beating that turned ridiculous. Onita getting 4 low blows & a DDT for his only offense, then Choshu hitting the fucking barbed wire like ropes made this pretty bad. Sadly this was the last match from Onita on NJPWWorld.\n\nDynamite Kid vs Davey Boy Smith\n\nFebruary 3, 1984\n\nI found this match by randomly clicking a show looking for something else entirely, so of course I had to watch this. I only thought these two fought in Canada growing up. Fast start with nearfalls & take downs aplenty as Davey got sunset flips & crucifixes before Dynamite got a kitchen sink knee. Dynamite slows the pace, but Davey gets the arm & wrenches away. Dynamite kips up & rakes the eyes, but Davey presses him high over his head down for 2. Running powerslam & a vertical suplex get Davey another near fall (hit signature moves this early was interesting to see in 84) as he goes back to a head lock. Dynamite gets back in control with a snap mare, chops & headbutts before sinking in a modified Octopus Stretch. Davey is screaming NO as Dynamite clubs him down. Dynamite crashes & burns off a missed top rope headbutt. Davey works the leg, but Dynamite hits an enzugiri flipping Davey over, as we have a slug fest until Dynamite gets a head scissors. Davey gets free, chucks Dynamite to the floor & hits a suicide dive! Back inside Davey gets a small package for 2 before going back to the head lock. Dynamite fights back with a dropkick & standing headbutt before he returns the favor & throws Davey outside. Davey to the top & hits a missile dropkick, charges and both tumble hard to the outside. The brawl continues out there until Dynamite hits a back suplex & beats the count. This was an odd match because while technically it was solid, Dynamite played heel early on, but the crowd was behind him, so Davey had to play heel the second half of the match. Post match Dynamite is calling out The Cobra, who he’d ultimately defeat for the WWF Junior Heavyweight Title.\n\nKeiichi Yamada (Jushin Liger) vs Yuosamu Funaki\n\nYear End In Kokugikan\n\nDecember 27, 1987\n\nSo I really wanted to watch a match with Jushin Liger before he was masked & Jushin Liger, so there’s zero reason I chose this match out of the handful of Yamada matches available on NJPWWorld. They trade & duck kicks to start at a fast pace as Yamada grounds Funaki with a bow & arrow, then a spinning toe hold. Yamada with a leg lock that Funaki tries slapping out of, but Yamada grounds him back down. Back up, Funaki hits a leaping spin kick & a leg sweep that plants Yamada on his face, then plants Funaki with a piledriver for 2. Funaki isn’t down very long as he gets a leg lock, then tries for a triangle head scissors & gets it. Yamada powers up & connects with a powerbomb, but can’t follow up with a dropkick. Funaki with a lightning quick kick combo then dropkicks Yamada in the corner. He tries again, but Yamada hits a flying forearm & takes it to the top rope and hits a superplex for 2. Jumping Tombstone plants Funaki on his head for another 2 count as Yamada locks in a single leg crab. Funaki fights & gets the ropes as Yamada hits a wild wheel kick, hooks a headlock & Funaki tries for a back suplex, but Yamada floats over for 2. Yamada chucked off the top as Funaki dropkicks him to the outside, then hits a suicide dive! Funaki tries for a suplex back in the ring & we get a standing switch spot before Yamada gets a European Clutch for the 1…2…3!\n\nLiger’s Debut Match!\n\nJushin Thunder Liger vs Kuniaki Kobayashi\n\nApril 24, 1989\n\nI needed to see this match because of Liger retiring & the fact that Kobayashi will be cornering a team against Liger come Wrestle Kingdom 14 is pretty cool. Liger immediately sends his opponent to the floor & nails a top rope dive as he plants Kobayashi with a snap suplex, somersault senton & splash. Kobayashi briefly gains control, but Liger sinks in the Romero Special, only for Kobayashi to escape & lock in almost a Lion Tamer. Liger gets free & gets a head scissors, but Kobayashi wiggles out & gets a heel hook before Liger rolls into the ropes. Kobayashi tries to take the mask off, but instead settles for a sleeper as they both tumble outside. Weird spot as Liger tried to clothesline Kobayashi over the railing, but he didn’t go over fully & they were just stuck momentarily. Back inside Kobayashi gets a mule kick low & I have no clue how the ref missed that. Liger fires back with a Koppo Kick, then an abdominatl stretch, but Kobayashi falls in the ropes. Kobayashi with a Fisherman’s Suplex, but Liger gets a rope break. Kobayashi complains too long & Liger hits a Brainbuster, then Tombstone as he goes up top & hits a somersault senton, then German suplex for 3. Welp, this match was pretty dang sloppy, but considering this was Liger’s debut, I’m just very thankful he became friggin awesome super quick. Highly recommend watching this match, not for the match quality, but to see the character and skills of Jushin Liger & how they both evolved over time.\n\nEl Gigante vs Big Cat\n\nApril 27, 1991\n\nBefore he was Mr. Hughes in WCW, he was Big Cat as here we are, Bill Alfonso the referee as Gigante is hopping around the ring as the bell sounds. He slams Big Cat down, who rakes the big man’s eyes & throws shots that Gigante doesn’t sell one bit. Clubbing blows repeatedly by Gigante, who hits a massive vertical suplex (after asking the crowd for about 30 seconds), then a big boot before getting a Claw Slam for the 1…2…3. That was literally it & it’s probably for the best. Like I’m going to pass up watching a Giant Gonzalez vs Mr. Hughes match? To think, these two would be feuding with Undertaker just 2 years later.\n\nEl Gigante vs Nailz\n\nG1 Climax\n\nAugust 3, 1994\n\nYes this was thankfully a non-tournament match, but I really wanted you to see that Gigante, Nailz and G1 were in the same sentence. One of the more notorious matches in New Japan history as we get a slugfest to start, but quickly change to a chokefest as Nailz bites Gigante & rakes his eyes before going back to the bread & butter, choking. More eye raking as Gigante starts choking Nailz in the corner. You can hear a pin drop as they trade punches before we go back to choking each other & more eye raking. Gigante whips Nailz to the corner then hits a lariat before locking on the Claw as he lays Nailz down carefully for the 3 count. Yup, that does it, literally 2 moves in the match that weren’t a choke or eye rake.\n\nShinya Hashimoto & Kensuke Sasaki vs Meng & The Barbarian\n\nHyper Battle 97\n\nMarch 8, 1997\n\nTalk about a battle of the hosses, eh? Meng & Sasaki start as Sasaki gets shoulder tackled & clotheslined down, but answers with a snap powerslam as Meng tags Barb and here comes Hashimoto. Shoving match before Barb just throws his opponent down like a ton of bricks. Hashimoto drops Barb with a shoulder tackle, but Barb answers with a big boot & body slam. Elbow drop & nonchalant cover gets a 2 as Hashimoto throws a series of kicks that Barb welcomes, but Hashimoto throws everything behind the last one & drops him. He & Sasaki trade tags as they’ve isolated Barbarian, only for Meng to come in without a tag and punt Hashimoto in the head. Meng officially tags in and we have two of the scariest men in all wrestling squaring off. They’re putting everything behind their shots until Sasaki gets in & levels Meng with a lariat. Backdrop suplex countered as the Faces of Fear hit their awesome back drop/powerbomb combo for a 2 count. Barbarian hits the sloppiest top rope overhead belly to belly you’ll ever see as he gets a 2 count out of it. Meng in as he chops away at Sasaki in the corner, shoots him out, hits a lariat, Sasaki no sells & murders Meng with a lariat. Hashimoto in & lights up Meng with a spinning heel kick for 2. Snap belly to belly gets him another 2 as Hashimoto signals for the end, but Meng backdrops him out of a DDT attempt. The match breaks down into a brawl before Hashimoto hits his DDT on the second try for the 3 count! Only complaint, not enough Meng vs Hashimoto, we got it at the end when they were both tired. I wish we had a 1 on 1 match with those two.\n\nHulk Hogan vs Abdullah the Butcher\n\nMay 26, 1982\n\nWe get lock ups with both men shoving the other into the ropes, then both no sell dueling shoulder blocks until Hogan hits a high knee sending Abby outside. Knees to the midsection as Hogan slaps on a bear hug 2 minutes into this thing. Abby fights back & chops Hogan in the throat to the floor. Here comes Abby as the brawl continues out there briefly before we head back inside. Hogan hits a clothesline (that Abby sells perfectly, slowly taking a back bump), tries for a splash, but Abby gets the knees up. ABBY HAS THE SPIKE HIDDEN & SPIKES HOGAN who is bleeding a gusher. Abby keeps spiking Hogan, but hides the spike in his pants before the ref knows what’s up. The ref is a moron, he’s just standing in the corner as Abby is repeatedly stabbing Hogan in the head with the spike. He rams Hogan into the post over & over before the camera shows Hogan getting rid of something (blade maybe?) as Abby brings him back in for a suplex & elbow 1…2…KICK OUT! Hogan is slowly Hulking Up as Abby keeps throwing chops, headbutts, but Hogan’s no selling like a champ as he throws rights & BITES ABBY to the point where Abby is bleeding now. Chop to the throat stops Hulk’s momentum briefly, but he keeps throwing right hands that sending Abby outside. They spill into the crowd, despite being covered in blood (80’s people!) & start throwing chairs as people are scatting in droves. We finally get back ringside where Hogan clocks Abby with a table as young lions try separating them as this match has to have been a double countout. They both jump back in the ring & lock up as the young lions continue struggling pulling them apart. Abby headbutts a young lion as Hogan keeps throwing shots at him. This honestly ruled, despite not a whole lot happening, they made the most out of this. Check this match out if you can, it shows how over Hogan was even then & also how dastard of a heel Abby was.\n\nBruiser Brody vs Texas Red (The Undertaker)\n\nThis is WCCW from 1984 and I should point out, Taker is managed by Percy Pringle. How about that for full circle? Lock up with Taker pushing Brody to the corner & comes off a little snug (like Taker said in the Broken Skull Sessions) as Brody takes him down with an arm drag, Taker shoots him off the ropes, but Brody hits a big boot that Taker sells awkwardly. Clubbing shots by Brody who throws Taker outside as he chucks him into the table & smacks him with a chair, breaking it on the back of Taker. Back inside Brody ties Taker in the ropes & hits running big boots as he frees him & hits one final big boot for the 3 count. This was exactly how Taker described to Austin & it’s really cool.\n\nOwen Hart vs Black Tiger (Rollerball Rocco)\n\nIWGP Jr. Heavyweight Title #1 Contender Tournament\n\nJanuary 25, 1990\n\nNo, this wasn’t Eddy Guerrero as Black Tiger, but Rollerball Rocco, UK veteran, who was nearing his retirement at this point. It didn’t take long for this one to spill to the floor as Owen was sent into the railing, but hooked Tiger’s legs & posted them. Back inside Tiger takes back over, grounding Owen with a snapmare, then a friggin’ modified Pedigree! Owen did his flip out of the Rocker Dropper & got a backbreaker before getting a rest hold. Tiger gets out & works the arm, but Owen does his spring off the top & backflip out of it that sends Tiger to the floor. Baseball slide sends Tiger crashing into the railing, but he’s quick to regain control, driving a knee to the back of Owen’s head for 2. Bad looking spot where Tiger was supposed to duck a leapfrog, but he didn’t duck and collided head first with Owen below the belt. That looked really painful as Tiger hits another modified Pedigree before going up top & dropping an elbow for 2. Tiger goes up top, but misses a knee drop as Owen tries for a back drop, but gets booted & Tiger hits a senton. Owen fights out of a head scissors & hits a Tombstone before going up top & hits a missile dropkick, but can’t hit the follow up one. Tiger hoists Owen up on his shoulders, but Owen wiggles free & hits a lariat. Tiger suplexes Owen over the top & Owen holds on, causing both to tumble to the floor. Back inside Owen gets cut off at the top as Tiger hits a superplex for 2. Tiger looked for a falling back top rope elbow, misses, as Owen hits a German suplex for the 3!\n\nHulk Hogan (w/Jimmy Hart) vs The Great Muta\n\nWrestling Dontaku in Fukuoka Dome\n\nMay 3, 1993\n\nHogan rocking the WWF Title he flat out stole from Bret as he gets a cross arm breaker early, but Muta gets the ropes & goes to the ramp where he almost does snow angels, not kidding. Nice little takedown by Hogan as he gets a front face lock as Muta backs him in the corner. We get the same spot, but Muta this time drives the shoulder to the midsection before Hogan escapes. Hogan with knees to the gut in the corner & hits clotheslines, misses a back elbow follow as Muta hits 2 dropkicks that send Hulkster outside frustrated. Muta rakes the eyes, hits his snap elbow & grabs an arm, but Hogan counters with a drop toe hold as Muta gets a breather. Muta suckers Hulk into a test of strength but chops him in the throat, then outside as we start our brawl. Suplex by Hogan, who breaks the count despite the ref not putting one on them. We spill in the crowd before Hogan hits a big time back suplex ringside, but Muta fights back, posting Hogan twice, then grabs the time keepers hammer for the bell & clocks Hogan with it. Muta full heel at this point as he hits Hogan again with it before discarding the evidence. I love it, he uses a weapon to transition into a rest hold. Fight spills to the ramp where Muta hits a suplex, then sprints the entire ramp & hits a clothesline sending both back inside (both guys arms get caught in the ropes as this happens). Hogan fights back as if nothing happened (classic Terry) as he chucks the ref out of his way to go back to work on Muta. ENZUGIRI BY HULK HOGAN 1…2…KICK OUT! Muta reverses an Irish whip & hits his handspring elbow in the corner followed by a back breaker. Muta with a moonsault 1…2….NO!! Dropkick sends Hulk outside as there’s a ladder swing just hanging there as Muta uses it to run & hit Hogan as he hits him with a chair to follow sending him back inside. The ref struggles to get the chair from Muta as Hogan clocks him with a clothesline, he grabs the chair from the ref (shoving him down) as MUTA MISTS HIM! Muta goes up top for a dropkick, misses as Hogan hits a legdrop 1…2…KICK OUT!!! He hits a big boot & clothesline 1…2…3! This moved at a snail’s pace early, but I dug it by the end simply because of who it was. Two legends in different companies, clashing.\n\nManabu Nakanishi vs Bob Sapp\n\nOctober 14, 2002\n\nNakanishi tries to shoot a double leg immediately, but Sapp powers him clear over his head & plants him with a powerbomb as he poses for the crowd while Nakanishi sells it like death outside & teases getting counted out. He beats the count, rolls in & gets a double leg takedown, unloads shots, but Sapp grabs him by the throat, gets full mount & rains down punches. 5 referees jump in the ring to pull Sapp off of Nakanishi, but don’t DQ him. Nakanishi gets up, hits running knees & shoulder blocks, but Sapp no sells and drops him with a shoulder block & big time tackle. He clotheslines Nakanishi to the floor & heads out after him. He tries for another tackle, but Nakanishi hops on his back for a sleeper, but Sapp powers him into a Torture Rack & tosses him inside. The power of Sapp is fucking insane. Nakanishi tries for a German, but Sapp fights out. Nakanishi powers Sapp up into a Torture Rack of his own, Sapp punches out & gets hit with a Samoan Drop as a result. Nakanishi with a chop off the top, they collide with dueling clotheslines & SAPP WITH A DROPKICK sends Nakanishi flying outside! He tries to make it back in, but can’t as Sapp wins by countout. I tell you what, Bob Sapp was green as all hell, but he’s so visually impressive & the little he does do, it’s so great. How Vince didn’t sign him is beyond me. I know there were talks at some point, but damn, judge me if you want, Bob Sapp ruled.\n\nThis round involves some future legends in their Young Lion days, as well as some names I never knew wrestled in New Japan. Also we get a El Gigante special against a future NJPW legend and finally Flair vs Inoki.\n\nKeiji Mutoh vs Tony St. Claire\n\nChallenge Spirit 85\n\nSeptember 18, 1985\n\nYoung lion Mutoh well before he was The Great Muta! Tony works the arm out the gate, but Mutoh dropkicks his way out of it, but Tony with a side headlock takedown. Mutoh up, shoulder tackle, knee drop, elbow drop, but St. Claire pops up, only for Mutoh to get the headlock takedown. Reversal into a sleeper by Tony, but he lets go to hit uppercuts & a high knee. Head scissors applied, but Mutoh escapes into a face lock, then leaping elbow & snap dropkick. Half crab, but Tony gets the ropes, so Mutoh gets him up, hits a dropkick sending Tony to the floor & Mutoh with a slingshot plancha! St. Claire suckers him to the floor & tosses him into the railing, then suplexes Mutoh back in for 2. Mutoh ducks a back elbow, hits a cross body for 2 of his own, then sinks in a head scissors. St. Claire escapes like Mutoh did earlier with a leg lock. He drags Mutoh up, hits a hard clothesline for 2, uppercuts, another high knee, bodyslam for just 1. Reversal of an Irish whip to the corner as Mutoh hits what’d become his signature springboard handspring elbow, then moonsault 1…2...NO! St. Claire up, hits a back elbow, avoids a back drop attempt, school boys Mutoh 1…2…3! Your standard slow paced match that had its moments. Pretty cool to see Mutoh before he became the legend we would know.\n\nShinya Makabe vs Hiroshi Tanahashi\n\nFall In Black 99\n\nNovember 1, 1999\n\nYoung lions Makabe & Tanahashi here as they lock up with Makabe working the arm to take Tana down. He tries for a kimura, but Tana holds on, so Makabe transitions, but Tana bridges out & gets a head lock. Makabe escapes into one of his own; Tana shoots him off, but eats a shoulder tackle. Makabe with a Half Crab, but Tana fights to the ropes. They trade stiff slaps as Makabe wins that exchange as he keeps slapping Tana to the corner, then switches to kicks. Tana shows fighting spirit, dropkicking Makabe down & puts the boots to him. Big bodyslam as he sinks in a full Boston Crab, but Makabe uses his leg strength to flip Tana over. They trade forearms & slaps with Makabe again winning. Multiple bodyslams, but Tana fires back with forearms, only for Makabe to hit a Spear 1…2…NO! Kimura applied by Makabe as Tanahashi taps! I dig these young lion matches with future legends & top guys of New Japan. They’re short, but seeing how far they’ve come in their NJPW journey is really cool.\n\nShinsuke Nakamura & Michiyoshi Ohara vs Tadao Yasuda & Kazunari Murakami\n\nWrestling World 2003\n\nJanuary 4, 2003\n\nThis is the first match of Nakamura’s on the site (the second overall listed on ProFightDB) as Nakamura with a double leg immediately on Yasuda, who pops up & stomps away at the bandaged head & Nakamura is already bleeding 30 seconds into the match! It’s just boots & punches by Yasuda, who tags Murakami, who throws some punches, toying with Nakamura, who fights back only to be smacked down. They take turns just wearing Nakamura down & all Ohara can do is break up submissions & ground & pound long enough for Nakamura to fight back. Finally he tags in & hits a flying clothesline on Murakami. They trade chops & kicks before Ohara with a chokeslam for 2. Yasuda in with a front face lock, but Ohara escapes, tags Nakamura in, who spears Yasuda down, but he gets a low blow to take control. Butterfly suplex & a Tiger suplex 1…2…NO! Ohara trips up Murakami as Nakamura sinks in a cross arm breaker on Yasuda, who is so tall he gets the ropes. Nakamura with a corner dropkick as Ohara nails a vertical suplex, Nakamura with a release German 1…2…NO! Guillotine is sunk in as Yasuda fades & he passes out! Nakmaura, rocking the crimson mask, is victorious in his earliest NJPW match.\n\nHirooki Goto vs Hisashi Yamamoto\n\nWrestling World 2004\n\nJanuary 4, 2004\n\nNext up in the Young Lion matches here is Goto, who eats a shoulder tackle, but he gets full mount, arm breaker as Yamamoto gets the ropes. Goto gets caught in a leg lock, but counters into one of his own, that Yamamoto kicks out of, but has to grab a rope when Goto gets a half crab. Headlock takedown by Goto, who traps the arm, but Yamamoto gets up and starts throwing forearms as both men take bumps, Yamamoto gets the last one & a 2 count. Hip toss into an arm breaker by Yamamoto, but Goto gets the ropes. Brutal dropkick gets Yamamoto 2 as he gets a Boston Crab, but Goto again gets the rope break. We get a chop battle, but Goto hits a dropkick off of it, then one in the corner for good measure. Overhead belly to belly before locking in a Boston Crab of his own, which Goto has deep & won’t let Yamamoto get the ropes, so he taps! For what it was, this was a pretty fun back & forth of young lions.\n\nJushin Liger vs Dave Finlay\n\nFebruary 5, 1991\n\nLiger does a somersault flippy deal to get out of an arm bar early as Finlay dishes out uppercuts & a dropkick to take control early. We go outside fast as it’s all the Bruiser, who just repeatedly chucks Liger into the railing. Liger barely beats the count as Finlay hits a wonky back drop, then just drives the elbow into the face over & over. Liger reverses & Irish whip, hits a spin kick sending Finlay outside, tries for a baseball slide, but misses & crashes and burns. Finlay sends him face first into the post & heads back inside. Slingshot stomp to the head as the Bruiser mocks the crowd. Big time superplex by Finlay borders on a super brainbuster for a 1…2…NO! Bodyslam & a Vader Bomb out of the corner gets another close 2 as he sinks in a half crab before letting go, grabs a headlock, only for Liger to hit a back drop suplex & a corner dropkick. Liger tries for a corner cross body, but misses & Finaly goes up top, but gets cut off. Liger with a Superplex of his own 1…2…NO! Top rope cross body, but Finlay rolls through it 1…2…Liger kicks out. He wallops Liger with a clothesline for another 2, connecting with his Tombstone piledriver 1…2…KICK OUT! Finlay to the top, but misses a diving headbutt badly. Liger gets a reverse waistlock & Finlay mule kicks him right in front of the official, tries it again, but Liger avoids it & hits a Koppo Kick to the back. German Suplex with a bridge 1…2…3!! In no shape a blow away match, but a fun 10 minute match between two guys I’ve never seen wrestle before.\n\nShinya Hashimoto vs Mike Enos\n\nFighting Spirit 95\n\nFebruary 3, 1995\n\nAnother name I had zero clue wrestled in New Japan. Blake Beverly attacks before the bell with double axe handles & corner splash, tossing Hashimoto outside & hits a leaping kick off the apron! Holy shit he’s taking it to Hashimoto with a bodyslam on the concrete & whips him into the railing. Back inside the momentum stops though as he slaps on a rest hold. That was fun while it lasted as Hashimoto gets up & attacks the arm. They brawl into the corner as we get a trading of kicks from Enos & punches by Hashimoto before Enos goes back to the dreaded chinlock. Enos nails a clothesline & big legdrop for 2 as he slams Hashimoto down, tries for a slingshot senton, but misses. Superkick by Hashimoto, who starts punting Enos in the chest & hits a spin wheel kick 1…2…NO! Enos hits a suplex out of nowhere, then a powerslam for 2. OVERHEAD BELLY TO BELLY by Enos gets him another 2 as he follows that up with a Fall Away Slam on the big man! Enos poses before diving off the top & Hashimoto hits a enzugiri, then hits a super sloppy DDT, then hits a proper one (that the camera misses) for the 3. Aside from the last move being botched, this was virtually all Mike Enos, which baffled me, but delightfully surprised me. Shout out to the Shaker Heights, Ohio native. I’m sure Beau would be proud.\n\nEl Gigante vs Yuji Nagata & Tadao Yasuda\n\nFebruary 4, 1995\n\nAnother one of those weird matches I never knew existed. Straight up comedy to start with Nagata bailing immediately as Yasuda took the early punishment. Gigante teased a test of strength with Nagata, who is bumping all over the place for Gigante. Nagata & Yasuda fight back and hit a double dropkick knocking the big man down for 2 as Gigante gets up & gets the Claw on Nagata for the 3 count. This was a quick squash handicap, but seeing a legend like Yuji Nagata in his early days in there with someone the size of Gigante, I couldn’t skip this one.\n\nRic Flair vs Antonio Inoki\n\nApril 29, 1995\n\nBoth men very hesitant to start as Flair gets a headlock takedown, but Inoki with a head scissors escapes & gets a kimura, but Flair to the ropes. Flair gets a cross arm breaker, but Inoki kicks him in the head to get free & we have a stalemate. Inoki puts the boots to Naitch in the corner as Flair bails outside to get a breather. Back inside Flair gets a boot & dishes out some corner chops, then boots Inoki to the floor. He hangs Inoki throat first on the top rope as we spill outside where Flair posts Inoki. Big time suplex brings Inoki back in as Flair gets 2. Atomic drop to the knee as Naitch gets a modified Regal Stretch, but he lets go to chop block Inoki to the mat. Flair locks in the Figure Four as Inoki is screaming in pain in the center of the ring. Inoki finally gets the ropes, so Flair tries again, gets rolled up for 2, then Inoki battles & gets a backslide 1…2…NO! We need more backslides in current wrestling. They start unloading punches with Inoki winning that battle & Flair bumping all over as the crowd cheers for Inoki. Flair takes his corner bump to the outside as he slowly gets back inside & begs Inoki to stop, but boots him. Flair goes to the top, you know what happens next, he gets caught & tossed. Dropkick by Inoki gets 2 as they continue exchanging rights & lefts as Flair slams him down, hitting a big elbow for 2 of his own. Picture perfect back suplex, but Flair sells it too for some reason as it took him forever to get a cover for 2. Flair tries a bodyslam, but Inoki escapes, hits a Koppo Kick & a top rope knee drop, then enzugiri clips Naitch 1…2…3!! Very slow start, but once it got going, it wasn't a blow away classic or anything, but seeing these two mat wrestle was entertaining.\n\nWe take a detour of New Japan matches to go to the WCW F show Prime hosted by Dusty Rhodes & Chris Cruise. Like I said in my last post, Dusty is having a blast on this show, despite the matches being pretty God awful. Dusty loves busting Cruise's chops & gets sidetracked nearly every match by something different. There is also something called The Prime Cut Match of the Week, which Dusty refers to as The MOO Match of the Week and he lets out a huge MOOOOOOOO before they throw it to the ring. It's amazing.\n\nThese shows are so much fun to recap because the wrestling is awful, but that's usually the last thing you're paying attention to on a F show, especially one you never knew existed until 48 hours ago. So I have no clue how many of these I'll do, but enjoy the wrestlecrap that was WCW Prime! MOOOOOOO!!\n\nDave Sullivan vs Johnny Swinger\n\nSeptember 18, 1995\n\nTHE MOO OF THE WEEK, the main event, prime cut match as Dusty lets out a big MOOOOO as a mustachioed Johnny Swinger gets sent to the corner with jabs & a shuffle, then back elbow by the former Equalizer. Big back body drop as the crowd is dead as Evad (Dave backwards, get it?) misses a splash & Swinger chokes away, kicks him in the belly welly as Dusty eggs him on. Swinger is dancing in the ring as Hacksaw Duggan is coming down the aisle, with a taped fist & lays out Swinger with Sullivan taking the ref. He covers Swinger for the win. I have zero idea why Duggan was there & zero idea what is wrong in the noggin with Evad Sullivan. He was the babyface & cheated to win.\n\nSabu vs Harry New Baker\n\nSeptember 25, 1995\n\nThis was Sabu’s WCW Debut as did you know he was “The Warrior of the 90s”? That’s what Dusty calls him as Baker’s haircut is what scares Dusty, not Sabu, who murders Baker with a clothesline right away. Bulldog by Sabu, who nails a springboard legdrop for 2. Bodyslam & somersault legdrop as he hits another slingshot legdrop for a close 2. Dusty keeps calling him New Berry, Chris Cruise keeps calling him out on it & Dusty scolds him. Victory Roll by Sabu gets 2, who hits a head scissors to take Baker outside. Slingshot somersault senton wipes Baker out, then does a slingshot hurricanrana as well. Sabu hits an Arabian Moonsault in the ring (landing on his head in the process) for the win. Dusty compares him to Cactus Jack, who hasn’t worked for them in over a year.\n\nThe Man of Question vs Barry Houston\n\nOctober 30, 1995\n\nIt’s this week’s “moo match of the week” prime cut, main event, as he’s wearing a witches hat & there’s a goblin wearing a pumpkin & they both moo at the screen. Man of Question is Hugh Morrus with questions marks drawn on the side of his head. I really only watched this match because of Dusty wearing the witches hat, so you know what you’re getting here, Morrus picks Houston a part, gets multiple rest holds (in a squash), Houston fights back briefly, but Morrus hits his No Laughing Matter moonsault, which Chris Cruise says is in the shape of a question mark (what??) for the win.\n\nStar Blazer vs Big Train Bart\n\nNovember 6, 1995\n\nThe Moo Match of the Week as Dusty & Cruise bad mouth Johnny Boone for no showing & Dusty says he’s going to crack the whip if he crosses him. Tim Horner is Star Blazer and Bart is just a dude with a gimmick. Why I’m recapping this and I highly suggest watching this, is Cruise & Dream try to pronounce Japanese women’s wrestlers names from World War 3. Akira Hokuto (Kirakuka ugh… says Dusty), Bull Nakano, Cutie Suzuki, Mayumi Ozaki (“yeah, your mama too”, haha love Dusty). Blazer wins the match with a flying teabag off the top & does a little dance. My goodness, Dusty Rhodes trying to say Japanese names is the best thing ever.\n\n10 Man Battle Royal\n\nDave Sullivan, Nasty Ned, Disco Inferno, Cobra, Mark Starr, Frankie Lancaster, The Barrio Brothers, Sgt. Buddy Lee Parker & Lt. James Earl\n\nNovember 18, 1995\n\nThis was considered a preview of what you could expect at World War 3. You need to watch this solely for Dusty’s commentary, it’s hilarious. He’s telling guys to send the Barrio Brothers back to Cuba, screams at how The State Patrol are clubberin & he also popped for Nasty Ned. Disco is checking his hair in the camera as Frankie Lancaster is tossed. Dusty just picked Nasty Ned (WHO THE F*CK IS NASTY NED??) to win this. Cobra is eliminated & closer to becoming NWO Sting. Mark Starr was dumped out as I think Disco hasn’t thrown a single punch. The Barrios eliminate Dave Sullivan and just like that The Barrios are eliminated by The State Patrol, who break Dusty’s heart & dump Ned. Parker & Earl double team Disco, then argue who is going to eliminate him. They decide to do it together, but Disco becomes superhuman & dumps them both out at the same time to win it, he didn’t even realize he won it.\n\nWinner: Disco Inferno\n\nSuper Assassins vs Zebra Kid & Johnny Boone\n\nDecember 18, 1995\n\nThese are Warlord & Barbarian and are managed by Col. Robert Parker as Zebra Kid starts, but bounces off Barbarian & gets powerslammed down. Dusty questions whether the Assassins are Bunkhouse Buck & Dick Slater wearing blow up suits. I love you Dream. Warlord hit a gut wrench suplex, tags Barb with a boot of doom as here comes John Boone (brother of Pat Boone says Dust) who gets a mudhole stomped in him. During this action, Dusty asks Chris Cruise what he’s getting his wife for Christmas as the Assassins hit the Demolition finisher for the win.\n\nThe Yeti vs Barry Houston\n\nJanuary 29, 1996\n\nFrom the WCW Prime show as Yeti is dressed as a ninja (before he was Super Giant Ninja), yet Chris Cruise & Dusty are calling him “a Yeti who apparently is a Ninja”. Backbreaker immediately by Yeti, who presses Houston over his head with a slam, then bows to the official, haha. Pie faces Houston to the corner who does the boot to the throat & a karate chop. Houston gets a boot to the face, but runs into a tilt a whirl side slam for the win. Reason I watched this was the fact that it takes a lot to baffle Dusty, but he was. The Yeti dressed as a Ninja.\n\nCobra vs Lt. James Earl\n\nFebruary 25, 1996\n\nZero idea Cobra was still a thing, just a few months away from being NWO Sting. They said he took time off & Dusty said it was because Chris Cruise said he looked really bad at the end of 95. Dusty is just ribbing Cruise this whole match as he thinks Cobra is a former telephone operator when Cruise says he was a CIA operative. Earl hits a snap powerslam for 2 as Dusty says he’s getting word from his spy Manny Fernandez that James Earl….Dusty never finishes the thought, haha. Cobra hits a backdrop & backbreaker, then double chops Earl in the throat before hitting a Cobra Clutch Slam for the 3. Chris Cruise calls for a replay & Dusty says unenthused “you’re kidding.”\n\nJoey Maggs vs Maxx Muscle\n\nMarch 4, 1996\n\nIt’s Maxx who was already in the ring & Joey Maggs got an entrance and he’s managed by Teddy Long for some reason. Dusty said he would’ve hit an elbow & been to the back drinking a 6 pack within minutes if he was in this. Chris Cruise said Dusty never signs autographs, Dusty disagreed & said the only person he’s ever charged for an autograph was Hogan. Maxx hits a side suplex, misses a clothesline & gets hit with an enzugiri by Maggs (that name baffles Dusty) as Joey does a weird pinfall attempt, only to get clotheslined down. Cruise “Have you ever done an enzugiri?” Dusty “no, but I kicked guy in the face one time” as Maggs clips the leg of Maxx & gets a roll up for the win!\n\nShark vs Dave Sullivan\n\nMarch 11, 1996\n\nSo Dave Sullivan has hit pet rabbit, Ralph, with him & has a sped up Beverly Brothers theme. Dave throws some shots early & dodges a corner splash, so he throws some clotheslines, but Shark doesn’t go down. Shark is teetering & Dave shoves him with one hand & Shark bumps. Dave misses a splash, so Shark hits his powerslam, big elbow & then a wonky Black Hole Slam he calls the Shark Attack for the win.\n\nTo say that I'm addicted to WCW lower level shows is a massive understatement. If you don't like these reviews, might want to come back in a week or two, because you're going to get an ass load of Prime, Pro, Worldwide, Main Event & Saturday Night coming at ya in the distant future. I love squash matches & I love squash matches that make absolutely zero sense, which these shows deliver in droves. That said, let's go back to WCW Prime (there's still 10 more matches after this post too, so one more post of these before we switch to a different show). Time for some more MOOOOO Matches of the Week and time to hear Dusty say it, \"MoooooOOOOOOOooooo!!\"\n\nStunning Steve Austin (w/Col Parker) vs Scott Armstrong\n\nJune 26, 1995\n\n“Prime Cut means beef & beef means cows & cows mean Moo’ing!!” They trade mat wrestling with Armstrong getting the advantage early, firing rights, tries for a backdrop, but gets clocked with an Austin right of his own. Paint brush & boot laces rakes the face, but Austin misses a double axe off the top & Armstrong nails a dropkick. Austin gets a boot up in the corner & chokes him in the ropes as the Colonel chokes him with his handkerchief “in Texas we call it a BAN…DAN...AAAA” as Austin hits a Stun Gun, then a front face suplex (which is apparently his finisher?) for the win.\n\nJim Duggan vs Big Bubba Rogers\n\nJuly 3, 1995\n\nDream is getting revved up practicing his Moos, saying he heard this noise come from Tony’s house & didn’t know if it came from Lois, hahaha. These two literally circle each other for minutes as Bubba with a full arm dragon twist, but Duggan doesn’t sell it, so he reverses it & Bubba sells like a champ. Duggan snaps his suspenders as Bubba suckers him in with a test of strength & he throws right hands, but Duggan does the same. Bubba tumbles outside, pulls Duggan outside & we have a fight on the floor. Bubba eats the post & Duggan creams him with a right hand, rolls back in the ring and it’s a 10 count??? The world’s fastest 10 count, it went 90 seconds and it was a double countout.\n\nDiamond Dallas Page (w/Kimberly & Maxx) vs Scott Armstrong\n\nJuly 10, 1995\n\nOur Prime Cut Match of the Week Moooooo! DDP works the arm & trash talks Scott, getting a kiss from the Diamond Doll in the process as he eats a dropkick by Armstrong that sends him outside. Scott dives off the top, but Maxx catches him in mid air & drops him on the knee of DDP. Maxx tosses him back inside as Tony calls Maxx & DDP a gang “a gang isn’t 2 guys, its 50 guys, kickin yo bootay!” says Dream as DDP hits the Diamond Cutter for the win. “One woman beating you up Tony isn’t a gang!”\n\nKevin Sullivan (w/Shark) vs Mark Starr\n\nAugust 14, 1995\n\n“Are ya’ll ready for the Taskmaster Moo?” Sullivan attacks before the bell, but Starr fights back with a back body drop & arm drag; dropkick sends Sullivan to the floor. He tried to jump through the ropes & stumbled as he throws Taskmaster back inside & Sullivan gets a drop toe hold (seriously) as Starr tries wrestling him down for a 1 count. Starr works the arm for literally minutes, but gets dumped outside where Shark stands on him & posts him as well. They get to the apron & Starr tries for a sunset flip back inside & gets a 2 count. Shark clocks Starr from behind & Sullivan gets a standard suplex for the 3 count. It baffles me how Taskmaster was actually in the main event picture in 95.\n\nBunkhouse Buck & Dick Slater vs Los Especialitos\n\nAugust 21, 1995\n\nDusty is calling this the Prime Match of the Century. He’s talking in Dusty Spanish as he keeps mispronouncing Los Especialitos. The Barrio Brothers (Ricky Santana & Fidel Sierra) are the masked Especialistos as they say this is for the Tag Titles, but Buck & Slater didn’t walk out with titles, so this was clearly taped prior to them winning the titles. Dusty can’t say the word Especialisto and it’s fucking hysterical. He does get a little racist calling them jumping beans & says Slater did a little “flamingo dancing on his noggin”. He says Col. Parker is in love just like one of his bulls as Slater drops one of the masked men with a neckbreaker & elbow drop. Buck in & the tag champs hit a double right hand for the win. That’s it, they won with a punch. Came up a little short on being Match of the Century, eh Dream?\n\nCobra vs Dino Cassanova\n\nAugust 28, 1995\n\n“I don’t know if Cassanova can win if he’s full of tamales & tacos” says Tony Schiavone. Cobra works the arm as you can hear a pin drop in this arena. Cassanova has my dad’s haircut from 1990 as he applies a headlock, but Cobra hits a back suplex. I think 4 people cheered. Front chancery applied & a butterfly suplex, before hitting a throat chop & Cobra Clutch Slam (Tony called it “The Cobra Manuever!”) for the win.\n\nArn Anderson & Brian Pillman vs Todd Morton & Scott Sandlin\n\nDecember 4, 1995\n\nDusty makes Cruise corpse as he talks about chewin cud & lets out a big ol moooooo as Morton & Pillman work each other’s arms until Morton hits an armdrag & dropkick for a firey babyface start. Sandlin tags in, so does Double A and Arn immediately drops him. Dusty convinced his name is Stretch Armstrong; he says he’s been playing with that toy recently “Cody’s got one of them”. Pillman in & he’s choking & beating the crap out of Sandlin as the Horsemen take turns picking this dude apart. He plants him with a spinebuster, tags Pillman, who hits a big splash off the top for the 3.\n\nJohnny B. Badd vs Scott D’Amore\n\nJanuary 1, 1996\n\nEven with the bad video quality, Kimberly is a knockout. She was always one of my favorites. Anyways, hip toss on D’Amore & drop toe hold as Dusty criticizes Cruise for saying how pretty Kimberly’s teeth are. “Her TEETH?? Her teeth ain’t what I’m lookin at, man.” D’Amore eats a back elbow & Badd hits a slingshot leg drop, then dropkick sends the former Team Canada captain to the outside. Somersault senton, then a slingshot splash back inside for the victory. My goodness is Kimberly a smoke show.\n\nCraig Pittman vs The Gambler\n\nMarch 18, 1996\n\nAnother person I had no clue was managed by Teddy Long, but he’s there as Pittman hits a big time back suplex. They talk Booty Man vs DDP from the PPV and Dusty says “well, I don’t want to call The Diamond Doll loose, but…” as The Gambler takes control of the match, working the leg for like 20 seconds before Pittman takes back over. The Gambler cuts Pittman off before he gets clocked in the belly welly by a flying headbutt, as the Pitbull locks in the Code Red for the submission win. “I see a lot of Teddy Long in this guy, not physically of course.” Bahaha, Dusty is a gem.\n\nBarrio Brothers vs Mike Winner & Ric Garcia\n\nApril 1, 1996\n\nDusty yells “GLORIA ESTEFAN!” as Ricky Santana & Fidel Sierra as the match starts with Winner & Sierra trading pin attempts & Santana quickly in & taken down with an arm drag. Garcia in & works the arm, but Santana takes over. Garcia with a springboard off the ropes & Garcia does a slingshot plancha wiping out both Barrios. He says Garcia has a mustache like Gilbert Roland, “looking clean as a safeway chicken” as the Barrios take control of Winner back inside. Dusty is talking about how these guys can wrestle Harlem Heat, Road Warriors, Sting & Luger (ok, Dust) as the Barrios trade rest holds while Dusty talks about Barry Bonds. Cruise says Sierra is “near 300 pounds” as Dusty says “yeah, well I’m near 250, not telling you how far though”. Sierra gets rolled up by Garcia, but Santana hits a bulldog & the Barrios get the win.\n\nChris Kanyon vs Devon Storm\n\nApril 29, 1996\n\nKanyon is in his Men at Work heel tag team days as he says we’re all in a No Parking Zone, alright then. He attacks Storm before the bell & Storm hits a head scissors to the floor, then hits a top rope somersault dive. Back inside Storm with a second rope head scissors, then a hurricanrana out of the corner for 2. Kanyon gets backdropped to the outside & Storm does a MOONSAULT and smacks his face on the floor in the process. Dusty & Cruise are shocked as they turn into Vince and say “what a maneuver!” as Storm hits a side suplex, then a split legged moonsault 1…2…foot on the ropes by Kanyon. Storm goes to the top & hits a Blockbuster for the 3 count. This match was all Devon Storm, but it ruled, especially considering the turds we’ve seen on this show that’s saving grace is only Dusty.\n\nLifeguard Steve Collins vs Sgt. Buddy Lee Parker\n\nMay 27, 1996\n\n“Lifeguard got them Hooter drawers on” is how Dusty describes Collins. Dream talks about the Funk family for the start of this match, including Mother Funk as we’re bored to tears by the match taking place. Parker hits a double axe handle off the top rope (not the corner, but the middle of the ropes) down on the floor as he throws Collins back inside for a rest hold. Flying knee drop for a 2 count as Parker goes back to the rest hold, holy shit this is a snoozer. Not even Dusty can save this match as randomly Collins gets a small package for 3, then Parker pops up & they brawl to the back. The referee grabbed his lifeguard saver thing that David Hasselhoff always ran with on Baywatch, as he tried to separate them.\n\nSting & Lex Luger vs The American Males\n\nTag Team Titles\n\nMay 27, 1996\n\nWhat in the hell are Sting & Luger slumming it on this show for? Riggs hits a hip toss & some dropkicks and Luger oversells it like a mad man. Lex with a cheap shot & he destroys Riggs with offense in the corner, but Riggs fights back, only to get flattened with a lariat. We get tags by both partners as Bagwell gets an arm drag, bodyslam & 2 count, then goes back to the arm, tries for a slam, but Sting hits one instead, then deep arm drags of his own. Bagwell hits a Fisherman’s Suplex, but Lex punts Bagwell in the ribs to break it up, Sting with an Oklahoma Roll for the 3. That’s it. Sting did his face paint for that. Unfortunately Dusty was talking about Slamboree & didn’t throw in any funny lines in this one.\n\nThe final part of my WCW Prime rewatch (special treat for you at the end of this post). Up next, strap in kids, cause we got some fucking awful matches & amazing squashes on WCW Pro!\n\nLord Steven Regal vs Cobra\n\nJune 24, 1996\n\nDusty says the reason he talks so much on Prime is because he’s paid so much more than Chris Cruise as they talk about producers in the back & Dusty scolds Cruise for trying to call the action. Regal hits a cheap shot to cut off Cobra & he throws uppercuts before stomping on Cobra’s face. Cobra fights back with a backdrop, then hits the Cobra Clutch Slam 1…2…Regal with the foot on the rope. Cobra misses a splash & hangs himself up in the ropes as Regal slaps on the Regal Stretch for the win.\n\nJim Duggan & Craig Pittman vs Meng & The Barbarian\n\nJuly 1, 1996\n\nHacksaw & Pitbull taking on The Big Uglies as I think Pittman slapped Meng on the ass to start, which is fucking insane. I wouldn’t slap the ass of someone who has bitten someone’s nose off, but I digress. Reverse hammerlock by Pittman & Meng gets a rope break, but he hangs onto Pittman’s leg & we just stand in the ropes for like 20 seconds. This happens again, as Meng tried for a hair pull on a bald guy. This is confusing the hell out of me as Duggan gets in & hits Meng with “dem bowlin ball hands” as Duggan hits a lariat for 2, but Barb breaks it up. Pittman brawls with him, but gets kicked in the belly welly for his troubles & tossed outside. Match has fallen apart big time (it was never together) as Barb tries to hit Duggan with his 2x4, but Teddy Long wrestles it away from him as Duggan hits a taped fist punch on Barb for the win. Even in terms of WCW Prime, this match was the drizzling shits.\n\nRough & Ready (w/Col. Parker) vs Cobra & Bill Payne\n\nJuly 8, 1996\n\nI said this like a year ago, but I still can’t believe Cobra is still Cobra. NWO Sting is like a month away. Anyways he & Payne get a entrance, but Payne gets beaten up badly by Mike Enos & Dick Slater as the former Beverly hits a suplex outside & launches Payne back inside through the ropes. Slater drop a big elbow right on the face as Dusty & Cruise are talking about getting tickets for the Olympics. Dick Slater’s favorite Olympic sport is synchronized women’s water dancing. Mike Enos with a huge fall away slam off the second rope & Slater does some Junkyard Dog headbutts to follow. How do you follow that up? By applying a rest hold like a bear hug. Cobra jumps in & gets dumped just as quick as Enos hits a snap powerslam on Payne for the win. Cobra was in for 10 seconds maybe? This has to have been his last match as Cobra. Dusty says Col. Parker has found some youth, despite Dick Slater being like 50 at the time.\n\nRandy Savage vs Disco Inferno\n\nJuly 8, 1996\n\nDisco gets a hammerlock into a snapmare takedown as he thrusts as Macho, offers him his hand & Savage hits a cheap shot before slamming him down, goes for the top rope elbow & Disco bails to the floor to dance. He suckers Savage inside the ring with a neckbreaker for 2, but gets clocked with a back elbow by Savage, who hits the top rope elbow for 3. Can’t believe Savage got dressed for this.\n\nJoe Gomez vs Pat Tanaka\n\nJuly 15, 1996\n\nTanaka has Goldberg’s music, which is amazing. Gomez hits two arm drags, sloppy & a dropkick, even worse, as Tanaka makes him look like a million bucks selling it. Tanaka takes over, avoiding another dropkick & throws a super kick flush as he chokes away, then throws some kicks until Gomez hits a back elbow & a double chop before hitting a flying double hand chop for the win. Holy smokes I forgot how bad Joe Gomez was.\n\nJushin Thunder Liger vs Shinjiro Ohtani\n\nJuly 22, 1996\n\nWhat in the hell is this match doing on the F show? Unfortunately Dusty isn’t on the call; it’s Tenay & Cruise as Liger hits an enzugiri early, then works the arm. Ohtani with a spin kick, he does a Flair corner flip, but lands on the mat & knocks Liger down with a springboard dropkick. To the corner, Ohtani hits a hurricanrana 1…2…reversal by Liger 1…2…Ohtani kicks out. Liger blocks a suplex & turns it into a brainbuster for 2. Liger to the top, but misses an elbow as Ohtani hits a springboard wheel kick for 2 of his own. Corner Koppo Kick by Liger, who hoists Ohtani up for a Liger Bomb, then goes to the top & hits a big time splash for 3. This is the best match I’ve seen on Prime, which I know isn’t saying much, but these two shouldn’t have been thrown on this low of a show.\n\nBilly Kidman vs Psychosis\n\nAugust 12, 1996\n\nBell sounds & Dusty talks about being at a party with Susan Saran Wrap (Sarandon) & he’s trying to set her up with Chris Cruise. Dropkick to the floor by Kidman & plancha to follow (“a what? I had that to drink last night”), but Psychosis gets back in and hits a “Reverse…Back…Lariat…uh…Kick!” says Cruise, which makes Dusty giggle. Guillotine leg by Psychosis on a hung up Kidman in the ropes for a 2 count. They plug an appearance from The In Crowd, which was Alex Wright, Joe Gomez, The Renegade & Jim Powers (show of hands who knew that group existed?) as Dusty plugs The Moo Crowd. Powerbomb by Psychosis for another near fall, but Kidman hits a step up head scissors, up top Shooting Star Press 1…2…3! This was a really good little match.\n\nBraun the Leprechaun vs Chad Brock\n\nSeptember 9, 1996\n\nSo Braun was Buddy Lee Parker dressed as, you guessed it, a leprechaun. He attacks before the bell & brawls with Brock outside as he tosses him in, drops a knee repeatedly as Chris Cruise calls Brock “the singing cowboy” as Braun tries to crotch him on the ropes, but didn’t get it at all “whatever that was” they said on commentary as Braun drops a knee off the top for the 3. He then bites Brock on the chest, then bites the ref on the foot as Dusty is thankful that’s the only place he bit them. It’s shocking how that gimmick didn’t work.\n\nRey Mysterio vs Pat Tanaka\n\nOctober 7, 1996\n\nTanaka does a little dance to sucker Rey with a back fist to the dome. Rey gets a drop toehold, springboard head scissors, baseball slide & a springboard cross body! Rey tries for a rana back inside, but Tanaka powerbombs out & chop to the throat. Tilt a whirl countered by Rey, but Tanaka turns him inside out with a clothesline & a superkick for 2. Rey gets set up in the corner, but Rey kicks Tanaka away & he hits the Hurricanrana into the pin for 3. Way too quick of a match, this is one that should’ve gone a lot longer. Rey was really limping after that dive outside, so maybe it’s for the best. Dusty flat out called this match right down the middle.\n\nRoadblock vs Ron Studd\n\nNovember 2, 1996\n\nMy goodness what a pair here as the former Yeti hits corner forearms to start & HITS A DROPKICK sending Roadblock over the top to the floor!! Roadblock suckers him outside, but misses a splash against the post. Studd smacks his head before charging & hits his shoulder on the post (alright then). Back inside Dusty says Roadblock is trying to “uncle” Studd with an arm wringer as Studd avoids a back drop, throwing Roadblock down. Studd hits a fucking vertical suplex on Roadblock before going to the second rope & hits an elbow 1…2…3!! Was this match clunky, yes, but this was actually a fun hoss match.\n\nAnd to cap off WCW Prime, we leave you with a Dusty Compilation of him saying MooooOOOOOOoooo! This is just Part 1, there's actually 3 other compilations too. So 1 hour total. I love Dusty so much."
