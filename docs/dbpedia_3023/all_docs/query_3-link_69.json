        "text": "Historical accounts depicting Aterui, an indigenous Emishi from the Tōhoku region of Japan, vary greatly depending on the period in which they originated. Known colloquially as “The Tale of Aterui”, this historical event has been consistently reimagined in conflicting ways, often to resemble entirely different narratives, with fictitious characters added and entire events fabricated to advance the goals of different groups. This thesis is a historiographical analysis of the ways in which the narratives depicting Aterui differ both prior to and following the devastating earthquake, tsunami and nuclear disasters to strike the Tōhoku region in 2011. “The Tale of Aterui” was used early in its history as a tool to demonise the divergent Emishi culture in order to define and conceptualise the cultural boundaries of “self” compared to an imagined “other”. Similarly, the Meiji and Taisho periods (1868-1926) saw key elements of this historical event manipulated to support narratives of Japanese nationalism. Following the events of 2011, however, these narratives underwent many changes, challenging previously established notions of this event and discourses relating to the Tōhoku region as a whole. This thesis will examine these differences by exploring the historical contexts in which they appear while comparing narratives prior to the 2011 disasters with their depictions in popular culture thereafter. In doing so, this thesis will argue that the events of 2011 catalysed a nation-wide reversal of the discourses associated with both “The Tale of Aterui” and the Tōhoku region, repositioning previously demonised figures and challenging the status of many national symbols in the process.\n\nOur group of mud-diggers had been working for a couple of weeks in the spring of 2011 in Rikuzen Takata, one of the places on the east coast of Tohoku that was hit hardest by tsunami. The wreckage in this area was often overwhelming, with the insides of whole houses washed away and toxic black sludge washed in from the giant wave. They were doing whatever they could to help—moving pieces of breaking down pieces of junk furniture, moving the back side of a car split in two out of the living room, and digging this mud, lots and lots of mud. These were various students from Sophia University, undergraduate and graduate, Japanese and foreigner, including David’s own seminar students, most of them up in Tohoku for the first time. Hardly the place to begin experimenting with new media forms.\n\nDue to the lingering aftermath of a nuclear catastrophe being mostly out of sight, the peripheral victims of the Fukushima disaster were no longer able to discern the boundary between the here of the safety zone and the there of the afflicted area. What ensued after this geographical unification was psychological unity in which the harmony-conscious ethics of the Japanese were excessively fortified, formulating what is often called the code of wa (harmonious integration), which implicitly coerced all to speak from hisaisha no tachiba (the standpoint of the afflicted people). Kyoko Iwaki, a doctoral student at Goldsmiths, University of London, after fourteen years as a theatre journalist in Japan, provides in this article a socio-psychological analysis on how the code of wa materialized as the unwritten law after the catastrophe, and argues how in Current Location (Genzaichi), playwright-director Okada Toshiki grapples with this code by developing a post-Fukushima aesthetic. By pertinently using the apparatus of ‘fiction’ as a guise for relieving the audience of the code, Okada develops a theatre language that voices discord in content, yet accord in form, permitting the characters to speak both from the here and the there.\n\nOn 11 March 2011, a ‘triple disaster’ (an earthquake – the strongest since records began – a subsequent tsunami, and a nuclear accident at the Fukushima Daiichi plant) devastated the Tohoku region of north-east Japan. This singular yet predictable event has come to be called ‘3.11’, echoing the traumatic event of ‘9.11’. The disaster was predictable insofar as Japan, situated within the ‘ring of fire’ – an area approximately 40,000 km long in the basin of the Pacific Ocean, associated with frequent earthquakes and volcanic eruptions – has long experienced ecological hazards. This earthquake and tsunami left 18,000 people dead and thousands more injured. Over 340,000 people were displaced from their homes, as hundreds of thousands of buildings were destroyed. As this is a coastal and rural region, many livelihoods connected to fishing and agricultural production were obliterated overnight. A hundred and ten thousand residents in communities in and around the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear plant were officially evacuated immediately, and many more ‘voluntarily’ evacuated (without support from the government) because of concerns about the dangerous levels of radiation – a result of a nuclear ‘meltdown’ and subsequent explosions at Fukushima. To this day, only about half of the evacuees have returned home, a problem for the government since plans for recovery are based on people returning to their towns. By March 2018, the national government had ended financial support for the majority of nuclear evacuees. While decontamination projects actively removed tons of topsoil and debris, cycles of rain and wind continue to carry radiation across the region and, with it, uncertainty.\n\nThe chapter discloses the political potentialities of theatrical space through an in-depth evaluation of two post-‘Fukushima’ plays by Okada Toshiki, who gained reputation in Japan and abroad for his socially engaged theater. I focus on two performances taking an entirely opposite approach: While Unable to See (2012) is a harsh satire, written for a foreign audience in an informal setting, that looks at the precarious situation at the molten reactor from the short-term perspective, Current Location (Genzaichi, 2012) takes a rather long-term view addressing the fear of nuclear threat from the perspective of Tokyo inhabitants in the form of science fiction. Ultimately, the systematic repression of the anxiety and anguish caused by looming disaster seems as absurd as leaving the planet to escape to another world. Dwelling on the dispute of fuhyō higai (harmful rumor) the play reveals the deep fault lines running through post-disaster Japan. I am scrutinizing the significance of Okada’s recent concept of fiction as ‘recessive reality’ in his attempt to invite audiences’ critical engagement and argues for a major turning point in the work of Okada as triggered by the catastrophe.\n\nConsidering the massive scale of the multivalent disaster, one could argue that the Fukushima Dai-ichi Nuclear Power Plant Disaster, which occurred in 11 March 2011, did not drastically change the picture of society. However, when the event is transposed to the consideration of the theatre, the impact it had on the imaginations of the young theatre makers is conspicuous. Drawing a line between the theatres of the 2000s (zero nendai), which is known, alternatively, as the Lost Generation (Rosugene sedai), and, the theatres of the 2010s (ten nendai), most often labelled as the Pressure-free Generation (Yutori sedai), this paper will comparatively analyse, how, and why, the two ‘dialogic imaginations’, to borrow from Mikhail Bakhtin, differs between the former and the latter. As for the former, the paper will primarily refer to plays by Okada Toshiki, who was once dubbed as the theatre maker representing the voice of the Lost Generation. As for the latter, the paper will consider the works by Fujita Takahiro (b. 1985), who is considered to be one of the leading directors of the younger generation.\n\nIn recent years Japan has faced the rapid changes characterising the post-global world, vis-à-vis the economic crisis, as well as the new geopolitical equilibrium amongst the Asian countries after the economic and military rise of China. Moreover, the aftermath of the Fukushima disaster of March 2011 poses a series of questions about social solidarity and emergency management along with the problems of confidence in the national safety system that Japan has had to cope with. This volume is a collection of contributions on a project examining various aspects of such contemporary Japanese society in a period of changes in economic, political, and cultural fields. It comprises three sections: Japan&#39;s International Relations; Cultural Theory, Fine Art and Philosophy; Language and Communication.\n\nThe 2011 disasters precipitated widespread concern among heritage scholars about the fate of Tohoku’s cultural properties, tangible and intangible. Damage to not only buildings and landscapes but also ‘formless’ heritage, some worried, could weaken social infrastructure and thus slow or undermine recovery. Drawing on ethnographic fieldwork in, and critical heritage studies of, the disaster regions, this article proposes 3.11 has in fact stimulated the expansion of heritage regimes and their associated culture industries in the Northeast: what, following Gerald Suttles, I call ‘museumification’. I illustrate this through case studies of unmarked rituals becoming ‘unregistered heritage’, the ‘experientialization’ (taikenka) of declining industries, and preservation of ruined buildings as a new category of disaster heritage, shinsai iko. In all cases, museumification endows precarious folk arts, industries, and objects with a second life as assets through which locals can represent themselves not only to themselves, but also to tourists. This can help communities rebuild financially in the short-term. However, I argue that as a longer-term strategy for revitalizing regions, museumification amounts to building new economic structures around a ‘folk’ still vanishing due to the same political-economic forces driving heritage’s expansion pre and post-disaster."
