A new path has opened in Tohoku.

Its name is “Michinoku Coastal Trail.”

It is a very, very long path that runs along the majestic Pacific Ocean. Here, you can experience the bounties of both forest and sea.

Nature, born from the bonds between forest, village, river, and the sea, and the stories spun therefrom, are the beauty that exists only on this trail.

People’s lifestyles are passed on through this trail, and we hope they will ultimately be passed on into the future.

Paths become paths when people walk on them.

The “Michinoku Coastal Trail” will also become a path when the people who live in Tohoku and the people who visit Tohoku walk on it together.

Try walking in Tohoku, along this trail.

Walk side by side with Tohoku progressing towards rebirth.

The Michinoku Coastal Trail is a long trail that follows the Pacific coast from Hachinohe City in Aomori Prefecture to Soma City in Fukushima Prefecture.

“Michinoku” is the ancient name of the Tohoku area, and is still familiar as a nickname.

The biggest attraction is the abundance of spots you can experience dynamic views of the ocean.

There are a great variety of sights to see, like the most beautiful cliffs in Japan, the marvelous scenery of the rias coastline, the sheer abundance of the world's third largest fishing grounds and more.

Enjoy a time you will never forget as you follow the trail while feeling the sea breeze and the compelling beauty created by nature.
