Jean Case is an actively engaged philanthropist who, together with her husband Steve Case, created the Case Foundation in 1997. Jean spent her early days at the Case Foundation doing a deep-dive into philanthropy and seeking the best ways she could make a difference. After having success with some early initiatives (and learning some really valuable lessons!) Jean realized that she and Steve could make the biggest impact by centering the Foundation around many of the same entrepreneurial approaches they cultivated throughout their business careers. As Jean would be quick to tell you, a good investment is a good investment -- even if the way you measure a return changes somewhat as you move across sectors.

Prior to co-founding the Case Foundation, Jean was a technology executive in the private sector. As a senior executive at America Online, Inc. (AOL), Jean directed the marketing and branding effort that launched the AOL service, directed the communications strategy for taking the company public, and helped establish AOL as a household utility. Before joining the company when it was a small startup, she held strategic marketing positions at GE's Information Services Division and at The Source, the nation's first online service. We're pretty sure these early experiences played a role in making Jean a big fan of all things digital and the amazing potential of technology to change the world for the better.
