        "text": "Talent is everywhere, opportunity is not. Case Foundation CEO Jean Case highlights the importance innovators have played in the history of the United States and examines the state of entrepreneurship today. She notes that funding, mentoring and networking that fuels entrepreneurship presently favors white men, with only 10% of venture capital going to women, and less than 1% to African Americans and most investment going to just three states. Case argues there is a tremendous opportunity to seize by expanding access to capital by investing in women and entrepreneurs of color and sets forward a clarion call for all to join in on building an inclusive entrepreneurial ecosystem that would give everyone an equal chance at unlocking the American Dream.\n\nJean Case is an actively engaged philanthropist, investor and a pioneer in the world of interactive technologies. A passionate believer in all things digital and the amazing potential of technology to change the world for the better, Jean and her team focus the efforts of the Foundation around many of the same entrepreneurial approaches she and Steve cultivated throughout their business careers. In addition to her role as CEO of the Case Foundation, Jean is Chairman of the National Geographic Society Board of Trustees."
