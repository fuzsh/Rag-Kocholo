        "text": "Norma Jean (Case) Bearden, age 88, of Round Rock, joined the Lord and cherished loved ones Oct. 3, 2022, in the early morning.\n\nNorma was born Oct. 24, 1933, in Georgetown, to Walter M. Case and Annie Mae (Townsend) Case. She was the eldest of siblings Jackie L. (Case) Menefee and Roger Case. She attended Granger High School.\n\nNorma married the love of her life William Henry Bearden III, Dec. 9, 1950, in Taylor. They began the creation of their beautiful family soon thereafter. She was an incredible and loving mother to her four children, Billy, Dale, Darrell, Glen and Janet.\n\nNorma had a huge heart for children, made apparent from her time and dedication to fostering throughout the years, working for a Lutheran daycare, starting her own in-home daycare where she was absolutely adored, and spending as much time with her 11 grandchildren and (soon to be) 12 great grandchildren.\n\nBetween family camping trips, domino and card nights, being a member of the Hutto First Baptist Church, a certified Old Settler living in Williamson County her entire life and hosting many memorable holiday gatherings, she also spent nine dedicated years at Farmers State Bank, and with her husband W.H.â€™s own company, Hutto Lumber.\n\nNorma was a beacon of her family and community and will be missed immensely.\n\nNorma was preceded in death by her husband of 47 years, William Henry Bearden; her parents, Walter and Ann Case; sister, Jackie L. Menefee; son, Darrell G. Bearden; as well as her grandson Joshua Lashley.\n\nShe is survived by her children, Billy Bearden and wife Benna, Dale Bearden and wife Raya, Glen Bearden and wife Sherry, and Janet Bearden Sees and husband Dale; brother-inlaw, D. Menefee; grandchildren, great-grandchildren and many who loved her dearly. Visitation will be held Oct. 14, from 5 to 7 p.m. at Providence Funeral Home in Taylor. A funeral service will take place Oct. 15, at 10 a.m. Pall bearers in attendance will be Nick Lashley, Blake Bearden, Byron Bearden, Max Bearden, Derek Hartmann, Jeff Gallagher, Tyler Shelton, Christopher Ruiz and Gareth Trimarco."
