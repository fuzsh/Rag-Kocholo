        "text": "Geneva Jean Case Smith, of Adamsville, TN, formerly of Paragould, died Monday, August 19, 2013, at McNairy Regional Hospital in Selmer, TN at the age of 85. She was born July 24, 1928 in Paragould, Arkansas the daughter of the late William M. and Dora Maggie Case. She was united in marriage to the Reverend Stanley B. Smith in 1955, who preceded her in death in 1988. She was a member of the First Presbyterian Church in Adamsville, Tennessee. Mrs. Smith was a loving wife, sister, mother and Na`Na` to her grandchildren. By trade she was a licensed cosmetologist and rarely left home without her red lipstick, Maybelline, and high heels. A devoted ministerâ€™s wife, Mrs. Smith spent many years leading bible studies, teaching Sunday school and singing in the church choir. She could spend days browsing in any shopping mall or discussing \"friendly\" politics over a fresh cup of coffee. Mrs. Smith was full of life and made hundreds of friends during her time; but those who knew her best will remember her classic beauty, quick wit and sassy energetic personality. In addition to her parents and husband, she was preceded in death by three brothers, Olan and Leon Case of Paragould and Frank Case of Colorado Springs, Co; four sisters, Lamora Case, Delores McCallon and Opal Watters of Paragould and Opha \"Millie\" Greenwell of Chicago, Illinois. She is survived by her daughter, Jeani Gilchrist and husband Keith of Adamsville, TN; son: Mark Smith of Adamsville, TN; granddaughter, Nicole Gibbs and husband Daniel of Cleveland, TN; grandson, Canon Smith of Adamsville; several nieces and nephews; and special friends, the Farris family of Horn Lake, Mississippi. The family will receive friends from 12:00 PM to 2:00 PM, Thursday, at Heath Funeral Home in Paragould. Her life will be celebrated, following visitation Thursday, at 2:00 PM, in Heath Colonial Chapel, with Rev. Eddie Hathcoat officiating. Interment will follow at Linwood Cemetery. Memorials may be sent to the American Diabetes Association, Always, Forever, Memorial and Honor, North Canton, OH 41720 or St. Jude's Childrens Research Hospital, Po Box 1000, Dept 142, Memphis, Tennessee.
