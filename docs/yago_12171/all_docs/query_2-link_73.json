        "text": "Synopsis\n\nA rumour has been doing rounds on social media stating that renowned comedian and host Steve Harvey and his wife Marjorie are getting divorced. Here’s the truth about it.\n\nAmidst a flurry of events, Steve Harvey finds himself at the center of attention, with both genuine and fabricated stories circulating across social media platforms. The renowned comedian and TV personality is grappling with two distinct incidents that have captured the public's interest and sparked conversations on various fronts.\n\nDeparture of Social Media Manager Stirs Controversy\n\nSteve Harvey's name took a prominent place on Twitter as discussions erupted over the apparent firing of his social media manager. The incident was prompted by a tweet that had been posted, soliciting responses about comedians who fail to induce laughter. The unexpected negative tone left followers perplexed and fueled speculation. In response.\n\nHarvey took to video to share his perspective and reveal the management change, expressing his disbelief over the tweet's content.\n\nHarvey clarified, \"My whole brand is to be motivational, and I'mma turn around a say something like that? You don't know where these young people [are] at in they career, man. They could be coming up or anything. I'm all about positivity; I would've never done nothing like that.\"\n\nFalse Divorce Rumors Spread Online\n\nAs the digital realm continued to buzz with discussions about Harvey's social media shift, false rumors began to circulate about his marriage to Marjorie Bridges. Reports claimed that Bridges was seeking a divorce due to an alleged extramarital affair involving their chef and bodyguard.\n\nHowever, these allegations were debunked by Ned Nwoko, a Nigerian businessman who identifies himself as a friend of Harvey's.\n\nIn a statement addressing the unfounded claims, Nwoko stated, \"Fake news has been taken to new heights all over the world and this is so unfortunate. We experience this practically everyday and so when we read about our friend Steve Harvey and his lovely wife having issues, we had to contact Him and He confirmed that he and his wife are very much okay and it's all fake news and should be disregarded. The family is happy together and we wish them all the best.\"\n\nSteve and Marjorie: A Journey Together\n\nSteve Harvey's personal journey has been a subject of interest for many. His rise to fame began in the early 1980s as a standup comedian, and over the years, his popularity has soared. He has not only hosted popular shows but has also become a household name. Throughout his life, Harvey has embraced different roles, including being a husband and father.\n\nMarjorie Bridges has been an important part of Harvey's life, as the two exchanged vows in 2007. The bond they share remains strong, and they've weathered the storms of life together. The allegations of divorce circulating online have been categorically dismissed by Harvey's friend Nwoko, adding clarity to the situation.\n\nFAQs\n\nWhat is Steve Harvey's wife famous for?\n\nBorn on October 10, 1964, Marjorie Elaine Ridge-Woods came into the world as the daughter of Doris Bridges. She has established herself as a designer, stylist, Instagram sensation, and is also renowned as the wife of the prominent presenter Steve Harvey. Her zodiac sign is Libra.\n\nWhy did Lori change her last name to Harvey?\n\nFollowing Marjorie and Steve's union in marriage, Steve went on to formally adopt Morgan, Jason, and Lori. This gesture led to all three siblings adopting the Harvey surname. Although the idea of merging their families gave their children pause initially, Marjorie offered them the perfect words of reassurance and encouragement.\n\n(You can now subscribe to our Economic Times WhatsApp channel)\n\nDisclaimer Statement: This content is authored by a 3rd party.
