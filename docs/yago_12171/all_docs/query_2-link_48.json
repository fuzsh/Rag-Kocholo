        "text": "Steve Case is the owner of Acropolis Realty Group, Acropolis Development, Acropolis Property Management and a few other similarly named companies. They are among the entities for his work in residential leasing and sales, real estate development, property management, and commercial leasing and sales.\n\nCase, often in partnership with other local developers, has taken on re-development of several well-known buildings in and near downtown Syracuse. The projects usually combine residential, office, and retail spaces. One of them, The Whitney Lofts at 321-323 S. Salina St., is a stop on this year’s Downtown Living Tour.\n\nThe self-guided walking tour to eight locations takes place 11 a.m. to 4 p.m. May 18. Tickets are on sale for $12 through May 16. They cost $15 on May 18 at the tour’s starting point in the City Hall Commons Atrium, 201 E. Washington St.\n\nCase, who grew up in Baldwinsville, started Acropolis in 2015. It’s grown to nine full-time employees and about 32 real estate agents.\n\nAnother of Case’s projects is at Salina and Jefferson streets. It will be called Acropolis Center, and he’ll move his growing group from Armory Square into 7,000 square feet of office space. “We’re exploring options to build on top of that building because residential is still booming downtown,” Case said. “People are moving here like crazy, and I don’t see any sign of it slowing down.”\n\nFirst, tell me about your stop on the tour.\n\nIt's called The Whitney Lofts. I'm very proud of it. We've leased 14 out of 16 apartments.\n\nIt started when a friend of mine from business school, Ryan Benz, called me up and said: Hey Steve, I'm looking to move back.\n\nHe had moved to Brooklyn and was working in New York City. Like so many of us boomerangers, you go out, live in a bigger city, and end up coming back home to Syracuse. They’d just gotten married. They're having their first child.\n\nSo Ryan came back to Syracuse and wanted to start a restaurant. We looked at buildings, and he picked out 321 S. Salina St. My office then was in the Landmark Theatre building, and I’d look at this building every single day for like seven years. I saw it through a new lens of having a potential retail tenant. We walked through the building and quickly realized that we needed two means of egress to make apartments work on the upper floors. The only way to do that was to also buy the building next door, 323 S. Salina St. All of a sudden this nice small project became a little bigger and we’re buying two buildings.\n\nRyan’s vision was creating a restaurant (Oh My Darling) on the ground floor and a cool 1920s Prohibition-style speakeasy (The Fitz) in the basement. The building already had history and charm. It was built about 1856 and was the Park-Brannock Building, where the Brannock foot-measuring device was invented. We maintained a lot of the historic character. For instance, when you go down into the basement, the original steam-powered elevator lift still sits there.\n\nWe're a rest stop on the tour this year. When people come in, they can get a refreshment at the restaurant and then make their way to the upper floors. We're hoping to make three units available for people to see.\n\nAll the units are different. Two have balconies off of Bank Alley. Two on the top floor have skylights in the master bedroom. We were able to save a lot of the original hardwood floors, a lot of the original tin ceilings.\n\nYou’re leading a company, and you’re one of the leaders in downtown living. What’s your advice to be a good leader?\n\nFirst and foremost, a leader has to have a vision and has to know where the company's going to be able to lead effectively.\n\nIt's important to listen to your employees. That's one thing that I spend time doing and I want to get even better.\n\nGood leaders ask great questions. I read a lot of leadership and management books, and I’m a big John Maxwell guy. One of his books is “Good Leaders Ask Great Questions.”\n\nThat means really listening to what your employees and your agents are saying. You hear what their needs are. Every time we finish a team meeting I say: What can I do to help you guys sell more? They've got great ideas.\n\nI’ve talked to folks in some companies where ideas get shut down real quick because maybe their boss or the owner of the company wants to do it his way. I come from the mindset that I don't know everything, and I don't know what I don't know. A lot of my people have different backgrounds and experiences and bring valuable information on how to take Acropolis to that next level.\n\nSo it’s important for leaders to listen, to effectively communicate, to be available.\n\nEffective listening is important. So is staying humble. Humility is very important in a leader.\n\nSome people go into leadership positions because they want the title.\n\nLeadership is more than a title.\n\nAnybody can be a boss, but not everybody can lead.\n\nJust because a person has a title doesn't mean they've gained trust and respect.\n\nIt’s important for whatever group you're leading to really buy in. They're going to listen to what you have to say if they like you and trust you.\n\nIf you're just their boss, they may do what they're told. But at the end of the day, effective leadership comes from trust and respect.\n\nWhen you see an effective leader – somebody who’s more than just a boss – what qualities do you see?\n\nA good leader takes responsibility and accountability when things go wrong and has the selflessness to share credit when things go right. It’s very much like a coach of a team, right? When you lose a game, you got to take the blame. When you win the game, you got to give your hats off to your team.\n\nThat's important in business as well. Your team sees that, and they appreciate and respect you for that.\n\nIt's OK to give praise. I think it’s important to let people know that they're appreciated – at all levels.\n\nPeople that are working hard need that pat on the back. As much as they might say that they don't need it, it's always good for them to hear it.\n\nSo I think good leaders give praise when it's due. They hold themselves accountable when things aren't going right. They stay humble. Those are some of the qualities of a leader.\n\nI've heard people tell me being in charge can be lonely. Where does a leader go for support?\n\nThat's a great question. You don’t want to exude the stresses and burdens of leadership to the team. You don't want to let anybody know what you're going through because it will affect them.\n\nLast year, I realized I need somebody to talk to about this. I hired a business coach. I attended a business-coaching program that went for six months. I'm in an executive breakfast club. It’s owners of local companies. We meet once a month and share our issues and challenges and talk it through. It's good to hear other people's problems and know how they were able to overcome them.\n\nWhen you see poor leadership, the kind of boss nobody wants to work for, what attributes do you see?\n\nIn poor leadership, factors like ego come into play. Poor leaders have the mindset that it's my way or the highway.\n\nI talked to somebody recently to kind of pick her brain about business and how the company where she works does things. And she said: You know, I bring things up and I bring them to my boss and I have all these ideas and they get shut down every time.\n\nThat struck a chord with me – that's not how a good company should be run.\n\nPart of innovating is listening. I want to listen to employees and agents and see how we can make Acropolis better today. What can we do to make us better next week? Poor leaders don't have that mindset.\n\nTell me about early influences and early leadership roles.\n\nI grew up in Baldwinsville. I started playing sports early on in life. My parents (Yvonne and Steve) had me playing a little bit of everything. I dabbled in soccer, track, and even a short stint trying some football, but lacrosse was my go to sport. I come from a competitive family, and I was super competitive. These are team sports and I learned quickly it wasn’t just me who's going to be able to win the game. It's a team effort.\n\nI graduated from Baker High School in 2003. I played lacrosse in college at Bucknell. I was a midfielder. So I played middie for the first three years and was very offensive minded. I loved playing middie. And then senior year they asked me to play defense. I played d middie my senior year.\n\nIt was tough for me at first. My heart was into playing offense, and I loved assisting and scoring goals, and I loved to be a part of the offense. So switching that role and being on the defensive side of things was a total shift for me.\n\nI'm not going to lie – it took a little bit for me to buy in. But I realized that lacrosse is a team sport and it was important for me to be a team player and if the coach thought that the best way for our team to win was to put me as a d middie, then that's what I was going to do. It worked out great. I was all Patriot League d middie that year and we had a great season.\n\nMy dad had a Chrysler dealership – Case Chrysler – in Buffalo in the 1980s. And then he started Worldwide Motor Cars. That's something that I have really enjoyed watching – the entrepreneurial spirit that my dad has. He's never worked for anybody. He owned a new car dealership at the age of 24.\n\nWhen I graduated from Bucknell, my dad had some health issues at the time – he’s all good now. He asked me to help out and run the dealership. That was my first foray into any sort of leadership at a higher level. I'm a young kid right out of college and all of a sudden I'm thrown into this leadership position of having to run a dealership.\n\nAll the salespeople are looking at me, a 22-year-old kid, like, why the heck am I going to listen to you?\n\nPart of the reason why I was able to get through that barrier is because I didn't act like I was above them. I thought it was important that I treat everybody equally and that I was also able to produce. So not only was I out there in the trenches and we were all selling together, but I'd also be the first one out there cleaning off cars after a snow storm. I was everything from janitor to lot boy, a salesperson to general manager. We were a small company and we had to do it all.\n\nI learned that leadership isn't about sitting in your big chair in your office and sitting back and letting everybody do the work.\n\nYou need to earn the trust and the respect of the folks that are with you.\n\nI did that for a couple of years and realized I needed to go back to business school to actually learn what I'm doing. I always knew I wanted to get into real estate.\n\nSo I went to Whitman at SU, and that’s where I met Bob Doucette. Bob was my real estate professor at Whitman. I learned what Bob did with Armory Square and just loved everything about it. And I realized right then and there, this is what I want to do and I want to team up with this guy and figure out how he did what he did.\n\nI finished my MBA at Syracuse and came to work for Bob at Paramount Realty Group, for about four or five years until 2015.\n\nAs I'm sure you know, Bob is the original visionary pioneer behind Armory Square. So I worked on a lot of Bob's projects, with the Dey’s Plaza building, the Loews Building, Center Armory, and a number of other projects.\n\nI basically did everything – apartment leasing, commercial sales, you name it. I always wanted to start my own company. My goal was learning the ropes as best I could from Bob so I could branch out and start my own company. That's how Acropolis came to be.\n\nWhat’s the significance of the Acropolis name?\n\nI get that question quite a bit – no relation to Acropolis Pizza up on the Hill.\n\nI studied ancient Greek and Roman architecture in college, and Acropolis is the city on the hill in ancient Greece. So they’re essentially the first real estate developers, and they built something that has lasted throughout generations and is still partially standing today. On the development side, I want my buildings to last for generations to come."
