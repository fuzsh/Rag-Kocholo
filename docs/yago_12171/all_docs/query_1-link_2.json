        "text": "Steve currently serves as chairman and CEO of Revolution LLC, a Washington, D.C. - based investment firm he co-founded in 2005, where he partners with visionary entrepreneurs to build significant “built to last” businesses. Steve’s entrepreneurial career began in 1985 when he co-founded America Online (AOL). Under Steve’s leadership, AOL became the world’s largest and most valuable internet company, driving the worldwide adoption of a medium that has transformed business and society. Steve’s passion for helping entrepreneurs remains his driving force. He was the founding chair of the Startup America Partnership—an effort launched at the White House to accelerate high-growth entrepreneurship throughout the nation.\n\nJean is an actively engaged philanthropist, investor, and a pioneer in the world of interactive technologies. She spent more than two decades as an executive in the private sector, where she led marketing and branding efforts for AOL, before she and her husband created the Case Foundation in 1997. The Case Foundation is recognized for its innovative efforts to increase giving and catalyze civic and business participation, as well as promote innovation, collaboration, and leadership in the nonprofit sector. Jean serves on the National Geographic Society Board of Trustees, as well as on the boards of Accelerate Brain Cancer Cure (ABC2), SnagFilms, and BrainScope Company, Inc. She also serves on the advisory board of the Harvard Business School Social Enterprise Initiative and the Brain Trust Accelerator Fund.\n\nJean and Steve joined The Giving Pledge, publicly reaffirming their commitment to give away the majority of their wealth to fund worthy charitable causes, and in the same year were named to Barron’s “25 Best Givers” list."
