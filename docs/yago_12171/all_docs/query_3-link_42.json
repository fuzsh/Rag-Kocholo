        "text": "Jean Elaine Hagans Case passed away Sept. 6, 2014, following a car accident on her 85th birthday. Jean was born to Frank and Velma Morris Hagans in Augusta, Kansas on Sept. 4, 1929. She moved to Marion at the age of one with her parents and older brother, Bob. Jean graduated from Marion High School with the Class of 1947. She attended Kansas State University, was a member of Delta Delta Delta social sorority, and graduated in 1951 with a B.S. degree in Home Economics.\n\nJean married her high school sweetheart, Alex Case Jr., on Aug. 21, 1952. She was proud to be a Navy wife, moving to Texas and California with Alex after their marriage and returning to live with her parents in Manhattan while Alex served in the Korean War and she awaited the birth of their first child, Deborra. In 1955, the family moved to the house in Marion where Jean lived for nearly 60 years. Soon after arriving in Marion, they added another daughter to their family, Diana, and later a son, Alex (Casey).\n\nJean was a care giver. She was a devoted wife and mother, creating a loving home for Alex and the children for the first 17 years of their marriage. For the next 20 years, she continued nurturing her family and expanded her focus to include caring for the education and well-being of the students she taught at Marion Elementary School. When her parents became ill, she moved them to Marion and cared for them daily for 14 years. Jean’s care giving abilities were especially evident as she devotedly cared for Alex during his 15-month struggle with cancer. After Alex’s death in 2001, Jean found a new mission of care giving, as she became a support and companion to friends as they lost their spouses or endured health challenges.\n\nJean was also an avid sports fan, following her two favorite teams, the Marion Warriors and the Kansas State Wildcats. She spent five consecutive decades supporting her three children and eight grandchildren at nearly every event they participated in from cheerleading to football, volleyball, cross country, basketball, baseball, and track and field. She was a KSU football season ticket holder for 43 years and rarely missed a home game. Jean was so thrilled to be honored with the Super Fan award at the MHS Athletic Banquet this spring.\n\nJean lived a life filled with service to family, friends, church, and community. She was a member of the Marion Presbyterian Church, serving in many capacities, including as an elder. She was also an active member of PEO, 20th Century, American Legion Auxiliary, St. Luke Hospital Auxiliary, and served on the board of Hilltop Manor. Jean enjoyed her Friday bridge club and playing bridge with other groups of friends. Jean’s friendships were always important to her – she made an effort to keep in touch with friends, both far and near, that she had made throughout her life. Jean was a gracious hostess — she enjoyed decorating her home and preparing food for family gatherings, holiday celebrations, evenings with friends, class reunions, bridge clubs, the annual May Day party, and many other occasions.\n\nWhen asked about the highlights of her life, Jean would always mention the traveling that she and Alex had done. Throughout their marriage, Jean and Alex shared a passion for traveling, and furthered their education and interest in history and genealogy through trips to all fifty states and many foreign countries, visiting all the continents except Antarctica. Another highlight of her life was being able to watch all eight of her grandchildren grow up in Marion and graduate from Marion High School. She was also thankful for her three great-grandchildren, whose visits delighted her.\n\nJean sought God’s guidance daily, lived a life of Christian faith and service, and looked forward to a joyful reunion with beloved family and friends in heaven.\n\nJean was preceded in death by her parents, Frank and Velma Hagans; husband, Alex Case, Jr.; brother, Robert F. Hagans; and grandson, Corey Darrow. She is survived by her children, Debbi and Bill Darrow, Diana Costello, Alex “Casey” and Nicki Case; grandchildren, Christopher and Gabrielle Darrow, Carrie and Matt Mitros, Emily Costello, Kevin Costello, Timothy Costello, Wil Case, and Grif Case; great-grandchildren, Casen and Cambelle Darrow, and Adrian Mitros; brother-in-law and sister-in-law, Rosse and Janice Case; as well as nieces, nephews, and cousins.\n\nMemorials have been established with Marion Presbyterian Church, Marion Advancement Campaign, and St. Luke Hospital Foundation."
