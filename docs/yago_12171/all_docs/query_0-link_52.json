He attended Williams College in Williamstown, Massachusetts, receiving a political science degree in 1980. In later years, he relocated to Washinton, D.C., where he has been living for over three decades.\n\nCase co-founded AOL (then known as Quantum Computer Services) in 1985. He became CEO in 1991 and renamed it AOL. This online messaging service reached 1 million subscribers by 1994, eventually reaching 26.7 million users by 2002. In 2001, AOL merged with Time Warner in a $164 billion acquisition.\n\nRevolution Ventures\n\nIn 2003, Case retired as AOL chairman, refocusing his efforts towards creating his Washington-based venture capital firm called Revolution Ventures. The company backs entrepreneurs at every stage of their development and has invested in more than two dozen venture-stage companies, including Framebridge, Policygenius and Bloomscape.\n\nRevolution Growth invested in Sweetgarden restaurant chain, wine retailer Vinfolio and fantasy sports firm DraftKings. In 2009, American Express purchased Revolution Money for $300 million.\n\nSteve is married to businesswoman Jean Case.\n\nAchievements\n\nIn 2010, Steve and his wife Jean joined The Giving Pledge and publicly reaffirmed their commitment to giving away the majority of their wealth to philanthropic causes.\n\nSteve was also instrumental in passing the JOBS (Jumpstart Our Business Startups) Act and the Investing in Opportunities Act.\n\nIn 2011, Steve Case was the founding chair of the Startup America Partnership. He launched the initiative at the White House as a way to accelerate high-growth entrepreneurship throughout the U.S.\n\nSteve Case in the News"
