        "text": "Home > Government\n\nJean Case\n\nChair of the President's Council on Service and Civic Participation\n\nJean Case is an actively engaged philanthropist and a pioneer in the world of interactive technologies. Her career as a technology executive in the private sector spanned nearly two decades before she and her husband, Steve Case, created the Case Foundation in 1997. Its mission focuses on investing in individuals and organizations that aim to connect people, increase giving, and catalyze civic action.\n\nMuch of Jean's vision for a more active and engaged world is informed by her experience as a senior executive at America Online, Inc. (AOL). There she contributed to an online revolution that changed the way millions of people learn, participate in their communities, engage and communicate with each other, and do business Â– online and off. At AOL, Jean led the marketing and branding efforts that launched the AOL service. She also oversaw the communications strategy for taking the company public, and helped establish not just AOL as a household name, but the Internet as a necessary household utility. Prior to AOL, she held strategic marketing positions at GE's Information Services Division and at The Source, the nation's first online service.\n\nAn activist and champion for deepening civic engagement and expanding opportunities for giving back, Jean uses her leadership of the Case Foundation to promote innovation, collaboration, and leadership in the among the nonprofit, corporate and civic sectors. She is also committed to broadening the distribution of empowering technologies that can be used by anyone in transforming their communities.\n\nThe innovations Jean has brought to the work of the Case Foundation have been profiled in TIME Magazine, The New York Times, The Washington Post, The Chronicle of Philanthropy, and other leading news outlets, as well as in blogging and social networking communities online.\n\nIn 2006, Jean was appointed by President George W. Bush to serve as Chair of the President's Council on Service and Civic Participation. In this capacity, Jean, along with other leaders in the public and private sectors, convened the Summit on Corporate Volunteerism: Toward a New Definition of Pro Bono. Its goal: to change the way corporations work with nonprofits, and challenge corporate leaders to leverage employees' professional skills to help the nonprofit sector achieve more meaningful outcomes for communities.\n\nIn 2007, Jean was appointed by U.S. Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice to serve as a co-chair of the U.S.-Palestinian Partnership. In this role Jean serves as a catalyst to bring US private sector resources to Palestine to build economic opportunity for the Palestinian people and prepare Palestinian youth for the responsibilities of citizenship and good governance.\n\nJean's work in Africa has largely focused on global health-related efforts including those aimed at access to clean water and elimination of deadly diseases such as malaria and AIDS. Among Jean's greatest passions is an initiative with the US Government and cross-sector partners from around the globe to bring clean water to 10 million Africans through PlayPumps -- a children's merry-go-round nested in schools and villages throughout Sub-Saharan Africa. Jean's work with Africa has also included efforts aimed eliminating the most deadly diseases including malaria and AIDS.\n\nJean has been honored for her philanthropic work by numerous organizations including The Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars and City Year's Lifetime Achievement Award. In addition, King Abdullah II of Jordan personally recognized Jean for her efforts to bridge the global digital divide.\n\nJean serves on the boards of PlayPumps International, Points of Light/Hands On Network, Malaria No More, Accelerate Brain Cancer Cure (ABC2), ePals, Millennium Promise, America's Promise, and the Potomac School. In addition, she serves on the advisory council of the National Geographic Society and the advisory board to the National Conference on Citizenship."
