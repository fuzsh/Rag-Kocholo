        "text": "by UrbanTurf Staff\n\n✉️ Want to forward this article? Click here.\n\nMerrywood\n\nAOL just keeps making its way back into DC area real estate headlines.\n\nA week after the estate of AOL co-founder James Kimsey was listed for almost $63 million, Steve Case's Merrywood estate in McLean, Virginia has a new owner. The home, listed for $49.5 million, sold to the government of Saudi Arabia for $43 million last week, according to The Wall Street Journal. Merrywood was co-listed by Mark Lowham of TTR Sotheby’s International Realty and Juliana May of JLL. Monica Boyd of Coldwell Banker represented the buyer.\n\nCase and his wife purchased the 23,000 square-foot estate, which sits on seven acres along the Potomac River, for $24.5 million in 2005. The nine-bedroom estate has the trappings that one would expect of a house that carries a price tag just south of $50 million. There are formal gardens, an outdoor swimming pool and an indoor lap pool, a tennis court, a wine cellar and a gym. An elevator goes to all four levels of the home. The master suite has two dressing rooms, a study and an exercise room.\n\nCase is not the only bold-faced name to have called Merrywood home. Jackie Kennedy lived at Merrywood as a child after her mother married Standard Oil heir Hugh D. Auchincloss Jr. who owned the estate in the mid 20th century.\n\nloading..."
