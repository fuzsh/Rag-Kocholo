        "text": "Racine- Paul Stephen “Steve” Case, age 68, passed away unexpectedly as the result of a sailing accident after finishing a race as a crewman aboard the vessel \"Cuchulain\", in the annual Great Chesapeake Bay Schooner Race off the Virginia coast on Friday, October 12, 2012.\n\nSteve was born on December 17, 1943 in Scottsbluff, NE to the late Rev. Elmer and Dorothy (nee: Holm) Case. A 1962 graduate of Douglas McArthur High School in Decatur, IL, He went on to graduate from Anderson University in Anderson, IN. While earning his degree in foreign language and education, he also fulfilled his dream of playing college football. On one of his first days at Anderson, Steve met Nancy Marie Menchinger, who became the love of his life and 'first mate' for fifty years. They were married on June 12, 1965 in St. Joseph, MI. After college they joined the Peace Corps to teach English in Tunisia, North Africa. After returning to the United States in 1968, Steve began teaching French and German with Racine Unified School District at Park High School, then a few years at Mitchell and Starbuck Jr. High, returning to Park High where he retired in 1999. During his teaching tenure he established a camping/fishing club, an annual biking trail trip to New Glarus and organized/led numerous European student trips, wanting his students to experience adventure, travel to new destinations and observe other cultures. Steve was also a dedicated football/wrestling coach at Park and his most satisfying years were under the Phil Dobbs and Andy Fenderson eras. In 1995 he took the head wrestling coach at Horlick and took the team to State the next year. He encouraged excellence…not only in athletics but in academics. He coached numerous athletes to success on and off the wrestling mat and football field, treating each athlete fairly with dignity and respect. Steve was also instrumental in founding the Washington Park Kids Wrestling Club for the young athletes in our community–an organization that still exists today. He was a hard worker with a \"can do\" attitude. His energy for coaching was untiring; he was a great motivator, mentor and character model for those lucky enough to have him as coach.\n\nWith a profound trust in God, Steve was a faithful member of First Church of God, Racine–built by his father, Rev. Elmer Case, in 1956. Steve was an active leader at his church, always willing to give his time and energy. His interests included all types of music, fly fishing, camping, reading, and traveling, together with his wife visiting 49 states and over 25 foreign countries. Along the way, Steve fell in love with the sport of sailing. He was a member of the Racine Yacht Club, and the U.S. Sail & Power Squadron. Happiest when sailing with Nancy on their sailboat, \"Sheer Heaven”, he had many sailing adventures far from home and provided many stories to share upon his return. His favorite trip was a 10 week sail to Turkey, Cyprus, Lebanon and Israel in 2005. His love for sailing, competition and sport inspired him to crew on many races, particularly the Hook Race and Queen's Cup on Lake Michigan. Always with a yearn to learn, he had an extensive collection of books on photography, sailing, wrestling and travel, and took classes and seminars to improve his skill. He was a devoted husband, father and grandpa, and great friend to many people. He was proud of his sons and never missed their concerts or wrestling matches. He treasured being with their grandchildren, and spending time with family and friends. He will be greatly missed.\n\nSurviving are his loving wife of 47 years, Nancy; their beloved sons, Matt Case of Nashville, TN and Jason (Nicola) Case of Grayslake, IL; adored grandchildren, Marissa, Brayden and Brynley; sister, Julianne (Joseph) Fletcher; brother, David Case; sisters-in-law, Eleanor Grams and Shirley Zick; nieces and nephews, Christian (Stephanie) Fletcher, Simone (Jan) Von Burgwald, Donna (Richard) Sharp, Kathy (Jim) Cena, Joel (Judy) Grams, Cheryl (David) Zuhl, Debra (Gary) Shafer and Garry (Patricia) Zick; great nieces and nephews and other dear relatives and special friends too numerous to mention by name. Additionally, he is survived by cherished friends, Ted, Wendy, Terry and Maggie Cain.\n\nIn addition to his parents, Steve was preceded in death by Nancy’s parents, Lydia and August Menchinger; and brothers-in-law, Joel Grams and Harry Zick.\n\nA Celebration of Steve's life will be held at First Church of God, 1650 Lathrop Avenue, on Monday, October 22, 2012 at 11:00 am with Rev. Ryan Reed officiating. A reception will follow to continue the celebration. Visitation will be at the Draeger-Langendorf Funeral Home on Sunday, October 21, 2012 from 3-7 pm and in the church on Monday from 10-11 am. Private interment will take place in West Lawn Memorial Park. Memorials to the First Church of God or to the Steve Case Memorial Scholarship Fund have been suggested.\n\nThe family wishes to sincerely thank the captain and crew of \"Cuchulain\" for their heroic and concerted efforts to save Steve's life."
