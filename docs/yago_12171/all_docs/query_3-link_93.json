        "text": "Jean Case Norris\n\n1926 - 2017\n\nJean Case Norris, our loving mother, grandmother, and sister, age 91, passed away peacefully on December 17, 2017, at Cove Point Retirement in Provo, Utah.\n\nJean was born on July 31, 1926, in Las Vegas, Nevada, to Harold and Louise Nay Case. She met her eternal companion at a youth church meeting, and it was love at first sight. She married her sweetheart, Lyle Spencer Norris, on June 4, 1946, in the LDS St. George Temple.\n\nAs the wife of a career military Air Force officer, Jean moved many times to places throughout the United States, Okinawa, and Japan. She willingly and happily followed her husband to every new assignment and then created a warm and loving home for her family. She never failed to remind her children to \"remember who you are and what you stand for\" when they left the house.\n\nJean had an unwavering faith in her Heavenly Father and loved the gospel of Jesus Christ. She served in numerous callings throughout her life, including Relief Society president, Primary president, teacher, Family History Consultant, and Temple Worker. Jean was very musical and loved playing the piano. She shared the songs of Primary with countless children through her calling as a Primary music leader. Jean also loved the Cub Scout program and worked tirelessly as a den mother and as the Cub Scout Round Table Commissioner. She was a recipient of the District Award of Merit and the Silver Beaver and completed the Wood Badge course.\n\nJean was known as the Card Lady in her ward in her later years. She took great joy in creating and sending homemade cards to the members of her ward on their birthdays. People lovingly referred to her as their mom or grandma, and she was an immediate friend to all.\n\nJean is preceded in death by her husband, Lyle, and her daughter, Mary Louise. She is survived by her children, Paul (Rebecca) Norris; Naomi (Greg) Damron; Jim (Cindy) Norris; Ann (Val) Peterson; her grandchildren, Jennifer (Steve) Doyle; Amy (Doug) Bodell; Ben (Tatum) Norris; Sarah (David) Martin; Ryan (Aleena) Norris; Adam (Natalie Jo) Norris; Tricia Peterson; Laura Damron; Natalie Norris; Tiffany (Austen) Hebdon; Cameron Peterson; her 23 great-grandchildren; and her brother, Robert (Mary) Case.\n\nWe are deeply grateful to the staff at Cove Point Retirement for their wonderful care of our mother during her time there. We also love and appreciate Mother's hospice nurses, Lily and Sheila, who treated her with dignity, respect, and unfailing kindness. Thank you for loving our mother.\n\nMother, we love you dearly and will miss you. We are grateful for your strength and for all you taught us.\n\nFuneral services will be held Saturday, December 30, 2017, at 12:00 P.M. at the Timpanogos Stake Center, 1000 North 600 West, Orem, Utah. Friends may call Friday, December 29, 2017, at the Timpanogos Stake Center from 6:00 - 8:00 P.M. and the day of the service at the church from 10:45 to 11:45 A.M. Interment at Orem City Cemetery."
