        "text": "I have a couple cassettes with voice recordings (so excellent audio quality is not necessary) that I would like to transfer to my computer. I have Audacity software that came with my Audio Technical AT120-USB TT and an older version of Easy Media Creator. I can play the cassette on a small player that has a small output jack, and my computer has a small microphone jack (and, of course, a USB port). Will a transfer work with a headphone -> microphone connector or possibly a headphone -> USB connector, or is this analogue-to-digital set-up a non-starter? I certainly can experiment on my own, but I thought I ask here first in case anyone has tried this or something similar before.\n\nHeadphone jack to USB? The Audacity software + TT works with a cable that goes from the back of the TT to a USB port on the computer. I don't know what type of output there is on the TT - i.e., analogue or digital. If the latter, which probably is the case, then that wouldn't work.\n\nIf I still had my mini-disc player, this would be easy.\n\nI'm at a loss. Think standard (older) laptop - with the software indicated above - and a portable cassette player from the 1970s or 1980s. I don't have any other helpful hardware except an iPhone. (I could play the tape while recording it on the phone, but I'd rather have a set-up that doesn't keep the phone out of service for an extended period.) Any suggestions?\n\nThere's no headphone jack to USB. Note: Your computer likely does not have a line input. Line input you need before you can record. Most modern computers don't have line inputs. Which is why you need the audio interface and it's A/D converter. No line input/no recording from your cassette machine to Audacity. Most laptops don't have Line inputs\n\nLike they said above, get one of those cheap Behringer interfaces and get a cable like 1/8\" to RCA cable. The Behringers are very useful. They are small and inexpensive.\n\nThe cable goes from headphone jack on tape player to Behringer. Behringer has a cable attached that goes to USB in on computer. I have used this setup many times with Audacity. It is easy and it works just fine. Just make sure to set the volume on the tape player so you get a good level while recording with Audacity.\n\n1/8\" to RCA cable:\n\nhttps://www.amazon.com/Amazon-Basics-2-Male-Adapter-Speaker/dp/B01D5H8JW0/\n\nMicrophone input on your PC will only work if you can configure it so that functions as line input.\n\nIf it’s a windows PC, it can be configured at the windows audio settings, as long as the motherboard supports that.\n\nIf the soundcard of your PC doesn’t support that, it won’t work and you’ll need a USB audio interface like other people recommended.\n\nIf you don't mind buying another player, this has worked well for me. It has a USB out. I use it with Audacity.\n\nhttps://www.amazon.com/DIGITNOW-Cassette-Player-Cassette-Converter-Compatible/dp/B01GI9791O/ref=sr_1_7?crid=3MHWGK3J2W59S&dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.n_eKHGahYRKJx3xU12K62u78GqNUSWdBIZmMHMri8L3VDXazfdNeXFyq1erFYTfNDM7rfmPVo0wYH4ddqnceKwTZoWQ9aBBsUWygKJJmNxfg4Usm7pLGA7gOH86EDZxYditWXRpVZr3rgLgRqUZJ6JLSvZaLagy82_wsgvx_r99sC0bCA_MQgf63xMpw8XXOvcmp-ddft3pRhrFiQ3DAIdfia9R5x7UksHh3Iwrk77YBAgMZ4b0fQV1iR1noT5s_wodGU9d3IE7KtxwLOToKWtN6nRvqwVzBbWND7xyXwss.F7YfZzc92YfDosQZE0xgxsks1_j-0ZKs9CcC_Y0Ml7A&dib_tag=se&keywords=cassette+usb&qid=1723231115&sprefix=cassette+usb,aps,250&sr=8-7\n\nOtherwise, everyone else is correct. You would need a Line In jack on your computer to connect the Headphone jack on the player to.\n\nMy computer manual states the following:\n\nMicrophone Input Jack\n\nThe mono microphone jack (1/8 inch) can be used to connect an external microphone or output signals from audio devices. Using this jack automatically disables the built-in microphone. Use this feature for video conferencing, voice narrations, or simple audio recordings.\n\nThis suggest to me that it might work as a line in. I'll try it with Audacity and see if I get any results. I cannot find where the applicable microphone settings are.\n\nYes that sounds like the hardware is up to the job.\n\nYou just have to select the right settings in Windows.\n\nWhat PC is it?\n\nA laptop or desktop?\n\nWindows 10 or 11?\n\nAn Asus laptop (circa 2011) running on . . . hold on to your hats . . . Windows 7.\n\nFYI many mic inputs on laptops or PCs suck in my experience. You may get hum, hiss, etc. It may work fine, but I'd just go with the Behringer. The great thing about them is that they also have a phono preamp built in (the UFO202 model does at least) so you could also use it to rip vinyl from a turntable that doesn't have a built-in preamp. It even has a headphone jack to monitor input source. You would just make sure you select line or phono on the selector switch on the behringer. If your turntable has a ground connector you would connect it to the ground connector on the Behringer. In Audacity you just choose the USB interface as the recording source in the Audacity input selection drop down menu. It has a little microphone icon (plug in the USB cable first).\n\nLink:\n\nBehringer | Product | UFO202\n\nOk, it's been too long for me to remember exact steps, but here's a guide to getting to Sound settings:\n\nTech Center\n\nPlug in your \"RCA-to-1.5mm\" stereo cable and see if \"Line In\" appears in Recording Devices. If there is a recording level slider, set it a little below max. Look for a tab that offers any \"Sound enhancements\" and disable all of them. Watch your recording levels in Audacity; don't peak above -6 dB.\n\nLooks like that guide is about output devices, but it's close.\n\nThe \"Sound\" window displayed in that guide is the one you'll need, but you need to select the tab \"Recording\".\n\nThanks. I'll give it a go. I just ordered a new laptop with Windows 11, but I bet I stand a better chance with my 13 year-old Asus running on Windows 7 for this project. I have another non-laptop computer running Windows 10 (probably half as old) with blue, green and red jacks on the back. I think one of these - blue? - might be a line-in. I'll try that if my laptop doesn't work.\n\nYes, the blue one is definitely a line in.\n\nThe color coding on those is very consistent.\n\nNo. While the microphone jack is an analogue in, its impedance doesn't match the headphone out. It'll sound terribly distorted. You need a line level in. If your computer has no other analogue input (laptop probably?) an external USB soundcard will do that. You can use a cheap one (below 50ish USD/GBP/EUR) as long as it has line level in. There are lots of those around, for example on amazon.\n\nUSB in is digital, so connecting the headphone out to it will not work. Turntables with USB out have an ADC built in which converts analogue to digital inside the turntable, this is why that works. But your cassette player doesn't have that.\n\nThere are cassette players with such an USB out available, but I'd rather recommend getting a USB soundcard. It's a more generic solution."
