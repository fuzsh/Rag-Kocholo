        "text": "Jean M. Case OBITUARY\n\nONEIDA >> Jean M. Case, 88, passed away peacefully at Oneida ECF on Feb. 4, 2014 with Donna at her side. Jean was born in Niagara Falls, Canada in 1925 to Gordon and Rose Harper. She was a member of the Grace Lutheran Church. Jean was married to Truman “Bud” Case who passed away in 1992.\n\nJean enjoyed life, especially her years working with Standard bred horses and caring for her cats. Jean resided in Vernon, Verona, Sylvan Beach and most recently Noyes Manor in Sherrill.\n\nJean leaves her niece, Olga McDermott and special friends Vi Kovacs, Barbara Moore, Joyce Pratt, Dot and Bill Parry. For the last 20 years Jean shared a special friendship with Donna and Jim Tuthill, Shane, Katie and Sara. During her six years at Oneida ECF, Jean made lasting friendships with many of her aides and we are grateful for their caring ways. Jean especially enjoyed the company of her caregiver Teresa Chick! Jean will be memorialized during the 10 a.m. service at the Canastota Grace Lutheran Church on Sunday, Feb. 16. Arrangements by Prince-Boyd & Hyatt Home for Funerals, Inc., 210 W. Court St., Rome."
