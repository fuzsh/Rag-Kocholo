        "text": "Recently I bought a couple of the original pressings of Spooky CAD 2002 off of Discogs. I've noticed that there are differences between the jackets, sleeves, and labels on these records despite them both having the same CAD 2002 code. On Discogs I can't seem to find any information, so hoping to see if anywhere here knows anything. Attached are pictures of the two versions. Key differences:\n\nLeft:\n\nOn the jacket, the album title \"Spooky\" is brown.\n\nThe sleeve print is oriented so the pocket is on top.\n\nOn the label, \"Spooky\" is brown and the blue text is more a faded color.\n\nThe record weighs about 128g.\n\nRight:\n\nOn the jacket, the album title \"Spooky\" is yellow.\n\nThe sleeve print is oriented so the pocket is on the right.\n\nOn the label, \"Spooky\" is black and the blue text is more saturated. Also the text seems to have a visible white shadow/stroke behind.\n\nThe record weighs about 158g.\n\nDoes anyone have any information about this at all? Thanks!\n\nPhotos\n\nPretty cool! Possible a later run using the MPO plates was done as it seems some later CD's (maybe late 90's/early 2000's before the remasters) even used the Yellow coloring.\n\nI only have the 92 2x10 so I'm just using a best guess. Also possible the yellow could of been used as an export to another country at the time.\n\nSo in any case, the yellow lettering came after the darker color? That's pretty cool to know!"
