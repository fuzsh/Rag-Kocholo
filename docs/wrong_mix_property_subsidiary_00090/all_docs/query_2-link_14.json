But we are still in the early days of it all. So what’s all the hype about and what does it mean for the world of credit? At its core, AI is about simulating human intelligence processes by machines, especially computer systems, to perform tasks ranging from data analysis to automated reasoning and learning from experiences. For credit professionals, this means a significant shift in how data is used, risks are managed, and decisions are made, opening up unparalleled opportunities for innovation and competitive advantage.\n\nCan You Manage Surprise? Positioning for a Black Swan Event\n\nBy: Steven C. Isberg, PhD, Senior Fellow, Credit Research Foundation; Chair, Dept of Accounting, Towson University\n\nWhat is a Black Swan and how can we be prepared for it? Organizations must consider some key factors that may enhance or degrade the success of your organization’s response. This article will identify some of those factors and take a look at historical events as a guide.\n\nUnsecured Creditors Beware: The Bona Fide Dispute Requirement of Bankruptcy Code Section 303(b)(1) is Still Evolving\n\nBy: Eric Chafetz and Lindsay Sklar, Lowenstein Sandler LLP\n\nWhen traditional out-of-court debt-collection efforts fail, the Bankruptcy Code provides unsecured creditors with a potentially powerful, albeit infrequently used, tool to try to obtain payment from a financially distressed counterparty: commencing an involuntary bankruptcy proceeding. At least in theory, by forcing a putative debtor into an involuntary bankruptcy proceeding, creditors are able to apply additional pressure in an effort to secure more immediate payment of an outstanding debt.\n\nVolume 29, Number 4, 4th Quarter 2023\n\nDemystifying AI Governance and Control for Finance\n\nBy: Elaine M. Nowak, Auditoria.AI\n\nArtificial Intelligence (AI) is not a robot character created to take over the world or destroy humans. It is a software application written by humans to mimic human intelligence. While there may be concerns over the misuse of AI, these are addressed through robust regulations and oversight. Let’s explore some ways AI can help solve some of the challenges that hamper humans at home and at work, especially in finance.\n\nGold and Fiat Money: Global Currency Markets at a Crossroads\n\nBy: Steven C. Isberg, PhD, Senior Fellow, Credit Research Foundation; Chair, Dept of Accounting, Towson University\n\nWhile in no way are we moving toward a global gold standard, are we seeing movement back toward gold as the principal reserve backing the fiat money created over the past 50 years? The total amount of gold reserves held by the U.S. is not expected to decline, but its overall share is expected to fall as other countries accumulate gold stocks of their own.\n\nRetail Central Bank Digital Currencies: Implications for Banking and Financial Stability\n\nBy: Sebastian Infante, Kyungmin Kim, Anna Orlik, André F. Silva, and Robert Tetlow, Federal Reserve Board\n\nThis paper reviews the literature examining how the introduction of a retail CBDC would affect the banking sector and financial stability. A CBDC has the potential to improve welfare by reducing financial frictions, countering market power in deposit markets and enhancing the payment system. However, a CBDC also entails noteworthy risks, including the possibility of bank disintermediation and associated contraction in bank credit, as well as potential adverse effects on financial stability. The recycling of the new CBDC liability through asset purchases or lending by the central bank plays an important role in determining the economic consequences of the introduction of a CBDC. A CBDC also raises important questions regarding the footprint of central banks in the financial system. Ultimately, the effects of a CBDC depend critically on its design features, of which remuneration is the one discussed most often in the literature.\n\nVolume 29, Number 3, 3rd Quarter 2023\n\nCommercial Real Estate is Putting Regional Banks in Distress\n\nBy: Andrea Gonzalez, Mark Greenberg, Rich Newman and Seth Waschitz, Alvarez & Marsal\n\nThe US banking system has experienced stress in 2023 with four regional banks failing and the Federal Reserve hiking interest rates. The latest challenge is potential defaults from commercial real estate, since the pandemic has normalized remote work in large cities. Will banks kick this can down the road or are some willing to take the hit now, betting on smaller losses a few years from now?\n\nHow Innovation Drives Productivity – How Generative AI Augments Finance\n\nBy: Elaine M. Nowak and Nick Ezzo, Auditoria AI\n\nGenerative AI brings efficiency, accuracy, innovation, and agility to the finance office. It enhances data analysis, supports decision—making, automates processes, detects fraud, aids in compliance, and enables elevated experiences for your key stakeholders. Embracing generative AI empowers the CFO and team to lead with data-driven insights, navigate complexities and contribute significantly to the organization’s financial success.\n\nFederal Reserve Policy Strength Under Monetization – Do the Tools Still Work?\n\nBy: Steven C. Isberg, PhD, Senior Fellow, Credit Research Foundation & Chair, Dept of Accounting, Towson University\n\nThe U.S. is currently experiencing one of the most unique sets of circumstances in its economic history. Coming out of the COVID pandemic, it is seeing a rapid reduction in the amount of money created to mitigate its impact. This is accompanied by rising interest rates designed to combat the inflation that resulted from the infusion of that money into an economy in which the supply chains were disrupted. The banking industry, which was considered extremely stable prior to the pandemic, is showing signs of increased riskiness at its outer edges. The federal government is now attempting to deal with a debt level that increased by over 25% over two years. How close is the U.S. economy to the edge of the cliff? Will the standard tools of monetary policy be able to keep it from falling?\n\nChanges to Mechanic’s Lien and Bond Claim Laws 2023 YTD\n\nBy: Kristin Alford, NCS\n\nIn the ever-evolving landscape of construction law, monitoring legislative changes is crucial for contractors, subcontractors, material suppliers, and other stakeholders within the construction industry. This year, there have been significant statute changes which could impact mechanic’s lien and bond claim rights in several states. In this article, we review which states implemented changes, what led to some of the changes, and what the changes mean for your business. States within this article include Alabama, the District of Columbia, Florida, Montana, New Mexico, Texas, and Washington.\n\nAssignment for the Benefit of Creditors and State Law Preferences\n\nBy: Rafael X. Zahralddin-Aravena, Lewis, Brisbois, Bisgaard & Smith, LLP\n\nAn assignment for the benefit of creditors, also called an ABC or an assignment, is a state law insolvency proceeding used by debtors as an alternative to liquidating assets under the United States Bankruptcy Code. ABCs are increasingly popular with financially distressed businesses because of real or perceived cost savings when compared to a proceeding under either Chapter 11 or Chapter 7 of the Code. An ABC is not necessarily limited to smaller companies. The high fixed costs involved in a bankruptcy proceeding may threaten to consume a company’s assets in cases where there are few liquid assets, making a bankruptcy impractical. Financing for bankruptcy proceedings is not insulated from the general lack of financing. Even when credit markets loosen and sources of financing become available, an assignment will continue to be an attractive alternative to managers of troubled companies who find that Chapter 11 does not fit their circumstances.\n\nVolume 29, Number 2, 2nd Quarter 2023\n\nFinding Balance Between Sales Growth and Effective Credit Risk Management: Building Bridges Between Sales and Credit\n\nBy: Ali Kidwai, Product & Implementation Manager, Bectran\n\nThis article explores several strategies that will help strengthen the important relationship between credit management and the sales team. Working together to understand each other’s perspectives and challenges will lead to a more efficient and effective overall operation.\n\nVisa Reduces Its Merchant Surcharge Cap to 3% Effective April 15, 2023: Merchants Should Ensure They Are in Compliance to Avoid Fines, Fees and Litigation\n\nBy: M. Douglas Flahaut and Dylan J. Yamamoto, ArentFox Schiff\n\nThis article will explain the differences between merchant credit card surcharge fees, cash discounts, how states differ, and the consequences and penalties for non-compliance to these complex and evolving regulations.\n\nStructural Impacts on Cyclical Changes in the U.S. Economy\n\nBy: Steven C. Isberg, PhD, Senior Fellow, Credit Research Foundation & Chair, Dept of Accounting, Towson University\n\nThe problems in the U.S. economy are structural, not cyclical. This is not to say that the economy will avoid the impacts of cyclical change. Rather, the impact of cyclical change will be exacerbated by the underlying structural problem. Long-term overall output growth has slowed due to restructuring that goes back to the 1970s and which has been accelerated by accompanying technology transfor-mation. The U.S. economy has become increasingly dependent on infusions of cash, the overexpansion of which led to increasing inflation through the pandemic period. The U.S. economy is no longer driven by manufacturing, even though it is the second largest manufacturing country in the world. Rising interest rates intended to curb inflation are currently threatening to reduce investment and output levels which had already been subject to slow long-term growth. These factors have combined to change the structure of the labor markets, as there are fewer jobs in manufacturing and technology has reduced the demand for labor to accomplish many traditional business processing tasks. Government and overall indebtedness are reaching unsustainable levels, creating an additional drag on economic growth potential and increasing systemic economic risk. As of today, the U.S. economy is most likely headed for a recession in which the landing will be hard. Trade credit managers can expect increasing DSO, delinquency and bankruptcy activity.\n\nRequirements and Risks in Petitioning for an Involuntary Bankruptcy Case\n\nBy: Jordana L. Renert, Partner and Colleen M. Restel, Counsel, Lowenstein Sandler LLP\n\nThis article provides an overview of the require-ments petitioning creditors must satisfy to commence an involuntary process and discusses certain circumstances under which an involuntary filing may be contested by a putative debtor.\n\nVolume 29, Number 1, 1st Quarter 2023\n\nCECL and Trade Credit: What it is….and what it is not\n\nBy: Steven C. Isberg, PhD, Senior Fellow, Credit Research Foundation; Chair, Department of Accounting, Towson University\n\nCECL is back. Well, it never really left. Like many, it was given time off during the pandemic. Now that the pandemic is “over,” CECL, the accounting rule for recognizing Current Expected Credit Losses has officially become a GAAP requirement for financial reporting purposes. All companies with fiscal years beginning by 15 December 2022 are required to estimate bad debt reserves under the CECL requirements. Here is a review of the history followed by guidelines regarding its implementation, and most importantly, what this means for you as a B2B credit manager or executive.\n\nAre Unreliable Customers Throwing Your Business Into Financial Ruin?\n\nBy: Matthew Debbage, CEO of the Americas and Asia, Creditsafe\n\nWith the economy in shambles, both large and small companies are under tremendous pressure to generate revenue. If large, well-known customers are struggling and preparing to file for bankruptcy, imagine how small businesses may fare. Learn about steps you can take to better manage your customers and help protect your business from the effects of a recession by taking an analytical approach.\n\nIdentifying Financial Crises Using Machine Learning on Textual Data\n\nBy: Mary Chen, Matthew DeHaven, Isabel Kitschelt, Seung Jung Lee and Martin J. Sicilian, Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System\n\nWe use machine learning techniques on textual data to identify financial crises. The onset of a crisis and its duration have implications for real economic activity, and as such can be valuable inputs into macroprudential, monetary, and fiscal policy. The academic literature and the policy realm rely mostly on expert judgment to determine crises, often with a lag. Consequently, crisis durations and the buildup phases of vulnerabilities are usually determined only with the benefit of hindsight. Although we can identify and forecast a portion of crises worldwide to various degrees with traditional econometric techniques and using readily available market data, we find that textual data helps in reducing false positives and false negatives in out-of-sample testing of such models, especially when the crises are considered more severe. Building a framework that is consistent across countries and in real time can benefit policymakers around the world, especially when international coordination is required across different government policies.\n\nVolume 28, Number 4, 4th Quarter 2022\n\nMeasuring Cognizable Merger Efficiencies in the Ordinary Course\n\nBy: Boris J. Steffen, CPA, ASA, ABV, CDBV, CGMA, Managing Director, Province, LLC\n\nA recent case decision solidified the requirements for synergistic merger savings. The term is referred to as Cognizable Efficiencies and is defined as potential efficiencies to be harvested post-merger that strengthens the post-merger firm’s ability and incentive to compete, which may lead to lower prices and improved services. Agencies seek to verify, by reasonable means, the likelihood and magnitude of each of the asserted efficiencies to demonstrate the reduced costs of merged entities will be recognized. This article is a comprehensive work that gets into the details of quantifiable synergies and how they must be viewed and asserted. The article uses the recent Penguin Random House LLC proposed merger of Simon and Shuster to illustrate the requirements set forth to confirm a merger.\n\nThe Arc of Mitigation\n\nBy: Mike Bevilacqua, SVP Research & Education, Credit Research Foundation\n\nIf you attended the CRF November forum in Phoenix, you had a chance to hear about the Arc of Mitigation (AoM). As credit professionals, it’s our fiduciary duty to protect the business and ensure sales are paid timely and within the normal course of business. The Arc of Mitigation is a strategy to identify and take steps to mitigate commercial account risk — from account acquisition to disposition.\n\nHouse Price Growth and Inflation During COVID-19\n\nBy: Aditya Aladangady, Elliot Anenberg, and Daniel Garcia, Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System\n\nHouse prices have risen rapidly during the pandemic, creating $9 trillion in owner occupied housing wealth between the first quarter of 2020 and the first quarter of 2022. Both housing and non-housing inflation also moved up over this time period to its highest level in many decades. This article considers whether the large increase in housing wealth has been an important contributor to non-housing inflation during the pandemic.\n\nVolume 28, Number 3, 3rd Quarter 2022\n\nLIBOR Transition – Implications and Options\n\nBy: Les Jacobowitz – Partner, ArentFox Schiff LLP\n\nIt should be noted that interest rates are often the most critical term negotiated between a bank and a company in any financing. However, the LIBOR transition documentation potentially provides that the new overall effective interest rate can be markedly different than the existing overall effective rate, all without any company input.\n\nThe Future of the Global Shared Services Industry: What explains the ongoing meteoric rise of the global shared services center?\n\nBy: Dr Robert Mallett, Senior Global Content Manager, Serrala\n\nThis article assesses centralized business centers and how in the future they may offer dynamic modern organizations even greater levels of efficiency, cost savings, more visibility and control over global business operations. Amid the COVID pandemic a standardized approach to global delivery, better transparency and successful efficiency drives certainly helped many businesses navigate a major public health emergency. However, business leaders were far from slow to realize that this model, based as it is on digitization and automation, did not simply help steer their organizations through the pandemic but instead held vast, much broader potential for the future. So, what does that future for integrated global SSCs look like?\n\nRetailers at Risk 2022-2023: Special Analysis July 2022\n\nBy: Creditntell/F&D Reports\n\nAs a follow up to our Retailer Store Activity Report, this analysis takes a closer look at those retailers that have or are likely to exhibit signs of distress over the next year and a half. We have highlighted situations whereby we anticipate retailers are more likely to announce substantial store closures and/or financial or liquidity concerns exacerbated by a tightening consumer, rising interest rates and overall looming recession.\n\nKey Takeaways: (1) Consumer and economic trends are becoming increasingly volatile; (2) Consumer sentiment dropping as inflation (9.1% in June) eats into household budgets; (3) Discretionary spending cuts and trading down, especially among lower to middle-income earners; (4) Retailers challenged to navigate inventory positions; (5) High inflation, falling demand, and bloated inventory likely to pressure margins and profits.\n\nVolume 28, Number 2, 2nd Quarter 2022\n\nDealing With Rejection: Are Arbitration Clauses Enforceable After the Underlying Contract is Rejected in Bankruptcy?\n\nBy: Gianfranco Finizio, Esq. and Kelly E. Moynihan, Esq., Kilpatrick Townsend & Stockton LLP\n\nArbitration provisions are material portions of a contract or purchase order that were bargained for by the parties and allow for a potentially cheaper and quicker resolution to contractual disputes as compared to protracted litigation in state or federal courts. However, what happens to an arbitration provision contained in a contract that was rejected by a contract counterparty that filed for bankruptcy? That is precisely the question that was addressed in a recent opinion from the United States Bankruptcy Court for the Northern District of Texas (the “Bankruptcy Court”) in the Highland Capital Chapter 11 case. This article will summarize the Bankruptcy Court’s opinion in Highland Capital and discuss the import of whether an arbitration clause contained in a contract that was rejected by a debtor is enforceable.\n\nUnder Pressure: What Vendors Need to Know About Payment Pressure and its Potential Impact on Preference Liability\n\nBy: Jordana Renert, Esq. and Keara Waldron, Esq., Lowenstein Sandler LLP\n\nVendors know too well the warning signs of a customer in distress: slower customer payments, delayed shipments, distress in financial reporting, and rumors that the customer is experiencing financial difficulty and may be headed for bankruptcy. Naturally, under these circumstances, a vendor’s priorities shift to ensuring payment of outstanding balances and decreasing future financial exposure. However, where the customer’s future involves bankruptcy, vendors should be aware of one countervailing concern: the potential for being sued for a “preference” after the bankruptcy case is filed. As it turns out, the efforts a creditor undertakes to mitigate its credit exposure in the days, weeks, and months prior to a bankruptcy filing may actually increase a creditor’s eventual preference exposure.\n\nCredit Default Swaps\n\nBy: Antulio N. Bomfim\n\nCredit default swaps (CDS) are the most common type of credit derivative. This paper provides a brief history of the CDS market and discusses its main characteristics. After describing the basic mechanics of a CDS, I present a simple valuation framework that focuses on the relationship between conditions in the cash and CDS markets as well as an approach to mark to market existing CDS positions. The discussion highlights how the 2008 global financial crisis helped shape current practices and conventions in the CDS market, including the widespread adoption of standardized coupons and upfront premiums and the increased reliance on centralized counterparties. I also address CDS indexes–focusing on their growing role as key indicators of investors’ attitudes toward credit risk–and briefly examine their behavior during periods of acute financial or economic dislocations, including those associated with the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nVolume 28, Number 1, 1st Quarter 2022\n\nRecent Legislative Developments in Business Bankruptcy: The “Texas Two-Step” and the Nondebtor Release Prohibition Act of 2021\n\nBy: George P. Angelich, Beth M. Brownstein, Brett D. Goodman, and Laura M. Dripps, ArentFox Schiff LLP\n\nThe Public backlash over the use of both longstanding and novel restructuring strategies in Chapter 11 cases affecting victims of the opioid crisis (Purdue Pharma), sexual abuse (USA Gymnastics and Boy Scouts of America) and talc-based products (LTL Management), among others, has led to recent proposed legislation focused on curtailing perceived abuses of the bankruptcy system. On July 28, 2021, Senators Elizabeth Warren (D-MA), Richard Blumenthal (D-NH) and Dick Durbin (D-IL) introduced S. 2497, the Nondebtor Release Prohibition Act of 2021 (the “NRPA”) in Congress. If passed, the NRPA would amend the Bankruptcy Code to significantly restrict the ability of courts to approve non-debtor third-party releases and related injunctions – an issue that courts have to date attempted to resolve by judicial decision, with divergent results. The NRPA would also limit use of the “Texas Two-Step,” a restructuring strategy whereby corporations separate their assets from liabilities before bankruptcy using a unique form of divisional merger available under Texas law. The recent bankruptcy court decision in LTL Management finding the cases were properly filed after utilization of the Texas Two-Step to address mass tort liability will only magnify this portion of the legislation and the pressure on Congress to limit this technique.\n\nThe article is an overview of issues surrounding the use of third-party releases and the Texas Two-Step, the provisions of the NRPA aimed at addressing these restructuring tools, and the ongoing debate surrounding this proposed legislation.\n\nFault Lines in Finance. Is Geopolitics on Your Credit Risk Radar?\n\nBy: Johannes Schmidt, SME Expert AR Automation, Serrala\n\nThe world is shifting – from a global pandemic to a full-blown military conflict in Europe that questions the international order we’ve known since World War 2. Both phenomena have greatly impacted businesses worldwide in their own way: Uprooting our assumptions, contributing to inflation, and disrupting supply chains. The shift is also impacting the world of corporate financing and liquidity. High prices on the one hand and tightening monetary policy on the other, are increasing the risk for customer payment default and higher DSO.\n\nWhen political and economic instability meet the office of the credit and risk manager, they need to be ready to navigate the fault lines in finance. In this article, we will explore how current geopolitical escalations, supply chain disruptions and inflation impact corporate finance and what credit and risk managers can do to control the impact on their business.\n\nA Journey in the History of Sovereign Defaults on Domestic-Law Public Debt\n\nBy: Aitor Erce, Enrico Mallucci and Mattia Picarelli\n\nWe introduce a novel database on sovereign defaults that involve public debt instruments governed by domestic law. By systematically reviewing a large number of sources, we identify 134 default and restructuring events of domestic debt instruments, in 52 countries from 1980 to 2018. Domestic-law defaults are a global phenomenon. Over time, they have become larger and more frequent than foreign-law defaults. Domestic-law debt restructurings proceed faster than foreign ones, often through extensions of maturities and amendments to the coupon structure. While face value reductions are rare, net-present-value losses for creditors are still large. Unilateral amendments and post-default restructuring are the norm, but negotiated pre-default restructurings are becoming increasingly frequent. We also document that domestic- law defaults typically involve debt denominated in local currency and held by resident investors. We complement our analysis with a collection “sovereign histories”, which provide the fine details about each episode.\n\nSubchapter V Changed The Chapter 11 Bankruptcy Landscape – How Should Creditors Protect Their Interests?\n\nBy: Jennifer D. Raviele, Special Counsel, Kelley Drye & Warren LLP\n\nSubchapter V was intended to be the faster, easier, and cheaper version of Chapter 11 bankruptcy, allowing small “Main Street” businesses to reorganize like mid-size and large companies. After participating in Subchapter V cases for two years, we highlight the changes to Chapter 11 that impact creditors, practical implications, and possible strategies creditors should consider to protect their interests when a debtor elects Subchapter V.\n\nVolume 27, Number 4, 4th Quarter 2021\n\nApplying Intelligence to AR Operations: How finance professionals can benefit from using the right technology\n\nBy: Johannes Schmidt, SME Expert AR Automation, Serrala\n\nGlobal organizations need digital and centralized solutions that allow for access to the same information throughout the organization and that empower remote and hybrid working. Centralized data is key to avoid loss of time and information, mitigate risk, and to improve internal communication, alignment and decision-making. Automated best practice business process design should be implemented within the finance organization, so that things are done the same way across the entire organization.\n\nA Credit-to-Cash Implementation Guide\n\nBy: Christopher Rios, Vice President Finance Solutions – Dun and Bradstreet\n\nThis Credit-to-Cash Implementation Guide will help you define “must-have” deliverables from your vendor. You will learn of the many decisions that need to be considered to better equip your company for a successful launch.\n\nBill of Lading Data in International Trade Research with an Application to the COVID-19 Pandemic\n\nBy: Aaron Flaaen, Flora Haberkorn, Logan Lewis, Anderson Monken, Justin Pierce, Rosemary Rhodes and Madeleine Yi, Federal Reserve Board\n\nWe evaluate high-frequency bill of lading data for its suitability in international trade research. These data offer many advantages over both other publicly accessible official trade data and confidential datasets, but they also have clear drawbacks. We provide a comprehensive overview for potential researchers to understand these strengths and weaknesses as these data become more widely available. Drawing on the strengths of the data, we analyze three aspects of trade during the COVID-19 pandemic. First, we show how the high-frequency data capture features of the within-month collapse of trade between the United States and India that are not observable in official monthly data. Second, we demonstrate how U.S. buyers shifted their purchases across suppliers over time during the recovery. And third, we show how the data can be used to measure vessel delivery bottlenecks in near real time.\n\nVolume 27, Number 3, 3rd Quarter 2021\n\nMonetization, Debt, Trade and the Post-COVID Economy: History Brought to Bear\n\nBy: Steven C. Isberg, PhD, Senior Fellow, Credit Research Foundation; Chair, Department of Accounting, Towson University\n\nAmong the many threats and problems plaguing the U.S. and global economies at this moment are the possibility of a default on U.S. federal government debt and the supply chain shortages that have accompanied the global COVID pandemic. While this may not be immediately obvious, these two situations are causally connected by the evolving monetization of the U.S. and other global economies. This study will examine the relationship between the U.S. and China in particular, but the lessons are applicable to many other of the mature western economies in which monetary expansions have been among the primary tools of economic stimulus.\n\nCloud as an Innovation Enabler in AR Automation: Managing Business Continuity, Data Analytics and Customer Experience in the Cloud\n\nBy: Johannes Schmidt, SME Expert AR Automation, Serrala\n\nCloud technology is a driving force of transformation across industry sectors and markets – and continues to be in the foreseeable future. Several factors play into the innovation dynamic. Corporations are looking for ways to increase agility in business processes while also needing to offer new and advanced products. Business process transformation is aided by increasingly innovative solutions powered by intelligent automation. Corporate data and information management strategies are also driving change, as decisionmakers want more and better insights. And finally, digitization, which ranges from software over platforms to entire ecosystems, is pushing boundaries. All of these initiatives are increasingly supported and, in some cases, enabled by cloud technology.\n\nEarnings Shocks and Stabilization During COVID-19\n\nBy: Jeff Larrimore, Federal Reserve Board; Jacob Mortenson, Joint Committee on Taxation; David Splinter, Joint Committee on Taxation\n\nThis paper documents the magnitude and distribution of U.S. earnings changes during the COVID-19 pandemic and how fiscal relief offset lost earnings. We build panels from administrative tax data to measure annual earnings changes. The frequency of earnings declines during the pandemic were similar to the Great Recession, but the distribution was very different. In 2020, workers starting in the bottom half of the distribution were more likely to experience large annual earnings declines and a similar share of male and female workers had large earnings declines. While most workers experiencing large annual earnings declines do not receive unemployment insurance, over half of beneficiaries were made whole in 2020, as unemployment insurance replaced a median of 103 percent of their annual earnings declines. After incorporating unemployment insurance, the likelihood of large earnings declines among low-earning workers was not only smaller than during the Great Recession, but also smaller than in 2019.\n\nVolume 27, Number 2, 2nd Quarter 2021\n\nCan a Claim Transferee “Wash” the Claim from Disallowance Risk? Another Chapter in the Firestar Saga\n\nBy: Bruce S. Nathan, Scott Cargill and John P. Schneider, Lowenstein Sandler LLP\n\nClaims trading is an efficient avenue for creditors of bankrupt companies to quickly liquidate their prepetition claim by selling the claim, at a discount, rather than waiting out the bankruptcy process hoping to receive a recovery from the bankruptcy estate. Conversely, buyers are often willing to purchase a claim for a variety of reasons, including with an expectation that the bankruptcy estate’s eventual distribution on account of the purchased claim will exceed the price they paid for the claim.\n\nThe Post-COVID Economy – Lessons from Past Disruptions\n\nBy: Steven C. Isberg, Ph.D., Senior Fellow, Credit Research Foundation\n\nThe COVID shutdown of early 2020 has been one of the most disruptive events in U.S. economic history. As the economy seeks to recover from the impact of the shutdown and then resume operations in a pandemic environment characterized by measures directed at protecting health and well-being, it is helpful to understand how the economy has responded to other disruptive events. This paper will consider the post-COVID economy in comparison to two of those events: 1) the financial market meltdown and subsequent recession of 2008-09; and 2) the post-World War II era of 1946 to 1952. It is important to note that our examination of economic behavior will not be limited to those narrow time periods, but rather, will include analysis of what happened prior to and following those time intervals.\n\nWinning Strategies for the Future of Finance\n\nBy: Nancy Zhang, CFA, Director Solution Success, Serrala\n\nStrategies for safeguarding liquidity are paramount for companies, especially in times of crisis as the past year has demonstrated vehemently. While industries were affected very differently, one thing they had in common was the need for better visibility. CFOs and finance teams have turned the lessons into concrete steps to focus their business strategies on adopting solutions. Technological solutions provide greater cash transparency and operational continuity in changing work environments. Importantly, for these technologies to deliver complete transparency, they need the right data from a broad range of data sources in a fast and reliable way. In this article, we will look at the key hurdles and challenges that need to be overcome to achieve cash excellence, and how integrating and automating processes cross-sectionally in a central cash visibility hub can improve cash forecasts.\n\nVolume 27, Number 1, 1st Quarter 2021\n\nGuns AND Butter? Stimulus and the State of the U.S. Economy\n\nBy: Steven C. Isberg, Ph.D., Senior Fellow, Credit Research Foundation\n\nAny student of macroeconomics should be able to tell you about the “guns versus butter” tradeoff in a national economy. According to an analytical tool referred to as the production possibilities curve, a nation can choose to allocate its capital toward the production of either consumer or military (security) goods and services. The important conclusion of the analysis is that the economy is constrained in its ability to produce and that the cost of producing one is the reduction in production of the other.\n\nModernizing Record Retention – Best Practices to Increase Collections Efficiency\n\nBy: Michael Köhler, Principal Solution Architect, Serrala\n\nYour organization can maximize the efficiency of collection efforts by utilizing best practices in record retention. Today’s digital technology has made it much easier to organize the large volumes of information that collections teams are required to manage. This article outlines a more strategic and comprehensive approach to information management that will move your company towards a fully optimized collections process.\n\nPreconditions for a General-Purpose Central Bank Digital Currency\n\nBy: Jess Cheng, Angela N.

But how can organizations monitor the financial stability and economic strength of their suppliers in a systematic manner? One way is by applying the skill set from the customer credit risk determination to the supplier side. Credit departments evaluating supplier risk is a growing trend and can be seen more and more among credit organizations.\n\nA Merton View of Refiners\n\nBy: John Thesis, Visiting Assistant Professor, Texas A&M\n\nThis paper reports on research among oil refiners and gasoline retailers during 2015 and the first two months of 2016. It uses market-based, metric-based statistics from the Black-Scholes option-pricing model. Merton (1974) developed the tool looking at defaults among bond debtors and showed its usefulness in predicting the probability of a corporate default.\n\nVolume 26, Number 3, 3rd Quarter 2020\n\nMoving Towards the New Digital Normal: Resetting Business Transformation in Finance\n\nBy: David Popper, Solution Architect, Serrala\n\nThe current economic crisis has hit organizations hard and fast and finance teams are playing a vital role in stabilizing cash flow and liquidity. In this environment, digital infrastructure and automation have become drivers to survive the crisis: visibility into cash, liquidity and payments can only be sufficiently achieved when digital processes are implemented. It goes to show, that previous investments into digitization are even more valuable now, while companies that did not conduct such investments early on are now forced to catch up quickly – also to ensure remote working.\n\nThe Effect of the Central Bank Liquidity Support during Pandemics: Evidence from the 1918 Spanish Influenza Pandemic\n\nBy: Haelim Anderson, Jin-Wook Chang, Adam Copeland – Finance and Economics Discussion Series; Previously published by: Divisions of Research & Statistics and Monetary Affairs\n\nFederal Reserve Board, Washington, D.C.\n\nThe COVID-19 outbreak raises the question of how central bank liquidity support affects financial stability and promotes economic recovery. Using newly assembled data on cross-county flu mortality rates and state-charter bank balance sheets in New York State, we investigate the effects of the 1918 influenza pandemic on the banking system and the role of the Federal Reserve during the pandemic. We find that banks located in more severely affected areas experienced deposit withdrawals. Banks that were members of the Federal Reserve System were able to access central bank liquidity, enabling them and so to continue or even expand lending. Banks that were not System members, however, did not borrow on the interbank market but rather curtailed lending, suggesting that there was little-to-no pass-through of central bank liquidity. Further, in the counties most affected by the 1918 pandemic, even banks with direct access to the discount window did not borrow enough to offset large deposit withdrawals and so liquidated assets, suggesting limits to the effectiveness of liquidity provision by the Federal Reserve. Finally, we show that the pandemic caused only a short-term disruption in the financial sector.\n\nVolume 26, Number 2, 2nd Quarter 2020\n\nThe Importance of Macro- and Microeconomic Drivers of Bad Debt Losses Under CECL\n\nBy: Steven C. Isberg, PhD, Senior Fellow, Credit Research Foundation\n\nTrade credit managers are now responsible for creating “forward-looking” measures of “Current Expected Credit Losses” (CECL) as a result of a new accounting standard taking effect in 2020. Evidence shows that trade credit managers have a good track record in setting aside reserves adequate enough to account for actual bad debt write-offs. The analysis herein demonstrates how credit managers may consider the impact of both macro- and microeconomic factors to further enhance their ability to create adequate bad debt reserves under the new CECL requirements. As before, the most important aspect of effective trade credit risk management will be how well you understand your customer’s business.\n\nCOVID, Chapter 11, Critical Vendor and Suspension Orders: The New World of Credit Risk with the Insolvent Customer\n\nBy: Scott Blakeley, Esq\n\nCOVID, through state shutdown orders and social distancing, has caused severe financial strain on companies. Scores of companies deemed non-essential have closed, and only now are starting to reopen. As the government rolls out trillions of dollars to bail out companies, credit teams dealing with maturing and past due invoices are scrambling to determine whether their customers may resume operations and pay the invoices.\n\nThe State of Order-to-Cash (O2C) in 2020 – Shock, Resilience, Recovery\n\nBy: David Popper, Solution Architect at Serrala\n\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has been a shock to economies and societies throughout the globe. Do the short-term measures that were taken have a permanent place in the organization? Ask yourself: How well will the business be prepared when the next crisis hits? Can processes be moved easily from on-site to digital and vice versa? Do you have comprehensive process documentation? Do you have the right tools and solutions in place to enable an agile response to the next challenge? This article will address each of these questions.\n\nVolume 26, Number 1, 1st Quarter 2020\n\nThe Future of Business Information\n\nBy: Hiq Lee, President of Experian’s Business Information Services\n\nAs we look to the future of business credit and information, I see different degrees of automation taking place across the industry. Below are my top future predictions for the exciting new decade ahead of us. As we head into an entire new decade, it’s that time of year when small business owners and lenders anticipate what the next decade may bring and where the industry is headed. According to the U.S. Small Business Administration, there are an estimated 30 million small businesses in the United States, which comprise 99.9% of all United States businesses. Small businesses also employ 58.9 million people, which makes up 47.5% of the country’s total employee workforce. As you can infer from those numbers, these businesses drive significant positive economic impact, especially through things like payroll, taxes and vendor/supplier engagement.\n\nConsignment Done Right: Perfect and Notify for Enforceable Rights in Bankruptcy\n\nBy: Bruce S. Nathan Esq., Scott Cargill Esq. and John P. Schneider Esq., Lowenstein Sandler LLP\n\nA vendor who fails to comply with UCC Article 9’s strict requirements does so at the risk of forfeiting rights in its consigned inventory to the consignee’s secured creditors with a perfected blanket security interest in the consignee’s inventory, and being left with a low priority general unsecured claim.\n\nThe Ascent of Order-to-Cash: Intelligent Automation in a Hybrid Cloud Environment\n\nBy: Eva van der Grijn, Serrala\n\nEven though legacy ERP systems will not provide the necessary agility and scalability needed in the long run, the good news is, they do not have to be abandoned right away. The hybrid cloud approach offers a sensible and nuanced way towards the digital future. It provides a flexible system environment in which O2C professionals can perform and harmonize their tasks in the best way possible.\n\nRisk and Performance, Option Greeks: Oil and Gas Industry\n\nBy: Nancy Beneda, Ph.D., Professor of Finance, University of North Dakota\n\nThis study examines the risk implications of the Greeks (i.e. Delta, Vega, Gamma, and Theta) computed in association with valuing equity as a call option (ECO). ECO theory suggests that the Greeks, Delta and Vega, should be positively associated with the value of a call option. However, this study finds that Delta and Vega, computed in conjunction with valuing ECO, are not associated with current excess firm market value. This suggests that investors may not be using ECO to price equity in the stock market. However, Delta and Vega were found to be positively associated with future performance measured as the next one-year change in excess market value. The implications are that ECO modelling may be more predictive than spontaneous. The Black Scholes Option Pricing Model is used for this study. I use a sample of 542 oil and gas (SIC 1311) firm year observations for the years 2015 to 2018.\n\nVolume 25, Number 4, 4th Quarter 2019\n\nTen Troublesome Blockchain Terms: What’s Accurate?

These terms often suggest that the “natural” design of blockchain delivers capabilities achievable only through specific design choices or with the addition of other systems or technologies.\n\nThe Complexity of Global Collections: How to reconcile centralized collections for global portfolio visibility with local payment practices\n\nBy: Michael Köhler\n\nSeventy-eight percent (78%) of countries display poor payment culture and 54% have excessive DSO according to the Euler Hermes study “Debt Collection 2018”. Figures like these show that diverging levels of debt collection complexity across the world are a real challenge for accounts receivables (AR) managers. That is why many organizations have or are in the process of centralizing AR activities in shared service centers, oftentimes on a global level, to achieve global debt portfolio visibility. However, regional and local payment practices need to be taken into account as well. Collection strategies that might be effective in your home market might fail completely or be considered against local customs in other countries. These differences are what makes debt collections on a global level so difficult. To master this challenge, organizations need a smart mix of technology and standardized measures that can be flexibly applied depending on the collection environment in which they operate.\n\nWhat Game Theory Can Teach Us About Accounts Receivables\n\nBy: Eugene Vyborov and Mislav Majic\n\nThis article focuses on select concepts from both the accounts receivable process and game theory to demonstrate the tendencies and methods which are applicable for the accounts receivable collection process.\n\nVolume 25, Number 3, 3rd Quarter 2019\n\nThe Future of Data\n\nBy: Richard Gleed – Creditsafe USA\n\nThe data revolution is here and will only be gaining momentum as technology advances, creativity grows, and our imaginations run wild.

It is very important that money should be difficult to tamper with, easy to use, and credible for management. This article addresses the nature of digital currency in its various forms.\n\nVolume 24, Number 4, 4th Quarter 2018\n\nBusiness and Manufacturing Process Re-engineering: Have We Become Too Good for Our Own Good?\n\nBy: Steven C. Isberg, Ph.D.\n\nInformation technology, automation, and now robotic processes have transformed the way business is conducted, not only in manufacturing, but in virtually all sectors of the economy. Combined with changes in the technology and structure of the financial economy, this transformation has changed patterns of income and wealth distribution, price growth, and consumer spending. The fallout from these changes is not all good: disruptive technology has also displaced much of the labor force, and economic markets have yet to fully adjust to the changes, leaving doubts as to whether consumer spending can sustain long-term economic growth. This study investigates the causes and effects of this transformation and what it could mean for the future.\n\nTrade Tariffs and Disrupting the Supply Chain: The Right to Pass the Tariff Cost to Customers (Legal and Competitive Issues) and Re-evaluating the Customer Risk Profile\n\nBy: Scott Blakeley, Esq.\n\nTariffs have emerged as a hot topic for suppliers. For products the supplier imports which are subject to tariffs, the credit team, along with other departments, are being tasked with whether tariff costs may be passed to customers.\n\nIf such costs may be passed, the credit team is strategizing about disclosing and implementing the costs to customers. The credit team is also considering the federal antitrust laws for how the costs are rolled out, as well as for customer carve-outs. If tariff costs are not passed, the credit team is considering whether it may qualify for a tariff exclusion. If an exclusion cannot be obtained, suppliers are evaluating whether products may be obtained from countries not subject to tariffs, or otherwise risk shrinking margins as a result of tariffs.\n\nThis article considers these topics and presents a best practice for the credit team in dealing with tariffs.\n\nWhat Would Marco Polo Think of Cryptocurrency? History’s lessons on currency\n\nBy: Angela Lawson\n\nIn the many years since Marco Polo’s day, we’ve learned a number of lessons. Some, like we saw in the late 19th and early 20th century in the U.S., showed us the value of less friction, more clarity, clear governance and trusted monetary authorities to support commerce. The question is, does token currency fit this mold?\n\nVolume 24, Number 3, 3rd Quarter 2018\n\nHurry up and Wait: Assessing the Challenges of Blockchain Adoption\n\nBy: Angela Lawson\n\nThe tongue-in-cheek notion that everyone rushes to get somewhere only to find variables outside of their control forcing forward motion to a screeching halt is probably familiar to anyone waiting in a security line at the airport. But in the end, almost everyone gets where they need to go. Something happens. It just might not be exactly what or when we expect. Blockchain, in its early stage lifecycle, fits this mold and is authoring its next chapter.\n\nAn Update on Customer-Demanded Supplier Concession Strategies, and Supplier Responses (Beyond Saying No)\n\nBy: Scott Blakeley\n\nCustomer-demanded supplier concession will continue to increase so as to improve cash flow and working capital at the expense of suppliers. The credit team must educate the sales team and management that customer-demanded supplier concessions can significantly erode margins. These concessions are the new normal for suppliers, and the credit team must use its credit and financial insight to determine the appropriate credit risk and the added costs these bring.\n\nFinancial Statements Do Not Tell the Whole Story\n\nBy: Kenneth A. Rosen\n\nThe lenses of an attorney will look beyond the standard financial statements. A review looks beneath the covers and with a view of ratios, debt structure, trends, cash, and offers insight into the shorter-term viability of a firm. In this article, the author reviews the financial analysis of a fictitious company to highlight what financial statements sometimes do not reveal, what detail is reviewed through the lenses of legal, and to highlight where the analyst should ask more questions.\n\nIn the Business of Going Out of Business: What Unsecured Creditors Need to Know About Liquidation Agreements\n\nBy: David M. Posner and Kelly E. Moynihan\n\nThe “Retail Apocalypse” has arguably been upon us for the last decade and continues to be a force today. From January 2006 through September 2017, 46% of all retail bankruptcy filings with more than $50 million in liabilities resulted in liquidations. This percentage excludes more recent high-profile liquidations such as Toys “R” Us and The Bon-Ton Stores, which filed for Chapter 11 and liquidated after September 2017. In situations where liquidation may be inevitable, unsecured creditors should be aware of the typical terms of a liquidator agency agreement and certain issues that may arise thereunder in order to ensure the highest possible recovery on an unsecured claim. This article examines “going out of business” sales generally, the most common terms of liquidator agency agreements, including fee structures, and steps unsecured creditors can take to protect themselves and their consigned goods in a challenging liquidation scenario.\n\nVolume 24, Number 2, 2nd Quarter 2018\n\nRobotics vs. Machine Learning vs. Artificial Intelligence: Identifying the Right Tools for the Right Problems\n\nBy: Shankar Bellam\n\nUnderstanding the buzz about Artificial Intelligence is critical as it has attracted the attention of the senior finance community. The below body of work defines Machine Learning (ML), Robotic Process Automation (RPA) and Artificial Intelligence (AI), and the necessary knowhow of how it works. The article also addresses the capabilities of AI in helping the financial risk community address processes and tasks that impact their process flow.\n\nSupply Chain Bankruptcy Preference Releases: Good News for the Credit Team, But Watch for the Claim Offset\n\nBy: Scott Blakeley\n\nIn managing credit risk with an insolvent customer, the seasoned credit team also appreciates not just the A/R risk, but the preference risk should the customer file bankruptcy, or an out of court liquidation such as an Assignment for Benefit of Creditors. In some settings, suppliers may have larger exposure with preferences than with A/R. The welcome news for suppliers is that a number of large Chapter 11 filings have included supplier preference releases as part of their negotiated exit from Chapter 11. But with a provision in a Chapter 11 that provides for a preference release, suppliers holding priority claims should be mindful that the debtor may take back the supplier chain preference release through a reserved claim objection.\n\nPost 2010 Amendments, Article 9 of the Uniform Commercial Code is Popping Up in Courts\n\nBy: Kristin Alford\n\nThis article focuses on avoidable errors that eliminate a creditor’s security, and why it is imperative that you comply with the requirements under Article 9. Compliance is rewarded, and creditors have prevailed when their security interests have been perfected.\n\nVolume 24, Number 1, 1st Quarter 2018\n\nProactive Collections Management: Using Artificial Intelligence to Predict Invoice Payment Dates\n\nBy: Sonali Nanda\n\nMachine Learning, being the hottest trend today, is incredibly powerful for predictions or calculated suggestions based on large amounts of data. As businesses from many industries have begun to rely more heavily on machines to do the heavy lifting of A/R processes, executives are able to deliver more value to their customers by reflecting on their roles and identifying the opportunities machine learning could offer them.\n\nSupplier Pacts, the Antitrust Laws and the Poultry Supplier Suits: Takeaways for a Group Collection Strategy\n\nBy: Scott Blakeley\n\nThis article refines the supplier pact collection strategy and compliance with the antitrust laws by considering recent lawsuits filed by customers against poultry suppliers for allegedly violating the Sherman Act antitrust law by collectively limiting production as a strategy to raise prices.\n\nFinancial Best Practices in Shared Services Technology: Part II 2015-2018\n\nBy: Chris Caparon\n\nThirty-six months does not seem like a very long time, but in ‘technology-years’, a lot can change. Unfortunately for many, their order-to-cash tools today (out of necessity) are still spreadsheets and Pivot-Tables. Three years ago, the Credit Research Foundation and Cforia collaborated on a Webinar discussing how global enterprises were improving order-to-cash (OTC) and taking advantage of new Shared Services Organizations (SSO) and Financial Shared Services Center (FSSC) approaches. We also talked about new OTC disciplines and analytics, new business processes and new technologies. There has been a great deal of progress made in all of these areas. That is the subject of this article.\n\nVolume 23, Number 4, 4th Quarter 2017\n\nThe Recent Past, Present and Future of Retailing\n\nBy: Steven C. Isberg, Ph.D.\n\nThe world of retail over the past 40 years has been intensely complex, competitive, disrupted, and therefore, significantly dynamic. Over that time, the pace of change in the general retailing industry has quickened, especially when it comes to consolidation across the industry, and even between retailing and other industries. A perfect example of this is CVS Healthcare, which went from being a straight pharmacy retailer into a business model that first combined it with pharmacy benefit provision (e.g., the CVS/Caremark merger) and now broadening the model into general health and other forms of insurance with its prospective acquisition of Aetna. Along the way, CVS has become a diversified provider of healthcare services, moving itself into competition with hospitals and other medical provider groups, which in part has led to the need for those providers to merge and consolidate in order to remain competitive.\n\nIt would take a book-length piece to cover everything that is going on in retailing today. In the absence of that space, this review will focus on several key questions and limit its coverage to the transformation of the department store segment of the industry. Understanding the changes taking place in this segment will enhance the reader’s understanding of the changes taking place across a broad variety of retail sectors.\n\nUsing Big Data Beyond Credit Applications\n\nBy: Kerri Byron\n\nIf there were a list of most used terms in business, “big data” would have surely topped it this year. Everyone has heard the buzz word and likely read an article or two on the topic, yet many still don’t fully understand exactly what big data is or that it can be used in a variety of business applications. Specifically in the credit industry, there is enormous potential for big data to change the way decisions are made and predict the next move of businesses before they even know what it might be. But outside of just credit scoring lives an untapped capacity to turn raw data into actionable insights, empowering businesses of all sizes and among all industries to increase efficiency through a combination of intelligent data sets and highly effective technology platforms.\n\nVolume 23, Number 3, 3rd Quarter 2017\n\nApplying Machine Learning to Leverage Big Data for Commercial Credit Scoring\n\nBy: Chintan Trivedi, Irina Rabinovich and Shyarsh Desai\n\nCommercial credit risk scores are essential for creditors who need efficient and consistent means to measure the risk associated with their trading partners. Traditionally, credit scoring has been based on point systems derived by human experts relying on their domain knowledge and intuition to pick the factors contributing to the model. The relative weights of these factors would then be tested and tuned until the overall score would reach a seemingly satisfactory outcome. However, the modern era of big data brings volumes and complexity of information that are impossible for the human mind to comprehend cohesively. Current machine learning technology allows us to utilize all data available and to shift from traditional ad-hoc models to systematic models that are accurate, efficient, and objective. The authors highlight advantages of these models by using a well-known machine learning algorithm – artificial neural network – to predict future delinquency in business-to-business transactions. The data shows that on a test sample of 40,000 unique companies, the neural network based model achieved 30% higher prediction accuracy than the traditional models currently used by many credit departments and credit rating agencies. Further demonstrated is both the flexibility and scalability of machine learning derived models using two case studies. First, a significant accuracy improvement of 8% in prediction of delinquency is observed for the hospitals sector by assimilating publicly available Medicare data into the model, which would take a human analyst a great effort to incorporate. Second, building the model using the neural network algorithm with the same predictors as in the traditional Altman’s Z-Score yields a 13% improvement in bankruptcy prediction. This illustrates that a machine learning derived model can automatically adapt to changes in input data patterns — an infeasible task for a human analyst, especially when measured over long periods of time.\n\nAssessing Public Company Financial Risk by Crowdsourcing the Research of Credit Professionals\n\nBy: Camilo Gomez, Ph.D.\n\nThis article will discuss how crowdsourcing the research activity of corporate credit professionals provides an early warning of business counterparty financial risk. It demonstrates how crowdsourcing makes it possible to leverage trade creditors, a vital group of risk managers who control access to a major source of a corporation’s working capital, and highlights the factors which allow for crowdsourcing to provide actionable guidance.\n\nResizing Big Data: How Modern Credit Teams Can Leverage Data for Innovation and Growth\n\nBy: Tracey Panek\n\nThe transformation of finance leaders “from scorekeeper to strategic partner” is not new but the focus from C-suites is emphasizing strategic insights from credit professional more today than it ever has in the past. Gone are the days of localized spreadsheets, data driven analysis has moved in. This article will address “Big Data” form the “Credit Suite” with a focus on the following areas:\n\nWhy Big Data Matters\n\nThe Changing Role of Credit and Finance\n\nBig Data’s Impact on Credit and Finance\n\nThe Data Quality Challenge\n\nFinance’s Role in Leveraging Data for Growth\n\nThe Value of Partnership Data\n\nVolume 23, Number 2, 2nd Quarter 2017\n\nThe Use of the DuPont Formula and a Bankruptcy Forecasting Model in Court Proceedings: Reorganization versus Liquidation Decisions\n\nBy: Richard D. Gritta and James Jurinski\n\nThe number of bankruptcy filings in the energy/petroleum sector has recently soared worldwide due to the slowdown of the Chinese economy. A more general increase occurred because of the severe economic downturn resulting from the real estate crisis, which started in 2007-2008. U.S., U.K. and E.U. law all provide for some sort of bankruptcy reorganizations but the legal details as well as the practical results vary. Voluntary reorganizations are far more common in the U.S. Given the court procedures specified by the 1978 Bankruptcy Reform Act, the ultimate decision to reorganize the business or liquidate the assets hinges on whether the bankruptcy court confirms a plan to allow the firm to continue in existence. That requires that it is deemed to be a viable entity during the proceedings. Two powerful tools of financial management can be an important help in this process. The DuPont formula sheds light on key variables that influence profitability, and the Altman Z Score Model has been used many times to forecast the coming financial distress and failure of many types of manufacturing and transportation companies. Both can also be used to plan a turnaround, as will be documented in this paper.\n\nUnderstanding the Different Elements of the Valuation Model in the Anatomy of a Predictable Bankruptcy, With Application to the Retail Landscape (The Sports Authority as an Example)\n\nBy: Steven C. Isberg, Ph.D.\n\nThis article will: 1) demonstrate the use of the operating and equity free cash flow methods of valuation in determining the value of a highly leveraged transaction; 2) identify and explain the meaning of the external funds needed as a result of the balance sheet forecast; and 3) demonstrate how scenario analysis of both the external funds needed and valuation can enable a clearer understanding of the risk of financial distress inherent in many transactions. The Sports Authority case is used as the vehicle for accomplishing these purposes.\n\nCreating Single View of Cash Across Global Finance Operations\n\nBy: Chris Caparon\n\nAs the economy resets itself, two of the highest-ranked changes anticipated for this year is “redeploying capacity” and “developing and implementing finance KPIs and information/reporting strategies.” This article addresses 7 key working capital strategies in this new economic climate.\n\nVolume 23, Number 1, 1st Quarter 2017\n\nEffectively Managing Outsourcing Risk by Engaging Service Providers that Have Effective Internal Controls Verified by an Independent Attester\n\nBy: Brian Ballou, Megan Gerhardt and Dan L. Heitger\n\nIt is increasingly important that companies, especially large ones, have proper internal controls and procedures by requiring their third party providers (goods and services) be SAE16 Type 2 certified annually.\n\nA recently published paper by researchers at the Isaac & Oxley Center for Business Leadership (the same Oxley as in Sarbanes-Oxley) at Miami University’s Farmer School of Business discusses the high importance of ensuring certain of your accounts management service providers are certified by an independent attester as having proper controls and procedures.\n\nIn the paper, “Effectively Managing Outsourcing Risk by Engaging Service Providers that Have Effective Internal Controls Verified by an Independent Attester” the authors suggest that “in an increasingly complex, real time, global business environment” companies rely more on process outsourcing (any third party provider of goods or services) including A/R management and collections. Companies choose to outsource parts of, or their entire, A/R management and collection processes for a variety of reasons, including offloading non-core processes, reducing costs, improving operational performance, and gaining operational expertise.\n\nUnder the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, public companies are required to have in place internal controls to ensure that senior management and the Board sufficiently oversee and manage financial reporting and risks that could have material impacts on the company’s financials. The study authors argue, however, that even privately-held companies should themselves ensure they have in place similar internal controls.\n\nThe paper suggests that companies should ensure their outsourcing A/R management and collections vendors (or for that matter any third party relationship – goods or services) are properly certified with the SSAE16 Type 2 certifications. SSAE16 Type 2 certification is a standard set by the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants (AICPA), and since June 2011, SSAE16 audits have replaced SAS 70 audits.\n\nNew Collection Analytics – Producing Greater Value within OTC (Order-to-Cash) Processes\n\nBy: Chris Caparon\n\nFriar Luca Bartolomeo de Pacioli (1447–1517, Tuscany), was a contemporary, collaborator and teacher of math in Milan, Italy in 1497, to Leonardo da Vinci (1452-1519). Friar Luca is also considered to be the “Father of Accounting and Bookkeeping.” He was the first person to publish a work on the double-entry accounting system and is credited with the accounting formula: Equity = Assets – Liabilities\n\nNow, roll forward to 2017 and think of Friar Luca when you are calmly trying to explain, to your insistent customer, why they simply can’t take another unearned discount off their already past due Accounts Receivable balance!\n\nThere is hope. Finance management is finding ways to “move the working capital needle” and they are changing how order-to-cash teams operate in very material ways with new and very different approaches.\n\nA Best Practice Guide in Methodology and Implementation of Receivable Management System Transformation\n\nBy: Anuj Saxena and Jay Tchakarov\n\nThe latest innovation in credit and accounts receivable technologies have brought in tremendous efficiencies to finance departments worldwide.\n\nWhile the promise of technology is a given, there is always a chasm between promise of technology and real world results. The idiosyncrasies associated with either a specific firm or a specific process increase the complexity of fitting technology to business process. Such complexities eventually widen the chasm between expectations and reality. Research conducted by Panorama Consulting corroborates these findings, revealing that close to 54% of ERP implementations met less than 50% of their stated objectives.\n\nThis body of work discusses the best practices to be followed during pre-implementation, implementation and post implementation phases for successful receivables transformation projects.\n\nVolume 22, Number 4, 4th Quarter 2016\n\nResolving Trade Promotion Deductions Faster: A Value Based Approach to Automation for A/R Leaders\n\nBy: Tara Gallagher\n\nAutomation plays a crucial role in helping companies return their focus on the high value activities. This article analyzes the nature of deductions and the best-in-class automation options available for speeding up the resolution process.\n\nRobotic Process Automation: The Next Transformation Lever for Shared Services\n\nBy: Professor Mary Lacity and Professor Leslie Willcocks\n\nResearch Objective: The academic researchers at the Outsourcing Unit (OU) aim to assess the current and long-term effects of business services automation on client organizations. While using software to automate work is not a new idea, recent interest in service automation has certainly escalated with the introduction of new technologies including Robotic Process Automation (RPA) and Cognitive Intelligence (CI) tools. Many potential adopters of the new types of service automation tools remain skeptical about the claims surrounding its promised business value. Potential adopters need exposure to actual and realistic client adoption stories. Academic researchers can help educate potential adopters by objectively researching actual RPA and CI implementations in client firms, by assessing what the software can and cannot yet do, and by extracting lessons on realizing its value.\n\nResearch Outputs: As of December 2015, we have just submitted our book, Service Automation: Robotics and the Future of Work, to the publisher. This book captures a year’s worth of learning about service automation based on a survey, in-depth client case studies, and interviews with service automation clients, providers, and advisors. The lessons learned address defining a service automation strategy, launching successful service automation initiatives, preparing the organization for the changes service automation induces, and building enterprise-wide service automation capabilities. We continue to study service automation, and this working paper focuses on the adoption of RPA in shared service organizations and presents new research, cases and lessons that complement the book’s findings.\n\nCredit Team Due Diligence, Setting Terms (Normal and Extended) and Risk Evaluation: Antitrust and Contractual Restrictions on Information Gathering and Sharing\n\nBy: Scott Blakeley, Esq.\n\nThis body of work explores the antitrust and contractual restrictions to a credit team’s information requests in the credit setting/validation process. The federal antitrust laws – the Sherman Act and the Robinson-Patman Act, as well as social media sites and customer contractual restrictions, are considered as data points and are evaluated in the decisioning of credit risk.\n\nVolume 22, Number 3, 3rd Quarter 2016\n\nA Little More You Need to Know About the “Ordinary Course of Business” and “New Value” Preference Defenses\n\nBy: Bruce S. Nathan, Esq., David M. Banker, Esq., Eric S. Chafetz, Esq. and Barry Z. Bazian, Esq.\n\nThis article discusses recent court decisions that have further developed the law regarding the application of the ordinary course of business and new value preference defenses. The article is intended to update two previously published articles: Everything You Need To Know About The “Ordinary Course of Business” Preference Defense, And More! published in Volume 19, Number 1, 1st Quarter 2013 and Everything You Need to Know About New Value as a Preference Defense, and More published in Volume 17, Number 2, 2nd Quarter 2011.\n\nUsing Purchase & Payment Behavior Data to Mitigate and Evaluate Risk\n\nBy: Kerri Byron\n\nBehavioral data provides a wealth of knowledge for credit managers and financial executives. The most robust data is acquired by pooling information from different areas of business, ensuring a broader and more accurate overview of their customers, suppliers, and prospects. This includes bifurcating data pools to understand payment patterns and spend analysis for robust and in-depth decisioning.\n\nThe 8-Ball of Customer Portfolio Segmentation for Finance\n\nBy: Abigail Lutte\n\nIf you’ve found yourself sweating in a smoky billiard room, wondering about what role customer data should play in finance – as well as in your company’s long-term strategy – this document provides a tool for Finance Leaders – a strategy to unify disparate customer data with business strategy ROI.\n\nVolume 22, Number 2, 2nd Quarter 2016\n\nForecasting Small Business Default Using Cost of Capital\n\nBy: John Theis and K. Michael Casey\n\nDetermining the likelihood of default is critical for all credit organizations, whether lending to large publicly traded firms or small private firms. This body of work offers a methodology to apply risk based analytics to small and private businesses.\n\nSeriously Misleading, Standard Search Logic, Noise Words, Name Changes & Avoidance: The Importance of Correctly Identifying the Debtor in Compliance with Article 9 of the Uniform Commercial Code\n\nBy: Kristin Alford\n\nWhile some creditors attempt to search online for a debtor’s business name, minor alterations to the name or the inclusion of a d/b/a could be fatal to the filing. Critical to a filing of a security instrument is the perfection of the legal name of the business.\n\nCrisis Driven Collections Headcount Management or Moving OTC from Reactive to Proactive\n\nBy: Chris Caparon\n\nThis “Crisis-Driven” environment is pervasive across most organizations. In response to the latest crisis deux jour, management typically allocates minimum resources based on crisis needs. This body of works explores balancing task requirements for full portfolio coverage in a flexible business environment.\n\nBonding Off Liens\n\nBy: Kristin Alford\n\nA Surety Bond Claim occurs when the principal on a surety bond does not fulfill their obligations agreed to within the bond language, and the surety bond obligee claims the principal has defaulted on the surety bond.\n\nVolume 22, Number 1, 1st Quarter 2016\n\nSeven More Reasons Why Customers (the small and mid-sized are joining the largest) are Adopting a Terms Push Back Strategy and What Suppliers Can Do to Fight Back\n\nBy: Scott Blakeley, Esq.\n\nCredit teams are witnessing more financially sound customers disregard supplier-set terms and unilaterally extend these terms with a so-called terms pushback strategy (TPS), as the NYT’s reports in “Big Companies Pay Later, Squeezing Their Suppliers.” While TPS allows the customer to preserve working capital, improve cash flow and grow inventory, the supplier’s DSO and profit margin suffers. A key metric for the customer’s finance team is now days payable outstanding (DPO).\n\nCustomer Data Harmonization /A Single View of Customer Truth\n\nBy: Chris Caparon\n\nMergers, acquisitions and today’s global landscape provides both complexity and opportunity to in the practice of “Master Data Management” (MDM). Disparate platforms, data consistency, regional/governmental policy and pure economics should not inhibit the credit team’s ability to provide global data standards in a manner that enhances the functional deliverables in a diverse environment.\n\nGrowth Performance and Prospects for the U.S. Economy: An Analysis of Long Term Rates and Trends\n\nBy: Steven C. Isberg, Ph.D.\n\nAs the Federal Reserve has now backed away from monetary stimulus as a tool to encourage growth, at least three significant items should now appear on the credit professional’s radar screen. The piece provides an introspective into monetary policy, income distribution, historical economic trends and the broad impacts to growth in the U.S. and global economies.\n\nVolume 21, Number 4, 4th Quarter 2015\n\nThe Economy in 2016: A Global Perspective from Dun & Bradstreet\n\nBy: Bodhi Ganguli Ph.D.\n\nAccording to Dun & Bradstreet’s economists, the year 2016 will hold both numerous challenges for the post-recession global economy, as well as some positive indicators for the United States. Trends such as an emerging market growth slowdown, increased supply chain risk, monetary policy easing, the volatility of financial markets and the slow recovery process of the OECD all play into Dun & Bradstreet’s risky forecast for the globe in 2016. In contrast, Dun & Bradstreet’s proprietary US Economic Health Tracker and Small Business Health Index (BHI) both indicate that the US is poised for a strong year in 2016 compared to many regions of the world.\n\nA Merton View through Altman Lenses of Oil and Gas Drilling Contractors\n\nBy: John Theis, Ph.D., JD\n\nThis study uses a market measure for screening companies to rank firms’ credit prospects. The paper compares the market result with an accounting statement based approach. It uses a popularization of Merton’s distance to default, a methodology coming from the Black Scholes Option Pricing model and compares results with Altman’s Z Score. The sample firms consist of seventeen publicly traded drilling contractors.\n\nA History of Credit Card Transaction Costs and the Suppliers Newly Minted Right to Surcharge to Make Credit Cards a More Competitive Payment Channel\n\nBy: Scott Blakeley, Esq. & Ruth Fagan, Esq.\n\nIn every credit card transaction, major credit card companies impose a fee on merchants, including suppliers in the B2B space, to process the payment by cardholders. Tracing the convoluted history of the origins of that fee stretches back more than half a century. That history may provide context for a supplier evaluating whether to surcharge, or pass the interchange fee to customers.\n\nThe Business Case for Automating Payments Processing and Cash Application\n\nBy: Jay Tchakarov\n\nThis article will help you develop a business case for justifying investments in an automated cash application system.\n\nThroughout the paper are examples of actual improvements and efficiencies from automation efforts realized by businesses we have closely worked with over the years.\n\nThose responsible for incoming payments processing and cash application are acutely aware of the need for automated systems to reduce or eliminate the time required by the numerous manual tasks in the end-to-end process. Freeing up resources tied to cash application is one of the single biggest opportunities to enable improvements throughout Accounts Receivables. Accounts Receivables (A/R) often makes up 40% of the assets on a company’s balance sheet, and effective management is critical. Automating as much of receivables management as possible is a proven method for achieving savings, improving days sales outstanding (DSO), and maximizing operational efficiencies. And cash application is a process that, due to its low value-add nature and manual nature, is a prime candidate for automation through technology.\n\nA key challenge in technology purchases is gaining approval from upper level executives who require formal analysis and justification. As a result, it’s necessary to have a strong sales mindset when your funding request competes against other projects for capital and operating budget dollars. In many companies, IT projects must be justified through formal processes that detail the spending requirements and estimated savings to produce a return on investment (ROI) measurement. Justifying a project that does not require capital expenditures, such as subscribing to a Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) solution, will often prove easier and less time-consuming for companies where such a solution is a fit.\n\nThis whitepaper will help you develop a business case for justifying investments in an automated cash application system. The paper will focus on (1) the ways to identify and quantify the benefits from automating cash application, (2) how to calculate the financial return, and (3) how to prepare a business case to gain executive approval. Throughout the paper are examples of actual improvements and efficiencies from payment processing automation efforts, as seen by Account Receivables departments across industries and sectors.\n\nVolume 21, Number 3, 3rd Quarter 2015\n\nThe Power of Beliefs\n\nBy: Scott Hunter\n\nAre you clear about what you believe? Do you understand what motivates you to take the actions you take and do the things you do? Are you satisfied with the results you’re presently producing?\n\nI ask these questions because there is a definite cause and effect relationship between your beliefs and your results. Stated simply, but accurately, your beliefs determine your thoughts and emotions, those determine your actions and your actions determine your results. So in the world of cause and effect, beliefs are cause and results are the effects.\n\nUnlike Fine Wine, Deductions Do Not Grow Better With Age…\n\nBy: Chris Caparon\n\nHow big of a problem are Disputes, Short-Pays, Deductions and Unearned-Discounts for American businesses today?\n\nUsing Credit Research Foundation (CRF) Survey results, Deductions negatively impact Accounts Receivables (A/R) somewhere between 1% and 5%.\n\nUsing conservative Deductions averages and taking the United States Federal Reserve 2015 Q1 calculation for “Non-Financial Business; Trade Receivables; Assets” of $3.422 Trillion dollars, this works out to Deductions being a $34.4B to $171.1B a year problem…in the U.S. alone.\n\nNo surprise, the Dispute “buck” stops with Credit & Collections departments to resolve it, statistically over 80% of the time. Per CRF findings, resolution includes “the initial investigation and research of customer deductions – 84% say this group has primary responsibility for following up with customers to collect invalid or unjustified deductions as well.”\n\nTerms Pushback and the Supplier Decision Tree with the Indispensable Customer: Supply Chain Finance (Customer) Versus Early Pay Discount or Holding the A/R to Term (Supplier)\n\nBy: Scott Blakeley, Esq. & Larry Lipschutz, CCE, CCIP\n\nCredit teams are witnessing more financially sound customers disregard supplier-set terms and unilaterally extend these terms with a so-called terms pushback strategy (TPS), as the NYT reports in “Big Companies Pay Later, Squeezing Their Suppliers.” While TPS allows the customer to preserve working capital, improve cash flow and grow inventory, the supplier’s DSO and profit margins suffer. A key metric for the customer’s finance team is now Days Payable Outstanding (DPO).\n\nLarge companies are often not requesting – but demanding – extended terms for their entire supplier’s base by using the trade leverage of threatening to cut suppliers from their supply chain if they do not accept the TPS. Where the customer rolling out the unilateral TPS is considered by the supplier’s leadership as an indispensable account because of volume and product mix, the supplier is willing to overlook the increased DSO and credit risk, add erosion of profit margins a TPS brings, and deem the customer as one to keep notwithstanding the TPS.\n\nWhere an indispensable customer rolls out a TPS, the credit team may welcome a customer-sponsored Supply Chain Finance Program (SCFP) versus offering the customer an early pay discount (EPD) or holding the receivable for the extended term (HR) in response to a TPS. This article considers the supplier’s options.\n\nAltman’s Z-Score Meets The Risk Management Association Statement Studies\n\nBy: John Theis & K. Michael Casey\n\nThe Risk Management Association publishes a book of statement studies that compiles financial data by industry that includes public and private firms, but is there a way of examining the average firm for credit quality to get a sense of industry credit quality? Combining Altman’s Z-score for privately held firms with the RMA average firm, a credit score for the average firm in the industry generates a brief snippet of industry credit quality. While not enough to grant credit without more investigation, it provides a basis to start.\n\nVolume 21, Number 2, 2nd Quarter 2015\n\nLien Waivers: Aren’t They All the Same? Understanding the Primary Types of Lien Waivers\n\nBy: Kristin Alford\n\nLien Waivers are common in construction credit. Project owners will often require lien waivers from contractors, subcontractors & suppliers to alleviate the possibility of subsequent mechanic’s lien filings. Lien Waivers are also one of the most misunderstood and misused documents in construction credit. It is crucial for all credit professionals to understand the verbiage, potential remedies and potential consequences of lien waivers, prior to signing the document.\n\nThe American Bankruptcy Institute Commission’s Chapter 11 Reform Recommendations: What it Means to Suppliers to Financially Distressed Customers\n\nBy: Scott Blakeley, Esq.\n\nAfter years of deliberation, the American Bankruptcy Institute released its highly anticipated Final Report of Proposals and Recommendations on Reforming Chapter 11 of the US Bankruptcy Code (the “Report”) on December 8, 2014. The Commission centered its study on the premise that the economic landscape today is drastically different than that of the last major overhaul of corporate reorganization law in 1978. Further, there has been a substantial increase in pre-packaged and sale-of-assets cases in addition to an obvious reduction in distribution to unsecured creditors in sale-of-assets cases. The proposed changes are aimed at offering more tools to resolve a customer’s financial distress in a cost-effective and efficient manner.\n\nTo that end, the recommended principles also affect supplier’s rights. How exactly do the Report’s recommendations impact the supplier? Does the supplier have greater protections and rights as a result of these proposals? With these questions in mind, this paper identifies and explains ten proposals identified as having the biggest potential impact on the supplier selling the financially distressed customer.\n\nThe More Things Change….OTC Best Practices in a Financial Shared Service Center (FSSC) Environment\n\nBy: Chris Caparon\n\nOddly enough the person who wrote “The more things change, the more they stay the same” (paraphrased) was a French author, Jean-Baptiste Karr, in 1849. But, as a 2015 order to cash (OTC) finance process axiom, this saying still holds true today…for many things, including Shared Services.\n\nThe Strategic Value of Invoice-to-Cash Best Practices\n\nBy: Mitch Rose\n\nThe Invoice-to-Cash process is an often overlooked and under-leveraged opportunity to drive business efficiency, increase cash flow, and strengthen customer relationships. Companies that approach this process with strategic goals in mind gain considerable advantage over those that do not. While it is certainly important for a business to recognize, and focus, on reducing the costs involved in the invoice-to-cash process (people, material, equipment, IT time, bank fees, postage), the benefits go much further.\n\nAs part of a 21st-century invoice-to-cash strategy, companies should look beyond the operational aspects and explore the specialized knowledge, experience and technology required to offer a world-class invoice-to-cash system that gives them a strategic advantage. In essence, a strategy that allows a company to achieve optimal functionality, maximum business impact and excellence in customer satisfaction. Based on in-depth interviews with businesses that have transformed their approaches to invoice-to-cash, this article examines the opportunity to use this process to create strategic value.\n\nVolume 21, Number 1, 1st Quarter 2015\n\nElectronic Signatures, Agreements & Documents; The Recipe for Enforceability and Admissibility\n\nBy: Bruce S. Nathan & Terence D. Watson\n\nMore and more businesses are conducting their transactions electronically. Congress and state legislatures have facilitated this expansion of electronic commerce by enacting laws that govern the validity of electronically signed documents and electronic transactions. The Electronic Signatures in Global and National Commerce Act, enacted in 2000 and frequently referred to as the “E Sign Act”, is the federal statute governing electronic transactions and electronic signatures. The Uniform Electronic Transaction Act (“UETA”) is the state law counterpart to the E-Sign Act. UETA has been adopted by 47 states, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico and the United States Virgin Islands. UETA makes the E-Sign Act applicable to electronic signatures and electronic transactions that are governed by state law. The E-Sign Act and UETA treat electronic transactions and signatures the same as conventional ink and paper documents and transactions.\n\nThe E-Sign Act, UETA and the other laws governing electronic transactions also prescribe the rules that must be followed in order to ensure the validity of electronically signed documents and electronic transactions. For example, the E-Sign Act and UETA require parties to agree to conduct their transactions electronically. However, these laws do not prescribe all of the requirements for admitting electronic agreements and other electronic documents into evidence in a court proceeding. This article discusses the requirements for both valid electronic agreements and other electronic documents, and admitting them into evidence in a litigation.\n\nTop 10 Best Practices in Order to Cash (OTC) Project Management\n\nBy: Chris Caparon\n\nThe Credit Research Foundation (CRF) recently completed its “Economic Projections Report for 2015” and the results are consistent with Deloitte’s annual “Fourth Quarter 2014 CFO Signals Survey” findings, recently reported in the Wall Street Journal.\n\nThe consensus directives coming from North American CFOs to their finance and accounting teams: 1)Ensure business performance by establishing new cost efficiencies, financial plans and analytical approaches; 2)Manage operating risk through risk management strategies and systems; 3)Manage balance sheet risk by strengthening balance sheets, ensuring liquidity and managing interest rate and foreign exchange exposure.\n\nNot surprisingly, the CRF membership and order-to-cash (OTC) teams wield a great deal of sway over how most of these key 2015 CFO business objectives can be accomplished. Particularly “plans and analytic approaches”, “strategies and systems” and specifically “strengthening balance sheets.”\n\nDelaware Bankruptcy Court Writes Two New Opinions on Summary Judgment Based on Ordinary Course of Business Defense\n\nBy: Rafael X. Zahralddin-Aravena, Shelley A. Kinsella & Eric M. Sutty\n\nA motion for summary judgment is a procedural device used to dismiss certain issues from the case or, under certain circumstances, the entire case itself. As credit managers, if you have ever been sued for a preference, you likely have wished that you had something to level the playing field against a plaintiff who often, it seems, has all the cards in the deck stacked in their favor. The motion for summary judgment is a motion filed by one of the parties seeking to obtain a judgment on all or part of the case in a summary fashion. An issue or case which is decided by summary judgment cannot be presented to a judge or jury at trial. The motion for summary judgment can decide the whole case, or certain key issues, without the need for a trial. In essence, if it is consistent with your overall legal strategy, you can reduce your legal spending by having certain issues decided without a costly trial, and, in some cases you can win your case without having to go to trial. Judge Christopher S. Sontchi of the United States Bankruptcy Court of the District of Delaware issued two recent opinions regarding a commonly used defense in preference actions which should help trade creditors better understand the use of summary judgment in ordinary course of business defenses.\n\nThe Technology Start Up Company, the Culture of Business Failure in This Age of Innovation and Supplier Credit Risk: What it Means to the Credit Team\n\nBy: Scott Blakeley\n\nThe US economy is transitioning from manufacturing-based to service-based. With this transition, technology is at the forefront of nearly all industries, transforming markets and industries. Industries such as health care, education, finance and government are at the initial stage of dramatic change to their industries brought on by technology. One beneficiary of the transition to a service-based economy is technology startups (TSU), who are receiving record venture capital funding for their startups. A TSU is a recently formed private company backed by venture investment, with the valuation based on the price that pre-IPO investors pay for the TSU’s equity.\n\nVolume 20, Number 4, 4th Quarter 2014\n\nReducing Risk Through Blended Credit Profiles\n\nBy: Torsten Gerwien & Sung Park\n\nWhen attempting to determine a small business’s credit risk, which is more useful, the company’s credit history or its owner’s? For decades, conventional wisdom has held that a business owner’s personal credit history alone can be used to judge his or her company’s creditworthiness. Many lenders have tended to see small businesses and small-business owners as one and the same, their funds so frequently commingled as to make the two entities virtually indistinguishable.\n\nHowever, this strategy is not always successful. A business owner with good personal credit still can have a failing company, and someone whose personal credit is messy still can own a successful business.\n\nSince a bad call can cost a creditor thousands – perhaps tens of thousands – of dollars, Experian® decided to test the conventional wisdom for itself.\n\nCommercial Debt Collection in the UK\n\nBy: John H Rochman\n\nDebt Collection in a Recession\n\nWe, or at least some of us, are hopefully now emerging from one of the longest economic recessions in modern times. No one country is yet completely in the clear, although it appears that the US may well be on the way to full recovery. The position in Europe is not so clear. The British economy is slowly recovering, but that recovery remains fragile. The Eurozone crisis has severely dented business confidence and investment in the future. Europe’s banks are still suffering from liquidity problems. Greece, Spain, Italy, France and Portugal all have problems of varying magnitude. There is high unemployment in Greece and Spain. Italy is only strong – if at all – in the north and certainly has severe economic problems as do a variety of European countries. Lenders are unwilling to invest in businesses, even those with a healthy balance sheet, let alone those suffering from cash-flow issues. Bills are, therefore, going unpaid and the bills from creditors who are 4,000 miles away sink to the bottom of the pile.\n\nA Glossary of Key Terms for the Vendor to Surcharge to Make Card Payments a Price Competitive Payment Channel\n\nBy: Scott Blakeley, Esq. & Brad Boe\n\nCustomers have payment channel choices, whether traditional (paper check) to modern (ACH, echeck, wire, cards). Customers in the B2B space are increasingly using credit cards to pay vendor invoices. The Wall Street Journal reports the share of U.S. companies that pay vendors by credit"
