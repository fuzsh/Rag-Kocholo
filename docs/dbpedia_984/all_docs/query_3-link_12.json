        "text": "Theology 501: Special Topics in Catholic Apologetics (2 credits)\n\nWith Dr. Timothy T. O’Donnell\n\nInstitute Dean and Professor of Theology\n\nAs part of the New Evangelization called for by the Church, this course presents the basic arguments for the credibility of the Catholic Faith and natural law. Students will develop cogent arguments for defense to serve as effective means of persuasion. Topics range from God’s existence and the problem of evil to the historical reality of Jesus Christ and the mystery of the human person at the center of the New Evangelization.\n\nHistory 501: Ireland and the Western Ethos (2 credits)\n\nWith Dr. Michael Kelly\n\nProfessor of History\n\nAmong all the nations of Europe, Ireland boasts a unique and stirring history. With due attention to extant literary and archaeological source material, this course seeks to illumine that history, from pre-Christian times through the trauma of early modernity. The first evangelization of Ireland’s Celtic chieftains, the achievements of the island’s medieval monasteries and missionaries, the connections between Ireland and continental civilization, and the fierce resistance to the Elizabethan settlement will all be important themes. Moreover, this course is complemented in a special way by the excursions, as the recent history of Ireland—from the Ulster Plantation to the famine and the Civil War—is there to be read in the very folds of the Donegal countryside.\n\nLiterature 501: Christian Imagination and Prominent Irish and Continental Writers (2 credits)\n\nWith Prof. Sharon Mahoney Hickson\n\nProfessor of Literature\n\nThis course surveys fiction, drama, and poetry drawn from the masterworks of the Western literary tradition, focusing on the Catholic perspective of man’s struggle throughout history to exercise his free will as he encounters both the reality of evil and the force of God’s love and mercy. Special emphasis on Irish writers will reveal the powerful, universal Truth of the redeeming nature of suffering especially when leavened by the Faith. The authors studied include James Joyce, William Butler Yeats, Walter Macken, Liam O’Flaherty, John Synge, Sean O’Casey, Oscar Wilde, Leo Tolstoy, Graham Greene, Gertrud von Le Fort, and Alexander Solzenitsyn.\n\nThe Art of Communication in the New Evangelization: Living the Medium. Loving the Message.\n\nWith Dr. Seàn-Patrick Lovett\n\nProgram Director at Vatican Radio\n\nA series of three experiential communication workshops aimed at re-energizing the evangelizer in you by focusing on your talents and skills as a communicator—and applying them to ensure the Word is both heard and understood.\n\nSt. Columcille (also known as St. Columba) was born in County Donegal in 521 and died on the Island of Iona in 597. One of the intellectual giants of his age, he was raised and educated by a priest close to his family. After being trained in the school of Christian asceticism and monasticism, Columcille founded a number of monasteries, including the famous Monastery of Derry in 548. In 563, he left Ireland with twelve companions and sailed for the Island of Iona, where he erected a monastery and began his great mission to Scotland. Iona became a thriving center of the monastic culture that dominated the northwest for centuries. Columcille, a voluntary exile for Christ, returned to Ireland only once in 575 to attend the convention of Ulster of Drumceatt, where his intervention saved the bards and poets of Ireland from banishment. A man of deep faith, great culture, and charity, his life has been recorded for us in the Vita San Columba, written by St. Adomnan. St. Columcille was one of the great lights of the early Middle Ages and one of the great missionary evangelists in the history of the Catholic Church. We are proud to claim him as our special patron."
