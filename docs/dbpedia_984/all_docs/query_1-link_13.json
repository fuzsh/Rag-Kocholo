        "text": "In the mid 1990s Irish film-maker, Breandán Féiritear arranged with Thomas Moriarty, History Professor at the Elms College, to interview Blasket Island émigrés and their children who had settled in the Springfield, Massachusetts and Enfield, Connecticut areas. In March 1997, the film-maker showed the resulting documentary in Veritas Auditorium at the Elms College for its American premiere. In spite of the fact that a winter storm of sleet and freezing rain raged outside, a large crowd, including many of those featured in the film, gathered for the viewing.\n\nSubsequently, then-Elms President Kathleen Keating, SSJ, Thomas F. Moriarty, also now retired, and Sean F. Cahillane, whose mother came to Western Massachusetts from the Great Blasket Island off Ireland’s West Coast, spearheaded a group of local Irish people to form a cultural center at the college dedicated to preserving and sharing the many aspects of Irish culture to Americans of all backgrounds. The college agreed to give the new organization the space that had originally been the library.\n\nSince then, the ICC has grown dramatically in both membership and events. How to account for our growth? We offer a good product. Even though, some may say, “Irish immigration has waned and generations of Irish-Americans continue to become assimilated into mainstream society,” I believe that most immigrants, even generations later, have a desire to tap into their roots. And perhaps the Irish is one group whose members believe strongly in their ancestry. Perhaps we continue to grow in part because of the variety of our programs. We have offered lectures, music events, films and exhibits, and several yearly events, including children’s events and holiday programming, and marching in the Holyoke St. Patrick’s Day Parade. The teaching of the Irish language makes us unique in the area, enabling us to continue to attract new students, as well as nurturing the continued interest of enthusiasts who first learned the language some 30 years ago.\n\nCertainly, travel to Ireland is attractive to people. Perhaps, another factor is our collaboration with the other local Irish organizations, inviting each to appoint a representative to serve on our Board.\n\nWhen the Center opened in 1999, many of the Dingle people came to celebrate with us, including Michael De Mordha, executive director of The Blasket Center in Dunquin, County Kerry. Each of the founders, listed above, and many of the original board members, have relatives in Ireland. A good number of the members also have family connections in Ireland.\n\nOne of our mission statements reads: to promote economic ties between western New England and western Ireland. Thus early in our history, we invited Dingle merchants to visit the Big E in West Springfield. They met with the officials of the local fair and yearly, several bring their wares to sell at the 17-day event each September.\n\nWe also continue to foster relationships on our journeys to Ireland, where we meet and make return visits to many of our new friends.\n\nWe have experienced remarkable growth since our beginnings, but we face challenges – the challenge of reaching the next generation, as well as the challenge of attracting new members. Another challenge is reaching out to more counties in Ireland. The Springfield Metropolitan area, consisting of Springfield, Holyoke, and Chicopee, is home to many immigrants, many of whom claim their place of origin on the west coast of Ireland, especially County Kerry.\n\nOur strength rests with an active, committed board, and as long as we have such willing volunteers to organize events, we will survive and even continue to grow.\n\nActivites\n\nThe Irish Cultural Center hosts annual events and programs for the community. These include:\n\nSt. Patrick’s Celebrations\n\nTo honor the patron saint of Ireland, we have initiated several events over the years. These include exhibiting collections of artifacts and artwork, a sing-a-long of Irish songs, and Irish tea parties. The Irish Cultural Center has participated in the Holyoke St. Patrick’s Parade since 2001. Floats have been built by members and volunteers, and have included an authentic Irish jaunting car and floats honoring the culture and history of Ireland. ICC members, friends and Elms students have marched with us.\n\nBig E Dingle Pavilion and Dingle Reception\n\nThe ICC maintains ties with merchants in Ireland, especially on the Dingle Peninsula. In September 2000, the Center invited a group of merchants to visit the Big E in West Springfield, Massachusetts. Since 2001, the Dingle merchants have brought their Irish wares for sale to the biggest fair on the east coast. During the seventeen days of the fair, several ICC members host some of the merchants in their homes, and provide transportation to and from the fairgrounds. The Center has an exhibit along with the Dingle merchants in the Young Building at the Big E, where we have information on our programs and events. We look forward to seeing you at the fair each September!\n\nChristmas Caroling Dinners\n\nThe ICC currently hosts the Tavern Carolers during the Christmas season, offering guests several opportunities to enjoy the music of the season and a delicious dinner at our Irish House Restaurant and Trinity Pub.\n\nHoliday Events for Children\n\nIrish Halloween (Samhain) crafts and stories, a St. Brigid Cross workshop, and visits with Santa are just a few of our Irish holiday events, enjoyed by children and adults alike.\n\nIrish Language\n\nMany students of Irish Language in the Springfield, Massachusetts’s area first began their studies with evening classes taught by Dr. Thomas Moriarty and Mr. George Bresnahan, through the Irish Cultural Center at Elms College. (Prior to that, Irish was taught by Mr. Ken Nilsen, to a group of students at Elms College evening classes, Tom and George among them!)\n\nAs a result of these classes, the Center enjoys a growing number of Irish Language enthusiasts who strive to promote interest in the language. Elms College, in partnership with the ICC, hosts a yearly Irish Fulbright Foreign Language Teaching Assistant, who teaches classes in the Irish Studies program, as well as night classes for the public.\n\nBeginning in 2006, the Center has offered an Irish Language immersion day with teachers from Daltaí na Gaeilge and Árd dTeanga Féin offering classes on four levels. The program introduces participants to the sights, sounds, history and value of the Irish language. We have shown short films, offered workshops on the bodhran, tin whistle, and set dancing. Conversation groups moderated by the language teachers give everyone the confidence to converse in the language, whatever level they are at. The program concludes with a music session each year.\n\nMusic Events and Concerts\n\nIntegral to understanding the Irish soul is the appreciation of Irish music. We have had many events headlining Irish or Irish American musicians over the years. These include local musicians playing in our Irish House Restaurant and Trinity Pub, and the talented musicians who take part in our weekly Irish seisiún. The ICC has hosted internationally-known touring bands and singers, from the US and Ireland.\n\nLúnasa Feis\n\nThe ICC presents our annual Lúnasa Feis each summer at the Eastern States Exposition. This is a day-long traditional Irish dance competition, with over 500 students from throughout New England and beyond taking part.\n\nTravel to Ireland\n\nTravel to Ireland has become a yearly offering for the Irish Cultural Center. For many years, one of the dreams of Tim Allen, long-time President of the Irish Cultural Center, was to take a group to Ireland. In July of 2004 that dream became a reality when twenty pilgrims took the first Journey of the Soul. Beyond a trip and better than a tour, it was an opportunity to let the spirit of Ireland enter into the soul with several nights’ stay in most locations, a chance to leave the tour to explore on one’s own, or pursue genealogy research, to make friends with the Irish wherever we met them.\n\nBus trips to various venues prove increasingly popular. We have offered bus trips to the Fine Arts Center, UMass, Amherst for musical performances: Cherish the Ladies and the Chieftains. We traveled to Quinnipiac University in Connecticut to view the famine exhibit.\n\nBook and Poetry Reading, Story Telling\n\nIreland is called the “land of saints and scholars.” Thus, over the years we have invited writers and storytellers to enchant our audience with their poems, tales, and stories. The Center has featured the following writers to introduce their books and do a reading:\n\nCole Moreton, Hungry for Home\n\nMichael White, Garden of Martyrs\n\nKevin O’Hara, Last of the Donkey Pilgrims\n\nNuala Ní Dhomhnaill, renowned Irish poet and author did a reading of her work\n\nPeggy O’Brien, the Director of Irish Studies at the University of Massachusetts at Amherst, selected the poems and wrote a preface for the book, The Wake Forest Book of Irish Women’s Poetry 1967-2000, from which she did some readings and gave a commentary\n\nWalter Stock spent an evening in Irish Storytelling\n\nNuala Hayes entertained with Ancient Tales Retold\n\nVincent Dowling from the Miniature Theatre in Chester in a drama presentation, I Am of Ireland, based on the writings of William Butler Yeats\n\nJ.M. Synge: The Aran Islands with Tegolin and Sean Coyne in a dramatic recital\n\nLectures\n\nSince its founding, the Center has sponsored speakers:\n\nDr. Margaret MacCurtain, noteworthy Irish historian, on the Role of the Irish Abroad in helping to preserve Irish Culture\n\nKevin O’Hara, local author told stories of growing up in an Irish American household\n\nJames Flynn, Holy Cross College history professor, on Poland and Ireland: Keys to Understanding the Development of the Modern West\n\nMaria Luddy, Boston College visiting scholar on the Magdalene Asylums\n\nRosie O’Grady, Elms College visiting professor of Social Studies from the University of Ulster, spoke Of Goddesses, Ancient Cures and Those Little People\n\nMayo native, Kathleen Murphy and a committee organized a celebration of the Mullet of Mayo with talks, reflections and accounts of their homesteads in County Mayo\n\nMassachusetts Congressman Richard Neal has spoken on several occasions about the progress of the peace process in Ireland\n\nPeggy O’Brien, English professor, University of Massachusetts, Amherst, spoke of her book Writing Lough Derg\n\nJournalist and author, Ed Moloney addressed the topic, Where now for the peace process\n\nElms College professors: Robert King, Thomas Moriarty, Laura McNeil, Damien Murray, Tom Cerasulo\n\nArt Exhibits\n\nSince the center’s inception, several Irish artists have exhibited their work in the Borgia Gallery, Dooley Campus Center on the Elms College campus.\n\nIreland native, Mary McSweeney, who now lives on Cape Cod, exhibited her work. The artist was born in Killarney, Ireland and is a graduate of the Cork School of Art. She also studied in London before returning to Tralee in 1979 to begin her professional career as an artist. Her focus is on the Irish people at work and play, evoking a kind of “Norman Rockwell” nostalgia.\n\nMazzarella O’Flaherty, from County Kerry in Ireland, exhibited her work. The Dingle born artist lives on the Peninsula and operates both the Mazzland Art Studio and the Dingle Record Shop, blending her two loves of art and music. Using oils and acrylic, she reflects feelings and emotions through ever-changing colours and light, focusing on the windswept seas and mountains of the Peninsula.\n\nOlwen O’Herlihy Dowling presented an exhibit, Shifting Clouds with paintings of the Connemara and Kerry landscapes. Born in Dublin, she grew up in Malibu, California, but has lived both in Ireland and the United States since the age of nine; she is married to Vincent Dowling, director and Artistic Director of the Miniature Theatre of Chester. Using oils and watercolor, she captures the stark beauty of Connemara and the richness of the green of Kerry – both with clouds above defining the view.\n\nKathleen Walsh Buchanan presents the Great Blasket Island print series – a form of traditional printmaking called a “collagraph” in a show called Island Home: A Printmaker’s Perspective on great Blasket Island.\n\nCarol Shea had a photography exhibit Ireland …Faces and Places-A Photographic Journal. Her framed pictures portray people in everyday activities, as well as nature scenes, unique, familiar and famous.\n\nR. Todd Felton exhibited photos from his collection based on his book A Journey into Ireland’s Literary Revival\n\nTo celebrate our 10th Anniversary Vincent Crotty exhibited Images of the Blasket Island, Ireland and Beyond."
