        "text": "It is always nice to discover a Prendergast family member when researching a particular period in History.\n\nThis year after an unfortunate bout of Covid developing into long covid and eventually 15 days stay in hospital, I am grateful to be recovering well and have continued with my BA at UTAS majoring in History.\n\nI have cut back on my workload due to ill health and instead of picking and choosing third year units as I previously did, have gone back to catching up on first year units instead. I am currently studying HTA 101: European History: Renaissance to revolution. This unit gives a broad study of various global events.\n\nBeing the curious person that I am, I love nothing better than bringing history metaphorically to life. So, the minute we are assigned a topic during a particular era, I google our Prendergast name and see who pops up. This has revealed some surprising results involving our Prendergast family.\n\nWhilst studying the English revolution, it was revealed that on 30 January 1649 Charles 1 was executed. He was beheaded and condemned as a traitor for crimes against the people. Now you might wonder how Charles 1 has a connection with our Prendergast family. Well, let me elaborate.\n\nIn 1066 William, duke of Normandy invaded and conquered England. One of the knights who accompanied William in the battle was Robert de Quincy who was the grandfather of Maud de Quincy. You may recall that Maud married Philip de Prendergast builder of Enniscorthy castle in Ireland. Philip was also son of Maurice de Prendergast, one of the knights to accompany Strongbow on his invasion of Ireland. I have also discovered a Preudirlegast (sounds like one of the 30 variant spelling of the Prendergast family) who accompanied King William to England in the Norman invasion but have yet to verify his involvement. The Epic adventure of King William is depicted in the Bayeux Tapestry – Visit of the Bayeux Tapestry – Bayeux Museum\n\nMoving forward, the next Prendergast hero was Thomas Prendergast, Viscount Gort who was awarded land and a title by King William 111, grandson of Charles 1. William was son of Mary, the daughter of Charles 1. The land and title were presented in recognition of Thomas’s involvement in the prevention of the murder of King William 111 by the Jacobite’s. At the time the O’Shaugnessy’s owned the land. They were not happy to have their land confiscated and given to Thomas and fought back. Thomas Prendergast built Lough Cutra Castle on the land which is situated near Galway and later paid the O’Shaugnessy’s for their land. Lough Cutra Castle | History of the Estate | Castle Rental for Corporate Events, Location Shoots and Weddings\n\nNow my third Prendergast hero. Back in 2015 on my way to Ireland to study at UCC, I made a detour to Bowood House where the ‘Antiques Roadshow’ was being filmed. I was staying in London at the time. Little did I know that Bowood House held an important primary document called “Pender’s census” A copy is held at the Irish Manuscripts Commission. A Census of Ireland circa 1659 – Irish Manuscripts This census was commissioned by Cromwell as part of the Downs Survey of Ireland 1656-58. You might remember that Cromwell enlisted in the Parliamentary New army and fought against the Royalists. He was also one of the 59 Regicides who signed the death warrant of King Charles 1. In 1653 Cromwell was made Lord Protector.\n\nOver the past 8 years, during my quest to find Prendergast ancestry, a number of people have asked me “Was John Prendergast a rebel or a convicted falon?”\n\nSlowly, with the changes to the privacy laws in Ireland and the launch of the Catholic parish records 8 July 2015 https://vimeo.com/138285559 that information is being released on line. I was delighted to be an invited guest at the launch of the Catholic Parish records and excited to be introduced to Enda Kenny on this momentous occasion. The information from these church records forms the basis of my research into the Irish Prendergast family.\n\nJohn Prendergast was baptised in Dublin at the St. Nicholas of Myra church. This catholic church is located in the same street that John and his family lived, Francis Street, Dublin. Although it is not publicly available on line, I do have documentation to confirm that the Prendergast family lived in Francis Street for many years.\n\nFollowing several emails between Ruan O’Donnell and myself, I have been able to construct a plausible explanation of John Prendergast’s status.\n\nIn his email to me in February, Doctor Ruan O’Donnell, head of the history department at the University of Limerick advised me that Wicklow rebels and their families often hid out at Francis Street “when things were very hot” and that Francis Street is where the ‘Sun Inn’ was the meeting place for the Leinster directorate of the United Irishment. It would appear that John Prendergast was an Irish rebel and involved with several members of the Society of United Irishmen.\n\n* Dr. O’Donnell has conducted research and studies both here in Australia and in Ireland and is a well known expert on the 1798 Rebellion. He has published several books. The title of the book I read is “The Rebellion in Wicklow, 1798. If you are a member and would like to read it, the book is available from the State Library of NSW. The CALL NUMBERS is N941.807/1\n\nBond, Oliver Cromwell | Dictionary of Irish Biography (dib.ie)\n\nOliver bond was a leader in the Leinster Directorate. Both Oliver Bond’s home and John Prendergast’s homes were situated in the Liberty district of Dublin, Oliver Bond’s home was at 9 Lower Bridge Street which was 1 minute’s walk from John Prendergast’s Francis Street home. Oliver Bond was a wool merchant and John Prendergast a weaver.\n\nCopy of Perkin Papers document\n\n(given to me by my mum, fellow researcher Lorna Prendergast)\n\nAlthough this document is dated 20 May 1798, we know that the 1798 rebellion did not commence until 23 May, 1798. This document details the interrogation of John Pender (Prendergast) and confirms the family story that John Prendergast was a rebel. Following the arrests on 12 March 1798, 14 members of the Leinster directorate whose leader was Oliver Bond were imprisoned, the other members who got away were being watched. John Prendergast was arrested in April for a petty crime, tried and transported to Australia.\n\nJohn Prendergast was transported to Australia on board the Minerva. There is a great account of that journey and biographies of most of the rebels in Barbara Hall’s book “The Rebel Ship Minerva – From Ireland to Sydney, 1800.\n\nFrom when he arrived in Australia 11 January 1800 until his death 27 January 1833, records show the majority of John Prendergast’s business and social dealings were with fellow passengers/rebels who were transported to Australia with him on board the Minerva.\n\nHawkesbury\n\nJohn was born to Catherine and John Prendergast in the Hawkesbury sometime after 25 September 1800. There are no children recorded prior to this date in the Historical records of New South Wales in the relevant section of the report\n\nAs a child growing up in the Hawkesbury, John would have been called a “Currency lad”. This referred to the first generation of children born in the colony of NSW to distinguish them from the free settlers who were born in the British Isles\n\nHe would also have been given the nickname of “Cornstalk”. This was a term to describe how the first generation of Australian born children in the colony of NSW were so much taller than children born in Britain.\n\nWhen Catherine decided to return to Ireland she chose to employ a convict as housekeeper for her husband John and Governess for her baby son John. As a free settler, Catherine was entitled to do this. Catherine employed Jane Williams upon Jane’s arrival aboard the Nile on 14 December 1801 This was quiet a reversal to the usual custom of an Protestant English Lady having a catholic Irish convict assigned to her because Catherine was Irish Catholic and Jane was English Protestant . By December 1801 Baby John would have been 1 year old and Catherine would have weaned him. Having Jane assigned to her and baby John was a shrewd move as John Prendergast Senior would not have been entitled to employ Jane Williams while he and Jane were both still convicts.\n\nJane took great care of John Jnr. Later, when Catherine did not return to Australia, Jane and John Senior began a relationship and had a further 5 children together. Jane always treated John Jnr. as one of her own. There has never been a marriage record of their marriage discovered.\n\nJohn junior grew up to be a healthy, happy child supported by the love of his family. As a teenager he had one minor scrap with the law. John appeared in front of the courts when his love of partying got him into strife. He had put some food and alcohol items on his father’s tab without John Snr’s. permission . John Prendergast senior was not impressed!\n\nJohn Pendergast junior was recorded on various census records as BC (born Colony) and was one of the first Australian born child of an free settler and convict to be called up for Jury Duty.\n\nJohn was very industrious, just like his father and applied for grants and purchased many parcels of land which are indicated in his Will\n\nFigure 1. Photo of Map of land purchase with reference to other land in John’s Will.\n\nCampbelltown.\n\nHe moved to Campbelltown and married Elizabeth Dwyer on 1/6/1824 at St. John’s Catholic church Campbelltown. Together they had 9 Children. At the time of their marriage it was rumoured that John owned one half and Elizabeth owned the other half of all land in the Campbelltown area. John Pendergast’s Will certainly indicates a large number of land parcels purchased by John Jnr. in the Campbelltown area.\n\nIn his lifetime John Pendergast Junior was very Community spirited. Like his father before him and his half-brothers, he insured that the Catholic faith continued to grow in Australia by contributing financially to the construction of churches and burial grounds. Along with Hugh Byrne, John Jnr. secured a grant on 31 March 1846 for the Catholic cemetery at Campbelltown. Little did he know that his wife and son would be buried there the next year following a terrible accident where they both perished by fire. The biblical quote on the side of the grave indicates the great depth of sorrow that John felt at Elizabeth and Thomas’s deaths.\n\nFigure 2. Photo “Elizabeth Wife of John Pendergast” grave.\n\nIn the ‘History of Bow Bowing’ we learn that that John Pendergast was an advocate of education.\n\n“John donated a block of land on the corner of Campbelltown Road and Redfern Road to the Catholic Church. In June 1866 a small church classroom – built by local farmers – was opened at the site and called Saggart Field School….moves to improve this (impoverished state) were made by converting the church school into a public one. In 1954 the Minto Public school was relocated to the more populated eastern side of the railway line in Campbelltown. The students and teachers are very proud of their School’s rich heritage and maintain a little museum”\n\nFigure 3. Photo of Minto Public School\n\nWhen John Pendergast left Campbelltown, he auctioned his Herd of 100 horses at an auction as advertised in the South Australian Newspaper, July 1848,\n\nFigure 4. Photo of Auction advertisement.\n\nJohn moved to the Monaro and 7 years after the death of his wife Elizabeth married Emma Shields on 14 August, 1854. Together they had 6 Children.\n\nBy this stage his 3 oldest boys with Elizabeth had grown up, and he encouraged them to continue the Prendergast settlement along the East Coast of Australia and the purchase of land in the Victorian High Plains.\n\nFigure 5. Photo of the Plaque explaining the 3 Pendergast sons involvement in the development of the Victorian High Country.\n\nCottage Creek Station.\n\nJohn lived with Emma at Cottage Creek Station until his death aged 66 on 8 June 1867. Prior to his death, he had continued to purchase land in the Monaro area. John died a wealthy farmer and bequeathed land to his children and money for the education of his younger children.\n\nJohn Jnr. Bequeathed the house, furniture and farm equipment to Emma as well as an annual annuity of 100 pounds for the rest of her life.\n\nFigure 6. Photo of Cottage Creek graves\n\nIn his Will, John bequeathed several parcels of land to his children in the Monaro district and Campbelltown as well as a house that he bequeathed to his niece Winifred Mary Byrne an allotment of land with a house and other buildings thereon at Lithgow Street Campbelltown. He also instructed that land at Currajong and Windsor be auctioned and the money diposited into a Bank of NSW account for his younger children.\n\nHistorical Records of New South Wales, 25 Sept. 1800, p.160.\n\nPublic Records Office (PRO) UK.

By understanding our past you’ll also learn to create a better future. Reference; Utas history unit handbook.\n\nAs they say, you cannot change history so with this in mind I have decided to blog about an episode in our family history that is less than commendable. Some people may find this episode distasteful but, I believe that it is important to tell this story as it may relate to John Prendergast’s arrest and transportation to Australia.\n\nWhen I commenced my Bachelor of Arts, History major at the university of Tasmania this year, I enrolled in unit HTA 102. Little did I know that one of the subjects would impact my Prendergast family history research.\n\nWe were studying Slavery when randomly I googled the words “Prendergast and slavery”. I had not expected to find anything and was quite shocked when I came across a study that was taking place at the University College London and read the contents. The study was called the ‘Center for the study of the legacies of British slavery’. The link is www.ucl.ac.uk. if you would like to read it for yourself.\n\nI was horrified to discover that there are 11 Irish Prendergast family members who were slave owners in the 17th and 18th century in Jamaica. Amongst the 11 there were 2 female slave owners. I have since found documentation in Dublin related to one of the slave owners Hannah Prendergast and the addresses on her census are in both Dublin and Jamaica. As there were only three Prendergast families living in Dublin during the late 1700s, and they were all related, there is every chance that she along with several other Irish slave owners, is related to our Prendergast family.\n\nAnd now for a quick history lesson.\n\nFollowing the British invasion of Jamaica in 1655, Cromwell increased the island’s European population by sending indentured servants and prisoners to Jamaica. Due to the wars in Ireland at this time 2/3 of this 17th century European population was Irish.\n\nThe invading army of 1655 had within a generation become the nucleus of a prospering band of planters. All sorts of tropical produce emerged from these plantations, but the single most important crop – the biggest volume of exports, the most lucrative product and the crop which devoured the labors of ever increasing gangs of slaves – was sugar.\n\nOver the next 200 years, 900 plantations sprang up over Jamaica. The rapid introduction of plantations in Jamaica meant that to cover transportation costs between Jamaica and Britain, large scale cropping of Tobacco, Coffee, Cotton, Indigo, Rice, Potatoes, and Sugar ensued. Until the 1st of August 1838 when slaves were fully emancipated, these plantations were worked by African slave labor. During this time more than 800,000 slaves were imported from Africa to Jamaica.\n\nThis next piece of information may upset you, as it did me. I could not understand how some people could treat other people, namely the slaves, so inhumanely.\n\nThe British laws defined slaves as chattel, to be sold, bequeathed, and transferred like other goods. These laws were accompanied or inevitably modified by laws that unequivocally treated them as persons even while restricting their activities, bringing them to trial, and punishing them. However slaves and slavery were defined, slaves in fact were not outside the social order.\n\nI would like to think that our Pendergast slave owners were kinder to their slaves and there is evidence supporting this theory. On ancestry.com I located an inventory of slaves owned by Hannah Prendergast. Whereas some slave owners used derogatory names for their slaves, Hannah has conformed to the Irish naming pattern giving her slaves Christian names as well as the Prendergast surname. There are records indicating that she had her slaves baptized into the catholic faith.\n\nI have also located the will of Jeffery Prendergast gent of St. Thomas in the East, Jamaica. He bequeaths property to his Quadroon daughter Elenor, his negro woman slave, and a “Free mulatto” woman.\n\nAccording to Wikipedia, the meaning of the word quadroon is – “1/4 black by descent”. The meaning of “Free mulatto” is a racial classification to refer to people of mixed African and European ancestry. I hasten to add that both these terms are considered outdated and offensive.\n\nAlthough this is a disturbing discovery, there is a silver lining to this story. I located a newspaper item in the Irish times “The Irish Lord who freed Jamaican slaves” It reads –\n\nOn his appointment as Governor General of Jamaica in 1834, Lord Sligo made the discovery that he had inherited 2 Jamaican plantations from his grandmother, Elizabeth Kelly, heiress of the Chief Justice of Jamaica, Dennis Kelly from Galway. These plantations used African slaves to provide labor for the plantation. Although the planters expected Sligo to be on their side because he was now a slave owner, he did not hide his disgust at the discovery.\n\nIn 1833 the British government had passed an emancipation act. The act however did not give immediate freedom to the slaves who merely became apprentice to their masters for a further four years. Described as “slavery under another name”, the controversial apprenticeship system which Sligo was appointed to implement, was misunderstood by the slaves and resisted by the Jamaican plantocracy and by powerful vested commercial interests in Britain.\n\nLord Sligo found the slavery personally abhorrent. From the flogging of field workers with cart whips branding with hot irons, to whipping of female slaves, “The cruelties are past all idea” he told the Jamaican assembly. “I call on you to put an end to conduct so repugnant to humanity”\n\nHis campaign to have slaves freed ruffled feathers in government and the planter dominated assembly commenced a campaign of vilification against him in the Jamaican and British press. During this time he built schools at his own cost on his property. He was the first plantation owner to initiate a wage system for black workers and later, after emancipation, to divide his lands into numerous farms to be leased to the former slaves.\n\nOn March 22nd, 1838 Sligo publicly announced in the House of Lords that, regardless of the outcome of the government deliberation, he would free all apprentices on his own estate in Jamaica on August 1st 1838, thereby leaving the government with no alternative but to implement full emancipation on the same date.\n\nSligo earned an honored place in the history of Jamaica where he is acknowledged as champion of the slaves and where the town of Sligo Ville, the first free slave village in the world, still bears his name.\n\nI feel very proud of Lord Sligo and the campaign he undertook to free slaves. Although Lord Sligo is not directly a Prendergast, his wife’s auntie was a Prendergast.\n\nWhen I visited Lord Sligo’s ancestral home, ‘Westport house’ In 2015, Ireland, at that time I did not know of the Prendergast connection. But, in a house full of beautiful antiquaries the one particular item that stood out to me, was the fire guard made of tapestry. The words that were embroidered on this tapestry read “PROREGESAPE PRO PATRIA SEMPER” translated from Latin into English this means “For the king sometimes but for the country always.”\n\nAs mentioned in my introduction, I believe that because John Prendergast was related to the Irish slave owners in Jamaica, he may well have been involved in their export/import business of Sugar and Tobacco to Ireland. Large quantities of Sugar and Tobacco were two of the three items that John Prendergast was accused of stealing at his trial. There was always a question about these items because the person who accused him of the theft happened to be the jury foreman at John’s trial.\n\nHaving completed the Utas Diploma of Family History in 2020 and enjoyed it so much, I decided in 2021 to continue with my University studies.\n\nThrough the excellent online company “Future Learn” I completed the University College Dublin Irish language course “Irish 101”. Then I studied the “Book of Kells” course through Trinity College Dublin. I had been lucky to visit the Book of Kells in the Long Hall Trinity College Dublin in 2015. Both courses were very enjoyable, even if I did have to participate by zoom conferencing at 2 in the morning on several occasions due to the difference in time change with Ireland.\n\nMid 2021, I re-enrolled at Utas to study for my Bachelor of Arts, History major, Tourism minor. I commenced units HTA102 and HGA318 in Semester 2. I was awarded 8 units of Advanced standing for completing the Diploma of Family History. This cut down the units required to complete my BA to 16 units instead of 24.\n\nI received an invitation to attend my graduation in Hobart following the completion of my Diploma of Family history. Although I would have loved to have been able to attend in person and celebrate with my family and friends, due to Covid I graduated in absentia on 14 August, 2021.\n\n14 August, 2021 was a very exciting day for me. I had arisen early because I had an assignment to submit for HTA102 and wanted to finish that before I watched the Diploma of Family History graduation ceremony on Utube.\n\nBarry had made the day special for me by creating a cheese platter with bubbly to enjoy while we watched the graduation being live streamed. Although I felt a little sad that I couldn’t be there, I was able to relax and watch the ceremony unfolding in front of me. We stood when the procession commenced and the Vice Chancellor and dignitaries took their seats on stage. We clapped each graduate and laughed at the jokes Hannah Gatsby who was awarded an honorary doctorate made.\n\nBy the end of the year we had a further celebration. I had been invited by Utas to apply for a RRES Scholarship. I am delighted to share with you the exciting news that due to my ongoing research and study in Ireland and Australia regarding my Prendergast family history, I have been awarded a Scholarship as well as an internship to participate at any Museum, Gallery, Library or Archive in Australia."
