Interviewed October 2011.\n\nTheobald Wolfe Tone (b. 1763-d. 1798) – Theobald Wolfe Tone is considered the “Father” of Irish Republicanism. In separate annual events, Irish Republicans across an array of organizations meet at his tomb at Bodenstown, County Kildare, and commemorate the birth of Wolfe Tone (June 20, 1763). Tone was born into a middle class Protestant family in Dublin and “was called to the bar” in the summer of 1789. In 1791, he joined the “Society of United Irishmen,” an organization inspired by 18th Century republican political philosophy (“the Rights of Men”) that tried to unite “Catholic, Protestant and Dissenter” and establish an Irish Republic. Tone was captured on Lough Swilly aboard the French ship the Hoche. Wearing the uniform of a chef de brigade (colonel), he was tried in Dublin and found guilty of treason. He asked to be shot as a soldier, but was instead sentenced to be hanged as a traitor. Theobald Wolfe Tone died in custody several days after an attempted suicide. Several sources provide information on the life of Wolfe Tone, including: Marianne Elliott, Wolfe Tone: Prophet of Irish Independence (New Haven, CT: Yale University Press, 1989); and, Thomas Bartlett (editor), Life of Theobald Wolfe Tone: Memoirs, journals and political writings, compiled and arranged by William T.W. Tone, 1826 (Dublin: Lilliput Press, 1998).\n\nPatrick/Pádraig Pearse (1879-1916) – Pádraig Pearse was an Irish-speaking poet, educator, and key organizer of the 1916 “Easter” Rising; Pearse was President of the Provisional Government and Commander-in-Chief of the Army of the Republic.

After 1916 de Valera became President of Sinn Féin and President of the rebel parliament, Dáil Éireann. De Valera was the senior political leader of those opposed to the Anglo-Irish Treaty (1921). When Dáil Éireann ratified the Treaty (by a vote of 64-57), de Valera resigned as President of the Irish Republic. He actively opposed the Treaty during the Irish Civil War (1922-23), and after the Civil War he refused to recognize the authority of the Dublin (for the Irish Free State) and Belfast (for Northern Ireland) parliaments. At the 1926 Sinn Féin Árd Fheis (Annual Convention), however, de Valera changed his view and supported Sinn Féin’s participation in Leinster House/Dáil Éireann. The delegates rejected the proposed change. De Valera resigned as President of Sinn Féin and with several supporters formed the political party Fianna Fáil (Soldiers of Destiny). http://www.fiannafail.ie/ In 1927, de Valera led Fianna Fáil into Leinster House/Dáil Éireann; de Valera and Fianna Fáil dominated Irish politics for the rest of the century.

Tom Maguire was arrested by Irish Free State forces and might have been executed but for his status as an elected representative. In 1923, his brother Seán Maguire, aged 17 and an IRA volunteer, was executed by the Irish Free State. In 1969/70 Tom Maguire supported the Provisional IRA and “Provisional” Sinn Féin.

In March 1976 the British authorities began enforcing their criminalisation policy, after which paramilitary prisoners were treated as criminals. Sands was released in April 1976 but re-arrested in October 1976 after an IRA attack on a furniture factory. When he was again convicted of possessing a weapon he refused to accept criminal status. Sands joined other prisoners on the “blanket protest”, in which they refused to wear a prison uniform; they were naked, wrapping themselves in only a blanket. As the struggle for political status escalated, Sands became commanding officer (O/C) of the IRA prisoners in the “H-Blocks” of Long Kesh (called the “Maze” by the authorities).

During Sands’ hunger strike he was elected as MP in the Fermanagh/South Tyrone constituency. He succumbed on May 5, 1981, after 66 days without food. Sands’ hunger strike, election to Westminster, and death, generated enormous interest in the Irish Republican cause and set the stage for Sinn Féin’s political transformation.
