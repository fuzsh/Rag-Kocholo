        "text": "AGE, FAMILY AND PARLIAMENTARY EXPERIENCE\n\nBetween the dissolutions of 1790 and 1820 the number of Members elected to the House was 2,143. This excludes the Hon. John Knox, returned to the first Imperial Parliament for the Irish borough of Dungannon, who was lost at sea before the date of his return. Of the 2,143 some 492 were first elected to the House before the general election of 1790: seven were first elected before the general election of 1754, Welbore Ellis as early as 1741.\n\nAGE OF THE MEMBERS RETURNED AT EACH GENERAL ELECTION\n\n1790\n\n1796\n\n1802\n\n1806\n\n1807\n\n1812\n\n1818 Under 3086978710211910210730-391511401681561416016040-491381361851771817314950-599510013012912613114760-695857615847566670-7912151715141417Over 801101243Age not known6134373Returned for more than one constituency111171614116Average age43-1843-2344-2643-7642-9344-0944-39\n\n(Members chosen for more than one constituency have been counted once only.) Allowing for the fact that membership of the House increased from 558 to 658 in 1801, with the advent of the Irish contingent, these figures reveal no startling changes in age composition. Members aged 40 to 60 exceeded those aged under 40 after 1801.\n\nNone of the Members sitting in this period lived to be a centenarian, though there were several nonagenarians. Sir George Jackson was 97 when he died. There were at least 29, possibly 30, new Members who had not attained their legal majority (21 years) when elected to the House in this period—omitting the 15 or 16 Members who were minors when first elected before 1790 and were still in the House. Only one of the new minors, Sir Thomas Mostyn elected for Flintshire in 1796, was unseated on account of his minority, though the same fate might have befallen the others according to 7 and 8 William III, c.25. Viscount Jocelyn, returned in 1806, was barely 18 years old; but most of the rest were within months or days of their majority. None apparently attempted to vote or speak in the House until they had attained it, except Viscount Milton, who was still under age when he spoke against the slave trade, 23 Feb. 1807. Three minors were elected in 1790, three in 1796, three in 1802, three in 1806, five in 1807 (one of these was first returned in 1806), three in 1812 and one in 1818; another 11 were returned at by-elections. Only four in all were county Members: one Irish, one Scots and two Welsh, one of the latter being unseated. Most were returned for their fathers’ pocket boroughs.\n\nOver half of the Members in this period sat during ten years or more: 358 from ten to 15 years; 281 from 15 to 20 years; 211 from 20 to 25 years; 148 from 25 to 30 years; 119 from 30 to 35 years and 72 from 35 to 40 years. Another 72 sat for 40 years or more—not necessarily continuously. Twenty of these served 50 years or more. Sixteen of them were—rightly or wrongly, for the term was not strictly defined—styled Father of the House: Sir John Aubrey, John Blackburne, Sir Henry Bridgeman, Sir Charles Merrick Burrell, George Byng, John Bullock, Thomas William Coke I, William Edwardes (1st Baron Kensington), Sir Christopher Hawkins, Whitshed Keene, the Hon. Henry Cecil Lowther, Richard Price, Philip Rashleigh, Clement Tudway, George Granville Venables Vernon and Charles Watkin Williams Wynn. Sir John Aubrey served for 58 years, sitting for seven different constituencies; Henry Temple, 2nd Viscount Palmerston, for 57 years, his father having served 40. George Byng was the longest serving county Member, representing Middlesex for nearly 57 years. Another 26 of the 72 longest serving Members sat for counties for all or most of their Commons careers; no more than 20 of them could plausibly be described as political careerists.\n\nIn this period, the average age of Members on first entering the House, including those who did so before 1790, was 33.3 years—compared with 32.6 years in the period 1754-90. Members entering the House between 1790 and 1820 averaged 37.3 years. The average age at entry for all county Members sitting in this period was 36.5 years, the English being the youngest of them, followed by the Welsh, the Scots and the Irish: but the range did not exceed four years. Allowing for the distortion caused by the transfer to Westminster of veterans of the Irish parliament in 1801 (average age 44 years), there was thus only a slight increase in the threshold age. All Members in this period were born in the 18th century, the earliest, Evan Vaughan, in or before 1709, the latest, Dudley Ryder, Viscount Sandon, on 19 May 1798. The first fatality was that of Peregrine Francis Bertie, who died 20 Aug. 1790, but some three dozen Members saw in the year 1870—the last to die, on 13 June 1889, was Edward Denny.\n\nThe average life expectation of Members in this period was approximately 67 years, very little below what it is for the average British male today, but a mark of upper class background then, despite a gradual increase in general life expectancy. Some 320 Members, about 15 per cent of the whole, are not known to have married, even though only 30 of these died in their twenties. In any case, over a third of all the Members sitting in this period were unmarried when first elected, including widowers and divorcees. Of these, 160 remained unmarried during their Membership. Twice-married Members numbered 338; another 26 were three times married; three were four times married. Twenty-three were divorced. Some 25 Members were illegitimate, most of them sons of grandees, and over twice as many had acknowledged illegitimate children: this is a superficial estimate. Sir John St. Aubyn had 15 children by the mistress he eventually married. About 300 (nearly one in seven) of the Members in this period left no issue that survived infancy, and another 25 outlived their offspring. Fifty Members, on the other hand, died before their fathers. Some 170 Members left no legitimate male issue. Among the philoprogenitive Members, 100 had 12 or more children, including one premier, Spencer Perceval. Six Members had 17 or more children, Robert Wigram I siring 23. Sir Edward Knatchbull, 8th Bt., had 20 children and his son and heir 15.\n\nWell over half the Members—1,272 in all—were the eldest surviving or only surviving sons of their fathers, over a third of them entering the House before coming into their inheritance. Over a tenth of the Members—some 235—had a son or sons in the House in this period, more often as successors than contemporaries and rarely as precursors. Over a quarter of these patriarchs had more than one son in the House, ranging from two to five, if sons by different marriages and illegitimate sons are included. The 1st Marquess of Hertford had five sons in the House, though only four simultaneously. Apart from the 320 Members whose fathers sat within the period, there were another 444 whose fathers (342 of them) had sat before 1790. So over a third of the Members were sons of Members past or present. About 100 more Members were the sons of Members of the defunct Irish parliament. There were in all 191 pairs of brothers or half-brothers in the House in the period, 32 trios, 11 quartets, one quintet and one sextet (the Pagets, but no more than three of them in any one Parliament). Ten Members had maternal grandfathers also sitting in this period; a few had paternal grandfathers. Some 284 Members had Members for maternal grandfathers (209 of them). Over 500 Members—nearly a quarter—married the daughters of Members, past or present, more than 200 of them doing so before they entered the House. In many of the latter instances the marriage was a passport to a seat; but over 200 of the bridegrooms were themselves the sons of Members past or present and most of these were merely marrying within their own circle, or, as often happened, within their own family. The same pattern is found among the Irish contingent. Twenty-one Members’ widows were unable to resist marrying other Members and several Members were the cause of other Members’ divorces. One Member (the Hon. John Cust) married four Members’ daughters in turn. Nearly a quarter of the Members were the sons of heiresses or coheiresses and 400 married heiresses or coheiresses: these two categories overlap.\n\nApart from the patrimonial and marital opportunities for Membership, other degrees of kinship played their role. Uncles without male issue sponsored the return of their nephews to the House; cousins were regarded as safe nominees for close boroughs, safer sometimes than a patron’s unreliable offspring. If the House at times resembled one big family, there were family quarrels. Fathers expelled recalcitrant sons from the House. In one instance the Tarletons at Liverpool—brothers competed for a seat; in another cousins did so—the Hills at Shrewsbury; in another the husbands of two sisters and coheiresses did so—West and Biddulph at Denbigh. Inheritance from cousins, sometimes remote ones, could play a significant role in attaining Membership. The many changes of name among Members in this period testify to it.\n\nPARLIAMENTARY EXPERIENCE\n\n1790\n\n1796 1802 1806 1807 1812 1818 New Members (i.e. returned for the first time)12412715013784119151Former Members, but not in the previous Parliament29262032493728New and former Members elected but unseated on petition64125546New and former Members returned on petition or vice Members returned for more than one constituency118791084Totals170165189183148168189(75)(59)(67)(41)(61)(62)(33)\n\nThe figures in brackets immediately below the totals indicate the number of these who did not sit in the next or any future Parliament. In by-elections between 1790 and 1796, 114 new and former Members (7 former) were returned; between 1796 and 1802, 123(8 former); between 1802 and 1806, 105 (5 former); between 1806 and 1807, 9 (2 former); between 1807 and 1812, 115 (15 former); between 1812 and 1818, 120 (11 former) and between 1818 and 1820, 36 (2 former). Of these by-elected Members the numbers of those not returned to any future Parliament were 33, 30, 21, 2, 23, 30 and 7 respectively. The figure for the election of 1802 includes 27 new Irish Members, though the Irish contingent that arrived at Westminster the year before were all novices there except Viscount Castlereagh, joined before the year was out by the Hon. William Wellesley Pole, who was one of 14 new Irish Members by-elected before the dissolution.\n\nThe turnover of Members was therefore low. In 1807, when the previous Parliament had lasted only one session, it was as low as 22.5 per cent, and entailed a record number of former Members re-entering the House after being excluded the year before. The highest turnover was in 1790 when it stood at 30.4 per cent, followed by 29.5 per cent in 1796, 28.7 per cent in 1802 and 1818, 27.8 per cent in 1806, and 25.5 per cent in 1812. Only 88 who were Members at the dissolution of 1820 never returned to the House. Some 679 Members sitting in this period were re-elected from 1820 onwards, 608 of them in 1820, 414 in 1826, 303 in 1830 and 258 in 1831. Some 212 Members sitting in this period were elected to the reformed House, 163 in 1832, 143 in 1835, 121 in 1837, 85 in 1841, 51 in 1847, 33 in 1852, 14 in 1857, 12 in 1859 and two in 1865 (Viscount Palmerston and the Hon. Henry Cecil Lowther, who died 6 Dec. 1867). It is notable that nearly two-thirds of the Members re-elected after 1820 sat for the same seats as before and many others did so for part of their remaining period of service.\n\nThe number of sitting Members who faced defeat at the poll was low: 197 in all (five at by-elections). Thirty-four of these were county Members. Seventeen regained their seats on petition. The victims numbered 27 in 1790, 14 in 1796, 29 in 1802, 28 in 1806, 35 in 1807, 24 in 1812 and 35 in. 1818.\n\nSOCIAL STANDING\n\nThe House retained its aristocratic flavour, which was reinforced by Pitt’s new peerage creations. On average each Parliament in this period returned nearly 170 peers’ or peeress’s sons and Irish peers, the figures rising perceptibly from 1807 onwards. Seventeen Members succeeded to British dukedoms (one of them to a Scottish earldom as well), five of them between 1790 and 1820 Two of them succeeded an uncle and a cousin, not their fathers. One heir to a dukedom died in his father’s lifetime. Eleven other Members succeeded to British marquessates, seven during this period; two were subsequently created dukes. Two heirs to marquessates died in their fathers’ lifetime. Sixty-two Members succeeded to British earldoms, 38 in this period; three succeeded cousins and two uncles. Eight of them attained a marquessate, one a dukedom, and one was made a baron while his father lived. Five heirs to earldoms died before their fathers. Seven Members (one heir to a cousin) succeeded to British viscountcies, five in this period. Four of these were created earls. One heir to a viscountcy died v.p. Twenty-six Members succeeded to British baronies, one succeeding a cousin (another succeeded a cousin to a Scottish barony before succeeding his father) and five their mothers (one succeeded both parents in turn to baronies). Sixteen succeeded within the period. One Member had the abeyance of a barony terminated in his favour. Eight heirs to baronies died before succeeding. Twelve were subsequently created earls, without benefit of viscountcy. Nine sons and heirs of British peers were summoned to the Lords in their fathers’ lifetime, six within the period. There were also heirs to a count of the Holy Roman Empire, to a Savoyard comte and to a Hungarian baron. Forty-three Irish Members and 17 others were heirs to Irish titles. Five succeeded to marquessates, and another died before he could do so; three of them were created British barons. Twenty-five succeeded to earldoms, 11 within the period, all but two their fathers’, and another four heirs to earldoms died v.p. Four were created British barons, six inherited such baronies, and one was so created before inheriting one. Nine succeeded to viscountcies, five of them their fathers’. One was created an Irish earl, three also succeeded to British baronies and one of the two heirs to viscountcies who died v.p. was first created a British baron. Fifteen succeeded to baronies, nine within the period, and seven their fathers’. Two were also younger sons of British peers. Three were created British barons, one an Irish viscount, and one succeeded also to a British barony. Fourteen Members in all were to become Irish representative peers after the Union. Five Members succeeded to Scottish dukedoms, one of whom succeeded simultaneously to a British earldom, and another succeeded his mother to a British barony. One Member succeeded to a Scottish marquessate, with a British barony. Ten succeeded to Scottish earldoms, only three, who did not succeed their fathers, sitting for Scottish constituencies. Two of these also succeeded to British baronies, and another four were created British barons. Two heirs to Scottish earldoms died before succeeding to them. One Member procured the restoration in his favour of a viscountcy held by Jacobite forbears. Two Members succeeded to a Scottish barony and one died before he could do so. Three Members in all became Scottish representative peers.\n\nThere were 129 younger sons of British peers in the House in the period. Twenty-five were sons of dukes (another three took precedence as brothers of dukes). Of these one succeeded his brother as duke, two were created earls and three were created barons. Eighteen were younger sons of marquesses. Of these one was created in turn viscount and earl, one succeeded his half-brother as marquess, another his brother as a baron, another his uncle as a baron; while one succeeded his mother as an Irish baron. There were 51 younger sons of earls. Of these eight succeeded their brothers as earls, one as a duke; one succeeded his nephew as earl, and the wife of another succeeded to a peerage. There were six younger sons of viscounts and 29 younger sons of barons. Of the latter six succeeded their brothers as barons, and one as an earl. One was created a baron and another created viscount and earl.\n\nOf 58 younger sons of Irish peers in the House, 36 sat chiefly for Irish constituencies. The fathers of four were dukes: one was created an Irish baron and the wife of another was created a peeress. Five were the sons of marquesses—one succeeded his brother to the title and was created a British earl; another succeeded his mother as a British baron. Twenty-two were the sons of earls. Of these, five succeeded their brothers as earls, one became a marquess and, like three others, a British baron: of the latter, one, Arthur Wellesley, rose to a dukedom. Of eight younger sons of viscounts, two succeeded their brothers to the title. Of 13 younger sons of barons, two succeeded their brothers to the title, and another Member, whose brother was created a baron, succeeded him in the title. Two of these were promoted in the peerage, one as a British baron the other as baron and earl in turn. Of 28 younger sons of Scottish peers in the House, all except six sat at some time for Scottish constituencies. Five were dukes’ sons, one succeeding his brother to the title and another being created a British baron. Twenty were earls’ sons: one succeeded his brother as earl and British baron and three others were created British barons. Three were barons’ sons: one was created first an Irish then a British baron and finally a British viscount.\n\nSome peerage families were particularly well represented in their names alone: Abercromby (a father, four brothers and an uncle); Cavendish Bentinck (the Duke of Portland’s brother, three sons and a grandson); Beresford (the Marquess of Waterford’s five); Bouverie (the Earl of Radnor’s seven); Cavendish (the Duke of Devonshire’s seven), Clive (six), Cocks (six), Cust (five), two branches of the Dundas family (12), Fane (the Earl of Westmorland’s eight), Fitzroy (the Duke of Grafton’s six), Grenville (six), Grosvenor (six), Herbert (the Earl of Pembroke’s five), Hope (six), Leveson Gower (six), Lowther (six), Manners (six, plus four Suttons), Paget (six brothers), Ponsonby (nine), Russell (five), Seymour (eight), Smith (Lord Carrington’s six), Somerset (seven), Spencer (the Duke of Marlborough’s eight), Stewart (the Earl of Galloway’s five sons), Stuart (the Marquess of Bute’s six plus three Stuart Wortleys), Townshend (nine of both branches), and Wellesley (six).\n\nForty-seven Members who were already peers of Ireland sat in the House for non-Irish seats in this period: 16 earls, nine viscounts and 22 barons. Not counted in this number are nine Members who obtained Irish titles while in the House. Of the 47, 14 were created British barons, two of them promoted to Irish marquessates, one to a British and another to an Irish earldom. One succeeded to a British barony and one was created an Irish viscount; one was created a British viscount. Only 27 of the 47 were landlords of appreciable estates in Ireland, Irish peerages having become in the 18th century merely a reward for political services in Britain.\n\nIf over one-fifth of the House consisted of heirs or younger sons of peers, there were about 70 others who remained commoners but whose mothers were peers’ daughters, about 200 commoners who married into the peerage, and countless others who were connected with peerage families by blood, and frequently owed their return to the House to this fact. Six Members, too, were illegitimate sons of peers. One, Viscount Dursley, actually succeeded to the title before being disqualified: he was later created a baron, and died an earl after all. The Marquess of Waterford’s two illegitimate sons had Irish seats, as did the Duke of Devonshire’s illegitimate son and Lord Tyrawley’s. Richard Wellesley and Robert Knight, sired respectively by the Marquess Wellesley and the Earl of Catherlough, both Irish peers, sat for English constituencies.\n\nThe peerage promotions so far mentioned involved 35 sons and heirs of British peers (eight of them summoned to the Lords in their fathers’ barony in their fathers’ lifetime), and eight younger or illegitimate sons of British peers; 18 Irish peers, 14 heirs of Irish peers and 11 younger or illegitimate sons of Irish peers (one being for a wife); seven heirs of Scottish peers (three summoned to the Lords in their fathers’ lifetime) and five younger sons of Scottish peers. To these 98 must be added 98 commoners who were created peers, or whose wives were in four cases, one of which was followed by a peerage for the husband. In 18 cases further promotion occurred. Just over half (51) of these elevations were initiated in this period. The first was that of William Wyndham Grenville in 1790: his cousin the prime minister intended him to take the lead for government in the Lords. In 1794 Sir Henry Bridgeman, Assheton Curzon, Sir Thomas Dundas, Welbore Ellis and Charles Anderson Pelham, followers of the Duke of Portland, received peerages at the duke’s instigation when he and they went over to the government. They were among the many for whom the duke was pressed to apply for the honour. Sir Alexander Hood’s Irish peerage in the same year was an established form of recognition for naval services, but two years later he was further rewarded by a British one, rather than by promotion in the Irish peerage, and in 1800 he was made a British viscount. The dissolution of 1796 provided Pitt with an opportunity to reward some of his supporters who were ambitious of the honour: Sir Francis Bassett, Sir Peter Burrell, Sir Henry Gough Calthorpe, John Campbell I, Edward Lascelles, Charles Pierrepont, John Rolle, John Rous, Robert Smith and Joshua Vanneck. The last two obtained Irish peerages, but Smith was promoted to a British one a year later. Likewise, after a delay until the following year, Pitt ennobled Sir Gilbert Elliot, the wife of John Foster (then the Irish Speaker), James Grenville, Francis Humberston Mackenzie, Thomas Orde, Thomas Powys, Sir John Rushout, Charles Townshend, Sir George Allanson Winn and Sir John Wodehouse. Sir John Jervis received an earldom for his naval services the same year. In 1799 Sir John Scott received a peerage on his legal promotion. A year later Sylvester Douglas received an Irish one for his political services, and Alan Gardner for his naval services.\n\nApart from three legal peerages (Sir Richard Pepper Arden’s, Sir Edward Law’s and Sir John Mitford’s), Addington’s ministry saw only one Member ennobled—Henry Dundas, made a viscount in 1802. Pitt, during his second ministry, kicked Addington upstairs. Gerard Lake also received a peerage for his Indian services, though, as the King complained, he could ill afford the rank. One of Pitt’s last wishes was respected, though ‘an outrage to common decency’, when the wealthy Peter Isaac Thellusson was made an Irish peer a week after Pitt’s death. William Lygon’s peerage was another legacy of Pitt’s. Since the Union, new Irish peerages were to be bestowed only when three Irish titles became extinct. When, in the Grenville administration, this ensued, Fox was able to honour old obligations by procuring an Irish peerage for William Brabazon Ponsonby as well as British ones for John Crewe and Thomas Anson. Charles Pierrepont was promoted to an earldom. Alan Gardner’s promotion to the British peerage at the dissolution was his compensation from Lord Grenville for being nudged out of his constituency. The Duke of Portland’s application book after he took office in 1807 teemed with applications for peerages but none was granted to any commoner Member, apart from Gerard Lake’s promotion and Sir Thomas Manners Sutton’s peerage on becoming lord chancellor of Ireland in 1807, until 1812 when William Handcock’s Irish services were rewarded. In 1814 three war heroes, Sir Thomas Graham, Sir Rowland Hill and Sir Edward Pellew were ennobled (Pellew further in 1816). The retiring Speaker received a peerage in 1817 and Canning’s Irish cousin and namesake in 1818. Forty-seven peerages were granted to commoners, Members in this period, between 1821 and 1859.\n\nThe 98 heirs or younger sons of peers and Irish peers who were promoted in or to the peerage fall into a similar chronological pattern. Only 43 were ennobled before 1820. Lord Auckland exchanged an Irish for a British barony in 1793, bolstered by his diplomatic services. Henry Phipps, Lord Upper Ossory and Lord Clive, promoted in 1794, were Portland Whigs, as was Sir Ralph Payne, awarded an Irish barony in 1795 during an interlude in his Membership. Lord Hood received a British viscountcy for naval services in 1796, when two other Irish peers, Courtown and Downe, received British baronies. Mornington received a British barony on his transfer to India (1797) and, to his indignation, a mere step up in the Irish peerage for his services there (1799). Indian services also brought Lord Clive an earldom in 1804. Naval services inspired Sir George Keith Elphinstone’s first step in the peerage—an Irish barony—in 1797. Lord Hobart and Earl Gower were wafted to the Lords in their fathers’ lifetime in 1798 and 1799. Lord Charles Fitzgerald obtained a union peerage in 1800, while Lord Inchiquin became an Irish marquess in 1800 and a British baron in 1801, with royal connivance, and two other courtiers, the Irish peers Carysfort and Arden, received British baronies in 1801 and 1802. Thomas Pelham was kicked upstairs to join his father for Addington’s political purposes in 1801. Lord Sheffield obtained a British barony in 1802. The Marquess of Blandford joined his father in the Lords in 1806, having failed, as an officeholder, to find a seat in the Commons. The Grenville ministry bestowed a British barony on the Earl of Eglintoun, promoted Lord Templetown to an Irish viscountcy, made Lord Henry Fitzgerald’s wife a peeress, sent Lord Douglas to the Lords to join his father, and ennobled Thomas Erskine as lord chancellor. The Portland ministry sent the Marquesses of Dalkeith and Huntly up to the Lords to join their ducal fathers and made Lord Lowther an earl in 1807. In 1809 Perceval made Dudley Ryder and Lord Mulgrave earls: on Perceval’s death Lord Compton became a marquess, as did Lord Camden, Castlereagh’s step-uncle. Lord Percy joined his father in the Lords. The most startling progress was made by Sir Arthur Wellesley from viscount in 1809 to duke in 1814; patriotic services also procured a viscountcy for Lord Elphinstone and a barony for John Hope in 1814. A year later there were several promotions concurred in by the Regent, for personal reasons in the case of Lord Melbourne’s British barony. Lord Uxbridge, made a marquess, was a hero of Waterloo. Viscount Cole and Richard Trench were also military men. John Eliot, James Walter Grimston, John Cust and Orlando Bridgeman, all made earls, were more pedestrian supporters of government. More questionable was the carving out of a barony for the Duke of Marlborough’s younger and favourite son, Lord Francis Spencer, which dismantled the Blenheim estate. Lord Granville Leveson Gower’s viscountcy was a stipulation of his friend Canning on his realignment with government.\n\nMany Members were disappointed aspirants to peerages, or to promotion in the peerage. Reference to the biographies of Sir Jacob Astley, Sir John Aubrey, John Bagwell I (who lost a peerage ‘through a nickname’), Thomas Richard Beaumont, William Beckford, George Cranfield Berkeley, Christopher Bethell Codrington, Sir Eyre Coote, Charles Gregan Craufurd, Sir Henry Watkin Dashwood, Sir Compton Domvile, Gerard Noel Edwards, Sir Hew Dalrymple Hamilton, Richard Erle Drax Grosvenor, John Fownes Luttrell I, Sir Charles Gould and his son Charles Morgan, Sir James Graham of Netherby, Hans Hamilton, Christopher Hawkins, Sir William Heathcote, Henry Arthur Herbert, John Kynaston Powell, Robert Ladbroke, Sir John Lethbridge, Humphrey Minchin, Charles Small Pybus, Leonard Thomas Worsley Holmes and Sir George Yonge will suffice for a commentary on the vanity of their wishes.\n\nThe baronetcy, a status symbol for country gentlemen and social climbers, was an honour not less sought after by Members. No less than 234 of them succeeded to a baronetcy—usually their fathers’, though 14 succeeded uncles, 12 their brothers, five their grandfathers, one his great-uncle, one his father-in-law and four their cousins. One succeeded an ancestor whose title was in abeyance. There were three usurpers—one illegitimate (Stephen May), and two who assumed the title on the death of remote kinsmen (Sir John Wishart Belsches and Christopher Bethell Codrington. One Member, William Edward Tomline, declined his father’s baronetcy; another, William Ingilby, succeeded both his grandfather and his father to baronetcies (the latter was illegitimate and had obtained a fresh creation); two Members (Charles William Rouse Boughton and John Anstruther) succeeded to baronetcies after being created baronets, and one succeeded to Scottish and British baronetcies (Sir John Anstruther). Of the baronets by succession, 22 were created peers and eight succeeded to peerages (one being further promoted). Four of the latter succeeded to peerages before baronetcies. Six baronets (one also a peer) were knights as well. Of the baronets by succession, 143 were already baronets when they were Members in this period, 39 succeeded while Members, or in an interval between being Members in the period, and 51 succeeded after being Members.\n\nThe number of Members sitting in this period who were at some stage created baronets was 152, the average number sitting in each Parliament as baronets being 94. Forty-nine were already baronets when they sat in this period, 40 were so created after sitting, and the other 63 were created while Members, or in the interval of being Members: a sure pointer that their claims to the honour were reinforced by Membership. Of these 151, 20 were also knights; seven (two of them also knights) were created peers. Three were illegitimate (Charles Thompson, Sir John Ingilby and John Poo Beresford). A wide range of claims—of substance, antiquity of family, political and electoral support, public service or professional skill—were recognized in these creations. Even so a few Members were disappointed aspirants, usually, as in the case of Christopher Atkinson, because of a blot on their character.\n\nEqually harmless were knighthoods—plain ones for humbler aspirants such as municipal or legal officials and decorative ones for distinguished service. Seventy-six Members at some stage became knights bachelor—most of them legal men or self-made men. Sixteen of them went on to decorative knighthoods, 11 became baronets and ten peers. Some 200 Members were decorated. Forty-five were knights of the Bath (KB) by 1815, so created for distinguished public service, especially in wartime. After 1815, when the order was remodelled, 73 further Members (including Lord Cochrane, stripped of his KB in 1814) became knights grand cross, styled GCB, and 43 more became knights commanders, styled KCB. Another 15 became companions of the Bath. The orders confined to the nobility, namely the Garter (KG), the Thistle (KT) and St. Patrick (KP) included 45 former Members in this period for the Garter, 11 for the Thistle, and 17 for St. Patrick. The Royal Hanoverian Guelphic Order, instituted by the Prince Regent in August 1815 received Members in each of its three classes—though being a foreign order it did not entitle them to the style of knights bachelor in Britain. Its knights grand cross (GCH) included 30 Members, its knights commander (KCH) 14 more, and its knights (KH) another three Members. The Order of St. Michael and St. George, instituted for Malta and the Ionian Isles in 1818, attracted among Members a grand master, a knight commander and eight knights grand cross. One Member had previously become a knight of Malta. Another survived to become a knight of the Star of India. The House included several Members with foreign knighthoods exclusively Turkish and Austrian until a spate of them was bestowed by the Allies on others who had distinguished themselves in war against Buonaparte.\n\nIn a House with a property qualification for Membership the landowning classes—titled or otherwise—prevailed. A number of Members vied for the style of ‘the richest commoner in England’, though Richard Benyon II was satisfied to be the ‘richest commoner in Berkshire’; and John Rolle with estates worth £70,000 p.a. (in 1809) in Devon alone, Henry Bankes in Dorset and Thomas William Coke the agricultural improver in Norfolk were comparable. Those with nationwide pretensions included William Drake of Shardeloes and his progeny in the House; Charles Gould I (afterwards Sir Charles Morgan, Bt.), a wealthy lawyer who married a Welsh border heiress worth about £30,000 p.a.; Charles Anderson Pelham, created Lord Yarborough; John Tempest of Durham; Thomas Anson who left his son estates worth £70,000 p.a.; Sir James Tylney Long, whose heiress was one of the greatest catches in the kingdom, courted by a royal duke, and Sir Henry Paulet St. John Mildmay, whose wife brought him valuable estates. The favourite candidate for the honour of being the wealthiest commoner in the Empire might be Sir William Pulteney, who died reputedly worth £2 million in 1805, to the great benefit, in turn, of Sir James Murray, Bt., and John Murray.\n\nMany other Members had equally great expectations. John William Egerton inherited part of the Bridgwater estates with £2 million and a title in 1803, but the bulk of them went to Earl Gower, who became a leviathan of wealth. Sir William Lowther, Bt., inherited Lord Lonsdale’s northern estates and £100,000 personally in 1802. Cecil Forester got £17,000 p.a. in rents and £140,000 by succession to a cousin in 1811. James Henry Leigh inherited the Stoneleigh estate in 1806, with timber worth a million. Lord Herbert came into £35,000 a year on succeeding his father as Earl of Pembroke in 1794, Sir Horatio Mann inherited first a fortune from his father, then a fine estate in Kent from his uncle. John Willett Willett was left estates worth £10,000 p.a. by a cousin in 1795. William Sloane, heir to a Hampshire estate, was reputed to be a millionaire at his death in 1860; Sir William Abdy, another great landowner, died one in 1868. The Seymour Conway heirs came into £70,000 p.a. and £85,000 p.a. respectively in 1794 and 1822. Viscount Belgrave who succeeded to the Grosvenor estates in 1802 was thought to be the richest man in England at his death in 1845. In his case immensely valuable realty in London had helped. The Portmans, squires in Dorset, enjoyed a similar advantage. Sir Oswald Mosley was likewise made rich through being a ground landlord in Manchester, the Gough Calthorpes and Thomas Sherlock Gooch in Birmingham, Bamber Gascoyne in Liverpool and Thomas Kemp in Brighton. John Pitt was the largest private property owner in Gloucester.\n\nThe possession of mineral-bearing lands made some estates very lucrative. William Henry Lambton, the Durham colliery owner, was one of the richest commoners in England. Sir Henry Vane Tempest was similarly well placed (by inheritance from an uncle) and William Jolliffe, a southern squire, was made rich by Durham collieries. Thomas Richard Beaumont married a northern lead mine heiress. Sir Matthew White Ridley was at once landowner, industrial entrepreneur and banker in the Newcastle-upon-Tyne district. John William Ward was heir to substantial coal-bearing estates in the Midlands; so was Edward John Littleton. Cornish landowners speculated extensively in mining ventures, among them Sir William Lemon (also a banker), Sir Francis Basset, Christopher Hawkins and Ralph Allen Daniell. Basset got £22,000 in a good year from his mines. Thomas Williams was the Welsh copper king, worth half a million, and George Hay Dawkins Pennant the Welsh slate king. Sir Robert Peel, the first cotton king to enter Parliament, died a multi-millionaire in 1830. Other cotton kings were Samuel Horrocks of Preston (who took over from his brother John), John Hodson of Wigan, and George Philips and Thomas Houldsworth of Manchester. John Denison inherited an uncle’s wealth from the Yorkshire wool industry: his son William Joseph Denison died worth £2,300,000 in 1849. James Milnes was heir to a Yorkshire cloth magnate. Liquid wealth by inheritance amounted to £900,000 in the case of Sir Thomas Dundas and £700,000 in the case of Lord George Augustus Henry Cavendish, on the death of an uncle in 1810. Others had less to play with but invested shrewdly, ranging from Sir Gregory Page Turner, an old-fashioned money maniac who hesitated between government stock and his private hoard of gold, to Davies Giddy, who speculated with mathematical precision and had an intellectual interest in gambling, but settled for an Eastbourne heiress. The most successful financiers, the Baring family, formed a combine with American connexions. Sir Francis Baring was worth £80,000 p.a. and left at least half a million on his death in 1810. More humdrum were the banker MPs: Robert Biddulph, Rowland Burdon, Richard Muilman Trench Chiswell, John Dent, William Devaynes, Henry Drummond II, Richard Hanbury Gurney, Sir Benjamin Hammet, Thomas Harley, Robert Ladbroke, Ralph John Lambton, John Langston, John Latouche of Dublin, Samuel Jones Loyd (a future multi-millionaire), Ebenezer Maitland, James Martin, William Moffat, John Perring, Abraham Robarts, Robert Smith, James Walwyn, and Robert Williams II were the plutocrats though banking proved precarious for two of them, as it did for others less well-backed.\n\nMercantile wealth remained a springboard: it lay behind many a banking or industrial venture as well as being the time-honoured basis for the acquisition of landed estates. David Ricardo, the most theoretical of merchants, died leaving £700,000 in 1823, aged 51, despite being disinherited. Quintin Dick, son and nephew of wealthy East India merchants, died a millionaire in 1858. The three Thellusson brothers were heirs to £700,000 when their father died in 1797. Alexander Baring had a million to invest in land. William McDowall and Archibald Speirs by inheritance, and Kirkman Finlay by enterprise, represented Glasgow mercantile fortunes. Edward Ellice was bolstered by Canadian trade wealth and invested in land there. The Thornton brothers represented a family fortune in the Baltic trade. John Cator, a London timber merchant, died ‘very rich’ in 1806. Other wealthy London merchants were William Curtis, John Irving and George Hibbert. Brewing and distilling made fortunes for the Calverts, Henry Isherwood, Philip Metcalfe and the Whitbreads; corn dealing for Christopher Atkinson; flour mills for John Bagwell (‘Old Bags’); estate jobbing for Robert Mackreth and Joseph Pitt; pharmacy for Sir Samuel Hannay; portrait-painting, followed by a fortunate marriage, for Nathaniel Dance.\n\nNabobs returned home from India formed another group of wealthy MPs. Some of them invested in banking or trade as well as land and stocks. Notably wealthy among them were Boyd Alexander, James Alexander, Richard Barwell, Robert Biddulph, Alexander Brodie, Patrick Craufurd Bruce, Sir John Hadley D’Oyly, James Andrew Drummond, Philip Dundas, Charles Forbes, George Graham, Joseph Hume, Edward Monckton, Peter Moore, Sir William Paxton, the Petrie brothers, Robert Preston (who invested in shipping and died a millionaire), David Scott I, Sir Francis Sykes, John Benn Walsh, Walter Wilkins and Mark Wood I. West India proprietors, especially those with mercantile investments, were also a well-to-do group, though their fortunes were on the decline by the end of the period. Notable among these were Alexander Allardyce, Evan and James Baillie, William Beckford (‘England’s wealthiest son’), Samuel Boddington, Christopher Bethell Codrington and Sir William Codrington, James Dawkins, Charles Rose Ellis and George Ellis, Edward Lascelles, Sir Manasseh Lopes, Richard Meyler, William Mitchell and his nephew John, George Watson Taylor and Sir David Wedderburn.\n\nFortunes could also be made in the professions. In the law, Thomas Erskine, Sir Edward Law, Sir John Scott, Robert Percy Smith (who made over £150,000 in India) and George Wood were the outstanding examples. Soldiering in India made fortunes for Gabriel Doveton and Sir Hector Munro. Naval prize money made Sir Edward Pellew rich.\n\nThere were many more Members who might be described as self-made in this period than in the preceding one—well over 100 of them. Few were men of genius like Edmund Burke and Richard Brinsley Sheridan, or, like George Canning or William Huskisson, aspired to statesmanship. Outstanding ability brought Sir John Scott and his brother William, sons of a Newcastle-upon-Tyne coalfitter, to the top of their profession. A number of other successful men of law were of humble origin: in Ireland, Patrick Duigenan, James Fitzgerald, William Conyngham Plunket and John Stewart I spring to mind. In England William Draper Best, Henry Peter Brougham, John Singleton Copley, Vicary Gibbs, Robert Gifford, William Grant (a Highland Scot), French Laurence, John Leach, Sir Christopher Robinson, Sir Samuel Romilly, James Stephen and George Wood made the law their highway. Attorneys were even more likely to be self-made than barristers and often owed their seats in Parliament to their astuteness in borough management or to the influence of their clients. John Edwards went further and sat for a Welsh county. Thomas Williams, the Welsh copper king, started life as an attorney. Evan Foulkes, another Welshman, remained one and cultivated an aristocratic clientele in London. Gilbert Jones from Herefordshire had a similar success story, as did Richard Wilson II (‘Morpeth Dick’). James Kibblewhite became patron of the borough of Wootton Bassett. Joseph Pitt, banker, land jobber, brewer, picture collector, landowner and boroughmonger, was a carpenter’s son who got his start as an attorney. Thomas Claughton, a Warring-ton attorney, became a large-scale property speculator. The services also had their quota of self-made men: witness Sir Home Riggs Popham, Sir Thomas Troubridge and Francis John Wilder.\n\nA batch of Members might be compared to Dick Whittington in their rise from rags to riches. Walter Boyd, John Barker Church (who made his fortune in America after being a bankrupt grocer), William Devaynes, Samuel Farmer, Pascoe Grenfell, John Maberly, Philip Metcalfe, Richard Ramsbottom, David Ricardo, Christopher Smith, Samuel Whitbread I, Luke White in Dublin, Robert Wigram I, Robert Williams II; John Atkins, John Perring, Sir James Sanderson, James Shaw and Brook Watson, all five lord mayors of London; Christopher Atkinson (who had two lives, the second under the name of Savile), Thomas Coxhead, George Gipps I, John Gladstone of Liverpool, Thomas Hall, Sir Benjamin Hammet, John Irving, William Jacob, Joseph Marryat, William Moffat, Robert Preston, Claude Scott, Thomas Thompson II and Robert Waithman all made mercantile and banking fortunes after starting off with next to nothing. Three stationer MPs, Matthew Bloxam, Joseph Butterworth and James Simmons, might be added to them.\n\nSome of the nabobs were men of humble or modest origins: Alexander Allan, Richard Barwell, Paul Benfield, John Call, Charles Grant I, Joseph Hume, Peter Moore, James Paull, Michael George Prendergast, John Prinsep, David Vanderheyden and John Benn Walsh started off with few advantages in life. The same was true of several Members who made fortunes in industry—notably Benjamin Benyon, John Hodson, Samuel Homfray, John and Samuel Horrocks and Thomas Houldsworth. Some self-made men were models of wish-fulfilment: such were Robert Mackreth, a former waiter; John McMahon, the Regent’s factotum; Thomas Wildman, agent to William Beckford, whom he systematically fleeced: and several Members who pandered to Whig sensibilities such as Lucius Concannon, demi-mondain purveyor of amenities; William Roscoe, scholar-poet, Thomas Creevey, gossip (and, like Roscoe, on the face of it a Liverpudlian de basse souche); James Hare, wit; Francis Horner and Sir James Mackintosh, intellectuals; John Palmer, pioneer of the flying post; Joseph Richardson, playwright, and William Taylor, opera manager.\n\nOver 200 Members got into conspicuous financial difficulties or were ruined, many of them after the end of this period. At least 35 were driven abroad and died there. It is likely that a number of other Members who died abroad were at least economizing; many went abroad for short periods, France being their usual place of asylum. Some of them went elsewhere provided with places (William Wilberforce Bird to Cape Town, George Galway Mills to Sydney, John Jeffery to Lisbon, John Meade to Madrid). Three others died in the Isle of Man and two (non-Irishmen) in Ireland. Seven Members died in prison for debt: Thomas Cherburgh Bligh, Viscount Kingsborough, Sir Watkin Lewes, John Mytton, William Odell, John Pytches and John Wharton. Edmund Lechmere died in sanctuary at Holyrood.\n\nThe immunity from arrest for debt enjoyed by Members of the House meant inevitably that a number of them had to be in Parliament. The reductio ad absurdum of this occurred in 1818 when Robert Christie Burton, elected that year, was ordered out of a debtor’s prison by the House, following his application to the Speaker. He fled abroad at the dissolution. Although only about 15 Members in the period were, notoriously, in the House to benefit from such immunity, there must have been many more who took advantage of it. The case of Benjamin Walsh, who clearly entered the House as a debtor’s expedient, drew unfavourable attention to the anomaly in 1812, but the case of Christie Burton illustrates that it remained on sufferance.\n\nThe causes of Members’ financial setbacks were various. Failure in business and speculation were the most common. The collapse of banks in which they were partners overtook John Agnew, Matthew Bloxam, Walter Boyd, Patrick Craufurd Bruce, Rowland Burdon, Richard Muilman Trench Chiswell, Sir George Cornewall, John Fordyce, Thomas Harley, William Lushington, William Mainwaring, Sir Simon John Newport, William Roscoe, Robert Salusbury, James Charles Stuart Strange and George Templer, before 1820; and Robert Chaloner, Robert Alexander Crickitt, George Duckett, William Elford, Hugh Hammersley, John Perring, George Simson, Gabriel Tucker Steward and Godfrey Wentworth Wentworth later on. Apart from the bankers, several merchant MPs and rather more speculators were ruined, most of them after 1820. West India proprietors became extremely vulnerable towards the end of the period. Others staved off ruin by new ventures—several nabobs went back to India—or were rescued by their friends. Most of them lived their later years in obscurity—a few have not been traced to their deathbeds. General extravagance was the commonest cause of ruin among landowner Members. In some cases, electioneering played the chief role: Valentine John Blake, Augustus Cavendish Bradshaw, Denis Bowes Daly, John Jones, Thomas Potter Macqueen, William Maxwell II, Ralph Milbanke, John Owen, Ralph Verney, William Pole Tylney Long Wellesley, James Hamlyn Williams and Sir George Yonge are the most notorious examples, but over half of these succumbed after 1820. Compulsive gambling ruined William Burroughs, Charles Chapman, Charles Bagot Chester, George Harley Drummond and William Shipley, but such a fashionable vice must have claimed many other victims without being the principal known or assigned cause of their downfall. Sport and dissipation or an extravagant life-style were often contributory. Building and collecting, prospecting and inventing were other manias that took their toll. The lives of William Beckford and George Watson Taylor illustrate this, but they were only the most notorious examples. Prudence and good management of their own affairs were so far from being a characteristic even of the most statesmanlike politicians of the period that Pitt and Fox were in constant financial difficulties, and Richard Brinsley Sheridan spent much of his time avoiding his creditors.\n\nEDUCATION\n\nParticulars of the pre-university education of about 1,240 of the 2,143 Members between 1790 and 1820 have been obtained. Of these over 1,200 attended schools, the rest having been educated privately, that is at home by a tutor, or as pupils, usually of a neighbouring or school-keeping clergyman. Doubtless many of the Members whose schooling is unrecorded were privately educated. By this period evidence is available of preparatory schooling, usually in small establishments run by the clergy. As for the public schools, the favourite by far was Eton, attended by about 400 Members. Westminster, eclipsed by Eton in the preceding period of the History, had 239 Members among its scholars. Harrow emerged into the limelight in this period, with an intake of 177 Members. By 1826 it produced more Members than Westminster School. Winchester yielded at least 60 and almost certainly more: the imprecision of the school registers makes some identities uncertain. Charterhouse was also attracting patronage and educated 35 Members, while Rugby educated 27. These two schools were becoming fashionable. Shrewsbury remained in eclipse. Its catchment area was local, but the defective registers obscure attendance. Twenty or more Members were educated at Edinburgh High School. About 240 schools, preparatory or secondary, were involved in the education of the rest: none of them is known to have educated more than ten Members. (Newcome’s Academy at Hackney was by now defunct, but other academies with a dissenting flavour were attended by some Members.) Blundells, Felsted and Tonbridge drew local scholars. Many Members of modest origins attended grammar schools. It is clear, however, that Members were more likely to have been to public schools in this period than in the preceding one. About 30 Members attended, in turn, two public schools.\n\nBy 1818 nearly 60 per cent of the Members had attended university. Of the two English universities, Oxford still attracted more matriculants among Members than Cambridge—531 to 414. Among the Oxford colleges, Christ Church, which took about a seventh of the undergraduates, attracted 285 Members. Dr Cyril Jackson, the dean, was the most forceful educator for public life of his day, and from 1806 Christ Church produced more Members than the rest of the Oxford colleges put together. Among the Cambridge colleges Trinity attracted 151 Members, but St. John’s, which it outnumbered by the 1780s, did not lag far behind. Trinity College, Dublin had 110 Members as matriculants. The Scottish universities attracted at least 70 Members and probably more: the unpublished Edinburgh matriculation registers pose problems of identity. Glasgow and Edinburgh accounted for most of them, and attracted about the same number each. About a dozen Members, at least, attended continental universities, chiefly the German ones with their rising reputation. About 20 Members attended continental military academies; about as many as are known to have attended military and naval academies at home. Less evidence is available on commercial education, but it is supplied in the case of Members in the East India Company service from their applications for writerships in the Haileybury records at the India Office library.\n\nJust over 500 Members were entered at the inns of court, which is no guarantee that they studied law there—some 225 were not called to the bar. A minority of those who were called did not practise. Lincoln’s Inn was by far the favourite, attracting just over 300 entrants, half of whom were not called. The Middle Temple attracted just over 100, a higher proportion of whom were called; the same is true of the Inner Temple, which attracted about 65. Gray’s Inn was of little account in this period. Fifty Irish Members were admitted to the King’s Inns at Dublin, and since by a statute of 1783 such admission was open to them as students at an English inn of court, only their call to the Irish bar has been specified.\n\nThe Grand Tour, the classic 18th-century finish to a gentleman’s education, remained mandatory until the French Revolution. Subsequent events led to the tentative substitution for it of a continental tour, sometimes a hazardous one in time of war. Thus about 90 Members of the older generation are known to have done the Grand Tour, but over 100 embarked on the continental tour, some of them seeing Northern Europe only. Fewer Members than in the preceding period finished their education abroad. Exploration of the Lake District, Scotland, Wales and Ireland, which consoled travellers for their exclusion from Napoleonic Europe, attracted many Members, some of them being pioneers in this field; a few others went to Asia. After 1814 many Members visited Europe, which those who had grown up since 1790 scarcely knew.\n\nRELIGIOUS AFFILIATION\n\nAlthough there are three times as many Members in this section of the History as in the last who are known to have been brought up outside the established churches of England, Scotland and Ireland, there was no commensurate increase in their influence on the House as a whole. There were still fewer than 60 of them, and many of these later conformed. This was necessarily true of all those of Roman Catholic background: Ralph Sheldon and Sir Thomas Gascoigne, scions of old English Catholic families, educated at Douai, and four or five Irish Members—Richard Martin and Richard Wogan Talbot, who themselves conformed, and Henry Augustus Dillon Lee and Gerard Callaghan through their fathers’ conversion. (The religious allegiance of Dr Patrick Duigenan’s parents is in some doubt but his character was represented as that of a virulent convert from Catholicism.) Before he entered Parliament, the Earl of Rocksavage was a convert to Catholicism, but his subsequent tendency was to Methodism: he was regarded as a religious maniac. A few Members married Catholics: the marriage of the 1st Marquess of Buckingham to a Catholic had political repercussions in attaching his clan to the Catholic cause, and William O’Dell’s marriage proved an electoral handicap in 1818.\n\nFive Members had a Jewish background. Lord Eardley, baptized as a youth, first sat in 1770. In this period Manasseh Lopes and his nephew Ralph Franco, both baptized in 1802, came of Sephardi families, as did David Ricardo, who married ‘out’ and became a Unitarian. Ralph Bernal, who conformed, came of mixed Sephardi and Ashkenazi parentage. Thomas Thompson I was the reputed son of a Jewish stockbroker, but his mother’s faith is not known.\n\nMembers of the Society of Friends (Quakers) had also to conform to sit in the House. To this category belong the two Penns, descendants of the founder of Pennsylvania; Nathaniel Dimsdale, whose father sat before 1790, as did John Cator and Henry Beaufoy; Charles Barclay, Robert Barclay Allardice (who remained a Friend in private life) and, probably, George Barclay, who certainly posed as a dissenter to win electoral support at Bridport. John Jeffery and Robert Waithman were reputed to have Quaker backgrounds. Thomas Fowell Buxton’s mother was a Quaker and he was much influenced by the Friends in the formation of his philanthropic outlook. David Ricardo (mentioned above) and Thomas Baring were the most conspicuous among Members married to Quakers.\n\nIn Scotland, where the established kirk was presbyterian, such episcopalians as William McDowall and David Murray were dissenters; but so, by the same token, were Scots sitting for English constituencies. For instance, James Watson and John Gladstone of Liverpool were Scottish Presbyterians. The former was at one time pastor of a presbyterian and independent congregation in England, but conformed; Gladstone conformed some 15 years before he entered the House. Two Irish Members at least were baptized as Presbyterians in Ulster: Lord Castlereagh and William Conyngham Plunket. James Craig and James Blair possibly were also. Sir Henry Hoghton was a Lancashire Presbyterian of gentry stock; his son Henry Philip apparently conformed. Sir William Middleton, 5th Bt., was another northern dissenter whose heirs conformed. Benjamin Benyon came of a distinguished presbyterian family. Richard Slater Milnes was the son of a presbyterian cloth merchant at Wakefield; his own son Robert Pemberton Milnes retained dissenting sympathies, particularly with Unitarians. William Curtis also had a presbyterian family background. Congregationalism (its adherents as yet still styled Independents) was not so well represented: Joshua and Samuel Walker of Rotherham were of independent background. There are some doubts about Matthew Wood and Thomas Pares, whose parents were certainly dissenters of some kind. Benjamin Shaw had dissenting sympathies, though his religious background is not clear. Nathaniel Newnham’s father was a dissenter.\n\nUnitarianism was the avant garde of protestant dissent in this period, a development foreshadowed in the preceding one. John Lee, by now the veteran Unitarian in the House, conformed occasionally. James Martin was attracted to ‘rational Christianity’, as perhaps was his son John. James Adair and Daniel Whittle Harvey had unitarianism in their backgrounds. Robert Wigram was converted by his first wife’s family, but his mother insisted that his first son Robert should be baptized into the established church. Samuel Jones Loyd’s father was at one time a unitarian minister. John Carter conformed to attend university. Joseph Birch and possibly George Philips were attracted to unitarianism. Benjamin Vaughan, William Smith, Benjamin Hobhouse and William Roscoe were perhaps the most interesting unitarian Members. The intellectual appeal to them of unitarian doctrine was apparent—in Roscoe’s case his previous background was presbyterian, and in Smith’s independent. Vaughan’s dissent took on a radical political colouring. Hobhouse graduated self-consciously to ‘humanitarianism’, the logical conclusion of his emancipation from dogma.\n\nFrederick North—an odd man out—was a youthful convert to Greek orthodoxy in 1791. Other Members were to be involved in the sects that flourished in the 19th century: Henry Drummond II, a leader of the Irvingites; Spencer Perceval, the premier’s son, also an Irvingite; Edward Denny who joined the Plymouth Brethren, and Thomas Read Kemp, who seceded both from Parliament and the established church in 1816 to found a short-lived and obscure religious sect.\n\nAs can be seen in the preceding section of the History, the educational reputation of dissenting academies in 18th-century England had attracted to them pupils, many of them from gentry families, whose background was not nonconformist. This tendency was now on the decline. The dissolution of Newcome’s Academy at Hackney was its chief feature. Robert Gifford and Richard Sharp were examples of Members known to have been educated by dissenters.\n\nWesleyan Methodism, potentially the most powerful new impulse to dissent in 18th-century England, did not formally separate from the established church until 1811. Its first sympathizers in the House, led by Sir Richard Hill, sought to inject their enthusiasm into the church, rather than separate from it. Two Members were out-and-out Wesleyans: Thomas Thompson II and Joseph Butterworth. The latter, grandson of a Baptist minister, was a spokesman in the House for Wesleyans. Later converts included the Earl of Rocksavage and Benjamin Bloomfield, and possibly John Simeon. Joseph Foster Barham’s mother had Wesleyan sympathies and his father was one of the Moravian Brethren, whom he himself supported financially though he conformed. Wesleyanism was not without its fashionable element and the 2nd Baron Kensington, for instance, had no objection to attending their worship: it did him no harm with his constituents there.\n\nWithin the Church of England there was already a movement to convert the community to ‘vital religion’. The Evangelists played a more prominent role in the House than all the dissenters combined. Their leading representatives, who had all become Members by 1790, were William Wilberforce and his cousins Henry, Samuel and Robert Thornton, founders of the Clapham sect. They were nicknamed the Saints. Other Members sympathized with them, notably Walter Spencer Stanhope and William Mainwaring among the veteran Members, and the Hon. Edward James Eliot; and among the new ones, all of them Wilberforce’s followers, James Stephen (his brother-in-law), Thomas Babington, Charles Noel Noel, Charles Grant I and his sons Charles and Robert, Sir Thomas Dyke Acland, William Taylor Money and Frederick Gough Calthorpe. Members who had a strong evangelical streak in their religion must be headed by Spencer Perceval, the premier from 1809 to 1812, and Nicholas Vansittart, chancellor of the Exchequer from 1812. They also included John Gladstone, William Coles Medlycott, Edward Monckton and Thomas Read Kemp: the latter, however, formed his own sect in 1816, leaving Parliament to do so. The zeal which characterized the Evangelicals in their reaction against the mandatory quality of being religious ‘without enthusiasm’ proclaimed on so many 18th-century memorial tablets was shared by Members who did not necessarily sympathize with evangelical aims. Thomas Baring, married to a Quaker, was a very active religious philanthropist, while Henry Fitzroy, Earl of Euston, was a fanatical Anglican and teetotaller.\n\nReligious conformity had too many social advantages to make it likely that rebels would ever form a large or cohesive group in the House. The fear of social disorder generated by the French Revolution created a barrier to the rationalizing tendencies of 18th-century enlightenment, especially among the upper classes of society. They paid increasing lip-service to religion in general, though most were content to subscribe to ancestral tenets. Nearly 100 Members were themselves sons of established clergy in England, Wales and Ireland. They included six English archbishops’ sons and ten bishops’ sons. Another 12 were the sons of Scottish established clergymen. Seven Members went on to become clergymen (Richard Bagwell, Henry Bowyer, Hon. William Herbert, Hon. Richard Boyle Bernard, Hon. James Somers Cocks, John William Drage Merest and John Gordon). From 1801, by 41 Geo. III, c.63, clergymen of the established church in England and Scotland were statutorily excluded from the House, a measure inspired by the presence in it of John Horne Tooke, who had once been in holy orders.\n\nFreemasonry in its English form was no badge of dissent. No distinct political undertones are discernible in it, though the evidence available is limited. George III’s father had supplied it with royal patronage, and although the King himself steered clear of it, his brother and sons were patrons of masonic lodges. The Britannic Lodge of which George, Prince of Wales was master numbered the following Members among its brethren: Peter William Baker, Robert Haldane Bradshaw, Sir Lionel Darell, John Dent, Sir John Doyle, Martin Browne Ffolkes, William Garthshore, Pascoe Grenfell, Henry Hobart, Charles Kinnaird, Gerard Lake, Stephen Lushington, Nathaniel Newnham, Thomas Boothby Parkyns, Peter Patten, Charles Small Pybus, John Willett Payne, George Porter, John Ramsbottom, George Shum, Thomas Drake Tyrwhitt and Sir John Borlase Warren. In this miscellany there is no political leitmotiv. Many other Members are known to have been masons, but it has not been thought necessary to identify them as such unless it was a pronounced hobby of theirs as other social activities were for their compeers.\n\nPLACEMEN AND PENSIONERS\n\nThese pejorative terms had been part of the stock in trade of the ‘Country’ opposition to the ‘Court’ since the Restoration. Members holding places and pensions were, in this view, paid supporters of the King’s government, incapable of independence. There was, however, a distinction, if only a nominal one, between Members appointed to office by a given administration and those who held court office and were not as likely to be affected by changes of administration, which was also true of those who were granted offices or pensions for life, often termed sinecurists in the same pejorative vocabulary. Opposition jealousy of place-holders and pensioners continued throughout this period. New political offices, such as the third secretaryship of state created in wartime, or legal offices with political undertones, such as the vice-chancellorship, were the subject of critical debate. It was sinecure offices, however, that were most effectively attacked, the ringleader being Henry Bankes, though he was not a political enemy of the government. From 1807 onwards increasing publicity was given to sinecures held by Members, and many of them stood to lose these perquisites by the gradual implementation of reform.\n\nHow many placemen were there in the House? In the Parliament of 1790 there were up to 40 salaried political office-holders, another 16 holding efficient legal office, ten holding minor offices which would now be regarded as civil service appointments, and 18 court office-holders. There were some 39 sinecurists at home and abroad, ten of whom also held efficient office. There were also ten employees of the Prince of Wales, at that time inclined to opposition politics. There was a slight increase in political office-holders in the Parliament of 1796 due to offices created in wartime, and from 1801 some additional Irish offices (Irish placemen were statutorily limited to 20 out of 100 Members). There were fewer sinecurists, and the Prince of Wales’s employees were halved in number following the pruning of his establishment. The Parliament of 1802 was conspicuous for two changes of ministry, so the number of political office-holders increased in aggregate, swollen also by a full complement of Irish office-holders. There was a decrease in the number of courtiers and sinecurists. The short Parliament of 1806 with two prime ministers included in all 73 place-holders in Britain and Ireland and 24 sinecurists (five being in both categories); II courtiers and seven of the Prince of Wales’s employees. The Parliament of 1807, with two remodellings of the ministry, included 88 place-holders in all, 26 sinecurists and 19 courtiers (amalgamating the King’s and the Prince of Wales’s on account of the Regency). But 13 of these are included in two of the categories. The Parliament of 1812, which produced no change of ministry and only a slight reshuffle, had only 71 place-holders, 20 sinecurists and 18 courtiers. Eight names are duplicated. The House elected in 1818 provided an ascetic model with 57 place-holders, 15 sinecurists and 13 courtiers—six names being duplicated. Not included in these computations are very minor sinecures, such as governorships of castles, for which the remuneration was nominal. Sometimes included and sometimes not are some 40 Members who were in receipt of state pensions for themselves or their wives while in the House. Ten of these had been on the Irish list since the Union. Four were diplomatic pensions, of which the most curious was the £5,130 p.a. granted Lord Grenville’s nephew Henry Watkin Williams Wynn in compensation for the loss of his envoyship to Saxony in wartime: he retained it until 1816. Five were rewards for active service. Most of the rest were compensatory for the loss of political office or contingent on temporary deprivation of it. Sinecures, rather than pensions, were the usual consolation for political losers, but as the campaign against sinecures gained momentum the notion of the state pension as a reward for public service became more acceptable: it was a subject of legislation in the civil service compensation bill in 1817.\n\nDiplomats as such have not been included among the place-holders. In theory at least a career diplomat was unlikely to become a Member unless he did so before being bound for diplomacy, or after his retirement from it. Nevertheless, of 78 Members who held diplomatic appointments, only 13 sat exclusively before their appointments and only 20 exclusively after their diplomatic service. Two sat before and after. Twenty-two Members sat during their diplomatic appointments, another five before and during, nine during and after, four between holding posts, one between and during, and two before, during and after. Even so, most of the diplomatic appointments in question were of a temporary nature, predominantly emissaries and envoys extraordinary.\n\nCOUNTRY GENTLEMEN\n\nThe 18th-century ideal for a Member of Parliament was the country gentleman, self-sufficient, independent of Court and party alike, who judged every issue in the House on its merits. In practice, of course, this left him little scope for initiative or effective action. Even so, neither government nor opposition could count on the invariable support of Members who in a House based on landed property qualification made their independence a badge of virtue. Not only county Members, but country landowners representing close and sometimes open boroughs were ready to adopt this stance. The country gentleman was by definition no seeker after political rewards: he gave his support to good government, the more economical the better, and had no truck with ‘factious’ opposition. He needed reassurance about government measures and was suspicious of innovation, unless it was disguised as restoration, or answered his local problems. In the latter sphere he came nearest to initiative; if neither the government nor any other Member was prepared to act, he would—though few of his kind had the acumen or perseverance necessary to carry through their legislative projects. Eloquence was not to be expected of them; the language of plain protest was their forte.\n\nThe negative political role of the country gentlemen had been underlined in 1784 and 1788 by their failure to lobby convincingly for a coalition of Pitt and Fox in a patriotic administration. The term ‘third party’, applied to their endeavour in 1788, was in itself a sentence of political flotation. Pitt incurred their further displeasure when he seemed to be set upon war with Russia in 1791-2, and many of them voted with opposition; but after the excesses of the French Revolution they were prepared to support war against the would-be destroyers of the social fabric. William Windham wooed the Portland Whigs among them in 1793 for his ‘third party’, a ginger group that adumbrated Portland’s eventual accession to government a year later. Portland’s own fears that he was placing too much confidence in a partisan government were to some extent mirrored by these recruits, and some subsequently showed rebellious tendencies, but not en bloc. The prolongation of war and the suspension of civil liberties worried them most, though they also made difficulties, in 1795, about the payment of the Prince of Wales’s debts. Some of them continued to vote for parliamentary reform, although Pitt had set his face against it. In 1797 there was another ‘third party’ bid to remodel the government, a notion again attractive to them in time of crisis. The storm blew over, and they swallowed Pitt’s fiscal measures for prolonging the war, but with reservations that concentrated on his land tax redemption bill and the inquisitorial aspects of the income tax. The secession of the Foxite opposition neither met with their approval nor led to their taking initiatives: the reversionary interest of the Prince of Wales, too, attracted only a few in these years.\n\nPitt’s successor Addington prided himself on the support of the country gentlemen, and, after making peace, he in large measure obtained it; but Canning, ring-leader of the attempted coup to restore Pitt to power, was able to recruit country gentlemen for that too. The number who voted against Addington in the divisions on defence that brought him down in 1804 was an indication of their waning confidence in him. Pitt’s second ministry nearly toppled when his colleague Lord Melville’s conduct incurred their displeasure in 1805. The Grenville ministry relied on their distaste for partisan opposition, and became the victim of it on ceding office to Portland a year later: the King’s conscientious stand against commitment to Catholic relief was one they by and large approved.\n\nThe Parliament of 1807 posed issues which provoked a conflict of loyalties among them. When the only alternative was a divided opposition, should an inept government that drifted from crisis to crisis be overthrown? On the brink of abetting it in March 1810, they shrank back for fear of placing themselves in the hands of Burdett and the mob. Spencer Perceval, shouldering burdens that were not of his making, impressed them and the Regent: Canning, his would-be replacement, did not. Nor in some respects did Lord Liverpool, who on Perceval’s assassination took over the reins of government. They made him feel it at once, but saw that there was no practicable alternative. Liverpool’s neutrality on Catholic relief was offset by the country gentlemen’s residual hostility: the backwoodsmen among them turned up to thwart the relief bill in 1813. They also insisted, except for a few Whig dissidents, on protection for the agricultural interest in 1814-15 and government was hard put to it to moderate their demands. Above all, with the advent of peace, they were sticklers for tax relief and government retrenchment: they gave the government a difficult time throughout the session of 1816 on these topics, and again in 1818 on the grants awarded the royal princes. On that occasion Liverpool took the step of summoning a representative gathering of them to Fife House to state the case for supporting the grants: his embarrassment was increased by their subjecting him to some home truths. The threat of radical disorder in 1819-20, however, found them once more rallying to the government.\n\nLAWYERS AND OTHER PROFESSIONAL MEN\n\nAmong the professions the law stood foremost in the House, though next in numbers to the army in a period of war. Nearly 300 barristers sat in the House in this period, including over 40 called to the Irish bar and some 35 Scottish advocates. Average ages at entry were 37½ for English barristers, 45 for Irish and 39 for Scots advocates—compared with the overall average of 33 11/33 years. There were also a dozen civil lawyers, whose average age at entry was over 40. Of the 300, nearly one-third are either not known to have practised (in 60 or so cases) or did so only for a relatively short time. Inheritance or fortunate marriage were the best pretexts for retirement; disinclination for circuit life and its slow rewards was another cogent reason. Thirty-five Members started as barristers but switched to politics or some other profession. Those who made a career of the law, whether or not they obtained legal office, therefore numbered about 165; of these about two-thirds were spared the quest for briefs by obtaining office. For successful barristers, however, the decision to enter Parliament and public life was often a painful one, involving loss of income.\n\nFifty-five barrister Members in this period took silk or patents of precedence (which obviated the re-election to the House necessary for a KC), ten being Irish. One took silk as early as 1754 and the latest in 1834. All but five took silk during George III’s reign, and of 105 patents granted by the King all but 38 were to barristers who sat in Parliament at some stage. About 40 barrister Members were recorders of boroughs, often the borough they represented. Twenty-seven Members were commissioners of bankruptcy; 12 were masters in Chancery. Over a dozen were employed as counsel to the Admiralty, the Board of Control, the East India Company, the Bank, the two English universities and the Irish boards, or to English government departments. Several others were duchy of Lancaster or Cornwall officials. Over 40 held minor legal offices, sometimes sinecures—excluding here such as were obtained by the top-ranking lawyers as their perquisites. Over 30 barristers either took political office without embarking on a legal career, or practised for a few years only. Two barristers became advocates (civil lawyers).\n\nThe lord chancellor, head of the profession, presided over the House of Lords. Like his immediate predecessors Edward Thurlow and Alexander Wedderburn, Sir John Scott who became lord chancellor as Lord Eldon in 1801 had sat in the Commons as a law officer of the crown. Thomas Erskine, the Whig who replaced him briefly during the Grenville ministry, had no such experience, though he had been a law officer to the Prince of Wales. In 1813 Parliament authorized the institution of a vice-chancellor to assist the overburdened Eldon. Sir Thomas Plumer was chosen, succeeded in 1818 by Sir John Leach until 1827. Eldon’s successors John Singleton Copley and Henry Peter Brougham were Members in this period. The lord chancellor’s spokesman in the Commons was the master of the rolls: in this period, Richard Pepper Arden, William Grant and Thomas Plumer, subsequently Robert Gifford, John Singleton Copley and John Leach. The attorney-general was the leading lawyer in the Commons and responsible for the legal aspect of government business, in which he was assisted by the solicitor-general. These two law officers often initiated legislation, or at least gave their opinions on it. The following were the law officers:\n\nAttorney-general Solicitor-general Sir Archibald Macdonald1788-1793Sir John ScottSir John Scott1793-1799Sir John MitfordSir John Mitford1799-1801Sir William GrantSir Edward Law1801-1802Hon. Spencer PercevalHon. Spencer Perceval1802-1806Sir Thomas Manners Sutton\n\nSir Vicary Gibbs (from 1805)Sir Arthur Leary Piggott1806-1807Sir Samuel RomillySir Vicary Gibbs1807-1812Sir Thomas PlumerSir Thomas Plumer1812-1813Sir William Garrow\n\nSir Robert DallasSir William Garrow1813-1817Sir Samuel ShepherdSir Samuel Shepherd1817-1819Sir Robert GiffordSir Robert Gifford1819-1824Sir John Singleton Copley\n\nThe succession was broken only by the changes of ministry in 1801, 1806 and 1807; and by reshuffles in 1805 and 1813. Former law officers still in the House were John Lee and Richard Pepper Arden; future ones included Charles Wetherell, James Scarlett, Thomas Denman and William Horne.\n\nMost of these prominent lawyers had modest backgrounds, though Spencer Perceval—the future prime minister—was a peer’s son, and eschewed the knighthood which had become automatic for law officers. Samuel Romilly would have adorned any profession. William Grant (like Perceval) was a notable debater. In general the House was reputedly not fond of lawyers’ speeches, and most of the law officers were plodding, if conscientious, professionals. Political enthusiasm was rare among them: Thomas Plumer’s attachment to Perceval was exceptional, that of the Whig law officers appointed in 1806 to their chiefs less surprising. The burden of business irked the law officers in the 1790s and in 1798 they appealed to the prime minister to devise some means of easing it. Nothing came of this, but they were promoted in the following year. After 1812 none of the law officers distinguished himself, except John Singleton Copley, appointed in 1819 when an able spokesman was especially necessary. John Mitford was elected Speaker of the House in 1801, an office appropriated by lawyers, though neither his predecessor, Henry Addington, nor his successors, Charles Abbot and Charles Manners Sutton, had risen so high in their profession—and Mitford, as Speaker, never appeared to greater disadvantage.\n\nThe Prince of Wales’s law officers also sat in the House, with the exception of the two whose names are in square brackets:\n\nAttorney-general Solicitor-general Thomas Erskine1783-1792Arthur Leary Piggott[Robert Graham]1793-1800John Anstruther (to 1795)\n\nVicary GibbsVicary Gibbs1800-1805Thomas Manners Sutton (to 1802)\n\nWilliam AdamWilliam Adam1805-1806William GarrowWilliam Garrow1806-1812Joseph JekyllJoseph Jekyll1812-1816Samuel Shepherd (to 1813)\n\nWilliam Draper BestWilliam Draper Best1816-1819[William Harrison]Charles Warren1819-1820\n\nIt is noteworthy that the law officers of the crown appointed by the Grenville ministry in 1806 were the Prince’s law officers until 1792, when he dismissed them for their association with the Friends of the People. Indeed, his various law officers were reflections of the Prince’s political moods, and from 1802 his chancellors of the duchy of Cornwall (Thomas Erskine until 1806, William Adam until 1816, and John Leach until 1820) eclipsed them in the House. Three of Queen Charlotte’s law officers, George Hardinge, William Grant and Richard Richards also sat in the House, as well as Queen Caroline’s future law officers, Brougham and Denman, and Queen Adelaide’s, William Horne. Two Irish law officers, Plunket and John Stewart I, and three Irish lord chancellors, John Mitford, George Ponsonby and Thomas Manners Sutton were Members before, and in Ponsonby’s case after, holding that office: Ponsonby became leader of the opposition from 1808. Two Caribbean law officers, Robert Sewell and John Stanley, also sat, and another Member, William Frankland, became attorney-general of the Isle of Man. There were four King’s attorneys for the duchy of Lancaster, John Lee, Edward Law, James Topping and James Scarlett. Charles Marsh was King’s advocate in Madras before he entered the House.\n\nOver 50 barrister Members obtained judgeships at some stage in their careers. Two lord chief justices of King’s bench in this period, Lords Kenyon and Ellenborough, were former Members, as was a future one Thomas Denman, and one of the puisne judges, William Draper Best. The lord chief justices of common pleas from 1799 until 1804, John Scott, Richard Pepper Arden, and those from 1814 to 1829, Vicary Gibbs, Robert Dallas, Robert Gifford and William Draper Best had all been Members; Gibbs and Dallas had previously been puisne judges of the court. The chief barons of the Exchequer court from 1793 until 1814, Archibald Macdonald and Vicary Gibbs, and three subsequent ones, Richard Richards, John Singleton Copley and James Scarlett, had been Members; as were three puisne barons, Thomas Manners Sutton, George Wood and William Garrow. The judge advocate-general, legal spokesman for the armed forces, was usually a Member; witness Sir Charles Gould, Nathaniel Bond, Richard Ryder and Charles Manners Sutton in this period, and three in the future; and the judge advocate to the fleet, Sir George Jackson, was a Member. Welsh judgeships were a much-coveted consolation for barristers, as they were tenable with a seat in the House, despite opposition bids to disqualify them. Twenty-four Members were Welsh judges. Two Irish Members went on to become judges in Ireland. Ten Members had been or became Indian judges (John Anstruther, Anthony Buller, William Burroughs, Edward Hyde East, John Peter Grant, Elijah Impey, James Mackintosh, John Henry Newbolt, Robert Percy Smith and James Watson). These Indian judgeships were less sought after though they virtually guaranteed a fortune: James Watson did not survive the Indian heat more than a few days.\n\nThe consolation prizes for Scots advocates in the House were fewer. Three of them, John Anstruther, William Adam and John Peter Grant joined the English bar to their distinct advantage, while one scion of an eminent Scots legal family, William Dundas, did not even qualify as an advocate. Some advocates settled for shrievalties or legal sinecures, as the plums of the profession were unreachable. Until 1811, with one exception, Henry Dundas awarded the plums. His nephew Robert Dundas was lord advocate (equivalent to the English attorney-general) from 1789 until 1801, followed by his connexion by marriage, Charles Hope, until 1804, then by his adherent James Montgomery. In 1806 the Whigs restored Henry Erskine to an office he had held in 1783. Erskine was displaced in 1807 by Archibald Campbell Colquhoun, who was succeeded in 1816 by Alexander Maconochie. In 1819 William Rae became lord advocate when it was clear that Maconochie was incompetent to cope with Scottish measures in the House. The lord advocate’s deputy, styled the solicitor-general as in England, had not usually been a Member of the House but Henry Dundas had eventually become one; so had his nephew Robert, and, in this period, so did David Boyle and Alexander Maconochie. Scottish judgeships were also likely rewards for Members. Charles Hope, David Boyle and Alexander Maconochie became lords of session, Hope and Boyle becoming presidents. Boyle was also lord justice clerk and Campbell Colquhoun succeeded Lord Frederick Campbell as lord clerk register. Scottish Exchequer barons included Robert Dundas and (an Englishman) Samuel Shepherd, who were chief barons, and as puisne barons, Sir John Wishart Belsches, William Adam and (in the future) Sir Patrick Murray and James Abercromby. William Adam was appointed first chief commissioner of the Scottish jury court in 1815 following the assimilation of the Scots to the English mode of trial.\n\nTwelve civil lawyers sat in the House in this period, compared with eight from 1754-90. Two had first been called to the bar (William Scott and Stephen Lushington II) before becoming advocates at Doctors’ Commons. The others were Sir James Marriott, Scrope Bernard, French Laurence, Thomas Champion Crespigny, Sir John Nicholl, Patrick Duigenan, Joseph Phillimore, the Hon. William Herbert, Sir Christopher Robinson and John Dodson. These men practised in the Admiralty and ecclesiastical courts. Eight of them reached the top rank of their profession as judges and King’s advocates. There were also in the House three proctors at Doctors’ Commons, Stephen Lushington I, Charles Alexander Crickitt and James Farquhar.\n\nThe number of attorneys and solicitors (the latter practising in Chancery) who sat in the House in this period was 23, more than twice as many as from 1754-90. This was a rising profession for able and ambitious men of modest origins. Significantly their average age at entry into the House was nearly 49—more than 15 years older than the average. Attorneys had played an important part in electioneering during the 18th century, and their most prestigious clients were often parliamentary patrons. John Baynes Garforth and Francis Gregg were protégés of Lord Lonsdale, practising in London. Indeed 14 of the 23 elected to Parliament practised in the metropolis. James Graham, another Lonsdale protégé, was at the head of his profession, catering for an extensive aristocratic clientele, built up by his partner Thomas Wildman, a Member returned by his client William Beckford. Henry Smith, like Gregg a company solicitor, was returned by his client, the 2nd Marquess of Lansdowne. Evan Foulkes rose from nothing to be a fashionable solicitor, procurer of loans for his titled clients and borough-broker for Lord Exeter at Stamford, for which he came in. Gilbert Jones was the 4th Duke of Newcastle’s borough manager. Nathaniel Saxon did business for Sir William Manners, who returned him to Parliament. William Leake was Sir Christopher Hawkins’s nominee. James Kibblewhite rose a step higher in 1807 when he bribed his native borough of Wootton Bassett out of its allegiance to two fainéant grandees, and he was able to sell it in 1813 to Joseph Pitt, another borough-mongering attorney, practising at Cirencester, who also had brewing, land-jobbing and banking concerns. Pitt, a carpenter’s son, started as Lord Carnarvon’s steward and in 1811 purchased his interest at Cricklade, for which he was returned a year later. By then he had also purchased the Estcourt interest at Malmesbury, and named both Members there, as well as setting in train the Wootton Bassett negotiation. Pitt overreached himself and by 1820 had to limit his parliamentary ambitions. The same was true of another parvenu, John Edwards, who, at an opportune moment in 1818, sprang himself on the gentry of Glamorgan, where he had a marriage connexion. The gentry snubbed him at the next opportunity. Benjamin Cooke Griffinhoofe, stopgap Member for Yarmouth (I.o.W.), was linked by marriage with the patron. Robert Blake, a well-connected opportunist, snatched a seat at a by-election in 1819 from the Duke of Norfolk. Richard Wilson II was most remarkable for his Whig politics and life-style, but he started as an agent of the Duke of Northumberland.\n\nThe nine provincial attorneys were John Pitt, a veteran from Gloucester who had bought up as much as he could of the city; Thomas Williams, a Welsh solicitor who turned to a more lucrative business in copper mining; Richard Preston of Ashburton and George Tennyson of Grimsby, both of whom nursed their boroughs, as did Joseph Pitt of Cirencester, who cultivated other professions—and other boroughs; William Roscoe of Liverpool who graduated to scholarship and banking before entering the House; Thomas Claughton of Warrington, an ambitious land-jobber, who eventually came to grief; Lewis Allsopp of Nottingham, an adept at municipal politics, who briefly held a Cornish seat; and Daniel Whittle Harvey, the Essex radical.\n\nOf the attorney Members, Richard Preston succeeded in being called to the bar. James Kibblewhite and Daniel Whittle Harvey attempted it, but were frustrated. Richard Wilson II was principal secretary to the lord chancellor for six years and resigned with a sinecure. Only three or four of these men were of the second generation in their profession. A number of other Members were at one time articled to attorneys, but never qualified. Robert Gifford did so but failed to find a partner and became a barrister; William Garrow, articled to an attorney, also read for the bar instead. There were two Scots writers to the signet in the House, Andrew Stuart and Masterton Ure. The latter was agent to the Johnstone family for Weymouth and Melcombe Regis.\n\nAmong other non-military professions represented in the House, the medical was facile princeps. Nathaniel Dimsdale, John Fleming, William Grieve, Humphrey Howorth, Joseph Hume, John Kingston, James Mackintosh, John Matthews and William Morland had been surgeons or physicians. Their profession was on everybody’s lips during Addington’s administration, when he was labelled ‘The Doctor’: his father had treated the King, and his own function was supposed to be curative. Opposition embroidery on this metaphor produced some of the best political jokes of the period: ‘medical aid’ took on a new meaning. Half-a-dozen Members, apart from the attorneys previously mentioned, were hommes d’affaires to their parliamentary patrons. The most notable and varied examples were Thomas Gilbert (to the Marquess of Stafford), Robert Haldane Bradshaw (to the Duke of Bridgwater), James Edward May (to the Marquess of Donegall), Richard Burke (to Earl Fitzwilliam), James Abercromby (to the Duke of Devonshire), and, to some extent, William Adam (to the Duke of Bedford). There were several stockbrokers, pharmacists, printers and stationers. Several Members had been collectors of customs and excise—more consoled themselves in that way on giving up Parliament. John Palmer was the embodiment of the Post Office in his day. Several Members went on to obtain academic posts. There were two theatre managers, Sheridan and ‘Opera’ ‘Taylor: John Palmer also doubled in this role. The playwrights included Sheridan, Joseph Richardson, Miles Peter Andrews, Richard Paul Jodrell and Matthew Gregory Lewis. Authors proliferated from the sublime (Edmund Burke) to the ridiculous (the palm might be awarded to several Members, but Charles Small Pybus, Sir Isaac Coffin and Nathaniel Brassey Halhed are strong contenders). David Ricardo was the most reputable of a number of Members who published economic theories. Pamphlets written by Members defy calculation, as do the number of speeches in the House that they published and articles for newspapers and periodicals that they contributed. Nathaniel Wraxall was the historian of his own time, as, with a parti pris, was John Nicholls; William Mitford chronicled Greece, Henry Bankes, Rome; Malcolm Laing, Scotland. As topics, antiquities attracted several Members, and travelling experiences others. Richard Payne Knight wrote on aesthetics and Henry Gally Knight on architecture, as did Sir James Hall, better known as geologist and chemist. Philology was the forte of John Horne Tooke, who made it the basis of his radical politics. The interests of the Romantic movement in literature were espoused by James Macpherson, William Beckford, Matthew Gregory Lewis and William Herbert. Thomas Johnes translated and published Froissart. Nor was the House short of occasional poets. John Wilson Croker was a literary critic. Sportsmanship was little short of a profession among some country gentlemen, notably George Osbaldeston and Thomas William Coke II. Amateur scientists and inventors included William Elford, William Congreve, and Arthur Howe Holdsworth. Patronage of the arts was widespread among Members and ranged from connoisseur collections (Richard Hart Davis, Charles Long and Richard Viscount Fitzwilliam) to coin and fossil cabinets. There was one former professional artist of repute, Nathaniel Dance; there were several noted amateur artists, Sir George Howland Beaumont, William Elford and Robert Frankland; cartoonists, such as Heneage Legge and Thomas Orde; and a professional architect, Charles Wyatt. Richard Edgcumbe, Viscount Valletort, and John Fane, Lord Burghersh, both composed operas, the latter founding the Royal Academy of Music.\n\nARMY OFFICERS\n\nBritain was at war for most of this period, and just over 400 Members (nearly one-fifth) had at some stage served in the regular army. Of these, 86 were first elected before 1790. In all, 51 were veterans who had joined before the end of the Seven Years’ War in 1763. Thirty of these were still in the service, and of course among the top ranking officers. They included such distinguished figures as Sir Ralph Abercromby, Sir Archibald Campbell, Sir Henry Clinton, Sir George Howard (who had enlisted as long ago as 1725), Gerard Lake, Hector Munro, Charles Rainsford, Sir James Steuart Denham, John Vaughan I, and the Hon. Thomas Maitland, who has to be included, although he was enlisted from the cradle in 1760. Between 1763 and the outbreak of the war of American Independence in 1775, another 49 of our Members joined the service, and of these 25 were still serving while in the House. The most distinguished were the Hon. Thomas Bruce, Sir John Doyle, John Hely Hutchinson, William Loftus, Sir James Murray, George Nugent, Sir Thomas Picton, John Graves Simcoe, and the Hon. Charles Stuart.\n\nThe era of the American war (1775-83) added another 95 soldiers to our Membership, of whom 57 were still in the service when elected to the House in this period. These included Sir John Abercromby, Duncan Campbell, Sir Eyre Coote, the brothers Charles and Robert Craufurd, Viscount Feilding, the Hon. Edward Finch, Lord Charles Fitzroy I, William Fullarton, Isaac Gascoyne, George Vaughan Hart, Lord Herbert, Sir Charles Lockhart Ross, Alexander Mackenzie, John Randoll Mackenzie, Norman Macleod, Robert Manners, William Monson, the Hons. Edmund and Henry Phipps, Sir James St. Clair Erskine, John Hayes St. Leger, Sir Brent Spencer, Banastre Tarleton, and the Hon. George Walpole, to name only the more celebrated among them. Another 70 Members joined the army between 1784 and 1792, years of peace except in India, and 46 of these were still serving when elected to the House. They included George Anson, Sir William Carr Beresford, Lord Blayney, Lord William Henry Cavendish Bentinck, the brothers Henry and William Clinton, Galbraith Lowry Cole, Stapleton Cotton, Sir William Erskine, Henry Fane, Ronald Craufurd Ferguson, Sir Rowland Hill, the brothers Alexander, Charles and John Hope, Charles Lennox, the brothers Mahon, the brothers Mathew, John Murray, Edward Paget, William Ponsonby, William Henry Pringle, Lord Charles Somerset, the Hon. William Stewart, Michael Symes (formerly in the East India Company army), and not least Sir Arthur Wellesley.\n\nIn the French revolutionary and Napoleonic wars (1793-1815) there were 135 recruits to the army among Members. Thirteen of them were already in the House when they were granted their commissions, and three were volunteers for one campaign only. Of the 135, 96 were still serving when elected to the House. Among so many the most distinguished perhaps were Alexander Abercromby, the Hon.

Six Members joined the army between 1815 and 1824, four of them already having been elected Members.\n\nThus 256 Members were serving in the army when elected to the House, though a few of them left it within a year or two of their election. Four in every ten never saw active service out of the country during their Membership; if they were elected after 1815, they had little opportunity to do so. For a majority of military Members, however, assiduous Membership was impossible, either because they served abroad or because of their professional duties at home. Until the Peninsular war, the theatre of service which most of them had in common over the years was Ireland, and in this period the Irish rebellion of 1798 involved dozens of Members, Irish and British, including the militia officers sent over to assist in its suppression. Over 40 Members had served in North America before 1783, several of them in two wars, and a dozen others served in Canada in this period, some of them participating in the Anglo-American war of 1812-14. About 70 Members saw service on the Continent soon after the outbreak of war with revolutionary France, notably in the Flanders campaign, in Holland and Germany, or in the occupation of Toulon. Thirty Members took part in the expedition to Holland in 1799, and 25 in the Egyptian expedition a year later. Sixteen Members served in the Walcheren expedition in 1809, and about the same number in Sicily, either in 1806 or 1811. About a dozen served in the Baltic, and at least four in South America. But it was the Peninsular war (1807-14) that drew the largest number of Members, not far short of 100 of them at some stage, and 25 participated in the triumph of Waterloo. More distant service took some 40 Members to the West Indies, only slightly fewer to India, and others to the Cape of Good Hope.\n\nMilitary Members risked death, disease, mutilation or capture. Sir Ralph Abercromby died of the wound he received in command during the battle of Alexandria in 1801; two years before, Alexander Telfer Smollett had been killed at Alkmaar. Edward Charles Cocks, Robert Craufurd, John Randoll Mackenzie and Sir Henry Sullivan were killed in the Peninsular war, while George Henry Compton Cavendish was drowned on his way home from it, and Si"
