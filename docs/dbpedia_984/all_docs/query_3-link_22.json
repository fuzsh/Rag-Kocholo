Since 2002 I have been director of the Kilteasheen Archaeological Project, one of the largest ongoing archaeological surveys and excavations in Ireland. Kilteasheen is a high status Gaelic ecclesiastical enclosure that includes a cemetery, thirteenth century hall house, and an elaborate medieval field system. I also conduct research a number of other fields, including the historical theology of the later medieval Gaelic church, thirteenth century bardic poetry, the history of the O Conor and Mac Dermot families of Roscommon, and landscape history of north Roscommon.\n\nSince 2008 I have been an invited delegate of the Chateau Gaillard International Castle Studies Conference. I attended the 2008 conference in Stirling, Scotland, the 2010 the conference in Rindern, Germany, a 2012 conference in Denmark, a 2016 conference in Roscommon, Ireland, and an upcoming conference in Goldegg, Austria.
