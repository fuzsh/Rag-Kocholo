BATH The Hot Springs of Bath, rising at a natural tem- perature of 120°, rich in radium emanation, have never been in greater demand nor more appreciated than they are to-day. Wounded soldiers and invalided civilians alike are finding renewed health and strength in the Bath treatment. The waters are administered at the extensive Bathing Establishment by every means that science can devise for the balneotherapeutic treatment of disease. Rheumatism and Neuritis and \" Nerve Shock \" are but a few of the complaints successfully treated here. Bright, cheerful, restful surroundings and good music help the invalid to regain health, and provide for the pleasure and entertainment of those who come to Bath only for a rest and change. The Roman Baths of Bath, still standing in wonder- ful preservation, are amongst the finest Roman antiquities in Europe. No place in Britain is richer in beautiful buildings and historic houses of the XVIII century. To many visitors the architectural beauty and his- torical associations of the city appeal very strongly, while others are attracted by the delightful walks and excursions all around. There are first-class concerts at the Pump Room every day, frequent special performances, and good companies at the Theatres. \"For 2000 Years\" is the title of a recently published booklet giving particulars about the Hot Springs of Bath, which will be sent post free, together with Hotel and Apartment List and other information, on application to — John Hatton, Director, The Springs, Bath.

The alterations in personnel will be found in full detail under * CHANGES SINCE GENERAL Election, Dec. 1910,\" on pages vii to xxviii. These show JJ that during the present Parliament the unusual number of 220 Bye-Elections have taken place, resulting in the return of 180 new Members. 101 Members have resigned their Seats, or vacated same by reason either of appointment to Offices of profit under the Crown or on elevation to or succession to Peerages. 79 Members have died, 29 have been raised to the Peerage, 76 have 'been sworn of the Privy Council, 47 have been added to the Roll of Baronets, 58 have received the honour of Knighthood, 1 the Order of Merit, 2 have been nominated Companions of Honour and 38 Companions of the Orders of Knighthood* 1 Member was disqualified, being subsequently re-elected, and there have been 1 1 successions to Peerages and 4 to Baronetcies, while at the time of going to press there are not any seats vacant. It is curious to note that although the present Parliament was rtself elected under the provisions of the Septennial Act of 1716, and by the Parliament Act of 191 1 reduced its life and that of subse- quent Parliaments to five years, nevertheless by the irony _ of fate it has on more than one occasion extended that period until it has now lasted even longer than would have been the case under the old regime, if it had come to an end merely by effluxion of time. The next General Klection, it is more than probable, will be held 00 the New Register under the extended Franchise enacted by the Representation of the People Act, passed on the last day ^ of the last Session (February 6th, 1918), which provides for A* °rm the enfranchisement of women over 30 years of age, and for the taking of votes of persons in Naval and Military employment, thus adding some 8,000,000 voters (2,000,000 men and 6,000,000 women) to the Register, which in future is to be revised half-yearly. A list of the Constituencies showing the Redistribution of Seats under the new Act is given in alphabetical order bu'fi^* \"f on pages 506 to 510, and shows that the number of Members a#a|g of Parliament for the United Kingdom will in future be 707 in place of 670 as heretofore, their distribution among Counties, vi Preface, Boroughs, and Universities being set out under \" Constitution of the House of Commons \" on p. 1, while the essential provisions of the measure are indicated among \" Explanations of Technical Parliamentary Expressions, etc.\", pages xxxv to xlix. Of the yj additional Seats, 33 are apportioned to England and Wales, 2 to Scotland, and 2 to Ireland. Some additional M.P.'s have during the past twelve months been killed while on active service, the number now reaching 13; their , names will be found recorded in the Obituary on page xxiv. ar s There have also been further casualties reported among the Official Staffs of both Houses of the Legislature, while a number of Members have received Honours in connection with the war. Several new Ministerial Offices have been constituted during the past year, and although the War Cabinet itself, owing to Sir Edward Carson's recent resignation, now again only numbers 5, the size . of the full Ministry has, under war conditions, swollen to abnormal proportions, many of the Ministries also now being provided with two Parliamentary Secretaries. Reform of the House of Lords is again in the air, but at the moment of writing all eyes are turned towards the Convention sitting \"s in Dublin and charged with the task of trying to find a onven ion. sojutjon t0 t^e jrjsjj proDlem. The return of Sinn Fein Members of Parliament for certain Irish Constituencies adds a novel element to Parliamentary life, l?ovc as none of these Members has yet taken the oath or his Element. „, tt seat in the House. \"Debrett's House of Commons and the Judicial Bench\" is divided into two main sections : the first forms a complete Parlia- mentary Guide, with biographies of M.P.'s, all Pollings at Scope of the ]ast twQ Generai and an subsequent Bye-Elections, list * e °r \" of Privy Councillors, abridged Peerage, and detailed Ex- planation of Technical Parliamentary Expressions, while the second portion is devoted to Judges of the High Court and of the County Courts, Recorders, Sheriffs, Sheriff-Substitutes, Metropolitan and Sti- pendiary Magistrates, Judges of the Dominions and Colonies, etc., etc. Arthur G.
