        "text": "We had a fabulous trip to Ireland 2/16/23-2/26/23. It would be difficult to tell you favorite accommodations as all were outstanding. There is not a negative thing to say about Harvey’s Point. Our room had been upgraded and was the largest room I have ever seen. We had 2 bathrooms. We did not have a view as they were all Kings and Cynthia and I required 2 beds. Every amenity you could think of was in the room. Every employee went out of the way to help in every way. The food was delicious and service over the top.\n\nAshford was next and Catherine, who is Manager in Rooms Division upgraded Cynthia and me to a gorgeous room with fireplace, etc. it was the same room we had in 2006. The other rooms were not so nice and very small and one couple said they would not go back to Ashford. She said they had nothing in their room, not even a minibar. If we go back, I would request upgraded rooms for all. One guest said the room sets the stage for your impression of the castle.\n\nAdare Manor was next and I had requested corner rooms for all and no one got them. However all in my group got very nice large rooms that they loved except Cynthia and me. Our room was exactly half as large as the rest of the group. I asked for a different room and the manager kept me waiting for a full 30 minutes and then told me there wasn’t another room. The girl at front desk said they were about 70% occupied. Nothing was done for me until Rebecca called Kevin who was MOD and that got the ball rolling. I guess it was ok since we got the preferred room at Ashford.\n\nAdare was, I think preferred over Ashford with my group. We would not want the tasting menu again however. I realize that is the only choice in the Oak Room but it lasted from 8:00-12:00 and we were all exhausted. They were very slow with long waits between courses. Possible that they didn’t have enough servers especially at first.\n\nTransportation was perfect and we all loved Jerry. No problems at all. He went out of his way to make us comfortable and to please us in every way.\n\nIt was great to get to meet Gary at the Merrian Hotel. Everyone’s rooms were ready except mine and they suggested we have tea while we waited and that’s where Gary and I met. I appreciated such nice gifts from him and enjoyed our visit very much. We love the hotel and MOD was very kind to us.\n\nThis was an excellent trip, one of our very best and could be the very best. There was a huge amount of planning that went into it and it paid off. If you need to know anything specific please don’t hesitate to ask.\n\nMy hats off to the staff at Sheenco!"
