        "text": "I am really looking forward to this event next week, both personally and professionally. It marks the culmination of a lot of hard work, long nights and lost weekends. I began this work many years ago during my PhD work at University College Dublin. Following several years of part-time work in research and teaching roles, grant applications and babies, I won an Irish Research Council Postdoctoral Fellowship in 2019 to undertake the process of converting that research into a book in University College Cork. Then in March 2020, everything stopped... It took the better part of three more years to recover the momentum and finish this book, balancing new research commitments, family and work for IAC Archaeology on the Drumclay Crannog Post-Excavation Project along the way. I am thrilled that Stephen Harrison will be joining me to help launch the volume and huge thanks to Hodges Figgis for their assistance and welcoming us with open arms. If you are in Dublin, please do come along and join us to celebrate this journey. If you'd like to, you can register your interest in attending at Eventbrite (for catering purposes!) Book Launch: Exploring Ireland's Viking-Age Towns: Houses and Homes by Rebecca Boyd Date: Fri, Apr 5 • 6:00 PM IST Location: 56-58 Dawson Street, D02 XE81 Dublin 2 https://lnkd.in/ekbFMPpW\n\nI am delighted to be hosting a panel discussion and book launch with Dr Sarah Kerr of University College CorkCork's Archaeology Dept amd Radical Humanities Laboratory and Dr Karen Dempsey of Cardiff University / Prifysgol Caerdydd next Thursday evening in UCC. Sarah's book \"Late Medieval Lodging Ranges The Architecture of Identity, Power and Space\" is published by Boydell and Brewer. Sarah says that while we know a great deal about most elements of the late medieval great house, we understand very little about their lodging ranges, and even less on their contributions to the lived experience of the household and wider society. Why were lodging ranges built, for example, and how were they used? Sarah's analysis draws on archaeological and architectural analysis of lodging ranges to show that they were some of the finest living spaces within the great house. She argues that their very form and stones, and their manipulation of space, enabled them to have multi-faceted functions, including the representation of multiple and even conflicting identities. Rebecca's book \"Exploring Ireland's Viking-Age Towns: Houses and Homes\" is published by Routledge History, Heritage Studies and Archaeology Rebecca's work discusses the emergence of towns, urban lifestyles, and urban identities in Ireland. She uses household archaeology as a lens to explore the materiality, variability, and day-to-day experiences of living in these houses. It moves from the intimate scale of individual households to the larger scale of Ireland’s earliest urban communities. For the first time, this book considers how these houses were more than just buildings: they were homes, important places where people lived, worked, and died. Her analysis is structured in three parts: an investigation of the houses, the households, and the town. Exploring Ireland’s Viking-Age Towns discusses how these new urban households managed their homes to create a sense of place and belonging in these new environments and allow themselves to develop a new, urban identity. Sarah and Rebecca will join Karen in a panel discussion on the role of architecture in understanding our medieval past, and the importance of detail in analysing that past. This promises to be a fascinating discussion, and we are looking forward to the evening. We are also hosting a Zoom Room for the event, please DM for details if you would like to attend virtually."
