Thomas Ashe was born in Kerry and was an active member of both the Irish Volunteers and the Gaelic League. He was the leader of the North County Dublin Volunteers during the Rising during which they captured four barracks and a large quantity of arms and ammunition when they engaged with the Royal Irish Constabulary in Ashbourne. He was sentenced to death but the sentence was commuted to penal servitude for life. He was released from jail in 1917. Later that year, he was once again arrested and sentenced to a year’s hard labour at Mountjoy Prison.\n\nHe demanded, along with other Republicans in the jail, to be treated as a prisoner of war. When these demands were refused, the prisoners went on hunger strike. Thomas Ashe died on 25 September, 1917, as a result of incorrectly administered forcible feeding. An account of how Ashe was treated and died is recorded the in Witness Statement of Patrick Berry, a member of Mounty Prison Staff, see pages 5 and 6 below.\n\nhttp://www.census.nationalarchives.ie/pages/1911/Dublin/Lusk/Corduff__Hackett_/2101/\n\nhttp://www.census.nationalarchives.ie/reels/nai000007214/\n\nBureau of Military History Witness Statement: Patrick Joseph Berry, Member of Mountjoy Prison staff\n\nhttp://www.bureauofmilitaryhistory.ie/reels/bmh/BMH.WS0942.pdf\n\nFrancis Bacon\n\nAged 1 year at the time of Census 1911\n\nAddress: 3, Kennycourt (Gilltown, Kildare)\n\nThe Census 1911 return for the Bacon household at 3, Kennycourt, Gilltown, Co.

This stand-off continued for a week until a negotiated agreement led to the surrender of the volunteers’ arms to the Lord Mayor of Cork, Thomas Butterfield.\n\nThe rifles were to be locked in the Lord Mayor's safe or strong room and returned after the Rising.\n\nThis agreement was signed by the Bishop of Cork Daniel Coholan, the Lord Mayor and the British representative. A few hours after the Volunteers had deposited their rifles, the City Hall was raided by the British Army and all the rifles confiscated. At the same time another party led by the R.I.C. arrested all the Volunteer officers.

He smuggled guns to Ireland in his sailing yacht The Asgard in 1914. He was executed by the authorities of the Irish Free State during the Irish Civil War. He was the son of scholar Robert Caesar Childers and Anna Mary Henrietta, née Barton, from an Anglo-Irish landowning family of Glendalough House, Annamoe, County Wicklow and he was the father of the fourth President of Ireland, Erskine Hamilton Childers. While we do not have a Census report for Erskine Childers who was located in London, we do have one for the Barton family in Glendalough.\n\nAddress: 23, Drummin (Glendalough, Wicklow)\n\nThe Census 1911 return for the Barton family includes the head of the family, Agnes A.T.

This stand-off continued for a week until an agreement, negotiated by the Bishop of Cork and the Lord Mayor of Cork Thomas Butterfield, led to the surrender of the volunteers’ arms to the Lord Mayor of Cork. It was agreed that the rifles were to be locked in the Lord Mayor's safe or strong room and returned after the Rising.\n\nThis agreement was signed by the Bishop of Cork, the Lord Mayor and the British representative.

Kildare, a dock porter who is married to Mary (50) from Co. Dublin. They have four daughters, Mary (30) a housemaid, Gertie (20) a printing machinist, Ellen (19) a book keeper and Veronica (8) is at school. There are five sons, Joseph (18) a messenger, George (16), Edward (15), Matthew (12). There is also a son John (Seán) (29) married for one year to Christina (22) and both are boarders in the house. There is another boarder living in the house, a nephew Richard Byrne (50), who was a commercial clerk from Co. Lough. The only two people in the household not proficient in Irish are Mary Connolly and her daughter Mary.\n\nSeán Connolly, an ICA officer and Abbey Theatre actor, was both the first rebel to kill a British soldier and the first to be killed. Connolly's father was a sailor, who was later employed on the docks. The family moved to the north inner city district of Dublin shortly after Seán's birth. At school he became a fluent Irish speaker and took a great interest in history. When he left school, he began working for Eason's in Middle Abbey Street as a dispatch clerk, moving from there to become a junior clerk in Dublin Corporation, becoming in time a senior officer in the Motor Licence Department in City Hall.\n\nOnly a week before the rising, Seán Connolly was playing the lead role in James Connolly's new play 'Under Which Flag' in its first performance at Liberty Hall by the Abbey Theatre company. The play was about an Irishman torn between serving in the Irish or the British army, and ended with Connolly raising a green flag and uttering the words 'Under this flag only will I serve. Under this flag, if need be, will I die.'\n\nDuring the Rising, Connolly was under the command of Michael Mallin in St. Stephen’s Green. Connolly's men moved from there to take up a position at City Hall. The objective of the group was to enter Dublin City Hall and keep the British army under fire as long as possible. Connolly had a key to City Hall as he worked there in the motor tax office located in the building. When they reached Dublin City Hall he ordered two men to secure the sentries at the gates of Dublin Castle which would allow him and his men time to enter the City Hall. It was at this time the castle guard James O’Brien was killed. Connolly was shot first in the hand but the second shot he received proved fatal. Also serving at the same post was his sister Katie who was nursing the wounded and his brother Michael. An account of the fighting can be read in Matthew Connolly’s Witness Statement included below.\n\nhttp://www.census.nationalarchives.ie/pages/1911/Dublin/North_Dock/Gloucester_Street__Lower/14854/\n\nhttp://www.census.nationalarchives.ie/reels/nai000048089/\n\nBureau of Military History Witness Statement: Matthew Connolly\n\nhttp://www.bureauofmilitaryhistory.ie/reels/bmh/BMH.WS1746.pdf\n\nSinéad de Valera\n\nAged 22 at the time of Census 1901\n\nAddress: 6, Richmond Cottages (Mountjoy, Dublin)\n\nThe Census 1901 return for the Flanagan household at 6 Richmond Cottages, Mountjoy, Dublin, included Jane, a 22 year old national teacher.

She died in 1949 and is buried in Glasnevin Cemetery.\n\nhttp://www.census.nationalarchives.ie/pages/1911/Dublin/Inns_Quay/Auburn_Street/33590/\n\nhttp://www.census.nationalarchives.ie/reels/nai000081064/\n\nJames Larkin\n\nAged 31 at the time of Census 1911\n\nAddress: 27, Auburn Street (Inns Quay, Dublin)\n\nThis is the Census 1911 return for the Larkin household in Broadstone, Dublin. The return was completed in Irish and both James and his wife Elizabeth, (Séaumus and Eilis) were aged 31. There were three children recorded, James Junior (Séaumus), aged 6, Denis (Donnachadh), aged 2 and Fintan Lawlor (Fintán Lalor), aged 1. His sister Delia (Bridhe) was aged 29.\n\nJames Larkin was an Irish trade union leader and socialist activist, born to impoverished Irish parents in Liverpool. He married Elizabeth Browne in 1903 and they had four sons. He moved to Belfast in 1907 where he organised a successful dock workers strike, with other workers such as coalmen joining in. In 1908 he moved to Dublin and formed the Irish Transport and General Workers Union. The union was formed to protect the rights of workers such as dock workers, labourers and factory workers who lived in incredibly poor conditions in the slums and tenements in Dublin. In 1910 he was accused of embezzlement of funds and imprisoned but was pardoned and released pending an appeal to the Lord Lieutenant of Ireland, the Earl of Aberdeen. In 1911 he established the newspaper “The Irish Worker and People’s Advocate” and in 1912 he helped form the Irish Labour Party with James Connolly.\n\nLarkin is best known for his involvement in the 1913 Lock-Out. It was the worst industrial dispute in Irish history. The employers (of Guinness, Jacobs and other factories), led by William Martin Murphy, a rich industrialist and owner of Irish Independent Newspaper and other newspapers, engaged in a lock-out of workers if they refused to sign a pledge not to become a member of a union and to strike. Notable people such as Pearse and Countess Markievicz supported the workers. Over the eight months of the dispute the workers were reduced to near starvation. The Lock-Out ended in 1914 when Larkin and Connolly unsuccessfully looked for support from other British Unions.\n\nAfter the Lock-Out Larkin went to America but his support for Communism and his anti-war stance led to him being arrested in 1920 and sent to Sing Sing Prison for up to ten years. He was pardoned in 1923 and returned to Ireland. With his brother Peter he founded the Workers Union of Ireland. James Larkin and his two sons, James Junior and Denis, served as members of the Oireachtas for the Labour Party. His son Denis was also Lord Mayor of Dublin 1955-1956.\n\nHe died in 1943 and is buried in Glasnevin Cemetery. A large statue in his honour stands on O’Connell Street.\n\nhttp://www.census.nationalarchives.ie/pages/1911/Dublin/Inns_Quay/Auburn_Street/33590/\n\nhttp://www.census.nationalarchives.ie/reels/nai000081064/\n\nSeán Francis Lemass\n\nAged 11 at the time of the Census 1911\n\nAddress: 2, Capel St. (North City, Dublin)\n\nThe Census 1911 return for the Lemass family showed the head of the family as John (43), from Dublin City, who was a mines-outfitter and who was married for 14 years to Frances (39) from Co. Dublin, They had three sons, Noel (13), John (11) and Patrick (4) and three daughters, Alice (10), Clare (7) and May (1). There was one domestic servant recorded, Elizabeth Kelly (19) from Co. Dublin. Everyone in the household was Roman Catholic. Noel and John were the only people in the household proficient in Irish and English.\n\nLemass joined the Volunteers at the age of 15 and was appointed as Eamon de Valera’s personal aide. Both Sean and his older brother Noel took part in the Rising. On Easter Monday, thinking that the Rising was cancelled, they were out walking in the Dublin mountains when they learned about the Rising from the sons of Eoin MacNeill. The next morning without a word to their parents they headed off to take part and Noel was sent to the Imperial Hotel where he was equipped with a shotgun and sent to the roof of the GPO where he stayed for most of the week. With the evacuation of the GPO he was one of many who assisted in carrying Connolly’s stretcher to Moore Lane. He witnessed the deaths of many of the Volunteers who died during The O’Rahilly’s charge and also the deaths of men, women and children who were killed trying to leave their homes. Following the Rising, Seán Lemass stayed in the Volunteers and was involved in the War of Independence and was anti-Treaty during the Civil War.\n\nThree of Lemass's brothers died while young. When he was 16, Seán Lemass killed his own baby brother, Herbert, aged twenty-two months, in a domestic shooting accident with a revolver on 28 January 1916. His older brother, Noel, an anti-Treaty officer, was abducted in June 1923 and murdered the following October when he was 25. Another of Lemass's brothers, Patrick, died of natural causes at the age of 19 in 1926.\n\nLemass was first elected as a Sinn Féin Teachta Dála (TD) for the Dublin South constituency in a by-election in 1924 and was returned at each election until the constituency was abolished in 1948, when he was re-elected for Dublin South–Central until his retirement in 1969. He was a founder-member of Fianna Fáil in 1926, and served as Minister for Industry and Commerce, Minister for Supplies and Tánaiste in successive Fianna Fáil governments.\n\nhttp://www.census.nationalarchives.ie/pages/1911/Dublin/North_City/Capel_St_/36300/\n\nhttp://www.census.nationalarchives.ie/reels/nai000085575/\n\nMichael Logue, Cardinal and Primate of All Ireland, Archbishop of Armagh\n\nAged 70 at the time of Census 1911\n\nAddress: 1, Cathedral Hill (Armagh North Urban, Armagh)\n\nThe Census 1911 return shows the head of household was Michael Logue (70), Cardinal and Primate of all Ireland, Archbishop of Armagh, who was originally from Donegal.

He supported Home Rule and later the Anglo-Irish Treaty in 1921. Logue maintained an attitude loyal to the British Crown during the First World War. On 19 June 1917, when numbers of the younger clergy were beginning to take part in the Sinn Féin agitation he warned the clergy against belonging to \"dangerous associations\" and reminded priests that it was strictly forbidden by the statutes of the National Synod to speak of political or kindred affairs in the church. He did however speak out against conscription in 1918. He died in 1924.\n\nhttp://www.census.nationalarchives.ie/pages/1911/Armagh/Armagh_North_Urban/Cathedral_Hill/324288/\n\nhttp://www.census.nationalarchives.ie/reels/nai001622052/\n\nTomás MacCurtáin\n\nAged 17 at the time of Census 1901\n\nAddress: 60, Great Britain Street (Cork Urban No. 4, Cork)\n\nThe 1901 Census return for the Curtin family\n\nThe 1901 Census return recorded the head of the family as John Curtin (21) an insurance agent. Also in the household were his sister Mary (18), a housekeeper, and Thomas (17), a clerk in the Steam Packet Company. There was also a boarder Hannah Murphy (24) who was a dressmaker. All members of the household were Catholic and from Cork City.\n\nTomás Mac Curtáin was born at Ballyknockane townland in the Parish of Mourne Abbey in March 1884. He attended Burnfort National School. In 1897 Thomas moved to Blackpool in the northside of Cork City to live with his brother John and sister Mary where he attended The North Monastery School. MacCurtain became active in numerous cultural and political movements from the turn of the nineteenth century when he joined the Blackpool, Cork branch of Conradh na Gaeilge (the Gaelic League), becoming its secretary in 1902. He had diverse interests in music, poetry, Irish history and archeology. After Thomas left school he worked as a clerk for the City of Cork Steam Packet Company.\n\nhttp://www.census.nationalarchives.ie/pages/1901/Cork/Cork_Urban_No__4/Great_Britain_Street/1104200/\n\nhttp://www.census.nationalarchives.ie/reels/nai000515216/\n\nIn 1907 MacCurtáin secured work at Marks Mills in Crosses and in his free time he gave Irish lessons. In 1911 he joined the Fianna Eireann and was a founding member of the Irish Volunteers. He met Eilish Walsh (Eibhlís Breathnach) at a Gaelic League meeting and they married in 1908. They had six children, five of whom survived into adulthood. The family lived over number 40 Thomas Davis Street where Tomás had a small clothing and rainwear factory. (now the premises is called The Pantry and it is a Subway takeaway. There is a plaque to commemorate MacCurtain on the Upper Story).\n\nMacCurtáin was in command of the Irish Volunteers in Cork during the 1916 Rising. From the volunteers headquarters in Sheare’s Street in the city, MacCurtáin and his officers waited for orders from the volunteer leadership in Dublin. Telegram boys were intercepted and relieved of any messages for British Amy officers in Cork barracks. One of the telegrams gave news of the Rising in Dublin. This was the first information that the volunteers had that the Rising had taken place. The information came through London via Rosslare to the Cork General Post Office. With conflicting instructions, confusion prevailed and a stand-off developed between the Cork Volunteers and the British forces who surrounded the volunteer hall and this continued for a week until a negotiated agreement led to the surrender of the volunteers’ arms to the Lord Mayor of Cork, Thomas Butterfield. Though no rising took place in Cork, MacCurtáin was arrested and imprisoned in Frongoch in Wales. Tomás MacCurtáin took an active role in the War of Independence becoming Commandant of the Irish Republican Army. Following Sinn Féin’s victory in the local elections of January 1920, MacCurtáin was elected Lord Mayor of Cork, the first Republican to take office. He began a process of political reform within the city, making changes to the way in which the council operated and was run. On the morning of 20th March 1920 members of the RIC and the military, with fixed bayonets, forced their way into his house and shot him dead. It was thought that the murder was a reprisal for the shooting of Constable Murtagh at Pope’s Quay on the 19thMarch. One of the last acts of MacCurtáin was to phone the North Infirmary Hospital to make enquiries about Constable Murtagh and to offer his sympathies. Also present at the house were Mrs. MacCurtáin, her 5 children and her brother James Walsh, her three sisters, two nieces and a nephew plus her elderly mother. The brutal murder brought universal condemnation. A jury passed a verdict of wilful murder against the inspectors of the RIC, one of whom, District Inspector Oswald Swanzy, was subsequently shot dead in Lisburn in August 1920.\n\nCensus 1911 return for Inspector Oswald Swanzy Address: 9, Athy Street (Carlow Urban, Carlow)\n\nThe head of the household was Oswald Ross Swanzy (29).

The street previously known as King Street was renamed MacCurtain Street.\n\nMacCurtáin and his wife had six children, five of whom survived into adulthood. Tomás MacCurtáin's son Tomás Óg later became a leading republican and member of the IRA. In January 1940, he was sentanced to death by the de Valera government for mortally wounding Garda John Roache at the end of St. Patrick Steet on the 3rd of January 1940. Garda Roache had been following him for weeks and following a confrontation, he was shot. Tomás was granted clemancy due to the fact that his father had been killed by the British Army.

He was one of the founders of the Cork Brigade of the Irish Volunteers in 1913 and was President of the Cork branch of Sinn Féin. He was intended to be second in command to Tomás MacCurtáin of the Cork and Kerry forces during the Easter Rising. A force of up to 1,000 men of the Irish Volunteers assembled at various locations around County Cork. From the volunteers headquarters at Sheares Street in the city, MacCurtáin, MacSwiney and officers awaited orders from the volunteer leadership in Dublin but as a result of Eoin MacNeill’s countermanding orders the Cork volunteers never entered the Rising. A stand-off developed when British forces surrounded the volunteer hall and this continued for a week until a negotiated agreement led to the surrender of the volunteers' arms to the then Lord Mayor of Cork, Thomas Butterfield.\n\nFollowing the Rising, MacSwiney was interned in various prison camps. In 1917 he was released and married Muriel Murphy of the Cork distillery owning family. After the murder of the Lord Mayor of Cork, Tomás MacCurtáin, during the War of Independence, MacSwiney was elected Lord Mayor. He was arrested for possession of seditious articles and documents, tried by court martial and sentenced to two years imprisonment in Brixton prison. He immediately started a hunger strike and was joined by eleven others imprisoned in Cork Gaol. MacSwiney’s hunger strike gained world attention including from the United States of America which threatened to boycott British goods. After 74 days on hunger strike he died and his body was brought to Cork where he was buried in the Republican Plot at St. Finbarr’s Cemetery, Glasheen Road in Cork. Arthur Griffith delivered the graveside oration. Terence MacSwiney's only child Máire MacSwiney married Ruairi Brugha, the son of Cathal Brugha, in 1945.\n\nhttp://www.census.nationalarchives.ie/pages/1911/Cork/Blackrock/Knockrea/401536/\n\nhttp://www.census.nationalarchives.ie/reels/nai001896413/\n\nJohn Francis, Count McCormack\n\nAddress: 5, Goldsmith Terrace (Athlone Urban (W), Westmeath)\n\nThis is the Census 1901 return for the family of John McCormack.

Now however the head of the family was the grandmother Julia Hoban (64), a furniture dealer. She also had a daughter called Julia Hoban (33) and two other grandchildren. Noel’s mother’s name was now recorded as Catherine and he also had a younger sister, Kathleen aged 2. His brother Thomas was not recorded here – the return states that of the three children who born only two were still living and therefore we can assume that Thomas had died.\n\nhttp://www.census.nationalarchives.ie/pages/1911/Dublin/Royal_Exchange/Mercer_St__Lower/81142/\n\nhttp://www.census.nationalarchives.ie/reels/nai000199260/\n\nPeig Sayers\n\nAged 40 at the time of Census 1911\n\nAddress: 22, Great Blasket Island (Dunquin, Kerry)\n\nThe Census 1911 return for Margaret Guiheen (Peig Sayers), recorded her living on the Great Blasket Island with her husband Patrick (49), her brother-in-law Michael (40) and her six surviving children out of ten born to her.

The father Adolphus (54) is Church of Ireland and his occupation is that of a proof-reader. The mother Fanny (55), born in Germany is Agnostic. The household, including boarders, is an interesting mix of beliefs. Adolphus was heavily involved in the Trade Union movement. He introduced the Gasworkers Union to Ireland and would have known James Connolly. Arthur “Boss” Shields is the brother of Barry Fitzgerald the actor and was an actor himself in the Abbey Theatre in Dublin; he was also an Irish Volunteer. On Easter Sunday 1916 Arthur went to collect his rifle at the Abbey Theatre where it was hidden under the stage. He spent the week of the Rising in and around the GPO and Moore Street. After the surrender he was interned with Michael Collins at Kent and then later in Wales. In 1936 he played Pearse in the 1936 film adaption of Seán O’Casey’s “The Plough and the Stars”. He moved to Hollywood and was reunited with his brother Barry Fitzgerald when they both starred in the movie “How Green Was My Valley” in 1941. Another cast member was John Loder who was also involved in the Rising. Loder was the son and aide-de-camp to his father General William Lowe, who accepted Pearse’s surrender. In the famous picture of Pearse's surrender John Loder was pictured beside his father and opposite Elizabeth O’Farrell and Pearse. Arthur Shields is buried beside his brother Barry at Deansgrange Cemetary, Blackrock in Dublin.\n\nhttp://www.census.nationalarchives.ie/pages/1911/Dublin/Clontarf_East/Vernon_Terrace_/3830/\n\nhttp://www.census.nationalarchives.ie/reels/nai000020355/\n\nJames Simcox (Lord Mayor of Cork 1911 - 1912)\n\nAged 53 at the time of Census 1911\n\nAddress: 3, Monfieldstown (Douglas, Cork)\n\nThe Census 1911 return for the Simcox family recorded James Simcox (53) as the head of the family. He was a merchant and was proficient in Irish and English. He had been married for 13 years to Kathleen (35) and both Kathleen and James were from Co. Cork.\n\nJames's marriage to Kathleen appears to be his second marriage as the census report records that the couple had 4 children of which only 2 are still living. James had two older sons Richard (22) who was also a merchant and John Vincent (17) who was at school. The two younger sons were from his marriage to Kathleen, Francis Joseph (10) and Redmond (7), who were both at school. James had three daughters, Helena (26), Mary Gertrude (20), (who is proficient in Irish and English) and Eveline (18).

Matt was revered by many Catholics for his piety, charity and mortification of the flesh. Talbot was an unskilled labourer. Though he lived alone for most of his life, Talbot did live with his mother for a time. His life would have gone unnoticed were it not for the cords and chains discovered on his body when he died suddenly on a Dublin street in 1925. Matt was one of Dublin’s poorest. He lived in a tenement, died in a laneway and was buried in a pauper’s grave. He had an alcoholic father and worked for a while in a wine merchant’s store. He was a hopeless alcoholic by the age of 13. Talbot may be considered a patron of men and women struggling with alcoholism. In 1975 Pope Paul VI declared him to be Venerable Matt Talbot. He is buried in Glasnevin Cemetery.\n\nhttp://www.census.nationalarchives.ie/pages/1911/Dublin/Mountjoy/Rutland_Street__Upper/23750/\n\nhttp://www.census.nationalarchives.ie/reels/nai000062254/\n\nSir William Thompson\n\nAged 47 at the time of the Census\n\nAddress: 59, Fitzwilliam Square, North (Mansion House, Dublin)\n\nThe Census 1911 return for Sir William John Thompson (49) from Co.

Walton\n\nAged 7 at the time of Census 1911\n\n(1903 – 1995)\n\nAddress: 7, Riverview Terrace (Banbridge West Urban, Down)\n\nCensus return for the Walton family shows the head of the family, John Arthur Walton (36) originally from Co. Tipperary, a Methodist Minister, married to Mary Elizabeth (30) from Co. Dublin. They have 2 children, Ernest (7) born in Co. Waterford and Dorothy Letitia (5) born in Co. Limerick. All family members are Methodists but Annie O’Hare (29), the Domestic Servant from Co. Down is Catholic.\n\nErnest Walton was an Irish physicist and Nobel laureate for his work with John Cockcroft with “atom smashing” experiments done at Cambridge University in the early 1930’s. Walton and Cockcroft were recipients of the 1951 Nobel Prize in Physics for their work on the “transmutation of the atomic nuclei by artificially accelerated atomic particles”,popularly known as splitting the atom. Walton is the only Irishman to have won a Nobel Prize in science. Ernest Walton was born in Abbeyside, County Waterford, Ireland, to a Methodist minister father, Rev. John Walton and Anna Sinton. In those days a general clergyman's family moved once every three years, and this practice carried Ernest and his family, while he was a small child, to Rathkeale in County Limerick (where his mother died) and to County Monaghan. He attended day schools in counties Down, Tyrone, and Wesley College Dublin before becoming a boarder at Methodist College Belfast in 1915, where he excelled in science and mathematics.\n\nIn 1922 Walton won scholarships to Trinity College, Dublin for the study of mathematics and science. He was awarded bachelor's and master's degrees from Trinity in 1926 and 1927, respectively. During these years at college, Walton received numerous prizes for excellence in physics and mathematics (seven prizes in all), including the Foundation Scholarship in 1924. Walton died in 1995 and is buried in Deansgrange Cemetery.\n\nhttp://www.census.nationalarchives.ie/pages/1911/Down/Banbridge_West_Urban/Riverview_Terrace/207179/\n\nhttp://www.census.nationalarchives.ie/reels/nai002147802/\n\nW. B. Yeats\n\nAged 45 at the time of Census 1911\n\nAddress: 16, Frederick Street, South (Royal Exchange, Dublin)\n\nThe Census 1911 Return for W.B Yeats recorded him staying at Nolan’s Hotel in South Frederick St. in 1911, accompanied by Lady Augusta Gregory. A poet and dramatist, Yeats was one of the foremost figures of 20th century literature and was awarded the Nobel Prize for Literature in 1923. He was the driving force behind the Irish Literary Revival and along with Lady Gregory and others, founded the Abbey Theatre. He was a great admirer of Maud Gonne and proposed to her a number of times. She was his muse but she turned him down each time and married John MacBride instead. In 1917 Yeats also proposed to Maud Gonne’s daughter Iseult but she also refused him. The same year Yeats proposed to 25-year-old Georgie Hyde-Lees. Their marriage was a success and the couple went on to have two children, Anne and Michael. Yeats served as a senator for two terms. He retired from the Senate in 1928 because of ill health. He died in France in 1939 and was buried there. However in 1948 his body was moved to Drumsliff, County Sligo. The person in charge of this operation for the Irish Government was Sean MacBride, son of Maud Gonne MacBride and then Minister of External Affairs. Yeats wrote one of the most iconic poems “Easter 1916” about the Rising, where the ordinary citizen is transformed into a revolutionary with the words “All changed, changed utterly: a terrible beauty is born”. Another poem “Sixteen Dead Men” documents Yeat’s emotional response to the events and aftermath of Easter 1916.\n\nhttp://www.census.nationalarchives.ie/pages/1911/Dublin/Royal_Exchange/Frederick_Street__South/88146/\n\nhttp://www.census.nationalarchives.ie/reels/nai000209724/"
