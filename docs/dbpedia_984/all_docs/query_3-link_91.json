Ibsens original caused riots over a century ago. The furore was caused by a combination of the subject matter and the form we now know as realism. The play deals with such hair-raising matters as adultery, womens rights, illegitimate children and venereal disease while abandoning certain accepted theatrical conventions. [ ] Essentially a study and critique of Catholic [sic] morality and immorality Ghosts transfers well to an Irish context. The questions it raises in Kilroys version may have seemed of marginal interest even on its first outing in 1989, perhaps then seen as more relevant to 1950s Ireland. But this was more than a decade before the clerical abuse scandals came to light. The latest production while being after the fact as it were is no less powerful as an analysis of how Irish social and political culture willingly surrendered its will to a church of men now shown to have not only feet of clay but extremely mucky boots. The figure of Father Manning now seems anachronistic when dishing out moral advice. The effect is to see the whole shape of the play twist and warp so that the solid ground of morality represented by the priest now seems morally defunct. / The shame that would earlier have accrued to the secular characters shifts to what was once the high moral ground. A good priest represented on the Irish stage saying all the things [84] a good priest should say now seems to have a oddly subversive effect. [ ]. Quotes Mrs Aylward in Kilroys version: Do you know what I think is really ghostly in this life? Things inside ourselves that haunt us, stopping us from being fully alive the place is full of haunted suffering people.\n\nBrian Friel, on The Big Chapel in Back Due to Demand [column] in The Guardian (3 May 2008): Thomas Kilroys The Big Chapel (1971) is an important novel, a prickly story, an angry story. As in all his angular plays, the people in this novel have their home - a term they wouldnt be fully at ease with - in the margins. They are not of the centre, of the consensus. But they are not a marginalised people: the margins are their centre. And they inhabit the margins because, as Denis Donoghue says, the margins is the place for those feelings and intuitions that daily life doesnt have a place for and mostly seems to suppress. And the most important intuition is of mystery. Or, as Flannery OConnor said, Fiction is concerned with mystery that is lived; the ultimate mystery as we find it embodied in the concrete world of sense experience. / And now The Big Chapel has a chance to come back to full life after 30 years of catalepsy. The Red Priest will thunder again. The big chapel will be desecrated. The Master will be felled. And the mystery life of its people, agitated and baffled by an unease just that bit beyond their comprehension and control, will unfold again as if for the first time. And the novel will be acclaimed and garlanded again. But what will keep it permanently vital will be the response it evokes once more from its astonished and grateful readers.\n\nFintan OToole, [Culture Shock], in The Irish Times (6 March 2010), Weekend, p.8:  We live in the 19th century as well as the 21st: [...] In [...] Christ Deliver Us!, it makes particular sense that the play is essentially about ignorance. Its central concern - and Kilroy makes this even more explicit than Wedekind does - is with the gap between what the body knows, its urges and demands, and what the repressed mind can process and articulate. The wellspring of the entire tragedy is a simple act of explanation. Michael explains the facts of life to his friend Mossy in written words and drawings. This basic act of enlightenment sets in motion a wave of tragedies. Explicit knowledge is as dangerous here as it is in the Garden of Eden. / Kilroy locates this basic story brilliantly within a recognisable 1950s provincial Ireland, capturing the speech and manners of the period. But it unfolds more profoundly within the memory of that period, the bitter afterlife of its class distinctions, its industrial schools and Magdalen homes. If the play feels ghostly, it is because it is not essentially about a socially realistic 1950s but about our present need to confront the psychic legacy of the culture that was at its height in that decade. / And in this regard, a play about ignorance is entirely relevant to our present condition. The key psychological question of the Celtic Tiger years is the same as the one that hovers around the industrial schools: our collective ability to both know and not know. We knew that the industrial schools were institutions of organised cruelty but somehow remained detached from this knowledge. And we knew that much of boomtime Ireland was delusional, but allowed this knowledge to remain entirely inert. We do not have the luxury of looking with smug disdain on the wilful ignorance that Kilroy anatomises. / The remarkable thing is not that veterans like Murphy and Kilroy approach the present though the past. It is that they remain interested in that past, not for its own sake, but in relation to the way it has shaped our present world. The only difference is that they see boomtime Ireland, not as a sealed-off chamber of contemporary meanings, but as a trophy house haunted by its unacknowledged memories. [End.]\n\nDeclan Hughes, Visceral Force and Haunting Lyric Beauty, in The Irish Times (Wed. 27 April 2011): [...] Kilroy is not so much an Irish playwright as a playwright who happens to be Irish. You could say that Talbots Box is one of the great masterpieces of modern theatre, and happily we were not so hypnotised by theory or ideology that we couldnt see this. I wouldnt disagree on either count. But the play explores similar thematic terrain to many I had deemed beyond the pale. Moreover, at its centre stands Matt Talbot, Dublin labouring-man and penitential Catholic mystic  hardly a totem for metropolitan youth with something to say. / But that was just it. At some unconscious level, we must have understood that it aint what you say but the way that you say it. The sheer theatricality of Talbots Box was unusual, perhaps unprecedented, on an Irish stage. [...] The stage directions stipulate that the playing area be encased in a box made of timbers with slots through which light can shine out. We built the box, and the tiny Players Theatre in House No. 3 at Trinity College Dublin smelt of pine, resin and sap. It seemed to me then, and it seems to me now, that we were building far more than just the set for a play. Talbots Box had the overwhelming effect on me that great art is supposed to have: it changed irrevocably the way I felt about 1) theatre; and 2) everything else. It is long overdue a revival. (See full-text copy in RICORSO Library, Criticism > Reviews, via index, or direct.)\n\n[ top ]\n\nQuotations\n\nGroundwork for an Irish Theatre, in Studies: An Irish Quarterly Review (Summer 1959): In our search for a new Irish theatre we are probably looking for premises with a clear view from every window. Too often the view from our modern Irish windows is cluttered-up with distracting monuments to the dead and glorious past of politics and art. If we ever do come to house a creative theatre for a new generation, many of these idols will have to be demolished so that the interesting new faces of modern Ireland may crowd at every window in the theatre.  In the ensuing, Kilroy writes that during the past twenty five years few Irish dramatist have been in any way exciting technically  and offers a framework for a creative theatre for a new generation.  In the following issue, Gabriel Fallon caustically responded: Possibly the best way in which Mr. Kilroy could bring this about, (i.e., a new Irish Theatre), would be for him to become in the shortest time possible a startingly good Irish dramatist.  Fallon later greeted Talbot s Box as deeply moving .

Edna Longley [Proceedings of the Cultures of Ireland Group Conference] (QUB: Inst. of Irish Studies 1991), pp.135-141: Kilroy speaks of the breath of English-language influences, including (besides England), America, Australasia, Caribbean and Nigeria. [87] In his address on Secularised Ireland, he remarks the following [inter alia}: a kind of modality of fear at the root of Irish culture, a kind of timidity before life itself in all its mortal glory and all its dreadful horror, its inexpressible variety [...] the peculiar nature of the fear Im talking about has its source in education [...] particularly [...] Roman Catholic and Presbyterian [...] a sense of severe disconnectedness where the familiar stepping-stones disappear [135] [...] paralysing of the possibility of development [...]; Kilroy compares Northern Catholics and Protestants with Croats and Serbs in terms of the claim of the Elect, the Chosen People, the One, True Faith [...] of unique access to truth; further: one cannot exaggerate the rage and terror which such absolutism inspires, nor the barbarity which it is capable of causing. [137] He also quotes Seamus Deane, and the American theologian Harvey Cox. Note that his remarks are subsequently endorsed by Fergus OFerrall and Werner Jeanrond (pp.153-54), and with qualification, by Gerald Dawe (p.157).\n\nTalbots Box - concluding speech: —Quoted in Declan Hughes, Visceral Force and Haunting Lyric Beauty, in The Irish Times (Wed. 27 April 2011)\n\nSense of Place? To base ones identity exclusively upon a mystical sense of place, upon the accident of ones birth, seems to me a dangerous absurdity. To dedicate ones life to the systematic betrayal of the same notion seems to be just as absurd. (Introduction to Double Cross ; quoted in Jack Hanna, reviewing same, in Books Ireland, Oct. 1996, p.279.)\n\nRemembrance Day, 2003: Readings and discussion under the title Theatres of War were conducted at the Lyric Theatre, Ridgeway St., Belfast, on 9 Nov. 2003, with speakers Tom Kilroy, Tom Paulin and others.\n\nIndividual v. community: Sharon Moore, Seamus Heaneys Revelation of Self Through Community, in Studi Irlandesi, A Journal of Irish Studies, 1:1 (2011) writes: thomas Kilroy challenges the widespread view that literature is the product of an individualistic mind, and questions the popular association of the act of writing [...] with a transcending of the ordinary, everyday social facts of existence. (Citing P[eter] Connolly, ed., Literature and the Changing Ireland, Gerrards Cross: Colin Smythe 1982, p.179; available as .pdf - online; accessed 14.02.2023.)\n\n[ top ]\n\nReferences\n\nD.

Robert OKeeffe, parish priest of Callan, his hometown, from 1863, whose concern with education led him to set up a new school in the parish which drew pupils away from the Christian Brothers, attracting the ire of Bishop Walsh, and resulting in his discharge from post of school manager and work-house chaplain; there ensued rioting up to 1881 especially in connection with the law suits that OKeeffe brought against the clergy, including Cardinal Cullen as a representative of the Church against whom OKeeffe appealed for justice to the Government.
