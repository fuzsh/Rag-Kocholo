        "text": "Muckross park gate to Muckross House; 2 miles, easy. Muckross House to Old Weir Bridge; 4 miles, easy\n\nAfter enjoying an included breakfast meet one of your Country Walkers leaders in the hotel lobby at 8:30 a.m.\n\nFollowing a short introductory meeting, travel via private bus from Ennis to Killarney (a journey of approximately two hours, depending on traffic). Your first destination is Killarney National Park. Ensure you are prepared for a day of walking, as the bus will continue with your luggage to your hotel after leaving you at the park entrance. Here, you meet your second Country Walkers leader and enter the stunning vistas of the Killarney Lakes with their impressive mountain backdrop. You’ll walk through a lush meadow, along a river, and through the woodlands to reach the lakeshore. Across the waters, admire the tree-covered slopes of Tomies Wood, stretching upwards towards the peaks of the Shehy and Tomies mountains. Continue along the shoreline through a delightful woodland glade until you come across the magnificent manor, Muckross House.\n\nYour lunch today at the manor’s Garden Restaurant is included. Once you’ve finished, you have the choice of enjoying a stroll through magnificent displays of ornamental shrubs, flower beds, and wide expanses of manicured lawns or continuing with a walk around Muckross Lake. This walk takes you through ancient woodlands, over Brickeen Bridge, and across Dinis Island to the Meeting of the Waters and the Old Weir Bridge. All the while, you are surrounded by wonderful views, small lakeside beaches, and rocky coves.\n\nYou’ll then meet your bus and drive to your hotel in Killarney—your home for the next three nights—collecting non-walkers at Muckross House on the way.\n\nTake some free time to settle in, then get to know your fellow travelers and leaders during a welcome reception and dinner this evening.\n\nIncluded Meals: Breakfast, Lunch, Dinner\n\nStart of walk to meet minibus; 3 miles, easy OR start of walk to Glenbeigh; 5 miles, easy to moderate. Afternoon Glenbeigh to Curra Hill; 2 miles, easy\n\nToday’s walk brings you to the northern part of the Kerry Peninsula. After a short drive, your bus will leave you at the trailhead—a quiet, paved country road circling Seefin Mountain. As you walk, enjoy spectacular views over Lough Caragh. At the end of the road, you have the option of rejoining the minibus and meeting the group in Glenbeigh or walking to Glenbeigh up the mountain on a footpath through Windy Gap. This path is part of the Kerry Way, a 135-mile walking route over old droving paths and coach roads.\n\nEnjoy a picnic lunch prepared by your leaders in Glenbeigh.\n\nAfter lunch, you have two options: You can shuttle two miles to Rossbehy Creek and take a short walk along White Strand, a beautiful sandy beach on a small peninsula stretching into Dingle Bay. Or you can walk along the banks of River Behy and follow the Kerry Way through the sloped woods of Curra Hill, then shuttle down to Rossbehy Beach.\n\nTonight, before exploring downtown Killarney, you’ll meet Denis Kissane, a local friend who will give a nostalgic presentation about his childhood in “The Old Bohareen.” Then, stroll into town for dinner on your own.\n\nA vibrant town surrounded by the stunning beauty of the National Park, Killarney is home to historical sites and lively pubs. It’s also an ideal base for exploring the nearby mountains and lakes.\n\nIncluded Meals: Breakfast, Lunch\n\nKate Kearney’s Cottage to Lord Brandon’s Cottage; 7 miles, easy to moderate\n\nThis morning, you’ll drive to Kate Kearney’s Cottage, the site where the legendary 19th-century beauty made and sold an illicit brew “very fierce and wild, requiring not less than seven times its own quantity of water to tame and subdue it.” Now a popular shop and pub, it’s also the starting point for today’s walk. You ascend a steady paved incline and traverse a spectacular glacial valley, known as the Gap of Dunloe. Your trail parallels a mountain stream over rugged terrain lined with massive boulders until you reach the pass between Macgillycuddy’s Reeks—Ireland’s tallest mountain range, at 3,414 feet—and the Purple Mountains. Then you’ll descend into the Black Valley. Throughout your journey, you’ll have a horse-drawn jaunting cart at the ready if you want a break.\n\nFrom here, you’ll board open boats and cruise to Ross Castle, a 15th-century tower house, as your boatmen regale you with tales of Napoleon, King Brian Boru, and others who have passed this way. An included lunch awaits you back in Killarney.\n\nThe afternoon and evening is yours to explore the vibrant town of Killarney. You’ll be sure to have the chance to mingle with locals and catch live music in one of Killarney’s lively pubs.\n\nIncluded Meals: Breakfast, Lunch\n\nCastle Ross Hotel to Killarney; 2 miles, easy. Loop walk around Ross Island; 2 miles, easy. Killarney House to St. Mary’s Cathedral; 2 miles, easy\n\nAfter breakfast, pack your luggage, as today you depart Killarney for Dingle. First, though, you’ll take a very short drive to Castle Ross Hotel for a walk in Killarney’s beautiful parklands. More of a peninsula than an island, Ross Island is heavily wooded with a network of paths leading to attractive viewpoints overlooking Lough Leane. Also visible are remains of former copper mines throughout the ages—some remains date back 4,000 years to the prehistoric Bronze Age, and others are from the 19th century. You can stop at Killarney Cathedral or join your leaders for a walk around Ross Island. Then, explore the discovery trail around the landscaped gardens at Killarney House before continuing on to St. Mary’s Cathedral and Killarney town center.\n\nYou’ll have free time for an independent lunch in Killarney before continuing on to Dingle Peninsula. On route to Dingle, you will visit impressive Inch Beach, a wild and wind-swept sand spit and dune system that separates Castlemaine Harbor from the Atlantic Ocean. There’ll be time to walk its stunning sands before continuing on to Dingle.\n\nTonight is free for you to explore lively Dingle Town, a 10-minute walk from your hotel, or relax at the generously appointed property. Dinner is on your own. Perhaps enjoy the freshly prepared dishes at your hotel’s Coastguard Restaurant (reservations required) or at the more casual Blaskets Bar. Dinner is on your own.\n\nIncluded Meals: Breakfast\n\nThree Peaks of Annascaul; 4.5 miles, moderate or Annascaul Village Loop walk; from 2 miles, easy\n\nStart your morning with a leisurely breakfast overlooking the blue-glass waters of Dingle Harbor. Early risers may choose to set forth into Dingle Town, a village that has been described as an artistic girl who’s out for rowdy fun. Browse eclectic shops along the shoreline and watch as fishermen bring home their morning catch. Afterward, you travel 15 minutes to Annascaul. This authentic sleepy Irish town at the foothills of the Slieve Mish Mountains is set in the heart of the Dingle Peninsula. The village is also the celebrated birthplace of Tom Crean, the famous explorer who accompanied Ernest Shackleton on three Antarctic expeditions. With beaches to the south and mountains to the north, Annascaul is a walker’s paradise.\n\nYou can view it all during today’s trail options. A moderate loop traverses past rolling sheep pastures and the area’s famed “three peaks,” a series of rises and descents that include Brackloon and Knockafeehane. Enjoy spectacular and serene views throughout this invigorating trek – a patchwork of green farmland dotted with farmhouses amidst the striking beauty of southern County Kerry and the Dingle Peninsula. Or discover Annascaul in greater depth and follow a river path from the village, crossing scenic bridges and passing historic landmarks, including a memorial and statue to Tom Crean himself, erected in front of the South Pole Inn, which he opened upon his return from his adventures.\n\nAfter lunch together in Annascaul, you’ll return to your hotel in Dingle. Enjoy the many amenities at your hotel, including the pool, outdoor hot tub, and on-site Peninsula Spa. Dinner is on your own.\n\nIncluded Meals: Breakfast, Lunch\n\nClogher Beach Cliff Top Walk; 2 miles, easy. Ballydavid Coastline Walk; options from 2 miles, easy\n\nThis morning you set out toward Slea Head, where small farms cling to the precipitous slopes along the magnificent Dingle Way. Your morning coastal walk between emerald-green farmland and deep-blue ocean reveals Iron Age remains, such as beehive huts used by Eremite monks and farmers. Rounding the head, you take in breathtaking views of the Blasket Islands spreading out before you. These were once the westernmost inhabited lands of Europe; a population decline to just 22 in 1953—and their lack of access to emergency services—drove residents to the mainland. You continue along grassy paths through pastures dotted with sheep and an occasional donkey, tracing stone walls, crossing stiles, and climbing hills that always reward your efforts with sweeping views of the Irish countryside.\n\nAfter, learn the story of traditional island life at The Blasket Center, a fascinating cultural center and museum which chronicles the island residents’ struggle for existence through exhibitions, interactive displays, artifacts, and audio-visual presentations. During your stay, enjoy an included lunch at the center’s Bialann Café, where large floor-to-ceiling windows offer spectacular views of the sea and islands.\n\nAfter lunch, travel north and trace the Wild Atlantic Way shoreline trail. Your walk along more spectacular coastline delivers you to Ballydavid where you may explore the pier and enjoy a pint overlooking Smerwick Harbor. Returning to Dingle, you stop to visit the medieval-era remains of Kilmalkedar, a National Monument of Ireland. The remarkable site preserves an unusually dense early Christian settlement that contributed to the evolution of the early Irish Church from the 6th to the 12th centuries.\n\nThis evening is again yours to explore the imaginative and charming town of Dingle, where strains of traditional pub music pour into the streets at night. Alternatively, stay put and enjoy the many amenities of your hotel, including the award-winning leisure club, pool, and spa. This evening, savor a sumptuous final dinner at your hotel’s acclaimed Coastguard Restaurant overlooking Dingle Harbor and the mountains of the Iveragh Peninsula.\n\nIncluded Meals: Breakfast, Dinner\n\nAt 8:00 a.m. drive by private motorcoach 60 minutes to the Killarney train station. There you will board Irish Rail train for Dublin (an approximate four-hour journey). Upon arrival at Dublin’s train station, a private coach will bring you to the Schoolhouse Hotel.\n\nImportant: Upon arrival at the hotel, please reconfirm with the hotel receptionist the time of your transportation to the Dublin airport for your return flight home. You have the remainder of the day free to take in a bit of the atmosphere of Dublin and to seek out one of the city’s many restaurants, pubs, or outdoor cafés for lunch and dinner on your own.\n\nThe remainder of the day is free for you to explore Dublin on your own. Country Walkers provides you with city information including recommendations about what to see and do in the city.\n\nIncluded Meals: Breakfast\n\nMuckross park gate to Muckross House; 2 miles, easy. Muckross House to Old Weir Bridge; 4 miles, easy\n\nAfter enjoying an included breakfast meet one of your Country Walkers guides in the hotel lobby at 9:00 a.m.\n\nFollowing a short introductory meeting, travel via private bus from Cork to Killarney (a journey of approximately 90 minutes, depending on traffic). Your first destination is Killarney National Park. Ensure you are prepared for a day of walking, as the bus will continue with your luggage to your hotel after leaving you at the park entrance.

Country Walkers provides you with city information including recommendations about what to see and do in Kinsale.\n\nKinsale has been seasoned liberally by Norman, Spanish, and English influences since the Middle Ages, but nowadays most of the seasoning takes place in the numerous fine restaurants that make this the “Gourmet Capital of Ireland.” Kinsale is also a yachting and fishing center, hence its reputation for great seafood!\n\nIncluded Meals: Breakfast\n\nMuckross park gate to Muckross House; 2 miles, easy. Muckross House to Old Weir Bridge; 4 miles, easy\n\nAfter breakfast on your own, meet one of your leaders at the meeting hotel in Ennis at 8:30 a.m.\n\nFollowing a short introductory meeting, travel via private bus from Ennis to Killarney. Your first destination is Killarney National Park. Ensure you are prepared for a day of walking. Here, you meet your second Country Walkers guide and enter the stunning vistas of the Killarney Lakes with their impressive mountain backdrop. You’ll walk through a lush meadow, along a river, and through the woodlands to reach the lakeshore. Across the waters, admire the tree-covered slopes of Tomies Wood, stretching upwards towards the peaks of the Shehy and Tomies mountains. Continue along the shoreline through a delightful woodland glade until you come across the magnificent manor, Muckross House.\n\nYour lunch today at the manor’s Garden Restaurant is included. Once you’ve finished, you have the choice of enjoying a stroll through magnificent displays of ornamental shrubs, flower beds, and wide expanses of manicured lawns or continuing with a walk around Muckross Lake. This walk takes you through ancient woodlands, over Brickeen Bridge, and across Dinis Island to the Meeting of the Waters and the Old Weir Bridge. All the while, you are surrounded by wonderful views, small lakeside beaches, and rocky coves.\n\nYou’ll then meet your bus and drive to the Cahernane House in Killarney—your home for the next three nights—collecting non-walkers at Muckross House on the way.\n\nTake some free time to settle into the charming country manor house, then get to know your fellow travelers and guides during a welcome reception and dinner this evening.\n\nIncluded Meals: Lunch, Dinner\n\nStart of walk to meet minibus; 3 miles, easy OR start of walk to Glenbeigh; 5 miles, easy to moderate.

At the end of the road, you have the option of rejoining the minibus and meeting the group in Glenbeigh or walking to Glenbeigh up the mountain on a footpath through Windy Gap. This path is part of the Kerry Way, a 135-mile walking route over old droving paths and coach roads.\n\nEnjoy a picnic lunch prepared by your leaders in Glenbeigh.\n\nAfter lunch, you have two options: You can shuttle two miles to Rossbehy Creek and take a short walk along White Strand, a beautiful sandy beach on a small peninsula stretching into Dingle Bay. Or you can walk along the banks of River Behy and follow the Kerry Way through the sloped woods of Curra Hill, then shuttle down to Rossbehy Beach.\n\nTonight, before exploring downtown Killarney, you’ll meet Denis Kissane, a local friend who will give a nostalgic presentation about his childhood in “The Old Bohareen.” Then, stroll into town for dinner on your own.\n\nA vibrant town surrounded by the stunning beauty of the National Park, Killarney is home to historical sites and lively pubs. It’s also an ideal base for exploring the nearby mountains and lakes.\n\nIncluded Meals: Breakfast, Lunch\n\nKate Kearney’s Cottage to Lord Brandon’s Cottage; 7 miles, easy to moderate\n\nThis morning, you’ll drive to Kate Kearney’s Cottage, the site where the legendary 19th-century beauty made and sold an illicit brew “very fierce and wild, requiring not less than seven times its own quantity of water to tame and subdue it.” Now a popular shop and pub, it’s also the starting point for today’s walk. You ascend a steady paved incline and traverse a spectacular glacial valley, known as the Gap of Dunloe. Your trail parallels a mountain stream over rugged terrain lined with massive boulders until you reach the pass between Macgillycuddy’s Reeks—Ireland’s tallest mountain range, at 3,414 feet—and the Purple Mountains. Then you’ll descend into the Black Valley. Throughout your journey, you’ll have a horse-drawn jaunting cart at the ready if you want a break.\n\nFrom here, you’ll board open boats and cruise to Ross Castle, a 15th-century tower house, as your boatmen regale you with tales of Napoleon, King Brian Boru, and others who have passed this way.

Loop walk around Ross Island; 2 miles, easy. Killarney House to St. Mary’s Cathedral; 2 miles, easy\n\nAfter breakfast, pack your luggage, as today you depart Killarney for Dingle. First, though, you’ll take a very short drive to Castle Ross Hotel for a walk in Killarney’s beautiful parklands. More of a peninsula than an island, Ross Island is heavily wooded with a network of paths leading to attractive viewpoints overlooking Lough Leane. Also visible are remains of former copper mines throughout the ages—some remains date back 4,000 years to the prehistoric Bronze Age, and others are from the 19th century. You can stop at Killarney Cathedral or join your leaders for a walk around Ross Island. Then, explore the discovery trail around the landscaped gardens at Killarney House before continuing on to St. Mary’s Cathedral and Killarney town center.\n\nYou’ll have free time for an independent lunch in Killarney before continuing on to Dingle Peninsula. On route to Dingle, you will visit impressive Inch Beach, a wild and wind-swept sand spit and dune system that separates Castlemaine Harbor from the Atlantic Ocean. There’ll be time to walk its stunning sands before continuing on to Dingle.\n\nTonight is free for you to explore lively Dingle Town, a 10-minute walk from your hotel, or relax at the generously appointed property. Dinner is on your own. Perhaps enjoy the freshly prepared dishes at your hotel’s Coastguard Restaurant (reservations required) or at the more casual Blaskets Bar. Dinner is on your own.\n\nIncluded Meals: Breakfast\n\nThree Peaks of Annascaul; 4.5 miles, moderate or Annascaul Village Loop walk; from 2 miles, easy\n\nStart your morning with a leisurely breakfast overlooking the blue-glass waters of Dingle Harbor. Early risers may choose to set forth into Dingle Town, a village that has been described as an artistic girl who’s out for rowdy fun. Browse eclectic shops along the shoreline and watch as fishermen bring home their morning catch. Afterward, you travel 15 minutes to Annascaul. This authentic sleepy Irish town at the foothills of the Slieve Mish Mountains is set in the heart of the Dingle Peninsula. The village is also the celebrated birthplace of Tom Crean, the famous explorer who accompanied Ernest Shackleton on three Antarctic expeditions. With beaches to the south and mountains to the north, Annascaul is a walker’s paradise.\n\nYou can view it all during today’s trail options. A moderate loop traverses past rolling sheep pastures and the area’s famed “three peaks,” a series of rises and descents that include Brackloon and Knockafeehane. Enjoy spectacular and serene views throughout this invigorating trek – a patchwork of green farmland dotted with farmhouses amidst the striking beauty of southern County Kerry and the Dingle Peninsula. Or discover Annascaul in greater depth and follow a river path from the village, crossing scenic bridges and passing historic landmarks, including a memorial and statue to Tom Crean himself, erected in front of the South Pole Inn, which he opened upon his return from his adventures.\n\nAfter lunch together in Annascaul, you’ll return to your hotel in Dingle. Enjoy the many amenities at your hotel, including the pool, outdoor hot tub, and on-site Peninsula Spa.

Your morning coastal walk between emerald-green farmland and deep-blue ocean reveals Iron Age remains, such as beehive huts used by Eremite monks and farmers. Rounding the head, you take in breathtaking views of the Blasket Islands spreading out before you. These were once the westernmost inhabited lands of Europe; a population decline to just 22 in 1953—and their lack of access to emergency services—drove residents to the mainland. You continue along grassy paths through pastures dotted with sheep and an occasional donkey, tracing stone walls, crossing stiles, and climbing hills that always reward your efforts with sweeping views of the Irish countryside.\n\nAfter, learn the story of traditional island life at The Blasket Center, a fascinating cultural center and museum which chronicles the island residents’ struggle for existence through exhibitions, interactive displays, artifacts, and audio-visual presentations. During your stay, enjoy an included lunch at the center’s Bialann Café, where large floor-to-ceiling windows offer spectacular views of the sea and islands.\n\nAfter lunch, travel north and trace the Wild Atlantic Way shoreline trail. Your walk along more spectacular coastline delivers you to Ballydavid where you may explore the pier and enjoy a pint overlooking Smerwick Harbor. Returning to Dingle, you stop to visit the medieval-era remains of Kilmalkedar, a National Monument of Ireland. The remarkable site preserves an unusually dense early Christian settlement that contributed to the evolution of the early Irish Church from the 6th to the 12th centuries.\n\nThis evening is again yours to explore the imaginative and charming town of Dingle, where strains of traditional pub music pour into the streets at night.
