They rise in places to over 700 feet and stretch for over 5 miles. O’Brien’s Tower is located on the highest point and offers the best view of the Cliffs.\n\n< Lahinch #1\n\nA visit to the Cliffs of Moher is a must.

O’Brien’s Tower is located on the highest point and offers the best view of the Cliffs, the Aran Islands and mountains as far apart as Kerry and Connemara.\n\n< Ross Castle\n\nbuilt in the 15th century on the shore of Killarney´s Lower lake by O´ Donoghue Mór. In 1652 Ross fell to the English General General Ludlow. The castle was used as a military barracks in the 18th and 19th centuries. Recently the building has been restored and now open to the public.\n\n< Adare - Overview\n\nAdare is generally regarded as Ireland’s prettiest village. Snuggled in a wooded setting among quiet farmlands of the Golden Vale by the River Maigue. Adare Dates from the time of the Norman Conquest. Thatched cottages lines its broad street, puntuated with beautiful stone buildings and pictureque ruins. The River Maigue flows under a graceful stone bridge while ruined medieval monasteries quietly count the passing centuries. A Heritage Centre in the village traces the development of Adare from the 13th century\n\n< Adare Village\n\nAdare is generally regarded as Ireland’s prettiest village.

It owes its origin to Saint Brendan, who founded a monastry there in the 6th Century. Extensive ruins of the ancient Cathedral and Abbey bear ample testimony to its past.\n\n< Banna Strand\n\nfor the spectacular view over Tralee Bay, and its association with Sir Roger Casement, to whom there's a monument. In April 1916, on the eve of the Easter Rising, Casement was captured by local police as he attempted to land at Banna Strand from a German submarine. He was tried and executed for high treason in 1916, and his body was returned from England to Ireland in 1965 to be reinterred with full military honours . You can carry on round the cliffs of Kerry Head for more great vistas - south over Tralee Bay, north across the mouth of the Shannon.\n\n< Blarney Castle\n\nA historic and nostalgic place steeped in history and the ancestral seat of the McCarthy Clan. Nobody is quite certain how the Elizabethan comment developed into the legend that the gift of eloquence may be derived from kissing the Blarney Stone, but it is likely that the stone itself had some significance in the McCarthy Clan. The Kissing Stone itself is set in the battlements and to kiss it the visitor must lie on the walk within the walls, grasp a guard rail, lean back and touch the stone with their lips. It sounds dangerous but it isn't and nobody should leave Blarney without kissing the stone! Also, an opportunity to visit the famous Blarney Woollen Mills for excellent shoppng.\n\n< Blarney Castle\n\nA historic and nostalgic place steeped in history and the ancestral seat of the McCarthy Clan.

Designed for year round colour, it is divided into a number of intimate garden rooms inter-linked by curved paths. There is a large collection of New Zealand, Australian and South African plants. It contains rockeries, herbaceous borders, sunken garden, water garden and fountain, rose garden, vegetable garden, glasshouse and conservatory.\n\n< Brewery Tour\n\nThe Kinsale Brewing Company occupies beautifully restored malthouses dating from 1703 in the heart of Kinsale, and reviving a tradition going back 200 years. The brewery offers a guided tour taking you through each step of the brewing process. At the end of the tour you can browse through the gift shop and sample some of the beers produced, or you can just walk in and soak in the atmosphere of the old brewery bar upstairs.\n\n< Bunratty Castle & Folk Park\n\nA restored Norman-Irish keep built in 1277, the castle houses a fine collection of furniture and furnishings from the 14th to 17th centuries. Medieval banquets are a twice nightly feasture throughout the year. The Folk Park, in the castle grounds is a reconstructed 19th century street, with craft shops, general stores and post office. Traditional crafts can be seen in action and country meals are served in the barn restaurant.\n\n< Bunratty Castle & Folk Park\n\nA restored Norman-Irish keep built in 1277, the castle houses a fine collection of furniture and furnishings from the 14th to 17th centuries.

William Robinson, the original architect, also built the Royal Hospital at Kilmainham in Dublin. Charles Fort has undergone many changes in the last few centuries and it continued to be garrisoned until 1922. It is open to the public from mid-April to mid-October and guided tours are available.\n\n< Cobh Heritage Centre\n\nThe story of Cobh's origins, it's unque history and legacy are dramatically recalled at The Queenstown Story - a stunning multi media exhibition at Cobh's restored Victorian Railway Station. Themes include The Titanic (Cobh was her last port of call), Emigration & Famine. From 1848 - 1950 over 6 million adults and children emigrated from Ireland - over 2.5 million departed from Cobh, making it the single most important port of emigration.\n\n< Connor Pass\n\nThe Connor Pass road is undoubtedly the most dramatic route to take. As it swings towards the south it rises at the side of a large valley formed by glaciers that came from a semi-circle of coums or corries in the surrounding mountains. From the top of the pass there are breathtaking views in fine weather of lowlands, mountains and sea. High vantage points provide the best position from which to take in the sweep of the landscape.\n\n< Corcomroe Abbey\n\nsited a few miles from Ballyvaughan within sight of the coast. The abbey is sited in a valley and was founded between 1182 and 1195. Most of the buildings have vanished with the exception of the church and various surrounding walls. The chancel area (around the altar) has some of the finest stone carving in Ireland. Founded by the O’Briens, Kings of Thomond, it was much more sensible to endow a monastery and claim it was God’s land than build a castle which was certain to be beseiged continually.\n\n< Corcomroe Abbey\n\nsited a few miles from Ballyvaughan within sight of the coast.

It began on an island in the swampy estuary of the River Lee (the Irish for Cork 'Corcaigh' means a marsh) and gradually climbed up the steep banks on either side. Today the river flows through the city in two main channels so you find yourself constantly crossing bridges. The city owes its origins to St. Finbarr who in the 6th century founded a monastery on the south bank of the River Lee where St. Finn Barre's Cathedral stands today. Today Cork blends its history and culture with the amenities of a cosmopolitan city and was the European City of Culture in 2005.\n\n< Cork #1\n\nVisit the wonderful harbour village of Kinsale. Known as the gourmet capital of Ireland and one of the countries’s most attractive villages with narrow lanes and slate hung houses overlooking the broad estuary of the River Bandon. Visits are recommended to the Norman built 12th century church of St.Multose, the 15th century Desmond Castle housing the International Museum of Wine and the many interesting speciality shops.\n\n< Cork #2\n\nNo visit to Ireland would be complete without the opportunity to “Kiss the Blarney Stone”. Located in Blarney Castle to the north of Cork. The gift of eloquent speech is said to be bestowed on all those who kiss the Stone. The adjacent Blarney Woollen Mills allows the visitor to watch the weaving process and make purchases.\n\n< Desmond Castle International Museum of Wine\n\nKinsale's International Museum of Wine tells the romantic story of the Irish emigrants who colonised the wine trade throughout the world after being forced to leave their own shores. The museum is located in Desmond Castle, a 15th century Customs House which belonged to the Fitzgerald family. Kinsale was a designated Wine Port and supplied ships for the Vintage Fleet (forerunner of the British Navy) as far back as 1412. In the 17th century Desmond Castle was turned into a prison - its inmates were mainly French and captured at sea so the castle was populartly known as the \"French prison\". Conditions were grim with overcrowding, lack of food, cold and disease. In 1747 there was a disasterous fire in the prison in which fifty four prisoners perished.\n\n< Dingle Peninsula\n\nThe Dingle Peninsula is widely regarded as having some of the most dramatic scenery in Ireland. Within its small compass it has many interesting antiquities, historic sites, a large number of ancient stone monuments and varied mountain scenery than any other part of Ireland. The combination of rugged mountains, craggy cliffs and long sandy beaches brought David Lean here to film 'Ryan's Daughter' in 1970. More recently, the Tom Cruise film 'Far and Away' was made in the Slea Head area. Dingle town is also an important commercial fishing port, built around an enclosed harbour and has many fine restaurants and craft shops.\n\n< Doonbeg\n\nTake a trip around the Loop Head Peninsula. The scenic roundtrip, which starts from Kilkee, leads along the spectacular, rugged coastline to Loop Head Lighthouse. As well as breathtaking cliff walks with views on wild scenery, ruined promontory forts and early oratories there are many more sights not to miss, a natural bridge (Bridges of Ross), the Moneen Church with its 'Little Ark' , a wooden mobile hut, which once served as a church in earlier times, as well as a number of rare birds, whales, dolphins and seals. On a fine day you can see Connemara in the North and down across the Shannon estuary the Kerry coastline and mountains.\n\n< Ennis - Overview\n\nEnnis is the principal town in Co Clare, a busy market centre on the River Fergus. Its famous narrow streets are dotted with a host of unusual shops, bars and restaurants. Ennis is regarded as the heartland of Irish music, look out for superb nightly sessions, as well as some very lively annual festivals. Ennis is an ideal centre for touring around Co Clare. Whether you'd like to banquet at 15th century Bunratty Castle, visit the delightful lakes of East Clare or explore the isolated loop head coastline, everything is a short drive from Ennis.\n\n< Ennis #2\n\nTake time to explore the northwestern corner of Co Clare, bordered by the Atlantic Ocean and the quieter waters of Galway Bay, is a rock landscape of no ordinary proportions. The area known as the Burren Country extends over one hundred square miles and consists of pale grey limestone. Countless wild flowers and historic monuments make the Burren a unique and worthwhile visit.\n\n< Foynes Flying Boat Museum\n\nFrom 1939 to 1945 Foynes, was the centre of the aviation world, for air traffic between the United States and Europe. The Foynes Museum recalls this era with a comprehensive range of exhibits and graphic illustrations. The museum features the original Terminal Building, Radio and Weather Room (complete with transmitters, receivers and Morse code equipment).
