        "text": "he Plattsmouth Journal I'UltMSIIKD WKKKIjY AT PLATTSMOUTH, NEBRASKA. It. A. HATK.S, I'UJiLlsilKK. nterml at tho poaiofllce at l'lutt-mjouth, Ne hrasku. as ::onlolas matter. It's remarkable how much less for midable a flood look? when the sun is pinning. With Bryan as president, the slogan of the nation would be, 'Forward, march;\" with Taft, \"Mark time.\" Anyhow, there is time to improve the river channels to guard against floods before the national conventions of 1912. There might be sjmc speculation as to the republican platform and can didates if Roosevelt didn't own a ma jority of the convention stock and hold proxies on the remainder. Governor Hughes reiterates that he does not desire the vice presidential nomination and wouldn't accept it, and would not serve if elected. Fortunately for him that Senator Lodge's memorable force bill failed to become a law. The day before the national republi can convention found that body packed in advance by administration machine processes to make the nomination of the administration candidate for the presidency certain beyond a peradven ture. What the Chicago convention ought to do is to nominate for the vice presi dency the man who would make the best president in case he should be call ed upon to serve. What it is going to lo is to nominate the man who is sup posed to be able to pull the most votes or to command the biggest bar'l The Chicago convention should give rlue consideration to the \"doubtful ;states,\" of course, but it wou!dbe folly to try to carry such states by nominat ing a doubtful candidate for vice presi dency or by adopting a doubtful plat form. The country wants positive .men and positive things just now. \"With a candidate for governor who has never been mixed up with any fac tion in state affairs, and who is honest, capable and possesses all the qualifica tions to make him a good official, the dem ocrats and opponents to republicanism can easily carry their banner on to vic tory this fall. But we must have such a man to be successful. We have sev eral to select from. History shows that the man elected to the vice presidency has a better chance to become president than any other man except the one elected to the presidency. History shows that men have declined to run for the vice presi dency because they believed their chances for first place would be better by keeping out of the vice presidential office but that time seems to be past. The people of Plattsmouth owe a deDt of graditude to the head managers of the Fourth of July celebration- They are leaving nothing undone that will add to the interest of the immense crowd of people that will come here to witness the greatest celebration ever before known in Cass county. If the weather is favorable fully 15,000 peo ple will visit Plattsmouth on that mem orable date. Democratic success in Nebraska this year depends a great deal upon the sober judgement in the selection of a state ticket. We should not place any dead weight upon the shoulders of Mr. Bryan. For a man to insist upon a nomination simply with the expectation of Mr. Bryan's popularity carrying him through, should not be tolerated. We can win a complete victory, but not with some men upon the ticket who are pressing their claims for the nomina tion. E. O. Garrett, of Fremont wants the democratic nomination for Lieutenant Governor, and as he is well qualified for the position, and an awful fine gentle man, the Journal thinks he should have it. He is n traveling salesman, nr.d by his genial manners has won the favor with the de.Tiocrat3 all over Ne braska. He has been a resi-lent of the Ktntc f r twenty-Vive years and has al- ways been greatly interested in the success of the party with which he has always affiliated. He is a graduate of Peru normal school and school principal for ten years. With such a record, he should have no trouble in securing the endorsement of the democrats of the state. Hurrah for Garrett! Who will be Mr.- Bryan's running mate? That is the matter to settle now, and there is plenty of good mater ial to select from, too. The new republican national commit tee to be named next week will start the campaign with a big wad of the money which Cortelyou and other wick ed partners of Roosevelt got from life insurance policy holders four years ago and which these same wicked partners would not give back, though the pres ident, with tears and a wink in his eye, begged them to make restitution. Good Democratic Reading Here are some of the things the Phil idelphia North American, a republican newspaper, says of the new currency law: \"This law will mean the turning over of the treasury of the United States to the gamblers of the New York stock .exchange for a period of six years. \"It will mean the making of 'good times' and 'bad times,' of 'bull' markets according to the pleasure of Rogers and Rockefeller in the National City bank and J. P. Morgan in the National Bank of Commerce. \"It will mean not the slow and cer tain movements of contraction and in flation by' the natural laws of commerce, but sharp charges forced at will by the master gamblers. \"It will mean the gift to the chief enemies of the nation of the power to issue or retire half a billion of dollars, exciting speculation or compelling dis aster according to whichever suits their betting book. \"What the effect will be upon the coming elections we do not know. We do not know what measure of punish ment a long-suffering people will inflict upon their betrayers.\" The Politicians Will Intelligent foreign observers watching a great American party in the process of choosing of its own free will its pres idential candidate received an interest ing object lesson in the doings of the republican national committee, says the New York Evening Post. A Taft senator from Massachusetts, figuring as the representative from the Philippines, two paid Taft employes sitting for North Dakota and Alaska, and the salaried Taft manager, Hitchcock, voicing the needs of New Mexico, lent precisely that broad cosmopolitan air to the Taft boom it so sorely needs. If there are those who would hesitate over the fact that these men are sitting by virtue of proxies, that we submit merely illustrates the spontaneity of the episode; of those who protest that, be ing paid Taft boomers, at least three of them are not in a frame of mind to pass judicially on matters affecting Mr. Taft, we ask what would you? Has not the fiat gone forth that he shall be nominat ed in response to the overwhelming de mand of the White house democracy? And if the foreign observers object that this looks very much like stacking the cards in advance, we would remind them that this is the game of politics, and that the object is to obtain one's end by any stratagem, and that the end, of course, justifies the means. No one need worry about any discon tent on the part of the American people or that section of it called republicans, They have long grown used to seeing the party machinery register, not their will, but the politicians'. The Thing That Tells. (The Xew York Press. Eep.), Bryan the democratic candidate, is getting the nomination from democratic states. That is the thing that will tell on election day. Because the will of the democratic voters is being enforced as to the convention, they will give Bryan the democratic electoral college votes in Nevember. The republican party cannot make a worse mistake than to take comfort out of the oppossition to Bryan of a Standard Oil's Guffey in a republican state like Pennsylvania. What we want to do is to look to affairs in our own household, where we have riot striven to satisfy the voters of republi can state? as the democrats are fulfill ing the wishes of the democratic states. President Roosevelt is absolutely right in his judgement that the strongest man whom the democrats could nominate is Williams Jennings Bryan, because he is a candidate whom the voting members of his party in democratic and doubtfu states want at the head of their ticket. Because, furthermore, as a democrat he leads the radicalism which as a republi can President Roosevelt leads. And the people of the United States, as nobody can know better than Mr. Roosevelt in possession of the immeasurable power which he exercises through his leader ship of that radicalism, are as resolved upon a radical program today as they were when they elected their present chief magistrate four years ago. HOY TO CHOOSE LIFE'S WORK Address by C. A. Rawls at Presby terian Christain Endeavor Last Evening. Last evening C. A. Rawls addressed the Christian Endeavor at the Presby terian church on the subject of how to choose life's work. Owing to the bad weather which pre vailed, the crowd was not large, though the address was of a very interesting nature and was handled by Mr. Rawls' in a way which showed he had given a great deal of thought on the subject. In his talk he showed how it was possi ble to choose one's life work although circumstances might be adverse. In this day anyone, with ordinary power, and with a determination to succeed in any line whatever that may be can do so. It is the making of a decision as to what one shall do and then bending what powers one has to the bringing about of the objects coveted. He. offered many citations and examples of men and women, who have won dis tinction and claimed success at the end by applying themselves and employing the opportunities which was presented. It is work and determination to ac complish which brings success, irrespec tive of the obstacles in the way, for sometimes they are a help instead of a hindrance.

Mrs. Addie Frances Bradford, who has been staying at the Masonic Home for some time, died at 6 o'clock last evening at that place. She had been in her usual health, and was down stairs in the parlor during the afternoon, and but a short time before her death had said to the nurse, Miss Maynard, that she would go up and lie down, and would like a cup of tea.

Nelson, of Naples, Maine, says in a recent letter:\"I have used Dr. King's New Discovery many years, for coughs and colds, and I think it saved my life. I have found it a reliable rem edy for throat and lung complaint, and would no more be without a bottle than I would be without food.\" For nearly forty years New Discovery has stood at the head of throat and lung remedies.
