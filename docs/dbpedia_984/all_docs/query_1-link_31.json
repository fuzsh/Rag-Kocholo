        "text": "We spent a lot of time in this room in the evenings. Mr. Kennedy was president of a bank and this was his one opportunity to read the newspaper or his favorite detective stories. He would sit in that red chair by the gateleg table. We all read the Boston Transcript in the evenings in those days. Papers only cost a penny. Usually, I would sit in the wing chair there by the table opposite him. I can't see that chair without remembering the holes in the children's stockings. They wore knickers then and the boys' knee stockings always had holes in them. They had to be darned once or twice a week.\n\nWhen the children were ready for bed and had said their prayers they would come to the living room and play for a little while before we put them to bed. Usually after the children were tucked in, Mr. Kennedy and I would take a long walk. It was an hour we both enjoyed.\n\nI spent a good deal of time reading to the children from books carefully selected from a list submitted by the school twice a year or from the Women's Industrial Union. I remember that I would make no engagements outside in the evening so that I could be with the children to help them with their school work, to doctor their colds, or to find out what activities they had been interested in during the day.\n\nThe piano was a wedding gift and at Christmas, with the tree over there by the south window, I would play and we would all sing Christmas carols. The children did not do too well with their piano lessons. Radio was a new thing then and they said that people wouldn't want to listen to them play when they could hear the same songs on the radio.\n\nThe pictures are copies of famous paintings I had studied in the European galleries. It gave me great pleasure to have these copies in my home and I thought it an inspiration for the children to grow up with them.\n\nNow shall we go upstairs to the master bedroom? On the way you may want to take notice of the old-fashioned telephone in the hall.\n\nEILEEN MCNAMARA: Here we are, we're still at the Beals Street house. And this is Joe with young Joe, right?\n\nTOM FITZGERALD: Young Joe.\n\nEILEEN MCNAMARA: The oldest child, who of course was tragically lost during World War II. And this is a gorgeous photograph of Rose with her oldest son. You can tell, a very casual photograph; she just sort of rolled out of bed [laughter] and they shot this. Lovely. I have lot of those in my family collection. [laughter] And this is the President, I believe. This is John Fitzgerald Kennedy. And this is Dad with the two boys, also charmingly outfitted in the way we all dressed our children.\n\nTOM FITZGERALD: And wore shirts and ties to the beach.\n\nEILEEN MCNAMARA: Shirts and ties to the beach, there we are. There are some photographs coming up that you'll love. I love the head gear; the head gear is particularly … There we are. [laughter] That may be my favorite. I think my mother had a hat like that. So here they are, and you're looking at Brookline, and it isn't very built up. You hear her talking about the fresh air and taking the children out to air. You were taking them out to air them. It's not quite like that anymore.\n\nThen they moved around the corner to Abbottsford Street for a bigger house, because the brood got bigger.\n\nHere we are with just the first three. So we've got Joe and Jack and Rosemary. Beautiful, beautiful pictures. And here we are, kids. One of these, I think, is a neighborhood buddy.\n\nThese are great. And this is at the Beals Street house, I believe.\n\nAnd this is a great photograph of John Fitzgerald Kennedy as a young boy. And if he doesn't look like everybody's Irish kid brother in that photograph, I don't know who does.\n\nAnd this is on the day of his First Communion. And I'm stumped– oh, I think it's Pat. That's Pat.\n\nAnd here we are, clowning around. So this one wasn't posed, staged. That's quite an outfit.\n\nAnd maybe we could stop here. I think we have a succession of photographs here that might be in Hull. Your grandfather, Honey Fitz, had a home in Hull. And the Kennedy kids -- and I've got to believe all the Fitzgerald kids -- were down there frequently. Can you tell us about that house?\n\nTOM FITZGERALD: Well, it's still there. It's an enormously lovely house. In the past ten years, two different people bought the house to fix it up and both of them turned out to be crooks who were put in jail [laughter], in turn. I'm not sure who owns the house now, but it is still there.\n\nThere is a house across the road that is on the water in Hull that, according to the story, Grandpa Fitz built it for Rose as a dollhouse. It's as nice a house as I probably would ever live in.\n\nEILEEN MCNAMARA: So you haven't checked the lineage of any of those crooks. They're not called Curley, are they, by any chance?\n\nTOM FITZGERALD: No. They did have an ethnic name, but in the spirit of the evening, I am not going to mention which one it was. But I'm sure it's at this time when Grandpa began his habit of going in the water and sitting in seaweed. He thought medicinally it was good for him. And as kids, someone was always sent with him when he wanted to sit in the water and enjoy the seaweed.\n\nEILEEN MCNAMARA: Enjoy the seaweed. It's quite an image.\n\nTOM FITZGERALD: It is quite an image.\n\nEILEEN MCNAMARA: That I'll spend the rest of the evening trying to dispel from my mind.\n\nHere we have a dog. We have more dogs in the Kennedy family. This is the President and one of his dogs. You'll see in all these photographs, they come in all shapes and sizes, and they obviously had multiple dogs at any given time.\n\nHere we are, I think we're in Hyannis Port now. I've think we've moved even further south. So it was 1928? Earlier. '25, I think, that Joe, Jr., Joe Kennedy, Sr., rented what was called the Malcolm Cottage in Hyannis Port, and then bought it a few years later for his family and then proceeded to renovate it repeatedly to enlarge it to accommodate them all. Because it was, like Topsy, a family that grew.\n\nHere they are. Now, did the Fitzgeralds dress with matching headgear like the Kennedys did?\n\nTOM FITZGERALD: [laughter] I don't think we could afford that many hats. [laughter]\n\nEILEEN MCNAMARA: My guess is that she got a deal on them because the hats all match and so do the little dresses on the girls.\n\nAnd here we are. This is a classic seaside picture, right? Aren't these terrific?\n\nThis is one of my favorites. Now, you know this is spontaneous. Most of these photographs, you'll see that the Kennedy kids all line up in chronological order. No one tells them to do it; it just sort of works out that way. [laughter]\n\nThis is a particular photograph that's a favorite of mine, because I'm working on a biography of Eunice Kennedy Shriver. I love this photograph because you have the three oldest children on one side of the children, Joe and Jack and Rosemary and Kick, who is not the oldest; Rosemary is the oldest girl. But you have Rosemary partnered with Eunice. And so these three as they grew, Kick and Joe and Jack, were like the Three Musketeers, I gather, hanging out together and getting into mischief. And Rosemary and Eunice formed an immediate bond in their childhood that continued all of their lives.\n\nSo that photograph is particularly special, I think.\n\nThis is a classic. Tell me that you had, the Fitzgeralds had bathing outfits like that.\n\nTOM FITZGERALD: Cahn't recall.\n\nEILEEN MCNAMARA: Cahn't recall that, no?\n\nTOM FITZGERALD: No. That was a remark my grandfather made when he was called before an investigative bureau in the City of Boston. He was accused of stealing coal from the city in his first term and giving it to poor people. And when he was called before the grand jury and they'd ask him a question, his answer frequently was, \"Cahn't recall.\"\n\nEILEEN MCNAMARA: I should point out to the audience, they can't see it, but you are wearing a campaign button from 1906, of Fitzgerald for Mayor. He served, as you know, most of you I'm sure, he served as Mayor twice and also held the Congressional seat that John F. Kennedy later occupied. And who do we have here?\n\nTOM FITZGERALD: That's Bobby.\n\nEILEEN MCNAMARA: Here we are, again, matching dresses.\n\nTOM FITZGERALD: When I see these pictures, I'm always stunned at their orderliness when I think of the problem I had of taking pictures of my two sons and a dog for a Christmas card. [laughter]\n\nEILEEN MCNAMARA: Again, a new dog. I don't think it was happenstance. The Kennedys, if they were known for anything, they were known for image management, and this is all part of that talent.\n\nAnd is this their nanny with them who was– Kiko? Who was with them for years and years and years.\n\nOn the beach and now we're in Florida. The Kennedys bought a house, as you also probably know, in Palm Beach. And there they are. They often, instead of going to the beach right in front of their estate, went to The Breakers, that beautiful hotel, where the kids played on the beach.\n\nTOM FITZGERALD: There was a story about that house in Palm Beach. The house was a sanctuary for Joe Kennedy and his family. Very few people stayed there as guests; it was simply forbidden. And the exception to that rule was Grandpa and Grandma Fitzgerald, who would stay with them. And there was a story that is told that Grandpa Fitz went out to sit in the water, enjoy the seaweed [laughter], and came back in the house one day and said to Joe, \"Do you know anyone who has a shotgun?\" He said, \"Those seagulls are bothersome and I want you to find someone to shoot the gulls so I can sit in the seaweed in peace.\" [laughter] And after that request was made, Joe went back into the house and found Rose and asked her when her parents were going home. [laughter]\n\nEILEEN MCNAMARA: A reasonable request.\n\nTOM FITZGERALD: A reasonable request.\n\nEILEEN MCNAMARA: And this is Bobby and Teddy. I mean, these photographs are just precious. You can tell that these come from someone's personal collection because they're so worn.\n\nThis is a great picture that had Joe in it, because we don't see that many this late in his life because he did die in the war. But you've got Joe and Eunice is at the end.\n\nAnd here we are, you've got to have a story here. This is a classic.\n\nTOM FITZGERALD: Well, that might be just before he went home. [laughter]\n\nEILEEN MCNAMARA: I think the President had a particular affection for your grandfather, for Grandfather Fitzgerald, didn't he?\n\nTOM FITZGERALD: I think we all did. Whoever it was with Grandpa, he made you feel like you were the only child in the world, and he was happy to be with you. But that story about the seagulls, Grandpa had a way, I think, of tweaking Joe Kennedy from time to time. When he was the Ambassador to the Court of St. James, Grandpa and Grandma went to London to visit with him, and Grandpa took the opportunity to use embassy stationery and write notes to all of his pals in Boston inviting them over for a cup of tea. [laughter]\n\nEILEEN MCNAMARA: Maybe not tea.\n\nTOM FITZGERALD: Maybe not tea.\n\nEILEEN MCNAMARA: And I think that we're probably in St. Moritz or somewhere on their winter holidays where they often went skiing.\n\nAnd this is the house in Bronxville, where they're sledding in the backyard.\n\nAnd is this the photograph that's got Bobby with the bunnies? Bobby Kennedy raised bunny rabbits and sold them. All had a very entrepreneurial spirit.\n\nAnd this, of course, is the classic photograph from when they arrived in London, when Joseph P. Kennedy became the Ambassador to the Court of St. James.\n\nAnd this is in Rome when he was Ambassador. And most significant, the young man who would become the senior Senator from Massachusetts, Edward Kennedy, he received his First Holy Communion from the Pope on this visit.\n\nAnd this is our bathing beauty, the family archivist. I'm told that this picture did not make the book, even though it is a wonderful photograph. Because, like your grandmother, I think, they were both very conscious of their shape, and all their lives stayed in tremendous physical condition and looked beautiful as a result.\n\nAnd this is the dedication of the Joseph P. Kennedy, Jr. – was it a destroyer?\n\nTOM FITZGERALD: It was a destroyer.\n\nEILEEN MCNAMARA: Was it a destroyer? And you'll see there, in the big, broad-brimmed hat is Jean Kennedy, later Jean Kennedy Smith, who dedicated the warship because Joe, Jr., was her godfather.\n\nAnd here are the boys with Dad.\n\nThis one looks really spontaneous. I think they were just climbing that tree and Bachrach wandered by and said, \"Could I take a shot?\" [laughter]\n\nThis one might be a little bit more spontaneous. You see Joe, the father, coming in through the entryway there.\n\nThere's your Officer and a Gentleman photograph. And this, I believe, is from Mrs. Onassis's private collection that Caroline, Ambassador Kennedy, got into this book, which is a lovely picture.\n\nAnd another mutt. [laughter]\n\nAnd you'll recognize what the occasion for this is.\n\nTOM FITZGERALD: The '46 election of the President as a Congressman from the district that Grandpa Fitz had held before he became Mayor of Boston.\n\nEILEEN MCNAMARA: So we have a Kennedy succeeding to a seat once held by a Fitzgerald, who didn't get to be there for the swearing-in, but sent his regards.\n\nHere we are. There's Honey Fitz and Josie after the election. And here's his Western Union. I think you can read it. Can you? I love the way that he ends this, suggesting that this young man's going to make a name for himself and we'll all know his name some day. Which as it happens, indeed we do. That's great.\n\nI can't believe that you don't have questions. We have the repository of family history here. And we have two microphones on either side, so if you have questions about just what it was like. We talk a lot about the history of the Kennedy family and the Fitzgerald family because it's so big a history of Boston. But these are wonderful photographs about family life. And even the ones where everybody's impeccably dressed and perfectly arranged, there is a lot of spontaneity as well.\n\nDon't be shy! You're Bostonians! Yes, ma'am?\n\nQUESTION: How many children were in Rose's family?\n\nTOM FITZGERALD: Nine.\n\nEILEEN MCNAMARA: Oh, brothers and sisters, not her children.\n\nTOM FITZGERALD: There were six, three boys and three girls.\n\nEILEEN MCNAMARA: And Rose was the oldest, was she not?\n\nTOM FITZGERALD: Yes.\n\nEILEEN MCNAMARA: And tell us about her sisters.\n\nTOM FITZGERALD: Agnes, then my father and Jack, and Fred, and then Eunice. Fred died quite young, as did Eunice.\n\nEILEEN MCNAMARA: Eunice was only in her 20s when she died. And of course, Eunice Kennedy Shriver was named after Rose's sister.\n\nTOM McNAUGHT: So I forgot in the introduction to mention the anniversary of the Boston Red Sox and Fenway Park. So I was wondering if Tom might tell the audience that story, of throwing out the pitch with Mayor Menino and Caroline Kennedy to celebrate your grandfather.\n\nTOM FITZGERALD: Well, it was, as we might say, the luck of the Irish. Grandpa Fitzgerald threw out the first pitch when Fenway was opened on April 22, 1912. So when the anniversary came to be, and they were trying to decide who might be involved in first pitch ceremonies, the Red Sox had asked Caroline to be involved and Mayor Menino. And then in a conversation with the Red Sox, around tickets for the game, the person I was speaking with said, \"Who is the oldest living grandchild of Honey Fitz's who has the name Fitzgerald?\" And I said, \"You're talking to him.\" [laughter] And my cousin, Bob Fitzgerald, who is the only other cousin who has the Fitzgerald name, is six months to the day younger than I am. So I had to call him and tell him he didn't make the cut. [laughter]\n\nEILEEN MCNAMARA: They're a competitive crew on the Fitzgerald side, apparently, as well as the Kennedy side.\n\nQUESTION: Tom, can you share, what are your memories of Rose? What was she like?\n\nTOM FITZGERALD: She was absolutely one of the most gracious people you'd ever want to meet, a woman who made you feel comfortable, regardless of the circumstances that you might be around her in. She had not only from the photographs but from the records of her children, she had an amazing sense of history and tried to bring people into that history when possible. She kept good tabs on you. She wanted to know what you've read, what you were doing. I thought it was remarkable that with her own extended family that she had an interest in other family members as well.\n\nIn fact, just before I was married, The Sound of Music opened here in Boston, prior to its Broadway debut, and she called and asked if I would be her escort to see The Sound of Music. And I said, \"Oh, sure.\" So we went and I said, as we sat down, \"Gee, Aunt Rose, these are great seats.\" And she said, \"They're Richard Rodger's house seats.\" I said, \"Oh.\" [laughter] Then a woman tapped her on the shoulder and said, \"Oh, Mrs. Kennedy, I'm whoever and I met you last year,\" and she was gracious as she could be . And then she turned to me and she said, \"You simply can't wear a dress twice.\" [laughter]\n\nEILEEN MCNAMARA: And I hope you have followed that rule.\n\nTOM FITZGERALD: Oh, I paid close attention.\n\nEILEEN MCNAMARA: Even in Colorado.\n\nTOM FITZGERALD: Even in Colorado. But she was just that warm. Grandma Fitzgerald lived in her last few years in the house I grew up in in Dorchester, and my Aunt Rose would be a frequent visitor to come by and see her mom.\n\nEILEEN MCNAMARA: Well, she was the belle of Dorchester, wasn't she, Rose, growing up?\n\nTOM FITZGERALD: She was, indeed. She got her high school diploma from my grandfather from Dorchester Girls High School.\n\nEILEEN MCNAMARA: She had a coming out party. Was it at that same house?\n\nTOM FITZGERALD: It was the house on Welles Avenue, where Grandpa lived. And that was the home where she had her wedding reception. There's a picture of it in the Grandpa Stories book. And to give you a sense of scale – my niece is here – when they tore down that house, her dad, who was a builder, built three houses on that lot.\n\nEILEEN MCNAMARA: So it was quite a large house.\n\nTOM FITZGERALD: It was quite a large house. There's an interesting book called The Streets of Dorchester. A fellow by the name of Sheehan wrote it a number of years ago, and it was his growing up in Dorchester. His father had a drinking problem, so they never lived in the same house for more than 12 to 18 months. But one of the houses that they lived in, it was after my grandfather had moved out of Welles Avenue, he tells the story of going over and stealing the lumber off the front steps in order to heat the house that night.\n\nEILEEN MCNAMARA: Well, the Kennedy children that we're all familiar with, Rose's children and Joe's children, were all much older than you were.\n\nTOM FITZGERALD: Yes, they are.\n\nEILEEN MCNAMARA: So you were all cousins, but you didn't grow up in the same …\n\nTOM FITZGERALD: No. And you can imagine, when you're ten years old and someone is 25, they're like parents, they're so old.\n\nEILEEN MCNAMARA: A different universe.\n\nTOM FITZGERALD: Yeah. And as you grow older, that gaps …\n\nEILEEN MCNAMARA: Starts to narrow.\n\nTOM FITZGERALD: … starts to narrow.\n\nEILEEN MCNAMARA: I saw a hand go up.\n\nQUESTION: I was going to ask if you were ever injured in the competition sports the Kennedys were famous for. I guess not if there was that age gap.\n\nTOM FITZGERALD: No, but I will tell you that one time some of my pals from Dorchester and I did drive down to Hyannis Port to see the house, and they were playing touch football. And we won. [laughter]\n\nEILEEN MCNAMARA: Can you say that at the Kennedy Library? [laughter] Yes, sir?\n\nQUESTION: I was wondering about the church Rose was most fond of in Dorchester. What parish did she …\n\nTOM FITZGERALD: They would have, at that time, they would have been in St. Mark's. Where I lived was St. Brendan's.\n\nEILEEN MCNAMARA: If memory serves, the parishes in Dorchester are about as competitive as the Kennedys. [laughter] We're probably on dangerous turf here, too. Was there somebody over here? Come on, you're not that shy.\n\nQUESTION: How many cousins were there total?\n\nTOM FITZGERALD: I think there were 19 in total, Fitzgerald cousins, Gargans and the Kennedys; there were nine Kennedys, three Gargans, three Fitzgerald cousins and four in my family.\n\nEILEEN MCNAMARA: And the Gargan family wound up being really part of Rose's own family because he died tragically young, didn't he?\n\nTOM FITZGERALD: They did. And in fact, the Gargan kids went to live with an uncle in Lowell. But in the summer, they would spend a lot of time in Hyannis Port with the other kids.\n\nGrandpa Fitzgerald loved to spend time with his grandkids, but with the Gargan kids being in Lowell, it was a good distance. And even though he had a charge account with a Boston cab company, it was just a long way to travel. So when Grandpa was in his late 70s, he had a habit of going to a local car dealership in Boston and say, \"I think it's time for me to learn how to drive. And I need a safe car for my wife and me.\" And so, the salesman would say, \"Oh, John F., of course.\" So he'd say, \"Let's go for a spin.\" So Grandpa would get in the car and they'd drive around the city of Boston, and then Grandpa would say, \"You know, I think this needs a better road test,\" and he said, \"Let's go to Lowell.\" [laughter] And he would go by and pick up Grandma and they'd drive to Lowell and he'd have his visit and then come back to Boston and tell the car dealer salesman that he'd keep this car in mind. [laughter] And he never did learn to drive.\n\nEILEEN MCNAMARA: He never did, actually, ever learn to drive?\n\nTOM FITZGERALD: No. Didn't have to.\n\nEILEEN MCNAMARA: Well, exactly, why would you have to? Yes, sir?\n\nQUESTION: A sense of service was a key thing in the Kennedy side; was it equally key in the Fitzgerald side?\n\nEILEEN MCNAMARA: The sense of service, public service. Well, we're sitting beside a teacher, an educator. I think it's true.\n\nTOM FITZGERALD: I'm not quite sure how to answer that. But I think when you model expectations, the sense of service is there, whatever it may be.\n\nQUESTION: The death of Honey Fitz and the funeral -- what's your memory of that?\n\nTOM FITZGERALD: Well, I remember the night that Grandpa died. He called my father and said, \"I'm dying, you need to get into the Bellevue.\" And my dad came in and woke up my older brother Jack and said, \"We need to go in to Boston, Grandpa's dying.\" And he died, and we had the wake at the house in Dorchester. As you can imagine, it was a litany of public figures that were familiar to everyone. In fact, I remember Congressman McCormack when he walked in the door, I said, \"There's himself,\" and it was the first time I had ever used that expression.\n\nEILEEN MCNAMARA: You had come of age as an Irishman.\n\nTOM FITZGERALD: I had come of age, I could use that expression.\n\nEILEEN MCNAMARA: And the Bellevue, so your grandfather was living at the Bellevue at that time.\n\nTOM FITZGERALD: Yes.\n\nEILEEN MCNAMARA: And as you history buffs will remember, John F. Kennedy's presidential campaign used the Bellevue as a kind of …\n\nTOM FITZGERALD: Well, there was an apartment building right around the corner.\n\nEILEEN MCNAMARA: Sort of in honor of your grandfather.\n\nTOM FITZGERALD: Yep. Well, it was a perfect place for Grandpa, because he ate in the dining room every day and he could say hi and hello to everyone he knew, and even people he didn't know. It was just the way he was.\n\nQUESTION: We all remember where we were that November day in 1963. Where were you?\n\nTOM FITZGERALD: I was teaching in Colorado, at Colorado Academy, and a student came and got me out of my classroom. He said, \"Your wife is on the phone,\" and my son Tim, who's here, was six months old and I thought, oh, he fell off something and needs to go to the doctor. And she said, \"I don't know how to tell you this, but the President's been shot.\" That's how I found out.\n\nEILEEN MCNAMARA: Do you remember what you did? Did you go back to your classroom?\n\nTOM FITZGERALD: I did.\n\nEILEEN MCNAMARA: Did you help the students get through that?\n\nTOM FITZGERALD: No, I said, \"I need to go home.\" I said, \"The President's been shot, I need to go home.\" And left.\n\nEILEEN MCNAMARA: Did it come back pretty vividly for you this last month as everybody was commemorating the anniversary of that terrible day?\n\nTOM FITZGERALD: Anniversaries are always sad; joyous and sad – joyous at what the President had given the country; sad that we'd never know what might have been, wrapped around that group of conspiracy theories. And so it's kind of choosing the audience you want to be a part of at those moments in time.\n\nIn fact, in the town of Bruff, on the anniversary, the Bishop of Limerick came to the church of St. Peter and Paul in this small town to have the anniversary Mass. I saw my great-grandfather's baptismal record in Bruff, 1823, in the record book. I can tell you whoever kept those records was not left-handed. They were very readable. It looked like a lesson out of the Palmer Method, those of you who are old enough to remember penmanship in school. It was extraordinary.\n\nEILEEN MCNAMARA: All you Catholic school students, raise your hand. [laughter] Well, that's interesting because Rose, I think, inherited that quality from the Fitzgerald side of the family. Not only was her penmanship lovely, but she was the family historian; she made sure that there was a record kept of everything, from the children's illnesses to their report cards. I mean, this building may fall down, she saved so much paper in the course of her life.\n\nTOM FITZGERALD: As I said, she had that sense of history. She wrote me a letter one time thanking me for a note that I had sent her, and that she had to keep the note short because she was on her way to Paris. It was typed, but at the bottom and in her handwriting, she said, \"I think you need to say,\" and she gave me a grammar lesson that related back to the note that I had written her. She said, \"Don't be embarrassed, I've had words with a couple of Senators and a President as well.\" [laughter]\n\nEILEEN MCNAMARA: So now you know what the subjunctive tense is as well as never to wear the same dress twice.\n\nTOM FITZGERALD: Yes, right. Subjunctive pluperfect.\n\nEILEEN MCNAMARA: Subjunctive pluperfect, lessons from my Aunt Rose. Anyone else?\n\nYes, ma'am.\n\nQUESTION: What did your father do for a living?\n\nTOM FITZGERALD: He had a career in business. He owned a chocolate milk factory at one time. He worked for the city. He was a street commissioner at a time. He was with the Veterans Bureau at one time. He was a toll collector on the Mystic River Bridge at one time. So he had a rich and varied career.\n\nQUESTION: What did you do?\n\nTOM FITZGERALD: I taught science, I taught history, I taught a course on children. I taught second-graders, middle schoolers, high school kids, college kids, graduate students. I don't know if any of you are familiar with the Education Development Center that's here in Cambridge and Newton. I did a lot of work with them in the '70s and '80s, putting programs in schools in the West.\n\nEILEEN MCNAMARA: About developmental issues?\n\nTOM FITZGERALD: No, it was a lot of different stuff. It was an age of national curriculums, whether it was science or math or social studies, the kind of thing that you don't see anymore.\n\nEILEEN MCNAMARA: As a lifelong educator, when you look at this rich family history, what are the lessons for parents about raising children that you see?\n\nTOM FITZGERALD: Have help. [laughter]\n\nEILEEN MCNAMARA: Have help! On that note, have lots and lots of help. [applause]\n\nEILEEN MCNAMARA: So we want to let you know that Mr. Fitzgerald has graciously agreed to sign copies of his own book, if you were thinking about picking up a copy of Rose Kennedy's Family Album tonight. Thank you so much for coming. [applause]\n\nTHE END"
