        "text": "University of Galway\n\nUniversity of Galway (previously known as the National University of Ireland, Galway) was founded in 1849. Today, it’s one of Ireland's most prestigious teaching and research institutions. Situated on the banks of the River Corrib, near Galway’s center, the university features a mix of historic and modern buildings. More than 17,000 students attend classes on the lovely 260-acre campus, with more over 1,000 international students per year. Here, you’ll integrate into the Irish student population and choose courses from more than 50 departments, including arts, law, commerce, and science. Courses consist of small seminars and tutorial sessions; many combine both, allowing you the opportunity to get to know your individual disciplines and work together with other students. In addition to enjoying the excellent academics offered at the University of Galway, you will have access to a wide variety of clubs and societies, computer labs, library, recreation halls and gym, student center, and guidance from the International Education Office. The relaxed, friendly atmosphere at the University of Galway makes for a thoroughly enjoyable and holistic study abroad experience.\n\nCredit Transfer Information\n\nUniversity of Galway awards credits based on the European Credit Transfer System (ECTS) system. CEA CAPA credit hour recommendations are based on the following conversion: 2 ECTS credits equals 1 U.S. semester credit. Credit transfer is ultimately determined by your home university. Please consult with an academic advisor at your home university on credit pre-approval guidelines.\n\nTranscript Information\n\nStudents receive a transcript from the University of Galway upon successful completion of the program. The transcript will reflect ECTS credits.\n\nAccreditation\n\nThe University of Galway is accredited by the National University of Ireland, a federal University. It's Business School is also accredited by the Association to Advance Collegiate Schools of Business (AACSB) and the Association for MBA programs (AMBA).\n\nGrading\n\nGrade conversions from CEA CAPA partner institutions abroad to a US grading scale are determined in consultation with our School of Record and benchmarked with other peer institutions in the field.\n\nPlease note that CEA CAPA can only recommend grade conversions to students’ home institutions—it is ultimately at the discretion of the home institution to convert grades from abroad to students’ academic records.\n\nFor further information or details about grade conversion for a particular host institution, please reach out to our Registrar at registrar@ceacapa.com.\n\nClassroom and Information\n\nInternational faculty from the University of Galway will teach your elective courses.\n\nPeriodic exams, homework assignments, and final exams will be administered.\n\nAttendance in some classes is mandatory and monitored by professors.\n\nTeaching styles in Ireland may be different from those found in the U.S. or Canada. Be prepared to adapt to different classroom structures and coursework expectations for your school.\n\nClass size ranges between 15 and 30 students for upper division courses, and between 50 and 300 students for lectures.\n\nYou will be in class with CEA CAPA participants, other international students, and Irish students.\n\nAmenities\n\nStudent Offices\n\nClubs & Organizations\n\nStudent Government\n\nStudent Center\n\nStudent Lounge\n\nStudy Room\n\nCounseling Services\n\nStudent Health Center\n\nUniversity Library\n\nComputer Lab\n\nPrinting Facilities\n\nStudent ID\n\nMulti-Media\n\nInternet Access & Wi-Fi\n\nCareer Services\n\nAcademic Advising\n\nTutoring\n\nLanguage Learning Services\n\nFitness Facilities\n\nStudent Sports Teams\n\nCultural Engagement\n\nDining Facilities\n\nBanks & Post Office\n\nCopy & Mail Center\n\nOn-campus ATM\n\nBookstore\n\nLockers\n\nChaplaincy\n\nMuseum & Art Galleries\n\nStudent Residence Apartment\n\nAvailable:\n\nSemester\n\nSummer\n\nStudent residence apartments cater to the independent, do-it-yourself type students who want to experience Galway just as the locals do. Cook tasty Irish meals with your roommates in your kitchen, explore the personality of the neighborhood that surrounds you and make your new residence apartment a home. Semester students are placed in student residence apartments located in the town center, while students on summer programs are placed in student residence apartments located near the University of Galway campus.

Exact amount will be confirmed on the housing application form.\n\nSemester (private room): $1,200 - $1,900\n\nShared room: No additional fee\n\nDownload Overview\n\nIndependent Living\n\nWhile CEA CAPA highly recommends that you choose one of our Galway housing options provided, you also have the option to arrange independent housing. If your ideal housing scenario includes living in a particular neighborhood, having specific amenities or living with a specific person as your roommate, then independent housing could be just the ticket for you.\n\nUse the online housing application form to request permission for this option no later than the application closure date. If your request is approved, you will receive a rebate for your housing payment, however CEA CAPA will not provide you with any assistance setting up independent housing. Keep in mind, rebates are not granted to students who move out of their CEA CAPA housing or choose to pursue independent living arrangements after the application closure date.\n\nTypical Commute\n\nN/A\n\nMeals Included\n\nN/A\n\nRoommates\n\nN/A\n\nUnit Amenities\n\nN/A"
