        "text": "Trinity was founded in 1592 by Queen Elizabeth 1st on grounds confiscated from an Augustinian priory and is the oldest University in Ireland. The Campanile, erected in 1852, was built on what is believed to be the centre of the monastery. Built to further the education of the ruling Anglo-Irish families, restrictions were imposed to prevent Catholic from attending courses.\n\nThese restrictions were not fully lifted until the 1970’s. Trinity however admitted women in 1902, earlier than most British universities. Most of the main buildings off the main square were built during the Georgian period, some of which replaced older buildings. Within its walls, you will be able to admire Parliament Square and its 18th Century edifices. Trinity College has had many famous students such as Jonathan Swift and Samuel Beckett who later became a lecturer in French at the university. The Inter-denominational Church is very much worth a visit, should it be open during your v​isit.\n\nThe Book of Kells dates back to the 9th century and is one of the most famous medieval manuscripts in the world. It is one of the main attractions in Dublin. Thomas Burgh built the Old Library building in the 18th century. Today it houses one of Irelands most illustrious books, the 9th century “Book of Kells”. Before viewing the famous book visitors pass through an excellent exhibition based on the book of Kells and other important books written in monasteries around Ireland from the 9th century. After viewing the book of Kells visitors are invited to visit the long room built in 1745. Once the principal library of the University, it now contains over twenty thousand books and manuscripts of the Trinity’s oldest volumes. Brian Boru’s harp said to be the “ oldest harp in Ireland” and a copy of the 1916 proclamation, one of the most important documents relating to Irish history are also on display in the long room.\n\nSt Patrick’s is the National Cathedral of Ireland and is built on the site where St Patrick preached. There was a small church on the site which was still in existence when the when the Anglo-Normans arrived. This church was replaced with a stone church in 1191 and it was further remodeled in 1225 to the same design as Salisbury Cathedral. Ireland's first university was founded at St. Patrick's in 1320 and intermittently operated for 200 years. St Patrick’s is Gothic in style and it’s splendid interior, is adorned with funeral monuments, such as The Boyle Family Memorial and the grave of Dean Jonathan Swift. Swift was dean here until his death in 1745. The Chancel has ornate stained-glass windows, and spectacular choir stalls, once used by the knights of St Patrick adjoin the Altar. The massive west towers, houses a large peal of bells whose ringing tones are so much part of the character of Dublin.\n\nBuilt in 1796, Kilmainham Jail has witnessed many of the events leading to Irish independence. It has housed many patriots taken prisoner during the many rebellions witnessed in Ireland ~ from the United Irish Rebellion of 1796 to those prisoners taken during the Irish Civil War. While opened initially as a jail for all offences, it became intrinsically linked with Irish Nationalism. The jail has two main areas of cells, and several exercise yards, one of which was used for executing the leaders of the 1916 Easter Rising. The original wing dating from the opening of the jail is incredibly dark and oppressive. The later Victorian wing with its wide walkways and toplit main hall paved the way for new thinking in designs of jails in the 19th century. Touching in so many ways on the people and forces that shaped modern Ireland, Kilmainham Jail offers a panoramic insight into some of the most profound, disturbing and inspirational themes of modern Irish history. A must for visitors interested in Irish history.\n\nWith free admission and described by the Lonely Planet as not just the best museum in Ireland, but one of the best in Europe, the Chester Beatty Library is a must-see on any Dublin visitor's itinerary. As the only museum in Ireland to win 'European Museum of the Year' and rated at number 2 in Trip Advisor’s list of recommended Dublin cultural attractions, the library's rich collections from countries across Asia, the Middle East, North Africa and Europe open a window on the artistic treasures of the great cultures and religions of the world. Alfred Chester Beatty was a bibliophile who was both rich and blessed with exceedingly good taste. The fruit of his extensive labours (ancient books, scrolls and other objets d’art) are gathered across two floors of the Chester Beatty Library in Dublin Castle.\n\nOur City Highlights tour is your essential guide to Dublin.
