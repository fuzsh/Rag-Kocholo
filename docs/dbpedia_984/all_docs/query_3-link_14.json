        "text": "Military engineer and architect. Thomas Burgh, who was born in Drumkeen, Co. Limerick in 1670, was the third son of the Rev. Ulysses Burgh, of Drumkeen, Dean of Emly and later Bishop of Ardagh, and his wife Mary, daughter of William Kingsmill of Ballibeg, Co. Cork. He attended Mr Delany's school in Dublin and was admitted to Trinity College, Dublin, in November 1685. He does not appear to have taken a degree, embarking instead upon a career as an engineer in the army. By his own account he was at sea with Lord Berkeley and served at Limerick, presumably at the second siege of 1690. He was commissioned captain in the Royal Regiment of Foot in 1692 and during the next three years served at the battles of Steenkerke (1692) and Landen (1693) and at the siege of Namur (1695). He is described as a 'disciple' of the distinguished Dutch military engineer, Menno van Coehoorn. In 1697, by which time he was one of the twenty-five engineers of the King's Company of Engineers, he was appointed third engineer on the Irish establishment. In July 1700 he succeeded William Robinson as Surveyor-General of Ireland. He was appointed ex-officio Barracks Overseer in Ireland in 1701 and from 1705 until 1714 also held the post of Lieutenant of the Ordnance of Ireland. He was raised to the rank of lieutenant-colonel in 1706.\n\nBurgh, who was admitted a freeman of Dublin in 1704, was responsible for the design and erection of a number of important public buildings in the city, including the Custom House, Trinity College library, Steevens's Hospital, the Linen Hall and the Royal Barracks. Engineering projects in which he interested himself included the improvement of Dublin Harbour, a colliery at Ballycastle, Co. Antrim, and the construction of a canal from Newry to Lough Neagh for the transportation of coal from the Co. Tyrone collieries. He was the author of a pamphlet on surveying, A method to determine the areas of right-lined figures (Dublin, 1724).\n\nIn addition to his architectural and engineering activities, Burgh was high sheriff of Co. Kildare in 1712 and a member of parliament for Naas, Co. Kildare, from 1713 until his death. He was a Freemason, a Governor of the Royal Hospital, Kilmainham, and a trustee of Dr Steevens's Hospital.\n\nIn 1728 Burgh, now in his middle age, suffered the disappointment of seeing the commission to design the new Parliament House in Dublin given to the much younger EDWARD LOVETT PEARCE. EDWARD LOVETT PEARCE. He died on 18 December 1730, 'after a few days sickness' and was succeeded as surveyor-general by Pearce. His books were sold in 1732.\n\nBurgh married Mary, daughter of William Smyth, Bishop of Kilmore, in 1700, and had five sons and four daughters.\n\nSee also WORKS and BIBLIOGRAPHY.
