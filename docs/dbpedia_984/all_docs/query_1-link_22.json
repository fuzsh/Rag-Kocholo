        "text": "Sometimes a headstone with a comprehensive inscription can still take a bit of unravelling. Take the one on Arabella Dunbar’s grave.\n\nIn loving memory of\n\nArabella\n\nWidow of the late\n\nDavid Dunbar\n\nSculptor\n\n(of London)\n\nWho died December 27th 1885\n\nAt New Swindon\n\nAged 77 years\n\nThine eyes shall see the King in His beauty;\n\nThey shall behold the land that is very far off.\n\nIsaiah 33\n\nSo, how did it happen that the widow of a celebrated Scottish born sculptor ended up buried in Radnor Street Cemetery?\n\nArabella Riddiford was born in Uley, Gloucestershire, the daughter of Daniel and Susanna Riddiford and was baptised at the parish church on January 8, 1809. Little is know about her life before she married David Dunbar and even this evidence is confusing.\n\nDavid Dunbar was born in 1793 in Scotland but when he married Arabella (his second wife) the details on their marriage entry are at variance with the other known facts. The couple were married at All Souls Church, St. Marylebone (where they are both described as living in the district) on July 15, 1844. David Dunbar describes himself as a widower and sculptor aged 28, the son of Stewart Dunbar a [stone] mason. Arabella Riddiford was also aged 28 a spinster the daughter of Daniel Riddiford Tea Grocer (deceased). Now by my reckoning David was at least 51 years old and Arabella 35.\n\nAt the time of the 1851 census the couple were living at David’s home, 9 Ranelagh Place and again the ages recorded are incompatible with other records.\n\nThe couple are difficult to locate on the 1861 census. They may have been living in Scotland at the time, where David died in Dumfries in 1866.\n\nA lengthy obituary was published in national newspapers in both England and Scotland. (See examples below). His life’s work was obviously more important than his private life as there is no mention of a widow or any surviving children, however there appears to have been at least one son, David Dunbar Jnr who turns up in Swindon.\n\nOn June 25, 1849 David Dunbar a bachelor of full age (that is over 21) occupation Draper, address Ranelagh Place, father David Dunbar Sculptor, married Eleanor Cogdon. The two witnesses to the wedding were John Cogdon (presumably Eleanor’s father) and Arabella Dunbar (presumably David’s mother).\n\nLater that year there is a Notice of Indenture of Assignment published in The Wilts and Gloucestershire Standard, Tuesday, January 3, 1850 (see below) which names David Dunbar, Linen and Woollen Draper of Swindon and David Dunbar, Sculptor. All this adds weight to why Arabella ended up in Swindon where she died. Or does it?\n\nThe clue to this mystery is Charles Thomas, a 5 year old boy who is visiting Arabella at the time of the 1871 census when she lived in Stonehouse, Gloucestershire.\n\nCharles Riddiford Thomas was the son of William Thomas, a beerhouse keeper, and his wife Arabella, who lived in Swindon. The couple had married at Christ Church on September 30, 1854 where we discover that Arabella’s maiden name was Riddiford and that she was the daughter of Charles Riddiford. Charles Riddiford was born in Uley, Gloucestershire the son of Daniel & Susanna Riddiford and was therefore Arabella Dunbar’s brother.\n\nAt last the connection is made between Arabella Dunbar, widow of a famous sculptor, and why she ended up buried in Radnor Street Cemetery. She was living in Swindon with her niece Arabella at the time of her death.\n\nThe entry in the burial registers record that Arabella was living at 6 High Street, New Swindon in 1885, (before it was renamed Emlyn Square). Her funeral took place on December 30, 1885 and she lies in plot A1039. The inscription on her headstone says it all, well nearly!\n\nThe facts …\n\nThe Late Mr David Dunbar, Sculptor\n\nIt is with deep regret we record the death of this genial and talented gentleman, which sad event took place here on Sabbath morning last, after a very short illness. We cannot allow so eminent a fellow-townsman to pass away without some tribute to his memory, and record of his active life.\n\nWhile serving his apprenticeship as a stone-mason with his father, he shewed symptoms of that taste for sculpture which ultimately led to the adoption of that art as his profession. So great was his reputation as an ornamental carver among the building trade that he obtained an engagement in his seventeenth year to execute the capitals and other decorative parts of Lowther Castle, then in course of erection, at a wage of 7s per day. After following for a few years this, the lightest and most elegant part of the masons’ trade, he had his early aspirations of seeing Rome and studying in Italy realised through the kindness of some friends who had long watched with sympathetic interest the budding genius of the embryo sculptor.\n\nDuring his sojourn in the “land of poetry and song,” he diligently pursued his studies in the fine arts, and on the eve of his return to England the Royal Academy of Cararra elected him a member of their body in recognition of his artistic genius – his “diploma study” being the “Sleeping Child,” a charming work, which long adorned the vestibule of St Michael’s, calling forth the admiration of countless visitors.\n\nOn his return to this country, he entered the studio of Sir Francis Chantry, where, during a number of years, his services were of great importance to that distinguished sculptor. Upon leaving London, he began business on his own account in Newcastle on Tyne, and during a lengthened residence there executed many works of great excellence. It was at this period he carried out a series of “Fine Art Exhibitions,” two of which were held at Dumfries, and contributed to the development of a taste for the plastic arts that was then arising among the people. Carlisle, too, was much indebted to Mr Dunbar for a healthy stimulus it received in favour of popular education; and so marked were his services in connection with the foundation of a Mechanics’ Institute in that city, that the principal inhabitants presented him with a substantial token of their gratitude and esteem.\n\nDuring the last few years of his career he found employment for his chisel in various parts of the country, and it was while engaged upon some classic work in Edinburgh, that he took a journey to his native town for change of air and relaxation, of which he stood in much need: it was his last visit – he returned only to die – and his latest breath was drawn among the kindred he loved so well.\n\nHis best works are busts from the life; and some copies in marble, from the antique, one of which we lately saw in Carlisle (which was executed nearly half a century ago), and was to our enamoured sense truly a thing of beauty. He was honoured with sittings from Earl Grey, Lord Brougham, Lord Durham, and other eminent statesmen; and he executed a much admired bust of Grace Darling, which was several times reproduced in marble for the Bishop of Durham and other admirers of the heroine. The statue of Sir Pulteney Malcolm at Langholm, also by the deceased artist, is a fine memento of his genius and skill.\n\nMr Dunbar was full of emotional warmth, generous, and benevolent. He had a rich fund of anecdote and humour, and great stores of general information, from which he could draw at pleasure to delight the social circle. On all these accounts the announcement of his demise will be received with deep regret by numerous friends in Dumfries and other parts of the kingdom.\n\nDumfries and Galloway Standard and Advertiser, August 15, 1866.\n\nDunbar’s bust of Elizabeth Stephens, better known as Mrs Gaskell, author of Cranford, Mary Barton & North and South.\n\nNotice is hereby given, that by Indenture of Assignment bearing date the 24th day of December, 1849 David Dunbar, of Swindon, in the Country of Wilts, ‘Linen and Woollen Draper, (trading under the firm of Dunbar and Company) assigned all his Estate and Effects unto William Ford, of No. 282, High Holborn, in the County of Middlesex, Line Draper, and David Dunbar of No 9, Ranelagh Place, Pimlico, in the County of Middlesex, Sculptor, upon trust for the benefit of all the creditors of the said David Dunbar, of Swindon aforesaid, who should Execute the said Deed, as therein mentioned. And that the said Deed of Assignment was duly executed by the said David Dunbar, of Swindon aforesaid, on the said 24th day of December, 1849 by the said William Ford, on the 27th day of December, 1849, and by the said David Dunbar, of No. 9, Ranelagh Place aforesaid, on the 1st day of January, 1850, in the presence of and attested by Richard Marriott Freeman, of No. 4, Great James Street, Bedford Row, in the County of Middlesex, Attorney at Law, at whose office the said Deed of Assignment now lies for execution by the Creditors. – Dated this 2nd day of January, 1850\n\nR.M. Freeman, Solicitor to the Trustees,\n\n4 Great James Street, Bedford Row.\n\nThe Wilts and Gloucestershire Standard, Tuesday, January 3, 1850.\n\nThe Katherine Losh mausoleum in the church at Wreay, Cumbria. Katherine was the sister of Sarah Losh, architect and designer.\n\nDavid Dunbar, sculptor 1797-1866\n\nWhen the opportunity arose in February, 1845, for carving the most prestigious statue in Victorian Cumberland, David Dunbar was staying at Woodside. He wrote to the committee offering to execute the statue of the Earl of Lonsdale in either bronze or marble. On discovering that his one-time pupil, Musgrave Lewthwaite Watson, was competing for the memorial, he wrote again offering ‘to resign any pretensions of mine in favour of that gentleman’. At Woodside he was probably engaged in sculpting the statue of Katharine Losh which was to be placed inside the mausoleum at Wreay. His hand would be guiding the chisel, but it would have been Sarah Losh’s imagination which was creating the image. He had once been an artist of rare ambition and considerable energy. David Dunbar had been born in Dumfries in 1793, the son of a stonemason. His father had taught him his craft, but he displayed an exceptional aptitude. At the age of seventeen he went to work on the building of Lowther Castle, one of the greatest building projects of the age. Paul Nixson, from Carlisle, employed him in carving the capitals which graced the inner court of this extravagant Gothic fantasy. Dunbar’s ambition took him to London where he married and became one of several assistants in the Pimlico workshop of Francis Chantrey, the most successful and accomplished sculptor of his day. There he acquired exceptional skills and began to exhibit at the Royal Academy. He left this promising situation to return to work for Paul Nixson in Carlisle in 1820. Nixson had a monumental workshop in Finkle Street, but offered little demanding work for the young sculptor beyond the carving of funeral monuments and marble fireplaces. However, Dunbar, Nixson and a young painter, Matthew Nutter, began The Carlisle Academy of the Arts. Their aspirations were embodied in the sculpture of the Genius of Carlisle which stood above the workshop entrance. Dunbar busied himself with carving the busts of local professionals and industrialists and occupied himself in educating the working men in the city and promoting a remarkable series of eight annual art exhibitions. In the small provincial city of Carlisle, Dunbar was showing works by the great masters from Titian to Rubens and Rembrandt and displaying plaster casts of sculptures from the antique and after Renaissance masters. He was also attracting exhibits from leading contemporaries throughout the country, including Edwin Landseer, John Varley, Frederick Watts, James Ward and members of the Norwich School, and from a school of proficient local artists. In 1826, he went on an extended tour of Italy, visiting the workshops of Thorwaldsen and Joseph Gott, among others, in Rome and being deeply impressed by the work of the late Canova in Possagno. On his return, he sought to extend his reputation. When he was refused entry to the Newcastle Exhibition because his statue of Musidora was considered indecent, he took the unprecedented step of staging a one-man exhibition in the city and then a second one in Durham. He found work among the liberal and radical community in the North-east. He sculpted the young Elizabeth Stephens, who in later years became the novelist Mrs Gaskell. He was also commissioned to make busts of Earl Grey and of James Losh, but the leading commissions did not come his way. His work lacked the individuality and imagination of Lewthwaite Watson. It was probably at this time, in 1832, that he carved busts of Sarah and Katharine Losh. Dunbar’s bust of James Losh was placed in the library of the Literary and Philosophical Society in Newcastle, but it was also used as a model for John Graham Lough, then working in Rome, to create a full-length statue of Losh in a Roman toga. It was Lough’s work which took pride of place on the staircase of the society. In 1839, he sought money and reputation by making the first bust of Grace Darling and selling plaster casts of the popular heroine of the Islands. His work and his income declined. In his last years he was a peripatetic stonemason and carver, repairing the stonework on colleges and churches. He died visiting his home town in 1866. His most popular and admired work was an image of his infant daughter, Elizabeth, which he made shortly after her death in 1822. There is a copy in Carlisle Cathedral, but he was prepared to sell the original even after he had donated it to his home church in Dumfries. His statue of Katharine Losh was recreated from the image of the bust he had already created from the life, from Sarah’s drawing and from Sarah’s memories and imagining. He rendered in marble that sense of gentleness, of sweet compliance, that sense of love between two sisters so embracing and so essential to each that they never thought of being apart. In carving the statue of Katharine, David Dunbar was touched by an art more profound than he had known before.\n\nDavid Dunbar was born in 1793. He was the son of Thomas Dunbar, Stonemason and his wife Janet Johnstone. David Dunbar married first Ann Stokes and second Arabella Riddiford. He died at Academy Street Dumfries on the 12 of August 1866. His nephew George Dunbar registered his death\n\nIn 2016 we all got very excited when Make Architects produced an ambitious £22m design concept for our town’s much needed new Museum and Art Gallery. But sadly, the bid for a Heritage Lottery Fund grant that would make this possible was unsuccessful and it was back to the drawing board.\n\nAnd then four years later Covid struck. In March 2020 the Swindon Museum and Art Gallery closed its doors, like everywhere else, as the country shut down in an attempt to halt the spread of Covid 19. But when other museums and galleries nationwide reopened in May 2021, Swindon’s didn’t.\n\nSwindon Borough Council subsequently announced that the Grade II listed Apsley House property wasn’t fit for purpose (which we knew anyway) but what was their solution. The top floor of the Civic Offices in Euclid Street was to be converted into a museum and art gallery while selected artefacts and paintings were to go on tour around Swindon. The long-term plan is to build a new museum and art exhibition facility in the centre of town but when they say long term, they really do mean long term. The estimated timeline is in the region of 10 years.\n\nSo why am I telling you this sorry saga?\n\nCharles Gore pictured left\n\nThis is the last resting place of Charles Herbert Henry Gore and his wife Clara. As a ten-year-old boy Charles found the fossilised bones of a prehistoric animal on the site of the Queen Street gasometer and this discovery began a lifetime’s interest in geology and natural history. But of course, what career opportunities were there for the son of a house painter in the 19th century.\n\nBy 1881 14-year-old Charles had finished his education and was working as an apprentice coach body maker in the GWR Works according to the census taken that year. In 1890 he married Clara Downs at St Mark’s Church and they set up home just round the corner from here at 31 Radnor Street.\n\nBy the turn of the century ill health had prevented him continuing his job in the Works and by 1911 he was working as a Draper’s Traveller. The 1911 census also describes him as a ‘part time student.’ It can probably be safely assumed that his studies involved his interest in fossils and geology.\n\nBy 1919 Charles had accumulated an extensive collection, which he offered to the Swindon Corporation on condition that it provided a building in which to accommodate it all (sounds familiar).\n\nIt was decided to use the Victoria Hall, a property in Regent Circus, which had just be vacated by the Roman Catholic congregation awaiting completion of their new church at Holy Rood.\n\nCharles was appointed curator, cataloguing and displaying his collection, which opened to the public on October 27, 1920.\n\nTen years later Charles packed up his collection again and moved it all up to Apsley House where it remained until 2020, when the museum closed it doors for the last time.\n\nWhere is Charles’s collection now? Well to be honest we don’t actually know. ‘In storage’ is the official comment – it certainly isn’t on display, that we do know.\n\nCharles’s wife Clara died in 1912 aged 44 and was buried here on May 1. Charles died in 1951 aged 84 years.\n\nThere is one last fact concerning Charles Gore who was born in Newbury in 1867, the son of Frederick and Hepzibah Gore. By 1881 the family were living in Swindon at 4 East Street where Frederick died on Tuesday, August 2. Frederick Gore was the first person to be buried in the new cemetery which opened in 1881. His funeral took place on August 6.\n\nRadnor Street Cemetery supporter and local historian Mandy Lea added this fascinating extra to the Charles Gore story.\n\nCharles Herbert Henry Gore – founder/curator of the Swindon Museum. After he left the GWR (due to injury) he owned a draper’s shop in Granville Street. He was also a medium and an artist. His love of fossils and is what started off his geological collection and became a Fellow at The Geological Society – he even had two ammonites named after him – Perisphinctes Gorei and Crendonites Gorei. He and others donated their collections as the Museum was founded; he also sourced the gharial (we all call it crocodile!) and the mummy. The Museum has a bust of him somewhere, but when we asked to see it they couldn’t find it. He was awarded the Freedom of the Borough of Swindon. It appears he led a rather colourful and varied life!\n\nLaudanum was the 19th century go-to drug for – well, pretty much anything really. The opium tincture was used to relieve everything from diarrhoea and the common cold to heart disease. It was a pain suppressant, induced sleep and was very, very addictive.\n\nIt was also very popular in Victorian artistic circles. One of the many victims of laudanum addiction was Elizabeth Siddal (1829-1862) a talented artist in her own right but better known as the muse, mistress and eventual wife of Pre-Raphaelite artist Dante Gabriel Rossetti. Lizzie died of a suspected overdose of laudanum following the birth of her stillborn daughter.\n\nLaudanum was readily available, cheaper than a bottle of gin and in Swindon in 1888 could be bought over the counter by a 14-year-old girl, apparently.\n\nThis is the story of Henry Simpson who also died from an overdose of laudanum taken to relieve back pain.\n\nHenry Simpson was born in Lechlade in about 1837, the son of plasterer John Simpson and his wife Sarah. Henry married Ellen Clifford in 1857 and throughout his life worked as a slater and plasterer, eventually adding grocer to his list of occupations, so obviously a hardworking man. The couple had two children, a daughter Lydia and a son William. In 1861 the family were living in Kempsford. By 1871 they had moved to Poulton in Wiltshire and by 1881 they had arrived in Swindon and were living at 21 Oriel Street, described on the census returns of that year as a Grocer Shop.\n\nDeath Through an Over-dose of Laudanum at New Swindon\n\nYesterday (Friday) Mr W.E.N. Browne (Coroner for North Wilts) held enquiry at the “Whale” Inn, Princes-street, New Swindon, touching the death of Henry Simpson, plasterer, who was found dead in bed on Thursday morning at his residence in Oriel-street. Mr. J. Maylott was chosen foreman of the jury.\n\nAfter viewing the body, the first witness called was Richard James Page, who stated that he had lodged with deceased for 10 years. Deceased was at work on Wednesday last, but went home in the afternoon, complaining of pains in his back. He had been suffering all the week. On the previous Saturday someone recommended deceased to take a dose of laudanum to ease the pain. Deceased obtained a bottle, and on Sunday evening he took 30 drops in some water. Witness counted the drops. Deceased then went to bed, and got up as usual on Monday morning. He took about the same quantity of laudanum again on Monday night. Witness did not see the bottle again until Thursday. It was then empty, but was quite full when deceased bought it.\n\nMinnie Browning, 14, a young girl residing in Oriel-street, proved going to Mr Smith, chemist, of New Swindon, and obtaining a bottle of laudanum and some opodeldoc, for which she paid 1s, and told the chemist it was for Mr. Simpson.\n\nHannah Browning gave evidence, stating that she was called to deceased’s house on Thursday morning about 11 o’clock, and between twelve and one she was asked to go and call deceased, as he had not got up. She did so but received no answer. She went half an hour afterwards and went into the room, and saw deceased in bed. She felt his hand and found it quite warm, but stiff. She then sent for some one, and she felt sure he was dead.\n\nDr Arnold, MB, FRCS, LRCP, stated that he was called to see deceased about three o’clock on Thursday afternoon. He found him dead, lying in the position of natural sleep. He examined the body of deceased, but found no marks of violence. In his opinion deceased had taken an over-dose of laudanum. The bottle produced would hold about eight drachms. Two drachms would be sufficient to kill a man who was not used to taking it.\n\nThe jury returned a verdict that deceased came by his death through taking an overdose of laudanum.\n\nThe Swindon Advertiser, Saturday, July 21, 1888.\n\nFrom the evidence given at the inquest by Richard Page it was stated that Henry was suffering from back pain, causing him to take to his bed. Perhaps today the verdict arrived at by the jury might have been a more empathetic ‘accidental overdose.’\n\nHenry was buried in grave plot B1575 on July 23, 1888. This was most probably a public grave at the time of his death but was subsequently purchased in 1948 for the burial of Edward Richard Green and his wife Emma Selina who died in 1952.\n\nAdministration of Henry’s will was granted to Ellen and his personal effects were valued at £147 6s 9d. Ellen moved to Chester after Henry’s death where she lived with her daughter Lydia and son-in-law Charles Arthur White. She died at their home on June 14, 1890 and was buried in Overleigh Old Cemetery, Chester.\n\nFor those of you interested in the story of Elizabeth Siddal you can read more here. This is one of the many portraits Rossetti painted of her.\n\nElizabeth was buried in the Rossetti family plot in Highgate Cemetery."
