        "text": "Mr. Ramsay MacDonald\n\n(Contd. from page 1)- I\n\nRAMSAY MacDONALD\n\nDIES AT SEA\n\nFOUNDED FIRST NATIONAL\n\nGOVERNMENT\n\nWAS GOING TO SPEND HOLIDAY\n\nLONDON, Wednesday.\n\nWhile Mr. Ramsay MacDonald, the former Prime Minister\n\nand leader of the National Ministry, was travelling to\n\nSouth America on the liner Reina del Pacifico to-day,\n\nhe suffered a heart attack and died. He was aged\n\n71 years.\n\nNews of his death was sent to London by wireless by the\n\ncommander of the liner. Mr. MacDonald, who was\n\ngoing to Callao (Peru), was accompanied by his\n\nyounger daughter, Miss Sheila MacDonald.\n\nHis body will be embalmed and taken ashore at\n\nBermuda. It will then be sent to England.\n\nMiss Ishbel MacDonald, his eldest daughter, was\n\ninformed of her father's death by wireless, and the\n\nDominions Secretary (Mr. MacDonald), who is his\n\nson, was told of it at Brussels, where he is attending\n\nthe Nine-Power Conference.\n\nMiss Ishbel MacDonald was the only\n\nmember of the family at home at Upper\n\nFrognall Lodge, Hampstead, when the news\n\nof her father's death arrived. She\n\nnervously paced the floor while she was\n\nwaiting for a telephone call from Mr.\n\nMalcolm MacDonald at Brussels.\n\nBefore he embarked Mr MacDonald\n\nsaid 1 am going to search for the most\n\nelusive of all forms of happiness -\n\nrest This is the first real holiday I have\n\never had. I shall do nothing particular,\n\nexcept move about. One day I shall ask\n\nmyself whethcr I have had enough, and\n\nif I find I have had I shall pack my bag\n\nand come back \"\n\nThe Prime Minister (Mr. Chamberlain)\n\nwas in bed when the news was received at\n\nDowning Street. It was decided not to\n\ninform him until he awoke.\n\nCourage in Crisis\n\nThe \"Daily Mall\" says that it will never\n\nbe forgotten that it was at a moment of\n\ncrisis in 1931 that Mr. MacDonald was\n\ncourageous enough to put the nation's\n\ninterests before his party, to break with,\n\ncolleagues to whom he was bound by strong\n\npolitical and personnl ties, and stake his\n\nfuture on the attainment of national\n\nunity. To his initiative and statesmanlike\n\nqualities the National Government largely\n\nowes its existence. Mr. MacDonald owed\n\nhis rise to no advantages of birth or in-\n\nfluence. No statesman ever surmounted\n\nmore obstacles or experienced more set-\n\nbacks. His sincerity and ability and his\n\nreadiness to meet the greatest challenge\n\nof his life changed the course of English\n\nhistory six years ago.\n\nThe \"News-Chronicle\" says that his-\n\ntory's verdict will be given later, but what-\n\never the ultimate view of Mr. MacDonald's\n\nplace as a statesman there can be no doubt\n\nor division about him as a man. He was\n\nan intensely human person, lovable for\n\nboth his qualities and his failings, and\n\nwhatever his failings as a public man he\n\nplayed an important role for Great Britain\n\nin international affairs at a critical time.\n\nMr. Hull's Tribute\n\nCommenting at Washington on Mr.\n\nMacDonald's death, the United States\n\nSecretory oí State (Mr. Hull) said that\n\nMr. MacDonald was a great leader, a pro-\n\nfound statesman, and a loyal friend. \"I\n\nalways found him a forthright and helpful\n\nrepresentative of the great people that he\n\nwas privileged to lead,\" Mr. Hull added.\n\n\"His untiring efforts to ensure peace\n\nplaced him in the front rank of those who\n\ntried to make a better world for us to live\n\nin.\"\n\nFROM HUT TO DOWNING STREET\n\nFrom a Scottish peasant's hut to the\n\nleadership of a British Labour Govern-\n\nment, and then to the Premiership of\n\nanother Administration, predominantly\n\nConservative, are the milestones in the\n\nremarkable career of the late Mr. James\n\nRamsay MacDonald.\n\nuntil time gives proper perspective, con-\n\nflicting estimates will be made of the\n\ncharacter of the man, but no one, even\n\nnow, will deny that he will always be\n\nremembered as one of the outstanding\n\nfigures produced by British Parliamentary\n\ndemocracy.\n\nMacDonald was a lonely Highland boy\n\nwho went to London shy and proud. He\n\nnever over came the loneliness of those\n\nearly years. It has been said that no\n\nPrime Minister, with the possible excep-\n\ntion of Salisbury, who did not always\n\nknow his Cabinet Ministers when he met\n\nthem in the lobby, was more inaccessible\n\nto his colleagues than Mr. Ramsay Mac-\n\nDonald\n\nSupreme Confidence\n\nAlthough Mr. MacDonald never seemed\n\ncompletcly at ease in the London which\n\nhe conquered in his rise, he had supreme\n\nfaith, in his own ability. This self-con\n\nfidence gave to his political conduct a ruth-\n\nless determination when he was thwarted,\n\nit is said that he led his first Labour\n\nGovernment to the general election of\n\nNovember, 1924, against the wishes of 614\n\nmembers of the House of Commons, in-\n\ncluding his colleagues in the Cabinet. In\n\ncidentally the election swept Labour from\n\noffice.\n\nPerhaps no one is better qualified to\n\njudge the service Mr. MacDonald gave his\n\ncountry than Earl Baldwin, who succeeded\n\nhim as Prime Minister in 1935. Last sveek\n\nEarl Baldwin said of him: \"I never fccl\n\nthat Ramsay MacDonald has had credit\n\ngiven to him by his country for the ser\n\nvices that he rendered it in 1931 and in\n\nthe years immediately succeeding.\"\n\nRamsay MacDonald was bom at Lossle\n\nmouth, on the shores of Moray Firth, in\n\nthe highlands of Scotland, on October 12,\n\n1866. His early home there, with his\n\nmother and grandmother, was a two\n\nroomed \"but and ben\" backing on to the\n\nrailside. It was a home of the direst\n\npoverty, but both mother and, grand-\n\nmother were of the finest peasant stock,\n\nand under their encouragement and help\n\nhe laid good foundations to his career.\n\nAt the age of 12 young MacDonald left\n\nschool and was nearly lost to politics and\n\naffairs. He thought of going to sea as a\n\nfisher-boy; instead he went to a field and\n\ndug potatoes, but his head master, hear-\n\ning of this, took him back to school, made\n\nhim a pupil teacher, and encournged and\n\ndirected him in his reading. It covered\n\na wide range, and included economics,\n\nscience, and philosophy.\n\n\"Attained Fortune\"\n\nAs a consequence, while yet in his 'teens.\n\nRamsay MacDonald became a rebel.\n\nBut Lossicmouth held nothing for the\n\neducated, ambitious, insurgent youth, and\n\nat the age of 19 he went to London with\n\nonly a few shillings in his pocket. He\n\nendured the severest hardships until he\n\nobtained work addressing envelopes at the\n\noffices of the newly formed Cyclists' Tour-\n\ning Club. Then he became an invoice\n\nclerk in a city firm at a wage of 12/0 a\n\nweek. After he had recovered from a break-\n\ndown caused by overstudy he was appoin-\n\nted private secretary to Mr. Thomas Lough,\n\nthen Liberal candidate for West Islington,\n\nat a salary of £75 a year, rising to £100.\n\n\"Now I have attained fortune,\" he wrote\n\nhome.\n\nIn 1895, at the age of 29, he made his\n\nfirst attempt to enter the House of Com-\n\nmons as a Labour candidate for Southamp-\n\nton. He was at the bottom of the poll with\n\n897 votes, but again handsome compensa-\n\ntion was waiting. To his fighting hand\n\ncame a subscription accompanied by a note\n\nsigned \"M. E. Gladstone.\" The writer\n\nwas Margaret Ethel Gladstone, a daughter\n\nof Dr. John Hall Gladstone, a distin-\n\nguished scientist, and a grandniece of\n\nLord Kelvin. They became friends, and\n\nalthough the Gladstone family at first\n\nfrowned on the association, they were\n\nmarried in November, 1895.\n\nThen began an idyll of wedded happi-\n\nness, which was ended only by Mrs. Mac-\n\nDonald's death in 1911. Together they\n\nworked and entertained and travelled on\n\nthe Continent, in Australia, New Zealand,\n\nSouth Africa, Canada, and other parts of\n\nthe British Empire. They visited Australia\n\nin 1900, and Mr. MacDonald visited Bal-\n\nlarat and spoke in the Alfred Hall in iavour\n\nof Mr. James Scullin, M.H.R., who was con-\n\ntesting the seat in a Federal election.\n\nFour years later the Labour representa-\n\ntion committee was formed. The fore-\n\nrunner of tile Labour party, it was largely\n\nthe result of the tireless propaganda of\n\nMr. MacDonald.\n\nSix sears later his real chance came.\n\nIn the general election when the Conser-\n\nvative administration was soundly de-\n\nfeated the L. R .C. put 50 candidates in the\n\nfield. Of these 29 were returned and\n\nMr MacDonald himself was successful at\n\nLeicester a seat which he held until the\n\nVictory election of 1918. So the Labour\n\nparty was bom and on this foundation\n\ngrew.\n\nIn no sphere of party activity was Mr\n\nMacDonald keener than in that of inter-\n\nnational relations. When in August 1914\n\nParliament heard from the Foreign Sec-\n\nretan that Britain was in honour bound\n\nto France and she to Russia Mr Mac-\n\nDonald launched his indictment of the\n\nBritish Foreign Office. He denounced war\n\nand refused to be a party to its prosecu-\n\ntion and in a few hours had resigned the\n\nParlimentary leadership.\n\nFour Years Absent\n\nFor four years he remained out of Par-\n\nliament but Mr. MacDonald elected for\n\nAberavon (South Wales), became leader\n\nof the official opposition. A second elec-\n\ntion within a year gave the party an\n\nopportunity to form the first Labour\n\nGovernment of Great Britain. Mr. Mac-\n\nDonald took the dual office of Prime\n\nMinister and Foreign Secretary. It lost\n\noffice soon afterwards, and went back from\n\nthe election as the official Opposition\n\nwith Mr MacDonald as its leader.\n\nPor the next four years he worked un-\n\ntiringly to secure, at the next appeal to\n\nthe country a majority Government.\n\nMeanwhile in 1927 he was overtaken by\n\nan illness which almost proved fatal. But\n\nhe regained vigour and when the dissolu-\n\ntion came in 1929 he led the party in a\n\ncontest which secured for Labour 288\n\nseats. The new Government took office\n\nwith the nation crippled by the effect of\n\nseven years depression, and the enormous\n\nburden of unemployment which followed.\n\nHowever, he continued his peace work\n\nbegun in 1924, and with the Optional\n\nClause signed the evacuation of the\n\nRhineland was secured and normal rela-\n\ntions with Russia were resumed. His visit\n\nto the United States paved the way for\n\nthe Naval Treaty of 1930 affecting\n\nBritian, the United States, Japan, France\n\nand Italy. Unemployment depression\n\nand other problems were courageously"
