        "text": "ABSTRACT The purpose of this dissertation is to prove that the Ancient Church in Ireland, Scotland and Western Britain (generically the ‘Celtic Church’, despite its arguably disparate languages and local practices), before the Great Schism of 1054, held an equal place in the one family of Apostolic Catholic Orthodox Churches existing from the early centuries of Christianity. It aims to clarify some aspects of the nature, beliefs, and practices of the Celtic Church. In so doing, it hopes to contribute to dispelling the myths surrounding this period of Church history prevalent in the Celtic Spirituality movements of today. To verify this thesis the liturgical material, theology and practice, and the art of the Celtic Church are specifically compared to those of the Coptic and Orthodox Churches. To put this comparison into context, it is necessary to set the scene historically and include archaeological corroboration. The Synod of Whitby, the Filioque, and the Pelagian controversy are not referred to in detail. Discussion of the attempted recreation of the \"Orthodox Celtic Church‟ and similar organisations is excluded from this work.\n\nWhatever may be one's beliefs, a realisation of the power and import of the Christian Faith is needed for an understanding of the thoughts and feelings moving the; men and women of the Middle-Ages, and for a just appreciation of their aspirations and ideals. Perhaps the fittest standard to apply to them is one's own broadest conception of the Christian scheme, the Christian scheme whole and entire with the full life of Christ's Gospel. Every age has offered an interpretation of that Gospel and an attempt at fulfilment. Neither the interpretation of the Church Fathers, nor that of the Middle Ages satisfies us now. And by our further understanding of life and the Gospel of life, we criticise the judgment of mediaeval men. We have to sympathise with their best, and understand their lives out of their lives and the conditions in which they were passed. But we must judge according to our own best wisdom, and out of ourselves offer our comment and contribution.\n\nThe word keltoi (Celtic) was first used by historians of the sixth century BC to describe these people who shared a family of languages rooted in a lost ancestral tongue . Their fully Celtic descendants in central Europe were the people of the Iron Age Hallstatt culture (800-450 BC) named for the rich grave finds in Hallstatt, Austria. By the later La Tène period (450 BC up to the Roman conquest), this Celtic culture had expanded over a wide range of regions, whether by diffusion or migration; however, Britain and Gaul (northern France) seemed to have become their primary homeland. Celtic cultures had numerous, diverse characteristics, but the commonality between these diverse peoples was the use of Celtic language. There is no doubt that Christianity and the resulting Christian Community of the Celts in Great Britain was unique from that of the Romanized west. It is certain that Christianity was well established in Britain by the beginning of the third century of the Christian era and remained largely uninfluenced by Rome until the Norman conquest.\n\nThe primary objective of this thesis is to examine the unique character of Celtic Christianity in Ireland. The central point of this thesis is that which makes Celtic Christianity distinct from other Christianities is the Celtic culture of imagination and Druidic storytelling, catalyzed by the lack of definitive (written) ancient Celtic and early Celtic Christian history. This mystical history, made increasingly vibrant through extrapolation and imagination, has given Celtic Christianity a distinct and fluid spirit that has allowed it to adapt to its environment and remain relevant. The first chapter provides a background on the origins of Celtic culture, as well as the Celtic learned class and how they shaped culture through their shaping of Celtic oral history. This chapter also gives context to the Holy Woman Brigid and her pre-Christian identity, as well as an outline of the nativist and anti-nativist views of early Irish texts. The second chapter investigates the Christianization of Ireland, showing that the Christianization was a story more complex and fluid than just the story of Saint Patrick. The third chapter examines the evolution of the hagiography and traditions of Patrick and Brigid as they evolved in response to their historical contexts. These traditions, like tree rings, will serve as markers of the growth and evolution of Celtic Christianity in Ireland. Thus, in this work I will show how this imaginative and hazy history has led to the evolution and growth of a new strand of tree within the forest of Christianity. Though this tree shares commonalities with the other trees in the forest, it is in a different genus and so also has unique characteristics. This tree has lessons to teach due to the inspiring and adaptive spirit of imagination found within, which has kept the modern strand of Celtic Christianity relevant today."
