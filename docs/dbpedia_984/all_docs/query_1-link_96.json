        "text": "4.9/5\n\nPerfect\n\nGGuest UserThis was a return trip to the castle, as my husband and I stayed there for two nights in 2017. Of course, the Castle was beautiful, the grounds stunning and the rooms and accommodations were 5-Star level and lived up to our expectations. But it was the staff and how they made us feel that brought me back for a week the second time with my 20 year old nieces, six years later. I would give the Castle 10 stars if I could! This time we did all of the on-site experiences... falconry, guided bike tours, horse-back riding, the Spa, big and small boat rides, afternoon tea and our favorite, the Unique Experiences with Eoin who curated a day with wonderful local craftsmen and women where we made soda bread, cheese and worked with a beekeeper. Eoin is such a great human being, made us comfortable, laughed with us and taught us so much about the West of Ireland. Again... everything about the Castle visually is stunning and breathtaking. So much attention to detail on the grounds, the forest, the castle itself and rooms are beautiful. We joked that there is magic fairy dust in the beds because they were more comfortable than any we have slept in. The restaurants cater to your needs and food is 5 Star worthy, we are not foodies, but our appreciation of all of the hard work put into our meals and their presentation was always present. All of that said, with 6 days at the Castle... it was once again the staff that made the difference for us. Luke always greeted us warmly and gregariously at the gates, Marty and all the doormen always welcoming us home, Thomas, Shane and Davida in Guest Services were making sure we were comfortable and inquiring about our days with laughter and warmth. They made such a difference to our stay. Paul and Simon in the bar were lovely and accommodating always and Agnes and Katelyn in the restaurants repeatedly made our days even brighter. The staff at Mrs. Teas helped us repeatedly and offered many items that we purchased for ourselves and for gifts to bring home. Yes, the Castle has a 5 Star designation and that marker is well-deserved. But is and will always be the staff, the people that fill the castle with warmth and genuineness and humor that will bring me back. When we left, we were sad to go but our hearts were full with the people, the soul and the warmth of the West of Ireland brought to us by Ashford Castle.\n\nShow More"
