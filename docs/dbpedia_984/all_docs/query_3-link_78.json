        "text": "Seamus Heaney was the eldest of nine children born to Patrick Heaney and Margaret ‘Totti’ McCann. His younger brother Christopher tragically died in a road accident aged four. He was hit by a car while walking near the family farm at Mossbawn in February 1953.\n\nSeamus Heaney was boarding at St Columb’s College, in Derry, at the time of Christopher’s death. His poems ‘Mid-Term Break’ and ‘The Blackbird of Glanmore’ describe returning home to attend his brother’s funeral.\n\nSeamus Heaney attended Anahorish Primary School. In 1951, he started secondary school as a boarder at St Columb’s College in Derry. The separation from his parents is poignantly described in the poem ‘The Conway Stewart’. Poet and academic Seamus Deane, who would become a lifelong friend of Heaney’s, was among his classmates at St Columb’s.\n\nIn 1957, Heaney went on to study English Language and Literature at Queen’s University Belfast, graduating with First Class Honours. He earned his teaching diploma from St Joseph’s College of Education in 1962.\n\nAfter qualifying as a teacher at St Joseph’s College of Education in 1962, Seamus Heaney taught at St Thomas’s Secondary School, in Belfast, and later returned to St Joseph’s College of Education as an English lecturer. He went on to become a lecturer in English at Queen’s University Belfast. After three years focusing solely on his writing, Heaney took up a teaching post at Carysfort College of Education in Dublin in 1975. He subsequently became a professor at both Harvard University and the University of Oxford.\n\nWe continue Seamus Heaney’s love of learning at HomePlace, where we deliver educational and creative activities for learners of all ages.\n\nSeamus Heaney lived at Mossbawn, the family farm near Castledawson, for most of his childhood. When Heaney was aged 14 and boarding at St Columb’s College, the family moved to a new farm, The Wood, outside the village of Bellaghy.\n\nAfter his marriage to Marie Devlin in 1965, Seamus Heaney lived in Belfast until 1972, when the family moved to County Wicklow. They lived for four years in Glanmore Cottage, a small gate lodge owned by their friend, the Canadian academic Ann Saddlemyer. In 1976, the Heaney family moved to Sandymount, in Dublin, where Seamus Heaney lived for the rest of his life.\n\nSeamus Heaney died on 30 August, 2013, in Dublin, following a short illness. He was 74 years old when he died. His funeral was held in Donnybrook, Dublin, close to his family home in Sandymount.\n\nIn accordance with his wishes, he was buried at St Mary’s Church in Bellaghy, in the same graveyard as his parents, younger brother Christopher and other family members. His headstone bears the epitaph: ‘Walk on air against your better judgement.’ The quote is from Heaney’s poem ‘’The Gravel Walks’, and was used in his 1995 Nobel Prize acceptance speech.\n\nUndoubtedly, Seamus Heaney’s greatest legacy is his substantial body of work, which continues to move and inspire. Heaney’s poetry is taught in classrooms around the world and was recited at President Joe Biden’s inauguration celebration in 2021.\n\nHeaney is remembered among his peers in the literary community for his generosity of spirit and his championing of younger writers. His personal warmth, humility and kindness is recalled by international figures and those who met him in the chip shop in Bellaghy alike.\n\nThrough the Estate of Seamus Heaney, the Seamus Heaney Centre for Poetry at Queen’s University Belfast and here at HomePlace, we work to continue Seamus Heaney’s legacy by bringing new audiences to his poetry and serving those beginning their exploration of his life and literature."
