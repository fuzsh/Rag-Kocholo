        "text": "My wife and I just went on an 8 day Iconic Scenes of Ireland tour through My Ireland Tours. My Ireland Tours - very easy to work with, and responsive to any questions we had along the way. They kept us up to date with information throughout the process, and had a great level of customer service. We interacted with Keith, who was great to work with, and answered every question we had in a prompt, helpful manner. We took a few extra days before and after the tour, so we didn’t participate in the airport transfers, but those that did were happy with them. Tour guide - we had Harry Fisher as our bus driver/tour guide, and I can’t imagine a better tour guide. He was loaded with information about everywhere we went, not just the attractions, but places along the way, as well as history and stories about everything Ireland. It was almost like taking a history tour. He was great with recommendations for dining, shopping or sightseeing on our own. He utilized WhatsApp and kept everyone up to date on every aspect of the tour, as well as additional information we may find useful. He was extremely personable, and very in tune to accommodating the various needs of the group. We had one member of the tour that was elderly and got sick, and he took extra care to make sure she was always comfortable and had everything she needed, including having hotel personnel catering to her needs. Harry is an extremely good driver and everyone felt extremely comfortable with him behind the wheel. Hotels - all very nice. Roomy, comfortable and clean. The dinners and breakfasts at each hotel were of very good quality, with a good variety of options to choose from. Other than Dunboyne Castle Hotel, which was very nice, the hotel locations were great, with easy walking access to all the main sites and activities. All hotel personnel were very friendly and accommodating. The logistics were also exceptional - lunch breaks and dinners were well coordinated, and luggage was handled by porters at each hotel stop so you didn’t have to worry about lugging bags around. Itinerary - what a great way to experience the highlights of Southern Ireland. All of the areas that I had on my list of places to see - Rock of Cashel, Blarney Castle, Ring of Kerry, Killarney, Cliffs of Moher, Galway and Dublin were covered with adequate time to see the necessary sites and still have available time to explore on our own. The lunch stops and recommendations were all very good. There were adequate rest stops built into the itinerary that allowed for bathroom breaks and opportunities to stretch. Value for the money - extremely satisfied with the value of the tour for the price. Everyone we spoke with on the tour had the same opinion. I would definitely recommend this tour to anyone who wishes to get a good exposure to Ireland. I’m sure all of the tour guides are top notch, but Harry made the trip an even more enjoyable experience.\n\nMy mom and I recently returned from a fantastic 10-day Deluxe Irish Castle Tour. When I woke up and went to work on my first day home, it felt like it had all been a dream! We usually travel independently, but we decided to try a group tour to maximize our sightseeing on the island. We chose My Ireland Tour because of the small group size (26), the unique accommodations, and the fact that the company is Irish-owned and -operated. They certainly delivered! Booking was easy and communications from Shannon were prompt and detailed. The hotels were beautifully appointed and the included breakfasts and dinners were convenient and filling. The nightly three-course dinners could be long (2 hours) but the presentation was exquisite and the food was delicious, especially the Irish lamb and beef. My favorite hotel was Lough Eske Castle with its warm welcome and serene setting. We loved the diverse itinerary. The only site we didn’t enjoy was the Guinness Storehouse (not into beer, crowded, and not much substance); in hindsight, we should have tried to walk to one of Dublin’s many museums instead. My itinerary highlights were Derry and our walking tour by Gerry, seeing Connemara ponies up close at Kylemore Abbey, the scenic driving in Connemara and Kerry, the herding demonstration by Tom O’Sullivan of Kells Sheepdogs, and the tour by Daire of Christ Church Cathedral from belfry to crypt. Last but definitely not least, a memorable part of the trip was our driver-guide, Tom Lavin. Tom has the perfect personality: conscientious, witty, never overbearing but attentive and ready to step in with advice. His professional driving skills are second to none, always prepared to evade wild drivers or wayward sheep. On two occasions, our group broke into applause after some particularly difficult maneuvering. Tom was able to talk at length about any topic: history, agriculture, politics, education, religion, the environment, healthcare, music, etc. We learned a lot and really appreciated hearing the knowledge and personal anecdotes he shared (I have a PhD in history and I learned more about Irish culture and society from Tom than I ever could have researched on my own!). I highly recommend My Ireland Tour. I know I will cherish memories of this tour and be wishing I was “on that N17, stone walls and the grass is green” for years to come.\n\nI went on this tour with my two amazing sisters. It was everything we expected and more! Our bus driver Garey was amazing, so informative and knowledgeable about every place we drove through and the sites we visited. The other folks on the tour were wonderful as well. We stayed in really beautiful hotels which included breakfast. Note though, not all hotels had AC, made for a few uncomfortable nights, especially when the windows don't open all the way for safety reasons. Highly recommend extending your Ireland Tour a few days before or after so you can explore Dublin on your own for a few days with no schedules. The schedules were great, but we like to do some of our own exploring. One aspect of the trip I was not the fondest of, we ate dinner every night in the hotel we were staying at. (Except for the last night when we went to a dinner and show, which was amazing) I've done other tours, several, and it is nice to venture out beyond the hotel to eat and explore other dining experiences. I understand the bus driver can only drive a certain amount of hours per day/week, but there are other ways to get around. The local pubs and restaurants are wonderful and really allow you to get immersed in the culture. When at the hotels we were often seated in separate dining rooms for breakfast and dinner away from the other guests. It felt very cold, despite the wonderful company we had with us. The best day we had food wise, was when we had lunch at a quaint B&B. Our hostess, Greta made a wonderful, homemade buffet for everyone to enjoy. Traditional Irish food and enough food to feed a small army. I wish she made all of our meals. I would most definitely recommend this tour, just don't expect much with your dining experience.\n\nMy sister and I have just returned from our 7 day Historic Castle Tour and let me just say, 'don't walk….RUN' to book this trip! From start to finish it was exceptional. Rain was forecasted for most days but our amazing tour guide, Tom Lavin, called in a few favors from up above and we were blessed with the most delightful weather throughout with the exception of a few raindrops while we were en route. We met Tom at the Dublin airport early in the morning. He greeted us with a smile and was kind and pleasant. When we arrived at our hotel Tom worked some magic and got us checked into our rooms early so we could freshen up then later explore the streets of Dublin. The next morning Tom reviewed the itinerary for the day as he did each morning. As we set out for the Epic Irish Emigration Museum Tom skillfully maneuvered the bus around the busy streets of Dublin while highlighting attractions, monuments and sharing some history along the way. After exploring the museum we made our way to the Guinness Storehouse Brewery and sipped on a complimentary pint of lager before heading to Kinnitty Castle nestled in the foothills of the Slieve Bloom mountains which would accommodate us for the night. On day three we toured the infamous Rock of Cashel and enjoyed a traditional farmhouse luncheon outside of Kilkenny. Greta, our gracious host, gave us a demonstration class on the making of her traditional home baked scones. From there we toured Kilkenny Castle and roamed the city streets before heading back to Kinnitty Castle for the night. Next off to Clifton, graced with another beautiful sunny day, to experience the majesty of the Cliffs of Moher. Oh what a sight to see! Abbeyglen Castle accommodated us for the next two nights. There we were wined, dined and entertained by the Castle owners who shared the history of the Castle at a champagne reception each evening. The accommodations, food and service were exceptional and we truly felt pampered. Following was a self guided tour of the historic Kylemore Abbey in the heart of the Connemara Mountains. We strolled along the expansive trail system which took us to impeccably manicured Victorian Gardens before seeing the splendor of the castle and grounds. There were many stops and sights seen along the way, some planned and others spontaneous. Tom had a few surprises for us which were very much appreciated. From pristine shores to vivid green landscape dotted with livestock, the views were breathtaking. Dublin City was our final destination. The group passed on a tour of the Pearce Lyons Distillery so we could pick up a few gifts in Dublin and rest up for the grande finale, dinner and entertainment at the Merry Ploughboy Pub. There we sampled delicious epicurean dights , sipped on spirits and were treated to hours of live traditional music and dancing. A tour guide can make or break a trip and we have Tom Lavin to thank for making our experience both memorable and enjoyable. Throughout the tour he skillfully navigated the narrow winding roadways while sharing great insight into Irish history, current events, family life politics and personal stories about growing up in a three generation household. He explained how land in Ireland is cherished, coveted and preserved which was evident by how clean, manicured and virgin the countryside is. I particularly appreciated Tom’s dry sense of humor. He is quiet and soft spoken but witty and quick with hysterical rebuttal. Did we laugh! The tour and attractions were icing on the cake. Tom Lavin WAS the cake!!! Thank you Tom for keeping us safe, happy and in stitches throughout!!!\n\nMy father & I recently travelled with My Ireland Tour for a 10-Day Luxury Castle Tour and it exceeded both of our expectations. From the beginning, Shannon was easy to work with and very helpful as we booked our trip, providing excellent suggestions for days prior to and following our trip. We believe our tour guide, Tom L, must be the best in all of Ireland! He is an excellent driver - demonstrating great skills on narrow and corkscrew roads! He was very informative sharing not only history, but also current stories to help us learn about people’s daily lives…and I will never forget about the Humble Spuds! Tom has a great sense of humor, making our trek enjoyable. And we know how much work he did behind the scenes to ensure all of us and our belongings were well taken care of and safe. The tour schedule was wonderful. At first we were concerned it would be too much, but as we were wrapping up, we didn’t want it to end! The accommodations were luxurious, the staff very welcoming & fun. The sites were beautiful and fun - castles, cathedrals, sheep, and cows - and we learned a lot of history. Our tour group was so much fun. There were only 17 of us, which allowed us to get to know each other and enjoy many laughs from inside jokes along the way. We also had 2 couples get engaged while we were on tour. I don’t think we would have had the same experience if our group was large. Thank you to Tom and My Ireland Tour for a fantastic experience for my father & I. We loved Ireland and will treasure our new memories.\n\nPros: -Our 10 Day Iconic Tour was a great stress free way to see so much of Ireland -Our driver did a fantastic job of getting us to locations at the right times to miss crowds. We also felt like the amount of time at each stop was well planned. Long enough to enjoy, but not so long as to take away from other things. -We appreciated the down time in the evenings to use our time as we choose -The food was generally very good and there were great options to choose from. Dinner was always 3 courses. Breakfasts always had a great variety of hot and cold options -Hotels were clean, in great locations, and hotel staff was very kind. We felt we got a good value for our money. -Our driver found a great balance between sharing information and letting us enjoy the drive Cons: -Expect dinner to take a while. It wasn't uncommon to wait until 8:15pm or later for dessert after being seated at 6:30pm -Because it is rarely needed in Ireland, most of the hotels don't have AC. The ones that did were either on a timer or didn't seem to work well. Rooms did come with fans and windows can be opened slightly. However, especially because rooms didn't have top sheets (just comforters) it was often uncomfortable trying to sleep -We got home to find out we had Covid. Nothing My Ireland can do about it, but if you're traveling with a large group in a bus for 10 days, there's always a risk of disease spread.\n\nWhat a great tour! Tom Lavin was our guide while we were on tour (we did the Castle tour), and he went above and beyond to make sure our group was comfortable, happy and informed about each place we visited. He shared personal stories from growing up in Ireland which added to the history, especially between Ireland and Northern Ireland. Unfortunately, we missed our inbound flight due to a very long delay by American Airlines and had to catch up with the tour a day late. Tom arranged for a driver to meet us at the airport and deliver us to where the tour was. That was extremely helpful as it took all the stress off of us. We had a relatively small group of 17 people, of all ages. I think our youngest member was 14 and our oldest was 90! However, no matter what the age, at every place we visited, there was plenty to see and options to sit out if you didn't want to (or couldn't) climb stairs, etc. Each day, Tom had a little treat for us depending on where we were that day. For example, we were by the seaside and he had us try dried seaweed! Then some crisps; some chocolate; AND some moonshine (gasp!). The locations we visited were beautiful and we had great weather the entire time we were there (I know, we got lucky). The accommodations were so nice! It's so cool to stay in castles built in the 16 and 1700's. Just know that some hotels do not have A/C. While this isn't really a problem as it isn't very warm, when you are in your room it can tend to be a bit stuffy if the windows are closed, but each place gave us a fan if we needed it. The one thing I will say is that you do spend some time on the bus so make sure you bring a book or download something to watch on your iPad - or use the time to take a nap like a lot of us did! I have gone on another land tour in Scotland with a different company and we moved hotels every day so that we didn't spend so much time on the bus. That was a total pain packing up each day, and it was kind of nice to be in the same place for more than a day to just explore the grounds - the gardens are spectacular everywhere. The service in the hotels is also outstanding. As a Floridian who isn't used to eating food from 'across the pond', it took a little getting used to but every night there were plenty of choices and they did make a menu for one of the guests in our group who was a vegetarian. We quickly made friends with everyone in the group and took turns sitting with everyone and getting to know them. By the end of the tour, we had so many jokes and laughs with people who were strangers 10 days before! Ireland is just beautiful and green, and the people there could not have been nicer. The only thing I will say is that it would have been nice to have one day 'off' - like a sea day on a cruise - to golf or enjoy a day at one of the hotel spas. Some of our guys did get in a quick 9 holes before dinner one night, and I skipped the last day of the tour since we had been to Dublin 3 times already in past. My girlfriend and I stayed at the hotel, and I took advantage of their Falconry Experience. My girlfriend spent some time in the spa and we had lunch and cocktails and just relaxed. That's my one and only (not even) negative comment. Other than that, it was an amazing trip with great memories and new friends. Would most definitely book another trip with My Ireland Tour.\n\nMy wife and I celebrated our 20th anniversary with the Deluxe Irish Castle Tour. We had an incredible trip! We arrived in Dublin a day early and did our own thing - but it was very easy to meet up with the group at the first hotel the next day. David Breen was our driver/guide - we could not imagine a better guide. He was a wealth of knowledge about Ireland’s history, geography, and culture. And he was just an all around great guy. This was our first visit to Ireland, and this was a great way to see a large part of the country, taking in some amazing natural scenery and some amazing castles along the way. Breakfasts and dinners were included each day - all were excellent, though we did do dinner on our own a couple of evenings just to mix things up and enjoy some “us” time. The lodging was very nice as well. I also need to say that our walking tour of Derry in Northern Ireland with Rodan as our guide was terrific - he was an amazing guide! And we had simply amazing weather all week as well. Lastly, Shannon was very helpful answering our questions about the trip before we left. We would definitely recommend this tour. My Ireland Tour made our first trip to Ireland very memorable - we will look forward to going back someday!\n\nMy Ireland Tour gave us a trip of a lifetime. To give you some reasons why I would book with them again - would be very long, but I wanted to share some reasons why I will be recommending this company to everyone I know. #1. Pat, our tour guide and bus driver, was so professional! His knowledge of history, legends, geography, and current affairs made him a walking encyclopedia with an Irish accent. He beautifully wove stories together as he skillfully drove the bus. Additionally, his years of experience made the tour run smoothly -- he knew a cruise ship would be arriving and Blarney Castle would be extra busy, so he arranged for us to get there before the crowd -- this slight 30 minute adjustment made our time there calm and peaceful. Additionally, Pat is just a wonderful person. I miss him already. #2. Hotels (some of which were castles) were amazing! They booked great accommodations for the entire trip (which can be challenging since our 14-day tour took us to many cities). #3. Nice mixture of activities and sites to see -- everything from a sheep herding demonstration, historic castles, churches, geological locations such as the Giant's Causeway and Cliff of Moher, small towns, graffiti walls in Belfast, ringing church bells, and of course drinking beer -- there was always something new to discover, and I was never bored. #4. Customer service was outstanding - from the email updates prior to leaving the USA, to answering emails when our flight from the US was canceled pushing us back 2 days, to overall planning, the customer service was great. My list could go on and on, but hopefully this helps gives you some insight into why I really enjoyed my trip to Ireland and Scotland.\n\nThis was by far the most relaxing yet activity packed vacation we have ever experienced. Not only did our driver Seamus find us at the airport and contact us to make the trip into Dublin (our flight was rescheduled last minute), he also provided top notch service with a flair of humor and some very interesting insight in how life is around that part of Ireland. You can certainly read all the reviews about the wonderful and varied points of interest provided in this 6 Day tour of Ireland and believe how great they are. We were fortunate enough to miss all the bouts of rain and able to enjoy all of the sights. The days were organized with plenty of time to relax and also explore on your own as well as enjoy museums, natural sites and local tourists destinations. Seamus provided safe and timely transportation and always ensured his head count was accurate! He also let us in on some little known gems in the areas we visited. This was the perfect way for us to plan our trip to Ireland as we had many unknowns about where we would be in the work life and had very little time to plan an itinerary ourselves. My Ireland Tour provided a wonderful assortment of options and we will gladly be looking to use them again for future trips. Also, the choice of hotels for our stays were very comfortable and, boy, that breakfast! It has been almost a month since we left for our trip and we think about it and those we met on the trip fondly each day.\n\nYour tour guide makes all the difference in the world and our guide Damian was fantastic. He was a wealth of knowledge and trivia which rounded out the many stops and venues we visited. We did the iconic Scotland and Ireland tour, starting in late May to mid-June and it was everything you thought it would be and more. The venues in which we stayed were all first-rate, albeit several I wish we had stayed longer! The coach was comfortable and we had enough room to spread out if we wished. The seats had a charger for your phone or other devices and there was a lavatory on board, although there were frequent stops where restrooms were nearby. As you are basically covering a great deal of Ireland, there were several days which got long, but in order to make it from one evening's venue to another that couldn't be helped. Damian provided some 'treats' of some sort when we climbed back on the coach after seeing some of the sights...nice touch. Damian kept an eye on traffic etc. which managed us to beat the rush of other tours at some of the most visited sites. (After all who wants to wait in line for ever?) The breakfast and suppers at the venues were all very good, several were fantastic. You never went away hungry. I only wish that our arrival at some of the hotels could have been a wee bit earlier (We ALWAYS arrived at least an hour, if not more) in order to unwind a bit more before supper. I also would have like a little more time in the cities in the evenings to walk around a bit more, but with everything packed in, I understand the schedule they had to keep. Overall you can't go wrong, especially with a driver like we had. If we would decide to go back, this tour provided a great overview of what we would like to see in more depth. Thanks Damian for a great time. Keep your tractor's shiny!\n\nMy Ireland Tour is a spectacular company! I'd emailed in May 2023 for a June 2024 trip, and Kristel O'Connor became my tour planner. I'd never traveled and wanted to visit my grandmother's homeland. I had so many questions and ideas, and Kristel went above and beyond to answer everything and plan a wonderful and practical trip---if it hadn't been for Kristel, I would've been all over and aimless! We visited Dublin and had highlights at Trinity College (The Book of Kells! The Long Room!) and the Guinness Storehouse. We went to Roscommon and saw my great-grandmother's home before going to Knock Shrine (maginificent)! Galway, Kylemore Abbey, feeding sheep, meeting Connemara ponies, climbing all through Bunratty Castle, and relaxing at Durty Nellie's before climbing the Cliffs of Moher just doesn't get any better! The hotels were beyond anything I could have imagined (the Gresham in Dublin, The Galmont in Galway, and the Armada in County Clare on the water). Additionally, My Ireland Tour's website for itinerary and payment is VERY organized, which is extremely helpful and lets you see everything. Finally, our driver, Dave Darby, was just the best! We laughed all week, learned a lot, and had great transportation. There's a reason he is 'King of the Road'! The van holds 9, and the 8 of us had plenty of room and comfort. As a first-time traveler and an overthinker, I cannot say enough good things about My Ireland Tour. Everything was taken care of, excluding lunch and dinner, which helped me budget for the trip and just enjoy without the concern of figuring out all of tickets for individual stops, hotel rooms, transportation. This is truly a company focused on personalization!\n\nWe were a party of three booked on the 14 day, June 8 -21, 2024 Iconic Scenes of Ireland tour. Our tour guide was Sean O'Sullivan and without his expert driving skills and extensive knowledge of Ireland, it would not have been as wonderful as it was. Sean picked us up at the airport at 9 a.m. on day one and brought us back to the airport on the final day at 5 a.m. and every day in between he was everything a professional tour guide should be! We loved the food at every hotel. Each dinner offered three courses with three choices on the starters and main. Some hotels offered choices for dessert but most offered a plate with three different desserts. Breakfasts were buffet style with the usual Irish fare: scrambled eggs, sausages, rasher bacon, blood pudding, scones, juice, etc. The hotels were well appointed, but be prepared for two differences between Irish hotels and North American hotels: all but two did not provide face cloths and every hotel opted for a covered duvet with no bedsheet between you and the cover. Which might not be a problem if the rooms were cool or cold but most were warm which meant that if you didn't want to sweat, you needed to remove the duvet from the cover and use the cover as a sheet. One of the best surprises about My Ireland Tours is the amount of space provided on the bus. There were 23 people on our tour which meant that each person had two seats to themselves; plenty of room for bags or backpacks and to stretch out on our long touring days. The only criticism I have which is shared by our group of three is that on the last few days of the tour, we were getting a bit weary; we would have appreciated lighter touring days where we could rest at the hotel or go to a local pub and relax. Perhaps drop the Guinness Storehouse or Jameson tours? We had already had the Bushmills Whiskey tour (which was wonderful), three tours of alcohol producers seemed a bit much (at least for us and we enjoy a wee nip!). The last excursion to The Merry Ploughboy was thoroughly enjoyed by all! If you're on the fence between My Ireland and another tour company, it's a no-brainer if you like lots of room on the bus. Five stars, well deserved!\n\nFor travelers from America who are visiting Scotland and Ireland, the tour is typically only as good as the places on the itinerary and the guide who provides the commentary on the countries. Fortunately for our tour in early June 2024, the cities and country side we visited, and our guide, Damian, get exceedingly high marks. Beginning with Damian, the man is a font of knowledge and shared that knowledge in an interesting and often humorous fashion. In addition, his skills as a driver of the tour bus were remarkable. We always arrived at our scheduled hotels in plenty of time for dinner and Damian had us on the road timely so as to avoid most of the crowds at the various points of interest. He also knew of choice spots to stop for lunch. In short, he had the right mixture of droll humor, source of information (without being overwhelming) and Irish charm to make traveling with him a definite plus. The cities and points of interest that we visited met our expectations. In hindsight, I would have liked to have spent more time in the cities but the itinerary description was in no way misleading. If anything, the itinerary description did not do justice to the places outside the cities that we visited. All the hotels were clean, comfortable and quiet and several were exceptional. Dinners at the hotels were fine but not particularly memorable. In terms of a recommendation, if the purpose of the trip is to see as much of the two countries as possible in a two week period, and to learn about the countries' histories, this tour is for you.\n\nI recently took my 88-year-old mother on the My Ireland Tour Deluxe Irish Castles Tour (April 28 - May 7, 2024), and it was a truly wonderful experience. This was my first time on a bus tour, and it exceeded all expectations. The tour was incredibly well-organized, the bus was spacious and comfortable, and we made great new friends along the way. I was initially concerned about my mother making the trip, but our tour guide, John Dennany, was absolutely amazing. He was incredibly kind, considerate, and always went the extra mile to ensure everyone’s comfort. A true Irish gentleman - John even took my mom to tea when she couldn't join a longer walk and helped her up the hill to see The Rock of Cashel - which ended up being her favorite site. John's great sense of humor and fun personality truly made the trip the best it could be, keeping everyone entertained and engaged throughout. His extensive knowledge of Irish history also made the tour exceptional. Highlights included the stunning Cliffs of Moher, the romantic Kylemore Abbey, and there was even a delightful surprise at Lough Eske Castle. We had (mostly) beautiful sunny weather and the drives through miles of gorgeous green scenery were simply breathtaking. So much beauty in one country was unforgettable. The final nights at the incredible K-Club Hotel were a perfect conclusion to the trip. The hotel's stunning grounds and luxurious accommodations, along with its beautiful golf course, added an extra layer of magic. This trip was an absolute joy and a fabulous memory of a perfect mother-daughter adventure. Everything from the accommodations to the food was top-notch. My Ireland Tour provided an unforgettable experience, and I highly recommend this tour to anyone wanting to explore the beauty of Ireland in comfort and style.\n\nWe just got back from a week long private tour of Ireland using My Ireland Tours and I cannot recommend them enough. The whole process was enjoyable from start to finish! Working with Eric on the itinerary was so easy and enjoyable! I gave him a list of the few things we wanted to see and he was able to come up with the perfect itinerary for us. Before our tour, 3 of us flew into Dublin for one night, then headed to the Isle of Man for a week. Eric was able to add a hotel for that that first night and found a way to have the hotel hold all our luggage for the week we were on the Isle of Man because we couldn't take it all with. On our way back from the Isle of Man, the ferry booking took us to Belfast and I tried to find public transportation to get us back to Dublin to meet up with the rest of our group. The timing wasn't working out so last minute, Eric was also able to find us a private car to get from Belfast back to Dublin. He is a hero in my book! Once we started our private tour, it was non-stop laughter! Our driver, Joe was an amazing tour guide! He was so knowledgeable, answered all our annoying questions, and fit right in with our sarcastic, (sometimes rambunctious) jolly crew. I have not recovered from all the laughter and learned so much about the history and current events of Ireland. We felt completely safe and at ease during the entire trip knowing Joe was with us. The bus was comfortable - reclining seats, USB chargers, wi-fi, and lots of space. If/when we go back, I will definitely be using My Ireland Tours for all my needs. They're the absolute best!\n\nVery comprehensive tour with a superb guide. Harry Fisher - was unfailingly cheerful, always amusing, exceptionally knowledgeable and always patient. We took the 8 day Iconic tour which had been well planned either by the office staff / and or Harry. The hotels, with the exception of the final 2 nights in Dublin, (the Samuel Hotel) were generally very good, well located and catered for our needs well enough. Our one major criticism of the tour was the inclusion of an Irish Night dinner & cabaret - on the last night. The food was poor and the entertainment was the same, except for the Irish dancing. Had we known exactly what it would be and been given the choice, we certainly would have chosen not to attend if an alternative diner was available in the hotel. This is clearly a very personal point of view and was not shared by the majority - it appears ! Equally, the choice of tour vehicle was inadequate for my purposes. Being 6 feet tall, and weighing 14 stone plus - I was simply not able to find a comfortable position, even with a vacant seat beside me. Others found the same problem also. The available leg room was insufficient to relax the legs. For those of you who have flown on Ryanair, imagine being in that seat for 7 days !\n\nWe had a marvelous 10 day tour of Ireland with My Ireland Tour. The company was very easy to work with. We had a couple of specific places which we wanted to visit based on some ancestry work we had done. At the same time, we wanted to see the most of Ireland possible during the ten day tour. We communicated via mostly email from the US. Bottom line: a very successful and enjoyable tour. We got a new understanding of Ireland’s history including the “Troubles” and peace treaty and also the incredible beauty of the island. The hotel accommodations were mostly very good to excellent with one exception: the Mauldon Hotel in Derry which was OK but didn’t compare to the other hotels. We stayed one night in a the Blindgate House in Kinsale which, while being fine, did not provide the breadth of services of the hotels we stayed in. But what made this trip extra special was our Guide/driver for the week, Joe O’Connor. His was with us every one of the ten days. Meeting us promptly in the morning and making sure we were settled in our accommodations in the afternoon. The tour included scheduled stops with the flexibility to add and delete stops. With his knowledge of Ireland, Joe recommended a few unique and interesting stops along our route. This included: - a wonderful demonstration of sheep dog abilities - A visit to a reconstructed typical early 1900s Irish country home - An ancient burial monolith\n\nMy husband, John and I just came back from My Ireland's 14 Day Iconic Scotland & Ireland Tour. Our driver/tour guide, Pat Prendergast was absolutely incredible and was such a wealth of information! Pat went the extra mile for each one of us and really made our trip so worthwhile! A few suggestions for future 14 day Scotland & Ireland Trips that were echoed by fellow travelers on our coach bus: a) Having travelers wear ID name tags is a good idea and helps people get to know each other more quickly. Some people need a visual cue in order to remember someone's name, b) Time should be allotted in Belfast for a tour of the Titanic Museum. I know a lot of people on our bus showed interest and would have liked to have gone inside this historical museum-especially since we drove right by the museum. c) A two night stay should be based into the itinerary for guests to stay at Lough Eske Castle (even if this increases the price of the tour a bit). One night is simply just not enough- especially considering guests usually arriving at the castle don't get there until sometime in the afternoon, only to have dinner and then leave the next morning, All in all, we had a marvelous time, saw some amazing places & met some very nice people. Would we use My Ireland again for a future excursion- Most Definitely! Diane & John Giordano\n\nWow - just coming back from a 10 day Iconic Scenes of Ireland tour and already wanting to go back & see more! From beginning to end, it was a memorable visit! So many positives: 1.). Tom Lavin - our driver - was amazing & made the tour what it was: safe (great driving Tom!), adventurous, and filled with so many beautiful sites of Ireland! Absolutely “brilliant”! Tom shared so much knowledge of every facet of Irish life and of places we drove by - not just the sites visited. We became so familiar with so much of Ireland because of Tom! We also appreciated his insight to change up the itinerary to include the crystal shop & view demonstrations of the etching of crystal! We especially want to thank Tom for the bus treats he shared with our group - a nice touch of extra hospitality! Tom was an utmost professional at all times. 2.) The hotels & food were excellent! Loved the variety of hotels - from a castle to inner city to an old school-turned hotel - and all served such delicious food! What a plus to have both breakfast & dinner provided each day! 3.). The 100,000 welcomes from the hospitable Irish people - everywhere we went, we were greeted with such kindness & willingness to make our visit the best it could be! And it was the best! What a great way to tour Ireland for our first time there - the 10 day Iconic Scenes of Ireland will be recommended highly by us to anyone who wants to see the best of Ireland! A five-star review!! We look forward to visiting the Emerald Isle again in the future!\n\nThe tour and our driver-guide George were phenomenal! We did the 10-Day Iconic Scenes of Ireland Tour in mid-May and honestly if I could do every tour, every vacation with George for the rest of my life that would be OK -- he was super knowledgeable about every place we visited, both the history and the current state of affairs, and was able to easily illustrate how these things not only shaped the current status of Ireland, but also how it made Ireland fit in in the broader world-wide scene. It was obvious that he (and My Ireland Tour) had tons of experience doing these tours, as the itinerary was fast-paced and absolutely stuffed full, but everything still went smoothly and even at the points where it went a little sideways George always had a backup/workaround already prepared. I also really loved that in addition to the big obvious tourist spots, we were also shown smaller, more local areas/businesses that someone from overseas would never find out about, and honestly I think I enjoyed that more than anything because it makes you feel so much closer to the people and the culture than the obligatory tourist areas. George was so great I'm actually worried that all my future vacation tours are going to feel lackluster because the guides won't be nearly as cool as him.\n\nI did the 7 day castles tour in Ireland with one of my young sons. Overall, it was a very nice trip. Pros: early communication, itinerary, accomodations, etc were all very transparent. It was a good overall value. There are well planned rest stops for longer bus rides and a chance to grab lunch every day. The two castle accommadations were interesting. The guide was knowledgeable and tour group small. It would have been nice to take ten min to intro everyone. The food at Riu Gresham was not great and cold for dinner although breakfast was a nice buffet. Consistent on food was that it lacked 'typcial' Irish faire. Disspointing because we had avoided it in the few days before the tour. There is also no beef or lamb and after seeing thousands roaming the country that was weird. A sample menu for each place would be nice because it otherwise was pretty good. While the castles were really nice, the first one at least was very remote which resulted in a lot of extra bus time. The second was walkable to town if you don't mind hills. The farm lunch is nothing to get excited about, would have preferred to be dropped at a pub. We didn't do the dinner show because there was too much bus time on the last day and we are not night owls. Overall, this was good for a group tour. Much better than some of the tour buses I saw packed with people. The tour operator knows how to communicate and packs a lot in. My son was able to make a nice presentation for his class using all the info he absorbed.\n\nThere were things about I tour that I loved and then things about our tour I didn't love, but tolerated. Much of this comes from living in a different region of the world not understanding how things are done in a country being visited. The great things were.... 1) All the places we visited. All amazing. Loved seeing and hearing out the history of both Scotland and Ireland. Phenomenal 2) Our driver, John was beyond a 5 star. If I could give him 10 stars, I would, He was engaging, patient, fun and humorous. He had a system down that worked well. Honestly, I don't know how he was so calm with one lady on our bus who was chronically late by 15+ minutes every single time we were to meet. She was beyond disrespectfully to the group as a whole regarding this lateness. She showed no remorse nor apologized. If I were John, I would have lost it. He maintained his cool and professionalism. 3) My Ireland Tour company was excellent. They answered all of my emails the same day and were forthcoming with information. The things we didn't know about was our fault because we failed to ask. Everything about the company is very professional and organized. Not an easy job. What I wish were different... 1) The length in each day. Each day came with almost 8 hours or more of bus travel. It was exhausting for me personally a woman of almost 64 years. There were more than enough stops which were wonderful, but going from one hotel to the next, living out of a suitcase for 14 days was hard. This tour is very fast paced. 2) The hotels were about 3 stars rating US standards. The morning buffets far exceeding anything offered in the US. Excellent buffet with tons of options. The sleeping accommodations were not easy. The rooms were very hot. The windows were set to only open at the most 3 inches which did not provide relief. There was no way to request a flat sheet as a bed cover. All they offered as a bed cover was a thick winter all-in-one duvet. Great for the winter, not great for summer temps. If we kept the window open to get some air, then the bright city lights and noises from the outside made sleeping impossible. If we closed the window and curtains, the noises and lights were gone, but....we felt like turkeys basting in the oven. The tubs are all super deep to enter for showering and they are slippery. This was a hazard for us seniors. 3) Motion on the bus. This region is not know for smooth straight highways. Most roads are very small, windy with constant swaying. If you are a person who experiences motion sickness like me, come prepared with medication from your hometown. I am happy we went on this tour. We enjoyed all the places we visited, the history and the driver. This tour is definitely worth taking. As a traveler be prepared. Bring your own personal flat sheet for the hotel rooms. Understand that this tour is fast-paced with long back to back days of traveling on the bus. Once home, you will need a few days of doing nothing to recover. Don't take this tour with with the mindset, that Ireland and Scotland have business practices similar to what you find in the US. They don't. Their way of life is different and this is perfectly fine. Do not have expectations and all will be right with the world.\n\nThis May, our family did a five day private tour with My Ireland Tour. The experience from start to finish was nothing short of wonderful between the tour itself and the staff involved. Catriona was attentive, helpful, timely and overall an absolute pleasure to work with throughout the planning process. Catriona made sure every detail of our itinerary was what we were looking for; and provided great options, suggestions and advice for our trip. Our driver-guide was Ken O'Connell, who certainly added to the memorable experience we had. Ken was very caring and kind to our family and shared his knowledge of history, storytelling and of course, his sense of humor with us. Ken also made sure we were taken care of at each hotel and attraction we visited. The tour itself was perfectly curated and offered a good mixture of experiences (National Famine Museum, Connemara, Sheepdog Demonstration, Kylemore Abbey, Hazel Mountain Chocolate Factory, Cliffs of Moher, Falconry, Ring of Kerry, Cobh Heritage Centre and more) while seeing much of Ireland; and while of course taking the scenic route. We visited Galway, Killarney, Dublin and other beautiful areas along the way. The tour also offered a nice balance as there was time each day to explore the areas on your own and before choosing your own dinner (the hotels were all centrally located). I would highly suggest My Ireland Tour as a must to anyone looking to discover Ireland and would absolutely tour with them again. The experience of having our driver-guide with a meaningful, personalized itinerary was unmatched.\n\nThis was lovely, I can recommend this tour company. My first bus tour, I was a bit apprehensive about sitting on a bus for long stretches, but that wasn't a problem at all. I was on the 14 days of Ireland tour. There were enough stops planned each day to stretch your legs or have a bathroom break. It was easy to hit your daily steps goal if you wished (but don't worry you won't miss anything if you don't/can't, the guided walks are at a very gentle pace). Our tour was early in the season, and as some places were flexible with our pre-booked time slots, our lovely tour guide Don O'Donoghue was able to arranged for us to do a couple of activities and photo ops that weren't in the initial itinerary (and you know you got assigned a great guide when the people at the various attraction, who all seem to know him/of him, only have good things to say. Same for our 3 local drivers). The group size was good, we got on very well very qickly, the bus was comfortable enough if a bit cold at times. The hotels were of a good standard and the food was tasty even though the desserts became rather repetitive. The farm lunch was a highlight. We were blessed with the weather and many laundrette sightings. Of course personal interests vary. I would have preferred to have a bit more time to walk around Derry and see Enniskillen castle (both cities were one night stops), and visit Belleek rather than the lacklustre Yeats grave.\n\nWhat an amazing trip we had! We did the 10 day iconic scenes of Ireland tour and I have to say, as a first time traveler to Ireland, choosing this tour was the best way to see such a beautiful country. Our tour guide Tom was the best! His knowledge of the areas and the country as a whole along with his humor made the trip unforgettable. The coach was very comfortable so the days we spent a little more time on the bus weren’t bad at all. One of the things I loved most was how this tour supports each areas local economy. We stopped at some major tourist destinations of course, but also at many small businesses along the way. Being able to support local artists and businesses is important to me, and getting to do this on the tour was great. All of our hotels were beautiful and the food was delicious. Breakfast was a buffet with choices for every palate and dinners were well thought out, always with a vegetarian dish for those who wanted. Each dinner was a three course meal and we never left hungry! Tom was there if we had any issues and the minor one we had, he took care of right away with the hotel management. This tour also was great about making sure any food allergies and sensitivities are addressed before hand. One person in our group had a food sensitivity and never once did she feel that she didn’t have options for her meals. The level of care we received was above and beyond what you would expect. Our luggage was put on and off the coach by the staff and Tom, and then brought to our rooms when we got to each new hotel. The little details are not overlooked! I highly recommend traveling with My Ireland Tour!\n\nMy husband and I absolutely loved our time in Ireland! We were there from 4/15-4/24 and decided to do the 10 day iconic scenes tour. Colm was our guide and driver and he completely knocked it out of the park with his witty humor, broad knowledge, and kind nature. Since there is lots to see and do, there is a lot of driving, however, Colm was always making clever jokes, telling us stories, as well as sharing historical facts about almost everything we passed by. At the larger attractions, we were given 2-3 hours to explore by ourselves which we loved. My husband and I love to explore so it was nice having time to do our own thing and if we had any questions when we got back, Colm was always happy to indulge us. Pick up and drop off transfers went smoothly and there was never a moment where we felt nervous or unsafe. Our favorites include all of the castles and historical sites, cliffs of Moher, and Killarney! Around 4 pm average, we were taken back to the hotel and allowed time to wander around the town if we wanted. Colm always encouraged us to explore our surroundings when we were done with the daily tour. Our favorite highlight was hiking around Killarney National Park (something we did on our own time). Every single local we met was so kind and welcoming and the food was amazing! Highly recommend this tour!\n\nWhere to start? Our driver, John, was AMAZING! He Was funny ,accommodating ,informative, And most definitely one of the best parts of this trip. We toured with a group of 20 people, whom we now call friends. As you can see from the photos I was the self chosen photographer of the group. Every single day was a joy, Although I will say that the 10 day iconic door was a bit more physical than I was aware, I pushed myself, and I didn't regret it a single day. There was a waterful that I would drive a really thought that we should see but it seemed to stole the climb was a bit too steep for me..so. I opted to stay on the bus. Our tour guide/driver, Came to take me off the bus and personally hold my arm and escort me up every single step until I stood before the water fall With tears of my eyes. Such a beautiful sight to behold and he was right it was worth the journey. Im turning 60th this year, my Husband is 70 And we had the most amazing time together. We were able to see most of the things that were on my bucket list and we shall return to see the rest. This was all inclusive so the amount of money that it saved us was incredible. The days were well planned out,;the meals in the hotels were fabulous! Thank You For the most memorable vacation ever... And a special thank you to our driver and tour guide John\n\nMy Ireland Tours was absolutely incredible! From start to finish the process was seamless and so efficient. Claire helped me and my mom book our tour with them and answered every single question we had prior to our trip. Our tour guide and driver Dave was phenomenal. He was always on time each morning and listened to us if we wanted to do something or had a question. He was extremely informative regarding history and knowledge about all the different places we got to visit. My mom and I booked a private tour with this company and it was the best decision we made. We got to see so much of Ireland that we would not have been able to see if we did not book with them. Claire and Dave both made our trip that much more special so thank you. My mom and I are so happy with how everything turned out including my dream of getting to stay in a Castle! Dave introduced us to 'craic' and we loved every moment of it! If anyone is thinking of booking a trip to Ireland and wants to see as much as you can in an orderly fashion book with this company! We were always where we needed to be, Dave was so organized even when he teased about where are we going LOL. He constantly told us this is our trip so if we wanted to spend more time somewhere we could. Truly an exceptional trip thanks to My Ireland Tour. Thank you for an amazing trip and wonderful memories!\n\nSlainte' ! With the help of My Ireland Tour, we had a fantastic time in Ireland! They basically let us design the places and stops we wanted to make and then provided a driver to get us there! Our sweet driver, Pat, was knowledgable, accommodating and helpful! I was worried it may be awkward to be with a stranger for six days, but he was so sweet that we all missed him when he wasn't with us! The hotels were placed in the heart of the action each night so we could walk to shops, restaurants and pubs with ease or the need for additional transportation. Because My Ireland Tour had taken care of 'tickets' for our pre-planned stops, it was delightful to have Pat escort us to the entrance, talk with the 'gate keepers', and then pick us up when we were done. So many details that were 'magically' done for us....parking, entrance fees/tickets, restaurant choices, AND we didn't have to worry about traffic, directions, getting gas, insurance etc!! The van was clean and comfortable as well. What's not to like!? 100% recommended! Additionally, My Ireland Tour, was careful not to cram too much into a single day. We ran into other groups that had to drop a stop or rush through because their tour hadn't been planned carefully. Pat said that My Ireland Tour is the best at making sure the day's pace is well-planned. We also ran into couples driving themselves through Ireland and they weren't sure the marriage was going to outlast the self-driven tour! 😉 If you're on the fence, jump off and onto My Ireland Tour!\n\nOh my goodness this trip was well done from start to finish! We chose the 14 day tour of Ireland. It's lovely, first of all, that this company does not jam pack the bus full of people, as with saw with other tours. Our group could stretch out and have breathing room on the bus. Second, their drivers are incredible! We had Phillip as our driver the first two days and he even came to get my daughter and I when our flight was delayed into the afternoon. He sang for the tour on the bus which was a delight and was knowledgeable about all he drove us to! Our driver the 3rd day of the trip onward was Don, and I cannot tell you how safe and cared for the whole tour felt with Don at the helm. He got to know each of us and our needs and he even put up with my need for lots of bathroom stops (giving us all a heads up when the next stop would be) because the one on the bus is only for emergencies. Don eventually sang for us as well, and he needs to give himself more credit, because he did well! His sense of humor and knowledge paired well with our friendly banter and curiosity as a tour group! The tour tended to focus on highlights and icons of Ireland, which is great for a first trip there. By the time we were scheduled for the 3rd distillery of the trip, we were kind of wanting to see something else, so my daughter and I decided to go to the Trinity Library tour and Book of Kells exhibit, and Don was understanding and checked in with us to assure we got back to the hotel safely. Can't thank Don enough for all he did on the tour and the effort he put into extra events we could choose to attend. I'd recommend this tour to anyone and I'd love to go back again through this company for another tour because I trust their staff and the way they do business!\n\nI just returned from the 14-Day Iconic Ireland and Scotland tour with My Ireland Tours and can't speak more highly of this tour and the company itself. From the time I scheduled the tour a year ago until the last moment when the tour ended and I was headed home on the plane, every step was well organized with helpful staff all along the way. The tour itself exceeded all my expectations. All the accomodations were wonderful. Our guide/driver, John Dennany, made a wonderful trip even more amazing. John went out of his way to ensure that each person on our tour enjoyed themselves even ensuring that personal requests were met such as extra stops along the way to visit areas that were significant to the guests family heritage. John took gloomy weather days and turned them into a fun adventure in order to ensure each day was enjoyable for the whole group. When there was a medical emergency within our tour group John again ensured that the guest was first priorty while still ensuring that the rest of the group did not miss out on anything that was scheduled. Even though I just returned, I am already looking at booking another trip with My Ireland Tours. I would highly recommend this tour company to anyone and also would suggest requesting John Dennany as your guide/drive...you will not be disappointed.\n\nOur 10-Day Iconic Scenes of Ireland vacation with My Ireland Tours was the trip of a lifetime. Our group of 9 had originally booked the trip for May 2020, but had to postpone due to the Pandemic. During the next three years several changes needed to be made and all were handled with total professionalism and good humor by our coordinator, Shannon O'Brien. She was so easy to work with and 'just made everything happen.' Every detail was executed perfectly, including providing us with a late transfer from Dublin Airport to the Dunboyne Castle Hotel due to the arrival time of our red-eye flight from San Francisco. Our driver/guide, Tony McGoey, proved to be expert in all things Irish with an encyclopedic knowledge of its history, geography, people, politics, and culture…not to mention being a fabulous storyteller and singer…as well as a virtuoso behind the wheel of a luxury bus! The tour schedule enabled us to see and experience so much of this wonderful country while not spending an inordinate time on the bus. Lots of time to explore castles, farms, pubs, and landmarks. Tony provided interesting and inciteful information throughout each segment of the days' trips, giving us tips on what to look for, where to go, places to eat and shop. Our trip took us from Dublin to Galway and through the Wild West and Ring of Kerry and back to Dublin. Along the way we visited such places as Kylemore Abbey, The Burren, Connemara, Cliffs of Moher, Blarney and the Woollen Mill, Christchurch Cathedral, the National Stud, and the Rock of Cashel with stops at Celtic Crystal to see how fine Irish lead crystal is cut, the Hazel Mountain Chocolate Factory where chocolate is made from roasted coffee beans, the Bog Village and the Red Fox Inn for the 'World's Best Irish Coffee,' an unforgettable sheep dog demonstration, lunch at the Blind Piper Pub for Ireland's Best Fish & Chips, the Jameson Distillery and Guinness Storehouse, and a local farm for a traditional farmhouse lunch. We even made a stop at Pat Cohan's Bar in Cong, made famous by the John Wayne/Maureen O'Hara movie, “The Quiet Man,” where some of us got to draw a pint of Guinness behind the bar. We also had several spontaneous adventures orchestrated by Tony and Shannon such as a horse drawn Jaunting Carriage ride with Susie (the horse) and Mark (the driver) to Ross Castle through the Killarney National Park and a delightful Sunday evening of music and fun at Canty's Pub in Cork with 86-year-old Joe Mac and his partner, Oliver. The final night of the tour was spent at the Merry Ploughboys where we were treated to authentic Irish music and dancing and a fantastic dinner! We stayed in lovely hotels, ate more great food than we ever thought possible and were treated like royalty. A couple of real side benefits were that the full-sized bus only had 26 passengers so we had lots of space to spread out, and we were able to stay 2 nights in 4 of the hotels, so we weren't having to pack up and move luggage every day! My Ireland Tours is a first-class company with outstanding personnel. They are organized, efficient, extremely fairly priced, have a great selection of excursions, and above all are committed to guest satisfaction. If (when) we go back to Ireland, this will be our tour company!\n\nMy first visit to Ireland, what a beautiful Country to see and learn more of its history. That of my family's fatherland. I had a wonderful time!! To then meet so many nice people on our Tour. Many thanks to the My Ireland Tour Co., its team, after being on their 10-day Deluxe Castle Tour. The 10-day itinerary was so fantastic; which allowed me, along with friends, and everyone on the tour to explore so much of what Ireland, of its beautiful destinations, has to offer a traveler. Ireland, its people, only welcome you with open arms. To hear this phrase as well, Cead Mile Failte, a hundred-thousand welcomes. Our driver, tour guide, Mark made the tour even nicer. Such a gentleman, friendly, with a good sense of humor, and being in his presence a person would then only sense that of his spirit and of his passion for his home, Ireland. Mark gave us all such insight each day of the tour's itinerary. So grateful to learn from his knowledge, sharing of Ireland's history and more. Also, to hear his handsome voice sing, The Fields of Athenry, as he told us more on the history of the famine. I would look to My Ireland Tour in the future, and will continue to brag about my wonderful, fun-filled experience. To then share My Ireland Tour Co. with family and friends. The fine, friendly hospitality extended and that of our accommodations and dining rooms were so luxurious and all the meals so delicious. I extend compliments to all the Chef's, their team, a true culinary experience for all the senses. I cannot say thank you enough. Thank you! A trip, a dream come true, to visit Ireland. I will be back one day.\n\nWe took the Northern Ireland tour this time and to our amazement, Colm Clarke was again our driver and guide. It truly felt like returning to see old friends. The tour was great, again Colm was so and made things so fun. Our guide in Belfast, Nollaig, was full of information and kept things lively even while talking about things like The Troubles. In Derry, our guide was Theresa, again a knowledgeable and passionate guide. We loved Bushmill's and Giant's Causeway. The Lough Erne Cruise and the trip to Devinish Island was almost magical with the mist rising up off the river as the sun got higher. Shannon set us up with a private tour from our wish list after Northern Ireland and it was everything we could have hoped for. We got to stay in the places we wanted to explore, stayed at great placed and the food was unbelievable good. We saw a lot in 6 days - Kilkenny Castle, Cobh and the Titanic Museum and the statue of Annie Moore, then on to Kinsale and the Lusitania Museum and Old Head, all the shops (such wonderful little hidden gems. Then we went to Dingle Peninsula and spent 2 days in a delightful BNB and explored. Our last days, we revisited the Cliffs of Moher and then to Galway and a day on the largest Aran Island. We couldn't have asked for a better day - water calm, no wind, and sunny. Our driver and Guide, Pat C. was great. He stopped for photos and had suggestions for others, always made sure we were well settled in our hotels and knew his stuff. Thanks for making our trip to Ireland, once again, a delightful and experience packed trip. We'll be back!\n\nMy two friends and I took the 10 Day Ireland Tour. Our driver/guide was Colm and he made the trip for us. It was a packed, well organized tour so that we could get in as much as we could. Colm made suggestions for eating, shopping, extra sights to see and would go out of his way to find something out for us, accommodate any requests, and gave us great information on the sights we were seeing and the history of Ireland. We saw so much and I know there is so much more to see. The hotels were amazing and the meals fantastic - the soups! There were 24 on our tour, just the right number, and Colm took the time to learn about each and every one of us. It's so hard to pick a favorite place but Connemara and the Ring of Kerry truly stand out. The weather cooperated and was nice, the bus was comfortable, clean and we were able to recharge our electronics, use wifi while we were traveling. I raved about this trip so much, my husband now wants to go. And I could go again because I am sure I missed things because there is so much to see. Martina, Colm, and the whole company made sure our 10 day tour was all that it could be. We didn't have to worry about logistics, Colm got us where we wanted to go, most of our meals were taken care of, and it was great not being in a different hotel every night. The 2 nights in a hotel was just right. Thanks My Ireland Tour for a wonderful experience.\n\nWe joined with a couple of friends for a 10-day bus tour in Ireland August 20-30, 2023. We were picked up at the airport in Dublin and taken to our first hotel. We had a wonderful trip. Our guide and bus driver was Toney McCoy. He is a terrific guide and very knowledgeable in the Irish history. We learned a lot from him. Not only is he very knowledgeable but he can also tell fun stories and sing. I only wish he could write down some of his stories and fun telling jokes to publish. Our tour went counter clockwise of the southern part of Ireland. We saw Clonmacnoise a fascinating historical site, we stopped by a local chocolate factory at Hazel mountain, and later a local crystal factory, Kylemore Abby in Connemara, and Dunguaire castle in Kinvarra. Our trip continued around the beautiful landscape of the Burren, Cliffs of Moher and the Ring of Kerry. We had a stop at the Blind piper pub for a delicious lunch. On our way we also tasted Jameson Whisky and later on Guinness in Dublin. We enjoyed a traditional farm house lunch that was excellent. We had an opportunity to visit Red Fox pub for the best Irish coffee. Our tour also took us to the Blarney Castle and we stopped to shop at the Blarney Wolleen Mills. We had a very short stop in Kinsale of 1 1/2 hour. I would have liked to have at least 3 hours here. It is very small town but a lot to see and do. Before returning to Dublin we visited an Irish National Stud stable, and in Dublin the Irish emigration museum which was excellent. We also made a visit to the Christ Church Cathedral in Dublin which dates back 1000 years. On our last night with the tour we enjoyed and evening at the Merry Ploughboy Pub for entertainment with song and dance and a excellent meal. When our tour ended we had two additional nights before returning home so we could also get to see the Book of Kells and have some more time to enjoy Dublin.\n\nWe were a party of 3 for the Iconic Ireland Tour, a senior couple and our teenage grandson to celebrate his school graduation. We unanimously agreed that the trip was a great experience for all of us. We had chosen My Ireland Tour company for this trip because of it being a family-run business out of County Cork, and due to their excellent on-line reviews. This trip did not disappoint and was everything that was advertised. From the Welcome and the timely pick-up at the airport, to the day of drop off for return home, we were impressed. They trully warrant a 5-Star rating. The selection of sites we viewed and/or visited were a good mix of urban and rural spots, with appropriate breaks from riding to walking/sight-seeing. Food options, as part of the tour or on our own, were excellent. The accommodations were consistently comfortable, with well-organized check-in. Room keys for the two rooms that we had booked were already assigned and immediately available upon arrival, making it efficient and easy to settle into our respective rooms. Baggage handling was timely and seamlessly handled by the hotel staff. What makes or breaks any tour, however, is the capacity and professionalism of the tour guide and driver. All 26 of us on the tour appreciated our Tour Guide, Tony McGoey. He was knowledgeable. He was funny. He shared his love of his beautiful country, and its music, with us. Tony was a good host. He was very personable and hospitable, making us feel that we were his guests and his good friends. For us, Tony's extensive knowledge of Irish history was so important to the whole tour. We came away with a much better understanding of Ireland, its people and their history. Not in a lecture, but in insightful learning. Thank you, Tony!\n\nAfter many months if research, we chose My Ireland Tour for our first visit to Ireland. We could not have picked a better company. From the booking process and our interaction with Shannon to our driver Tony, everything was amazing! We did the 10 Days Iconic Scenes Tour and it encompasses a ton of stops - some places we would not have thought of ourselves. The smaller Tour size on the bigger bus was an added bonus. Plenty of room to stretch out. Tony made sure we knew all the history of Ireland as far back as the 500s. A very sad tale, but certainly speaks volumes to the resilient, amazing people we met along the way. The scenery is so beautiful- from Conamara, to the Wild West and around the Ring Of Kerry. We enjoyed all the off the beaten path stops, as well as the more famous ones. We would have enjoyed more time in some of the smaller stops, like Kinsale, but it gave us the start of a list for a return trip. Hotels were high end, however only a couple had AC, which proved to be a challenge especially with only a duvet cover and no top sheet. Spent most nights quite warm due to a random heat wave while we were there. Meals were very good, albeit repetitive. If you have a free lunch or dinner, find some wood-fired pizza. The Irish do it surprisingly well! The tour included tours of many well known sites as well as a traditional Irish dinner at a local pub, which we all thoroughly enjoyed. Plus, we learned a song or two from our guide. We weren't sure we'd be able to do a tour as being on the go for that long and having to socialize that much is sometimes taxing, but there were plenty of periods of down time. By the end of the tour, we had made several new friends and we were sad to say goodbye. We wouldn't hesitate to do another tour with My Ireland Tour!\n\nOur My Ireland 10 day tour taken at the beginning of September was really enjoyable and the scenery and sites we visited were beautiful, We were a small group but on a large, very comfortable coach so we had space to move around and also had all the benefits that go with a group of that size. Tony, our driver/guide was amazing. It made such a difference having an Irish guide who was able to tell us so much about the history, culture and politics of Ireland and the Irish people. It was fascinating and we came away with a much greater understanding. All the discourse was very well paced and mostly also linked in with what we were seeing, such as the peat bogs and the Penny walls. There were always plenty of “comfort breaks”, usually linked to another visit of interest of which there were many, though thankfully none of these were long and none involved visits to places where there was any pressure to buy things, as so often happens on other coach tours. Being a 10 day tour we never felt as though we were rushing from place to place and also having 2 nights in most hotels was a bonus. The accommodation was excellent, as were most of the meals. The only negative was that some of the latter tended to be repetitive and predictable, particularly with mashed potato and carrot as the only vegetable and so often with apple pie for desert! There were always 3 choices of the starter and main course but rarely a vegetarian option. Another totally separate slight grievance was the advertised transport from and to Dublin airport. There was no transport at all available for arrivals after 11.30 am or for afternoon departures and there was no flexibility at all here which was disappointing. All in all though it was a great tour and, though expensive compared to many others we looked at, it was worth it and was a totally enjoyable and very memorable trip. Definitely a company to be recommended to others, as it had been to me!\n\nMy husband and I just returned from the 14 day Scotland and Ireland tour and if was a fantastic vacation for us. We had never been overseas before and were nervous but our tour driver, Colm, made our trip go smoothly and without incident. We saw places we would have never known to go if we would have been on our own. The entire itinerary was full and we were moving quickly to see everything, but every place we went was well worth the drive. There were times we had to travel 2 hours between spots but Colm made the trip fun and told us stories and gave us so much history. He was extremely knowledgeable. From the time we left Edinburgh until we arrived in Dublin, we had such an amazing experience visiting so many sites. The Lough Eske castle was truly the most beautiful place to stay but the Menlo hotel was not my favorite at all. We were exhausted at the end of our trip but we saw everything we wanted to and more. I highly recommend this company. From the booking until the end it went off without a hitch. Shannon and the team answered emails and questions immediately. I would definitely travel with them again. Thank you for a great vacation!\n\nWe just returned home from the Deluxe Irish Castle Tour, and it was definitely 5+++++stars! It was magical - everything we could have hoped for. I'll just say, on behalf of our group, we are having major Ireland withdrawals. It was such a spectacular tour (thank you My Ireland Tour)- everything from the service, the gourmet food, the 5-star accommodations, the scenery, and visits were just fabulous. From the brilliant tour by Rowan in Derry/Londonderry, the delightful chocolate factory (who knew), the shopping in Galway, the beautiful grounds of Lough Eske (we did a sunrise walk around the grounds), the castles, ancestry old haunts, Dublin fun, the Ring of Kerry, the Cliffs - EVERYDAY WAS SOMETHING SPECIAL! Each hotel was so unique and fabulous. I would recommend this trip be extended at least another day or two to get a chance to enjoy and relax at the resorts. Of course, the weather was very typical for Ireland - we had all 4 seasons in one day! But - Tom had arranged for the sun to be out during the Ring of Kerry and the Cliffs so we got the most gorgeous pictures. The breakfasts were delicious/full Irish. We always had time for a quick bite or nice lunch while on the road, so not to worry. The Blind Piper Pub was much fun and delicious. The gourmet dinners were fabulous only to be topped by the deserts! All of this was due to our spectacular tour guide, Tom Levin. Tom showed us how special Ireland really is. It's their people, the historic places, their music, their culture and history with their beautiful land. We are so grateful to have experienced this land and the tour with Tom as our guide. He took care of everything for us (all done behind the scenes too). He had a few surprises up his sleeve for us during the trip which were extra and really great (fairies, juice and dogs)! He was a professional for sure, a great driver and had a sense of humor too. A really fun bus load of people made our trip very special, and we have great memories and lots of pictures! It was perfect.\n\nI just returned from the extraordinary 10-day Deluxe Castle Tour. This was my second time touring with My Ireland Tours, and I have already decided to book for a third tour in 2024. From start to finish this tour was a stellar experience! The major reason this tour was such a memorable experience is our tour guide and driver, Tom Lavin. Tom is personable and professional with a quick wit and spot on sense of humor. He is a consummate professional driver, and took extremely good care of us. Tom is a great ambassador for My Ireland Tours. He kept us totally engrossed in Ireland's beautiful landscape and history as we toured the length and breadth of Ireland. I am still in awe at how much Tom can recount of the history and information for each stop we made along the tour. Starting from the North to Derry and then down the West coast to the South, through the Ring of Kerry and back up the East coast to the very special K Club. Our accommodations at Lough Eske Castle, Glenlo Abbey, and Cahernane House, and the K Club were all top notch, with fabulous gourmet food and attentive and professional staff. We also had a great fun group that made the long jaunts on the bus that much more enjoyable. Course you know that means 'Mimi' and the rest of her 'crew'! One of the highlights of this tour was a very enjoyable luncheon at the Blind Piper Pub...fabulous fish and chips and lovely friendly people. Another highlight I cannot fail to mention was Ronan McNamara, our guide in Derry/Londonderry, who shared his expert knowledge of the history of this city. If I could give this tour a hundred stars I would gladly do so. Thanks Tom, you made it a special memory for all of us! A special thank you also to Eric O'Gorman and Keith for making the booking process seamless and easy, and answering all my questions.\n\nWe just completed the 10 Day Iconic Ireland tour with our wonderful driver/guide, Tony. I cannot say enough good things about this tour. The highlights: *Great itinerary *Perfect pacing - I was concerned about too much bus time but we were never on the bus for more than 1.5 hours before a break or stop for sightseeing. Most days started at 9 am and we were back to hotel by 5 pm which allowed time to rest before dinner. *Our guide, Tony, was the best. He shared history, facts, stories in such an interesting way. Also, he talked just the right amount. Usually there was more talking in the morning and less in the afternoon, which is great when you're tired. He is also kind and funny and connected well with our group. *I loved how Tony would tell us enough about the place before we got there. Then we would have free time or a guide. We didn't have to follow him around from place to place. I always felt like the stops had just the right amount of time - not too long and not too short. *The hotels were very nice. *All of the dinners were included which was great. After a long day of touring, it's nice to NOT have to think about what to do for dinner. Food and service was great at all hotels. *While you don't always have flexibility on a tour to go where you want, it was really nice not to have to worry about driving, getting tickets, etc. We walked right into every site. No lines, no waiting. After traveling on our own for a few days before the tour, it was kind of nice to not have to make many decisions. *The group size is limited to 24. Bus was very nice with comfortable seats (and 34 seats so room to spread out), WiFi and good sound from the driver/guide. My Ireland Tours was great from start to finish. I had to make a change in our reservation and the response time was quick. All communication was excellent and we were well prepared. If you're looking for a tour, the 10 Day Iconic Ireland is a great one!\n\nI would like to express my sincerest appreciation for the staff at My Ireland Tours. I booked the week-long historic castle tour as a gift for my son's high school graduation. It was his first time out of the United States and the first mother-son trip that we have ever taken together. First, Shannon was incredibly helpful in providing me with answers to questions regarding the booking so that there were zero concerns before my arrival. Second, I had by far the BEST tour guide that I could have imagined. Colm was amazing! He was incredibly attentive to all of us and made me feel completely safe and welcome. The itinerary for the week was just the right amount of time to see many of the main attractions in Ireland. I have heard and seen other schedules where too many activities were packed into each day. But this one was paced just right. The size of the tour was great in that it was large enough to have a nice variety of other fellow travelers to get to know, but intimate enough to feel like we were a nice little family by the end of the tour! I especially enjoyed getting a history of Ireland as we toured through the countryside. As a person of color who also has her own Irish roots, it was nice to see the connection of Ireland to other cultures acknowledged by both our driver and in the amazing interactivity of the EPIC museum in Dublin. It was a welcome reminder that we all have a shared history as part of the human experience. Overall, the trip far exceeded all expectations. I fell in love with the country, with the people, and with this company. I sing nothing but the highest praises for My Ireland Tours!\n\nI recently returned from the 6-day Iconic Scenes of Ireland tour. I was traveling with my husband and our 14 year-old son. We all enjoyed the tour so much. We felt that it was very well paced - we were able to see a lot of the different regions of Ireland and hit the highlights, but it never felt overwhelming or exhausting. There was always time to relax with a drink in a pub or enjoy a leisurely meal or do some exploring on our own. We also liked that, while a couple of the attractions we visited had guided tours, we weren't herded around as a group the entire time. Many times, we were dropped off at a location and told what time to meet back on the bus, but then we could decide what we wanted to do/see at that particular place (whether it was a town/city or someplace like the Blarney Castle or Cliffs of Moher). I appreciated the balance between a structured itinerary and some freedom within that framework. Our driver/guide, Brian, was friendly, helpful, always in good spirits, and he was an excellent driver, navigating the winding cliffs and corkscrew turns on narrow roads with ease! He was very knowledgeable about Ireland and shared helpful tidbits of history, local culture and language, and Irish music along the way. The coach bus was spacious and very comfortable with large windows, air conditioning, footrests, and plush seats. We had 23 people on the tour and the bus could have fit twice as many, so plenty of room to spread out and relax. The time on the coach was a great time to catch a catnap or take in the gorgeous scenery. The hotels we stayed at were modern and comfortable, and most importantly, they were centrally located near restaurants and other attractions. In Dublin, we were able to walk to St. Stephen's Green, Trinity College, Grafton Street, which was so convenient. The hub-and-spoke format of the tour itinerary was great because we only had to move hotels one time, but still got to see a lot of the country. Everything was generally well organized and ran smoothly, which made for a stress-free trip! I wouldn't hesitate to go on another My Ireland Tour trip, and I will certainly recommend them to others.\n\nMy wife and I, along with 6 other family members, did the 10 day Iconic Scenes of Ireland Tour from July 10-19, 2023. It was fantastic and very well run. Our driver, Tony, did a great job of keeping us informed of the schedule each day so there was never any question as to when or where we needed to be at any time. He was very amusing and I especially appreciated all of the historical and cultural information he imparted along the way. This gave me a real appreciation for the country and its people and made the trip more than just an amazing sightseeing trip, although it was that too. Along with the major tourist attractions, we got to see some lesser-known, but equally interesting places like Hazel Mountain Chocolates, an incredible sheep dog demonstration, and the beautiful work of the artisans at the Celtic Crystal factory. We also had a delicious home-cooked lunch at a farmhouse Bed & Breakfast that brought back childhood memories of meals that my grandmother cooked. It's impossible to pick out a single highlight. The small group size (we had a total of 23 people) was perfect because we had plenty of room to spread out on the bus. We never felt like we were part of a large mob being herded from one place to the next, and the bus was immaculate and very comfortable. I highly recommend this tour and this company.\n\nI am so happy that I discovered My Ireland Tour! Our family of seven adults and 9 month old grandson just returned from a fantastic 10 day iconic tour of Ireland. Kristel O'Connor was very timely with her emails to me regarding our reservations and was very accommodating with our requests for a baby cart seat and cots in hotel room. The hotels were super, including the breakfasts. We stayed at the Hardiman Hotel in Galway, the Drumhall Hotel in Killarney, the Imperial Hotel in Cork and the Alex Hotel in Dublin. I was initially disappointed that we were not able to stay at the hotel in Kinsale but the Imperial Hotel in Cork was beautiful and the staff were excellent, in fact it was my favorite hotel. We had a private sprinter van that seated nine passengers plus two seats for the driver and guide. The van had large side windows so everyone had a wonderful view at all times. Our driver, David Darby was also excellent, with impressive driving skills! He was very timely with our pickups and accommodating with our requests for small changes in the agenda. He provided a lot of information about the places we visited and kept us entertained with his many jokes. Our Dublin guide, Denise, was also excellent as were our two relief drivers, Joe and Sam. My husband and I are from Ireland, and our family has had many trips to Ireland in the past. The tour included places we had never visited and some places that we visited a long time ago; we have never seen so many places in one visit. We also had some fantastic meals during our visit and only one day of rain!! I am not a fan of big tour groups but would definitely recommend a small group tour with My Ireland Tour and will consider going on another one myself.\n\nWhen we decided to make a journey to Ireland, we searched through many websites and landed on My Ireland Tours because of their reputation for great excursions and the sense of family woven into the business. And when we emailed Eric, all of our concerns faded away - our 10-day tour of historic Deluxe Irish Castles was brought to life! Rick and I were celebrating both my 60th birthday and our 15th wedding anniversary and were hoping to see much of Ireland while staying in best-in-class hotels. We were not disappointed! We met our careful and unbelievably skilled tour guide Eamonn Broderick and it was immediately apparent that he was a prolific storyteller and engaged us in many, MANY stories! He was the perfect host for this adventure; he single-handedly kept us all in stitches throughout the journey. The accommodations were all excellent - 4 and 5 stars; each unique in its own way. The hospitality and meals at each location were superb. Meals presented the perfect opportunity to engage with others on our trip. Throughout the days and evenings, we were able to share meals with everyone and had very special moments with each of them. We enjoyed a few meals 'on the road. 'A highlight was lunch at The Blind Piper Pub; since 1865 serving the best fish & chips and beef & Guinness pie (and Guinness Stout)! In addition to the planned itinerary, Eammon scheduled an impromptu visit to Atlantic Sheepdogs in Streedagh, Grange, north of County Sligo (nestled in between the Atlantic Ocean and beneath the tabletop of Benbulben Mountain). The enterprise is run by Martin and Trish Feeney (with three children and Martin's wonderful father and mother who live next to the farm) and has been winning awards since Martin was 11-years old (the youngest ever to win). Martin and “Mol' were so closely choreographed with one another….Mol would do whatever Martin commanded with his whistle! Their exploits were stunning! We stopped for classic photo opportunities along the way and visited towns where we could shop for keepsakes and to simply get a flavor of Irish life. We were most impressed with Kylemore Abbey. Built as a castle in 1868 with a thousand acres of land, the Abbey had so much to discover, we would have liked an entire day to discover its many wonders. We could not leave the Abbey without trying their warm apple pie with custard (highly recommended by Eammon) - oh, what a delight! We even had dinner in authentic carriages from the Orient Express at Glenlo Abbey Hotel & Estate with 138-acres of meticulous, five-star quality! And, of course, our final lodging was the K Club, a five-star estate founded in 1832 with 550-acres of lush property. Everything about this property was spectacular - a genuine treat for our 'family' of twenty-six. Our review is 5-stars because everything that was promised was delivered! We tip our hats to Eric and My Ireland Tours, Eamonn - an excellent ambassador, and 'the family' we came to know and love for a most memorable trip!\n\nMy wife and I took your 14 day Iconic Scenes tour in mid-June could not be more pleased with the experience. From our first evening dinner to airport drop-off when leaving everything was set up to make things easy and enjoyable. All the hotels were very nice and meals were also good. We had never taken a trip like this before so had a little doubt about how it would go but we quickly saw how well everything was planned out. Not having to drive allowed me to actually look out the windows and the added height of the bus gave a much better view of everything than a car.(and probably saving several local drivers from dodging a rental car on the wrong side of the road!) Arriving at attractions and basically walking right in is something you can't do on your own as the tour arranges times and buys the tickets. At many of the locations there was a local guide which added to the experience. The coach itself was more comfortable than I thought it would be, both ride and noise. If I had anything to change (and this is a minor point to me) there was a time when meals got a little repetitive. I have to mention the people of Ireland as some of the nicest people I have ever run across. They were sometimes offering directions before we knew we were lost. (maybe I just have that look) Lastly, I would like to give our driver/guide John thanks for making everything so easy and fun. I appreciated his 'realness' and humor and additionally wanted to thank him for hanging back on some of the walks to make sure I was OK. For anyone looking to take this type of tour I would suggest you call here first and save yourself some time.\n\nWe all loved our first 'cousins trip' with My Ireland Tour in 2019 so much that when we decided to arrange a second one for summer 2023, without a moment's hesitation, we turned once again to My Ireland Tour. With the bar set so high from the first trip, I doubted the second could surpass it - but somehow it did. It was no mean feat for My Ireland Tour's owner Eric O'Gorman to help us organize a private 10-day tour that successfully accommodated - and entertained ' an age range from 11 to 80. During the planning stage, he patiently answered questions and made changes to the itinerary to work in everyone's requests. The accommodations he arranged for us were terrific – especially memorable were the fabulous Ballynahinch Castle, Faithlegg House, and Dingle Skellig Hotel. Our 2019 driver-guide Ben Sullivan took care of us on the road once again (at our request), and was once again a delight. We all appreciated the tour's 2 nights, 1 night, 2 nights, 1 night, etc. structure, so we didn't have to pack up and move every morning. It will be a very, very long time before I forget our amazing day on Inismore in the Aran Islands, or our night of music and Irish dancing in The Dingle Pub (to name just two of the many highlights). Thank you, My Ireland Tour, for helping us add wonderful new stories to our family memory bank.\n\nThis review is for the 14 - day Iconic Scenes of Ireland tour which we took in June, 2023. We cannot add anything new to the already posted, glowing reviews of the company with which we agree wholeheartedly, including those with shout-outs to Shannon for consistently rapid responses to our pre-tour queries. Even given those reviews, the tour exceeded our expectations. The main purpose for this review is to have our Driver-Guide, Cathal, mentioned by name as being excellent in both the guide and driver capacities. My Ireland Tours states: “You can expect your tour guide to be... 100% Irish Passionate about Ireland Fully Qualified as an Irish Guide An experienced professional An expert on Irish history and culture Impeccably safe in all driving conditions Fully committed to your care' We can vouch that Cathal was passionate about Ireland, willingly and engagingly shared his vast knowledge about the country and kept us safe in all driving conditions. As far as we can tell, he met the other expectations too. Beyond these explicit qualifications, Cathal was personable, sharing personal perspectives and anecdotes which enriched our experience of the country. He answered questions readily and had a knack for keeping the mood of the group light. He responded to some slight teasing with good humour. Importantly, being a model guide, we never once had to ask where the toilet facilities were; at every single stop Cathal provided that information. Yes, that is important! Thank you, Cathal. Thank you My Ireland Tours for providing us with the experience that lived up to your reputation'\n\nWe took the '14 Day Iconic Scenes of Ireland Tour' starting 17 June 2023. It was a wonderful tour that delivered everything promised. The hotels were first-rate, the meal choices were good, and the sights were indeed iconic. In these current days of massive airline delays and flight cancellations, we booked flights to arrive a day in advance, and booked a room in the Dunboyne hotel for the night before first night of the tour. As it happened, our flight from Dallas was delayed from a 10 AM arrival to 6 PM in Dublin. The hotel was gorgeous, and we had a delicious dinner in the bar of the hotel. We slept in till noon the next morning, and then met some of our companions on the tour as they made it to the hotel. Except for tours around Belfast and Dublin, we traveled mostly through the countryside, on two lane, sometimes quite narrow roads. Coming from Arizona, USA, what struck us the most was how GREEN everything was: Ireland truly deserves the name of the 'Emerald Isle'. All the hillsides covered with small fields, divided by hedgerows in the north, and stone walls in the south, with every field having its complement of sheep, cattle, or sometimes both. And all the well-kept houses along the way, many with stone fronts and flowers blooming everywhere. Our driver/guide, Cathal Clarke, was a fount of information on Irish history, both Northern Ireland and the Irish Republic, as well as being personable and funny. He always made sure we were where we were supposed to be and knew how much time we had and when to be back to the bus.\n\nMy wife and I had what has got to be one of the best trips of our lifetime with My Ireland Tours, the Iconic Ireland and Scotland 14 day tour. Becky has always been interested in the monarchy of the U.K. What a treat to have walked where Mary Queen of Scots and other royals walked. We even had lunch in a cute little restaurant where Prince William had his first date, and according to the restaurant manager we spoke to, numerous subsequent dates, with Princess Kate. The magnificence of the beautiful cathedrals we visited along with the many castles and palaces helped to make this a real trip of a lifetime. Thankfully we were told early on In Edinburgh that touching the noise of the statue of Greyfriar's Bobby would bring good luck, because doing so helped us to have wonderful weather for most of the trip. Pat our tour guide/driver was so much more than that. Yes, he was extremely knowledgeable, and constantly kept us informed about the history and geology of the areas we visited, but he also went out of his way to make sure that our trip was as special as it could possibly be. He became a good friend, and my wife even told me the other day that she misses him. Thanks Pat, for all you did to make this a truly wonderful trip. Hal and Becky Gersch.\n\nSeveral months ago, my wife and I decided to celebrate our 50th wedding anniversary by taking our ten family members, aged from 81 to 11 years, on a tour of the Republic of Ireland---a country that we did not know. Searching the internet, I lighted on My Ireland Tours and entered into contact with Keith O'Driscoll. We wanted a tour which emphasised Irish history, culture, small villages, and landscapes. (Dublin, we decided, we could organise on our own). Keith could not have been more patient, accommodating and helpful in his suggestions over the course of many emails and phone calls. The seven day tour exceeded our expectations. My Ireland Tours contracted O'Callaghan Coaches to provide a new commodious bus driven by the guide, Keith Boyd (more later). The tour organised by Keith O'Driscoll was excellently paced, covering all which we wanted to see. The accommodations were excellent (The Dublin Gresham, undergoing renovations, was a little too tour group intensive, to my mind) and the sites selected responded perfectly to our interest in Irish cultural history. Everything was efficiently done. Keith Boyd, the guide, really made the trip the great success it was. Beyond being a skilled and safe driver along the country roads which dominated our tour, he was a fount of knowledge of the history, lore, culture, gastronomy and even sports of each county visited. Keith was most generous with his time, occasionally exceeding his scheduled hours to accompany us to certain cultural events outside the programme. He related wonderfully to the three kids on the trip, taking their incessant questions in stride. In the end, we really felt that we had made a friend whom we would wish to visit if we returned to Ireland. We cannot say enough good things about our My Ireland Tour arrangements.\n\nMy wife and I thoroughly enjoyed our tour. My Ireland Tours is very efficient and responsive. Everything was well planned and and ran smoothly. Our driver/guide also was terrific. Peter kept us on schedule and told us a great deal about Irish history, the sites we were visiting, the climate, the terrain, the government and many other topics. He worked extremely hard and went out of his way to help people on the tour and to show us things that were not mentioned as part of the tour but that he knew about and wanted to share with us. Our visit to the Cliffs of Moher was uncomfortable, but that certainly wasn't the fault of the tour company. The wind that day was blowing at gale force, approaching hurricane force, which make it hard to keep upright, hold the camera, etc. It also was very crowded with people, which wouldn't have mattered if it was a nice sunny day with a gentle breeze. But given the weather, visitors, including us, snapped a few picture then headed for the shelter of the visitor center/cafeteria, which was so crowded that it was hard to move about, use the bathrooms and get something to eat. The Cliffs are Ireland's number one tourist attraction, so people considering a trip to Ireland need to be aware that a visit to the Cliffs may not turn out to be all that great -- for reasons that are uncontrollable. The other thing I want to point out is that Ireland is bigger than many may realize, so the sites you want to see may involve a lot of driving time. That was the case for our tour. There were two days in particular where we drove for many hours, and while there were stops along the way we still spent an awful lot of time on the road. The solution to that problem is either to focus on just one corner of the country, or book a trip with more days so that there is time to break up the tour into smaller chunks. These are just gene"
