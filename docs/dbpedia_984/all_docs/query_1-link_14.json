        "meta_description": "Belfast is a maritime city of global trade and emigration to the four corners of the world. Even in the early 1600s when our city was still just a village, Belfast’s merchants were mostly Scottish and traded with North America (tobacco), the West Indies (sugar) and Spain (wine). A ship built in Belfast Lough in 1636, the Eagle Wing, attempted to cross the Atlantic Ocean. In 1778, the U.S. Navy won its first victory here in Belfast Lough. Much of the Allied war effort during two World Wars came from our shores and shipyards.",

        "text": "The First Ritchie Ship Sails To New York\n\nIn July 1792 they launched their first ship, the Hibernia (said to have been named as a sign of support for the ‘United Irishmen’ cause of the 1790s which was dominated by Presbyterians). It had an ‘American bottom’ hull design. As her maiden voyage was to New York, this design shrewdly exploited a loophole in American customs duty and meant that the Belfast merchants would benefit from an attractive 5% discount on the duty due on goods they exported into the United States.\n\nDry Dock Built\n\nOn New Year’s Day 1800 the new century began with the opening of a new ‘dry dock’ in Belfast, built by the Ritchies and named ‘No. 1 Graving Dock’. It allowed three ships to be docked at the same time. It survives today, behind the Belfast Harbour Commissioners offices, a clue to the existence of the Ritchie Shipyard it used to lie beside. The Ritchies built over 40 ships; Belfast vessels were now trading regularly with North America and the Caribbean.\n\nSuccessors to the Ritchies: full-rigged ships, tea from China and a ‘floating palace’\n\nCharles Connell, another Ayrshire shipbuilder, came to Belfast to work for the Ritchies around 1815. His wife, Ann Hamilton, and almost all of their children came too – however their eldest son John remained in Scotland. Charles became manager of Ritchie’s yard, and when William Ritchie retired Connell continued to run the yard. When Ritchie died in 1834 Connell took the company over, renaming it ‘Charles Connell & Son’. Their first major contract was to remove a stranded ship which was blocking the entrance to Belfast harbour. Connell summoned every soldier from the Belfast garrison to pull the ship with ropes, far enough to re-float.\n\nGlobal Trade\n\nTheir first ship was a schooner, Jane, launched in 1825, and soon they were building ships for global trade. The Fanny was the first ship to bring tea to Belfast from China. It was said that ‘the shipping of Belfast extends over every part of the world where shipping can go’. The Aurora was launched in 1838, the biggest vessel ever built in Belfast up to that time. She was built for another Scottish firm with Ulster connections - George and John Burns of Glasgow. A crowd of 15,000 people gathered for the launch. Aurora broke the record for travel between Belfast and Glasgow and such was the luxury of her craftsmanship she was described as a ‘floating palace’.\n\nThe Connells who had stayed in Scotland also founded a shipyard. This entrepreneurial family had two companies in the thriving, world-class, Ulster-Scots shipbuilding industry, both bearing the name Charles Connell and Sons. Charles Connell was succeeded by his eldest son, Alexander (Sandy) Connell. The family’s connections with Belfast’s maritime industry continue to the present day.\n\n‘Gentleman apprentices’ Walter and Alexander Wilson join the shipbuilding industry\n\nThe most famous names in Belfast shipbuilding history are of course Harland & Wolff, the name of the greatest shipyard in the world - and the yard where Titanic was built. Yet ‘The Big Yard’ grew steadily from humbler origins.\n\nScottish Roots Shared With A President\n\nWalter Henry Wilson and his brother Alexander entered the shipbuilding trade in 1855 when they joined as ‘gentlemen apprentices’. Their paternal grandfather was Walter Wilson of Croglin in Dumfriesshire, Scotland. He moved to Ulster and became involved in the linen industry at Ballydrain between Belfast and Lisburn. The 28th President of the United States, Woodrow Wilson, also claimed descent from the same Scottish family. The Wilson brothers’ other grandparents were also either Scottish or of Scottish descent.\n\nYork Street - Home Of The Wilsons, Edward Harland And Gustav Wolff\n\nThe brothers were born at Maryville on the Lisburn Road in Belfast and educated at the Moravian College at Gracehill near Ballymena. Following their father’s death, the family home had to be rented out and, along with their mother, they moved to rooms in York Street in Belfast’s thriving maritime district. They started work at Robert Hickson’s shipyard in 1857, under the supervision of Edward Harland, who also lived in York Street. Another neighbour, just across the road in Brougham Street, was an ambitious young man called Gustav Wolff.\n\nThe next year Hickson’s yard was taken over by Harland; it was renamed ‘Harland and Wolff’ in 1861. Walter Henry Wilson became one of the top draughtsmen in the company and in 1874 he became a board director. Walter Wilson was general manager and his brother Alexander was in charge of engine design. In 1882 the company’s 150th ship was named Walter H Wilson in honour of his contribution to the firm.\n\nLifeboat Design Rejected\n\nSignificantly, Carlisle suggested a new design which would enable the ships to carry four times more lifeboats than the law required, but this was rejected by White Star Line. Tragically, the shortage of lifeboats was a major factor in the huge loss of life when Titanic sank. He was heartbroken by the disaster.\n\nHe retained high-level political connections - he offered to mediate in the War of Independence in Ireland in the 1920s, and had a close relationship with Kaiser Wilhelm II of Germany. He died in 1926 in London, where his memorial tablet at Golders Green bears the simple inscription ‘Shipbuilder – Belfast’."
