        "text": "My full name is Thomas Gregory Fewer, though I'm known as 'Greg' to my friends (and occasionally by such nicknames as 'Indy' or 'The G'). Though Montr�al-born and (consequently) a Canadian citizen, I have lived in Ireland since 1974. My mother, Suzanne Cormier-Fewer, is descended from early 17th-century pioneering French settlers in what is now Qu�bec, Canada (and ultimately, it seems, through her ancestor Michel Le Neuf, from Charlemagne, Holy Roman Emperor [AD 800-814]). My father, Thomas N. Fewer, is a member of an old County Kilkenny (Ireland) family of Gaelic origin. I have one brother named Pierre S. Fewer.\n\nGreg Fewer at the age of five.\n\nMost of my schooling was gained in Ireland in Catholic, Anglican and Quaker schools. My secondary school years were spent as a day pupil at the Quaker-run (but non-denominational) Newtown School, in Waterford city, Ireland. As a point of interest, Irish pop singer Sin�ad O'Connor was a year ahead of me when I was at Newtown. Irish historian Roy (R. F.) Foster also attended the school during the 1960s (his father, Frederick, gave me grinds in Irish as I prepared for my Leaving Cert.).\n\nI subsequently graduated from University College Cork (Ireland) in 1989 with a BA (double honours) in Archaeology and History. I then completed an MA thesis at University College Cork in 1993 on 'Land tenure in south Kilkenny, c.1800-1850' - copies of which are available at the Boole Library (University College, Cork, Ireland) and at Waterford Municipal Library (Lady Lane, Waterford, Ireland).\n\nGreg Fewer trowelling at Pointe-�-Calli�re, Montr�al (1989).\n\nI have worked on archaeological excavations in Ireland and Canada at the following sites: Ballyman (Co. Dublin, Ireland, 1983: Late Iron Age/Early Christian), Ferriter's Cove (Co. Kerry, Ireland, 1985: Mesolithic campsite), The Old Garda Barracks (Fermoy, Co. Cork, Ireland, 1987: post-medieval site), Knockadoon Hill (Lough Gur, Co. Limerick, 1988: Beaker period-Iron Age), Pointe-�-Calli�re (Montr�al, Qu�bec, 1989: Late Woodlandian-20th century AD; now a museum), and the Viking/medieval excavations in the city centre of Waterford City (Ireland, 1990). I also worked with the student team that surveyed the Bronze Age boulder burial at Cooradarrigan (near Schull, Co. Cork, 1988) and provided some slight assistance (over 1985-86) to the Bally Lough Archaeological Project in east Waterford.\n\nThis 19th-century windmill at Ballinvella, in eastern Co. Waterford, featured in an undergraduate survey project I carried out while at UCC.\n\nWhile at college, I performed the duties of second year representative (1987-88) and honorary secretary of the university's Archaeological Society (1988-89). I also sat on the student Class Council of University College Cork in 1988. In the summers of 1990 and 1992, I filled the role of curator-cum-tour guide of Reginald's Tower (then the civic museum of Waterford), serving as a history tutor at University College Cork in the interlude.\n\nI now work primarily as a part-time lecturer at Waterford Institute of Technology, where I am currently on research leave and where I have taught communications, European history, modern Irish social history and local archaeology. I have also lectured on medieval Irish history and and tutored on early modern European history at National University of Ireland, Maynooth, where I attempted to do a PhD in history.\n\nA member (from 1993 to 1998) of the editorial committee of Decies, the journal of the Waterford Archaeological and Historical Society - and its editor for its 1998 and 1999 volumes - I have had articles and reviews published in a range of periodicals including Decies, Old Kilkenny Review, Trial Trench, New Scientist, The Munster Express, Group for the Study of Irish Historic Settlement Newsletter, Mining Heritage Society of Ireland Newsletter, Journal of the Shropshire Mining and Caving Club, At the Edge, Waterford Today, History Ireland, Archaeological Computing Newsletter, assemblage, Journal of the Royal Society of Antiquaries of Ireland, International Longboarder Magazine and Adventures Unlimited (a role-playing game magazine). I have also contributed chapters to the books The Famine in Waterford 1845-1850: Teacht na bprata� dubha (1995; Dublin: Geography Publications with Waterford County Council; edited by Des Cowman and Donald Brady), Digging holes in popular culture: archaeology and science fiction (2002; [Bournemouth University School of Conservation Sciences Occasional Paper, 7] Oxford: Oxbow Books); edited by Miles Russell with a preface by the late Douglas Adams [author of Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy]) and Humanities in Waterford Institute of Technology: essays in honour of Tony Scott (1999; Waterford: Waterford Institute of Technology; edited by Michael Howlett & Shane Kilcommins). I also regularly wrote abstracts for British & Irish Archaeological Bibliography (and its precursor, British Archaeological Bibliography) between 1992 and 2003. A few brief book reviews of mine on (predominantly Irish) archaeology also appear on the Council for British Archaeology's Book Listing Service on the Internet (at http://www.britarch.ac.uk/books/books.html). For further details of my publications, see my bibliography.\n\nSince July 2001, I've taken to a new passion - longboard skateboarding! Still very much a beginner and, preferably, a 'fair weather skateboarder', I can occasionally be seen riding my longboard in Tramore and other localities in eastern County Waterford. Would love to hear from/meet up with anybody sharing a similar interest in the south-east of Ireland. In January of this year, I set up a Rollerblading and Skateboarding Club for staff and students at Waterford Institute of Technology. I've written in more detail about my skateboarding interests here.\n\nTower house at Dunmore East, Co.

In the process, he got to explore Brussels and to visit Louvain/Leuven as well as the village of Arschott. Brussels and Louvain retain some of their medieval and seventeenth-century architecture, much of it magnificent in appearance and in the quality of the conservation work involved. There was a tendency for the late medieval town halls to outshine the otherwise impressive churches, cathedrals and abbeys of Belgium's towns, a reverse of the situation typically found in Ireland. Brussels also has a gallery/museum dedicated to comic-strip art, which any fan of Tintin (or indeed many other comic-strip heroes) should visit.\n\nSeptember-December 2006\n\nGreg again lectured part-time on behalf of the Dept of Modern History at National University of Ireland, Maynooth, in late medieval/early modern Irish history for the BA (Local & Community Studies) programme of NUI Maynooth's Dept of Adult Education.\n\n15 November 2006\n\nGreg was elected as equality officer of the Waterford Colleges branch of the Teachers' Union of Ireland (TUI).\n\n17-19 January 2007\n\nGreg attended the TUI training course for branch officers at the Hodson Bay Hotel, Athlone.\n\n30 January 2007\n\nGreg was interviewed by Spacearchaeology.org's Steve Wilson over a couple of e-mail exchanges in January.
