        "text": "A CERTAIN town in the west of Ireland seems at first to offer no reason to linger beyond the time it takes to refuel your car. It has no shop selling Celtic knickknacks, no pub with performances of ditties on the half-hour. Even its name lacks the lyricism found in those of more famous Irish destinations. It is, simply, Gort.\n\nBut this town of 1,200 in County Galway is also where my mother spent her childhood -- on the outskirts, on a farm -- and where family members still live. All my life, my answer to the inevitable ''Where are your people from?'' has been devoid of poetry but ringing with pride: Gort. Others may think of it as a blur of gray-stone storefronts on the road from Shannon Airport to glamorous Galway City, 22 miles to the north; I remember it as Ireland.\n\nA recent return confirmed my sense that no familial link is needed to appreciate what the town offers. Within a 10-mile radius you can find Coole Park, once Lady Gregory's sanctuary for the leaders of the Irish literary revival; Thoor Ballylee, the tower of inspiration for William Butler Yeats; Kilmacduagh, a sacred site with some of the finest monastic remnants in Ireland; Kinvara, an inviting fishing village; and the Burren, the dramatic limestone landscape sloping westward into the Atlantic.\n\nThen, of course, there are the people and places of Gort proper. True, the town is a little grimy, a little reluctant to exploit its history. The grounds of the Gort workhouse, once crammed to overflowing with the Great Famine's dying, are now used to store highway equipment. But those who pay attention will see life in the Irish west as it is, not as it might be imagined.\n\nMy wife, Mary, and I, with our 2-year-old daughter, Nora, visited for 10 days, staying most nights with relatives in a nearby farming hamlet with the singular name of Loughtyshaughnessy. But the area offers plenty of bed-and-breakfasts, the venerable Sullivan's Hotel and the Lady Gregory, a new hotel whose luxurious interior has won the grudging respect of the locals. We spent one night there and found the rooms comfortable and the staff accommodating.\n\nWe went first to Coole, less than three miles from town. A century ago, Lady Augusta Gregory, the regally beautiful folklorist and a founder of the Abbey Theatre, began to offer her estate as a haven to Yeats, Sean O'Casey, John Millington Synge and other Irish artists. Although Coole House was demolished in the early 1940's -- a shortsighted act that Irish preservationists bemoan to this day -- the government has worked to preserve the pastoral beauty of the setting and to recall the poetic brilliance that once fed off of its air.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
