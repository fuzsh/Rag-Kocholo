        "text": "Over the past century plus, many US and Canadian universities have provided mathematically talented Irish people with invaluable advanced training at the postgraduate level, as well as postdoctoral positions and employment. The importance of this for the enrichment of the Irish academic and scientific sectors, much of it taking place in a era when little or no such opportunities existed at home, hardly needs to be stressed.\n\nIn recent decades, many of these people returned to enrich the third level scene back in Ireland, but in the early days, quite a few prospered far from their origin and spent most or all of their careers overseas. One thinks of (1) Armagh's James McMahon, who in 1888 became the first known Irishman to supervise a mathematical PhD, at Cornell, where he later served as department chair, (2) Tyrone's Frank Murnaghan, who in 1916 got his doctorate at Johns Hopkins, where he then worked for thirty years, and (3) Dublin's John L. Synge, who spent a significant chunk of his working life from 1920 on at the University of Toronto.\n\nSome of the very best north American institutions have, between them, awarded hundreds of PhDs to Irish students. These universities include, in no particular order, Brown, Princeton, Chicago, Illinois, Yale, MIT, Harvard, NYU, UCLA, and Berkeley--the latter named after an 18th century Irish bishop with strong feelings about the foundations of calculus.\n\nThis month, we provide an overview of the Irish connection in the case of the California Institute of Technology, aka Caltech. This beautiful campus in Pasadena, California, not far from Los Angeles, dates back to 1891, and for its first three decades was named after its founder Amos Throop.\n\nBelow we focus largely on graduates of Irish universities who did their doctorates at Caltech. Most of them pursued academic careers, leading by example with doctoral students of their own, active research programmes, and numerous publications including books at various levels. Two of them became university presidents. Much helpful information has been provided by Vincent Hart, Donal Gallagher, James Gleeson, Padhraic Smyth, Maurice OReilly, and Ã‰anna Flanagan.\n\nCaltech has an exemplary website tracking masters and doctoral theses in all subjects, back to 1920 (there are even a few earlier bachelor's theses listed). There, if one knows where to look, one finds records of over two dozen Irish doctorates in the mathematical sciences. Big thanks also to Kathy Johnson of Caltech's Sherman Fairchild Library for having some of these theses scanned and added to their online database in recent weeks.\n\nThere was a period from the late 1950s onwards when many of those Irish scholars, having started out with maths science or engineering degrees from UCC, had been sent over by Paddy Quinlan there. Quinlan (shown here) was one of a number of early Irish postgraduates at Caltech in the second half of the 1940s. He was certainly the most influential Irish person to attend Caltech, supervising at least 10 doctorates at UCC in addition to steering an equal number of Cork-trained students (both in maths and various branches of engineering) to Pasadena.\n\nFrom the mid 1960s to the early 1980s, five Irish postgraduates at Caltech were supervised by material scientist Jim Knowles (1931-2009, shown here), whose own training was in maths at MIT. One of those students, Derry Connolly, remembers: \"At UCC, when I took classes from Quinlan - he had just two students, me and Liam Tuohey, long at DCU, we sat on either side of his office desk for class. He was in the Irish Senate at the time - so we enjoyed his many absences for senate affairs. When we were in CalTech - he would generally visit every year and take us graduate students for a fancy dinner at CalTech's faculty club - the Athenaeum - a big treat for starving grad students. Knowles was a great teacher and patient mentor - glad I had him - most might not have tolerated me.\"\n\nThere is now series of annual lectures and symposia at Caltech honouring Knowles. Moreover, his role in advancing opportunities for Irish postgraduate students did not go unnoticed: the National University of Ireland awarded him an honorary DSc in Dublin 1985.\n\nThe late Michael Hayes (1935-2017, shown here) of UCD's department of mathematical physics was another person with a strong connection with Knowles, and he started suggesting Caltech to students of his as a suitable place for postgraduate work. James Gleeson remembers, \"The reason I went to the US for a PhD was the gentle-but-persistent encouragement of the late Michael Hayes. Early in my final year in UCD he sat me down for a chat in his office, and gently suggested that applying to the US for a PhD might be a good idea. With his encouragement I applied to a few places, and I chose Caltech.\"\n\nJames was one of four Irish postgraduates from UCD who completed doctorates at Caltech in the 1990s with fluid mechanics expert Philip Saffman (1931-2008, shown here), who had trained at Cambridge. James recalls, \"Saffman was an internationally-renowned name in fluid mechanics, and I was soon determined to do my PhD with him: in fact, I was his last PhD student. He was quietly supportive of all his students: he even came along to the plays I acted in with the amateur theatre group!\"\n\nAnother of those students, Donal Gallagher, comments, \"The Caltech folks in Applied Maths were very happy with the quality of the Irish people they were getting so they kept on taking more. How we all ended up working for Philip was more inclination than anything else. He was a quiet gentleman genius. Prolific, encyclopaedic, kind and a supporter of many Irish students. He always had time to talk and gently guided his students. He told me once that he sat down to work out relativity from first principles without the assistance of any prior reading but it proved a bit more difficult than he had expected!\" Caltech now has a graduate fellowship named after Saffman.\n\nIn the table below, we follow our usual convention of showing the Irish maths person on the left, and the corresponding doctoral advisor (where possible) on the right. People are listed in order of the year of primary degrees. Also, please note that the year a PhD was awarded was sometimes the year after it was completed. (Caltech only awards degrees once a year, in June.)\n\nAfter the table, we comment on some other technical Irish PhDs obtained at Caltech."
