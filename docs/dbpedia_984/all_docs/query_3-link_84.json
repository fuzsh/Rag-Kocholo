        "text": "About\n\nWelcome to the second Rose Fitzgerald Kennedy Autumn School in Bruff, Co Limerick. The expanse from Ukraine to Ireland, no less than from Bruff to the White House, sets up our Friday night event. The School kicks off with an address from Her Excellency Larysa Gerasko, Ukrainian Ambassador to Ireland, followed by Reflections on a Universal Emigration Story, considering the Fitzgerald family legacy that the small town of Bruff has, and next, From Emigrant Remittances to Foreign Investment by Stephen Kinsella, highlighting the perennial link between migration and development.\n\nSet up by members of the community to memorialise the Fitzgerald Kennedy links that stem from 1850, the School sheds light on Irish emigrantsâ feeling for place that, just like the Fitzgeralds, they left centuries ago, for example the events planned will relate the story of President John F Kennedyâs momentous 1963 visit to Limerick â we hope to have a lively debate and consider the contrast between Ireland â then and now. Also a celebration of rural Irelandâher towns and the wonderful environment in which we live, we hope the School will engage and inspire you with the emigrant legacy around the world, a unique and innate culture.\n\nFRIDAY 27th October\n\n7.30pm: Formal Opening by Mayor Gerald Mitchell\n\nOpening Remarks: Declan Hehir, Director of Rose Fitzgerald Kennedy Autumn School\n\nFollowed by: Universal Emigration Story: Reflections\n\nHer Excellency Larysa Gerasko, Ukrainian Ambassador to Ireland\n\nFollowed by: From Emigrant Remittances to Foreign Investment\n\nProf Stephen Kinsella\n\nModerator: Tim OâConnor\n\nTHOMAS FITZGERALD CENTRE, BRUFF\n\n8pm: 3 One-Act Plays\n\nby Lough Gur Amateur Dramatic Society\n\nHONEYFITZ THEATRE, LOUGH GUR\n\nBOOKINGS: 087-489 1922\n\nSATURDAY 28th October\n\n1pm: The Story of President Kennedyâs visit to Limerick and Mayor Frances Condell, 1963\n\nDrs Matthew Potter and William OâNeill\n\nModerator: Kate Harrold, Lough Gur Manager\n\nLOUGH GUR VISITOR CENTRE\n\nSUNDAY 29th October\n\n11am: Fitzers Family Breakfast\n\nOLD IRISH WAYS MUSEUM, CAHERGUILLAMORE, V35 X236\n\n1pm: Diasporaâs Gravitational Pull of the Homeplace\n\nDr Pat Wallace - JFK: Giant At My Shoulder\n\nFrank Prendergast â Small Step for Lough Gur, Giant Leap for JFK\n\nModerator: Tim OâConnor\n\nLOUGH GUR VISITOR CENTRE\n\n3.30pm: Diaspora Dimensions: The Wild Geese, JFK and our musical heritage\n\nMaureen Browne â If the Fitzgeralds hadnât left Bruff in the 1850sâ¦\n\nDr Liam Chambers â The Wild Geese\n\nPeadar Ã Riada â Cultural Identity Here and Abroad\n\nModerator: Pat Hayes\n\nTHOMAS FITZGERALD CENTRE, BRUFF\n\n8pm: 3 One-Act Plays\n\nby Lough Gur Amateur Dramatic Society\n\nHONEYFITZ THEATRE, LOUGH GUR\n\nBOOKINGS: 087-489 1922\n\nCall the Hotline to reserve a seat 087 830 1574"
