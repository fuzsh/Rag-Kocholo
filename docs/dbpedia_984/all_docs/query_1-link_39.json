        "text": "I recommend My Ireland Tour as a company to book for a interesting and enjoyable tour of Ireland. I took the 14 Day Iconic Scenes of Ireland Tour. We covered the entire country (north and south) and saw many sights. The most impressive part of the tour was our tour guide and driver, Michael Coleman. He was very knowledgeable and imparted a sense of history throughout the tour. He always looked out for his passengers and helped us all along the way. I celebrated my birthday during the tour and Michael made it special by arranging a special birthday cake at the hotel on the day of my birthday. He also took us to a numbers of out-of-the-way sights not included in the prearranged tour. These made it extra special.\n\nMy husband and I have just returned from the 14-Day Iconic Scenes of Ireland tour . . . FABULOUS!!! From the Giant's Causeway to the Cliffs of Moher to the spectacular songs and dancing at the Merry Ploughboy Pub . . . we loved it all! Our driver/guide, Cathal Clarke, transported us back in time as we travelled around the emerald isle enlightening us all about Ireland's history, past and present. We have gained a new love and respect for Ireland! As well as the knowledge that driving in Ireland is not for the faint of heart! We were never so glad 'not' to be touring ourselves around. The accommodations along the way were excellent as were the breakfasts and suppers. And the local guides who took us around the different historical sites were much appreciated for their knowledge and humor! For a fun-filled, stress-free tour of Ireland, My Ireland Tour is tops!\n\nMy husband and I just took the 14 Day Iconic Scenes of Ireland tour. We had a great time! In summary: good group of people who got along with everyone, very nice itinerary which covered all the highlights of both Ireland and Northern Ireland, excellent local guides, and a very skilled driver/guide, Cathal Clarke, who took us safely around the whole island, amazing all of us with his driving skills on the narrow country roads and in the busy cities. Cathal was extremely knowledgeable and taught us the history of Ireland from prehistoric to modern times. He also shared some anecdotes from his personal life, which gave us an idea of everyday life in Ireland. He had a great sense of humour and made all of us laugh, but also made sure that every one of us was well taken care of. I would definitely recommend My Ireland Tour to anyone!\n\nThis was our second tour of Ireland but with a different company and this tour with My Ireland Tours was by far superior in so many ways. We took the 14 Day Iconic Scenes of Ireland tour . The itinerary was perfect, our driver/guide Colm Clarke was exceptional and made the group feel as ease from day 1. Every day was filled with a mixture of Ireland history from Colm which was so interesting to listen to, a bit of music on the coach, our daily joke and so many laughs as a group. Colm went out of his way to make every day of our tour a good day and we cannot thank him enough for this. I couldn't think of anything that i would have liked to be different, it was just perfect. I will definitely be recommending My Ireland Tours to others.\n\nWe were a party of three booked on the 14 day, June 8 -21, 2024 Iconic Scenes of Ireland tour. Our tour guide was Sean O'Sullivan and without his expert driving skills and extensive knowledge of Ireland, it would not have been as wonderful as it was. Sean picked us up at the airport at 9 a.m. on day one and brought us back to the airport on the final day at 5 a.m. and every day in between he was everything a professional tour guide should be! We loved the food at every hotel. Each dinner offered three courses with three choices on the starters and main. Some hotels offered choices for dessert but most offered a plate with three different desserts. Breakfasts were buffet style with the usual Irish fare: scrambled eggs, sausages, rasher bacon, blood pudding, scones, juice, etc. The hotels were well appointed, but be prepared for two differences between Irish hotels and North American hotels: all but two did not provide face cloths and every hotel opted for a covered duvet with no bedsheet between you and the cover. Which might not be a problem if the rooms were cool or cold but most were warm which meant that if you didn't want to sweat, you needed to remove the duvet from the cover and use the cover as a sheet. One of the best surprises about My Ireland Tours is the amount of space provided on the bus. There were 23 people on our tour which meant that each person had two seats to themselves; plenty of room for bags or backpacks and to stretch out on our long touring days. The only criticism I have which is shared by our group of three is that on the last few days of the tour, we were getting a bit weary; we would have appreciated lighter touring days where we could rest at the hotel or go to a local pub and relax. Perhaps drop the Guinness Storehouse or Jameson tours? We had already had the Bushmills Whiskey tour (which was wonderful), three tours of alcohol producers seemed a bit much (at least for us and we enjoy a wee nip!). The last excursion to The Merry Ploughboy was thoroughly enjoyed by all! If you're on the fence between My Ireland and another tour company, it's a no-brainer if you like lots of room on the bus. Five stars, well deserved!\n\nMy husband, John and I just came back from My Ireland's 14 Day Iconic Scotland & Ireland Tour. Our driver/tour guide, Pat Prendergast was absolutely incredible and was such a wealth of information! Pat went the extra mile for each one of us and really made our trip so worthwhile! A few suggestions for future 14 day Scotland & Ireland Trips that were echoed by fellow travelers on our coach bus: a) Having travelers wear ID name tags is a good idea and helps people get to know each other more quickly. Some people need a visual cue in order to remember someone's name, b) Time should be allotted in Belfast for a tour of the Titanic Museum. I know a lot of people on our bus showed interest and would have liked to have gone inside this historical museum-especially since we drove right by the museum. c) A two night stay should be based into the itinerary for guests to stay at Lough Eske Castle (even if this increases the price of the tour a bit). One night is simply just not enough- especially considering guests usually arriving at the castle don't get there until sometime in the afternoon, only to have dinner and then leave the next morning, All in all, we had a marvelous time, saw some amazing places & met some very nice people. Would we use My Ireland again for a future excursion- Most Definitely! Diane & John Giordano\n\nThis was lovely, I can recommend this tour company. My first bus tour, I was a bit apprehensive about sitting on a bus for long stretches, but that wasn't a problem at all. I was on the 14 days of Ireland tour. There were enough stops planned each day to stretch your legs or have a bathroom break. It was easy to hit your daily steps goal if you wished (but don't worry you won't miss anything if you don't/can't, the guided walks are at a very gentle pace). Our tour was early in the season, and as some places were flexible with our pre-booked time slots, our lovely tour guide Don O'Donoghue was able to arranged for us to do a couple of activities and photo ops that weren't in the initial itinerary (and you know you got assigned a great guide when the people at the various attraction, who all seem to know him/of him, only have good things to say. Same for our 3 local drivers). The group size was good, we got on very well very qickly, the bus was comfortable enough if a bit cold at times. The hotels were of a good standard and the food was tasty even though the desserts became rather repetitive. The farm lunch was a highlight. We were blessed with the weather and many laundrette sightings. Of course personal interests vary. I would have preferred to have a bit more time to walk around Derry and see Enniskillen castle (both cities were one night stops), and visit Belleek rather than the lacklustre Yeats grave.\n\nOh my goodness this trip was well done from start to finish! We chose the 14 day tour of Ireland. It's lovely, first of all, that this company does not jam pack the bus full of people, as with saw with other tours. Our group could stretch out and have breathing room on the bus. Second, their drivers are incredible! We had Phillip as our driver the first two days and he even came to get my daughter and I when our flight was delayed into the afternoon. He sang for the tour on the bus which was a delight and was knowledgeable about all he drove us to! Our driver the 3rd day of the trip onward was Don, and I cannot tell you how safe and cared for the whole tour felt with Don at the helm. He got to know each of us and our needs and he even put up with my need for lots of bathroom stops (giving us all a heads up when the next stop would be) because the one on the bus is only for emergencies. Don eventually sang for us as well, and he needs to give himself more credit, because he did well! His sense of humor and knowledge paired well with our friendly banter and curiosity as a tour group! The tour tended to focus on highlights and icons of Ireland, which is great for a first trip there. By the time we were scheduled for the 3rd distillery of the trip, we were kind of wanting to see something else, so my daughter and I decided to go to the Trinity Library tour and Book of Kells exhibit, and Don was understanding and checked in with us to assure we got back to the hotel safely. Can't thank Don enough for all he did on the tour and the effort he put into extra events we could choose to attend. I'd recommend this tour to anyone and I'd love to go back again through this company for another tour because I trust their staff and the way they do business!\n\nI have a mobility issue and can't walk long distances. So I emailed My Ireland company a video of my small travel scooter and asked if they could accommodate me. I received a resounding yes. So my travel companion and I booked the 14 day Iconic tour of Ireland for September 2023. Our tour guide, Harry Fisher, was so accommodating, and made every effort to make sure I saw most of the areas of interest, and if not suggested an alternative activity for me. Which sometimes worked out better as in the Bushmill tour, which has numerous stairs. I was offered a triple flight of whiskeys and a cosy seat to sip them - not a bad trade off ! Harry Fisher was witty, full of Irish legends and songs, and a fascinating historian who made Ireland more beautiful, tragic and resilient and kept us fascinated for two weeks. Our tour companions were an amazing group and many friendships were forged across Australia, America, Canada and the UK. I am so grateful for the opportunity to have seen Ireland and for the confidence I again to travel abroad again.\n\nI recently enjoyed the 14 day Iconic Scenes of Ireland tour. Brian, our guide/driver was informative and entertaining and I heard a lot of new Irish jokes. He took good care of us with his driving and organisational skills. The hotels were well located and of a high standard. The food was good too and I was relieved that I didn't put on weight after indulging in the 3 course dinners each night. The tour covered many of the highlights of the area and provided just the right amount of time at each attraction. I now know a lot more about the history of Ireland and Northern Ireland which was passionately shared by the local guides. I am very glad I chose My Ireland Tour.\n\nMy husband and i have just returned from a 14 day Iconic Tour of Ireland. The itinerary was extensive and varied, and we certainly saw some beautiful and interesting parts of Ireland. It was our first visit, but won't be our last. All the tour guides were great, very professional and knowledgeable , and we finished every tour much more informed about Irish history and culture. A special mention should be given to our exceptional driver/tour guide, Brian. He went above and beyond taking care of us throughout the tour, ensuring everything went smoothly, and thank him for giving us a wonderful holiday experience we will never forget . Ireland made us very welcome and we thank them for that . Ireland is beautiful and we would recommend this tour without hesitation.\n\nWe just returned from a 14 day Iconic tour of Ireland. We really enjoyed our first trip to Ireland and the itinerary was fantastic. We stayed on the go most of the time but we saw and hear so much history of the country. Brian our tour guide and coach driver was so funny! He was very knowledgeable of his country and has pride was exuberant. He was able to get us a few extra surprises along the way such as the Celtic Crystal demonstration of cutting glass. He answered most anything we asked and he could tell you where to go for things no matter where we were. The accommodations were clean and nice. I would recommend My Ireland tour company without any hesitation.\n\nWe just completed the 14 Day Iconic Scenes of Ireland tour. To begin, our guide, Michael Coleman was exceptional! He has an encyclopedic knowledge of Ireland; it's places, people and it's history. He was able to impart this information in an engaging and entertaining manner over the entire two weeks. What's to say about the scenery - beautiful! There were three of us touring in a bus with 19 other individuals from various parts of the world. While we may have preferred a smaller group with a wider age range (our son is 14), everyone in the group became good friends by trips end. Sadly, a couple of people on the bus had what was described as a cold. It turns out they likely had covid. A number of travelers on the bus came down with the 'cold' during the trip. My wife and son tested positive for covid when we returned home. Thankfully, none of those suffering from the 'cold' became serious ill. Having traveled as a party of three I would recommend others plan on booking at least two rooms. A number of the hotels seemed to have some difficulty accomodating three in one room. All that said, we throughly enjoyed our My Ireland tour and would consider using them again. Our guide, Michael Coleman was amazing!\n\nMy husband and I have wanted to visit Ireland for years, and newly both retired wanted to make our dream come true. I researched many tours of Ireland and was so impressed with the positive reviews. The tour exceeded all of our expectations!!! The itinerary was perfectly organized for our 14 day trip as we saw the highlights from both Northern Ireland and The Republic of Ireland. The guiding force to the success of the trip was tour guide Cathal ( Caw-hell). He was so personable, intelligent, funny and accommodating!! My goodness I felt like I was a student again as he was so knowledgeable about Irish history and made it interesting and understandable. This tour has been one of the highlights of our life. We both have Irish lineage and we felt so connected to the history and the people. The other important aspect to mention was that we had an amazing group of people that were fun, respectful and on time. Thank you for showing us the best of Ireland. I didn't even mind the rain Slainte, Amy and Kevin\n\nMy wife and I took your 14 day Iconic Scenes tour in mid-June could not be more pleased with the experience. From our first evening dinner to airport drop-off when leaving everything was set up to make things easy and enjoyable. All the hotels were very nice and meals were also good. We had never taken a trip like this before so had a little doubt about how it would go but we quickly saw how well everything was planned out. Not having to drive allowed me to actually look out the windows and the added height of the bus gave a much better view of everything than a car.(and probably saving several local drivers from dodging a rental car on the wrong side of the road!) Arriving at attractions and basically walking right in is something you can't do on your own as the tour arranges times and buys the tickets. At many of the locations there was a local guide which added to the experience. The coach itself was more comfortable than I thought it would be, both ride and noise. If I had anything to change (and this is a minor point to me) there was a time when meals got a little repetitive. I have to mention the people of Ireland as some of the nicest people I have ever run across. They were sometimes offering directions before we knew we were lost. (maybe I just have that look) Lastly, I would like to give our driver/guide John thanks for making everything so easy and fun. I appreciated his 'realness' and humor and additionally wanted to thank him for hanging back on some of the walks to make sure I was OK. For anyone looking to take this type of tour I would suggest you call here first and save yourself some time.\n\nThis review is for the 14 - day Iconic Scenes of Ireland tour which we took in June, 2023. We cannot add anything new to the already posted, glowing reviews of the company with which we agree wholeheartedly, including those with shout-outs to Shannon for consistently rapid responses to our pre-tour queries. Even given those reviews, the tour exceeded our expectations. The main purpose for this review is to have our Driver-Guide, Cathal, mentioned by name as being excellent in both the guide and driver capacities. My Ireland Tours states: “You can expect your tour guide to be... 100% Irish Passionate about Ireland Fully Qualified as an Irish Guide An experienced professional An expert on Irish history and culture Impeccably safe in all driving conditions Fully committed to your care' We can vouch that Cathal was passionate about Ireland, willingly and engagingly shared his vast knowledge about the country and kept us safe in all driving conditions. As far as we can tell, he met the other expectations too. Beyond these explicit qualifications, Cathal was personable, sharing personal perspectives and anecdotes which enriched our experience of the country. He answered questions readily and had a knack for keeping the mood of the group light. He responded to some slight teasing with good humour. Importantly, being a model guide, we never once had to ask where the toilet facilities were; at every single stop Cathal provided that information. Yes, that is important! Thank you, Cathal. Thank you My Ireland Tours for providing us with the experience that lived up to your reputation'\n\nWe took the '14 Day Iconic Scenes of Ireland Tour' starting 17 June 2023. It was a wonderful tour that delivered everything promised. The hotels were first-rate, the meal choices were good, and the sights were indeed iconic. In these current days of massive airline delays and flight cancellations, we booked flights to arrive a day in advance, and booked a room in the Dunboyne hotel for the night before first night of the tour. As it happened, our flight from Dallas was delayed from a 10 AM arrival to 6 PM in Dublin. The hotel was gorgeous, and we had a delicious dinner in the bar of the hotel. We slept in till noon the next morning, and then met some of our companions on the tour as they made it to the hotel. Except for tours around Belfast and Dublin, we traveled mostly through the countryside, on two lane, sometimes quite narrow roads. Coming from Arizona, USA, what struck us the most was how GREEN everything was: Ireland truly deserves the name of the 'Emerald Isle'. All the hillsides covered with small fields, divided by hedgerows in the north, and stone walls in the south, with every field having its complement of sheep, cattle, or sometimes both. And all the well-kept houses along the way, many with stone fronts and flowers blooming everywhere. Our driver/guide, Cathal Clarke, was a fount of information on Irish history, both Northern Ireland and the Irish Republic, as well as being personable and funny. He always made sure we were where we were supposed to be and knew how much time we had and when to be back to the bus.\n\nI participated in the 14 day Iconic Scenes of Ireland tour in June 2023. The tour was everything I had hoped for and more. The itinerary included castles, distilleries, places of interest, and an amazing view of the Irish countryside all around the beautiful Emerald Isle. The itinerary was well planned with much to see every day, as well as free time where it fit best. There was frequent comfort stops at places of interest, as well as the main attractions. Highlights included the Giant's Causeway and of course Blarney Castle. I do recommend arriving one or two days early, or staying one or two days after the tour to see Dublin properly. There was not a lot of free time in the itinerary for this, mostly because our first lodging was Dunboyne Castle Hotel, which is located outside the city. We did not see Dublin until the last day, and our free time then was limited. The best part of the trip by far was our guide/driver, Cathal. He was amazing in every respect. Not only was he a skilled and careful driver on the narrow Irish roads, he was very much attuned to our needs, interests and well being at all time. He has a great sense of humour and is a wealth of knowledge on the history and culture of every city, town and region in Ireland and was more than happy to share that knowledge at every turn. A guide/driver can make or break a holiday like this, and he most certainly made this a holiday to remember. I highly recommend My Ireland Tours in every respect.\n\nMy husband and I had an amazing time on our 14-day Iconic Tour of Ireland and Northern Ireland in May 2023. Our tour guide, Cathal Clark, was everything you could ask for in a guide. His extensive knowledge of history and the landscape and his great sense of humor made the time between destinations very enjoyable. We had hesitations about taking a trip with 22 other people but they were unwarranted. Our travel mates were interesting and extremely friendly so our journey was always full of laughter. Cathal should also be commended on his patience and kindness. It can't be easy to travel with a group of people of all ages and from different areas for two weeks. It was great not to have to worry about driving, our baggage, or tickets to sights. It was all so seamless. Also the hotels were very comfortable and the food was great. I'd definitely recommend this trip to anyone who wanted to learn about this beautiful island. Who knew there were so many colors of green! And so many sheep!\n\nWe had an incredible time on the 14-day iconic tour of Ireland and Northern Ireland. We have incorporated some of our tour guide's witty one-liners into our everyday conversations back in Canada. Cathal Clarke was so incredibly informative and knowledgeable regarding the rich history of Ireland and its people. His humour and willingness to always go the extra mile is a credit to this tour operator. We learned a lot and saw so many beautiful things. (With the exception of the Cliffs of Moher. Who knew fog could be that thick? We're still debating whether there are actually cliffs there). The food on this tour could get a bit repetitive for some at times but other than that, we would do it all again in a heartbeat. We highly, highly recommend this tour. Thank you so much for the wonderful memories. When someone asks us how it went, we start it off in Cathal's voice, 'Well...'\n\nI did the 14 day scenic tour and it was AMAZING! My Ireland Tour and our guide John did not disappoint. John was knowledgeable and fun. He went above and beyond what I could have expected, including adding a few stops along the way that were not included stops or keep us behind schedule. He always made sure that we were accounted for and made recommendations if places for food and shopping when we arrived at each location. Like said, John was top notch. Most of the food and hotels were great. More than what I expected. I did have a problem at the Clayton on the first stop there. I had no hat water and had to ask twice for it to be checked. Once John found out the issue it was addressed. Dinners were a three course meal and breakfast was buffet style. I found that the driver can make or break the tour and John definitely made ours. My Ireland Tour was the best way to go and I highly recommend them. In fact I'm looking at their Scotland tour for next year.\n\nWe travelled with My Ireland Tour on the '14-Day Iconic Scenes of Ireland Tour'. This tour company was great - the best I have traveled with thus far, as they were hands-on and very helpful in setting up the tour for us and answering all of our questions. This specific tour was really wonderful. Everything we did was well planned in advance. Each day was filled with wonderful experiences and great places for us to visit. We never had to get up too early, and we were never in a rush. We had two drivers/guides, Pat & John. Both were very professional bus drivers and yet also very personable, very funny guides. They were always focused on everyone in our tour group having a good time and a safe experience. [Note: The WIFI on the bus did not work.] The hotels were very, very nice and the food & service in the hotel and in their dining rooms was always good. [Note: Three of the hotels did not have air conditioning, but it was April, the windows opened and there was a portable fan.] We would definitely recommend this tour company and this tour!!!\n\nMy daughter and I travelled with My Ireland Tour on the 14 Day Iconic Tour and this trip was everything and more than we anticipated it to be. We had two drivers, Pat and John, very different in their approach, but both fabulous at sharing details of each area we visited. This was my first Bus Tour and I didn't image we would pack as much into each day. Ireland is a beautiful country and the people are amazing, so warm and welcoming. I never had a full understanding of the Country but every step of the way I received an education I didn't imagine. I will for sure refer everyone interested in touring Ireland to book through My Ireland Tour. Thank you to everyone involved.\n\nThis March my wife and I were on the 14 day tour and we loved the portion that we were able to complete. We started in Belfast, learned a great deal about area and 'the troubles'. Every site thereafter was spectacular and informative. Unfortunately my wife slipped, broke her ankle at one of the sites (Cliff of Moher), a breathtaking view of the sea and cliffs. This moment changed everything, our tour guide Tom Lavin immediately let the hotel know of the incident and proceeded to order a wheelchair for her. Tom made sure we were taken care of, had what we needed, and provided information on the hospital. We were told surgery was needed, so we booked trip back home. Tom had kept Managing Director Eric O'Gorman informed of the recent turn of events, and was decided to arrange a private car to take my wife to the airport. This was such a blessing and surprise. The driver stayed with us until we were safely handed over to the airport assistant . This tour company went above and beyond what we could of expected. When we return, we'll pick up, where we left off. Good Travels!\n\nThe entire experience dealing with My Ireland tours was handled professionally and of outstanding quality. The 14-day Iconic trip that we were on allowed us to see the different areas that make the island. As both of us like history the tours of the castles and other historical sites were fascinating. Another facet that My Ireland tours should be proud of is their drivers/tour guide. In our case it was Ben and his knowledge of the history or customs of the various times added to the trip. He did a great job of making sure all the guests were having their needs met. Our group consisted of 26 people, which we felt was close to the perfect size. Another part of the trip we really enjoyed was having the majority of the meals included into the package price (only negative was the dinner menu was basically the same the first four nights, different hotels). Speaking of the hotels, all were of high quality and in good locations to walk the towns if one desired. My Ireland tours would be the website I would check first in planning my next trip to the Emerald Isle, thank you again for a wonderful time.\n\nBefore I get into the tour itself we would like to express our gratitude for the customer support from My Ireland Tours. We were postponed in 2020 due to Covid and My Ireland offered us the opportunity to get our deposit back or keep it for 2021, which was also postponed till 2022 with all the same fees and no increases. Glad we chose to move it till 2022. That in itself meant so much to us and showed how important your company treats their customers. Customer support is top notch. All our emails dealing with Eric over the 3 years were great - thank you. The tour itself started off meeting our Tour Director Austin Mcardie. Austin was amazing. His knowledge of Ireland from county to county, his hospitality, and his driving expertise was what made the trip fantastic. We enjoyed everything about Ireland with the help of My Ireland Tours plus only having 26 incredible people on the bus was a bonus. My only concern was the last day of the tour. We went to Epic Museum , Christ Church Cathedral, and Guinness, then our final supper at night. This made for a very compressed day and hard to enjoy those 3 places due to a time crunch. All in all we would do this again and highly recommend it to anyone interested in Ireland .\n\nThis was our first coach tour holiday and so we were a bit unsure of what to expect. We needn't have worried as it turned out to be a fantastic holiday with wonderful memories. We visited so many beautiful places, many of which have already been mentioned in previous reviews. The guests travelling with us came from various countries, which made it very interesting and we all got on so well. Our driver/guide Brian T made the trip so very interesting and special, he became a good friend to all the group inside the two weeks that we were travelling together. We would like to thank him so much for making our holiday so memorable. He was very knowledgeable and friendly and caring. Brian even managed to smooth things over when one of our group set the fire alarms off by accident! The hotels were good as was the food. All in all it was a fantastic holiday and we would 100% recommend My Ireland Tours to anyone wishing to visit Ireland.\n\nOur family of four took the 14-day Iconic Scenes of Ireland tour and added a private 3-day extension tour to see the area where my grandmother grew up. The whole experience was wonderful, and made exceptional by the drivers/guides, Sean O'Sullivan for the group tour, and Geoffrey McConnell for the private extension. Both were very capable and knowledgeable and went out of the way to see that our needs were taken care of. The group tour covered a great deal of the country, with a variety of sights, scenes, and historical places. You cannot experience everything worth seeing of the Emerald Isle in 14 days, but this tour does a great job of hitting the highlights. Our driver and guide Sean shared his vast knowledge of the history and culture of Ireland and made the trip very enjoyable. Geoffrey, our driver and guide on the private tour, took initiative to try and locate cemeteries where my great grandfather may have been buried, as he understood the purpose of our private trip. We highly recommend My Ireland Tour!\n\nIn July 2022 we were lucky to explore Ireland with the My Ireland 14-day Iconic Scenes Tour. Great tour! Our guide and driver, Sean, was THE BEST! His historical and personal insights and stories made Ireland a special place. Sean always gave plenty of photo and rest stops along the way, even when we had a long bus day. Sean treated everyone with respect and patience and had a wonderful sense of humor. He watched out for everyone and drove that bus so well you would think it was a compact car! We felt safe with Sean at the helm. The bus was very comfortable and even had wi-fi. The hotels were comfortable with good service. Dinners could have had more variety – better yet - have some dinners out at local pubs/restaurants/homes. Eric and Shannon were so responsive, patiently providing email answers and help prior to the trip – above and beyond the call of duty!\n\nWe just returned from the 14-day Iconic Scenes of Ireland Tour (July 23 to August 5, 2022). We could not be happier. The hotels and meals provided by the company were all 4-star hotels and the food excellent. We got breakfast and dinner each night and two included lunches. The hotels were located in center of the cities allowing for exploring at the end of the day if you still had the energy after a full day of site seeing and exploring the local attractions. Our tour guide-driver Austin McArdle was outstanding. His knowledge of Irish history and sense of humor made the drives between locations short and educational. Clearly one of the best tour guides I have experienced. The group only consisted of 26 people on a bus that could hold nearly double allowing everyone to get to know each other. We made several new friends. If you are visiting Ireland for the first time, I would highly recommend this company. Their website offers numerous options. The company is a pleasure to deal with as well. This tour was initially booked in 2020 but due to Covid had to be postponed twice. On each occasion we were offered a choice to push our deposit forward or get a full refund. I am so happy I choose to push it forward. Eric O'Gorman from the company was a pleasure to work with.\n\nJuly 2022 14-day Iconic Scenes of Ireland My husband and I just returned home after experiencing the most fantastic tour of Ireland! Everything was great from the time we departed our plane at Dublin airport until we were dropped off at the airport for the return home. I must say that our driver/tour guide, Sean O'Sullivan, was the heart of the tour. His knowledge was extensive and he constantly went out of his way to insure our satisfaction, comfort and safety. He was always available to answer questions and to solve problems. Our hotel accommodations were first class but being Americans we were not aware that the majority of the Irish hotels did not have air conditioning. However, this did not affect our enjoyment of the tour. Meals were good but the menu was catered toward tour groups and every hotel had the same basic menu. Meals were also served at 7-730pm and did not conclude until 9-9:30 which made it difficult to explore the city after dinner. However, the two lunches provided with the tour were spectacular. Transportation to and from the itinerary sites and hotels was great. The motor coach was very comfortable and since we were a small group there was plenty of room to spread out. We picked this particular tour due to the small group size and the variety of activities included. We were not disappointed! I'm not sure when our next Ireland tour will be, but it will definitely be with My Ireland Tour!\n\nWe have just finally returned home as after our wonderful 14 Day Iconic tour of Ireland we continued on to Venice to join a Cruise. We waited for a couple of years to do our Irish Tour as everything was cancelled due to the Covid Pandemic and in the interim My Ireland Tours kept us up to date with all that was happening and rolled our tour over from year to year. Our Tour commenced in Dublin on the 3rd of June 2022. We were transferred from Airport to our first Hotel, Dunboyne Castle and what a wonderful place to start our tour in. There was 26 of us and we travelled on a Full Size Bus with plenty of spare seats and room to move for the entire trip. Sean O'Sullivan was our driver/guide and he did an amazing job of driving whilst giving us incredible information and commentary, Sean really made the trip and we saw and experienced Ireland. The bags outside room at 8am then go down to breakfast and we leave at 9 am worked extremally well. It was great not to have really early starts as happens with some companies. The included evening meals were great and tasty, however by the end of the trips the menu at each hotel did seem to contain similar items and it would have been nice to have a bit more variety. Timing of the meal was scheduled for 7:30 pm and most of the group prefered an earlier dining time, Sean was successful in rescheduling our evening meal to 6:30 at most (not all Hotels) which worked well. The included activites/excursions each day and free time in most places worked well. Overall a really great way to discover Ireland without having to drive yourself. Highly recommended.\n\nOur 14-day Iconic tour of Ireland was a wonderful way to see and understand this beautiful country. The breadth and depth of our tour made the 13 days on a bus, while tiring, very well worth it. The star of the trip was our fantastic driver/guide Sean O'Sullivan. His amazing driving skills kept us safe and his knowledge of all the history was incredible. At one point in the tour, he told us since we were ahead of schedule and had some time, he wanted us to see a restored round fort, which turned out to be the highlight of the day, if not the trip. If not for his initiative to visit this site, which was not even on the itinerary, we would never have seen and understood the significance of this incredible landmark. His attention to our needs and comfort was exceptional. Our only suggestion would be regarding the dinners. First, nearly all our tour was comprised of Americans, who were not used to eating dinner at 7:30, and it left little time for exploring the area after 9:00pm at night, when we were all full and tired. Sean was successful in changing the times to 6:30 in some instances, which helped. Also, the food was tasty and ample, but as the tour progressed the menus all looked the same as the last. We opted on 3 nights to seek more variety at a local restaurant instead of partake of the included meal at the hotel.\n\nMy husband and I just returned from our 14 day Iconic Scenes of Ireland tour. This was our first trip to Ireland and we had a wonderful time. Our tour guide/driver was John Boylan and he was excellent - not only did he skillfully maneuver the coach through narrow streets, he did it while telling stories and singing! He was quite entertaining. We got to see quite a bit of the natural beauty of Ireland and learned of the culture and history. All of our guides on our tours was friendly and knowledgeable. The hotels we stayed in were top notch, especially Dunboyne Castle hotel which was beautiful. The food was excellent, although it would have been nice to try some local restaurants in the areas. We highly recommend this tour - especially for first time visitors.\n\nMy daughter and I did the 14 day Iconic tour. It was our dream vacation and well worth it. In Northern Ireland our driver/guide had a local guide find the place where my wee nanny was born. We signed the peace wall. Every city every town was so beautiful and our guide/driver knew so much. He also keep us laughing. If an issue arises, My Ireland Tour team were right on it. The hotels we stayed at were perfect, the food was perfect (this coming from someone who is allergic to just about everything. My daughter has a dairy allergy and gluten intolerant and the hotels knew this before we even arrived) for the first time on vacation I didn't have to worry about food. Our driver even went off the beaten path so we could really get to see the locals and the land. He would always stop for a “Kodak' moment. Then the scheduled destinations like the Ring of Kerry, The distilleries (Bush Mills & Jameson) and so were outstanding. My Ireland Tour really knew how to put a package together to suit everyone one's interests. Well done!"
