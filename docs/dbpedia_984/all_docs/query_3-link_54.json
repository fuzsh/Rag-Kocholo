        "text": "Lindsay Lohan is back for Netflix’s hit rom-com Irish Wish, currently ranking on the U.S. movie charts on streamer at the No. 1. As you’re watching, you might be wondering where Irish Wish was filmed and if you can visit the breathtaking castles, cliffs, lakes and other locations in real life.\n\nIrish Wish follows a shy book editor named Maddie Kelly (Lohan) who falls in love with the writer she works for — the handsome and charismatic Paul Kennedy (Alexander Vlahos). When Kennedy gets engaged to her best friend, Maddie must put her feelings aside and travel to Ireland for their wedding. Days before they tie the knot, Maddie makes a magical wish for true love and finds herself in an alternative universe where she’s the one marrying Paul.\n\nLohan has starred in numerous rom-coms before, including Netflix’s Falling for Christmas in 2002 and 2006’s Just My Luck. The actress told Netflix that its emphasis on physical comedy attracted her to the role. “Maddie’s [one of the only] characters that I’ve played [who’s] a woman on her own making her way in the world,” she explained to Tudum. “We shaped her in a way that she was a bit more insecure in the beginning, and then she grows throughout the movie, and by the end, she really comes into her own.”\n\nThroughout Irish Wish, viewers are exposed to breathtaking spots in the Irish countryside, including the Cliffs of Moher and Lough Tay. Find out more about the filming locations and whether you can visit them in real life.\n\nWhere Was Irish Wish Filmed?\n\nIrish Wish was largely filmed in Wicklow, located on Ireland’s eastern coast. Lohan told Tudum that she was excited to film in Ireland and explore this side of her heritage. “Ireland’s so beautiful,” she said. “I’d never been, [but] my grandfather’s from there. We stayed in this little town called Dalkey. The people are so nice, and the Guinness pies were amazing.”\n\nAyesha Curry, who portrays Maddie’s loyal BFF Heather, told the streamer that Ireland has “the most epic views and vistas and history.” She continued, “There’s so much history there, and getting to explore that a little bit in between shoot days was really cool.”\n\nKillruddery House And Gardens\n\nKillruddery House in County Wicklow, Ireland, was used as the Kennedy family’s state. The 800-acre mansion dates back to the 1600s and has been lived in and owned by the Brabazons for three generations. The house is currently a working farm producing free-range meat, fruit, and vegetables for Killruddery’s own kitchen and Farm Shop. There are also garden and house tours during open season, according to its website.\n\nLough Tay\n\nIn Irish Wish, Lough Tay is where Lohan’s character makes her wish on the magical wishing chair. In real life, the scenic lake is set on private property in the Wicklow Mountains in Ireland. The lake is owned by the Guinness family, meaning it has limited public access.\n\nPowerscourt Estate\n\nIn addition to Killruddery House, Kennedy estate scenes were also filmed at Powerscourt Estate. According to the mansion’s website, Powerscourt started as a 13th-century castle over 800 years ago. Eventually, the 1st Viscount Powerscourt transformed it into its grand Palladian mansion style between 1730 and 1741. Unfortunately, you can’t go inside the mansion, but you can visit the gardens, gift shop, and café.\n\nThe Cliffs Of Moher\n\nThe Cliffs of Moher are a must-see experience for tourists visiting Ireland. Based on the West Coast of Ireland, the cliffs are where Maddie and James scope out possible locations for a wedding photoshoot. The scenic cliffs have also been featured in movies like Harry Potter, The Princess Bride, Leap Year, and more.\n\nWestport, County Mayo\n\nNetflix chose the charming seaside town of Westport for the village featured in Irish Wish. With stone bridges and a tree-lined promenade along the Carrowbeg River, the picturesque village is perfect for a rom-com. The wedding dress scene filmed earlier in the movie was located in Kelly’s Tweeds & Knitwear, while the town square was used for the second meeting between Maddie and James.\n\nIrish Wish is now streaming on Netflix.\n\nWatch the official trailer for Irish Wish below."
