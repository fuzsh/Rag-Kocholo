He was born January 8, 1931, in Webster Springs, West Virginia, to William Marston “Mart” and Rosalie Geneva “Bill” Frazee Gillespie. He was educated in the Webster County schools, graduated from Webster Springs High School in 1948, and attended the WVU School of Forestry where he received his bachelor’s degree. He then obtained a combined master’s degree in plant taxonomy and geology and ultimately became an adjunct professor at WVU in the Department of Geology and Geography, supervising many master’s and Ph.D. candidates. While teaching, Bill began compiling an extensive number of scientific articles, abstracts, books, and other materials.

That discovery made it the oldest plant seed ever found in the world and created an international sensation in academic circles.
