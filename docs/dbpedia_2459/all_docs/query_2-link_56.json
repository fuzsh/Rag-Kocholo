        "text": "Lavonne Eleanor Numsen Otto passed away June 25, 2024, at the age of 95 at Village Senior Living. She was the oldest of twins born on July 14, 1928, to Kenneth and Nathalie (Erickson) Numsen. She came into this world five minutes before her twin Lorraine. They were the first twins born in the Bowman County Hospital in Bowman, North Dakota.\n\nShe spent her first seven years on a farm south of Bowman before moving with her family to northern Idaho. Most of her schooling was in northern Idaho. She graduated from Missoula County High School in 1946. That same year, she married John Otto. They were blessed with three children: David, Peggy, and James (Jim).\n\nAs the children grew, Lavonne did volunteer work in the community as treasurer, vice president, and president of the Ladies Aide of Our Savior's Lutheran Church in Bonner, treasurer of the Bonner PTA, a club scout den mother, and a Camp Fire leader. She also taught Sunday School and Bible School. Lavonne also worked as an election judge before going to work and after retiring.\n\nIn 1963, she was asked to help for two weeks to set up Tempos, a new retail store that was opening in Missoula. She stayed 18 years working as an invoice clerk until the store closed in 1981, the same month her husband John passed away.\n\nLavonne worked at Mr. Steak for a few months before starting to work for Western Federal Savings and Loan. She worked ten years at Western Federal, retiring in 1993.\n\nVolunteer work started again when she was on the church council, helping with the church quilting, and prayer quilts, and again as an election judge until 2011.\n\nShe found time to work on her family history and walk every day. She was one of the original Piltzville Walkers.\n\nLavonne was preceded in death by her parents, husband John, twin sister Lorraine Escene, and brothers Duane and Bryce Numsen.\n\nShe is survived by her sons, David (Vicki) and James (Doris), daughter, Peggy Gillespie (Dan), eight grandchildren, fifteen great grandchildren, and three great great grandchildren.\n\nIn lieu of flowers, please make a donation to Missoula Senior Citizens or Our Savior Lutheran Church in Bonner."
