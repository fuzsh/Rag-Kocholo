        "text": "Forgive the culinary metaphor, but some books are snacks, some are satisfying dinners. Steve Cerra’s new book on Gerry Mulligan is a delightfully overwhelming banquet. When I first received a copy, I found it engrossing but I also thought, “I might need a few weeks to do this book justice.” So this admiring review comes with the caveat that I, the admiring reviewer, have read here and there in the book. But I think it is such a valuable compilation that it should get heralded right now.\n\nTo me, Mulligan is in the odd position of being simultaneously celebrated and viewed at a curious distance. He had a nearly fifty-year career as a jazz luminary, a deep influence as a singular player of a sometimes-underestimated instrument, the baritone saxophone. For some, he would have been slightly behind Ellington’s majestic Harry Carney; for others, he would have outstripped Carney as an innovator and creative thinker. Mulligan appeared to “move with the times,” but in reality he stubbornly chose to be himself, no matter what the context: his piano-less quartet, his Concert Jazz Band, the “Birth of the Cool” group; his later recordings that each seem to be jubilant explorations of new landscapes.\n\nTo understand him, one has only to make a quick mental list of the people he played with and chose to work with: Bill Crow, Miles Davis, Brew Moore, Charlie Parker, Bob Brookmeyer, Chet Baker, Dave Brubeck, Jimmie Rowles, Dizzy Gillespie, Duke Ellington, Jack Teagarden, Tony Fruscella, Bill Charlap, Zoot Sims, Johnny Hodges, Teddy Wilson, Thelonious Monk, Art Farmer, Ben Webster, Phil Woods, Elliot Lawrence, Joe Sullivan, Gene Krupa, Annie Ross, Billie Holiday, Clark Terry, Stan Getz, Paul Desmond, Lee Konitz, Chubby Jackson, Charles Mingus, Mel Torme, Shorty Rogers, Zoot Sims, Lionel Hampton, Cleo Laine . . . and that is not including his arrangements for Lawrence, Krupa, Claude Thornhill, Stan Kenton, and his own groups. He has been categorized as part of the “cool jazz” or “West Coast jazz” school, but those schools are merely names journalists give to groups of musicians when they need a quick and often inaccurate classifier.\n\nCerra’s book is not the only one on Mulligan: Sanford Josephson’s biography, JERU’S JOURNEY: THE LIFE AND MUSIC OF GERRY NULLIGAN, appeared in 2015, and two oral histories appeared earlier. But Cerra’s book, an appealing collection, does not duplicate the previous works. It is a Reader, or a collection of articles, interviews, and liner notes to recordings. As such, it is not only a shifting multi-layered portrait of Mulligan, person and artist, it is also a cross-section of journalistic and essayistic jazz history. Consider, if you will, a book of reviews of Ulysses: a reader would learn not only about the subject, Joyce’s work, but how it was regarded, decade after decade. Thus, Cerra’s large-format book (with illustrations) is fifty-plus perspectives on the artist, his groups, his colleagues, his reputation as the times shift. Cerra himself doesn’t demand center stage, but his writing is clear and unfussy, a pleasure.\n\nLet us assume, even if it’s heresy, that the imagined reader isn’t terribly fascinated by Jeru in all his many selves. The book is still an arresting collection of stories (I was reading it last night, or this morning, at 2 AM). I didn’t know that George Duvivier had been invited by Duke to join the band at the same time Duke found Jimmie Blanton, and why Duvivier said no; I hadn’t known how Al Cohn had lost one eye; his tumultuous relaionship with Chet Baker, his working relationships with Miles Davis, Gil Evans, and much more. For those who thrive on darkness, there’s heroin, cancer, imprisonment, broken hearts as well.\n\nI won’t describe the book more, because I don’t want to take away the serendipitous joys of finding a new story, a new insight, musicians seen from multiple perspectives. At first, I was disconcerted that the book lacked an index (possibly a financial decision) but rambling through its pages, I have welcomed the opportunity to find surprises without arrows pointing to them.\n\nOne of the most charming aspects of Mulligan is that he understood, and loved, the whole history of the music. Had there been a jazz festival with Leon Roppolo and Ornette Coleman on sequential stages, Gerry would have sat in with both of them and made everyone feel at home with his presence. And, in turn, he was loved and respected by Coleman Hawkins and Rex Stewart, among other “elders.” This leads me to the filmed evidence (December 1957) of the magic moment when I first saw and heard him live. You’ll recognize the sublimely glittering crew, and please marvel once again at how Jeru not only gets comfortable but lifts the music:\n\nAfter Jimmy Rushing walks to one side, there’s the Basie rhythm section (without Walter Page, who was ill): Basie, piano; Eddie Jones, double bass; Freddie Green, guitar; Jo Jones, drums. Then Ben Webster, tenor saxophone; Bennie Morton, trombone; Joe Wilder, trumpet — then Gerry, soaring, lyrical and down-to-earth; Vic Dickenson, trombone; Roy Eldridge, trumpet; Emmett Berry, trumpet; Coleman Hawkins, tenor saxophone; Dickie Wells, trombone; Joe Newman, trumpet; Basie and the ensemble, cheered on by Billie Holiday.\n\nOf course there are thousands of hours of Gerry on record and film to savor. But this book will add to the enjoyment, and I salute its diligent author-editor. It’s available as a large-format paperback or e-book here, and Cerra says in his acknowledgments that after publishing costs have been met, half the proceeds will go to the Gerry Mulligan Foundation “to support school music programs and acquiring instruments for students,” commendable indeed.\n\nMake room on your shelves."
