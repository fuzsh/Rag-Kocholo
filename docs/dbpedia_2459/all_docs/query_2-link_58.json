        "text": "On Sunday, March 10, 2024, Ronald (Ron) Gallego, loving brother, uncle, and friend passed away just shy of 61 years of age in Santa Ana, California. Ron is survived by his brothers Ric and Randy, niece Jaszmine, great nieces, cousins, friends, and dog Chloe. Ron was born on April 10, 1963 in Inglewood, California to Robert and Bea Gallego. He grew up in West Covina, CA and graduated from Nogales High School in 1981. Since childhood, Ron’s passions were health and fitness, body building, martial arts, and the beach where he loved spending time. Ron’s career spanned a variety of professions from fitness instructor, to male review dancer and model to restaurant server, hairdresser, cosmetology industry sales rep, and entrepreneur. The common thread among all Ron’s pursuits was his ability to relate to people from all walks of life. Although known to family and friends as a fun-living, Ladies’ Man who could be ridiculously competitive, he was also a man of faith who liked to share his love of God and Christianity with anyone who would listen. Family was also important to Ron who embraced a Papa-like role with his niece and grandnieces as well his mother in her final years as her primary care giver. He had a sentimental heart and often reminisced about childhood family gatherings and holiday celebrations. The beaches of Southern California were Ron’s happy place where he loved to relax and felt close to God. His spirit lives on in the majestic waves, tranquil ocean, and loving hearts and minds of those who knew him. May he rest in peace with God as he reunites with his parents, eldest brother, and loved ones in eternity where the stars meet the sea.\n\nKenneth O’Brien “Kobby” GILLESPIE, died peacefully December 12,2023 Stanton, CA. Aged 61 years young. Born January 25, 1961 in Orange County to loving parents Norman Worley & Patricia Sue (dec’d). He is the loved brother of Christina Mae (nee Gillespie) & brother-in-law Xavier Hermosillo. Loved Uncle & Great Uncle. Kobby never married, coming close three times, and though not having his own children he loved all children. He was also very sentimental. Kobby in his Jr. year at Magnolia High School, Orange paid him to teach woodwork to adults, then his Sr. year saw him a table tennis champion. After graduating he started a mini truck club with his 4×4 Toyota pickup. One of his many achievements was his truck featured on the front cover of Trucking Magazine. His closest friends, Farrah & Leb Alameddin & Cindy McKinnon loved him like a brother, knowing the very comical side to this young man. A manmade master of all jobs, a perfectionist is a small understatement of Kobby. He will be truly missed by his family, many many friends & those that had the pleasure to know & love him, he will never be lost as he is buried in our hearts.\n\nItsuye (Tsubochi) Hirst went by the name, “Peggy,” because she and her siblings, as Nisei (2nd generation) children, served as a bridge between their non-English speaking Issei (1st generation) parents and the American social order of the early 20th century. Peggy lived a full, eventful, and long 101-years. Peggy passed peacefully and comfortably on 14th February 2023 at her home in Seal Beach, California. She was born on 31st August 1921 from humble beginnings in San Pedro, California as the first-born child to her mother, Ito (Kitagaki) Tsubochi, and father, Chozo Tsubochi. She was blessed with four siblings Tsuneo “James” Tsubochi, Mihoye “Betty” (Tsubochi) Higgins, Tayeko “Tye” (Tsubochi) Ray, and Yoshino “Alyce” (Tsubochi) Toyama. Peggy and her siblings grew up on the Palos Verdes Peninsula of Southern California, where their close-knit family was one of forty families who were sharecropper-farmers and grew crops on 2,000 acres of fertile land. During their childhoods they worked hard on the farm and enjoyed family time at the nearby scenic beaches for fishing, abalone-diving, octopus hunting, periwinkle foraging, and picnics. Peggy outlived her two husbands, Yasutoshi “Yas” Okuji, the father of her sons and whom she wed in November 1941, and Louis “Lou” Hirst, wedded in February 1972. As well, she was predeceased by her above-named four siblings; an infant son “Baby Okuji;” brother-in-law Tadashi Okuji; sister-in-law Tomoe Okuji; and step-son Robert Hirst. She is survived by sons Dennis Okuji, Michael Okuji, David Okuji; daughters-in-law Lilit Mazmanyan, Cindy (Sakata) Okuji; step-daughters Janet (Hirst) Henderson, Kathy (Hirst) Roberts; step-daughter-in law Linda Hirst; grand-daughter Kelli (Okuji) Wilson; grand-son-in-law Landis Wilson; great-grand-daughter Olivia Wilson; and numerous Tsubochi nieces and nephews. Peggy graduated from San Pedro High School, after which she soon married Yas to start their young lives together in Los Angeles, California. Peggy always had a ready smile and carried an underlying toughness, which prepared her for life’s uncertainties. “Strength through Smiles” can best describe Peggy’s steely grit and resilience for the hardships she endured in her 101-years. In 1942, during World War II, Peggy, Yas, and their parents and siblings were forcibly moved from Los Angeles and interned in Heart Mountain, Wyoming for two years under Presidential Order No. 9066. During these difficult years Peggy started her family with the births of two sons and a third who did not survive childbirth. Family photos show Peggy smiling from the joy of her new sons, while enduring the monotony of confinement. Upon release from Wyoming, Peggy and her family returned to Southern California and rooted in Long Beach, California where she bore and raised two more sons. Tragedy struck again in 1965 when Peggy unexpectedly lost both her husband, Yas, and her second son, Victor, within seven months of each other. Surmounting grief in mid-life, Peggy was thrust into the role as a single, working mother as a grocery clerk for Atlantic Farms and Cole’s markets in the Long Beach area. Although tired after a full day of work, Peggy always returned home with her smile. A few years later, Peggy joined a bowling team, with Lou Hirst as one of her team-mates. One thing led to another and soon they became married life-mates. Approaching retirement age, Peggy and Lou purchased property in Oregon where they could establish a life of travel as snowbirds. In 1972 they fulfilled their plan, moved to Beavercreek, Oregon, and also established a winter residence in Vincete Guerrero, Baja California, Mexico. Thanks to the early days of satellite TV technology, Peggy was able to regularly watch her beloved Portland Trail Blazers. During these care-free years Peggy and Lou enjoyed plenty of travel adventures in their recreational vehicle with sightseeing, fishing, and communing with friends and family. However, this period of bliss was disrupted when a gas-leak in their recreational vehicle ignited and exploded causing Peggy and Lou to suffer serious burns. They were air-lifted from Mexico to a burn center in Los Angeles, where Peggy underwent three months of care, rehabilitation, and full recovery. Despite the seriousness of her experience, Peggy never shared the pain and suffering she endured. Instead, she remained steadfast with her gracious smile. In 2000, and again unexpectedly, Peggy lost her beloved husband, Lou; after which she moved back to Southern California to be closer to her family. Upon her return, Peggy kept busy with watching NBA basketball, joining a competitive table tennis team, and junkets to the local tribal casinos. Peggy will always be remembered for her fastidious memory (she remembered everyone’s birth, graduation, and anniversary dates) and her love of nature’s beauty (the colors of flowers, foliage, and sunsets), the Portland Trail Blazers, singing, dancing, cooking, cake-baking, knitting and crocheting, Hershey Kisses and butterscotch candies, and ICE CREAM (although she did not partake in any other dairy products). Of course, Peggy will be remembered for her “strength through smiles.” In her final years as the sole remaining sister, Peggy would often ask, “Why am I still here?” On 13th November 2022 her question was finally answered when she was presented with her one and only 3-month old great-grand-daughter, Oliva, who shares Peggy’s August birth week and more importantly shares her joyful smile. Through Oliva, Peggy’s “strength through smiles” will continue onward. Peggy’s celebration of life remembrance will be held privately with family members at sea in Los Alamitos Bay on Saturday, 25th March 2023. To honor Peggy’s love of nature’s beauty, donations may be made to the Nature Conservancy.\n\nDennis Okuji, a consummate visual artist, died on March 2, 2023 at his long-time home in Long Beach, CA after a short illness. He was 80. Dennis worked as a research analyst at the Long Beach Public Library for 25-years. He preferred the public library over a university research library because the quiet surroundings gave him the independence and solitude to delve into his passion for painting, drawing and wood-block printing. He seemed to change mediums every five-years. Prior to his library stint, Dennis used his design talent in the fast paced world of commercial art at Hallmark Cards in Kansas City, MO and the Los Angeles Times (newspaper) art department. Upon retirement, he soon expanded his interests to photography, calligraphy, coin and firearm collecting. He could often be found driving fast down Pacific Coast Highway with the windows down in his candy-apple red Pontiac Firebird. Dennis was an enthusiastic traveler who brought whimsy to his trips to Las Vegas, Santa Cruz and San Francisco to visit family. He was so thrilled to visit Napa Valley for his niece Kelli’s wedding at Meadowood that he bought a swanky new suit, shirt, tie, shoes and a pocket square for a bit of panache . . . a special flair for such a frugal kind of guy. Dennis Masao Okuji was born January 21, 1943 in the Heart Mountain, Wyoming relocation camp during World War II to Itsuye (Tsubochi) and Yasutoshi Okuji. He showed so much artistic talent at Long Beach Polytechnic High School that his teachers arranged for him to receive a scholarship to the Parsons School of Design in New York City. In an early show of his independent bent, Dennis eschewed the scholarship and remained close to home to earn his Bachelor of Fine Arts (BFA) degree from Long Beach State College (now California State University, Long Beach). He later earned his Master of Library Science (MLS) degree from the University of Southern California. Dennis served in the Army as an infantryman deployed to Viet Nam where he saw combat action and volunteered to jump out of airplanes as a paratrooper. He regularly traded stories on Army life with his uncles Raymond Toyama and Tadashi Okuji. On his return flight from Tokyo, he remembered being bumped-up to a first-class seat where he shared a row, wine and stories with the film actor E.G. Marshall. In retirement, Dennis continued to live a fiercely independent life where he even drove himself to the hospital for surgery. He lived his entire life on his own terms, created beautiful art, was content in solitude and passed peacefully. A life well lived. Dennis is survived by his younger brothers Michael and David, sisters-in-law Lilit Mazmanyan and Cindy (Sakata) Okuji, niece Kelli (Okuji) Wilson, grand-niece Olivia Wilson, and many Tsubochi cousins. Private services will be held at sea in Los Alamitos on March 25, 2023. Memorial donations in Dennis’ honor may be made to the Room to Read literacy program for underserved children.\n\nNovember 29, 1953 – January 1, 2023 Christine Anne Haapala Oosdyke entered into eternal life on Sunday, January 1, 2023.

In 1983, Chris joined Support Systems International (Hillrom) as a sales rep and moved to Chicago, where Bob had accepted a job with Herman Miller. Chris and Bob married in 1985 and eventually made their home in Southern California. Chris rose to stellar heights in her sales director career, yet she remained humble and graciously mentored others along the way. Chris was a dedicated and loving wife, mother, sister, and daughter. She truly enjoyed family time together, whether it be vacationing in Hawaii, skiing in Colorado, or watching Lauren and Brett play basketball. She often traveled to Michigan to spend time with her large extended family. And she was a loyal friend to many. Chris loved working out and organizing anything and everything.

Tasks left undone must stay that way I’ve now found peace at the end of day. If my parting has left a void, Then fill it with remembered joys. A friendship shared, a laugh, a kiss Oh yes, these things, I too will miss. Be not burdened with times of sorrow Look for the sunshine of tomorrow.

He passed away on August 6, 2021, at the age of 86 in Orange, California, surrounded by loved ones. Bill is survived by his wife of 58 years, Janet Cecilia Papen Milo, and their children: Sandy Milo of Anaheim, California; Rebecca Hansen (Allen) of Castle Rock, Washington; Rich Milo (Davida) of Huntington Beach, California; and Kathryn Gibson (Tom) of Huntington Beach, California. He is also survived by seven grandchildren and eight great grandchildren. He was predeceased by his parents, George and Katherine (Ramsey) Milo of Montpelier, Vermont, and his brothers, George Milo and Tom Milo. Bill also has many brothers-in-law, sisters-in-law, nieces, and nephews with whom he enjoyed spending time. Bill loved to spend time with his large extended family. Education was very important to Bill. After graduating high school, he enlisted in the U.S. army with the goal of attending college through the GI Bill. Upon his return from serving 18 months in the Korean War, Bill was discharged and achieved his goal by earning a Bachelor of Science degree in Electrical Engineering from the University of Vermont. The taste of warmer climates he was given in the army drew him to look towards the Southwest for a job, culminating in a move to Southern California where he’d soon get married and start a family. Bill demonstrated the love and respect he had for education to his children by earning an MBA from Pepperdine University while they were young, still working full time along the way, later leading to motivate each of his children’s own college degrees. Bill worked in aerospace his entire career. The job he’d take in Southern California was as an electrical engineer for North American Aviation, later Rockwell International and now a part of Boeing. Just some of his accomplishments include several patents and programs on exhibit in the Smithsonian, research hanging from the ceiling of the National Air and Space Museum on the X-15 aircraft, and building the first digital fingerprint machine for the FBI. Bill married Janet Papen at St. Boniface in Anaheim, California, on August 24, 1963. Jan and Bill enjoyed going out dancing together, which they continued to do well into their 70s. They had four children and lived in the same house in Anaheim for over 50 years. Bill and Jan enjoyed their home and neighborhood and attended church weekly at St Justin Martyr and St Boniface. They spent many summers with their family traveling and exploring the country, usually by camping and visiting national parks in trailers and RVs, enjoying campfires, hiking, site seeing, fishing, and exploring. In retirement, Bill and Jan completed their world travels via plane trips and cruises covering all 7 continents. Bill was a positive staple of his community through his hobbies, volunteer work, and playful personality. He loved dogs and had them as pets as a child, when his kids were young, as well as later playing with his kids’ dogs — his “granddogs”. He enjoyed joking and being silly to entertain his and other children, including making them laugh at Mass, earning him the nickname “Grandpa Silly Billy”. His corner lot house was nearly a suburban farm when his kids were young between the rabbits, pheasant, and quail being raised in the backyard, beer brewing in the bathroom, and a thriving garden including an abundance of fruit trees. He helped lead an “Indians Guides” YMCA troop, including taking charge of “crafts” (weapons). At 40 years old he started running marathons (later triathlons), a running club at work, and running 5 and 10ks with his kids as well as bicycling events with his coworkers and son. He coached AYSO soccer and little league baseball for many years, beginning with local youth sports when he was single, then his own kids’ teams when they were young, and finally his grandson’s first soccer team. Along with his wife, Bill was very generous with his time and talent. When their family was young, they opened their home to a foster child for a year. Bill volunteered with charitable organizations such as St Vincent de Paul Society, Second Harvest Food Bank, and Halcyon Interfaith Shelter. He helped many of his family members, friends, neighbors, charities, and later his own kids over the years with home repair and construction. He was experienced in woodworking and construction, including electrical and plumbing. He maintained and fixed his own cars (even when his children caused the damage) and household appliances. After retiring in his late fifties, Bill spent much of his time visiting extended family, volunteering, camping, fishing, golfing, and teasing his grandchildren. His love of education stuck with him through extensive reading and travel, providing knowledge of many topics, and Bill even worked to learn Spanish. He was a frequent golfer at his local course, Dad Miller in Anaheim, and became so well known by the employees and other regulars that he’d often spend more time talking than golfing. Bill enjoyed fishing with his kids and grandkids, or even by himself up in the Sierras. He participated in an annual “opening day” trout fishing trip with his son for many years, and multiple times won the “biggest trout” contest. It wasn’t enough to just fish and golf for Bill, he actually assembled his own custom rods and clubs — some of which are enjoyed now by his kids. Funeral Mass will be offered at St Boniface Catholic Church in Anaheim, California, on Friday, September 3, 2021, at 10 am. Friends and Family are welcome. Bill was a man of science as well as a man of faith. Therefore, for the safety of all and to honor Bill, vaccination (except for those 12 and under), social distancing, and mask use (covering mouth and nose) will be required."
