The message on Saturday stated that he was reported missing as of August 5th, less than a month after he had visited here.\n\nSt. Sgt. Ahrens, age 21 is the son of Mr. and Mrs. Albert Ahrens of Cave Creek Community. He was married to Miss Viola Sagebiel of the Crabapple Community, May 31st, this year near his Army Air Base at Rapid City, S. D.\n\nThe young man attended the Rheingold School and up until the time he enlisted in the U.S. Army Air Forces in August, 1942, he assisted his father on their farm in the Cave Creek community. He received his training in Panama City Florida; Chicago Ill.; Salt Lake City Utah; Blythe California; and Grand Island, Nebraska army air bases. The last letter received from him was dated July 30th.\n\nThe War Department believed that he perished along with other crew members in the crash of a plane into the ocean near the coast of England. The fatal accident is determined by eye-witness accounts as related by members of an English Patrol Launch who saw a plane crash into the sea within a few miles of the English coast, the plane evidently having been the one on which Staff Sgt. Ahrens is reported to have been an occupant and which was on its way from America to England.
