She was predeceased by her husband, Raymond, and brother, Russ. Left to cherish her memory are her children, Craig (Wendy) and Laura (Ken); sister, June Stewart; sister-in-law, Linda Martens; grandchildren, Brianna, Joshua, Patrick, Owen and Sophia; great-grandson, Darius; nieces and nephews, Steven, Dan (Tabitha), Jordan (Tania) and Lindsay (Ralph, Lola, and Greta); special aunt, Nettie; numerous cousins; as well as her special friends and neighbours. Virginia was born and raised in St. Vital, and enjoyed a long career at Great West Life where she made many lifelong friends. She was a loving mother who enjoyed gardening, golf, and spending time with her friends and family. The family would like to extend their gratitude to the staff at CancerCare Manitoba, and the numerous doctors and nurses at the Women's Hospital, for the care and compassion extended to Virginia during the past months. In lieu of flowers, donations can be made to CancerCare Manitoba, or the Humane Society (a charity that Virginia held dear to her heart). In accordance with Virginia's wishes, cremation and a private family service will take place at Chapel Lawn Memorial Gardens.
