My family and I are residents of Albany, Missouri in Gentry County. I grew up in the days when hard work and good work ethics were not only important, but essential to survival. Like many of you, I worked my way through college with jobs ranging from lab work with the Missouri Water Company, to building combines with Allis -Chalmers. I feel the need to stop the Federal Government from taking away our citizens rights and to restore the importance of our Constitution, and Bill of Rights, established by our founding fathers.\n\t\n\tMy education includes a Bachelor of Science in Business Administration, and Master of Science in Industrial Management; budget forecasting; finance specialist; Missouri State Energy Auditor; Business and Facilities Consultant; Director of Physical Facilities, The Metropolitan Community Colleges; CQI (continuous quality improvement).",
