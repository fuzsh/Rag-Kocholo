Rogers, son of Millard and Eva (Myers) Rogers, was born September 14, 1895, in Oskaloosa.\n\nReprinted from the July 15, 1930 edition of the Oskaloosa Herald.\n\nUNCLE SAM WILL HONOR A.S. ROGERS\n\nSinglehanded defends Bridge Against German Attack, 341 Prisoners.\n\nTwelve long years have passed, but Uncle Sam has not forgotten how Arthur S. Rogers, 1111 First Avenue West, Oskaloosa, then a Private in Company C of the 5th United States Infantry, 2nd Division, singlehanded repulsed an attack of German forces while his regiment flanked the Heinies, captured 341 prisoners, and opened a pontoon bridge across the Marne for an American advance.\n\nArthur Rogers is to receive a medal of honor at Des Moines at 10:30 a.m., August 1, for his exploit, according to an announcement by the war department Monday. The citation reads: “That on July 7, 1918, at the battle of the Marne, with courage you stayed by your machine gun after the crew had all been killed, you held back a company of Germans with a withering fire so the 5th Infantry could advance on their objective, and by your valor, and courage the 5th Infantry gained their objective and captured 341 prisoners.”\n\nRogers was the sole survivor of a machine gun crew of seven on the American side of the bridge. He maintained a sweeping fire from an old Lewis gun, driving back each rush of the Germans and holding the bridge against overwhelming odds at a crucial moment in the first major American engagement. Lying prone on the ground, Rogers swept the opposite bank with telling effect, feeding the gun with his feet as he played a deadly fire on the attackers.\n\nCorporal Prow and Private Estes, Lorey, Logsdon, Brosowski, and Larson of the machine gun squad lay dead around him, victims of the German fire. Behind him were the bleeding and dead of the 5th Infantry, caught by the murderous spray of German bullets. “Keep up the fire,” signaled his company commander as officers sought to reform the shattered regiment and launched a flank attack. So effective was Rogers’ gallant stand that the remnants of his outfit not only cleared the bridge but took 341 prisoners.\n\nThe bridge had been hastily built at 3 a.m., once destroyed by a German attack, rebuilt by the American engineers, and was again the object of a stubborn German offensive. Then came the American counterattack with its disastrous results. Company C lost heavily and finally retired behind the old chateau, leaving the machine gunners, the lone protectors of the bridge. Sharpshooters and German machine gunners mowed down the American crew with deadly accuracy. Only Rogers remained as the sole defender. His valor is a matter of official war records. The days of fighting that followed were bitter ones for Rogers. A bit of shrapnel tore an ugly wound in his forehead, and scarcely recovered, a German rifle butt in the hands of a Heinie hidden in the undergrowth was rammed into his head.\n\nArthur returned to Oskaloosa but never fully recovered from the injuries he received at the hand of the German Soldier. At that time, wounded soldiers returned to their communities and were at the mercy of those who would care for them.\n\nArthur’s valor and sacrifice made the winning WWI possible. Unfortunately it took another World War to defeat facism. Our freedom is always dependent on individual sacrifices.\n\nContact Shawn Langkamp at Langkamp Funeral Chapel & Crematory at 641-672-2181 or www.langkampfuneralchapel.com on the Contact-Us-Link if interested in honoring a deceased veteran with the flag above the bandstand.\n\nFebruary 2023\n\nDale “Jim” W.
