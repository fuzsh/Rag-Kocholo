        "text": "It was the second of three consecutive trips for the Pat Casey led club to the College World Series. The Beavers were the first team to face elimination six times after a CWS opening game loss and capture the national championship – a three-game series victory over North Carolina.\n\nFor the opportunity to play UNC, the Beavers defeated Georgia, Miami (Fla.) in a rematch of the tournament opener and vaunted No. 2 seed Rice twice. Dallas Buck, Jacoby Ellsbury and Jonah Nickerson earned All-American honors, with Nickerson’s performance in Omaha hurling him to the College World Series’ Most Outstanding Player.\n\nJoining that trio on the Pac-10 Conference’s all-league team were Gunderson, Cole Gillespie, Mitch Canham, Shea McFeely and Chris Kunda.\n\nCasey captured multiple Coach of the Year honors on the league, region and national level. The team went 50-16, won the Pac-10 Conference title and became the first team from a northern climate to win a CWS in 40 years."
