        "text": "Biography\n\nKEN GILLESPIE- SFCA\n\nPenticton, BC\n\nKen Gillespie was born in Vancouver in 1948 and spent most of his life in Calgary until moving to the Okanagan in 2000. He has been a full time professional artist for over 20 years and is a senior signature member (S.F.C.A) of the Federation of Canadian Artists. Ken has done over 40 solo shows in Canada's top Galleries. His works are collected world wide in private and public collections. Ken’s artwork has been in several Publications including ‘International Artists’ magazine in their ‘Master Painters of the World’ section. Gillespie currently resides in Peachland, BC.\n\n\"My artwork is about colour, shape, and texture, but above all an expression of beauty. Subject becoming less relevant, each painting having a life of its own, each stroke leading to the next. It is more about the connection of the spirit to the body to the canvas, above mind or intellect to canvas.”"
