I am having a hard time figuring out what races were regional and what ones were national that Masten Gregory competed in during those years. I am trying to sort this info out for the \"Race Successes Table\" I have created for his biography. Thanks in advance.\n\nAlso, was the California Sports Car Club apart of SCCA during this time?",

Hill climbs and drivers' schools are normally held separately from Regional meets but are on the same competitive level.\n\nAt the top of the SCCA's competition scale are the three professional series - U.S. Road Racing Championship, Canadian-American Challenge, and Trans-American Championship - and the FIA-listed National/Opens and Internationals.\n\n[b]SCCA-sanctioned events* 1962 1963 1964 1965 1966[/b] Hill climbs 15 12 10 6 6 Drivers' schools 53 53 66 64 66 Regionals & Restricteds 70 90 97 120 120 Divisionals 39 44 51 - - Nationals 13 10 11 52 58 Interdivisional - - 1 1 1 National/opens 3 11 12 11 14 Internationals 5 6 6 7 9 --- --- --- --- --- 198 226 254 261 274\n\n* An \"event\" is a weekend of racing and usually includes many races.\n\nIt is clear that the system changed following the 1964 Run-Offs with the old Divisionals being replaced by an increased number of Nationals and Regionals - the system most of us will recognise.\n\nOriginally posted by Terry O'Neil\n\nAccording to Road & Track an Allard K3 turned up at Watkins Glen in 1954 and entered the GP race. I quote \" Several Allard J2X's are present and one K3 sporting two '55 Packard 4-throat carbs on a Cad engine\" No drivers name is mentioned, and I have failed to spot the car described as a K3 in the programme. That means little though, as only the scantest of information was printed in the programme. Not much help I'm afraid. If you find out more about this entry - then let me know please.\n\nTerry\n\nOriginally posted by terry mcgrath\n\ndear all, I am trying to get photocopies of all the SCCA magazines prior to january 1950 as I have them all from this datte can anyone help\n\nregards terry australia"
