        "text": "(July 26, 1925 ~ October 31, 2016)\n\nJames (Jim) Kenneth Gillespie, 91, died Monday, October 31, at 6:00 a.m.\n\nVisitation will be from 10:00 a.m.-11:00 a.m. at Calvary Baptist Church, 155 River North Boulevard, in Stephenville, Texas, Wednesday, November 2, 2016. The funeral will begin at 11:00 AM at the church. Burial will be at 2:00 p.m. in the Gardens of Memory Cemetery in Stephenville. The funeral and burial will be under the direction of Stephenville Funeral Home.\n\nJim was born July 26, 1925, in Caldwell, Ohio, to Blaine and Gladys Gillespie. Jim entered the U.S. Navy in 1943, answering the call of duty during the dark days of World War II. He served on a PT boat in the South Pacific.\n\nJim met the love of his life, Elaine Bradshaw, in March, 1946. They were married July 3 of the same year and celebrated their 70th anniversary this year. Sons Ken and Dave were welcomed in 1948 and 1954, respectively.\n\nJim surrendered to the call of ministry and moved his young family to Fort Worth, Texas in 1950 to attend Fort Worth Theological Seminary. He served as pastor in churches in Ohio and Texas, spending the last sixteen years at Calvary Baptist Church in Stephenville, Texas. Even after retirement, Jim continued to minister both professionally and personally.\n\nJim’s life was marked by great love and kindness to everyone he encountered. He will be sorely missed by the family and many friends he leaves behind. We are blessed to have had the gift of his presence in our lives.\n\nJim was preceded in death by his parents, sisters Ruth Watson and Jean Austin, and great-grandchildren Christopher and William Reed. He is survived by his beloved wife Elaine, sons Ken Gillespie and Dave (Audrey) Gillespie, sister Shirley (Art) Martin, three beautiful granddaughters Shannon (Billy) Boyd, Sarah Reyna, and Lora (Stephen) Parker, eight great-grandchildren, and two great-great grandchildren.\n\nThe family would like to express our deep gratitude to the caring people at Hendrick Hospice Care and Wisteria Place. Special thanks to Liz, Teri, Elizabeth, Iliana, Linda, and Maria, who took such good care of all of us as Jim finished his race here on earth.\n\nWe thank God for the assurance that Jim’s absence here means he is home with his Lord and Savior. To God be the glory."
