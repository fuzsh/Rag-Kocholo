A long-time resident of Philadelphia, Kevin truly came into his own in this vibrant city, embodying its spirit of brotherly love and camaraderie. His early years were marked by a passion for the simple joys in life, a trait that he carried throughout his life. He found his calling in the food store industry, where his jovial nature and genuine interest in people made him a beloved figure among customers and colleagues alike. Kevin's laughter was infectious. He was always willing to lend a hand, and could strike up a conversation with anyone, making him a cherished presence in the community. Kevin was an avid gardener, finding solaceplants and flowers. His flair for decoration was especially evident in the care he took in adorning his block of Smedley Street for every occasion. These acts of beauty and care were Kevin's gifts to his neighbors, creating bonds that enriched the community.\n\nKevin's personal life was anchored by his profound love for his husband, Ira Shrager, with whom he shared a life of deep companionship and mutual respect. Their love was a testament to the power of shared passions and\n\nunwavering support. Together, they found joy in everyday moments, tending to their garden and taking walks with their cherished dogs, Rosebud and Isaac. The loss of Ira was a profound one for Kevin, yet he continued to embody the\n\nlove and resilience that defined their life together.\n\nKevin is survived by his loyal dog, Isaac, who continues to bring joy and companionship, and step-sons Joey Russomano of Effort, PA, and Ricky Russomano of Long Branch, NJ, who remember Kevin for his warmth, generosity,\n\nand the loving home he created. Kevin's passing leaves a void in the hearts of those who knew him, yet his\n\nspirit lives on in the countless lives he touched with his kindness, his laughter, and his unwavering sense of community. His legacy of love, kindness, and community engagement will continue to inspire all who had the privilege of knowing him. n lieu of flowers, the family requests that donations be made to the Philadelphia Animal Welfare Society (phillypaws.org), a cause close to Kevin's heart. A celebration of Kevin's life will be held at a later date, where friends and family can come together to honor his memory and the indelible mark he left on the world.\n\nReligious Services will be held on March 23, 2024,11:00AM at Saint Mark's Church 1625 Locust St. Phila., PA. 19103\n\nArr: Buddy Dougherty, F.D.\n\nHendricks\n\nEdith age 92, passed away peacefully on December 6, 2023. Beloved grandmother of Genine Robinson-Culler, Kareem Clark, Santa Clark, Precious Samples, Andrea Spencer, Destiny Ivory, Allah Ivory, Stephanie Moore, Shadora Moore, Jarred Ivory, Arabia Samples Dannette Moore-Hasson, Alphonso Moore, Alexander Moore and Stephon Hendricks. Edith was born and raised in Philadelphia, and is a lesson in self determination. Miss Edith doesn't recall specific details of her childhood, only that she enjoyed it. She does remember the family's trips to Virginia where her grandparents. In recounting why she enjoyed spending summer with her grandparents, she shared that her grandmother let her get away with murder because Miss Edith was her favorite grandchild, it was also this grandmother that gave her her outlook on life, saying \"Don't cry over spilled milk,\" and if there's nothing she can do about a situation, to let it go. Miss Edith said she cried like a baby when her grandmother died, She also acknowledges that \"I have been a determined person, I've always had a mind of her own, good or bad.\" She never got married, realizing that \"I couldn't put up with the two of us!\" Miss Edith always retained her independent spirit, saying \"if I want to do it, I did it.\" This is message from her grandson Stephon: Hey I know what I wanna say Grandma was the best grandma a person could ask for. She was a great person, everyone who knew her loved her. She was always there for me even when she couldn't be. She was more than my grandma she was my best fried. Whenever we would talk she always say \"l love you, you know that right.\" And I'd would say I LOVE YOU MORE GRANDMA. Rest easy now grandma. I love you more.\n\nRelatives and friends are invited to attend her Viewing and Funeral Saturday December 16, 2023 10:00AM at The Grasso Funeral Home 2544 S. Broad Street Phila.,PA.19145. Services will begin at 11:00AM. Int. Private.\n\nArr: Buddy Dougherty, F.D.\n\nRon Reuben was a man who possessed great musical talent, an uncanny sense of humor, an inquisitive mind, a desire to share his knowledge, and an ability to attract friends from different career orientations. He was also one of my greatest inspirations, a mentor, and a dear friend. We lost Ron on September 11, 2022, at 90 years old after a number of years of declining health. Ron was one of three instrumental teachers that I studied with who changed my life. (Joe Allard and Tom Nyfenger were the others.) I first learned of Ron in 1978 through Lawrence Feldman. Lawrence played me a tape of Ronnie’s live performance of a solo clarinet piece by Jean Rivier (Les Trois “S”) at an ICA Conference which thrilled me.\n\nI had never heard a clarinet tone as interesting and an articulation as resonant. This feeling was corroborated by many musicians over the years. (I once asked the revered clarinet technician Mark Jacobi who had the best sound among all the great clarinetists with whom he had worked. Mark said without any hesitation, “Ron Reuben.”) Soon after hearing that recording, I set up a lesson at Ron’s apartment in downtown Philadelphia. When he came to the door, he was in his boxer underwear with a tenor sax around his neck and a cigar between fingers of his right hand. He was upset because he couldn’t figure out a certain chord change in Lush Life, a Billy Strayhorn tune from Duke Ellington’s repertoire. My first thoughts were “What have I gotten myself into? This is the guy I came to study classical clarinet with?” Little did I know at the time that I would be beginning a 40+ year journey into the world of Ron Reuben, a world where one is in constant search of a more elegant and resonant musical expression ALONG WITH THE PERFECT MOUTHPIECE; a world where Benny Goodman, Artie Shaw, Stan Getz, Larry McKenna and Harold Wright reigned supreme; a world in which I experienced first-hand how giving a teacher can be and should be; and a world where no topic was immune from his ability to leave one in stitches with his jokes. By the way, that first lesson lasted 4 hours and Ron wouldn’t accept any payment from me, even though we had never met before. (He did allow me to take him out to dinner.)Ron was a brilliant clarinetist, bass clarinetist, and saxophonist with marvelous abilities in both orchestral playing, chamber music and jazz. He was a Philadelphia native who studied privately with Joseph Gigliotti and then with Anthony Gigliotti while a student at Curtis. He played in several influential ensembles after his conservatory studies including the Chicago Little Symphony, the Chamber Symphony of Philadelphia, Si Zentner’s Band, Terry Gibbs’ Band, and the Stan Kenton Orchestra. He also did club dates in and around Philadelphia as well as stand-up comedy. Ron even appeared on the “Tonight Show” with Steve Allen doing a bit with the grungeaphone—his invention that combined the bass clarinet with a bassoon.\n\nRon was appointed Bass Clarinetist with the Philadelphia Orchestra in 1967. During his long tenure with that orchestra, he developed great lifetime friendships with a number of players including Bernie Garfield (bassoon), Louis Rosenblatt (English horn), and Sid Curtis (viola), and Anthony Gigliotti (clarinet). Here he is with Bernie Garfield\n\nRon was fiercely proud of the orchestra and never failed to talk about how great it was to play with them. He was especially proud of the Philadelphia woodwind tradition that started with Tabuteau, Bonade, Kincaid, Schoenbach, McLane, etc. and that his generation of players still respected. He allowed me to attend every Tuesday rehearsal The Philadelphia Orchestra played at Carnegie Hall when they made their monthly trips to New York in the 1980s and those were some of my most memorable musical experiences. Here are excerpts from two of Ron’s recordings with them. First, in 1967 with Eugene Ormandy conducting Grofé’s Grand Canyon Suite as well as the 1976 recording of Tchaikovsky’s Manfred Symphony. They are indicative of his magnificent sound, expression, and facility on the bass clarinet:\n\nRon’s diverse musical interests informed his performances with Philly. Here is his rendition of the tenor saxophone solo in Ravel’s Bolero from 1982 with Ricardo Muti conducting. I still find his interpretation to be the most endearing and musical statement of Ravel’s melody:\n\nHis sincere love of swing jazz was a lifelong passion. The influence of Artie Shaw and Stan Getz were evident in his jazz playing. The conductor Dennis Russell Davies recognized this ability and requested him to be the clarinet soloist in Bernstein’s Prelude, Riffs and Fugue with Philly as well as the tenor sax soloist in Ellington’s Les Trois Rois Noirs with the American Composers Orchestra. Here’s Ron playing the Blues on tenor saxophone with a Philadelphia group of musicians:\n\nDuring his 38 years with The Philadelphia Orchestra, he also taught at several schools including Temple University, The New School of Music, and the Philadelphia College of the Performing Arts. He was beloved by those who studied with him and was an in-demand source for young players who were taking clarinet or bass clarinet auditions. I have heard from numerous professionals how helpful and giving Ron was to them in those scenarios and that he did not accept payment for his time in many cases.\n\nI would be remiss if I didn’t mention the role Ron’s wife, Marian, played in his life. Anyone as brilliant, talented, and sensitive as Ron who works under the pressure of a major job can provide challenges for a partner. Marian was a rock throughout all the years I knew them and especially so these last few years. Much of what Ron accomplished is due to her love and support. Thank you, Marian, for allowing all of us to enjoy and learn from Ron.\n\nIn conclusion, I feel blessed that I had the opportunity to study with Ron and become friends with a musical giant. His friends became my friends and his influence on my life has been monumental. I, along with countless others, could not imagine our lives without him. He was a unique individual who made life interesting and eventful. I will always miss Ron Reuben.\n\nCourtesy of Ed Joffe\n\nPat, 77, the renowned and influential Philadelphia jazz guitarist known for the fluidity and speed of his impeccable playing throughout a six-decade career and who relearned how to play guitar after suffering a brain aneurysm in 1980, has died.\n\nMr. Martino, who was born Patrick Azzara, died Monday after a long illness in the same South Philly rowhouse where he grew up, his longtime manager Joseph Donofrio said.\n\nThe guitarist had been suffering from chronic respiratory disorder since 2018, Donofrio said. Mr. Martino had been breathing with the assistance of oxygen and unable to play the guitar since finishing a 2018 tour in Italy.\n\nThe jazz world mourned Mr. Martino’s passing. Philadelphia guitarist Kevin Eubanks called him “a great inspiration” and a “beautiful guitarist” on Twitter. “Thanks for all the beauty you shared.” Center City venue Chris’ Jazz Cafe posted on Twitter that Mr. Martino, who frequently played the venue, was “a beloved member of our jazz family. We will miss him and the beautiful music he brought to the club.”\n\n\"He changed the way you play the guitar,” said Philadelphia jazz organist Joey DeFrancesco, who toured with Mr. Martino and played with him and drummer Billy Hart on the 2001 album Live at Yoshi’s. “He took his influences like Wes Montgomery and Kenny Burrell and people like that and he just made his own way of playing. He and George Benson are the most influential guitarists.”\n\nOn Mr. Martino’s albums like El Hombre, recorded with organist Trudi Pitts in 1967 when he was 22, through Formidable, released 50 years later in 2017, “nobody played like that,” DeFrancesco said, speaking from his home in Arizona. “His playing was very clean and clear, and at the same time he swung. He had the grease on his playing. He was very special.” Along with Montgomery (who was a major influence on Martino), Burrell, Benson, and Grant Green, Mr. Martino “is one of the top five guitarists of all time,” DeFrancesco said.\n\nMr. Martino was a prodigy who studied with renowned Philadelphia music educator Dennis Sandole, who also taught John Coltrane, whom Martino was friendly with. As a teen he played music with South Philly friends like drummer and pop star Bobby Rydell and moved from South Philly to Harlem when he was 15 to play with his heroes.\n\n“He had perfect pitch,” said John Mulhern, a student of Mr. Martino’s and a friend for nearly 50 years. “He had a gift.”George Benson has frequently told the story of when he first encountered Mr. Martino in the 1960s in a New York club called Small’s Paradise.\n\n“I was out on the town, thinking I had conquered New York,” Benson recalled on a video posted on YouTube. “And I saw this young kid … and this guitar leaped out of nowhere. And some of the most incredible lines I had ever heard. Everything in it. Great tone, great articulation and the whole crowd — and it was a black audience — went crazy. And I said to myself, if this is a sample of what New York is, like, I’m getting out of here.”\n\nMartino was born with an arteriovenous malformation, an abnormality of blood vessels in the brain and frequently suffered seizures before nearly dying from an aneurysm when he was teaching in California in 1980. Surgery at Pennsylvania Hospital saved his life, though he lost much of his memory, including the knowledge of how to play the guitar, which he relearned in a painstaking process that took years.\n\nIn 2011, when his autobiography Here and Now written with Bill Milkowski came out, he told The Inquirer that the aneurysm was “the greatest thing that ever happened to me.”\n\n“What’s on my mind is a greater focus with more intimate accuracy on each and every moment so that I can truly focus on what life is really all about,” he said. “The mind has a way of thinking about things that have nothing to do with the moment, but if I can love my life in that moment, I’m in the right place at the right time.”\n\nMr. Martino is survived by his wife, Ayako. There is no plan for a memorial service, but there will be a musical celebration of Mr. Martino’s life in Philadelphia in the coming months, Donofrio said.\n\nFuneral Arrangements entrusted\n\nGrasso Funeral Home\n\nBuddy Dougherty, L.F.D.\n\nAltamuro\n\nHeaven gained an amazing angel when Raymond Altamuro, formerly from South Philadelphia, now resting in the ever loving arms of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ, passed away peacefully, Friday, March 26, 2021, surrounded by his loving wife of 57 years, Antoinette (DiDonato) and his family.

As a young child, Maria enjoyed singing in school, as well as the craft of sewing. She attended vocational school and would often make her own clothes, and later clothes and dresses for her children. Maria met Orlando Carrozza, also from South Philadelphia, in Wildwood, New Jersey. They were married on June 10, 1950 at Saint Thomas Aquinas Catholic Church. Maria and Orlando had three children – Maria, Rosanne and Anthony. She was an extremely devoted mother who proudly spent her time cooking, upkeeping her house and caring for her children, as well as her parents. As the fearless matriarch, Maria made their house a home and prided herself with placing the highest value on the needs of her family.\n\nThroughout her young life, Maria worked several jobs, including at a patch-making factory and, some years later, a neighborhood candy store. It was there that Maria saved enough money to purchase her first car after completing driving lessons with her oldest daughter. In her spare time, Maria was actively involved in a ladies Bingo group that she referred to as “club.”\n\nIn 1975, Maria became a crossing guard in Northeast Philadelphia, covering a busy five-point intersection. This part-time job was ideal since it allowed her the time she needed to also care for her father who was living with her family at the time. Maria worked as a crossing guard for 32 years, retiring at the age of 79. She was also a constant presence and highly active in caring for her three grandchildren – Joey, Kristina and Alyssa. Cooking was Maria’s passion and one of her many talents. Each week, Tuesdays, Thursdays and Sundays were religiously reserved as macaroni night. Maria loved to host elaborate, multicourse dinners for her family and friends. She was truly a “one-woman show” and somehow did it all herself with poise, grace and impeccable timeliness. Her happiest times were spent around the dinner table with her family.\n\nOn July 31, 2011, Maria was suddenly diagnosed with a rare form of Vasculitis that attacked her lungs and kidneys. Her immediate family was advised, due to the graveness of her disease, her life expectancy would be approximately six months. This disease ultimately led to dialysis treatments three times a week for close to 10 consecutive years, a heart valve replacement at age 87, and many other resulting health issues that further compromised her quality of life. She endured a tremendous amount of irreversible pain the entire time, yet never complained or faltered. Maria is a remarkably strong woman and remained a fighter throughout every obstacle that arose. Her daughter, Rosanne, a Registered Nurse, spearheaded all of Maria’s medical and personal care, with the assistance of her siblings and her children. These tireless, triumphant efforts gave her family nearly a decade of precious time with Maria that they would have otherwise never had.\n\nThis past year was exceptionally challenging with the added concern of keeping Maria safe throughout the pandemic. Taking every precautionary measure possible, Maria and her family strictly observed all safety protocols daily, even in her own home. These efforts were not in vain as Maria remained covid-free throughout her last breath. Her battle ultimately ended on February 27, 2021, due to septic shock of unknown etiology, however her fight never did.\n\nMaria will be sorely missed, but her memory will remain alive in the hearts of her family, always and forever.\n\nA Personal Reflection of Maria:\n\nOur Devoted Mom\n\nOur Beloved Mommom\n\nThroughout her life, our Mom always prioritized her family. She exemplified unshakable strength for everyone and, later, for herself to fight her everyday health battle. She was the strongest, bravest, most courageous woman we know. Our Mom is the epitome of mother and grandmother, and set the standard for our entire family. She was our rock, our pillar of strength, and our beacon of light, hope and inspiration.\n\nOur Mom exemplified family and led by truest example. Without hesitation or even needing to be asked, she instinctively and unconditionally was there for anything any of us needed. There was never a time that she was not available to help, to guide, to support, to sacrifice, to advise, to praise, to correct, to encourage, to laugh, or just to love. She never said “no” and never expected anything in return. She was selfless, elegant, gracious, and generous beyond words.\n\nThrough her years, she instilled her family values and wisdom in us and taught us that family is paramount. Then, in her time of need, when her health took an unexpected turn, we were blessed with the opportunity to care for her and reciprocate the same unconditional love and support that we learned and gained from her throughout our lives.\n\nEverything our Mom did was always done with love. It was instant, constant, abundant, and most importantly, from the depths of her heart. She established our strong core family connection, that she learned from her parents, and taught us to place the highest value on family-togetherness and the quality time we spent.\n\nWe will always continue to honor, treasure and cherish the moments and memories we shared with her – From every holiday where we would be gathered around the dining room table for our traditional dinners (which she shopped for, prepped and cooked entirely by herself), to our birthday celebrations at her house, to the summers spent at our family shore house in North Wildwood, New Jersey.\n\nOur Mom’s greatest achievement in life is knowing that she raised three good-hearted, hard-working, caring, loving children who, in turn, raised three wonderful children of their own – her adoring grandchildren. This made her beam with pride, as she found so much joy and fulfillment in her family.\n\nOur Mom’s legacy IS her children and grandchildren. We are a direct reflection of her and have become the people we are today because of her. We will forever be grateful for her incredible influence and exceptional example. Although impossible to attain, we will try our best to uphold her values with the same dignity and class.\n\n“Thank you very much,” Mom/Mommom. We love you forever and will continue to make you proud, always.\n\nHer Funeral Information:\n\nCarrozza\n\nMaria Giuseppe \"Jo\" (nee Tatta) age 92 passed away peacefully on February 27, 2021.

MASKS AND SOCIAL DISTANCING ARE REQUESTED.\n\nCiasullo\n\nThomas Francis Ciasullo, 91, passed away peacefully on January 7, 2021.\n\nThomas was born on December 9, 1929, in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania to the late Louis and Mary (Crescenzo) Ciasullo. He was a 1947 graduate of Northeast Catholic High School. Employed for 38 years at DuPont Printing Company in Philadelphia and Boothwyn, PA, Tom operated their 4-color printing press, and was proud of his eye for color and flair for mechanics. He also served in the United States Army Reserves for many years.\n\nUpon his retirement from DuPont in the early 1980’s, Tom spent several years traveling the world, visiting 35 countries, often in the capacity as an international courier. As physical limitations made it difficult for travel, he enjoyed local activities, including weekly bocci ball games at Marconi Plaza and Tuesday nights at the Mummers’ summer concerts. He delighted in all things flowers and plants, and was an active member of the Pennsylvania Horticultural Society, enjoying day trips to wildflower preserves, nurseries, and parks. Tom was an avid fan of all Philadelphia pro sports teams, but his favoriite was Villanova Basketball. He was adventurous and daring—well into his 50’s—enjoying deep-sea fishing, scuba diving, parasailing, sky diving, and hot-air ballooning. His facination with bees kept him studying and observing for years, spending countless hours at his favorite New Jersey bee farm, even adorning the “bee beard” at a New Jersey honey festival. His greatest joy was his family, attending every sporting and music event for his grandchildren, and never missing an invitation to a family gathering—near or far.\n\nTom was a devout and active member of Stella Maris Church, where he served on the Parish Council, and started a volunteer organization to take elderly people to doctor visits, shopping, and recreational activities. He was generous with his time and resources to anyone who was in need of help.\n\nThomas was predeceased by his beloved wife Rosemary (Maddaloni); devoted second mother Adeline Ciasullo; brother Norbert Ciasullo; sister Patricia Lose (late Hal); and very recently sister Mary Koob and her husband, Robert Koob. He is survived by his two children, Louise Ciasullo Masterson (Edward) of Holland, PA and Joseph T. Ciasullo (Christine) of Sewell, NJ; daughters of heart Sandra Landolfi (Steve), Diane Meyers, and Gina Santiago (Fernand). He is loving “Pop Pop” to his three grandchildren, Michael Masterson (Laura), Joseph J. Ciasullo and Maria Ciasullo, and great-grandchild Olivia Joan Masterson; devoted sister to Marian Vile (late Henry) and Frances McDonough (Ed). Adored Uncle, Cousin and Godfather to many.\n\nFor relatives and friends who are comfortable to attend, a visitation at Stella Maris Church, 9th and Bigler Streets, Philadelphia, PA, will be held on Wednesday, January 13 at 9:00 a.m., followed by a Funeral Mass at 10:00 a.m. Interment to be at New St. Mary Cemetery in Bellmawr, NJ. Strict Covid guidelines for masks and social distancing must be followed.\n\nIn lieu of flowers, donations may be sent to Stella Maris Church.\n\nArr: Buddy Dougherty F.D.\n\nJune 6, 1932 - September 11, 2022\n\nCourtesy of Ed Joffe\n\nRon Reuben was a man who possessed great musical talent, an uncanny sense of humor, an inquisitive mind, a desire to share his knowledge, and an ability to attract friends from different career orientations. He was also one of my greatest inspirations, a mentor, and a dear friend. We lost Ron on September 11, 2022, at 90 years old after a number of years of declining health. Ron was one of three instrumental teachers that I studied with who changed my life. (Joe Allard and Tom Nyfenger were the others.) I first learned of Ron in 1978 through Lawrence Feldman. Lawrence played me a tape of Ronnie’s live performance of a solo clarinet piece by Jean Rivier (Les Trois “S”) at an ICA Conference which thrilled me.\n\nI had never heard a clarinet tone as interesting and an articulation as resonant. This feeling was corroborated by many musicians over the years. (I once asked the revered clarinet technician Mark Jacobi who had the best sound among all the great clarinetists with whom he had worked. Mark said without any hesitation, “Ron Reuben.”) Soon after hearing that recording, I set up a lesson at Ron’s apartment in downtown Philadelphia. When he came to the door, he was in his boxer underwear with a tenor sax around his neck and a cigar between fingers of his right hand. He was upset because he couldn’t figure out a certain chord change in Lush Life, a Billy Strayhorn tune from Duke Ellington’s repertoire. My first thoughts were “What have I gotten myself into? This is the guy I came to study classical clarinet with?” Little did I know at the time that I would be beginning a 40+ year journey into the world of Ron Reuben, a world where one is in constant search of a more elegant and resonant musical expression ALONG WITH THE PERFECT MOUTHPIECE; a world where Benny Goodman, Artie Shaw, Stan Getz, Larry McKenna and Harold Wright reigned supreme; a world in which I experienced first-hand how giving a teacher can be and should be; and a world where no topic was immune from his ability to leave one in stitches with his jokes. By the way, that first lesson lasted 4 hours and Ron wouldn’t accept any payment from me, even though we had never met before. (He did allow me to take him out to dinner.)Ron was a brilliant clarinetist, bass clarinetist, and saxophonist with marvelous abilities in both orchestral playing, chamber music and jazz. He was a Philadelphia native who studied privately with Joseph Gigliotti and then with Anthony Gigliotti while a student at Curtis. He played in several influential ensembles after his conservatory studies including the Chicago Little Symphony, the Chamber Symphony of Philadelphia, Si Zentner’s Band, Terry Gibbs’ Band, and the Stan Kenton Orchestra. He also did club dates in and around Philadelphia as well as stand-up comedy. Ron even appeared on the “Tonight Show” with Steve Allen doing a bit with the grungeaphone—his invention that combined the bass clarinet with a bassoon.\n\nRon was appointed Bass Clarinetist with the Philadelphia Orchestra in 1967. During his long tenure with that orchestra, he developed great lifetime friendships with a number of players including Bernie Garfield (bassoon), Louis Rosenblatt (English horn), and Sid Curtis (viola), and Anthony Gigliotti (clarinet). Here he is with Bernie Garfield\n\nRon was fiercely proud of the orchestra and never failed to talk about how great it was to play with them. He was especially proud of the Philadelphia woodwind tradition that started with Tabuteau, Bonade, Kincaid, Schoenbach, McLane, etc. and that his generation of players still respected. He allowed me to attend every Tuesday rehearsal The Philadelphia Orchestra played at Carnegie Hall when they made their monthly trips to New York in the 1980s and those were some of my most memorable musical experiences. Here are excerpts from two of Ron’s recordings with them. First, in 1967 with Eugene Ormandy conducting Grofé’s Grand Canyon Suite as well as the 1976 recording of Tchaikovsky’s Manfred Symphony. They are indicative of his magnificent sound, expression, and facility on the bass clarinet:\n\nRon’s diverse musical interests informed his performances with Philly. Here is his rendition of the tenor saxophone solo in Ravel’s Bolero from 1982 with Ricardo Muti conducting. I still find his interpretation to be the most endearing and musical statement of Ravel’s melody:\n\nHis sincere love of swing jazz was a lifelong passion. The influence of Artie Shaw and Stan Getz were evident in his jazz playing. The conductor Dennis Russell Davies recognized this ability and requested him to be the clarinet soloist in Bernstein’s Prelude, Riffs and Fugue with Philly as well as the tenor sax soloist in Ellington’s Les Trois Rois Noirs with the American Composers Orchestra. Here’s Ron playing the Blues on tenor saxophone with a Philadelphia group of musicians:\n\nDuring his 38 years with The Philadelphia Orchestra, he also taught at several schools including Temple University, The New School of Music, and the Philadelphia College of the Performing Arts. He was beloved by those who studied with him and was an in-demand source for young players who were taking clarinet or bass clarinet auditions. I have heard from numerous professionals how helpful and giving Ron was to them in those scenarios and that he did not accept payment for his time in many cases.\n\nI would be remiss if I didn’t mention the role Ron’s wife, Marian, played in his life. Anyone as brilliant, talented, and sensitive as Ron who works under the pressure of a major job can provide challenges for a partner. Marian was a rock throughout all the years I knew them and especially so these last few years. Much of what Ron accomplished is due to her love and support. Thank you, Marian, for allowing all of us to enjoy and learn from Ron.\n\nIn conclusion, I feel blessed that I had the opportunity to study with Ron and become friends with a musical giant. His friends became my friends and his influence on my life has been monumental. I, along with countless others, could not imagine our lives without him. He was a unique individual who made life interesting and eventful. I will always miss Ron Reuben."
