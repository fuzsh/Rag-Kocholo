        "text": "With locations in Indian Rocks Beach, Madeira Beach, and St Pete Beach, SLYCE proudly serves up stone-baked artisan pizza in a contemporary and relaxed setting.\n\nWe offer indoor and outdoor dining options, as well as takeout and delivery (call to confirm delivery radius). SLYCE is also a great spot to watch your favorite sports and catch all the big games. And if live music is what you’re into, we’ve got you covered there as well.\n\nSLYCE is an active member of our local communities, proudly supporting several charitable nonprofits along with our own community initiatives that we hold so near and dear to our hearts. We truly believe that when we all do a little, BIG THINGS can be accomplished.\n\nSLYCE opened its first location in June of 2011 in the beautiful Gulf community of Indian Rocks Beach, FL. Our focus now, as it was then, is to provide exceptional service and amazing food and drinks, served up in an upbeat and contemporary atmosphere where everyone is made to feel like family.\n\nWith the success and momentum gained from our first location in IRB, we continued to grow, opening a second location in Madeira Beach, FL in February 2017. We also built and now operate a custom tow-behind mobile pizza kitchen used for charity, local events, and private catering engagements.\n\nAs SLYCE continues to evolve, we are proud to reflect on the success of our third and most recent location, SLYCE ST PETE BEACH. Situated on Gulf Blvd next to the famed Post Card Inn, this location faced some initial delays due to the COVID-19 pandemic. However, through hard work, dedication, and unyielding community support, we were able to overcome these challenges and successfully open our doors. We remain grateful for the ongoing support from our community and look forward to many more years of serving you.\n\nBrodey Sitton Foundation: Our Sitton Supreme pizza is closest to our hearts. This pizza was created to honor Army Staff Sergeant Matthew Sitton who was killed in Afghanistan August 2, 2012. He left behind his wife and son (9 months old at the time). The Sitton family is close friends with one of the founders. We knew we needed to help the family long term and decided a pizza in Matt’s honor was the way to go. We have committed to donating $2 from every large Sitton Supreme sold to his wife and son until Brodey turns 18 years old.\n\nThe Beach Community Food Pantry: At our Indian Rocks Beach location the first Monday of every month 10% of sales is donated to the Beach Community Food Pantry which is run through Calvary Episcopal Church right in Indian Rocks Beach. We also donate food, with help from our vendors, during Thanksgiving and Christmas to help out with the over 150 families in need.\n\nPhilip Bryant Melanoma Foundation: There is both a golf tournament and music festival associated with this foundation that we participate in each year. Beginning in 2019 we will be the main sponsor for the golf tournament.\n\nLove McKinely Organization: This organization works with Johns Hopkins All Children’s Hospital to improve the resources available to families throughout their course of treatment for pediatric cancer. McKinely, who the organization is named after, is part of our Slyce family. Her parents have been friends with Jack for a long time. Each year there is a charity golf tournament and auction held to raise funds. We support them by donating our time and dinner for the participants and friends who come out for the event. In 2018 there were over 250 people who attended the dinner where they raised over $60K for the organization.\n\nIRB Homeowners Association | Oktoberfest in IRB: Slyce has participated in this event since 2012. The HOA does a great job with bringing in a variety of vendors and it’s always a great time each year.\n\nAction 2000 | Taste of IRB: This event takes place right in the back yard of the Indian Rocks Beach location each November. There are many local food vendors along with fantastic entertainment.\n\nAs we open additional locations, we will continue to find local causes and events to help support the communities in which we operate."
