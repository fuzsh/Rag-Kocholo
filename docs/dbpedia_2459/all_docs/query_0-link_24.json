He was born July 19, 1934, and passed away on Nov. 12, 2022. Dad was born to Walton and Marion in Illinois and is survived by his brother Jack and Jack’s lovely wife Sylvia.\n\nAfter finishing high school, Dad enlisted into the United States Navy as a sonar technician. After his military service, he entered college to study English, later becoming an English and Literature teacher for high school students. A man always up for a challenge and with a desire to give back, Dad found a calling in teaching troubled students in inner city schools. He was loved and adored by students from all walks of life. After moving from Oakland, Calif., to Ridgecrest, Calif., Dad decided to explore a new career in the automotive industry as a finance director. He would go on to join the local Ridgecrest chapter of the Elks Lodge (Chapter 1913) where he was elected twice as the Exalted Ruler.

His family and friends will forever remember that he always kept a smile on his face, loved everything from Shakespeare to religious songs, and greeted everyone with a booming and warm voice.\n\nDad lived his life with passion; he had enough passion for several people. A true poet and wordsmith, his passion was evident in how he would assemble words thoughtfully in his daily speech, as well as for poems that were not only captivating, but moving. Through mastering the English language, he became skilled at crafting words together in a way that would touch even the hardest of hearts. It was pure love and joy for him to recite so many poems and songs, and it was an honor for those who were lucky enough to listen to them.\n\nCharles Patrick Gillespie, January 17, 1970 – September 7, 2021.
