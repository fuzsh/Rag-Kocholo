        "text": "Ken Gillespie\n\nMay 9, 1951- June 5, 2014\n\nOn June 5, 2014 Ken”s life was cut short in a tragic accident.\n\nKen was born on May 9, 1951 in Kansas City, Missouri. The last 15 years of his life were spent making Laytonville his home. Along with his wife Carrie, Ken was the proud owner of Long Valley Lumber and those traveling through town couldn”t miss the new construction going on at the store. Like everything Ken did, he had a vision for what the lumber yard should be and he was hard at work executing it.\n\nIn the past few weeks as Ken”s family and friends have come together to process the loss and support one another in their grief, a few phrases keep coming up: dedicated husband and father, carpenter and master craftsman, adventurer, great friend, generous and community minded.\n\nKen was a man of many talents and multiple interests. He was a contractor and master carpenter and throughout his career built nearly 100 custom homes in North Carolina, Central California, and many here in our community.\n\nKen”s own home is a reflection of his skilled craftsmanship featuring off grid and state of the art solar and water systems, custom cabinetry, and an entire fir tree supporting the great room. Ken enjoyed wood working in his spare time which is evidenced by the beautiful canoes and the 31-foot Brown Trimaran he built. Recently he was teaching himself to turn beautiful wood bowls.\n\nKen was an avid adventurer – including a blue water ocean passage from Hawaii to California, skate boarding (back in the day when you had to build the board first and then find an empty pool), fly fishing, helicopter skiing in Canada, golf, and of course, flying. Ken flew his plane across the U.S. and was planning another trip this summer.\n\nBut even with all of the things that kept him busy, Ken was never too busy to stop and talk with family and friends. He would listen to problems, give advice, jump in to help with projects, or sometimes just stop and ask how you were doing. Ken loved being a part of the Laytonville community, donating time and materials for projects at the school and around town. Ken was a board member of the Long Valley Health Center and was involved with fund raising projects to help local students.\n\nKen is survived by the love of his life, a woman he referred to as “the real deal”, his wife of 35 years, Carrie, their daughter Erin and her husband Robert Simmons of Wilmington, North Carolina. Ken”s father Vic Gillespie and wife Joyce of Fulton, Missouri, his oldest brother Dan Gillespie and wife Gina of Rockledge, Florida, their children Jan, Cheryl, Richard and Matthew, brother Ed Gillespie and wife Patty of Greenwood, California, and their children Bailey and Evan, brother Marty Gillespie of Prescott, Arizona and his daughter Shannon, sister Cindy Moraga and best friend Cathy Ayuso of Merced, California and son Anthony Moraga. Ken is also survived by his mother-in-law Anne Bath of Fair Oaks, California, cousin Pete Swanton of Willits, sister-in-law Carol Bath of Eugene, Oregon and her children Shannon Ford and Morgan DeBold, both of Laytonville and Jesse Bath of Cottage Grove, Oregon.\n\nKen will be greatly missed by friends and family far and wide. In lieu of flowers, his family wishes that donations be made to Long Valley Health Center Scholarship Fund, P.O. Box 870, Laytonville, CA 95454 or Laytonville Healthy Start Family Resource Center, P.O. Box 1382, Laytonville, CA 95454.\n\nA celebration of Ken”s life will be held at the Black Oak Ranch festival grounds (the Hog Farm) on Sunday, July 6 at 5 p.m. Please bring your favorite Ken story and a potluck to share.\n\nArrangements under the care and direction of Anker-Lucier Mortuary."
