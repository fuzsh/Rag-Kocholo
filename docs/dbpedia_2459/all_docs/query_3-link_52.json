        "text": "Keith “Bones” Gillespie, 58, of Brevard, received his wings on August 1, 2017, surrounded by his family. He was born in Transylvania County on January 12, 1959 to the late Marie Whitmire Gillespie and Kenneth Gillespie. Keith was a corrections officer and loved to play music at church with his family. He was a member of Oak Grove Community Church.\n\nHe is survived by his wife, Cassandra Gillespie; five children, Ashley Weaver, Stephen Phillips, Stephanie Phillips, Kelsey Gillespie and Joshua Gillespie; he also leaves behind four grandchildren, Bella, Nevaeh, Katy Lynn and Glenn Phillips, who will miss him forever. Keith also leaves behind his sister, Renee Lacky of Pageland, SC; brother, Dennis Gillespie of Brevard, NC; many nieces, nephews, aunts, uncles and cousins that love him dearly. Our daddy lived for us, so we are living for him.\n\nHis celebration of life will be held on August 13, 2017 at Oak Grove Community Church at 3:00 PM. Wayne Hooper and Anthony Cantrell will be officiating.\n\nThe family would like to thank everyone for the generosity, support and prayers that has been shown to them during this time.\n\n\"Daddy please watch over us and protect us.\""
