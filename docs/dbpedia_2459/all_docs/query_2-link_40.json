Family legend states that he was born in Ireland and came to America with his three brothers. They were probably among the \"Great Migration of Scotch-Irish\" who started arriving in America in 1730.\n\nHe was an early settler of the Lewis Land Grant, located in the basin of the James River above the mouth of the Cowpasture River in Orange County, Virginia. The settlement of the Cowpasture River is described in detail in Oren F. Morton's Annals of Bath County, Virginia.[3] Morton states that it is probable no settlers arrived there before 1743.\n\nHe owned a powder mill and was also thought to be a gun maker, but proof of this is elusive.[4]\n\nRobert passed away before April 1798, presumably in Botetourt County, Virginia.[5].\n\nMililtary Service\n\nHe lived in Augusta County (now Alleghany County), Virginia, where he served with Dickinson's Rangers in 1754 during the French & Indian War under Capt. William Preston and under George Washington in the Old Virginia Regiment.[6]\n\nIn 1754, during the French and Indian War, Robert served as Sergeant in Captain Dickerson's Company of Rangers.[7]\n\n\"For participation in the wars of the Colony of Virginia against the French and Indians, and for service rendered by the Militia in defense of the frontiers, the King's Proclamation of 1763 granted certain amounts of land. The amount given to field officers was 5,000 acres; to captains, 3000 acres; to subalterns or staff officers, 2000 acres; to non-commissioned officers, 200 acres; to privates, 50 acres. The Original Warrants or Certificates of the subjoined abstracts are to be found in two MMS. Volumes, deposited in the State Land Office, Richmond, Virginia.\"[8]\n\nCaptain Thomas Madison, commissary of Colonel William Christian's Expedition against the Cherokees in 1776, purchased horses for the troops that assembled in Botetourt County in early August 1776. Horses were purchased from many including Robert Gillespy.[9]\n\nAll males over 18 years of age had to serve in the local militia. Robert, Simon, and William Gillaspy are in Company 23, which covered the area where the Jackson River joins the Cowpasture River to form the James River.[citation needed]\n\nIn 1786, James Gillaspy also served in Company 23.[10]\n\nLegacy\n\nElizabeth Hicks Carron states in her book The History of Clifton Forge, Virginia that this town was founded upon Robert Gillespie's land grant.[11]\n\n\"The history of Clifton Forge began when a settlement was made on a portion of the land granted to Lord Botetourt, Governor of Virginia, from King George III. On May 12, 1770, the Governor of the colony of Virginia granted 54 acres of land to Robert Gallaspy. (Now spelled Gillespie or Gillispie by his many descendants.) Robert Gallaspy was a frontiersman and farmed the land below Iron Gate, at the head of the James River, where the L. C. Gibsons, descendants of Robert Gallaspy, now live. (The original log cabin, owned by the first settler, was torn down in 1968 in order to build a new home.) … Two years later in 1772, another tract of land was granted to the same Robert Gallaspy. His holdings, consisting of something over 200 acres of flat-bottom land suitable for cultivation, lay on the north side of Jackson River and both sides of what is now Smith Creek.\n\n\"In June, 1789, Robert Gallasphy died, and willed 126 acres of land to his son, Alexander. On October 8, 1805, his son sold the land to Alexander Wilson, who in turn sold the land to James Breckenridge.\"\n\n\"It was in 1794, that perhaps the first furnace was constructed in the Iron Gate Gorge when the Jackson River had worn away the mountain and exposed great mineral wealth on the land granted to Robert Gallaspy in the early 1770's. Gillaspie probably established the iron furnace, setting the buildings on the great river boulders for firm foundation. This ‘Forge under the cliff' was the parent of the ‘Old Clifton Forge'.\"[12][13]\n\nThere is a marker at Clifton Forge, Virginia—a marker put there by DAR sometime in the 1920's or 1930's stating that the City of Clifton Forge was built on property owned by Robert Gillespie (Gilaspy). Given to him by the King of England.[14]\n\nWill & Death\n\nLast Will & Testament of Robert Gillispy, Sr.[5]\n\nBotetourt County, Virginia.\n\n23 May 1797.\n\nApril 1798 (proved).\n\nRobert made bequests to:\n\nmy Son William\n\nmy daughter Isbell\n\nmy daughter Mary\n\nmy Son Robert\n\nmy Son John\n\nmy son James\n\nmy Son Alexander\n\nmy Wife\n\nmy daughter Jean\n\nmy GrandSon John Gillespy\n\nThe last record we have for Robert Gillespy Sr. is his Will in which he names his five sons and three daughters. Simon, Robert Jr., James, and William Gillaspey are mentioned in this Will. In Item 3 he states that he leaves no part of his estate to son William and daughters Isabell and Mary because he had already given them their share. He leaves his land to sons Robert Jr., John, and Alexander. His son John is to pay 20 pounds to son James (brother of John) before John can inherit his share of the land.\n\nIn Item 8, Robert entrusts the care of his wife (not named) to his son Alexander who is to \"keep her in good sufficient Meat, Drink, Washing, Lodging, and Good Clothing and in case my son Alexander should marry and there should be such Discord as to render it so as my wife could not live comfortable and agreeable without a separation, than my son Alexander shall give her the above support apart to herself.\"\n\nIn Item 9 he leaves youngest daughter Jean her \"bed of furniture that is called hers\" and one black mare and colt, and in Item 10 he gives his bay mare's colt to grandson John Gillespy. He closes the Will with these sentences, \"And lastly I appoint my Beloved friend Simon Gillispy and my sons John and Alexander, my soul Executors of this my last Will and Testament and all other Wills and Legacies heretofore made I do revoke and by these presents they are Revoked. In witness I have hereunto set my hand and seal this 23 day of May 1797.\n\nExecutors: my Beloved friend Simon Gillispy Sen'r. & my Sons John & alexander.\n\nWitnesses: Joseph Haynes, Archibate Linocker, Elizabeth Harneberger, Judith Shaver.\n\nAt the April 1798 Court of Botetourt County, the Last Will and Testament of Robert Gillispy Sr. Deceased was exhibited in Court and Proved by the Oath of Joseph Haynes one of the Witnesses thereto and Ordered to Lie for further Proof and at another Court held for Said County in June next thereafter the Same was fully Proved by the Oath of John Lingougher another Witness thereto Subscribed and Thereupon Ordered to be Recorded.[5]\n\nLand\n\nRobert Gillespie claimed several tracts of land surveyed near the junction of the Cowpasture, Jackson, and James Rivers in the 30,000 acre Lewis Land Grant.[3]\n\nOn 9 June 1750, a 54 acre tract on the Jackson River (the lower end of Cowpasture River) was surveyed for James Montgomery.[15] This land is near a 50 acre tract surveyed the same day for William Gillespy. Robert Montgomery inherited this tract from his father James Montgomery but failed to pay the quit-rent [citation needed]. On 12 May 1770, this land was granted (by patent) to Robert Galaspy. [see below 12 May 1770 land patent]\n\nOn 18 June 1766, 40 acres on the north side of James River was surveyed for Robert Gallespey, adjacent to Robert's patent land.[1] [see below 10 September 1767 land patent; when was he granted \"Robert's patent land\"?]\n\nThe location, description, and date of the survey support two family relationships:\n\nOn 8 November 1766, 50 Acres of Land in Augusta Country upon James River joining to a Tract formerly surveyed for Robert Gilespey was surveyed for James Galespy.[16]\n\nOn 8 November 1766, 50 acres on the south side of James River (the lower end of Cowpasture River) was surveyed for William Gilespy, adjacent to William's old survey.[17]\n\nOn 10 September 1767, Virginia Governor Francis Fauquier granted (by patent) Robert Gillespy 40 acres in Augusta County, on the north side of James River, on corner and line of his patent land.[18] [see above 18 June 1766 land survey]\n\nOn 27 August 1768, it was ordered that the Tithables in the bent of Jacksons River from Robert Galespys to Fort Young be Exempted from Working on the Cowpasture Roads.[19]\n\nOn 7 December 1769, an 80 acre tract in Augusta County, on two small branches of James River, sharing a corner and a line with his old Survey, was surveyed for Robert Gallespy.[20] On 20 June 1772, this land was granted (by patent) to Robert Gillespy. [see below 20 June 1772 land patent]\n\nOn 12 May 1770, Virginia Governor Norborne Baron de Botetourt granted (by patent) Robert Galaspy 54 acres in Botetourt County, on the northeast side of Jackson's River. The land was previously granted to James Montgomery, and had passed to Robert Montgomery who failed to pay the quit-rent.[21] [see above 9 June 1750 land survey]\n\nOn 15 August 1770, it was ordered that Matthew Arbuckle, Robert Galaspy, John Robinson, and William Hugart do view the Way from Jacob Persinger's to the Forks of Dunlaps Creek and make a report to the Court of the Conveniences and Inconveniences attending the same.[22]\n\nOn 9 October 1770, William Hugart, Robert Glasby & John Robinson the persons appointed to view the Way from Jacob Persingers to the Fork of Dunlops Creek reported that it is impossible to establish a Road there whereopon the order is discharged.[23]\n\nOn 13 August 1771, William Huggard, Robert Gillispie, and William Gillispie were to appoint the Tithables equally to work under Matthew Arbuckle, Jacob Passinger, and James Laurence.[24]\n\nNote: The above record is noteworthy because just three years later in 1774, Jacob Persinger and Matthew Arbuckle were the two lead scouts who guided General Andrew Lewis to the Battle of Point Pleasant.\n\nOn 20 June 1772, Virginia Governor John Earl of Dunmore granted (by patent) Robert Gillespy 80 acres in Botetourt County, upon two small branches of James River, sharing a corner and line with his old survey.[25] [see above 7 December 1769 land survey]\n\nOn 8 October 1805, Indenture between Alexander Gillespy and Sarah his wife of Botetourt County, Virginia, and Alexander Wilson of Botetourt County, Virginia, $1,666 and 2/3, two tracts of land (approx 219 and 1/3rd acres) in Botetourt County, on the north side of Jacksons River. The first tract contains 126 acres by survey, 25 acres part of a tract of 54 acre granted to Robert Gillespy by patent 12 May 1770, and 101 acres a tract of 80 acres with the surplus belonging granted to Robert by patent 20 June 1772 and the said Robert Gillespy who is now Deceased divised the said 126 acres to his son Alexander Gillespy by his last will and Testament which was fully proven in Botetourt June Court 1798. [bounds listed] The second tract is Alexander Gillespys undivided part (one third) of a tract of 280 acres surveyed for Alexander Gillespy and Robert and John Gillespy 6 December 1797 and granted to them by patent bearing date [not listed].[26][27] [see above land 12 May 1770 and 20 June 1772 land patents]\n\nTithables\n\nRobert Gelaspy (and other spellings) is listed in Botetourt County (created 1769, effective 1770, from Augusta County) tithables and property tax lists throughout the period 1771–1786.[28][29] There may be more than one Robert beginning in 1785.\n\n1771 - 2 tithables; for CPT.
