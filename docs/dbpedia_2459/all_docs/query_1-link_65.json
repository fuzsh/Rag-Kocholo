You find those wonderful ‚Äúah-ha‚Äù moments. And on occasion, you find a genealogy angel. Or they find you.\n\nMartha Spencer saw a post I made years ago on an Ancestry.com message board and responded. I missed her original response (!) but she found me again and it turns out she went to high school with my father. She sent me some of his yearbook pages as well as some newspaper clippings that pertained to my biggest brickwall, my g-g-g-grandfather Charlton Wallace.\n\nThis past week she sent me the relevant pages from my grandfather‚Äôs yearbook! Gilbert McClung Gillespie graduated from Lexington High School in 1934. My father attended Lexington High School until 1956 when he was a sophomore.\n\nHis ambition is ‚ÄúTo beat Thompson out of his job.‚Äù Thompson was Kenneth Thompson, whom according to Martha was a ‚Äúcranky‚Äù math teacher who was still teaching when she and my father attended Lexington High.\n\nOne has to believe that there is more to the story than that, but I don‚Äôt think the yearbook reveals any more. Also, I know that my grandfather was chosen as the Most Dependable. At least he wasn‚Äôt in the No Brains, but‚Ä¶ category!\n\nMy dad‚Äôs mentions in his yearbooks are not that different. His nickname was also Gilly. I knew he was called that in High School, never knew my grandfather was. My dad, was selected as the male with the Prettiest Eyes. My dad and his brother and two sisters all had the same beautiful blue eyes. I‚Äôm glad to know he wasn‚Äôt chosen as Most Gullible.\n\nAnd here are both Martha Spencer and my father who served on the Honor Court in 1954. Both are in the back row.\n\nThese photos and the rest that were sent to me, mean so very much. If you keep your family private and hidden away, you may miss out on some amazing stuff.\n\nAnd to Martha, thank you from the bottom of my heart. Every time I look at these I get a little misty. üôÇ\n\nMy Top Ten Blog Posts for 2012 on Finding Forgotten Stories\n\nMy most visited page on the blog is my How To Videos page where I post links and slides from my presentations that I do for Ancestry.com. Also the page Blogs You Should Read is highly viewed. (Maybe I should update that!)\n\nBut here, in order are my most read posts for the year:\n\nTreasure Chest Thursday ‚Äî Sourcing Presentations\n\nSorting Saturday ‚Äî Making Sense out of the Mess or Sources Matter\n\nSorting Saturday ‚Äî Good Source, Bad Source, Exhaustive Search\n\nSorting Saturday ‚Äî The Legend of Middle Names\n\nTuesday‚Äôs Tip ‚Äî Ask Ancestry Anne‚Äôs Top 20 Search Tips\n\nTreasure Chest Thursday ‚Äî The Gillespie Family Bible\n\nGilbert McClung Gillespie\n\nTuesday‚Äôs Tip ‚Äî Ancestry Magazine on Google Books\n\nWisdom Wednesday: It is what it is, it aint what it aint\n\nSympathy Saturday‚Äì Miss You Dad\n\nThat‚Äôs a pretty wide variety!\n\nTo everyone who has followed me this year, thank you. I learn so much by writing this blog and I‚Äôm glad you are sharing the journey with me. üôÇ\n\nWisdom Wednesday ‚Äî Wyatt and Laura\n\nWyatt Paul Gillespie, son of Jeremiah Gillespie and Mary E Gillespie, was born on July 15, 1865 in Amherst County, Virginia.\n\nLaura Cecil Donald, daughter of James Calvin Donald and Elizabeth Jane Wallace, was born on February 13, 1877 in Rockbridge County, Virginia.\n\nThey were married January 24, 1894 in Rockbridge County, Virginia. How they met is not known, at least to me. Wyatt was 28 and Laura was almost 17 when they married. 1 I suspect the picture below was taken around the time of there wedding.\n\nThey had 8 children, all born in Lexington, Virginia:\n\nMinnie Maude Gillespie (1897 ‚Äì 1958 )\n\nAshby Paul Gillespie (1899 ‚Äì 1967)\n\nEva Dold Gillespie (1901 ‚Äì 1992)\n\nClinton Clifton Gillespie (1904 ‚Äì 1990)\n\nLouise Graham Gillespie (1907 ‚Äì 1997)\n\nFred Douglas Gillespie (1910 ‚Äì 1974)\n\nGilbert McClung Gillespie (1914 ‚Äì 2003)\n\nHelen Mae Gillespie (1918 ‚Äì 2002)\n\nThey purchased the land at 108 Houston Street, Lexington, Virginia in 1907 and built the house on it in 1908. The house was owned by someone in the family until Gilbert‚Äôs death in 2003. The house was sold and moved. The land is now occupied by medical offices. 2\n\nWyatt died on July 15, 1941 at the age of 75. Laura lived for another 23 years and died at the age of 87 on August 23, 1964. They are both buried in Stonewall Jackson Memorial Cemetery in Lexington Virginia. Minnie, Eva, Fred and Gilbert are buried there as well. 3\n\nTreasure Chest Thursday ‚Äî One Document Defines Them All\n\nSome documents are like a really great Christmas, they just have everything in them that you need. This Deed of Conveyance 1 defines quite nicely Wyatt Paul and Laura Donald Gillespie‚Äôs children, their children‚Äôs spouses and Wyatt and Laura‚Äôs death.\n\nIn Wyatt‚Äôs will he left the house at 108 Houston Street to his wife, and upon her death to his two single daughters, Minnie Maude and Eva Dold.\n\nWyatt died, testate, February 19, 1941 and his wife Laura, died, intestate, August 23, 1964. 2 He states in his will, which is quoted in the Deed, that upon the death of his wife he leaves the property and house at 108 Houston Street to his two daughters Minnie M Gillespie and Eva D Gillespie. 3. Minnie died on Apr 1, 1958 4 leaving Eva as the only heir for the property.\n\nThe deed then instructs that his property, other than the land and house, should be sold off upon the death of his wife and that $25 should be given to his daughter Louise Montgomery and the rest be divided between his three daughters Misses Eva D, Minnie M, and Helen and his four sons, Clinton, Ashby P, Fred and Gilbert. 5\n\nThe rest of the deed is the release from the remaining brothers and sisters, their respective spouses, and their residences in 1965, who are as follows:\n\nAshby P Gillespie and his wife Margaret M of Newport News, Virginia,\n\nClinton C Gillespie and his wife Ernestine of Portsmouth, Virginia,\n\nFred D Gillespie and his wife Eleanor K of Rockbridge County, Virginia,\n\nGilbert M Gillespie and his wife Ann Irene, of Graham County, North Carolina,\n\nLouise Montgomery (widow) of Shelby County, Tennessee, and\n\nHelen Gillespie Keezel and her husband John Calvin Keezel, of Rockbridge County, Virginia.6\n\nSo we‚Äôve learned a bit about Wyatt and Laura and their family:\n\nThey had at least eight children, and the eight listed were alive when Wyatt wrote his will,\n\nIf there were other children, then they died without any living heirs,\n\nWhen Wyatt wrote his will, Louise was married and by 1965 she was a widow,\n\nHelen was married between the time her father wrote his will and her mother‚Äôs death she married John Calvin Keezel,\n\nMinnie died between the time her father wrote his will and 1965 (she died in 1958),\n\nWyatt wrote a will; Laura did not,\n\nThe deed for the property on which the 108 Houston Street House was built is recorded in Deed Book 102, page 467,\n\nWyatt‚Äôs will is recorded in Will Book 54, page 517,\n\nIn Wyatt‚Äôs will he specified that the ‚Äúfarm consisting of forty seven (47) acres, more or less, located at Poplar Hills one and one half miles southeast of Lexington, Va be sold at my death‚Äù and the proceeds be used to pay for his just debts and funeral expenses, the rest going to his wife,7\n\nThat when Minnie died, she left her mother as her sole and only heir, and\n\nNone of the property at 108 Houston Street had been sold at that time.8\n\nSo there are a few obvious things to do. Finding Wyatt‚Äôs will and more information about the property at Poplar Hills comes to mind.\n\nAnd in one legal document we have learned and documented Wyatt‚Äôs family and some of their relationships.\n\nSorting Saturday ‚Äî The Legend of Middle Names\n\nBoth my father and grandfather were named Gilbert McClung Gillespie.\n\nAccording to my father, it was tradition for parents to give the last name of the Doctor who delivered them as a middle name. The story was the elder Dr. McClung delivered my grandfather and the younger Dr. McClung who was the son delivered my father.\n\nI have found nothing to support that this tradition was prevalent in the early 1900‚Äôs but that doesn‚Äôt mean it wasn‚Äôt tradition. It made have been a family tradition.\n\nA search of the 1940 census in Rockbridge County, Virginia finds a Hunter McClung who was a practicing physician at the age of 60 in 1940. 1 I found no other physicians in Rockbridge County, Virginia whose last name was McClung. My father was born in the Stonewall Jackson Memorial Hospital in Lexington and I believe it is reasonable to assume that his doctor resided in Rockbridge County.\n\nHunter McClung was also a practicing physician in 1910 in Lexington. He was the son of John McClung who was a retired physician in 1910 .2 Again, I found no other doctors named McClung in Rockbridge County. My grandfather was born in Lexington, Virginia and Hunter McClung may have delivered him as well.\n\nI wonder if the same man delivered both my grandfather and father. I have never found the name McClung in our family tree and I suspect that there is a bit of truth to the story of where their middle names came from, but it does appear that if it is true then they were delivered by the same man.\n\nSorting Saturday ‚Äî My Documents Are a Complete and Utter Mess or Yes, Elizabeth Shown Mills is Always Right\n\nIn my post Sorting Saturday: Starting a Narrative Lineage, I stated that my grandfather was the descendant of a Civil War Veteran, specifically, the a member of the Stonewall Brigade. And I left the proof for later. Here are the statements I need to prove:\n\nGilbert McClung GILLESPIE was the son of Laura Cecile DONALD. 1\n\nLaura Cecile DONALD was the daughter of James Calvin DONALD and Elizabeth Jane WALLACE. She was born on February 13, 1877 in Lexington, Rockbridge, Virginia. 2\n\nJames Calvin DONALD was born June 30, 1836. He enlisted in enlisted in Company H, 4th Infantry Regiment Virginia on April 20, 1861, three days after Virginia seceded from the Union. He served in Company H, until April 16, 1862 when he transferred to Preston‚Äôs Company, 7th Cavalry Regiment Virginia. 3\n\nCompany H was part of the Stonewall Brigade.4\n\nOh goodness. I can not find a whole bunch of documentation. Ms. Mills tells us to document and summarize as you go. And you know she‚Äôs right. And I have stuff everywhere and it is totally unorganized.\n\nI shall take a moment to feel totally sorry for myself. And I vow to spend 30 minutes everyday to start sorting through documents online and in that big pile in my office and get myself organized.\n\nAnd never again do I pull documents and throw them on my hard drive or on a pile telling myself I will source and organize later. Probably never. üôÇ\n\nAnd I am going to get assertion about my grandfather and his grandfather documented.\n\n‚ÄúWisdom Wednesday: It is what it is, it aint what it aint\n\nAs I dig into my family history I‚Äôve run into things that have made me uncomfortable. I have at least six direct ancestors that fought for the Confederacy. As my niece exclaimed when I told her of this fact: ‚ÄúBut that is the wrong side!‚Äù\n\nAnd there is more: the Jim Crow south, attitudes toward women, slavery, just to name a few. It would be lovely if I could sanitize history and ignore these things. But the more I dig into the history of the times my ancestors lived in and begin to write it up, well, it is just not all pretty. It is not all comfortable. But I have to write about what was.\n\nBut I want to put my ancestors in the context of the time they lived in. I can‚Äôt know what they thought, but I can do my best to understand the events that shaped their lives and indirectly mine.\n\nAs we say in my family: It is what it is, it ain‚Äôt what it ain‚Äôt.\n\nHere is my first draft of my grandfather in the 1910‚Äôs and 1920‚Äôs.\n\n‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî-\n\nGilbert was born on March 20, 1914 in Lexington, Virginia. His father, Wyatt Paul Gillespie, was almost 49 years old and his mother, Laura Cecile DONALD, was 37 years old. He had six older brothers and sisters when he was born, the oldest, Minnie was 17 years old.1\n\nIn 1914, Woodrow Wilson was president and WWI was on the horizon. The family had purchased a lot at 108 Houston Street in 1907 and I imagine by the time Gilbert was born, they were living in the house that Wyatt had built. The address of the house was listed as either 22 and 108 Houston Street.2\n\nBy 1920, WWI was over. On January 17th of that year, prohibition had begun. Women were granted the right to vote in 1920 by the Federal Government, but Virginia did not ratify the law until 1952; women had been voting and holding elected office in Virginia since 1920.3\n\nBy 1930, The eighth and final child had arrived in the Gillespie household; Helen Mae was born on November 1st, 1918. Wyatt, 54, and Laura, 43, were living with all of their children: Minnie, Ashby, Eva, Clinton, Louise, Fred, Gilbert and Ellen. Also living with them was Harriet, Wyatt‚Äôs older sister who was 69. Eva, Clinton, Louise and Fred all attended school.4\n\nIn 1923, Warren G Harding, died of a Heart Attack in San Francisco, California. Calvin Coolidge assumed the presidency until 1929, when Herbert Hoover became president. In October of 1929, the US Stock Market had crashed. By March of 1930, 3.2 million people were unemployed.5\n\nI know my grandfather completed four years of high school, he probably attended Lexington High School.\n\nIn 1930, They owned the farm they were living on, and Wyatt worked as both a Carpenter building houses and as a farmer on presumably his own farm. Wyatt also employed two other people. Minnie was a Saleslady in a Dry Goods Store and Ashby was an Electrician in a Power Plant. They lived in a neighborhood where most people earned their living working for local merchants.6\n\nGilbert was known to say that jobs were hard to find, you should hang on to them. And I imagine that the family was glad to have 3 family members employed in 1930.\n\nSorting Saturday: Starting a Narrative Lineage\n\nI am prepping for my first CG attempt, which I hope to start sometime this year. One of the requirements is to write Narrative Lineage. I‚Äôm going to practice writing one for my paternal paternal line.\n\nToday, I‚Äôm going to write some informative paragraphs and a intro and end. I‚Äôm quite sure I‚Äôll rewrite them but it‚Äôs time to start. I‚Äôve got a lot more detail to fill in the middle here. but what I am realizing is how much of this is what I know I do not have sources. I need my grandfather‚Äôs birth certificate and marriage certificate, at the very least\n\nSo here goes.\n\n‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî-\n\nMy paternal grandfather, Gilbert McClung GILLESPIE, was born on March 20, 1914 in Lexington, Virginia.1 He was the seventh of eight children born to Wyatt Paul GILLESPIE and Laura Cecile DONALD. 2 His father was born at the end of the Civil War in 1865 3; his mother was the daughter of veteran of the Stonewall Brigade.4 Lexington, his hometown, was the burial place of Thomas ‚ÄúStonewall‚Äù Jackson and Robert E Lee. He is buried in the Stonewall Jackson Memorial Cemetery in Lexington, Virginia.\n\nOver his lifetime he lived through WWI and II, the Korean War, and Vietnam. The Civil Rights movement and 9/11. He raised 4 children and lived to see all 8 of his grandchildren. He had 12 great grandchildren, but he died in 2003 before most of them were born.\n\nHe died on November 21, 2003 at the age of 89 in Huddleston, Bedford, Virginia. His youngest son, Paul, was with him when he died. He was buried next to his wife, Ann Irene FEAZELL who had died twenty years earlier. 5\n\n‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî\n\nFootnotes\n\n1.

It is all reasonably ordered now.\n\nMy grandfather, Gilbert Gillespie, told my father that this deed was the key to everything. My dad thought thought it had something to do with the theory that we are related to Alexander Anderson ‚ÄúBig Foot‚Äù Wallace. Both are gone know, so it up to me to figure out.\n\nI do know that Samuel J Campbell was my grandfather‚Äôs cousin twice removed. I have no idea if William A Anderson was any relation.\n\nSamuel J Campbell Deed: Page 1\n\nSamuel J Campbell Deed: Page 2\n\nSamuel J Campbell Deed: Page 3\n\nSamuel J Campbell Deed: Page 4\n\nSamuel J Campbell Deed: Page 5\n\nSamuel J Campbell Deed: Page 5a 1\n\nHere is the transcription of the deed.\n\nImage 01\n\nSaml J Campbell‚Äôs trust & c\n\nTo squiqqle line Deed\n\nWm A Anderson\n\n1878 Mch 19\n\nExd\n\nTax 1\n\nRec 1.25\n\nPaid 2.25\n\nRecorded in Deed Book\n\nQQ page 212\n\nImage 02\n\nThis deed made this 15th day of March 1878 between James B Dorman and Chas A Davidson trustees of Saml J Campbell of the first part John C Bonds a Commisioner of the Circuit Court of Rockbridge of the second part Saml J Campbell and M L Campbell his wife of the third part and Wm A Anderson of the fourth part are all of the County of Rockbridge and State of Virginia Witnesseth; Whereas it appears from a Report of sale filed in the Chancery cause depending in the Circuit Court of Rockbridge in the name of Saml J Campbell‚Äôs trustees against Saml J Campbell & others, that James B Dorman and Chas A Davidson trustees under the authority of a deed of trust executed by said Campbell to them on the12th day of March 1872, and of Record in the Clerks Office of Rockbridge County County; and pursuant to a decree of the Circuit Court of Rockbridge pronounced in said Chancery Cause in the 10 day of April 1873, Offered for sale at public auction on the 11th day of June 1873 a certain lot of land near Lexington containing about Six Acres situated on the North side of the ‚ÄúFair Grounds‚Äù Road adjoining the lands of John Miller and other at which sale Wm A Anderson being the highest bidder became the purchaser\n\nImage 03\n\nof said lot for the Sum of One Thousand Dollars which sale was satisfied and Confirmed by the Court as appears from a decree rendered in said cause on the 15th day of September 1873.

Rockbridge County, Virginia, Deeds, Q: 212-216, Samuel J Campbell to William A Anderson, 19 March 1878, County Courthouse, Rockbridge.\n\nReturned not used: How I Almost Wasn‚Äôt\n\nWyatt Paul GILLESPIE was born at the end of the Civil War; his wife to be, Laura Cecile DONALD was born 11 years later. He grew up during Reconstruction and they lived their married life in Lexington, Virginia in the Jim Crow south. In 1907, for $400, they bought a home at 108 Houston Street from which you could see Stonewall Jackson Memorial Cemetery and they were buried there, Wyatt in 1941 and Laura in 1964.\n\nMy father‚Äôs paternal grandparents were married on January 24th, 1894 in Lexington, Virginia.\n\nWyatt was 28, single, born in Amherst County, Virginia, son of Jerry (Jeremiah) and Mary E GILLESPIE. (Jeremiah and Mary E were first cousins. My family tree twists twice. Don‚Äôt judge. 1)\n\nLaura was 17, single, born in Rockbridge County, Virginia, daughter of James Calvin DONALD and Elizabeth WALLACE.2\n\nTwo people, single, get married and lived, happily or some variation of that, ever after. But, and isn‚Äôt there always a but, those who are truly experienced in the art of genealogy know to do an exhaustive search to find the entire story. Wyatt actually has two marriage licenses. One was used, one was not.\n\nThe mystery of Lillian M Hatcher\n\nOn January 16, 1893, in Buena Vista, Virginia which is an independent city in Virginia right outside of Lexington, Wyatt and Lillian M Hatcher, ages 27 and 21, respectively, he born in Amherst Co, she born in Bedford Co., applied for a marriage license. It is marked as being returned on January 16, 1893. But way over there on the right hand side of the page, it states ‚ÄúReturned not used.‚Äù Why? I will probably never know.3\n\nLillian gets married on November 7, 1898 in Bedford County, Virginia to Paul G Tankersley who was a widower. 4 So there was no tragic accident that prevented Lillian from marrying Wyatt. Why they didn‚Äôt marry is probably a mystery for the ages.\n\nBut what I do know is this, if Wyatt had married Lillian, he wouldn‚Äôt have married Laura. And then there would not have been a Gilbert Gillespie to marry Ann Feazell and my father would not have been born. And I would not be.\n\nSo whatever happened, I have to say I‚Äôm glad it did. And now we know another forgotten story.\n\nFootnotes\n\n1.
