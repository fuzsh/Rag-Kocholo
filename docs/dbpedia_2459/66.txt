He attended the Australian Army Command and Staff College, Queenscliff in 1985 and became Australian Exchange Instructor at the Royal School of Military Engineering in the United Kingdom in 1986.[1] In 1989 he raised and then deployed as the second in command and operations officer, the 2nd Australian Contingent to the United Nations Transition Assistance Group (UNTAG) in Namibia.[2]

In 1990 he became Standing Chairman of the Quadripartite Working Group for the Engineers in the ABCA Armies Agreement and in 1991 he attended the UK Joint Services Command and Staff College where he earned a Graduate Diploma in Strategic Studies.[1] In 1992 he held a senior staff appointment at the Directorate of Engineers — Army (DENGRS-A). He was appointed a Member of the Royal College of Defence Studies in the United Kingdom in 1998 and was selected to be Senior National Officer for Australia in the ABCA Program in 1999.[1]

His senior officer appointments included becoming inaugural Commanding Officer of the 3rd Combat Engineer Regiment, Staff Officer Operations to the Chief of the Defence Force, inaugural commander of the Australian Theatre Joint Intelligence Centre (ASTJIC), for which he was made a Member of the Order of Australia,[3] and inaugural Principal Staff Officer — Intelligence, Headquarters Australian Theatre (HQAST).[1]

He was promoted to brigadier in January 1999. In this rank he was the Chief of Staff Training Command — Army, he commanded the United Nations Sector West multinational brigade in East Timor,[4] and he was the National Commander of Australia's contribution to Operation Slipper.[5]

Gillespie assumed his appointment as Chief of Army on 4 July 2008.[6] On 29 April 2010, Gillespie was presented with Singapore's Meritorious Service Medal by the Deputy Prime Minister of Singapore, Teo Chee Hean, and Chief of the Singapore Army, Brigadier General Chan Chun Sing. The award came as a result of Gillespie's "leadership and commitment to furthering relationships between the armies" of Australia and Singapore.[7] In August 2010, controversy arose when Gillespie outlawed the wearing of berets on the grounds that they led to an increased risk of skin cancer. The exemption of the special forces from the ban added to the controversy.[8] Gillespie handed over command of the Army to Lieutenant General David Morrison during a ceremony on 24 June 2011,[9] and officially retired from the Australian Defence Force two days later.
