Place fertile with raisin crops. In Macherado you can visit the restored 14th-century Ypapanti church with a bell tower from the highest of Zakynthos. The main attraction is the church of Agia Mavra. It is a one-aisled basilica with exceptionally rich decoration.\n\nHistory\n\nThe presence of Zakynthos is marked already in prehistoric times. The first reference to the island is made by Homer in the Odyssey, where he calls it “Ylisessa”, that is, woodland. According to the ancient geographer Pausanias, the island was named after Zakynthos, the son of the king of Phrygia Dardanos, who first settled the island, giving it his name around 1500 BC.\n\nThe 2nd century BC finds Zakynthos under Roman occupation and then under Byzantine domination.\n\nAt the beginning of the 2nd millennium AD, as the Byzantine empire is heading towards its fall, the Crusaders make their appearance.\n\nIn the late 12th century AD , the Franks occupy the Ionian islands and establish in 1185 the Palatinate County of Kefallinia-Zakynthos, which will last for three centuries under the leadership of the Orsini family initially, the Anguillai later and eventually the Tokes. In 1479 the Ottomans occupy Zakynthos.\n\nThe Venetians, recognizing the strategic importance of Zakynthos, occupy the island in 1485.\n\nVenetian occupation gives to the island for the first time in centuries, the possibility of economic and intellectual blossoming. The inhabitants were divided into three classes: the nobili, the civili, and the popolari. Only the class of the nobles, whose names were written in the Libro d ‘oro (Golden Book), had political rights.\n\nThe brutal exploitation of the people by the nobles led to the rebellion of the lower class of Popolari, the first social revolution in the history of modern Greece (1628-1632), which was eventually violently suppressed. The Zakynthians enthusiastically welcomed the messages of the French Revolution of 1789.\n\nVenetian domination ends after three centuries, in the last years of the 18th century, with its demise by the French Democrats.\n\nOn July 4, 1797, the three-color democratic flag replaces the flag of St. Marco in Zakynthos, and the Zakynthians enthusiastically welcome the ideas of freedom, equality and brotherhood. A few days later and with enthusiastic celebrations, the Libro d ‘oro is burned in San Marco Square.\n\nThe French occupation lasts only 15 months. In October 1798, the Russians and Turks occupy the Ionian islands, an occupation which lasted almost two years. Finally, in 1800, the two forces decided to establish an independent state under the name “Ionian State”.\n\nThe Ionian State, which was the first independent Greek state of modern history, lasted seven years. In 1807 , the French imperial troops occupy the Ionian islands. Two years later, in 1809, the English fleet occupies Zakynthos.\n\nThe British occupation (1809-1864) was the last period of occupation before the union with Greece. Major infrastructure projects took place during this period, such as roads, bridges, and a part of the harbor.\n\nFollowing the liberation from the Ottomans and the establishment of the Greek state, the request of the union of the Ionian islands with the rest of Greece is persistent. England, along with France and Russia, signed on June 5, 1863 in London, a treaty according to which, England should no longer act as the protector of the Ionian islands.\n\nOn 21 May 1864, the union of the Ionian islands with Greece was formalized.\n\nIn the 20th century, in 1953, a devastating earthquake followed by an extended fire destroys the island of Zakynthos. Historical buildings and churches are thus lost along with the treasures they contain. The city is rebuilt, this time according to a very strict seismic rule, while trying to maintain its old character.\n\nMuseums and monuments\n\nPost -Byzantine Museum of Zakynthos\n\nThis museum is located on Dionysios Solomos Square and opened its doors to the public for the first time in 1960.
