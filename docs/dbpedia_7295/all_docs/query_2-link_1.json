        "text": "(1778–1827). An Italian writer and patriot, Ugo Foscolo expressed in his works the ambivalent feelings of many Italians during the upheavals brought on by the emperor Napoleon’s rise. His novels and poems rank among the masterpieces of Italian literature.\n\nHe was born Niccolò Foscolo on Feb. 6, 1778, in Zacynthus on the Ionian Islands, which were then part of the Venetian republic (now Zákinthos, Greece). His father was Venetian and his mother Greek. He attended college in Spalato (now Split, Croatia) and Padua in Italy, and in about 1793 he moved with his family to Venice. In 1797 the performance of his play Tieste (Thyestes) made him famous.\n\nFoscolo’s early enthusiasm for Napoleon, proclaimed in his ode A Bonaparte liberatore (1797; To Bonaparte the Liberator), quickly turned to disillusionment when Napoleon ceded Venetia to Austria in 1797. His widely read novel Ultime lettere di Jacopo Ortis (1802; The Last Letters of Jacopo Ortis), contains a bitter denunciation of that transaction and shows the author’s disgust with Italy’s social and political situation. Some critics consider this story the first modern Italian novel.\n\nWhen the Austrians and Russians invaded Italy in 1799, Foscolo, with other Italian patriots, joined the French side. Made a captain in the Italian division of the French army after the defense of Genoa in 1800, he was sent to serve in France in 1804. While there he translated several classical works and Laurence Sterne’s A Sentimental Journey into Italian and wrote odes and sonnets. In 1807 Foscolo returned to Milan and published Dei sepolcri (Of the Sepulchres), a patriotic poem in blank verse, written as a protest against Napoleon’s decree forbidding tomb inscriptions. Its publication won for its author the chair of Italian rhetoric at the University of Padua in 1808. When the chair was abolished by Napoleon the next year, Foscolo moved to Milan. The satirical references to Napoleon in his tragedy Aiace (first performed 1811; Ajax) again brought suspicion on him; in 1812 he moved to Florence, where he wrote another tragedy, Ricciarda, and most of his highly acclaimed unfinished poem Le grazie (published in fragments 1803 and 1818, in full 1822; The Graces).\n\nIn 1813 Foscolo returned to Milan. After Napoleon fell the following year, the Austrians returned to Italy and forced many former rebels to make a pledge of allegiance. Foscolo, refusing to take the oath, fled first to Switzerland and in 1816 to England, where he supported himself by teaching and writing commentaries on Dante, Boccaccio, and Petrarch for The Edinburgh Review and The Quarterly Review. Foscolo’s life in England was difficult, however, and he incurred enormous debts. He died in poverty on Sept. 10, 1827, in Turnham Green, near London. In 1871, with great national ceremony, his remains were moved from England to Florence and interred in Santa Croce, the church he had celebrated as the final home of Italian heroes in Dei sepolcri."
