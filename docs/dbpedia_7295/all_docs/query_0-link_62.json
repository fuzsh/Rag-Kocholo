Boasting Greece’s legendary beach – the Shipwreck – Zakynthos is a siren that fascinates visitors with her evergreen olive groves and vineyards, golden sand beaches, temperate waters, gastronomic delights and fascinating trails.\n\nLiterature origins date back to the 15th Century at which time island poets were popular for their poems, prose, and translating texts from ancient Greek to modern Greek. A century later important literary figures such as Martelaos, Gouzelis, Matesis, Foscolo, Kalvos and of course Solomos, emerge.\n\nHow to reach Zakynthos and Sarakino"
