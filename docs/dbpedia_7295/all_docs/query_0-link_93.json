        "text": "Zakynthos or Zante is a Greek island in the Ionian Sea. It is the third largest of the Ionian Islands. The name, like all similar names ending in -nthos, is pre-Mycenaean or Pelasgian in origin. In Greek mythology the island was said to be named after Zakynthos, the son of the legendary Arcadian chief Dardanus.\n\nThe Ionian Islands are a group of islands in Greece. They are traditionally called the Heptanese and are from north to south: Kerkyra (Corfu), Paxi, Lefkada, Ithaki (Ithaca), Kefalonia (Cephalonia), Zakynthos (Zante) and Kythira (Cythera).\n\nThe nickname of Zakynthos is \"the Flower of the Levant\", bestowed upon it by the Venetians who were in possession of Zakynthos from 1484 to 1797.\n\nAmong the most famous Zakynthians is the 19th-century poet Dionysios Solomos, whose statue adorns the main town square. The Italian poet Ugo Foscolo was also born in Zakynthos."
