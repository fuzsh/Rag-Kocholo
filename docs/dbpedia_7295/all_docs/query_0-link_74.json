        "text": "Niccolò Ugo Foscolo (1778–1827) was born in Zakynthos, which had already belonged to the Venetian State for four centuries and was one of the most remote areas of its dependent territory. Foscolo genuinely seems to embody, since his birth, the world between the two shores of the Venetian Adriatic. During the time he lived — almost 50 years — historical events and political reshuffles undoubtedly took place at an intense pace. At the center remains the emblematic figure of Napoleon, who, with his armed and political actions, powerfully affected the entire European continent. Foscolo, a leading poet, writer, and columnist, captures through his overall written production and his letters the most significant events of his time, which played a dominant role in the evolution of Europe and its cultural identity. The aim of this presentation is to highlight the most crucial moments of history as Foscolo himself records them in his multidimensional work."
