Below, and in the media above, are some well-known examples of Italians in England whose nationalist goals received support and acclaim through the long century:\n\nUgo Foscolo, Poet, born in Greece, 1788, died in London, 1827. The video attached features an audio recording of his poetry, and an English translation can be found here.\n\nGiuseppe Mazzini, born in Genoa in 1805, died in Genoa in 1872, exiled to London, 1837-1843. Mazzini remained an active figure and parti-time inhabitant of London through the 1850s. He is remembered as a hero of the republic in a 1949 video celebrating a statute erected in his honor.\n\nPasquale Villari, historian and politician, attended the London International Exhibit in 1862 where he was invited to serve as Juror.\n\nGiuseppe Garibaldi, Italian Unification Activist, traveled to London in April, 1864. He received a hero's welcome, and was lauded as a \"Victorian Celebrity.\" A contemporary print and the New York Times article from April 28, 1864 record impressions of the event."
