You were the island Venus made with her first smile, Zakynthos, the moment she was born. No song embraced your leafy sky, not even his who sang the fatal storm and how Ulysses, his misfortunes past and beautiful with fame, sailed home at last.\n\nSome will not return: I too offend the powers that be, am banned from home. Oh maternal land, my words are all I have to send to you"
