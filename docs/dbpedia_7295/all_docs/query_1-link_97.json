        "text": "Giuseppe Mazzini announced, but never actually wrote, a biography of the Italian patriot and poet, Ugo Foscolo. This article recounts Foscolo's last years in exile by means of available documents in order to explain why Mazzini renounced the writing of Foscolo's biography and decided instead to complete and publish, under the latter's name, an edition of Dante's Divine Comedy that Foscolo had merely begun to sketch. Once he arrived in London, Mazzini suddenly shied away from the proposition, and having retrieved Foscolo's manuscripts for an edition of the Divina Commedia under Foscolo's name, decided instead to effect one of the most influential forgeries of the history of Italian literature: he substituted himself for Foscolo, completing the latter's edition of the Divina Commedia, and had it published, preceded by a preface written in an unapolo-getically patriotic tone and signed 'Un Italiano.' Why did Mazzini renounce his intention of writing a biography of Foscolo and decide instead to attempt a philological operation, quite removed from his own interests, which he did not want to attribute to his own scholarly merit and which, in fact, would constrain him, when near death, to a full confession?\n\nI propose a translation of Ugo Foscolo's masterpiece, the Sepolcri, as a way of rediscovering its central message, which arose from a meditation of Catullus 101. I also provide the translation of 3 sonnets which anticipate some themes of the major poem. The Appendix provides a translation of Leopardi's A Silvia, which shares the materialistic basis of the Sepolcri but, I argue, rejects its central message."
