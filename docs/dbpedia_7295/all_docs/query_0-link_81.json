        "text": "Zante is the third largest in size and second in population of the seven islands that make up the Ionian islands in the Ionian Sea, on the west side of Greece. Impressive steep shores, calm seaside and golden sandy beaches, extensive olive groves and vineyards, wooded hills characterize Zakynthos, known worldwide as the Caretta caretta turtle island.\n\nZante has remarkable historical monuments, monasteries, churches with impressive belfries and traditional settlements and is homeland to, among others, Greece’s national poet Dionysios Solomos. Other famous litterateurs as Andreas Kalvos, Grigoris Xenopoulos and the greek/italian Ugo Foscolo were born in Zante. The Old Flower of the East, the famous Fiore of Levante, has a long tradition in the arts and literature.\n\nComing to our island, we suggest you visit the most popular places and sights and admire its greatest beauties. One such point is Strani Hill, where Dionysios Solomos inspired the “Hymn to Freedom” and the “Free Besieged” (15km from our homes), the Port of Ζante and Dionysios Solomos Square in the town, the church of the patron Saint Dionysios and finally our most famous beaches, Laganas, Gerakas, Argassi, Keri, Tsilivi, Porto Zoro, Porto Roma, Vasilikos, the famous “Shipwreck” and the Sea Park of Zakynthos."
