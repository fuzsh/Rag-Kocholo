        "text": "abstract: This article explores the political thought of a leading Italian intellectual after his conversion from Jacobinism to liberalism. It shows the extent to which Foscolo was abreast of the then contemporary debate on constitutional government and nation-building. Moreover, it illustrates how he combined liberal with civic humanist and republican ideas, as well as idealism and Realpolitik in his perception of the problems faced by small nations struggling to be free in an era of international ideological conflict.\n\nThis chapter argues that the Mediterranean continues to be a relevant framework of historical and literary analysis even after 1800. By shedding light on two microhistories, one involving the lives of two Ionian poets (Ugo Foscolo and Dionysios Solomos) who became the ‘national poets’ of two different countries (Italy and Greece), and the other a multilingual and multinational text, the Scintille (Sparks, 1841), written by the Veneto-Dalmatian intellectual Niccolò Tommaseo, the chapter offers a reading of nineteenth-century literary history that is regional and maritime rather than national and territorial. The aim is to show how we can re-inscribe intellectuals considered to be the ‘national fathers’ of their respective nations, and works—a part today of different canons of ‘national literature’—into their regional and multicultural context.\n\nAs indicated by the subtitle of this brief yet ambitious talk, my aim is to sketch a comparison of how British and American contemporaries who observed the initial phases of the Risorgimento from their respective vantages responded to that movement, with its threefold aspirations for Italian independence, unification, and nationalism, particularly as those aspirations were presented by their proponents through their various, and even diverging interpretations of Dante. We shall find, perhaps not surprisingly, that British and American sympathies toward the Italian patriots who arrived on their shores in the early decades of the nineteenth century developed to a greater degree than understandings of their particular political situations and goals.\n\nGiuseppe Mazzini announced, but never actually wrote, a biography of the Italian patriot and poet, Ugo Foscolo. This article recounts Foscolo's last years in exile by means of available documents in order to explain why Mazzini renounced the writing of Foscolo's biography and decided instead to complete and publish, under the latter's name, an edition of Dante's Divine Comedy that Foscolo had merely begun to sketch. Once he arrived in London, Mazzini suddenly shied away from the proposition, and having retrieved Foscolo's manuscripts for an edition of the Divina Commedia under Foscolo's name, decided instead to effect one of the most influential forgeries of the history of Italian literature: he substituted himself for Foscolo, completing the latter's edition of the Divina Commedia, and had it published, preceded by a preface written in an unapolo-getically patriotic tone and signed 'Un Italiano.' Why did Mazzini renounce his intention of writing a biography of Foscolo and decide instead to attempt a philological operation, quite removed from his own interests, which he did not want to attribute to his own scholarly merit and which, in fact, would constrain him, when near death, to a full confession?"
