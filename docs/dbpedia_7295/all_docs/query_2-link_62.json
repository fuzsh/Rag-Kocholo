You come towards me so dear!\n\nEscorted by the summer clouds with glee\n\nAnd by the gentle breezes full of cheer,\n\nOr from the snowy air you come sending\n\nThat long, uneasy darkness to the world,\n\nO summoned night, upon the earth descending,\n\nThe darkest secrets of my heart you hold.\n\nAt sight of you my mind begins to wander\n\nTo the eternal void beyond the sky;\n\nAnd all along the wretched time meanders\n\nAnd with it all my worries; meanwhile I\n\nStand looking at your peace that calms the torment\n\nWithin my raging spirit lying dormant.\n\n--translated by Alexander Shaumyan Â© by owner. provided at no charge for educational purposes"
