Here it is in English so that you can join me in my academic endeavors.\n\n\"Never will I touch your sacred shore again\n\nwhere my young form reclined at rest,\n\nZakynthos, regarding yourself in waves\n\nof the Greek sea, where Venus was\n\nvirgin born, and made those islands bloom\n\nwith her first smile; nor did he bypass\n\nyour lacy clouds and leafy fronds\n\nin glorious verse, the one who sang\n\nof fatal seas, and of the broad exile\n\nafter which, exalted by fame and by adventure,\n\nUlysses kissed his rocky native Ithaca.\n\nYou will have nothing of your son but his song,\n\nmotherland of mine: and our fate already\n\nwritten, the unmourned grave.\""
