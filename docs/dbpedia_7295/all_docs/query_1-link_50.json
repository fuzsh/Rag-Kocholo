A celebrated Italian poet and patriot; born on the island of Zante, Jan. 26, 1778; died on Oct. 10, 1827, in London. His tragedy ‘Thyeste’ was received with great favor at Venice in 1797. ‘The True Story of Two Luckless Lovers, or Last Letters of Jacopo Ortis’ (1799), afterward rewritten and renamed ‘Italy’ (1802), voices his disappointment that the French armies did not liberate Italy. In 1807 was published his finest poem, ‘The Graves.’ His other works are: ‘Ajax’ (1809); ‘Ricciarda’ (1813); ‘The One-Volume Book of the Super-Revelations of the Cleric Didymus, Least of the Prophets’; and many critical and literary essays."
