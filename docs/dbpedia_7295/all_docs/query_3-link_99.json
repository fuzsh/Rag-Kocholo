        "text": "In 1806, Ugo Foscolo was in exile in London, his dream of Italian unity enacted not by Italians but by the conquests of Napoleon. The writers who had been alive at the time of The Last Letters of Jacopo Ortis, Alfieri and Parini, were both dead. In retrospect, Foscolo was the greatest living Italian writer, although I do think that is how he felt about it. He wrote a poem, “Dei Sepolcri,” “Of Tombs,” memorializing the great Italian writers, in fact memorializing memorials.\n\nA recent Napoleonic edict had moved burials outside of cities (sensible) and required uniform plain grave markers (totalitarian). The former does not bother Foscolo; the latter he sees as an attack on his culture. In Jacopo Ortis, the title character practically identified the tombs of the great writers as synonymous with Italian culture. “Of Tombs” develops the idea without Ortis’s histrionics.\n\nOn the one hand, who cares:\n\nOblivion draws all things into its night;\n\nA force that never tires wears all things out,\n\nNever at rest; and man and tombs of men,\n\nThe final shape of things, and the remains\n\nOf land and sea are all transformed by time.\n\nBut Foscolo argues for the importance of tombs at a human scale. A good anthropologist, he identifies tombs as an advance of civilization, part of the invention of “marriage, laws, and altars” that “[g]ave to the human animal respect.” Tombs served as\n\n… the cult which, through the rites may vary,\n\nThe love of fatherland and family\n\nTransmitted through the long succeeding years.\n\nJacopo Ortis spent part of his novel visiting the monuments of Dante, Petrarch, and others. Foscolo revisits them all in the poem, adding Alfieri and the English example of Admiral Nelson, a tribute to his ally and host.\n\nThe urns of strong men stimulate strong minds\n\nTo deeds of great distinction; and these urns\n\nMake sacred for the traveller that earth\n\nWhich holds them.\n\nTo what degree the tombs of the writers are meant to stand in for the works of the writers, and thus to what degree the poem is meant literally, remains a puzzle to me.\n\nThe last movement of the poems travels back to Classical Greece, to the Trojan War and the birth of poetry, or at least the poetry we still possess. It ends with the vision of Homer visiting the Trojan tombs and receiving the inspiration to write his works – but this is not the historic Homer but a future Homer who will\n\n… feel his way\n\nInto the burial place, and clasp the urns\n\nAnd question them.\n\nThis is the Homer who is inspired by our monuments to write the epic of Foscolo’s, and our, lost civilization. Foscolo’s apocalyptic vision is more cyclical than progressive.\n\nAnd you, Hector, will have your meed of mourning\n\nWherever men hold holy and lament\n\nThe blood shed for the homeland, while the sun\n\nContinues shining over human grief."
