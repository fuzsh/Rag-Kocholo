Courthouse Plaza\n\nStart your visit at the Courthouse Plaza, a historic square that serves as the heart of Prescott’s downtown area.\n\nPrescott was founded as the Territorial Capital of Arizona in 1864. Three years later, the Yavapai County Courthouse was built in the center of this two block city square that was set aside for government use.\n\nOver the years, the Courthouse underwent several renovations and expansions to accommodate the growing needs of the community.\n\nThe Classical Revival-style courthouse that stands today was constructed in 1916 and is considered one of the oldest public buildings Arizona.\n\nVisitors are free to enter the building during operating hours and you’ll find historical exhibits on the first floor.\n\nThe Plaza that surrounds the Yavapai County Courthouse is a beautiful community space that was even named one of the Ten Great Public Spaces of 2008 by The American Planning Association.\n\nThe plaza is a central gathering place and hosts a variety of events throughout the year, such as the Courthouse Christmas Lighting Ceremony, arts & crafts shows, music festivals, cultural celebrations, and the Frontier Days festivities.\n\nWhile you’re walking around the plaza, be sure to stop and see the Statehood Tree. This Deodar Cedar tree was planted on February 14, 1912, the same day Arizona became the 48th state of the United States.\n\nYou will also find a Centennial Tree that was planted on Arizona’s 100-year anniversary.\n\nThe Courthouse Plaza also features several statues of noteworthy citizens who impacted Prescott’s history.\n\nThe Bucky O’Neill statue is dedicated to William “Bucky” O’Neill, a Rough Rider and one of the first to volunteer for Theodore Roosevelt’s famous regiment during the Spanish-American War.\n\nThe Thomas J.

Whiskey Row\n\nWhiskey Row is a historic district located on Montezuma Street right across from Courthouse Plaza.\n\nDuring the gold rush and mining boom in the late 19th century, it became famous for its Wild West atmosphere and the rowdy, adventurous spirit that defined the area.\n\nAt its peak, it was home to over 40 saloons and gambling halls, which earned it the nickname “Whiskey Row”.\n\nThe Palace Saloon is the most famous establishment on Whiskey Row with a history that dates back to 1877. It was even one of Doc Holliday’s favorite watering holes!\n\nThe original building was destroyed in the devastating fire of 1900 that was started by a miner’s candle. Fortunately, the saloon was quickly rebuilt in the same location.\n\nThe Palace Saloon is recognized as Arizona’s oldest frontier saloon and has been named as one of the 10 Best Historic Bars in America by USA Today.\n\nToday, visitors can step back in time while enjoying a drink at the original carved wooden bar surrounded by memorabilia and artifacts.\n\nIf you’re hungry, try the Palace Pulled Pork Sliders, Whiskey Row Street Tacos, or Rough Rider Ribeye.\n\nAnother historic saloon on Whiskey Row, The Bird Cage Saloon, has a colorful past and offers a lively atmosphere with live music and entertainment.\n\nThe Rusty Spur Saloon is known for its country-western vibe, featuring live music and a dance floor.\n\nA few other notable places to visit on Whiskey Row include St. Michaels Alley which houses a collection of independent shops that contribute to the eclectic charm of the district.\n\nHotel St. Michael also stands as a historic cornerstone. The ornate hotel was built in 1901 and was the finest hotel in town.\n\nIt even boasted the first elevator in Prescott. Guests can spend the night in this historic hotel, or enjoy a meal at Bistro St. Michael.\n\nIf you’re looking for more accommodations, Hotel Vedome is a charming boutique hotel housed in an old historic home.\n\nThe Grand Highland Hotel is also an eclectic boutique hotel that is centrally located across from the Courthouse Plaza.\n\nWhile you’re on Whisky Row, stop by some of the shops, like the Prescott Trading Co. for Western souvenirs.\n\nThe Treat Center on Whiskey Row also has homemade fudge, candy apples, salt water taffy, kettle corn popcorn, and more.\n\nIf you walk a little further north on Montezuma Street, you’ll find “Love Locks”. Lovers add a lock to this chain link fence then throw away the key, symbolically locking their love.\n\nThe original Love Lock Bridge is located in Paris, France, but over the years they have popped up around the world. You can even find one here in Prescott!\n\nIf you are fascinated by the history of old frontier towns, be sure to visit the nearby town of Jerome and Cottonwood, as well as Bisbee, and Tombstone.\n\nWe also have a guide that includes 7 of the Coolest Ghost Towns in Arizona!\n\n3. Sharlot Hall Museum\n\nThe Sharlot Hall Museum is an open-air historical complex spread across 4 acres and includes 8 different historic buildings.\n\nIt provides a treasure trove of artifacts, documents, and exhibits that narrate the story of Prescott and its early settlers.\n\nThe museum is named after Sharlot M. Hall, a prominent figure in Arizona’s territorial history. She was a poet, journalist, and territorial historian whose efforts played a significant role in preserving the heritage of the area.\n\nThe museum encompasses several historic buildings, each with its own unique story and significance.\n\nThe Governor’s Mansion is a two-story log and frame house that was constructed in 1864 as a home for the first two territorial governors.\n\nToday, it stands in the same location where it was originally built and houses exhibits, artifacts, and furnishings that offers visitors a glimpse into the history of Prescott and Arizona.\n\nThe Fremont House was built in 1875 and was the home of the 5th territorial governor and his family.\n\nThe relocated home has been lovingly restored and furnished with period pieces to reflect what the home would have looked like when the Fremont family lived here.\n\nThe Bashford House was built in 1877 and is an elegant Victorian home that belonged to one of Prescott’s early merchants, Samuel L. Bashford. Today, it houses exhibits and the museum store.\n\nYou’ll also find a replica of Prescott’s first one-room schoolhouse in the museum complex. The schoolhouse is equipped with authentic furnishings to look as it did in the late 1800s.\n\nThe Ranch House was built in 1936 as a tribute to early ranchers and represents a glimpse into what everyday life looked like for the early settlers.\n\nFort Misery dates back to 1863 and is considered the oldest log cabin in the state.\n\nThe crude cabin was built by a trader from New Mexico as his home and mercantile. It later served as a boarding house, store, and law office.\n\nThe Transportation Building houses a collection of carriages, wagons, and early automobiles.\n\nThe Lawler Exhibit Center hosts changing exhibits that focus on various aspects of Arizona’s history and culture.\n\nBe sure to also take a moment to walk through the Territorial Women’s Memorial Rose Garden.\n\nThe first rose bush in the garden was planted in 1948. Today, hundreds of bushes bloom in remembrance of the brave frontier women who helped settle Arizona.\n\nA visit to the Sharlot Hall Museum really is one of the best things to do in Prescott and is one of our favorite stops on an Arizona Road Trip.\n\n4.

This cute bakery sells homemade doggie treats and toys that your pup is sure to love!\n\n5. Granite Creek Trail\n\nThe Granite Creek Trail is a 2.6-mile out-and-back riverside trail that is easily accessible from the center of town.\n\nThis urban trail follows along Granite Creek with access points at all of the major East-West streets.\n\nOne of the easiest access points is just a few blocks behind Whiskey Row. There is a parking garage on Granite Street and paved steps leading down to the trail right next to El Gato Azul Cafe.\n\nThe cafe has a beautiful outdoor deck that overlooks Granite Creek if you want to enjoy some empanadas and tacos before walking along the trail.\n\nCasa Alvarez and Dinner Bell Café also have dining tables that overlook the creek.\n\nAlthough it is only steps from town, the scenic shaded trail feels a world away. You’ll even find wooden sculptures and colorful murals thoughtfully placed along the trail.\n\n6. Watson Lake\n\nHead out of town to enjoy a day out in nature at Watson Lake. This man-made reservoir was formed in the early 1900s.\n\nWatson Lake is such a unique and beautiful lake surrounded by a high concentration of granite dells. They are so photogenic and also provide a fun place to climb and explore. It’s one of our favorite Underrated Spots in Arizona!\n\nSwimming is prohibited at Watson Lake due to pollution from an old mercury strip mine that is located upstream.\n\nHowever, you can rent paddle boards, kayaks, canoes, and pedal boats from Born To Be Wild Adventures that are open year-round. It’s one of the most fun things to do in Prescott! They even offer moonlight kayaking in the summer with lanterns and glow sticks, or you can rent a light-up pedal boat.\n\nThe Peavine National Recreation Trail is a 6-mile Rails to Trails project located by Watson Lake.\n\nIt is a multi-use trail for hiking, biking, and horseback riding that skirts along the shore of Watson Lake and cuts through the Granite Dells.\n\nThe trail follows along the abandoned bed of the Old Santa Fe Railway line that was built in 1893 and even crosses an old railroad trestle over Granite Creek.\n\nI would highly recommend renting e-bikes to ride along the Peavine Trail for a fun way to experience the history and beauty.\n\n7. Badger Springs Trail\n\nThe Badger Springs Trail is about an hour from Prescott. However, it is located on the way from Phoenix to Prescott just off I-17 so it’s an easy detour.\n\nThis is a great family-friendly trail with ease of access and a short hike with water to play in.\n\nThe 1.5-mile round-trip trail meanders along a small stream that empties into a river at the end of the trail.\n\nYou’ll find grassy banks for a picnic, rocks to hop across, crawdads and tadpoles to catch, and a sandy shore to bury your toes in.\n\nAncient petroglyphs can even be found carved into the basalt rock cliffs on the left where the stream enters the river.\n\nThis trail is a favorite among locals, but you’ll most likely have this relatively unknown oasis to yourself!\n\nBe sure to keep an eye out for rattlesnakes along the trail, particularly in the warmer month\n\nThe Badger Springs Trail is located within the Agua Fria National Monument recreation area just off I-17. You’ll need to take a narrow 1-mile unpaved road to reach the trailhead, but the road is passable with most vehicles.\n\nI would also highly recommend visiting the Fossil Creek Falls while you’re in the area.\n\nYou’ll need to take a long dirt road to reach the trail and you will also need to reserve a permit, but it is totally worth it! See our Fossil Creek Falls Guide for more information.\n\n8. Best Places to Eat in Prescott\n\nPalace Saloon is arguably the most popular and touristy place to eat in Prescott as visitors want to get a taste of the Old West.\n\nHowever, there are plenty of delicious restaurants around town that you won’t want to miss.\n\nRosa’s Pizzeria is a solid dinner choice with authentic Sicilian dishes. Try Rosa’s Specialty Dumplings filled with ricotta and spinach then pan-fried and drizzled with pomodoro sauce. All of their pasta dishes and pizza are amazing, try the Chicken Parmesan and the Godfather Pizza.\n\nFARM Provisions adds an elevated twist to simple dishes and the result is a culinary masterpiece. Try the Deep-Fried Deviled AZ Eggs or the Smoked Gouda Chorizo Fondue as an appetizer. For the main dish, try the Not Your Mom’s Chicken Pot Pie or the Bleu Collar Burger.\n\nThe County Seat is a cute breakfast and lunch cafe located on the top floor of the Burmister Building right across from the Courthouse Plaza.\n\nTry Tony’s Rueben with corned beef, bacon, swiss, saurkraut, caramelized onion, and a secret sauce served between two slices of toasted rye bread.\n\nPark Plaza Liquor & Deli is an unassuming spot, but they have the best burgers and wood-fired pizza. They also have wood-fired mac & cheese and wood-fired pretzels that are delicious!\n\nThe Lone Spur Café is the place to go for a hearty breakfast plate. Try the Brisket Benedict, Denver Omelette, or one of the Cowboy Breakfast Skillets.\n\nBill’s Grill is also a popular spot that is known for their signature burgers like the Portlander with caramelized onions, a fried egg, cheddar cheese, and special sauce. They also have really good fish & chips.\n\nThe Founding Fathers Collective is a neighborhood gathering space. You’ll find a self-serve brewery with Arizona’s largest self-serve tap wall, the Merchant Coffee Shop, and a variety of food trucks.\n\nThere is a nice outdoor patio space with tables and lawn games. It’s a great space to meet up with friends at the end of the day.\n\nMarino’s Mob is a favorite among families. It’s a great place to go for All-American burgers, fries and milkshakes. It is housed in a historic building that was built in 1887 and survived the 1900 fire.\n\nPrescott even has its own Speakeasy reminiscent of the prohibition days. The Point Bar & Lounge is located in an old 1900s bakery building that is located at 114 N Montezuma Street just north of Whiskey Row. Walk around to the back of the building and the entrance is under the red light. They only serve drinks here, so head over before or after you eat dinner.\n\n[convertkit form=3250084]\n\nA few more of the best things to do in Prescott:\n\nWorld’s Oldest Rodeo: Another of Prescott’s claims to fame is that it is the birthplace of professional rodeos.

The World’s Oldest Rodeo has been a Prescott tradition for over 130 years and is held every year around the 4th of July.\n\nHeritage Park Zoological Sanctuary: The Heritage Park Zoological Sanctuary is home to rescued and endangered animals.

It’s a somber place where you can pay your respects to these brave men.\n\nGiant Alligator Juniper Trail: You can also hike to what is believed to be the world’s oldest and largest giant alligator juniper tree.
