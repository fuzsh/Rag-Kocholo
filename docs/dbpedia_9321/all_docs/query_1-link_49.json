        "text": "Prescott ( PRESS-kət) is a city in and the county seat of Yavapai County, Arizona, United States. As of 2020 Census, the city's population was 45,827.\n\nIn 1864, Prescott was designated as the capital of the Arizona Territory, replacing the temporary capital of Fort Whipple. The territorial capital was moved to Tucson in 1867. Prescott again became the territorial capital in 1877, until Phoenix became the capital in 1889.\n\nPrescott has a rich history as a frontier gold and silver mining town. Mining and settlers brought frequent conflict with native American tribes in the area, including the Yavapai and Apache. Prescott was the home to Fort Whipple from its inception, which acted as a base for campaigns against natives. Prescott was a stereotypical \"wild west\" town during the latter half of the 19th century; famous residents included Doc Holliday and Virgil Earp of the gunfight at the O.K. Corral. The makeshift wooden town burned to the ground several times in the first decade of the 20th century, which finally resulted in the town being rebuilt in brick. The modern city subsists on tourism, especially around its storied past. It is host to the self-proclaimed \"World's Oldest Rodeo\", running continuously since 1888. The rodeo, one of the most famous in the United States, draws some 35,000 tourists a year.\n\nThe towns of Prescott Valley, 7 miles (11 km) east; Chino Valley, 16 miles (26 km) north; Dewey-Humboldt, 13 miles (21 km) east, and Prescott comprise what is locally known as the \"Quad-City\" area. This also sometimes refers to central Yavapai County in general, which would include the towns of: Mayer, Paulden, Wilhoit, and Williamson Valley. Combined with these smaller communities, the area had a population of 103,260 as of 2007 . Prescott is the center of the Prescott Metropolitan Area, defined by the U.S. Census Bureau as all of Yavapai County.\n\nThe Yavapai-Prescott Indian Tribe reservation is adjacent to and partially within the borders of Prescott.\n\nPrescott is in the Granite Creek watershed and contains the convergence of Miller Creek and Granite Creek on its north side.\n\nHistory\n\nArizona Territorial Governor John Noble Goodwin selected the original site of Prescott following his first tour of the new territory. Goodwin replaced Governor John A. Gurley, appointed by Abraham Lincoln, but died before taking office. Downtown streets in Prescott are named in honor of each of them. Goodwin selected a site 20 miles (32 km) south of the temporary capital on the east side of Granite Creek near a number of mining camps. The territorial capital was later moved to the new site along with Fort Whipple, with the new town named in honor of historian William H. Prescott during a public meeting on May 30, 1864. Robert W. Groom surveyed the new community, and an initial auction sold 73 lots on June 4, 1864. By July 4, 1864, a total of 232 lots had been sold within the new community. Prescott was officially incorporated in 1880.\n\nPrescott served as capital of Arizona Territory until November 1, 1867, when the capital was moved to Tucson by act of the 4th Arizona Territorial Legislature. The capital was returned to Prescott in 1877 by the 9th Arizona Territorial Legislature. The capital was finally moved to Phoenix on February 4, 1889, by the 15th Arizona Territorial Legislature.\n\nThe Sharlot Hall Museum houses much of Prescott's territorial history, and the Smoki and Phippen museums also maintain local collections. Whiskey Row in downtown Prescott boasts many historic buildings, including The Palace, Arizona's oldest restaurant and bar is still the oldest frontier saloon in Arizona. Many other buildings that have been converted to boutiques, art galleries, bookstores, and restaurants. Prescott is home to the Arizona Pioneers' Home and Hospital for Disabled Miners. The Home opened during territorial days, February 1, 1911. The city was named after author William H. Prescott, whose writings were popular during the Civil War.\n\nPrescott also has a place in western folklore with the fact that Virgil Earp, Wyatt Earp's older brother, lived in Prescott in 1879 and told him of the boom town in Tombstone, Arizona. It is also rumored that Doc Holliday spent some time in Prescott just before heading to Tombstone.\n\nAfter several major fires in the early part of the century, downtown Prescott was rebuilt with brick. The central courthouse plaza, a lawn under huge old elm trees, is a gathering and meeting place. Cultural events and performances take place on many nights in the summer on the plaza.\n\nBarry Goldwater, the 1964 Republican nominee for president, launched his presidential campaign from the steps of Prescott's Yavapai County Courthouse.\n\nNineteen members of the Granite Mountain Hotshots, part of the Prescott Fire Department, lost their lives Sunday, June 30, 2013 while battling the Yarnell Hill fire that ignited two days earlier south of Prescott.\n\nGeography\n\nPrescott is 55 mi (89 km) west-northwest of the State of Arizona's geographic center.\n\nAccording to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of 41.5 sq mi (107.5 km2), of which 40.7 sq mi (105.4 km2) is land and 0.81 sq mi (2.1 km2) is water.\n\nPrescott is considered part of North Central Arizona. It is just south of the Granite Dells. The Granite Dells area, or often called ‘The Dells’, is notorious for its large boulder outcroppings of granite that have eroded into a spectacular appearance of bumpy rock features. Within 'The Dells' are Watson and Willow Lakes, which are two small, man-made reservoirs. Here a number of hiking trails connect to the Peavine Trail. The Peavine National Recreation Trail follows what was the former rail bed of the Santa Fe. This railroad traveled from Prescott to Phoenix through the Granite Dells. The “Peavine” got its name from the winding portion of this railroad that twists and curves, resembling the vine on which peas grow. The Peavine trail connects to the Iron King Trail, which was the route of the old Prescott Railroad through the Granite Dells. Natural lakes include Lynx, Granite Basin and Goldwater, all surrounding different areas of this rustic community. Goldwater Lake, by Goldwater Park, is located four miles from downtown Prescott and is some 15 acres of water surface, and is a popular destination for park recreation and picnic facilities. Lynx Lake is another lake close to Prescott in tall Ponderosa pines, and gets some 125,000 visitors every year. This 55-acre lake offers visitors recreational activities, boating, camping, fishing, hiking, mountain biking, picnicking and even has a small, seasonal restaurant with a great view near the lake. Finally, there's the smallest of the natural lakes with some 5 acres of surface water at Granite Basin Lake. None of these lakes permit swimming, however all are popular recreational destinations near Prescott.\n\nGranite Creek flows generally north from the Bradshaw Mountains through the city, the Granite Dells, and the Little Chino Valley to the Verde River.\n\nClimate\n\nPrescott is located in the Bradshaw Mountains of central Arizona, at an elevation of 5,400 feet (1,600 m). Average annual precipitation for 1981–2010 is 17.75 inches (451 mm), with spring and early summer the driest times of the year. Snowfall is typically light and snow cover usually melts away quickly; the 1981–2011 average seasonal total is 12.8 inches (33 cm).The largest portion of precipitation falls during the July–September monsoon season. Average daytime temperatures remain above 50 °F (10 °C) the entire year, but diurnal temperature variation is large throughout the year, averaging nearly 30 °F (17 °C) annually. On average, temperatures reach 90 °F (32 °C) on 36 days annually, though 100 °F (38 °C)+ readings are uncommon and do not occur every year, much unlike the Sonoran Desert to the south and Mojave Desert to the west. The average season for freezing temperatures is October 21 through May 1.\n\nThere was a severe drought from 1999 to 2009, seen from the lack of snowpack in the Bradshaw Mountains. Local creeks do not contain water except immediately after the rare rains. Nevertheless, at the start of 2007 lakes were reported as full. The winter of 2005–06 had less than 3 inches (7.6 cm) of snow, compared to an average snowfall of 22 inches (56 cm).\n\nClimate data for Prescott, Arizona (1981–2010 normals) Month Jan Feb Mar Apr May Jun Jul Aug Sep Oct Nov Dec Year Record high °F (°C) 73\n\n(23) 77\n\n(25) 83\n\n(28) 88\n\n(31) 97\n\n(36) 104\n\n(40) 105\n\n(41) 102\n\n(39) 98\n\n(37) 92\n\n(33) 83\n\n(28) 78\n\n(26) 105\n\n(41) Average high °F (°C) 52.0\n\n(11.1) 54.6\n\n(12.6) 59.6\n\n(15.3) 67.0\n\n(19.4) 76.3\n\n(24.6) 85.7\n\n(29.8) 88.9\n\n(31.6) 86.1\n\n(30.1) 81.4\n\n(27.4) 71.7\n\n(22.1) 60.5\n\n(15.8) 51.5\n\n(10.8) 69.6\n\n(20.9) Average low °F (°C) 23.8\n\n(−4.6) 26.4\n\n(−3.1) 31.0\n\n(−0.6) 36.9\n\n(2.7) 45.0\n\n(7.2) 52.8\n\n(11.6) 60.1\n\n(15.6) 58.9\n\n(14.9) 51.3\n\n(10.7) 39.7\n\n(4.3) 29.5\n\n(−1.4) 23.4\n\n(−4.8) 39.9\n\n(4.4) Record low °F (°C) −21\n\n(−29) −12\n\n(−24) 2\n\n(−17) 11\n\n(−12) 20\n\n(−7) 28\n\n(−2) 34\n\n(1) 32\n\n(0) 26\n\n(−3) 13\n\n(−11) −1\n\n(−18) −9\n\n(−23) −21\n\n(−29) Average precipitation inches (mm) 1.57\n\n(40) 1.78\n\n(45) 1.60\n\n(41) .76\n\n(19) .49\n\n(12) .30\n\n(7.6) 2.71\n\n(69) 3.09\n\n(78) 1.95\n\n(50) .98\n\n(25) 1.08\n\n(27) 1.44\n\n(37) 17.75\n\n(450.6) Average snowfall inches (cm) 2.9\n\n(7.4) 3.9\n\n(9.9) 2.8\n\n(7.1) .6\n\n(1.5) 0\n\n(0) 0\n\n(0) 0\n\n(0) 0\n\n(0) 0\n\n(0) 0\n\n(0) .7\n\n(1.8) 1.9\n\n(4.8) 12.8\n\n(32.5) Average precipitation days (≥ 0.01 in) 5.7 5.9 5.9 3.4 2.9 2.0 9.5 9.9 5.8 4.0 4.2 5.0 64.2 Average snowy days (≥ 0.1 in) 1.1 1.1 1.0 .3 0 0 0 0 0 0 .3 1.2 5.0 Source: NOAA (extremes 1898–present)\n\nDemographics\n\nHistorical population Census Pop. %± 1870 668 — 1880 1,836 174.9% 1890 1,759 −4.2% 1900 3,559 102.3% 1910 5,092 43.1% 1920 5,010 −1.6% 1930 5,517 10.1% 1940 6,018 9.1% 1950 6,764 12.4% 1960 12,861 90.1% 1970 13,631 6.0% 1980 19,865 45.7% 1990 26,455 33.2% 2000 33,938 28.3% 2010 39,843 17.4% 2020 45,827 15.0% U.S. Decennial Census\n\nAs of the census of 2000, there were 33,938 people, 15,098 households, and 8,968 families residing in the city.

Prescott has 809 buildings on the National Register of Historic Places. The tallest house in North America, Falcon Nest is in Prescott, on the slope of Thumb Butte.\n\nPrescott is home to the downtown historical area known as Whiskey Row. ..... In 1900, a great fire destroyed almost all of the buildings on Whiskey Row, including the 1891 Hotel Burke, advertised as \"the only absolutely fireproof building in Prescott\". By legend, the patrons of the various bars simply took their drinks across the street to the Courthouse square and watched it burn. At the time of the fire, patrons removed the entire bar and back-bar of the Palace Restaurant & Saloon to the square by the patrons as the fire approached, re-installing it after the gutted brick structure was rebuilt. Whiskey Row runs north and south on Montezuma St. between Gurley and Goodwin St., directly west of the county courthouse. This single city block has been the home of the St. Michael's Hotel (formerly the Hotel Burke) and the Palace Hotel since the late 19th century, along with other colorful purveyors of nightlife. Originally built in 1877, The Palace Restaurant and Saloon was rebuilt after the fire, and is now the state's oldest continuous business. Merchant Sam Hill's large hardware store was near Whiskey Row.\n\nPrescott is host to the self-proclaimed \"World's Oldest Rodeo\", running continuously since 1888. Also known as \"Frontier Days\", it runs in the days leading up to Fourth of July. It is one of the most famous rodeos in the United States. In the 2010s, it drew over 35,000 tourists a year, nearly doubling Prescott's population for the rodeo week. During the same period, some 45,000 people also attend the Rodeo Parade, which winds through downtown Prescott. Though several other rodeos pre-date Prescott's by decades, Prescott claims it was the first to charge admission and turn it into a spectator sport. This is backed up by a 1985 trademark on \"World's Oldest Rodeo\". The rodeo was featured in the 1972 film Junior Bonner.\n\nPrescott hosts annual events such as Frontier Days, Easter Egg-Stravaganza, the Bluegrass Festival, Earth Day, July 4 Celebration, Tsunami on the Square, art festivals, a Cinco de Mayo celebration, Navajo Rug Auction, Pumpkin Patch Carnival, World's Largest Gingerbread Village at the Prescott Resort & Conference center (on the Yavapai-Prescott Indian Tribe reservation), Prescott Film Festival, Folk Arts Fair, parades, the Acker Music Festival, The Cowboy Poets Gathering, the Prescott Highland Games, Courthouse Lighting, Whiskey Off Road and Ragnar Relay Del Sol. On New Year's Eve, historic Whiskey Row saw the inaugural Prescott Boot Drop to usher in the 2012 New Year. The illuminated 6-foot (1.8 m) tall cowboy boot with multi-colored stars was lowered from the historic Palace Restaurant rooftop's 40-foot (12 m) flagpole to the delight and cheers of celebrants gathered on Montezuma Street which was closed for the occasion. Also in Prescott is the Heritage Park Zoo.\n\nThere are four golf courses within the city limits: Antelope Hills Golf Course, which consist of the City of Prescott South Course and the City of Prescott North Course, Capital Canyon Golf Club (formerly the Hassayampa Golf Club) (private), Talking Rock Golf Club (private), and Prescott Lakes Golf Club (private). More public courses are located nearby in surrounding towns.\n\nPrescott is home to The Arizona Pioneers' Home, a continuing care retirement home, operated and funded by the State of Arizona, originally intended for impoverished Arizona founders from Territorial days. Initially the home was built to house 40 men, but in 1916 an addition of a women's wing was completed to provide for 20 women. Later, in 1929, the home again expanded to include Arizona's Hospital for Disabled Miners (current total capacity is 150 beds). Scenes from the 2008 movie Jolene were filmed in the Pioneer's Home in 2006. The Home has had many colorful residents, including a John Miller, who claimed to be Billy the Kid, and who was exhumed from the Pioneer's Home Cemetery in 2005 in an attempt to identify DNA evidence. Another resident was \"Big Nose Kate\" Elder, who would also be laid to rest in the Pioneer's Home Cemetery, though not without controversy.\n\nPrescott is home to Prescott College, a small liberal arts college just west of the downtown area that emphasizes environmental and social justice. It is a non-profit organization which has an undergraduate body of roughly 800 students, and an average student to faculty ratio of 7:1 in on-campus classrooms. There are four general programs at Prescott College: the On-campus Undergraduate Program (RDP), Limited-Residency Undergraduate Degree Program (ADP), the Limited-Residency Master of Arts Program (MAP), and a Limited-Residency PhD program in Sustainability Education. Those enrolled in the Limited-Residency programs work with various mentors and Prescott College faculty, usually in their home communities. On-campus students live in Prescott and attend classes at the college itself.\n\n..... However, increased regulation and enforcement has whittled the number down to less than 30 as of June 2018.\n\nThe cultures of Prescott's recovery community, the students at Prescott College, and preexisting small town punk subculture have fostered a thriving punk scene. Shows are hosted weekly at house venues, tattoo shops, and bars throughout downtown and the Dexter neighborhood. Prescott has been home to several nationally known punk bands, including Bueno, Life in Pictures, and Hour of the Wolf. Local bands often play shows alongside touring bands, who include Prescott in their tours.\n\nPrescott was the location of Arizona's first Elks Lodge (BPOE).
