        "text": "Introductory Information\n\nThe Yavapai-Prescott Indian Reservation consists of approximately 1,400 acres that are adjacent to the city of Prescott, Arizona in central Yavapai County. Positioned at a crossroads for commerce, this reservation is intersected by U.S. Highway 89 and State Highway 69.\n\nIn the past, the Tribe depended upon timber, mining and agriculture for its economic base, a sand and gravel company added additional revenue and jobs. The Tribe owns Sundog Business Park, located at Sundog Ranch Road, east of Highway 89, and leases a 250 acre shopping center, Frontier Village, located at the gateway to Prescott.\n\nAs tourism and retail services have increased in importance in the region, the Tribe’s reliance on natural resources has declined. Today the Yavapai-Prescott Tribe is directly tied to the economy of Prescott and aggressively seeks to attract developers and new businesses to the reservation.\n\nApproximately 158 members belong to the Yavapai-Prescott Indian Tribe.\n\nGovernment and Council Members Listing\n\nRobert Ogo, President\n\nCalvin Hunter, Jr., Vice President\n\nLorna Galeano, Secretary-Treasurer\n\nSheila Salazar, Board Member\n\nPublic Relations\n\nAttractions\n\nSeveral hundred acres of the Reservation have been closed to development to maintain the natural beauty of the land. From the vantage point of these preserved lands, the sites and attractions of Prescott can be appreciated. Attractions include the landmarks Thumb Butte and Granite Mountain.\n\nGaming\n\nThe Yavapai-Prescott Indian Tribe owns and operates Buckey’s Casino, located in the Prescott Resort, and the Yavapai Casino and Smoke Shop located across from the resort.\n\nVisitor Amenities\n\nPrescott Resort and Conference Center\n\nSpecial Tribal Events\n\nContact the Yavapai-Prescott Tribe for more information\n\nContact\n\nYavapai Prescott Indian Tribe\n\n530 E.
