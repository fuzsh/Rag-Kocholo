The population of the city was 39,843 at the 2010 census.\n\nThe first capital was located at Del Rio Springs in 1863 where Fort Whipple was established. In 1864 the Fort moved to Granite City (current location of the Bob Stump VA Medical Center) and the capital was placed 2 miles south in the new town of Prescott.\n\nPrescott was chosen as the future site of the capital of the Arizona Territory by the governor of the territory in 1864. It was named in honor of historian William Prescott, a scholar of the history of Spain and Spanish America. Served as territorial capital from May 1864 until 1867, and then again from 1877 to 1889.\n\nPronounced locally as \"press-kit\" instead of \"press-caught.\"\n\nNearby cities:"
