        "meta_description": "Outside of Arizona, Prescott largely remains a mystery, its charming old-time downtown streets and its ancient Victorian homes almost as undiscovered by tourists now as Arizona was in general back before the gold rush boom of the mid 19th century. Not surprisingly, it's a few club-toting, birdie-seekers who are starting to change that. Prescott is emerging as a golf destination, a quality, lower-priced alternative to the crowded meccas of Phoenix and Scottsdale.",

Both Robert Trent Jones Sr. and Rees Jones had a hand in creating this classic 6,824-yard parkland play.\n\n... full article »\n\nEnjoy a blast from the past at Oakcreek Country Club in Sedona\n\nAs golf technology keeps progressing and architects on steroids keep designing longer and longer golf courses, it's refreshing to take a step back in time and play a course like Oakcreek Country Club in Sedona. It's a blast from the past, a Robert Trent Jones and Robert Trent Jones Jr. design that was built in 1968 and still holds up today. You won't encounter souped-up holes, blind shots or snooty attitudes, Scott Bordow writes. Oakcreek C.C. is simplicity at its best.\n\n... full article »\n\nSure it's grand, but where's the Grand Canyon golf?\n\nSure, the Grand Canyon can cause some awe, but after you've looked at it for a while, it's just a big hole in the ground with rocks all around.

Which is actually extremely unfair to the other worthy courses in Prescott. For Prescott Lakes is a course that would demand play anywhere. \"You might as well be playing one of the $300 resort courses in Palm Springs on a sunny spring day,\" writes Chris Baldwin.\n\n... full article »\n\nNature trumps forced carries at Prescott's one-of-a-kind Stone Ridge\n\nAt Stone Ridge Golf Course in Prescott Valley, the coyotes remind you you're not in the Phoenix-Scottsdale resort labyrinth anymore. And that's the point, right? Golfers come here to experience things you're not going to see in the tired and true golf destinations - and you're definitely not going to get to swing to a coyote chorus in Scottsdale's resort paradises.\n\n... full article »\n\nFrom Quayle to the Average Joe, Prescott loves Antelope Hills North\n\nThis is the golf complex in Prescott that everyone in Arizona somehow seems to have played a round on, including nearby Valley dweller Quayle.
