        "text": "Prescott ( PRESS-k…ôt)[5][6][7] is a city in and the county seat of Yavapai County, Arizona, United States.[8] As of 2020 Census, the city's population was 45,827.\n\nQuick Facts Country, State ...\n\nClose\n\nIn 1864, Prescott was designated as the capital of the Arizona Territory, replacing the temporary capital of Fort Whipple.[9] The territorial capital was moved to Tucson in 1867. Prescott again became the territorial capital in 1877, until Phoenix became the capital in 1889.\n\nPrescott has a rich history as a frontier gold and silver mining town. Mining and settlers brought frequent conflict with native American tribes in the area, including the Yavapai and Apache. Prescott was the home to Fort Whipple from its inception, which acted as a base for campaigns against natives. Prescott was a stereotypical \"wild west\" town during the latter half of the 19th century; famous residents included Doc Holliday and Virgil Earp of the gunfight at the O.K. Corral. The makeshift wooden town burned to the ground several times in the first decade of the 20th century, which finally resulted in the town being rebuilt in brick. The modern city subsists on tourism, especially around its storied past. It is host to the self-proclaimed \"World's Oldest Rodeo\", running continuously since 1888. The rodeo, one of the most famous in the United States, draws some 35,000 tourists a year.\n\nThe towns of Prescott Valley, 7 miles (11 km) east; Chino Valley, 16 miles (26 km) north; Dewey-Humboldt, 13 miles (21 km) east, and Prescott comprise what is locally known as the \"Quad-City\" area.[10] This also sometimes refers to central Yavapai County in general, which would include the towns of: Mayer, Paulden, Wilhoit, and Williamson Valley. Combined with these smaller communities, the area had a population of 103,260 as of 2007. Prescott is the center of the Prescott Metropolitan Area, defined by the U.S. Census Bureau as all of Yavapai County.\n\nThe Yavapai-Prescott Indian Tribe reservation is adjacent to and partially within the borders of Prescott."
