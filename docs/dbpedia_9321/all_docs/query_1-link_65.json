        "text": "The Territory of Arizona was created during the Civil War, and undoubtedly as a result of that conflict. Residents of southern New Mexico Territory had lobbied Congress for independence from Santa Fe for years, finally turning to the Confederacy (see the Tucson history posted on this blog June 29, 2011). But Congress wanted to preserve the Union and finance the effort with silver and gold. Silver claims had been staked at Tubac in 1856 and Patagonia in 1857, followed by a gold rush on the lower Gila River in 1858 and the Colorado River in 1861-1862 (see the Arizona Gold Rush article posted here December 21, 2009). Congress acted and President Lincoln proclaimed the Territory of Arizona 24 February 1863.\n\nMidwestern Republican carpetbaggers appointed by the President to hold offices prepared to journey to northern Arizona and create a capital city where no other town existed. Meanwhile, Colorado River gold placers were playing out, leading two parties of prospectors to explore the mountains of central Arizona where they knew the geology was favorable. Sure enough, in the spring of 1863 the A. H. Peeples (1842-1892) party led by mountain man Pauline Weaver (1797-1867) found gold along the lower Hassayampa River and on top of Antelope Peak (later named Rich Hill). The latter discovery proved the richest single placer in Arizona history. At the same time, the infamous Walker party who instigated the murder of Apache chief Mangas Colorado (see the Arizona Indians article, Part 2, posted February 14, 2011) ended up panning glitter out of the headwaters of the Hassayampa. As 1863 drew to a close, Governor John N. Goodwin (1824-1887) and fellow officials finally entered the territory and ceremoniously took office constituting a government as snow fell at Navajo Spring. With their military escort January 22, 1864 they reached Camp Clark, established little more than a month before at Del Rio Spring in Chino Valley. The army issued tents for their quarters and offices.\n\nPauline Weaver, considered Prescott’s first resident, and Van C. Smith (1837-1914) had log cabins in the forest 20 miles south of Camp Clark. There also, in the shallow valley of Granite Creek, Manuel Yesera (or Ysario, or Yrisorri) built a log cabin store in December 1863, later called Fort Misery. With the coming of spring 1864 Arizona Territory’s new capital quickly took shape. Governor Goodwin selected a site on the banks of Granite Creek in April and potential residents met in May to organize a town and name it Prescott, after the popular historian William Hickling Prescott (1796-1859). That same month the military encampment moved close to the town site and became Fort Whipple. Smith helped Robert Groom (1824-1899) survey streets and sales of lots began June 4th. July 4 the town held its first celebration and the first hotel opened. The first Sunday school met in August, followed by the first session of the Legislature September 26, the first formal dance in November and opening of the first private school in December.\n\nRichard J. Hinton’s Hand-Book to Arizona (1877) offers this view of Prescott’s “broad streets” around a central plaza, “giving ample space, thus avoiding that density of structure and population which so jeopardize the sanitary condition of many of our large cities.” Descendants of Europeans were adopting American urban design. The view looks northwest toward Miller Valley and Granite Peak (now Mountain). Soon, the tall pines on the Plaza would be cut and a Victorian style courthouse built. The business district lines Montezuma and Gurley Streets. “There are no adobes here,” Hinton tersely noted. In addition to the Plaza there was another public square just out of view at right that would provide a location for the capitol building. The two squares were joined by Union Street.\n\nThe unfinished log cabin built as the first capitol proved so uncomfortable that early legislative sessions were held instead in this larger log cabin, which also served as the Governor’s residence. Constructed July-September 1864 on Gurley two blocks west of Montezuma Street, its cost of $6,000 was exorbitant at the time, but necessary in order to get tools and supplies to such a remote part of the territory. The largest house in town for a number of years, the eight rooms also provided a home for the military commander for the first year and a home for the Governor’s secretary for more than thirty years. Secretary Henry Fleury (1817-1895) gained title to the building in 1876 and lived there until his death. It then passed through private hands and was renovated in 1899. Fortunately Tony Johns (1864-1944) convinced the State of Arizona to acquire the building in 1917 so it could become a museum. Territorial Historian Sharlot Hall (1870-1943) began working to accomplish that in 1929, partly at her own expense. Today, it is one of a number of historic structures preserved at Sharlot Hall Museum.\n\nEarly settlers of Arizona did not take for granted the structures of their western European culture, but aggressively built in the wilderness institutions based on liberal ideals. “The influence and sophistication of the government officials and other early settlers was extremely important in determining the character of this infant community. Despite the constant threat of Indian depredation and the inconvenience incurred in obtaining food, clothing and luxuries, the cultural climate of Prescott was ‘mile high.’” (Kitty Joe Parker Nelson & Charles Franklin Parker, “The Founding of Prescott,” Ariz. Highways, April 1964, pp. 2-11) Tucson as a capital would have offered culture too, and more comforts, but the “Mexican” and “southerner” influences could not be tolerated. Prescott became the Arizona city that most resembled communities east of the Mississippi.\n\nThere were fringe benefits that came with the capital. Prescott was home to the first private school in the territory (1864), the first Masonic Lodge (1865) and the first protestant church (1870), and enjoyed the commercial and security benefits of Fort Whipple becoming district headquarters of Arizona in 1866. The town was incorporated in 1872, obtaining legal title to a town site originally established without regard for federal law. An active Chinese community arrived that year followed by settlers from Kansas and eastern states. An economic downturn in mining in the 1880s was ameliorated by the cattle industry developed during the previous decade. The first Fourth of July rodeo was held in 1888. An electric light plant powered up in 1889. As the 1978 nomination form for the establishment of a Prescott historic buildings district concludes, “its history has been one of steady, unspectacular growth.”\n\nPrescott’s first public school opened in 1867 in a log cabin. A local brick factory allowed construction 1874-1876 of the large schoolhouse shown in this woodcut which appeared in the 1885 edition of Charles S. Gleed’s Guide from the Missouri River. . ., and was reproduced in Andrew Wallace, Images of Arizona (1971). Richard J. Hinton also included a version of this woodcut, saying, “Prescott can boast of the finest school building of this or any other sister territory.” There were classrooms for 300 students on the first floor of the $20,000 facility and an auditorium upstairs. In 1877, two teachers supervised an average daily attendance of 150. The building was torn down in 1902 to be replaced the same year by Washington School (300 E. Gurley), now the oldest schoolhouse still in use in the county. Across Gurley and one block west the territorial government built a two-story, red brick capitol building in 1884. After Phoenix became capital, the building was remodeled in 1904 to become Prescott’s first high school. It was demolished in 1914 to be replaced by a larger high school. After the high school moved to the banks of Granite Creek, the entire block was cleared in 1973-1974 to make way for the present Yavapai County Administration complex.\n\nPrescott’s entitlement as capital was sealed by one vote over La Paz by the first legislature. But by 1867, Tucson was able to gain its rightful place as capital and largest city. Ten years later the seat of territorial government was returned to Prescott until another dozen years brought it permanently to Phoenix. This birds-eye-view of the capital of Arizona Territory published in 1883 by Bancroft looks northeast toward the Plaza and Yavapai County Courthouse (1878) just before another building boom added a number of tall brick structures to the business district. At upper right edge is the schoolhouse (1876) on east Gurley Street. Granite Street is in the foreground, closest to the viewer. The outhouses (white roofs) at lower left along Granite Creek, which was usually dry most of the year, illustrate Hinton’s concern for sanitation.\n\nThough Tucson merchants provided banking services years earlier, California interests organized the first bank in the territory, in Prescott in 1877. Soon after, The Bank of Arizona erected a fine brick building (at left) on the southeast corner of Gurley and Cortez Streets with law offices on the second floor. Emil Ganz (1838-1922) opened the Capitol Saloon in 1877 in a building rented from N. Ellis but moved to Phoenix two years later. Also in 1879, Bowen, Knowles & Co. general store announced a going out of business sale to concentrate on its sawmill and mining operations in the Bradshaw Mountains, while Bank of Arizona opened a branch office in Phoenix. In 1895, the tallest building in Prescott was completed for the Knights of Pythias fraternal order on the Capitol Saloon site. Around the same time a drugstore occupied the Bowen, Knowles building. Just before the fire of 1900, the bank began construction of a larger building that displaced the drug store (see below). That building has survived but the bank did not. The Bank of Arizona combined with others to form First National Bank of Arizona, long one of Arizona’s largest. First National went through a number of mergers and Wells Fargo ended up occupying the Prescott building until it closed the branch in 1998.\n\nIn 1879 there were three very similar brick buildings on three successive corners along the east side of Cortez Street bordering the plaza: Bank of Arizona, Goldwaters and Howey Hall. Goldwater Brothers from La Paz opened a store in Prescott in 1876 in a leased building newly constructed by blacksmith James Howey on the southeast corner of Goodwin and Cortez Streets (seen at right about 1877). Howey’s blacksmith shop shared the next building on the south with a Flour & Grain Depot operated by the Goldwaters. In 1879, the Goldwaters had the building in the photo at left built one block north on the southeast corner of Union and Cortez. The older store had been called J. Goldwater & Bros., but the newer became M. Goldwater & Son after Joseph Goldwater (died in 1889 at age 59) left the partnership with his brother Michael (actually spelled Michel, 1821-1903). In 1884 the former Goldwaters building became Howey Hall, a popular opera house. It was sold to the city in 1904 to become a fire station, along with the shop next door where the fire truck was parked. Both buildings were demolished in 1959 to make way for the present City Hall, dedicated 29 December 1963. The Goldwater store closed upon the retirement of Michael’s son Morris (1852-1939) and their building became a Clarence Saunders grocery in 1930 and then the Studio Theater (a cinema, demolished in 1979 or 1980). Clarence Saunders founded Piggly Wiggly in 1916 in Memphis, the first self-service supermarket. By the 1930s, Kastner’s Piggly Wiggly would be located on the northeast corner of Gurley and Montezuma. In 1938, Goldwaters reopened in the Otis Building (1888) on the northeast corner of Cortez and Union, across the street from their 1879 location. That store closed in 1978.\n\nA fire 29 July 1880 destroyed several buildings next door and came close to burning down Goldwaters, causing $3,000 in damages to their store. The Prescott Hook and Ladder Company was founded a few days later, followed by hose companies in 1884 and the Volunteer Fireman’s Association in 1885. Still, fires struck the business district again in 1883 and 1890. Wells were drilled and fire pumps installed at each corner of the Plaza. Despite precautions, July 14, 1900, fire began on Montezuma Street and destroyed most of the business district surrounding the Plaza on the west and north sides. However, the courthouse, and a handful of substantial commercial buildings survived to preserve Prescott’s Victorian architectural heritage.\n\nUpon completion of A&P and SP rails across Arizona in the early 1880s Prescott was disadvantaged for lack of a railroad. But within hours of a January 1, 1887 deadline set by investors the Prescott & Arizona Central Railroad (“the Bullock road”) reached the capital city from Prescott Junction (renamed Seligman) on the A&P. Undependable train schedules, high freight rates and cheap construction plagued the P&AC and it went bankrupt within a few years. The Santa Fe, Prescott & Phoenix Railway was incorporated in 1891 and built despite an economic recession from Ash Fork to Prescott by April 1893, continuing on to Phoenix in 1895. The difficult mountain construction was widely acclaimed and its curling trestles and looping roadbed earned it the affectionate nickname “The Peavine.” The route made it possible to travel by train from northern Arizona to southern Arizona without first leaving the territory. The SF, P&P built this depot in 1907 at the north end of Cortez Street. Rail transportation decreased cost for mines and cattle growers, lowered retail prices in town and brought more visitors. But with the triumph of the automobile, the main rail line from Ash Fork to Phoenix bypassed Prescott in 1962. Passenger service was discontinued the same year with freight service discontinued December 31, 1986, exactly one hundred years after the first train arrived in town. Tracks have been torn up and Prescott now has three former railroad depots without rail service. In addition to the building shown here, two former depots were moved to Prescott from Drake and Hillside to be used for other purposes.\n\nThe A. J. Head Hotel was built in 1900 on the east side of north Cortez Street, in the middle of the block just north of Gurley. At first only the center portion was constructed. Then, an addition on each end was added about seven years later. The Prescott and Mount Union Railway began streetcar operations in 1904 and 1905 on Gurley Street running to Fort Whipple, with a spur running north on Cortez to the railroad depot, a total of 2-3 miles of track. Regular service discontinued in 1911 and the track to Fort Whipple was removed in 1915. The Head Hotel housed various businesses on the ground floor, including the Post Office and Calles’ Saddlery with the horse statue pictured in this postcard view from about 1910. J. C. Penny’s was in the building at one time and then Western Auto. The hotel was extensively remodeled in 1980 to become Prescott Inn.\n\nThe Sisters of Saint Joseph of Carondelet came to Prescott in the fall of 1878, raised money and built a hospital by 1881. They founded an academy next door in 1885. Construction of a gothic church on the northwest corner of Marina and Willis began in the summer of 1891 and services were first held 17 February 1895. St. Joseph’s Academy constructed a new building 1901-1904, barely seen in this view on distant Murphy Hill at lower left. The old academy building, pictured at far right after a snowfall on this postcard from around 1909, was demolished in 1915, and the rectory was replaced with a larger stone building. The church has survived in more modest proportions. After being struck by lightning, the 115-foot steeple was removed in 1930. A parochial school opened in 1956 on Summit Avenue and St. Joseph’s Academy closed in 1966. The building was demolished. Sisters of Mercy took over operation of the little cottage hospital in 1893 and the building was moved to Grove Street (now Avenue) in 1898. There, construction had begun in the fall of 1896 and 24-bed Mercy Hospital opened 19 March 1897. The hospital building expanded in 1902-1903 and added a new convent and chapel building 1914-1915. A bungalow visitation suite was built in 1917 and a new surgery wing completed in 1937. Then, most of the hospital burned in 1940, leaving Prescott without a Catholic hospital ever since. Prescott College acquired the Convent in 1975 and built classrooms where the hospital had been.\n\nThis view from about 1910 shows Prescott National Bank (at left) on the northeast corner of Cortez and Gurley Streets, with The Bank of Arizona across the street followed by the three-story Knights of Pythias or Tilden Building (built 1892-1895). The Tilden Building originally provided a meeting room for the Knights of Pythias on the upper floor. Next door to Brekke’s Jewelry for many years, it was purchased by John Brekke in 1978 and restored in 1995. It’s now an art gallery. Behind the awnings in The Bank of Arizona building is A. Blumberg’s New York Store, which opened in May 1901. Prescott National Bank was organized in 1892-1893 and housed in the Levi Bashford Building. The sturdy structure seen here opened 13 January 1902. Not as durable as its premises, Prescott National Bank was liquidated in 1916 and succeeded by Prescott State Bank, which then failed in 1925. First National Bank In Prescott then opened in the same building in 1928 only to begin liquidation during the Great Depression in 1932. It was absorbed by Valley Bank & Trust Co. in 1933 to enjoy decades of stability. Valley Bank moved out in 1957 and the building was restored in 1998. There was a third bank founded in Prescott, in 1906, First Savings Bank. It became Pioneer Bank of Arizona in 1960 and moved its headquarters to Phoenix two years later to become Great Western Bank & Trust in 1970. (see: http://arizonanationalbanknotes.blogspot.com; Prescott Journal Miner, 2 Sept. 1916; Prescott Evening Courier, 31 May 1923; Casa Grande Bulletin, 12 Dec. 1925)\n\nThis birds-eye-view of Arizona’s eighth largest city in 1920 looks northeast from Pioneer Hill toward the county courthouse (white) in the middle of the Plaza. The 1878 brick courthouse was pulled down in 1915 and the cornerstone of this building laid 19 October 1916. Behind the courthouse to the right is the top of the Elks Theatre (yellow), the top of the Yavapai Club (white & pink) and the High School (red) on “Nob Hill.” The spire of Sacred Heart Church is in the distance to the left of the courthouse. Granite Creek is hidden in the trees among the cabins in the foreground. About 15 to 20 years before this scene was captured Prescott’s China Town and red light district lined Granite Street (in front of the row of light brown buildings in center). C. T. American Art published this postcard.\n\nA health camp and sanitarium industry revitalized the local economy after the 1900 fire. Dr. John W. Flinn (1870-1944) and his wife Margaret (1873-1950) offered a cottage sanctuary for tuberculosis patients called “Pamsetgaaf”, a name created from the first letter of each of the main elements of treatment: pure air, much sunshine, equitable temperatures, good accommodations and food. It operated 1903-1945. When antibiotics became the treatment of choice for TB, Prescott promoted its climate as a remedy for asthma.\n\nCattle ranching in Yavapai County grew steadily until the drought of 1894-1895 nearly ended the whole industry. Around two-thirds of the animals had died on the range by 1896. After rains returned cattle baron Charlie Mullen (1873-1948) showed up in 1917 and purchased many of the surviving ranches to become the county’s biggest producer by 1920. Then he lost everything in a bank foreclosure in 1928. Ranchers struggled through the depression years to hang on to their beloved lifestyle. (see: “The Yavapai Calf Plan,” Arizona Highways, May 1944, pp. 30-33) And through it all Prescott maintained an exciting image as a cowboy town.\n\nProximity to the mines at Jerome and in the Bradshaw Mountains sustained the Prescott economy long after the capitol was lost. Extension of railroads to the mines began with the United Verde & Pacific to Jerome in 1894 followed by the Prescott & Eastern to Mayer in 1898, the Bradshaw Mountain Railway to Crown King 1901-1904 and the Verde Valley Railroad in 1911. All of these short lines eventually came under Santa Fe Railway ownership and fell into disuse as mines closed. In 1988, the Verde Valley Railroad found new life as the Arizona Central, to serve the Clarkdale cement plant and offer tourist excursions.\n\nGurley Street looking west toward Thumb Butte about 1925 is lined with a number of historic buildings that survive today. The Benevolent & Protective Order of Elks opened a fraternal lodge and opera house 20 February 1905, on the south side of Gurley between Cortez and Marina. It became a cinema around 1910. The next building west, with the red roof over the bay window, is the Electric Building (1898) and then The Bank of Arizona (1901), with the trees on the Plaza beyond. Across the street is Prescott State Bank. And Brisley Drug is across Cortez Street from that bank in the red brick Bashford Block with awnings. Bashford-Burmister store is on the same side of the street, in the building with the flag. The flag across the street is on top of Hotel St. Michael.\n\nEarly automobiles obtained gasoline by filling cans at hardware or general stores. But after 1920 the now familiar gasoline station appeared along well-traveled Arizona highways, including US89 through Prescott. “Close to the business section, hotels, opposite High School,” Sill’s Service Station must have been on Gurley Street on the hill, opposite the old site of the high school. The back of this Curt Teich and Co. of Chicago postcard from about 1925 describes the “spacious driveways, attractive rest rooms, sanitary drinking fountain, full line of accessories, gas and oils, prompt service and courteous attendants.”\n\nThe Smoki People of Prescott began as a one-day “Way Out West” celebration in 1921, held to benefit the Prescott Frontier Days Association. Anglos dressed as pueblo Indians mimicked indigenous religious ceremonies like the snake dance to entertain tourists. It was a popular August event for several generations. In the face of increasing criticism by real Indians the shows ended and the group disbanded in 1991. The museum is still open.\n\nThe Civil Aeronautics Administration built Ernest A. Love Airfield northeast of town in 1942 and it became a Civilian Pilot Training facility for navy aviation cadets under the direction of the non-military War Training Service. Navy pilots began their training in very light planes, eventually to become ensigns in the US Navy Air Arm. (see Arizona Highways February 1943.) Following the war, Love Field offered flights by Frontier and Bonanza airlines.\n\nFort Whipple became a tuberculosis sanitarium during the First World War, and then a veterans hospital in 1920. Now named Bob Stump Veterans Affairs Medical Center, it is still generally refered to as Fort Whipple by locals. Incidentally, unlike the historian’s name, most residents pronounce the name of their community “PRES-kitt.” Medical care for the poor was a responsibility of county government and there are references to a Yavapai County Hospital for indigents as far back as 1885. When Mercy Hospital burned in 1940 the small county hospital could not fill the need. Prescott Community Hospital Association was formed in 1942 and opened the hospital pictured here in March 1943. The building is the former Jefferson Elementary School (1923) on Marina Street, which had closed about three years before due to declining enrollment. The community hospital was combined with the county hospital in 1964 in a new facility on Willow Creek Road. That institution survives as Yavapai Regional Medical Center.\n\nLooking west on Gurley in the 1940s from the intersection with Marina in the foreground, the Carnegie Library (1903) is on the southwest corner of the intersection across from the Hassayampa Inn (1927) on the northwest corner. Valley National Bank is on the northeast corner of Gurley and Cortez. Beyond the library is the Elks Theatre. Carnegie Library moved into a new building on East Goodwin in 1974 but the older structure survived to house offices. Built with community support, the Hassayampa was restored in 1986 and is still one of Prescott’s finest. On the hills above downtown are the Pioneer Home (at far left) and St. Joseph’s Academy. The photo for this L. L. Cook of Milwaukee real photo postcard appears to have been taken from the roof of the old high school building.\n\nThe intersection of Gurley and Cortez was still the center of the commercial district when Petley Studio issued this postcard about 1955. Eagle Drug Store in the Bashford Block (1901) is on the northwest corner, across the street from Valley National Bank (out of view at right). The next building to the left is the Union Block, then a small store front for Karl’s Shoes, then the former Bashford-Burmister building housing F. W. Woolworth and J. C. Penney, followed by a small store front for Franklins and finally Piggly Wiggly on the corner. The northeast corner of the Plaza is at lower left. Granite Mountain is visible above the Bashford Block.\n\nFor many years Highway 89 was the principle route across central Arizona from north to south, giving Prescott the chance to provide accommodations to travelers. The Mile-Hi Motel opened in 1953 among a number of similar businesses along South Montezuma Street before it turned into White Spar Road, US 89 south to Wickenburg. The business offered 11 units and a restaurant. Ralph (died 1976) and Mary Crotts opened the Mile-Hi and then Harvey Avenson (1916-2008) and his wife Katherine operated it more recently. The postcard is from 1953 or 1954.\n\nBusinessmen profited from the mines not just through direct investment and grubstaking, but when miners spent their money in stores on Cortez and Gurley Streets and Saloons on Montezuma Street. The block of Montezuma opposite the courthouse has long been known as Whiskey Row. The Palace Saloon, in the center of this photo postcard from about 1955, with flagpole on roof, opened in the 1870s and rebuilt after fires in 1883 and 1900. It became a soft drink parlor during prohibition then returned to stronger beverages as the Palace Bar. The northwest corner of the Plaza is at lower left and the Pioneers’ Home is visible on the hill in the distance. Arizona Territorial government established the Arizona Pioneers’ Home in 1909 as a retirement home for early settlers. The building was built in 1912. Before the St. Michael Hotel building was built, the southwest corner of Montezuma and Gurley was the site of The Diana (1868) bar and billiard saloon, “the largest and best in northeastern Arizona.” Built in 1900-1901 as Hotel Burke, the present building became the St. Michael in 1907.\n\nIn 1950, Yavapai County found itself without a dominant industry at a time when the population and economy of Arizona was booming. Emerson Electric opened a motor factory near the airport in 1964. It became Emerson’s US Motors division in 1967 then closed in 1988. Sturm Ruger moved into the building in 1989 and still makes castings there. In recent years, Arizona’s Christmas City restored its Victorian architecture and developed a diverse art community. Prescott also benefited from upscale real estate development that created suburban style subdivisions at Prescott Valley that now extend all the way south to engulf and enliven the mining ghosts of Dewey and Humboldt. Chino Valley, Prescott, Prescott Valley and Dewey-Humboldt are dubbed the Quad Cities by realtors.\n\nThis view of downtown, pictured for Prescott’s centennial on the cover of Arizona Highways magazine April 1964, looks northwest. St. Joseph’s Academy is prominent on Murphy Hill (red roof at upper left). The orange facade of St. Michael Hotel is just to the left of the Courthouse in the center of the Plaza at upper right. The Federal Building and Post Office (built 1931, orange & gray) is across the street from the courthouse to the south. Continuing south on Cortez, note the Hotel Vendome (1917), two-story, red brick with white porch, still in business.\n\nSee:\n\nLucile Anderson, Railroad Transportation Through Prescott (1934) U. of A. thesis\n\nAriz.
