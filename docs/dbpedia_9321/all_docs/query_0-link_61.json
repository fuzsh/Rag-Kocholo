Tuition free industry recognized certificates for your career.\n\nFor every Prescottonian, the distinction of Prescott being the first Territorial Capitol of Arizona is a point of historical pride. But what would you say if that was a misnomer?\n\nChino Valley, Prescott’s neighboring town was the location of Arizona’s first territorial government. According to the Chino Valley Historical Society, Lt. Amiel Whipple of the U.S. Army Cavalry chose the site in 1864 because it afforded “good water, firewood within 2 or 3 miles and building timber of the best quality. The neighborhood abounds in deer, antelope, turkeys, and other varieties of game.” Chino Valley was also the location of what would become known as the Verde River. The valley was the perfect location to supply the cavalry’s livestock with hay, water, and grazing land.\n\nA few months after Whipple’s arrival the established fort was moved to Prescott to be closer to the miner’s settlement. Fort Whipple is still in use today as the local U.S. Veterans’ Administration.\n\nCatch up with more Local News Stories on Signals A Z.com.\n\nDid you know you can now LISTEN to all your news and events updates on the Prescott Podcast Network, CAST11 ?\n\nFollow CAST11 on Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/cast11az facebook.com/cast11 a z\n\nFollow CAST11 on Buzzsprout: https://cast11.buzzsprout.com/ cast11.buzzsprout.com\n\nCAST11 – Be Curious."
