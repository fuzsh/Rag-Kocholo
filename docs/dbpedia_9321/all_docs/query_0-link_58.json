        "text": "Prescott is 90 miles north of Phoenix in the central highlands of Arizona, amid the largest stand of Ponderosa Pines in the world. Prescott’s mile-high elevation brings four mild seasons, with an average annual daytime temperature of about 70 degrees and more than 300 days of sunshine. Prescott is the headquarters of the Prescott National Forest and is the Yavapai County seat. The city is named in honor of William Hickling Prescott, a noted historian, and was Arizona’s first Territorial Capital, established in 1864.\n\nPrincipal Economic Activities\n\nPrescott is the center for trade in the region, with abundant retail establishments, professional services, non-profit service agencies, health care, government, light manufacturing, and distribution centers. Dignity Health Yavapai Regional Medical Center and the Northern Arizona Veterans Administration Hospital are excellent diagnostic, emergency and treatment centers. Education is a vital industry to Prescott. The city houses Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University, Prescott College and Yavapai College, which has a state-of-the-art Career & Technical Education Center. Manufacturing firms such as Sturm Ruger, CP Technologies, Ester-C, Pure Wafer and Canyon Aero Connect, all call Prescott home. Travel, tourism, cultural institutions, performing art centers, sporting events and government offices are important to Prescott's economy.\n\nScenic Attractions\n\nPrescott is rich in historic and scenic attractions. Sharlot Hall Museum and the Smoki Museum contain pioneer and Native American artifacts. Adding to the cultural experience are more than 800 buildings on the National Register of Historic Buildings. The city boasts numerous events throughout the year including the Whiskey Off-Road and Whiskey Row Marathon starting in late April. The Phippen Western Art Show takes place on Memorial Day weekend. The Bluegrass Festival and All-Indian Pow Wow occur in June. Prescott Frontier Days Rodeo coincides with the celebration of the Fourth of July. The County Fair and the Faire on the Square kick off in September. As Arizona's official Christmas City, the Christmas Parade and Courthouse Lighting illuminate the holiday season. During the summer months, the Courthouse Plaza hosts community events, arts, crafts and car shows. Prescott's Courthouse Plaza has been honored as one of the Top Ten Public Spaces in the United States by the prestigious American Planning Association. Prescott was also recently named one of the \"Coolest Downtowns in North America\" by Expedia.\n\nCommunity Facilities\n\nPrescott offers a wide range of community facilities. The city has five scenic lakes, 16 municipal parks, 15 lighted baseball and softball diamonds and six open-space nature preserves. A network of more than 450 miles of hiking, biking and horseback riding trails wind through the city and into the adjacent Prescott National Forest. In recent years, these amenities earned Prescott the title of “Top Outdoor Adventure Town.” Additionally, Prescott has libraries, museums, performing arts theaters, art galleries, public and private 18-hole golf courses, racquet ball courts, skate parks, tennis courts and eight newly opened pickleball courts."
