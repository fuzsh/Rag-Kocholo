        "text": "Prescott was founded in 1864 as the Territorial Capital before Arizona even became a state. When gold was discovered, the town drew miners and adventurers seeking their fortune. The World’s Oldest Rodeo got its start in 1888, writing the rules of modern rodeo, and placing its brand indelibly upon the character of Prescott and eventually spawning over 700 professional rodeos in 50 states. Prescott’s history is so colorful and fascinating, that early pioneer Sharlot Hall made it her life’s mission to create a museum and preserve as many documents and memorabilia as she could for future generations.\n\n1863\n\nFebruary 24, 1863 — President Lincoln signs Organic Act creating the Arizona Territory\n\nMay 10, 1863 — Walker Party forms Pioneer Mining District\n\nSeptember 19, 1863 — Surveyor General Clark reports on the new diggings in Arizona\n\nDecember 23, 1863 — Fort Whipple is founded in Chino Valley\n\nDecember 29, 1863 — Governor Goodwin’s Proclamation at Navajo Springs\n\n1864"
